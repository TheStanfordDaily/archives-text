# Conservative leadership erodes civil rights
## 
### Nicholas Hass Staff writer 
In recent years, the U.S. Supreme Court
and executive branch have demonstrated
increasing hostility toward civil rights legis
lation, a trend which shows no sign of abat
ing, according to Law Prof. William Gould.

This antagonism "has
really eroded effective relief
for the victims of discrimina
tion," Gould said.
The imbalance between lib

erals and conservatives on the Supreme
Court has resulted in increased difficulty in
proving discrimination, particularly in the
past two years.
Gould said this trend began with the
Nixon and Reagan administrations' reac
tionary position on the civil rights gains of

the 1960s and early 19705. "Only now is
their philosophy being realized at the
Supreme Court level," he said.
Gould called attacks against civil rights
by both the Supreme Court and the execu
tive branch a "two-tiered retrogression."
He noted that the Bush administration
continues the anti-civil rights attitude,
exemplified by President Bush's veto of the
1990 Civil Rights Act.
And, while it is unknown what effect
David Souter's appointment to the Supreme
Court will have, Gould said Bush probably
chose a justice who would support the
administration's civil rights views.
Coinciding with federal hostility toward
civil rights, Gould said apathy and disillu
sionment among the American public help
account for the current backlash against
civil rights legislation.

Grass roots concerns for civil rights are
not as intense as in the 19605, he said, since
worsened economic conditions create a lack
of widespread and vocal support for civil
rights. The Reagan and Bush administra
tions have used this frustration to their
advantage.
"In the short run it is going to mean the
erosion of both social programs and civil
rights gains," Gould said.
Prospects for change in the mood over
civil rights are tied to the country's eco
nomic situation, according to Gould, who
said the public must be politicized by the
dramatization of inequities between rich
and poor and racial and sexual inequities.
But for now, the Supreme Court and exec
utive branch are unlikely to change, Gould
said.
