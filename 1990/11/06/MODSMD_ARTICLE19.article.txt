# Editorial
## Recommendations 
### 
Today, californians are
casting their ballots for a
new governor, a host of state
officials and legislative representa
tives and a full 28 statewide propo
sitions.
The many issues brought up for
discussion this year are complex
and require individual study. From
a long list, The Daily's editorial
board focused on and selected for
endorsement a few of the most sig

nificant — and controversial —
races.
Following are the board's recom
mendations on the races for gover
nor and for Stanford's congression
al representative. In addition, the
edit board considered several
propositions on the environment,
alcohol taxation and political term
limits.
Consider the candidates and
issues carefully.

Governor
Dianne Feinstein

After months of mudslinging
and one of the most expensive cam
paigns in state history, Dianne
Feinstein and Pete Wilson have
battled nearly to a draw.
Both candidates are centrist,
somewhat indecisive and — hon
estly — boring.
They share many views. Both
are pro-choice. Both favor the
death penalty. Both oppose
offshore oil drilling. Both would
increase funding for the state cor
rections system.
Neither has addressed how his
or her administration would pay

for pet programs in the face of the
billion-dollar state budget deficit
expected next year.
In the end, the lukewarm
endorsement goes to Feinstein.
Some of her proposed social pro
grams are innovative, if not com
pletely flushed out. She is expected
to bring members of underrepre
sented groups into her administra
tion. And a Democrat in the gover
nor's seat will help clear up the
stalemate that has developed
between the governor and the
Democratic legislature in recent
years.
But it must be admitted: The
candidates' lack of distinguishing
characteristics makes party affilia
tion a key consideration in deciding
for whom to vote.

Congress
12th District
Sf Tom Campbell

Tom Campbell, the lower Penin
sula's representative in Congress
for the last two years, gets the nod
for a second term in the House.
Perhaps the most notable
attribute of the Stanford law pro
fessor's first term has been his con
sistent attempts to keep in touch
with his constituents through

mailings and town meetings.
On gun-control legislation, abor
tion rights and the Civil Rights Act
of 1990, Campbell has proven to be
an independent thinker, not
merely a puppet of Republican
party bosses.
More than anything, though,
Campbell wins the endorsement
for lack of a better alternative. His
Democratic challenger, Robert
Palmer, has contributed to the dis
cussion of campaign issues only
through weak, unsubstantiated
attacks on Campbell, while offer
ing few ideas himself.

Environmental
Propositions
Prop. 128
Ef NO
Prop. 130
Ef YES
Prop. 135
NO
Prop. 138
NO

Propositions 128, 130, 135 and
138 address one of California's,
and indeed the nation's, most com
pelling problems — the environ
ment.
That is why it's a shame that
voters have been presented with
the highly political "Big Green"

initiative, Prop. 128.
The proposition pretends to be
all things to all people, glibly
encompassing such diverse and
unrelated issues as pesticide use,
offshore oil drilling, chlorofluoro
carbon regulation and forests. Its
economic implications have been
widely questioned, and its success
ful implementation is doubtful.
Prop. 135 is political hot air
which presents a deliberately
impotent solution to the problem
of carcinogenic pesticides.
Prop. 130 bans clear-cutting of
forests in California. It allows
companies to cut timber only as
fast as the trees grow back, so
forests will last for generations.
Prop. 138, on the other hand, is
an attempt to kill Prop. 130. Sup
ported by the logging industry,
Prop. 138 pretends to be environ
mental legislation. It is a deceptive
proposition through which voters
will hopefully see.

Alcohol Tax
Propositions
Prop. 126
Of NO
• Prop. 134
YES

Proposition 134 seeks to address
countless alcohol-related problems
by placing a significant tax —
roughly a nickel a beer — on alco
hol sales.
By contrast, alcohol manufac
turers support Prop. 126, a penny
a-beer tax whose revenue would go
to the state's general fund. This
weakened proposition goes against
the admirable goals of Prop. 134.

Term Limit
Propositions
Prop. 131
& NO
Prop. 140
Gf NO

Propositions 131 and 140 are
poor attempts to curb the influence
of special-interest groups in state
government by limiting incumben
cy.
Although Californians might be
glad to lose a number of their "pro
fessional politicians," they would
also be losing good legislators and
officials.
