# Squirreling around
## Rodent leaves students in dark 
### Chris Eisenberg Editorial staff 
Following a shower of sparks
and crackling electricity, Phi Sig
residents were left in the dark for
two hours last night after a squir
rel chewed through the main
power line leading to the Campus
Drive residence.
Students inside the house at
the time of the 6 p.m. blackout
reported seeing arcs of electricity
jumping between power lines out
side their windows. "We thought
it was low fireworks," said Phi Sig
financial manager Mike Risch, a
junior.
Moments after the initial
Hashes of electricity, about half
the building was left without
power. Risch and several other

residents gathered outside to
watch a small fire burn on the
line.
Police and fire officials were
called to the scene and immedi
ately closed Campus Drive from
Mayfield Avenue to just beyond
the Theta Delta Chi house.
Fire Capt. Bruce Halberg,
while relatively confident that the
fire would remain confined to the
220-volt line feeding the house,
said his main concern was pre
venting the fire from spreading to
the larger 10,000-volt line above.
"It would be spectacular if one
of those 10,000-volt lines came
down," Halberg told another fire
fighter. "That'd be just enough to
ruin your day if it fell on top of
you."
According to Mike Marymee, a
trouble-shooter for Pacific Gas
and Electric, a squirrel is probably
to blame. "We run into this a lot,"
said Marymee. "The squirrels
chew [the lines] to grind down
their teeth.
Although the power outage
struck during dinner, one Phi Sig
eating associate had no com
plaints. "Despite any electrical
fault, the chicken wasn't pink in
the middle," said junior Snowden
Armstrong.
And, most likely, neither was

Ihe squirrel.

For the record

An article in Friday's Daily
incorrectly attributed a quote
questioning the legitimacy of
Council of President's elections.
Graduate senator James Vera
pointed out that "in no election
has the (current) COP received a
mtgority of the votes cast."
A story in yesterday's Daily
about the gubernatorial race mis
spelled the name of Richard
Burress, an associate director of
the Hoover Institution.
