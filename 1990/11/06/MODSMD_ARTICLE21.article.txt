## The 						recipe for resolution 
### 
THERE'S SOMETHING TO BE
said for the ongoing campus debate
about multiculturalism; it's very
economical. With only one or two key
words on your part, people can immedi
ately place you in your proper place on the
left or the right.
It's economical in another way, too; it
saves people the trouble of thinking
through the issues. Either you're down
with it or you're not.
Once that question is answered with a
simple yes or no, everybody goes away
happy, having conserved their intellectual
energy for those term papers, problem
sets and intense in-class discussions.
I certainly believe that all the groups,
mine included, who are fighting for
respect and fair representation have
cause to be wary of criticisms that come
from outside.
It's very difficult for others to under
stand in any significant manner what our
peoples have endured, especially in an era
where the federal government has turned
its back on the still deeply ingrained prob
lems of racism and sexism in this country
(not a reed effective way of getting people
to examine their prejudices).
But nobody is right all of the time. And
sometimes perspectives can be informa
tive in their misalignment.
In order for multiculturalism to
become a reality, those misalignments
need to be conscientiously examined, with
the goal of bringing them together
instead of forcing one to concede absolute
defeat to the other.
In a very broad sense, we need a new
language. This doesn't necessarily mean a

new vocabulary to describe issues of race
and gender. It's difficult to create words
out of the blue.
No, we need a reorientation that
acknowledges that some progress has
been made while keeping it clear that the
road still stretches far ahead and we have
a lot more marching to do.
Instead of approaching the debate as a
means of domination, we need to return it
to being a tool of communication, where
misunderstandings and honest mistakes
(i.e., not malevolent or malicious) are
going to happen.
Such mistakes need to be talked
through instead of punched through.
Reactionary responses to criticism may
work well to fire up the troops, but they
don't convince anybody to change their
mind — it just makes them wary of speak
ing it.
If we all pigeonhole one another, and
ourselves, as left or right, conservative or
progressive, multicultural or not, reac
tionism is going to rule the day.
In order to avoid that, groups working
for cultural change should be really lis
tening to the problems other people have
with their arguments for ethnic theme
houses, the Cultures, Ideas and Values
core, different distribution requirements,
etc. And both sides must be prepared and
willing to learn something new.
Another ingredient that should be
added to this 'recipe for resolution' is one
of mutual trust. Outside the boundaries
of this campus, where people are physi
cally suffering because of lack of equal
opportunity, trust is a dangerous thing.
Here in Disneyland, however, where

the material threat is nowhere near as
vital and the primary threat is to one's
intellect, it seems that we can afford to
accept opposition as honest expressions of
thoughtful disagreement rather than as
masks for prejudice.
Only then can multiculturalism be
truly inclusive, where every voice at least
gets a chance to say its piece. It may be
hard or insulting or boring to listen to a
particular voice, but somewhere, a credi
ble point might lurk.
We need to allow such a point to appear
or the debate becomes stagnant and the
agenda becomes dogma. Without such
inclusiveness, the new order we're seek
ing to create will merely be an inverted
order, and the cycle of suppression of
ideas and its concomitant oppression of
peoples will begin again from another
pole.
I don't want that and I don't think
that the people I work and live with on
this campus want that. But unless we
find a new language, that is what's going
to happen.
And if we refuse to try, we should
remember one thing; if there are winners
and losers in this fight, that just means
that the winners are going to have to
watch their backs.

added to this 'recipe for resolution' is one
of mutual trust. Outside the boundaries
of this campus, where people are physi
cally suffering because of lack of equal
opportunity, trust is a dangerous thing.
Here in Disneyland, however, where

the material threat is nowhere near as
vital and the primary threat is to one's
intellect, it seems that we can afford to
accept opposition as honest expressions of
thoughtful disagreement rather than as
masks for prejudice.
Only then can multiculturalism be
truly inclusive, where every voice at least
gets a chance to say its piece. It may be
hard or insulting or boring to listen to a
particular voice, but somewhere, a credi
ble point might lurk.
We need to allow such a point to appear
or the debate becomes stagnant and the
agenda becomes dogma. Without such
inclusiveness, the new order we're seek
ing to create will merely be an inverted
order, and the cycle of suppression of
ideas and its concomitant oppression of
peoples will begin again from another
pole.
I don't want that and I don't think
that the people I work and live with on
this campus want that. But unless we
find a new language, that is what's going
to happen.
And if we refuse to try, we should
remember one thing; if there are winners
and losers in this fight, that just means
that the winners are going to have to
watch their backs.
