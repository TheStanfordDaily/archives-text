## Feinstein's record outshines Wilson's 
### 
WE RECENTLY CAME ACROSS
some disturbing figures. A study
of voter registration statistics
forecasted that slightly more than one
third of all eligible voters will go to the
polls.
This small percentage of voters will
decide California's future — either main
taining the status quo in the belief that
problems ranging from growth to educa
tion are being adequately addressed, or
making a step for progress into the next
century.
California's gubernatorial race, for
example, will determine just which path
California will take. While mud-slinging
and empty campaign commercials may
have obscured the important issues, let's
consider the past records of Wilson and
Feinstein and see what they have to
offer.
Although Wilson may come across as
a moderate, his shocking voting record in
the Senate portrays him more as a Jesse
Helms wanna-be.
He voted for Contra aid, for school
prayer, for Star Wars, for Supreme Court
nominee Robert Bork, against Federal
funding of abortions for poor women and
just recently cast the deciding vote to
uphold Bush's veto of the 1990 Civil
Rights Act.
Incredibly, Wilson managed to do all
this damage with the third worst atten
dance record in the Senate (the second
worst was dead). During Wilson's term
as mayor of San Diego, crime soared 25
percent, robbery 114 percent, and rape
131 percent.
On the other hand, Dianne Feinstein
offers a clear plan for change and pros
perity for all in California.
She proposes to invest in our youth
now rather than investing later on down
the line in jails. Feinstein will make edu
cation a top priority in order to improve
a public education system which ranks
last in the nation by allocating more of
the state budget and lottery earnings to

education.
During her years as mayor of San
Francisco, crime plummeted 27 percent.
Financially, she has greatly promoted
trade with Pacific Rim nations while con
sistently balancing the budget (contrary
to Wilson's accusations). Deficit spend
ing has only been a phenomenon of
Reaganomics.
Tax breaks for the rich and Medicare
cost increases falling heavily on the poor
are seriously argued to be in the econ
omy's and society's best interest.
But don't cut Star Wars or subsidies
to tobacco farmers (whose products the
Surgeon General condemns) and for
heavens sake do not even consider prob
lems of ozone depletion, the homeless or
those without medical or psychological
services.
Within months we can muster billions
of dollars for mobilization in the Middle
East, but a national health plan is too
expensive. Yes, too expensive, but in the
meantime conservative Republican
administrations in Washington have run
up the largest deficits in the nation's his
tory. What do we have to show for it
after 10 years? A depreciated dollar and
an enormous foreign debt.
If you believe the world is a perfect
place, as does former president of the
College Republicans Keith Rabois who
cites that "22,000 of those defined as
below the poverty line in this country
have swimming pools or jacuzzis" and
therefore should be complacent and
happy, then I suspect you will vote
Republican.
But if you think, as we do, that this
state and nation have slept long enough,
that with intelligence, diligence and hard
work we can make this a better, fairer
and more equitable society, then I trust
you will join us in voting Democratic this
