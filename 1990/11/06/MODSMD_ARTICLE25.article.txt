And The Ass Saw The Angel
By Nick Cave

With "And The Ass Saw The Angel,"
Nick Cave expands into a new medium,
the novel. Cave is a skilled musician, who
played in and wrote songs for The Birth
day Party, an early English punk band.
Currently, he plays with The Bad
Seeds, a modern band who visited San
Francisco just last month, touring to sup
port their recent album "The Good Sun."
Cave, who has also foraged into acting,
appeared with the Bad Seeds in Wim
Wenders' brilliant film "Wings of Desire."
Joyously, for Nick Cave fans, the
muses were kind and Nick's attempt at
writing succeeds with this novel stirring
the same feelings which his songs'
poignant lyrics arouse.
"And The Ass Saw the Angel" is the
disturbing tale of Euchrid Eucrow, a
mute pariah who lives with his parents in
a shack outside a town in the Ukulore
Valley.
Euchrid's inbred father Ezra is a won
derful gent who derives his main pleasure

from trapping wild animals, bringing
them home, dumping them all in his
gigantic, old, empty water tank and then
watching the ensuing carnage.
Euchrid's mother, who Euchrid finds
unbearably odious, is slightly more nor
mal. She helps support the family by sell
ing her home brew, named "White Jesus,"
to the hoboes who hang around in the val
ley and is continually drunk from imbib
ing this liquid herself.
The Ukulore valley itself is an odd
place with large sugar cane fields and
other aspects reminiscent of the deep
South as depicted in such films as "Deliv
erance." The Ukulore Valley derives its
name from Jonas Ukulore, who is
described as being a prophet as well as the
founder of an odd religious sect known as
the Ukulites.
As in his songs, Nick Cave's words cre
ate vivid images of the bizarre, allowing
the reader to easily picture the Ukulore
valley as well as the many miscreants who
inhabit it. Cave's tremendously skewed
vision of humanity seems somehow oddly
both real and possible, not crossing the
line after which the bizarre becomes
unintelligible, losing all meaning.
While sometimes employing an impar

tial narrator, Cave mostly tells the story
through Euchrid. However, while
Euchrid recounts his life to the reader, he
edges closer and closer to death, because,
as he tells the tale, he is stuck in a swamp.
As the chapters wear on, he sinks ever

deeper into the swamp which is consum
ing him from the feet upwards.
Euchrid himself is an amazing charac
ter who Cave is able to make both repug
nant and attractive by giving the reader
insight into Euchrid's thoughts and
actions.
In"And The Ass Saw the Angel," as in
many of his songs, the Bible serves as an
enormous well of powerful imagery from
which Nick Cave draws frequently.
These are numerous Biblical refer
ences throughout the book. Cave includes
a flood, reminiscent of the great deluge.
The title comes directly from the Book of
Numbers, and in a few places actual scrip
tural passages, such as various psalms,
are incorporated into the text. The plot
too involves the mystical, which seems
both appropriate and believable within
the novel's setting.
Cave's prose, although sometimes
rough, allows him to vividly describe the
strange images, both alluring and dis
turbing, which seem to typify Nick Cave.
The book, which unlike Gaul is divided
into four parts, begins with an interesting
prologue. Within this section, Cave exper
iments with the visual format of novels.
One passage, describing the history of

Euchrid's father, is written with the
form, style and type set directly imitating
the Bible. Cave also includes a chart of
sugar cane production within the Uku
lore Valley, as well as a historical article
on the founding of the Ukulore Valley.
Cave's diction, which often consists of
words seldom used by other authors, fur
ther empowers the images which he cre
ates. "She began to snore. A minute
passed and ah fell into a sickly sweat.
Mah mouth filled with fould and acrid
rheum."
Nick Cave clearly has fun experiment
ing with various methods for presenting
his uniquely interesting visions within
the novel. And this works to his advan
tage, for in so doing he produces a work
which is pleasant for the reader as well.
"And The Ass Saw The Angel" pro
vides an interesting jaunt into the
bizarre, which would be odious to strictly
non-fiction readers with no imaginations,
but will most definitely provide enjoy
ment for anyone who savors the eclectic.

And The Ass Saw The Angel
By Nick Cave
Harper Collins, $19.95, 248 pages
Reviewed by Mark Ravaglia
With "And The Ass Saw The Angel,"
Nick Cave expands into a new medium,
the novel. Cave is a skilled musician, who
played in and wrote songs for The Birth
day Party, an early English punk band.
Currently, he plays with The Bad
Seeds, a modern band who visited San
Francisco just last month, touring to sup
port their recent album "The Good Sun."
Cave, who has also foraged into acting,
appeared with the Bad Seeds in Wim
Wenders' brilliant film "Wings of Desire."
Joyously, for Nick Cave fans, the
muses were kind and Nick's attempt at
writing succeeds with this novel stirring
the same feelings which his songs'
poignant lyrics arouse.
"And The Ass Saw the Angel" is the
disturbing tale of Euchrid Eucrow, a
mute pariah who lives with his parents in
a shack outside a town in the Ukulore
Valley.
Euchrid's inbred father Ezra is a won
derful gent who derives his main pleasure

from trapping wild animals, bringing
them home, dumping them all in his
gigantic, old, empty water tank and then
watching the ensuing carnage.
Euchrid's mother, who Euchrid finds
unbearably odious, is slightly more nor
mal. She helps support the family by sell
ing her home brew, named "White Jesus,"
to the hoboes who hang around in the val
ley and is continually drunk from imbib
ing this liquid herself.
The Ukulore valley itself is an odd
place with large sugar cane fields and
other aspects reminiscent of the deep
South as depicted in such films as "Deliv
erance." The Ukulore Valley derives its
name from Jonas Ukulore, who is
described as being a prophet as well as the
founder of an odd religious sect known as
the Ukulites.
As in his songs, Nick Cave's words cre
ate vivid images of the bizarre, allowing
the reader to easily picture the Ukulore
valley as well as the many miscreants who
inhabit it. Cave's tremendously skewed
vision of humanity seems somehow oddly
both real and possible, not crossing the
line after which the bizarre becomes
unintelligible, losing all meaning.
While sometimes employing an impar

tial narrator, Cave mostly tells the story
through Euchrid. However, while
Euchrid recounts his life to the reader, he
edges closer and closer to death, because,
as he tells the tale, he is stuck in a swamp.
As the chapters wear on, he sinks ever

deeper into the swamp which is consum
ing him from the feet upwards.
Euchrid himself is an amazing charac
ter who Cave is able to make both repug
nant and attractive by giving the reader
insight into Euchrid's thoughts and
actions.
In"And The Ass Saw the Angel," as in
many of his songs, the Bible serves as an
enormous well of powerful imagery from
which Nick Cave draws frequently.
These are numerous Biblical refer
ences throughout the book. Cave includes
a flood, reminiscent of the great deluge.
The title comes directly from the Book of
Numbers, and in a few places actual scrip
tural passages, such as various psalms,
are incorporated into the text. The plot
too involves the mystical, which seems
both appropriate and believable within
the novel's setting.
