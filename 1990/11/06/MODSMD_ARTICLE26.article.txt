The southwestern landscape that Bar
bara Kingsolver paints in "Animal Dreams"
is vibrant, consistent and beautifully exe
cuted. It transcends the at-times plodding
writing and the overblown plot that afflicts
the novel.
"Animal Dreams" is not a bad novel. In
fact, there are some stunning passages and
much genuine emotion generated for and
by the characters. The story centers around
Cosima (Codi) Noline, a med-school
dropout who has returned to her hometown
of Grace, Arizona where her father is slowly
dying of Alzheimer's disease.
Codi's sister, Hallie, has just left the
United States to help Sandinista peasants
grow crops in Nicaragua. In addition, the
town of Grace is being threatened by pollu
tion to the river that is its lifeblood.
The plot is convoluted, often unrealistic
and patently trendy. We've got the evil
American empire helping the Contras at
the expense of Codi's sister, the destruction
of both Native American and traditional
southwestern lifestyles, and the pollution
and possible diversion of the river by greedy
capitalists.
Frankly, Kingsolver can't handle all the
twists necessary to the storyline and the
reader becomes more annoyed by these
"big" issues than captivated.
The emotional center of the story is
Codi's development of identity and her
making a place for herself in the town. The
politically trendy issues only serve to dis
tract from the passion that the author has
for her main character.
Codi feels sorry for herself for being
bereft of a mother at the age of three. She is
convinced that she cannot handle loving
relationships and is tormented by memo
ries of a stillborn child she had when she
was sixteen.
The novel resolves when Codi begins to
trust herself and forms a relationship with
Loyd Peregrina, a man who was the
unknowing father of Codi's stillborn child.
The resolution of the plot is almost as
neat. Codi's sister in Nicaragua is killed by
the Contras. The town of Grace raises
money and consciousness by selling folk art
and manages to force the mining company

to stop polluting the river.
Codi is offered a permanent teaching
position and voted teacher of the year at the
local high school where her lectures on the
ozone layer, teen pregnancy and the dam
age done by a consumer society are all the
rage in the classrooms. It is the fantasy of
the trendy political activist.
Actually, the worst part of the novel is
not the plot, but the writing itself. This was
a surprise, as Kingsolver's previous books
"The Bean Trees" and "Homeland," have
been critically acclaimed. But "Animal
Dreams" suffers from a rapidly metastasiz
ing cancer of the simile.
On two pages in the second chapter
there are, count them, eleven similes and
metaphors. Wading through them is stulti
fying, especially when forced to read with a
straight face: "Kissing Loyd was delicious,
like some drug I wanted more of in spite of
the Surgeon General's warning."
But to be fair, about two-thirds of the
way through the book Kingsolver suddenly
breaks out of the dull, clotted prose and
begins to create scenes full of life, motion
and color.
A Native American ceremony leaps off
the page, as does an expedition to Tucson to
sell peacock pinatas to raise money to fight
the company polluting Grace's river. Emo
tionally and stylistically the prose leaps to
great heights and the reader is drawn
towards the end of the book in a rush.
Kingsolver attempts to portray the state
of mind of Codi's father, senile with
Alzheimer's, but this attempt captures all
of the confusion of "The Sound and Fury"
without any of the emotion.
Neither does the ending of the novel,
when we get tossed a classic workshop tech
nique of "symbolic image," that literally
hovers over the last page, practically
marked in neon lights. It is too bad that the
author wastes the honest emotion she had
generated with these last few awkward
paragraphs.
If Kingsolver had stayed off of her polit
ical soapbox, and if she had written the
entire work with the passion and intensity
that marks the later third of the novel, this
would be a great work.
As is, it's worth reading once, though I'd
take it out of the library or wait for the
paperback.
