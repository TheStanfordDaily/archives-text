Malomba is a fictitious holy city in
an Asian country. It is peopled pass
ingly by tourists, and more perma
nently by the locals who make the best
use of the religious mystique of the
city for tourists, as guides, god-men
and hoteliers. James Hamilton-Pater
son describes the adventures of the
Hemonys, an English family that is in
Malomba for a short time.
Tessa Hemony is the archetype of
the flower child. She is an ardent and
beloved follower of Swami Bopi Gul,
author of the spiritually enlightening
"The Fragrant Mirror." She is in Mal
omba with her children Zoe and Jason
to visit a world-renowned psychic sur
geon, "hadlam" Tapranne.
The congested town has adapted to
the attention it receives from foreign
travelers, from soft drugs and the
"Punk Panther" night club to thriving
business in the sale of herbs and oils
with medicinal powers.
Even the healers are thoroughly
commercialized in Malomba. The var
ious practitioners are located in a spe
cial "Healer's Village" and vie for the
ailing trade, most of the time with a
disorienting blatancy, as Tessa finds
out: " 'Cancer-cancer-cancer,' sang
out a little man trotting towards
them. 'You have a tumour, madam?' "
The main character of the story is
Laki, a bell-boy who brings the
Hemonys to the seedy Hotel Nirvana
where he works. Laki is about 14 or
15, still hoping for even a hint of facial
hair. He has been in Malomba since he
was about 12 and helps provide for the
rest of his family who live in a fishing
village.
Paterson, who is originally from
England, writes with a wry sense of
humor throughout this entire satire.
He has chosen (or created) a setting
and a cast of characters that allow him
to do so successfully. Paterson man
ages to capture the local flavor of the

city of 39 temples with great authen
ticity.
Laki is trying to carve out a niche
for himself in Malomba, after leaving
his family a few years ago. The city
and its rules are now known to him
and he has a semi-mentor and drink
ing partner in the night porter Rfy'u.
"Both Laki and Rqju had lived in
Malomba long enough to know that
the last place to expect charity and for
giveness was in a city of divines.
Priests and gurus, imams and rabbis,
fakirs, mullahs, bishops, brahmins,
healers, satanists and all the rest of
them: a shifty, gluttonous bunch.
That, at least, was their opinion."
Laki also displays a remarkable
ability to convince himself and others
of the accurate truth of an exagger
ated situation. This is similar to Rich
mal Crompton's William.
Paterson shows how the Western
ers are attacked by the huge cultural
difference they encounter, even if they

are seasoned travellers. There are two
levels of reality operating in Malomba
— and neither its citizens or its visi
tors are privy to both.
The tourists are always exposed to
a huge sensory load, sights, smells and
sounds that barrage them at all times.
They feel the religion that exists in
Malomba, perhaps only because they
are looking for it.
For people like Laki, however, the
world is so different economically, and
therefore philosophically. He is
focused on the best possible methods
of survival — a result of two years in a
holy city, where everyone wants a
piece of the foreigner pie.
But the story is not just a foray into
bizarre circumstances. Paterson
makes this book a remarkable success
because he manages to intertwine the
images and feelings of both sides.
Paterson is equally adept at slip
ping under the skin of his compatriots
and producing the thoughts utter
ances of the Malombans. And he ties it
all together with consummate style, a
combination of the insightful and the
satirical.

Rohan Sippy is proud to be from
India, a country that produces the best
god-men and mystics in the world.
