## An oxygen-starved view of Stanford athletics 
### 
Sometime in the middle of Satur
day's Mausoleum Party — oh, that
was the football game? — I realized
that all season long I hadn't really taken
advantage of the new football student
seats.
I'd been thinking about all the fuss
that greeted the change last spring,
when the Athletic Department
announced that students would have to
shift a few sections away from midfleld
in order to accomodate "other" fans (i.e.
fans who pay more than we do).

At the time, Athletic Director Andy
Geiger answered the criticism by saying
the new seats weren't that bad.
Anyway, right after Saturday's half
time frisbee dog show — need I say
more? — I decided to find out just how
bad the worst seats were. And so I
climbed up, up, up to the far corner of
the stadium. Section A, Row 80, Seat 31.
Once there, I turned around, took off
my oxygen mask and checked out the
view. And, actually, the view isn't half
bad ... unless, of course, you're one of
those fanatics who care about what's
happening on the field.
It wasn't the view that I noticed the
most, though. It was the silence. It
might have been quiet because there
were about five people in the 2,400-seat
section, or it might have been quiet
because the change in altitude had burst
my eardrums.
Or it might have been quiet because,
at the last football game I would ever
watch in Stanford Stadium, there was no
Band.
Of course, there were other reasons
for the morgue-like atmosphere.
(Actually, that's probably an
insult to morgues: At least there every
one has a darned good reason for keep
ing quiet.) No fans leads to not a lot of
noise, and most Stanford non-fans
apparently had better things to do this
week.
Sometime in the middle of the third
quarter, in the middle of another sort-of
cheer, I decided to find out what a few
other fans thought about the whole situ
ation. And so, turning to the two five
year-old boys who were sitting next to
me, I fired a hard-hitting, investigative
journalist-like question:
"You guys like the yell leaders?"
Two frowns, quickly followed by
shaking heads. "NO."
Hm. Maybe I was on to something.
Maybe Stanford students not liking the
yell leaders wasn't completely irrational.
Maybe it was something more funda
mental. I had to know why, and so I
forged ahead with the in-depth follow-up
question:
"Why?"
Two shrugs. "I don't know."
Great.
We sat for awhile, listening to the
refs' whistles and the far-off barking of
dogs. I got curious again fast, though, so
I started to yap.
"How 'bout the Band? Do you like the
Band?"
"YEAH!!!"
"Do you wish they were here?"

"YEAH!!!"
So did I, giving the Band the unani
mous support of Section A. Of course,
what we wanted didn't really matter;
after all, I was just a student and they ..
. well, I guess what five-year-olds enjoy
doesn't count for much, either.
So, whose opinion does count?
That's easy, and I realized it in the
middle of the fourth quarter.
A woman, her husband and their
small blonde daughter had made the
trek up to Nose-Bleed Central and were
talking to two other men who had been
there most of the game. After a few min
utes the woman noticed the almost
unbearable noise and delirium of the
crowd, and turned to ask what was up.
"Where's the Band?"
"They got suspended," one of her
friends answered.
"Again? For what?"
"They did a show on the spotted owl
in Oregon last week that offended a few
people."
"Oh." Pause. "Wait a minute — Who
suspended them?"
"Stanford's Athletic Department."
"You're kidding. Since when did they
get so sensitive?"
Aha!! I immediately thought of an
answer, but I didn't bother to share it (I
didn't want to add to the oh-so-deafen
ing crowd noise). The Department got
sensitive, I figured, as soon as the budget
deficit came to town. The best way to get
out of debt is to ask people for more
money. So, who does the Department
ask? Right on: alumni.
Of course, sometimes they screw up:
Last fall my parents received a newslet
ter from the Athletic Department detail
ing the crisis and, needless to say, asking
for money.
The point is that right now, with the
deficit, the last thing the Athletics
Department wants to do is annoy
alumni. Ever. And that means if the
Band ticks some "important" people off,
well, these days that's going to cause
problems.
It's funny how subservient an organi
zation can be when it wants people's
money, and I guess the Athletic Depart
ment is no exception.
With a few minutes left in the
game, I was thinking about how
the whole fiasco seemed, well,
childish. Then I heard the woman sitting
near me try to explain the situation to
her daughter, who was wondering why
the Band wasn't playing.
Sometimes, the simplest terms are
the ones that make the most sense:
"Where's the Band?"
"The Band got sent to its room." Mom
explained.
That hit home. "For what?" the little
girl asked, obviously upset.
"Well, they said some mean things."
Not good enough. "Like what?"
"Well, they made fun of the spotted
owl and of some other people."
Blondie wrinkled her nose and looked
disgusted. Obviously the whole thing
was too stupid for her to waste more
time thinking about it, so she went back
to playing under the seats.
I agreed. A football game without the
Band is still, of course, a football game.
Unfortunately, it's not a Stanford
football game.

If offensiveness is truly grounds for sus
pension, Cameron Macky and the foot
ball team would have been suspended
weeks ago.

climbed up, up, up to the far corner of
the stadium. Section A, Row 80, Seat 31.
Once there, I turned around, took off
my oxygen mask and checked out the
view. And, actually, the view isn't half
bad ... unless, of course, you're one of
those fanatics who care about what's
happening on the field.
It wasn't the view that I noticed the
most, though. It was the silence. It
might have been quiet because there
were about five people in the 2,400-seat
section, or it might have been quiet
because the change in altitude had burst
my eardrums.
Or it might have been quiet because,
at the last football game I would ever
watch in Stanford Stadium, there was no
Band.
Of course, there were other reasons
for the morgue-like atmosphere.
(Actually, that's probably an
insult to morgues: At least there every
one has a darned good reason for keep
ing quiet.) No fans leads to not a lot of
noise, and most Stanford non-fans
apparently had better things to do this
week.
Sometime in the middle of the third
quarter, in the middle of another sort-of
cheer, I decided to find out what a few
other fans thought about the whole situ
ation. And so, turning to the two five
year-old boys who were sitting next to
me, I fired a hard-hitting, investigative
journalist-like question:
"You guys like the yell leaders?"
Two frowns, quickly followed by
shaking heads. "NO."
Hm. Maybe I was on to something.
Maybe Stanford students not liking the
yell leaders wasn't completely irrational.
Maybe it was something more funda
mental. I had to know why, and so I
forged ahead with the in-depth follow-up
question:
"Why?"
Two shrugs. "I don't know."
Great.
We sat for awhile, listening to the
refs' whistles and the far-off barking of
dogs. I got curious again fast, though, so
I started to yap.
"How 'bout the Band? Do you like the
Band?"
"YEAH!!!"
"Do you wish they were here?"

"YEAH!!!"
So did I, giving the Band the unani
mous support of Section A. Of course,
what we wanted didn't really matter;
after all, I was just a student and they ..
. well, I guess what five-year-olds enjoy
doesn't count for much, either.
So, whose opinion does count?
That's easy, and I realized it in the
middle of the fourth quarter.
A woman, her husband and their
small blonde daughter had made the
trek up to Nose-Bleed Central and were
talking to two other men who had been
there most of the game. After a few min
utes the woman noticed the almost
unbearable noise and delirium of the
crowd, and turned to ask what was up.
"Where's the Band?"
"They got suspended," one of her
friends answered.
"Again? For what?"
"They did a show on the spotted owl
in Oregon last week that offended a few
people."
"Oh." Pause. "Wait a minute — Who
suspended them?"
"Stanford's Athletic Department."
"You're kidding. Since when did they
get so sensitive?"
Aha!! I immediately thought of an
answer, but I didn't bother to share it (I
didn't want to add to the oh-so-deafen
ing crowd noise). The Department got
sensitive, I figured, as soon as the budget
deficit came to town. The best way to get
out of debt is to ask people for more
money. So, who does the Department
ask? Right on: alumni.
Of course, sometimes they screw up:
Last fall my parents received a newslet
ter from the Athletic Department detail
ing the crisis and, needless to say, asking
for money.
The point is that right now, with the
deficit, the last thing the Athletics
Department wants to do is annoy
alumni. Ever. And that means if the
Band ticks some "important" people off,
well, these days that's going to cause
problems.
It's funny how subservient an organi
zation can be when it wants people's
money, and I guess the Athletic Depart
ment is no exception.
With a few minutes left in the
game, I was thinking about how
the whole fiasco seemed, well,
childish. Then I heard the woman sitting
near me try to explain the situation to
her daughter, who was wondering why
the Band wasn't playing.
Sometimes, the simplest terms are
the ones that make the most sense:
"Where's the Band?"
"The Band got sent to its room." Mom
explained.
That hit home. "For what?" the little
girl asked, obviously upset.
"Well, they said some mean things."
Not good enough. "Like what?"
"Well, they made fun of the spotted
owl and of some other people."
Blondie wrinkled her nose and looked
disgusted. Obviously the whole thing
was too stupid for her to waste more
time thinking about it, so she went back
to playing under the seats.
I agreed. A football game without the
Band is still, of course, a football game.
Unfortunately, it's not a Stanford
football game.

If offensiveness is truly grounds for sus
pension, Cameron Macky and the foot
ball team would have been suspended
weeks ago.

Sometime in the middle of Satur
day's Mausoleum Party — oh, that
was the football game? — I realized
that all season long I hadn't really taken
advantage of the new football student
seats.
I'd been thinking about all the fuss
that greeted the change last spring,
when the Athletic Department
announced that students would have to
shift a few sections away from midfleld
in order to accomodate "other" fans (i.e.
fans who pay more than we do).

At the time, Athletic Director Andy
Geiger answered the criticism by saying
the new seats weren't that bad.
Anyway, right after Saturday's half
time frisbee dog show — need I say
more? — I decided to find out just how
bad the worst seats were. And so I
climbed up, up, up to the far corner of
the stadium. Section A, Row 80, Seat 31.
