# Bruins surprise Card women
## 
### Amy Wusterbarth Staff writer 
Stressful midterms and piles of
homework mark the end of a hec
tic fall tournament schedule for
the women's golf team. The last of
four preseason tournaments
began yesterday in Palm Springs.
The Cardinal finished second
after the opening round of the
UCLA Desert Golf Classic.
Stephanie Davis placed second
individually, shooting a 73 on the
par 74 course. "I birdied my first
two holes. I've never done that
before, so it really relaxed me,"
said Davis. "I didn't hit very well
but I capitalized often enough,
and I really didn't have anything
to lose."
Davis would love a couple of
repeat performances in the second
and third rounds. "I would like to
hit more consistently and more
aggressively, but anything close to
today would be great."
Jodi Figley also focused on
relaxation yesterday."I wanted to
go out and just have fun," said
Figley. Her strategy paid off as she
ended the day on par with a 74. "I
played well here last year. Today I
had better putting but I made
some stupid mistakes."
Coach Tim Baldwin noted that
"both Stephanie and Jodi putted
very well." Putting has been a
weakness of the women in earlier
tournaments.
Rounding out the day's effort
was Adele Moore with a 76,
Audrey Wooding with a 77 and
Melinda Daniels with an 85. The
team played the back nine first
and shot four under par. On the
more difficult front nine, they
were eight over.
The course is exceptionally
long — 6,200 yards. The team
played for five and a half hours
yesterday. "You have a different
mental attitude because of the
longer fairways," said Davis, "The
greens are small so you need to be
accurate. Also the wind picked up
and became a factor."
Familiarity with the course
may have been a factor yesterday,
as tournament host UCLA shot
an incredible 291. "This was

UCLA's all-time low round," said
Baldwin, "We played earlier than
UCLA and thought that our 300
would lead."
Today Stanford is paired with
UCLA and prepared to close the
point gap. "UCLA shot a good
score, but they are an up and
down team," said Figley." Once we
put the pressure on, we can move
ahead. I'm not worried about
them."

'UCLA shot a good
score, but they are an
up and down team.
Once we put the pres
sure on. we can move
ahead.'

Neither Arizona nor San Jose
State, the top two ranked teams in
the nation, are at this tournament
so Stanford may be in line for a
victory. "Our goal is to win this,"
said Baldwin.
However, Texas is in third place
after the first round in the desert
with a 305, and hoping to oust the
Cardinal. "I can't predict what
Texas will do; they are a heck of a
team," said Baldwin.
Stanford is also a heck of a
team, though. They have won one
tournament this fall and placed
second and third in the other two.
"We're much more solid than last
year. We really support each other
out on the course," said Davis,
"The team is really fired up; we
really want to win. This is show
ing up a lot more than in the
past."
A win down in the desert would
be a great way to wrap up the pre
season competition, but all the
traveling does take its toll. "It
feels like the end of fall," said
Davis, "We're on the go and the
academics are slipping. Hopefully
we can hold it together for two
more rounds." Coming back to
problem sets and papers may be
tough, but bringing some victory
hardware home Wednesday night
could probably ease the pain.


Tracy Allen — Dally file
Audrey Wooding and her Cardinal teammates
would like to win their second tournament of 1990,
but they have to pass a torrid UCLA team on the
Bruins' course.
