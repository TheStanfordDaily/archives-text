About 100 Stanford students attended a noon rally
yesterday in White Plaza that encouraged voting for envi

Congressional candidate Robert Palmer, who supports

the propositions and
abortion rights, was
present to rally sup
port for his bid for
the 12th district seat.
Palmer, who chal-

lenges incumbent Republican Tom Campbell, shook
hands and spoke to students during the rally.
Organized by the Pro-Choice Alliance, environmental
groups and the Stanford Democrats, the event was meant
to "get everybody psyched" the day before the election,
said sophomore Flora Lu, head of Stanford's chapter of
the Student Environmental Action Coalition, a national
organization.
She said students may place voting low on their prior
ity lists because of midterms and other day-to-day wor
ries, but that they must become aware of important
issues and voice their concerns.
Rally speakers encouraged students to vote for pro
choice candidates and for California environmental
Propositions 128, 130 and 132.
Guest speaker Fred Miller, a community activist from
Richmond, reminded students there is "not an academic
solution" to the environmental problem. "The fight
against pollution has many fronts... The electoral front
has come to the fore," he said.
In discussions after his speech, Miller said Proposi
tions 135 and 138, which are sponsored by the agriculture
and logging industries, are intended to "confuse voters."
Miller also said he was pleased by young people's interest
in protecting the environment and fighting "the people
who are polluting."
Speakers advocated Propositions 128 and 130, nick
named "Big Green" and "Forests Forever," as well as
Proposition 132. These would set limits on harmful pesti
cides, emissions, logging and fishing.
Some speakers endorsed Palmer, gubernatorial candi
date Dianne Feinstein and lieutenant general candidate
Leo McCarthy, all of whom support the environmental
propositions and abortion rights, according to Stanford
Democrat Kevin Hartz, a junior.
Council of Presidents member Ingrid Nava said stu
dents together can have a "big impact" if they show they
are not apathetic.
Maria Peters, co-chair of MEChA, a Chicano/Latino
organiztion, said the Chicano/Latino community should
"explode the myth" that minorities do not care about vot
ing, especially because blacks and Latinos are the most
affected by pesticides and other environmental hazards.
Peters said farm workers walk into the fields every day,
