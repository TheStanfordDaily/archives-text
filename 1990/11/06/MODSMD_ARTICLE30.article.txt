# Men linksters in fifth at UCLA
## 
### Amy Howard Staff writer 
As the days at Stanford get shorter
and colder, one's mind tends to wander
from the books piled high before it to a
time when the sun was bright and the
days stretched on indefinitely, waiting to
be filled with outdoor recreation.
Apparently acting on these instincts,
the men's golf team has packed up and
headed south to Palm Springs for the
2nd Annual UCLA Desert Classic. The
Cardinal is the defending champion of
the 54-hole tournament, which will take
place today through Wednesday.
Stanford will defend its title against a
large field of competition, including the
California team that won the Stanford
Invitational two weeks ago. Other top
contenders will include UCLA, USC,
UC-Santa Barbara, Pepperdine and
Hawaii.
The Cardinal team making the trip
this year is quite different from the one
that made it last. The only returning
player is junior Christian Cevaer, who
will top the team's roster. Having just

returned from New Zealand, where he
helped the French national team to a
fourth-place finish in the World Ama
teur Team Championships, he should be
up to the task.
Following Cevaer will be sophomore
Mike Milliken, who shot a brilliant 209
at the Stanford Invitational to take the
individual title. Rounding out the team
will be sophomores David Rutkowski
and Greg Raleigh as well as freshman
Notah Begay. Begay recently garnered
first team All-American honors from
the American Junior Golf Association.
According to coach Wally Goodwin,
"We have a really young team. They
have a lot of experience playing golf, but
not college tournaments."
What they lack in experience, how
ever, they more than compensate for in
raw determination. "I know that every
time we play, I have guys who will bust
their tails as hard as they can. It's
always hard to say what will happen
with golf, but I know this team will
really fight to play better each day,"
Goodwin said.
"Since the team is so different, we

don't really have an advantage irom
winning the tournament last year," Mil
liken explained. "But I'm excited about
this tournament. The course is in good
condition, and we will definitely be com
petitive."
A unique feature of the Desert Clas
sic is the fact that both men's and
women's teams compete in the tourna
ment. According to Goodwin, Stanford
and UCLA are the only schools with rep
resentatives of both teams competing.
"It's a fun tournament because the
women and men play together," Cevaer
said. "It's also a great course, with lots
of water. Since the conditions are so
good, we should shoot pretty low. A top
three finish would be great."
Since Stanford has finished third in
its first two tournaments, this would
seem to be a manageable goal. In fact,
life as a member of the golf team would
seem to be close to ideal right now. But
even the warm air of Palm Springs can
not completely free one's mind of its
worries. "I have a lot of work to do,"
Cevaer said."l brought my books."
Feel better now?
