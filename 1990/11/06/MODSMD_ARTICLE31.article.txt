# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
Athletic potential works itself out in
strange ways. Sometimes a team loaded with
talent just fails to deliver. Sometimes it sur
passes its supposed bounds.
This week's Athletes of the Week represent
teams who have suffered both of those fates.
Meanwhile, Jessica Benton of the No. 5
women's volleyball team and Ed McCaffrey
of the up-and-down football team have been

trashing anyone's doubts of their potential.
McCaffrey, a 6-foot-5, 215-pound wide
receiver, has without a doubt lived up to his
potential this season. The senior was ranked
the No. 4 receiver in the nation heading into
Saturday's contest with the Washington
State Cougars, and if he moves anywhere in
this week's rankings, it will probably be up.
Although he is used to catching passes in
the end zone, McCaffrey had his hands full
this weekend. Literally. Quarterback Jason
Palumbis kept his favorite split end busy, loft
ing a total of three touchdown tosses to him.
In addition, McCaffrey ran for another six.
One of those tosses led to 69 of McCaffrey's
176 total receiving yards and Stanford's first
six points. McCaffrey's streaking run and
catch gave the Cardinal a momentum it never
relented.

Benton is a 6-4 senior outside hitter who
has been on a spiking frenzy of late. While
opponents have had to spread their defenses
thin to deal with Stanford's Big Three hitters,
Bev Oden, Kristin Klein and Amy Cooper,
Benton has surprised them with her offensive
proliferation.
During her last five matches, the team co
captain has hit .393, raising her conference
hitting percentage to .305. Stanford now has
four players hitting over .300 in Pac-10 play,
almost unheard of in the NCAA.
Since her freshman year, Benton has
worked diligently with coach Don Shaw to

improve her playing ability, and now the
fruits of that labor are paying off big. While
she had reached double figures in kills only
once before this year, she has now struck for
10 or more kills in four of her last five match
es, including a career best 18 in the Cardinal's
comeback victory over No. 4 Pacific.
Benton has finally begun to approach her
potential.
