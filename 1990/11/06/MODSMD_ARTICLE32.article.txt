## 
### Deborah Claymon 
Despite light winds on the Bay,
Stanford sailors surged to the
front of the fleet this weekend,
taking their third victory of the
fall season. Twenty-nine boats
representing all of the West Coast
competition battled for the bullets
in the Stanford Invitational at
Redwood City. The Cardinal fin
ished first and second ahead of
UC-Irvine, which is currently
ranked tenth nationally.
With the end of racing on Sat
urday, Rick Rosen and Rebecca
Bryson were winning A division.
Brady Sih and Matt Dunbar shad
owed in second, tied with Irvine.
Also tied two points behind in
fourth and fifth, A 1 Sargeant and
Kristen Sidell, and Scott Sellers
and Andi Guerrero maintained
the Stanford lead.
Similarly, in B division, Dave
Dowd and Catherine Ivey sailed
strongly to first place, edging
ahead of Jeremy Mclntyre and
Geoff Mac Donald in second. Rusty
Lhamon and David James were
close in third, squeezing out
another Irvine team by one point.
In addition, Stanford rounded out
B division with Brett Adams and
Debi Claymon in fifth, and Matt
Sanford and Jen Yeh finishing

sixth.
Thinking about the team's per
formance on the first day, fresh
man Jeremy Mclntyre said, "Its
rather significant that only one
team besides Stanford managed to
crack the top five."
Although Stanford continued
its edge on the fleet on Sunday to
win, Irvine climbed ahead in A
division to first, passing Sih/Dun
bar in second. Sargeant/Sidell
moved up to third, keeping the top
California boat at a fourth place
finish. Rosenyßryson had a disap
pointing second set, slipping to a
fifth place finish. Sellers/Guerrero
followed behind in sixth. Despite
these changes, Stanford success
fully closed off opportunities for
other teams.
B division remained in the con
fident control of Dowd/Ivey. Both
Mclntyre/MacDonald and Irvine
sailed intensely, taking second and
third respectively. The last two
races of the set brought
Sanford/Yeh to a close fourth.
With the close of the regatta,
the combined effort of Sih and
Dowd took first, followed by
Rosen and Sanford just ahead of
Irvine. Sargeant and Mclntyre
finished fourth, and Sellers and
Lhamon placed fifth, passing Cal
ifornia in sixth.
