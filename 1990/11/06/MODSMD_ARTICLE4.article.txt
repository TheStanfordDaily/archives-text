# Jello lashes out at censorship

### Art Marcum 
"Christian supremacists" are backing the bulk
of all artistic censorship in the United States, said
Jello Biafra, former lead singer of The Dead
Kennedys. Speaking from personal experience
and with strong conviction on the issue of censor
ship, Biafra addressed a standing-room-only
crowd in Annenberg Auditorium last night.
Biafra and his now defunct punk rock band
were charged in 1985 with "distribution of harm
ful material to a minor" for reprinting a painting

by Swiss surrealist H.R. Giger on an album's
record sleeve. The case ended in a mistrial and all
charges were dropped.
In his speech, Biafra declared the trial "a black
comedy" and accused right-wing religious funda
mentalists of being behind the prosecution in
both his case and that of 2 Live Crew, a rap group
whose album was recently charged with being
legally obscene.
He said lobbying groups like the Parents'

Jello Blafra, former lead singer of the punk rock band The Dead Kennedys, discusses censorship
and other issues in a speech at Annenberg Auditorium last night.
Music Resource Center, which is
largely responsible for the
"explicit lyrics" warning stickers
used in many record stores, deny
any link to fundamentalist groups
but receive major funding from
them.
"The co-founder of the center,
Susan Baker, calls herself 'God's
instrument' and says she is here
to 'live out the gospel,'" Biafra
said. "She sits on the board of
'Focus on the Family,"' a funda
mentalist Christian group, Biafra
said.
"These people reduce and
water down art so it will not
offend the children and so they
won't ask 'Why is [North Car
olina Senator] Jesse Helms such
an asshole?"' he continued. ,
But in his speech, Biafra
stressed that censorship is not
limited to the realm of art and
music. "Jesse Helms is just the tip
of the iceberg," he warned. "The
real people to be afraid of are peo
ple like Bush and William Ben
nett and the ... Democrats who
claim to be a second party."
Biafra cited numerous exam
ples of the Reagan and Bush
administrations' silencing of
opposition, among them the case
of political activist Abbie Hoff
man, who reportedly committed
suicide in 1989.

Biafra said Hoffman was writ
ing a book about Reagan's pre
election dealings with Iran during
the hostage crisis of 1980 and said
he doubts Hoffman killed himself.
Biafra also assailed the U.S.
government for constantly lying
to the American people, citing
that the government-reported
casualties after the 1989 invasion
of Panama fell well below the
actual number of deaths.
In addition, he claimed the
public was not being informed
about aspects of the Kuwaiti gov
ernment, which he said "holds no
elections and allows no dissenting
press."
According to Biafra, the
United States also suffers from a
lack of dissenting press. The rea
son for this, he said, is that most
major media sources are con
trolled by corporations.
Consequently, the media is
reluctant or unable to report the
news accurately. For example, he
said, NBC is owned by General
Electric — one of the nation's
biggest weapons manufacturers.
Such conflicts of interest result
in "a watering down of the news,"
Biafra said.
Apart from a few "cool" news
sources like Mother Jones, Spin
and The Progressive, the media is
just a corporate tool, according to
Biafra.
Because of this, he said, the
duty to inform the American peo
ple rests on artists and musicians.
