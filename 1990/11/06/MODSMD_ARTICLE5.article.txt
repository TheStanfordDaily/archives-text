# Debaters tackle election
## 
### Kaarin Michaelsen Staff writer 
The Stanford Democrats and
the Stanford College Republicans
argued issues on today's ballot
during their annual pre-election
debate last night in Toyon Hall
lounge.
The gubernatorial race, Propo
sition 128 or "Big Green," Propo
sition 136 on tax increases and
Propositions 131 and 140 on cam
paign reform were topics of the
debate, which drew about 30 peo
ple.
Law Prof. Robert Weisberg
mediated the event. Juniors Kevin
Hartz and Scott Christopherson
spoke for the Democrats, and
senior Keith Rabois and junior
John Abbott represented the
Republicans.
Discussion about the hotly-con
tested race for governor between
Democrat Dianne Feinstein and
Republican Pete Wilson centered
around Weisberg's question,
"Who should be California's next
governor?"
In support of Feinstein, Hartz
cited the former San Francisco
mayor's commitment to fight
crime and her interest in educa
tional issues, especially her sup
port for Proposition 98, which
allocates 40 percent of the state
budget to schools.
"The choice is clear for Califor
nia," said Christopherson. "Pete
Wilson talks well, but it is essen
tial that voters look beyond the
rhetoric at his abominable record
on crime and other issues."
In response, Abbott praised
Wilson's effectiveness as mayor of
San Diego and as a U.S. Senator
and lauded his "common sense
approach to crime." According to
FBI statistics, San Francisco
became one of the country's 10
most dangerous cities under Fein
stein's leadership, he said.
Debaters also differed sharply
on the "Big Green" initiative,
which addresses California's envi
ronmental problems, including
the clear-cutting of forests, off
shore oil drilling and emissions of
chlorofluorocarbons.
While Christopherson strongly
supported the proposition, Abbott
criticized it as "having nothing to
do with the environment."
"It's based on misconceptions,
not on hard scientific facts and
really does nothing to help
improve our health, as it claims,"
he said.
Sponsored by Stanford-in-
Government, the debate was
intended to "make students more
aware of political issues outside of
Stanford that will affect them,"
said SIG chair David Levin.
