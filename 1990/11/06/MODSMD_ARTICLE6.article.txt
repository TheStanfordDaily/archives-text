## Four WSU fans arrested for football game fight 
### Howard Libit Staff writer 
Stanford Police arrested four
intoxicated Washington State fans
during Saturday's football game
after a fight in the alumni section.
The four were charged with a
variety of misdemeanors, includ
ing assault of a police officer,

resisting arrest and disturbing the
peace. One was aiso charged with
a felony count of assault of an offi
cer.
"They were unruly, boisterous
and very intoxicated," said Police
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
The four were among a group
who had come from Seaside,

Calif., to root for a high school
friend on the WSU football team.
All of them played football
together in high school, Niemeyer
said.
Police received a number of
complaints about the group and
made several unsuccessful
attempts to quiet them.
At 2 p.m., police arrested one
person who was "very loud and
obnoxious," said Niemeyer. "His
friends became upset and
attacked the officers."
Ten to 15 officers arrested and
removed the four fans. Police used
plastic cuffs on the fans' arms and
legs because they struggled to
escape as they were driven along
the stadium track on carts.

One person allegedly slammed
a gate against an officer, resulting
in the felony charge. Because all
four allegedly hit the officers, they
were charged with misdemeanor
counts of both assault of a police
officer and resisting arrest.
No one was seriously injured
during the fight, which occurred
in Section Q on the alumni side of
the Stadium.
Saturday's incident was the
second time this year that fighting
during a football game at Stanford
Stadium resulted in arrests. On
Sept. 29, one fan was arrested
during the game against San Jose
State University.
"The difference was that there
was not a mqjor fight after people
were arrested at the San Jose
State game," said Niemeyer. "At
[the Washington State] game, we
had a pretty big fight and it was
very difficult to take them away."
