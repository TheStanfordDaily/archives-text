sists of the Gymnastics Center
and Training Facility and the San

Diego Sports Hall. The center

opened earlier this year.
"The Ford Center will give us
by far the best gymnastics facility
in the United States," according

to Sadao Hamada, who has been
the men's gymnastics coach since
1972.
The center's San Diego Hall

ketball courts, three volleyball
courts and eight badminton
courts.
Howie Dallmar, director of the
intramural sports program, noted
that the new facility will reduce
pressure for space and time for
intramural sports.
"The Ford Center provides
much-needed space for gymnas
tics, eases pressure on our heavy
intramural program and offers
room for recreational activity,"
according to Acting Athletic
Director Alan Cummings.
As part of the dedication, a
sports festival took place Friday
night at the center. Stanford ath
letes from eight different sports
demonstrated their prowess to
guests, including most of the cen
ter's donors.
John Kates, director of
gifts for the Athletics Depart
ment, said there was "no better
way to dedicate the building
(than) to show what students will
be doing there."
Thomas Ford, a former mem
ber of the Board of Trustees, was
the mtyor donor for the $10 mil
lion structure.
Kates said the Ford Center was
definitely one of the "featured*
objectives" of the Centennial"
Campaign. He emphasized that
the Athletics Department raised
all the funds independently, with
no contributions from the Univer
sity's operating budget.
