# More budget woes lurking on horizon

Already in the midst of cutting $22 million from
its operating budget, Stanford appears to have more
fiscal woes ahead.
Several factors related to the University's
research activities are likely to create a revenue
shortfall of $3.7 million this year, according to
Robert Byer, dean of research.
In response to this projected shortfall and other
developments, Provost James Rosse said in a brief
interview yesterday that he will announce some new
"budgetary actions" at tomorrow afternoon's Fac
ulty Senate meeting.
Though unwilling to provide details, Rosse indi
cated that if any additional budget cuts were neces
sary, they would not be formally announced until
next week.
The bulk of the expected shortfall in research
related revenue, around $2.5 million, is the result of
much lower-than-expected research volume during
the last few months. As a result of the unusually
sluggish start, the University has adjusted its pro
jected research volume downward for the remainder
of the year.
When Stanford faculty conduct research, the fed
eral government reimburses Stanford for both the
cost of the research and the indirect costs associated
with the research. Indirect costs include such items
as operations and maintenance, use of the library by
researchers and various administrative expenses.
