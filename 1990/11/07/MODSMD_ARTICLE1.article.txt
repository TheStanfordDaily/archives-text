# More budget woes lurking on horizon
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
Already in the midst of cutting $22 million from
its operating budget, Stanford appears to have more
fiscal woes ahead.
Several factors related to the University's
research activities are likely to create a revenue
shortfall of $3.7 million this year, according to
Robert Byer, dean of research.
In response to this projected shortfall and other
developments, Provost James Rosse said in a brief
interview yesterday that he will announce some new
"budgetary actions" at tomorrow afternoon's Fac
ulty Senate meeting.
Though unwilling to provide details, Rosse indi
cated that if any additional budget cuts were neces
sary, they would not be formally announced until
next week.
The bulk of the expected shortfall in research
related revenue, around $2.5 million, is the result of
much lower-than-expected research volume during
the last few months. As a result of the unusually
sluggish start, the University has adjusted its pro
jected research volume downward for the remainder
of the year.
When Stanford faculty conduct research, the fed
eral government reimburses Stanford for both the
cost of the research and the indirect costs associated
with the research. Indirect costs include such items
as operations and maintenance, use of the library by
researchers and various administrative expenses.
When fewer federal dollars
than expected are spent on
research at Stanford, as has hap
pened this fall, a shortfall in indi
rect cost recovery results. Indi
rect cost recovery is the Univer
sity's second-largest source of

revenue after tuition.
But the decrease in research
volume is only part of the prob
lem.
Regardless of whether the cur
rent federal investigations of
Stanford's indirect cost policies
yield any evidence of wrongdoing,
the investigations themselves are
proving costly for Stanford.
The government has estab
lished a 74 percent provisional

indirect cost rate for Stanford for
the duration of the investigations.
Thus, researchers seeking a
$10,000 research grant must
request an additional $7,400 to
cover the indirect costs of their
research.
Stanford had proposed an indi
rect cost rate of 78 percent for
this year, and that figure was
incorporated into initial budget
ing decisions.
The four-point difference has a
substantial effect: $250,000 in
lost revenue each month, accord
ing to University Controller
Frank Riddle. The federal investi
gations are expected to take sev
eral months.
Consequently, the University
will experience a $1.2 million
shortfall because of the provi
sional rate, Byer said.
The investigations come at a
very difficult time for Stanford,
according to Rosse. "We have a
pretty thin capacity to absorb
shock this year," he said.

Byer attributed part of the
lower-than-expected research vol
ume in September to the pro
longed budget negotiations in
Congress. Because of uncertainty
about federal outlays for
research, many faculty delayed
proposals for federal research
grants until Bush approved the
budget, Byer said.
"We've had a slow start to this
year," he said.
However, Byer said he
expected to see an upturn in
research volume in October's fig
ures, which will be available next
week.
Research volume is "one of the
larger variables" in making bud
get projections, Byer said.
The University operating bud
get approved by the Board of
Trustees in April included $7.2
million in expense reductions.
The remainder of the $22 million
in cuts are scheduled to become
effective with the 1991-92 operat
ing budget.
