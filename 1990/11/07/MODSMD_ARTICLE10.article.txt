other crimes, and police are
currently in the process of
revoking his probation,
Niemeyer said.
Yesterday afternoon, the car

owner, a student, left Casa
Zapata and allegedly saw the
crime in progress. Knox ran
from the scene toward
Alvarado Row with the stereo
hidden under his shirt,
Niemeyer said.
The owner gave chase on
foot, but Knox was "a lot
faster" and moved quickly out
of sight, Niemeyer said.
A Stanford employee driv
ing in the area saw the student
chasing Knox and stopped to
ask how he could help,
Niemeyer said. The student
explained the situation and the

Knox and called the police.
