# Stanford employees offered new health program

Beginning next year, Stanford employees
will have access to a comprehensive health
care prevention program designed to enhance
the wellness of its members.
The Health Improvement Program is a
unique package based on clinical screening,
consultation and evaluation, according to pro
gram director Wes Alles.
The program will be underwritten almost
entirely for members of Health Net and Take
Care, the two health maintenance organiza
tions which jointly created the program. It will
be available to employees with other health
plans for $200.

Employees who join the program will
undergo a three-part testing â€” a physical
screening, a dietary assessment and a health
risk survey. These factors will then be ana
lyzed, and personal results from testing will be
interpreted for employees in a group setting.
Individuals can also request personal con
sultation. "We will bring people back on a one
to-one basis, and we will establish an action
plan for lifestyle changes with some measur
able goals," Alles said.
While many companies provide health
screenings for their employees, support
offered after screening is usually minimal,
Alles said. By contrast, follow-up is a vital part
of Stanford's new program, he explained.
Another unique facet of the program is that

it allows employees to have test results
directly sent to their personal doctors, said
Alles.
Health-conscious employees have been
quick to take advantage of the program.
"We've got about a hundred people already
signed up and the program won't begin
screening until January," Alles said.
While the new program applies only to fac
ulty and staff, Stanford students have access
to similar facilities, according to Patricia Fabi
ano, director of Cowell Student Health Cen
ter's health promotion program. Cowell pro
vides a number of health-enhancing programs
for students, including aerobics, alcohol
awareness, AIDS education and nutritional
counseling, she said.
