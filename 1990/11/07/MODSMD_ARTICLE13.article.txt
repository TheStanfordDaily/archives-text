Driving test leaves DMV office devastated
LOS ANGELES (AP) - A man taking a driving test crashed
into a Department of Motor Vehicles office yesterday. Dozens of
people scattered for safety as the car plowed 30 feet inside.
Only six minor injuries were reported but damage to the office
was extensive, authorities said.
"A 70-year-old man really flunked the driving test. He ran
right into the building," said police Officer Dennis Smith.
Two people were treated at the scene for minor injuries and
four were examined at a hospital.
The driver wasn't injured in the morning crash that caused an
estimated $40,000 damage to the office in suburban Canoga Park.
Saudi women seek license to drive
RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) — About 50 Saudi women, saying
the kingdom's ban on female drivers would leave them helpless in
the event of war, took to the streets for an unprecedented protest
yesterday — behind the wheel.
The women, many of them completely veiled except for their
eyes, piled into 15 cars and took a drive through the capital. For
them, it was a daring act of protest.
"This has nothing whatsoever to do with politics," one woman
explained. "If a crisis erupts, we must drive for the sake of our
families. We cannot stay immobile like sitting ducks."
All the women taking part in he protest were experienced
drivers, having learned the skill outside of Saudi Arabia.
But they were unfamiliar with their own cars. One woman
turned on her headlights and windshield wipers while trying to
roll down her electronic window to speak with a reporter.
She laughed good-naturedly: "I don't even know how to open
the window."
Most of the women had only ridden in the back seats of their
luxuiy sedans driven by foreign chaffeurs.
Thatcher moves up date for vote
LONDON (AP) — Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher yester
day moved forward the annual vote for her Conservative Party's
leadership, giving her foes only eight days to mount a challenge to
displace her as prime minister.
The sudden resignation Thursday of Deputy Prime Minister
Sir Geoffrey Howe underlined divisions within the governing
party and prompted speculation that a challenger might try to
oust Mrs. Thatcher in the annual party election.
The leader of the Conservatives — the party with the mcyority
in Parliament — automatically becomes prime minister. Under
party rules the leadership election could have been held as late as
Dec. 5 — four weeks after the opening of Parliament.
But Mrs. Thatcher yesterday approved Nov. 8 as the date of the
opening of nominations, Nov. 15 for the closing of nominations
and Nov. 20 as the election day, sharply reducing the time for a
challenge to be organized.
Last year, a challenge by Sir Anthony Meyer, who was thought
to have no real chance to win, was the first since Mrs. Thatcher
became party leader in 1975. Meyer won 30 votes to Mrs.
Thatcher's 314.
Mrs. Thatcher must call the next general election by mid-1992.
In Glasgow, Scotland, the Confederation of British Industry,
the main employers' organization, warned earlier yesterday that
the embattled government risked losing power through divisions
over Britain's role in Europe.
