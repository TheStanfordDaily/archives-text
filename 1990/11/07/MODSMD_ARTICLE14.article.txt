## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Postal Service deliv
ered about four-fifths of overnight mail on time in its
first test by an outside consultant, a performance the
postmaster general said yesterday earns the agency a
"low B."
Mail intended for overnight delivery arrived on
time 80.61 percent of the time during a three-month
test period that ended in mid-September, the
accounting firm of Price Waterhouse reported.
"About as low a B as you can get, that's how I
would characterize it," Postmaster General Anthony
Frank said following the monthly meeting of the ser
vice's board of governors.
While the national rating was just over 80 per
cent, performance varied widely from place to place,
with larger cities such as New York "dragging down"
the average.
Overnight delivery of mail destined for the Big
Apple was on time just 46.94 percent of the time, the
lowest share anywhere in the 50 states.
Top rated for overnight mail was Kansas City,
Mo., with 94.06 percent of overnight mail arriving
on time.
In addition to the performance figures, Frank
said that the postal rate increase scheduled for next
year, including a 30-cent stamp, is tentatively sched
uled for Feb. 3.
Price Waterhouse conducted the delivery test by
mailing 425,000 pieces of mail to 5,000 recipients in
286 ZIP codes across the country. The mail included
letters, post cards and large flat envelopes, some
with typed addresses and some hand written.
In addition to the 80.61 percent performance for
overnight mail, 74.38 percent of items intended for
second-day delivery arrived on time.
