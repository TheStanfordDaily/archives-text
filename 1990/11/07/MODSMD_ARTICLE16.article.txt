# Violence erupts in Israel after Kahane's assassination
## 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) — Supporters
of the slain Rabbi Meir Kahane
shouted "Death to the Arabs!" yester
day, and Israeli reports said police sus
pected a Jewish extremist already had
retaliated by killing two elderly Pales
tinians.
The day brought a second tragedy
for Kahane's wife, Libby, when her
father died after a long illness. Rabbi
Yacov Blum had been unconscious and
did not know of his son-in-law's death.
Police and army reinforcements
were deployed around Israel and in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to
prevent violence. But the increased
security came too late to save two
Palestinians killed at about 6 a.m. yes
terday, about two hours after Kahane
was slain in New York City.
Israeli police said they suspected an
Israeli radical killed the Palestinians
and that the slayings may have been
prompted by Kahane's murder, the
national Itim news agency reported.
Israel television said police received

warnings of death threats against
Israeli Arab members of Parliament
and Palestinian leaders in the occupied
territories.
Kahane was slain in New York Mon
day night by a gunman believed to be
of Arab descent. Israel army radio said
the man, identified by police as El
Sayed A. Noseir, 34, formerly lived in
the occupied terrritories.
Palestinians in Israel said the name
as given by police was not typical and
might be Said Nasser or Nasser el-
Said.
The 58-year-old Kahane, a former
member of Parliament and founder of
the right-wing Kach movement, advo
cated the expulsion of all Arabs from
Israeli-held territory.
The Israeli Foreign Ministry said
Kahane's assassination was "an
unprecedented assault on an Israeli
political figure on American soil" and
urged the United States to increase
security against terrorism.
State Department spokesman

Richard Boucher called the killing "a
despicable and cowardly act." Asked
about a possible vendetta by Kahane
supporters, he said: "We don't see this
as a time for revenge. Now is the time
for restraint."
U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar also decried Kahane's
killing and violence in the occupied ter
ritories. "He deplores these and all
acts of violence," said a spokeswoman,
Nadia Younes.
Several Israeli leaders linked
Kahane's murder to his controversial
views.
Faisal Hussein, a Palestine Libera
tion Organization supporter in
Jerusalem, appealed for calm, saying:
"Violence and calling for violence will
lead nowhere."
He said yesterday's killings in the
West Bank "raised concerns about the
security of our people."
At least two Israeli Arab members
of Parliament, Abdel Wahab Daroushe
and Mohammed Miari, left Jerusalem

for their homes in northern Israel for
fear of reprisals. Daroushe said police
told him of the threats.
Yesterday's Parliament session
began with a minute of silence for
Kahane, but only about 30 of the 120
lawmakers were present.
Kahane supporters warned of possi
ble revenge attacks.
Noam Federman, a Kahane
spokesman, declined to say if the Kach
movement was behind killings of the
two Palestinians yesterday. But he told
Israel television that "I don't rule out
that after the murder of Rabbi
Kahane, Jews will rise up and will
honor his memory ... and will attack
Arabs."
David Ben Dor, a Kach leader, told a
news conference at Kach's Jerusalem
headquarters that Kahane's ideas will
survive.
"Whoever thinks that today Rabbi
Kahane and the Kach movement have
been destroyed has made a great mis
take," Ben Dor said.
