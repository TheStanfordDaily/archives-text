# Democrats dominate key elections
## 
### 
Democrats wrested governor
ships from the GOP in Texas,
Florida and four other states yes
terday in midterm elections that
sealed a season of Republican dis
appointment. Democrats also
expanded their dominion of
Congress in returns that heavily
favored the incumbents.
North Carolina GOP Sen. Jesse
Helms won re-election in the most
closely watched Senate race of 34
on the ballot.
Upsets were few and far
between, despite stirrings of voter
discontent. House Republican
Whip Newt Gingrich was in a
Georgia deadlock and Democratic
Sen. Bill Bradley was pressed
before winning a dramatic rejec
tion in New Jersey.
Democrats elected Ann
Richards as governor of Texas and
Lawton Chiles in Florida, giving
them the last word in redistricting
that will add House seats to both
Sunbelt states for the next decade.
Republicans looked to Pete Wil
son to hold the California govern
ship in his race against Dianne
Feinstein.
Democrats easily renewed their
mcyority in the Senate, and in the
House as well, where they aimed
to improve their 259-176 majority.
The GOP got good news in
Ohio, where George Voinovich
won a Democratic governorship,
and in Connecticut where Gary
Franks became the first black
House Republican since 1935.
Sen. Lowell Weicker vexed the
GOP again, this time as an out
sider, with an independent victory
for governor of Connecticut.
Republican Gov. Kay Orr was
trailing, barely, in Nebraska.
Vermont sent Socialist Bernie
Sanders to the House — in place
of a Republican. But former GOP
Gov. Richard Snelling won his old
job back, and with it, the state
house for his party.
Hours after the polls closed,
there was no shortage of close
statehouse races:
— John Engler led Democratic
Gov. James Blanchard in a Michi
gan surprise.
— Republican William Weld
moved to a small lead over John
Silber as Massachusetts picked a
successor to Michael Duksdus.
— GOP Gov. John McKernan
clung to a lead over former Gov.
Joseph Brennan in Maine.

— Illinois GOP Secretary of
State Jim Edgar led Neil Hartigan
narrowly in Illinois.
— Democrat Rudy Perpich
trailed Arne Carlson in a tough
Minnesota race marked by Repub
lican turmoil. Carlson was on the
ballot only because Jon Grunseth
dropped out in late October over
allegations of sexual impropri
eties.
Helms bested Harvey Gantt in
his marquee race for reelection in
a contest that pitted one of the
nation's best known conservatives
against a former black mayor.
"I'm sorry I'm so late," he told
supporters, "but I've been home
watching the grieving face of Dan
Rather ... the liberal politicians
and editors and commentators

and columnists have struck out
again."
Democrats took aim at Rudy
Boschwitz in Minnesota in hopes
of padding their current 55-45
majority. Paul Wellstone held a
small lead.
Appointed Democratic Sen.
Dan Akaka won re-election in
Hawaii, dashing Republican hopes
of a takeover.
Bob Smith in New Hampshire,
Hank Brown in Colorado and
Larry Craig held open Senate
seats for the GOP
Alabama GOP Gov. Guy Hunt
won a close race for re-election.
The polls were still open in half
the nation when the Democrats
proclaimed victory and pointed
the voters toward the 1992 presi

dential race. "I couldn't feel bet
ter," said Ron Brown, chairman of
the Democratic National Commit
tee. "Both Republicans and
Democrats ran against George
Bush."
Spokesman Charles Black put
the best face forward for the
Republican National Committee,
telling reporters, "It appears to be
more of an anti-incumbent trend
than a partisan trend." He called
the midterm results "an anti-
Congress trend rather than an
anti-president trend," even
though incumbent members were
being reelected at a substantial
rate.
More than 6,100 legislative
races crowded the ballots, and vot
ers in 43 states and the District of
Columbia decided ballot issues.
Massachusetts rejected a pro
posed tax rollback.
New York Gov. Mario Cuomo
won in a possible prelude to a
1992 Democratic presidential
campaign. Besides Bill Bradley,
two other potential challengers to
President Bush won easy Senate
reelection — A 1 Gore in Ten
nessee, Sam Nunn in Georgia.
Bush voted in his home state of
Texas after an energetic yet awk
ward campaign for GOP candi
dates, then returned to the White
House to read the returns. Bush
sparked a Republican rebellion
when he broke his memorable
1988 campaign pledge and
embraced an October deficit
reduction plan that raised tax
rates.
The GOP losses in Texas and
Florida were stinging defeats for
President Bush, who visited
Florida three times to stump for
Martinez and spent the last three
days of the campaign in his adop
tive home state of Texas cam
paigning for Williams.
Democrats were quick to point
to the results as spelling political
trouble for the president.
Democrat David Walters
grabbed the open Republican gov
ernorship in Oklahoma. Bruce
Sundlun wrested the governor
ship from Republicans in hard
times Rhode Island, ousting
Edward DiPrete. Former Gov.
Bruce King's successful comeback
returned New Mexico to the
Democratic column, and Joan
Finney ousted GOP Gov. Mike
Hayden in Kansas.

reelection — A 1 Gore in Ten
nessee, Sam Nunn in Georgia.
Bush voted in his home state of
Texas after an energetic yet awk
ward campaign for GOP candi
dates, then returned to the White
House to read the returns. Bush
sparked a Republican rebellion
when he broke his memorable
1988 campaign pledge and
embraced an October deficit
reduction plan that raised tax
rates.
The GOP losses in Texas and
Florida were stinging defeats for
President Bush, who visited
Florida three times to stump for
Martinez and spent the last three
days of the campaign in his adop
tive home state of Texas cam
paigning for Williams.
Democrats were quick to point
to the results as spelling political
trouble for the president.
Democrat David Walters
grabbed the open Republican gov
ernorship in Oklahoma. Bruce
Sundlun wrested the governor
ship from Republicans in hard
times Rhode Island, ousting
Edward DiPrete. Former Gov.
Bruce King's successful comeback
returned New Mexico to the
Democratic column, and Joan
Finney ousted GOP Gov. Mike
Hayden in Kansas.

Mass.
Democrats wrested governor
ships from the GOP in Texas,
Florida and four other states yes
terday in midterm elections that
sealed a season of Republican dis
appointment. Democrats also
expanded their dominion of
Congress in returns that heavily
favored the incumbents.
North Carolina GOP Sen. Jesse
Helms won re-election in the most
closely watched Senate race of 34
on the ballot.
Upsets were few and far
between, despite stirrings of voter
discontent. House Republican
Whip Newt Gingrich was in a
Georgia deadlock and Democratic
Sen. Bill Bradley was pressed
before winning a dramatic rejec
tion in New Jersey.
Democrats elected Ann
Richards as governor of Texas and
Lawton Chiles in Florida, giving
them the last word in redistricting
that will add House seats to both
Sunbelt states for the next decade.
Republicans looked to Pete Wil
son to hold the California govern
ship in his race against Dianne
Feinstein.
Democrats easily renewed their
mcyority in the Senate, and in the
House as well, where they aimed
to improve their 259-176 majority.
The GOP got good news in
Ohio, where George Voinovich
won a Democratic governorship,
and in Connecticut where Gary
Franks became the first black
House Republican since 1935.
Sen. Lowell Weicker vexed the
GOP again, this time as an out
sider, with an independent victory
for governor of Connecticut.
Republican Gov. Kay Orr was
trailing, barely, in Nebraska.
Vermont sent Socialist Bernie
Sanders to the House — in place
of a Republican. But former GOP
Gov. Richard Snelling won his old
job back, and with it, the state
house for his party.
Hours after the polls closed,
there was no shortage of close
statehouse races:
— John Engler led Democratic
Gov. James Blanchard in a Michi
gan surprise.
— Republican William Weld
moved to a small lead over John
Silber as Massachusetts picked a
successor to Michael Duksdus.
— GOP Gov. John McKernan
clung to a lead over former Gov.
Joseph Brennan in Maine.

— Illinois GOP Secretary of
State Jim Edgar led Neil Hartigan
narrowly in Illinois.
— Democrat Rudy Perpich
trailed Arne Carlson in a tough
Minnesota race marked by Repub
lican turmoil. Carlson was on the
ballot only because Jon Grunseth
dropped out in late October over
allegations of sexual impropri
eties.
Helms bested Harvey Gantt in
his marquee race for reelection in
a contest that pitted one of the
nation's best known conservatives
against a former black mayor.
"I'm sorry I'm so late," he told
supporters, "but I've been home
watching the grieving face of Dan
Rather ... the liberal politicians
and editors and commentators

and columnists have struck out
again."
Democrats took aim at Rudy
Boschwitz in Minnesota in hopes
of padding their current 55-45
majority. Paul Wellstone held a
small lead.
Appointed Democratic Sen.
Dan Akaka won re-election in
Hawaii, dashing Republican hopes
of a takeover.
Bob Smith in New Hampshire,
Hank Brown in Colorado and
Larry Craig held open Senate
seats for the GOP
Alabama GOP Gov. Guy Hunt
won a close race for re-election.
The polls were still open in half
the nation when the Democrats
proclaimed victory and pointed
the voters toward the 1992 presi

dential race. "I couldn't feel bet
ter," said Ron Brown, chairman of
the Democratic National Commit
tee. "Both Republicans and
Democrats ran against George
Bush."
Spokesman Charles Black put
the best face forward for the
Republican National Committee,
telling reporters, "It appears to be
more of an anti-incumbent trend
than a partisan trend." He called
the midterm results "an anti-
Congress trend rather than an
anti-president trend," even
though incumbent members were
being reelected at a substantial
rate.
More than 6,100 legislative
races crowded the ballots, and vot
ers in 43 states and the District of
Columbia decided ballot issues.
Massachusetts rejected a pro
posed tax rollback.
New York Gov. Mario Cuomo
won in a possible prelude to a
1992 Democratic presidential
campaign. Besides Bill Bradley,
two other potential challengers to
President Bush won easy Senate
reelection — A 1 Gore in Ten
nessee, Sam Nunn in Georgia.
