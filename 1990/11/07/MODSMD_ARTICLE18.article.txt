BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) â€” Bishop
Cahal B. Daly, a fierce critic of the IRA and other
guerrilla groups, was appointed Roman Catholic pri
mate of Ireland yesterday and said he will continue
his outspoken campaign for peace in his native
Northern Ireland.
Pope John Paul II named Daly as spiritual leader
of 3.7 million Catholics in Ireland and Northern Ire
land. Daly succeeds Tomas O Fiaich, who died in
May, as the archbishop of Armagh and primate of
All-Ireland.
"My continuing concern will obviously be to work
for an end to the violence which has afflicted both
our communities for two disastrous decades," Daly
told a news conference shortly after the announce
ment.
"Refusing to give in to discouragement or to
despair, we must continue to believe in peace, to pray
for peace, to speak peace, to make peace, by being
ourselves men and women of peace."
As the voice of the Catholic church in Belfast, as
bishop of Down and Connor, Daly has been a vigor
ous advocate for the Catholic minority in the North
but a foe of the Irish Republican Army.
The IRA, Daly said two years ago, "is a question
of sheer evil and we have got to face that evil and
have no truck with it."
Supporters of the IRA, which is rooted in the
Catholic community, regard Daly as an apologist for
British rule. The IRA is waging a guerrilla war to
drive the British from Protestant-dominated North
ern Ireland and merge the province with the Irish
Republic.
Ireland's Anglican primate, Robin Eames, said he
had the highest respect for Daly's "intellectual gifts,
his courage and integrity."
Peter Brooke, the highest-ranking British official
in Northern Ireland, said Daly was respected for "his
resolute condemnation of violence, his concern for
individual well-being and his longstanding efforts to
bring about reconciliation."
At 73, Daly is the oldest prelate appointed to the
Armagh post in 170 years. He must submit his resig
nation when he turns 75, the normal retirement age
for bishop, although the pope need not accept it
immediately.
He is the 114 th successor to St. Patrick. Daly's
last six predecessors were made cardinals.
Daly enthusiastically joined in ecumenical ven
tures with Anglican and Presbyterian leaders in
Northern Ireland, but he also vigorously defended
Catholic schools against those who criticized them as
perpetuating old divisions.
He was a defender of faith in a land where reli
gions often are badges of lethal political differences.
In his "Letter to a Northern Protestant,'*
published in 1979, Daly wrote:
"Irish Catholics and Irish Protestants can and
must help one another to stay faithful to Christ in a
world where more and more people walk away from
Him. In that world, it is imbecilic to suppose that
Protestantism would gain through Catholicism's
loss, or vice versa ... only post-Christian secularism
and materialism will flourish if either of our faith
communities declines."
