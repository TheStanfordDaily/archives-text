# Oregon AD asks Band to stay home next year
## 
### Morgan Slain Staff writer 
The University of Oregon has asked the Stanford
Department of Athletics to leave the Stanford Band
at home next year when the Cardinal meets the Ore
gon Ducks in Autzen Stadium.
Oregon Athletic Director Bill Byrne made the
request in a Nov. 2 letter to Acting Athletics Director
Alan Cummings. Cummings had suspended the
Band October 29 for one game in response to a con
troversial half-time show in Eugene parodying Ore
gon's spotted owl debate.
In his letter, Byrne described the performance as
"insensitive" and lacking "understanding of the
social and economic climate in Oregon."
"Apparently the young people in the Band do not
understand that losing anywhere from 20,000 to
40,000 jobs in the western part of Oregon is
extremely traumatic for the people here," Byrne
wrote. The spotted owl is an endangered species and
efforts to maintain its habitat may lead to
widespread layoffs in Oregon's timber industry.
Cummings was noncommittal yesterday about
how he would respond to the request. "We'll talk
about that at a later date," he said. "That's not any
thing I'm focusing on right now."
But complying with the request may not be diffi
cult. Band member Jesse Dorogusker, a sophomre,
said the Band does not usually travel to Oregon for
football games.
Normally, the Band's budget permits only two
away-game shows, and "usually we go to UCLA or
USC," Dorogusker said. Before
this year, the last time the Band
played at Oregon was in 1973, he
said.
Byrne opened his letter to
Cummings with a report on dam
ages to Autzen Stadium that Ore
gon officials blame on the Band.
The damages, costing $113,
include two 4-foot black paint
rings and a 12-inch pool of spilled
enamel paint on the field's artifi
cial turf.
Byrne also wrote that the Band
placed tape on three large Pacific
-10 Conference school signs in the
stadium in order to cover the
names of UC-Berkeley, UCLA and
USC. According to Byrne, Oregon
maintenance crews spent three
hours removing the tape
Band Public Relations director

Ben Myers, a junior, said last
night the Band admits responsi
bility for some stadium damage.
An "internal investigation" dis
covered that "a few individual
members acting on their own
accord" had placed one strip of
duct tape over the Berkeley sign
and a few pieces over the USC
sign, he said.
Myers said the Band is willing
to pay Oregon for these damages.
"It's the proper thing to do," he
said, adding that the responsible
members had been rebuked.
But no one in the Band taped
over the UCLA sign or spilled
paint, Myers said. He claimed
painting the props used in the
performance could not have left
rings like those Byrne described
in his letter. Also, because the
Band does not use enamel paint,
it could not have caused the 12-
inch pool of paint on the field,
Myers said.

Byrne's letter shifted to a more
emotional tone as he explained
reaction in Eugene to the Band's
parody
"Alan, in my years as athletic
director at Oregon I do not recall
having a visiting team band booed
off the field the way the Stanford
Band was booed here," Byrne
wrote. "Folks are hurting up here,
and the Stanford Band's attempt
at humor was not well-received."
Byrne's request to keep the
band out of Eugene came in the
letter's final sentence. "Alan,
except for the Grateful Dead, I've
not had as many comments about
a band's performance, and it's my
request that next year when
Stanford comes to Eugene you'll
leave the band at home," he
wrote.
In a statement released last
night, the Band announced that
its concepts and formations for

the Nov. 17 Big Game in UC-
Berkeley's Memorial Stadium
had been approved by Stanford's
Athletics Department.
