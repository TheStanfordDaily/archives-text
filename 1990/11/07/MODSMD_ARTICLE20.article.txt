## Could Peter be you? 
### 
Doing well in school and
your own affairs doesn't
make you a real success

This is the story of
Peter. Peter was born. He
grew up and went to school.
He got good grades and good SAT
scores. Peter applied to Stanford.
He got in. He was happy. He came.
He saw. He conquered.
Life for Peter at Stanford has
been good. The weather is nice.
The campus is good-looking. The
students can drop classes 24 hours
before the final, and failing grades
just don't exist.
Peter's well informed. He picks
up a newspaper every day.
He brushes past those lead sto
ries and the opinions letters and
goes straight to the crossword puz
zle. Once in awhile, he looks for the
pizza coupons.
Peter's an intellectual.
He doesn't waste time talking
about politics and issues over din
ner or in the hallways late at night.
Problem sets and papers are wait
ing for him at the library.
An "A" will mean more to him in
10 years than debating the posi
tioning of American troops in
Saudi Arabia.
Peter's smarter than most peo
ple. He sees the radicals and the
reactionaries and just laughs. He
won't have any part in their foolish
antics or disillusionment. He
knows that there's no use in even
listening to them as he rides past
their rallies in White Plaza.
Peter budgets his time well.
Good grades come first, then party
ing, then physical activity when
there's extra time.
Extracurricular activities are

only important if they look good on
a resume. Going to hear speakers
or reading about current events
doesn't really figure into the equa
tion.
Peter understands the use of an
adviser. At first, he thought that
they were boring people who tried
to talk about big subjects and
signed his study lists. Now, he
knows they're a valuable source of
letters of recommendation.
Peter can focus. He knows that
leaving the door to his room open
just invites trouble and procrasti
nation.
Who knows? Someone may wan
der in, sit down, and talk for awhile
about abortion, or racial conflict or
even the prices at the Coffee
House.
Peter has timing. Peter doesn't
talk about things that aren't
important at the moment.
He waits for the crisis, for
events to become really important.
He'll wait for the draft to roll
around to his number before he
asks his government why there's
hundreds of thousands of troops in
a foreign country, readying for war.
Peter can keep to a schedule. He
knows when and when not to be
intellectual and informed. His
brain pretty much switches on at 9
and off at 5.
In section he puts on the after
burners, because he knows the
teaching assistant grades the
papers. He doesn't waste valuable
brainpower on anything else.
Peter will be a graduate from a
prestigious university, and as such
will be valued by the outside world
as a dynamic and creative problem
solver.
He will go off to save the world
... if there's a good reason and
some spare time.
Perhaps there's a little bit of
Peter in all of us.
