The Athletics Department is the real cause of our embarrassment

NO DOUBT ABOUT IT - THE
University has been thoroughly
embarrassed.
Not by the Stanford Band, however.
Their show, as summarized by far too
many press clippings, was an even
handed and witty satire on the ridiculous
situation brought about by the spotted
owl.
And even if their show had been in
poor taste, only a few thousand people in
Eugene would have known about it.
What actually has me embarrassed is
the fact that Stanford has humiliated
itself in front of millions of people
through its heavy-handed response to
the Band.
What do you think the average person
thought when he or she first read or
heard the story of how a prestigious
research university suspended its march
ing band for this alleged crime?
I'll tell you what he or she thought:
"That school must be run by a bunch of
fuddy-duddy, censorious dolts." Perhaps
some didn't use such haughty language,
of course, but the gist is the same.

The people we have to thank for this
"killing a tsetse fly with an atom
smasher" approach are the usual gaggle
of idiots who run the Stanford Depart
ment of Athletics.
Looking for a way to top last year's
highlights (which included a $1 million
dollar deficit, the extermination of four
varsity sports teams, the surprise move
ment of the student section to an
abysmal slice of the stadium and the cre
ation of an unpopular and inept "yell
leader" squad), they decided that it
would be a fine idea to drag the school's
dirty laundry into the public eye.
At the center of this stupidity is Act
ing Athletic Director Alan Cummings,
who claimed in last Wednesday's Daily
that reviewing the Band's shows and
maintaining a veto power over them is a
"partnership, not censorship."
Doesn't this seem awfully similar to
Saddam Hussein's claim that the people
he won't let out of Iraq are "guests, not
hostages"?
Would it be all that amazing to dis
cover that the reason that recent Band

shows have been "tepid" (to quote
Kathryn Kershner's letter in Friday's
Daily) is because they're subject to cen
sorship by a man who thinks formations
like "OWL" to "AWOL" are so unpardon
able that they warrant suspension?
At any rate, the Athletics Department
got their press release out last Tuesday
afternoon and proclaimed to the world
that they had done this wonderful thing
— that they had suspended the "insensi
tive" Band. And what did the world do?
It laughed. It chuckled. It gaped in
amazement at a major university being
so petty.
The San Jose Mercury News snidely
quipped that the Band members "tried
to lampoon a controversy that appar
ently is too controversial to lampoon."
Jon Carroll, columnist for the San
Francisco Chronicle, wrote "someone
complained, and administrators huddled,
and now the band cannot perform....
Nothing like standing by your students
when the heat's on."
A Band member told me yesterday
that CNN and other media outlets were

expected to arrive on campus in the next
few days to cover the story. Isn't this
wonderful — what was once a difference
of opinion over a half-time show is now
to become a national, perhaps interna
tional, humiliation of our school.
So what shall we do? There is really
one clear option.
The Athletics Department itself
should be indefinitely suspended.
Over the course of the last few years,
we've seen them bungle, trip up and dis
grace our school.
Now they've proven to the country
that our school can't take a joke, that it
has no room for a free exchange of ideas
and that it is more than willing to silence
its own students (especially those who
have put in many hours and miles in
support of their athletic teams).
The department is the group that
should be prohibited from operating
until it can prove to the University com
munity that it can behave like intelli
gent, open-minded adults.

New distribution requirements will help us understand difference

WE WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS
our support for the distribution
requirement proposal currently
under evaluation by the Faculty Senate.
The existing requirements are loosely
based on the traditional academic disci
plines and range from fine arts to
applied sciences and technology.
Missing, however from this current
roster, is exposure to a reality that every
individual living in our world today will
have to deal with: difference.
There is no denying that the world we
live in is diverse and that increasing
"interconnectedness" means that we
interact more and more.
In this context, it is important that
educated individuals have the framework

on which to build an understanding of
those who are different from themselves.
The proposed revisions would take the
first step in ensuring that individuals
graduating from Stanford University
would possess such frameworks. The
proposal contains three parts.
Because international interactions are
increasingly common in our world, it is
important that educated individuals
begin to understand how radically differ
ent cultures outside the West are.
Only when we study societies differ
ent from our own can we really under
stand our own society. The faculty recog
nized this with the non-Western culture
requirement. The current proposal
strengthens this requirement, further

emphasizing its importance.
The second part of the proposal adds
an American Cultures requirement.
Studying difference within the context of
one society is quite different from study
ing it between societies.
The proposal recognizes the necessity
of understanding the many cultures
within our own country which requires
in part that we learn the history of
oppression in the United States.
The final addition is that of a gender
studies requirement. Every single indi
vidual must interact everyday with mem
bers of the other gender. This require
ment will challenge students to examine
critically gender roles and the conse
quences they have for both men and

women.
All three proposed requirements pre
sent issues that all individuals will con
front in their everyday lives, before and
after graduation. The requirements help
to fill the gaps in required kindergarten
-12 education which nas traditionally
neglected the experience of women and
people of non-white race and ethnicity.
The requirements will improve the
education Stanford provides to its under
graduates. As our world changes, so
must the system by which we educate
change to reflect the new developments.

Not by the Stanford Band, however.
Their show, as summarized by far too
many press clippings, was an even
handed and witty satire on the ridiculous
situation brought about by the spotted
owl.
And even if their show had been in
poor taste, only a few thousand people in
Eugene would have known about it.
What actually has me embarrassed is
the fact that Stanford has humiliated
itself in front of millions of people
through its heavy-handed response to
the Band.
What do you think the average person
thought when he or she first read or
heard the story of how a prestigious
research university suspended its march
ing band for this alleged crime?
I'll tell you what he or she thought:
"That school must be run by a bunch of
fuddy-duddy, censorious dolts." Perhaps
some didn't use such haughty language,
of course, but the gist is the same.

The people we have to thank for this
"killing a tsetse fly with an atom
smasher" approach are the usual gaggle
of idiots who run the Stanford Depart
ment of Athletics.
Looking for a way to top last year's
highlights (which included a $1 million
dollar deficit, the extermination of four
varsity sports teams, the surprise move
ment of the student section to an
abysmal slice of the stadium and the cre
ation of an unpopular and inept "yell
leader" squad), they decided that it
would be a fine idea to drag the school's
dirty laundry into the public eye.
At the center of this stupidity is Act
ing Athletic Director Alan Cummings,
who claimed in last Wednesday's Daily
that reviewing the Band's shows and
maintaining a veto power over them is a
"partnership, not censorship."
Doesn't this seem awfully similar to
Saddam Hussein's claim that the people
he won't let out of Iraq are "guests, not
hostages"?
Would it be all that amazing to dis
cover that the reason that recent Band

shows have been "tepid" (to quote
Kathryn Kershner's letter in Friday's
Daily) is because they're subject to cen
sorship by a man who thinks formations
like "OWL" to "AWOL" are so unpardon
able that they warrant suspension?
At any rate, the Athletics Department
got their press release out last Tuesday
afternoon and proclaimed to the world
that they had done this wonderful thing
— that they had suspended the "insensi
tive" Band. And what did the world do?
It laughed. It chuckled. It gaped in
amazement at a major university being
so petty.
The San Jose Mercury News snidely
quipped that the Band members "tried
to lampoon a controversy that appar
ently is too controversial to lampoon."
Jon Carroll, columnist for the San
Francisco Chronicle, wrote "someone
complained, and administrators huddled,
and now the band cannot perform....
Nothing like standing by your students
when the heat's on."
A Band member told me yesterday
that CNN and other media outlets were

expected to arrive on campus in the next
few days to cover the story. Isn't this
wonderful — what was once a difference
of opinion over a half-time show is now
to become a national, perhaps interna
tional, humiliation of our school.
So what shall we do? There is really
one clear option.
The Athletics Department itself
should be indefinitely suspended.
Over the course of the last few years,
we've seen them bungle, trip up and dis
grace our school.
Now they've proven to the country
that our school can't take a joke, that it
has no room for a free exchange of ideas
and that it is more than willing to silence
its own students (especially those who
have put in many hours and miles in
support of their athletic teams).
The department is the group that
should be prohibited from operating
until it can prove to the University com
munity that it can behave like intelli
gent, open-minded adults.

New distribution requirements will help us understand difference

WE WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS
our support for the distribution
requirement proposal currently
under evaluation by the Faculty Senate.
The existing requirements are loosely
based on the traditional academic disci
plines and range from fine arts to
applied sciences and technology.
Missing, however from this current
roster, is exposure to a reality that every
individual living in our world today will
have to deal with: difference.
There is no denying that the world we
live in is diverse and that increasing
"interconnectedness" means that we
interact more and more.
In this context, it is important that
educated individuals have the framework

on which to build an understanding of
those who are different from themselves.
The proposed revisions would take the
first step in ensuring that individuals
graduating from Stanford University
would possess such frameworks. The
proposal contains three parts.
Because international interactions are
increasingly common in our world, it is
important that educated individuals
begin to understand how radically differ
ent cultures outside the West are.
Only when we study societies differ
ent from our own can we really under
stand our own society. The faculty recog
nized this with the non-Western culture
requirement. The current proposal
strengthens this requirement, further

emphasizing its importance.
The second part of the proposal adds
an American Cultures requirement.
Studying difference within the context of
one society is quite different from study
ing it between societies.
The proposal recognizes the necessity
of understanding the many cultures
within our own country which requires
in part that we learn the history of
oppression in the United States.
The final addition is that of a gender
studies requirement. Every single indi
vidual must interact everyday with mem
bers of the other gender. This require
ment will challenge students to examine
critically gender roles and the conse
quences they have for both men and

women.
All three proposed requirements pre
sent issues that all individuals will con
front in their everyday lives, before and
after graduation. The requirements help
to fill the gaps in required kindergarten
-12 education which nas traditionally
neglected the experience of women and
people of non-white race and ethnicity.
The requirements will improve the
education Stanford provides to its under
graduates. As our world changes, so
must the system by which we educate
change to reflect the new developments.
