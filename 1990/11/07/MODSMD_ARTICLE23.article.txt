## A 						moral pause before war 
### 
PRESIDENT BUSH ESCALATED
rhetorical support for a military
resolution of the Gulf crisis this
week.
Yet key players counseled moderation.
General Norman Schwarzkopf, comman
der of U.S. forces in the Gulf, and Senator
Sam Nunn, chair of the Armed Services
Committee, urged that other options be
exhausted before a costly war is under
taken.
Noting the tendency to think in terms
of the last war, Nunn cautioned that a
war with Iraq would be far more devastat
ing than the quick, decisive operations
against Grenada, Libya and Panama.
While he is right, there is one parallel
to Libya and Panama: at the time of the
United States attacks against them, each
was led by a repressive dictator whose
potential elimination seemed likely to
promise a desirable reversal in the offend
ing policy.
The Reagan Administration was
unable to be explicit about its aim to kill
Khaddafi given the U.S. law prohibiting
assassination. So it undertook a broader
attack that would make his death appear
part of the indirect damage.
As for the Panama invasion, Bush
made no secret of the fact that it
amounted to a massive manhunt for Gen
eral Noriega, but avoided the issue of
assassination by limiting the goal to cap
ture and extradition.
The intermediate option of removing
Hussein without war has received little
attention as a result not only of the pro
scription against assassination, but also
of the confounding of two distinct objec

tives in the national debate.
The overarching objective that unites
the United Nations coalition is to roll
back the aggression against Kuwait.
However, Les Aspin, chair of the House
Armed Services Committee, and colum
nist William Safire, among others, regard
even the status quo ante as unacceptable
and promote another objective: to depose
Hussein.
Failure to distinguish between these
objectives would not be a problem if both
implied the same strategy. But they do
not. Ignoring this, Safire has used Hus
sein's allegedly imminent possession of a
nuclear device to build the case for a U.S.
invasion.
Yet Panama illustrated that invasions
are a tragically blunt instrument for
removing individual leaders; the high
number of civilian casualties there vio
lated a reasonable proportionality stan
dard.
But at least the Panama operation suc
ceeded in apprehending its target,
whereas an invasion of Kuwaiti territory
might well leave Hussein ensconced as
Iraq's embattled but defiant dictator. If
he could weather the cession to Iran of
territory acquired at the cost of half a mil
lion Iraqi lives, he might well withstand
the forcible loss of Kuwait.
If the objective is to remove Hussein, it
might better be served by more precise
instruments: abetting a coup d'6tat (CIA
efforts are presumably underway) or even
employing commando squads to capture
him. If both an invasion of Kuwait and
thefce more precise options are elimi
nated, the most likely remaining alterna

tive is the invasion and bombing of Iraq
itself.
Given Iraq's defensive entrenchment
in Kuwait, this might reduce American
casualties, but it would also entail a large
number of civilian Iraqi casualties. Air
Force Chief of Staff Michael Dugan was
sacked in September for revealing the
high profile of precisely this contingency.
If we as a nation will not countenance
U.S. involvement in assassination plots,
as I think we should not, then why should
we be any more ready to support an inva
sion that kills innocent civilians (and for
that matter conscripted soldiers) who are
themselves tyrannized by an aggressive
dictator. Such moral relativism creates
unease, but does raise important ques
tions as our nation moves toward war.
If, as Safire contends, Hussein is about
to launch nuclear war, then rolling back
the aggression in Kuwait is a secondary
concern. If he is not, then Safire's
prophecy of doom should not distort our
reasoning on so important a decision as if
and when a massive invasion, with all its
morally troubling consequences, should
be launched.
