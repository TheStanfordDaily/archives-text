# From the Editor
## Brad Hayward There's more to 'sensationalistic' photo than meets the eye 
### 
A FEW WEEKS AGO on the opin
ions page, I wrote that The Daily
would be making greater efforts
during Volume 198 to explain to the Stan
ford community the "how" and "why" of
thepaper's work.
That goal emerged from my belief that
American newspapers, including The
Daily in some instances, have been far too
reluctant to discuss the assumptions and
internal decision-making processes that
shape the presentation of the news our
readers see each morning.
This week presents a good opportunity
to engage in some of that needed discus
sion.
Two particular issues — the publica
tion of a front-page photo showing two
men kissing and The Daily's absence
from last weekend's Leadership Summit
— have created some amount of concern
and confusion in the community.
I'll address each of these issues in an
attempt to more fully discuss what I
believe to be The Daily's role on this cam
pus.

The photo in Monday's Daily showing
two men kissing at last week's "Full
Moon in the Quad" event clearly gener
ated a great deal of discussion among our
readers.
A sampling of some of the responses
we have received:
• In a letter to the editor, an anony
mous writer stated, "In the future, The
Daily should use foresight when consider
ing publishing controversial pictures; this
includes accompanying them with an

appropriate article and ensuring that
members of the Stanford community will
not be offended."
• From the same letter: "I am out
raged! The fact that the picture is in front
of Memorial Church, knowing that most
Christian churches are against acting
upon homosexual impulses, is disgust
ing."
• In a letter titled "The Sensationalist
Daily," a student wrote, "The contrived
photograph of two men kissing in front of
Mem Chu gives the onlooker the clear
impression that there was a wild, homo
sexual orgy in the Quad on Friday night..
.. The Daily does not exist as a forum for
creative photography, but instead as an
organization whose primary responsibil
ity is to keep the student body informed
of the truth."
• Another letter writer noted, "Per
haps that photo would not even have been
considered for the front page (or The
Daily at all) if it had been a male and a
female kissing. For then, it would not
have had any sensationalist effect such as
blatantly stirring up homosexual public
ity."
• A staff member in the Office of Devel
opment called to say that publication of
the photo will hamper the University's
fund-raising efforts because it presents
an image of Stanford that many alumni
will find distasteful.
• A newspaper reporter phoned asking
if The Daily ran the photo as a response to
the recent incident in which two men
were arrested for holding hands in a
parked car in a Cincinnati city park.
• Another student wrote, "I am not
used to seeing two men kiss, and though

I've accepted it intellectually, it still made
me uneasy on a gut level. ... This prob
lem is mine — not The Daily's, not the
two men in the photo — and one which I
hope to overcome."
What, then, is the motivation for run
ning such a photo?
The Daily frequently runs photos that
show what we call "a slice of Stanford
life." This description applies to photos
that are not tied to a news event but show
some element of life at Stanford that is
not otherwise seen in The Daily's pages.
This photo is worthy of publication for
three reasons. First, it is legitimate; it
was not "contrived" but was taken to cap
ture the actions of two people at a Univer
sity event.
Second, it is visually grabbing; it
sparks discussion, and all newspapers
aim to publish material that moves people
to think about substantive issues.
Third, it meets the main qualification
for a "slice of life" photo — it shows a part
of Stanford life to which our readers may
not otherwise be exposed.
The photo is not intended to represent
the experience of every person who
attended "Full Moon in the Quad," and
most Daily readers, who in general are
familiar with the traditions of the event,
probably realize that. A photo of a man
and woman kissing in the Quad wouldn't
be anything new to most of our readers.
We were aware when we decided to
publish the photo that it would offend
some people and might cause difficulty
for those in the University charged with
keeping Stanford's image "nice." But it
would be difficult to produce a newspaper
free of material that didn't offend some

body, and it's certainly not the job of a
newspaper to preserve any "image" that
an institution has created for itself.
Our job is to report and illustrate what
happens at Stanford in as fair, accurate
and comprehensive a fashion as possible
— not leaving out those things that some
people may be uncomfortable with or may
disapprove of.
It's also our job to stimulate discussion
among our readers, and the photo accom
plished that. I appreciate the time taken
by those who have written or called about
this topic — keep the letters coming.

"Summit forges new links," read the
headline on the lead story in Monday's
Daily.
The weekend-long Leadership Summit
initiated by the Council of Presidents was
a success, according to participants inter
viewed bv The Daily's reporter. The 79
student leaders attending got a unique
opportunity to compare perspectives on
campus issues and establish new lines of
communication.
So why didn't The Daily participate?
Skipping back a few paragraphs, I'll
reiterate that our job is to report Stanford
news in a fair, accurate, comprehensive
manner.
The summit was billed as an opportu
nity for representatives of campus groups
to discuss three issues: leadership, multi
culturalism and public service. One of the
organizers said a goal of the summit was
to create "agendas" for each of the three
issues.

As constructive as such a meeting may
be for community groups, The Daily's
role remains to provide the community
with news coverage and commentary
from a non-participant's perspective. Put
another way, in order to maintain credi
bility with our readers, it is best for us to
report on events in which we are not par
ticipants.
Certainly, The Daily also has a respon
sibility to communicate with and interact
with groups in the Stanford community,
and it is certainly true that members of
campus organizations need to talk to each
other more.
But it is not appropriate for The Daily
to participate in a forum that aims, at
least partly, to decide upon community
goals and agendas — and then turn
around and pretend to report objectively
on such activities.
We, too, would like to develop a better
rapport with student groups at Stanford.
I am eager to meet individually or in
small groups with anyone who would like
to discuss The Daily's coverage — or any
of the issues discussed at the summit, for
that matter.
I and other Daily reporters and editors
have initiated contact with a number of
the groups who participated in the sum
mit last weekend, and we're continuing
that effort. In the meantime, I encourage
anyone who has questions for The Daily
or who would like to set up a meeting to
drop by our offices or contact me at 723-
4632.
I look forward to hearing from you.

Brad Hayward is editor in chief of The
Daily.
