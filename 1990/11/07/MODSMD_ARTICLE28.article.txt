## Bugs make big mess by microwaving metal

Q % JuBt what is the deal on
.putting metal in the
microwave? Some say no and
some say yes — what exactly is
the problem ?
A # The Bugs remember a sign
lon a microwave oven that
warned of "a near-death, out
of-body experience" if anyone

turned it on with metal inside.
However, we wanted a more
authoritative source, so we
tried the General Electric
answer line.
GE makes a variety of cook
ing products, from small scale
(microwaves and conventional
ovens) to large scale (atomic
bomb triggers), and they were
happy to give us a rap on wrap.
They said that metal is OK
in the microwave as long as you
follow these two rules. First,
don't let the metal (usually alu
minum foil) touch the walls of
the oven. And second, don't
completely wrap the food in
foil.
A microwave oven uses a
vacuum tube called a mag
netron to produce radio waves
which are transmitted into the
oven chamber. There, the food
absorbs these microwaves and
is cooked. Wrapping the food in
metal foil shields it from the
microwaves, making the cov
ered parts cook more slowly.
However, metal also acts as
an antenna, picking up the
microwaves and developing a
voltage relative to the walls of
the oven. If it is too close to the
wall, a spark will jump between

them, burning the paint and
damaging the oven.
Also, the magnetron has to
absorb all the power that is not
absorbed by the food. That is
why the instructions say that
you should never run your
microwave empty, because the
magnetron will burn up from
the excess power that would
force it to dissipate.
Likewise, if you completely
wrap all the food in the oven,
the microwaves will not be
absorbed by anything and the
magnetron can burn out.
Although metal foil is OK in
moderation, the Bugs have had
some dramatic experiences try
ing to "nuke" pieces of wire.
We are not sure why, but the
metal handle on a take-out
Chinese food container set the
box on fire when it was 'waved.
We advise caution, especially in
light of the results of our
recent watermelon-in-the
microwave experiments.
Q t The oxygen masks on an
• airplane, which are sup
posed to drop down "in the
event of a loss of cabin pres
sure," have a plastic bag
attached to them. If the flight
attendants tell us not to worry
because the bags don't inflate,
why have them ?
A # Like the need for more
• and more lawyers every
year, the true purpose of these
bags seems obscure at first.
We Bugs decided to do our
own test by placing several
football players from Cal in our
Stanford Experimental De
pressurized Airplane and
removing the plastic bags from
their masks.
Since none of the test sub
jects reported back to us, we
concluded that these bags must
have some useful function.
We tried to contact known
aviation experts Charlton Hes
ton, George Kennedy and
Amelia Erhart but, unfortu
nately all were unavailable for
comment.
Luckily, we did find an air
line employee willing to give us
a breath of knowledge concern
ing these mysterious bags.
Eric Gish, crew member for
a major commercial airline,
denied that their only function
is to mufTle the passenger's


The

panicked screams as the plane
plummets out of the sky.
Gish explained that in the
event of a sudden cabin de-pres
surization, the oxygen masks fall
down from their compartments.
A sharp pull on the supply hose
starts the flow of oxygen into the
mask. When the wearer exhales,
her breath fills the plastic bag
which acts as a buffering reser
voir.
Since the inflow to the mask is
pure oxygen, the wearer exhales
excess oxygen that can then be re
breathed.
Therefore, a person actually
breathes in and out of these bags,
with supplemental oxygen contin
uously added to the mask at a
slow but sustaining rate.
This helps to explain why our
test subjects didn't fare well in
our experiment and also demon
strates the need for doing our pre
labs and background reading
prior to an experiment.
