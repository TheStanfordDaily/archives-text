# Local refuge cares for injured animals

From the time we enter kinder
garten, we are taught "the three
R's": reading, writing, and 'rith
metic. But Wildlife Rescue Inc. of
Palo Alto has three R's of its own:
raise, rehabilitate, and release.
The non-profit organization
was established in 1974 to "serve
the community by instilling an
awareness and appreciation of
local wildlife and by providing a
resource for wildlife rehabilita
tion."
Volunteers at Wildlife Rescue
now practice their three R's on
over 3000 iryured birds and mam
mals each year.
Animals are usually brought to
the center — located in an old
Cubberley High School building
— by concerned citizens.
Most birds are victims of cats,
fallen nests or collisions with
picture windows. Mammals, such
as raccoons and squirrels, may
have lost their families or fought
battles with catq or dogs.
However, people often bring in
animals that don't actually need
any help — a process termed
"overrescuing" by shelter man
ager Amy Izzo-Olander.
When people see fledgling birds
on the ground, they often assume
they are injured. However, the
birds are usually undergoing a
necessary transition period dur
ing which they learn to recognize
and hide from dangers.
Once a young boy brought 28
perfectly healthy sparrows to the
shelter.
"It takes a lot of volunteers to
feed 28 sparrows every hour,"
Izzo-Olander said.
Volunteers indeed are the
lifeblood of Wildlife Rescue. Right
now the center has over 150 vol
unteers, but they always need
more.

Volunteers participate in every
facet of the three R's: raising the
injured animals, rehabilitating
them, and finally releasing them
to the wild again.
The wild? Palo Alto isn't
exactly the Amazon, but "there's
more wildlife here than you would
think," Izzo-Olander said.
Wildlife Rescue takes in rap
tors (birds of prey, like hawks and
owls), waterbirds, songbirds,
foxes, squirrels, opossums and
young raccoons. In the first eight
months of 1990 they attended to
2675 animals.
Right now, two ducks and two
gulls are being closely monitored.
They were found near the Sun

nyvale Sewage Treatment Plant
with a botulism-type disease that
flourishes in stagnant water, a
common sight due to the lack of
rain. They must be force-fed, as
they are too sick to eat on their
own.
When an animal comes in, it is
thoroughly examined by trained
volunteers and a diagnosis is
made. Several veterinarians are
on call to handle more severe
injuries.
After diagnosis, a volunteer
then takes the animal home and
cares for it until it is time for
release.
Some animals can be released
after a few days, but most stay

much longer. Baby birds and
young squirrels may stay as long
as three months with volunteers
until they can be released.
During the rehabilitation
period, the animal is fed natural
foods and placed in a large cage or
aviary with other animals of the
same species, to acclimate it to
natural conditions. Since natural
conditions also include the rela
tive absence of humans, volunteer
contact is minimal.
Finally, when the animal is
fully recovered and acclimated, it
is released.
