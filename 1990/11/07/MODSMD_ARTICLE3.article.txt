# Wilson maintains narrow lead
## Absentee votes expected to give senator victory 
### Jonathan Eisenberg Editorial staff With wire reports 
Republican Pete Wilson held
a razor-thin lead over Democrat
Dianne Feinstein early today in a
gubernatorial race that looked to
absentee ballots for the ultimate
decision.
With 87 percent of Califor
nia's precincts reporting at 3:15
a.m., Wilson led the former San
Francisco mayor by a scant
55,000 votes — a margin of 48
percent to 47 percent. Minor
party candidates divided the
remainder of the votes.
In other statewide races, vot
ers decidedly rejected the "Big
Green" environmental initiative
and propositions calling for
increased alcohol taxes, while
embracing a term limit for state
officials. (See story, page 12).
As dawn neared, neither Wil
son, in San Diego, nor Feinstein,
in San Francisco, declared vic
tory or conceded defeat.
Nevertheless, Wilson
appeared to be headed far vic
tory. The vote tally did not
reflect the results of a slow vote
count in Orange County, where
he held a two-to-one edge. Fur
ther, some 500,000 absentee bal
lots remained to be counted, and
most were expected to go to the
Republican senator.
As the early returns rolled in,
Wilson appeared to hold a solid
lead over Feinstein. With 7 per
cent of the vote tallied at 10:30
p.m., he was up 57 percent to 39
percent.
But an 11th hour surge by
Feinstein narrowed the margin
to a three-percentage-point —
then one-percentage-point —
difference.
Just before 1 a.m., Feinstein
made her first and only appear
ance at her campaign headquar
ters in the grand ballroom of San
Francisco's Fairmont Hotel. "I
feel a little bit like this is the
triathlon of politics — it just
keeps going on and on and on,"
she said. "I still remain opti
mistic that come the morning,
we're going to wake up and find
we're in the victory column."
Didi Meyers, Feinstein's press
secretary, cited the nationwide
trend supporting Democrats on
Election Day this year.
Democrats won the governor
ships of Texas and Florida yes
terday.
Earlier, Wilson appeared at a
gathering of supporters in Los
Angeles, making it clear that the
Republicans' aggressive attem
pts to capture absentee ballots
played a pivotal role in the cam
paign and delayed the vote
count. The Republicans sent out
an estimated four million absen
tee ballots, to the Democrat's

approximately 2.3 million.
"We have created a monster,"
Wilson told the cheering throng.
"It is called the absentee vote.
It's the right kind of monster to
have."
At Feinstein headquarters,
state Democratic Party Chair
Jerry Brown called the Republi
can expenditures for absentee
ballots "a waste of money." Steve
Westley, former vice chair of the
state party, shot back that the
Democrats had "some of the
money but not the organization"
required to put together an
effective absentee ballot cam
paign and attributed the failing
to Brown's leadership early in
the campaign.
"If [Feinstein] loses by a per
cent, [Brown] is going to take
some of the blame," Westley
said.
Wilson maintained a 3-to-2
edge over Feinstein in the early
absentee ballot count.
Santa Clara County, of which
Stanford is a part, clearly pre
ferred Feinstein for governor, by
a 52.5 percent to 42.3 percent
margin, according to the county
clerk's office.
