Stop the biological clock
Menopause no longer marks the end of a
woman's childbearing years.
Several women participating in a recent
scientific study berame pregnant through
artificial insemination and delivered healthy
babies, even though they were no longer
menstruating.
Four of the seven post-menopausal
women, ages 40-44, became pregnant and
delivered healthy babies.
The eggs were donated by younger women
and fertilized with sperm from the older
women's husbands, then implanted in the
older women's wombs.

Older women often experience difficulties
having children, even before they reach
menopause. Women in their 40's miscarry
half of their pregnancies.
Previously, it was believed that the older
women's uteruses were less capable of sus
taining a pregnancy.
But now it appears that the deterioration
of the women's eggs is responsible for the
difficult pregnancies and the miscarriages.
Food label confusion
Have you ever questioned the veracity of
claims made on food package labels?
Have you ever wondered whether the cup

cakes you munch on are really preventing
cancer and heart disease (as their labels
sometimes claim) because they contain a
gram or two of oat bran?
A recent bill passed by congress will cur
tail the disease-prevention claims which
have become common and increasingly con
fusing in the past three years.
The bill will require the Food and Drug
Administration to create a list of acceptable
claims that can be made by food companies.
The current confusion about health
claims began three years ago when the Rea
gan Administration abandoned an 81-year
old ban against disease-prevention claims on
food labels.
