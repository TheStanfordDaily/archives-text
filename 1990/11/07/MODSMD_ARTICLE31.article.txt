# Sick and tired of school? Try getting more sleep
## 
### Shobhit Arora 
Are you the kind of person who
stays up until four a.m. the night
before a midterm?
Do you sacrifice sleep for your
G.PA. and your social life?
Then, like many students, you
may be at the risk of developing a
variety of mental, emotional and
physical disorders caused by sleep
deprivation.
Everyone knows that a good
night's sleep leaves you feeling
well-rested and ready to face a
new day of classes. Few, however,
realize that a consistent sleeping
routine is essential for good
health.
But what sorts of problems can
sleep deprivation cause?
The specific disorder an indi
vidual develops depends on which
of the two types of sleep they are
lacking — REM (rapid eye move

ment) or non-REM.
Dreams occur during REM
sleep, which makes up a quarter
of the total sleeping hours, while
non-REM sleep is the period of
deepest slumber.
Sleep researchers believe that
dreaming is somehow necessary
for emotional well-being. It is not
surprising, therefore, that REM
sleep deprivation has been linked
with anxiety and depression.
A lack of non-REM sleep, on
the other hand, has been shown to
inhibit the body's ability to heal
itself and fight off infections.
This is because the chemical
mediators that are responsible for
the immunological response —
interferon and interleukins — are
most effectively released into the
bloodstream during non-REM
sleep.
People who don't get enough

sleep are therefore more suscepti
ble to common illnesses such as
colds. This is one of the reasons
that infectious diseases are so
prevalent on college campuses
during midterms and finals.
But how much sleep does one
need to prevent such disorders?
There is no fixed standard.
Quite simply, you're the best
judge of your sleep requirements.
While most people feel their best
after seven or eight hours of rest,
some need as few as four and oth
ers as many as 10 to function
properly.

Just as important as getting
enough sleep is establishing a con
sistent, daily sleeping pattern
where you go to bed and wake up
at the same time each day, even on
weekends.
This allows your body to
develop a natural rhythm of sleep
and activity.
If you must stay up those extra
hours to work, make sure that you
get up at your normal time the
next morning. Although this will
leave you feeling tired and groggy,
it will ensure that you do not slip
into a pattern of going to bed and
getting up late on a regular basis.
In addition to keeping regular
sleeping hours, here are some tips
to ensure a good night's sleep.
• If you have trouble falling
asleep, try having a light snack or
some milk before bedtime. Food,

and especially milk, contains cer
tain chemicals, such as the amino
acid tryptophan, that induce
drowsiness.
• If you're bothered by noise or
lights, consider using ear plugs or
eye shades.
• Exercise regularly, but not
before bedtime.
An exercise regimen is impor
tant to developing the body's nat
ural rhythms of sleep and activity.
But exercising right before bed
time will alter your sleeping pat
terns.
Sleep is just too important to
cut short on a daily basis, espe
cially for students who need to be
mentally alert and in good physi
cal health to succeed in an envi
ronment as demanding as Stan
ford's.
So sleep tight and don't let the
Science Bugs bite.
