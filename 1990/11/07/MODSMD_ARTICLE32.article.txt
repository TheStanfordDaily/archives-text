## Bowls, polls need a clue 
### 
Ladies and gentleman. It's time for that
annual November tradition, the college
football beauty contest. Otherwise
known as "Wooing the Bowls for Fun and
Profit. Mostly Profit."
Yes, it's already started. With two to three
weeks still left in the season, bowl game offi
cials are running around like desperate high
school seniors trying to line up a big date for
the prom. No one wants to be left hanging out
by the punchbowl on New Year's Day, when the
big dance commences.
But things are getting all fouled up. If this
season, and especially this last weekend, has
taught us anything, it is that yesterday's prom
queen is today's wallflower. And it has
prompted me to reconsider my passion for the
holiday bowl orgy and find fault with college
football's system of choosing a national cham
pion.

Imagine my chagrin yesterday as I pick up
my morning paper to discover that Notre Dame
is back atop the polls and No. 1 in the hearts of
the bowl officials. Everyone, it seems, has the
hots for the Irish and is willing to lay out the
big bucks for a New Year's tite-d-tite.
Reality check time. Are these the same Irish
that blew a comfortable lead and lost to the
mighty (3-6) Stanford Cardinal last month? On
their home field? When they were the No. 1
team in the country? The Notre Dame that
dropped to No. 8 following that humbling? Do
you believe in dej& vu (dej& vu, dejfc vu. ...)?
Apparently the judges have forgiven that lit
tle indiscretion by the Irish, because Notre
Dame is again the reigning queen in this
pageant. But that is just the warm-up. The way
this season is going, the national championship
itself is going to be decided in a similar manner,
for the second year in a row: with a subjective
beauty contest where no one is vindicated, not
even the winner.
Before I break it down for you, let me state
up front that I am biased as a long-time Wash
ington Huskies fan. But despite the fact that
there is a decided Eastern bias in the polls, I'm
not arguing for recognition. I'm simply arguing
for fairness. There's got to be a better way to
figure out college football's national champion.
Notre Dame is 7-1, with its only loss to Stan
ford. The Huskies are 8-1, with their only loss
to Colorado. Washington lost by six on the
road, Notre Dame lost by five at home. Despite
this, and the fact that Washington annihilated
the Cardinal 52-16 in Stanford Stadium, the
Huskies are No. 2, behind the Irish. Who is bet
ter? Only a head-to-head meeting could decide
such a question.
Too bad it won't get played. Because of the
bowl system, these two teams will never get the
chance to settle the matter on the field. The
players and fans, year in and year out, are
being deprived of a true title game. That is why
there should be some kind of playoff system in
college football.
Last year is a prime example of how the
bowl system fails. In early November, Notre
Dame was already signed, sealed, and delivered
to the Orange Bowl in what was supposed to be
a national championship game with unde
feated Colorado. But then Miami ruined a TV
executive's dream by beating the Irish late in
the season. Notre Dame found itself playing for
second place, as Miami knocked off a lackluster
Alabama team for the disputed title.
This year, the situation is even worse. When
previously-unbeaten Virginia, a questionable
No. 1 anyway, fell to Georgia Tech last week
end, it seemed to open up the floodgates.
Auburn was drubbed by Florida for its first
loss. Nebraska, 8-0 thanks to a patsy schedule,
lost to Colorado. Suddenly, there was no team
left for the poll makers to pin their alibis on.
And the bowl picture (not to mention the polls)
was scrambled worse than a cable pay-channel.
Washington is part of the Pacific 10 Confer
ence, which at this point is the main thing
standing between them and a shot at the title.
Because they have won the conference (Con
gratulations!), the Huskies have no choice of
which team they will face in the post-season —
the Pac-10 has a binding contract with the
Rose Bowl (whoops). There, Washington will
face the Big Ten Conference champion, mostly
likely a little-heralded lowa team.
This means that the Huskies could win their
final two regular season games handily, bury
the Hawkeyes on New Year's Day, and wind up
.. . with the same ranking they have now. Nice
season, guys. Yeah, Notre Dame won its bowl
too. Sorry. See ya next year.
Ironically, Washington has been through
this once before, in the best example of how
bad this system is. The only difference between
this year and 1984 was that Washington's one
loss that year came in the Pac-10, and they
didn't go to the Rose Bowl. But the Huskies
were able to secure a trip to the Orange Bowl
against Oklahoma, which was contending for
the national title. The Huskies shocked the
Sooners 27-16, and a national title was theirs,
right? Wrong. The polls selected unbeaten but
unproven Brigham Young, which had won the
lackluster Holiday Bowl over a mediocre Michi
gan team Christmas Day.
No wonder they call it a "mythical" national
championship — it has no basis in reality.
Unlike every other single NCAA sport, there is
no tournament to decide which team is the
best. In the past, the two primary polls (Associ-


Dave
Hirning
ated Press and United Press
International) have even differed
on who was No. 1, leading to the
unfourtunate term "consensus
national title" to clarify thingß.
Then there is the "outlaw fac
tor." The Houston Cougars are
the only unbeaten, untied team
left this season, but are ineligible
for a bowl game due to NCAA pro
bation. Yet, because of the system,
they could still end up No. 1 in the
final poll. It has happened before,
with Oklahoma's 1974 title.
Compare this with college bas
ketball, where Nevada-Las Vegas
will play the season but will not
be allowed to defend its national
crown in the 1991 tournament.
But the NCAA doesn't control the
polls, and without a tournament
could potentially look silly if
Houston wins the "mythical"
football title. If this nightmare
does happen, perhaps it will
finally motivate the governing
body to install some kind of sanc
tioned playoffs.
The debate over this is not
new, and there are vehement
arguments on both sides. I'm not
here to provide the magical solu
tion. But I think the logistical
problems can be overcome, and
whatever is sacrificed in tradition
and "pageantry" (yeah, the "Fed
eral Express Orange Bowl" really
sets my heart to thumping) will
be more than made up for in both
excitement and fairness.
There are rumblings already,
and the whole thing could erupt

soon. Colorado (8-1-1) is whining
about their lack of recognition
despite beating Washington (talk
about jumping on the band
wagon! This is a team that needed
five downs to beat Missouri, and
then refused to even consider a
reversal). Houston, currently
third, will stick its two cents in.
Georgia Tech (7-0-1) lays claim to
the dubious distinction of being
the only unbeaten, not-on-proba
tion team in the country.
And there is dashing Notre
Dame, whose athletic director has
been quoted as seeking a "very
attractive opponent" for their
bowl. As an independent, the
Iris"h are free to literally go to the
highest bidder. Two years ago, it
was the Fiesta Bowl that came a
courtin'. This year, who knows?
The whole thing is getting out of
control.
If you're still not convinced, I'll
leave you with this. Under the
current system, nothing is ever
settled on the field. Statistics like
common opponents and strength
of schedule are used, things that
are decided 10 years in advance.
So we have stupid scenarios like
this: if Notre Dame was beaten by
Stanford, and the Cardinal fell to
San Jose State, the Spartans
should be No. 1. After all, they
took on the No. 2 Huskies in Seat
tle and only lost by three.
But this is a beauty contest,
and San Jose State doesn't have
the image that Notre Dame
boasts. It's time to close the
pageant, and end the madness.

Georgia Tech (7-0-1) lays claim to
the dubious distinction of being
the only unbeaten, not-on-proba

And there is dashing Notre
Dame, whose athletic director has
been quoted as seeking a "very
attractive opponent" for their
bowl. As an independent, the

was the Fiesta Bowl that came a

The whole thing is getting out of

San Jose State, the Spartans
should be No. 1. After all, they
took on the No. 2 Huskies in Seat

Ladies and gentleman. It's time for that
annual November tradition, the college
football beauty contest. Otherwise
known as "Wooing the Bowls for Fun and
Profit. Mostly Profit."
Yes, it's already started. With two to three
weeks still left in the season, bowl game offi
cials are running around like desperate high
school seniors trying to line up a big date for
the prom. No one wants to be left hanging out
by the punchbowl on New Year's Day, when the
big dance commences.
But things are getting all fouled up. If this
season, and especially this last weekend, has
taught us anything, it is that yesterday's prom
queen is today's wallflower. And it has
prompted me to reconsider my passion for the
holiday bowl orgy and find fault with college
football's system of choosing a national cham
pion.

Imagine my chagrin yesterday as I pick up
my morning paper to discover that Notre Dame
is back atop the polls and No. 1 in the hearts of
the bowl officials. Everyone, it seems, has the
hots for the Irish and is willing to lay out the
big bucks for a New Year's tite-d-tite.
Reality check time. Are these the same Irish
that blew a comfortable lead and lost to the
mighty (3-6) Stanford Cardinal last month? On
their home field? When they were the No. 1
team in the country? The Notre Dame that
dropped to No. 8 following that humbling? Do
you believe in dej& vu (dej& vu, dejfc vu. ...)?
Apparently the judges have forgiven that lit
tle indiscretion by the Irish, because Notre
Dame is again the reigning queen in this
pageant. But that is just the warm-up. The way
this season is going, the national championship
itself is going to be decided in a similar manner,
for the second year in a row: with a subjective
beauty contest where no one is vindicated, not
even the winner.
Before I break it down for you, let me state
up front that I am biased as a long-time Wash
ington Huskies fan. But despite the fact that
there is a decided Eastern bias in the polls, I'm
not arguing for recognition. I'm simply arguing
for fairness. There's got to be a better way to
figure out college football's national champion.
Notre Dame is 7-1, with its only loss to Stan
ford. The Huskies are 8-1, with their only loss
to Colorado. Washington lost by six on the
road, Notre Dame lost by five at home. Despite
this, and the fact that Washington annihilated
the Cardinal 52-16 in Stanford Stadium, the
Huskies are No. 2, behind the Irish. Who is bet
ter? Only a head-to-head meeting could decide
such a question.
Too bad it won't get played. Because of the
bowl system, these two teams will never get the
chance to settle the matter on the field. The
players and fans, year in and year out, are
being deprived of a true title game. That is why
there should be some kind of playoff system in
college football.
Last year is a prime example of how the
bowl system fails. In early November, Notre
Dame was already signed, sealed, and delivered
to the Orange Bowl in what was supposed to be
a national championship game with unde
feated Colorado. But then Miami ruined a TV
executive's dream by beating the Irish late in
the season. Notre Dame found itself playing for
second place, as Miami knocked off a lackluster
Alabama team for the disputed title.
This year, the situation is even worse. When
previously-unbeaten Virginia, a questionable
No. 1 anyway, fell to Georgia Tech last week
end, it seemed to open up the floodgates.
Auburn was drubbed by Florida for its first
loss. Nebraska, 8-0 thanks to a patsy schedule,
lost to Colorado. Suddenly, there was no team
left for the poll makers to pin their alibis on.
And the bowl picture (not to mention the polls)
was scrambled worse than a cable pay-channel.
Washington is part of the Pacific 10 Confer
ence, which at this point is the main thing
standing between them and a shot at the title.
Because they have won the conference (Con
gratulations!), the Huskies have no choice of
which team they will face in the post-season —
the Pac-10 has a binding contract with the
Rose Bowl (whoops). There, Washington will
face the Big Ten Conference champion, mostly
likely a little-heralded lowa team.
This means that the Huskies could win their
final two regular season games handily, bury
the Hawkeyes on New Year's Day, and wind up
.. . with the same ranking they have now. Nice
season, guys. Yeah, Notre Dame won its bowl
too. Sorry. See ya next year.
Ironically, Washington has been through
this once before, in the best example of how
bad this system is. The only difference between
this year and 1984 was that Washington's one
loss that year came in the Pac-10, and they
didn't go to the Rose Bowl. But the Huskies
were able to secure a trip to the Orange Bowl
against Oklahoma, which was contending for
the national title. The Huskies shocked the
Sooners 27-16, and a national title was theirs,
right? Wrong. The polls selected unbeaten but
unproven Brigham Young, which had won the
lackluster Holiday Bowl over a mediocre Michi
gan team Christmas Day.
No wonder they call it a "mythical" national
championship — it has no basis in reality.
Unlike every other single NCAA sport, there is
no tournament to decide which team is the
best. In the past, the two primary polls (Associ-


Dave
Hirning
ated Press and United Press
International) have even differed
on who was No. 1, leading to the
unfourtunate term "consensus
national title" to clarify thingß.

the Cardinal 52-16 in Stanford Stadium, the
Huskies are No. 2, behind the Irish. Who is bet
ter? Only a head-to-head meeting could decide
such a question.
Too bad it won't get played. Because of the
bowl system, these two teams will never get the
chance to settle the matter on the field. The
players and fans, year in and year out, are
being deprived of a true title game. That is why
there should be some kind of playoff system in
college football.
Last year is a prime example of how the
bowl system fails. In early November, Notre
Dame was already signed, sealed, and delivered
to the Orange Bowl in what was supposed to be
a national championship game with unde
feated Colorado. But then Miami ruined a TV
executive's dream by beating the Irish late in
the season. Notre Dame found itself playing for
second place, as Miami knocked off a lackluster
Alabama team for the disputed title.
This year, the situation is even worse. When
previously-unbeaten Virginia, a questionable
No. 1 anyway, fell to Georgia Tech last week
end, it seemed to open up the floodgates.
Auburn was drubbed by Florida for its first
loss. Nebraska, 8-0 thanks to a patsy schedule,
lost to Colorado. Suddenly, there was no team
left for the poll makers to pin their alibis on.
And the bowl picture (not to mention the polls)
was scrambled worse than a cable pay-channel.
Washington is part of the Pacific 10 Confer
ence, which at this point is the main thing
standing between them and a shot at the title.
Because they have won the conference (Con
gratulations!), the Huskies have no choice of
which team they will face in the post-season —
the Pac-10 has a binding contract with the
Rose Bowl (whoops). There, Washington will
face the Big Ten Conference champion, mostly
likely a little-heralded lowa team.
This means that the Huskies could win their
final two regular season games handily, bury
the Hawkeyes on New Year's Day, and wind up
.. . with the same ranking they have now. Nice
season, guys. Yeah, Notre Dame won its bowl
too. Sorry. See ya next year.
Ironically, Washington has been through
this once before, in the best example of how
bad this system is. The only difference between
this year and 1984 was that Washington's one
loss that year came in the Pac-10, and they
didn't go to the Rose Bowl. But the Huskies
were able to secure a trip to the Orange Bowl
against Oklahoma, which was contending for
the national title. The Huskies shocked the
Sooners 27-16, and a national title was theirs,
right? Wrong. The polls selected unbeaten but
unproven Brigham Young, which had won the
lackluster Holiday Bowl over a mediocre Michi
gan team Christmas Day.
No wonder they call it a "mythical" national
championship — it has no basis in reality.
Unlike every other single NCAA sport, there is
no tournament to decide which team is the
best. In the past, the two primary polls (Associ-


Dave
Hirning
ated Press and United Press
International) have even differed
on who was No. 1, leading to the
unfourtunate term "consensus
national title" to clarify thingß.
Then there is the "outlaw fac
tor." The Houston Cougars are
the only unbeaten, untied team
left this season, but are ineligible
for a bowl game due to NCAA pro
bation. Yet, because of the system,
they could still end up No. 1 in the
final poll. It has happened before,
with Oklahoma's 1974 title.
Compare this with college bas
ketball, where Nevada-Las Vegas
will play the season but will not
be allowed to defend its national
crown in the 1991 tournament.
But the NCAA doesn't control the
polls, and without a tournament
could potentially look silly if
Houston wins the "mythical"
football title. If this nightmare
does happen, perhaps it will
finally motivate the governing
body to install some kind of sanc
tioned playoffs.
The debate over this is not
new, and there are vehement
arguments on both sides. I'm not
here to provide the magical solu
tion. But I think the logistical
problems can be overcome, and
whatever is sacrificed in tradition
and "pageantry" (yeah, the "Fed
eral Express Orange Bowl" really
sets my heart to thumping) will
be more than made up for in both
excitement and fairness.
There are rumblings already,
and the whole thing could erupt

soon. Colorado (8-1-1) is whining
about their lack of recognition
despite beating Washington (talk
about jumping on the band
wagon! This is a team that needed
five downs to beat Missouri, and
then refused to even consider a
reversal). Houston, currently
third, will stick its two cents in.
Georgia Tech (7-0-1) lays claim to
the dubious distinction of being
the only unbeaten, not-on-proba
tion team in the country.
And there is dashing Notre
Dame, whose athletic director has
been quoted as seeking a "very
attractive opponent" for their
bowl. As an independent, the
Iris"h are free to literally go to the
highest bidder. Two years ago, it
was the Fiesta Bowl that came a
courtin'. This year, who knows?
The whole thing is getting out of
control.
If you're still not convinced, I'll
leave you with this. Under the
current system, nothing is ever
settled on the field. Statistics like
common opponents and strength
of schedule are used, things that
are decided 10 years in advance.
So we have stupid scenarios like
this: if Notre Dame was beaten by
Stanford, and the Cardinal fell to
San Jose State, the Spartans
should be No. 1. After all, they
took on the No. 2 Huskies in Seat
tle and only lost by three.
But this is a beauty contest,
and San Jose State doesn't have
the image that Notre Dame
boasts. It's time to close the
pageant, and end the madness.
