# Streaking spikers venture to Bears' lair
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Ever since the universities of
Stanford and California were born
on either side of the San Francisco
Bay, they have been competing.
And the competition is usually
quite intense.
The schools' football teams
have developed a terrific rivalry,
unprecedented throughout the
nation for its weirdness of results.
The water polo teams have shared
almost all the national titles in the
past two decades and are cur
rently ranked one and two. Both
the men's and women's tennis
and swim teams also spend much
of their seasons haggling about
who gets higher billing among the
nation's top five.
And then there's women's vol
leyball. While Cardinal and
Golden Bears in almost every
sport have been fighting exciting
battles year after year, the volley
ball players have been trying to
fight off boredom.
Stanford has defeated Cal in
the sport 15 consecutive times,
dating to 1982. Those in Cardinal
and White have won 37 of the last
39 games played between the
schools. And more recently, Stan
ford hammered Cal 15-3,15-8,15-
3 earlier this year in Maples Pavil
ion.
Adding to that, Stanford is cur
rently 19-3 overall and ranked
third in the latest national poll.
The Bears, losers of 15 of their
last 17 matches, are now 6-16.
And in the Pacific 10 Conference,
the Cardinal is 13-2 while the
Bears have the same record,
except with the "13" and the "2"
reversed.
On paper, then, tomorow's
match at Harmon Gym seems like
a bit of a mismatch. But, much
like the Cardinal's contest at
Washington last Friday, matches
are played on hardwood, not on
paper. Then, against a Husky
team that had a winless October,
the Cardinal let up after winning
the first two games.
Washington took game three
from Stanford and put up a good

fight before relinquishing game
four and the match. So you can
understand why coach Don Shaw
is stressing this match, even
though the Cardinal hosts sixth
ranked Texas Saturday night.
"[Cal is] having a rough year,"
he said. "We have to realize they
can play very well — just like
Washington did. They played out
of their minds in that third game.
.. . Each match you have to go out
and be ready to play."
Stanford is currently on quite a
roll, having won five consecutive
matches. A big part of the surge is
the hitting of senior Jessica Ben
ton, who has been taking the load
off of the Cardinal's hit squad of
Amy Cooper, Bev Oden and
Kristin Klein. Benton had a
career-high 18 kills in a win at
fifth-ranked University of the
Pacific and is hitting .393 over the
last five matches.
"Jess has been hitting greatly
lately," said setter Carrie Feld
man. "I've been using her a lot
more, especially at UOR I think

played Cal this year, but Morgan Cecil and the rest of the Bears will be looking for
revenge tonight. The match will be televised live from Harmon Gym on PSN.
that caught them by surprise
because they were ganging up on
Bev and Kristin."
Stanford's passing is another
big reason for the team's play.
"Compared to last year it's 100
percent better," Feldman said.
"We still have our breakdowns,
just like last year, but we break
out of them quickly.... It's much
better than last year."
Even though Stanford is play
ing very well, however, the Golden
Bears have a few things to be wary
of. Reason No. 1 is number two,
Lisa Arce. The 5-foot-11 senior
leads the Bears in kills, aces, digs
and hitting percentage. The out
side hitter had an off night
against the Cardinal earlier this

year but is one of the smartest and
most fundamentally sound play
ers in the nation.
"Lisa Arce's always carried the
load for the team," Feldman said.
"She's the main person we have to
worry about. She can do some
damage."
The Bears' two left-side hit
ters, Morgan Cecil and Lynn
Patrick, are also having good sea
sons. Each is averaging over three
kills per game and they are tied
for second on the squad with 2.64
digs per game.
Cal's problem is in the middle,
where freshmen Jill Schneider,
Cara Dane and Shaney Fink have
been sharing the two spots. All
three have been up and down, and
none of them has been able to step
up as an offense force to take the
load off Arce, Cecil and Patrick.
After the Cal match the Cardi
nal returns home for the final five
matches of the regular season.

The team hosts Oklahoma Friday
night before the showdown with
the Lady Longhorns Saturday.
The following weekend the Cardi
nal hosts third-place Oregon State
and Oregon to finish up the con
ference slate.
The regular-season finale is in
13 days against the ninth-ranked
San Jose State Spartans. But
Shaw isn't worrying about those
matches unduly. "Coming off the
Washington State match (a 3-0
win Saturday night) we're playing
awfully well. I hope we can keep it
up," he said. "We're not changing
much except we're working on a
new defense.
"We want to add a few things
like that. We worked at it [yester
day] in practice, and we're getting
pretty good at it. It's just some
thing to give us more variety,
something to try."
Of course, if things go as
expected, it won't be needed.

matches. A big part of the surge is
the hitting of senior Jessica Ben
ton, who has been taking the load
off of the Cardinal's hit squad of
Amy Cooper, Bev Oden and
Kristin Klein. Benton had a
career-high 18 kills in a win at
fifth-ranked University of the
Pacific and is hitting .393 over the
last five matches.
"Jess has been hitting greatly
lately," said setter Carrie Feld
man. "I've been using her a lot
more, especially at UOR I think

that caught them by surprise
because they were ganging up on
Bev and Kristin."
Stanford's passing is another
big reason for the team's play.
"Compared to last year it's 100
percent better," Feldman said.
"We still have our breakdowns,
just like last year, but we break
out of them quickly.... It's much
better than last year."
Even though Stanford is play
ing very well, however, the Golden
Bears have a few things to be wary
of. Reason No. 1 is number two,
Lisa Arce. The 5-foot-11 senior
leads the Bears in kills, aces, digs
and hitting percentage. The out
side hitter had an off night
against the Cardinal earlier this

year but is one of the smartest and
most fundamentally sound play
ers in the nation.
"Lisa Arce's always carried the
load for the team," Feldman said.
"She's the main person we have to
worry about. She can do some
damage."
The Bears' two left-side hit
ters, Morgan Cecil and Lynn
Patrick, are also having good sea
sons. Each is averaging over three
kills per game and they are tied
for second on the squad with 2.64
digs per game.
Cal's problem is in the middle,
where freshmen Jill Schneider,
Cara Dane and Shaney Fink have
been sharing the two spots. All
three have been up and down, and
none of them has been able to step
up as an offense force to take the
load off Arce, Cecil and Patrick.
After the Cal match the Cardi
nal returns home for the final five
matches of the regular season.

The team hosts Oklahoma Friday
night before the showdown with
the Lady Longhorns Saturday.
The following weekend the Cardi
nal hosts third-place Oregon State
and Oregon to finish up the con
ference slate.
The regular-season finale is in
13 days against the ninth-ranked
San Jose State Spartans. But
Shaw isn't worrying about those
matches unduly. "Coming off the
Washington State match (a 3-0
win Saturday night) we're playing
awfully well. I hope we can keep it
up," he said. "We're not changing
much except we're working on a
new defense.
"We want to add a few things
like that. We worked at it [yester
day] in practice, and we're getting
pretty good at it. It's just some
thing to give us more variety,
something to try."
Of course, if things go as
expected, it won't be needed.
Ever since the universities of
Stanford and California were born
on either side of the San Francisco
Bay, they have been competing.
And the competition is usually
quite intense.
The schools' football teams
have developed a terrific rivalry,
unprecedented throughout the
nation for its weirdness of results.
The water polo teams have shared
almost all the national titles in the
past two decades and are cur
rently ranked one and two. Both
the men's and women's tennis
and swim teams also spend much
of their seasons haggling about
who gets higher billing among the
nation's top five.
And then there's women's vol
leyball. While Cardinal and
Golden Bears in almost every
sport have been fighting exciting
battles year after year, the volley
ball players have been trying to
fight off boredom.
Stanford has defeated Cal in
the sport 15 consecutive times,
dating to 1982. Those in Cardinal
and White have won 37 of the last
39 games played between the
schools. And more recently, Stan
ford hammered Cal 15-3,15-8,15-
3 earlier this year in Maples Pavil
ion.
Adding to that, Stanford is cur
rently 19-3 overall and ranked
third in the latest national poll.
The Bears, losers of 15 of their
last 17 matches, are now 6-16.
And in the Pacific 10 Conference,
the Cardinal is 13-2 while the
Bears have the same record,
except with the "13" and the "2"
reversed.
On paper, then, tomorow's
match at Harmon Gym seems like
a bit of a mismatch. But, much
like the Cardinal's contest at
Washington last Friday, matches
are played on hardwood, not on
paper. Then, against a Husky
team that had a winless October,
the Cardinal let up after winning
the first two games.
Washington took game three
from Stanford and put up a good

fight before relinquishing game
four and the match. So you can
understand why coach Don Shaw
is stressing this match, even
though the Cardinal hosts sixth
ranked Texas Saturday night.
"[Cal is] having a rough year,"
he said. "We have to realize they
can play very well — just like
Washington did. They played out
of their minds in that third game.
.. . Each match you have to go out
and be ready to play."
