# Streaking spikers venture to Bears' lair

### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Ever since the universities of
Stanford and California were born
on either side of the San Francisco
Bay, they have been competing.
And the competition is usually
quite intense.
The schools' football teams
have developed a terrific rivalry,
unprecedented throughout the
nation for its weirdness of results.
The water polo teams have shared
almost all the national titles in the
past two decades and are cur
rently ranked one and two. Both
the men's and women's tennis
and swim teams also spend much
of their seasons haggling about
who gets higher billing among the
nation's top five.
And then there's women's vol
leyball. While Cardinal and
Golden Bears in almost every
sport have been fighting exciting
battles year after year, the volley
ball players have been trying to
fight off boredom.
Stanford has defeated Cal in
the sport 15 consecutive times,
dating to 1982. Those in Cardinal
and White have won 37 of the last
39 games played between the
schools. And more recently, Stan
ford hammered Cal 15-3,15-8,15-
3 earlier this year in Maples Pavil
ion.
Adding to that, Stanford is cur
rently 19-3 overall and ranked
third in the latest national poll.
The Bears, losers of 15 of their
last 17 matches, are now 6-16.
And in the Pacific 10 Conference,
the Cardinal is 13-2 while the
Bears have the same record,
except with the "13" and the "2"
reversed.
On paper, then, tomorow's
match at Harmon Gym seems like
a bit of a mismatch. But, much
like the Cardinal's contest at
Washington last Friday, matches
are played on hardwood, not on
paper. Then, against a Husky
team that had a winless October,
the Cardinal let up after winning
the first two games.
Washington took game three
from Stanford and put up a good

fight before relinquishing game
four and the match. So you can
understand why coach Don Shaw
is stressing this match, even
though the Cardinal hosts sixth
ranked Texas Saturday night.
"[Cal is] having a rough year,"
he said. "We have to realize they
can play very well — just like
Washington did. They played out
of their minds in that third game.
.. . Each match you have to go out
and be ready to play."
Stanford is currently on quite a
roll, having won five consecutive
matches. A big part of the surge is
the hitting of senior Jessica Ben
ton, who has been taking the load
off of the Cardinal's hit squad of
Amy Cooper, Bev Oden and
Kristin Klein. Benton had a
career-high 18 kills in a win at
fifth-ranked University of the
Pacific and is hitting .393 over the
last five matches.
"Jess has been hitting greatly
lately," said setter Carrie Feld
man. "I've been using her a lot
more, especially at UOR I think

Carrie Feldman and her Stanford teammates had the upper hand the first time they
played Cal this year, but Morgan Cecil and the rest of the Bears will be looking for
revenge tonight. The match will be televised live from Harmon Gym on PSN.
