# Volleyball at Cal
## 
### 
TONIGHT - Live on the Pacific
Sports Network with the first
serve coming at 7:30 p.m. from
Harmon Gym in Berkeley. Bay
Area sports personality John
Schrader will do the play-by
play. He will be joined by color
commentator Julie Maglnot,
who capped her collegiate
career by leading Pacific past
Stanford for the 1985 NCAA title.
RECORDS - Stanford (19-3, 13-2
in Pac-10 play, ranked third). Cal
ifornia (6-16. 2-13 in the Pac-10).
UPDATE - Stanford has won 13
of Its last 14 and was either an
inch or a bad call (depending
on your perspective) away from
having won 14 straight. Cal, on
the other hand, has dropped 15
of its last 17. Stat of the Day:
In conference play, four of Stan
ford's five starting hitters are hit
ting over .300 while senior Lisa
Arce leads the Bears with a .224
percentage. Sounds like a mis
match.
