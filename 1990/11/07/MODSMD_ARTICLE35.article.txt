# Cardinal prepares to face two-headed option
## 
### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
For only the second time this season
Stanford's going up against the option.
Only this time around there's a dif
ferent twist.
Like Colorado, Arizona likes to stick
to old-fashioned football: hand-offs,
draw plays, pitches, quarterback keep
ers.
But Arizona has not one but two
running quarterbacks. And both are
more than adept at moving the Wild
cats downfield — on the ground.
The Cardinal defense has to prepare
not only for senior Ron Veal, but also
for sophomore George Malauulu.
Sometimes Veal starts, sometimes
Malauulu, but it doesn't really matter
to the Wildcat offense, because the
"starter" is usually relieved by the
other for a quick offensive lift.
"The starter is not something we
think is crucial," said Arizona coach
Dick Tomey. "Ronnie Veal has started
over 30 games for us but George has
come in as a redshirt sophomore and

given us a lift at times. In our style you
need two [quarterbacks] who can
play."
The situation may be nothing out of
the ordinary for the Wildcats, but it
does make things a little complicated
for Stanford. Veal runs the option a lit
tle better. Malauulu throws more
often. And is left-handed.
"We have to try to know in which
situation which is more inclined to run
versus pass," said free safety Seyon
Albert. "They both run well [but] we
can't overanticipate the run."
What Stanford does have to do is
shut down the run, while not being
soft on pass defense. Against the Buf
faloes in the season opener the Cardi
nal did a decent job of containing tail
back Eric Bieniemy, limiting him to 28
yards during the first half.
But Stanford let Colorado remain in
the game by allowing running quarter
back Darian Hagan to toss completions
on key plays. The senior signal-caller,
who usually gains more on keepers
than through the air, had 154 passing
yards, almost a career high.

Coach Denny Green is keeping this
in mind while preparing for Saturday
evening's Contest.
"We're looking at how we defended
the option, but we're also looking at
the idea [that] regardless of what
phase of the game we take away, they
are going to do something else," Green
said. "We didn't respond too well to a
team that doesn't throw the ball well
(at Colorado)."
And Arizona actually has the ability
to throw the ball accurately, althougn
it doesn't utilize the talent very often.
While Veal's 1,454 career rushing
yards are the third-highest ever for a
Pacific 10 Conference quarterback, he
has thrown for 2,882 yards and 20
touchdowns, not shabby by any stan
dards. And Malauulu has added
another 686 yards on 83 completions
this season. But the Wildcats usually
attempt fewer than 20 passes a con
test.
The bottom line is stopping the run.
Arizona is second is rushing in the Pac
-10, with a 207 yards-per-game aver
age. Stanford is only fifth in run

defense. Priority No. 1 ia suffocating
the backfield.
"Obviously Arizona is not the type
of team that will go out and first thing
throw the football," Green said. "We
have to switch gears to stopping the
option. Arizona has more speed than
anyone in the league. Some teams may
be more powerful, but Arizona has a
lot of breakaway speed and perimeter
speed. That's the reason they are 6-3.
"We have to get a good look at it in
practice and make sure we have our
areas of responsibility down. And [we
have to] keep in mind that it's not a
chalkboard defense; we have kick a lit
tle butt."
But the defense is looking forward
to the challenge. And even though a
victory will not help 3-6 Stanford to a
bowl bid at this point in the season, it
can let the Cardinal finish off on a
strong note and help establish a posi
tive foundation for next season.
Besides, Arizona could be headed
for a bowl game, and as Albert put it,
"We definitely want to spoil some par
ties."

on key plays. The senior signal-caller,
who usually gains more on keepers
than through the air, had 154 passing
yards, almost a career high.

Coach Denny Green is keeping this
in mind while preparing for Saturday
evening's Contest.
"We're looking at how we defended
the option, but we're also looking at
the idea [that] regardless of what
phase of the game we take away, they
are going to do something else," Green
said. "We didn't respond too well to a
team that doesn't throw the ball well
(at Colorado)."
And Arizona actually has the ability
to throw the ball accurately, althougn
it doesn't utilize the talent very often.
While Veal's 1,454 career rushing
yards are the third-highest ever for a
Pacific 10 Conference quarterback, he
has thrown for 2,882 yards and 20
touchdowns, not shabby by any stan
dards. And Malauulu has added
another 686 yards on 83 completions
this season. But the Wildcats usually
attempt fewer than 20 passes a con
test.
The bottom line is stopping the run.
Arizona is second is rushing in the Pac
-10, with a 207 yards-per-game aver
age. Stanford is only fifth in run

defense. Priority No. 1 ia suffocating
the backfield.
"Obviously Arizona is not the type
of team that will go out and first thing
throw the football," Green said. "We
have to switch gears to stopping the
option. Arizona has more speed than
anyone in the league. Some teams may
be more powerful, but Arizona has a
lot of breakaway speed and perimeter
speed. That's the reason they are 6-3.
"We have to get a good look at it in
practice and make sure we have our
areas of responsibility down. And [we
have to] keep in mind that it's not a
chalkboard defense; we have kick a lit
tle butt."
But the defense is looking forward
to the challenge. And even though a
victory will not help 3-6 Stanford to a
bowl bid at this point in the season, it
can let the Cardinal finish off on a
strong note and help establish a posi
tive foundation for next season.
Besides, Arizona could be headed
for a bowl game, and as Albert put it,
"We definitely want to spoil some par
ties."
