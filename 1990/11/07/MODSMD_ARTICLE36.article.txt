### Amy Wusterbarth Staff writer 
Forty-mile-per-hour winds and
sand storms blew away almost all
hopes of victory for the women's
golf team yesterday. At the UCLA
Desert Golf Classic, the Cardinal
shot 637 and dropped from second
place to fourth. Stanford is trail
ing behind UCLA which had 611
after the second round, Texas
which shot 629 and Arizona State
which had 635.
"These were the toughest play
ing conditions I've ever seen," said
coach Tim Baldwin. "We had a
really rough day."
The scores reflected the
inclement weather. Leading the
Stanford team was Jodi Figley
with a 79. She is hanging on to
third place behind UCLA's Lisa
Kiggens, who shot a 148, and Deb
bie Koyama, also a Bruin, who
ended the second round with a
152. "For Jodi to be in third with
this tough of a field is quite an
accomplishment," said Baldwin.
Figley seemed pleased with her
performance also. "After I started,
I figured anything under 80 would
be great in these conditions.
"Rain is one thing but wind is
totally different. You have to
really think and not be careless. If
you miss a shot it is twice as bad.

Tomorrow I'll just take one hole
at a time. The weather is sup
posed to be the same so if it's
windy, I'll try to shoot in the 70s
again."
Figley seemed to have the least
amount of difficulty with the
weather yesterday. Coach Baldwin
attributes this to her height, and
corresponding shorter swing. Her
taller teammates, however, suf
fered high scores.
Adele Moore shot an 84.
"Today was simply awful," said
Moore, "I had really bad breaks
with the wind. Also, putting was a
problem because you can't get
steady over the ball and concen
trate when the wind is blowing so
hard."
Baldwin also felt that Moore
had "a tough day on the greens."
For Stephanie Davis and
Audrey Wooding, the wind
affected more than just their
putting. Davis shot an 83 and
Wooding shot a disappointing 91
â€” 14 over her score on Monday.
"Audrey had a bad start and
couldn't pull it together," said
Baldwin, "Stephanie was the
same way."
Freshman Melinda Daniels
handled the weather fairly well,
shooting a 92. This was only seven
