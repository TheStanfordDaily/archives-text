# Cevaer, men move up

Trouble in paradise. That's how one
could describe the conditions at the Pio
neer Electronics Bruin Desert Classic in
Palm Springs yesterday. After enjoying a
tranquil day on the course Monday, the
Cardinal men's golf team found itself up
against 40-mile-per-hour winds and
blowing sand in the second round of play.
After battening down the hatches, how
ever, the squad managed to shoot a 307
and actually move up one place in the
tournament standings to finish fourth.
After 36 holes of golf, Stanford stands
at 598, only two strokes behind third
place host UCLA but 15 shots off the
lead. USC forged all the way to first with
a 583 after finishing in sixth place on
Monday. Fresno State, the deposed six
shot leader, fell to second place by a
three-stroke margin. The pack behind
the Cardinal includes Oregon State at
602 as well as UC-Santa Barbara and
Hawaii at 603.
This shuffling of the deck mav have
been a result of the unusually inclement
weather. "Sometimes on the putting
green the wind would move the ball or a
gust would come up and knock you off
balance," freshman Notah Begay said.
"In situations like today, you really have
to contour your game to what is going on
around you. I thought the team did
fairly well for the conditions."
Certain members of the team even

seemed to thrive on them. Junior Chris
tian Cevaer moved up in the individual
standings to tie with California's D.J.
Volko for second place at 144. This puts
him only three strokes behind the tour
nament's leader, Fresno State's Randy
Bridge, who jumped to an early lead in
Monday's play with a five-under-par 65.
Begay finished strongly with a 75, plac
ing him at 147 for the tournament.
"It's nice to have a chance to win, but
who knows what the conditions will be
tomorrow," Cevaer said. "I just hope to
have a good solid round."
Coach Wally Goodwin had high praise
for the team's leaders. "I was really
pleased for Christian; he played magnif
icently. Notah also showed them what he
was made of today," he said. "As a team,
we picked up some good ground. Tomor
row should be a real shoot-out â€” not
much separates a lot of the teams, so it
will be a scrimmage."
To accommodate the gusty winds yes
terday, it was necessary for the team
members to make some changes in their
game strategies. "Under these condi
tions you have to rely a lot on the short
game because it becomes a lot harder to
hit the green," Cevaer said. "I was just
trying to get the ball up and down and
make safe pars. Putting was very impor
tant; with the wind it was really hard to
stay on balance and make a nice stroke."
Begay also had weather-related sto-
