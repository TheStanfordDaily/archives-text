# Voters shoot down 'Big Green,' impose term limits on legislators
## 
### Jonathan Eisenberg Editorial staff With AP wire reports 
California voters passed Proposition
140 yesterday, implementing lifetime
term limits for elected officials. However,
other hotly debated initiatives, including
"Big Green" and the alcohol tax, were
rejected.
With 71.9 percent of precincts report
ing, only four out of the 17 mcyor proposi
tions had passed as of 2:30 a.m.
An attempt to discourage "career
politicians," Proposition 140 rules that
Assembly members can serve no more
than six years and state senators no more
than eight. It passed 52 percent to 48 per
cent.
The slightly less restrictive Proposi
tion 131, which would have placed limits
on consecutive terms and created partial
public financing of elections campaigns,
was defeated 38.3 percent to 61.7 percent.
Proposition 140 co-sponsor Lewis
Uhler, president of the National Tax Lim
itation Committee, characterized the bill
caustically. "I think what it does is start

the countdown on (Assembly Speaker)
Willie Brown and his careerist cohorts in
Sacramento. ... It demonstrates the
depth of feeling on the part of the people
and helps to launch a national crusade,"
he said.
"California is the only state in the
union that may have an entirely new
freshman class in 1996," said California
Lieutenant Governor Leo McCarthy.
Jim Wheaton of the Proposition 131
campaign said the lack of campaign
reform in the measure would only
increase the power of special-interest
groups in the state legislature. "There's
going to be a Chevron seat, the Exxon
seat, the trial lawyers' seat, the insurance
brokers' seat," he said.
Proposition 128, "Big Green," which
would have stiffened regulations on emis
sions, pesticides, offshore oil-drilling and
logging, trailed by 36.6 percen to 63.4 per
cent.
Voters also rejected Proposition 130,
"Forests Forever," which would have
banned clear-cutting of forests. It fell by a
closer 48.2 percent to 51.8 percent vote.
The two industry countermeasures,

Propositions 135 and 138, also were
rebuffed by voters. Proposition 135 lost
30.2 percent to 69.8 percent, while Propo
sition 138 was defeated 28.9 percent to
71.1 percent.
One environmental leader who
lamented the defeat of "Big Green" said
voters "were just fooled" by negative com
mercials paid for by oil and chemical com
panies. Attorney General John Van de
Kamp, a primary sponsor of the measure,
said the combination of current events
both at home and abroad scared Califor
nians into backing away from the bold
proposition.
Out-of-state oil companies and other
corporations had launched mqjor efforts
to condemn "Big Green" as an economic
disaster which would be too costly, too
sweeping and too complex.
Proponents of Proposition 135, which
would have increased pesticide monitor
ing on food and bolstered research pro
grams, and Proposition 138, which would
have authorized $300 million in bonds for
reforestation on public and private lands,
hailed them as reasonable alternatives to
"Big Green" and "Forests Forever."

Voters canned both alco
hol taxes. The initiatives
were defeated 41 percent
to 59 percent and 31.5 per
cent to 68.5 percent.

Critics called them shams that would
do nothing to protect the environment
and accused them of being created delib
erately to stop the more progressive mea
sures.
If two conflicting measures pass, the
one which receives more votes super
sedes, according to a recent California
Supreme Court decision.
Voters canned both alcohol taxes,
Propositions 126 and 134. They were
wasted by counts of 41 percent to 59 per
cent and 31.5 percent to 68.5 percent,
respectively.
Proposition 126, the "Penny-a-Drink-
Tax," would have increased taxes on beer
from four to 20 cents per gallon, on cer

tain wines from one to 20 cents per gallon
and on distilled spirits from $2 to $3.30
per gallon. The revenue would have gone
to the state's general fund, which is used
for education; therefore, this tax had won
the support of the California Teacher's
Association.
Proposition 134, the "Nickel-a-Drink
Tax," suggested stiffer levies of 57 cents
per gallon on beer, $1.29 from $1 per gal
lon on most wines and $8 per gallon on
liquor.
The following other measurers passed:
• Proposition 127, which will prohibit
buildings retrofitted with seismic safety
improvements from being subject to prop
erty tax increases;
• Proposition 139, which repeals the
constitutional prohibition against the use
of convict labor by private employers and
authorized businesses; and
• Proposition 132, which will establish
a "marine protection zone" for certain life
forms within three miles of the coast of
Southern California.
Some observers said the large number
and complexity of the ballot measures
doomed many of them.

than eight. It passed 52 percent to 48 per
cent.
The slightly less restrictive Proposi
tion 131, which would have placed limits
on consecutive terms and created partial
public financing of elections campaigns,
was defeated 38.3 percent to 61.7 percent.
Proposition 140 co-sponsor Lewis
Uhler, president of the National Tax Lim
itation Committee, characterized the bill
caustically. "I think what it does is start

the countdown on (Assembly Speaker)
Willie Brown and his careerist cohorts in
Sacramento. ... It demonstrates the
depth of feeling on the part of the people
and helps to launch a national crusade,"
he said.
"California is the only state in the
union that may have an entirely new
freshman class in 1996," said California
Lieutenant Governor Leo McCarthy.
Jim Wheaton of the Proposition 131
campaign said the lack of campaign
reform in the measure would only
increase the power of special-interest
groups in the state legislature. "There's
going to be a Chevron seat, the Exxon
seat, the trial lawyers' seat, the insurance
brokers' seat," he said.
Proposition 128, "Big Green," which
would have stiffened regulations on emis
sions, pesticides, offshore oil-drilling and
logging, trailed by 36.6 percen to 63.4 per
cent.
Voters also rejected Proposition 130,
"Forests Forever," which would have
banned clear-cutting of forests. It fell by a
closer 48.2 percent to 51.8 percent vote.
The two industry countermeasures,

Propositions 135 and 138, also were
rebuffed by voters. Proposition 135 lost
30.2 percent to 69.8 percent, while Propo
sition 138 was defeated 28.9 percent to
71.1 percent.
One environmental leader who
lamented the defeat of "Big Green" said
voters "were just fooled" by negative com
mercials paid for by oil and chemical com
panies. Attorney General John Van de
Kamp, a primary sponsor of the measure,
said the combination of current events
both at home and abroad scared Califor
nians into backing away from the bold
proposition.
Out-of-state oil companies and other
corporations had launched mqjor efforts
to condemn "Big Green" as an economic
disaster which would be too costly, too
sweeping and too complex.
Proponents of Proposition 135, which
would have increased pesticide monitor
ing on food and bolstered research pro
grams, and Proposition 138, which would
have authorized $300 million in bonds for
reforestation on public and private lands,
hailed them as reasonable alternatives to
"Big Green" and "Forests Forever."

Voters canned both alco
hol taxes. The initiatives
were defeated 41 percent
to 59 percent and 31.5 per
cent to 68.5 percent.

Critics called them shams that would
do nothing to protect the environment
and accused them of being created delib
erately to stop the more progressive mea
sures.
If two conflicting measures pass, the
one which receives more votes super
sedes, according to a recent California
Supreme Court decision.
Voters canned both alcohol taxes,
Propositions 126 and 134. They were
wasted by counts of 41 percent to 59 per
cent and 31.5 percent to 68.5 percent,
respectively.
Proposition 126, the "Penny-a-Drink-
Tax," would have increased taxes on beer
from four to 20 cents per gallon, on cer

tain wines from one to 20 cents per gallon
and on distilled spirits from $2 to $3.30
per gallon. The revenue would have gone
to the state's general fund, which is used
for education; therefore, this tax had won
the support of the California Teacher's
Association.
Proposition 134, the "Nickel-a-Drink
Tax," suggested stiffer levies of 57 cents
per gallon on beer, $1.29 from $1 per gal
lon on most wines and $8 per gallon on
liquor.
The following other measurers passed:
• Proposition 127, which will prohibit
buildings retrofitted with seismic safety
improvements from being subject to prop
erty tax increases;
• Proposition 139, which repeals the
constitutional prohibition against the use
of convict labor by private employers and
authorized businesses; and
• Proposition 132, which will establish
a "marine protection zone" for certain life
forms within three miles of the coast of
Southern California.
Some observers said the large number
and complexity of the ballot measures
doomed many of them.
California voters passed Proposition
140 yesterday, implementing lifetime
term limits for elected officials. However,
other hotly debated initiatives, including
"Big Green" and the alcohol tax, were
rejected.
With 71.9 percent of precincts report
ing, only four out of the 17 mcyor proposi
tions had passed as of 2:30 a.m.
An attempt to discourage "career
politicians," Proposition 140 rules that
Assembly members can serve no more
than six years and state senators no more
than eight. It passed 52 percent to 48 per
cent.
