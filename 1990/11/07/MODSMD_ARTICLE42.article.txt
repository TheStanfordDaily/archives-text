### Greg Blackwood Staff writer 
Gerd Wallenstein, a lecturer in
the Department of Engineering-
Economic Systems, died of cancer
Sunday at his home in Menlo
Park. He was 77.
Wallenstein taught a well
regarded summer course titled
"Current Progress in Worldwide
Telecommunications." He earned
his doctorate in international
planning from Stanford in 1976.
Even though he was seriously
ill, he insisted on teaching the
class last summer, according to his
son Peter. He finished the course
lecturing from a wheelchair.
Wallenstein was an expert on
communications standards. His
last book, "Setting Global
Telecommunications Standards,"
detailed how standards evolve and
analyzed the relationships of the
national, regional and worldwide
committees that decide the stan
dards for everything from tele
phone lines to broadcasting fre
quencies.
An avid collector of rare books
and Chinese art, Wallenstein was
fluent in many languages, includ
ing Chinese.
Wallenstein once described

himself as a "dyed-in-the-wool
humanist."
"To be human is to communi
cate," he said. "Standards are nec
essary in order to accomplish the
optimum use of telecommunica
tions' potential. If you don't have
standards, you're simply not
going to realize the potential of
telecommunications in the infor
mation age."
Wallenstein was an employee of
GTE Lenkurt for 22 years, retir
ing after attaining the position of
vice president of planning. A
native of Berlin, Wallenstein fled
to China before World War II and
worked as a radio repairman. He
came to the United States in 1947.
Wallenstein received the Capi
tan de Anza Award of the Public
Relations Society of America in
1963 for a successful campaign in
international cultural exchange.
As president of the California
Youth Symphony, he organized its
first overseas trip to Japan in the
early 19605.
Wallenstein is survived by his
wife of 52 years, Charlotte, a
brother, son, daughter and three
grandchildren.
Services for the family will be
held at Alta Mesa Cemetery in
Palo Alto.
