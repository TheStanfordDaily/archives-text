Republican incumbent Rep. Tom
Campbell defeated Democratic challenger
Robert Palmer by a large margin in yester
day's Congressional election for the 12th
district of California.
At 2:30 a.m., with 65 percent of the
precincts reported, Campbell collected 60
percent of the votes, compared to Palmer's
34 percent.
In another local election — the race for
the 21st Assembly district — incumbent
Democrat Byron Sher was leading
Republican challenger Eric Garris by
3,254 votes out of 6,358 cast after 33 of
the 83 precincts had reported.
Campbell, a Stanford law professor,
declared victory at 10:15 p.m. last night
amid loyal supporters and delighted cam
paign volunteers at the Holiday Inn in
Palo Alto. Campbell will serve his second
term in the House of Representatives.
In his victory speech, Campbell
referred again and again to the people of
the district as his constant source of inspi

ration to be an "independent Californian,
free-thinking from time to time."
"What this district has ever asked of me
is to go and exercise my own best judg
ment, to be honest, to work hard, and by
golly, we've done that," he said.
It is this district, Campbell said, that
allows him to "occasionally cast a vote
when it's like 420 to 2, and [I'm] among
the two." The people of the district will
stand by what is right, "even if it's against
the majority of Congress, against the
majority of [my] own party," he added.
During the past two years, Campbell
said he has proved that one can be "inde
pendent, responsive to the highest ethical
standards," concerned about gender, envi
ronmental and economic issues and still
survive in Congress.
Campbell said he now looks to the
future and hopes to make a difference.
Palmer's Mountain View headquarters
lacked the festive atmosphere of Camp
bell's, but the Democrat nonetheless tried
to remain positive. "The outcome of this
campaign hasn't changed me. I'm
still the same guy, believing in the
same things," he said.
Although returns showed
Campbell leading throughout the
night, Palmer waited until 12:45
a.m. to concede.
"I think I would have served
the community well, but I just
wasn't able to get my message
across to enough voters," Palmer
said. He added that it was "very
gratifying to see so many volun
teers working so hard" for his
campaign.
"It's extremely difficult to run
against an incumbent who has
much greater human and finan
cial resources," he said.
Bryan Godbe, Palmer's cam
paign manager, said, "It's people
like Bob who make the system
work."
Campbell left his supporters
and the red and blue balloons
right after his speech to call his
mother in Chicago. Campbell was
accompanied by his wife Susanne,
his sister and three nieces.
"It's very nice to be the wife of
a statesman," said Susanne
Campbell, refusing to call her
husband a politician. Campbell's
nieces Cathy Fazio, a first-year
Stanford law student, and Laurie
Reid, a Stanford senior, both
called their uncle a great relative.
"He stays close to us even

though he's so busy," Fazio said.
Susanne Campbell said the
family is going away for a few days
to get a break from election pres
sures.
Karin Miranda, who managed
Campbell's campaign in 1988 and
is now his chief of staff in Wash
ington, D.C., said this election was
much less stressful than the one
two years ago. The 1988 campaign
was a grassroots effort run by
neighborhood representatives,
Miranda said.
The situation is quite different
this time around. Campbell prides
himself on his record of keeping in
touch with his constituents, and
his hard work paid off.
Campbell actually canceled 18
campaign events because he was
participating in the budget negoti
ations on Capitol Hill, according
to his campaign manager, Sally
Herrick.
Friends and supporters over
whelmingly praised Campbell for
his honesty and integrity, and
most said he is not a typical politi
cian.
"He tends to raise the level of
all those around him" and per
haps even those in Washington,
Herrick said, beaming. "And boy,
do we believe in our product," she
added.
Frank Gardner, a campaign
volunteer who first jmet Campbell
at President Bushes inauguration,
called him a "thoroughly intellec
tual, high-caliber, statesman-like
individual who just happened to
be a politician."

Before recently moving to Cali
fornia, Gardner was the precinct
chair of the Alachua county
Republican party in Florida.
Jim Cunneen, Campbell's dis
trict manager in Sunnyvale,
expressed much admiration for
his boss' generosity. He said he
once asked Campbell how to
direct the new staff, and he
replied, "Tell them to be kind to
each other."
Campbell is a "genius with
human qualities," Cunneen
added.
Alex Einseln, who was for
merly chief of the NATO and
European Division under the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he regis
tered as a Republican so he could
vote for Campbell in the primary.
Einseln has been a volunteer
on Campbell's campaigns even
before the congressman an
nounced his candidacy two years
ago. "He's for healthy economy,
healthy environment and healthy
people," Einseln said.
John Abbott, president of the
Stanford College Republicans,
said the organization is glad to
have a "fiscal conservative" as a
representative.
A great number of supporters
agreed that Campbell will go far
beyond the House of Representa
tives. "He has the potential to be a •
national candidate," Einseln said.
