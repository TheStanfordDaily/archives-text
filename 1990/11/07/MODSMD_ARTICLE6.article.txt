# Medical students send aid — and themselves — to Central America
## 
### Larissa Thompson 
For six years, a group of Stan
ford medical students, undergrad
uates and Palo Alto community
members have been supplying
medical aid to several Central
American countries — not just by
sending supplies, but by sending
themselves.
Working in poor regions and
often under repressive regimes,
the Palo Alto-Stanford Medical
Aid Committee for Central Amer
ica has established externship
programs at several hospitals and
clinics in an attempt to bring
health care to underserved areas.
Alexandra Wilson, a medical
student and group member, com
pleted an externship at the Edgar
Lang Health Center in Managua
two summers ago.
She said she was struck by the

emphasis on primary care. "It's
much better when you can re
hydrate an infant that has had
diarrhea instead of letting it
become another hospitalization,"
Wilson said.
As another example of effective
primary care, Wilson went from
house to house in several barrios
to vaccinate children. "We had to
go out and get the kids who maybe
were missed at the clinic," she
said. "This is very effective, espe
cially when you have scarce
resources."
In Third World countries, the
government channels most of the
medical funding into the more
urban areas. Programs like this
one help to bring medical aid
directly to rural residents, she
said.
Wilson said she was impressed
with the health center at which
she worked. Although physicians

provide medical care with limited medical
supplies and diagnostic equipment, 'they're
very ingenious,' said one medical student.

there must provide medical care
with limited medical supplies and
diagnostic equipment, "they're
very ingenious," she said.
Wilson's program is one of
many the medical group has
undertaken.
The organization is currently
working on a two-year project
with a group of Salvadoran
refugees who relocated to Hon
duras for nine years and have
recently returned to El Salvador.
It sends them medical and train
ing supplies through a larger

organization, Pastors for Peace,
which relays them to the local
Sagunda Montes Clinic.
Organizers said they find it
easier to coordinate their efforts
with larger relief organizations,
such as Pastors for Peace, which
have already established contacts
in the target countries.
Donations for this and other
projects come from the Stanford
Medical Students Association,
local health clinics, thtf Stanford
Hospital and individual Stanford
faculty and physicians.

Wilson stressed the importance
of maintaining "lines complete
from door to door" to assure no
supplies are lost in transport.
"That's the difficult part," she
said.
Working with established orga
nizations also allows the group to
share stable ties other organiza
tions have built with particular
communities, Wilson said.
"It's more satisfying to estab
lish continuity than when some
one gives you medical supplies
and you never see them again,"
she added.
The medical group is also help
ing fund a mobile dental clinic
which will travel to El Salvador.
The group "basically inherited"
the project after the death of the
Southern California dentist who
had been developing the clinic,
Wilson said.
When the group started, mem

bers traveled to Nicaragua and
developed connections to local
clinics. However, the Nicaraguan
government has begun to levy tar
iffs on medical supplies, making
donations "unmanageable for all
medical aid groups," Wilson said.
But the Salvadoran govern
ment has been more receptive to
medical aid, she added. The group
of refugees with which the organi
zation works has also made other
international ties which have
helped its cause with the govern
ment. "They get a lot of attention
from press and visitors," Wilson
said. "The government is more
willing to let in aid to them."
Another of the medical group's
projects has recently been cut
short.
The organization had been
sending medical students through
an externship program to assist
doctors at the Bernardo Dias
Ochoa Hospital in Granada,
Nicaragua. But lack of funding at
the hospital, resulting in 1,000
layoffs, and political turmoil have
put the program "on hold,"
according to medical student

Manuel Oscos, who initiated the
program two years ago.
The hospital has "basically
shut down," Oscos said.
As a result, the medical group
must now search for new channels
through which to send medical
relief. Oscos said the group still
hopes to send at least one medical
student a year to work in other
"sister clinics" in Central Amer
ica. The group sent four students
on externships over the past two
years.

relief. Oscos said the group still
hopes to send at least one medical
student a year to work in other
"sister clinics" in Central Amer
ica. The group sent four students
on externships over the past two
years.
For six years, a group of Stan
ford medical students, undergrad
uates and Palo Alto community
members have been supplying
medical aid to several Central
American countries — not just by
sending supplies, but by sending
themselves.
Working in poor regions and
often under repressive regimes,
the Palo Alto-Stanford Medical
Aid Committee for Central Amer
ica has established externship
programs at several hospitals and
clinics in an attempt to bring
health care to underserved areas.
Alexandra Wilson, a medical
student and group member, com
pleted an externship at the Edgar
Lang Health Center in Managua
two summers ago.
She said she was struck by the

emphasis on primary care. "It's
much better when you can re
hydrate an infant that has had
diarrhea instead of letting it
become another hospitalization,"
Wilson said.
As another example of effective
primary care, Wilson went from
house to house in several barrios
to vaccinate children. "We had to
go out and get the kids who maybe
were missed at the clinic," she
said. "This is very effective, espe
cially when you have scarce
resources."
In Third World countries, the
government channels most of the
medical funding into the more
urban areas. Programs like this
one help to bring medical aid
directly to rural residents, she
said.
Wilson said she was impressed
with the health center at which
she worked. Although physicians

supplies and diagnostic equipment, 'they're
very ingenious,' said one medical student.

there must provide medical care
with limited medical supplies and
diagnostic equipment, "they're
very ingenious," she said.
Wilson's program is one of
many the medical group has
undertaken.
The organization is currently
working on a two-year project
with a group of Salvadoran
refugees who relocated to Hon
duras for nine years and have
recently returned to El Salvador.
It sends them medical and train
ing supplies through a larger

organization, Pastors for Peace,
which relays them to the local
Sagunda Montes Clinic.
Organizers said they find it
easier to coordinate their efforts
with larger relief organizations,
such as Pastors for Peace, which
have already established contacts
in the target countries.
Donations for this and other
projects come from the Stanford
Medical Students Association,
local health clinics, thtf Stanford
Hospital and individual Stanford
faculty and physicians.

Wilson stressed the importance
of maintaining "lines complete
from door to door" to assure no
supplies are lost in transport.
"That's the difficult part," she
said.
Working with established orga
nizations also allows the group to
share stable ties other organiza
tions have built with particular
communities, Wilson said.
"It's more satisfying to estab
lish continuity than when some
one gives you medical supplies
and you never see them again,"
she added.
The medical group is also help
ing fund a mobile dental clinic
which will travel to El Salvador.
The group "basically inherited"
the project after the death of the
Southern California dentist who
had been developing the clinic,
Wilson said.
When the group started, mem

bers traveled to Nicaragua and
developed connections to local
clinics. However, the Nicaraguan
government has begun to levy tar
iffs on medical supplies, making
donations "unmanageable for all
medical aid groups," Wilson said.
But the Salvadoran govern
ment has been more receptive to
medical aid, she added. The group
of refugees with which the organi
zation works has also made other
international ties which have
helped its cause with the govern
ment. "They get a lot of attention
from press and visitors," Wilson
said. "The government is more
willing to let in aid to them."
Another of the medical group's
projects has recently been cut
short.
The organization had been
sending medical students through
an externship program to assist
doctors at the Bernardo Dias
Ochoa Hospital in Granada,
Nicaragua. But lack of funding at
the hospital, resulting in 1,000
layoffs, and political turmoil have
put the program "on hold,"
according to medical student

Manuel Oscos, who initiated the
program two years ago.
The hospital has "basically
shut down," Oscos said.
As a result, the medical group
must now search for new channels
through which to send medical
relief. Oscos said the group still
hopes to send at least one medical
student a year to work in other
"sister clinics" in Central Amer
ica. The group sent four students
on externships over the past two
years.
