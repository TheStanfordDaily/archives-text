# Program to offer work in 'emerging' countries
## 
### Peter Robison Staff writer 
Stanford's Graduate School of Business
will join 11 other U.S. business schools in a
program sending recent MBA graduates to
work for a year or more for companies in East
ern Europe or Southeast Asia.
The 12 schools, including UC-Berkeley,
Columbia and Dartmouth, have formed a con
sortium to organize the program called MBA
Enterprise Corps. The program's goal is to
enable recent graduates with master's degrees
in business administration to work in "emerg
ing" countries, gaining experience while giv
ing businesses in those countries access to cur
rent American managerial thinking.
"There arc gains all the way around," said
Business School Assoc. Dean Jim Patell. "By
working cooperatively, our start-up costs can
be minimized, and the companies don't have
to work with so many schools — they can work

through the consortium."
The Enterprise Corps is expected to begin
operating in fall 1991. Eventually it will
involve 40 to 50 students per year. The partic
ipants will act as internal consultants to cor
porations in Eastern Europe or Asia.
The program was started at the University
of North Carolina's Kenan Institute of Private
Enterprise. Three North Carolina graduates
of the class of 1990 worked in Hungary last
summer in a pilot program.
The idea for the Enterprise Corps was
developed by contacts between Eastern Euro
pean firms and University of North Carolina
faculty members. Facing a shift to more of a
free-market economy, the firms asked the uni
versity for help in working out specific
arrangements to host U.S. business school
graduates.
"It expands our students' educational
opportunities," Patell said. "Our students
seemed to have a high interest in endeavors of
this type."

Patell noted several recent Stanford MBA
graduates have chosen to work outside the
United States in countries such as Poland and
the Soviet Union.
Participants will work for host companies
and will earn salaries in the local currency. In
addition, the consortium will pay a small
amount of money annually, plus air fare and a
one-time stipend.
Before going overseas, each participant will
attend a summer orientation program that
will focus on language, culture, history and
local practices for business transactions and
negotiations. Host companies will provide fur
ther orientation.
Patell said the Business School "is in the
process of devising" an application form for
Stanford students interested in the program.
But Patell added he does not know when the
applications will be available.
"There hasn't been a lot of time yet to get
the nuts and bolts of the program tightened,"
he said.
