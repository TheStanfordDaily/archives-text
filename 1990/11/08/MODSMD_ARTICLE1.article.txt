# Victory and defeat
## 
### 
Republican Pete Wilson thwarted an 11th-hour surge by Dianne
Felnsteln and won the race for California's 36th governor yester
day. With about a half million absentee ballots remaining to be
counted, Wilson held a 49 percent to 46 percent lead over
Felnsteln, with minor party candidates splitting the remaining 5
percent. Wilson will name a replacement for his seat In the U.S.
Senate, which he gives up upon his Inauguration Jan. 7. His suc
cessor in the Senate will face a campaign for re-election In 1992.
Felnsteln, who in her concession speech yesterday pledged to
continue her work in public service, has been named as one per
son who might make a run for the seat then. See story, page 3.
