"It's a mess, no question about
it. It's a terrible mess," Rev.
William Sloane Coffin, national
president of SANE/Freeze: Cam
paign for Global Security, declared
in Cubberley Auditorium last
night.
Speaking on "America's
Response to the Middle East Cri
sis, Coffin noted that "if bananas
were the main export, or if Kuwait
were famous for its figs and dates,
then we would hear nothing more
from Washington than some
tongue-clucking" over Iraq's inva
sion.
But more than tongue-clucking
is going on. Thousands of Ameri
can troops have been sent to the
Middle East and Coffin, like many
others, is looking at the possibility
of war in the near future. "This
could be one of the worst wars the
United States has ever fought," he
said.
"The number of bodies that
will come back in body bag√ü is
going to be staggering," he said. "I
hope that American parents will
quickly decide they love their kids

... more than they dislike Sad
dam Hussein."
Coffin made it clear that the
prospect of Saddam's removal is
not necessarily a promising one.
"Never make war until you know
what the peace will look like," he
said, questioning who might fol
low Saddam's rule.
"I don't care what the
grievances are, for one nation to
seize another nation by force is ..
. illegal," he said.
Coffin said he did not support
the Iraqi invasion, but still ques
tions the reasons for America's
involvement. "What are we doing?
Fighting for feudalism and gas
guzzling?" he asked.
"I think we were absolutely
right to cry foul when the Iraqi
tanks crossed the border. But why
didn't we [complain] when Israeli
tanks crossed the Palestinian bor
der?"
Coffin commented positively
on the United Nations' action
after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
He called it "an appropriate
response" and "a promising prece
dent."
