Iraq will free 120 hostages; U.S.
wants U.N. military force
(AP) — Iraq yesterday promised to free 120
hostages, including a few Americans, but U.S.
officials blasted Saddam Hussein for his "cyn
ical" use of the captives and the foreign envoys
who have been seeking to free them.
At the United Nations, diplomats said the
United States is sounding out member coun
tries on a Security Council resolution that
would authorize the use of U.N. military force
against Iraq. If such a measure is adopted, it
would be an unprecedented step in the history
of the United Nations.
But the text of the resolution has not yet
been circulated to other Security Council
members because Secretary of State James
Baker 111 is overseas trying to line up support
for it, said the diplomats, speaking on condi
tion of anonymity.
Baker, off on a weeklong tour that has
already taken him to the Mideast, is now in
Moscow.
Shooting mars leaders' march
MOSCOW (AP) — Mikhail Gorbachev
sought political harmony by joining a Revolu
tion Day march yesterday but the mood was
broken when a man brandishing a hunting
rifle fired two shots in Red Square before he
was hauled off.
A group of plainclothesmen wrestled with
the gunman, who shot in the air and into the
ground before he was carried away. No one was
reported hurt, and the chairman of the KGB
security police indicated the man was
deranged.
Besides the traditional military parade in
Red Square, hard-line Communists and radical
reformers marched in Moscow and other
Soviet cities shouting slogans and carrying
banners critical of Gorbachev's moderate
reforms.
The theme was peace, however, and Gor
bachev joined his political foes, Russian Presi
dent Boris Yeltsin and Moscow Mayor Gavriil
Popov, in leaving the mausoleum and joining a
civilian march that began after the military
parade.
It was the first time Soviet leaders actually
walked in the march, the state news agency
Tass reported.
Blaze guts movie studio
UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. (AP) - A guard
was arrested Wednesday for allegedly torching
the historic Universal Studios backlot, gutting
sets used for "Dick Tracy," "'Back to the
Future" and an unfinished Sylvester Stallone
movie.
Michael Huston, 40, of Tujunga was booked
for investigation of arson and held in lieu of $1
million bail, said sheriffs Deputy Rich Erick
son.
"He was on duty when the fire started and
after questioning he was arrested early today
at the studio," Erickson said. Authorities
refused to disclose a possible motive.
Damage to the studio, visited by 5.1 million
tourists a year, was expected to be in the mil
lions of dollars, but Slusser said it would take
days to make an assessment.
