# Wilson defeats Feinstein in close race
## Voters reject all four environmental propositions, say no to tax on alcohol

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Republican
Pete Wilson was elected California's
36th governor in an unexpectedly close
race which sends him to Sacramento
surrounded by Democrats to face an
angry Legislature which was both re
elected and repudiated by voters.
With a handful of precincts and an
estimated half million absentee ballots
remaining to be counted yesterday,
Wilson had defeated Democrat Dianne
Feinstein by 49 percent to 46 percent,
3,473,487 to 3,287,109 votes, with
three minor party candidates dividing
the remaining 5 percent.
But Democrats increased their
majorities in both houses of the Legis
lature, won five other statewide offices
and were leading narrowly in a sixth
statewide race.
In state and local ballot proposi
tions, voters said "No" over and over
again — no to all environmental initia

tives, no to all state and most local tax
increases, no to an unprecedented
number of bond issues, and no to the
existing leadership of the Legislature.
The omnibus "Big Green" environ
mental initiative, Proposition 128, was
defeated by a 2-1 margin, but voters
also rejected two alternative initiatives
by timber and agricultural interests
and Proposition 130, a parallel forest
protection measure.
Two rival alcohol tax increases, a
statewide sales tax hike for anti-crime
programs and 12 of the 14 statewide
bond issues on the ballot were also
defeated by voters.
Altogether, 22 of the 28 statewide
propositions on the ballot were turned
down by voters — an unprecedented
rate. Of all of the high-profile
statewide initiatives, the only one
passed by voters, the Proposition 140
term limits measure, had a strong neg

ative message to politicians of both
parties.
Santa Clara County voters rejected
a proposal to raise local utilities taxes
to finance a stadium to lure baseball's
San Francisco Giants to Santa Clara.
In the long run, the vote Tuesday
with the greatest impact on California
politics may be passage of the Proposi
tion 140 term limits.
Proposition 140 will force every cur
rent member of the state Legislature,
including leaders such as Willie Brown
and David Roberti, who have more
than a half-century of seniority
between them, out of office by either
1996 or 1998, eliminate legislative
pensions and slash the Legislature's
budget and staff by about 40 percent.
For the 57-year-old Wilson, who
unsuccessfully sought the governor's
office twice before, in 1978 and again
in 1982 before switching to a success

ful race for the U.S. Senate, his victory
is not without some dark political
clouds.
Wilson faces an estimated deficit of
$500 million to $2 billion in the state
budget he must submit to the Legisla
ture five days after his Jan. 7 inaugu
ration, and he faces a Legislature in
which leaders of both parties fought
the term limits measure which only
Wilson, among all of California's most
prominent politicians, endorsed.
Wilson led Feinstein in the long,
slow vote count Tuesday night and
most of yesterday from the first absen
tee returns to the final, unofficial tally,
but never by more than a few percent
age points. Even the exit polls spon
sored by the television networks,
which normally declare winners
within minutes after the last ballots
are cast, didn't project a Wilson victory
until 5 1/2 hours after the polls closed.
