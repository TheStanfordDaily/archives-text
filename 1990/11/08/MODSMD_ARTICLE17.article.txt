# Democrats victorious overall; GOP takes its losses in stride
## 
### 
Democrats boasted yesterday
of a Sun Belt election break
through that could buoy their
presidential prospects in 1992.
Republicans gained two late
upsets to go with a win in Califor
nia and claimed, "we didn't do too
bad" despite mid-term setbacks.
Still, a Democratic celebration
was in full swing.
"George Bush is in a slide.
There's absolutely no question
about it," said Ron Brown, chair
man of the Democratic National
Committee.
The White House saw it differ
ently, as a midterm election with
something for everyone, and said
it could not be interpreted as a
referendum on Bush's popularity
anyway.
For winners everywhere, the
day after brought exultation. "An
overpowering moment," said
John Engler, elected governor of
Michigan in a long, late count
over Democratic incumbent
James Blanchard.
From the disappointed, there
were generally gracious com
ments. Said Democratic Rep. Jim
Bates, trailing narrowly in Cali
fornia, "If the voters decide to
make a change, that's what
democracy is all about."
After weeks of talk that voters
were angry about Congress' per
formance and ready to make
changes, about 96 percent of
incumbents won re-election.
Senate Democratic Leader
George Mitchell and House
Speaker Thomas Foley, their
majorities strengthened in the
102 nd Congress, went to work on
an agenda for the next two years.
Brown predicted it would center
on economic themes.
"The debate over the budget
was the best thing that hap
pened," he said of the October
political free-for-all in which Bush

abandoned his no-new-taxes cam
paign pledge.
In the ensuing scramble,
Democrats jumped on a theme of
"tax fairness," depicting them
selves as defenders of the middle
class and Republicans as protec
tors of the rich.
A day after the polls closed,
there were four races unsettled.
Arizona's gubernatorial con
test appeared headed for a runoff
after neither Democrat Terry
Goddard nor Republican Fife
Symington amassed 50 percent of
the vote in a three-way race.
Three California House races
were too close to call, two of them
involving Democratic incum
bents.
In all, Democrats emerged
from the elections with a 56-44
majority in the Senate, a gain of
one seat. They were adding nine
seats to their House mcyority for a
likely edge of 268-167. Their
congressional disappoint
ment: GOP Sen. Jesse Helms' big
ger-than-expected re-election in
North Carolina.
Democrats took seven gover
norships away from Republicans,
including Bush's home state of
Texas, where Ann Richards van
quished Clayton Williams, and
Florida, where Lawton Chiles
ousted Gov. Bob Martinez.
Pete Wilson defeated Dianne
Feinstein to keep California in
Republican hands. And the GOP
took away five statehouses from
the Democrats, including Ohio
and Michael Dukakis' Mas
sachusetts. Gngler's win was an
upset, and Arne Carlson won Min
nesota in a race so close it wasn't
called until well after dawn.
With independents Lowell
Weicker and Wally Hickel winning
in Connecticut and Alaska,
Democrats held 28 governorships
for sure and the Republicans 19.

If the GOP wins Arizona, where
its candidate was leading nar
rowly but heading for the runoff,
that would mean a loss of one for
each party.
Both sides claimed gains in the
race to control the redistricting of
House seats before 1992.
Democrats emerged with com
plete control over reapportion
ment in Texas and Florida, which
together will gain seven seats, and
in 15 other states. Republicans
have outright control in three
states, and Wilson's victory gave
then a share of the power with the
Democratic legislature in Califor
nia, which gains seven seats.
Rep. Beryl Anthony noted
House Democratic gains of two
seats in the South and declared an
end to the gradual move toward
the GOP there. "Realignment is
dead," he said. "The Republicans
will have to find a new slogan."
"You win some and you lose
some," shrugged Bush
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, and
he and party spokesman Charles
Black said Republicans beat the
historical averages for midterm
losses by the party in the White
House.
Bush "campaigned hard in
Texas and lost, campaigned hard
in California and won," Fitzwater
added, speaking of two key guber
natorial races.
But Brown chortled that Bush
"campaigned heavily for 18 candi
dates and 14 of them lost." Asked
why the Democrats lost Califor
nia, he replied, "George Bush
didn't stay long enough."
Outgoing Ohio Gov. Richard
Celeste tried to blame Democratic
gubernatorial losses in New Eng
land and the industrial Midwest
on Republican economic policies.
"Democrats may be paving a price
for the weakening of the national
economy," he said.

abandoned his no-new-taxes cam
paign pledge.
In the ensuing scramble,
Democrats jumped on a theme of
"tax fairness," depicting them
selves as defenders of the middle
class and Republicans as protec
tors of the rich.
A day after the polls closed,
there were four races unsettled.
Arizona's gubernatorial con
test appeared headed for a runoff
after neither Democrat Terry
Goddard nor Republican Fife
Symington amassed 50 percent of
the vote in a three-way race.
Three California House races
were too close to call, two of them
involving Democratic incum
bents.
In all, Democrats emerged
from the elections with a 56-44
majority in the Senate, a gain of
one seat. They were adding nine
seats to their House mcyority for a
likely edge of 268-167. Their
congressional disappoint
ment: GOP Sen. Jesse Helms' big
ger-than-expected re-election in
North Carolina.
Democrats took seven gover
norships away from Republicans,
including Bush's home state of
Texas, where Ann Richards van
quished Clayton Williams, and
Florida, where Lawton Chiles
ousted Gov. Bob Martinez.
Pete Wilson defeated Dianne
Feinstein to keep California in
Republican hands. And the GOP
took away five statehouses from
the Democrats, including Ohio
and Michael Dukakis' Mas
sachusetts. Gngler's win was an
upset, and Arne Carlson won Min
nesota in a race so close it wasn't
called until well after dawn.
With independents Lowell
Weicker and Wally Hickel winning
in Connecticut and Alaska,
Democrats held 28 governorships
for sure and the Republicans 19.

If the GOP wins Arizona, where
its candidate was leading nar
rowly but heading for the runoff,
that would mean a loss of one for
each party.
Both sides claimed gains in the
race to control the redistricting of
House seats before 1992.
Democrats emerged with com
plete control over reapportion
ment in Texas and Florida, which
together will gain seven seats, and
in 15 other states. Republicans
have outright control in three
states, and Wilson's victory gave
then a share of the power with the
Democratic legislature in Califor
nia, which gains seven seats.
Rep. Beryl Anthony noted
House Democratic gains of two
seats in the South and declared an
end to the gradual move toward
the GOP there. "Realignment is
dead," he said. "The Republicans
will have to find a new slogan."
"You win some and you lose
some," shrugged Bush
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, and
he and party spokesman Charles
Black said Republicans beat the
historical averages for midterm
losses by the party in the White
House.
Bush "campaigned hard in
Texas and lost, campaigned hard
in California and won," Fitzwater
added, speaking of two key guber
natorial races.
But Brown chortled that Bush
"campaigned heavily for 18 candi
dates and 14 of them lost." Asked
why the Democrats lost Califor
nia, he replied, "George Bush
didn't stay long enough."
Outgoing Ohio Gov. Richard
Celeste tried to blame Democratic
gubernatorial losses in New Eng
land and the industrial Midwest
on Republican economic policies.
"Democrats may be paving a price
for the weakening of the national
economy," he said.
Democrats boasted yesterday
of a Sun Belt election break
through that could buoy their
presidential prospects in 1992.
Republicans gained two late
upsets to go with a win in Califor
nia and claimed, "we didn't do too
bad" despite mid-term setbacks.
Still, a Democratic celebration
was in full swing.
"George Bush is in a slide.
There's absolutely no question
about it," said Ron Brown, chair
man of the Democratic National
Committee.
The White House saw it differ
ently, as a midterm election with
something for everyone, and said
it could not be interpreted as a
referendum on Bush's popularity
anyway.
For winners everywhere, the
day after brought exultation. "An
overpowering moment," said
John Engler, elected governor of
Michigan in a long, late count
over Democratic incumbent
James Blanchard.
From the disappointed, there
were generally gracious com
ments. Said Democratic Rep. Jim
Bates, trailing narrowly in Cali
fornia, "If the voters decide to
make a change, that's what
democracy is all about."
After weeks of talk that voters
were angry about Congress' per
formance and ready to make
changes, about 96 percent of
incumbents won re-election.
Senate Democratic Leader
George Mitchell and House
Speaker Thomas Foley, their
majorities strengthened in the
102 nd Congress, went to work on
an agenda for the next two years.
Brown predicted it would center
on economic themes.
"The debate over the budget
was the best thing that hap
pened," he said of the October
political free-for-all in which Bush

abandoned his no-new-taxes cam
paign pledge.
