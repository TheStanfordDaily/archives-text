# Drug czar resigns post

WASHINGTON (AP) - William Ben
nett is resigning as the first director of the
Office of National Drug Control Strategy
after leading what the White House called
"a turnaround" in the battle against the
drug scourge.
Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwa
ter said President Bush will formally accept
Bennett's resignation in a ceremony at the
White House today.
Fitzwater denied that the resignation
was prompted by threats, saying that Ben
nett "has lived with threats of a kind ever
since day one of the job."
A successor for the job has not been
named, the spokesman said.
Bennett leaves office only two weeks
after another senior administration official,
Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole, became
the first member of Bush's cabinet to
resign.
Bennett, a former secretary of educa
tion, became director the nation's anti-drug
efforts at the beginning of the Bush admin
istration. He helped to coordinate some 27
departments and agencies involved in the
drug war.
"The president feels that Bill Bennett
has provided extraordinary leadership and
service to the country during his tenure as
drug czar," said Fitzwater.
"Two years ago this country viewed this
problem as impossible to deal with and with
no end in sight," the spokesman said.
"Today there has been a turnaround. There
is strong bipartisan support in the
Congress for drug programs and there is
growing evidence that society is beginning
to turn away from the drug scourge."
However, leading House Democrat John
Conyers, Jr. of Michigan said Bennett "was
the personification of a drug strategy of the
last 10 years that failed."
Conyers, chairman of the House Govern
ment Operations Committee that created
the drug office, said Bennett's resignation
"provides the opportunity for someone

without Bennett's partisan
politicizing, more sensitive
to the problems of the
chronically addicted,
minorities, and the poor in
urban areas, and cognizant
of the need for economic
rather than military for
eign drug assistance."
An administration official
who asked not to be identi-

fied said that Bennett feels he "has done all
that he told the president he would get
done. He feels he's done what he came to do
in the job and it was time to get on with his
life."

Lee Dogoloff, executive director of the
non-governmental American Council for
Drug Education, said that Bennett's plans
to leave "have been rumored for some
time" among groups in America's war on
drugs.
"It's not surprising," said Dogoloff. "I
talked to him several months ago and he
said then that he had not taken a lifetime
assignment."
Dogoloff said that many in the field give
Bennett high marks for accomplishment
during the 20 months since he was con
firmed as the nation's first drug czar. The
position was created in the Anti-Drug
Abuse Act of 1988.
"He can feel good that the numbers are
turning around in the drug war," said
Dogoloff. "We haven't solved the problem,
by any means, but the data shows it is get
ting better."
Recent reports show that the number of
patients treated for drug overdose in the
nation's hospitals has gone down and that
there is a reduction in the purity of cocaine
available on the streets. Dogoloff said that
professionals regard these as important
signs that the drug problem "is trending
downward."
