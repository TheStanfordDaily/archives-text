JERUSALEM (AP) - Hun
dreds of supporters of slain
Rabbi Meir Kahane rampaged
through Jerusalem yesterday,
shouting "Death to Arabs!" as
the anti-Arab crusader was
buried.
Kahane, 58, was shot to
death Monday by an Arab-
American in New York.
The rioters attacked Arabs,
smashed shop windows and
clashed with police after break
ing away from a funeral proces
sion of thousands of Israelis,
some of whom toted assault
guns.
Police reported four Pales
tinians and two policemen were
injured, and hospital officials
said two of the Arab victims
were stabbed. Israel radio said
many more Arabs were injured
in beatings. Jerusalem police
said they arrested 13 rioters.
Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir appealed for restraint,
saying in a statement on Israel
radio that "those harming secu
rity and public order first of all
harm Israel and assist our ene
mies."
Near the Givat Shaul ceme
tery where Kahane was buried,
a civilian and two soldiers tried
to help an Arab who lay uncon
scious. A crowd of Kahane sup
porters shouted: "He's dead,
he's dead, the dirty Arab is
dead!"
As the stricken man showed
signs of life, the crowd tried to
hold back an ambulance. Police
forced them back.
While Israeli politicians of
every stripe condemned
Kahane's murder, a debate in
Parliament still brought out
mixed emotions over the Brook
lyn-born rabbi who espoused
violence and the mass expulsion
of Arabs from territories ruled
by Israel.

The establishment shunned
him for his extreme anti-Arab
views, but a chief rabbi and two
Cabinet ministers came to the
funeral. The Parliament that
had outlawed him as a racist
stood in silence for him on Tues
day.
Both officials and newspaper
editorials warned Kahane's
murder could worsen violence
between Jews and Arabs.
"This is the danger engulfing

us now â€” that Kahane's mur
der will spark a dizzying cycle of
further murders," the daily
Yedioth Ahronoth wrote.
"The fear is that this act of
murder will intensify the racist
tendencies of our two people,"
Police Minister Roni Milo said.
But he added a warning:
"The state of Israel, as a demo
cratic state, will defend its citi
zens and will cut off the hand of
those who wish them ill."
