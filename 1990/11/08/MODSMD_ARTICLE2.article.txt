# University faces water usage fine
## 
### Marie Bui Staff writer 
Stanford faces nearly $130,000
in fines for excess water use that
was one-third over its base allot
ment.
The San Francisco Water Dis
trict, which supplies water to the
University from the Hetch-
Hetchy Reservoir, notified Opera
tions and Maintenance about the
penalty this week.
The fine for the four-week
billing period in September and
October is three times as much as
the one for the previous month.
Rationing began last May, and
penalties have been issued since
August.
Stanford Utilities Manager
David Kaye said he did not antici
pate such a drastic increase in
fines and singled out the sprinkler
systems as the "most significant
contributor" to the 2.5 million
gallon water waste.
As of yesterday, all irrigation
on campus has stopped, except in
the inner Quad and the Oval,
where sprinklers have been redi
rected to use water from Stanford
wells. Not watering the Oval
would cause damages that would

be "extremely expensive to
repair," Kaye said.
No other campus lawns will be
watered during the next two
weeks, an "emergency interim ...
to get a handle on the problem and
see what the long-term strategies
will be," he explained.
In the future, the University
may convert to using more of its
own water which, although not
free of charge, is free from liability
and penalties. The University is
currently using one of its three
wells, installed in 1956. Although
water from the wells is pure and
potable, it is higher in mineral
content than San Francisco water
and may harm filters or appli
ances.
Meanwhile, the University is
actively stepping up conservation
efforts.
Recommendations recently
implemented at one of Stanford's
research facilities should reduce
water usage by 600,000 gallons
per year. Kaye said researchers
were cooperative; they "want to be
good citizens, but they can't shut
down their research because of a
drought." For example, water is
needed for indoor climate control
and laser cooling systems. Kaye
said he hopes to continue the pro
gram in other facilities.
However, he said he was not
considering a program imple
mented by Foothill College in Los
Altos Hills. A more efficient sprin
kler system, created by an audit
group from the San Francisco
Water Department and college
grounds and utilities crews, saved
that school 23,000 gallons of
water in one month.
Kaye said a decrease of that
size would not be significant com
pared to Stanford's overall water
use, estimated at 500 million gal
lons per month. The University's
base allotment is about 78 million
gallons per month.
Allotments for water use dur
ing rationing are based on a 25

percent reduction from 1987, the
last year before the drought. How
ever, in October and November of
that year, rainfall was 20 percent
above normal, meaning that
water consumption was unusually
low. As a result, allotments are
unrealistically low, according to a
local engineer.
This year, unseasonably good
weather is contributing to high
water use, said Doug Short, senior
engineer at Palo Alto's Utilities
Resource Planning. Because of
"this beautiful Indian summer,"
nearly every city in the area will
exceed its water allocation, Short
predicted.
However, Stanford has consis
tently exceeded its allocation since
rationing started last May. The
area's top water limit offender,
Stanford was fined $42,000 for
excess in August.
After the August fine, Univer
sity officials vowed to increase
conservation and said they would

shut off fountains and cut off
"irrigation to areas outside the
inner quad."
But dormitory and house lawns
continued to be watered. "Getting
ready for my morning run, I was
suddenly drenched by ... a sprin
kler" outside the French House,
said sophomore Amy McConnell.
In residences, maintenance
people have already installed
water conserving shower heads
and toilets. But student dorms
and houses are not metered, so it
is difficult to measure the amount
of water students waste.
Metering of faculty housing
has just been completed, and Kaye
said that he aims to meter "as
many facilities as possible" on
campus, in order to better gauge
water waste.
By targeting and cutting waste
in residences, facilities and irriga
tion, Kaye said he feels confident
"we will meet our allotments," for
the rest of the year.
