# University faces water usage fine

### Marie Bui Staff writer 
Stanford faces nearly $130,000
in fines for excess water use that
was one-third over its base allot
ment.
The San Francisco Water Dis
trict, which supplies water to the
University from the Hetch-
Hetchy Reservoir, notified Opera
tions and Maintenance about the
penalty this week.
The fine for the four-week
billing period in September and
October is three times as much as
the one for the previous month.
Rationing began last May, and
penalties have been issued since
August.
Stanford Utilities Manager
David Kaye said he did not antici
pate such a drastic increase in
fines and singled out the sprinkler
systems as the "most significant
contributor" to the 2.5 million
gallon water waste.
As of yesterday, all irrigation
on campus has stopped, except in
the inner Quad and the Oval,
where sprinklers have been redi
rected to use water from Stanford
wells. Not watering the Oval
would cause damages that would

be "extremely expensive to
repair," Kaye said.
No other campus lawns will be
watered during the next two
weeks, an "emergency interim ...
to get a handle on the problem and
see what the long-term strategies
will be," he explained.
In the future, the University
may convert to using more of its
own water which, although not
free of charge, is free from liability
and penalties. The University is
currently using one of its three
wells, installed in 1956. Although
water from the wells is pure and
potable, it is higher in mineral
content than San Francisco water
and may harm filters or appli
ances.
Meanwhile, the University is
actively stepping up conservation
efforts.
Recommendations recently
implemented at one of Stanford's
research facilities should reduce
water usage by 600,000 gallons
per year. Kaye said researchers
were cooperative; they "want to be
good citizens, but they can't shut
down their research because of a
drought." For example, water is
