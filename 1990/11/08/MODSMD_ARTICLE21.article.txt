Multiculturalism
has to be personal,
inclusive to work

IT IS A WORD WHICH ALL OF
us hear, some of us use and few
of us truly understand.
If you were to ask 10 people to
define it, you might receive 10 dif
ferent answers. Some people
believe in it, others dislike it, still
others have become very bored
with it.
It is multiculturalism.
In the past, campus leaders have
had great difficulty making multi
cultural education a legitimate
component of the Stanford experi
ence.
One of the main obstacles to
progress appears to be rooted in
the way multiculturalism has been
presented.
White and international stu
dents have often felt alienated
from the entire process, as have
religious groups, the disabled, and
the gay, lesbian and bisexual com
munity.
Indeed, the message from the
communities of color has at times
been exclusionary rather than a
plea for support.
Significantly, multiculturalism
will not be achieved until and
unless it becomes a vision which
embraces all individuals and does
so on a personal level.
To its credit, last weekend's
Leadership Summit appears to
have steered thinking about multi
culturalism to a more inclusive and
personal approach than has been
taken in the past.
Those who attended the summit
were asked to discuss a seven-sen
tence definition of multicultural
education they were given. The
definition emphasized several

important concepts in addition to a
general statement of the need to
understand, respect and seek to
learn from people of different cul
tures.
Most importantly, the definition
included a statement that differ
ences in culture go far beyond dif
ferences in race, ethnicity and lan
guage, as they have sometimes
been delineated at Stanford.
In fact, cultural differences
extend to differences in socio-eco
nomic level, profession, gender,
religion, sexual preference and
physical ability.
In other words, each individual
in a community has his or her own
personal background.
Moreover, because each of us has
a personal history, we are all
equally deserving of being included
in a program of multicultural edu
cation.
Unfortunately, multiculturalism
is a word which has gained a
stigma. Too many people have not
joined and/or been included in its
goals. As a result, it may continue
to be difficult to make multicultur
alism a reality.
Particular emphasis needs to be
placed on incoming students.
Freshmen need to appreciate the
extraordinary opportunity they
have to learn about different peo
ple's upbringings and perspectives.
They also need to be made to feel
that their individual backgrounds
offer just as much of an opportu
nity from which others can learn.
More immediately, all the com
munities which participated in the
Leadership Summit need to follow
up that meeting with more
discussion and debate.
There is no one way to engender
our community with a multicul
tural spirit. But continued interac
tion between the leaders of the var
ious campus communities will help
to illuminate the obstacles to mul
ticulturalism and perhaps suggest
some solutions as well.
