Escondido Village residents must accept domestic partners

I SERVED AS A PANELIST AT THE
Escondido Village forum "Gay, Les
bian, Straight and Bi: All Part of the
Stanford Mix" two weeks ago.
My motivation was to give concerned
residents of Escondido Village who had
never met a gay, lesbian or bisexual per
son the chance to meet and talk with
some of us.
But after about five minutes, the
audience erupted into a classic shouting
match in the us-against-them spirit with
homosexuality and the domestic part
ners resolution as the burning lava.
Two weeks later, the whole campus
seems to have ignited over the issue.
Now that I'm no longer a panelist and
don't have to sit patiently answering odd

questions, I'd like to ask some simple
questions of my own.
What would you have us do? Where
would you have us go? Should gay, les
bian and bisexual students at Stanford
simply evaporate? Is that what you
want?
Well, we're here, and now we have the
opportunity to live on campus with our
lovers.
The two main criticisms of the
domestic partners policy seem to be the
possibility of abuse and the vague fear
that somehow same-sex couples under
mine the (apparently fragile) institutions
of marriage and family.
But these fears, valid or invalid, do
not outweigh the sheer common sense in

having a policy in place that gives Stan
ford students involved in long-term rela
tionships equal access to suitable hous
ing.
Experience has shown me, and I now
hold it to be self-evident, that same-sex
relationships can be as valuable and
meaningful as opposite-sex relationships
Recognition of this equality is not a
privilege, but an immediate necessity.
Our laws, unfortunately, do not recog
nize same-sex marriage. So how are we
supposed to come up with this much
touted marriage license?
Perhaps Stanford's resolution will set
an important precedent toward legal
recognition of same-sex relationships,
but for now we'd better get used to it.

Gay, lesbian and bisexual students are
already on campus and have been for
decades. There are also people on cam
pus who feel a religious, moral or cul
tural imperative to condemn and even
deny homosexuality, but we exist and
will continue to exist.
If you have a problem with homosexu
ality you are not alone. Perhaps getting
to know some gay people or getting coun
seling would help, but after my panel at
Escondido Village, I seriously doubt it.
If homosexuality on campus is a prob
lem, it is your problem, not mine. There
is only so much energy I'm going to
expend trying to make you like me.
