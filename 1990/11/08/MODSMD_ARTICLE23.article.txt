# Photo of men kissing an attempt to stir up homosexual publicity
## 
### 
Concerning the Nov. 5 picture you
printed of two males kissing at "Full
Moon in the Quad," I am offended.
I am not offended by the fact that
they were both male. I am offended by
the fact that The Daily's front page is
becoming a stage for sensationalist pho
tos.
I have been informed that it is regular
procedure to print a "feature pic" which
is usually unrelated to any story. Never
theless, something smells fishy.
Perhaps you took many photos, and
that one just seemed the best. Or per
haps that photo seemed best because it
was the best for saying, "What a wonder
ful sexually liberated campus Stanford
is!"
But perhaps that photo would not
even have been considered for the front
page (or The Daily at all) if it had been a

male and a female kissing.
For then, it would not have had any
sensationalist effect such as blatantly
stirring up homosexual publicity.
