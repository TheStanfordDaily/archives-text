# The 						Daily's cartoon bolstered stereotypes about sorority women
## 
### 
Having been a member of the Inter
sorority Council since my sophomore
year, I did not find your Nov. 6 editorial
cartoon very funny. I have actively pro
moted women's issues both in my soror
ity and outside of it. Contrary to stereo
typical beliefs, many sorority women feel
a strong commitment to changing atti
tudes about discrimination, sexism, date
rape and eating disorders â€” only a few
of the difficulties facing women today.
Sorority members are active in cam
pus groups such as Project R 2 ISC,

Heightened Awareness of Acquaintance
Rape, the Rape Education Project, the
Women's Center, etc.
Seeing as how the ISC has sponsored
many activities through the Women's
Center and will continue to do so, this
concept is not as ludicrous or far-fetched
as the artist of the editorial cartoon
thinks.
In fact, many of the national sorori
ties are very committed to women's
issues; the Kappa Kappa Gamma soror
ity requires all incoming pledges to
attend a sexual assault awareness work
shop before being initiated.
Since most stereotypes arise from
ignorance about a particular group or
organization, I have tried to show that
sororities and ISC are taking positive
steps to eliminate many of the problems
facing women today.
I hope that in the future The Daily
will find humor in changing attitudes,
not reinforcing them.
