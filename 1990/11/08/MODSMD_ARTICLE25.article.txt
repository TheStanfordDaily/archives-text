# Printing 'Full Moon' pic helped challenge bias against gays

I imagine the purpose of the photo of
two men kissing was both to challenge us
and to point out the prejudicial nature of
this Stanford tradition.
For me it did both. I am not used to
seeing two men kiss and though I've
accepted it intellectually, it still made me
uneasy on a gut level.
Male intimacy such as this is foreign
to me and difficult for me to picture. I
feel that only through exposure to this
and understanding can I become accus
tomed to and truly accepting of gay inti
macy. This problem is mine — not The
Daily's, not the two men in the photo —
and one which I hope to overcome.
I thank The Daily for being bold
enough to help me to do so.
