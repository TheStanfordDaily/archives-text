## Art for black people's sake 
### 
Grandma wants me to do
BIG things with my life ... so she
can brag about me to all her
friends.
She figures it'll spice up some of those
after-church get-togethers where even
the juiciest gossip doesn't squeeze out
much more than a half a cup of dirt on
anybody.
Apparently, my grandmother wishes
me well with my education and career not
only because she loves me but because it's
gonna make her social life a little more
lively.
But when I told her I wasn't going to
be an engineer and had decided to become
an English major, I realized there was
another unspoken reason behind her well
wishes.
"So what are you going to do with a
major like that?" she asked.
"I don't know. I guess I'll write."
"Write?! Sounds like you won't have a
job. Now how are you gonna make a living
writing?"
"I don't know. I'll find a way ... hope
fully," I said.
"Well, even if you do find a way, how
are you gonna do anything for us when
you're spending all your time doing such
a crazy thing?"
I suddenly realized that she thinks it's
important for me to do well not for me, or
for her, or just so that she can entertain
her church-going friends. She thinks it's
important that I do something that will
help black people.
"But I can help other black people
through writing, Grandma," I finally
replied.

With a hint of anger in her voice, she
said, "We don't need writers and artists
right now. We need people who can really
help all these young black kids.
"We need doctors who will serve the
community; lawyers who will fight our
wars for us when no one else will; and
engineers who can help black people start
building for themselves.
"We can't be thinking about all this
creative mess until we get the rest of our
lives together," she said.
I slid back in my chair. How could I
argue?
Of course it is true that we should try
to deal with the basic problems blacks
have in society. With kids killing each
other over tennis shoes, and the abun
dance of teenage mothers, drug dealers
and junkies, it's imperative that we deal
with those problems quickly and head on.
We've got to uplift the race. We've got
to save ourselves. No one else will.
But there's more to black America
than black America's problems. Part of
our culture and community is the arts, so
our black artistic expressions are impor
tant too.
We define ourselves through the arts.
Listen.
Grandma, can't you hear who we are
with the music we make? We are Duke
Ellington, Billie Holliday, Ella Fitzgerald,
John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Sam Cooke.
We are gospel, jazz, rhythm and blues and
rap.
Look.
Grandma, can't you see who we are
through our dance? We are Katherine
Dunham and Gregory Hines. We are

African, jazz and tap.
Feel.
Grandma, can't you feel who we are
when you read the books we write? We are
Zora Neale Hurston, Langston Hughes,
James Baldwin, Alice Walker. We are all
forms of things.
Even during slavery, black folks
refused to allow their creative spirits to be
suppressed.
It seems that there will always be some
social cause that seems to be more press
ing than a new black play, a black film or
a black writer's book. So if we forget all
this "creative mess" until the problems
are solved, we may never be creative
again.
Besides, what are we fighting for?
Once the kids stop killing each other, once
folks give up the dope, once young girls
and boys refuse to be parents too early,
then what?
Well, how about if we go back to being
who we always were. Let's sing, and
dance, and write, and perform ... let's be
free.
So you see Grandma, this writing
thing isn't so crazy — it's what keeps us
folks sane.

with those problems quickly and head on.
We've got to uplift the race. We've got
to save ourselves. No one else will.
But there's more to black America
than black America's problems. Part of
our culture and community is the arts, so
our black artistic expressions are impor
tant too.
We define ourselves through the arts.
Listen.
Grandma, can't you hear who we are
with the music we make? We are Duke
Ellington, Billie Holliday, Ella Fitzgerald,
John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Sam Cooke.
We are gospel, jazz, rhythm and blues and
rap.
Look.
Grandma, can't you see who we are
through our dance? We are Katherine
Dunham and Gregory Hines. We are

African, jazz and tap.
Feel.
Grandma, can't you feel who we are
when you read the books we write? We are
Zora Neale Hurston, Langston Hughes,
James Baldwin, Alice Walker. We are all
forms of things.
Even during slavery, black folks
refused to allow their creative spirits to be
suppressed.
It seems that there will always be some
social cause that seems to be more press
ing than a new black play, a black film or
a black writer's book. So if we forget all
this "creative mess" until the problems
are solved, we may never be creative
again.
Besides, what are we fighting for?
Once the kids stop killing each other, once
folks give up the dope, once young girls
and boys refuse to be parents too early,
then what?
Well, how about if we go back to being
who we always were. Let's sing, and
dance, and write, and perform ... let's be
free.
So you see Grandma, this writing
thing isn't so crazy — it's what keeps us
folks sane.
