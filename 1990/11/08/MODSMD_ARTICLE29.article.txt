## Stuart Reges Government shouldn't interfere with private acts of consenting adults

CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING
scenario: The Virginia Legislature
decides that universities receiving
state funding should no longer tolerate
homosexual activity on their campuses.
They pass a law stating that universi
ties will lose their funding by Dec. 1
unless they: 1) clearly prohibit such
activity on campus and at school func
tions, and 2) threaten to expel any stu
dent and fire any faculty or staff member
who violates the policy.
After all, homosexual activity is a
felony in Virginia, so why shouldn't the
government do everything it can to make
sure that our young people and those who
serve as their role models "just say no" to
gay sex?
This scenario is less far-fetched than
you might imagine. Virginia's anti
sodomy law is not some ancient statute
that is accidentally still on the books.
The Virginia Supreme Court decided a
few years ago that it is not a violation of
privacy for police to secretly observe and
videotape the activity in a locked stall of a
public bathroom if it helps them to elimi
nate homosexual activity there.
Gay bars are illegal in Virginia under a
clause that says that no bar shall be
granted a license to serve alcohol if it is a
known meeting place for gamblers, pros
titutes, drug dealers, homosexuals or
other criminals.
Getting back to my hypothetical uni
versity, suppose that the administration
caves in and has one of its lawyers draw
up a new "campus sexual activity policy"
that strictly prohibits homosexual sex on
campus and at campus events. What
advice would you give to the students, fac
ulty and staff?
Should gay people give in and abstain
from having sex? And if they refuse,
should their non-gay roommates and
friends be required to turn them in?
Should resident assistants and resident
fellows be expected to police the dorms
and enforce the policy?
My answer to all of these questions is
U_ _ »
no.

I firmly believe that government has
no right to interfere in any activity that
takes place in private between consenting
adults. Sexual activity, for example, may
be restricted by the government only if it
takes place in public, or one of the part
ners does not consent to the activity, or a
child is involved.
I do not, however, advocate capri
ciously disobeying laws.
Driving on a public street or highway,
for example, is a privilege, not a right.
When you disobey traffic regulations, you
endanger not only yourself, but also any
others who are driving on the same road.
Even driving on private property is not an
entirely private activity if gasoline is
burned, because such activity has an
effect on the environment and the avail
ability of gasoline.
I can find no rational justification for
speeding. The 55 mph speed limit was
intended partially to improve highway
safety but mostly to reduce national con
sumption of gasoline.
What right do I have to endanger oth
ers, to increase air pollution, to increase
our dependence on foreign oil and to
increase the probability of another Exxon
Valdez disaster by driving faster than 55?
As a result, I now drive 55. I may be
the only person I know who does, but my
gas mileage has improved significantly.
What about underage drinking?
According to my principle, the govern
ment has no authority to regulate drink
ing that takes place in private among con
senting adults.
I think that most Americans feel as I
do that the age of 18 is a reasonable
threshold to set for a legal definition of
adulthood. Eighteen-year-olds can vote,
can be drafted, are tried as adults when
they commit crimes and are expected to
be financially responsible for themselves.
It makes no sense to treat them as adults
in every respect but this one.
Thus, I believe that government has
no authority to prohibit drinking done in
private by those who are 18 or older. The
primary motivation for raising the drink
ing age to 21 was the reduction of high
way deaths due to teenage drinking.
While I think the goal is desirable and
the approach is logical, I do not believe
that the ends justify the means. It is per
fectly reasonable for the government to
outlaw drunk driving and to vigorously
pursue violators, but it may not infringe
on personal liberty to do so.
What about the use of drugs? Again,
according to my principle the government
has no authority to regulate what con

senting adults choose to do in private.
The counterargument is that drug use
affects more than just an individual
because it generates crime and addicts.
The crime argument is almost entirely
circular because drug laws generate most
such crime.
If drugs were decriminalized, drug
users and drug dealers (except those who
sell to children) would no longer be crim
inals, and the violence associated with
drug dealing would disappear when the
dealers found themselves unable to com
pete with cheaper and higher quality
drugs being sold along with beer and wine
at your local Safeway.
The addict argument is more complex.
If you are committed to the notion of a
welfare state, then you might very well be
concerned about the possibility that indi
viduals will become addicted to drugs.
I would personally rather die than
accept government welfare, so I find it
disturbing that people use this argument
to prevent me from using addictive drugs.
I am even more troubled, however, by
the fact that this argument has no practi
cal bounds. If recreational rock-climbing
is dangerous, why can't the welfare state
ban it so that it does not have to support
its victims?
Once you accept the addict argument,
you grant the government unlimited
power to limit your personal freedom. As
a result, I reject all such arguments. In
fact, I think this predicament is one of the

best arguments against the notion of a
welfare state.
Thus, I disagree in principle with those
who want to control highly addictive sub
stances, but I understand the logic behind
their reasoning. I feel that the federal
government, however, in its "just say no"
campaign against drugs violates not only
principle, but common sense as well.
Most absurd of all is the government's
"zero tolerance" of all drugs, independent
of their particular properties. Crack
cocaine is taken to be the prototypical
drug in setting drug policy, which makes
about as much sense as deciding how to
treat British citizens by assuming they
are all like Jack the Ripper.
Consider, for example, marijuana. One
if its most desirable qualities is that it can
be grown at home. Is there a better way to
undercut the "international drug cartel"
and reduce violent crime associated with
drug dealing than to have individuals pro
duce their own supply of drugs?
Yet the government uses the crime
associated with crack and crack dealing as
a way to justify its campaign against mar
ijuana users and growers.
My own personal favorite drug is a
substance called MDA, which has been
nicknamed "the love drug" because of its
primary effects, extreme euphoria and a
sense of liking everyone.
It has been extensively studied, it is
not addictive, no detrimental long-term

side effects have been recorded in the 50
years it has been studied.
About the most dangerous thing you
might do under the influence of MDA
that you wouldn't do otherwise would be
to hug or kiss someone.
I can find no logic in a policy that out
laws MDA and leaves alcohol as the one
and only legal mind-altering substance, a
drug that is highly addictive, that causes
significant loss of self-control to the point
of loss of consciousness, that increases
violent behavior, that can have associated
memory loss and that kills brain cells.
As a drug, alcohol is one of the worst. I
can understand why its unique history in
this country makes it virtually impossible
to outlaw, but why wouldn't alcohol's
negative properties motivate the govern
ment to make more desirable alternatives
like MDA more readily available.
Even though I grant that there is some
logic in outlawing addictive substances,
there is no reasonable justification for
outlawing the nonaddictive drugs.
The government is using faulty rea
soning when it justifies campaigns
against such drugs by citing the problems
associated with crack cocaine. And to
have the only legal alternative be an
addictive drug that is as dangerous as
alcohol is beyond faulty reasoning — it's
lunacy.

Thus, I disagree in principle with those
who want to control highly addictive sub
stances, but I understand the logic behind
their reasoning. I feel that the federal
government, however, in its "just say no"
campaign against drugs violates not only
principle, but common sense as well.
Most absurd of all is the government's
"zero tolerance" of all drugs, independent
of their particular properties. Crack
cocaine is taken to be the prototypical
drug in setting drug policy, which makes
about as much sense as deciding how to
treat British citizens by assuming they
are all like Jack the Ripper.
Consider, for example, marijuana. One
if its most desirable qualities is that it can
be grown at home. Is there a better way to
undercut the "international drug cartel"
and reduce violent crime associated with
drug dealing than to have individuals pro
duce their own supply of drugs?
Yet the government uses the crime
associated with crack and crack dealing as
a way to justify its campaign against mar
ijuana users and growers.
My own personal favorite drug is a
substance called MDA, which has been
nicknamed "the love drug" because of its
primary effects, extreme euphoria and a
sense of liking everyone.
It has been extensively studied, it is
not addictive, no detrimental long-term

side effects have been recorded in the 50
years it has been studied.
About the most dangerous thing you
might do under the influence of MDA
that you wouldn't do otherwise would be
to hug or kiss someone.
I can find no logic in a policy that out
laws MDA and leaves alcohol as the one
and only legal mind-altering substance, a
drug that is highly addictive, that causes
significant loss of self-control to the point
of loss of consciousness, that increases
violent behavior, that can have associated
memory loss and that kills brain cells.
As a drug, alcohol is one of the worst. I
can understand why its unique history in
this country makes it virtually impossible
to outlaw, but why wouldn't alcohol's
negative properties motivate the govern
ment to make more desirable alternatives
like MDA more readily available.
Even though I grant that there is some
logic in outlawing addictive substances,
there is no reasonable justification for
outlawing the nonaddictive drugs.
The government is using faulty rea
soning when it justifies campaigns
against such drugs by citing the problems
associated with crack cocaine. And to
have the only legal alternative be an
addictive drug that is as dangerous as
alcohol is beyond faulty reasoning — it's
lunacy.

CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING
scenario: The Virginia Legislature
decides that universities receiving
state funding should no longer tolerate
homosexual activity on their campuses.
They pass a law stating that universi
ties will lose their funding by Dec. 1
unless they: 1) clearly prohibit such
activity on campus and at school func
tions, and 2) threaten to expel any stu
dent and fire any faculty or staff member
who violates the policy.
After all, homosexual activity is a
felony in Virginia, so why shouldn't the
government do everything it can to make
sure that our young people and those who
serve as their role models "just say no" to
gay sex?
This scenario is less far-fetched than
you might imagine. Virginia's anti
sodomy law is not some ancient statute
that is accidentally still on the books.
The Virginia Supreme Court decided a
few years ago that it is not a violation of
privacy for police to secretly observe and
videotape the activity in a locked stall of a
public bathroom if it helps them to elimi
nate homosexual activity there.
Gay bars are illegal in Virginia under a
clause that says that no bar shall be
granted a license to serve alcohol if it is a
known meeting place for gamblers, pros
titutes, drug dealers, homosexuals or
other criminals.
Getting back to my hypothetical uni
versity, suppose that the administration
caves in and has one of its lawyers draw
up a new "campus sexual activity policy"
that strictly prohibits homosexual sex on
campus and at campus events. What
advice would you give to the students, fac
ulty and staff?
Should gay people give in and abstain
from having sex? And if they refuse,
should their non-gay roommates and
friends be required to turn them in?
Should resident assistants and resident
fellows be expected to police the dorms
and enforce the policy?
My answer to all of these questions is
U_ _ »
no.

I firmly believe that government has
no right to interfere in any activity that
takes place in private between consenting
adults. Sexual activity, for example, may
be restricted by the government only if it
takes place in public, or one of the part
ners does not consent to the activity, or a
child is involved.
I do not, however, advocate capri
ciously disobeying laws.
Driving on a public street or highway,
for example, is a privilege, not a right.
When you disobey traffic regulations, you
endanger not only yourself, but also any
others who are driving on the same road.
Even driving on private property is not an
entirely private activity if gasoline is
burned, because such activity has an
effect on the environment and the avail
ability of gasoline.
I can find no rational justification for
speeding. The 55 mph speed limit was
intended partially to improve highway
safety but mostly to reduce national con
sumption of gasoline.
What right do I have to endanger oth
ers, to increase air pollution, to increase
our dependence on foreign oil and to
increase the probability of another Exxon
Valdez disaster by driving faster than 55?
As a result, I now drive 55. I may be
the only person I know who does, but my
gas mileage has improved significantly.
What about underage drinking?
According to my principle, the govern
ment has no authority to regulate drink
ing that takes place in private among con
senting adults.
I think that most Americans feel as I
do that the age of 18 is a reasonable
threshold to set for a legal definition of
adulthood. Eighteen-year-olds can vote,
can be drafted, are tried as adults when
they commit crimes and are expected to
be financially responsible for themselves.
It makes no sense to treat them as adults
in every respect but this one.
Thus, I believe that government has
no authority to prohibit drinking done in
private by those who are 18 or older. The
primary motivation for raising the drink
ing age to 21 was the reduction of high
way deaths due to teenage drinking.
While I think the goal is desirable and
the approach is logical, I do not believe
that the ends justify the means. It is per
fectly reasonable for the government to
outlaw drunk driving and to vigorously
pursue violators, but it may not infringe
on personal liberty to do so.
What about the use of drugs? Again,
according to my principle the government
has no authority to regulate what con

senting adults choose to do in private.
The counterargument is that drug use
affects more than just an individual
because it generates crime and addicts.
The crime argument is almost entirely
circular because drug laws generate most
such crime.
If drugs were decriminalized, drug
users and drug dealers (except those who
sell to children) would no longer be crim
inals, and the violence associated with
drug dealing would disappear when the
dealers found themselves unable to com
pete with cheaper and higher quality
drugs being sold along with beer and wine
at your local Safeway.
The addict argument is more complex.
If you are committed to the notion of a
welfare state, then you might very well be
concerned about the possibility that indi
viduals will become addicted to drugs.
I would personally rather die than
accept government welfare, so I find it
disturbing that people use this argument
to prevent me from using addictive drugs.
I am even more troubled, however, by
the fact that this argument has no practi
cal bounds. If recreational rock-climbing
is dangerous, why can't the welfare state
ban it so that it does not have to support
its victims?
Once you accept the addict argument,
you grant the government unlimited
power to limit your personal freedom. As
a result, I reject all such arguments. In
fact, I think this predicament is one of the

best arguments against the notion of a
welfare state.
Thus, I disagree in principle with those
who want to control highly addictive sub
stances, but I understand the logic behind
their reasoning. I feel that the federal
government, however, in its "just say no"

ment has no authority to regulate drink
ing that takes place in private among con
senting adults.
I think that most Americans feel as I
do that the age of 18 is a reasonable
threshold to set for a legal definition of
adulthood. Eighteen-year-olds can vote,
can be drafted, are tried as adults when
they commit crimes and are expected to
be financially responsible for themselves.
It makes no sense to treat them as adults
in every respect but this one.
Thus, I believe that government has
no authority to prohibit drinking done in
private by those who are 18 or older. The
primary motivation for raising the drink
ing age to 21 was the reduction of high
way deaths due to teenage drinking.
While I think the goal is desirable and
the approach is logical, I do not believe
that the ends justify the means. It is per
fectly reasonable for the government to
outlaw drunk driving and to vigorously
pursue violators, but it may not infringe
on personal liberty to do so.
What about the use of drugs? Again,
according to my principle the government
has no authority to regulate what con

senting adults choose to do in private.
The counterargument is that drug use
affects more than just an individual
because it generates crime and addicts.
The crime argument is almost entirely
circular because drug laws generate most
such crime.
If drugs were decriminalized, drug
users and drug dealers (except those who
sell to children) would no longer be crim
inals, and the violence associated with
drug dealing would disappear when the
dealers found themselves unable to com
pete with cheaper and higher quality
drugs being sold along with beer and wine
at your local Safeway.
The addict argument is more complex.
If you are committed to the notion of a
welfare state, then you might very well be
concerned about the possibility that indi
viduals will become addicted to drugs.
I would personally rather die than
accept government welfare, so I find it
disturbing that people use this argument
to prevent me from using addictive drugs.
I am even more troubled, however, by
the fact that this argument has no practi
cal bounds. If recreational rock-climbing
is dangerous, why can't the welfare state
ban it so that it does not have to support
its victims?
Once you accept the addict argument,
you grant the government unlimited
power to limit your personal freedom. As
a result, I reject all such arguments. In
fact, I think this predicament is one of the

best arguments against the notion of a
welfare state.
Thus, I disagree in principle with those
who want to control highly addictive sub
stances, but I understand the logic behind
their reasoning. I feel that the federal
government, however, in its "just say no"
campaign against drugs violates not only
principle, but common sense as well.
Most absurd of all is the government's
"zero tolerance" of all drugs, independent
of their particular properties. Crack
cocaine is taken to be the prototypical
drug in setting drug policy, which makes
about as much sense as deciding how to
treat British citizens by assuming they
are all like Jack the Ripper.
Consider, for example, marijuana. One
if its most desirable qualities is that it can
be grown at home. Is there a better way to
undercut the "international drug cartel"
and reduce violent crime associated with
drug dealing than to have individuals pro
duce their own supply of drugs?
Yet the government uses the crime
associated with crack and crack dealing as
a way to justify its campaign against mar
ijuana users and growers.
My own personal favorite drug is a
substance called MDA, which has been
nicknamed "the love drug" because of its
primary effects, extreme euphoria and a
sense of liking everyone.
It has been extensively studied, it is
not addictive, no detrimental long-term

side effects have been recorded in the 50
years it has been studied.
About the most dangerous thing you
might do under the influence of MDA
that you wouldn't do otherwise would be
to hug or kiss someone.
I can find no logic in a policy that out
laws MDA and leaves alcohol as the one
and only legal mind-altering substance, a
drug that is highly addictive, that causes
significant loss of self-control to the point
of loss of consciousness, that increases
violent behavior, that can have associated
memory loss and that kills brain cells.
As a drug, alcohol is one of the worst. I
can understand why its unique history in
this country makes it virtually impossible
to outlaw, but why wouldn't alcohol's
negative properties motivate the govern
ment to make more desirable alternatives
like MDA more readily available.
Even though I grant that there is some
logic in outlawing addictive substances,
there is no reasonable justification for
outlawing the nonaddictive drugs.
The government is using faulty rea
soning when it justifies campaigns
against such drugs by citing the problems
associated with crack cocaine. And to
have the only legal alternative be an
addictive drug that is as dangerous as
alcohol is beyond faulty reasoning — it's
lunacy.
