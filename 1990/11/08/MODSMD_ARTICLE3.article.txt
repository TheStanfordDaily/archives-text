# More 'repositioning' challenges to face new facilities head
## 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
When Dennis Culp, a colonel in the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, ends 26
years as an Army officer and steps into
the new position of associate vice presi
dent for facilities, his transition will mark
the beginning of a new job experience for
him.
But, for the Office of Administrative
Resources, his arrival on Dec. 1 will be
only a part of a grander scheme of reposi
tioning and restructuring that began last

year and will continue until September,
1991.
In fulfilling his part of the big picture,
Culp will be responsible for the overall
management of the design, construction,
operation and maintenance of campus
facilities and grounds. He will report to
Su Schaffer, vice president for adminis
trative resources.
Culp's new position resulted from the
restructuring of Operations and Mainte
nance and Facilities Project Management.
The position of Operations and Mainte
nance director was eliminated, so the var

ious managers there will report directly
to Culp, as will the director of Facilities,
who used to report to Schaffer.
When Administrative Resources began
concrete plans to cut 15 percent from
Operations and Maintenance's $14 mil
lion budget, administrators decided to
merge it with Facilities offices and elimi
nate its director position.
The directorship was left vacant when
former Director Ralph Buchanan was
fired in April. Schaffer said she relieved
Buchanan of his duties because she
doubted his ability to guide the office

through repositioning.
Consolidation "was a good way to
streamline" the offices, according to
Alana Wilson, human resources manager
in Administrative Resources.
Culp's background and experience
Culp, who is a 1964 graduate of the
U.S. Military Academy at West Point,
earned a master's in civil engineering
from MIT and a master's in political sci
ence from the University of Kansas. He is
a registered professional engineer in
Washington and a fellow of the Society of

American Military Engineers.
Culp has been both a faculty member
and administrator at MIT and the Uni
versity of Kansas and has held a number
of high-ranking positions in the Corps of
Engineers.
At various times, he has been the Chief
Executive Officer for the Army's Depart
ment of Engineering and Transportation,
an inspector for military installations in
many parts of the world and a manager of
a 4,000-person operations office.
