# More 'repositioning' challenges to face new facilities head
## 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
When Dennis Culp, a colonel in the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, ends 26
years as an Army officer and steps into
the new position of associate vice presi
dent for facilities, his transition will mark
the beginning of a new job experience for
him.
But, for the Office of Administrative
Resources, his arrival on Dec. 1 will be
only a part of a grander scheme of reposi
tioning and restructuring that began last

year and will continue until September,
1991.
In fulfilling his part of the big picture,
Culp will be responsible for the overall
management of the design, construction,
operation and maintenance of campus
facilities and grounds. He will report to
Su Schaffer, vice president for adminis
trative resources.
Culp's new position resulted from the
restructuring of Operations and Mainte
nance and Facilities Project Management.
The position of Operations and Mainte
nance director was eliminated, so the var

ious managers there will report directly
to Culp, as will the director of Facilities,
who used to report to Schaffer.
When Administrative Resources began
concrete plans to cut 15 percent from
Operations and Maintenance's $14 mil
lion budget, administrators decided to
merge it with Facilities offices and elimi
nate its director position.
The directorship was left vacant when
former Director Ralph Buchanan was
fired in April. Schaffer said she relieved
Buchanan of his duties because she
doubted his ability to guide the office

through repositioning.
Consolidation "was a good way to
streamline" the offices, according to
Alana Wilson, human resources manager
in Administrative Resources.
Culp's background and experience
Culp, who is a 1964 graduate of the
U.S. Military Academy at West Point,
earned a master's in civil engineering
from MIT and a master's in political sci
ence from the University of Kansas. He is
a registered professional engineer in
Washington and a fellow of the Society of

American Military Engineers.
Culp has been both a faculty member
and administrator at MIT and the Uni
versity of Kansas and has held a number
of high-ranking positions in the Corps of
Engineers.
At various times, he has been the Chief
Executive Officer for the Army's Depart
ment of Engineering and Transportation,
an inspector for military installations in
many parts of the world and a manager of
a 4,000-person operations office.
Currently, Culp is the deputy
commander of the Corps of Engi
neers South Pacific Division,
which encompasses California,
Utah, Nevada and Arizona.
He has been responsible for
planning and program manage
ment of meyor flood control pro
jects and has directed manage
ment of engineering and construc
tion at 32 military installations in
his division's four states. The lat
ter project averaged $300 million
of construction each year and
ranged from space launch facili
ties at Vandenburg Air Force base
to small maintenance efforts and
master planning projects.
Starting the new job
Culp said one of his personal
goals for his new job is "to see the
organization become a team."
"We want to meet the expecta
tions of our customers," he added.
"That doesn't mean we'll give
them everything they want. If
their expectations are too high, we
must be able to convince them
their expectations are toO high."
Culp said his path to the posi
tion was a roundabout one. He
had a friend on the East Coast
who was asked by another engi
neer if he had any friends who
would be interested in the Stan
ford position. The friend men
tioned Culp's name.
When Culp saw the job descrip
tion, he said he called it"the ideal
match" for his experience and
abilities. But what started out as a
good match, he said, became even
better when he met more people
at Stanford.
According to Wilson, Culp is
"an excellent manager and an
expert engineer with many years
of experience" who is "very open
and self-assured." She added that
Culp is "very participative" and
will include many other peoples'
opinions in making his decisions.
Wilson said the search for asso
ciate vice president was launched
in the middle of last summer and

was coordinated by a national
search firm. The firm talked to "a
couple hundred" people which it
decided met the proper qualifica
tions.
Of these candidates, Wilson
said, Administrative Resources
conducted 26 interviews and
decided upon Culp.
Restructuring O&M
For the colonel, the Stanford
environment may be unfamiliar
territory. But he is not alone.
Operations and Maintenance and
Facilities Project Management
employees are also venturing into
unfamiliar territory because of
the many changes that have taken
place in the two offices due to
repositioning.
The history behind the cre
ation of Culp's position began in
April. Buchanan, who had been
the director of Operations and
Maintenance for five years, was
relieved of his duties by SchafTer
on April 5.
Buchanan, in a memo to Schaf
fer, said that she had told him he
"did not have the abilities to lead
Operations and Maintenance
through the repositioning pro
cess" and that it would be "dis
ruptive" for him to stay as direc
tor.
SchafTer then gave Buchanan
the choice of resigning or being
fired. In a meeting, Buchanan
refused to resign, and SchafTer
fired him. Buchanan appealed his
dismissal to University President
Donald Kennedy in two discus
sions in late April, but was not
reinstated.
Many members of the United
Stanford Workers said they felt
they had lost one of their
strongest advocates in the admin
istration. According to USW field
representative Michael Tatham,
the USW could communicate eas
ily with Buchanan, even though
they didn't always see "eye-to
eye" with him.
Tatham, field representative
Rodney Barnette and former
steward Linda Crouse have all
claimed that SchafTer is insensi
tive to workers' needs.
However, SchafTer said in an

April interview that she is aware
of the feelings of the workers and
that the firing was "a private, per
sonal matter."
Tatham said he thought Schaf
fer's decision wasn't merely based
on personal matters. He said
SchafTer is "tiying to change the
philosophy" in Administrative
Resources by filling upper-level
positions with "people who think
like her."
SchafTer was ill yesterday and
could not be reached for com
ment. However, Wilson said Culp
has a "good track record" with
union workers in previous jobs
and will try to create a good work
ing relationship with the USW.
Tatham said the USW will try
to establish a dialogue with Culp
once he arrives.
In Buchanan's absence, day-to
day management of Operations
and Maintenance was carried out
by William Witscher, senior man
agement associate of Manage
ment and Financial Planning.
Witscher will stay on for the next
few months to assist Culp with
the transition and to oversee repo
sitioning efforts now under way.
According to Wilson, employ
ees at all levels in the two offices
were involved in discussions
about how the offices would
implement repositioning changes.
Administrative Resources' plan
was to eliminate 84 positions out
of the two offices' combined 350
employees. Of these, Wilson said,
31 positions were already vacant.
Of the remaining 53 employ
ees, 22 have received layoff
notices and have either left the
University or found other posi
tions on campus. Between now
and September 1991, Wilson said,
31 more employees will be laid off.
"We were careful not to elimi
nate only lower-level positions,"
she said.
However, Tatham said the
USW was angered that Adminis
trative Resources was "axing jobs
on the bottom" and "speeding up
the work" of those in other low
level positions
He said the USW "is a little bit
disturbed that the University cre
ates new positions" while lower
level people are being laid off.

Administrative Resources' plan
was to eliminate 84 positions out
of the two offices' combined 350
employees. Of these, Wilson said,
31 positions were already vacant.
Of the remaining 53 employ
ees, 22 have received layoff
notices and have either left the
University or found other posi
tions on campus. Between now
and September 1991, Wilson said,
31 more employees will be laid off.
"We were careful not to elimi
nate only lower-level positions,"
she said.
However, Tatham said the
USW was angered that Adminis
trative Resources was "axing jobs
on the bottom" and "speeding up
the work" of those in other low
level positions
He said the USW "is a little bit
disturbed that the University cre
ates new positions" while lower
level people are being laid off.
When Dennis Culp, a colonel in the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, ends 26
years as an Army officer and steps into
the new position of associate vice presi
dent for facilities, his transition will mark
the beginning of a new job experience for
him.
But, for the Office of Administrative
Resources, his arrival on Dec. 1 will be
only a part of a grander scheme of reposi
tioning and restructuring that began last

year and will continue until September,
1991.
In fulfilling his part of the big picture,
Culp will be responsible for the overall
management of the design, construction,
operation and maintenance of campus
facilities and grounds. He will report to
Su Schaffer, vice president for adminis
trative resources.
Culp's new position resulted from the
restructuring of Operations and Mainte
nance and Facilities Project Management.
The position of Operations and Mainte
nance director was eliminated, so the var

ious managers there will report directly
to Culp, as will the director of Facilities,
who used to report to Schaffer.
When Administrative Resources began
concrete plans to cut 15 percent from
Operations and Maintenance's $14 mil
lion budget, administrators decided to
merge it with Facilities offices and elimi
nate its director position.
The directorship was left vacant when
former Director Ralph Buchanan was
fired in April. Schaffer said she relieved
Buchanan of his duties because she
doubted his ability to guide the office

through repositioning.
Consolidation "was a good way to
streamline" the offices, according to
Alana Wilson, human resources manager
in Administrative Resources.
Culp's background and experience
Culp, who is a 1964 graduate of the
U.S. Military Academy at West Point,
earned a master's in civil engineering
from MIT and a master's in political sci
ence from the University of Kansas. He is
a registered professional engineer in
Washington and a fellow of the Society of

American Military Engineers.
Culp has been both a faculty member
and administrator at MIT and the Uni
versity of Kansas and has held a number
of high-ranking positions in the Corps of
Engineers.
At various times, he has been the Chief
Executive Officer for the Army's Depart
ment of Engineering and Transportation,
an inspector for military installations in
many parts of the world and a manager of
a 4,000-person operations office.
Currently, Culp is the deputy
commander of the Corps of Engi
neers South Pacific Division,
which encompasses California,
Utah, Nevada and Arizona.
He has been responsible for
planning and program manage
ment of meyor flood control pro
jects and has directed manage
ment of engineering and construc
tion at 32 military installations in
his division's four states. The lat
ter project averaged $300 million
of construction each year and
ranged from space launch facili
ties at Vandenburg Air Force base
to small maintenance efforts and
master planning projects.
Starting the new job
Culp said one of his personal
goals for his new job is "to see the
organization become a team."
"We want to meet the expecta
tions of our customers," he added.
"That doesn't mean we'll give
them everything they want. If
their expectations are too high, we
must be able to convince them
their expectations are toO high."
Culp said his path to the posi
tion was a roundabout one. He
had a friend on the East Coast
who was asked by another engi
neer if he had any friends who
would be interested in the Stan
ford position. The friend men
tioned Culp's name.
When Culp saw the job descrip
tion, he said he called it"the ideal
match" for his experience and
abilities. But what started out as a
good match, he said, became even
better when he met more people
at Stanford.
According to Wilson, Culp is
"an excellent manager and an
expert engineer with many years
of experience" who is "very open
and self-assured." She added that
Culp is "very participative" and
will include many other peoples'
opinions in making his decisions.
Wilson said the search for asso
ciate vice president was launched
in the middle of last summer and

was coordinated by a national
search firm. The firm talked to "a
couple hundred" people which it
decided met the proper qualifica
tions.
Of these candidates, Wilson
said, Administrative Resources
conducted 26 interviews and
decided upon Culp.
Restructuring O&M
For the colonel, the Stanford
environment may be unfamiliar
territory. But he is not alone.
Operations and Maintenance and
Facilities Project Management
employees are also venturing into
unfamiliar territory because of
the many changes that have taken
place in the two offices due to
repositioning.
The history behind the cre
ation of Culp's position began in
April. Buchanan, who had been
the director of Operations and
Maintenance for five years, was
relieved of his duties by SchafTer
on April 5.
Buchanan, in a memo to Schaf
fer, said that she had told him he
"did not have the abilities to lead
Operations and Maintenance
through the repositioning pro
cess" and that it would be "dis
ruptive" for him to stay as direc
tor.
SchafTer then gave Buchanan
the choice of resigning or being
fired. In a meeting, Buchanan
refused to resign, and SchafTer
fired him. Buchanan appealed his
dismissal to University President
Donald Kennedy in two discus
sions in late April, but was not
reinstated.
Many members of the United
Stanford Workers said they felt
they had lost one of their
strongest advocates in the admin
istration. According to USW field
representative Michael Tatham,
the USW could communicate eas
ily with Buchanan, even though
they didn't always see "eye-to
eye" with him.
Tatham, field representative
Rodney Barnette and former
steward Linda Crouse have all
claimed that SchafTer is insensi
tive to workers' needs.
However, SchafTer said in an

April interview that she is aware
of the feelings of the workers and
that the firing was "a private, per
sonal matter."
Tatham said he thought Schaf
fer's decision wasn't merely based
on personal matters. He said
SchafTer is "tiying to change the
philosophy" in Administrative
Resources by filling upper-level
positions with "people who think
like her."
SchafTer was ill yesterday and
could not be reached for com
ment. However, Wilson said Culp
has a "good track record" with
union workers in previous jobs
and will try to create a good work
ing relationship with the USW.
Tatham said the USW will try
to establish a dialogue with Culp
once he arrives.
In Buchanan's absence, day-to
day management of Operations
and Maintenance was carried out
by William Witscher, senior man
agement associate of Manage
ment and Financial Planning.
Witscher will stay on for the next
few months to assist Culp with
the transition and to oversee repo
sitioning efforts now under way.
According to Wilson, employ
ees at all levels in the two offices
were involved in discussions
about how the offices would
implement repositioning changes.

like her."
SchafTer was ill yesterday and
could not be reached for com
ment. However, Wilson said Culp
has a "good track record" with
union workers in previous jobs
and will try to create a good work
ing relationship with the USW.
Tatham said the USW will try
to establish a dialogue with Culp
once he arrives.
In Buchanan's absence, day-to
day management of Operations
and Maintenance was carried out
by William Witscher, senior man
agement associate of Manage
ment and Financial Planning.
Witscher will stay on for the next
few months to assist Culp with
the transition and to oversee repo
sitioning efforts now under way.
According to Wilson, employ
ees at all levels in the two offices
were involved in discussions
about how the offices would
implement repositioning changes.
Administrative Resources' plan
was to eliminate 84 positions out
of the two offices' combined 350
employees. Of these, Wilson said,
31 positions were already vacant.
Of the remaining 53 employ
ees, 22 have received layoff
notices and have either left the
University or found other posi
tions on campus. Between now
and September 1991, Wilson said,
31 more employees will be laid off.
"We were careful not to elimi
nate only lower-level positions,"
she said.
However, Tatham said the
USW was angered that Adminis
trative Resources was "axing jobs
on the bottom" and "speeding up
the work" of those in other low
level positions
He said the USW "is a little bit
disturbed that the University cre
ates new positions" while lower
level people are being laid off.
