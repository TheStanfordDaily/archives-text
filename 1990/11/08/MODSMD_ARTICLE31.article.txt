## Card overcomes astonishing performance by Bears 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
BERKELEY, Calif. - Last
night Stanford volleyball fans had
a chance to sit down, kick their
shoes off, and watch the Cardinal
women on cable television.
Stanford was playing Califor
nia, a team the Cardinal has dom
inated for some time, and those
who turned the match on around
8:30 p.m. last night got to see
exactly what they expected: an
easy three-game sweep.
But they didn't see the entire
story.

No one expected too much
excitement from a match between
the Golden Bears and the team
that had defeated them 15 consec
utive times.
But after an hour of volleyball
at Harmon Gym last night, Cal led
the third-ranked Cardinal 15-12,
16-14. Stanford, which had just
attained that lofty ranking the
day before, finally managed to
cool off the Bears and salvaged a
12-15, 14-16, 15-5, 15-7, 15-5 vic
tory.
The win marked the third time
this season the Cardinal had come
back from two games down to win

on the road.
Stanford defeated then-No. 7
Illinois after losing the first two
games and trailing 7-0 in the third
in Champaign, and turned a simi
lar trick on then-No. 4 Universty
of the Pacific after dropping
games one and two in Stockton
last week.
Stanford clinched a second
place finish in the Pacific 10 Con
ference with the win, and the
team is now 20-3 overall and 14-2
in league. Cal set a school record
with its ninth consecutive loss,
falling to 6-17. The Bears are all
alone in last place in the Pac-10 at

2-14.
But for two games they looked
like a top-10 team. They hit, they
blocked, they dug and they served.
And they served. And then they
served some more.
"In the first two games we were
just waiting to win," junior Jen
nifer Jackson said. "They did the
one thing they could do. which is

serve out of their minds. ... It
was a combination of their serving
out of their minds and us, instead
of bouncing back after a good
serve, getting tentative."
The first game was even
throughout, until the Bears
scored the last two points for the
victory. Stanford appeared to
rebound in game two, jumping out
to a 10-3 lead, but it didn't last.
The Cardinal still led 14-9
when Cal's senior setter Sara Alli
son went back to serve. Ace. Cal
kill. Ace. Stanford miscue. Stan
ford net. Ace. Cal kill.
Seven serves, seven Cal points.
And the result was a 2-0 lead for
the Golden Bears. Cal, which had
managed to win only two games
from Stanford in the teams' last
12 matches, had doubled that win
total in just over an hour.
"They served about as tough as
anyone has served us all season,"
coach Don Shaw said. "And they
combined it with great defense.
(Lisa) Arce came up with a lot of
amazing balls.
"We talked and we settled down
in the break. . . . We came out
strong and when you get into
matches like that with a team that
isn't used to winning, they don't
think they can win."
The Bears, surging with confi
dence in the first two games,
seemed to start thinking about
what they were doing in the third
game. Instead of playing free and
easy, they tensed up a bit and
Stanford upped its level of play. "I
don't want to take anything away
from Cal," Shaw said. "They
played great. If they could've con
tinued with that we could have
been tagged with a loss, but they
got tentative."
Behind improved defense and
the hitting of Kristin Klein and
Amy Cooper, the Cardinal
stormed their hosts in the final
three games. Klein finished with
25 kills and a .371 hitting perc
etage while Cooper had 17 kills
hitting at a .439 clip.
Bev Oden added 19 kills and six
blocks; Jessica Benton recorded
12 kills and five blocks, and setter

Carrie Feldman chipped in 53
assists, two aces and a team-high
12 digs.
Arce led the Bears with 20 kills,
nine assists and 19 digs. Allison
had nine kills, 53 assists, five aces
and 17 digs. Lynn Patrick added
19 kills and freshman Car a Dane
had 17.
Stanford jumped out to a 7-1
lead in game three and coasted the
rest of the way. Jackson then
opened game four by serving eight
consecutive points and the match
was tied soon thereafter.
Stanford took a 5-1 lead in
game five, but when Cal closed to
5-4, the fans got back into the
match. But Stanford ran out the
match allowing only one more
point.
One bright point in the first
two games was the return of
sophomore outside hitter Kristi
Paaso to the court. Paaso was a
starter the second half of last year
and started the team's first three
matches this season.
She hurt her back two days
after that third match, however,
and when her back finally allowed
her to practice, she sprained her
ankle. But after a 60-day layoff
from intercollegiate competition,
she played sparingly at the end of
games one and two.
Paaso is competing with Jack
son, who has started the team's
last 20 matches in that spot, and
freshman Danielle Everett, who
has been the team's first player
off the bench. Last night Jackson
started slowly and Everett played
most of the first two games, but
Jackson came back in game three
and finished out the contest.
"Jack didn't start out playing
very well," Shaw said. "Third
game we just decided to go with
the starters and Jack just did a
great job after that."
For the match, Cal had three
more kills, two more aces, two
more digs and three fewer blocks
than Stanford. But while those
stats were almost exactly equal,
Bear hitters made 47 errors while

The No. 3 Cardinal rode a 5-match winning streak into Harmon Gym last night against the Pac-10 cellar-dwelling Golden Bears. The
California team turned in its best performance of the year, taking the first two games before the stunned Stanford spikers could recover
their composure to win the last three games and the match.
