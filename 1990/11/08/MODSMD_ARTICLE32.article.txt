# Polls, schmolls â€” the Earnest Proposal is the answer
## 
### 
In yesterday's Daily my colleague Dave
Hirning argued against the outdated
poll and bowl system of deciding who's
the best team in college football.
"There's got to be a better way to fig
ure out college football's national cham
pion," he lamented, because "If this sea
son has taught us anything ... it is that
yesterday's prom queen is today's
wallflower."
Well, I know just how to weed out the
wallflowers. I have the solution to this
mess.
Institute a playoff system for collegiate
football.
Revolutionary, you're saying sarcasti
cally if you're still reading this.
Never will college athletic programs
agree to a playoff system as long as the
bowl games, with their large television
contracts, provide lucrative payouts to
teams. As long as conferences like the
Southeastern Conference, the Big Ten
and our own beloved Pacific 10 continue
their allegiance to the bowls to which they
are contractually bound, playoffs will
never occur.
I True. I concede these points.
But the times, they are a-changin'.
Since the mid-1980s, college football
has been losing its share of television rev
enues and bowl payouts due to the decline
of the NCAA as a regulatory body of the
sport. A Supreme Court decision in 1984
ruled that the NCAA could not negotiate

television contracts for individual college
football programs. This encouraged
schools to seek television contracts
directly from the various networks.
Many of the top football schools,
mostly members of the 64-school College
Football Association, supported the case
against the NCAA, hoping to get more
lucrative television deals. In fact, only one
school, Notre Dame, has clearly benefit
ted from the television ruling.
Otherwise, the ruling has adversely
affected college football. Because the
NCAA could no longer regulate television
contracts, it stopped arbitrarily limiting
the number of bowl games out of fear of
court action. Since 1984, the number of
bowl games has grown to 19, eight of
which are played on New Year's Day. That
has saturated the television market, con
sequently lowering the size of revenues
for the networks and the payouts to
teams.
Declining revenues have forced the
bowl games to seek corporate sponsor
ship, which has temporarily solved their
financial problems but has yet to prove it
can survive a national economic down
swing. My guess is that the bowls won't
survive a recession.
So, as the payouts dwindle, the football
programs will seek out a new way to
increase their revenues. The answer, of
course, is an NCAA-sanctioned playoff
system which could spread the tourna

ment out over several weeks and negoti
ate a one- or two-network contract that
would pull in greater revenues.
Of course, that wouldn't appease the
Pac-10 and Big Ten. The two Rose Bowl
conferences have led the resistence to the
bowl system, largely because they still
have the most lucrative bowl game.
Here's where the Earnest Proposal
comes in. Rather than being forced to
decide which way is better, why can't we
have both the bowl games and the playoff
system?
The way I figure, it's not the bowl
games that the fans are upset with.
After all, almost everybody er\joys
sitting around on New Year's Day watch
ing some bowl or another. The problem,
as far as the national championship goes,
is the polls. The fact is that the polls are
highly subjective, based on the whims of
sports writers and college coaches. But
polls aside, fans love the bowls.
Likewise, the colleges love the prestige
and history of their bowl games, but they
really want more money. Fine. A bowl
game based playoff system sanctioned by
the NCAA will generate much more
moolah.
Just have a few of the games played a
couple of weeks earlier, get rid of a couple
of the podunk bowls, add a championship
game, and let the winners of the games
keep playing and keep earning. Everyone

will be happy, trust me.
This is the way I'd run the show if I
were in charge.
First, I'd let all the conferences main
tain their affiliation with their chosen
bowl game. The Big Eight champion will
play in the Orange Bowl, the SEC champ
in the Sugar Bowl, and the Southwest
Conference champ in the Cotton Bowl.
The Atlantic Coast Conference titlist
will play in the Florida Citrus Bowl, while
the Western Athletic Conference winner
will play in the Holiday Bowl. The Big
West Conference champion would play in
the California Bowl.
I'd give the Fiesta Bowl to a champion
of the independents since they put on
such a good show a couple years back
when Penn State defeated Miami for the
national championship.
Only the Rose Bowl, with the Pac-10
and Big Ten champions, will have two
teams already slated to play each other.
The other seven bowl games, which with

the Rose Bowl could be referred to collec
tively as the "Championship Bowls,"
would have seven lesser known bowls,
perhaps the "Challenger Bowls," provide
their conference champions with the
seven opponents needed to fill out the sec
ond round.
The eight winners of the Champi
onship Bowls would then play in a three
week, post-New Year's tournament to
determine the national champion, to be
awarded the Bear Bryant Trophy.
The Pac-10 and Big Ten would still
have the Rose Bowl. And teams which
kept winning would get better payouts,
just like the NCAA basketball tourney.
The bottom line, the amount of money
that the schools would walk away with,
favors this format.
Of course, there are still problems with
this system. Only 23 teams would get to
play in bowls instead of 38. Four bowl
games would be excluded from the for
mat. There is still subjectivity in the
selection of some of the bowl teams.
But the continuation of the bowl tradi
tions, increased revenues for the college
football teams and an uncontested colle
giate football national champion should
be incentive enough to create a playoff
system. It's better than the mess we have
now.
