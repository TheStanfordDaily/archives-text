# Martin, runners go for NCAAs
## 
### Uri Attia Staff writer 
Senior Jason Martin, today one
of Stanford's finest cross-country
runners, never particularly
wanted to select running as his
sport.
"I kind of stumbled into track,"
Martin said. "My parents always
believed that I should try as many
sports as possible and find out
what I was good at."
Fortunately for the Cardinal
team, he found his niche on the
track. He has been a varsity mem
ber of the cross country team each
of his three years running for
Stanford (he was redshirted last
year), and will play a critical role
in determining whether or not the
Cardinal will qualify for the
NCAA Championships on Novem
ber 19.
In order for Stanford to get
there it will have to outrace either
Arizona, Oregon, or Washington,
three teams that ran off with the
first three spots at the Pacific 10
Conference Championships, and
also hold off the rest of the field
this weekend at the District-8

Championship meet.
In 1989, the Stanford cross
country team took fourth at Pac
10s, behind the same three teams,
but then went on to finish third in
the District-8 meet, beating Ari
zona as Pac-10 champ Marc Davis
was sidelined with a foot ii\jury.
While third place last year was
not good enough to qualify for
Nationals, the West has been
given an additional berth at
NCAAs, so each of the top three
teams will make the trip to
Knoxville for the big race. Stan
ford will therefore look to repeat
last year's regional placing.
"While Arizona, Oregon, and
Washington are clearly the three
best teams in the region, we are

definitely next-best," Martin said.
"If any of those three falter, we'll
be there to beat them."
Martin, who has run anywhere
from first on the team to fourth,
also has considerable individual
goals for the race. "If we can't go
as a team, I want to qualify as an
individual," he said. "A lot of Stan
ford guyB have a chance."
To qualify individually, a run
ner must finish in the top three of
those not on a qualifying team.
That is, should the Ducks, Wild
cats, and Huskies be the teams
from the West going to Nationals,
then Martin would have to finish
in the top three runners who do
not hail from those universities in
order to qualify. Junior Dave Scu
damore, who finished first on the
Stanford team at Pac-lOs, placed
fourth among the remaining Pac
-10 teams.
At Pac-lOs Martin finished
fourth on the team with a time of
26:44, well off his personal best
set only three weeks before. The
1990 campaign has been marked
with periods of brilliance accom
panied by a number of races in
which it seemed obvious that Mar
tin was not even approaching his
potential as a runner.
His season began in disappoint
ing fashion at the Michigan State
Invitational, but was followed
soon thereafter by an impressive
race at the Ohio State Invita
tional, in which Martin took sec
ond in the meet to teammate Fred
Carter.
He continued improving by
taking first place on the team with
a 24:37 at the Stanford Invita
tional, good for sixth place among
the Pac-10 teams present. "I felt
great at that race," Martin said. "I
didn't feel stressed out at all, and
I kept with Marc Davis for the
first mile or so."
Martin's high school career fea
tured tremendous amounts of
success in cross-country, but
according to Martin, his greatest
achievement came while a student
at Stanford.
"In the summer between my
freshman and sophomore years
here, I ran for the U.S. Junior
National team in the
steeplechase," he said. "I barely
qualified for the team, but once I
got there I took 12th or 13th [in a
field of sixty] in the world." His
terrific performance at that meet
came despite having crashed into
a hurdle in the middle of the race.
"Some guy from Italy tripped,
hit the hurdle, and moved it about
a foot backwards," Martin said. "I
tried to stop, but couldn't and
crashed right into it. I got back up,
though, and had a good race."
Martin set a Stanford fresh
man record in the 3,000-meter
race.
Although he has another year
of eligibility remaining, he says
that he will forego it unless he
comes up with some more simi
larly brilliant performances. "If I
don't feel that I have the chance to
become a truly great runner, if I
don't give myself reason to believe
that, then I'll most likely gradu
ate."
If he does, he will be the only
one of Stanford's top seven who
will not return next year. Stan
ford's qualifying for nationals
next year has practically been
labeled a certainty.
It will be all the more certain if
Martin comes back to the Farm.

teams will make the trip to
Knoxville for the big race. Stan
ford will therefore look to repeat
last year's regional placing.
"While Arizona, Oregon, and
Washington are clearly the three
best teams in the region, we are

definitely next-best," Martin said.
"If any of those three falter, we'll
be there to beat them."
Martin, who has run anywhere
from first on the team to fourth,
also has considerable individual
goals for the race. "If we can't go
as a team, I want to qualify as an
individual," he said. "A lot of Stan
ford guyB have a chance."
To qualify individually, a run
ner must finish in the top three of
those not on a qualifying team.
That is, should the Ducks, Wild
cats, and Huskies be the teams
from the West going to Nationals,
then Martin would have to finish
in the top three runners who do
not hail from those universities in
order to qualify. Junior Dave Scu
damore, who finished first on the
Stanford team at Pac-lOs, placed
fourth among the remaining Pac
-10 teams.
At Pac-lOs Martin finished
fourth on the team with a time of
26:44, well off his personal best
set only three weeks before. The
1990 campaign has been marked
with periods of brilliance accom
panied by a number of races in
which it seemed obvious that Mar
tin was not even approaching his
potential as a runner.
His season began in disappoint
ing fashion at the Michigan State
Invitational, but was followed
soon thereafter by an impressive
race at the Ohio State Invita
tional, in which Martin took sec
ond in the meet to teammate Fred
Carter.
He continued improving by
taking first place on the team with
a 24:37 at the Stanford Invita
tional, good for sixth place among
the Pac-10 teams present. "I felt
great at that race," Martin said. "I
didn't feel stressed out at all, and
I kept with Marc Davis for the
first mile or so."
Martin's high school career fea
tured tremendous amounts of
success in cross-country, but
according to Martin, his greatest
achievement came while a student
at Stanford.
"In the summer between my
freshman and sophomore years
here, I ran for the U.S. Junior
National team in the
steeplechase," he said. "I barely
qualified for the team, but once I
got there I took 12th or 13th [in a
field of sixty] in the world." His
terrific performance at that meet
came despite having crashed into
a hurdle in the middle of the race.
"Some guy from Italy tripped,
hit the hurdle, and moved it about
a foot backwards," Martin said. "I
tried to stop, but couldn't and
crashed right into it. I got back up,
though, and had a good race."
Martin set a Stanford fresh
man record in the 3,000-meter
race.
Although he has another year
of eligibility remaining, he says
that he will forego it unless he
comes up with some more simi
larly brilliant performances. "If I
don't feel that I have the chance to
become a truly great runner, if I
don't give myself reason to believe
that, then I'll most likely gradu
ate."
If he does, he will be the only
one of Stanford's top seven who
will not return next year. Stan
ford's qualifying for nationals
next year has practically been
labeled a certainty.
It will be all the more certain if
Martin comes back to the Farm.
Senior Jason Martin, today one
of Stanford's finest cross-country
runners, never particularly
wanted to select running as his
sport.
"I kind of stumbled into track,"
Martin said. "My parents always
believed that I should try as many
sports as possible and find out
what I was good at."
Fortunately for the Cardinal
team, he found his niche on the
track. He has been a varsity mem
ber of the cross country team each
of his three years running for
Stanford (he was redshirted last
year), and will play a critical role
in determining whether or not the
Cardinal will qualify for the
NCAA Championships on Novem
ber 19.
In order for Stanford to get
there it will have to outrace either
Arizona, Oregon, or Washington,
three teams that ran off with the
first three spots at the Pacific 10
Conference Championships, and
also hold off the rest of the field
this weekend at the District-8

Championship meet.
In 1989, the Stanford cross
country team took fourth at Pac
10s, behind the same three teams,
but then went on to finish third in
the District-8 meet, beating Ari
zona as Pac-10 champ Marc Davis
was sidelined with a foot ii\jury.
While third place last year was
not good enough to qualify for
Nationals, the West has been
given an additional berth at
NCAAs, so each of the top three
teams will make the trip to
Knoxville for the big race. Stan
ford will therefore look to repeat
last year's regional placing.
