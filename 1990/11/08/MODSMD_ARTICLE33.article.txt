# Martin, runners go for NCAAs

### Uri Attia Staff writer 
Senior Jason Martin, today one
of Stanford's finest cross-country
runners, never particularly
wanted to select running as his
sport.
"I kind of stumbled into track,"
Martin said. "My parents always
believed that I should try as many
sports as possible and find out
what I was good at."
Fortunately for the Cardinal
team, he found his niche on the
track. He has been a varsity mem
ber of the cross country team each
of his three years running for
Stanford (he was redshirted last
year), and will play a critical role
in determining whether or not the
Cardinal will qualify for the
NCAA Championships on Novem
ber 19.
In order for Stanford to get
there it will have to outrace either
Arizona, Oregon, or Washington,
three teams that ran off with the
first three spots at the Pacific 10
Conference Championships, and
also hold off the rest of the field
this weekend at the District-8

Championship meet.
In 1989, the Stanford cross
country team took fourth at Pac
10s, behind the same three teams,
but then went on to finish third in
the District-8 meet, beating Ari
zona as Pac-10 champ Marc Davis
was sidelined with a foot ii\jury.
While third place last year was
not good enough to qualify for
Nationals, the West has been
given an additional berth at
NCAAs, so each of the top three
teams will make the trip to
Knoxville for the big race. Stan
ford will therefore look to repeat
last year's regional placing.
"While Arizona, Oregon, and
Washington are clearly the three
best teams in the region, we are

definitely next-best," Martin said.
"If any of those three falter, we'll
be there to beat them."
Martin, who has run anywhere
from first on the team to fourth,
also has considerable individual
goals for the race. "If we can't go
as a team, I want to qualify as an
individual," he said. "A lot of Stan
ford guyB have a chance."
To qualify individually, a run
ner must finish in the top three of
those not on a qualifying team.
That is, should the Ducks, Wild
cats, and Huskies be the teams
from the West going to Nationals,
then Martin would have to finish
in the top three runners who do
not hail from those universities in
order to qualify. Junior Dave Scu
damore, who finished first on the
Stanford team at Pac-lOs, placed
fourth among the remaining Pac
-10 teams.
At Pac-lOs Martin finished
fourth on the team with a time of
26:44, well off his personal best
set only three weeks before. The
1990 campaign has been marked
with periods of brilliance accom
