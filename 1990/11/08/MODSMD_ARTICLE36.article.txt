# Golfers return
## 
### Tyson Vaughan Editorial staff 
Whatever lingering hopes
the Cardinal golfers — men
and women — had of win
ning their UCLA-sponsored
tournaments were blown
away with utter finality by
ripping Palm Springs winds.
Both the UCLA Desert
Golf Classic and the Pioneer
Electronics Bruin Desert
Classic were halted yester
day because of the weather.
The final rounds were can
celled.
Both Stanford teams are
therefore left disappointed
with the results. The men
had improved from fifth to
fourth place and were hop
ing to jump at least another
notch on the final day. The
women fell from second to
fourth after an abysmal sec
ond day, and were looking to
redeem themselves.
