# Hoops tips off
## 
### Tyson Vaughan Editorial staff 
The Cardinal basketball
team is now undefeated with
a 1-0 record.
Yes! Hoops has begun,
sort of. The men's team
played its annual Cardinal
and White scrimmage last
night, with the Cardinal
team coming out on top.
Guard Peter Dukes
racked up 10 points to lead
the White team's offense.
The two teams will join in
Wonder Twin-like fashion to
form of the Stanford
Cardinal this Tuesday, Nov.
13. They will face the
Illawara Hawks in an exhibi
tion at Maples Pavilion.
