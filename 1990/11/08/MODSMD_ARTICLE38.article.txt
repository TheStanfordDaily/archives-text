What a difference a year can make.
1989: Stanford field hockey ends its season at 1-
13-3, finishing last in the four-team Northern Pacific
conference.
1990: The Cardinal goes 8-4-1 and 5-0-1 in the
Northern Pacific Conference, its best record in the
conference since 1975.
"The difference between last year and this year is
incredible", said senior Caroline Clevenger.
Today at 12 p.m., the women continue their
turnaround season in the NCAA playoffs. The Cardi
nal will take on the University of lowa in a first
round game in lowa City.
Ranked eighth nationally, the Hawkeyes (17-3)
are stronger than any team that Stanford has played
so far this year.
"We hope to give lowa a really good game", said
Clevenger. "Realistically, we probably won't win. But
this is not to say that we're counting ourselves out of
the picture."
Indeed, if the field hockey club had intended to
count itself out, they would have never begun the
season. After the 1989 finish, the worst in Stanford
history, the program was relegated to the "Varsity 3"
level by then-Athletic Director Andy Geiger. While
the team still existed, all previous scholarship fund
ing was taken away because of departmental budget
cuts.
The Cardinal's comeback this year has been aided
by a tenacious defense. Led by junior Katy Filner
and senior tri-captains Clevenger, Patricia McJennet
and Clare Stephens, Stanford has given up an
average of under 1.5 goals a game (0.5 in NorPac).
According to coach Sheryl Johnson, a win today
would involve a more balanced game plan. "We need
our strong defense", stressed the coach, in her sixth
year at Stanford. "But we also need to score. You
can't win without scoring."
A victory today would pit the team against No. 1
Northwestern on Sunday. This match, however, is
the last thing on Johnson's mind. "If we're going to
be successful, we've got to take this (tournament)
one game at a time."
After overcoming the setbacks of 1989 so suc
cesssfully, advancing in the NCAA tournament is
more icing on the cake.

Stanford's field hockey team has bucked the odds this season, going 5-0-1 In NorPac
play to earn an NCAA tournament bid despite last year's drastic budget cuts. Although
the NorPac is not a particularly strong conference, the Cardinal players think they can
get at least to the second round, where they would likely have to face No. 1
Northwestern.
