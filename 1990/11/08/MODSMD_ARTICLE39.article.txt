# INTERMISSION
## THE 						STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAIN Matt Groening TV's famous underachiever 
### John Louie Editorial staff 
. ■ ight years ago, for fl
Matt Groening,
was hell. 7
After serving as stu- h
dent body president of
his high school and
\ spending four years at the
no-grade, no-required- \
course Evergreen State Col
lege, Groening (pronounced
GRAY-nine) left the sereni-

ty of the Pacific Northwest for Los Ange
les .. . and hated it.
Sure, the product of his frustrations, a
comic strip called "Life Is Hell" quickly
became a cult classic in the pages of the |
Los Angeles Reader For Groening, "Life"
was black and white, two-dimensional,
and teeming with cynical rabbits.
It wasn't until 1987 that Greening's
other project, "The Simpsons," was creat
ed, catapulting the underground car-

toonist's work into the living rooms of
audiences across the country.
By the time the feuding family
came to primetime in January 1990, j
"The Simpsons" was not just a show I

— it was a phenomenon.
Now in its second season on the
Fox Broadcasting Network, "The

Simpsons" garners competitive, top-ten
ratings despite being aired in only half as
many cities as its rival "The Cosby Show."

It unites a loyal following of Simpsonmaniacs, primarily
from the college crowd, at numerous television sets every
Thursday night. And though its characters are confined to the
two dimensions of animation, It's hard to find a more "human"
family than "The Simpsons."

Liie may not be strictly "Hell" anymore for Groening, now
married and father to his one-year old son, Homer. But as the
surrogate father of Bart Simpson, life is still pretty hellish. Inter
mission caught up with Matt Groening last week in Los
Angeles.

Intermission: How long have you been car
tooning?
J Matt Groening: I've been cartooning all my
life, from the first day of first grade.

I: Did your childhood experiences help to
shape "Life In Hell"?
MG: At Evergreen State College, you didn't

have any of the distractions and the relentless
busy work that characterizes most colleges. Some
people took advantage of it by not doing much, but
most of us loved it. When I moved to Los Angeles

in 1977, I hated it here. So I made up a little
comic book for my friends back home in Wash
ington called "Life Is Hell."

I: Were all the characters the same at that
time?
MG: Basically just the rabbits. They're all in
my new book, "The Big Book of Hell." It's a
large-sized collection from the previous five
books, as well as a bunch of new illustrations.
I: Is it getting harder for you to do "Life in Hell"

now that you're working on "The Simpsons?"
MG: Now, I have to work all night to do "Life in Hell." It's
become a lot harder because I'm getting older I'm a lot more
tired now that I'm 36.

I: Let's talk about "The Simpsons." How many people are
involved in creating each episode?
MG: There are 80 animators here in L.A. and 200 in Korea.
We're doing 24 episodes for this season; right now we're just
starting work on the twenty-third show, which will be done six
months from now. Plus, we're in various stages of all the other
shows.

I: Who's actually responsible for creating the five Simp
sons?

MG: I came up with the main characters. They're
named after members of my family My family
doesn't act like the Simpsons, thank God. But

there's a little bit of Bart in me ; I used to get in
trouble in school.

, UIV 11A C>VIIUWI.
I: In the opening segment, there
are always different things about
► the animation; Bart's always
writing a different message on
the chalkboard, and the family
always does something weird

on the sofa at the end. Why do you I
pay attention to those details? *
MG: What I like are the little details
that reward those who pay attention.

Most of television does not reward you ; it
penalizes you because if you don't pay
attention it doesn't matter.

My show is full of that kind of stuff. The
nature of animation is that you can control
every aspect of the sound and visuals. It's more
fun if you throw in stuff. When you work on
something fox; so long, you want to put in those
little details.

I: Before the season even began, Los Angeles Tunes tele
vision critic Howard Rosenberg said last week's episode, the
"three-eyed mutant fish"
show, was one of the

best of the season. J
Do you feel the need J
to deal with politi- '
cal issues in your
shows?

MG:We're not only try
ing not to repeat other
TV shows, and we're
trying not to repeat our
selves. The show goes in
rcry strange directions.

Davis — Dally
I'm a guy who lucked out by
falling into it; TV was not supposed
to be my careen I think I bring a dif
ferent vision to television than
most people who work in television
because I'm not in awe of the
industry. Which is not to say that
the show is all mine; the show is
definitely a collaboration of minds.
I: What's in store for future
episodes?
MG: In the future, we'll have a lot
of guest stars that will contribute
guest voices, but 1 can't tell you
who. It's not true that Whoopi
Goldberg will do the voice of Mag
gie when she first speaks. Many,
many rumors are always written
about the Simpsons. The charac
ters will certainly be changing in

the future. They'll grow emotional
ly if not physically.
I: There's a store in Los Angeles
called "Simpsonsmania," com
pletely devoted to the show. Do you
feel like you have already over
whelmed the market for "Simp
sons" stuff?
MG: I'm from a background in
underground cartooning. My
friends and I used to sit around and
scheme how to sneak into the
media and get our ideas out there.
Now, I'm happy with the way
things have been turning out, as far
as the marketing phenomena is
concerned. I work on all the mer
chandise, designing and writing,
right down to the pinball machine.
To be able to design a bendable
three-dimensional figurine based
on a character I've been drawing in
two dimensions is a blast. I'd
rather people buy a Bart Simpson
doll than another Garfield.

'I guess student gov
ernment run by a
cartoon character is
no sillier than student
government as it is
now.'

I: Does it bother you that people
are pirating "Simpsons" memora
bilia?
MG: Well, the phenomenon of a
pop cultural icon taking on its own
life fascinates me, especially now
since I created the icon. The
money ripoff aspect doesn't bug me
enough to pursue it. Some of the t
shirts are good and some are pieces
of crap. I don't get outraged when I
see a guy wearing a pirated t-shirt;
there are lots of other injustices in
the world that take priority over
mine.

I: Do you think Simpsons are on
the downhill now?
MG: It's die nature of any pop fad
to eventually become less fashion
able. It's not my concern to keep
[the fad] fresh; we just try and do
the best and funniest show we can
by amusing ourselves. I didn't work
on the show to create a pop phe
nomenon; I've just gone along with
the ride. But I hope we can keep the
show alive for a long long time.
I: Does it bother you that "The
Simpsons" doesn't win its time slot
because the show is broadcast to
limited audiences?
MG: Our popularity depends on
how you look at the statistics. We
do great in actual numbers of peo
ple who watch television shows.
For example, it doesn't tell you
about dorm audiences, in which we
do well. The only thing I regret
about being against "Cosby" is that

they both seem to be good shows.
With so little good stuff on televi
sion, it's too bad for audiences who
have to make a choice. But ratings
are not that important to me, just
barely interesting.
I: Do people recognize you now
that you've broken out of under
ground cartooning and created this
pop icon?
MG: Yeah, sometimes. It's a little
unsettling because I feel like a
movie star, but generally everyone's

friendly about it.
I: Were you surprised that Bart
Simpson won a spot on Stanford's
graduate senate during last year's
student body elections?
MG: I was behind sending the tele
gram to Stanford saying Bart would
run for President in 1992. I was
surprised, but I probably shouldn't
have been. I guess student govern
ment run by a cartoon character is
no sillier than student government
as it is now.

► the animation; Bart's always
writing a different message on
the chalkboard, and the family
always does something weird

on the sofa at the end. Why do you I
pay attention to those details? *
MG: What I like are the little details
that reward those who pay attention.

Most of television does not reward you ; it
penalizes you because if you don't pay
attention it doesn't matter.

My show is full of that kind of stuff. The
nature of animation is that you can control
every aspect of the sound and visuals. It's more
fun if you throw in stuff. When you work on
something fox; so long, you want to put in those
little details.

I: Before the season even began, Los Angeles Tunes tele
vision critic Howard Rosenberg said last week's episode, the
"three-eyed mutant fish"
show, was one of the

best of the season. J
Do you feel the need J
to deal with politi- '
cal issues in your
shows?

MG:We're not only try
ing not to repeat other
TV shows, and we're
trying not to repeat our
selves. The show goes in
rcry strange directions.

Davis — Dally
I'm a guy who lucked out by
falling into it; TV was not supposed
to be my careen I think I bring a dif
ferent vision to television than
most people who work in television
because I'm not in awe of the
industry. Which is not to say that
the show is all mine; the show is
definitely a collaboration of minds.
I: What's in store for future
episodes?
MG: In the future, we'll have a lot
of guest stars that will contribute
guest voices, but 1 can't tell you
who. It's not true that Whoopi
Goldberg will do the voice of Mag
gie when she first speaks. Many,
many rumors are always written
about the Simpsons. The charac
ters will certainly be changing in

the future. They'll grow emotional
ly if not physically.
I: There's a store in Los Angeles
called "Simpsonsmania," com
pletely devoted to the show. Do you
feel like you have already over
whelmed the market for "Simp
sons" stuff?
MG: I'm from a background in
underground cartooning. My
friends and I used to sit around and
scheme how to sneak into the
media and get our ideas out there.
Now, I'm happy with the way
things have been turning out, as far
as the marketing phenomena is
concerned. I work on all the mer
chandise, designing and writing,
right down to the pinball machine.
To be able to design a bendable
three-dimensional figurine based
on a character I've been drawing in
two dimensions is a blast. I'd
rather people buy a Bart Simpson
doll than another Garfield.

'I guess student gov
ernment run by a
cartoon character is
no sillier than student
government as it is
now.'

I: Does it bother you that people
are pirating "Simpsons" memora
bilia?
MG: Well, the phenomenon of a
pop cultural icon taking on its own
life fascinates me, especially now
since I created the icon. The
money ripoff aspect doesn't bug me
enough to pursue it. Some of the t
shirts are good and some are pieces
of crap. I don't get outraged when I
see a guy wearing a pirated t-shirt;
there are lots of other injustices in
the world that take priority over
mine.

I: Do you think Simpsons are on
the downhill now?
MG: It's die nature of any pop fad
to eventually become less fashion
able. It's not my concern to keep
[the fad] fresh; we just try and do
the best and funniest show we can
by amusing ourselves. I didn't work
on the show to create a pop phe
nomenon; I've just gone along with
the ride. But I hope we can keep the
show alive for a long long time.
I: Does it bother you that "The
Simpsons" doesn't win its time slot
because the show is broadcast to
limited audiences?
MG: Our popularity depends on
how you look at the statistics. We
do great in actual numbers of peo
ple who watch television shows.
For example, it doesn't tell you
about dorm audiences, in which we
do well. The only thing I regret
about being against "Cosby" is that

they both seem to be good shows.
With so little good stuff on televi
sion, it's too bad for audiences who
have to make a choice. But ratings
are not that important to me, just
barely interesting.
I: Do people recognize you now
that you've broken out of under
ground cartooning and created this
pop icon?
MG: Yeah, sometimes. It's a little
unsettling because I feel like a
movie star, but generally everyone's

friendly about it.
I: Were you surprised that Bart
Simpson won a spot on Stanford's
graduate senate during last year's
student body elections?
MG: I was behind sending the tele
gram to Stanford saying Bart would
run for President in 1992. I was
surprised, but I probably shouldn't
have been. I guess student govern
ment run by a cartoon character is
no sillier than student government
as it is now.
. ■ ight years ago, for fl
Matt Groening,
was hell. 7
After serving as stu- h
dent body president of
his high school and
\ spending four years at the
no-grade, no-required- \
course Evergreen State Col
lege, Groening (pronounced
GRAY-nine) left the sereni-

ty of the Pacific Northwest for Los Ange
les .. . and hated it.
Sure, the product of his frustrations, a
comic strip called "Life Is Hell" quickly
became a cult classic in the pages of the |
Los Angeles Reader For Groening, "Life"
was black and white, two-dimensional,
and teeming with cynical rabbits.
It wasn't until 1987 that Greening's
other project, "The Simpsons," was creat
ed, catapulting the underground car-

toonist's work into the living rooms of
audiences across the country.
By the time the feuding family
came to primetime in January 1990, j
"The Simpsons" was not just a show I

— it was a phenomenon.
Now in its second season on the
Fox Broadcasting Network, "The

Simpsons" garners competitive, top-ten
ratings despite being aired in only half as
many cities as its rival "The Cosby Show."

It unites a loyal following of Simpsonmaniacs, primarily
from the college crowd, at numerous television sets every
Thursday night. And though its characters are confined to the
two dimensions of animation, It's hard to find a more "human"
family than "The Simpsons."

Liie may not be strictly "Hell" anymore for Groening, now
married and father to his one-year old son, Homer. But as the
surrogate father of Bart Simpson, life is still pretty hellish. Inter
mission caught up with Matt Groening last week in Los
Angeles.

Intermission: How long have you been car
tooning?
J Matt Groening: I've been cartooning all my
life, from the first day of first grade.

I: Did your childhood experiences help to
shape "Life In Hell"?
MG: At Evergreen State College, you didn't

have any of the distractions and the relentless
busy work that characterizes most colleges. Some
people took advantage of it by not doing much, but
most of us loved it. When I moved to Los Angeles

in 1977, I hated it here. So I made up a little
comic book for my friends back home in Wash
ington called "Life Is Hell."

I: Were all the characters the same at that
time?
MG: Basically just the rabbits. They're all in
my new book, "The Big Book of Hell." It's a
large-sized collection from the previous five
books, as well as a bunch of new illustrations.
I: Is it getting harder for you to do "Life in Hell"

now that you're working on "The Simpsons?"
MG: Now, I have to work all night to do "Life in Hell." It's
become a lot harder because I'm getting older I'm a lot more
tired now that I'm 36.

I: Let's talk about "The Simpsons." How many people are
involved in creating each episode?
MG: There are 80 animators here in L.A. and 200 in Korea.
We're doing 24 episodes for this season; right now we're just
starting work on the twenty-third show, which will be done six
months from now. Plus, we're in various stages of all the other
shows.

I: Who's actually responsible for creating the five Simp
sons?

MG: I came up with the main characters. They're
named after members of my family My family
doesn't act like the Simpsons, thank God. But

there's a little bit of Bart in me ; I used to get in
trouble in school.

on the show to create a pop phe
nomenon; I've just gone along with
the ride. But I hope we can keep the
show alive for a long long time.
I: Does it bother you that "The
Simpsons" doesn't win its time slot
because the show is broadcast to
limited audiences?
MG: Our popularity depends on
how you look at the statistics. We
do great in actual numbers of peo
ple who watch television shows.
For example, it doesn't tell you
about dorm audiences, in which we
do well. The only thing I regret
about being against "Cosby" is that

they both seem to be good shows.
With so little good stuff on televi
sion, it's too bad for audiences who
have to make a choice. But ratings
are not that important to me, just
barely interesting.
I: Do people recognize you now
that you've broken out of under
ground cartooning and created this
pop icon?
MG: Yeah, sometimes. It's a little
unsettling because I feel like a
movie star, but generally everyone's

friendly about it.
I: Were you surprised that Bart
Simpson won a spot on Stanford's
graduate senate during last year's
student body elections?
MG: I was behind sending the tele
gram to Stanford saying Bart would
run for President in 1992. I was
surprised, but I probably shouldn't
have been. I guess student govern
ment run by a cartoon character is
no sillier than student government
as it is now.
. ■ ight years ago, for fl
Matt Groening,
was hell. 7
After serving as stu- h
dent body president of
his high school and
\ spending four years at the
no-grade, no-required- \
course Evergreen State Col
lege, Groening (pronounced
GRAY-nine) left the sereni-

ty of the Pacific Northwest for Los Ange
les .. . and hated it.
Sure, the product of his frustrations, a
comic strip called "Life Is Hell" quickly
became a cult classic in the pages of the |
Los Angeles Reader For Groening, "Life"
was black and white, two-dimensional,
and teeming with cynical rabbits.
It wasn't until 1987 that Greening's
other project, "The Simpsons," was creat
ed, catapulting the underground car-

toonist's work into the living rooms of
audiences across the country.
By the time the feuding family
came to primetime in January 1990, j
"The Simpsons" was not just a show I

— it was a phenomenon.
Now in its second season on the
Fox Broadcasting Network, "The

Simpsons" garners competitive, top-ten
ratings despite being aired in only half as
many cities as its rival "The Cosby Show."

It unites a loyal following of Simpsonmaniacs, primarily
from the college crowd, at numerous television sets every
Thursday night. And though its characters are confined to the
two dimensions of animation, It's hard to find a more "human"
family than "The Simpsons."

Liie may not be strictly "Hell" anymore for Groening, now
married and father to his one-year old son, Homer. But as the
surrogate father of Bart Simpson, life is still pretty hellish. Inter
mission caught up with Matt Groening last week in Los
Angeles.

Intermission: How long have you been car
tooning?
J Matt Groening: I've been cartooning all my
life, from the first day of first grade.

I: Did your childhood experiences help to
shape "Life In Hell"?
MG: At Evergreen State College, you didn't

have any of the distractions and the relentless
busy work that characterizes most colleges. Some
people took advantage of it by not doing much, but
most of us loved it. When I moved to Los Angeles

in 1977, I hated it here. So I made up a little
comic book for my friends back home in Wash
ington called "Life Is Hell."

I: Were all the characters the same at that
time?
MG: Basically just the rabbits. They're all in
my new book, "The Big Book of Hell." It's a
large-sized collection from the previous five
books, as well as a bunch of new illustrations.
I: Is it getting harder for you to do "Life in Hell"

now that you're working on "The Simpsons?"
MG: Now, I have to work all night to do "Life in Hell." It's
become a lot harder because I'm getting older I'm a lot more
tired now that I'm 36.

I: Let's talk about "The Simpsons." How many people are
involved in creating each episode?
MG: There are 80 animators here in L.A. and 200 in Korea.
We're doing 24 episodes for this season; right now we're just
starting work on the twenty-third show, which will be done six
months from now. Plus, we're in various stages of all the other
shows.

I: Who's actually responsible for creating the five Simp
sons?

MG: I came up with the main characters. They're
named after members of my family My family
doesn't act like the Simpsons, thank God. But

there's a little bit of Bart in me ; I used to get in
trouble in school.

, UIV 11A C>VIIUWI.
I: In the opening segment, there
are always different things about
► the animation; Bart's always
writing a different message on
the chalkboard, and the family
always does something weird

on the sofa at the end. Why do you I
pay attention to those details? *
MG: What I like are the little details
that reward those who pay attention.

Most of television does not reward you ; it
penalizes you because if you don't pay
attention it doesn't matter.

My show is full of that kind of stuff. The
nature of animation is that you can control
every aspect of the sound and visuals. It's more
fun if you throw in stuff. When you work on
something fox; so long, you want to put in those
little details.

I: Before the season even began, Los Angeles Tunes tele
vision critic Howard Rosenberg said last week's episode, the
"three-eyed mutant fish"
show, was one of the

best of the season. J
Do you feel the need J
to deal with politi- '
cal issues in your
shows?

MG:We're not only try
ing not to repeat other
TV shows, and we're
trying not to repeat our
selves. The show goes in
rcry strange directions.

Davis — Dally
I'm a guy who lucked out by
falling into it; TV was not supposed
to be my careen I think I bring a dif
ferent vision to television than
most people who work in television
because I'm not in awe of the
industry. Which is not to say that
the show is all mine; the show is
definitely a collaboration of minds.
I: What's in store for future
episodes?
MG: In the future, we'll have a lot
of guest stars that will contribute
guest voices, but 1 can't tell you
who. It's not true that Whoopi
Goldberg will do the voice of Mag
gie when she first speaks. Many,
many rumors are always written
about the Simpsons. The charac
ters will certainly be changing in

the future. They'll grow emotional
ly if not physically.
I: There's a store in Los Angeles
called "Simpsonsmania," com
pletely devoted to the show. Do you
feel like you have already over
whelmed the market for "Simp
sons" stuff?
MG: I'm from a background in
underground cartooning. My
friends and I used to sit around and
scheme how to sneak into the
media and get our ideas out there.
Now, I'm happy with the way
things have been turning out, as far
as the marketing phenomena is
concerned. I work on all the mer
chandise, designing and writing,
right down to the pinball machine.
To be able to design a bendable
three-dimensional figurine based
on a character I've been drawing in
two dimensions is a blast. I'd
rather people buy a Bart Simpson
doll than another Garfield.

'I guess student gov
ernment run by a
cartoon character is
no sillier than student
government as it is
now.'

I: Does it bother you that people
are pirating "Simpsons" memora
bilia?
MG: Well, the phenomenon of a
pop cultural icon taking on its own
life fascinates me, especially now
since I created the icon. The
money ripoff aspect doesn't bug me
enough to pursue it. Some of the t
shirts are good and some are pieces
of crap. I don't get outraged when I
see a guy wearing a pirated t-shirt;
there are lots of other injustices in
the world that take priority over
mine.

I: Do you think Simpsons are on
the downhill now?
MG: It's die nature of any pop fad
to eventually become less fashion
able. It's not my concern to keep
[the fad] fresh; we just try and do
the best and funniest show we can
by amusing ourselves. I didn't work
on the show to create a pop phe
nomenon; I've just gone along with
the ride. But I hope we can keep the
show alive for a long long time.
I: Does it bother you that "The
Simpsons" doesn't win its time slot
