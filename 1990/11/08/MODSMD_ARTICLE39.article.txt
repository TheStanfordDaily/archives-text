# INTERMISSION
## THE
						STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAIN Matt Groening TV's famous underachiever 
### John Louie Editorial staff 
. ■ ight years ago, for fl
Matt Groening,
was hell. 7
After serving as stu- h
dent body president of
his high school and
\ spending four years at the
no-grade, no-required- \
course Evergreen State Col
lege, Groening (pronounced
GRAY-nine) left the sereni-

ty of the Pacific Northwest for Los Ange
les .. . and hated it.
Sure, the product of his frustrations, a
comic strip called "Life Is Hell" quickly
became a cult classic in the pages of the |
Los Angeles Reader For Groening, "Life"
was black and white, two-dimensional,
and teeming with cynical rabbits.
It wasn't until 1987 that Greening's
other project, "The Simpsons," was creat
ed, catapulting the underground car-

toonist's work into the living rooms of
audiences across the country.
By the time the feuding family
came to primetime in January 1990, j
"The Simpsons" was not just a show I

— it was a phenomenon.
Now in its second season on the
Fox Broadcasting Network, "The

Simpsons" garners competitive, top-ten
ratings despite being aired in only half as
many cities as its rival "The Cosby Show."

It unites a loyal following of Simpsonmaniacs, primarily
from the college crowd, at numerous television sets every
Thursday night. And though its characters are confined to the
two dimensions of animation, It's hard to find a more "human"
family than "The Simpsons."

Liie may not be strictly "Hell" anymore for Groening, now
married and father to his one-year old son, Homer. But as the
surrogate father of Bart Simpson, life is still pretty hellish. Inter
mission caught up with Matt Groening last week in Los
Angeles.

Intermission: How long have you been car
tooning?
J Matt Groening: I've been cartooning all my
life, from the first day of first grade.

I: Did your childhood experiences help to
shape "Life In Hell"?
MG: At Evergreen State College, you didn't

have any of the distractions and the relentless
busy work that characterizes most colleges. Some
people took advantage of it by not doing much, but
most of us loved it. When I moved to Los Angeles

in 1977, I hated it here. So I made up a little
comic book for my friends back home in Wash
ington called "Life Is Hell."

I: Were all the characters the same at that
time?
MG: Basically just the rabbits. They're all in
my new book, "The Big Book of Hell." It's a
large-sized collection from the previous five
books, as well as a bunch of new illustrations.
I: Is it getting harder for you to do "Life in Hell"

now that you're working on "The Simpsons?"
MG: Now, I have to work all night to do "Life in Hell." It's
become a lot harder because I'm getting older I'm a lot more
tired now that I'm 36.

I: Let's talk about "The Simpsons." How many people are
involved in creating each episode?
MG: There are 80 animators here in L.A. and 200 in Korea.
We're doing 24 episodes for this season; right now we're just
starting work on the twenty-third show, which will be done six
months from now. Plus, we're in various stages of all the other
shows.

I: Who's actually responsible for creating the five Simp
sons?

MG: I came up with the main characters. They're
named after members of my family My family
doesn't act like the Simpsons, thank God. But

there's a little bit of Bart in me ; I used to get in
trouble in school.

, UIV 11A C>VIIUWI.
I: In the opening segment, there
are always different things about
► the animation; Bart's always
writing a different message on
the chalkboard, and the family
always does something weird

on the sofa at the end. Why do you I
pay attention to those details? *
MG: What I like are the little details
that reward those who pay attention.

Most of television does not reward you ; it
penalizes you because if you don't pay
attention it doesn't matter.

My show is full of that kind of stuff. The
nature of animation is that you can control
every aspect of the sound and visuals. It's more
fun if you throw in stuff. When you work on
something fox; so long, you want to put in those
little details.

I: Before the season even began, Los Angeles Tunes tele
vision critic Howard Rosenberg said last week's episode, the
"three-eyed mutant fish"
show, was one of the

best of the season. J
Do you feel the need J
to deal with politi- '
cal issues in your
shows?

MG:We're not only try
ing not to repeat other
TV shows, and we're
trying not to repeat our
selves. The show goes in
rcry strange directions.
