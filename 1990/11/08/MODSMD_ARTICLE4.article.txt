# Torn between two identities
## Gays gain new acceptance in religious communities

Mark Showalter and Frank
Yellin, his partner of two years,
found their domestic partnership
affirmed by their campus church
months before it was recognized
by the Stanford administration.
Showalter, a postdoctoral stu
dent in electrical engineering, and
Yellin, a former graduate student,
shared a marriage-like "commit
ment ceremony" at University
Lutheran Church last June. But it
wasn't until last month that the
new domestic partners policy fully

facilities.
University Lutheran Church is
one of the growing number of con

"Jim," a gay graduate student who
was raised a Southern Baptist and
currently belongs to University

Lutheran Church.
He said he has been criticized
by "some gay people because I
have religious beliefs and by some
religious people because I'm gay."
Often, he hears gays make
"generic put-downs" about reli
gion in general and Christianity in
particular, he said. He said these
attitudes are similar to the "great
deal of contempt for religion" he
finds in scientific circles.
"We often get caught in the
middle," said Daniel Sternbergh,
a graduate student in materials
science. Sternbergh, who is Epis
copalian, said people like himself,
"for whom our identity is no less
spiritual and religious than it is
gay or lesbian or bisexual," often
