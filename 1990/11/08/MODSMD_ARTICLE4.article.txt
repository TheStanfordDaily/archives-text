# Torn between two identities
## Gays gain new acceptance in religious communities 
### David Bianco Editorial staff 
Mark Showalter and Frank
Yellin, his partner of two years,
found their domestic partnership
affirmed by their campus church
months before it was recognized
by the Stanford administration.
Showalter, a postdoctoral stu
dent in electrical engineering, and
Yellin, a former graduate student,
shared a marriage-like "commit
ment ceremony" at University
Lutheran Church last June. But it
wasn't until last month that the
new domestic partners policy fully
gave Yellin access to University
facilities.
University Lutheran Church is
one of the growing number of con
gregations of all faiths that is tak

ing steps toward acceptance of
gays and lesbians.
The relationship between reli
gion and homosexuality hase been
a recurring theme at Stanford
recently in the ongoing debates
over policy issues such as domes
tic partners' benefits and theolog
ical issues such as gay clergy and
same-sex marriages.
Showalter and other religious
gays, lesbians and bisexuals repre
sent a bridge between two com
munities that have often, but not
always, been at odds with each
other. It's a hard role, some stu
dents in that category say.
"At times it seems like I'm crit
icized from both sides," said
"Jim," a gay graduate student who
was raised a Southern Baptist and
currently belongs to University

Lutheran Church.
He said he has been criticized
by "some gay people because I
have religious beliefs and by some
religious people because I'm gay."
Often, he hears gays make
"generic put-downs" about reli
gion in general and Christianity in
particular, he said. He said these
attitudes are similar to the "great
deal of contempt for religion" he
finds in scientific circles.
"We often get caught in the
middle," said Daniel Sternbergh,
a graduate student in materials
science. Sternbergh, who is Epis
copalian, said people like himself,
"for whom our identity is no less
spiritual and religious than it is
gay or lesbian or bisexual," often
end up the target of non-religious
gays' anger and resentment.
At the same time, Sternbergh
said, open gays and lesbians have
an important role to play in the
Episcopalian Church. He said the
issue is not whether gays have a
right to be in the Church. Instead,
the issue is what "contributions..
. we bring to the Church as
healthy gay people."
Religious alienated
Gay, lesbian and bisexual stu
dents who are religious sometimes
feel alienated in their spiritual
communities as well.
"Most religious traditions do
not smile on homosexuality," said
Rev. Robert Gregg, dean of the
chapel at Memorial Church.
Gregg pointed out that most
major world religions have
"sacred writings and community
regulations [with] very old prohi
bitions against homosexual acts."
For both Judaism and Chris
tianity, two of the most important
prohibitions come from the bibli
cal book of Leviticus. Rabbi Ari
Cartun, executive director of Hil
lel, a Jewish student organization,
said one of the verses that shapes
the traditional Jewish prohibition
against male homosexual acts is
Leviticus 20:13.
He offered the following trans
lation of the verse: "If a man has
intercourse with another man in
the same manner as with a
woman, both of them have com
mitted a perversion. They shall be
put to death."
Michelle Atkins, a leader of the
Intervarsity Christian Fellowship,
said she knows of no gays or les
bians in her group. "I'm sure that
there are folks who are struggling
with their sexuality," in the fel
lowship, she said. But she ques
tioned how far such members'
exploration of sexual identity
could develop.
What would happen if someone
did come out to the fellowship?
"To be honest, I'm sure the first

reaction would be somewhat of
shock," she said. "But I do think
that the folks who had been told
would really come around in sup
port of the person. I would expect
that they would be committed to
hearing the person out, listening
to their story, their experiences,
what their struggles have been,"
she said.
"I think the commitment
would be to continue loving this
person. But I do think it would be
in the context of encouraging
them out of that lifestyle," she
added.
Atkins said she thinks a gay
person would not be allowed a
leadership role in the group. "In
some sense, I guess you could say
that God doesn't approve of
homosexuality," she said.
But she said she it is sad that
"homosexuals are condemned
beyond people who struggle with
other forms of sin."
Gays and lesbians in Islam
According to one Moslem grad
uate student, homosexuality is
prohibited in Islam. "Islam
encourages people to repent and
stop doing it. The only sexual rela
tionship allowed in Islam is
through marriage between man
and woman."
Open displays of homosexual
ity are especially repugnant to
Islam, he says. "Only God knows
what happens behind walls. But
to come out openly to the commu
nity is a greater sin," he adds.
Gays who come out of the
closet "put the Moslems on the
spot," he says. Moslems have
what he calls "an obligation to
God almighty" to try to work
against, at least in their hearts,
acts forbidden by Islam.
He says that in an ideal Islamic
state, the courts order death as
the punishment for public acts of
homosexuality only when "you
have four witnesses that are sure
that they have seen the act of
homosexuality." He emphasized
that this is not applicable at all in
a non-Islamic state.
Not all religious groups are so
condemning of same-sex relation

ships, though. Gregg said that
witnin Judaism and Christianity,
"serious attention has been given
in recent decades to new under
standings of human relationships
and the integrity possible within
them. That has led to acceptance
of sexual relationships that do not
conform to the traditional hetero
sexual monogamous contract."
Judaism and gays
Some gay, lesbian and bisexual
Jews have found increasing accep
tance within the Jewish commu
nity. "At Hillel, we do not discrim
inate," Cartun said. "The presi
dent of our synagogue board last
year was an openly gay man."
That man is Charles Goldman,
a student at the Graduate School
of Business. Goldman said he has
"found a lot of respect even from
the most orthodox people. Offi
cially, Orthodox or traditional
Judaism denounces same-sex
acts, but I have never been con
demned as a person by any other
religious person."
Leila Wice, a Jewish woman
who is bisexual, said she has
found cooperation from both the
gay and Jewish communities in
her initiative to start a Jewish
women's literary discussion
group.
"I think that my enthusiasm
for Judaism is as a feminist," Wice
said. "A lot of what's happening in
terms of redefining Jewish law is
coming out of the gay and lesbian
community. So in a way, my iden
tities as a member of both com
munities support each other."
Wice, whose grandfather is a
rabbi in the more liberal Reform
movement within Judaism, said
the latest issue of that move
ment's journal carried a cover
which asked in large red letters,
"Can homosexual rabbis be Jew
ish role models?" She said she is
glad the issue is being discussed,
but disappointed such a question
even needs to be asked.
The Reform movement of
Judaism voted last June to recog
nize that there are gay rabbis and
not to let sexual orientation be a
barrier to ordination. Tonight,

Rabbi Sheldon Marder from the
Reform rabbinical school will
speak about that decision at the
School of Education in room 128
at 7:30 p.m.
Christian acceptance
Rev. Herb Schmidt, pastor of
University Lutheran Church,
called the type of commitment
ceremony that Showalter and
Yellin had at his church a "cele
bration of holy union." He said his
church is a "Reconciled in Christ
Congregation," meaning it is part
of a movement within
Lutheranism that "explicitly wel
comes gays and lesbians."
The acceptance of gays and les
bians has to do with "a sort of crit
ical biblical understanding,"
Schmidt said. "The prohibitions
against homosexual acts fre
quently have to do with idolatrous
practice. In the biblical world,
there was no understanding that
there were gays and lesbians by
their very nature," he added.
"God's love extends to all peo
ple regardless of sexual orienta

tion," Schmidt asserts.
Jim expressed sadness that
some gays haven't found the level
of comfort within religion that he
has. "I know a lot of gays from
fundamentalist churches who
lead these dual lives. I think it's
unfortunate that some people
have to live that way and they
can't find a place where they can
integrate their lives," he said.
On the other hand, Jim said, a
lot of gay people have abandoned
the church altogether. "They are
looking to fill a spiritual void," he
says. "They think that the church
rejects them."
But junior Toni Long, a lesbian
who is atheist, said she is still a
spiritual person. Still, "as a les
bian of color, for me to be Chris
tian I'd have to resolve a lot of
things within myself and within
the religion to find a harmonious
balance between the two."
Acceptance through tragedy
According to Sternbergh, his for
mer parish in Boston became
more accepting of gays as a result

'God's love
extends to all peo
ple regardless of
sexual orientation.'
— Rev. Herb Schmidt

of tragedy. "There were a large
number of gay people in the
parish. Most of the people in the
parish were aware of this, but
nothing was ever really made
explicit or obvious [about their
presence].
"When the first member of the
parish who came down with AIDS
was diagnosed and ended up
dying, his parents came from
Texas to his funeral.
"They had only just found out a
few weeks earlier that he was sick,
much less that he was gay and had
AIDS. Their official word was that
he died of lymphatic cancer. They
refused to even deal with the fact
that it was AIDS.
"That really hit a lot of us and
transformed a lot of us and, in
some sense, brought not only the
gay people in the parish closer
together, but the whole parish,
and it became a much more open
place as a result — much more
willing to speak about the con
cerns about all of the members,
including those of us who were
gay," Sternberg said.
Sometimes people choose tradi
tional religious lifestyles over sex
ual feelings. Cartun told a story
about a non-Jewish gay under
graduate several years ago who
was in love with a Jewish man.
"He came to me for conversion
to Judaism and continued his
studies and finished his conver
sion process to become a Conser
vative Jew — even though the
relationship broke up. Subse
quently, he decided to convert to
Orthodox and in the process
renounced homosexuality and
became straight. I have no idea
how he did it," Cartun said.

who is atheist, said she is still a
spiritual person. Still, "as a les
bian of color, for me to be Chris
tian I'd have to resolve a lot of
things within myself and within
the religion to find a harmonious
balance between the two."
Acceptance through tragedy
According to Sternbergh, his for
mer parish in Boston became
more accepting of gays as a result

'God's love
extends to all peo
ple regardless of
sexual orientation.'
— Rev. Herb Schmidt

of tragedy. "There were a large
number of gay people in the
parish. Most of the people in the
parish were aware of this, but
nothing was ever really made
explicit or obvious [about their
presence].
"When the first member of the
parish who came down with AIDS
was diagnosed and ended up
dying, his parents came from
Texas to his funeral.
"They had only just found out a
few weeks earlier that he was sick,
much less that he was gay and had
AIDS. Their official word was that
he died of lymphatic cancer. They
refused to even deal with the fact
that it was AIDS.
"That really hit a lot of us and
transformed a lot of us and, in
some sense, brought not only the
gay people in the parish closer
together, but the whole parish,
and it became a much more open
place as a result — much more
willing to speak about the con
cerns about all of the members,
including those of us who were
gay," Sternberg said.
Sometimes people choose tradi
tional religious lifestyles over sex
ual feelings. Cartun told a story
about a non-Jewish gay under
graduate several years ago who
was in love with a Jewish man.
"He came to me for conversion
to Judaism and continued his
studies and finished his conver
sion process to become a Conser
vative Jew — even though the
relationship broke up. Subse
quently, he decided to convert to
Orthodox and in the process
renounced homosexuality and
became straight. I have no idea
how he did it," Cartun said.


Doug Davis — Dally
Mark Showalter and Frank
Yellin, his partner of two years,
found their domestic partnership
affirmed by their campus church
months before it was recognized
by the Stanford administration.
Showalter, a postdoctoral stu
dent in electrical engineering, and
Yellin, a former graduate student,
shared a marriage-like "commit
ment ceremony" at University
Lutheran Church last June. But it
wasn't until last month that the
new domestic partners policy fully
gave Yellin access to University
facilities.
University Lutheran Church is
one of the growing number of con
gregations of all faiths that is tak

ing steps toward acceptance of
gays and lesbians.
The relationship between reli
gion and homosexuality hase been
a recurring theme at Stanford
recently in the ongoing debates
over policy issues such as domes
tic partners' benefits and theolog
ical issues such as gay clergy and
same-sex marriages.
Showalter and other religious
gays, lesbians and bisexuals repre
sent a bridge between two com
munities that have often, but not
always, been at odds with each
other. It's a hard role, some stu
dents in that category say.
"At times it seems like I'm crit
icized from both sides," said
"Jim," a gay graduate student who
was raised a Southern Baptist and
currently belongs to University

Lutheran Church.
He said he has been criticized
by "some gay people because I
have religious beliefs and by some
religious people because I'm gay."
Often, he hears gays make
"generic put-downs" about reli
gion in general and Christianity in
particular, he said. He said these
attitudes are similar to the "great
deal of contempt for religion" he
finds in scientific circles.
"We often get caught in the
middle," said Daniel Sternbergh,
a graduate student in materials
science. Sternbergh, who is Epis
copalian, said people like himself,
"for whom our identity is no less
spiritual and religious than it is
gay or lesbian or bisexual," often
end up the target of non-religious
gays' anger and resentment.
At the same time, Sternbergh
said, open gays and lesbians have
an important role to play in the
Episcopalian Church. He said the
issue is not whether gays have a
right to be in the Church. Instead,
the issue is what "contributions..
. we bring to the Church as
healthy gay people."
Religious alienated
Gay, lesbian and bisexual stu
dents who are religious sometimes
feel alienated in their spiritual
communities as well.
"Most religious traditions do
not smile on homosexuality," said
Rev. Robert Gregg, dean of the
chapel at Memorial Church.
Gregg pointed out that most
major world religions have
"sacred writings and community
regulations [with] very old prohi
bitions against homosexual acts."
For both Judaism and Chris
tianity, two of the most important
prohibitions come from the bibli
cal book of Leviticus. Rabbi Ari
Cartun, executive director of Hil
lel, a Jewish student organization,
said one of the verses that shapes
the traditional Jewish prohibition
against male homosexual acts is
Leviticus 20:13.
He offered the following trans
lation of the verse: "If a man has
intercourse with another man in
the same manner as with a
woman, both of them have com
mitted a perversion. They shall be
put to death."
Michelle Atkins, a leader of the
Intervarsity Christian Fellowship,
said she knows of no gays or les
bians in her group. "I'm sure that
there are folks who are struggling
with their sexuality," in the fel
lowship, she said. But she ques
tioned how far such members'
exploration of sexual identity
could develop.
What would happen if someone
did come out to the fellowship?
"To be honest, I'm sure the first

reaction would be somewhat of
shock," she said. "But I do think
that the folks who had been told
would really come around in sup
port of the person. I would expect
that they would be committed to
hearing the person out, listening
to their story, their experiences,
what their struggles have been,"
she said.
"I think the commitment
would be to continue loving this
person. But I do think it would be
in the context of encouraging
them out of that lifestyle," she
added.
Atkins said she thinks a gay
person would not be allowed a
leadership role in the group. "In
some sense, I guess you could say
that God doesn't approve of
homosexuality," she said.
But she said she it is sad that
"homosexuals are condemned
beyond people who struggle with
other forms of sin."
Gays and lesbians in Islam
According to one Moslem grad
uate student, homosexuality is
prohibited in Islam. "Islam
encourages people to repent and
stop doing it. The only sexual rela
tionship allowed in Islam is
through marriage between man
and woman."
Open displays of homosexual
ity are especially repugnant to
Islam, he says. "Only God knows
what happens behind walls. But
to come out openly to the commu
nity is a greater sin," he adds.
Gays who come out of the
closet "put the Moslems on the
spot," he says. Moslems have
what he calls "an obligation to
God almighty" to try to work
against, at least in their hearts,
acts forbidden by Islam.
He says that in an ideal Islamic
state, the courts order death as
the punishment for public acts of
homosexuality only when "you
have four witnesses that are sure
that they have seen the act of
homosexuality." He emphasized
that this is not applicable at all in
a non-Islamic state.
Not all religious groups are so
condemning of same-sex relation

ships, though. Gregg said that
witnin Judaism and Christianity,
"serious attention has been given
in recent decades to new under
standings of human relationships
and the integrity possible within
them. That has led to acceptance
of sexual relationships that do not
conform to the traditional hetero
sexual monogamous contract."
Judaism and gays
Some gay, lesbian and bisexual
Jews have found increasing accep
tance within the Jewish commu
nity. "At Hillel, we do not discrim
inate," Cartun said. "The presi
dent of our synagogue board last
year was an openly gay man."
That man is Charles Goldman,
a student at the Graduate School
of Business. Goldman said he has
"found a lot of respect even from
the most orthodox people. Offi
cially, Orthodox or traditional
Judaism denounces same-sex
acts, but I have never been con
demned as a person by any other
religious person."
Leila Wice, a Jewish woman
who is bisexual, said she has
found cooperation from both the
gay and Jewish communities in
her initiative to start a Jewish
women's literary discussion
group.
"I think that my enthusiasm
for Judaism is as a feminist," Wice
said. "A lot of what's happening in
terms of redefining Jewish law is
coming out of the gay and lesbian
community. So in a way, my iden
tities as a member of both com
munities support each other."
Wice, whose grandfather is a
rabbi in the more liberal Reform
movement within Judaism, said
the latest issue of that move
ment's journal carried a cover
which asked in large red letters,
"Can homosexual rabbis be Jew
ish role models?" She said she is
glad the issue is being discussed,
but disappointed such a question
even needs to be asked.
The Reform movement of
Judaism voted last June to recog
nize that there are gay rabbis and
not to let sexual orientation be a
barrier to ordination. Tonight,

Rabbi Sheldon Marder from the
Reform rabbinical school will
speak about that decision at the
School of Education in room 128
at 7:30 p.m.
Christian acceptance
Rev. Herb Schmidt, pastor of
University Lutheran Church,
called the type of commitment
ceremony that Showalter and
Yellin had at his church a "cele
bration of holy union." He said his
church is a "Reconciled in Christ
Congregation," meaning it is part
of a movement within
Lutheranism that "explicitly wel
comes gays and lesbians."
The acceptance of gays and les
bians has to do with "a sort of crit
ical biblical understanding,"
Schmidt said. "The prohibitions
against homosexual acts fre
quently have to do with idolatrous
practice. In the biblical world,
there was no understanding that
there were gays and lesbians by
their very nature," he added.
"God's love extends to all peo
ple regardless of sexual orienta

tion," Schmidt asserts.
Jim expressed sadness that
some gays haven't found the level
of comfort within religion that he
has. "I know a lot of gays from
fundamentalist churches who
lead these dual lives. I think it's
unfortunate that some people
have to live that way and they
can't find a place where they can
integrate their lives," he said.
On the other hand, Jim said, a
lot of gay people have abandoned
the church altogether. "They are
looking to fill a spiritual void," he
says. "They think that the church
rejects them."
But junior Toni Long, a lesbian
who is atheist, said she is still a
spiritual person. Still, "as a les
bian of color, for me to be Chris
tian I'd have to resolve a lot of
things within myself and within
the religion to find a harmonious

the latest issue of that move
ment's journal carried a cover
which asked in large red letters,
"Can homosexual rabbis be Jew
ish role models?" She said she is
glad the issue is being discussed,
but disappointed such a question
even needs to be asked.
The Reform movement of
Judaism voted last June to recog
nize that there are gay rabbis and
not to let sexual orientation be a
barrier to ordination. Tonight,

Rabbi Sheldon Marder from the
Reform rabbinical school will
speak about that decision at the
School of Education in room 128
at 7:30 p.m.
Christian acceptance
Rev. Herb Schmidt, pastor of
University Lutheran Church,
called the type of commitment
ceremony that Showalter and
Yellin had at his church a "cele
bration of holy union." He said his
church is a "Reconciled in Christ
Congregation," meaning it is part
of a movement within
Lutheranism that "explicitly wel
comes gays and lesbians."
The acceptance of gays and les
bians has to do with "a sort of crit
ical biblical understanding,"
Schmidt said. "The prohibitions
against homosexual acts fre
quently have to do with idolatrous
practice. In the biblical world,
there was no understanding that
there were gays and lesbians by
their very nature," he added.
"God's love extends to all peo
ple regardless of sexual orienta

tion," Schmidt asserts.
Jim expressed sadness that
some gays haven't found the level
of comfort within religion that he
has. "I know a lot of gays from
fundamentalist churches who
lead these dual lives. I think it's
unfortunate that some people
have to live that way and they
can't find a place where they can
integrate their lives," he said.
On the other hand, Jim said, a
lot of gay people have abandoned
the church altogether. "They are
looking to fill a spiritual void," he
says. "They think that the church
rejects them."
But junior Toni Long, a lesbian
who is atheist, said she is still a
spiritual person. Still, "as a les
bian of color, for me to be Chris
tian I'd have to resolve a lot of
things within myself and within
the religion to find a harmonious
balance between the two."
Acceptance through tragedy
According to Sternbergh, his for
mer parish in Boston became
more accepting of gays as a result

'God's love
extends to all peo
ple regardless of
sexual orientation.'
— Rev. Herb Schmidt

of tragedy. "There were a large
number of gay people in the
parish. Most of the people in the
parish were aware of this, but
nothing was ever really made
explicit or obvious [about their
presence].
"When the first member of the
parish who came down with AIDS
was diagnosed and ended up
dying, his parents came from
Texas to his funeral.
"They had only just found out a
few weeks earlier that he was sick,
much less that he was gay and had
AIDS. Their official word was that
he died of lymphatic cancer. They
refused to even deal with the fact
that it was AIDS.
"That really hit a lot of us and
transformed a lot of us and, in
some sense, brought not only the
gay people in the parish closer
together, but the whole parish,
and it became a much more open
place as a result — much more
willing to speak about the con
cerns about all of the members,
including those of us who were
gay," Sternberg said.
Sometimes people choose tradi
tional religious lifestyles over sex
ual feelings. Cartun told a story
about a non-Jewish gay under
graduate several years ago who
was in love with a Jewish man.
"He came to me for conversion
to Judaism and continued his
studies and finished his conver
sion process to become a Conser
vative Jew — even though the
relationship broke up. Subse
quently, he decided to convert to
Orthodox and in the process
renounced homosexuality and
became straight. I have no idea
how he did it," Cartun said.


Doug Davis — Dally
Mark Showalter and Frank
Yellin, his partner of two years,
found their domestic partnership
affirmed by their campus church
months before it was recognized
by the Stanford administration.
Showalter, a postdoctoral stu
dent in electrical engineering, and
Yellin, a former graduate student,
shared a marriage-like "commit
ment ceremony" at University
Lutheran Church last June. But it
wasn't until last month that the
new domestic partners policy fully
gave Yellin access to University
facilities.
University Lutheran Church is
one of the growing number of con
gregations of all faiths that is tak

ing steps toward acceptance of
gays and lesbians.
The relationship between reli
gion and homosexuality hase been
a recurring theme at Stanford
recently in the ongoing debates
over policy issues such as domes
tic partners' benefits and theolog
ical issues such as gay clergy and
same-sex marriages.
Showalter and other religious
gays, lesbians and bisexuals repre
sent a bridge between two com
munities that have often, but not
always, been at odds with each
other. It's a hard role, some stu
dents in that category say.
"At times it seems like I'm crit
icized from both sides," said
"Jim," a gay graduate student who
was raised a Southern Baptist and
currently belongs to University

Lutheran Church.
He said he has been criticized
by "some gay people because I
have religious beliefs and by some
religious people because I'm gay."
Often, he hears gays make
"generic put-downs" about reli
gion in general and Christianity in
particular, he said. He said these
attitudes are similar to the "great
deal of contempt for religion" he
finds in scientific circles.
"We often get caught in the
middle," said Daniel Sternbergh,
a graduate student in materials
science. Sternbergh, who is Epis
copalian, said people like himself,
"for whom our identity is no less
spiritual and religious than it is
gay or lesbian or bisexual," often
end up the target of non-religious
gays' anger and resentment.
At the same time, Sternbergh
said, open gays and lesbians have
an important role to play in the
Episcopalian Church. He said the
issue is not whether gays have a
right to be in the Church. Instead,
the issue is what "contributions..
. we bring to the Church as
healthy gay people."
Religious alienated
Gay, lesbian and bisexual stu
dents who are religious sometimes
feel alienated in their spiritual
communities as well.
"Most religious traditions do
not smile on homosexuality," said
Rev. Robert Gregg, dean of the
chapel at Memorial Church.
Gregg pointed out that most
major world religions have
"sacred writings and community
regulations [with] very old prohi
bitions against homosexual acts."
For both Judaism and Chris
tianity, two of the most important
prohibitions come from the bibli
cal book of Leviticus. Rabbi Ari
Cartun, executive director of Hil
lel, a Jewish student organization,
said one of the verses that shapes
the traditional Jewish prohibition
against male homosexual acts is
Leviticus 20:13.
He offered the following trans
lation of the verse: "If a man has
intercourse with another man in
the same manner as with a
woman, both of them have com
mitted a perversion. They shall be
put to death."
Michelle Atkins, a leader of the
Intervarsity Christian Fellowship,
said she knows of no gays or les
bians in her group. "I'm sure that
there are folks who are struggling
with their sexuality," in the fel
lowship, she said. But she ques
tioned how far such members'
exploration of sexual identity
could develop.
What would happen if someone
did come out to the fellowship?
"To be honest, I'm sure the first

reaction would be somewhat of
shock," she said. "But I do think
that the folks who had been told
would really come around in sup
port of the person. I would expect
that they would be committed to
hearing the person out, listening
to their story, their experiences,
what their struggles have been,"
she said.
"I think the commitment
would be to continue loving this
person. But I do think it would be
in the context of encouraging
them out of that lifestyle," she
added.
Atkins said she thinks a gay
person would not be allowed a
leadership role in the group. "In
some sense, I guess you could say
that God doesn't approve of
homosexuality," she said.
But she said she it is sad that
"homosexuals are condemned
beyond people who struggle with
other forms of sin."
Gays and lesbians in Islam
According to one Moslem grad
uate student, homosexuality is
prohibited in Islam. "Islam
encourages people to repent and
stop doing it. The only sexual rela
tionship allowed in Islam is
through marriage between man
and woman."
Open displays of homosexual
ity are especially repugnant to
Islam, he says. "Only God knows
what happens behind walls. But
to come out openly to the commu
nity is a greater sin," he adds.
Gays who come out of the
closet "put the Moslems on the
spot," he says. Moslems have
what he calls "an obligation to
God almighty" to try to work
against, at least in their hearts,
acts forbidden by Islam.
He says that in an ideal Islamic
state, the courts order death as
the punishment for public acts of
homosexuality only when "you
have four witnesses that are sure
that they have seen the act of
homosexuality." He emphasized
that this is not applicable at all in
a non-Islamic state.
Not all religious groups are so
condemning of same-sex relation

ships, though. Gregg said that
witnin Judaism and Christianity,
"serious attention has been given
in recent decades to new under
standings of human relationships
and the integrity possible within
them. That has led to acceptance
of sexual relationships that do not
conform to the traditional hetero
sexual monogamous contract."
Judaism and gays
Some gay, lesbian and bisexual
Jews have found increasing accep
tance within the Jewish commu
nity. "At Hillel, we do not discrim
inate," Cartun said. "The presi
dent of our synagogue board last
year was an openly gay man."
That man is Charles Goldman,
a student at the Graduate School
of Business. Goldman said he has
"found a lot of respect even from
the most orthodox people. Offi
cially, Orthodox or traditional
Judaism denounces same-sex
acts, but I have never been con
demned as a person by any other
religious person."
Leila Wice, a Jewish woman
who is bisexual, said she has
found cooperation from both the
gay and Jewish communities in
her initiative to start a Jewish
women's literary discussion
group.
"I think that my enthusiasm
for Judaism is as a feminist," Wice
said. "A lot of what's happening in
terms of redefining Jewish law is
coming out of the gay and lesbian
community. So in a way, my iden
tities as a member of both com
munities support each other."
Wice, whose grandfather is a
rabbi in the more liberal Reform
movement within Judaism, said
the latest issue of that move
ment's journal carried a cover
which asked in large red letters,
"Can homosexual rabbis be Jew
ish role models?" She said she is
