# Savoyards mix music and comedy in 'Pirates of Penzance’
## 
### Margaret Fitzpatrick 
The Stanford Savoyards' rock
ing production of "The Pirates of
Penzance" is sure to delight all
Gilbert and Sullivan fans for the
next two weekends at Dinkelspiel
Auditorium.
Adi Wyner leads the musically
talented cast of students and other
community members in this popu
lar comic opera. Wyner, a third year
doctoral candidate in statistics,
plays the role of Fredric, the Slave
of Duty.
"Pirates of Penzance" revolves
around Frederic's conflicting loyal
ties. Half of the time he feels obli
gated to follow the way of the
pirates, to whom he has been
apprenticed since he was eight.
The rest of the time he feels he
should exterminate the pirates in
order to avenge the evil they
allegedly perpetrate, and marry
darling Mabel.
The conflict between Fredric's
duty and desire becomes so convo
luted that only Gilbert could
resolve it.
Gilbert and Sullivan wrote this
play about pirates because their
□nous show, H.M.S. Pinafore,
been produced without copy
rights — known as "pirating" —
and distributed ail over the country
by the time they brought it to the
United States from England. Their

The humor is not
dated because mod
ern characters and
situations can easily
be substituted for
those In the play.

tendency to carry a premise too far
manifests itself throughout the
outrageous humor of the play.
"This is what the Keystone Kops
were based on," explained stage
manager Craig Fuget. The compar
ison becomes hilariously patent in
the second act when the chorus
deftly executes a fumbling police
men routine.
Fuget describes Gilbert's humor
as "irreverent enough to keep him
from getting knighted for several
decades." He says that the humor
is not dated because modern char
acters and situations can easily be
substituted for those in the play.
Associate producer and electri
cal engineer Neil Midkiff noted
that engineers, computer scientists
and lawyers are attracted to
Gilbert's word-puzzle humor.
Gilbert himself was a lawyer before
turning his talents to comic opera.
Mialciff also noted the eminent

"singableness" of Sullivan's music
which appeals to so many talented
amateurs. He explained that the
Stanford Savoyards have tradition
ally provided a rare outlet for this
musical genre as the Music
Department has not always been
able to fit operettas into the budget.
And nothing about the Savo
yards' performance is lacking.
Wyner carries off the goofy persona
of Frederic almost as though he
were born for the role. His clear,
mellifluous tenor is a real listening
pleasure.
Michele Anderson also charms
with a perfect pitch soprano and a
sweet, ditzy presence wnich is right
on key for the role of Mabel,
Fredric's love interest. And Richard
Feldman plays such a lusty, suave
Pirate King that you would never
guess he had taken over the role
only two weeks ago after his prede
cessor injured his foot.
Tb top it off, graduate Rafael
Ormes and Stanford law school
graduate Tyler Ochoa conduct the
thirty piece orchestra beautifully.

"The Pirates of Penzance" can be
seen in Dinkelspiel Auditorium on
Nov. 9-11, ana Nov. 16-17 at 8
p.m., and on Nov. 18 at 2:30 p.m.
