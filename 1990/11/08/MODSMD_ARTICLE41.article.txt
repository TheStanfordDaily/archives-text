## HIP HOT & HAPPENING 
### 
Roble's rockin' Ragtime
Stanford's self-proclaimed "newest tradition" — the Ragtime Ball
— which will hip, hop and happen Saturday in the Roble Dance
Studio, featuring daring dancers doing the Turkey Trot, the Grizzly
Bear, the Castle Walk, the Charleston and the Wicked Tango. The
12-piece Paul Price Society Orchestra provides the musical stylings.
Dance instruction begins at 8 p.m., with the regular program begin
ning at 9 p.m. Proceeds will benefit the Stanford Dance Division
Scholarship Fund. Call Roble Dance Studio for ticket information,
if there are any left.
Don't fear Anachrophobia
Be afraid of things that don't belong in that time period.
Whatever your phobias are, don't be scared away from buying
Gaieties 1990 tickets. Rumored to be the most consistently funny
— and shortest — show ever (or is that the Gaieties staff propagan
da machine working oh so well), the Stanford tradition is selling
tickets in White Plaza this week. So buy them. If you're not afraid.
Smothering the Brothers
Tom and Dick will debate what's good about Magnavox TVs in
an appearance at DeAnza College's Flint Center Saturday at 8 p.m.
In other words, the previously hip, hot and happening Smothers
Brothers, who have now been forced to beg for money doing corny
commercials, will amaze a packed audience with their music and
comedy variety show. It was canceled from TV, so here's your
chance to see it live. Call (408) 864-8671 for ticket information.
