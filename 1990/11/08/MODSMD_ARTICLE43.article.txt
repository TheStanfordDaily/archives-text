## ON THE TUBE Fresh Prince gives life to Bel Air 
### 
The originial concept brought to mind a
cross between "Different Strokes" and"The
Beverly Hillbillies." But "The Fresh Prince of Bel
Air" (NBC Mondays, 8 p.m.) turned out more
like a mix of "Mr. Belvedere" and "Family Ties."
Here's the concept: Philadelphia's The Fresh
Prince (Will Smith, as in DJ Jazzy Jeff and)
moves in with his aunt, uncle and family who
live in Bel Air. It's a candy-coated clash of cul
tures, not between black and white but between
wealthy blacks and poorer blacks.
The culture clash is never really explored in
the show, at least on a meaningful level, but the
cultural situation is used for occasional laughs.
On top of all the other distinctions, the fam
ily has an English butler named Geoffrey.
In Monday's show, the Prince thinks of the
perfect birthaav gift for the book-reading butler:
a date. Unable to find someone he thinks
Geoffrey would be interested in, the Prince sets
him up with his cousin's friend's nanny — who
happens to be from Britain.
Geoffrey initially objects to the Prince's
attempts to set him up, explaining to the Prince
that a butler should not get too involved with
the family. "Surely you've gleaned that much
from Mr. Belvedere," Geoffrey quips.
When the nanny turns out to be a beautiful
young woman of similar age to the Prince, the
Prince puts his interests over Geoffrey's and
tries to ruin the date.
Instead of having a slap-you-in-the-face
moral conclusion, like so many other sit corns,
the Fresh Prince makes the ending realistic and
funny, playing down the moral lesson.
While tne show sidesteps the culture clashes,
it does take several stabs at American pop cul
ture, besides the Mr. Belvedere comment.
When Geoffrey dresses up to go to the night
club in a brown three-piece suit, with a white
shirt and brown bow-tie, the Prince notes to
him: "You've got kind of a Ben Vereen thing
going here."
And his cousin Hillary, a less defined version
of "Family Ties" Mallory, points out the "A
crowd" at the club: "Tom Cruise's pool cleaner,
Cher's electrolysis, and Heather Locklear."
At times, die show drags on without the
Prince's presence. Although the other characters
are not negatives, they don't have the energy
and witty charm Smith provides as the Prince.
Overall, the show succeeds, making up for
occasional lapses with occasional periods of
ingenious hilarity.
