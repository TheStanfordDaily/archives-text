# Required distribution: A modest proposal revisited
## 
### 
The world is sure becoming compli
cated. Everything's controlled by com
puters. We have big bombs. You can
shop using your TV. Wilbur and Stem
will soon be on the point system.
Stanford, as part of its commitment
to excellence, is attempting to teach us
how to deal with all this tricky new
stuff. For this reasun, our loved and
revered system of distribution require
ments may soon change. In order "to
prepare a diverse student body for living
in an increasingly global society," sever
al new DR proposals have recently
cropped up.
Well, we think these proposals are
really great, but maybe they miss the
mark by a hair or two. In oraer to make
up for their deficiency, and to make
Stanford an even better place, we
humbly submit our own modest pro
posal.
The Grubb-Kronenfeld Plan calls for
an assortment of cores and DRs. The
student must complete either three
DRs subsumed within two core groups
in conjunction with a special project
contrasting and refurbishing their key
correlates, or specialize in a particular
core course and its relation to any two
of the last three DRs, when taken as an
aggregate with respect to the initial,
unused portion of the original cores.
Failure to comply with these guidelines
shall result in tiie immediate addition of
a penalty DR, to be satisfied by some
form of grueling physical challenge.
Our distribution and core require
ments will prepare the student for the
trials of real life after Stanford. In select
ing them, we have tried to assess the
national and world pictures critically.

Over breakfast, we tried to ascertain the
problem areas for the next century.
The Persian Gulf crisis, for example,
has uncovered serious flaws in our
country's transportation scheme. But
Stanford is already leading the way
toward fossil fuel freedom, without
actually realizing it. By setting aside our
car keys in favor of a well-tuned pair of
rollerblades, we can shed the yoke of oil
dependence. Certainly, rollerblading
today is nothing more than a nuisance,
with skate-jocks getting in the way as
they walk sideways up steps and crash
into bathroom stalls. But it is becoming
clear that tomorrow's leaders must be
as self-assured on their 'blades as they
are on the 'phone. Our first DR would
be a course in Rollerblade Technology.
Our most popular DR may well be
the course in Oral Interaction, affec
tionately dubbed Lip Stud. We have
George Bush to thank for this new DR.
In the future, when our heads of state
urge us to read their lips, we will be
ready. Stanford students shall hence
forth graduate with at least a rudimen
tary grasp of the fundamentals of hp
reading. And, as always, there will be
opportunities for further study and
research in this exciting, dynamic field.
In another field, the astonishing fuax
pas committed by our Band during their
Oregon trip was sure embarrasing, but
it did provide a valuable lesson. Never
do anything funny in Oregon. At least,
not on Saturday. We feel that this new
knowledge will help us to grow and
prosper throughout our long, rich lives.
So we made it a DR.
Our fourth DR will, no doubt, come
to be called the Bart Simpson DR,

although we certainly do not mean to
glorify the bug-eyed freak-child. No, we
are concerned about the rampant com
mercialization of trendy cartoon charac
ters. It's disgusting, but let's face it:
Somebody's making a lot of money off
this stuff A whole lot of money. We
need a piece of this action.
Trendy Product Creation (DR:4)
would give Stanford students the
knowledge they need to come up with
stupid little critters to adorn T-shirts,
beer mugs, etc. We're thinking maybe
Spotted Owl products (Spotted Owl
oven mitts, Spotted Owl car mats,
Spotted Owl chainsaws...)
Like the Faculty Senate, we too offer
core courses:
One apparently unstoppable global
trend is the Mac computer boom. These
little suckers are breeding like rodents.
To increase understanding of them, we
suggest an Apple Core.
Another area clearly in need of study
is the earth. After all, we live there. We
therefore devote an entire core course to
this planet of ours. It's the Earth's Core.
But there are parts of the earth gener
ally ignored in Stanford's canon. Only
30 percent of this planet's surface is
land, yet we devote 99.8 percent of our
courses to the study of land and land

based pursuits. We need to learn more
about the other 70 percent. We need a
Marine Core.
It is easy to get caught up in the
beauty and simplicity of our new sys
tem, but we should not forget that any
broadening of the distribution require
ments is always a threat to the engi
neering community here. These folks
have a lot of problems to solve in just
four years. They may not have time for
all these horizon-broadening activities.
While the Faculty Senate acknowl
edges the plight of the student engineer,
they have no solution. We offer a handy
alternative for the engineering student.
In our new order, the various DRs can
all be replaced by an optional core, the
Army Core (of Engineers).
Tnis arduous boot camp is designed
specifically for the engineer. The stu
dent is drilled rigorously in each of the
various distribution areas simultane
ously. Instructors, for example, may
give tests in which the class must read
er Homer Simpson's lips while purchas
ing Spotted Owl toothpicks on their
rollerblades. Somber field trips to
Oregon will be mandatory. The student
engineer will be delighted to hear that
the entire sequence can be completed in
10 days, with a couple of two-day fol
low-ups!
We are confident that the Grubb-
Kronenfeld plan will lead Stanford intel
ligently into its second century.

Paul Grubb and Daniel Kronenfeld are
koalas. They enjoy munching on the
leaves of the eucalyptus tree, and they
carry their young in pouches until
maturity.
