# He's no household name, but comic Fafhrd is heroic
## 
### John Louie Editorial staff 
Comic book heroes traditionally
have catchy names. Like Superman.
Spiderman. Hulk. Flash. Batman. And
now, Fafhrd.
Sure, the name "Fafhrd" doesn't
exactly roll off the tongue. But while
science-fiction technology and mod
ern political issues sweep the comic
book industry, Epic Comics' "Fafhrd
and the Gray Mouser" stands out
from its peers as markedly different
and interestingly fresh.
The characters come from the
sword and sorcery tales of Hugo and
Nebula Award winner Fritz Lieber.

The first book in the four-part series,
"111 Met in Lankhmar," is a classic tale
of swashbuckling amidst corrupt
henchmen, murderous scoundrels and
powerful wizards.
Howard Chaykin's adaptation of
the tale to the comic medium is sur
prisingly smooth. Similar to the style
of his critically acclaimed "American
Flagg!" series, Chaykin develops the
two main characters beyond typical
sword-wielding heroes, revealing a
variety of facets.
Fafhrd, a brawny barbarian, is
quick with his sword and his temper.
Still, even intoxicated, Fafhrd is sly
enough to palm liquor underneath the
watchful eye of his love.

Gray Mouser, on the other hand,
makes greater use of his boyish charm
and cunning thievery. When both of
their loves are slain, the two combine
forces against the evil wizard Krovas.
The quality format of "Fafhrd"
suits the artwork of Mike Mignola and
Al Williamson well. Mignola, who
flailed for years on Marvel Comics'
"Alpha Flight," uses the shadows of
the city's alleys in bizarre fashions.
Williamson does a fine job at temper
ing Mignola's angular sketches.
"Fafhrd" may never become a
household name. But the series' cre
ative team has created a refreshing
return to a more chivalrous age which
was, in its own way, heroic.
