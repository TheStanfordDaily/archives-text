## AC/DC: Rocking as hard as ever, with a ’Razor's Edge’ 
### 
AC/DC
The Razor's Edge
Grade: B
(1) I recently bought a new
2500-watt stereo and four cus
tom-made speakers coupled with
a 400-watt subwoofer.
Every morning I fix myself six
cups of expresso, line them up in
a row and chug them. Then I eat
five bowls of Captain Crunch
topped with sugar and crank up
my stereo with AC/DC.
Now that's a good way to
wake up.
(2) Consider recent develop
ments in international relations
for a moment.
Suppose you have a Panama
nian dictator holed up in a con
sulate somewhere and you're try
ing to get him to surrender. You
don't want to create an interna
tional incident by storming the
place, but you are impatient to
get him out.

What music might you blast
into the place that is so hard, so
bloody and harsh, that you could
guarantee his surrender within
72 hours? The Pentagon, in con
sultation with the CIA, decided
on AC/DC, "Back In Black," to
be specific.
(3) Since the crumbling of the
Berlin Wall, East Germans have
been flocking into West Berlin
record shops to buy recorded
music, previously in scarce sup
ply. What are they buying?
Von Karajan and Beethoven?
Wagner? The Beatles? No way.
As Newsweek reported, "The top
sellers [to East Germansf:
AC/DC and the Dirty Dancing
soundtrack. .
Razors Edge is AC/DC's 14th
release and the amazing thing is
that lead vocalist Angus Young
still sounds the same as he did
on the first: fresh, lewd and as
though his diet consists exclu
sively of sandpaper and lye.

Produced by Bruce Fairbairn
(hot off of Arrowsmith's recent
Pump) the album continues the
AC/DC tradition. The guitars are
fat and the drummer sounds as if
he's thrown away his sticks in
favor of using the distinguishing
mark of his gender to pound the
snare mercilessly.
The only complaint that can
reasonably be made about
Razors Edge — other than the
band's inability to spell and lack
of regard for grammatical con
ventions, such as apostrophes —
is that the songs themselves are
just a wee bit less impressive
than those on previous efforts.
But who is listening to the
songs, anyway?
AC/DC is about power, raw
power, and this has lots of it.
And, as their name implies, lis
tening to them is the sensory
equivalent of sticking your wet
finger into a wall outlet.
