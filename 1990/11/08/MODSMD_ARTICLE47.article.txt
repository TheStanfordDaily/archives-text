# Missing more than 'Lefty’
## Wilburys travels a bitter ride

Traveling Wilburys
Traveling Wllburys/Vol. 3
Grade:8
The TYaveling Wilbuiys, per
haps one of the greatest jam ses
sion bands in rock music, aren't
completely back.
On their second album, "Vol.
3," even their pseudonyms are dif
ferent. Granted, the quartet of
musicians, George "Spike" Harri
son, Tbm "Muddy" Petty, Jeff
"Clayton" Lynne and Bob "Boo"
Dylan dedicate this album to Roy
"Lefty" Orbison. But Orbison's
absence from the group makes a
marked difference, noticeable in
much more than merely the loss of
his trademark falsetto.
On "Vol. 3," the remaining
Wilburys sound rough, strained,
twangy and sharply bitter. This
album sounds more like a Lynne
produced country album than a
gathering of classic rockers.
You wouldn't be able to tell this

from just "She's My Baby," the
album's first single. With its quick
riffs, sudden stops and light vocals,
the four seem to pick up right
where the last album left oft.
But, of the remainder of the
album, only "New Blue Moon" res
onates like an Orbison-contributed
tune, with its smooth vocals and
vibrant beat.
Without Orbison, the Wilburys'
bitterness runs rampant. While
"Vol. 1" carried implications of
love, hope and happiness, "Vol. 3"
is preoccupied witn current disillu
sionment, discomfort and depres
sion.
On "Where Were You Last
Night?", even Harrison's vocals
bite, as the lyrics change from
"night" to "week" to "year" "You
Tbok My Breath Away" describes a
smothering relationship in Lynne's
sorrowful lyrics.
"Inside Out" and"The Devil's
Been Busy" deal with an even
greater sorrow, the poisoning of our

environment. Unable to disregard
their social consciences, Harrison,
Petty and Lynne clearly outshine
the mumbling Dylan on 'Devil's,"
one of the album's gems.
On the toe-tapping "Poor
House," Lynne and Petty harmo
nize well, and on "If You Belonged
lb Me" even Dylan's vocals sound
melodious. "If You Belonged Tb
Me" steals an opening riff from
"End of the Line," a "Vol. 1" track,
but at least Dylan sounds better
and happier than on "Congratula
tions."
Without a doubt, the Traveling
Wilburys are one of the best bands
around, both musically and lyri
cally. On "Vol. 3," the ease with
which the four masters blend
together proves that they're having
a fun time recording all of these
tracks.
It's just too bad that the ride
wasn't a bit more fun this time
around.
