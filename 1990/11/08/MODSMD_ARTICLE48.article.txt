Paul Simon
The Rhythm of the Saints
Grade: A
In 1986, Paul Simon joined
forces with several South African
musicians — among them Lady
smith Black Mambazo — to create
"Graceland," one of the best
albums of the past decade.
Four years later, Simon is at it
again. Tne names have changed —
Vincent Nguini and a host of
Brazilian musicians now provide
the sound into which Simon
weaves his lyrics — but the results
are similar.
"The Rhythm of the Saints" is
an exceptional album.
One of the first songs to catch
your ear is "The Coast," partly
because its melody is more promi
nent than that of most of the
album's other songs, and partly
because of the brilliant voice inter
play between Simon and the Brazil
ian Nana Vasconcelos.
Appropriately, the song
describes, among other things, "a
family of musicians" and their

instruments, "two guitars, bata,
bass drum and tambourine."
Indeed, spawned by a wide array
of instruments, the entire album is
filled with a wonderful richness of
sounds.
Various percussion instruments
— congas, bongos and drums —
provide the starting point for most
of the songs; guitars, horns and
keyboards enrich this base; and the
finishing touches are added with a
variety of instruments not often
found on today's popular albums.
When was the last time you
heard an olodum or a chakeire or a
water bowl?
"The Rhythm of the Saints"
may shock you at first. The
emphasis on instrumental sounds
is so great that the melodies of
most songs do not emerge the first
few times you listen to the album.
As a result, you are not likely to
immediately come away humming
to yourself.
But your curiosity will certainly
be aroused. And the more you lis
ten, the more you will be able to
hear. Then, suddenly, you'll be rid

ing to class, humming a song
whose title is a mystery to you,
and, lo and behold, it'll be one of
the songs from the alburrf.
Quite simply, Simon is probably
one of the greatest songwriters in
the history of popular music.
When performing with Art Gar
funkel, Simon was cautious with
his use of sound and relied primar
ily on his gift for writing lyrics.
Now much further along in his
career, Simon has added new chal
lenges to his profession. Both
"Graceland" ana "The Rhythm of
the Saints" prove that Simon can
still write lyrics, but they also
reveal Simon's ability to excel in
the instrumental aspects.
Cases in point are the songs
"Further to Fly" and"The Cool,
Cool River." In the case of the lat
ter, Simon flawlessly shifts from
one musical part to another like
few have ever done.
But songs, after all, are not
meant to be written about. Listen
for yourself to the masterful work
Paul Simon has produced.
