# Operators allege call monitoring
## USW rep says she'll file grievance to end practice

Stanford operators at Forsythe Hall are com
plaining that their phone conversations are being
monitored, just two weeks after dispatchers at Oper
ations and Maintenance protested the taping of their
calls.
According to one Forsythe operator, calls have
been monitored for as long as 10 years. Operators
have known about the monitoring, but were
informed about it not by their supervisor but from
"co-worker to co-worker," said the operator, who
asked to remain anonymous.
"I just found out my supervisor was monitoring
when she coughed," said another operator, who also
asked that her name not be used.
Sharon Lalor, supervisor of operator services, said
she has "no opinion at all" on the issue and declined
to comment further.
Michael Vartain, senior University counsel, said
monitoring switch board operators is a "pretty stan
dard" practice of phone companies. Supervisors need
to find out whether operators are speaking courte

ously, he said.
Stanford operators handle incoming calls for 723-
2300 and 0, which are lines for University informa
tion, and 723-4000, the number for Medical Center
information. There are 17 operators altogether, 10 of
whom are active members of the United Stanford
Workers union.
Linda Crouse, a temporaiy USW field representa
tive, said she is filing a union charge today at
Employee Relations to demand an end to what she
called "unlawful" practices or at least a "beep"
sound on the telephone that will inform both caller
and receiver of the monitoring.
Otherwise, she is going to take legal action,
Crouse said.
Many operators said they feel monitoring conver
sations is a violation of their privacy. Vartain said he
is going to look into the matter, and if there is legal
violation, it will be "corrected quickly."
Dispatchers at Operations and Maintenance
recently complained about phone conversations
being recorded, but the taping was terminated after
