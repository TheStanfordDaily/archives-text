# Operators allege call monitoring
## USW rep says she'll file grievance to end practice 
### Cecilia Tom Editorial staff 
Stanford operators at Forsythe Hall are com
plaining that their phone conversations are being
monitored, just two weeks after dispatchers at Oper
ations and Maintenance protested the taping of their
calls.
According to one Forsythe operator, calls have
been monitored for as long as 10 years. Operators
have known about the monitoring, but were
informed about it not by their supervisor but from
"co-worker to co-worker," said the operator, who
asked to remain anonymous.
"I just found out my supervisor was monitoring
when she coughed," said another operator, who also
asked that her name not be used.
Sharon Lalor, supervisor of operator services, said
she has "no opinion at all" on the issue and declined
to comment further.
Michael Vartain, senior University counsel, said
monitoring switch board operators is a "pretty stan
dard" practice of phone companies. Supervisors need
to find out whether operators are speaking courte

ously, he said.
Stanford operators handle incoming calls for 723-
2300 and 0, which are lines for University informa
tion, and 723-4000, the number for Medical Center
information. There are 17 operators altogether, 10 of
whom are active members of the United Stanford
Workers union.
Linda Crouse, a temporaiy USW field representa
tive, said she is filing a union charge today at
Employee Relations to demand an end to what she
called "unlawful" practices or at least a "beep"
sound on the telephone that will inform both caller
and receiver of the monitoring.
Otherwise, she is going to take legal action,
Crouse said.
Many operators said they feel monitoring conver
sations is a violation of their privacy. Vartain said he
is going to look into the matter, and if there is legal
violation, it will be "corrected quickly."
Dispatchers at Operations and Maintenance
recently complained about phone conversations
being recorded, but the taping was terminated after
an article documenting the prac
tice appeared in the Oct. 23 Daily.
Vartain said monitoring phone
conversations at Forsythe is dif
ferent from the situation at Oper
ations and Maintenance because
it does not involve tape recording.
The California Penal Code forbids
the recording of confidential com
munications without the consent
of both parties.
A Pacific Bell operator supervi
sor said her company "doesn't
inform [the operators] personally
at all" of the monitoring. They
know when calls are being moni
tored, but not the specific line,
she said.
At Forsythe, in addition to the
supervisor, technicians at the sys
tems control center can also mon
itor calls, one operator said.
She added her supervisor
keeps "monitoring sheets" which
are records of the operators' per
formance. Her fellow workers
have no access to these records,

she said.
Calls are only monitored dur
ing the day, which the operator
claimed is a discrimination
against the day workers. The
other operator said the unsystem
atic nature of the monitoring
defeats the training purpose.
"All the operators are very
intimidated ... by this punish
ment and controlling, scare-tac
tics type of management," she
said.
The first operator said calls
should only be monitored, if at all,
for new workers and not people
who have worked for several
years. Crouse said a supervisor
could have easily reached the
training objectives by directly
observing an operator's perfor
mance.
"Electronic surveillance of
staff is not a good way to super
vise," Crouse stressed.
Leslie Quintero, manager of
administrative services at Opera
tions and Maintenance, said the
tape recorder was turned off "due
to the sensitive nature of the com
munity."

lance of staff is not a
good way to super
vise.'

She said the gesture does not
imply acknowledgement of
wrong-doing. "Our legal office
said we weren't doing anything
wrong," she said.
John Schwartz, University
vice president and general coun
sel, said because telephone calls to
the work control station are not
expected to be confidential, taping
of them cannot be regarded as a
violation of the state penal code.
Crouse filed a felony charge
with the Stanford Police Depart
ment against the University on
Oct. 22 for taping phone calls at
Operations and Maintenance. But
Quintero said her office has not
heard anything from the district
attorney's office.

to find out whether operators are speaking courte

ously, he said.
Stanford operators handle incoming calls for 723-
2300 and 0, which are lines for University informa
tion, and 723-4000, the number for Medical Center
information. There are 17 operators altogether, 10 of
whom are active members of the United Stanford
Workers union.
Linda Crouse, a temporaiy USW field representa
tive, said she is filing a union charge today at
Employee Relations to demand an end to what she
called "unlawful" practices or at least a "beep"
sound on the telephone that will inform both caller
and receiver of the monitoring.
Otherwise, she is going to take legal action,
Crouse said.
Many operators said they feel monitoring conver
sations is a violation of their privacy. Vartain said he
is going to look into the matter, and if there is legal
violation, it will be "corrected quickly."
Dispatchers at Operations and Maintenance
recently complained about phone conversations
being recorded, but the taping was terminated after
an article documenting the prac
tice appeared in the Oct. 23 Daily.
Vartain said monitoring phone
conversations at Forsythe is dif
ferent from the situation at Oper
ations and Maintenance because
it does not involve tape recording.
The California Penal Code forbids
the recording of confidential com
munications without the consent
of both parties.
A Pacific Bell operator supervi
sor said her company "doesn't
inform [the operators] personally
at all" of the monitoring. They
know when calls are being moni
tored, but not the specific line,
she said.
At Forsythe, in addition to the
supervisor, technicians at the sys
tems control center can also mon
itor calls, one operator said.
She added her supervisor
keeps "monitoring sheets" which
are records of the operators' per
formance. Her fellow workers
have no access to these records,

she said.
Calls are only monitored dur
ing the day, which the operator
claimed is a discrimination
against the day workers. The
other operator said the unsystem
atic nature of the monitoring
defeats the training purpose.
"All the operators are very
intimidated ... by this punish
ment and controlling, scare-tac
tics type of management," she
said.
The first operator said calls
should only be monitored, if at all,
for new workers and not people
who have worked for several
years. Crouse said a supervisor
could have easily reached the
training objectives by directly
observing an operator's perfor
mance.
"Electronic surveillance of
staff is not a good way to super
vise," Crouse stressed.
Leslie Quintero, manager of
administrative services at Opera
tions and Maintenance, said the
tape recorder was turned off "due
to the sensitive nature of the com
munity."

'Electronic surveil
lance of staff is not a
good way to super
vise.'

She said the gesture does not
imply acknowledgement of
wrong-doing. "Our legal office
said we weren't doing anything
wrong," she said.
John Schwartz, University
vice president and general coun
sel, said because telephone calls to
the work control station are not
expected to be confidential, taping
of them cannot be regarded as a
violation of the state penal code.
Crouse filed a felony charge
with the Stanford Police Depart
ment against the University on
Oct. 22 for taping phone calls at
Operations and Maintenance. But
Quintero said her office has not
heard anything from the district
attorney's office.
