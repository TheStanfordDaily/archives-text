# Outfield's changes yield no diamonds

Outfield
Diamond Days
Grade: C-
In baseball, there arc major differences
between the outfield and infield; outfielders
require strong arms and quick feet for defense,
while infielders rely more on quick reflexes and
accurate throws.
Apparently, the Outfield wasn't aware of
this. On "Diamond Days," their latest release,
the band fails in its effort to change its image,
style and music and instead appears grossly out
of position.
Their double platinum debut album, "Play
Deep," showed the Outfield to be ready for the

big leagues, scoring a pop hit with the bubble
gum "Your Love."
But after two dismal follow-up albums, the
trio decided to make major changes. They cut
down to a duo. They changed record labels. And
they decided to produce their own album and
create an "honest, engaging 7 ' record.
Despite all the changes, "Diamond Days" is
not the album they anticipated. Marked by thin
vocals, basic melodies and shallow lyrics, the
band's changes have created more of a tired
ending than a new beginning.
"For You," the album's inaugural single, is
clearly the album's best track, which isn't say
ing much.
Tbny Lewis' vocals sound too far out of his

range, and John Spinks' guitars show little vari
ation. And you can't get much shallower than
lyrics like "All day/All night/You can have it any
way you want it."
Amazingly, however, the Outfield does get
shallower. Musical sincerity on "John Lennon"
is lost by lyrics which paint the former Beatle
simplistically. And the faster songs, "Take It
All" and "Unrespectable," lack the punch
which gave the band its initial momentum.
The Outfield is not only out of position.
With this album, the band shows that it is
musically questionable and lyrically out of its
league. The duo has a long way to go before
becoming anything near an American pastime.
