Fantasia
Walt Disney
If you still haven't seen It, go, GO, GOII
This Is one of the best movies of all times,
and It only comes out every, say 10 years or
so. You can't afford to miss It. Take a kid and
act like one yourself. (Though you might not
want to put the popcorn bucket on your
head; butter Is hard to wash out of your
hair.)
Good Fellas
Robert DeNlro, Ray Uotta
Based on the 30-year rise and fall of mob
ster Henry Hill, Martin Scorsese's latest film Is
riveting as It portrays the violent, vicious way
of life of the mob. The movie opens with a
brief but brutal killing, quickly establishing
the pace of the movie.
Life and Nothing But (La Vie et Rlen D'Autre)
Sabine Azema, Philippe Noiret, Pascale
Vlgnal
Yet another piece of evidence to prove
than the French know how to make movies
almost as well as they make wine. The win
ner of many European film awards, "Life
and Nothing But" follows the story of three
people struggling to pull their lives together
in the aftermath of World War I. However,
this Is no dismal war epic. Instead, this movie
masterfully shows how ordinary people
struggle to find peace after destruction.
