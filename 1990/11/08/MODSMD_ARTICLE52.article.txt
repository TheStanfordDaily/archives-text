Jacob's Ladder
Tim Robblns, Danny Aiello
Grade: A
"Jacob's Ladder" is more than its previews promise.
Not only is it exciting, suspenseful and horrific, but
its actors do a great job, the cinematography is impres
sive, and the plot is excellent.
Directed by Adrian Lynne, director of
"Flashdance," "9 1/2 Weeks" and "Fatal Attraction,"
"Jacob's Ladder" combines tense drama, psychological
horror and an eerie sense of unreality to create a stun
ningly effective motion picture. Lynne's masterful
camera work highlights the movie's surreal qualities
and projects powerful images that resound in the
viewer's mind.
Even more powerful, however, is the plot.
Screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin, who also wrote
"Brainstorm" and "Ghost," provides several intricate
ly interwoven plot strands that disorient the viewer
and cause him to question all that he sees — but in a
good way. The film's twists and pitfalls throw the
viewer into the psychological hell that the protagonist
is experiencing.
That protagonist is Jacob Singer, played by Tim
Robbins. Singer is a Vietnam veteran haunted by chill
ing images of demons and the suspicion that he was a
victim of some sort of Army experiment in the war.
The movie follows him in his quest to discover what
really happened to him and his comrades in the chaot
ic mele6 that led to him being seriously wounded.
Playing important supporting roles in his psycho
logical development are his girlfriend, Jezzie, played by
Elizabeth Pena, and his chiropractor, Louis, played by
Danny Aiello. These two characters are integral parts
of Jacob's search for internal peace — Jezzie as a dark,
sensual figure and Louis as a merciful, angelic adviser.
All of these elements, plus some superb, yet dis
turbing, special effects, combine to produce a film
which takes audience members deep into their per
sonal psychological infernos; however, even just on
the level of a suspense-thriller, it's an exceptional
movie.
Don't just scoff at the last scene — some contem
plation of its true import lends greatly to your enjoy
ment of the film.
I'd apologize for the abstractness of this review, but
I don't want to ruin any of the compelling occurrences
or images of this movie. You should experience it
without much foreknowledge of its content.
