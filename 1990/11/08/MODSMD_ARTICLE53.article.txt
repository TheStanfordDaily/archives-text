# Screenwriter's nightmare led to movie
## 
### Greg Douglas Staff writer 
Intermission recently had an
opportunity to speak with screen
writer Bruce Joel Rubin about his
latest effort, "Jacob's Ladder."
Intermission: Where did your
inspiration for this movie come
from?
Rubin: In truth, the movie
comes out of lifetime experience,
my life. It's based on a nightmare I
had once about being locked inside
of a New York subway station.
There was no way up, so I knew
that the only way out was down. In
the dream, I had to go either to hell
or through hell to escape. When I
woke up, I thought it would make a
great opening scene for a movie.
I: How does that scene tie in
with Jacob's mental fantasies?
R: I believe what Jacob under
goes is far more serious than fan
tasy. I've spent several years in the
Far East, living in Tibetan monas
teries and learning their concep
tions of spirituality. I believe a man

must be understood through his
death.
Religions share the idea of a
spirit enmeshed in flesh. The ulti
mate struggle of the spirit is to
learn how to escape the body when
death comes. What Jacob is experi
encing is the reality of learning the
truth of his death. In that process,
he deals with his creative
archetypes of a re-empowered
heaven and hell that come into
being in the last moments of his
life.
I: Tim Robbins has been cast in
a series of comic roles. Did you
envision him when you wrote this
screenplay, and did you approve of
his portrayal of Singer?
R: I think Tim was still in dia
pers when I first started writing
this screenplay. I had an image
more of Bill Hurt or Richard Gere
as Jacob Singer.
Both A 1 Pacino and Dustin
Hoffman wanted to do the role, but
Adrian wanted Tim, and I knew he
was right for the part when I met
him. Gere actually told me after we

cast Tim that he wanted the part.
He said he would have offered
sooner, but he didn't understand it
at first.
I: Your other works, such as
"Brainstorm" and "Ghost," have
also involved death and the after
life. Why this seeming obsession?
R: Some people have called me
"death-obsessed," but I feel that
I'm really life-obsessed. Life
doesn't mean anything if you're
not aware of its reality, and my
works approach the dying process
in an attempt to show what life is
about. Some people who watch it
will say, "Forget that" and leave the
theater, but for those who want to
go deeper, the opportunity is there.
I: What are your future plans?
R: I'm going to be directing my
first movie. Directing a movie is
like writing a final draft of a screen
play. Since I'm also going to be
writer and producer, I'm going to
learn what it's like to compromise
a screenplay from a director's view
point.
