Sibling Rivalry

Grade: C-
If you go to sleep before Let
terman, if you drive 65 miles an
hour when it says 65 mph, if you
worry so much about having
enough fiber in your diet that
you drink Metamucil and if you
find the Band offensive, you will
enjoy "Sibling Rivalry" more
than I did.
Director Carl Reiner defi
nitely knows how to be funny.
He is one of the many notable
comic minds that gave the so
called "Golden Age" of television
its laughs. That was the age of
Beaver (give or take a few years);
this is the age of Bart.
The film stars Kirstie Alley
from "Cheers" with a supporting
cast that includes Ed O'Neill
from "Married with Children"
and Carrie Fisher from a galaxy
far, far away.
With such contemporary
Spes as those you might think
at Reiner would have a robust
comic pulse. Well, let's put it
this way: don't drink anything
decaffeinated before seeing "Sib

ling Rivalry" because this film
needs every little lack you can
give it.
The basic plot had potential.
An prim, upper-class, housewife
with no children, joins the
American Nazi party and runs
for school board because her
physican-husband is cold and
her younger sister thinks she
needs some excitement.
Actually, the bit about Nazi
school board campaign has
nothing to do with the film, but
it has Hollywood written all over
it.
Married to the first guy she
loved (Ha!) Marjorie (Alley) feels
shunned by her husband and his
high powered physician family.
So, at the urgings of her
Bohemian, younger sister Jea
nine (Jami Gertz), Marje has an
affair with the first guy she
meets at the grocery store.
Guess what, the guy dies in
bed.
You'll have to use your imagi
nation, though; this is PG-13,
not NC-17. TR) top off her guilt
orgy, Marje discovers that the
victim of her passion was her
long-lost brother-in-law.

The scenes immediately fol
lowing the death are funny, but
cannot, and do not, sustain the
entire film. It's all downhill
afterwards. For the rest of the
film, director Reiner unsuccess
fully tries to explore the nuances
of three ill-developed sibling
rivalries and attempts to change
Marje's life for the better.
As far as siblings go, Reiner
concludes that they are different
and they should live and let live.
What a revelation. The sappy
ending for Marje is as contrived
as it is upbeat.
Reiner's overall approach is to
have his actors play everything
tragically serious with an occa
sional pratfall thrown in to
assure the audience that this is a
comedy
No sell, Carl.
In the lead role, Kirstie Alley
does fine, but she has yet to play
a role that does her justice. As
her younger sister, Jami Gertz is
irritating.
I should have known I was in
for a snoozer when "Sibling
Rivalry" began with renegade
elevator music.
