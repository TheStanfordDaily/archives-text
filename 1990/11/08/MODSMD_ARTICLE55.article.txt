Waiting for the Light
Shirley MacLaine, Terl Garr
Grade: C+
Pleasant.
I've been sitting here for almost
an hour, and that's the best I can
come up with. I checked the the
saurus, which gave me "gratifying"
and "satisfying" as substitutes. But
those don't fit. So, I guess I'm
stuck with "pleasant."
Not that pleasant is bad, mind
you. I like pleasant — as in pleas
ant weather, pleasant tempers and
pleasant surprises.
But I'm not really all that
excited about pleasant movies.
They're just so ... so .. .pleasant.
Whicn means that I'm really
not all that excited about "Waiting
for the Light," starring Shirley
MacLaine and Tferi Garr.
The movie takes place in the
1960's and centers around Kay
(Garr), a divorced mother of two,
and her zany, ex-vaudevillian Aunt
Zena (MacLaine).
Times are tough for the family
in Chicago, and Kay is constantly
trying to make ends meet with a
job at the local movie theater while

Aunt Zena performs magic at
birthday parties.
However, Zena's outrageous
acts make them infamous rather
than prosperous. Furthermore, she
encourages her niece and nephew
to become her "sorcerer's appren
tices," which usually results in
their pulling a stunt at school that
gets them sent home.
Or, more often, escorted home.
By a not-very-happy teacher. Or
principal. Or lawyer
All this being too much for Kay,
she jumps at die chance to take
over her deceased uncle's diner in
Buckley, a small town in Washing
ton. She sees it as a chance to start
again.
When you see the state of the
diner, and the town, you'll realize
that "start" is a very appropriate
term.
Supposedly, the move to Wash
ington is the beginning of the real
"action" in the film; everything
previous is building up to the plot.
However, this "background" takes
over half the movie.
Or at least it seemed that way.
While watching the movie, I
was struck by the feeling that

halfway through filming someone
realized there was no plot. Nice
story, cute family, but no plot.
So they (the filmmakers)
quickly turned one incident — the
scaring of an eccentric next-door
neighbor by the kids and Aunt
Zena — into the basis for the rest
of the movie.
I won't tell you any more than
this, in case you decide to see it for
yourself.
I will tell you, however, that the
theme, I believe, was supposed to
be something about hope in the
worst of times and how it is all you
need. The crises of Kay and her
family parallel, albeit loosely, the
crises of the 1960'5; i.e. the threat
of nuclear war with the Soviet
Union and the Cuban Missile Cri
sis.
Sweet, isn't it?
Now don't get me wrong. This
was by no means a bad film. But, it
didn't have anything that really
held my attention, or my interest.
It was nice, endearing, simple,
sweet.
In other words, pleasant.
