To Sleep with Anger
Danny Glover
Grade: B-
Innovation is a word seldom
applied to the film industry; one
has to look no farther than the
upcoming "Star Ttek VI" to realize
that studio executives aren't
exactly big on risk taking. Money is
the name of the game in Holly
wood, and most filmmakers cast
concern for cinematic originality
aside in their frantic scramble for
the almighty dollar.
Occasionally though, there are
those films that in an effort to
explore new themes venture out of
the commercial mainstream to
chart the unknown waters of inde
pendent, low-budget filmmaking.
Films like these are less concerned
with making money than with tak
ing new and unique directions in
movie-making.
Such is the case with the
recently released "To Sleep with
Anger." Unfortunately, however,
this film, despite its good inten
tions, achieves very mixed results
in its attempts to be innovative.
The movie follows the daily
lives of various members of a black
family that a number of years ear
lier had transplanted itself from the
rural South to the suburbs. Despite
their suburban environment, the

family members retain many of the
distinct social and religious values
of the old South.
The normal routine of the fam
ily is interrupted, however, when
an old family friend (Danny
Glover) suddenly appears after a
30-year absence. Despite his
friendly overtures, it soon becomes
apparent that Glover's character
has sinister intentions, and his
presence quickly breeds conflict
within the family.
The major flaw of "To Sleep
with Anger" lies in its lack of story.
The film itself amounts to little
more than a series of character
sketches and random images, all
tied loosely together by a flimsy
plot.
The movie opens, for example,
with a set of blackout scenes which
presumably are intended to intro
duce the audience to the film's
major characters. The disjointed
and highly confusing nature of
these scenes, however, keeps them
from effectively achieving this pur
pose.
The opening scene accompany
ing the credits is particularly
obtuse; the symbolic significance,
if any, of the bizarre images that
round out the first few minutes of
the film remains irritatingly elu
sive.
What little plot there is starts to

roll forward only after the appear
ance of Glover's character, which
occurs about 15 minutes into the
film. Yet, despite the catalytic
effects of Glover's character on the
pace of the story, nothing of inter
est really occurs until the last few
scenes.
Indeed, the darkly humorous
yet extremely poignant ending
stands out in bold contrast to the
dull themes elaborated on through
out the rest of the film.
Ultimately, however, the one
saving grace of "To Sleep with
Anger" is not its ending but its per
formances, which are top notch.
Glover — who also acted as an
executive producer in this film —
is a real treat to watch. He's an
extremely talented, very versatile
actor, and its nice to see him break
out of the formulaic confines of
"Lethal Weapon II" and into some
thing a little more challenging.
The supporting ensemble cast is
equally impressive, and the film's
director displays a deft touch in
examining the emotionally
charged conflicts of the various
characters they portray.
On the final balance sheet, how
ever, the film's fine performances
are good, but not good enough to
make up for its lack of a cohesive,
interesting story.
