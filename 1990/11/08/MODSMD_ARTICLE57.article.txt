## 'Dispute' uncovers 18th century 'isms 
### Anita Schneider Staff writer

James Loehlin takes a critical
and complex look at 18th cen
tury French society in his direc
tion of Marivaux's "The Dis
pute."
The play is about a prince
who conducts an experiment to
see which of the sexes is more
likely to be unfaithful. He keeps
two men (Azor and Mesrin) and
two women (Egle and Adine) on
his grounds, all isolated from
one another, and allows them
only the company of his ser
vants Mesrou (Ray O'Neal) and
Carise (Sherifa Omade Edoga).
One day the Prince releases the
four youths, promising Her
maine "an unusual spectacle."
This light, intellectual play
was originally intended to be
frivolous entertainment, but
Loehlin gives a more serious,
somewhat sinister air.
In the opening scene, for
example, the Prince and his
courtesan Hermaine speak
while moving languorously
through billows of smoke. In
their pasty white make-up, the
two resemble ghosts. This slow
motion effect does help to pre
sent the exposition clearly, but
weighs down Marivaux's origi
nal idea.
Loehlin also makes an inci
sive attempt to expose the
play's racists and sexist under
tones: the servants are black
and are told they're not beauti
ful because of their skin color,-
when the men meet, they
embrace in friendship, but the
women's first meeting leads to
jealousy and competition.
In Marivaux's time, it was
acceptable to portray racial

stereotypes as natural, but it's
Loehlin's argument that this is
not a natural phenomenon at
all, but an oppressive, man
made one.
Yet, despite its discrimina
tion, "The Dispute" is also just
in some regards. For example,
the roles of the servants are the
most complimentary of all the
characters â€” they're the only
moral ones in the play and are
wise and intelligent.
And the shortcomings of
women are fairly well-balanced
with those of men.
Playing the role of Egle,
Karen Rachael Weitzman is
exceptional, and her articulate
delivery and genuine grace
brings needed life to the produc
tion. As Adine, Sholom Krishna
Surges is strong and unpreten
tious.
Ken Ruiz as Azor and Hal
Ross as Mesrin are physically
well-suited for their roles as
young lovers, but their character
work is nondescript. In contrast
to the women, whose motiva
tions for switching lovers seems
personal and genuine, the male
characters don't show how it
benefits their psyche to drop one
woman for the other.
A marvelous set design by
William Eddelman includes a
stream with running water, and
ingeniously meets the demand
of serving as both indoor palace
and outdoor grounds. And Dou
glas Russell's finely detailed
costumes provide a remarkable
note of authenticity.

"The Dispute" will be per
formed through Nov. 10, at 8
p.m. Wednesday through Satur
day, in the Little Theater. For
