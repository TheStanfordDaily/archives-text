# In Theatreworks' 'Emerald City/it's no Oz
## 
### Anita Schneider Staff writer 
Australia's most widely produced contempo
rary playwright, David Williamson, has written
a semi-autobiographical work, "Emerald City."
Theatre Works is premiering the play, which
centers around a critically acclaimed yet com
mercially unappreciated screenwriter, at the
Burgess in Menlo Park.
Colin, the screenwriter, uproots his family
from their home in Melbourne to live in the
dazzling Sydney — an "Emerald City" with a
superficiality comparable to that of Los Ange
les.
Colin's career is tottering and, as he's por
trayed by Tbm Woosnam, he's pompous, self
absorbed, bull-headed and smug. Given these
unlikable characteristics, it's amusing to watch
him smolder with envy at everyone whose work
is less artistic but more successful than his
own.
Colin complains constantly: his producer
Elaine has a more stunning view of the water
front than he does; his children's sex life (based
on what he hears about "who was with whom"
over the telephone) is more exciting than his
own.
And perhaps most devastating, his wife Kate
is promoted at work, publishes a chart-topping
book, goes on a business trip to London and has
an affair.
The hardest part for Colin is his loss of con
trol and struggle to regain it.
When Mike, an "aging shyster" who edits
soap operas, latches on to Colin in order to gain
status as his co-writer, and thus launch his own
career, Colin is left embittered.
The idea that an untalented screenwriter like
Mike could rack in projects and money tears
him apart. Reluctantly though, Colin joins
Mike in writing adventure schlock that
includes an Australian version of "Miami
Vice."
Williamson's writing has breadth and sub
stance, for his themes include not only art ver
sus commercialism, but also family stability
and the social issues of poverty and racism.
This, and Williamson's gift for sparkling, witty
dialogue, keep us absorbed in his comedy,
which despite its wordiness, moves at a fast
pace.
And director Dennis Martin is quick to take
advantage of every funny situation.

For example, at the end of Act I, Colin and
Kate are at Mike's home, along with Mike's rav
ishing girlfriend. Colin confesses to the audi
ence his lust and infatuation with her, and sud
denly his wife, referring not to his confession,
but to the quest for art or money, says, "You're
going to have to decide." Colin snaps out of it
like he's stuck his hand in an electric fence, and
the effect is hilarious.
The only scene that doesn't work is one in
which Mike and his business associate stand
with their backs to the audience and pretend
they're at a latrine. The absence of physical
props — toilets and sinks — forces the actors to
pantomime, which is out-of-place, not to men
tion crude.
The cast works well together, and their over
all acting, and accents, are essentially flawless.
Ingrid Gerstmann, as Colin's feisty wife

Kate, conveys a subtle, flourishing charm. The
burly, opinionated, aging hustler Mike and his
siren-of-a-girlfriend Helen provide real interest
and excitement.
Lawrence Thoo is believable in the role of
Malcolm, the merchant banker, and Bonnie
Henry as Elaine is forceful and biting.
The effective settings — the action moves
smoothly from Colin's house to Mike's house,
to various cocktail parties and offices — were
designed by Bruce McLeod and lighted by
Stephanie Johnson.

"Emerald City" runs through Dec. 8 at the
Burgess Theater, 601 Laurel Street, Menlo
Park. Performances are at 8 p.m. Tuesday
through Saturday, with some Sunday perfor
mances. Tickets may be purchased at the
CAPA Box Office, 329-2623.
