If you're still rooting for something to
do this weekend, stop. You may be bark
ing up the wrong tree. Take heart, though,
because Raices Musicales — Spanish for
"musical roots" — will be sprouting in
Palo Alto, and it promises to be an inter
esting cultural event.
Raices Musicales is collaborative
effort of 18 musicians who specialize in
five regional styles of Chicano music.
The program includes an accordion,
guitar and bass trio from San Antonio
that will team up with ? pair of dancers to
perform a traditional act that developed
in northern Mexico during the 19305.
Also featured in this off-beat evening is a
mariachi band from Jalisco, a violin-gui
tar duo from New Mexico and a marimba
group from the Gulf of Mexico.
If African — not Mexican — music is
the first thing you think of when you hear
"marimba," your instinct is right on —
this instrument originated in Africa.
During colonial times, however, the
marimba made its way from there to
Central America and then to Mexico.
African influence sneaks in a second
time during an appearance of Los Pre

goneros del Puerto, a harp and guitar
group that combines music with both
memorized and improvised poetry.
Mariachi, the "national musical
expression of Mexico," is also on the pro
gram with Mariachi El Capiro de Jalisco,
a select group that will perform classic
sones and rancheras on violins, trumpets
vihuela and guitarrdn.

Not all that is cultural is traditional,
however. For a group with a nearly redun
dant name, the New York New Music
Ensemble does anything but repeat the
already heard.
Dedicated to creating and promoting
new music, nothing in Saturday night's
program is older than "Ave Maris Stella,"
written in 1975 by Peter Maxwell Davies.
Other selections will include Poul
Ruders' "Vox in Rama," and "Beaten
Paths" for solo marimba, by Milton Bab
bitt. Both were written in 1984. Bun
ching Lam's "Another Spring" and Dor
rance Stalvey's "Exordium/Genesis/
Dawn," vintages 1988 and 1990, respec
tively, are also on the menu.
Avant-garde groups like this are
important because they help new music
get heard. And because patrons are about
as commonplace as monarchs, cutting
edge ensembles help sustain the com
poser, a species more threatened with

extinction than the spotted owl.
Moreover, New Music Ensemble
members are not artists who couldn't
make it performing traditional music.
On the contrary, they come from some of
the most competitive conservatories in
the country.
Emerson String Quartet
Wed. 8 p.m., Dlnkelsplel Auditorium
Tickets available at Tresldder Ticket

If you prefer dead composers to starv
ing ones, Wednesday's Emerson String
Quartet appearance might be more your
pace.
Winners of last year's Grammy for
Best Classical Album and Gramophone
Magazine's Record of the Year award, this
renowned quartet will be playing works
by Haydn, Shostakovich, Carter and
Debussy.
The quartet members' youth — all are
in their 30s — is in sharp contrast to
their extremely old, extremely valuable
instruments.
The four instruments, which include
a Stradivarius violin and Guadagnini
cello, are from 200 to over 300 years old.
Just to be in the same room with rare
instruments like these justifies the
admission price, lb hear quartet mem
bers — Eugene Drucker and Philip Set
zer on violin, violist Lawrence Dutton
and cellist David Finckel — in perfor
mance makes the show here a bargain.
