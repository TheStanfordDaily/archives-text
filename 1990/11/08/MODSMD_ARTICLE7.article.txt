# Step shows unite black Greeks
## 
### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Staff writer 
At a party in Tresidder Union's
Oak Lounge, a sea of students are
dancing to the beat of a popular
song when suddenly the music
fades.
The revelers scurry off the
dance floor, jockeying for positions
along the room's perimeter to
watch 11 cane-toting women con
verge on center stage to perform
the evening's main event,"The
Throw Down."
"Rip it up, April," cheers a
spectator to one of the women.
"AKA, baby," screams a bevy of
onlookers. Seconds later, the
women erupt into an electrifying

series of scripted steps inter
spersed with chanting, clapping
and cane-banging action.
These are the ladies of the
Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, and
on this particular night they strut
their stuff as part of a black Greek
tradition — the step show.
For members of Stanford's two
black sororities and three black
fraternities, stepping is not just a
rite of passage for new pledges. It
is a permanent fixture at social
gatherings and serves to
strenghten ties within the group,
various members say.
"Step shows are a way for us to
express ourselves," explains
senior Tina Rogers, a dancer in
this step show, which took place

Saturday. "The dance forms a
bond that shows pride in our
sorority and celebrates African-
American culture and creativity,"
she says. Senior Richard
Eubanks, a member of Omega Psi
Phi fraternity adds, "The step
dance is enjoyable to watch and
fun to do."
But the combustion of synco
pated moves and synchronized
rhythms represents more than
hedonistic high-stepping tor black
fraternities and sororities.
According to Temple Univer
sity Prof. Maurice Henderson,
author of a soon-to-be published
book, "Black Greek Letter Orga
nizations: A Lesson in African-
American Heritage and Egyptol
ogy", stepping is " a verbal and
physical link between Afro-Ameri
can life and African ancestry."
"As a cultural manifestation,
stepping is not a phenomenon, but
a cultural continuance that incor
porates aspects of the black Amer
ican experience with its deeper
roots that stretch back to Africa,"
he says.
The step dance's tradition is
steeped in West African tribal war
marches and ritual drumming
fused with a slice of Afro-Ameri
can culture — minstrel shows,
chants in black churches and the
legacy of tap dance.
The Harlem Renaissance of the
1920s was a period of innovation
for the step dance. From that era
step dancers borrowed the "ham
bone" — the hitting of hands
against the lower part of the body,
which is a primary part ot the step
ritual today, according to Hender
son.
"Add a 1990 Afro-centric style
of dancing and you have got mod
ern step dance. It has a little bit of
everything," Alpha Phi Alpha's
Lawrence Gilliam, chair of the
-iep committee for his fraternity
says.
Although the moves employed
by step dancers are frequently
used in marching bands at many
predominantly black schools in
the south, the black Greek system
is responsible for step dancing's
widespread meteoric rise in popu
larity.
Each Greek organization
infuses its own style into a dance
and makes it unique to that orga
nization. "You can tell an organi
zation just by its step. Some sing,
some do not. Some use canes, oth
ers don't," points out Gilliam, a
junior. "It's pretty organization
specific."
But one characteristic common
to all step dances is the incorpora
tion of subtle messages of social
importance.

During a recent fraternity
party, Gilliam's fraternity per
formed a step dance called "Push-
Pull", based on the physics con
cept that for every action there is
an equal and opposite reaction.
"Our step dance stressed that
as young black men pushing for
ward with our education and get
ting ahead we also must remem
ber to pull up those who are less
fortunate," says Gilliam.
Step dancing on campus is
drawing an increasing number of
students, such as senior Evan
Nadler, who came to cheer on an
Alpha Kappa Alpha dancer with
some of his Phi Delta Theta fra
ternity brothers.
"I was totally impressed by the
the dance," says Nadler, recalling
the event."It was really powerful
and we got a real appreciation for
what they were doing."

Step dancing 'has
become an inroad to
multicultural partying
at Stanford.'

With a growing number of non
blacks attending black fraternal
parties, Gilliam sees step dancing
as a way to increase cross-cultural
interaction. "It has become an
inroad to multicultural partying
at Stanford. People enjoy the
show and stay for the party," says
Gilliam.
That is music to the ears of
Program and Fraternal Affairs
Adviser Michael Ramsey-Perez,
who has stated a hope to promote
further interaction between black
and predominatly white Greek

organizations.
"Anything that gets people
intrigued or talking about other
people's culture and values is
good. [Step dancing] could be a
paradigm. Students could see it,
ask about it and enjoy it,"he says.
Alpha Kappa Alpha's April
Hicks, a senior, agrees that having
people from different campus
communities coming to step
shows is positive, even if she does
get antsy before the performance.
"I was really nervous going out
on the floor," she says, recalling
her first-ever dance, "but once I
got out onto the floor I was ready
to have fun."
Judging by the wild enthusi
asm of the crowd after this recent
step show, Hicks and her Alpha
Kappa Alpha sisters need not
worry in the future. On this night,
they "threw it down."
