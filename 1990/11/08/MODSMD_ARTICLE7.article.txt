# Step shows unite black Greeks

At a party in Tresidder Union's
Oak Lounge, a sea of students are
dancing to the beat of a popular
song when suddenly the music
fades.
The revelers scurry off the
dance floor, jockeying for positions
along the room's perimeter to
watch 11 cane-toting women con
verge on center stage to perform
the evening's main event,"The
Throw Down."
"Rip it up, April," cheers a
spectator to one of the women.
"AKA, baby," screams a bevy of
onlookers. Seconds later, the
women erupt into an electrifying

series of scripted steps inter
spersed with chanting, clapping
and cane-banging action.
These are the ladies of the
Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, and
on this particular night they strut
their stuff as part of a black Greek
tradition â€” the step show.
For members of Stanford's two
black sororities and three black
fraternities, stepping is not just a
rite of passage for new pledges. It
is a permanent fixture at social
gatherings and serves to
strenghten ties within the group,
various members say.
"Step shows are a way for us to
express ourselves," explains
senior Tina Rogers, a dancer in
this step show, which took place

Saturday. "The dance forms a
bond that shows pride in our
sorority and celebrates African-
American culture and creativity,"
she says. Senior Richard
Eubanks, a member of Omega Psi
Phi fraternity adds, "The step
dance is enjoyable to watch and
fun to do."
But the combustion of synco
pated moves and synchronized
rhythms represents more than
hedonistic high-stepping tor black
fraternities and sororities.
