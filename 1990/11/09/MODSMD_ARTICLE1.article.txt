# University may face shortfall of more than $5 million
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
Just six weeks after Provost
James Rosse announced the Uni
versity's repositioning efforts
would produce a balanced budget
this year, Stanford appears to be
headed for a budget shortfall of
more than $5 million.
Rosse told the Faculty Senate
yesterday that a number of
assumptions built into the 1990-
91 operating budget now seem
overly optimistic. Rosse declined
to provide a figure for the pro
jected shortfall.
However, Rosse did identify
three sources of the prob
lem. Calculations based on known
and estimated figures in these
areas suggest a total shortfall of
about $5.1 million.
With the University already in
the midst of slashing $22 million
from its operating budget, addi
tional cuts now appear inevitable.
Rosse told the senate he is looking

at "one-time actions" to avoid a
deficit for this year. "We believe
we must take action in the very
near future," he said.
Rosse indicated that a number
of solutions were being explored
and said he would try to minimize
the impact on schools, offices and

departments. But "we have to rec
ognize that there may still be
some degree of pain and suffer
ing," he cautioned.
A decision on what actions to
take will be made by late next
week, Rosse said.
Two of the three causes Rosse
identified relate to Stanford's
research activities. The third
source is lower-than-expected
earnings on the University's
expendable funds pool, which con
sists of non-endowment invest
ments.
Earnings from the expendable
funds pool were expected to con
tribute $12.2 million to the oper
ating budget this year. That figure
is based on a payout rate of 8.6
percent.
But "the interest rate assump
tions we made were too high,"
Rosse said. He added he now
believes the payout rate will be
closer to 7.6 percent.
If so, Stanford will apparently
accrue about $1.4 million less

than expected on earnings from
the expendable funds pool.
Furthermore, the volume of
Stanford's federally sponsored
research has been much lower
than expected in the first few
months of the fiscal year. As a
result, the University has reduced
its projection for the entire year.
When Stanford faculty conduct
research, the federal government
reimburses the University for
both the cost of the research and
the indirect costs associated with
the research. Indirect costs
include such items as operations
and maintenance, use of the
library by researchers and various
administrative expenses.
When fewer federal dollars
than expected are spent on
research at Stanford, as has hap
pened this fall, a shortfall in indi
rect cost recovery results. Indirect
cost recovery is the University's
second-largest source of revenue
after tuition.
The University now expects a
$2.5 million shortfall in indirect
cost recovery, Dean of Research
. Robert Byer said in an interview
Tuesday.
And regardless of whether the
a current federal investigations of
Stanford's indirect cost policies
yield any evidence of wrongdoing,
the investigations will prove
costly for the University.
The government has estab
lished a 74 percent provisional
* indirect cost rate for Stanford for
the duration of the investigations.
. Stanford had proposed a rate of 78
c percent for this year, and that fig
ure was incorporated into budget
ing decisions.
The four-point difference has a
substantial effect — a loss of $1.2
- million in expected revenue for
the year, Byer said.
The projected budget shortfall
announced yesterday is further
evidence that the University's
"repositioning" efforts were nec
; essary, Rosse said.
"Repositioning was the exactly
right medicine at the right time,"
he said. "Without repositioning,
we would be facing a truly
formidable budget dilemma now."
The University operating bud
get for 1990-91, approved by the
Board of Trustees in April,
included $7.2 million in expense
reductions. The remainder of the
$22 million in cuts are scheduled
to become effective with the 1991-
92 budget.
Rosse also expressed concern
yesterday about national factors
affecting the University's long
term financial health.

The four-point difference has a
substantial effect — a loss of $1.2
- million in expected revenue for
the year, Byer said.
The projected budget shortfall
announced yesterday is further
evidence that the University's
"repositioning" efforts were nec
; essary, Rosse said.
"Repositioning was the exactly
right medicine at the right time,"
he said. "Without repositioning,
we would be facing a truly
formidable budget dilemma now."
The University operating bud
get for 1990-91, approved by the
Board of Trustees in April,
included $7.2 million in expense
reductions. The remainder of the
$22 million in cuts are scheduled
to become effective with the 1991-
92 budget.
Rosse also expressed concern
yesterday about national factors
affecting the University's long
term financial health.
Just six weeks after Provost
James Rosse announced the Uni
versity's repositioning efforts
would produce a balanced budget
this year, Stanford appears to be
headed for a budget shortfall of
more than $5 million.
Rosse told the Faculty Senate
yesterday that a number of
assumptions built into the 1990-
91 operating budget now seem
overly optimistic. Rosse declined
to provide a figure for the pro
jected shortfall.
However, Rosse did identify
three sources of the prob
lem. Calculations based on known
and estimated figures in these
areas suggest a total shortfall of
about $5.1 million.
With the University already in
the midst of slashing $22 million
from its operating budget, addi
tional cuts now appear inevitable.
Rosse told the senate he is looking

at "one-time actions" to avoid a
deficit for this year. "We believe
we must take action in the very
near future," he said.
Rosse indicated that a number
of solutions were being explored
and said he would try to minimize
the impact on schools, offices and

departments. But "we have to rec
ognize that there may still be
some degree of pain and suffer
ing," he cautioned.
A decision on what actions to
take will be made by late next
week, Rosse said.
Two of the three causes Rosse
identified relate to Stanford's
research activities. The third
source is lower-than-expected
earnings on the University's
expendable funds pool, which con
sists of non-endowment invest
ments.
Earnings from the expendable
funds pool were expected to con
tribute $12.2 million to the oper
ating budget this year. That figure
is based on a payout rate of 8.6
percent.
But "the interest rate assump
tions we made were too high,"
Rosse said. He added he now
believes the payout rate will be
closer to 7.6 percent.
If so, Stanford will apparently
accrue about $1.4 million less

than expected on earnings from
the expendable funds pool.
Furthermore, the volume of
Stanford's federally sponsored
research has been much lower
than expected in the first few
months of the fiscal year. As a
result, the University has reduced
its projection for the entire year.
When Stanford faculty conduct
research, the federal government
reimburses the University for
both the cost of the research and
the indirect costs associated with
the research. Indirect costs
include such items as operations
and maintenance, use of the
library by researchers and various
administrative expenses.
When fewer federal dollars
than expected are spent on
research at Stanford, as has hap
pened this fall, a shortfall in indi
rect cost recovery results. Indirect
cost recovery is the University's
second-largest source of revenue
after tuition.
The University now expects a
$2.5 million shortfall in indirect
cost recovery, Dean of Research
. Robert Byer said in an interview
Tuesday.
And regardless of whether the
a current federal investigations of
Stanford's indirect cost policies
yield any evidence of wrongdoing,
the investigations will prove
costly for the University.
The government has estab
lished a 74 percent provisional
* indirect cost rate for Stanford for
the duration of the investigations.
. Stanford had proposed a rate of 78
c percent for this year, and that fig
ure was incorporated into budget
ing decisions.
The four-point difference has a
substantial effect — a loss of $1.2
- million in expected revenue for
the year, Byer said.
