# Chi Alpha Pi close to becoming newest member of Greek system
## 
### Tracy Clay 
The new Chi Alpha Pi sorority
has reached the final stages
needed for University recognition
and might soon join the Stanford
Greek system.
This fall, sorority leaders pre
sented a 100-page report detailing
their proposed structure to Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Michael
Jackson and campus sorority
adviser Nancy Noelke. Noelke
said she and Jackson are now
reviewing the proposal and will
meet with leaders of Chi Alpha Pi
next week.
Sorority leaders have also been
contacted by a national sorority
that has offered to integrate Chi
Alpha Pi into its system.
The group began spring quar
ter when several women decided
they had enough interest to start
up a new sorority. Since then, the
group has attracted 39 members,
said sophomore Shannie Geddes,
president of the group.
The sorority conducted an
informal rush this fall, but mem
bers said that during the initial
planning stages the group was
confident it could attract enough
members.
"We figured we already had 20
people who liked and respected
each other, so we were oft to a
good start," according to sopho
more Michelle Ho, vice-president
of Chi Alpha Pi.
Before the sorority becomes an
official member of Stanford's
Greek system, the group must
receive approval from the Office of
Student Activities as a local soror

'There is a strong
enough Greek inter
est by women to sup
port another organi
zation.'

ity.
Intersorority Council Presi
dent Erin Scalley called the pro
cess of recognition and acceptance
"difficult" because a new group
must choose officers, write a con
stitution and by-laws and state its
purpose for formation â€” a process
that Chi Alpha Pi began with its
100-page proposal to Student
Activities.
According to group leaders,
there were some behind-the
scenes concerns that adding
another sorority might jeopardize
the future of other sororities that
have had chronic trouble enticing
new members.
Under the existing system, the
ISC designates a quota of how
many pledges each sorority can
issue bids to. This number is
reached by evenly dividing the
number of women attending Rush
with the number of sororities.
The concerns centered on the
fact that adding Chi Alpha Pi
might shrink the quota even far
ther, sorority leaders said.
But Scalley said she believes
the Greek system is strong
enough to sustain an additional
organization.
"There is strong enough Greek
interest by women to support

another organization," she said.
"Chi Alpha Pi will actually benefit
the whole system by increasing
the number of choices women
have." i
Furthermore, a national soror
ity, Chi Omega, has expressed
interest in integrating Chi Alpha
Pi into its organization, Ho said.
The ISC, not Student Activities,
will approve whether or not Chi
Omega can integrate the new
sorority into its national organiza
tion, she noted.
Ho said Chi Alpha Pi leaders
plan on accepting Chi Omega's
offer for national sponsorship
because they believe such recogni
tion offers many advantages.
"It has been more difficult than
we thought, founding our own
sorority," she said. "You have to
create everything, even the tradi
tions. A national sorority offers a
chance to network and be a part of
something already established."
Group leaders formally con
tacted the national organization
once last spring, and several infor
mal discussions resulted. A Chi
Omega alumna contacted con
tacted the group this fall to
express the organization's inter
est in sponsoring Chi Alpha Pi, Ho
said. Plans for integration must
wait until the group receives cam
pus recognition, Ho added.
Geddes said Chi Alpha Pi will
retain its special character even if
a merger with the national organi
zation takes place.
"We are unique the same way
every sorority is unique. Everyone
wants a place where they feel at
home," she said.
