Cranston has cancer
WASHINGTON (AP) -
Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.,
said yesterday that he has
prostate cancer and will not
seek re-election when his
term expires in 1992.
"The physicians tell me
that the cancer is apparently
totally curable, but immedi
ate treatment is necessary,"
Cranston said in a statement

released by his office. "A positive factor is my
otherwise robust health. Whether I face an
operation or radiation therapy will be deter
mined shortly."
Cranston, 76, also said he would not seek
another two-year term as deputy majority
leader for the Congress that convenes in Jan
uary.
Bush pledges again
WASHINGTON (AP) - President Bush,
reviving the no-new-tax pledge he abandoned
in the budget deal, said yesterday the only way
Democrats can raise income tax rates will be
"over my dead veto."
"It ain't going to happen, I'll guarantee
you," Bush told reporters at a news conference
after saying he expects congressional
Democrats to come up with new tax proposals.
But he hedged his pledge somewhat when
asked flatly if he would reject new taxes.
"Can I make the promise I won't support
them? Absolutely," Bush said. "But. .. some
times you run into some realities. But I'm gird
ing up my loins to go into battle to beat back
the tax attempts that I think are coming."
Bush is striking a sharply combative stance
toward the Democrats, who increased their
power in both the House and Senate with Elec
tion Day victories.
Bush said the clear message from Election
Day was that "people feel they're taxed too
much."
