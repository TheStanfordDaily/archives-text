# Soviets may support offensive in Mideast
## 
### 
A U.S. campaign to gain support for
U.N. military action against Iraq got a
boost yesterday, with the Soviet Union
offering its qualified approval. Presi
dent Bush, as expected, ordered a new
round of troop deployments, adding up
to 150,000 soldiers to the multina
tional force facing off against Iraq.
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze said military might
should not be ruled out, but cautioned
it should be used only under U.N. aus
pices.
"A situation may emerge which
effectively would require such a
move," Shevardnadze said.
He played down any differences on
Iraq between the superpowers. Before
Baghdad's invasion of Kuwait,

Moscow was Baghdad's principal ally
and principal weapons supplier.
"I would advise against looking for
some difference in the positions
between the Soviet Union and the
United States," Shevardnadze told
reporters.
"We're on the same wavelength"
with Gorbachev in terms of his policy
goals in the Middle East, Bush said. He
added that there were no "mixed sig
nals" from Moscow.
The deployment of as many as
150,000 troops represents a substan
tial addition to the 230,000 U.S. mili
tary personnel in the region. Allies
from 26 countries have sent 70,000
soldiers to the multinational force
assembled in the area.

"If this movement of force is what
convinces him (Saddam), so much the
better," Bush said in a nationwide
broadcast from Washington. "Let's
hope he comes to his senses."
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, giv
ing details of the new buildup, said it
would include two armored divisions
and small armored units from Ger
many as well as the famed "Big Red
One" First Infantry Division (Mecha
nized) from Fort Riley, Kans.
Pentagon officials in private conver
sations said full deployment of the
units would total about 150,000
troops.
Said Bush, "We're talking about
significant numbers" of troops.
Cheney, who faced reporters after

Bush, added, "We will not put an
upper limit on this deployment."
Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, said, "Whether it
will be adequate in the event of going
to war with Saddam Hussein's army,
I'm not going to speculate."
"Iraq's brutality, aggression and
violation of international law cannot
be permitted to succeed," Bush said,
referring to the "dismantling of
Kuwait" by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion.
Former West German Chancellor
Willy Brandt, meanwhile, secured the
release of 50 more Westerners from
Iraq, including Germans, Italians,
Dutch and Britons, the Iraqi News
Agency reported.
