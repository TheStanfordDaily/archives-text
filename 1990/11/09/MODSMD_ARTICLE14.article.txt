FRANKFURT AN DER ODER, Ger
many (AP) — Chancellor Helmut Kohl
announced yesterday that Poland and the
newly united Germany will sign a historic
border treaty this month, ending decades of
concern over the common frontier.
Kohl also said he wanted a wide-ranging
friendship and cooperation treaty to be sub
mitted to the German and Polish legisla
tures for ratification by the end of Febru
ary.
"We are deeply convinced that real peace
will be possible only if Germans and Poles
march together along this road into a
peaceful future," Kohl said of the treaties.
He made the comments following a day
of talks with Polish Prime Minister
Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the first foreign
leader to visit united Germany.

Mazowiecki said he was satisfied with
the "important results" of the talks in this
German border town on the Oder River
across from Poland.
Mazowiecki also said the German-Polish
border must not be a divider between East
and West. "We want this border to bring us
closer and not to divide Europe between the
developed rich and the poor," he said.
The meeting came exactly one year after
Kohl became the first Western leader to
visit newly democratic Poland, a trip inter
rupted when the dramatic news reached
Warsaw that the Berlin Wall had fallen.
The border treaty would confirm the
present border formed by the Oder and
Neisse rivers and commit Germany to relin
quishing claims on former German terri
tory forever.
