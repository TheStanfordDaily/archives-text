NEW DELHI, India (AP) -
India's two largest political par
ties declined offers yesterday to
name a new prime minister, leav
ing only the dissident politician
who helped unseat the govern
ment in the running.
Chandra Shekhar said he has
staked his claim to be India's next
prime minister in a letter to Pres
ident Ramaswamy Venkatara
man.
But Venkataraman, who con
sulted the nation's leaders
throughout yesterday, failed to
summon Chandra Shekhar for a
meeting, leaving open the possi
bility that he might call an early
election.
Chandra Shekhar broke with
Prime Minister VP Singh's cen
trist Janata Dal Party, a move
which led to the historic no-confi
dence vote Wednesday that
brought down Singh's 11-month
old government.
It was the first time an Indian
government was ousted by Parlia
ment since the country won inde
pendence from Britain in 1947.
Singh, whose government was
plagued by a wave of religious and
caste violence and political
infighting, remains caretaker
prime minister until a new gov
ernment is installed.
