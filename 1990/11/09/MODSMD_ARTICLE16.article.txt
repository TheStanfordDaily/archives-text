mentalists to build a temple at the site of a 16th
century mosque in Northern India has provoked

Gupta, assistant professor of
anthropology, said they are linked
to earlier outbreaks of violence
when the government decided to
increase job reservations for low

caste Hindus.
Earlier this month, former Prime Minister VP
Singh described the riots as the worst religious
bloodshed witnessed by the country since the
genocide that followed the partition of India and
Pakistan in 1947. The riots have left over 360
people dead in the past month.
Singh's 11-month-old Indian government lost
a vote of confidence on Wednesday because the
Hindu fundamentalists withdrew their support.
Singh blocked the construction of the temple to
protect minority Moslem rights.
His government, a coalition led by the centrist
party, Janata Dal, was the first ever to be thus
dismissed since the country's independence in
1947. The coalition was supported by both left
wing and right-wing groups.
Gupta, a keen observer of Indian politics,

linked the religious riots to increased job reserva
tions for the low-caste Hindus.
According to Gupta, the fundamentalists were
worried that "VP Singh was projecting himself as
the champion of the lower castes" and eroding
their constituency.
He said the Hindus' demand to construct the
temple was politically motivated, since they
agreed not to raise the issue when they initially
offered their support to Singh's party.
It is widely believed that a dissident of Singh's
party, Chandra Shekhar, might attempt to form a
new government with support from the Congress,
a party headed by ex-prime minister Rajiv
Gandhi.
Although Gandhi pledged his support for
Shekhar yesterday, Gupta said the chances of sur
vival of such a coalition are remote. He said the
Congress would withdraw its support if the con
flict over the temple worsens.
Gupta attributed the failure of the Congress in
last year's elections to the unified challenge posed
by opposition parties. It was only the second time
since India's independence that the Congress had
failed to secure a clear majority of the seats in
Parliament.
Noting that Singh may cast himself as the
defender of both minority and low-caste Hindu
rights, Gupta concluded, "Nobody can predict
what will happen in the (next) elections."
