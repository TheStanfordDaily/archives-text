NEW YORK (AP) - Mayor
David Dinkins announced $338
million in cutbacks yesterday,
including a reduction of 5,500 city
jobs this fiscal year, and perhaps
20,000 next year.
"Today, I have some bad news
and some worse news," Dinkins
told reporters.
The bad news, he said,
"requires painful sacrifices from
every part of our administration,"
including a 10 percent cut in the
mayoral staff.

The worse news was that on
Jan. 15 he will be back with
another proposal for the fiscal
year beginning in July to close a
budget gap that has grown to $1.6
billion.
Already this year, the mayor
has closed a gap of $1.8 billion in
the fiscal year that began in July
through budget cuts, ordered a
hiring freeze and cut the pay of
top management by 5 percent,
including lopping $6,500 off his
own salary of $130,000.
