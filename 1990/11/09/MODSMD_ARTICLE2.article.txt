# Faculty Senate approves measure explaining role of school lecturers
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
The Faculty Senate yesterday
approved several measures
intended to clarify the role of lec
turers at Stanford, including the
elimination of a five-year "up-or
out" requirement.
Previously, the only way a lec
turer who had held his position
for five years could continue to
teach was through an appoint
ment as a senior lecturer. Many
lecturers found this system unde
sirable because the senior lectur
ers often have more administra
tive functions.
The senate postponed action
on several other measures related
to the role of senior lecturers.
Stanford currently employs

about 300 lecturers and senior
lecturers. Most are used in the
Cultures, Ideas and Values pro
gram, the English Department,
the Business School and the
Music Department.
Lecturers are considered staff
members rather than faculty.
In other business, the senate
was informed about new guide
lines on technology licensing to
start-up companies in which fac
ulty are involved.
The guidelines mandate that if
a faculty member intends to
become involved with a start-up
company, he must inform his
department chair of the request,
indicate why the request is appro
priate and state how potential
issues of conflict of interest will
be resolved.
Based on the chair's recom
mendation, the school dean will
make a decision on the matter in
consultation with the dean of
research.

Since 1969, about 60 start-up
companies have been founded by
Stanford faculty and students.
At its next meeting, Nov. 29,
the senate is expected to vote on a
proposed change to the distribu
tion requirements system. The
proposal places a much greater
emphasis on the study of non-
Western cultures, as well as race
and gender issues.
