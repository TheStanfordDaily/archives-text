## Food Service plans 
### 
Food Service should
investigate all
eating options

Food service's switch
to the point system at Flo
rence Moore, Stern and
Wilbur Halls serves as another
example of budget cuts forcing the
University to act in accordance
with common sense.
With the point system, students
choose how to spend their points
for the quarter. Depending on their
lifestyles and personal eating
habits, they can choose their food
and the quantities.
While the immediate sensation
may be one of choice, University
Food Service needs to take this idea
further. Food Service should be
held more accountable and offer
choices based on students' desires.
The point system gives students
the option not to use their points if
the food offered is unappealing,
but gives students little power to
students to change the overall
quality.
Students living in University
Housing are still required by their
housing agreements to take their
residence's board plan, and no
money is refunded if all the stu
dent's points are not used by the
end of the quarter.
The protest of not eating unap
petizing food is a very hollow one
when the alternative is $1,000
worth of IBC Root Beer and Frito's
at the end of the quarter.
At the same time, Food Service
still receives its money, whether or
not students eat the stuffed orange
squash or candy bars. There is lit
tle impetus for change within such
a system.
By offering a wider range of
meal plans with a correspondingly

wider range of costs, University
Food Service would directly feel the
true extent of student satisfaction
or dissatisfaction.
Students spending at their own
discretion would not feel so much
like captive consumers. And Food
Service would become a more
responsive food-producing organi
zation.
University Food Service should
also continue its efforts in forming
a link with Tresidder, so points can
be spent there as well. Such a con
nection would provide students
with more convenience, and it
would create a more competitive
climate for Food Service.
Last spring's experiment at the
Coffee House, allowing students to
purchase food with "debit" cards,
was faulty in that it only offered
students a way to pay for Tresidder
food in advance. It did not serve as
a way to use credit from missed
and unwanted meals, as desired by
students.
Last year's poor showing should
not be a signal to quit the idea of a
link with Tresidder. University
Food Service needs to continue its
efforts in this direction.
Furthermore, Food Service
needs to consider how it can best
serve the desires of both heavy and
light eaters at the same time.
While the point system may do well
for light eaters, heavy eaters may
do better with the current all-you
can-eat system.
However, offering both a point
plan and an all-you-can-eat plan at
each house may prove impossible
to monitor. In the upcoming years,
students may be required to choose
their housing preferences based on
their eating plan preferences.
In essence, the switch to the
point system is a positive one
because it demonstrates that Uni
versity Food Service is willing to
make changes. However, much still
needs to be accomplished before
students will be satisfied.
