# Joel Stein
## Motility & me: investigative report 
### 
TO THINK, FOR ALL THESE YEARS
I've been doing it for free. You
know, choking the chicken. Bopping
the baloney. Pumping the python. Prac
ticing the ancient art of worshipping the
holy salami of love.
As I drove to the sperm bank, I felt a
bit nervous. My palms were sweaty. And I
knew that wasn't going to be helpful.
I had done everything right. Abstained
for 2 days. Wore boxers. Avoided hot-tub
bing. And I didn't try that thing where
you hurdle the tennis net.
"Hi. You must be Joel."
"Yeah. And this is my friend, Patty." I
had brought her along for moral support.
"Is it all right if I bring her in with me?"
"Well, what do you mean?"
"You know. To hold my, uh, hand."
This was my first disappointment. The
sperm bank had a strict "no friends or
family" rule about entering the Collection
Rooms. Donation, I quickly learned, is
something which should be kept between
a man and his semen.
They started out pretty sublime. His
tory of genetic problems, past diseases,
etc. I was starting to feel better. I could
handle this. After all, I was Joel Stein,
Investigative Reporter. And nothing
would come between me and my story.
I read on. Blood type. Hair texture. Eye
color.
I started to get annoyed. Parents'
ancestry. Was it the Pinta or the Santa
Maria? Do you have any Jewish relatives ?
Things were definitely getting scary. I
tried to remember if sperm banks were
ever mentioned in Mein Kampf.
Then the questions got bizarre. SAT
scores. How ryany years of college have

you completed'? Did my DNA gain intelli
gence depending on how many units I was
taking? I envisioned Don Kennedy hand
ing my sperm tiny little diplomas.
What are your hobbies? Let's see.
Baseball. Rock music. Masturbating in
small rooms.
Write a short essay describing yourself.
I didn't know how to start. "Welcome to
the wild, wacky world of my sperm!" No.
How about, "Hi. My name is Joel Stein,
and I'd like to introduce you to a very spe
cial part of my life — my semen." I got it:
"Sow my seed — it's fresh, zippy and vir
ile as hell."
I started to get second thoughts. Then
I read the bottom of the paper. $35 per
donation. Up to $105 a week.
If I could get in and out of there in 4
minutes (and I knew I could), that would
work out to be $525 an hour. You can't
beat that. Or, rather, I guess you'd have
to.
I didn't know what to do. I was at a
moral junction. So they had asked a cou
ple questions about religion and college
boards.... Big deal. What was wrong
with smart Protestant babies? I like
smart Protestant babies. And for $1,050 a
quarter, I could learn to like them a lot.
I figured I might as well give it a shot.
After all, there was no commitment on
the first deposit. I had a two-week
drop/add period.
And the bottom of the sheet said, "The
Cryobank likes to make every potential
donor's visit a pleasant and enjoyable
one." I couldn't refuse.
So I walked into one of the personal
collection rooms. I checked myself out in
the mirror. This wouldn't be bad at all. In

fact, it was starting to look quite roman
tic.
I browsed through the reading mate
rial. They were all nicely covered with
those wipe-clean binders the airlines use.
Playboy. Penthouse. T&A. I started to
read an article about pubic hair condi
tioner.
Just when I was starting to get into the
swing of things, I was interrupted by a
picture of a little long-haired half-Jewish
boy showing up at my door twenty years
from now.
And then I pictured him hooking up
with another one of my twenty offspring.
Eeeeew. Needless to say, my excitement
had clearly waned.
I left the room with a clean cup and a
clear conscience. The woman behind the
desk understood. But she wouldn't let me
keep the magazine article.
Although the money and fame that my
ejaculation could garner was inviting, I
couldn't ignore the moral dilemma of cre
ating a Joel Stein master race. Childless
couples would have to deal without.
My dad warned me about jerking
around during my college years.
Erectus correctus, baby.

Joel Stein was once a little green ball of
clay. His column appears every Friday.

read an article about pubic hair condi
tioner.
Just when I was starting to get into the
swing of things, I was interrupted by a
picture of a little long-haired half-Jewish
boy showing up at my door twenty years
from now.
And then I pictured him hooking up
with another one of my twenty offspring.
Eeeeew. Needless to say, my excitement
had clearly waned.
I left the room with a clean cup and a
clear conscience. The woman behind the
desk understood. But she wouldn't let me
keep the magazine article.
Although the money and fame that my
ejaculation could garner was inviting, I
couldn't ignore the moral dilemma of cre
ating a Joel Stein master race. Childless
couples would have to deal without.
My dad warned me about jerking
around during my college years.
Erectus correctus, baby.

Joel Stein was once a little green ball of
clay. His column appears every Friday.

TO THINK, FOR ALL THESE YEARS
I've been doing it for free. You
know, choking the chicken. Bopping
the baloney. Pumping the python. Prac
ticing the ancient art of worshipping the
holy salami of love.
As I drove to the sperm bank, I felt a
bit nervous. My palms were sweaty. And I
knew that wasn't going to be helpful.
I had done everything right. Abstained
for 2 days. Wore boxers. Avoided hot-tub
bing. And I didn't try that thing where
you hurdle the tennis net.
"Hi. You must be Joel."
"Yeah. And this is my friend, Patty." I
had brought her along for moral support.
"Is it all right if I bring her in with me?"
"Well, what do you mean?"
"You know. To hold my, uh, hand."
This was my first disappointment. The
sperm bank had a strict "no friends or
family" rule about entering the Collection
Rooms. Donation, I quickly learned, is
something which should be kept between
a man and his semen.
They started out pretty sublime. His
tory of genetic problems, past diseases,
etc. I was starting to feel better. I could
handle this. After all, I was Joel Stein,
Investigative Reporter. And nothing
would come between me and my story.
I read on. Blood type. Hair texture. Eye
color.
I started to get annoyed. Parents'
ancestry. Was it the Pinta or the Santa
Maria? Do you have any Jewish relatives ?
Things were definitely getting scary. I
tried to remember if sperm banks were
ever mentioned in Mein Kampf.
Then the questions got bizarre. SAT
scores. How ryany years of college have

you completed'? Did my DNA gain intelli
gence depending on how many units I was
taking? I envisioned Don Kennedy hand
ing my sperm tiny little diplomas.
What are your hobbies? Let's see.
Baseball. Rock music. Masturbating in
small rooms.
Write a short essay describing yourself.
I didn't know how to start. "Welcome to
the wild, wacky world of my sperm!" No.
How about, "Hi. My name is Joel Stein,
and I'd like to introduce you to a very spe
cial part of my life — my semen." I got it:
"Sow my seed — it's fresh, zippy and vir
ile as hell."
I started to get second thoughts. Then
I read the bottom of the paper. $35 per
donation. Up to $105 a week.
If I could get in and out of there in 4
minutes (and I knew I could), that would
work out to be $525 an hour. You can't
beat that. Or, rather, I guess you'd have
to.
I didn't know what to do. I was at a
moral junction. So they had asked a cou
ple questions about religion and college
boards.... Big deal. What was wrong
with smart Protestant babies? I like
smart Protestant babies. And for $1,050 a
quarter, I could learn to like them a lot.
I figured I might as well give it a shot.
After all, there was no commitment on
the first deposit. I had a two-week
drop/add period.
And the bottom of the sheet said, "The
Cryobank likes to make every potential
donor's visit a pleasant and enjoyable
one." I couldn't refuse.
So I walked into one of the personal
collection rooms. I checked myself out in
the mirror. This wouldn't be bad at all. In

fact, it was starting to look quite roman
tic.
I browsed through the reading mate
rial. They were all nicely covered with
those wipe-clean binders the airlines use.
Playboy. Penthouse. T&A. I started to
read an article about pubic hair condi
tioner.
