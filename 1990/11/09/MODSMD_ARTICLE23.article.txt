## Freshmen should be randomly assigned to theme houses 
### 
WE ARE WRITING IN RESPONSE
to the Oct. 25 Daily editorial
regarding the placement of
freshmen in ethnic theme houses. While
the editorial recognizes the valuable con
tribution of theme houses to the Stan
ford community, its suggestion that
freshmen should not be placed randomly
in theme houses negatively characterizes
the houses as residences that — because
of their differences — are not a normal
and desirable place in which to live.
Theme houses offer the same educa
tional and social activities as all other
houses in which freshmen live: they
sponsor faculty visits, discussion groups,
study breaks, trips, parties and other
events of interest to new students.
They also offer residence-based
classes, and they have a house govern
ment, social committees and intramural
teams in which students can gain organi
zational and leadership experience. Like
other houses, theme houses have a resi
dent fellow and resident assistants and a
team of faculty and staff academic advis
ers.
In addition, theme houses offer spe-

cial programs that explore the history
and culture of the ethnic group that is
the focus of the theme and that examine
cultural differences among all residents.
These programs enhance and enrich the
basic educational activities of the house
and offer all freshmen and upperclass
students a special opportunity to reach
beyond their own cultural experience.
The Daily editorial implies that stu
dents are only assigned randomly to
theme houses and not to other freshman
residences. In a typical year, about 65
percent of freshmen are assigned to their
first choice of housing. Because demand
for a particular type of residence some
times exceeds supply, we are often
unable to meet students' first prefer
ences for a particular type of house and
must assign students to lower choices.
Just as some students cannot be
assigned to an all-freshman house and
are consequently assigned to a four-class
house, some students are assigned to
theme houses who did not request to live
there. Random assignments to theme
houses are not viewed as different from
random assignments to any other house,
nor should they be.

If students were not randomly
assigned to cross-cultural theme houses,
one of the houses' fundamental compo
nents — their cross-cultural nature —
might be undermined. If not enough stu
dents of ethnicities different from the
theme requested assignment to a partic
ular house, the cross-cultural learning
experience of all students in the house
would be impeded.
The Daily also recommended that
Native American freshmen be assigned
to Muwekma-tah-ruk, despite its loca
tion on the Row. Because of its current
location, Muwekma-tah-ruk cannot pro
vide the kind of programming that has
been found to be important and desirable
for freshmen.
The small size of the house does not
allow assignment of a large enough num
ber of freshmen to provide a core around
which programs designed for new stu
dents can be developed. The house is also
isolated from other houses in which
freshmen live and would not offer suffi
cient opportunities for interaction with
other freshmen.
To address the needs of entering
Native American students, freshmen can

currently request to be assigned to Casa
Zapata, which includes a Native Ameri
can community in addition to the Chi
cano/Mexican-American theme program.
Zapata serves as a sister dorm to
Muwekma-tah-ruk, and the two houses
hold joint programs and get-togethers.
As interest in living in Muwekma-tah
ruk grows among both freshmen and
upperclass students, consideration can
be given to relocating the house in the
future to one more appropriate for a
four-class program.
We hope this letter helps explain some
of the reasoning behind current housing
assignment policies for freshmen in
theme houses. These policies have been
developed with student participation by
University committees, and have been
consistently reaffirmed and supported by
students and administrators alike for a
number of years.
