# A
						real marching band would create more school spirit

I'm sure many Stanford students
agree with Chris Adamson's letter to
The Daily which defends the Stanford
Band. But there must be students out
there, especially ones from the Midwest,
who know what a real university march
ing band is like.
I am referring to bands like the awe
inspiring Ohio State and Michigan bands
which make tears come to your eyes and
leave a lump in your throat when they

perform, bands that number over 300
and in which there is competition for
each and every one of 50 trumpet spots.
When you see 300 dedicated musi
cians lined up at four-step intervals over
the entire football field, polished horns
gleaming, bright uniforms pressed and
worn with dignity, playing the theme
song everybody knows and loves, which,
incidentally, seems a lot louder because
the musicians have taken care to tune
their instruments before the show, a true
school spirit inevitably forms.
The fans go wild, and even if the
home team is losing 28-0 at the half, the
half-time show instills more spirit into
the crowd — because when you see the
band, the color guard and the dancers

lined up on the track, waiting to per
form, it reminds you that there will
always be this wonderful tradition.
The combination of music and march
ing is an art and has nothing to do with
politics or rebellion. The purpose of a
university marching band is to play for
the football crowd — not the other way
around.
I want our football team to be the
best, and that is why I think they, the
generous alumni, the students and the
local fans who help support them
deserve to have the benefit of seeing and
hearing a first-rate marching band.
As much as I love Stanford, I'm
almost sorry I didn't stay in my home
town. I would have had the benefit of

playing for the Arizona Wildcats March
ing Band — one of the best in the West.
We need some pride, and our band is
not helping us get it. They are having
their own little party, and every one else
feels alienated, excluded or insulted.
Let's start a real marching band as soon
as we can.
It may be too late for the seniors, but
imagine the increased prestige and
attraction of both the sports and music
departments. Stanford sets an example
for the rest of the Western universities
and colleges in almost every area, and
our marching band should not be an
exception.
