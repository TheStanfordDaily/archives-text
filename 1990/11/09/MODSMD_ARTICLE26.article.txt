IN MY PREVIOUS ARTICLE, I
described why I believe government
has no right to regulate what adults
do in private, meaning that laws which
forbid the use of drugs and which outlaw
drinking for those 18 to 21 have no
authority. In this article, I discuss my
reaction to the new campus drug and
alcohol policy.
First of all, it would be nice to see a
copy, but Stanford doesn't seem willing to
make available to me a policy that threat
ens to fire me and that I've lived under for
the past month.
I called the office of its author, Susan
Hoerger, but was told by her secretary
that she didn't want to distribute the new
policy to "everyone on campus" and that I
should get a copy through my department
chair. I have contacted the chairman's
office several times since then, but they
have no copy of the policy either.
I have an odd combination of reactions
to what I do know about the policy. First,
while I do not recognize the government's
authority to limit drug and alcohol use of
citizens 18 or over, I do think that Stan
ford as a private institution has the right
to expel students or fire staff for such
behavior. I would try to convince mem
bers of the institution to behave other
wise, but I don't think I have an invio
lable "right" to my job at Stanford.
But even though I think it is Stan
ford's prerogative to pass such a policy, I
do not think it can succeed as an institu
tion of higher learning if it does not
encourage its students, faculty and staff
to take responsibility for their own
choices and if it does not afford each of
them some sphere of privacy in which to
function. In short, if Stanford becomes a
regulatory institution and invades the

privacy of its students, faculty and staff,
it will ultimately deteriorate in its effec
tiveness as a university.
Most importantly, I think students
must feel that the privacy of dorm rooms
on campus will not be violated. The Uni
versity should be indifferent to any pri
vate activity taking place between con
senting adults in a dorm room, even if
that activity includes underage drinking
or use of illegal drugs. I believe this holds
even for dorm parties and activities in
dorm common areas, as long as everyone
in the dorm feels comfortable about it.
Similarly, the University has no busi
ness interfering with analogous activity
in the home or apartment of a faculty or
staff member, even if it happens to be on
Stanford land.
Furthermore, Stanford should not
limit what students, faculty and staff

carry on their persons while on campus or
at campus activities. I, for example, often
carry illegal drugs in my backpack, and I
refuse to work for an institution that
wants to dictate what personal items I
will carry around with me.
What bothers me most about the new
policy is that it was not initiated because
of any perceived problem, but as a reac
tion to coercion. The federal government
has no idea of what is best for Stanford's
residences and activities, and I find their
interference offensive.
I am equally distressed by Stanford's
response. For all of our talk about being
courageous and experimenting with a
new and better kind of university, we run
for cover at the first sign of trouble and
allow an external entity to make our deci
sions for us.
I do not think the federal government
would have made good on its threat if we
failed to meet its standards. A similar
showdown came in the summer of 1982.
The Judge Advocate General of the Army
wrote a letter to Harvard, Yale, Columbia,
New York University, UCLA and Wayne
State Universities warning them that
their Department of Defense funding
would be cut off unless they stopped ban
ning army recruiters from their law
schools.
Those schools refused to allow Defense
Department recruiters on campus
because the department openly discrimi
nates against gays, lesbians and bisexu
als. The threat was made, the schools
refused to change their policies, and noth
ing happened.
Stanford missed the entire controversy
because, cowering sheep that we are, at
that time we didn't ban Defense Depart
ment recruiters. (Our Law School now
does ban them from their facilities,
although the administration still uses the
Defense Department threat as an excuse
for allowing them into the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center).
In my personal life, I've found that
government most often accomplishes its

The University should be

activity taking place
between consenting adults
in a dorm room, even if
that activity includes
underage drinking or use
of illegal drugs.

goals by threats it never intends to carry
out. For example, when I was recently
banned from my Northern Virginia high
school because I'm openly gay, I decided
that it was time to challenge Virginia's
anti-sodomy law. I presented myself for
arrest at two different police stations, but
they had no interest in arresting me. (In
fact, they refused to arrest me, even
though they agreed I was clearly guilty of
a felony).
My advice regarding the new alcohol
and drug policy is to defy it and to do so as
openly as you are willing to do. I encour
age students to insist on the right to
decide whether they will drink or do
drugs in their own dorm rooms.
I encourage resident assistants and
resident fellows to refuse to enforce this
policy and to reserve the right to set the
social tone for their own dorms. And I
encourage faculty and staff to deny the
University any right to dictate what they
will do in their own homes and what they
will carry with them on campus.
As for myself, I have done illegal drugs
in the past and I will continue to do so. I
have never taught class or held office
hours while under the influence of drugs
or alcohol, but I have kept illegal drugs in
my backpack while on campus, and I will
do so in the future.
I know that my attitude about drugs
will be shocking to many, especially given
the recent success of anti-drug propa

ganda. I don't claim to know everything
about drug use in America, but I know
about my own life. On the positive side,
drugs have provided many enjoyable and
memorable experiences and my use of
drugs has been an extremely important
influence in my emotional, intellectual
and spiritual development.
As for negatives, I have not experi
enced any of the nightmares that suppos
edly go along with drugs. My greatest fear
was the loss of conscious control, but in
ten years of drug use I've never once
experienced an uncontrollable lapse in
awareness or judgment. As for the "dark
spiral of drug addiction," I have had liter
ally hundreds of friends who used illegal
drugs, and not one of them has turned to
a life of crime or become hopelessly
addicted to drugs.
As for drug dealers, I have been good
friends with a half dozen of them, and
none have been the least bit violent and
all felt that selling drugs to children was
immoral. In fact, I've had more interest
ing discussions about morality with drug
dealers than I've ever had with Stanford
administrators or government officials.
In conclusion, let me mention that one
of the most important events in my devel
opment as a human being has been the
realization that government has no busi
ness making my choices for me and the
subsequent determination on my part to
openly oppose any such encroachment.
I realize that I might be arrested or
fired and that nobody will care that I
drove the speed limit while breaking the
drug and sodomy laws, and I fully expect
that any such hardship on my part would
go mostly unnoticed.
The only alternative is to surrender
control over my future to a distant and
alien power, and I do not understand how
any self-respecting individual, or self
respecting institution for that matter, can
possibly do so.

IN MY PREVIOUS ARTICLE, I
described why I believe government
has no right to regulate what adults
do in private, meaning that laws which
forbid the use of drugs and which outlaw
drinking for those 18 to 21 have no
authority. In this article, I discuss my
reaction to the new campus drug and
alcohol policy.
First of all, it would be nice to see a
copy, but Stanford doesn't seem willing to
make available to me a policy that threat
ens to fire me and that I've lived under for
the past month.
I called the office of its author, Susan
Hoerger, but was told by her secretary
that she didn't want to distribute the new
policy to "everyone on campus" and that I
should get a copy through my department
chair. I have contacted the chairman's
office several times since then, but they
have no copy of the policy either.
I have an odd combination of reactions
to what I do know about the policy. First,
while I do not recognize the government's
authority to limit drug and alcohol use of
citizens 18 or over, I do think that Stan
ford as a private institution has the right
to expel students or fire staff for such
behavior. I would try to convince mem
bers of the institution to behave other
wise, but I don't think I have an invio
lable "right" to my job at Stanford.
But even though I think it is Stan
ford's prerogative to pass such a policy, I
do not think it can succeed as an institu
tion of higher learning if it does not
encourage its students, faculty and staff
to take responsibility for their own
choices and if it does not afford each of
them some sphere of privacy in which to
function. In short, if Stanford becomes a
regulatory institution and invades the

privacy of its students, faculty and staff,
it will ultimately deteriorate in its effec
tiveness as a university.
Most importantly, I think students
must feel that the privacy of dorm rooms
on campus will not be violated. The Uni
versity should be indifferent to any pri
vate activity taking place between con
senting adults in a dorm room, even if
that activity includes underage drinking
or use of illegal drugs. I believe this holds
even for dorm parties and activities in
dorm common areas, as long as everyone
in the dorm feels comfortable about it.
Similarly, the University has no busi
ness interfering with analogous activity
in the home or apartment of a faculty or
staff member, even if it happens to be on
Stanford land.
Furthermore, Stanford should not
limit what students, faculty and staff

carry on their persons while on campus or
at campus activities. I, for example, often
carry illegal drugs in my backpack, and I
refuse to work for an institution that
wants to dictate what personal items I
will carry around with me.
What bothers me most about the new
policy is that it was not initiated because
of any perceived problem, but as a reac
tion to coercion. The federal government
has no idea of what is best for Stanford's
residences and activities, and I find their
interference offensive.
I am equally distressed by Stanford's
response. For all of our talk about being
courageous and experimenting with a
new and better kind of university, we run
for cover at the first sign of trouble and
allow an external entity to make our deci
sions for us.
I do not think the federal government
would have made good on its threat if we
failed to meet its standards. A similar
showdown came in the summer of 1982.
The Judge Advocate General of the Army
wrote a letter to Harvard, Yale, Columbia,
New York University, UCLA and Wayne
State Universities warning them that
their Department of Defense funding
would be cut off unless they stopped ban
ning army recruiters from their law
schools.
Those schools refused to allow Defense
Department recruiters on campus
because the department openly discrimi
nates against gays, lesbians and bisexu
als. The threat was made, the schools
refused to change their policies, and noth
ing happened.
Stanford missed the entire controversy
because, cowering sheep that we are, at
that time we didn't ban Defense Depart
ment recruiters. (Our Law School now
does ban them from their facilities,
although the administration still uses the
Defense Department threat as an excuse
for allowing them into the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center).
In my personal life, I've found that
government most often accomplishes its

The University should be

activity taking place
between consenting adults
in a dorm room, even if
that activity includes
underage drinking or use
of illegal drugs.

goals by threats it never intends to carry
out. For example, when I was recently
banned from my Northern Virginia high
school because I'm openly gay, I decided
that it was time to challenge Virginia's
anti-sodomy law. I presented myself for
arrest at two different police stations, but
they had no interest in arresting me. (In
fact, they refused to arrest me, even
though they agreed I was clearly guilty of
a felony).
My advice regarding the new alcohol
and drug policy is to defy it and to do so as
openly as you are willing to do. I encour
age students to insist on the right to
decide whether they will drink or do
drugs in their own dorm rooms.
I encourage resident assistants and
resident fellows to refuse to enforce this
policy and to reserve the right to set the
social tone for their own dorms. And I
encourage faculty and staff to deny the
University any right to dictate what they
will do in their own homes and what they
will carry with them on campus.
As for myself, I have done illegal drugs
in the past and I will continue to do so. I
have never taught class or held office
hours while under the influence of drugs
or alcohol, but I have kept illegal drugs in
my backpack while on campus, and I will
do so in the future.
I know that my attitude about drugs
will be shocking to many, especially given
the recent success of anti-drug propa

ganda. I don't claim to know everything
about drug use in America, but I know
about my own life. On the positive side,
drugs have provided many enjoyable and
memorable experiences and my use of
drugs has been an extremely important
influence in my emotional, intellectual
and spiritual development.
As for negatives, I have not experi
enced any of the nightmares that suppos
edly go along with drugs. My greatest fear
was the loss of conscious control, but in
ten years of drug use I've never once
experienced an uncontrollable lapse in
awareness or judgment. As for the "dark
spiral of drug addiction," I have had liter
ally hundreds of friends who used illegal
drugs, and not one of them has turned to
a life of crime or become hopelessly
addicted to drugs.
As for drug dealers, I have been good
friends with a half dozen of them, and
none have been the least bit violent and
all felt that selling drugs to children was
immoral. In fact, I've had more interest
ing discussions about morality with drug
dealers than I've ever had with Stanford
administrators or government officials.
In conclusion, let me mention that one
of the most important events in my devel
opment as a human being has been the
realization that government has no busi
ness making my choices for me and the
subsequent determination on my part to
openly oppose any such encroachment.
I realize that I might be arrested or
fired and that nobody will care that I
drove the speed limit while breaking the
drug and sodomy laws, and I fully expect
that any such hardship on my part would
go mostly unnoticed.
The only alternative is to surrender
control over my future to a distant and
alien power, and I do not understand how
any self-respecting individual, or self
respecting institution for that matter, can
possibly do so.
