James Harboard, president of
the Radio Corporation of America,
explained to The Daily how new
innovations in radio could some
day affect education at Stanford.
"Sound movies, in which you
reproduce a lecturer, with all that
makes apparent personality, will
make it possible, for instance, for
you at Leland Stanford to have
the best lecturer at Oxford, say,
without the present system of
exchanging professors. Faculty
personnel will thus be reduced."
I don't think even the most
advanced special effects could cre
ate the illusion of "apparent per
sonality" in my CIV profs from
last year.
But can't you imagine the pos
sibility of taking classes at Oxford
without sitting in some damp,
musty, 800-year-old classroom
like schmucks such as Rhodes
Scholars have to? You, too, can
take classes like "The Discovery of
Tea/The Beginning of Civiliza
tion'' and "Monty Python: They're
Not Really Funny But Americans
Love Them Because They're
British."

John Dewey received almost
three times as many votes as Pres
ident Franklin Delano Roosevelt
in a Lagunita mock election, win
ning 209-73. Meanwhile, Roble
Republicans sang, "It's the Social
ist herd, that makes you want to
bird. .. . My eyes aren't dim and I
can see, so I will vote for Tom

Dewey."
The Daily then offered this por
trait of a typical voter. "Voting for
her first time, a Union student
started to the polls yesterday. She
was undecided about her vote for
president, but she wore a hat,
gloves and even her pre-war
nylons for 'that date for democ

racy.

This woman is just pitiful. I
mean, I know dating at Stanford
is bad, but dressing up to go out
with an abstract political concept
is lowering your standards too
much. Although I did know a cute
little theocracy a few years ago,
but she wanted me to convert and,

That vote definitely proves
that there used to be other conser
vatives on campus besides The
Stanford Review.

"Playboy" magazine stands as
the undisputed periodical favorite
of the Stanford community,
according to the latest inventory
at Tresidder. "Hugh Hefner's art
and fashion magazine maintains a
sales rate better than twice that of
its nearest contender, "Time,"

The Daily reported.
C'mon. This is Stanford. You
know guys were just buying it for
the articles, to use in their
research papers. I'm sure Hef
would be thrilled to hear his mag
azine referred to as "art and fash
ion." By the way, did you ever
notice that the Playboy bunny dis
appeared about the same time the
Energizer bunny emerged? Is it
foul play? Are they the same
bunny ? I wonder. ..

The Stanford Daily profiled
The Friends of the Revolutionary
Communist Youth Brigade
(FRCYB).
"The FRCYB advocates the
overthrow of the U.S. govern
ment, and, if necessary, the use of
force to do so. For the moment,
however, violence is not part of
the program." The group orga
nizes rallies, and sells copies of its
paper, "The Revolutionary Work
er," in White Plaza.
Two members said they had
not become Communists until
they came to school. According to
one, "I was a Reagan man before I
came to Stanford."
Boy, I'm sure their parents are
psyched they sent their children to
Stanford now. To think, if they
had gone elsewhere, they might
have become members of some
radical political group, like the
Democrats.
Interesting how some people
are secure enough in their Marx
ist-Leninist beliefs to be quoted in
The Daily, and other, unnamed
people don't have enough self-con
fidence to admit their affiliations.
