# Juice, seeds and lunch meat: the Bug answers your food queries
## 
### Amy Gillett Staff writer 
Dear Bug,
We were having a lively debate the
other night about the dangers of swallow
ing seeds. One house resident asserted
that a swallowed seed would sprout in
your stomach. I insisted that this was a
myth spread by older siblings with a
sense of humor. Could you set the record
straight ?
— A French House resident
Dear Residente de La Maison Francaise,
No, this is not a myth spread by older
siblings with a sense of humor — it is a
myth spread by warped and destructive
older siblings. There is nothing funny
about the terrible visions many people
experience immediately after they have
swallowed a seed.
They see themselves "planted" out in
the Foothills, they imagine themselves
and their tree appendages chatting with
Geraldo. They envision a life of being fer
tilized, plucked and eventually turned
into recyclable paper products.
According to myth-dispelling medical

man, Dr. Ray Regan of Stanford Hospital,
seeds cannot sprout in the human body.
Seeds only sprout in stationary environ
ments.
Now you're probably thinking you'll be
able to incubate that apple tree by putting
off all movement and lying fallow for sev
eral weeks.
Be warned: Your grandiose plans will
not come to fruition! There is just too
much activity going on inside our bodies
to provide that loving, sprout-conducive
environment.
Although I can't vouch for what's
inside your body, I'm fairly certain there's
no spare soil lying around in mine. And,
while I'm no Science Bug, I also believe
that seeds prefer soil to stomach acid.
Dear Bug,
I left sliced lunch meats and milk in
my refrigerator for several weeks. When I
opened the fridge door a few days ago, I
was knocked out be the smell! My whole
room reeks, and I can't seem to get rid of
the smell. Help!

Dear SOW (Slovenly Odor-burdened

Woman),
As I'm sure you'll agree, a refrigerator
is simply a preserving receptacle for all
the food we'd really prefer to leave lying
around our dormitory floors. How dare
food go bad when we take all that trouble
to bend over, pick it up and so conscien
tiously try to save it? Why bother using
the refrigerator in the first place?
Heloise would hardly agree with this
icy appraisal. In the "Refrigerator and
Freezer Care" section of "All New Hints
From Heloise," she writes, "Sometimes
we take our appliances for granted, but
can you imagine life now without a refrig

erator or freezer?"
According to omniscient Heloise, odor
ous refrigerators should be washed with a
mixture of baking soda and water. For a
"wonderful aroma,'' add a teaspoon of
lemon juice or vanilla extract to the mix
ture. And for a night-out-with-the-boys
aroma, add a gallon of beer to your
cleanser.
One final piece of Heloistic wisdom:
"Be sure to unplug the refrigerator before
doing any mtyor cleaning." Heloise also
advises against sticking metal forks in
electrical sockets and blow drying hair
while taking a shower.
Dear Bug,
Is it true that orange juice contains a
small percentage of alcohol? Does this
mean I can get drunk if I drink enough of
it?
— Eager Minor
Dear Youngster,
Here's to you! Thanks for forcing me
to make a fool of myself on the consumer
hotlines of major corporations!
I phoned the manufacturers of both
Dole and Citrus Hill juices. Donna, of the

Dole hotline, set me straight. Dole, she
explained, does not manufacture orange
juice, only orange-pineapple or orange
pineapple-banana juice.
And no, she added, none of these
drinks have any traces of alcohol in them.
Meanwhile, Martha, of Citrus Hill, was
awestruck by the question. Was I for real?
She told me that orange juice does not
contain alcohol. Unlike apple cider, which
can become alcoholic when aged long
enough, orange juice simply goes sour.
So drink away, while basking in the joy
that you're not violating the alcohol pol
icy.

Clutter Me, Flutter Me, Flatter Me!! A
reader recently prefaced her e-mail ques
tion, "Does Bug stand for Beautiful
Undergraduate Girl?" Well, thanks for
the flattery (you bootlicker), but this week
BUG stands for Behhh-ing Ululating
Goat. This is, after all, the Farm. Keep
those excellent questions and comments
coming to b.bug@macbeth, P.O. Box
6597 or the Bug box at the Daily. Stay in
touch for the lowdown on the first gen
uine pig to occupy a Stanford residence!
Until next Friday. . . .
