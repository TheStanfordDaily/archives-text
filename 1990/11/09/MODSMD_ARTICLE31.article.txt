## Milburn tears up classes as well as enemies' defenses 
### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
Glyn Milburn is running to
stardom, but his endzone isn't
only on the football field.
Possibly the most talented back
ever to wear cardinal and white,
Milburn isn't at Stanford to
rewrite the record books, or even
to turn the Cardinal around. The
Oklahoma transfer is here for the
education.
With 20 units and a list of
extracurricular activities, the
industrial engineering major sees

the books as often as the hash
marks.
While fellow football players
are planning how to increase their
endurance, Milburn is trying to
figure out how to keep kids off
drugs. Or how to get the most out
of classes.
He is the definition of scholar
athlete.
"He's a role model type of per
son. He studies a lot, gets good
grades and he plays hard," said
backfield-mate J.J. Lasley. "He's
basically what a student-athlete
should be. He's not all football or

all into school. He's well rounded.
He's into other things, too, like
government and Christian ser
vice."
Of course football is important,
but when it came time to decide
his future, the All-Everything
running back from Santa Monica
(Calif.) High placed academics on
par with athletics. Stanford was
perfect.
What?
Stanford? For football?
Even his family questioned
why he wanted to waste his talent
for the then-football equivalent of

the Titanic. Why not a power
house? Why not a bowl team?
"When I started thinking about
college the blend of academics and
athletics at Stanford was unique.
It isn't like any other place that
I've seen or visited," Milburn said.
"There's always the opportunity
to get away from athletics."
He was a Stanford competitor
waiting to happen.
But he took a wrong turn on
his way to the Farm.
He gave into the pressure.
Signed with ol' Oklahoma. The
Sooners were ranked, priviledged
and the epitome of dumb jocks.
Only a few weeks in Norman
made Milburn realize he did,
indeed, need the scholastic angle
of the university experience.
The decision was easy. Trans
ferring was not.
It was Milburn's "Mission
Impossible." Hidden letters, lies
to coaches, the reapplication pro
cess. And Oklahoma didn't make
leaving too easy. Football players
just don't go from Oklahoma to
Stanford.
But it was the only course for
the soft-spoken yet very friendly
running back.
"I went in knowing I would be
going to Stanford," Milburn
explains. "It was frustrating
knowing I made a mistake and not
being able to correct it right away,
but I just wanted to go to Stan
ford. At Oklahoma everybody
associates you with football all
year round. You're grouped into a
catergory. And football players
don't go to class."
He's had no such problem on
the Farm. At Stanford you're
almost expected to keep up in your
classes — football or no football.
Physics has been a little difficult,
but on the whole, no problem.
Excelling in the classroom is noth
ing new for the hard-working
sophomore.
His on-the-field performance is
also more of the same. And more
than what the Cardinal even
dreamed was possible.
The 5-foot-9 Milburn is the
spark plug of the Cardinal's

offense. In only his first year of
eligibility, the halfback/slotback/
punt returner/kick returner has
done it all. He leads the team in
rushing, is second in receiving,
and is No. 1 in all purpose running
and kickoff returns.
He turns three yard pickups
into 20 yard scrambles. He dodges
defenders and breaks tackles. He
finds the slot on five-yard swing
passes and dances for another 15.
He blocks for his fellow backs.
And his talent is just blossom
ing.
"He has the capability to strike
from a long distance away. If you
look at the big plays he's made
this year, he's gone out and caught
the ball and turned it into a sev
enty yard run, or returned a punt
for the distance," said coach
Denny Green. "He gives you the
big play capabilites, and that's
something everybody wants to
have.
"He's a very explosive open
field player, [and] he's also an
excellent receiver and a very good
chop blocker."
Stanford leads are one thing,
but national rankings are another.
Milburn's preformances are help
ing set Pacific 10 Conference stan
dards. His 54 receptions are sec
ond in the league, his 24.3 yards
per return is the third-highest for
kickoff run-backs. And the 1641
all-purpose running yards are
tops in the conference, and second
in the nation. He's on pace to
break Stanford's single season
record of 1998 yards.
And Milburn is rarely carrying
the ball.
A natural running back,- the
multi-faceted player has been
used primarily as a receiver. Stan
ford just can't get its ground game
together, so Milburn has been lin
ing up in the slot. And has
adjusted quickly. He's been a 571-
yard target for quarterback Jason
Palumbis, good for third in the
Pac-10.
Not too out of the ordinary.
Except Milburn never caught the
ball before this year.
His freshman year at Okla

homa, nothing was tossed his way.
His senior year of high school he
caught a total of one pass. One
was thrown to him. Growing up
all he ever did was run the ball.
"We didn't know if he could
catch but it didn't take long to fig
ure out," said offensive coordina
tor Ron Turner, "Last year while
he redshirted we noticed he was
an excellent receiver. He's a real
natural — smooth hands and good
hand-eye coordination."
But as good as Milburn may be
through the air, his natural posi
tion is on the ground. Finding the

Sophomore Glyn Milburn (in the middle) traveled a rough road to get to the Farm, but he made it. And
Cardinal faithful are thankful that he did. Milburn's 1641 all-purpose yards lead the Pacific 10
Conference and are second in the nation.
holes. Dancing around players.
Darting through invisible spaces.
Stanford may not have seen
anything yet.
When the young offensive line
comes together next year there
may be no stopping him.
"You have a lot of people who
have speed. Speed kills, but he's
not only fast, he's quick," Lasley
said. "He's going full speed in
three steps so that's what gives
him the chance. He can go full
speed in the backfield before he
hits the line, then he can stop,
make a cut and get full speed in
two more steps. That's what sepa
rates great backs from good
backs."
"The next couple of years Glyn
will probably have a lot of yards
running the football," Green
added. "Our running attack just
hasn't been there so all our play
ers have suffered as a result.
[But] he's got a great future. He
loves to play the game and has a
competitive edge, so I think it's
unlimited."
But Milburn's on-the-field tal
ents are the least of his contribu
tions to the program. His team

mates welcome his game-day per
formances, but are more im
pressed by his attitude. He gives
his all, every play, every day. Puts
extra time into the playbook. But
off the gridiron, you can't tell Mil
burn from the next student in
Calculus 19.
The humble player would
rather have it that way.
The fewer people that recog
nize him in the classroom, the bet
ter. He doesn't want professors to
treat him any differently.
They don't. But his teammates
do.
"He's lived up to his reputa
tion. He's definitely a great foot
ball player. But what I'm more
impressed with is his personality,"
said wide receiver Ed McCaffrey.
"He's just a great person. A lot of
times when you have players of
Glyn's caliber they can be cocky or
fatheaded, but he's just a regular
guy, and he adds so much to the
team."
"He means an awful lot to the
program," Turner said. "Some of
it's obvious — running the ball,
catching the ball, running back
returns. But he means so much
more because he's such a high
quality kid."
Stanford should feel lucky that
it has Glyn Milburn. And not juit
on the football field.
