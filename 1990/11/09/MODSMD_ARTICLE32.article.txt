TOMORROW - TV: live with PSN,
Radio: KZSU (90.1 FM) with the
entertaining (and finally legal)
Brian Webber and the informa
tive Mark McLaughlin, KCBS
(740 AM). 6:15 p.m. kickoff at
Arizona Stadium.
RECORDS - Stanford (3-6, 2-4in
Pac-10 play), Arizona (6-3, 4-3
in the Pac-10).
MATCHUP — For only the second
time this season Stanford's
going up against the option. The
first time the Card did a pretty
decent job — almost upsetting
the Buffaloes of Boulder at
home. This time there is a twist
— two option quarterbacks, not
one. The Stanford defense has
to be on the look-out for both
Ron Veal and George Mala
uulu, as well as for the confer
ence's second-ranked backfield.
Wide receiver Ed McCaffrey
was merely stellar against the
WSU Cougars last week, help
ing the Cardinal halt its losing
skid by scoring four TD's. He,
as well as Glyn Mllburn and
Tommy Vardell on the ground,
will be looked to to get some
thing going agasint the hot Wild
cats. Arizona upset USC at
home and Oregon before get
ting clobbered by Washington
last week. A winning record is
out of the question for Stanford,
but it is looking forward to spoil
ing the Wildcats' bowl bid
hopes.
