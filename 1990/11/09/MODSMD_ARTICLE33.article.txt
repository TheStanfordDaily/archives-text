# Champs back on the court
## 
### David Hirning Senior staff writer 
College hoops fanatics take note: The long
wait is over.
Tomorrow, the Stanford women's basketball
team will kick off the college basketball year on
the Farm with an exhibition contest against
West German club team TSV Bayer Lev
erkusen. In doing so, the Cardinal will also
begin its quest for a second straight national
title.
The 1990-91 Stanford squad debuts as the
team to beat, garnering the No. 1 preseason
ranking in two national polls. But a host of
question marks and a brutally tough early
schedule also greet the Cardinal in the opener.
Those who attend the game for an early
peek at the defending champs are apt to be con
fused at the number of unfamiliar faces. This
will be Stanford's only preseason matchup, and
coach Tara VanDerveer will no doubt take the
opportunity to try a large number of different
lineups.
One thing's certain: There will be no oppor
tunity to ease into the season and answer ques
tions in the first few games. Waiting for the
Cardinal in the regular season opener will be
the No. 2-ranked Tennessee Lady Volunteers,
in Knoxville, followed closely by a second road
game against No. 13 Long Beach State.
But should the Cardinal lose one or both of
those games, it will not be the team's biggest
loss of 1990. That came in June, when Stan
ford seniors Jennifer Azzi, Katy Steding and
Stacy Parsons hung up their Cardinal jerseys
and graduated. Azzi simply cannot be replaced,
and the team will miss Steding's outside shoot
ing and clutch rebounding. Parsons provided
valuable leadership and ballhandling off the
bench.
"With the three seniors, we lost a lot, in a lot
of ways," VanDerveer said. "Not just in terms
of statistics, but three people that could go very
hard. Our practice intensity and pace last year
was faster and more intense. There's no doubt
[the loss] hurt, hurt a lot."
It also left a lineup that is riddled with ques-
tions. Who will play small for
ward? And who will be the shoot
ing guard? Tomorrow's game
could factor into these decisions,
but VanDerveer isn't concerned at
this point.
"I'm going to leave it up to the
people out there," she said. "Who
ever wants it and goes after it will
probably get it. They'll have to go
after it in the preseason. I hope by
[the start of the Pacific 10 Confer
ence season] to have a set starting
lineup."
One big question mark that
will determine the lineup this
year is a pair of knees, those
belonging to starting center
Trisha Stevens, to be exact. The
senior All-America candidate was
a key part of the Cardinal's cham
pionship drive last year, but lin
gering tendinitis limited her play
ing time.
Stevens underwent surgery on
both knees last April, and has
slowly been working her way
back. Her practice time so far has
been limited, and it remains to be
seen how much she can be
counted on early in the season.
Although starting all 33 games
last season, Stevens only averaged
23 minutes a game. With fresh
man of the year center Val Whit
ing coming off the bench, Stan
ford didn't lose much. However,
with the loss of Steding, Whiting
will move into a starting role, and
the Cardinal will have to look to a
number of different replacements
when Stevens rests.
As last year's leading scorer at
18 points a game, and with the
graduation of the second and
third players in that category,
Stevens' health is a huge factor
for the Cardinal. "She's in great
shape, and we're hoping that
she'll be able to work up [to last
season's level] or maybe a little bit
more," VanDerveer said.
Stevens, Whiting, senior point
guard Sorya Henning and junior
forward Julie Zeilstra form the
core that VanDerveer calls "the
returning foundation of our

team." All saw extensive playing
time last year, and can be consid
ered veterans (Whiting, only a
sophomore, plays with an ability
beyond her years).
The frontcourt players
(Stevens, Whiting, and Zeilstra)
are all big and physical at 6-foot-3.
All could, and have, played the
center spot. Whiting returns as
the team's leading rebounder,
despite her reserve role, with 7.4
boards per game in 1989-90. She
will play the post almost exclu
sively.
Stevens is a devestating inside
player, and led the Pacific 10 Con
ference with a .649 average from
the field last season. That leaves
Zeilstra to play the outside posi
tion vacated by Steding, at
"small" forward. Although not
her usual spot, VanDerveer likes
Zeilstra at the position.
"She can shoot the three-point
shot, she can pass... I really have
no problem with her at that posi
tion," she said. "I know she can do
a great job at that spot. But we're
also going to need her inside with
Trisha or with Val."
When Zeilstra does move
inside, look for 6-0 sophomore
Chris MacMurdo or 5-11 junior
Martha Richards. Both have seen
action in past seasons, although
not as much as perhaps Van-
Derveer would have liked. Both
are former top recruits who
haven't been able to break into
the talented Cardinal lineup thus
far.
Either of the two players could
also move into the backcourt
alongside point guard Henning.
With the loss of Azzi, who helped
Henning run the offense last sea
son, the 5-8 senior will have to be
the heart and soul of the Stanford
team. It will be Henning's job to
the push the ball up the floor in
the Cardinal's up-tempo game, as
well as to force the ball inside in
the half-court game.
Henning's value to the Cardi
nal was evident in the big games
last year. In the 85-71 stunning of
Tennessee, the guard led all scor
ers with a season-high 23. Hen
ning also came through in the
NCAA final as she refused to let

Auburn back in the game, scoring
21 big points. Because of Stevens'
injury, VanDerveer looks to Hen
ning as the senior leader.
"Soi\ja sets the tone for us,"
VanDerveer said. "She's an
incredibly unselfish player, and a
smart player and person. She's off
to a great start ... she's been
unstoppable in practice."
But then there is Azzi's spot, a
large pair of shoes which any of a
number of players could try to
step into. Richards has spent time
at the spot, and is perhaps the
leading candidate. But if she fal
ters, or moves to the small for
ward, sophomore Molly Gooden
bour could be the answer.
Other competition for the ofT
guard position will come from
sophomore Angela Taylor and
freshman Christy Hedgpeth.
Hedgpeth is 5-10 and entered fall
practice in excellent shape,
according to VanDerveer.
Rounding out the Cardinal ros
ter are Kelly Dougherty, a 5-11
freshman who can play guard or
forward, and 5-10 Niki Sevillian,
also a guard. Both will play
backup roles and gain more expe
rience.
With a schedule that guaran
tees four of the first nine games
against Top 20 teams, and two
tough Christmas tournaments,
VanDerveer will find out quickly if
her team can live up to its presea
son billing and last year's stan
dards.
"We have a great schedule this
year, really challenging, which
will prepare us to defend. We want
to got to New Orleans (the site of
this year's Final Four). I feel, and
the people on our team feel, that
we have a great chance to repeat
as national champions."
Does she feel extra pressure as
the defending champs?
"The most pressure I've felt at
Stanford was our first year here
when we had a losing season and
we needed to get great players,"
VanDerveer said. "It's not like we
have a chump team (this year). I
don't worry about anybody else —
let them stop us. Pressure is all
self-imposed, and we know we're
going to have a great year."

VanDerveer and others, senior court general Sonja Hennlng will lead
her troops into battle this weekend against a German club team.
