# Champs back on the court

College hoops fanatics take note: The long
wait is over.
Tomorrow, the Stanford women's basketball
team will kick off the college basketball year on
the Farm with an exhibition contest against
West German club team TSV Bayer Lev
erkusen. In doing so, the Cardinal will also
begin its quest for a second straight national
title.
The 1990-91 Stanford squad debuts as the
team to beat, garnering the No. 1 preseason
ranking in two national polls. But a host of
question marks and a brutally tough early
schedule also greet the Cardinal in the opener.
Those who attend the game for an early
peek at the defending champs are apt to be con
fused at the number of unfamiliar faces. This
will be Stanford's only preseason matchup, and
coach Tara VanDerveer will no doubt take the
opportunity to try a large number of different
lineups.
One thing's certain: There will be no oppor
tunity to ease into the season and answer ques
tions in the first few games. Waiting for the
Cardinal in the regular season opener will be
the No. 2-ranked Tennessee Lady Volunteers,
in Knoxville, followed closely by a second road
game against No. 13 Long Beach State.
But should the Cardinal lose one or both of
those games, it will not be the team's biggest
loss of 1990. That came in June, when Stan
ford seniors Jennifer Azzi, Katy Steding and
Stacy Parsons hung up their Cardinal jerseys
and graduated. Azzi simply cannot be replaced,
and the team will miss Steding's outside shoot
ing and clutch rebounding. Parsons provided
valuable leadership and ballhandling off the
bench.
"With the three seniors, we lost a lot, in a lot
of ways," VanDerveer said. "Not just in terms
of statistics, but three people that could go very
hard. Our practice intensity and pace last year
was faster and more intense. There's no doubt
[the loss] hurt, hurt a lot."
It also left a lineup that is riddled with ques-
