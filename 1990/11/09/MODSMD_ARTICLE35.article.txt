Ybu know that guy in the Reebok
commercials, Lamar Mondane?
The guy who "rains down
jumpers from thirty feet. . .When he'd
shoot from the top of the key, people'd
be yellin' 'lay-up!'"
Believe it or not, he's not a fictional
character. The real Lamar Mondane is
a 35-year old construction worker in
Chicago. He still plays ball in city
leagues and still rains them in from
long range.
Isiah Thomas, the Detroit Pistons'
point guard who grew up in Chicago,
remembers that when he'd play in pick
up games as a kid, Lamar Mondane
would be the first guy chosen. He was
unstoppable. And people really did
shout "lay-up" when he would pull up
to shoot, Thomas says.
In one memorable game, Mondane
threw in five three-pointers in a row,

missed one, then dropped in seven
more in a row.
Mondane never did play profes
sional basketball, however. He is only
5-foot-9, you see. Not many guys that
size can cut it in the NBA.
This tragedy that befell Mondane
happens all across the nation every
year. Thousands of extremely talented
young basketball players have their
careers abruptly ended before they
even get off the ground.
They don't get that college scholar
ship they had hoped for because they
are too short or too skinny. Or they
have dropped out, or have a problem
with drugs, or, as is very common, they
don't have the grades. Most have
nothing to fall back on. The problem of
failed basketball dreams is at epidemic
proportions.
Growing up in America, especially if

you live in the inner-city, and espe
cially if you are black, you tend to play
a lot of basketball. Contrary to the
opinion of some, the reason that the
mcyority of top basketball players have
been black is not because of an innate
physical advantage, but because many
black youths play basketball con
stantly.
I knew people on my high school
basketball team, both black and white,

who played hoop in the morning before
school, in the afternoon at basketball
practice, and then looked for an open
gym at night.
They saw basketball as their ticket
to success. Many had their sights set
on the NBA, despite the astronomical
odds against them even getting
drafted.
Some of the stars in high school will
actually get a scholarship offer. The
top stars get free tickets to majoi 4
schools. These are the only guys who
have a realistic, but still slight, chancg
at making the pros.
The players who get the scholar
ships to South San Guadalupe Junior
College, for the overwhelming mtyor-'
ity, can forget it. That small college is '
going to be the site of their glory years.

But even those who have been
fortunate and gifted enough to
make it to a major college are far
from actually "making it." Most
of them will play some or all of
their four years, not graduate,
and wind up a construction
worker alongside Lamar Mon
dane.
Schools such as Stanford and
Georgetown, schools that gradu
ate almost all of their basketball
players, are the exception to the
rule in major college basketball.
Most big basketball power
house schools lure high school
players there with big promises,
then just exploit them for the
time they are at the school while
remaining blissfully ignorant of
the fact that their players are illit
erate, not on track to graduate,
and will not make the NBA. After
the scholarship runs out, it's see
you later, chump, hope you know
how to do something else besides
play basketball.
The tragic truth is that most
don't.
The blame does not rest only
with the colleges. It begins earlier,
when in high school no one tries
to dissuade the kid from his belief
that he is the next Michael Jordan
or Larry Bird. Teachers, advisors
and certainly coaches should
spend a lot more effort convincing
students that it is much, much
more likely that they can become
a doctor or lawyer than a profes
sional basketball player.

None of these
players could
make a living play
ing the sport they
were so talented
at, and at which
they had worked
so hard.

The country is full of play
ground legends. The guy who had
so much hang time he could draw
three-second penalties on the
other team before he came down.
The dude who had so much
money from the outside he could
sink 25-footers in the dark.
But none of these players could
make a living playing the sport
that they were so talented at, and
at which they had worked so
hard. Such is the harsh reality to
the myth of becoming a basket
ball star.
Attention should be focused on
the fact that when you apply for a
job in the real world, no employer
asks you what your assists-to
turnover ratio is, but whether you
could do the math to figure that
statistic out.

had a basketball scholarship at
UNLV if Stacey Augmon hadn't
taken it.
