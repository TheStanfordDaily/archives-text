Ybu know that guy in the Reebok
commercials, Lamar Mondane?
The guy who "rains down
jumpers from thirty feet. . .When he'd
shoot from the top of the key, people'd
be yellin' 'lay-up!'"
Believe it or not, he's not a fictional
character. The real Lamar Mondane is
a 35-year old construction worker in
Chicago. He still plays ball in city
leagues and still rains them in from
long range.
Isiah Thomas, the Detroit Pistons'
point guard who grew up in Chicago,
remembers that when he'd play in pick
up games as a kid, Lamar Mondane
would be the first guy chosen. He was
unstoppable. And people really did
shout "lay-up" when he would pull up
to shoot, Thomas says.
In one memorable game, Mondane
threw in five three-pointers in a row,

missed one, then dropped in seven
more in a row.
Mondane never did play profes
sional basketball, however. He is only
5-foot-9, you see. Not many guys that
size can cut it in the NBA.
This tragedy that befell Mondane
happens all across the nation every
year. Thousands of extremely talented
young basketball players have their
careers abruptly ended before they
even get off the ground.
They don't get that college scholar
ship they had hoped for because they
are too short or too skinny. Or they
have dropped out, or have a problem
with drugs, or, as is very common, they
don't have the grades. Most have
nothing to fall back on. The problem of
failed basketball dreams is at epidemic
proportions.
Growing up in America, especially if

you live in the inner-city, and espe
cially if you are black, you tend to play
a lot of basketball. Contrary to the
opinion of some, the reason that the
mcyority of top basketball players have
been black is not because of an innate
physical advantage, but because many
black youths play basketball con
stantly.
I knew people on my high school
basketball team, both black and white,

who played hoop in the morning before
school, in the afternoon at basketball
practice, and then looked for an open
gym at night.
They saw basketball as their ticket
to success. Many had their sights set
on the NBA, despite the astronomical
odds against them even getting
drafted.
Some of the stars in high school will
actually get a scholarship offer. The
top stars get free tickets to majoi 4
schools. These are the only guys who
have a realistic, but still slight, chancg
at making the pros.
The players who get the scholar
ships to South San Guadalupe Junior
College, for the overwhelming mtyor-'
ity, can forget it. That small college is '
going to be the site of their glory years.
