# Spikers square off against No. 6 Longhorns

No one should complain about being No.
3 in the nation.
Unless you've hammered the No. 2
team.
"That's the one thing I don't under
stand," Stanford volleyball coach Don Shaw
said of this week's AVCA Coaches' Poll.
"Why we are behind Nebraska."
The third-ranked Cardinal swept the
Cornhuskers at Maples Pavilion on Oct. 15.
Yet, in this week's national polls, Stanford
(20-3, 14-2 in Pacific-10 Conference play)
remains behind Nebraska.
The Cardinal will have a chance to
change some pollsters' minds this weekend.
Oklahoma will visit Maples Pavilion tonight
at 7:30. Stanford will face No. 6 Texas at
Maples tomorrow night at the same time.
While the team had its problems with
unranked California Wednesday night,
Stanford continues to streak.
The squad has won six consecutive
matches and fourteen of its last 15. The
team's national ranking has jumped three
spots in the last two weeks after road victo
ries over No. 5 University of the Pacific,
Washington and Washington State.
"I think we're playing pretty well,"
senior middle blocker Jessica Benton said.
"We just want to get on to regionals."
Before those travel plans can be settled,
the Cardinal must contend with little
known Oklahoma.
While the Sooner√ü are not ranked
nationally, their anonymity may be a potent
weapon. Shaw, who has not seen the team
play this year, knows nothing about the
Oklahoma arsenal or what to expect.
What he does know is all on paper. The
Sooners are 11-17 overall this season and
are 3-7 in the Big Eight. They are led by
freshman hitter Gloria Holcomb, who has
376 kills, 34 aces and 140 total blocks.
Junior Susan Musgrove is second on the

team in both kills and digs. Oklahoma has a
good-sized setter in 6-foot-2 senior Mindy
DeGroot, who has 21 solo blocks this year.
The last time these two teams met was
in 1980, when Stanford downed the Soon
ers 15-4, 11-15, 15-9,15-5.
While Oklahoma is shrouded in mystery,
Texas will provide a clear challenge Satur
day night. The Lady Longhorns are 26-1 on
the year and onlv recently had its 26 match
win streak broken by Nebraska. "Their
record pretty much speaks for itself," Shaw
said.
The Lady Longhorns have a few other
