# Spikers square off against No. 6 Longhorns

### Harold Yu Staff writer 
No one should complain about being No.
3 in the nation.
Unless you've hammered the No. 2
team.
"That's the one thing I don't under
stand," Stanford volleyball coach Don Shaw
said of this week's AVCA Coaches' Poll.
"Why we are behind Nebraska."
The third-ranked Cardinal swept the
Cornhuskers at Maples Pavilion on Oct. 15.
Yet, in this week's national polls, Stanford
(20-3, 14-2 in Pacific-10 Conference play)
remains behind Nebraska.
The Cardinal will have a chance to
change some pollsters' minds this weekend.
Oklahoma will visit Maples Pavilion tonight
at 7:30. Stanford will face No. 6 Texas at
Maples tomorrow night at the same time.
While the team had its problems with
unranked California Wednesday night,
Stanford continues to streak.
The squad has won six consecutive
matches and fourteen of its last 15. The
team's national ranking has jumped three
spots in the last two weeks after road victo
ries over No. 5 University of the Pacific,
Washington and Washington State.
"I think we're playing pretty well,"
senior middle blocker Jessica Benton said.
"We just want to get on to regionals."
Before those travel plans can be settled,
the Cardinal must contend with little
known Oklahoma.
While the Sooner√ü are not ranked
nationally, their anonymity may be a potent
weapon. Shaw, who has not seen the team
play this year, knows nothing about the
Oklahoma arsenal or what to expect.
What he does know is all on paper. The
Sooners are 11-17 overall this season and
are 3-7 in the Big Eight. They are led by
freshman hitter Gloria Holcomb, who has
376 kills, 34 aces and 140 total blocks.
Junior Susan Musgrove is second on the

team in both kills and digs. Oklahoma has a
good-sized setter in 6-foot-2 senior Mindy
DeGroot, who has 21 solo blocks this year.
The last time these two teams met was
in 1980, when Stanford downed the Soon
ers 15-4, 11-15, 15-9,15-5.
While Oklahoma is shrouded in mystery,
Texas will provide a clear challenge Satur
day night. The Lady Longhorns are 26-1 on
the year and onlv recently had its 26 match
win streak broken by Nebraska. "Their
record pretty much speaks for itself," Shaw
said.
The Lady Longhorns have a few other

spokespeople anyway. Middle
blocker Nikki Busch leads the
Southwest Conference in both
kills average at 3.4 per game and
hitting percentage (.376). Junior
outside hitter Janine Gremmel is
second on the team in kills and
leads her squad in aces and digs.
The team's other hitter,
Annette Garza recently had a 21-
kill performance against the
Cornhuskers and has a .299 hit
ting percentage. Shaw is also
wary of senior Quandalyn Har
rell, who he says is "one of the
most physically talented players
in the country."
"They're a real good all
around-team," Shaw said.
"They're a lot like Nebraska."
Like Nebraska, the Lady
Longhorns have decimated their
competition. Texas had lost only
one game in its first nine matches
of the season. The squad has
swept 16 opponents en route to
its impressive record.
The only reservation about
their results has been the quality
of their opponents. Texas has
played only three teams ranked in
the top 20 this year.
Stanford will look to their
four-person assault crew to dis
lodge the Lady Longhorns. Junior
Amy Cooper leads the team in hit
ting percentage at .357 and is
coming off a 17-kill, .439 hitting
percentage performance against
Cal.
Middle blocker Bev Oden is the

team leader in kills, kills average,
solo blocks, block assists and
blocks average. Co-captain
Kristin Klein has 309 kills, 28
aces, 297 digs and 42 blocks.
In Pac-10 play, the Cardinal
continues to have four players
hitting over .300 in Cooper, Oden,
Klein and Benton.
The architect of the powerful
Cardinal offense is setter Carrie
Feldman. The Davis, Calif, sopho
more has quietly contributed 817
assists and 25 aces this season. In
her second year, Feldman already
has the second-most assists in
Stanford history.
The Cardinal is currently in a
commanding position. If the team
wins its remaining matches,
Stanford may host its first ever
regional tournament. Normally,
the tournament is awarded to the
winner of the Pac-10. This year,
No. 1 UCLA appears poised to
win the conference.
There is a possibility, however,
that UCLA may have a schedul
ing conflict and will be unable to
stage the tournament. In that
case, Stanford will become a likely
replacement.
If the current rankings do not
change, then UCLA and Stanford
will play in the same regional.
Only one team from each regional
will advance to the Final Four in
Maryland. The only way this fate
can be avoided is if Stanford and
UCLA finish No. 1 and No. 2 in
the polls.
"I would almost rather not be
No. 2," Shaw said. "I'm more con
cerned with traveling two time
zones than with the opponent. We
don't care who we play."
