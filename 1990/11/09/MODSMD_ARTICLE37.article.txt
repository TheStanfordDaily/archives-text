THIS WEEKEND — The spikers play Okla
homa tonight at 7:30 p.m. and Texas to
morrow at 7:30 p.m. Both contests will be
at Maples Pavilion.
RECORDS - Stanford (20-3, 14-2 and 2nd
in Pac-10 play), ranked No. 3 in the
AVCA/Tachikara poll. Oklahoma (11-17).
Texas (26-1), ranked No. 6.
NOTES — Stanford has only five matches
remaining in the regular season. Texas is
one of the last two top-10 teams Stanford
will face this year. The Lady Longhorns
have compiled an impressive record but
have stagnated in the national rankings
because of the quality of their opponents.
They hope to justify their record against
the Cardinal. The Lady Longhorns will be
without middle blocker Errica Hlbben on
Saturday. Hibben, who is hitting .300 this
year, will miss the trip due to
mononucleosis Oklahoma is unheralded
but is also unknown to Stanford.
For the Cardinal, expect to see sophomore
Kristi Paaso, who recently recovered from
an ankle injury. Shaw has also been play
ing redshirt freshman Kathy Jurgens
sophomore Laurie Sawin and seniors
Cheryl Conly and Tracy Hughes for de
fensive purposes
