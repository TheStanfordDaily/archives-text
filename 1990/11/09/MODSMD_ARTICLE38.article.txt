# Gymnasts start off
## 
### Brandi Shipp 
Over the upcoming week
end, while most of the Stan
ford campus is cramming
for midterms that will
determine their fate in
classes, several members of
the Stanford men's gymnas
tics team will also be deter
mining their fates, but in a
different respect.
Four members of the
team will be competing at
Ford Pavillion on Saturday
and Sunday in a qualifica
tion meet, which is a step
ping stone to the Winter
National meet.
This weekend's meet, pit
ting the Stanford gymnasts
against gymnasts from Cali
fornia and UC-Santa Bar
bara, is a small qualifier.
Those who place in the top
slots at this competition
move on to the Western
Regional meet. The top
gymnasts at the Regionals
then continue on to the
Winter National competi
tion, from which the 1991
United States National
team is born.
The meet actually spans
the course of two days,
beginning Saturday at 3
p.m. with the compulsory
competition. On Sunday,
the gymnasts move on to
the optional exercises,
which also begin at 3 p.m.
Leading the Cardinal is
sophomore Jair Lynch, who
not only was last year's
national champion in the
18-years-and-under class,
but who also placed on the
parallel bars competition in
the NCAA Championships.
Also representing Stanford
is a trio of outstanding
freshmen, Chris Sey, Mark
Booth and Jason Cohen.
