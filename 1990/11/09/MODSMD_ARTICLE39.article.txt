# Tough Blankenhorn travels south with Cardinal water polo
## 
### Aden Fine Staff writer 
Although Chip Blankenhorn
may be one of the most mellow
and laid-back guys on the Stan
ford water polo team, when he
gets in the water, there is nothing
gentle or passive about him.
As senior Chuck Maguy said,
"Chip is probably the most
intense guy in the pool every day.
He's really competitive, even in
practice, and everyone knows that
he is not a guy you want to mess
with."
Coach Dante Dettamanti
clearly agrees with Maguy. "Chip
is really aggressive and tough and
is just like a bull in the water. He
doesn't care who it is in there with
him — if it's an opponent, a team
mate, his mother, anyone —
because he'll do whatever it takes
to win the battle."
In fact, the 6-foot-l inch, 180-
pound Blankenhorn is so aggres
sive in the pool that Dettamanti
jokingly noted that "Chip's proba
bly caused more injuries on our
team than any of our opponents
have. He doesn't mean to hurt
anyone, but he's so tenacious that
he doesn't even notice it when he
does."
Not born with all the natural
and physical talent that some of

the other players on the team
have, Blankenhorn has had to rely
on his toughness and competitive
ness to put himself in the position
he is now in — a starter on the No.
2-ranked team in the country.
"Through tenacity and hard
work, Chip has made himself an
excellent player," said Detta
manti. "He has made more out of
his talent than anyone on this
team has. It's really nice to have a
guy like him on the team to show
everybody what hard work can do
for you."
Blankenhorn has also had to
work extra hard because he hasn't
had nearly as much water polo
experience as most of the other
players on the Cardinal. While
most of the team began playing
polo and swimming competitively
at early ages, Blankenhorn did not
take up the sport until his fresh
man year of high school. And
incredibly, he did not even play on
the varsity team at Corona Del
Mar High School until his senior
year.
Nevertheless, he was still good
enough to become a high-school
All-American and draw the atten
tion of Dettamanti and others.
Blankenhorn, who is a redshirt
sophomore, was still not regarded
as one of the top players in his

recruiting class, so his success at
Stanford has come as a big sur
prise to Dettamanti.
"Chip is one of the most pleas
ant surprises I've ever had as a
coach. I never expected him to be
where he is now. Out of the eight
guys we recruited his year, he was
considered one of the least impor
tant recruits, but now, he's clearly
playing the best out of all of
them."
But such was not always the
case for the 20-year-old from

Newport Beach, Calif. After red
shirting his first year at Stanford,
Blankenhorn saw very limited
playing time last year and scored
only seven goals. But during win
ter workouts, he was moved up to
the starting squad, and he has
remained there ever since.
Dettamanti explained what
made the difference for his ever
improving player. "We just
couldn't ignore him and how hard
he worked."
In addition, Blankenhorn
excelled in spring and summer
workouts and games and became
the kind of player he now is for
the Cardinal. As he said, "The
spring and summer really helped
me a lot. After playing so many
games, I got much more comfort
able and felt a lot better out
there."
Junior Greg Morris played
against his teammate in high
school and is a teammate on the
United States National "B" Team,
so he is in a good position to notice
how much Blankenhorn has
improved.
"He's a lot more experienced
now and is much more aware of
eveiything that's going on in the
pool. He hadn't played as much as
some of us had, so it took him a lit

tie more time to feel comfortable."
From the way Blankenhorn
has been playing lately, it appears
that he is very comfortable
indeed. "I've been feeling really
good in the pool," Blankenhorn
said. "I'm a lot more confident
now and am doing things the way
I should be doing them."
Dettamanti is clearly pleased
with Blankenhorn's year so far.

"He's really a stabilizing force for
our team. He rarely makes mis
takes and is always trying his
hardest. He might not always
have terrific games, but he almost
never will have a bad game."
With this year's four seniors
doing most of the scoring,
Blankenhorn has done whatever
he can to help the Cardinal in its
quest for the national title.
"Chip has taken on a support
ive role and decided to do what
ever he can to help everyone else
succeed. He's one of our more ver
satile players and can play all five
positions well," said Dettamanti.
The one thing that Blanken
horn hasn't been doing that much
of is scoring, but even that is
starting to come around. In the
prestigious 49er tournament two
weekends ago, he scored six goals
in the team's last three games.
"I haven't concentrated that
much on scoring," he said, "but
lately I've been trying to score
more. I've felt really good since
the tournament, so we'll just have
to wait and see if it continues."
Hopefully, it will continue, as
Stanford will need all the help it
can get this weekend against No. 6
USC and No. 4 UCLA.

recruiting class, so his success at
Stanford has come as a big sur
prise to Dettamanti.
"Chip is one of the most pleas
ant surprises I've ever had as a
coach. I never expected him to be
where he is now. Out of the eight
guys we recruited his year, he was
considered one of the least impor
tant recruits, but now, he's clearly
playing the best out of all of
them."
But such was not always the
case for the 20-year-old from

Newport Beach, Calif. After red
shirting his first year at Stanford,
Blankenhorn saw very limited
playing time last year and scored
only seven goals. But during win
ter workouts, he was moved up to
the starting squad, and he has
remained there ever since.
Dettamanti explained what
made the difference for his ever
improving player. "We just
couldn't ignore him and how hard
he worked."
In addition, Blankenhorn
excelled in spring and summer
workouts and games and became
the kind of player he now is for
the Cardinal. As he said, "The
spring and summer really helped
me a lot. After playing so many
games, I got much more comfort
able and felt a lot better out
there."
Junior Greg Morris played
against his teammate in high
school and is a teammate on the
United States National "B" Team,
so he is in a good position to notice
how much Blankenhorn has
improved.
"He's a lot more experienced
now and is much more aware of
eveiything that's going on in the
pool. He hadn't played as much as
some of us had, so it took him a lit

tie more time to feel comfortable."
From the way Blankenhorn
has been playing lately, it appears
that he is very comfortable
indeed. "I've been feeling really
good in the pool," Blankenhorn
said. "I'm a lot more confident
now and am doing things the way
I should be doing them."
Dettamanti is clearly pleased
with Blankenhorn's year so far.

"He's really a stabilizing force for
our team. He rarely makes mis
takes and is always trying his
hardest. He might not always
have terrific games, but he almost
never will have a bad game."
With this year's four seniors
doing most of the scoring,
Blankenhorn has done whatever
he can to help the Cardinal in its
quest for the national title.
"Chip has taken on a support
ive role and decided to do what
ever he can to help everyone else
succeed. He's one of our more ver
satile players and can play all five
positions well," said Dettamanti.
The one thing that Blanken
horn hasn't been doing that much
of is scoring, but even that is
starting to come around. In the
prestigious 49er tournament two
weekends ago, he scored six goals
in the team's last three games.
"I haven't concentrated that
much on scoring," he said, "but
lately I've been trying to score
more. I've felt really good since
the tournament, so we'll just have
to wait and see if it continues."
Hopefully, it will continue, as
Stanford will need all the help it
can get this weekend against No. 6
USC and No. 4 UCLA.

Although Chip Blankenhorn
may be one of the most mellow
and laid-back guys on the Stan
ford water polo team, when he
gets in the water, there is nothing
gentle or passive about him.
As senior Chuck Maguy said,
"Chip is probably the most
intense guy in the pool every day.
He's really competitive, even in
practice, and everyone knows that
he is not a guy you want to mess
with."
Coach Dante Dettamanti
clearly agrees with Maguy. "Chip
is really aggressive and tough and
is just like a bull in the water. He
doesn't care who it is in there with
him — if it's an opponent, a team
mate, his mother, anyone —
because he'll do whatever it takes
to win the battle."
In fact, the 6-foot-l inch, 180-
pound Blankenhorn is so aggres
sive in the pool that Dettamanti
jokingly noted that "Chip's proba
bly caused more injuries on our
team than any of our opponents
have. He doesn't mean to hurt
anyone, but he's so tenacious that
he doesn't even notice it when he
does."
Not born with all the natural
and physical talent that some of

the other players on the team
have, Blankenhorn has had to rely
on his toughness and competitive
ness to put himself in the position
he is now in — a starter on the No.
2-ranked team in the country.
"Through tenacity and hard
work, Chip has made himself an
excellent player," said Detta
manti. "He has made more out of
his talent than anyone on this
team has. It's really nice to have a
guy like him on the team to show
everybody what hard work can do
for you."
Blankenhorn has also had to
work extra hard because he hasn't
had nearly as much water polo
experience as most of the other
players on the Cardinal. While
most of the team began playing
polo and swimming competitively
at early ages, Blankenhorn did not
take up the sport until his fresh
man year of high school. And
incredibly, he did not even play on
the varsity team at Corona Del
Mar High School until his senior
year.
Nevertheless, he was still good
enough to become a high-school
All-American and draw the atten
tion of Dettamanti and others.
Blankenhorn, who is a redshirt
sophomore, was still not regarded
as one of the top players in his

recruiting class, so his success at
