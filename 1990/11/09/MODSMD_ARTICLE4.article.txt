# ASSU poll results reveal diverse views

### David Bianco Editorial staff 
Wednesday night's ASSU student poll showed
that the student body is split on the proposed
changes to the distribution requirements, generally
opposed to changes in the alcohol policy and in favor
of the new domestic partners' benefits policy.
The poll, administered by ASSU senators and
dorm representatives, focused on four areas — the
requirements, the alcohol policy, the domestic part
ners policy and proposed ASSU bylaw reforms.
According to dorm representatives coordinator
A.R. Jones, who oversaw the poll, previous polls had
been by voice vote in the dorm. Last winter's vote on
changes in the alcohol policy included some written
forms, though, he added.
Students responded to the poll by filling out the
form distributed at their house meetings or at one of
the graduate schools. The ASSU tried to make forms
available to off-campus students as well.
Nearly 3,000 student responses had been counted
as of last night, and the preliminary results showed
what Jones said was a "surprising" division among
students on the issue of the proposed changes in the
distribution requirements.
The survey included specific questions, some of
which were perceived as leading or biased, about lim
iting election fliers, combining the social and behav
ioral sciences distribution requirements and enforc
ing the new alcohol policy.
Jones said the two most important issues on the
survey were the new alcohol policy and the distribu
tion requirements.
Thirty-seven percent of the students said the pro
posal to create requirements for the study of World
Cultures, American Cultures and Gender Studies
represented too much change, while 35 percent saw
it as "correct change" and seven percent saw it as too
little change. "It seems as if the campus is pretty
much split," said Jones.
But Council of Presidents member Jamie Green
interpreted the results as student support for the
change. She said she considered a response of "too
little change" an approval of a shift in the require
ments. "It shows more people think there should be
change than don't."
Jay Tucker, another COP member, said that those
who saw the proposal as "too much change" could
have voted that way for a number of reasons, includ
ing objections to the labeling of the requirements or
the current "depth of the departments" that would
offer classes to fulfill the new requirements.
Tucker, a senior, also said he expected the Faculty
Senate to consider the opinions of students, who
"brought up the issues in the first place." He said it
would be "a slap in the face of students if they didn't

consider the results at all."
On the issue of the alcohol pol
icy, 59 percent of the students
polled opposed the new federally
mandated rules, while 35 percent
supported it.
Also in the poll, 64 percent of
the students surveyed said they
agreed with the recent changes
affording housing and other
rights to unmarried students'
domestic partners regardless of
sexual orientation. Green said she
thought the 32 percent disagree
ing with the policy made sense in
light of recent campus debate
over the policy.
"In general, I'm shocked and
outraged how many students
have been offended" at the new
domestic partners policy, she said.
Student leaders said they are
hopeful the University will pay
attention to the student opinion
embodied in the poll.
Senate Chair Solina Kwan, a
junior, said the results should
help University administrators

gauge "student sentiment and
opinion," something they have
tried unsuccessfully to do in the
past.
The dorm representatives pro
gram plans two more polls this
year, one tentatively scheduled
for winter quarter on student ser
vice issues. The other may take
place spring quarter and focus on
world issues, Kwan said.
The organizers of the poll said
they were happy with the level of
participation on the campus.
"I feel that we've been able to
reach out to residences through
out campus including those with
upperclass students," Jones said.
Although the poll primarily
focused on undergraduate issues,
more than 300 graduate students
responded as well, he added.
However, of seven fraternities
queried by The Daily yesterday,
only one, Sigma Chi, responded to
the poll at this week's house
meeting.
Still, Jones said he had 400
surveys from the fraternities and
the Cowell Cluster alone, as well
as 300 other surveys from various
Row houses.

change than don't."
Jay Tucker, another COP member, said that those
who saw the proposal as "too much change" could
have voted that way for a number of reasons, includ
ing objections to the labeling of the requirements or
the current "depth of the departments" that would
offer classes to fulfill the new requirements.
Tucker, a senior, also said he expected the Faculty
Senate to consider the opinions of students, who
"brought up the issues in the first place." He said it
would be "a slap in the face of students if they didn't

consider the results at all."
On the issue of the alcohol pol
icy, 59 percent of the students
polled opposed the new federally
mandated rules, while 35 percent
supported it.
Also in the poll, 64 percent of
the students surveyed said they
agreed with the recent changes
affording housing and other
rights to unmarried students'
domestic partners regardless of
sexual orientation. Green said she
thought the 32 percent disagree
ing with the policy made sense in
light of recent campus debate
over the policy.
"In general, I'm shocked and
outraged how many students
have been offended" at the new
domestic partners policy, she said.
Student leaders said they are
hopeful the University will pay
attention to the student opinion
embodied in the poll.
Senate Chair Solina Kwan, a
junior, said the results should
help University administrators

gauge "student sentiment and
opinion," something they have
tried unsuccessfully to do in the
past.
The dorm representatives pro
gram plans two more polls this
year, one tentatively scheduled
for winter quarter on student ser
vice issues. The other may take
place spring quarter and focus on
world issues, Kwan said.
The organizers of the poll said
they were happy with the level of
participation on the campus.
"I feel that we've been able to
reach out to residences through
out campus including those with
upperclass students," Jones said.
Although the poll primarily
focused on undergraduate issues,
more than 300 graduate students
responded as well, he added.
However, of seven fraternities
queried by The Daily yesterday,
only one, Sigma Chi, responded to
the poll at this week's house
meeting.
Still, Jones said he had 400
surveys from the fraternities and
the Cowell Cluster alone, as well
as 300 other surveys from various
Row houses.
