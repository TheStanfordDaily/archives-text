# Stanford legend Jim Plunkett steps into surging Guest's shoes
## 
### Buck Montana Senior staff writer 
He led Stanford to the Rose
Bowl. He's one of Stanford's all
time leaders in total offense. He's
a Heisman Trophy winner and a
Super Bowl MVP
Yes, he's Jim Plunkett and he's
the second-to-last Guest Greek.
The former quarterback agreed to
take on the challange of out-prog
nosticating the Daily's own. And
with the Greek tied for second
heading into the final stretch, he's
not in bad shape.
Like his fellow Stanford alums,
Plunkett is going with the Cardi
nal in yet another upset, this time
a 27-19 thrashing of Arizona.
John Elway actually picked Stan
ford victoriously last week,
although the Cardinal was
favored. But hey, Stanford's only a
six-point underdog this week. A
little desert sun might be just the
thing to vitalize the Card.
The Pac-10 is pretty boring now
that Washington has everything
wrapped up already, but the polls
for No. 1 are far from set. Plunkett
pretty much follows the spread for
the remaining conference walk
throughs (ups! games . . . ), bu*

he's going for the upset in the big
matchup of the week.
Tennessee 19-17 over favored,
and once again top-ranked Notre
Dame, he says. Why? "I hate
Notre Dame. They get too much
attention when they win, and too
much attention when they lose."
This coming from the mouth of a
man who almost chose to wear
blue and gold over cardinal and
white. But it was just too danged
cold back there. Good decision,
Jim.
Why is Notre Dame ranked No.
1 anyway? They lost to Stanford,
at home, for Godsakes. Maybe it's
because Stanford is going to finish
the year at 5-6. Or maybe its
because the Pac-10 never gets any
respect in the polls. Probably the
latter.
Well, it's Daily fixtures Mark
Rogowsky and Chris Crader bat
tling it out till the end. The sus
pense is killing everyone at The
Daily. Who will win the Greek?
With all these visiting prognosti
cators who actually know some
thing about sports, no staffers
should get their hopes too high.
They'll probably all be embar
rassed by the Guests.

Plunkett is going with the Cardi
nal in yet another upset, this time
a 27-19 thrashing of Arizona.
John Elway actually picked Stan
ford victoriously last week,
although the Cardinal was
favored. But hey, Stanford's only a
six-point underdog this week. A
little desert sun might be just the
thing to vitalize the Card.
The Pac-10 is pretty boring now
that Washington has everything
wrapped up already, but the polls
for No. 1 are far from set. Plunkett
pretty much follows the spread for
the remaining conference walk
throughs (ups! games . . . ), bu*

he's going for the upset in the big
matchup of the week.
Tennessee 19-17 over favored,
and once again top-ranked Notre
Dame, he says. Why? "I hate
Notre Dame. They get too much
attention when they win, and too
much attention when they lose."
This coming from the mouth of a
man who almost chose to wear
blue and gold over cardinal and
white. But it was just too danged
cold back there. Good decision,
Jim.
Why is Notre Dame ranked No.
1 anyway? They lost to Stanford,
at home, for Godsakes. Maybe it's
because Stanford is going to finish
the year at 5-6. Or maybe its
because the Pac-10 never gets any
respect in the polls. Probably the
latter.
Well, it's Daily fixtures Mark
Rogowsky and Chris Crader bat
tling it out till the end. The sus
pense is killing everyone at The
Daily. Who will win the Greek?
With all these visiting prognosti
cators who actually know some
thing about sports, no staffers
should get their hopes too high.
They'll probably all be embar
rassed by the Guests.

He led Stanford to the Rose
Bowl. He's one of Stanford's all
time leaders in total offense. He's
a Heisman Trophy winner and a
Super Bowl MVP
Yes, he's Jim Plunkett and he's
the second-to-last Guest Greek.
The former quarterback agreed to
take on the challange of out-prog
nosticating the Daily's own. And
with the Greek tied for second
heading into the final stretch, he's
not in bad shape.
Like his fellow Stanford alums,
Plunkett is going with the Cardi
nal in yet another upset, this time
a 27-19 thrashing of Arizona.
