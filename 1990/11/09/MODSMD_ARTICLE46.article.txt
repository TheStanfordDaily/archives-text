# Deaf women speak out
## Two discuss living in a hearing world 
### Brian Gerber 
When Stanford Linguistics
Lecturer Cathy Haas and author
Mabs Holcomb gave a spirited talk
last night in the History Corner,
not everyone in the audience of 50
"heard" it in the same fashion.
The two women presented the
talk — titled "Deaf Women:
Where They Are" — in American
sign language while a translator
spoke to the audience.
Haas spoke about her life and
then introduced Holcomb, who
spoke about the role of deaf
women in history as well as her
own experiences.
A four-time Deaf Woman of the
Year winner, Haas arrived at Stan
ford in 1975. The following year,
she joined the Linguistics Depart
ment, and she has been teaching
American sign language to Stan
ford students ever since.
Haas gave a brief synopsis of
her life, saying "while my father
always wanted me to become Miss
America," her desire was to
become a nurse. However, an early
childhood illness childhood
robbed her of her hearing and that
opportunity.

Haas said that "many students
have hearing problems and hide
it." Since she arrived at Stanford,
however, the Disabilities Resource
Center in Meyer Library has pro
vided help for many students, she
noted.
Holcomb, co-author of the book
"Deaf Women: A Parade Through
the Decades," a chronicle of influ
ential deaf women, noted some of
the behind-the-scenes roles deaf
women played in history.
After announcing the first deaf
woman in history was Eve, who
had "turned a deaf ear to God's
warning," Holcomb went on to
describe how the deaf had been
mistreated historically. She said
the handicapped were simply
killed by the Spartans and placed
in asylums by the Christians.
Holcomb cited the example of
Mabel Bell. Her husband, Alexan
der Graham Bell, ended up
inventing the telephone while try
ing to make her a hearing aid.
Holcomb urged deaf students
who feel they cannot overcome
their disability "to take the time
and study hard. There really are
no can'ts."
