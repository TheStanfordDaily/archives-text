# Some believe survey asked questions which might have misled participants

### David Bianco Editorial staff 
Wednesday night's ASSU stu
dent poll, the first to fully rely on
written response forms, may con
tain misleading or biased ques
tions, according to some
observers.
Douglas Bone, a graduate
ASSU senator, said that while the
poll was on the whole "fairly well
written," some questions were
biased or simply poor.
For example, Bone objected to
the question posed in reference to
a lengthy bylaw reform proposal:

"Do you think this is a reasonable
proposal?"
He said such a question could
be misinterpreted by students.
"Just because something is rea
sonable doesn't necessarily mean
that you would think that it
should be implemented," he said.
Bone suggested an alternative
question, "Do you think this pro
posal should be adopted?"
But Council of Presidents
member Jamie Green, who wrote
the question, said the issue was
"very complex, and we think that
it was the best thing we could
come up with." She said the bylaw
reform proposal was the result of
a collaborative task force that was
"multipartisan and open to the
student body."
"I just feel like if you didn't
engage in the discussion, it would
be not fair to just say it's an out
right bad proposal," said Green, a
senior.
"You could say it's not reason
able," she added, defining "rea
sonable" as "fine, but not neces
sarily the best proposal."
Green objected to the sugges
tion that the survey was biased in
any way. "There may be leading
questions on it. I don't think it's
biased," she said.
She aTso said she hoped people
would not interpret the presence
of possibly leading questions to
mean "dorm polls are problem
atic."
She said she thought the polls
were "one of the ways that we can
gauge student opinion broadly."
Graduate student Eleanor
Feingold, a consultant for the
Department of Statistics, said the
statements of policies on the sur
vey were "very good" and unbi
ased. She said the questions were
also "pretty reasonable," but she
pointed out that several of the
questions were vague, unclear or
leading.
For example, the survey
includes the question, "Do you
feel students in dorms should
retain the right to choose how to
spend dorm funds?"
"That's a pretty seriously lead
ing question," she said. She
likened it to asking students, "Do
you think you should retain your

right to free speech or that we
should overturn the First Amend
ment?"
In fact, 93 percent of the stu
dents responding to the question
answered yes.
But Green said the answers
would not be different to the ques
tion if it were worded differently.
Bone agreed with Feingold that
the question was leading. "It's
expecting a 'yes' answer," he said.
"How many students are going to
say they want to give up a right
they already have?"
He also objected to the survey's
question on spring election fliers,
which asked how the use of fliers
could be "more efficient and less
wasteful."
Bone, who opposes restrictions
on flyers as a limitation of free
speech, said the question presup
poses a problem.
Feingold agreed the question
could be construed as leading. "It
presumes wastefulness," she said.
She also suggested a question
on the survey about enforcers of
the alcohol policy should have
included a "none of the above"
option. Green agreed.
According to sophomore A.R.
Jones, ASSU dorm representa
tives program coordinator, the
questions were written by a joint
effort of the COR the "head dorm
representatives" and several sena
tors. He said that working under
significant deadline pressure, they
made a strong effort to take biases
out of the questions.
But Jones and Green both said
future student poll questions
would be evaluated by a statistical
consultant.
"We're amateurs and this is the
first dorm poll we did," Green
said. "Next time, it's going to be
better."
