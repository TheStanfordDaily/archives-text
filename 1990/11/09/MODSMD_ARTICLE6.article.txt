# NCAA challenges court ruling
## 1987 decision exempted Stanford students from drug testing 
### Mike Laris Staff writer 
Hoping to retain its drug-test
ing program in California, the
NCAA is appealing to the state
Supreme Court to overturn a
lower court ruling exempting
Stanford athletes from the policy.
The NCAA filed an appeal last
week to tiy to prevent its policy
from being undermined by chal
lenging a Sept. 25 decision of the
6th District Court of Appeal that
held its drug-testing program vio
lated California's constitutional
right to privacy.
The testing policy requires that
athletes urinate in front of an

NCAA monitor. In 1987, Stanford
diver Simone LeVant brought a
lawsuit against the NCAA, saying
the drug-testing policy was
degrading and a violation of her
privacy rights. The University
and two other student athletes
later joined the suit.
Commenting on the NCAA's
latest move in a three year legal
battle, University Counsel Debra
Zumwalt said she doubts the state
Supreme Court will accept the
appeal. If it does, Stanford can
expect to win the case within one
year, she added.
She said the court will probably
decide whether to accept the case
within a month.

In its appeal, the NCAA asserts
that the lower court did not weigh
heavily enough the "combined
judgment" of NCAA member
schools that drug use by student
athletes is a serious problem. It
also states that without testing,
athletes can have "no assurance"
that their competitors are not
using drugs.
Because Stanford athletes were
also exempted from drug testing
in out of state contests, the NCAA
has asserted that the ruling
unconstitutionally interferes with
interstate commerce. The appeal
holds that California is "not enti
tied to project its restrictive [pri
vacy] rules" outside of its bound
aries.
Zumwalt said the NCAA's
appeal is understandable because,
"They don't have anything to
lose." She added that the case
"does seem to go on forever."
According to Zumwalt, Califor

nia's Supreme Court will usually
only take cases that represent
"novel" legal issues, or that have
conflicting circuit court rulings.
In this case, the appeals court
has already unanimously decided
on the facts, she said.
In the Sept. 25 ruling, the
appeals court had written "the
evidence does not support the
NCAA's claim that there is signif
icant drug use among student ath
letes."
