# NCAA challenges court ruling
## 1987 decision exempted Stanford students from drug testing

Hoping to retain its drug-test

NCAA is appealing to the state
Supreme Court to overturn a
lower court ruling exempting
Stanford athletes from the policy.

Supreme Court will accept the
appeal. If it does, Stanford can
expect to win the case within one
year, she added.
She said the court will probably
decide whether to accept the case
within a month.

athletes can have "no assurance"

Because Stanford athletes were
also exempted from drug testing
in out of state contests, the NCAA
has asserted that the ruling
unconstitutionally interferes with
interstate commerce. The appeal
holds that California is "not enti
