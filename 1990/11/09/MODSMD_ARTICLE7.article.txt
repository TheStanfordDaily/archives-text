# Florence campuses get threats
## 
### John Louie Editorial staff 
Five American universities'
overseas programs in Florence,
Italy received handwritten ter
rorist notes early this month
from an unidentified group
threatening "an attack on U.S.
interests."
A threat has not been sent to
Stanford's Florence center, and
while University students in
Florence and their parents have
been warned, University
administrators are downplaying
the notes' credibility.
Georgetown University's
overseas program in Florence,

"Villa la Baize," received the
threat Nov. 2, according to the
Georgetown student newspa
per, The Hoya.
The U.S. consulate in Flo
rence sent letters to all Ameri
can university programs there
Nov. 6 stating that at least four
programs had received similar
notes.
"The U.S. Consulate in
formed our director of Stanford
in Florence, Giuseppe Mam
merella, just to tell [him] about
the note," Director of Overseas
Studies Thomas Heller said.
"We have already contacted all
the students in Florence and
their parents," he added.

Heller said Pepperdine Uni
versity, Florida State University
and the California State Uni
versity system also received
threats.
The handwritten, penciled
note condemned imperialism
and said action would be taken
if there were any U.S. attacks
on Iraq.
Though concerned, Heller
said, "The notes don't carry a
high degree of credibility. I
don't think any parties are in
jeopardy."
Florence police and the U.S.
Consulate are conducting a
joint investigation and have told
students to take extra safety pre
cautions.
Heller said the Florence center
already has various measures
insuring the security of the facil
ity. "We have video cameras over
the entrance, doors are always
locked, and mail is scrutinized,"
he said.
Because Stanford students live
with families scattered through
out Florence, Heller said it would
be difficult to strike at a place
"where there would be massive
harm."
At the Georgetown center in

Florence, however, students are
more centrally located as they eat
in one common building. Accord
ing to The Hoya, Georgetown
University Provost J. Donald
Freeze flew to Florence last night
to discuss with U.S. Consulate
representatives contingency
plans in case of military action in
the Middle East.
Junior Joe Pigato, who will
attend the Stanford Florence cen
ter winter and spring quarters,
expressed concern over the ter
rorist notes.
"Usually I feel invulnerable
because of my age, but now I
don't know," Pigato said. "If this
is a serious threat, it's definitely a
serious worry. But I couldn't
imagine anything keeping me
from going to Florence."
