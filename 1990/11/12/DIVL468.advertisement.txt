To George,
College Is All
Golf And
Champaign.
Champaign, as in Champaign,
Illinois, where George Sakas is a
Master's Degree candidate at the
University of Illinois.
And Golf, as in George's 1987
Volkswagen Golf.
"This car's great to drive. We've
taken it on road trips to Florida
and all over the Midwest. Golf's
got that special, solid Volkswagen
feel." (Hey George, the word is
Fahrvergnugen!)
"Golf's got lots of room for
friends. And its hatchback design
has come in handy for the many
times I've moved."
For practicality, performance and
the fun of Fahrvergnugen, take it
from George.
And take up Golf. /4?i\
