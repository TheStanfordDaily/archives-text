# Papers Project staff finds King plagiarized others' ideas

The editor of the Martin Luther King
Jr. Papers Project has acknowledged that
the late civil rights leader apparently pla
giarized the words and ideas of his
sources in his graduate work at Boston
University.
Project editor and Stanford History
Prof. Clayborne Carson said at a press
conference Friday that some of King's
academic papers — including his 1955
doctoral dissertation — contained pas
sages "similar or identical to the informa
tion presented in other people's writ
ings."

"We found that there was a disturbing
pattern of textual appropriation," Carson
added.
The staff of the King Papers Project
has been aware of the plagiarism for three
years, but kept it secret to investigate it
further, Carson said.
Carson said he had planned to make
the discovery public in an academic jour
nal next summer, but was forced to deal
with the issue prematurely after an arti
cle in Friday's Wall Street Journal
reported the story.
Housed on the fourth floor of Meyer
Library, the project, founded in 1985, has
been compiling a three-volume definitive
look at King's life from over 200,000 doc

uments.
Questions about the authenticity of
some of King's academic work surfaced in
1987 when a graduate assistant discov
ered appropriated information in King's
papers which lacked proper citation.
Further investigation by the staff
revealed other cases of lifted texts in the
late minister's writings. Most disturbing
to researchers was unattributed informa
tion in King's doctoral dissertation.
The 343-page work, "A Comparison of
the Conceptions of God in the Thinking of
Paul Tillich and Henry Nelson Weiman,"
contained words, structure and section
titles similar to another dissertation writ
ten by Jack Boozer, a doctoral candidate

at Boston University three years prior to
King's arrival, according to The Wall
Street Journal.
One passage of King's dissertation
read, "'The basic characteristic of the
symbol is its innate power." Discussing
the same concept in his paper, Boozer
wrote, "A characteristic of the symbol is
its innate power."
Although King acknowledged Boozer's
work in the body of the paper and in a bib
liography, he footnoted it just tvrice in
over 300 pages of text.
Carson said in certain parts of the
paper, which grappled with complex
issues of theology, King extracted entire
passages from the works of Boozer, Tillich

and others.
"It is a case of sloppiness and careless
ness," said Carson, referring to King's
dissertation. In an interview after the
press conference, Carson added that King
"created a seamless text where readers
have difficulty discerning his ideas from
those of others presented in the paper."
But the 46-year-old researcher
implored people to examine the scholarly
context of King's theological writings
before passing judgment.
"The practice of closely paraphrasing
difficult theological and philosophical
texts is not unusual among scholars,"
