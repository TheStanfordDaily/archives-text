# Papers Project staff finds King plagiarized others' ideas

The editor of the Martin Luther King
Jr. Papers Project has acknowledged that
the late civil rights leader apparently pla
giarized the words and ideas of his
sources in his graduate work at Boston
University.
Project editor and Stanford History
Prof. Clayborne Carson said at a press
conference Friday that some of King's
academic papers — including his 1955
doctoral dissertation — contained pas
sages "similar or identical to the informa
tion presented in other people's writ
ings."

"We found that there was a disturbing
pattern of textual appropriation," Carson
added.
The staff of the King Papers Project
has been aware of the plagiarism for three
years, but kept it secret to investigate it
further, Carson said.
Carson said he had planned to make
the discovery public in an academic jour
nal next summer, but was forced to deal
with the issue prematurely after an arti
cle in Friday's Wall Street Journal
reported the story.
Housed on the fourth floor of Meyer
Library, the project, founded in 1985, has
been compiling a three-volume definitive
look at King's life from over 200,000 doc

uments.
Questions about the authenticity of
some of King's academic work surfaced in
1987 when a graduate assistant discov
ered appropriated information in King's
papers which lacked proper citation.
Further investigation by the staff
revealed other cases of lifted texts in the
late minister's writings. Most disturbing
to researchers was unattributed informa
tion in King's doctoral dissertation.
The 343-page work, "A Comparison of
the Conceptions of God in the Thinking of
Paul Tillich and Henry Nelson Weiman,"
contained words, structure and section
titles similar to another dissertation writ
ten by Jack Boozer, a doctoral candidate

at Boston University three years prior to
King's arrival, according to The Wall
Street Journal.
One passage of King's dissertation
read, "'The basic characteristic of the
symbol is its innate power." Discussing
the same concept in his paper, Boozer
wrote, "A characteristic of the symbol is
its innate power."
Although King acknowledged Boozer's
work in the body of the paper and in a bib
liography, he footnoted it just tvrice in
over 300 pages of text.
Carson said in certain parts of the
paper, which grappled with complex
issues of theology, King extracted entire
passages from the works of Boozer, Tillich

and others.
"It is a case of sloppiness and careless
ness," said Carson, referring to King's
dissertation. In an interview after the
press conference, Carson added that King
"created a seamless text where readers
have difficulty discerning his ideas from
those of others presented in the paper."
But the 46-year-old researcher
implored people to examine the scholarly
context of King's theological writings
before passing judgment.
"The practice of closely paraphrasing
difficult theological and philosophical
texts is not unusual among scholars,"
Carson said in a statement issued
Friday.
The revelation evoked much
commentary about the preacher
and civil rights advocate through
out the nation and here at Stan
ford.
The discovery was "not a
morale booster," said Carson, who
has spent over a decade research
ing King's life. "In research you
have to take the good with the
bad, and there is little joy in this
discovery," he said.
"But it is part of the full pic
ture of this man," Carson added.
"King was a great man. He was a
great leader. He was just a poor
scholar."
"I was very disappointed," said
Louise Cook, an archivist who
helped initiate the project and has
since moved to the Carter Center,
a think tank for progressive poli
tics in Atlanta.
"I would like to know the rea
sons why there was such a viola

tion of academic standards and
why it wasn't caught at Boston
University by academic advisers,"
she added.
But Horace Porter, chair of
African and Afro-American stud
ies at Stanford, said there is no
need for people to get defensive
about the recent disclosures.

"His achievements are monu
mental, no matter what," Porter
said. "At the same time, no one
can condone plagiarism."
Senior Louis Jackson, who
worked on the project for more
than a year, said he was "sur
prised at first" when told of
King's shortcomings in attribu

tion. But Jackson agreed the reve
lation would not harm King's
legacy.
The recent news about King
came just over a year after civil
rights activist Ralph Abernathy
reported a less glorified aspect of
King's life and character in his
book, "And the Walls Came Tum
bling Down." Abernathy and oth
ers have questioned King's mari
tal fidelity and other aspects of his
character.
Friday's announcement has led
many to attempt to explain King's
motivation for not completely cit
ing his sources. One theory says
that the derivative nature and
complexity of theological writing
does not lend itself to fully origi
nal research.
Another cites the black
church's oral tradition, based on
synthesis and building on previ
ous, unattributed texts, as a rea
son why King was not meticulous
in his footnoting.
Assoc. Dean of Memorial
Church Floyd Thompkins called
both assertions ridiculous and
said he feared such speculation
would discredit black churches

and preachers.
"To say that theology is deriva
tive is misleading," he said. "Like
any academic discipline, theology
is derivative. The same degree of

citation used in other disciplines
should be used in theological writ
ing.
"Any attempt to desecrate King
based on black church tradition is
an attempt to desecrate the black
church itself," Thompkins added.
"To perpetuate this notion could
put the work of future black the
ologians under adverse scrutiny."
Porter said, "King was a great
man who had his shortcomings.
There is no point in trying to give
some final motivation for his
action. On the other hand, there is
no point in trying to excuse what
may have been an error of judg
ment."
Jon Westling, the acting presi
dent of Boston University, where
King did his doctoral work in the
19505, announced that he has
assembled a board of scholars
from inside and outside of the uni
versity to examine the charges.
