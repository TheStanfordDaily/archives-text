PITTSBURGH (AP) — Stormie Jones, the world's first heart
liver transplant recipient, died yesterday at age 13, hospital offi
cials said.

vicuo nuiu.
The Texas teen-ager was flown to Pittsburgh
from Dallas late Saturday after she complained of
flu-like symptoms.
She was taken to Children's Hospital, where
she deteriorated throughout the morning and died
at 9:52 a.m., said Dr. Jorge Reyes, a staff physi
cian.
Within hours of her arrival at the hospital,
Jones' blood pressure dropped and she became
lethargic. She then suffered a heart attack, Reyes

said. Doctors tried for more than an hour to resuscitate her.
Jones was 6 when she received a heart and liver in a historic
transplant operation Feb. 14, 1984. The operation was necessary
because she was born with a condition that put her cholesterol
levels at 10 times normal.
Hepatitis damaged that liver and this year she returned to
Pittsburgh and received a second liver on Feb. 20. In July, she was
again treated for hepatitis, which damaged her second trans
planted liver.

NEW YORK (AP) — The Daily News stepped up its efforts yes
terday to create a network of people across the city to sell the
newspaper despite an aggressive boycott campaign by striking
workers.
The paper ran a full-page ad yesterday saying it had "immedi
ate needs for individuals who want to own, operate, and direct
their own work force selling newspapers." The ad said in large let
ters: "UNLIMITED INCOME."
Meanwhile, strikers fanned out over the city to start distribu
tion of what union officials said were a million copies of an eight
page, free newspaper titled "Real News."
All the stories in "Real News" were written by Daily News
writers who have been on strike since Oct. 25.
"We wanted to show that the striking employees are the heart
and soul of the Daily News and that we're capable of producing a
better-quality paper than the scab rag Jim Hoge is putting out
right now," said striking columnist Juan Gonzalez, referring to
the Daily News publisher.
