# Pan Am may sell to TWA

NEW YORK (AP) - Trans World Airlines pro
posed buying Pan Am Corp. for $150 million in cash
and $300 million in securities, Pan Am said yester
day.
The proposal is contingent on Pan Am calling off
an agreement to sell its U.S.-London routes to
United Airlines Corp., said Pamela Hanlon, a Pan
Am spokesperson.
TWA also stipulated that Pan Am and TWA would
have to sell overlapping international routes at the
same time the buyout would be completed, she said.
A letter dated and delivered to Pan Am on Friday
proposes Pan Am shareholders receive $1 per share
in cash and $2 per share in securities.
Asked if Pan Am viewed the offer as hostile, Han
lon said she did not want to characterize the pro
posal.
Analysts have considered Pan Am strong in inter
national service, but lacking a strong domestic net
work to feed overseas flights. TWA has been consid
ered strong domestically.
The TWA letter also proposed buying the Pan Am
Shuttle by the end of the year. The shuttle flies
between Boston, New York and Washington, D.C.
Pan Am agreed in October to sell some U.S.-Lon
don routes to United for $400 million. The deal also
would include a marketing strategy intended to bol
ster Pan Am's Latin American routes.
