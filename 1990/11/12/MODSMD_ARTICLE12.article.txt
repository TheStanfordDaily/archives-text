# CNN will fight to air Noriega conversations

### 
ATLANTA (AP) — A federal appeals court ruling
barring Cable News Network from televising tapes
of Manuel Noriega's telephone conversations with
his lawyers was a shocking show of censorship, con
stitutional law experts yesterday.
The Atlanta-based network, which has pledged to
appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, said it stopped
televising the tapes on Saturday morning.
Noreiga's attorneys, arguing that the broadcasts
would endanger Noriega's right to a fair trial on
drug-trafficking charges, asked a judge Saturday to
fine CNN $300,000 for each time it aired the tapes.
George Rahdert, a lawyer at the Poynter Institute
of Media Studies, characterized Saturday's appeals
court ruling as "absolutely an astonishing illustra
tion of censorship."
Rahdert, who represents several newspapers, said
CNN was "playing with blasting caps" by defying a
Miami judge's order against airing the tapes.
"It's rare in general that a news organization of
any kind — broadcast, cable or print — would do
such a thing," he said. "It really falls into the cate
gory of civil disobedience."
Floyd Abrams, a New York constitutional lawyer
who served as co-counsel for The New York Times in
the Pentagon Papers case, said the outcome of a
CNN appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court could be a
landmark decision because rules involving prior
restraint have been very clear through the years.
"We've almost totally banned prior restraint,"
Abrams said. "If the Supreme Court were to uphold
the prior restraint order on CNN, this would be the
first time in our country's history that any such
court order had been affirmed by the court."
In the 1971 Pentagon Papers case, the U.S.
Supreme Court said the government could not bar
publication of classified documents about U.S.
involvement in Vietnam. The Times appealed rather
than defy a lower court order.
The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Satur
day upheld an injunction barring CNN from broad
casting the tapes between Panama's fallen leader
and his lawyers.
