# China will not veto Gulf offensive

### 
China's foreign minister
arrived in Baghdad yesterday car
rying bad news for Saddam Hus
sein: China will not block the U.N.
Security Council from authorizing
the use of force to drive Iraq out of
Kuwait, a Chinese diplomat said.
Such a measure has been
drafted by the United States,
diplomats and U.S. officials said
last week, but had not yet been
circulated among the other per
manent members of the Security
Council.
Iraq had reportedly pinned its
veto hopes on China.
Meanwhile, Iraq said yesterday
it would attend a proposed Arab
summit meeting if It was con
sulted on the agenda, timing and
location and if the agenda
included the Arab-Israeli conflict.
"The proposed summit should
not be part of efforts to prepare
the political theater as a cover for
American aggression against Iraq
and the Arab nation," said an
Iraqi statement read on state tele
vision.
The offer came in response to
an appeal by Morocco's King Has
san 11, who urged an extraordi
nary Arab summit on the gulf cri
sis. He said such a meeting would
be a "new and last chance" for a
peaceful solution.
In a separate interview broad
cast yesterday in London, Saddam
said he did not think the world
was united against him.
The major powers and "a num
ber of countries" are against Iraq,
"but to say that the world is uni
fied against Iraq is indeed not a
correct thing to say," Saddam said
on Independent Television News,
which interviewed him Saturday
night in Baghdad.

"This is not just our impres
sion," he added. "In the state
ments of the U.S. and Britain,
they themselves are voicing their
concern that the unity — so-called
unity against Iraq — is perhaps
suffering from a split.
"The U.S. and Britain pushed
the Security Council into adopting
hastily taken resolutions against
Iraq and once countries began to
realize or gauge things in accor
dance with the historical back
ground," they began to change
their attitudes, he said.
Some recent reports have said
the U.S. government differs with
some allies —among them China,
France and the Soviet Union — on
a timetable for any military action
to oust Saddam from Kuwait.
The Baghdad government also
denounced food hoarders and
announced the price of rice would
increase.
The Iraqi move to punish
hoarders of grain came at a top
level meeting attended by Sad
dam, the official Iraqi News
Agency said.
The Chinese foreign minister,
Qian Qichen, arrived in Baghdad
for talks with Saddam. Before
leaving Jordan, Qian said China
differed with the United States on
the use of force and would pursue
diplomacy as long as there was "a
glimmer of hope" that conflict
could be avoided.
But a Chinese diplomat in the
Iraqi capital, speaking on condi
tion of anonymity, said Qian
would tell Saddam that while
China would not support a resolu
tion authorizing force, it would
not veto it either.
