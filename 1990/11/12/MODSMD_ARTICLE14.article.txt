# Akihito is enthroned as a symbol, not living god
## 
### 
TOKYO (AP) — In a solemn, centuries
old rite at the Imperial Palace, Emperor
Akihito formally accedes to the Chrysan
themum Throne today, becoming the first
Japanese monarch enthroned as a symbol
and not a living god.
Clad in ancient court ccitume, seated
atop an elaborate lacquered platform under
a curtained canopy encrusted with gold
phoenixes and circular mirrors, Akihito will
face a courtyard lined with ceremonial ban
ners.
Next to him on a smaller platform will be
Empress Michiko. Prime Minister Toshiki
Kaifu will lead the 2,500 guests in three
cheers of "Banzai!" — "May you live ten
thousand years!"
Critics say the 30-minute ceremony —
and a series of accompanying rites to be
held in coming weeks — are based too
closely on the traditional religious rituals
used for Akihito's father and grandfather,
who were enthroned as living gods.
Under Japan's postwar constitution, the
emperor is simply a national symbol.
In one controversial element of the rite,
Akihito's raised dais is said to be patterned
after one used by the sun goddess, from
whom tradition says the Japanese imperial
line is descended. Critics say that is an
implied symbol of divinity.
The government is reportedly spending
$95 million on the rites, much of it for secu
rity. Opponents say state funding of the cer
emonies, linked to Japan's indigenous
Shinto religion, violates the constitutional
separation of religion and state.
Leftist radicals, who have vowed to dis
rupt the ceremonies, launched missiles at
three military bases early today, but there
were no injuries or damage, the Defense
Agency said. Radicals also were believed
behind early morning fires at three train
stations.
A massive national security operation

involving thousands of police was mounted
to protect the ceremony and the scores of
visiting dignitaries.
The projectiles were launched at two
suburban bases of the Self-Defense Forces,
or military, and one base in northern
Tokyo, police said. They blamed radicals for
the attacks and for the train fires, which
stopped service on two commuter lines but
caused no injuries.
Yesterday, two bombs exploded at the
house of U.S. Consul General Gregory
Johnson in Nishinomiya, in western Japan,
Police said they caused little damage and no
injuries. It was not immediately clear
whether the explosions were connected
with the enthronement.
A record 37,000 police, including rein
forcements from a majority of Japan's 47
prefectures, have been mobilized for secu-i
rity surrounding the rite.
Dignitaries from 158 countries expected
to attend the ceremony include Vice Presi
dent Dan Quayle, United Nations Secre
tary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar,*
Supreme Soviet Chairman Anatoly;
Lukyanov and Britain's Prince Charles and
Princess Diana.

their homes or businesses.
Yesterday, police vehicles lined the
entrances to the palace, hotels and other
key areas, and officers checked the bags
passers-by. Manholes were sealed near the
palace and police used a low-flying blimp to
search for signs of terrorist activity. Frog
men searched the moats surrounding the
palace.
Akihito became emperor immediately
upon the death of his father, Emperor Hiro
hito, in January 1989, but a period of
mourning was observed before his formal
enthronement.
