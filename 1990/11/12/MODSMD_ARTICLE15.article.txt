# Prospect of war in Gulf looms over Veteran's Day

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Amer
icans paid tribute to the dead of
wars past in solemn Veterans Day
ceremonies yesterday at the Tomb
of the Unknowns and the Vietnam
Veterans Memorial amid fears
that the nation may be swept into
a new war in the Persian Gulf.
At the Vietnam memorial, Bob
Horsch of Rah way, N.J., a veteran
of Army service in Vietnam, said
he believed it was "just a matter
of time" until the United States
was at war again.
Horsch said he believed the
military buildup in the Persian
Gulf was justified by the need to
protect American interests and
those of other countries.
Stephen Reuben of Lapwai,
Idaho, a member of the Nez Perce
tribe who also served in Vietnam,
declined to say whether the
buildup was a good idea, but said
he fears the country was headed
for war.
"I am afraid so, but I pray and
hope we don't," Reuben said.
Speakers at the ceremonies,
including Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney, paid tribute to the Ameri
can troops now serving in the Gulf
region.

At Arlington National Ceme
tery, Cheney laid a wreath at the
Tomb of the Unknowns and
addressed a capacity crowd in the
adjoining Vermont marble
amphitheater, which seats 5,500.
"Those who have been
deployed to the Persian Gulf and
Saudi Arabia are probably the
best trained solaiers we have ever
had," he said. "The nation and
the world will be better for their
service."
"People who are concerned
about peace must stay prepared
for war," Cheney said.
The ceremonies, held on tradi
tional Veterans Day in advance of
Monday's official national holiday,
took place under bright, sunny
skies, with a crisp wind whipping
through the flag-draped
amphitheater at Arlington.
At the Vietnam memorial, an
armed services color guard and a
bagpiper playing "Abide With
Me" accompanied military and
patriotic groups who placed
wreaths in front of the 58,000
names inscribed on the ebony-col
ored, granite wall. They are the
names of American servicemen
killed in Vietnam.
