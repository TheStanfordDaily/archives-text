As fighting looms,
support and reasons
for war missing

The united states is
preparing to go to war with
Iraq lacking two important
things: firm support, both abroad
and at home, and a credible reason
for fighting.
If it wasn't obvious before, the
Bush administration's intent to
make an offensive strike possible
became clear last week when Pres
ident Bush announced the deploy
ment of an additional 150,000
troops to the Persian Gulf and Sec
retary of State James Baker toured
eight countries, seeking increased
commitment to the coalition
against Iraq.
Bush's announcement was met
with a lukewarm response from
Americans; polls found that about
half of the American public favors
war if economic sanctions fail.
The support is halfhearted,
largely because Bush has failed to
answer two key questions about
the crisis: What is the purpose of
U.S. involvement, and for exactly
what would U.S. forces be fighting
in a war?
It's certainly not democratic val
ues, as neither Kuwait nor Saudi
Arabia is a democracy. It could be
oil, but it is difficult to believe that
the amount of oil the United States
gets from Kuwait is worth the
thousands of lives that would be
wasted in a war.
The answer most likely lies in
the Bush administration's effort to
maintain America's image as
"peacekeeper" of the world — and
its effort to deflect attention from
domestic problems the administra
tion faces. Neither is a compelling
justification for war.

Also uncommunicated is the
ultimate goal of a military assault
on Iraqi forces. Would it be restora
tion of the monarchy in Kuwait?
The removal of Saddam Hussein
from power? The death of Saddam?
The prospect of the United
States initiating a war with Iraq
can be summarized in one word:
scary. The potential for loss of life
is huge, the propsects for a quick
victory slim. And it would all be
done in the name of — what?
Considering the road thus far
traveled, the best approach for the
Bush adminstration is to hold the
U.S. military presence at its cur
rent level while increasing the
administration's commitment to
finding a peaceful settlement.
There is no reason to continue
military escalation in the Gulf; at
the same time, maintaining a size
able force there enables the United
States to negotiate from a position
of strength.
Instead, the United States
should ensure that the economic
embargo on Iraq is tightened in all
possible ways.
Further, the Bush administra
tion should continue to work with
its allies and through the United
Nations in determining the coali
tion's response to the crisis.
The United States should stop
setting itself up as the older
brother coming to the rescue of a
sibling. The United States has had
no interest in Kuwait outside of its
small contribution to the U.S. oil
supply; if thwarting an act of
aggression is the real agenda of the
coalition, then no one nation
should be acting alone.
In any event, the quest to main
tain the American image interna
tionally — if that, indeed, is the
real goal of the Bush administra
tion in the crisis — does not justify
risking hundreds of thousands of
lives in a war that would not soon
end.
