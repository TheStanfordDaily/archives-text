Multiculturalism will lead to increased prominence of gays and lesbians

I AM ONE OF THE TWO men shown
kissing in the Nov. 5 Daily. I'm glad
that the photo was taken and I think
The Daily made an outstanding decision
in choosing to print it, both for the visibil
ity it offers and the discussion it has gen
erated.
However, the discussions so far are
missing an important point: People at
Stanford like the idea of multicultural
ism, but they don't seem to have thought
about the fact that one of the conse
quences of multiculturalism is that
scenes like my kissing someone in front of
Memorial Church will become common
place.
One Nov. 8 letter reflected a view I've
seen many times at Stanford: Queerness

(h<smo- or bisexuality) is fine so long as it
doesn't actually exist, so long as it
remains a purely abstract, intellectual,
politically correct concept.
The author doesn't explain why it was
only this photo, and not other photos (like
the blood and gore regularly depicted on
the world news pages of our newspapers),
was deemed so sensationalistic as to war
rant a letter to the editor.
Something as personal as sexuality
cannot be dealt with in a purely intellec
tual way To try to do so is an attempt to
create a comfortable distance from one's
own biases and feelings that allows righ
teousness without any real difference
being made.
What would happen if sexuality

weren't so dichotomized? Queerness
could be a part of your friends' lives, your
siblings', your parents', your teachers'; it
could very well be a part of you.
The fact that more and more people
are coming out should not be a source of
fear, but of excitement that such diversity
can be seen and affirmed.
And I do mean seen, not as a concept,
but as me or another person kissing a
same-sex lover on the Quad, in our
dorms, wherever we'd kiss someone of the
same sex.
And then, we might discover the great
est secret of all: that it's not a big deal,
that our society will be healthier for our
openness and affirmation, that many of
the estimated one-third of teenage sui

cides related to sexual orientation will be
prevented, that millions of people will
lead full and complete lives that will
enrich everyone.
Perhaps my photo won't be any more
controversial than the thousands, of
woman-kissing-man photos on our news
papers and TV screens each day.
Queer people should not be "separate
but equal." We have always been vital
members of societies everywhere, and
that will continue as people continue to
learn to affirm the same-sex attractions
in other people and themselves.
