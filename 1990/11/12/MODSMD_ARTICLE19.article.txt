# Cartoon mocked the prospect of women working together
## 
### 
This joint group of women from the
Intersorority Council and the Women's
Center would like to address two issues
surrounding the Nov. 6 editorial cartoon
that mocked the prospect of these two
groups working together on women's
issues: the inconsistent editing by The
Daily and the skepticism indicated in the
cartoon that these two groups of women
could work together.
The presence of an editorial cartoon
stereotyping women is inconsistent with
The Daily's philosophy of "fair, accurate
and comprehensive" reporting.
According to Brad Hayward, editor in
chief of The Daily, one criterion for a let
ter to the editor to be published is that it
presents a "forceful, intelligent argu
ment rather than an unsubstantiated
opinion."
Does The Daily believe that a stereo

type is an intelligent and substantiated
opinion? Why is it that some stereotypes
are forbidden, but those that demean
women are still accepted?
Commenting on the skepticism inher
ent in the cartoon, the Women's Center
and the ISC recognize that while there
may be differences in the way in which
individuals in these groups explore ques
tions like "What does it mean to be
women?" or "How can we fight sexism?"
what we do have in common is funda
mental: We have chosen to participate in
a women's community.
Moreover, our communities are not
mutually exclusive. There are many
members of the Women's Center collec
tive who are also sorority members.
One of the goals of the Leadership
Summit was to challenge groups that
have not traditionally worked together to
recognize common concerns and combine
efforts to deal with them.
Already, groups such as the Edu
cation Project and the Sexual Assault
Task Force work with sororities on rape
awareness.
Obviously, there are other issues that
concern us as women, and we will work

together to address them in the coming
year. For example, we are collaborating
on a project centering on women's health
for the upcoming You Can Make A Dif
ference conference, sponsored by the
Haas Public Service Center.
One would think that an individual
would support our efforts rather than
belittle them.
