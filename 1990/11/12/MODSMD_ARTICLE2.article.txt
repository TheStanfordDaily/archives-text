# Women's needs surveyed

### Minal Hajratwala Staff writer 
The first stage of a Women's Needs
Assessment, an examination of the quality
of life of Stanford women, will take place
tonight as 600 randomly selected female
students share their thoughts, feelings and
experiences.
The needs assessment, initiated last
spring, was charged by the Office of Stu
dent Affairs this quarter to examine the
issue and make recommendations. As a pre
liminary step, the results of tonight's
forum will be used to create a comprehen
sive survey for wider distribution.
"We need to find out from the women
themselves ... what is really going on in
the lives of women students or subgroups of
women students," said Diana Akiyama,
chair of the needs assessment study group
and associate dean of the chapel. The group
invited a higher percentage of women of
color than white women in order to ensure
the study's inclusiveness.
"We will be relying a lot on the sample
that actually shows up" to determine what
issues are relevant to Stanford women stu
dents, Akiyama said.
At the forum, students will be divided
into small, confidential "focus groups," led
by a facilitator and a student volunteer note
taker. Information gained from these
groups will be compiled by the end of fall
quarter. The facilitators will be members of
tne needs assessment study group.

It is unclear what form the study group
will take after that, Akiypma said.
"We know there is a unique set of issues,
at both the academic and student services
level, that women students are dealing
with," said Teri Hopper, acting coordinator
of the Women's Center.
"For example, we know women are hav
ing problems in the science and engineering
schools," she said. "Also, women have cer
tain unique health care needs and issues,
such as eating disorders."
The study group, which consists of stu
dents, faculty and administrators, has a
task similar to the University Committee
on Minority Issues, whose March 1989
report created a blueprint for major
changes across the University.
"UCMI was very effective in bringing to
light issues of people of color," Hopper said.
"The same needs to be done for women."
One change suggested by UCMI was the
hiring of full-time deans for each of the four
ethnic community centers. Hopper said,
"Given that women are 40 percent of the
student body, it seems to me perfectly rea
sonable to expect that a full-time [Women's
Center] coordinator could come out of
this."
University-wide budget cuts have slowed
the progress of the Women's Needs Assess
ment for several months. "We just don't
have the money," Hopper said.
For example, finding funding for a grad
uate student research assistant for the
study has been "a big struggle," she said.
