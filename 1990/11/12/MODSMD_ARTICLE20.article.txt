# Defense of drug use correct, but will not be well received

### 
Stuart Reges' opinions of sex and
drugs reflect his (and my) generation's
attitudes and philosophies. I applaud his
message and his boldness in press.

Reges' outspoken opin
ions will likely bring him
trouble.

He is absolutely correct to assess that
governments all, from nation-size to
family-size, attempt to whittle away our
rights little by little. Rabid readers of
The Stanford Review would especially
agree with that observation.
Unfortunately, while "homophilia" is
gaining in societal acceptance, drug use
has ei\joyed its heyday. The "yes" gener
ation has aged to "maybe not," and the
new generation hears only "no." Even
Alaska's voters, a majority of whom
openly condemn government interven
tion, recently re-criminalized marijuana
use in the home.
I'm afraid that Reges' outspoken opin
ions will likely bring him trouble in the
current atmosphere of control and
repression, and that in itself will be an
especially sad commentary on our times.
