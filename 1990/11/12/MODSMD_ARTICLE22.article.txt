## Siding with underdogs 
### 
THE ELECTIONS ARE OVER and,
as usual, hardly any proposition I
supported passed and hardly any
person I voted for won. Always being on
the losing end is beginning to annoy me.
But beyond simply being annoying, it
makes me wonder why it is that I always
seem to be going against mainstream
thought, why my pendulum is always
swinging the wrong way, so to speak.
I used to console myself by saying that
it didn't really matter who I backed or
who actually won because I couldn't vote
anyway. Unfortunately, I could not take
refuge in this reasoning during the past
election because I finally turned 18.
I thought my vote would make a differ
ence this time. Somehow I thought this
election would turn out the way I wanted
it to. The newspapers were all saying how
the recent budget crisis could hurt the
Republicans at the polls.
I was even reading stuff about how
Dianne Feinstein was catching up to Wil
son in the pre-election polls. Not that I
particularly like Feinstein; she's just
somewhat less disagreeable than Wilson.
Being a registered Democrat, I took
these to be auspicious signs. Big mistake.
I broke my cardinal rule of never antici
pating good fortune.
The way I figure it, if you expect some
thing nice to happen and it doesn't you'll
have to deal with the disappointment. If,
on the other hand, you prepare yourself
for the worst-case scenario, every step
just short of disaster can be celebrated.
If I had simply stuck to this method, I
would be thanking the heavens that Clay
ton "Bad weather is like rape" Williams

didn't win in Texas instead of lamenting
the fact that Feinstein lost by a few per
centage points.
It's almost more frustrating when the
candidate you support loses by just a few
points instead of a landslide. The fact that
Wilson won by such a narrow margin is
comforting to me, however, in the sense
that it could be an indication of my not
being completely out on a limb.
Although I guess being out on a limb
shouldn't bother me anymore, seeing as
how I'm out there all the time anyway. I
just never seem to be on the same wave
length with the mtyority of the voting
population.
I don't really mind that. It just makes
it difficult at the dinner table sometimes
when political issues come up. Then I find
myself trying to defend my position
against a table of opposing opinions with
out indigestion.
The fact that elections never come out
the way I would like them to makes me
doubt my own judgment. I always wonder
what it would be like if eveiy proposition
and person I voted for won. I'm never
sure if things would be better or worse
off.
I just don't see how that many people
could all be wrong. Maybe the majority
does know best. After all, the country
hasn't actually reached collapse yet.
At times it seems like I just have a pen
chant for picking losers, and not just in
terms of elections. The athletic teams I
happen to root for lose two-thirds of the
time.
I suspect, though, that this has some
thing to do with the fact that I almost

always support the underdog, or whoever
is losing the game at the moment I begin
to take an interest.
I guess I set myself up for a lot of let
downs this way, but it does tend to make
sporting events more interesting. There's
nothing to keep you on the edge of your
seat if the team or person you want to win
is already doing well.
Pulling for the underdog is actually
quite a good way to spice up an otherwise
dull game.
Elections and sporting events are not
quite the same things, however, although
the mudslinging involved in this past
election probably required a fair amount
of athletic ability.
One of the comforting thoughts I can
find in all of this centers around the fact
that there were plenty of other people
who also didn't get exactly what they
voted for in the election.
It wasn't as though I was the only one
voting for a losing proposition or candi
date.
Besides, it's better to vote for a losing
proposition that you believe in than to
alter your ideas for the sake of behaving
like everyone else.

Although I guess being out on a limb
shouldn't bother me anymore, seeing as
how I'm out there all the time anyway. I
just never seem to be on the same wave
length with the mtyority of the voting
population.
I don't really mind that. It just makes
it difficult at the dinner table sometimes
when political issues come up. Then I find
myself trying to defend my position
against a table of opposing opinions with
out indigestion.
The fact that elections never come out
the way I would like them to makes me
doubt my own judgment. I always wonder
what it would be like if eveiy proposition
and person I voted for won. I'm never
sure if things would be better or worse
off.
I just don't see how that many people
could all be wrong. Maybe the majority
does know best. After all, the country
hasn't actually reached collapse yet.
At times it seems like I just have a pen
chant for picking losers, and not just in
terms of elections. The athletic teams I
happen to root for lose two-thirds of the
time.
I suspect, though, that this has some
thing to do with the fact that I almost

always support the underdog, or whoever
is losing the game at the moment I begin
to take an interest.
I guess I set myself up for a lot of let
downs this way, but it does tend to make
sporting events more interesting. There's
nothing to keep you on the edge of your
seat if the team or person you want to win
is already doing well.
Pulling for the underdog is actually
quite a good way to spice up an otherwise
dull game.
Elections and sporting events are not
quite the same things, however, although
the mudslinging involved in this past
election probably required a fair amount
of athletic ability.
One of the comforting thoughts I can
find in all of this centers around the fact
that there were plenty of other people
who also didn't get exactly what they
voted for in the election.
It wasn't as though I was the only one
voting for a losing proposition or candi
date.
Besides, it's better to vote for a losing
proposition that you believe in than to
alter your ideas for the sake of behaving
like everyone else.
