## Wilfred Stone Stanford shouldn't support separate, unequal housing for students 
### 
IT SEEMS TO ME that Stanford, as
part of its Centennial Celebration,
could profitably review certain aspects
of its undergraduate infrastructure — in
particular the fraternity, sorority and
theme-house system.
The trouble with the fraternity/soror
ity system stems from one thing: that
some undergraduates are allowed to band
together to exclude other undergraduates
from their living spaces and company.
For a small group of undergraduates to
be especially privileged to exclude others
from their living group, solely for social
reasons, seems to me simply immoral.
I say nothing against the virtues of
brotherhood or sisterhood (insofar as
these ideals are realized on the Row), and
I recognize the virtues, educational and
social, of small-group living, but if these
are virtues, they should be made available
to all and not just to some.
The Rush system is a flat-out denial of
any such democratic opportunity. I do not
object to the fraternities and sororities
primarily because of the "culture" they
encourage, even though that culture is
grounds enough for objection — as any
reader of Daily headlines over the past
decade needs no reminding.
That culture — rooted in elitism and
devoted to alcohol and sex — has been a
repeated threat to the Fundamental
Standard and a headache to those admin
istrators charged with undergraduate dis
cipline.
But my main point of criticism is the
Rush system itself. The history of frater
nities (sororities too, but I'll use the one
word for convenience) is one of exclusion,
snobbery and prejudice.
Although fraternities have gradually,
over the years, lowered the barrier to
black students, Jews, Catholics and other
minorities, rejection is still the name of
the game, though the rejectees today

would doubtless be more obliquely identi
fied as wimps, nerds, fat guys with acne
or maybe just jerks (probably meaning
poor kids from the wrong side of the
tracks).
Obviously, life is full of exclusion ; some
people get in and others don't. But that is
no reason why a university should allow
any group of undergraduates to decide, on
subjective grounds and for purely social
reasons, that other undergraduates are
not fit for their company.
Of course, the University itself prac
tices exclusion in its admissions policy,
but that policy tries to be objective and
fair. It has standards that are publicly
known and advertised, it tries to be free of
racial and religious and class prejudice,
and, like any hypothesis, it is subject to
change if proven faulty.
The undergraduates who have met
that test and been admitted should
henceforth, so long as they are Stanford
undergraduates, enjoy the full privileges
of membership — and the University, as a
matter of moral principle, should not per
mit any self-appointed inner group of
undergraduates to violate that principle.
People will club together anyway? So
be it. Let them club together off campus.
The Uniyersity should have no part of
underwriting a system of special privilege
for any student clique.
To a lesser extent, this same argument
applies to the so-called "theme houses." I
say "so-called" because real theme
houses, in my opinion, would be houses
with an intellectual and not just a social
purpose — where, for example, a foreign
language or other academic subject would
be emphasized and cultivated.
Though Zapata and Ujamaa and the
others do not practice "rush," though any
undergraduate can theoretically draw
into these houses, in practice they are
exclusionary, through mere pressure of

numbers.
I know the argument: A white student
could be as comfortable in nearly all-black
Ujamaa, as a black student could be on a
nearly all-white floor in (say) Stern. This
argument has merit, and I was not a civil
rights worker in Mississippi in 1964 with
out learning what it felt like to be a black
in a dominant white society.
I recognize the comfort of living with
one's own "culture" and the deep craving
of alienated minorities for a sympathetic
support group. I am sympathetic with
black people (for instance) who are fed up
with the academic argument that white
people need their company in order to be
educated in racial tolerance. Let them
educate themselves! Or join our theme
house!
Plausible and persuasive as these
arguments are, I reject them, and I reject
them for the same reason that I've
rejected the "country club" ideal — of
exclusion and elitism and (usually) male
chauvinism — all my life. The country
club, like the fraternity system, seems the
very antithesis of what I think this coun
try, with its uniquely great Constitution,
ought to stand for.
And I think that this university, inso
far as it abets these tendencies, should
rethink its position regarding fraternities
and theme houses, for the tendencies of
separatism that they encourage are
emblematic of a national — and interna
tional — crisis.
It is Stanford's proud boast that it
encourages "diversity" and "multicultur
alism" in its student body, but what ever
happened to the idea of the"the melting
pot?"
Granted, it is an unhappy metaphor,
suggesting as it does a melting down of
individual and racial differences into one
homogenized mass. But the idea behind
that metaphor is not an unhappy one, for

unless all the races and religions of this
country can somehow be induced to feel
that they are parts of one nation, and
sharers in a general culture (exclusive of
whatever private culture they may enjoy),
then I have small hope that the ideals
embodied in our Constitution can thrive,
or even survive.
On this campus, over the past two
years (as on many other campuses), we
have felt racial antagonisms heating up.
Issues have been presented in terms of us
against them, instead of us together, a
would-be community under the Funda
mental Standard and the Honor Code.
One of the reasons for these antago
nisms stems, I believe, from the fact that
the University has supported a system of
separate but equal facilities, a notion
thoroughly discredited as a mode of
school organization in the recent South,
and recognized by the Supreme Court as
unconstitutional. The Court recognized
that those words actually meant separate
but unequal — that such a system was
unequal by definition.
The parallel to Stanford is not exact,
but it is exact enough to bear serious
thinking about. In the name of "diver
sity" and "multiculturalism," Stanford
has blessed a system of separate but equal
in its undergraduate arrangements, and
this system has, through allowing, even
encouraging, the races and cultures to
isolate themselves, fed the racial antago
nisms we have recently suffered on this
campus.
We should have no fear that any melt
ing pot will actually melt people down, for
there is too much human resistance to
such immolation, but at least it is an ideal
that can keep our eyes focused on the fact
that the people of diverse, multicultural
America are in the same boat, that we
sink or swim together, that we are one
nation and not a lot of separate enclaves,

that our survival depends on our learning
to live and work together.
But "diversity" and "multicultural
ism" are not ideals, they are simply words
naming what we are stuck with anyway. I
suppose that, by honoring sUch words,
Stanford resolves not to make this uni
versity a harbor for WASPs, and that is,
so far as it goes, a good; but it is a good
only by necessity, for Stanford could not
exist unless it admitted something of
America's variety to its membership.
But to admit that variety, and then to
let it fragment itself into cultural and
racial enclaves — and to officially sup
port such a system — is to forget that
unless we hang together, we will hang
separately.
We live in a world getting ever smaller.
Christians must learn to live with
Moslems, black people with white people,
late-coming Americans with Native
Americans, Anglos with Latinos, East
with West, the First World with the Third
World; but we will never learn how to do
this unless we practice living together,
talking to each other.
The place where such association abso
lutely must be practiced is the university,
especially in a university of such
world+wide influence as Stanford. An
undergraduate now can go through four
years and never talk to anyone of a differ
ent race or culture except in the class
room, if there. It is a shameful situation,
and Stanford should show its Centennial
greatness by correcting it with all deliber
ate speed.
Let us reinvoke that disparaged phrase
"melting pot" and infuse it with fresh
meaning by revising the structures that
in today's Stanford make its existence
problematical, if not impossible.

unconstitutional. The Court recognized
that those words actually meant separate

unequal by definition.
The parallel to Stanford is not exact,
but it is exact enough to bear serious
thinking about. In the name of "diver
sity" and "multiculturalism," Stanford
has blessed a system of separate but equal
in its undergraduate arrangements, and
this system has, through allowing, even
encouraging, the races and cultures to
isolate themselves, fed the racial antago
nisms we have recently suffered on this
campus.
We should have no fear that any melt
ing pot will actually melt people down, for
there is too much human resistance to
such immolation, but at least it is an ideal
that can keep our eyes focused on the fact
that the people of diverse, multicultural
America are in the same boat, that we
sink or swim together, that we are one
nation and not a lot of separate enclaves,

that our survival depends on our learning
to live and work together.
But "diversity" and "multicultural
ism" are not ideals, they are simply words
naming what we are stuck with anyway. I
suppose that, by honoring sUch words,
Stanford resolves not to make this uni
versity a harbor for WASPs, and that is,
so far as it goes, a good; but it is a good
only by necessity, for Stanford could not
exist unless it admitted something of
America's variety to its membership.
But to admit that variety, and then to
let it fragment itself into cultural and
racial enclaves — and to officially sup
port such a system — is to forget that
unless we hang together, we will hang
separately.
We live in a world getting ever smaller.
Christians must learn to live with
Moslems, black people with white people,
late-coming Americans with Native
Americans, Anglos with Latinos, East
with West, the First World with the Third
World; but we will never learn how to do
this unless we practice living together,
talking to each other.
The place where such association abso
lutely must be practiced is the university,
especially in a university of such
world+wide influence as Stanford. An
undergraduate now can go through four
years and never talk to anyone of a differ
ent race or culture except in the class
room, if there. It is a shameful situation,
and Stanford should show its Centennial
greatness by correcting it with all deliber
ate speed.
Let us reinvoke that disparaged phrase
"melting pot" and infuse it with fresh
meaning by revising the structures that
in today's Stanford make its existence
problematical, if not impossible.

Wilfred Stone is an emeritus professor of
English.
IT SEEMS TO ME that Stanford, as
part of its Centennial Celebration,
could profitably review certain aspects
of its undergraduate infrastructure — in
particular the fraternity, sorority and
theme-house system.
The trouble with the fraternity/soror
ity system stems from one thing: that
some undergraduates are allowed to band
together to exclude other undergraduates
from their living spaces and company.
For a small group of undergraduates to
be especially privileged to exclude others
from their living group, solely for social
reasons, seems to me simply immoral.
I say nothing against the virtues of
brotherhood or sisterhood (insofar as
these ideals are realized on the Row), and
I recognize the virtues, educational and
social, of small-group living, but if these
are virtues, they should be made available
to all and not just to some.
The Rush system is a flat-out denial of
any such democratic opportunity. I do not
object to the fraternities and sororities
primarily because of the "culture" they
encourage, even though that culture is
grounds enough for objection — as any
reader of Daily headlines over the past
decade needs no reminding.
That culture — rooted in elitism and
devoted to alcohol and sex — has been a
repeated threat to the Fundamental
Standard and a headache to those admin
istrators charged with undergraduate dis
cipline.
But my main point of criticism is the
Rush system itself. The history of frater
nities (sororities too, but I'll use the one
word for convenience) is one of exclusion,
snobbery and prejudice.
Although fraternities have gradually,
over the years, lowered the barrier to
black students, Jews, Catholics and other
minorities, rejection is still the name of
the game, though the rejectees today

would doubtless be more obliquely identi
fied as wimps, nerds, fat guys with acne
or maybe just jerks (probably meaning
poor kids from the wrong side of the
tracks).
Obviously, life is full of exclusion ; some
people get in and others don't. But that is
no reason why a university should allow
any group of undergraduates to decide, on
subjective grounds and for purely social
reasons, that other undergraduates are
not fit for their company.
Of course, the University itself prac
tices exclusion in its admissions policy,
but that policy tries to be objective and
fair. It has standards that are publicly
known and advertised, it tries to be free of
racial and religious and class prejudice,
and, like any hypothesis, it is subject to
change if proven faulty.
The undergraduates who have met
that test and been admitted should
henceforth, so long as they are Stanford
undergraduates, enjoy the full privileges
of membership — and the University, as a
matter of moral principle, should not per
mit any self-appointed inner group of
undergraduates to violate that principle.
People will club together anyway? So
be it. Let them club together off campus.
The Uniyersity should have no part of
underwriting a system of special privilege
for any student clique.
To a lesser extent, this same argument
applies to the so-called "theme houses." I
say "so-called" because real theme
houses, in my opinion, would be houses
with an intellectual and not just a social
purpose — where, for example, a foreign
language or other academic subject would
be emphasized and cultivated.
Though Zapata and Ujamaa and the
others do not practice "rush," though any
undergraduate can theoretically draw
into these houses, in practice they are
exclusionary, through mere pressure of

numbers.
I know the argument: A white student
could be as comfortable in nearly all-black
Ujamaa, as a black student could be on a
nearly all-white floor in (say) Stern. This
argument has merit, and I was not a civil
rights worker in Mississippi in 1964 with
out learning what it felt like to be a black
in a dominant white society.
I recognize the comfort of living with
one's own "culture" and the deep craving
of alienated minorities for a sympathetic
support group. I am sympathetic with
black people (for instance) who are fed up
with the academic argument that white
people need their company in order to be
educated in racial tolerance. Let them
educate themselves! Or join our theme
house!
Plausible and persuasive as these
arguments are, I reject them, and I reject
them for the same reason that I've
rejected the "country club" ideal — of
exclusion and elitism and (usually) male
chauvinism — all my life. The country
club, like the fraternity system, seems the
very antithesis of what I think this coun
try, with its uniquely great Constitution,
ought to stand for.
And I think that this university, inso
far as it abets these tendencies, should
rethink its position regarding fraternities
and theme houses, for the tendencies of
separatism that they encourage are
emblematic of a national — and interna
tional — crisis.
It is Stanford's proud boast that it
encourages "diversity" and "multicultur
alism" in its student body, but what ever
happened to the idea of the"the melting
pot?"
Granted, it is an unhappy metaphor,
suggesting as it does a melting down of
individual and racial differences into one
homogenized mass. But the idea behind
that metaphor is not an unhappy one, for

unless all the races and religions of this
country can somehow be induced to feel
that they are parts of one nation, and
sharers in a general culture (exclusive of
whatever private culture they may enjoy),
then I have small hope that the ideals
embodied in our Constitution can thrive,
or even survive.
On this campus, over the past two
years (as on many other campuses), we
have felt racial antagonisms heating up.
Issues have been presented in terms of us
against them, instead of us together, a
would-be community under the Funda
mental Standard and the Honor Code.
One of the reasons for these antago
nisms stems, I believe, from the fact that
the University has supported a system of
separate but equal facilities, a notion
thoroughly discredited as a mode of
school organization in the recent South,
and recognized by the Supreme Court as
unconstitutional. The Court recognized
that those words actually meant separate
but unequal — that such a system was
unequal by definition.
The parallel to Stanford is not exact,
but it is exact enough to bear serious

I know the argument: A white student
could be as comfortable in nearly all-black
Ujamaa, as a black student could be on a
nearly all-white floor in (say) Stern. This
argument has merit, and I was not a civil
rights worker in Mississippi in 1964 with
out learning what it felt like to be a black
in a dominant white society.
I recognize the comfort of living with
one's own "culture" and the deep craving
of alienated minorities for a sympathetic
support group. I am sympathetic with
black people (for instance) who are fed up
with the academic argument that white
people need their company in order to be
educated in racial tolerance. Let them
educate themselves! Or join our theme
house!
Plausible and persuasive as these
arguments are, I reject them, and I reject
them for the same reason that I've
rejected the "country club" ideal — of
exclusion and elitism and (usually) male
chauvinism — all my life. The country
club, like the fraternity system, seems the
very antithesis of what I think this coun
try, with its uniquely great Constitution,
ought to stand for.
And I think that this university, inso
far as it abets these tendencies, should
rethink its position regarding fraternities
and theme houses, for the tendencies of
separatism that they encourage are
emblematic of a national — and interna
tional — crisis.
It is Stanford's proud boast that it
encourages "diversity" and "multicultur
alism" in its student body, but what ever
happened to the idea of the"the melting
pot?"
Granted, it is an unhappy metaphor,
suggesting as it does a melting down of
individual and racial differences into one
homogenized mass. But the idea behind
that metaphor is not an unhappy one, for

unless all the races and religions of this
country can somehow be induced to feel
that they are parts of one nation, and
sharers in a general culture (exclusive of
whatever private culture they may enjoy),
then I have small hope that the ideals
embodied in our Constitution can thrive,
or even survive.
On this campus, over the past two
years (as on many other campuses), we
have felt racial antagonisms heating up.
Issues have been presented in terms of us
against them, instead of us together, a
would-be community under the Funda
mental Standard and the Honor Code.
One of the reasons for these antago
nisms stems, I believe, from the fact that
the University has supported a system of
separate but equal facilities, a notion
thoroughly discredited as a mode of
school organization in the recent South,
and recognized by the Supreme Court as
unconstitutional. The Court recognized
that those words actually meant separate
but unequal — that such a system was
unequal by definition.
The parallel to Stanford is not exact,
but it is exact enough to bear serious
thinking about. In the name of "diver
sity" and "multiculturalism," Stanford
has blessed a system of separate but equal
in its undergraduate arrangements, and
this system has, through allowing, even
encouraging, the races and cultures to
isolate themselves, fed the racial antago
nisms we have recently suffered on this
campus.
We should have no fear that any melt
ing pot will actually melt people down, for
there is too much human resistance to
such immolation, but at least it is an ideal
that can keep our eyes focused on the fact
that the people of diverse, multicultural
America are in the same boat, that we
sink or swim together, that we are one
nation and not a lot of separate enclaves,

that our survival depends on our learning
to live and work together.
But "diversity" and "multicultural
ism" are not ideals, they are simply words
naming what we are stuck with anyway. I
suppose that, by honoring sUch words,
Stanford resolves not to make this uni
versity a harbor for WASPs, and that is,
so far as it goes, a good; but it is a good
only by necessity, for Stanford could not
exist unless it admitted something of
America's variety to its membership.
But to admit that variety, and then to
let it fragment itself into cultural and
racial enclaves — and to officially sup
port such a system — is to forget that
unless we hang together, we will hang
separately.
We live in a world getting ever smaller.
Christians must learn to live with
Moslems, black people with white people,
late-coming Americans with Native
Americans, Anglos with Latinos, East
with West, the First World with the Third
World; but we will never learn how to do
this unless we practice living together,
talking to each other.
The place where such association abso
lutely must be practiced is the university,
especially in a university of such
world+wide influence as Stanford. An
undergraduate now can go through four
years and never talk to anyone of a differ
ent race or culture except in the class
room, if there. It is a shameful situation,
and Stanford should show its Centennial
greatness by correcting it with all deliber
ate speed.
Let us reinvoke that disparaged phrase
"melting pot" and infuse it with fresh
meaning by revising the structures that
in today's Stanford make its existence
problematical, if not impossible.
