## Stanford rains on Arizona's homecoming parade 
### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
TUCSON, Ariz. — Too bad Cal
ifornia doesn't use the option. If it
did, Stanford would be assured of
running up a 5-6 season.
The option is supposed to be
the toughest formation to stop,
but not for the schizophrenic Car
dinal.

Cardinal 23
Wildcats 10

An opening game near-upset of
Colorado showed Stanford could
tango with the best of them.
Saturday evening at Arizona
Stadium the Cardinal controlled
the ballroom floor.
In winning its second consecu
tive contest, and second road
game in a season for the first time
since 1987, the Cardinal moved to
4-6 for the year, 3-4 in Pac-10 play.
It was Stanford No. 1 that bat
tled a bowl-headed Arizona. You
know, the one that beat Notre
Dame and came oh-so-close to
defeating the Buffaloes and
UCLA. Not the mid-season inten
sity-less Cardinal No. 2.
It didn't matter what was put
across the line of scrimmage. Give
it the second-ranked running
offense in the league. Give it a
hostile crowd. Give it the option to
defend. This ballclub knew it
could handle whatever came its
way.
And it did.
"We took away their heart.
They didn't expect us to come out
and play hard football for 60 min
utes," said linebacker Ron
George. "They were used to the
old Cardinal, the one that would
get ahead and then fall off and
teams would come back and win.
We didn't do that today."
The offense set the tone by
driving for a score on its first pos
session, but it was the defense
that took control of the game. Ron
Veal and his usually-smoothly
flowing option didn't scare them.
So what if Arizona was averag
ing over 200 yards a game on the
ground. The linebacking corps
would just stop the multi-back
attack. And the line would control
the nimble Veal and his counter
part behind center, George Malau
ulu.
The Wildcat scoring machine
never had a chance. The Stanford
"D" showed who was the lion and
who was the pussycat on Ari
zona's first possession. It was only
a matter of giving the felines a lit
tle streching room.
The Wildcat's first of only two
scores came on their initial pos
session of the day. And Stanford
had actually held them to a three
down drive, but was called for
unsportsmanlike conduct, giving
the Mildcats a first down and an
extra 15 yards. Arizona took
advantage of the gift, driving to

the Stanford 24, but couldn't get
by the ferocious Stanford defense
and had to settle for a field goal.
Arizona also managed a single
touchdown when Veal completed
one of his four passes to receiver
Terry Vaughn, and a missed tackle
and good block allowed Vaughn to
scramble 22 yards to the endzone.
But other than the two drives,
the usually potent Wildcat offense
was looking at Stanford defenders
most of the evening.
"After the first series it became
apparent that we could handle
them," said linebacker Dave Gar
nett. "We just came in and shut
them down the second series. We
set the tempo after that."
The Arizona squad that beat
Illinois and USC on the road did it
by running the ball down their
opponents' throats. Handoffs,
pitches, sweeps and quarterback
keepers had kept opposing
defenses scambling. And off bal
ance.
The Cardinal was prepared.
By preparing the same type of
defense as they used against Col
orado, but with a few variations
picked up through experience,
Stanford denied the Wildcats their
running lanes. And throwing the
beill just wasn't an option.
Stanford held Arizona to 105
yards on the ground, and 198
yards of total offense. Everywhere
Veal, Malauulu or the Wildcat
backs tried to go, there was a Car
dinal, or two or three, in his way.
"We absolutely wanted to stop
the option," said coach Denny
Green. "Arizona is a very good
team and they have a lot of
weapons and run the ball well. We
feel we're pretty good against the
run and even though we had some
moments that weren't what we
wanted, we did go out and play
pretty good run defense.
"We started to get some pres
sure up front, and then we did a
good job of breaking on the ball.
Ron George really applied pres
sure and the guys up front played
pretty well."
George was definitely the name
of the second half. After a half of
aggressive, but unspectacular,
football, he personally made the
second half miserable for Malau
ulu. In addition to seven unas
sisted tackles, the linebacker
sacked Arizona's signal caller four
times. When his actions were com
bined with good performances by
Garnett and Jono Tunney, the
Wildcats had no where to go.
It was the defense the Cardinal
has been looking for all season.
The young platoon finally
matured. The roaches became
ants.
"We've really found our niche,
our mode to playing not just the
option but any offense," George
said. "It's a combination of play
ing smart football — assignment
football — and playing agressive
football.
"On the sideline we were say
ing 'We're going to stop them,
we're going to sack them, we're

going to prevent the long bomb to
make sure they don't come back.'
Not 'We hope they don't come
back.' We came out with a 'we're
going to win' attitude."
So did the offense. As quarter
back Jason Palumbis and Co.
showed the very first time they
touched the ball — and marched
76 yards for a touchdown — they
had the upper hand agasint the
Wildcat defense. Whenever the
Cardinal felt like moving the ball,
it did. Although there were still
mistakes — two fumbles may
have cost 14 points — Stanford
also found rh}rthm on its side of
the ball.
Palumbis had a great night —
15-of-19 for 181 yards, and 11
consecutive completions. But the
key to the Cardinal attack that
rolled up 425 yards was the
ground game. Yes, the same tal
ented running attack that has fea
tured Glyn Milburn, Tommy
Vardell, Jon Volpe, Ellery Roberts
and Charlie Young all season, but
hadn't found its sync. Either the
offensive line wasn't making
holes, or the opposing defensive

line was too good or the backs had
an off night 0r....
Saturday night it was every
thing Green boasted of, and more.
There were holes. There was tal
ent. There were yards.
Milburn was simply stellar,
dancing for 145 yards on only 20
carries. A 38-yarder where he
twisted and turned and ran
through Arizona defenders set up
Stanford's first TD, and was a sea
son-long for a Cardinal back. His
145 yards are also a season-best
mark. Additionally he returned a
punt for a touchdown for the third
time this season, only to have it
brought back on a clipping call.
"Touchdown Tommy" Vardell
was awe-inspiring as well, steam
rolling for 80 yards and leaping
for two touchdowns. The second
hurdle for a score, his 13th of the
season, gave the junior the Stan
ford single-season rushing TD
record, breaking Brad Muster's
record of 12.
The second part of Stanford's
attack finally came into focus.
"The offensive line did a pretty

good job and we were able to get
some cutback lanes inside," Green
said. "Our backs ran hard, and
Tommy Vardell was absolutely
magnificent. His 14-yard run
when we were second-and-17 was
probably one of the most spectac
ular runs all year because of the
attack orientation of it.
"We did most of our damage in
the first half by running the foot
ball. We were able to do a pretty
good job on the ground."
Which isn't to underemphasize
the passing game, which was stel
lar when needed. When All-Amer
ica receiving candidate Ed McCaf
frey couldn't return in the second
half because of a calf strain, Jon
Pinckney and Chris Walsh picked
up the slack. Walsh had four
receptions for 82 yards, and
Pinckney brought down another
four balls, including a beautiful
13-yarder on third down.
But the air attack just wasn't
needed very often.
"We didn't really get into
defensive situations where we
needed to throw the ball, and even

late in the game when we were up
by 10 we still ran the ball," Pinck
ney explained. "I think we sur
prised them. I think they expected
to see the ball in the air more."
Stanford defintely surprised
the critics, who labeled the Notre
Dame victory an aberration and
the Cardinal a folding team. Not
only did Stanford soundly defeat
the favored Wildcats, they led the
entire game. And were never in
danger of losing the lead.
Stanford finally appears to be
learing how to win.
"It's taken ump-God years and
a whole season up to now, but now
we know how to win" George said.
"It's going to carry over not just to
Cal but to next season. That's
where you're really going to see
the Cardinal ball start rolling. We
know how to win. Now we have an
experienced defense and an expe
rienced offense and a team that
knows how to play together and
play to win."
Has the Cardinal's true person
ality finally surfaced?


Ken Beer — Daily
Before taking the field for the opening kickoff Saturday night in Arizona, the Cardinal football team found a little extra motivation. It
worked as Stanford dominated the Wildcats physically on its way to a 23-10 win, the team's first in Tucson since 1979.
