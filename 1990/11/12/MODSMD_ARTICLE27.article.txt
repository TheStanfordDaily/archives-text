# Red-hot Cardinal smokes Oklahoma, No. 6 Texas
## Oden leads third-ranked spikers to eighth straight win 
### Harold Yu Staff writer 
Lately, there have been worries that
California's monopoly on competitive
volleyball has been broken.
This weekend, the Cardinal women's
volleyball team proved those concerns
were a tad premature.
Third-ranked Stanford (22-3) sent a
couple of outside teams reeling Friday
and Saturday, trashing Oklahoma 15-1,
15-7, 15-8 and thrashing No. 6 Texas
15-8, 7-15, 15-3, 15-8. The Cardinal won
its eighth consecutive match and 16th of
its last 17.
"Right now, we feel that we're as
good as any team in the country," Stan
ford coach Don Shaw said of his streak
ing squad.
Oklahoma has no qualms about the
matter. Friday night Stanford outhit the
Sooners .372 to .095 while holding its
midwestern adversary to 16 points
throughout the entire match. The Car
dinal had runs of 13-0, 12-0 and 7-0 and
had four players hit over .450 for the
affair.
"Stanford is a very good team,"
Sooner coach Miles Pabst said after the
match. "We're too young to play with
them at this point in time."
That was apparent early. All-Ameri
can Kristin Klein slammed eight kills to
spark Stanford on a first game slugfest.
She finished with 12 kills, five digs and
a .556 hitting percentage on the night.
Freshman Piper Hahn was in setter
heaven as every option she tried worked
in her first career start. Junior outside
hitter Jennifer Jackson and sophomore
Bev Oden contributed three kills apiece
in game one. The Sooners had trouble
following the ball as all five starting
Stanford attackers tallied kills early.
"It wasn't the toughest competition,"
Jackson said. "We came out strong and

we weren't lulled to sleep."
But the ugly only got uglier. The Car
dinal struck for 12 straight points in the
first 10 minutes of game two. Reserve
middle blocker Nicole Appleman initi
ated the melee, collecting two early kills.
Hahn served an ace at 6-0 and then set
Stanford to its 12-0 advantage. The
Sooners meanwhile were keeping track
of their total match points with one
hand.

"I thought we did a good job tonight,"
Shaw said after the contest. "We got real
quiet at times but Kristin got everyone
going."
To salvage what dignity it could, the
Sooners made a mini-run, recording
seven unanswered scores. Stanford suf
fered from a number of mistakes in the
run, including a rotation error at 12-4.
"We lost the groove," freshman hitter
Danielle Everett said. "We have to work
on coming out of rutts and not getting in
slumps."
Everett did her part, pounding kills
at 13-7 and 14-7. Junior middle blocker
Amy Cooper then terminated the game
with a quick attack.
The Cardinal actually trailed in game
three before senior co-captain Jessica
Benton solo blocked a ball with one
hand. She and sophomore Kristi Paaso
dug Stanford out of a little 2-5 pothole
with five kills between them.
Hahn streaked across the floor to
save a hard-hit ball at 5-7 and then
directed Stanford back into the contest.
The Cardinal took off on an 11-1 match
ending run.

"Stanford's a very good team," Pabst
said. "I know they're one of the teams
that can win the whole thing this year.
They've got Bev Oden. She's the best
all-around middle blocker in the coun
try."
Oden made those comments look like
an understatement the next night
against Texas. The celebrated sopho
more offered another career perfor
mance, posting 27 kills, nine digs, seven
blocks and a .657 hitting percentage to
lead the Cardinal. Oden made only two
errors in 38 attacks and had more kills
than both Longhorn middle blockers
combined.
"Texas tried to take Bev out of her
game with her passing," Shaw said.
"But then she still hits like that. This
just shows you what kind of a player she
is."
Oden went to work right away. She
had eight kills in eight attacks in the
first game as the Cardinal streaked to
an 8-1 advantage. Starting setter Carrie
Feldman, who had been given the
evening off against Oklahoma, returned
in fine form. She aced the Longhorns for
the first point of the match and assisted
Benton on a block at 6-1.
Texas had problems controlling the
ball. The highly-touted Longhorns
made seven reception errors and numer
ous errant passes, enabling the Cardinal
to score easily
"We have the three best passers in
the country," Texas coach Mick Haley
said. "But we passed terribly tonight.
We couldn't run our offensive system."
Nonetheless, the Lady Longhorns
proved worthy of their ranking. They
closed to within 7-9 on the strength of
Janine Gremmel's hitting. The Texas
attacker struck 19 total kills and hit
.245.

With a No. 3 national ranking and Interactional bragging righta on the line, Stanford
played one of Its best matchea of the year to top No. 6 Texas In Maples Pavilion
Saturday. Amy Cooper outgunned Katy Jameyson and the rest of the Lady Longhorn
defense for 11 Kills and a .333 hitting percentage.
Oden abruptly stunted any
further Longhorn ambitions with
two kills and a block. She made an
impressive backrow strike
through two blockers to make the
score 12-7. Klein belted two more
kills to effectively terminate the
game.
"Tonight was really streaky,"
Shaw said. "We had our moments
when we played very, very well."
And then they had those
moments when they didn't. The
Cardinal struggled in game two,
suffering from inept ball control
and communication problems.
Benton maintained her weeks
long offensive surge with six early
game-two kills. She had 15 total
kills and a .500 hitting percentage
on the night.
Even so, Stanford could only
match points and sideouts with
Texas. The score deadlocked at 5-
5 before the Longhorns surged on
an 8-0 run. The Cardinal commit
ted two reception errors in the
streak. Despite a straight-down
block by Benton and Oden, the
Cardinal could not recover.
"The second game was mostly
us breaking down in communica
tion," Feldman said. "We were
dragging. I should have hustled
more. But in the third game, it all
came together."
Texas got a little of the treat
ment that Nebraska — another
midwest team ranked ahead of
Stanford — received. Like the
Corhuskers, they got bruised.
The Cardinal repossessed the
net in game three, hitting .525 as

a team. Redshirt freshman Kathy
Jurgens served Stanford ahead 4-
1 with an ace. Oden had three
consecutive kills. Cooper struck
twice in a row. Benton and Feld
man roofed another Longhorn
attack. By the time Haley called
timeout, Stanford led 8-1.
The Cardinal did everything
but relent. Klein recorded a solo
block. Oden slammed two more
kills. Benton put another ball
down. Time out.
The Longhorns ran out of
timeouts and ran out of steam.
"We have no excuses tonight,"
Haley said. "I didn't think we
competed very well. I'm disap
pointed."
Texas matter-of-factly came
apart. After losing game three,
the Longhorns committed three
consecutive errors in the final set.
Klein had four kills and a block
while propping the Cardinal to a
10-6 advantage. Two blocks by
Oden sealed the match.
"I expected Texas to play bet
ter," Cooper said of the 27-2
Longhorns. "But we're real confi
dent right now. We're motivated
to go to the final four."
The Cardinal must be consid
ered a heavy favorite as the regu
lar season comes to a close. Stan
ford has now defeated all but one
of the squads ranked ahead of
them in any national poll. The
Lady Longhorns were fixed above
the Cardinal in the Volleyball
Monthly poll last week.
"This was a great win," Feld
man said. "We proved them [at
Volleyball Monthly] wrong. We
know we can beat all the teams
ranked ahead of us. We just have
to keep taking little steps toward
the national title every day."
