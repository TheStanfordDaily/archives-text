The defending national champion
Cardinal women's basketball team
kicked off the new season Saturday
minus center Trisha Stevens, and con
tinued the subtraction process when fel
low post player Val Whiting crumpled to
the floor four minutes into the second
half of the exhibition.

Cardinal 119
Bayer 69

Fortunately for Stanford, Whiting's
ir\jury did not turn out to be serious,
and all the other news for the day was
positive as the Cardinal had an easy
time with TSV Bayer Leverkusen. Stan
ford tied its highest offensive output
ever in a 119-69 pasting of the German
club team.
Stevens, last year's leading scorer for
Stanford, is still recovering from knee
surgery and did not suit up for the
game. Forward Chris MacMurdo
replaced her in the starting lineup. Car
dinal coaches were wary of playing their
star center in a preseason game that was
expected to be somewhat physical.
"We didn't want to risk anything in
this game," coach Tara VanDerveer said.
"This team (Leverkusen) moves differ
ently, a little unorthodox, and we'd
rather have Trisha come along in prac
tice."
With Stevens out, the brunt of the
inside work fell to 6-foot-3 Whiting. The
sophomore responded with 20 points
and nine rebounds in 23 minutes, domi
nating the low post over the smaller
German team. But what VanDerveer
feared would happen to Stevens with
the Europeans' aggressive style of play
instead befell Whiting: a tangle-up on a
rebound and a knee injury.
"I was scared, because you always
hear things about knee injuries," Whit
ing said. "It wasn't that she hit me, but
I just came down wrong."
The initial diagnosis was a hyperex
tended right knee. Whiting planned to
have a magnetic resonance imaging scan
on the knee yesterday, trainer Megan
Brick said, and the results will deter
mine when she will return to practice.
An undaunted Whiting was not con
cerned, and vowed "I'll make sure I'm

'Before she went on her
tirade I told her, "If you're
open, just take it." She's a
real good shooter.'

back for (the Nov. 25 game at) Ten
nessee."
Fortunately, Whiting's was the only
injury in a game that was dominated by
physical and sloppy play. All told, 62
fouls were whistled on both teams, and
there were 55 turnovers.
And then there was one. With Whit
ing and Stevens gone, the remaining big
player had to move inside and take on
the burden. Junior forward Julie Zeil
stra was equal to the task, pulling down
six rebounds and chipping in 27 points
to lead all scorers. Tne mobile Zeilstra
found most of her points by maneuver
ing around the basket for lay-ups all
afternoon.
Another bright spot for the Cardinal
was the play of diminuitive sophomore
Molly Goodenbour. The smooth-shoot
ing guard was Saturday's answer to the
question "Who will be the fifth starter?"
as she shared backcourt duties with
Sonja Henning.
Like her predecessor at the position,
last year's Player of the Year, Jennifer
Azzi, Goodenbour showed a penchant
for outside shooting. The guard had the
1,726 fans in Maples exclaiming "Good
golly Miss Molly!" as she launched —
and made — three-pointers from all
over the floor. Fifteen of Goodenbour's
22 points came from three-point
baskets, as she hit five of eight beyond
the line.
VanDerveer explained the long-range
bombing: "Before she went on her
tirade I told her, 'If you're open, just
take it.' She's a real good shooter, and
why pass up a good shot like that?"
As expected, VanDerveer was able to
empty her bench in a game Stanford led
67-27 at halftime. Both Martha
Richards and freshman Christy Hedg
peth saw plenty of minutes at the big
guard spot, especially after Henning
uncharacteristically fouled out with
11:40 remaining in the game. Richards
came on late with a pair of threes, and
VanDerveer liked what she saw in Hedg
peth's first collegiate game.
"I was real pleased with Christy.
She's a tough player," VanDerveer said.

Hedgpeth had seven points in 21 min
utes of time.
Fellow freshman Nikki Sevillian
capped off the rout with a nifty behind
the-back pass on a fast break to a
streaking Angela Taylor. The Cardinal is
back, and ready for a run at another
title.
Card notes
In a cultural exchange, members from
both teams swapped souvenir t-shirts in a
ceremony before the game. While the Ger
man tees were a stalwart white, the Cardinal
offering was a California mix of neon green
and pink on black.
Due to a roster error, senior forward Ann
Adkins was inadvertently left out of the sea
son preview article. Adkins, a 5-11 product
from Huntington, W.V, has returned to the
team after a year off, and made her return by
playing minutes in Saturday's game.

Al Green — Daily
After being named the Pac-10 Freshman of the Year last year, Val Whiting will face
a lot of defensive attention this season. Saturday she was able to rise to the occasion,
shooting over a shorter Bayer Leverkusen squad for 20 points and helping the
Cardinal to a 119-69 victory.
