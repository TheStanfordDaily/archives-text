# Water polo splits after controversial loss to Bruins
## 
### Aden Fine Staff writer 
If you've ever been to a water
polo game and been confused by
all the whistles and calls by the
referees, you are not alone.
In fact, some of the time the
referees aren't even sure about
what they're calling.
And unfortunately, the Stan
ford water polo team had to find
this out the hard way in Satur
day's game at UCLA. Leading 12-
11 with only 30 seconds remain
ing in overtime, the Cardinal had
the ball, and the game seemingly

put away.
But then the referees stepped
in and made a call that ultimately
led to a 13-12 UCLA win over the
No. 2-ranked Cardinal. What hap
pened was that with 26 seconds
left in the overtime period, red
shirt sophomore J.T. Matarangas
was kicked out of the game, giving
the Bruins a 6-on-5 advantage.
UCLA took a quick shot on goal,
but Larry Bercutt stopped it and
Stanford had the ball and could
just run out the clock and win the
game.
As is the normal process, when
Stanford got the ball back, the ref

eree waved Matarangas back into
the game and everything seemed
all right. But that's when chaos
broke out.
In water polo, each player is
allowed three "kick-outs" (ejec
tions) before he is banned from
the rest of the game. The scoring
table keeps these statistics and is
supposed to wave a red flag to tell
the referee when a player has
picked up his third kick-out.
According to the scoring table
at the UCLA game, this last ejec
tion was Matarangas' third of the
game, so he shouldn't have been
back in the water. The rules fur-

ther state that if a player comes in
when he already has three ejec
tions and this occurs in the last
minute of a game — which it did
here — then the other team will
be awarded a penalty shot.
The only thing is that the red
flag wasn't waved before
Matarangas came back in, so it
seemed like the referees would
have to rule that no penalty shot
could be awarded.
Not surprisingly, the UCLA
coach didn't agree and felt that
Matarangas should have known
he had three ejections and, there
fore, shouldn't have gone back
into the game. After about five
minutes of heated discussion, the
referees decided that the Bruin
coach was right and awarded the
host team the 4-meter penalty
shot.
The Bruins capitalized on this
gift and used it to send the game
into a sudden-death period. The
Bruins then scored the winning
goal on their first possession to
win the game.
The Cardinal was obviously
upset with the decision. "When we
were sitting in the water, waiting
for their decision, I couldn't
believe that they would give them
a penalty shot," said Rick McNair.
However upset the Stanford
coaches and players were at the
time, after the game, they could
only get more enfuriated. The rea
son? Matarangas didn't even have
three kick-outs.
Evidently, as the team found
out after reflecting on the game,
the scoring table had erroneously

credited Matarangas with one of
McNair's kick-outs. The team has
a video of the game which docu
ments the controversy, and coach
Dante Dettamanti plans to file an
official protest with the Pacific 10
Conference office today. The
results of this decision will be
announced later this week.
As Dettamanti said, "I've never
filed a protest before, but I can't
possibly see how they'd not
uphold the protest. The referees'
decision clearly cost us the game."
The referees' decision also
overshadowed another great
thriller between the Cardinal and
the Bruins. In their last two meet
ings, the teams had gone into
overtime to settle the contest.
Stanford jumped out to an
early 3-0 lead, behind goals by
Chuck Maguy, McNair, and Greg
Morris, and the Cardinal
remained in control for the rest of
the game. In fact, Stanford never
trailed in regulation play.
McNair, Maguy, and Greg
Olson all scored three goals for
Stanford, but their performances
could not overcome the incredible
individual display that UCLA's
Stefan Pollman put on. Pollman
scored an amazing seven goals in
the game to keep his team in con
tention, and it was his goal on a 6-
on-5 advantage with 1:10 left in
the game that tied the game up at
9-9 and sent it into the fateful
overtime period.
Despite Pollman's perfor
mance, the Cardinal still domi
nated most of the game and would
have won if it were not for the
controversy. In the overtime
period, Pollman started out the
scoring to give the No. 4 Bruins
the lead, but McNair and Colin
Keely responded to give the Cardi
nal an 11-10 lead after the first
half of overtime. Olson started out

the second half with a goal to put
the team ahead by two, but the
Bruins scored right away to make
the score 12-11. And that is where
the game stood when the contro
versy occurred.
After the UCLA penalty shot
sent the game into sudden death,
Stanford won the opening sprint
and had the first chance to win
the game, but Keely's shot was
stopped by the Bruin defense.
Then, with the Cardinal defense
helping out on Pollman, the Bru
ins' left-handed Javier Escobar let
loose with a skip shot from out
side that found its way past
Bercutt and into the corner of the
goal for the UCLA win.
Even though the team is upset
with how the game ended, the
Cardinal is happy with its perfor
mance. As McNair said, "We still
played a really good game. We beat
them the entire game, and we
proved that we're a better team
than they are."
On Friday night, Stanford also
proved it is a better team than
USC, as the Cardinal beat the
Trojans for the third time this
year in a low-scoring 8-6 affair.
The favored Cardinal started out
slowly in this game, and at half
time was trailing the No. 6 Tro
jans 4-3.
"We came out really slow this
time," Dettamanti said. "We had a
lot of opportunities, but we just
missed all of our shots."
Stanford played much better in
the second half and took a 6-5 lead
after the third quarter that the
team would never give up. McNair
scored three goals in the game and
Chip Blankenhorn added two.
As Dettamanti said, "We didn't
play great, but we played well
enough to win the game."
Too bad that wasn't enough
against UCLA.
