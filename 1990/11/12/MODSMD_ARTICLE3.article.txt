# Travels lead to Stanford
## Facilities head brings worlds of experience to job 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
Col. Dennis Culp is used to exotic envi
ronments.
Culp, who has been in the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers for 26 years, has lived
and worked throughout the United States,
Europe and the Far East. Next month he
will try a new climate, as he becomes Stan
ford's associate vice president of facilities.
"I want to make the Stanford campus
the best it can be," said Culp, who will
assume the newly created post Dec. 1.
To do so, Culp said he wants to bring a
team approach to Operations and Mainte
nance and Facilities Project Management
â€” the two offices he will oversee.
Culp said he will have no difficulty in the
transition from the corps to the University,
but he wants to spend the first month or
two "really getting to know Stanford."
"Once I get my feet in the ground, I'll
feel a lot more confident," he said.
Saying he has "no agenda for change,"
Culp explained he wants to "put the
employees' minds at ease." He added he is
coming to Stanford with an "uncompromis

and a "deep abiding concern for people."
"We've got to be a results-oriented

team," he scud, but "the way in which
results are delivered" is also very impor
tant.
Gulp was born in the "very small" town
of Wenatchee, Wash. "Only someone who's
from there would know how to spell it,"he
said laughing.
Six months after he was born, however,
his family moved, as it did about every two
years for the rest of his childhood. His
father had entered the Navy Civil Engineer
Corps after college and his work required
that the family relocate often.
"The Navy seems to have this idea where
they assign you to the East Coast, then the
West Coast, then the East Coast," he said.
Though he still calls Washington home,
he lived in California three times during his
childhood. His family was twice assigned to
Alameda, and he has also lived in the Cen
tral Valley.
Culp, who has two younger sisters, said
his family carried on not so much a military
tradition as an "engineering tradition."
Besides his father, three of his four uncles
are engineers. The family also has a "strong
sense of public service," he said.
His best memories of childhood are con
tinually meeting new people and an overall
