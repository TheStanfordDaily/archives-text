# Travels lead to Stanford
## Facilities head brings worlds of experience to job 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
Col. Dennis Culp is used to exotic envi
ronments.
Culp, who has been in the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers for 26 years, has lived
and worked throughout the United States,
Europe and the Far East. Next month he
will try a new climate, as he becomes Stan
ford's associate vice president of facilities.
"I want to make the Stanford campus
the best it can be," said Culp, who will
assume the newly created post Dec. 1.
To do so, Culp said he wants to bring a
team approach to Operations and Mainte
nance and Facilities Project Management
— the two offices he will oversee.
Culp said he will have no difficulty in the
transition from the corps to the University,
but he wants to spend the first month or
two "really getting to know Stanford."
"Once I get my feet in the ground, I'll
feel a lot more confident," he said.
Saying he has "no agenda for change,"
Culp explained he wants to "put the
employees' minds at ease." He added he is
coming to Stanford with an "uncompromis
ing belief in trust, honesty and integrity"
and a "deep abiding concern for people."
"We've got to be a results-oriented

team," he scud, but "the way in which
results are delivered" is also very impor
tant.
Gulp was born in the "very small" town
of Wenatchee, Wash. "Only someone who's
from there would know how to spell it,"he
said laughing.
Six months after he was born, however,
his family moved, as it did about every two
years for the rest of his childhood. His
father had entered the Navy Civil Engineer
Corps after college and his work required
that the family relocate often.
"The Navy seems to have this idea where
they assign you to the East Coast, then the
West Coast, then the East Coast," he said.
Though he still calls Washington home,
he lived in California three times during his
childhood. His family was twice assigned to
Alameda, and he has also lived in the Cen
tral Valley.
Culp, who has two younger sisters, said
his family carried on not so much a military
tradition as an "engineering tradition."
Besides his father, three of his four uncles
are engineers. The family also has a "strong
sense of public service," he said.
His best memories of childhood are con
tinually meeting new people and an overall
sense of "travel and adventure."
Culp's family lived in Guam dur
ing his junior high school years.
The mobility wasn't always
easy, however. Culp said it was
hard to leave his friends. But the
"sense of excitement" compen
sated for any negatives, he added.
Now a Santa Rosa resident,
Culp said he can remember fondly
the friends he has made through
out the world. "I wouldn't have
traded that life for any other," he
said.
Culp graduated from the U.S.
Military Academy at West Point in
1964. He described his experience

there as "consuming." At the
academy, he concentrated on engi
neering and was heavily involved
in academics, athletics and vari
ous committees and leadership
positions, he «aid.
"There were never enough
hours in the clay," Culp said.
He said he has no way to mea
sure the difficulty of academics at
West Point because he "never had
a whole lot of trouble." The aca
demics. Culp «aid, were "as rigor
ous as I could get with the broad
based education" that West Point
offers and whiich he said he sup
ports.
Surviving graduate school at
the Massachu setts Institute of
Technology was harder, he said,
calling it "an enriching, engaging
experience." As an engineering

graduate student he "studied
what could be done," while as a
political science graduate student
at the University of Kansas he
later "studied what should be
done," he explained.
The two graduate experiences
gave him a "balanced perspective"
— he said he still uses parts of his
Kansas education in his day-to
day engineering life. "I couldn't
point to any specific course or pas
sage, [but mainly to] the philo
sophical underpinnings," he
noted.
Culp said he periodically
reviews some of his knowledge
from political science, but lately
he has been too busy. He added he
is looking forward to his time at
Stanford as a chance to renew his
acquaintance with his academic

past.
Culp said the quality of the
people with whom he has worked
has been a constant throughout
his life. "I like to be around people
who work hard and play hard."
Culp said he had a variety of
leadership positions in his career,
ranging from handling routine
duties to emergency situations.
He was Dean of the Academic
Board at West Point, where he
was a watchdog for administra
tive and budget activities within
the academic department. After
the Earthquake of 1989, he was
responsible for 300 employees
who conducted emergency inspec
tions of buildings throughout the
Bay Area.
Culp has helped design space
launch facilities and even a small

city in Germany. For the last two
years he has been the deputy com
mander of the Corps of Engineers'
South Pacific Division, which
includes California, Utah, Nevada
and Arizona.
In this position he has overseen
planning and program manage
ment of flood control pro
jects and directed management of
engineering and construction at
32 military installations in his
division.
Culp said his most challenging
engineering task is the ongoing
development of a flood control
system in the Santa Ana River
basin outside Los Angeles. The $1
billion-plus project is incredibly
complex and involves working
with many different organiza
tions, he said.

Using this project as an exam
ple of his overall organizational
philosophy, he noted the impor
tance of the large number of peo
ple involved. "No one man can do
it all," he said. "It's always a team
approach" that solves problems.

For the record

Two numbers were reversed in
a chart accompanying a story
Friday on the projected shortfall
in the University's 1990-91 oper
ating budget. The projected short
fall due to lower research volume
is $2.5 million. The projected
shortfall due to the provisional
indirect cost rate is $1.2 million.
The figures were correct in the
story itself.

a chart accompanying a story
Friday on the projected shortfall
in the University's 1990-91 oper
ating budget. The projected short
fall due to lower research volume
is $2.5 million. The projected
shortfall due to the provisional
indirect cost rate is $1.2 million.
The figures were correct in the
story itself.
Col. Dennis Culp is used to exotic envi
ronments.
Culp, who has been in the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers for 26 years, has lived
and worked throughout the United States,
Europe and the Far East. Next month he
will try a new climate, as he becomes Stan
ford's associate vice president of facilities.
"I want to make the Stanford campus
the best it can be," said Culp, who will
assume the newly created post Dec. 1.
To do so, Culp said he wants to bring a
team approach to Operations and Mainte
nance and Facilities Project Management
— the two offices he will oversee.
Culp said he will have no difficulty in the
transition from the corps to the University,
but he wants to spend the first month or
two "really getting to know Stanford."
"Once I get my feet in the ground, I'll
feel a lot more confident," he said.
Saying he has "no agenda for change,"
Culp explained he wants to "put the
employees' minds at ease." He added he is
coming to Stanford with an "uncompromis
ing belief in trust, honesty and integrity"
and a "deep abiding concern for people."
"We've got to be a results-oriented

team," he scud, but "the way in which
results are delivered" is also very impor
tant.
Gulp was born in the "very small" town
of Wenatchee, Wash. "Only someone who's
from there would know how to spell it,"he
said laughing.
Six months after he was born, however,
his family moved, as it did about every two
years for the rest of his childhood. His
father had entered the Navy Civil Engineer
Corps after college and his work required
that the family relocate often.
"The Navy seems to have this idea where
they assign you to the East Coast, then the
West Coast, then the East Coast," he said.
Though he still calls Washington home,
he lived in California three times during his
childhood. His family was twice assigned to
Alameda, and he has also lived in the Cen
tral Valley.
Culp, who has two younger sisters, said
his family carried on not so much a military
tradition as an "engineering tradition."
Besides his father, three of his four uncles
are engineers. The family also has a "strong
sense of public service," he said.
His best memories of childhood are con
tinually meeting new people and an overall
sense of "travel and adventure."
Culp's family lived in Guam dur
ing his junior high school years.
The mobility wasn't always
easy, however. Culp said it was
hard to leave his friends. But the
"sense of excitement" compen
sated for any negatives, he added.
Now a Santa Rosa resident,
Culp said he can remember fondly
the friends he has made through
out the world. "I wouldn't have
traded that life for any other," he
said.
Culp graduated from the U.S.
Military Academy at West Point in
1964. He described his experience

there as "consuming." At the
academy, he concentrated on engi
neering and was heavily involved
in academics, athletics and vari
ous committees and leadership
positions, he «aid.
"There were never enough
hours in the clay," Culp said.
He said he has no way to mea
sure the difficulty of academics at
West Point because he "never had
a whole lot of trouble." The aca
demics. Culp «aid, were "as rigor
ous as I could get with the broad
based education" that West Point
offers and whiich he said he sup
ports.
Surviving graduate school at
the Massachu setts Institute of
Technology was harder, he said,
calling it "an enriching, engaging
experience." As an engineering

graduate student he "studied
what could be done," while as a
political science graduate student
at the University of Kansas he
later "studied what should be
done," he explained.
The two graduate experiences
gave him a "balanced perspective"
— he said he still uses parts of his
Kansas education in his day-to
day engineering life. "I couldn't
point to any specific course or pas
sage, [but mainly to] the philo
sophical underpinnings," he
noted.
Culp said he periodically
reviews some of his knowledge
from political science, but lately
he has been too busy. He added he
is looking forward to his time at
Stanford as a chance to renew his
acquaintance with his academic

past.
Culp said the quality of the
people with whom he has worked
has been a constant throughout
his life. "I like to be around people
who work hard and play hard."
Culp said he had a variety of
leadership positions in his career,
ranging from handling routine
duties to emergency situations.
He was Dean of the Academic
Board at West Point, where he
was a watchdog for administra
tive and budget activities within
the academic department. After
the Earthquake of 1989, he was
responsible for 300 employees
who conducted emergency inspec
tions of buildings throughout the
Bay Area.
Culp has helped design space
launch facilities and even a small

city in Germany. For the last two
years he has been the deputy com
mander of the Corps of Engineers'
South Pacific Division, which
includes California, Utah, Nevada
and Arizona.
In this position he has overseen
planning and program manage
ment of flood control pro
jects and directed management of
engineering and construction at
32 military installations in his
division.
Culp said his most challenging
engineering task is the ongoing
development of a flood control
system in the Santa Ana River
basin outside Los Angeles. The $1
billion-plus project is incredibly
complex and involves working
with many different organiza
tions, he said.

Using this project as an exam
ple of his overall organizational
philosophy, he noted the impor
tance of the large number of peo
ple involved. "No one man can do
it all," he said. "It's always a team
approach" that solves problems.
