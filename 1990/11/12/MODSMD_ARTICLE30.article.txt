### Gretchen Atwood Staff writer 
Would you like to visit Min
nesota in the winter? Teri
Whitlinger, Heather Willens, and
Emma Woodhouse would. If they
win the Rolex Regional qualifying
tournament this afternoon at the
Stanford Tennis Stadium then
Minneapolis will be their destina
tion in early February.
No. 2 seed Whitlinger takes on
top-seeded Emily Viqueira from
California at 1 p.m. today. At the
same time No. 4 seed Willens and
Woodhouse plays Cal's tandem of
Sara Maynard and Tiffiny Silveria
in the doubles final.
Although Whitlinger has never
lost to Viqueira she expects a
tough match. "She runs down a
lot of balls and makes you win the
points," said Whitlinger.
Viqueira has raised her game in
recent months. At the All-Ameri

can Championships Viqueira
made it to the semifinals. "I think
she and Heather are the two most
improved players in the college
game today," said Stanford Asst.
coach Lele Forood.
Whitlinger cruised to the final
without losing a set. "I didn't feel
like I was playing well at the
beginning of the tournament.
Now my level has picked up," said
Whitlinger. Her sharp play was
evident in her 6-3, 6-2 semifinal
victory over doubles partner and
No. 5 seed Laxmi Poruri.
Whitlinger defeated Nevada's
Christy Marsh 6-1, 6-0 and Susan
Cahoon of Washington 6-4, 6-1
Friday. Saturday she bested
Nevada's Tracey King 6-4, 6-0 and
Cal's Cara Abe 6-3, 6-4 to reach
the semis.
Poruri got there with straight
set wins over San Jose State's
Leslie Ruiz and Washington
State's Brittany Durbin on Friday

and Cal's Ellen Walliser and
Fresno State's Cecile Bourdais
Saturday.
Viqueira cruised until the semi
finals where she ran into Willens,
the No. 4 seed. Willens dominated
Viqueira in the first set, 6-2, but
dropped the second and third sets
3-6, 3-6.
"She dictated play in the first
set. She lost momentum in the
second set and Emily was able to
take it to her," said Forood.
Willens appeared to have some
physical problems early in the sec
ond set. "I just caught a little
cold," explained Willens, "I just
got really tired at 2-2. I was too
tired to really dig in."
Willens defeated Cal's Trina
Jong 6-3, 6-0 and Nevada's
Kristin Wertenburger 6-0,6-0 Fri
day. Saturday she topped Leslie
O'Keefe of the University of the
Pacific 6-4, 6-2 and teammate
Woodhouse 6-3, 6-1.

'I think [Viqueira] and
Heather are the two
most improved play
ers in the college
game today.'

After the grueling singles
match Willens faced Viqueira in a
doubles quarterfinal showdown.
Willens and Woodhouse squeaked
by Viqueira and Walliser 6-7, 6-2,
7-6 (7-1). , _
"I didn't expect the match to be
so tough," said Willens, "We were
see-saw in that match."
In the semifinals Willens and
Woodhouse destroyed Fresno
State's pair of Bordais and Kori
Hill 6-2, 6-3. "I wanted to get out
of there," said Willens, "Espe
cially after losing singles, doubles
is not your number one priority."
"Willens and Woodhouse were
certainly tough," said Forood, "In
their first tournament together
they beat an established Cal team
and the No. 1 Fresno State team."
The other Stanford tandem did
not fare as well. No. 1 seed
Whitlinger and Poruri lost in
straight sets to Maynard and Sil
veria in the semifinals 7-5, 6-3
after beating Jong and Lina Lee of
Cal in the quarterfinals. "They
came out gunning for us as they
always do for Stanford and just
beat us," said Whitlinger.
Each Stanford team lost only
one game in the first round and
one in the second round to
advance to the quarters.
Also in the singles draw, Carina
Rolley defeated San Jose State's
Julie Williams 6-2, 6-4 before
falling to Bourdais 6-1, 6-2. Mario
Carruth lost to Cal's Lisa Parks 6-
3, 7-6 (8-6) in the first round.
