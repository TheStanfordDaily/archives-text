# Cardinal swimmers fare well in tune-up meet at Texas
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
The season hasn't started yet
and the Cardinal only brought
two eligible athletes from its
squad, but whenever the women's
swim teams from Stanford and
Texas get together, the result is a
big meet.
The Lady Longhorns, the top
ranked team in the preseason poll,
hosted a select squad of Stanford
swimmers and a full team from
Houston over the weekend in the
Texas Longhorn Invitational. And
while no score was kept, the com
petition was fast and furious Fri
day and Saturday at the Texas
Swimming Center.
In fact, it may have been a bit
too fast and furious, "it thought it
was really rushed," said sopho
more Janet Evans, who competed
in six events in the two-day meet.
But the Cardinal swimmers held
their own, winning six of the 13
individual events contested.
The meet involved two teams
that have won the last eight
NCAA titles in the second-ranked
Cardinal and host Texas and was
contested in the same pool where
Texas beat Stanford in the closest
NCAA meet ever last March.
Thus, despite the fact that the
meet was so early in the season,

there was some fast swimming.
Evans swam to victory in the
400-meter and 800-meter
freestyles as well as in the 400-
meter individual medley. The lat
ter earned her some revenge as
she beat both freshman teammate
Summer Sanders and Lady
Longhorn sophomore Erika
Hansen.
Sanders defeated Evans in that
event at the Goodwill Games this
summer while Hansen beat Evans
in the same event a week later at
the U.S. Long Course Nationals.
Evans also placed second in the
200-meter freestyle, third in the
200-meter backstroke and sev
enth in the 200-meter butterfly.
"I was happy with my swims,
especially the freestyles," Evans
said. "It was a practice meet to see
where we were.... It just showed
us where we are in our training
and where the Texas girls are in
theirs. In general I'm glad we
went."
Sanders won the 200-meter
butterfly by 4.5 seconds and the
200-meter IM by more than three
seconds. She also placed second to
Evans in the 400 IM, fourth in the
100-meter butterfly, fifth in the
200-meter breaststroke and sixth
in the 100-meter backstroke.
Sophomore Lea Loveless also
competed in the meet over the

weekend, although she isn't cur
rently eligible to swim for Stan
ford this year. She transferred
from Florida after the Gator coach
left the program and has to sit out
one year according to NCAA regu
lations.
Loveless, who placed second in
both the 100-yard and 200-yard
backstrokes at the NCAA Cham
pionships as a Florida freshman,
won the 100-meter backstroke
and placed second in the 200-
meter backstroke this weekend.
One other Stanford swimmer,
June graduate Jill Johnson,
placed third in both the 100-meter
and 200-meter breaststrokes.
Johnson, Evans and Sanders will
all be competing for the U.S.
squad at the World Champi
onships in Australia this January.
"Texas looked good," Evans
said, "but this early we can't tell.
As far as the general attitude of
the team, we're training really
hard and we're committed to
being the best."


Sophomore Janet Evans tuned up for January's World Championships by winning three events at
the Texas Longhorn Invitational this weekend. Evans won the 400-meter and 800-meter freestyles and
the 400-meter IM over the weekend, the same three events she won at the 1988 Olympics.
