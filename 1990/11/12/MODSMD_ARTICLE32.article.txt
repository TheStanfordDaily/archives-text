me, but fortunately I was able to
find the open man."
"We need to get tougher down
low," Johnson said. "Our probelm
so far has not been the new of

twice out of bounds and lost a

rebound when we could have

Drexler scored 17 of his 23 points
in the first half and Kevin Duck
worth added 22 as Portland re
mained the NBA's only unde
feated team with a 138-107 victory
over the Los Angeles Clippers last
night.
Charles Smith's 21 points led
the Clippers, who lost their fourth
straight game by a lopsided mar
gin after winning their first two.
Ken Norman added 20 for Los
Angeles, which lost the four
games by an average margin of 26.
The Trail Blazers built a 69-42
halftime lead as Drexler scored
13 points in the first quarter and
Cliff Robinson came off the bench
for 10 of his 16 points in the
second period.
Duckworth scored 14 points in
the third period, hitting six of
eight shots from the field, as
Portland extended its lead to 105-
76.

The Trail Blazers (5-0) took
their biggest lead early in the
fourth quarter when Robinson
scored four consecutive points for
a 121-84 advantage with 8:32
remaining.
Terry Porter added 17 points
for Portland, 12 of those in the
first half, and passed for 10 as
sists.
Blazers coach Rick Adelman
said it was the balance throughout
the Blazers lineup that stopped
the Clippers.
"We were so unselfish," Adel
man said. "I worried how emo
tional we would be after the two
intense wins earlier (over the Pis
tons and the Lakers). We just took
advantage of thwe situation.
"They (the Clippers) were a
little tired from last night's game
with Atlanta and we were really
sharp," Adelman said. "We moved
the ball so well and we had so
many touch passes."
Porter, who was 6-for-9 from
the field, felt that the victory over
Detroit was the best overall game
this year.
"Tonight we didn't have to call
many plays," Porter said. The
Blazers scored 40 points off fast
breaks.
"We eliminated their easy shot
and got the boards and set our
offense in motion," Porter said.

"They played great defensively;
they were great in transition,"
Clippers coach Mike Schuler said.
"Portland was awfully good last
year and Danny Ainge makes
them better. He can play both
(guard) positions and they don't
lose that much when he's in
there."

Utah took advantage of a 2-for

remaining in the game.
But the Rockets regained the

March and gave them a 3-1 record
at their new Target Center. Min
nesota recorded its first back-to
back 100-point games since last
