# Cross country teams end season well at district meet
## 
### Uri Attia Staff writer 
While Stanford will be sending
neither its men's cross country
team nor its women's squad to the
NCAA Championships, the Cardi
nal did not fail to impress at the
District-8 Championships Satur
day.
The men took fifth in the race,
while the women took eighth in a
strong field. Stanford's perfor
mance at the meet, coupled with
the fact that all of the Cardinal's
finishers have at least one more
year of eligibility in the sport
remaining, lead team members,
managers, and coaches alike to

believe that Stanford will be head
ing to nationals on a regular basis
in coming years.
"Next year, we'll return at least
six (although senior Jason Martin
has one year of eligibility remain
ing, he has considered forgoing it),
and it won't be a question of 'if we
make nationals, men's coach
Scott Chisam said.
The women finished well
despite losing their number one
runner, senior Melanie Bloch, who
had to pull out of the race after
about a mile and a half. The first
Stanford finisher in the race was
sophomore Ashley Black, who ran
a 17:58 for the five-kilometer
course. Following her were Jodie

Bilotta, Jill Shenkel, Alexa Lange,
Debbie Wells and Amy McConnell.
"1 was very happy with how the
race went," said Bilotta, who has
come back from several injury
filled seasons to post an 18:10, her
best race in over three years. "I
was a little surprised with my
time."
Although the team boasted
some excellent individual efforts,
neither Bilotta nor her teammates
have lost sight of the fact that this
cross country season has been
more of a stepping stone for the
coming years than anything else.
"For us, the race was more geared
for next year," Bilotta said. "I'm
really excited about the team for

next year."
The 1990 women's squad con
sists of Bilotta, a junior with two
years of eligibility remaining,
Black and Shenkel, two sopho
mores, eight freshmen, and a lone
senior. The squad got a good sense
of what running without Bloch
would be like in coming years
because of her injury in the race.
"The women's team did real
well without Melanie," team man
ager Thurl Bailey said. "There's a
great deal of hope for next year.
All we need is more race experi
ence."
Lange, a freshman, also shares
Bailey's enthusiasm. "We've all
gotten along really well this year,"

she said. "If the team hadn't been
as together as we were, we
wouldn't have done nearly as well.
We rely on support from each
other."
The team concept has applied
to the men's team all season long
as well, as reflected in the fact
that the top four Cardinal finish
ers, Gary Stolz, Martin, Fred
Carter and Dave Scudamore, all
finished within 35 seconds of each
other. They were followed by Brett
Allsop, Alex Accetta and Dave
Strang. The Cardinal was
defeated by only Arizona, Wash
ington, Oregon and Portland, a
surprise fourth-place finisher. The
top three teams will go to

Knoxville, Tenn., for the NCAA
Championships.
"Gary ran an excellent race,"
Bailey said of Stolz, who, after a
dismal freshman year in cross
country has posted numerous out
standing times in the 1990 season.
"He just keeps getting better."
Stolz finished 16th overall in
the race, which was v/on by Ari
zona senior Marc Davis in a time
of 30:08 for 10 kilometers. Buffy
Rabbitt won the women's race,
relying largely on the strength of
her great name to propel herself
to victory in a closely-contested
finish. Her UC-Irvine team took
second at the race, with Oregon
taking first and UCLA third.
