# Public interest law examined

### Samantha Sherman Staff writer 
Covering issues from the
environment to homelessness to
civil rights, the eighth annual
Stanford Public Interest Law
Conference brought more than
150 participants to the Law
School Friday.
Sponsored by the Law
School's Office of Career Ser
vices, the conference, titled
"And Justice for All," featured
six panel discussions on career
opportunities in public interest
law and a keynote address by
Eva Paterson, executive director
of the San Francisco Lawyers'
Committee for Urban Affairs.
While there were only about
60 participants at last year's
conference, more than 150 peo
ple were preregistered this year,
with even more showing up Fri
day. Gigi Dennard, assistant
director of career services at the
Law School, attributed the
growth to greater publicity both
within and outside the Stanford
community.
Although the majority of
those who attended were law
students and Bay Area attor
neys, undergraduates and social
activists interested in the prob
lems of society's poor and
underrepresented were also
encouraged to participate.
A reception afterward in the
Law School lounge enabled stu
dents to meet with alumni and

local public interest profession
als.
Following a general welcome
and opening remarks by Den
nard, Paterson delivered the
keynote address, saying she
hoped "to motivate and enlist
[the audience] in the fight for
justice."
While Paterson said she con
siders the nation to be in a cri
sis, "the most important thing is
not to get into a state of
despair." She urged students
not to lose sight of all the
changes that have been made
and to get into a "feisty, fighting
spirit."
"The way to win in the '90s is
in coalitions," she said, a point
reiterated by many of the pan
elists. "Talk to each other, edu
cate each other and stand up for
each other," Paterson told stu
dents. She also stressed a cre
ative approach to dealing with
problems, warning that a law
suit might not always be the
best solution.
In closing, Paterson urged
students to act with integrity
when practicing law. Racism,
sexism and homophobia are
very much alive in the '90s, she
said, but "the Stanford creden
tial will give you access to amaz
ing places. Act responsibly."
In a panel discussion focus
ing on environmental issues,
Edith Adame, legal counsel for
the Latino Issues Forum, said
racism and economic inequality

result in minorities suffering
more work-related hazards and
living closer to toxic waste
dumps than the average white
person.
When Nancy Davis, executive
director of Equal Rights Advo
cates, Inc., entered law school,
she was told she was "taking
some man's place." In the panel
on gender discrimination, Davis
said, "We must stay and fight
the good fight."
In a panel on housing and
homelessness, John Groen, a
Pacific Legal Foundation attor
ney, warned against the
"NIMBY" - not in my back
yard â€” syndrome. We must
face the fact that "California's
population is going to continue
to grow not only by birthrate
here, but by immigration from
other countries and other
states," he said.
In discussing the vetoed 1990
Civil Rights Act, William
McNeill, senior staff attorney
for the Employment Law Cen
ter, said more effort needs to be
made to inform the electorate in
the future.
Lois Salisbury, staff attorney
for Public Advocates, told stu
dents institutional reform in
schools is "one of the toughest
nuts to crack." Essential to edu
cational reform is both a sense
of teamwork among those in
charge of kids and the belief
that all kids can perform at a
very high level, she said.
