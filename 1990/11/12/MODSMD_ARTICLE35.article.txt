# Commuters get parking perks
## New program gives free permits to those who share rides 
### Anna Rabinowicz Staff writer 
Fifty percent more off-campus students, faculty
and staff are carpooling this year and receiving free
parking permits as part of Transportation Pro
grams' project to ease parking problems.
Called the Transportation Demand Management
program, the project intends to reduce air pollution
and traffic congestion and make parking on campus
easier by decreasing the use of single-occupancy
cars.
The program is part of the University's promise
to Santa Clara County to generate "no new trips" â€”
no additional people using their own vehicles to drive
to campus. In addition, it fulfills some of the require
ments of Stanford's General Use Permit, which
allows renovation and construction on campus.
Use of the department's other programs, includ
ing a van pool program and the Marguerite shuttle
bus, has also increased.
In order to receive a complimentary "C" parking
permit, normally priced at $50, two people must
prove to the Stanford Police that they are University
or Stanford Hospital employees or commuting stu
dents, that they work or study in a central part of the
University and that they both own cars.
To obtain a free "A" Permit, which entitles drivers
to preferential spaces on campus and normally costs
$200, three or more commuters must register in the
same manner.
By the first week of October, police had issued 59
free "A" permits and 195 free "C" permits, about 3
percent of the total number of permits purchased.
This year, the department also designated prime
parking spaces on campus for those with carpool per
mits.
Transportation Programs set up an in-house com
puterized carpool program in April to match up peo

pie who live in the same areas. Although demand
fluctuates, up to 259 people, mostly staff members,
have requested this service at one time, according to
Diego Terneus, project manager for the Demand
Management program.
"The word is getting out that the service is avail
able," he said.
The program is designed to save Stanford money
in the long run, Terneus said. If more people share
rides, the University will need to build fewer parking
lots and parking structures.
However, Transportation Programs is currently
losing money, Terneus said.
"It's usually a washout," Terneus said. "Even the
$200 'A' Permit still doesn't cover the cost of the
parking space."
The department's van pool program shuttles 66
employees to Stanford from San Francisco, Mantica,
Modesto and Fremont. Van riders can claim up to
$480 per year of California income tax credit.
"The hardest part is trying to coordinate the
times of the van pools around people's work sched
ules," Terneus noted. He said he anticipates future
van pools from Daly City, Half Moon Bay and West
and East San Jose.
Since January 1989, the Marguerite bus has sup
plied free transportation to the California Avenue
train station as well as the Palo Alto train station,
the Park and Ride lot and other transit stops.
Terneus said this increased service encourages
people to use public transportation to and from cam
pus. Since September 1989, there has been about a
52 percent increase in the number of commuters
using the Marguerite. Terneus attributed most of
this increase to more commuters riding the Caltrain.
Terneus said he also hopes these projects will help
the University avoid massive improvements, such as
widening roads at intersections around the perime
ter of campus, by reducing traffic congestion.
