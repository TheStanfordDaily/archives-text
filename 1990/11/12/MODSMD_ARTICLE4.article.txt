# Students reach out to aid community
## 
### Dylan Tyson Staff writer 
A group of 20 Rinconada freshmen may not
have .lenown what to expect when they visited
these nior citizens at Channing House in Palo
Alto Saturday.
But they probably weren't planning to entertain
the seniors by serenading them with the theme song
from the television show "Cheers."
More than 800 students in 55 groups had similar
experiences Saturday as they took part in the 10th
annual "Reach Out Today" program, a campus-wide
community giervice project organized by the Stanford
Volunteer Network.
Groups performed many different projects
throughout the community, including programs for
youth, senior citizens, health, the environment and
even animals.
Other activities ranged from building a hiking
and equestrian trail from Almaden Valley to Santa
Teresa County Park to helping the Young Women's
Christian /issociation get mailings out. Some stu
dents conducted a "Read-A-Thon" in which Stanford
course materials were tape recorded for the Stanford
Disability Resource Center.
These events represented one of the biggest
Reach Out Today programs ever at Stanford, accord
ing to student organizer Erron Al-Amin, a junior.
