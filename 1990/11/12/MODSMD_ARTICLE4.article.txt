# Students reach out to aid community
## 
### Dylan Tyson Staff writer 
A group of 20 Rinconada freshmen may not
have .lenown what to expect when they visited
these nior citizens at Channing House in Palo
Alto Saturday.
But they probably weren't planning to entertain
the seniors by serenading them with the theme song
from the television show "Cheers."
More than 800 students in 55 groups had similar
experiences Saturday as they took part in the 10th
annual "Reach Out Today" program, a campus-wide
community giervice project organized by the Stanford
Volunteer Network.
Groups performed many different projects
throughout the community, including programs for
youth, senior citizens, health, the environment and
even animals.
Other activities ranged from building a hiking
and equestrian trail from Almaden Valley to Santa
Teresa County Park to helping the Young Women's
Christian /issociation get mailings out. Some stu
dents conducted a "Read-A-Thon" in which Stanford
course materials were tape recorded for the Stanford
Disability Resource Center.
These events represented one of the biggest
Reach Out Today programs ever at Stanford, accord
ing to student organizer Erron Al-Amin, a junior.

part of Saturday's campus-wide Reach Out Today program.
The purpose of Reach Out
Today is "to get people interested
in public service and get the Stan
ford community to contribute to
its surrounding area as a whole,"
Al-Amin said.
Participating groups included
dormitories, fraternities and a
sorority. Each had the opportu
nity to choose its project from a
list drafted by the volunteer net
work, but not every group got its
first choice.
The Rinconada residents did
not originally ask to work with
senior citizens. In fact, they
wanted to do a project with chil
dren or on the environment. But
not getting their first choice
turned out to have a positive
result.
When they went to Channing
House, many were apprehensive
about working with senior citi
zens, said student coordinator
Ben Hsieh, a freshman. Few of the
students had any experience deal
ing with elderly people, he said.
But tensions disappeared after

the serenade, Hsieh said. Sandra
Ward, a freshman, then per
formed ballet for the group. After
the dance, the freshmen intro
duced themselves and told their
hobbies and hometowns. They
then broke into groups and began
talking to the seniors on a per
sonal level.
The hour flew by, said Hsieh.
The group ended the visit with an
encore set of two songs. They sang
"Doe a Deer" from the musical
"Sound of Music" and were spon
taneously joined by the seniors in
"America the Beautiful."
The fact that the senior citi
zens joined in the last song was
the climax of the day, Hsieh said.
The students from Rinconada def
initely plan on going to Channing
again this year, he added.
Residents from Twain partici
pated in Reach Out Today in a
very different way — by working
with the Madeline J. Collishaw
Center for disabled children in
Santa Clara ,
The day for these children con
sisted of a tour of campus, a trip
to the top of Hoover Tower, a bar
becue, a magic show and a finger
painting session.
Tommy White, 5, said visiting

the tower was his favorite event
because he got to see the bells at
the top.
The children were bubbling
with enthusiasm all day, said
Christina Christenson, a worker
for the center. "They like to show
people how intelligent they are."
Christenson said the best part
of the day for the children was the
interaction with Stanford stu
dents and simply the opportunity
to be outdoors.
The program was not only fun
for the handicapped children but
provided a new outlook for Stan
ford volunteers. Freshman Laura
Kinsey, a Twain volunteer,
emphasized the broadening effect
it had.
"It made me realize how des
perately we need to look beyond
ourselves. At Stanford, we can
really get caught up in ourselves
and our classes, in the midterms
and everything that's going on
around here It really puts a
lot of the schoolwork and the
demands that are made on you
here in perspective."
The organizers of Reach Out
Today hope the dorms continue
the ties with their organization,
Al-Amin said.
