# Environmental awareness spawns record recycling levels
## 
### Margaret Fitzpatrick 
Seven months after Earth Day
spawned a wave of environmental aware
ness worldwide, recycling is at an all-time
high at Stanford.
Stanford Recycling Center coordinator
Barbara Voss said there was a 50 percent
increase over last year in volume of mate
rials processed, with a record 220 tons of
recyclables processed in October.
John Chang, publicity manager for the
recycling center, said volume has been
mushrooming. "It's up three to four
times what it was a few years ago, but the

budget is the same," he said.
"We're struggling to keep up with a
budget to cover half of what we're tak
ing," he added.
More than a third of the center's
$314,000 budget for this year will be gen
erated by recycling paper and beverage
containers.
A large part of the budget comes out of
the money the University saves by recy
cling instead of having paper and bever
age containers hauled to a land fill, Voss
said.
The center's largest cost is labor, total
ing about $214,000 annually. About 12

percent of these costs are offset by
donated labor.
"People have really become more con
scientious and have gone to more trouble
to bring in presorted stuff from their
offices and homes," said center employee
Leland Coleman. He said he has been par
ticularly glad to see younger families com
ing to the center and encouraging their
children to participate in recycling.
Voss said she believes most people
want to recycle but don't know how. This
quarter, the center is focusing its efforts
on disseminating "how to" information
through slide shows in dormitories.

Chang said he tries to educate stu
dents not only about the need to recycle
and the correct way to do it, but also
about the adverse effects that can result
from careless recycling.
Center employee Mike Franz com
plained that some people throw trash into
the green recycling bins placed through
out campus.
"They figure we'll deal, but it's very
time consuming," he said. "We'd like to be
able to make more runs to pick stuff up,
but we're too busy sorting."
Whether people sort their recyclables
correctly really does make a difference,
Chang said. "When its done wrong, it gob

bles up a lot of time," he added. "Less
recycling is done because someone didn't
flatten a box or put it in the right place."
He noted that if people would recycle
properly, the center could recycle 8,000
pounds of cardboard on a good day. He
said that would save about 700 trees.
California Assembly Bill 939 requires
all residents to divert 50 percent of their
waste into recycling by the year 2000 or
face stifTpenalties. The Stanford commu
nity is off to a good start with a recycling
rate of 17 percent. But to realize the 50
percent goal, Chang says, "People need to
realize every day is Earth Day."
