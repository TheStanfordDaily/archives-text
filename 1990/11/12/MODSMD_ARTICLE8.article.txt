# New Tree sets up roots with the Band
## 10 Questions 
### Peter Robison Staff writer 
The Tree, Stanford's official
mascot since 1978, has become a
(wooden) fixture at football games
and band rallies. Each year, the
Stanford Band picks a new person
to be the Tree, who then designs
an original costume. Todd David,
this year's Tree, describes himself
as a "balding junior majoring in
philosophy" coping with "the
pressure of always being funny."
; Tell us a little bit about
your roots. Where were you a
sapling?
I guess I was first planted in a
small little town called Cinnamin
son, N.J., and then I was uprooted
out to California.
Why did you decide to
become the Tree?
Because I was getting really fat
and I needed to lose weight, so I
decided to put on a 100-pound cos
tume every Saturday and run
around for hours losing weight...
Besides, doesn't everyone want to
be the Tree when they realize that
it's not a big asparagus on the
field?
' What sort of process did
ypu go through to get the job?
After the Miracle Grow didn't
work, the Stanford Band caught
me one day and they handed me
this piece of paper that had all

these weird questions on it. Then
they made me dress up as a Grate
ful Dead concert-going rabbi and
they asked me more questions.
Apparently, I answered them cor
rectly — or incorrectly, if it's a bad
thing that I'm the Tree — and
that's how I grot the job.
What considerations went
into your design for this
year's costume?
I guess I viranted to make the
suit as obnosrious as possible. I
mean, I consider it a big disco tree
from hell that moves up and down
when it gets excited — no phallic
symbol intended. It seemed differ
ent from a lot of the other Trees,
and it stands out in a crowd of
trees.
How comfortable is it
inside the coistume?
It's great. I have a little air-con
ditioning pack in there and a little
cooler so when I get hot I can just
drink right inside the suit. I'm
thinking about adding a refrigera
tor and cable ITV, too.

How did you feel about the
Department of Athletics*
recent suspension of the
Band?
I loved it. It gave me the day
off.
During halftime of the 1988
Big Game, the Tree got into a
fight with Oski the bear, the
UC-Berkeley mascot. Have
you had any problems with
other mascots?
No, I haven't had a lot of prob
lems. Usually other mascots see
the Tree and realize that I'm so
mobile and agile that they don't
want to start with me, especially
since I have the pop-oft hat. They
usually just stay away from me.
The [USC] flag girls beat the hell
out of me, though. I've got to stay
away from them.
Do you become a different
person when you put on the
costume?
I realize that I have to get into
a funny mood. ... I don't get very
contemplative when I'm inside

the suit — I don't know if 40,000
people want to watch the Tree sit
around and think. I have to be a
little more active.... I'm a pretty
cranky person in general, so it's

'Usually other mas
cots see the IVee and
realize that I'm so
mobile and agile that
they don't want to
start with me, espe
cially since I have the
pop-off hat.'

probably a good thing. It makes
me a better person to get along
with. A lot more women find me
attractive in the costume than out
of the costume.
What things have you
enjoyed most about being the
Tree?
The way it makes me smell
after a game. That's really a posi
tive. I've also er\joyed the Band's
popularity in Oregon and getting
to work with the Athletics Depart
ment.
Could you give us a hint of
what you and the Band have
in store for Big Game?
No.

' What sort of process did
ypu go through to get the job?
After the Miracle Grow didn't
work, the Stanford Band caught
me one day and they handed me
this piece of paper that had all

these weird questions on it. Then
they made me dress up as a Grate
ful Dead concert-going rabbi and
they asked me more questions.
Apparently, I answered them cor
rectly — or incorrectly, if it's a bad
thing that I'm the Tree — and
that's how I grot the job.
What considerations went
into your design for this
year's costume?
I guess I viranted to make the
suit as obnosrious as possible. I
mean, I consider it a big disco tree
from hell that moves up and down
when it gets excited — no phallic
symbol intended. It seemed differ
ent from a lot of the other Trees,
and it stands out in a crowd of
trees.
How comfortable is it
inside the coistume?
It's great. I have a little air-con
ditioning pack in there and a little
cooler so when I get hot I can just
drink right inside the suit. I'm
thinking about adding a refrigera
tor and cable ITV, too.

How did you feel about the
Department of Athletics*
recent suspension of the
Band?
I loved it. It gave me the day
off.
During halftime of the 1988
Big Game, the Tree got into a
fight with Oski the bear, the
UC-Berkeley mascot. Have
you had any problems with
other mascots?
No, I haven't had a lot of prob
lems. Usually other mascots see
the Tree and realize that I'm so
mobile and agile that they don't
want to start with me, especially
since I have the pop-oft hat. They
usually just stay away from me.
The [USC] flag girls beat the hell
out of me, though. I've got to stay
away from them.
Do you become a different
person when you put on the
costume?
I realize that I have to get into
a funny mood. ... I don't get very
contemplative when I'm inside

the suit — I don't know if 40,000
people want to watch the Tree sit
around and think. I have to be a
little more active.... I'm a pretty
cranky person in general, so it's

'Usually other mas
cots see the IVee and

start with me, espe
cially since I have the
pop-off hat.'

probably a good thing. It makes
me a better person to get along
with. A lot more women find me
attractive in the costume than out
of the costume.
What things have you
enjoyed most about being the
Tree?
The way it makes me smell
after a game. That's really a posi
tive. I've also er\joyed the Band's
popularity in Oregon and getting
to work with the Athletics Depart
ment.
Could you give us a hint of
what you and the Band have
in store for Big Game?
No.
