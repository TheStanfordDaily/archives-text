The Russells' silverware got caught in a forest fire.
So did the Russells.
Today, more and more people are living
closer and closer to the forests. That's why,

molding, and deformation are Raychem's fundamental
production processes.
We offer thousands of products to hundreds of markets
around the world. Our products include the XAGA
multi-purpose cable closure system, used by the
telecommunication industry. This heat-shrinkable sleeving
device is constructed with a tough polymer material. Our
high-density interconnect multichip module allows IC
designers to approach densities of wafer-scale integration
while retaining a choice of IC technologies, dielectrics and
package substrates. Raychem's PolySwitch® devices provide
reliable over-current protection as more digital electronic
switching systems are used in various markets. On pipelines,
self-regulating Auto-Trace® heating cable maintains
temperatures necessary to pump heavy petroleum products.
TraceTek® moisture sensing and locating systems offer
dependable leak detection in data processing centers and
other facilities where leaks can threaten valuable electronic
equipment. CryoWeld® couplings are made of Raychem's
Tinel® shape memory alloy; as they warm from their cryogenic
storage temperature, they shrink and grip pipe ends to create
a permanent, metal to metal connection. We also offer many
other products to a vast range of industries.
