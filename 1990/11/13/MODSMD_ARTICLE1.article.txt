# Media attention adds to tension in Florence
## 
### Michael Friedly Editorial staff 
Stanford students in Florence are safe
from attacks after a threat of violent action
was sent to other American universities
there, Overseas Center Director Tom
Heller said yesterday. However, he added
extensive media attention may cause stu
dents to be more frightened than necessary.
He said the "sudden burst of media
attention" may affect students' decisions
on whether to return to the United States
in response to the threats.
"We struggled very hard to try and keep
this thing within proportion," he said, but
added that the media attention has magni
fied the significance of the threat. The
Overseas Studies Center was swamped yes
terday with media inquiries.
"I am very worried that the publicity will
cause... a multiplication in Europe of such
(threatening) activities," he said.
Heller attacked the media in Italy and
the United States for "misinformation,"
including initial reports that Stanford was
one of the centers that received a threat and
reports that the Stanford center could be a
target because it had 300 students. The
center usually serves about 40 students per
quarter.
The threat was sent Nov. 2 to seven uni
versities by a previously unknown group
calling itself the Secret Popular Revolution
ary Movement. "If the imperialist Ameri

cans attack Iraqi territory, we will hit hard
American interests," the letter said in Ital
ian, according to Italian news reports.
Syracuse University, Florida State Uni
versity, California State University, the
University of Michigan, Georgetown Uni
versity, Pepperdine University and the Uni
versity of Wisconsin all received threats,
according to Stanford in Florence Director
Giuseppe Mammerella.
In addition, the Johns Hopkins center in
Bologna also received the threat, according
to Associated Press reports.
Mammerella said Stanford may not have
received a threat because it is listed under
"Stanford" in the telephone directory,
whereas the other universities are listed
under "Universit&t."
Heller said the threat was a "combina
tion of Middle Eastern rhetoric" and "far
left Italian rhetoric" similar to that of the
Red Brigades.
"It doesn't come from professional ter
rorists," Mammerella said. "It might be the
initiative of a radical group of students."
"A number of experts feel that there is a
disjunction of those who issue threats and
those who carry them out," Heller
explained. He said some groups operate in
public "just to scare people," whereas
groups that will actually carry out violent
acts work in secrecy.
The group that sent this threat "is just
playing to the press," he said.
Heller sent a letter Nov. 7 to all
parents of Florence students in
which he explained the options
for students at the center.
"Because of . . . prospective
hostilities in the Middle East, we
are developing procedures for
informing, advising and coordi
nating the actions of Stanford
students abroad," the letter said.
Heller offered a refund of
tuition and Overseas Studies fees
to students who decide to take a
leave of absence because of the

threat. Heller said yesterday that
no students had accepted the
offer.
Students in Florence said they
were concerned about the threat,
but did not take it seriously
enough to return to Stanford.
"We're stressed and we're con
cerned," said Meena Deo, a junior,
but added, "We're not panicking."
Students were informed of the
threats at a meeting last Monday
and were called together for
another meeting on Friday at
which they spoke to Corb Smith,
the associate director of Overseas
Studies. Smith, who was on a rou
tine tour of the European cam
puses, told students that the Uni
versity would be considering con

tingency plans this week in case a
war breaks out between the
United States and Iraq.
"Even if a war breaks out, we
are still not on the firing lines. We
are four hours away by plane,"
Mammerella asserted. He said the
center is working with the U.S.
State Department, the American
Consulate and the Italian police
in order to protect the students.
Mammerella said this was not
the first time the center has pre
pared itself against such an
attack. In 1986, after the United
States bombed Libya, the center
received "rumors and indirect
signs" that an attack against the
center was being considered in
retaliation.

Deo said the students were told
at the meeting not to wear Stan
ford clothing or other clothing
that could identify them as Amer
ican.
In addition, students are gen
erally told "not to congregate in
large groups," which are targets
for violence, according to Heller.
Deo said not much has
changed in Florence because of
the threat, but added that "you
don't see many people wearing
Stanford sweatshirts anymore."
"Its kind of unsettling that
even though you haven't done
anything, there is a threat against
you because you are American,"
she said.

are developing procedures for
informing, advising and coordi
nating the actions of Stanford
students abroad," the letter said.
Heller offered a refund of
tuition and Overseas Studies fees
to students who decide to take a
leave of absence because of the

threat. Heller said yesterday that
no students had accepted the
offer.
Students in Florence said they
were concerned about the threat,
but did not take it seriously
enough to return to Stanford.
"We're stressed and we're con
cerned," said Meena Deo, a junior,
but added, "We're not panicking."
Students were informed of the
threats at a meeting last Monday
and were called together for
another meeting on Friday at
which they spoke to Corb Smith,
the associate director of Overseas
Studies. Smith, who was on a rou
tine tour of the European cam
puses, told students that the Uni
versity would be considering con

tingency plans this week in case a
war breaks out between the
United States and Iraq.
"Even if a war breaks out, we
are still not on the firing lines. We
are four hours away by plane,"
Mammerella asserted. He said the
center is working with the U.S.
State Department, the American
Consulate and the Italian police
in order to protect the students.
Mammerella said this was not
the first time the center has pre
pared itself against such an
attack. In 1986, after the United
States bombed Libya, the center
received "rumors and indirect
signs" that an attack against the
center was being considered in
retaliation.

Deo said the students were told
at the meeting not to wear Stan
ford clothing or other clothing
that could identify them as Amer
ican.
In addition, students are gen
erally told "not to congregate in
large groups," which are targets
for violence, according to Heller.
Deo said not much has
changed in Florence because of
the threat, but added that "you
don't see many people wearing
Stanford sweatshirts anymore."
"Its kind of unsettling that
even though you haven't done
anything, there is a threat against
you because you are American,"
she said.
Stanford students in Florence are safe
from attacks after a threat of violent action
was sent to other American universities
there, Overseas Center Director Tom
Heller said yesterday. However, he added
extensive media attention may cause stu
dents to be more frightened than necessary.
He said the "sudden burst of media
attention" may affect students' decisions
on whether to return to the United States
in response to the threats.
"We struggled very hard to try and keep
this thing within proportion," he said, but
added that the media attention has magni
fied the significance of the threat. The
Overseas Studies Center was swamped yes
terday with media inquiries.
"I am very worried that the publicity will
cause... a multiplication in Europe of such
(threatening) activities," he said.
Heller attacked the media in Italy and
the United States for "misinformation,"
including initial reports that Stanford was
one of the centers that received a threat and
reports that the Stanford center could be a
target because it had 300 students. The
center usually serves about 40 students per
quarter.
The threat was sent Nov. 2 to seven uni
versities by a previously unknown group
calling itself the Secret Popular Revolution
ary Movement. "If the imperialist Ameri

cans attack Iraqi territory, we will hit hard
American interests," the letter said in Ital
ian, according to Italian news reports.
Syracuse University, Florida State Uni
versity, California State University, the
University of Michigan, Georgetown Uni
versity, Pepperdine University and the Uni
versity of Wisconsin all received threats,
according to Stanford in Florence Director
Giuseppe Mammerella.
In addition, the Johns Hopkins center in
Bologna also received the threat, according
to Associated Press reports.
Mammerella said Stanford may not have
received a threat because it is listed under
"Stanford" in the telephone directory,
whereas the other universities are listed
under "Universit&t."
Heller said the threat was a "combina
tion of Middle Eastern rhetoric" and "far
left Italian rhetoric" similar to that of the
Red Brigades.
"It doesn't come from professional ter
rorists," Mammerella said. "It might be the
initiative of a radical group of students."
"A number of experts feel that there is a
disjunction of those who issue threats and
those who carry them out," Heller
explained. He said some groups operate in
public "just to scare people," whereas
groups that will actually carry out violent
acts work in secrecy.
The group that sent this threat "is just
playing to the press," he said.
Heller sent a letter Nov. 7 to all
parents of Florence students in
which he explained the options
for students at the center.
"Because of . . . prospective
hostilities in the Middle East, we
are developing procedures for
informing, advising and coordi
nating the actions of Stanford
students abroad," the letter said.
