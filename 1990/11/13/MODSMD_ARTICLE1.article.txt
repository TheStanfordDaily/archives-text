# Media attention adds to tension in Florence

### Michael Friedly Editorial staff 
Stanford students in Florence are safe
from attacks after a threat of violent action
was sent to other American universities
there, Overseas Center Director Tom
Heller said yesterday. However, he added
extensive media attention may cause stu
dents to be more frightened than necessary.
He said the "sudden burst of media
attention" may affect students' decisions
on whether to return to the United States
in response to the threats.
"We struggled very hard to try and keep
this thing within proportion," he said, but
added that the media attention has magni
fied the significance of the threat. The
Overseas Studies Center was swamped yes
terday with media inquiries.
"I am very worried that the publicity will
cause... a multiplication in Europe of such
(threatening) activities," he said.
Heller attacked the media in Italy and
the United States for "misinformation,"
including initial reports that Stanford was
one of the centers that received a threat and
reports that the Stanford center could be a
target because it had 300 students. The
center usually serves about 40 students per
quarter.
The threat was sent Nov. 2 to seven uni
versities by a previously unknown group
calling itself the Secret Popular Revolution
ary Movement. "If the imperialist Ameri

cans attack Iraqi territory, we will hit hard
American interests," the letter said in Ital
ian, according to Italian news reports.
Syracuse University, Florida State Uni
versity, California State University, the
University of Michigan, Georgetown Uni
versity, Pepperdine University and the Uni
versity of Wisconsin all received threats,
according to Stanford in Florence Director
Giuseppe Mammerella.
In addition, the Johns Hopkins center in
Bologna also received the threat, according
to Associated Press reports.
Mammerella said Stanford may not have
received a threat because it is listed under
"Stanford" in the telephone directory,
whereas the other universities are listed
under "Universit&t."
Heller said the threat was a "combina
tion of Middle Eastern rhetoric" and "far
left Italian rhetoric" similar to that of the
Red Brigades.
"It doesn't come from professional ter
rorists," Mammerella said. "It might be the
initiative of a radical group of students."
"A number of experts feel that there is a
disjunction of those who issue threats and
those who carry them out," Heller
explained. He said some groups operate in
public "just to scare people," whereas
groups that will actually carry out violent
acts work in secrecy.
The group that sent this threat "is just
