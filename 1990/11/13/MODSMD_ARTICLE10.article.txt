### Brinda Sankaranarayanan 
As the probability of war in the
Middle East escalates, a mush
rooming group of Stanford stu
dents is cracking the veneer of
apathy on campus.
A fledgling committee is orga
nizing a "non-partisan rally and
sleep-out" starting Wednesday at
10 p.m. in White Plaza to oppose
U.S. military action in the Persian
Gulf.
Plans for the rally include
speakers "from all sides of the
political spectrum," open mike
discussions, vocal groups and
bands, a letter-writing table to
contact representatives in
Congress, construction of a wall
with murals and a refreshment
stand.
To ensure visible student
action after the rally, there will
also be a stand to make black arm
bands and "shocking, provocative
and newsworthy" posters for Big
Game, according to rally orga
nizer Tom Clyde, a senior.
"The main [purpose] is really
to stimulate more debate and dis
cussion on the issue," said Masao
Suzuki, a member of the Middle
East Action Committee, which
supports the rally. "It's an issue
that will ultimately affect young
people more than others. The
Stanford community can play a
very important role because we
attract a lot of media attention."
Clyde agreed that media cover
age of the rally was important.

cussion on the issue.

"We are the darlings of the news
media and we can make a differ
ence," he said. The committee
intends to send a press release
opposing troop increases to local
newspapers and broadcast sta
tions.
A colorful array of anti-war
posters taped to the ground
attracted over 300 student signa
tures at White Plaza last week.
"Campus reaction has been
great," said senior Mike Shaw.
"Mostly everyone stopped by."
Johanna Carr, also a senior,
said "pretty much anybody you
talk to on campus" has an opinion
about the crisis. She added that
the peace initiative was a "way to
unite hundreds of students." The
United States needs to explore
more diplomatic solutions, she
said.
Clyde said he is optimistic
about the rally's success. He said
he hopes the whole campus will
participate.
