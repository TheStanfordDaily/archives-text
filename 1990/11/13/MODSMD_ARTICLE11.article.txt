Emperor Akihito formally
ascends to throne
TOKYO (AP) — Emperor Akihito formally
became Japan's new monarch in all-day
enthronement ceremonies that were marred by
dozens of terrorist attacks, and national TV
said today that police fear more radical violence
is likely.
The rites yesterday marked the beginning of
nearly a month of festivities surrounding
Japan's first coronation in 62 years.
Akihito performs the most controversial rit
ual, a communion with the gods of Shinto, on
the night of Nov. 22-23. Government-run tele
vision said police will review security measures
before then because their great mobilization
yesterday failed to stop numerous leftist
attacks.
Israel offers compromise to U.N
JERUSALEM (AP) — In an effort to avoid
further U.N. Security Council criticism, Israeli
officials yesterday offered to receive a U.N.
envoy to discuss the treatment of Palestinians
under Israeli occupation.
The offer was billed as a compromise, and
the government made it clear that its offer did
not change Israel's rejection of a Security
Council resolution condemning the Oct. 8 Tem
ple Mount killings and demanding an investiga
tion.
Sari Nusseibeh, a pro-PLO Palestinian
leader in Jerusalem, rejected the Israeli pro
posal as a "fruitless enterprise."
An Israeli government official said the com
promise proposal was worked out in negotia
tions with the United States, which reportedly
refused an earlier Israeli plea to veto any fur
ther U.N. criticism.
GATT faces new crisis
GENEVA (AP) - The collapse of talks on
farm subsidies jeopardizes next month's meet
ing to conclude ambitious accords for liberaliz
ing trade, a senior trade official warned yester
day.
Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the Gen
eral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, told an
emergency meeting of senior trade negotiators
that political hurdles remained. The
emergency meeting was convened after talks
on cutting farm subsidies broke up in disarray.
Dunkel called for "basic changes in present
positions in the next hours or, at most, the next
days."
"It is not an exaggeration to say that the
Brussels meeting is now in jeopardy," he told a
special session of GATT's Trade Negotiations
Committee which is overseeing the Uruguay
Round of trade talks.
The talks, launched in 1986, are meant to
end by Dec. 7.
