# Bush pledges to work with Congress on Gulf
## Meanwhile, says he will order force if provoked 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The White
House pledged yesterday President Bush
will work closely with Congress on the Per
sian Gulf crisis but said he might be forced
to order military action on his own in the
event of "unforeseen kinds of provoca
tions."
White House press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater, addressing concerns raised by
Democratic lawmakers, said Bush will work
with Congress "every step of the way. We
have no intention of leaving Congress out."
Fitzwater added, "He will follow the con
stitutional requirements, and we would
want to consult with the Congress every
step of the way. But there are always those
unforeseen kinds of provocations that
might result in having to move first."
Congress needs to be involved in any
decision to fight, several congressional
Democrats said Sunday, several days after
Bush announced plans to nearly double the
230,000 troops in the Persian Gulf to pro
vide an "adequate offensive option."
"The last thing we need is to have a war
over there, a bloody war, and have Ameri
can boys being sent and brought back in
body bags and yet not have the American
people behind them," said Senate Armed
Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn,
D-Ga. "We've gone that route one time. We
don't need to do it again."
Without saying so directly, Fitzwater
suggested the Democrats were overreact
ing. "Not a shot's been fired. What are
these guys talking about?" he said.
Fitzwater added, "The Congress wants
to be vigilant and on top of this â€” urge cau
tion all the way, and that's appropriate."
"It's not for the president by himself to

decide whether or not to go to war," Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y. said
today. "He has to have the Congress with
him. That is the law."
"If George Bush wants his presidency to
die in the Arabian desert, he's going at it
very steadily and as if it were a plan,"
Moynihan said on ABC's "Good Morning
America."
"It's as if that great force that was cre
ated to fight the Cold War is at the presi
dent's own disposal for any diversion he
may wish, no matter what it costs. He will
wreck our military, he will wreck his admin
istration and he'll spoil a chance to get a
collective security system working. It
breaks the heart," Moynihan said.
Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., said Bush
"ought to have the broadest possible
achievable international consensus" before
launching an offensive.
"The decision to go to war ought to be a
shared responsibility, it ought not to be
made by one person, even if that person is
the president of the United States," Hamil
ton, a key House Foreign Relations Com
mittee member, said on NBC-TV's "Meet
the Press" program.
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, appearing on ABC-TV's "This
Week With David Brinkley," said Congress
must vote before America goes to war. And
Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Clai
borne Pell, D-R.1., said the United Nations
"should have some input" before U.S.
troops go into combat.
Nunn said Bush's new offensive posture
was at sharp odds with the original objec
tive of defending Saudi Arabia.
