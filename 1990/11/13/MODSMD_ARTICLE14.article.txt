# Experts predict Fed will cut interest rates

WASHINGTON (AP) - The Fed
eral Reserve, responding to increasing
signs of a recession, soon will cut inter
est rates in a move that should prompt
banks to lower a variety of consumer
and business rates, many private
economists predicted yesterday.
The Fed's credit easing is likely to
spur a one-half percentage point cut in
the prime lending rate, and home
mortgage rates should decline mod
estly as well, many analysts said.
Any reduction in the prime rate,
which has been stuck at 10 percent

since January, would be seen as a boost
to economic activity because about
one-third of all consumer and business
loans are tied to changes in the prime.
The Fed's top policy-making body,
the Federal Open Market Committee,
will meet behind closed doors today to
map interest rate strategy.
Many economists were forecasting
that Fed officials would, at the very
least, vote to lower the federal funds
rate, the interest banks charge each
other on overnight loans.
Some analysts were looking for an

even more dramatic signal that the Fed
was easing credit conditions in the
form of a cut in the Fed's discount
rate, the interest the Fed charges to
commercial banks.
There was less consensus on that
development, however. The Fed hasn't
reduced its discount rate, which now
stands at 7 percent, in more than four
years.
Instead, the central bank has been
concentrating on the federal funds
rate, an interest level the Fed can con
trol by deciding how much cash to sup

ply to the banking system.
The central bank trimmed the fed
eral funds rate from 8 percent to 7.75
percent less than two weeks ago as its
endorsement of the deficit-cutting
package that finally won congressional
approval.
Until recently, the Fed has been
reluctant to ease credit because of
fears the country was on the verge of
an inflationary spiral caused by the
jump in oil prices after Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait.
