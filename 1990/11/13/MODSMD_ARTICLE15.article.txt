# Violence erupts during student march

### 
PARIS (AP) â€” Hundreds of
masked youths battled police and
set 30 cars ablaze yesterday as
police in Paris blocked the route of
more than 100,000 students
demanding better conditions at
their high schools.
It was the worst violence in a
month of nationwide student
protests.
Riot police fired water cannons
and hundreds of rounds of tear
gas at demonstrators, who pelted
officers with rocks and bottles,
smashed windows and looted
stores.
Police headquarters said 104
officers were hurt, including 18
hospitalized. Police reported 52
arrests in Paris, and a dozen
youths arrested for vandalism
during a protest march in Mont
belaird, eastern France.
In all, about 100 vehicles were
damaged in Paris, police said.
About 150,000 students took
part in demonstrations elsewhere
in France.
President Francois Mitterrand
promised steps would be taken to
address student demands. They
want more government spending
to improve security, upgrade sub
standard facilities, modernize cur
ricula and hire more teachers.
The main throng of protesters
in Paris was orderly, but hundreds
of youths on the fringes ran wild.
Many rioters wore masks and car
ried clubs.
Journalists were beaten.
Mitterrand and Education
Minister Lionel Jospin met with a
delegation of student leaders and
promised an emergency plan in
response to demands for better
education and safety on campus.
Yesterday's march began at the
Place de la Bastille in eastern

Paris, where 201 years ago rioters
stormed the prison to start the
French Revolution. In the Mont
parnasse neighborhood of south
ern Paris, gangs started smashing
windows and robbing street ven
dors about two hours after the
march started.
Police Chief Pierre Verbrugghe,
who deployed 5,000 officers, told
students they would not be
allowed to follow their planned
route and finish their march on
the Champs Elysees.
Many students obeyed the
orders, but a few hundred youths
squared off against police at the
Alma bridge. Police fired water
cannons when they tried to cross,
scattering the rioters who hurled
rocks and trash.
The youths regrouped and
repeated attempts to break
through police line. Vandals set
fire to trash and dismantled bus
stops.
Jospin promised more discus
sions with student leaders today
and throughout the week, and
said such talks should be held on
the local level as well.
Organizers claimed 200,000
students joined the Paris march,
but other observers estimated the
turnout at closer to 100,000. It
was the first time students from
the provinces were urged to join a
march in the capital.
Those who couldn't come to
Paris staged their own protests in
dozens of smaller cities.
Dozens of previous student
marches and rallies across France
over the past four weeks have
been peaceful, except for sporadic
vandalism blamed by student
leaders on provocateurs.
On Nov. 5, an estimated
150,000 students participated in
marches nationwide.
