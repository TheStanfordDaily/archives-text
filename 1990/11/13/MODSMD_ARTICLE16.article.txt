# Conservative Party in turmoil over Thatcher
## 
### 
LONDON (AP) - Michael
Heseltine, a flamboyant former
defense secretary, has one day left
to decide whether to attempt the
once-unthinkable: ousting Mar
garet Thatcher as Conservative
Party leader and thus prime min
ister.
The crisis has thrown the
party's normally well-disciplined
legislators into turmoil. And sud
denly all bets are off.
With a mixture of behind-the

scenes threats, promises and
cajoling, Thatcher loyalists and
Heseltine supporters are taking
soundings, adding up pledges and
consulting crystal balls.
Some Heseltine supporters
claim they are within sight of the
159 votes needed to force a second
ballot among the 372 Conserva
tive legislators in the House of
Commons who elect the party
leader.
The leader of the party with a

majority in the 650-member Com
mons is automatically the prime
minister.
Thatcher's supporters are seiz
ing on everything from the Per
sian Gulf crisis to the sheer domi
nance of the woman who has led
the party for 15 years and put her
stamp on the nation through 11
years in power.
The nomination deadline is
noon Thursday and if there's a
challenger, a secret ballot will be

held Nov. 20. Under the rules,
Thatcher must get 50 percent of
the votes cast and be 15 percent
clear of the next placed to avoid a
runoff. If not, a second ballot with
more newcomers would be held a
week later.
Whatever happens, it promises
to be messy for the party.
Heseltine, 57, has stalked
Thatcher skillfully since quitting
her Cabinet in January 1986.
