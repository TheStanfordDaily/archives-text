# U.N. go-ahead needed to legitimate war acts
## 
### Jonathan Laden 
Now that elections are over,
George Bush is seeking a U.N.
mandate to go to war. Iraq's
occupation of Kuwait, the first
mEyor conflict of the post-Cold
War era, may well define the
way politics is conducted for
decades to come.

of Kuwait is now
more than three
months old, as is
the invited U.S.
occupation of

Saudi Arabia. The present stand
off cannot be sustained indefi
nitely.
All actions indicate the
United States is preparing for
war.
There are 238,000 U.S.
armed forces based along the
Saudi border. Late last week,
President Bush made known
his intention to send at least
100,000 more soldiers to join
the fray A force of 350,000
well-armed men represents
more than a deterrent of fur
ther aggression; it is sufficient
force to overrun a country.
If the United Nations gives
the go-ahead, that is precisely
what may happen. On the
other hand, Political Science
Prof. Kurt Gaubatz points out
that war is not a definite result.
"By sending forces, Bush is
[onlyl demonstrating commit
ment. His course of action is
the same whether he intends to
go to war or to bluff Hussein,"
Gaubatz said.
Secretary of State James
Baker 111 has just concluded
talks with the four other per
manent members of the U.N.
Security Council. He is
attempting to produce lan
guage permitting military
action which will pass through
the council.
For the United Nations, an
organization representing
diverse interests of the world's
countries, deciding to take any
action is an "enormously diffi
cult task," Gaubatz explained.
If the Security Council is
able to overcome its inertia and
act as more than a rubber

stamp for U.S. policy, the
United Nations will exert a
msgor influence in the Gulf.
For the first time in many
years, a superpower must
lobby the United Nations
before it pursues its foreign
affairs.

Were the United
States to unilateral
ly start a war, the
backlash of world
opinion would be
damaging.

The United States needs the
legitimization of a U.N. resolu
tion before taking military
action. Otherwise, it will be
impossible to maintain a
strong multinational coalition
against Hussein.
Maintaining the coalition is
a priority due to the financial
support the U.S. embargo and
deployment have received from
several nations.
A more critical factor is the
development of politics in the
post-Cold War era. The age of
two hostile camps, each under
the direction of a belligerent
superpower, has finally ended.
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait will
go down in history as the first
mtyor crisis of the new period.
At issue is whether politics
will continue to be business as
usual — the nation with the
greatest military might has
inordinate power — or whether
a new period of interdepen
dence and shared responsiblity
will develop.
Were the United States, the
lone surviving superpower, to
unilaterally start a war, the
backlash of world opinion
would be economically and
politically damaging. The
United States is somewhat
dependent on U.N. approval of
military action.
Perhaps with the end of the
Cold War, the era of a more
powerful United Nations has
finallv arrived.
