## The 						budget morass 
### 
Provost should seek
student input
before making cuts

Not too long ago,
Provost James Rosse
announced that a plan to
trim the University operating bud
get by $22 million was nearing
completion and that repositioning
efforts would produce a balanced
budget this year.
Now, however, there is appar
ently a $5 million gap in the budget
due to a lower volume of federally
sponsored research, a shortfall in
indirect cost recovery and a lower
payout rate on the University's
expendable funds pool.
Indirect costs are incurred dur
ing research and include such
items as operations and mainte
nance, library usage and adminis
trative expenses. Because of a
lower volume of federally spon
sored research, Stanford is going to
recover $2.5 million less in indirect
costs than originally expected.
In addition, because the govern
ment has established a 74 percent
provisional indirect cost rate for
Stanford during the current inves
tigations for wrongdoing while the
University used a rate of 78 per
cent in budgeting decisions, the
expected revenue is over-projected
by $1.2 million. - - â€¢
Obviotfsly, there is an urgent
need for more repositioning and
streamlining, and Rosse said a
decision on "one-time actions" to
take will be made late this week.
In the first phase of streamlin
ing, many administrators, staff
members and union workers were
laid off, while most student ser
vices were left untouched.
Now the fat has been skimmed
and it seems unlikely that student
services will escape the axe.

Assuming this is the case, it is
very important that Rosse allow a
period for comments and that he
meet with student leaders and
dorm representatives before decid
ing which cuts to make.
After all, it is a dilemma that is
facing the whole campus, and the
burden should not be shouldered
by just one department or adminis
trator.
Rosse should therefore extend
any final deadline for a few more
weeks, as it does not leave enough
time for the community to respond
and make careful recommenda
tions.
Such response has in the past
proved to be very powerful. For
example, proposals to cut Residen
tial Education funding and resi
dent computer clusters last year
were adamantly opposed by the
students. These protests presum
ably helped lead to the ultimate
defeat of the proposals.
In remarks to the Faculty Senate
last week, Rosse noted that he is
concerned about the state of the
national economy and the federal
government's commitment to pay
ing for research at private universi
ties.
And well he should be. With the
imminent recession, for example,
the University is going to earn an
estimated $1.4 million less from its
expendable funds pool (which con
sists of non-endowment invest
ments) because of a drop in the
payout rate from 8.6 to 7.6 percent.
With this and other fluctuations
making budget forecasting an
increasingly difficult process, it will
be as important as ever for the
administration to pay attention to
such variables, make conservative
income estimates and keep the
University community updated
about how national trends are
affecting Stanford's budget.
After all, Stanford is part of the
market economy and is not
immune to its ups and downs.
