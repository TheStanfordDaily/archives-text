## Living in a borderland 
### 
YOU STAND ON THE BORDER.
You look to one side, there are peo
ple who look like you but don't
speak your language; you look to the
other, and there are people who look
nothing like you, yet they speak your lan
guage. Frustration and anger grow as
each group makes demands on your iden
tity, and you ask yourself, which way
across the borderline?
An incident that occurred a few weeks
ago spurred me to do some thinking on
the answer to that question. Three of my
housemates and I headed down to La
Azteca to grab some dinner, and, when we
got there, one of them made a comment
about the incongruity of four white folks
being in that neighborhood.
It took a few seconds for any of us to
realize what was wrong with what he had
said, namely that we were not four white
folks but three white folks and a Chero
kee Indian folk.
The truly interesting thing, and ulti
mately the most perturbing, is that he
caught his mistake before I did. At first, I
took it as a bad sign, an indication that I
was allowing myself to be faded into white
culture at the expense of the culture of
my blood.
His labeling hadn't initially struck me
as inappropriate, whereas if he had said
four white guys, I would've immediately
commented that one of us was female. It
was only after a moment's thought that
the wrongness hit me.
In some sense, though, what he'd said
wasn't entirely wrong, because I live in a
borderland, a place where multiple per

spectives, different cultures and conflict
ing values come together in the form of a
person who finds himself existing at the
border which demarcates one world-view
from another.
My personal borderland springs from
the intersection of a number of worlds: a
Cherokee raised by a white family in an
overwhelmingly white community; a
small-town boy in the big city; a son of
parents and brother of sisters who never
went to college; a part of a predominantly
white circle of friends which is active in
the Native American community; a per
son who never realized that his family
was officially impoverished until he read
the government's definition of 'below
poverty level' and who now lives among
the wealth and abundance of an ivory
tower; a mqjor in a technical field whose
intellectual interests are driven by a fasci
nation with modern philosophy.
In the same way my upbringing
allowed me to let go unnoticed my house
mate's comment, these other borders
become blurred and ambiguous. But they
are always there.
For myself, the blurriness is some
times very negative, when it incapacitates
me and confuses others as to who I am
and where I'm coming from. It's like a tug
of war that never ends.
But many times it's positive. From a
vantage point in the borderland, one can
see many directions at once, notice things
that are hidden from view on one side or
the other. Fluent in the languages on all
sides, one can talk and argue and lament

with a variety of people without feeling
like (or being regarded as) an imposter or
a wanna-be.
The positive moments make me realize
that to give up on the tug of war would
require cutting off my arms and letting
them go with the rope â€” not an attractive
course of action.
It seems that the question of how to
cross the borderline is moot, because
there is no way of doing so. Exclusive
existence on either side of the line is an
impossibility, as stepping fully into one
requires forgetting the other. One might
as well try forgetting how to eat.
If that means that comments such as
'four white folks' take a moment to
bother me, then so be it. I take heart from
the knowledge that I have company here,
that there are borders for other people as
well, drawn at different points for differ
ent reasons.
I see such people often, and we talk
about what life's like, out on the border.

Jason Lewis would like to give a hearty
nod to the Chicana writer Gloria Anzal
dua, whose concept of the borderlands
provided much food for the thoughts in
this column.
