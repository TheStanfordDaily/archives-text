## Many factors contributed to the closure of Stanford's Tours program 
### 
Recent discussion in The
Daily about the Overseas Studies
programs in France suggests that
the nature of and the reasons for these
changes are not well understood.
Without going into all of the details of
what has been a complex decision, I
would like to answer a few key questions
regarding the closure of the program in
Tours and the opening of a new program
in Paris.
• How will the new Paris program
be structured academically?
Paris 2, as we are now calling it, will
accommodate 30 students each fall and
winter quarter. Participants will need the
equivalent of at least two quarters of
French, and may study in Paris for one
or two quarters.
The academic program will include
instruction in French at three levels, and
five courses in the humanities and social
sciences, the latter with an emphasis on
international relations, especially as
reflected in European and French politi
cal economy.
Courses (except French) will, with
rare exceptions, be taught in English by
faculty chosen from Parisian institutions
of higher education, with one course
each quarter by Stanford's resident
director, and one each quarter by a visit
ing Stanford professor.
• Where will the Paris 2 program
be located?
Classrooms, a library, a gymnasium,
the program office, some study space and
access to computers will be at the Ecole
Superieur de Commerce de Paris (ESCP)
on Avenue de la R£publique. Stanford
students will be registered at ESCP so
they will have access to that school's
facilities; a few ESCP students may also
take courses from the Stanford curricu
lum.
• What will the living arrange
ments for Paris 2 students be?
Paris 1 will continue with little
change: 20 students who have studied

1 French for at least two years will spend
fall and winter quarters taking courses
in one of several Parisian institutions of
higher education.
Paris 1 students will be permitted to
take at most one course from the Paris 2
curriculum, as in the past they have
been able to take a course taught by the
visiting Stanford professor if they chose
to do so.
Their living and eating arrangements
will be the same as they always have
been, which is just like those for Paris 2
students. Paris 1 will be located adminis
tratively with Paris 2 at ESCE
• Was the decision to close the
Tours program in favor of Paris 2
made on financial or programmatic
grounds?
There is no one-word answer to this
question, because both financial and pro
grammatic considerations went into the
decision. Overseas Studies' budget
reduction target of last spring was met
without the closure of Tours. Longer
range planning, on the other hand,
clearly pointed to the need for a meyor

Paris offers vastly
greater cultural and
intellectual resources
upon which Stanford's
academic programs
can draw.

reallocation within the Overseas Studies
budget, in order to deal with currently
underfunded programs, reductions in
administrative staffing and the desire to
be able to respond to future opportuni
ties in new places.
After careful consideration, it was
decided that this reallocation could best
be achieved through a reduction in the
number of student-quarters in France
from 140 to 100. This was financially
motivated.

The decision to close the Tours pro
gram and open Paris 2, however, was a
programmatic one. The option of main
taining a program in Tours in collabora
tion with Carnegie-Mellon University
was also available. Choosing between
these alternatives was a judgment call.
The final decision was based on sev
eral factors, the most important of which
was that Paris offers vastly greater cul
tural and intellectual resources upon
which Stanford's academic programs can
draw.
• How was this decision reached?
Various groups were consulted,
including, in particular, the Overseas
Studies staff, the Overseas Studies Pro
gram Committee, and the faculty of the
Department of French. The many let
ters, calls and petitions from members of
the Stanford community were also taken
into consideration.
The process of arriving at this deci
sion involved about half a year of infor
mation gathering and consultation, cul
minating in a recommendation for the
plan described above from Dean Ewart
Thomas of the School of Humanities and
Sciences to Provost James Rosse, who
has accepted the recommendation.
I hope these brief remarks help to
clear up some of the misconceptions
regarding the upcoming changes in Stan
ford's programs in France.

Courses (except French) will, with
rare exceptions, be taught in English by
faculty chosen from Parisian institutions
of higher education, with one course
each quarter by Stanford's resident
director, and one each quarter by a visit
ing Stanford professor.
• Where will the Paris 2 program
be located?
Classrooms, a library, a gymnasium,
the program office, some study space and
access to computers will be at the Ecole
Superieur de Commerce de Paris (ESCP)
on Avenue de la R£publique. Stanford
students will be registered at ESCP so
they will have access to that school's
facilities; a few ESCP students may also
take courses from the Stanford curricu
lum.
• What will the living arrange
ments for Paris 2 students be?
Paris 1 will continue with little
change: 20 students who have studied

1 French for at least two years will spend
fall and winter quarters taking courses
in one of several Parisian institutions of
higher education.
Paris 1 students will be permitted to
take at most one course from the Paris 2
curriculum, as in the past they have
been able to take a course taught by the
visiting Stanford professor if they chose
to do so.
Their living and eating arrangements
will be the same as they always have
been, which is just like those for Paris 2
students. Paris 1 will be located adminis
tratively with Paris 2 at ESCE
• Was the decision to close the
Tours program in favor of Paris 2
made on financial or programmatic
grounds?
There is no one-word answer to this
question, because both financial and pro
grammatic considerations went into the
decision. Overseas Studies' budget
reduction target of last spring was met
without the closure of Tours. Longer
range planning, on the other hand,
clearly pointed to the need for a meyor

can draw.

reallocation within the Overseas Studies
budget, in order to deal with currently
underfunded programs, reductions in
administrative staffing and the desire to
be able to respond to future opportuni
ties in new places.
After careful consideration, it was
decided that this reallocation could best
be achieved through a reduction in the
number of student-quarters in France
from 140 to 100. This was financially
motivated.

The decision to close the Tours pro
gram and open Paris 2, however, was a
programmatic one. The option of main
taining a program in Tours in collabora
tion with Carnegie-Mellon University
was also available. Choosing between
these alternatives was a judgment call.
The final decision was based on sev
eral factors, the most important of which
was that Paris offers vastly greater cul
tural and intellectual resources upon
which Stanford's academic programs can
draw.
• How was this decision reached?
Various groups were consulted,
including, in particular, the Overseas
Studies staff, the Overseas Studies Pro
gram Committee, and the faculty of the
Department of French. The many let
ters, calls and petitions from members of
the Stanford community were also taken
into consideration.
The process of arriving at this deci
sion involved about half a year of infor
mation gathering and consultation, cul
minating in a recommendation for the
plan described above from Dean Ewart
Thomas of the School of Humanities and
Sciences to Provost James Rosse, who
has accepted the recommendation.
I hope these brief remarks help to
clear up some of the misconceptions
regarding the upcoming changes in Stan
ford's programs in France.
