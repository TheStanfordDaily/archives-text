### In Praise of the Stepmother By Mario Vargas Llosa Farrar Straus Giroux, $18.95, 149 pages 
Reviewed by Megan Merriman
"That is always the way it is: though fantasy
and truth have one and the same heart, their
faces are like day and night, like fire and
water."
And so it is in"In Praise of the Step
mother," an intriguing and disturbing tale of
innocence and corruption. In this his latest
novel, Peruvian author Mario Vargas Llosa
intricately weaves elements of fantasy and
reality, challenging conventional appearances
and perceptions and exploring the limits of
passion, pleasure and perversity.
The "reality" of the novel is the story of its
three main characters: widower Don Rigob

erto, his beautiful new wife Lucrecia and little
Alfonso, Don Rigoberto's angelic young son
from his previous marriage.
Lucrecia's attempts to win the affection of
her new stepson and Alfonso's own mis
chievous desires soon lead to the illicit sexual
relationship between them that becomes the
focus of the plot. Yet this story occupies only
half of the book.
The remainder of the novel is the "fantasy,"
in the form of chapters devoted to the charac
ters' private thoughts and desires. Each of
these sections is accompanied by an illustra
tion, intended to represent some of the paint
ings and drawings in Don Rigoberto's secret
collection of erotica.
The figures in these works by Titian,
Boucher and others serve as the basis for the
fantasies of the book's protagonists. Thus Don
Rigoberto becomes Candaules, King of Lydia,

while Lucrecia becomes the goddess Diana.
Throughout the novel, Vargas Llosa ques
tions traditional concepts and beliefs. For
example, he presents an unconventional, per
haps even irreverent image of religion. The
sacred images of the church — its rituals, its
music, even its Holy Trinity — are here associ
ated not with the divine, but with humanity.
They are invoked not in traditional set
tings, but rather in a sexual context, and they
are associated not with traditional Christian
values but with "sinful" qualities such as pride
and lust.
One of the final chapters of the book is par
ticularly interesting in its treatment of reli
gion, although this section seems to have little
direct relation to the rest of the story. The seg
ment presents the human side of the Virgin
Mary, as she confides the doubts and insecuri
ties she develops upon learning that she is to
be God's chosen one.
As he does with the main characters of the
novel, Vargas Llosa portrays Mary as a real
person, one who is subject to the powerful
forces of human emotion.
The author describes the dynamic relation
ships among the characters with vivid sensual
images and erotic prose, combining the two to
form what he refers to as "poetry of the body."
This intense sensuality is occasionally
taken to an extreme where it borders on
bizarre obsession, as in the case of Don Rigob
erto's daily rituals of meticulously cleaning
and purifying his body.
The elaborate imagery is complimented by a
number of creative literary techniques which
together create a multidimensional novel. Var
gas Llosa's characteristic use of multiple per
spectives and points of view, as well as his
shifts in time and space, give the work its rich
texture.
Although the author provides some subtle
connections between the various elements of
his story, the task of making the necessary
associations belongs, in reality, to the reader.
After a suspenseful climax and a revealing
ending, it is again the reader who is left to
decide the outcome of the novel, who is asked
to go beyond appearances and answer the
questions of guilt and innocence. It is the
reader who must determine, in terms of truth
and fantasy, if it is night or day, dawn or dusk.
In this way "In Praise of the Stepmother"
becomes more than an erotic tale of deception
and manipulation. Although the novel is
indeed such a tale, it is also an engaging and
provocative inquiry into human nature.
