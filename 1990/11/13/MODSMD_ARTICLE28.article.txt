Reviews by Rohan Sippy
The Epicurean Laboratory
By Tina Seelig
W.H. Freeman, $15.95, illus
trated, 157 pages
Tina Seelig's book is appropri
ately subtitled "Exploring the Sci
ence of Cooking," and she sets
about doing just that. She equates
the chef in the kitchen to the sci
entist in the laboratory, and
approaches food and cooking from
that angle.
Seelig received her doctorate in
neuroscience from Stanford, and
in her book she has managed to
blend the technical and practical
aspects of cooking together in a
readable manner.
Seelig analyzes various foods,
such as eggs, milk and tea, among
many others. She explains where
the products come from, and
explains features about the food,
from why popcorn pops to how
coffee beans get their flavor.
The book also contains 22
interesting recipes, from pumpkin
ice cream and wine-poached pears
to salmon mousse and shish
kebab. There are illustrations on
almost every page by Nancy Ser
piello.
Federico Garcia Lorca: A Life
By Ian Gibson
Pantheon, $15.95, 472 pages
This detailed biography of one
of the most popular poets and
playwrights was initially released
a year ago, and it is now available
in paperback form.
Ian Gibson wrote the book over
the course of about 8 years, with
the first manuscript appearing in
Spanish. It was later translated
into English.
The book recounts at length

the incidents and events that
made up Lorca's life and art. Gib
son is the author of another book
about the poet, "The Death of
Lorca," and he demonstrates his
exhaustive knowledge and love for
his subject.
It is a biography that would
interest the avid Lorca fan, as
Gibson includes details about his
life in university and school, and
the difficulty of living in a society
that was intolerant toward his
homosexuality.
