"The colonel managed to get to sleep
but woke up a moment later, alarmed by
his intestines. . . . Wrapped in a wool
blanket up to his ears, he tried to find the
leak in the darkness. A trickle of cold
sweat slipped down his spine. He had a
fever. He felt as if he were floating in con
centric circles inside a tank of jelly."
— "No One Writes to the Colonel"
"Collected Novellas" is made up of
three of Gabriel Garcia Marquez's best
known shorter works — "Leaf Storm,"
*'No One Writes to the Colonel" and
"Chronicle of a Death Foretold."
The three works span a large period of

time. "Leaf Storm" is the earliest in the
collection, written in 1955, while "Chron
icle of a Death Foretold," the most recent,
was written in 1983.
The collection is a showcase of Mar
quez's remarkable talent as a writer. In
each of the stories, he is able to create a
world that is only believable because of
the way he has managed to record it.
"No One Writes to the Colonel" was
translated by J.S. Bernstein, and this is
probably one of Marquez's best known
short stories. The old colonel makes refer
ence to an Aureliano Buendia, invoking
the character from "Leaf Storm" and
"One Hundred Years of Solitude," one of
Marquez's most powerful novels.
There is a quality of timelessness to
the stories, where the reader gets
involved in a sense of animated suspen
sion. Marquez is able to manipulate the

time frame and reality beautifully, and he
always retains control over his story.
Gregory Rabassa translated "Chroni
cle of a Death Foretold," a tale that moves
towards its conclusion as both the author
and reader seem to be trying to piece
together some understanding of the story.
Marquez manages to establish an eerie
sense of prescience around the story, even
from the beginning. Throughout, Mar
quez is always shifting his temporal per
spective, moving his point of view by as
much as 27 years. This serves to unsettle
the reader, as it is impossible to get a firm
grip on the situation.
The story comes to us almost as if we
were there, trying to assimilate the
events from a variety of sources. And
most of them are intriguing characters of
the town. There was Divina Flor, whom
the victim Santiago Nasar was attempt

ing to seduce, the twins Pedro and Pablo
Vicario, who are trying to avenge their
sister's loss of innocence, and a host of
other fascinating witnesses.
Rabassa also translated "Leaf Storm,"
a story that combines the various per
spectives of its main personalities. It also
reflects one of the outstanding aspects of
Marquez's writing — his unique
approach to death.
His ideas about dying are articulated
in several of his other short stories, and in
this one he begins by presenting yet
another view.
"I always thought that dead people
should have a hat on. Now I see that they
shouldn't. ... I thought that a dead man
would look like somebody quiet and
asleep and now 1 can see that it's just the
opposite. I can see that he looks like some
one awake and and in a rage after a

fight."
All three stories are set in classic Mar
quez territory — that fictitious region of
Latin America where time has no mean
ing in its conventional sense, but is
merely another parameter that the
author exploits to the fullest.
The collection is worth acquiring,
either for the aficionado as an assembly of
some of Marquez's finest shortest works,
or even for those unfamiliar with the
Nobel laureate's writings.
This will be a great introduction to the
style and content of much of his other
books, and the only negative question
that this could beg is, "Could he have
written anything better?" Read some
more and find out.
