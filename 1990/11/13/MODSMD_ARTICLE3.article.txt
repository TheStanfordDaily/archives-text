# Ye Olde Safer Sex Shoppe to reopen
## 
### Joi Spencer 
Stanford, traditionally
known for its lack of student
dating, may not seem like a
conducive atmosphere for Ye
Olde Safer Sex Shoppe.
Even Daniel Bao, founder of
the contraceptive vending
establishment while a student
here, admitted the creation of
the shop was not due to stu
dent demand. "We're educa
tors, not businessmen," Bao
said. "We're not here to make a
profit."
As a supply source or an
educational resource, however,
the shop has been unrespon
sive to Stanford student needs
this year, remaining closed
since Bao's graduation. How
ever, volunteers from Project
Student AIDS Volunteer Edu
cators have recently made
plans to reopen the doors of the
dormant establishment.
Freshman volunteer Rachel
Maddow said she was inter
ested in helping run the shop
because, "If the things we

preach about are not available,
it does no good," Maddow said.
Bao will come back to Stan
ford this quarter to train the
volunteers to operate the shop
properly. "We need a few good
people," Bao said. "It's hard to
find people who are not funny
about the subject."
The shop was originally
developed in 1985 by the Gay
and Lesbian Alliance at Stan
ford through the AIDS Educa
tion Project. GLAS sought a
way to make condoms more
readily available to students.
Although condoms and
other contraceptives were
available at Cowell Student
Health Center, the shop,
located in the Old Fire House,
strove for a more relaxed, com
fortable environment than at
Cowell,
According to Bao, former
treasurer of GLAS, the shop
was initiated in order to pro
vide a resource for students to
purchase contraceptives, lubri
cants and other safe-sex products
at low costs. Known for his see
through, safer-sex briefcase full
of contraceptive paraphernalia,
Bao was dedicated to educating
students about AIDS and other
sexually transmitted diseases.
Because the shop was subsi
dized by GLAS, the cost of con
doms ranged between ten and 25
cents. More than 25 different
types of condoms were available,
representing a range of textures,
styles and colors. Safer-sex kits,
which Bao specially designed for
different individuals' needs, were
also available.
Bao would also hold "rubber
ware" parties frequently. These
events were used to display the
assortment of condoms and safer
sex products available to stu
dents.

'We need a few good
people. It's hard to
find people who are
not funny about the
subject.'

During the rubberware par
ties, Bao tried to make students
comfortable with the discussion
by presenting contraceptive infor
mation in a serious tone, in order
to educate them on the use of con
traceptives. At the end of the rub
berware parties, an assortment of
free samples was available.
Bao said that most people are
uncomfortable about contracep
tives primarily because they are
ignorant about the varieties avail
able to them and their proper
usage. Restoring the shop is
imperative, Bao said, because
"winter break seems to be a much
needed time for contraceptives."
