## Cardinal opens season tonight 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
Five starters back. Six other letter
winners returning on the bench. Third
place in a preseason poll of Pacific 10
Conference coaches.
In all, the Stanford men's basketball
team has good reason to be optimistic as
it opens its season tonight at home
against the Illawarra (Australia)
Hawks. With virtually everyone back
from last year's 18-12 squad — only
backup center Derek Bruton is gone —
the Cardinal may have the talent to
return to the NCAA tournament after
only a one-year (as opposed to the cus
tomary 47-year) hiatus.
"We think we can make it to NCAAs,"
junior center Adam Keefe said. "It's not
by any means a lock, but it's definitely a
reachable goal for us. Last year it was a
long shot."
"I think we can be real good, because
I've seen us be real good," coach Mike
Montgomery said. "The NCAA tourna
ment is realistic, and certainly has to be
a goal of ours. I'm assuming improve
ment from the team that won 18 games.
"What we don't know is how vulner
able we are to the thingß that hurt us,"
Montgomery continued. "Our problem
is consistency: Night after night, can we
handle what they throw at us? ... We
need to get better if we want to move up.
We were like two different teams at
times last year."
The better half of those two teams
had some outstanding defensive num
bers by the end of the year: The Cardi
nal led the Pac-10 in scoring defense,
allowing 63.7 points per game; held
opponents to a shooting percentage of
.441, second in the league; and outre
bounded opponents by an average of 6.1
per game, more than anyone else in the
conference.
Throw in a year's experience — and
improvement — and you're looking at a
decent season for this year's model.
"We're definitely better than we were at
this time last year," Keefe said. "People
have improved individually: We're more
mature, and better mentally."
Good enough for third in the Pac-10,
behind consensus favorite Arizona and
ever-underachieving UCLA? "I think we
can be (that good)," senior forward
Andrew Vlahov said. "We need to keep
working together, chemistry-wise. You
can always work on your defense and fit
ness: those are the easy things. The

hard thing is chemistry, and that only
comes through games."
"There's no doubt in my mind we're
better than last year," Keefe said.
"We've had our up and down days, but
for the most part we've made good
progress."
The progress will have to continue,
however. "We've got five starters
returning, but I'm not satisfied that the
things we didn't do well (last year) are
changing," Montgomery said. "We have
to do things better.
"Our passing has to improve," Mont
gomery continued. "When we've got
guys open inside we've got to get the ball
there and on time. That's not happening
right now."
When it does happen, the ball will
usually be headed for the 6-foot-9 Keefe,
a Sporting News Honorable Mention
All-America last year. "He's an
upgraded version of Adam Keefe, and
that's nice to have," Montgomery said.
"Nice" indeed: Last year's "non
upgraded version" scored 20 points a
game (third in the league), grabbed 9.1
boards per game (tied for first),
attempted and made more free throws
than anyone in school history (179-for
-247), shot .627 (third-best in school his
tory) and scored 599 points (No. 8 on
the all-time list).
Mr. Upgrade split time between
power forward and center last year, but
he'll start this season playing mostly
center. "It'll be almost identical to what
I was playing at the end of last year,"
Keefe said. "I'm comfortable with it, but
it's not my favorite spot. I like to get out
a ways from the basket and get a little
space."
No matter where he plays, Keefe will
be attracting a lot of attention from
opposing defenses — which will give the
other Cardinal players room to maneu
ver. "He's just more efficient at what he
does best," Montgomery said. "Adam
will be the focal point, and everyone will
get better because of him."
Seniors Deshon Wingate and Vlahov
will join Keefe in the frontcourt. The
sometimes-spectacular Wingate was the
team's second-leading scorer last year at
10 ppg, but was bothered by inconsis
tency. "Deshon has to be a factor this
year," Montgomery said. "On the road
he wasn't as efficient — he'd play on
emotion a lot of times, have the crowd
help him out (at home) — and on the
road he's got to play the way he's capa
ble of playing.
"Both he and Vlahov have to give us
more on a consistent basis, because last
year there were times when we just
couldn't score," Montgomery said. "If
there's 20 points available they've got to
go out and get it every time, not just
once a month."
Vlahov, starting at power forward,
will assume his customary role as a
defensive bruiser/banger/mauler. Vla
hov averaged 6.6 rebounds a game last
year, second on the team . . . and led the
squad with 87 personal fouls and five
disqualifications.
Vlahov may shift at times to small
forward, and Keefe to power forward,

depending on the play of reserves Lang
Meyer, Jim Morgan, Paul Garrett, Jason
Weaver, Brent Williams and freshman
Nick Ravn. "I'd like to know who's
going to back up our front line, but that
probably won't happen until January,"
Montgomery said. "Every day a differ
ent guy comes a10ng....

'I think we can be real
good, because I've seen
us be real good. The
NCAA tournament Is real
istic.'

"I'd like to be able to bring in Lang or
Jim at 5, then move Keefe to 4 and Vla
hov to 3," Montgomery said. "If we
could play that way that'd be to our
advantage. Right now I just don't know
which (bench) guy is the best player."
Montgomery has just as many deci
sions to make in the backcourt, even
with senior starters John Patrick (7.7
ppg, 3.8 assists per game) and Kenny
Ammann (9.3 ppg, 47-for-102 beyond
the three-point line) returning. "I've got
six guards, and it's no secret that you
can't play six guards and get them all
quality minutes," Montgomery said.
Those six include sophomores Mar
cus Loilie, who saw extensive action in
the last nine games of last season;
Kenny Hicks —"Defensively he's as
good as anybody," Montgomery says;
and Peter Dukes — "He's the smartest
at knowing when the ball should be
delivered."
Freshman Bobby Patton, who was
named "Mr. Basketball" for the state of
Ohio last year, is also challenging for
playing time. The 6-foot point guard
"probably has the best range of any of
our perimeter players," Montgomery
said. "He can shoot from 24 feet and it's
not really an effort. ... I think he'll
improve a lot as the season goes along."
With the competition between the
seven guards (including reserve Mike
Morris, a redshirt freshman), Mont
gomery will need each and every presea
son game to figure out who works best
with whom. "The question is what
group of guys will give me diversity if I
want to make a change," he said. "Right
now we're looking for combinations. It
will hopefully evolve; hopefully I'm
smart enough to find the right combina
tions."
The starting combination, however,
will once again be Patrick at the point
and Ammann at shooting guard. "We
need to see Patrick and Ammann have
better years than last year," Mont
gomery said. "If those two guys are
shooting the ball in — the way they did
at times last year — then we're tough."
The Cardinal plays another exhibi
tion at home Friday against High Five
America before opening the regular sea
son in the Stanford Invitational over
Thanksgiving break.

The Stanford Cardinal begins the drive for a fourth consecutive postseason berth
tonight against the lllawarra Hawks in Maples Pavilion. The team expects to rely
heavily on the play of 6-foot-9 power forward Adam Keefe, an all-Pac-10 selection
last year.
