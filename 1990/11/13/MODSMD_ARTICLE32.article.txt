### Gretchen Atwood Staff writer 
"At one point 1 remember
standing, waiting to return serve
and I said to myself, 'This is it.
Whitlinger's back!'"
Teri Whitlinger proved her
words yesterday in the Rolex
Regional finals by steamrolling
No. 1 seed Emilie Viqueira 6-1,6-
3. The final capped a tremendous
tournament for Whitlinger, who
won all six of her matches without
dropping a set.
"I felt like I finally got my game
together," said Whitlinger. "I just
decided that I'd start to go for it
and stop worrying about losing so
much."
Whitlinger stormed out of the
gates winning eight of the first
nine points against the California
baseliner. She rolled the rest of
the set, losing just one game.
"At the beginning I played very
aggressively. I was hitting hard,
hitting the corner and following it
in. I was really flowing,"
Whitlinger said.
"She just played great," said
Stanford asst. coach Lele Forood.
"Emilie was not up to Emilie's
level in the first set either."
"Teri started really on," agreed
Cal coach Jan Brogan, "Emilie
starts too slow. She has a habit of
knowing she can work her way
into the match. But when you're
playing against a top-10 player it
doesn't work."
Whitlinger jumped out to a
quick lead in the second set but
could not hold it. "At about 4-11
started looking around in the
stands and I was thinking 'I got
this in the pocket.' That's when
ahe took advantage of it," said
Whitlinger. "She was a little more
aggressive and started putting
pressure on me."
The pressure worked as
Viqueira broke Whitlinger's serve
and pulled to 4-3. "Emilie's the
' kind of player who sneaks up on

you. The longer you're in a match
with her the better she gets. The
points get longer and longer and
all of a sudden she's closing the
gap," said Forood.
Whitlinger was able to mix up
her game a bit and regain control.
"I thought if I could keep her
on her toes, hit some slices and
some drops then she wouldn't be
able to stay in a rhythm," said
Whitlinger, "It would give me a lit
tle bit of a breather, too."
Whitlinger broke Viqueira and
served out the set.
"At 4-3 I just sat down and said
you've got to get this together. So
I did," said Whitlinger.
The victory was especially
sweet for Whitlinger after her per
formance in the All-American

Championships a month ago.
"The All-American was rough for
me because I hadn't played any
matches since the NCAAs," said
Whitlinger. "I went to summer
school this summer and I didn't
play a heck of a lot of tennis. In
the All-American I lost to some
one I probably shouldn't have. I
felt like I had no confidence. This
is a great moral victory for me."
"Teri Whitlinger is one of the
players that I'm really proud of at
Stanford because she exudes that
Stanford spirit and mentality,"
said Cardinal coach Frank Bren
nan, "She is a tremendous com
petitor. She will not give up a
point. If I had six of her I'd win
the national championship every
year."

Unfortunately, Whitlinget's
domination in the singles final
was not copied in the doubles
final. The No. 4-seeded pair of
Heather Willens and Emma
Woodhouse fell to Cal's tandem of
Tiffiny Silveria and Sara May
nard.
The match began with five con
secutive service breaks. Silveria
and Maynard mixed up their game
and won three of the next four
games to take the set, 6-3. "They
were more offensive on serve and
return. Their variation on serve
was important," said Brogan,
"Using variation on service return
is probably the key to breaking
serve."

Freshman Emma Woodhouaa teamed with Heather Wlllena to reach the flnala of the Rotex Regional
Champlonahlpa at the Stanford Ifennla Stadium over the weekend. Yesterday, however, their winning
ways finally ended In the tournament's championship match.
Silveria and Maynard also
switched formations occasionally
to throw off the Stanford duo.
"Willens has a great crosscourt
backhand return that's low. She
hits it 'on' all the time," said Sil

veria. "At least this makes her hit
down the line."
In the second set both teams
broke serve once to knot the score
at 4-4. Willens and Woodhouse
then broke Maynard's serve. But
they squandered a set point in the
next game and eventually lost the
set in a tiebrcak 7-6 (7-4).
"I was pleased with their play,"
said Brennan. "They have not

played much together and they
did very well to get to the final."
He went on to say that timing was
a problem.
"They would get up 30-0 or 40-
15 and then play three sloppy
points and lose their momentum
each game," said Brennan, "They
have a lot of confidence in each
other but they have to help each
other more on the serve and be

more aggressive."
Brennan also gave credit to the
Cal tandem. "They realized our
returns were popping up a little
bit and they took advantage of it,"
said Brennan. "They had some
really key lobs that were within
four inches of the baseline.
Besides being good they were
lucky and that's a hard combina
tion to beat."

the All-American I lost to some
one I probably shouldn't have. I
felt like I had no confidence. This
is a great moral victory for me."
"Teri Whitlinger is one of the
players that I'm really proud of at
Stanford because she exudes that
Stanford spirit and mentality,"
said Cardinal coach Frank Bren
nan, "She is a tremendous com
petitor. She will not give up a
point. If I had six of her I'd win
the national championship every
year."

Unfortunately, Whitlinget's
domination in the singles final
was not copied in the doubles
final. The No. 4-seeded pair of
Heather Willens and Emma
Woodhouse fell to Cal's tandem of
Tiffiny Silveria and Sara May
nard.
The match began with five con
secutive service breaks. Silveria
and Maynard mixed up their game
and won three of the next four
games to take the set, 6-3. "They
were more offensive on serve and
return. Their variation on serve
was important," said Brogan,
"Using variation on service return
is probably the key to breaking
serve."

Freshman Emma Woodhouaa teamed with Heather Wlllena to reach the flnala of the Rotex Regional
Champlonahlpa at the Stanford Ifennla Stadium over the weekend. Yesterday, however, their winning
ways finally ended In the tournament's championship match.
Silveria and Maynard also
switched formations occasionally
to throw off the Stanford duo.
"Willens has a great crosscourt
backhand return that's low. She
hits it 'on' all the time," said Sil

veria. "At least this makes her hit
down the line."
In the second set both teams
broke serve once to knot the score
at 4-4. Willens and Woodhouse
then broke Maynard's serve. But
they squandered a set point in the
next game and eventually lost the
set in a tiebrcak 7-6 (7-4).
"I was pleased with their play,"
said Brennan. "They have not

played much together and they
did very well to get to the final."
He went on to say that timing was
a problem.
"They would get up 30-0 or 40-
15 and then play three sloppy
points and lose their momentum
each game," said Brennan, "They
have a lot of confidence in each
other but they have to help each
other more on the serve and be

more aggressive."
Brennan also gave credit to the
Cal tandem. "They realized our
returns were popping up a little
bit and they took advantage of it,"
said Brennan. "They had some
really key lobs that were within
four inches of the baseline.
Besides being good they were
lucky and that's a hard combina
tion to beat."
"At one point 1 remember
standing, waiting to return serve
and I said to myself, 'This is it.
Whitlinger's back!'"
Teri Whitlinger proved her
words yesterday in the Rolex
Regional finals by steamrolling
No. 1 seed Emilie Viqueira 6-1,6-
3. The final capped a tremendous
tournament for Whitlinger, who
won all six of her matches without
dropping a set.
"I felt like I finally got my game
together," said Whitlinger. "I just
decided that I'd start to go for it
and stop worrying about losing so
much."
Whitlinger stormed out of the
gates winning eight of the first
nine points against the California
baseliner. She rolled the rest of
the set, losing just one game.
"At the beginning I played very
aggressively. I was hitting hard,
hitting the corner and following it
in. I was really flowing,"
Whitlinger said.
"She just played great," said
Stanford asst. coach Lele Forood.
"Emilie was not up to Emilie's
level in the first set either."
"Teri started really on," agreed
Cal coach Jan Brogan, "Emilie
starts too slow. She has a habit of
knowing she can work her way
into the match. But when you're
playing against a top-10 player it
doesn't work."
Whitlinger jumped out to a
quick lead in the second set but
could not hold it. "At about 4-11
started looking around in the
stands and I was thinking 'I got
this in the pocket.' That's when
ahe took advantage of it," said
Whitlinger. "She was a little more
aggressive and started putting
pressure on me."
The pressure worked as
Viqueira broke Whitlinger's serve
and pulled to 4-3. "Emilie's the
' kind of player who sneaks up on

you. The longer you're in a match
with her the better she gets. The
points get longer and longer and
all of a sudden she's closing the
gap," said Forood.
Whitlinger was able to mix up
her game a bit and regain control.
"I thought if I could keep her
on her toes, hit some slices and
some drops then she wouldn't be
able to stay in a rhythm," said
Whitlinger, "It would give me a lit
tle bit of a breather, too."
Whitlinger broke Viqueira and
served out the set.
"At 4-3 I just sat down and said
you've got to get this together. So
I did," said Whitlinger.
The victory was especially
sweet for Whitlinger after her per
formance in the All-American

Championships a month ago.
"The All-American was rough for
me because I hadn't played any
matches since the NCAAs," said
Whitlinger. "I went to summer
school this summer and I didn't
play a heck of a lot of tennis. In
the All-American I lost to some
one I probably shouldn't have. I
felt like I had no confidence. This
is a great moral victory for me."
