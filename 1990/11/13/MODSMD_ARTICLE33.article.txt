# Underdog Card a clear favorite

Uh-oh. Somethin' screwy's
a-comin', and there ain't
nuthin' we can do about
it. You can feel it in the air, you
can see it in the trees, you can
smell it in White Plaza (no,
wait, it always smells like that):
It's that special week again.
Thanksgiving is just around
the corner, and college football
teams everywhere are prepar
ing to take on their archrivals.
It's a one-game season.
You've heard of all the huge,
age-old matchups: Nebraska-
Oklahoma, Pitt-Penn State
(GO PITT!!!), USC-UCLA,
Harvard-Yale, Slippery Rock-
Lock Haven (look it up)
Wait, am I missing some
thing'? Let's see ... oh yeah,
that thing they have out here.
What's it called? The (Not Usu
ally Very) Big Game?
Now, before I get lynched,
let's keep in mind that I'm
from the East Coast, and most
folks there could give a flying
you-know-what about a game
between Stanford and Cal. I
can just hear a steelworker
watching the news: "Big
Game? My word, isn't that just
a wee bit presumptuous on the
part of those fellows?" Or
something to that effect.
Let's be honest: Outside of
the Bay Area, this rivalry just
isn't big news. In fact, the first
time I even heard about Big
Game was one afternoon in
November, 1982. I was in
eighth grade, had probably just
finished watching Penn State
crush Pitt on the way to the
national title (I've come to
grips with it, thanks for asking)
when I saw a highlight show.
The first thing they showed

was a kickoff return. It seems
the guys in white had just
kicked a field goal to go up with
only a few seconds left. The
guys in blue received the kick
off.. . threw a few laterals .. .
ran over a silly looking trom
bone player . . . and won the
game.

I loved it.
Of course, I was way too
young to realize that the guys
in blue were supposed to be vil
lains, while the guys in white
were supposed to win. I was too
young too realize that a Play as
miraculous as that could only
be eryoyable if you happened to
be wearing the right colors.
I guess I was just stupid.
Anyway, my second reaction
was "Where the $@%&*#!?&
do they get off calling it Big
Game?" And, eight years later,
I still don't know.
Why the pessimism, you
ask? Oh, pipe down.
I'm just being realistic.
Let's play a little game: When
was the last time Big Game fea
tured two teams that actually
had winning records? Wrong.
Keep going. There you go:
1979.


Cameron
Macky
You remember 1979. Disco was
still in. A Democrat was in the
White House.
Andy Gibb was a star.
In fact, the only reason Cal had
a winning record that year was
that Oregon had to forfeit a win
because of an ineligible player.
Without that forfeit Cal would
have been 5-5, and we'd have to go
back to 1978 to find a game
between two half-decent teams.
A long and storied tradition,
indeed. I found myself wondering
if the game had ever been worth
watching, so I decided to go back
through the teams' records of the
last 21 seasons to see if there was
any sort of pattern. Why 21 sea
sons? Well, (1) I was born in late
1968, and (2) I'm a white middle
class male, which means the only
history that matters to me is the
history that I've been a part of.
Let's take a look. Hey! Both
Stanford and Cal had winning
records in 1969! As for 1970, well,
no. Two good teams again in '71,

and '75, and '77, '78 and '79. Six
of the first 11 years isn't bad.
Since then, though, it's been
Stink City.
There was something else I
noticed, and it gave me a glimmer
of hope heading into this week's
game. There's one trend of the
last 21 Big Games that is abso
lutely irrefutable, and it's the rea
son why Cal doesn't have a chance
yet again this year:
The team that is clearly better
never wins Big Game.
We're in luck!
Trust me, there is no way
we're going to lose. History
repeats itself, right? Well:
In 1970, Stanford entered Big
Game at 8-2, on the way to the
Rose Bowl. Cal was 5-5. Needless
to say, the Bears won 22-14.
In 1972 Stanford was 5-4, Cal
2-8. Bears 24-21.
In 1974 Stanford was 4-4-2,
Cal 7-2-1. Indians/pre-Cardinal
22-20.
1980? Stanford 6-4, Cal 2-8.
Yup: Bears 28-23.
1986? As if you had to ask. The
1-9 Bears beat the 7-2 Cardinal
17-11.

There is one exception to the
rule: In 1983 the 4-5-1 Bears beat
the 1-9 Cardinal 27-18. There was
one difference in that game,
however: Odd year. The game was
at Stanford. All the rest? Even
years. At Cal. Look at your calen
dar.
It's fairly obvious that every
time one team is better than the
other, something really screwy
happens. Unfortunately, in all
these examples the better team
has had at least three more Wins
than the the other team. The
records this year? Cal is 6-3-1 .. .
and we're 4-6, thanks to the upset
win last week over Arizona.
AAAUUUUGGGGHHH! If
only Cal had hit that field goal
against USC! And hey: If only
Notre Dame's Derek Brown had
held on to that ball, we'd be a
cinch this Saturday.
I still like our chances, though.
Cal tied USC, and we, well, you
know. Cal crushed Oregon, and
we, well, you know. Cal beat
UCLA and we, well, you know.
There's only one pick as to the
better team, which means we're
in mighty fine shape.

The team that is
clearly better never
wins Big Game.

There's just one problem
with the whole scenario.
Four years ago, the Band
was suspended two weeks before
Big Game, was reinstated a week
later ... and watched the Gator
Bowl-bound Cardinal, led by star
quarterback John Paye, fall flat
on its face.
Four years before that the
Band was involved in the fantas
tic, oops, I mean infamous Play.
This year, the Band has gone
through its suspension, been rein
stated ... and, I have a crazy feel
ing, is going to watch (or be
involved in) one of the wackiest
Big Games ever.
Maybe, just maybe, it's our
turn to do something crazy.

If you want to shoot Cameron
Macky for saying he loved the
Play, he'll be at Maples tonight to
watch the men's hoops team open
its season.
Uh-oh. Somethin' screwy's

it. You can feel it in the air, you

It's a one-game season.
You've heard of all the huge,
age-old matchups: Nebraska-
Oklahoma, Pitt-Penn State
(GO PITT!!!), USC-UCLA,
Harvard-Yale, Slippery Rock-
Lock Haven (look it up)
Wait, am I missing some
thing'? Let's see ... oh yeah,
that thing they have out here.
What's it called? The (Not Usu
ally Very) Big Game?
Now, before I get lynched,
let's keep in mind that I'm
from the East Coast, and most
folks there could give a flying
you-know-what about a game
between Stanford and Cal. I
can just hear a steelworker
watching the news: "Big
Game? My word, isn't that just
a wee bit presumptuous on the
part of those fellows?" Or
something to that effect.
Let's be honest: Outside of
the Bay Area, this rivalry just
isn't big news. In fact, the first
time I even heard about Big
Game was one afternoon in
November, 1982. I was in
eighth grade, had probably just
finished watching Penn State
crush Pitt on the way to the
national title (I've come to
grips with it, thanks for asking)
when I saw a highlight show.
The first thing they showed

was a kickoff return. It seems
the guys in white had just
kicked a field goal to go up with
only a few seconds left. The
guys in blue received the kick
off.. . threw a few laterals .. .
ran over a silly looking trom
bone player . . . and won the
game.

I loved it.
Of course, I was way too
young to realize that the guys
in blue were supposed to be vil
lains, while the guys in white
were supposed to win. I was too
young too realize that a Play as
miraculous as that could only
be eryoyable if you happened to
be wearing the right colors.
I guess I was just stupid.
Anyway, my second reaction
was "Where the $@%&*#!?&
do they get off calling it Big
Game?" And, eight years later,
I still don't know.
Why the pessimism, you
ask? Oh, pipe down.
I'm just being realistic.
Let's play a little game: When
was the last time Big Game fea
tured two teams that actually
had winning records? Wrong.
Keep going. There you go:
1979.


Cameron
Macky
You remember 1979. Disco was
still in. A Democrat was in the
White House.
Andy Gibb was a star.
In fact, the only reason Cal had
a winning record that year was
that Oregon had to forfeit a win
because of an ineligible player.
Without that forfeit Cal would
have been 5-5, and we'd have to go
back to 1978 to find a game
between two half-decent teams.
A long and storied tradition,
indeed. I found myself wondering
if the game had ever been worth
watching, so I decided to go back
through the teams' records of the
last 21 seasons to see if there was
any sort of pattern. Why 21 sea
sons? Well, (1) I was born in late
1968, and (2) I'm a white middle
class male, which means the only
history that matters to me is the
history that I've been a part of.
Let's take a look. Hey! Both
Stanford and Cal had winning
records in 1969! As for 1970, well,
no. Two good teams again in '71,

and '75, and '77, '78 and '79. Six
of the first 11 years isn't bad.
Since then, though, it's been
Stink City.
There was something else I
noticed, and it gave me a glimmer
of hope heading into this week's
game. There's one trend of the
last 21 Big Games that is abso
lutely irrefutable, and it's the rea
son why Cal doesn't have a chance
yet again this year:
The team that is clearly better
never wins Big Game.
We're in luck!
Trust me, there is no way
we're going to lose. History
repeats itself, right? Well:
In 1970, Stanford entered Big
Game at 8-2, on the way to the
Rose Bowl. Cal was 5-5. Needless
to say, the Bears won 22-14.
In 1972 Stanford was 5-4, Cal
2-8. Bears 24-21.
In 1974 Stanford was 4-4-2,
Cal 7-2-1. Indians/pre-Cardinal
22-20.
1980? Stanford 6-4, Cal 2-8.
Yup: Bears 28-23.
1986? As if you had to ask. The
1-9 Bears beat the 7-2 Cardinal
17-11.

There is one exception to the
rule: In 1983 the 4-5-1 Bears beat
the 1-9 Cardinal 27-18. There was
one difference in that game,
however: Odd year. The game was
at Stanford. All the rest? Even
years. At Cal. Look at your calen
dar.
It's fairly obvious that every
time one team is better than the
other, something really screwy
happens. Unfortunately, in all
these examples the better team
has had at least three more Wins
than the the other team. The
records this year? Cal is 6-3-1 .. .
and we're 4-6, thanks to the upset
win last week over Arizona.
AAAUUUUGGGGHHH! If
only Cal had hit that field goal
against USC! And hey: If only
Notre Dame's Derek Brown had
held on to that ball, we'd be a
cinch this Saturday.
I still like our chances, though.
Cal tied USC, and we, well, you
know. Cal crushed Oregon, and
we, well, you know. Cal beat
UCLA and we, well, you know.
There's only one pick as to the
better team, which means we're
in mighty fine shape.

The team that is
clearly better never
wins Big Game.

There's just one problem
with the whole scenario.
Four years ago, the Band
was suspended two weeks before
Big Game, was reinstated a week
later ... and watched the Gator
Bowl-bound Cardinal, led by star
quarterback John Paye, fall flat
on its face.
Four years before that the
Band was involved in the fantas
tic, oops, I mean infamous Play.
This year, the Band has gone
through its suspension, been rein
stated ... and, I have a crazy feel
ing, is going to watch (or be
involved in) one of the wackiest
Big Games ever.
Maybe, just maybe, it's our
turn to do something crazy.

If you want to shoot Cameron
Macky for saying he loved the
Play, he'll be at Maples tonight to
watch the men's hoops team open
its season.
Uh-oh. Somethin' screwy's
a-comin', and there ain't
nuthin' we can do about
it. You can feel it in the air, you
can see it in the trees, you can
smell it in White Plaza (no,
wait, it always smells like that):
It's that special week again.
Thanksgiving is just around
the corner, and college football
teams everywhere are prepar
ing to take on their archrivals.
It's a one-game season.
