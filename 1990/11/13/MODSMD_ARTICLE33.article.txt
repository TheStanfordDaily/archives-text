Uh-oh. Somethin' screwy's
a-comin', and there ain't
nuthin' we can do about
it. You can feel it in the air, you
can see it in the trees, you can
smell it in White Plaza (no,
wait, it always smells like that):
It's that special week again.
Thanksgiving is just around
the corner, and college football
teams everywhere are prepar
ing to take on their archrivals.
It's a one-game season.
You've heard of all the huge,
age-old matchups: Nebraska-
Oklahoma, Pitt-Penn State
(GO PITT!!!), USC-UCLA,
Harvard-Yale, Slippery Rock-
Lock Haven (look it up)
Wait, am I missing some
thing'? Let's see ... oh yeah,
that thing they have out here.
What's it called? The (Not Usu
ally Very) Big Game?
Now, before I get lynched,
let's keep in mind that I'm
from the East Coast, and most
folks there could give a flying
you-know-what about a game
between Stanford and Cal. I
can just hear a steelworker
watching the news: "Big
Game? My word, isn't that just
a wee bit presumptuous on the
part of those fellows?" Or
something to that effect.
Let's be honest: Outside of
the Bay Area, this rivalry just
isn't big news. In fact, the first
time I even heard about Big
Game was one afternoon in
November, 1982. I was in
eighth grade, had probably just
finished watching Penn State
crush Pitt on the way to the
national title (I've come to
grips with it, thanks for asking)
when I saw a highlight show.
The first thing they showed

was a kickoff return. It seems
the guys in white had just
kicked a field goal to go up with
only a few seconds left. The
guys in blue received the kick
off.. . threw a few laterals .. .
ran over a silly looking trom
bone player . . . and won the
game.

I loved it.
Of course, I was way too
young to realize that the guys
in blue were supposed to be vil
lains, while the guys in white
were supposed to win. I was too
young too realize that a Play as
miraculous as that could only
be eryoyable if you happened to
be wearing the right colors.
I guess I was just stupid.
Anyway, my second reaction
was "Where the $@%&*#!?&
do they get off calling it Big
Game?" And, eight years later,
I still don't know.
Why the pessimism, you
ask? Oh, pipe down.
I'm just being realistic.
Let's play a little game: When
was the last time Big Game fea
tured two teams that actually
had winning records? Wrong.
Keep going. There you go:
1979.
