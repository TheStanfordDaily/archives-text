# Booker makes time for making catches

Who works as a counselor at
the Bridge, serves as a Senior
Class President, has a strong
faith in Christianity, writes an
honors thesis, and has emerged
as a potent weapon in Stan
ford's offense this year? If you
guessed Superman, you
wouldn't be far off — the
answer is Cory Booker, a senior
tight end for the Stanford foot
ball team who makes incredible
contributions both on and off
the field.
Cory Booker does more
before 9 a.m. than most Stan
ford students do all day. He was
a live-in at the Bridge last year
and is a Senior Class President
this year, yet he is a competitor
for the starting tight end posi
tion and has made key recep
tions against Notre Dame and
USC, including a touchdown
catch against the Trojans.
What is his secret?
"I owe all my abilities and
successes to God," said Booker.
"My faith has been very impor
tant to me and has helped
everything fall into place for
me this year."
Not everything was falling
into place for Booker his fresh
man year, however, when he
came in as a highly touted All-
America tight end but was red
shirted and moved to wide
receiver, forcing him to lose 40
pounds in the process. "I came
into my freshman camp out of
shape and overweight and had
to go on a crash diet. I had a
tough freshman year — it
seemed that the harder I
worked, the more I slipped on
the depth chart. It was a bad
year, but it was also good. I feel
that God was preparing me for
things down the road," Booker
explains.
His sophomore year he saw
a little playing time, and then
his junior year Denny Green
took over the coaching position
at Stanford and things began
to change. Green moved him to
tight end and asked him to gain
weight again, whereupon he
bulked up to his present 240
pounds. He played in all 11
games that season and started
against USC, making seven
catches for 37 yards.
Booker gives a lot of credit
for his and the team's
turnaround to the coaches.
"Coach Green gave new hope
to the football team. The
coaching staff knows a lot
about football, and they have
shown us how to play to our
potential."
Booker came into last
spring's training with a new
attitude. He challenged Turner
Baur for the starting position,
but he still didn't feel that he
had reached his potential. His
position coach, Brian Billick,
came up to him after one prac

tice and handed him a list of
the top five tight ends in the
NFL. "I looked at that list, and
I saw that my statistics were
similar to all of theirs. I real
ized that the only thing holding
me back was me."
However, Booker separated
his shoulder at the beginning
of this year and he has been
slowly working his way back
ever since. "After playing
against UCLA, I was told by a
coach that I finally 'looked like
a football player out there,'
which made me feel good
because this guy doesn't give
out compliments much."
His improvement has con
tinued as the season has gone
on. "The Notre Dame game
was a real breakthrough for
me, and then scoring that
touchdown against USC was a
big moment for me. That was
my first touchdown since my
senior year in high school."
Booker sees his growth as a
football player as a direct result
of his Christian faith. "My
faith kept me going and
revealed my inner strengths to
me when times were tough.
People say that football builds
character, but I would disagree.
Football reveals character, and
with God's help, football has
helped me realize who I am."
His faith has helped him in
other aspects of his life as well.
As a staffer at the Bridge and
Senior Class President, he has
huge demands on his time in
addition to his schoolwork.
Booker says,"The more you do
with what God gave you, the
more he'll give you to do.
"[Football season is] tough,
but next year I plan to take it a
little easier and relax a little
more. You only get out of
Stanford what you put into it,
so I am maximizing my time
here."
Speaking of next year, what
does he think it holds for him
and Stanford?
"I think that I have been
holding myself back. I'm set
ting my goals to improve my
blocking and start next year. As
for the team, I think that
Coach Green has helped the
team play to its true potential.
We are convinced that we can
beat anyone now, and we just
have to conquer our last hurdle
of being consistent. We are
starting to earn respect now,
and our worst enemy is our
selves. We are a sleeping giant
in the Pac-10.
"I'm not leaving here with
out a bowl game. They'll have
to drag me off the field to get
me to go."
And after Stanford? Booker
replies, "I would definitely like
to go pro — for the experience
and the money. The NFL start
ing salary would go a long way
towards Stanford Law School
tuition."
