# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
One thing coaches learn awfully quickly
is that players don't always listen to them.
That's why it is so important to have good
leaders on any team that wants to be suc
cessful.
Last week two leaders did what they do
best and the results, as expected, were more
wins for the Cardinal. Thus, The Daily's
Athletes of the Week are Kristin Klein of
the volleyball team and Ron George of the

football team.
Klein, a 6-foot junior outside hitter from
Pacific Palisades, Calif., was the key factor in
Stanford's three wins last week. Wednesday
night the third-ranked Cardinal got
ambushed by unheralded California in
Berkeley.
She had 25 kills and 11 digs for the match
while hitting .371. Stanford came back to
win in five games.
Friday Klein had an easier time of things,
recording 12 kills and hitting .556 in a sweep
of Oklahoma. Saturday she again hit .371 in
a victory over sixth-ranked Texas. She had
18 kills, 11 digs, three blocks and three aces
as well in the important win.

George, a 6-2, 230-pound outside
linebacker from Heidelberg, Germany, was
one of the key players in the Cardinal's
sound defeat of Arizona.
After being flat for two and a half games,
the Cardinal snapped out of it with a
resounding win over Washington State a
week ago. But the players knew they would
have to be even better to stop the Wildcats'
impressive ground attack.
George and his teammates on defense
began the game with an aggression rarely
seen from the Cardinal. After Stanford
scored on its opening drive, the defense
stopped the Wildcats on three plays.
After throwing down the ball carrier for
no gain on third down, however, George got
in the running back's face and was flagged
for unsportsmanlike conduct. With 15 yards

and new life, Arizona drove for a field goal.
But while the penalty cost the Cardinal
three points, the fact that it occurred almost
insured the Stanford victory. With that
much enthuisiasm on the field, there was no
way the Wildcats had a chance.
George also led by example, sacking Ari
zona signal-callers four times to preserve the
win.
