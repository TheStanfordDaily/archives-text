Film program wins grant
The Communication Department's Docu
mentary Film Program was awarded a 1990
Eastman Product Grant from the Eastman
Kodak Company.
The grant, given "in recognition of aca
demic excellence in support of the future
generation of film makers," consists of
$5,000 in motion picture film for student
productions. The film will be set aside for
graduate students' film projects.
Student-produced films have won many
awards in recent years, including Emmy
Awards, two Academy Award nominations
and prizes at national and international film
festivals.
Project to plant trees
Volunteers will reseed the foothills behind
the main campus with acorns this fall as part
of a Stanford Centennial project called
"Planting for the Second Hundred Years."
Planners hope the acorns will mature into
oak trees during Stanford's second century.
The project aims to reverse the dwindling
of oak trees because of climactic changes,
cattle grazing and other developments in the
foothills.
According to Judy Chan, project orga
nizer and associate director of planning,
"This project is a visible statement and com
mitment to the second hundred years.
"We will be planting acorns to regenerate
the academic reserve lands in the Stanford
foothills and make up for the decline in the
oak population," she said.
The project is part of Stanford's 40-year
Vegetation Management Program, which
intends to re-establish the oak population by
planting nursery-grown tree stock, exclud
ing cattle by fencing off areas and planting
oak acorns before the winter rains.
Prof, receives pioneering
education award
School of Medicine Prof. John Farquhar
received an award from the Charles A. Dana

Foundation for his work in preventing heart
disease. The award recognizes pioneering
achievements in education.
Farquhar, a director of the University
Center for Research in Disease Prevention,
showed through his research that deaths
from cardiovascular disease could be reduced
by comprehensive health campaigns.
Levy awarded research prize
School of Medicine Prof. Ronald Levy
received the 1989 Josef Steiner Cancer
Foundation prize last week at the University
of Bern in Switzerland.
Levy's specialty is human lymphoma, a
cancerous tumor that comes from the body's
immune system cells. Levy was the first to
use monoclonal antibodies to treat this con
dition.
About 50 patients have been treated by
this method since 1981, and over half of
them have experienced significant tumor
shrinkage.
For the last decade, Levy has tried to
define the basis of the antibody effect on
tumors and analyze the limits of this treat
ment.
The award is given annually by the foun
dation for "outstanding contributions in the
field of cancer research" and is named for
Josef Maria Steiner, a Swiss pharmacist who
died in 1983.

Haber is first recipient of
Latin American Center award
History Prof. Steven Haber became the
first recipient of the Innovation Fund award
from the Stanford Center on Latin American
Studies.
Haber, a specialist in the history of Latin
American economic development, received
the award for his proposal to develop a
course, workshop and conference exploring
why Latin America fell economically behind
more developed nations.
The award gives $15,000 to Stanford
staff, faculty members or graduate students
for curricular or research projects in the gen
eral field of Latin American studies.
Haber has taught at Stanford since 1987
and is the author of the book, "Industry and
Underdevelopment: The Industrialization of
Mexico, 1890-1940."
The award-winning project is an out
growth of a new book that he is writing that
compares Latin American development to
that of the United States. It will involve
Stanford students and faculty, as well as eco
nomic historians at UC-Berkeley and UCLA.
