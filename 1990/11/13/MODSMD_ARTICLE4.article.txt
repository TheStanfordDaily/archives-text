# Utilities commission grants rehearing
## Outside phone companies may soon be allowed to compete for service 
### Cecilia Tom Editorial staff 
Three graduate students
claimed victory this weekend
when the Public Utilities Com
mission decided that the sale of
telephone cables from Pacific Bell
to Stanford is a void transaction
and granted a rehearing that may
allow the phone company to com
pete with the University on cam
pus.

The decision is in response to a
petition filed by students Michael
Murray, William Behrman and
Gerald LeTendre after their June
attempt to secure an order from
the commission to halt implemen
tation of Stanford *8 residential
phone service failed.
The commission originally
ruled that Stanford is not obli
gated to allow its residents access
to Pacific Bell because it is not a
"shared-tenant-service" provider.

Shared-tenant service is pro
vided by a landlord for commercial
use in which tenants pay for tele
phone service, according to a 1987
commission decision.
Stanford argued in the June
hearing that it is not a shared-ten
ant-service provider because it
does not provide phone service to
its commercial tenants, such as
American Express Travel Service
and Wells Fargo Bank in Tresid
der Union.

The 1987 definition does not
directly address the issue of resi
dential phone service at universi
ties, which may or may not be con
sidered shared-tenant service.
The June ruling has "set a
precedent that it isn't supposed to
be set," Murray said. The commis
sion granted the rehearing in
order "to clarify [that it] has not
altered [its] guidelines for the pro
vision of shared-tenant services."
The decision on the rehearing
could force all universities and
private residential owners to let
tenants choose their own phone
companies.
Jotham Stein, a third-year law
student who represented the stu
dents in the first hearing, said the
rehearing order is the best that
the students could have gotten —
a "great decision for Stanford stu
dents and perhaps for California
consumers."
The commission, in addition to
granting a rehearing, is ordering
that Pacific Bell file an application
within a month for the sale of its
property to Stanford, in accor
dance with the Public Utilities
Code. Until then, any such sale is
considered to be void.
Ronald McClain, an attorney
for Pacific Bell, declined to com
ment on what action his company
is going to take, as he had not yet
received the commission's order.
In the original hearing, Pacific
Bell argued that Stanford should
be a shared-tenant-service
provider.
"Our position during the hear
ing was much closer to the stu
dents'. If there is a rehearing and
we participate, we will take
approximately the same position,"
a Pacific Bell official told The
Daily in an interview published
Sept. 25.
Murray said he hopes to coordi
nate his efforts with Pacific Bell in
the rehearing and perhaps also get
outside legal advice.
Attorney Terry Houlihan from
McCutchen, Doyle, Brown and
Enerson, the law firm that repre
sented Stanford in the June hear
ing, declined to comment because
he had not read the commission's

order. Jan Thomson, director of
Communication Services at Stan
ford, could not be reached for
comment.
In addition to clarifying the
shared-tenant-service provision,
the rehearing will re-examine:
• Whether Stanford students
living on campus are members of
the general public,
• Whether Stanford is under
the jurisdiction of the Public Util
ities Commission,
• Whether a low-income option
similar to Pacific Bell's Universal
Lifeline service should be made
available to students, and
• Whether students should
have access to 900, 950 and 976
numbers and direct dial-1 access
to long distance carriers.
The commission said there is
not enough evidence to sustain a
reconsideration on an antitrust
allegation that the students
offered, however.
The commission's original deci
sion ruled that Stanford is not a
public utility. Stanford argued
that students' "acceptance of
admission is an agreement to com
ply with the University's rules,
regulations and policies."
Stanford began providing local
and long-distance phone services
to all campus residences at the
beginning of fall quarter. Students
without a previous Pacific Bell bill
proving that they subscribed to
the Universal Lifeline service are
not eligible for the Stanford ver
sion of this option for low-income
families.
In addition, students can only
access long-distance carriers of
their choice through calling cards.

when the Public Utilities Com
mission decided that the sale of
telephone cables from Pacific Bell
to Stanford is a void transaction
and granted a rehearing that may
allow the phone company to com
pete with the University on cam
pus.

The decision is in response to a
petition filed by students Michael
Murray, William Behrman and
Gerald LeTendre after their June
attempt to secure an order from
the commission to halt implemen
tation of Stanford *8 residential
phone service failed.
The commission originally
ruled that Stanford is not obli
gated to allow its residents access
to Pacific Bell because it is not a
"shared-tenant-service" provider.

Shared-tenant service is pro
vided by a landlord for commercial
use in which tenants pay for tele
phone service, according to a 1987
commission decision.
Stanford argued in the June
hearing that it is not a shared-ten
ant-service provider because it
does not provide phone service to
its commercial tenants, such as
American Express Travel Service
and Wells Fargo Bank in Tresid
der Union.

The 1987 definition does not
directly address the issue of resi
dential phone service at universi
ties, which may or may not be con
sidered shared-tenant service.
The June ruling has "set a
precedent that it isn't supposed to
be set," Murray said. The commis
sion granted the rehearing in
order "to clarify [that it] has not
altered [its] guidelines for the pro
vision of shared-tenant services."
The decision on the rehearing
could force all universities and
private residential owners to let
tenants choose their own phone
companies.
Jotham Stein, a third-year law
student who represented the stu
dents in the first hearing, said the
rehearing order is the best that
the students could have gotten —
a "great decision for Stanford stu
dents and perhaps for California
consumers."
The commission, in addition to
granting a rehearing, is ordering
that Pacific Bell file an application
within a month for the sale of its
property to Stanford, in accor
dance with the Public Utilities
Code. Until then, any such sale is
considered to be void.
Ronald McClain, an attorney
for Pacific Bell, declined to com
ment on what action his company
is going to take, as he had not yet
received the commission's order.
In the original hearing, Pacific
Bell argued that Stanford should
be a shared-tenant-service
provider.
"Our position during the hear
ing was much closer to the stu
dents'. If there is a rehearing and
we participate, we will take
approximately the same position,"
a Pacific Bell official told The
Daily in an interview published
Sept. 25.
Murray said he hopes to coordi
nate his efforts with Pacific Bell in
the rehearing and perhaps also get
outside legal advice.
Attorney Terry Houlihan from
McCutchen, Doyle, Brown and
Enerson, the law firm that repre
sented Stanford in the June hear
ing, declined to comment because
he had not read the commission's

order. Jan Thomson, director of
Communication Services at Stan
ford, could not be reached for
comment.
In addition to clarifying the
shared-tenant-service provision,
the rehearing will re-examine:
• Whether Stanford students
living on campus are members of
the general public,
• Whether Stanford is under
the jurisdiction of the Public Util
ities Commission,
• Whether a low-income option
similar to Pacific Bell's Universal
Lifeline service should be made
available to students, and
• Whether students should
have access to 900, 950 and 976
numbers and direct dial-1 access
to long distance carriers.
The commission said there is
not enough evidence to sustain a
reconsideration on an antitrust
allegation that the students
offered, however.
The commission's original deci
sion ruled that Stanford is not a
public utility. Stanford argued
that students' "acceptance of
admission is an agreement to com
ply with the University's rules,
regulations and policies."
Stanford began providing local
and long-distance phone services
to all campus residences at the
beginning of fall quarter. Students
without a previous Pacific Bell bill
proving that they subscribed to
the Universal Lifeline service are
not eligible for the Stanford ver
sion of this option for low-income
families.
In addition, students can only
access long-distance carriers of
their choice through calling cards.

The commission's
original decision
ruled that Stanford is
not a public utility.
