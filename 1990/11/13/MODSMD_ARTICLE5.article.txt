# Vandals pelt statue, booby trap campus
## 
### Howard Libit Staff writer 
Vandals struck campus late last
week in two separate incidents,
setting a wire booby trap and
defacing a statue with paint pellet
guns.
A neck-high wire was hung
near the Graduate School of Busi
ness late Wednesday evening or
early Thursday morning.
Wrapped around the Hercules
pillars, lamplight poles and palm
trees at the school's entrance, the
wire was stretched across the path
between the building and the
Oval. Paul Johnson, associate

dean for administration of the
Business School, discovered it
Thursday morning.
The wire posed a danger to peo
ple entering or leaving the build
ing and people biking on the path.
Johnson said he first noticed
the wire at 7:30 a.m. last
Thursday when he arrived at the
school and parked his bicycle next
to a pole where the wire was tied.
Johnson said he removed the wire
and reported it to the police.
Police consider the wire to be a
booby trap.
"The booby trap could have
seriously injured people riding
bicycles. If somebody was riding

fast enough, it could have killed
him," said Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer. "It is not very funny
... It is a public safety situation."
No one was reported injured by
the wire, and police have no sus
pects.
In an unrelated incident, a spe
cial events officer noticed early
Sunday morning that the Seagulls
sculpture, located between Math
Corner (Building 380) and the
Physics Lecture Hall, had been
shot with orange and yellow paint
pellets.
Police said they have no sus

pects.
"It might be random juveniles
playing war games with paint
guns," said Niemeyer. "It could be
anyone."
Police do not suspect UC-
Berkeley students because the
pellets were orange and yellow,
said Niemeyer. UC-Berkeley stu
dents usually use blue and yellow
colors and paint "Cal," he said.
People with information on
either incident are urged to con
tact the police. Police are espe
cially concerned about the booby
trap because of the high potential
of injury.
