# Counselor sets high goals
## Heming provides support for lesbian students 
### Minal Hajratwala Staff writer 
Trudie Heming, Stanford's first openly
lesbian counselor, speaks definitively about
her goals for the Stanford community, but
is quick to point out the obstacles she faces.
Heming, who has a one-year position at
Cowell's Counseling and Psychological Ser
vices, counsels individual students and
leads weekly support groups for lesbians,
bisexual women and women exploring sex
ual identity issues. She is currently estab
lishing a training program to ensure the
future of such counseling and will institute
a support group for lesbian and bisexual
women of color if there is student interest.
"I would like to increase the sense of
community for lesbian and bisexual women
on this campus," said Heming, who works
at Stanford Wednesdays and Fridays.
A primary goal for Heming is to assure
women that CAPS is committed to helping
them. In the past, lesbian and bisexual
women have felt uncomfortable seeking
help from CAPS therapists, she said.
"If the goal is helping to alleviate isola
tion, you run groups," she explained. "But
people are individuals as well as members
of groups, so you need to offer individual

counseling as well."
Heming was commissioned by CAPS to
write last year's Stanford Lesbian Needs
Assessment in which she pinpointed prob
lems facing lesbian and bisexual women.
"People were telling me that it is very
difficult to be different here," she said.
"There is a collective unconscious stereo
type here of what a successful human being
is, and it is a very narrow mold."
Given the stereotype she has observed,
Heming said she believes some lesbian and
bisexual students might have a difficult
time building many close friendships.
"They feel they have to keep part of
themselves totally hidden," she said.
According to Heming, coming out as a
lesbian 20 years ago was in some ways
harder and in some ways easier than it is
for women today Now 43, she lives with her
lover in their house in Richmond.
"I knew from age 11, but I came out to
other people right before the emergence of
the feminist movement," she said. "In the
summer of love, 1969,1 came to California.
I remember driving across the country with
my first lover, and people saying, 'You girls
are going to California?'


On* of counselor Trudle Hemlng's goals Is to make It ssslsr for Issblsns and bisexual women to receive therapy from
Cowell's Counseling and Psychological Services. She leads both Individual and weekly group sessions.
