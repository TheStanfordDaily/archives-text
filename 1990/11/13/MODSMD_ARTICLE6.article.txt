# Counselor sets high goals
## Heming provides support for lesbian students 
### Minal Hajratwala Staff writer 
Trudie Heming, Stanford's first openly
lesbian counselor, speaks definitively about
her goals for the Stanford community, but
is quick to point out the obstacles she faces.
Heming, who has a one-year position at
Cowell's Counseling and Psychological Ser
vices, counsels individual students and
leads weekly support groups for lesbians,
bisexual women and women exploring sex
ual identity issues. She is currently estab
lishing a training program to ensure the
future of such counseling and will institute
a support group for lesbian and bisexual
women of color if there is student interest.
"I would like to increase the sense of
community for lesbian and bisexual women
on this campus," said Heming, who works
at Stanford Wednesdays and Fridays.
A primary goal for Heming is to assure
women that CAPS is committed to helping
them. In the past, lesbian and bisexual
women have felt uncomfortable seeking
help from CAPS therapists, she said.
"If the goal is helping to alleviate isola
tion, you run groups," she explained. "But
people are individuals as well as members
of groups, so you need to offer individual

counseling as well."
Heming was commissioned by CAPS to
write last year's Stanford Lesbian Needs
Assessment in which she pinpointed prob
lems facing lesbian and bisexual women.
"People were telling me that it is very
difficult to be different here," she said.
"There is a collective unconscious stereo
type here of what a successful human being
is, and it is a very narrow mold."
Given the stereotype she has observed,
Heming said she believes some lesbian and
bisexual students might have a difficult
time building many close friendships.
"They feel they have to keep part of
themselves totally hidden," she said.
According to Heming, coming out as a
lesbian 20 years ago was in some ways
harder and in some ways easier than it is
for women today Now 43, she lives with her
lover in their house in Richmond.
"I knew from age 11, but I came out to
other people right before the emergence of
the feminist movement," she said. "In the
summer of love, 1969,1 came to California.
I remember driving across the country with
my first lover, and people saying, 'You girls
are going to California?'


On* of counselor Trudle Hemlng's goals Is to make It ssslsr for Issblsns and bisexual women to receive therapy from
Cowell's Counseling and Psychological Services. She leads both Individual and weekly group sessions.
"Everything was happening
very, very quickly — a wonderful
explosion of activities, events.
There was also a very definite sep
aratist thrust," she recalled.
But this made it difficult for
those who did not fit the mold
exactly, she added. "I saw a lot of
pain generated by women judging
each other. I was saying, 'We need
to learn to support each other
despite our differences.' There is
nothing worse than seeking sup
port, only to find that you have to
hide parts of yourself."
Today, Heming said she sees "a
lot more permission to be an indi
vidual," particularly in a univer
sity setting that encourages
exploration and "examining one's
assumptions."
Heming holds a Ph.D. in psy
chology, and bachelor's degrees in

anthropology and psychology
from UC-Berkeley, where she has
worked at a gay counseling pro
gram.
She said she sees a range of
clients in her private practice,
which she opened in 1982, and
enjoys couples therapy in particu
lar. Heming is now studying
mainly heterosexual couples as
part of a research project at UC-
Berkeley.
"People (in couples) tend to
think their problems are just
about them," she said. "When
they see the problems are univer
sal, the pressure is off. It becomes
a common issue, as opposed to
something wrong with you."
Born in Baltimore, Heming,
the youngest of four children,
grew up in Portland, Maine.
"From the outside, the family
would probably have appeared
middle class," she recalled, "but
from the inside it felt very work
ing class.

There is a collective
unconscious stereo
type here of what a
successful human
being is, and it is a
very narrow mold.'

"My father was the son of Ger
man immigrants, a very rare real
life Horatio Alger story. He went
from being a machinist to being
vice president of sales.
"I was the first person to grad
uate from college from either side
of my family. My friends joke that
I'm the only person my age that
remembers the Great Depres
sion."
Her mother died when Heming
was 21, an event that has affected
her life. She said part of the rea
son she chose her career is that
"therapy had been a very positive
force in my own life."

"People (in couples) tend to
think their problems are just
about them," she said. "When
they see the problems are univer

a common issue, as opposed to
something wrong with you."

"From the outside, the family

Trudie Heming, Stanford's first openly
lesbian counselor, speaks definitively about
her goals for the Stanford community, but
is quick to point out the obstacles she faces.
Heming, who has a one-year position at
Cowell's Counseling and Psychological Ser
vices, counsels individual students and
leads weekly support groups for lesbians,
bisexual women and women exploring sex
ual identity issues. She is currently estab
lishing a training program to ensure the
future of such counseling and will institute
a support group for lesbian and bisexual
women of color if there is student interest.
"I would like to increase the sense of
community for lesbian and bisexual women
on this campus," said Heming, who works
at Stanford Wednesdays and Fridays.
A primary goal for Heming is to assure
women that CAPS is committed to helping
them. In the past, lesbian and bisexual
women have felt uncomfortable seeking
help from CAPS therapists, she said.
"If the goal is helping to alleviate isola
tion, you run groups," she explained. "But
people are individuals as well as members
of groups, so you need to offer individual

counseling as well."
Heming was commissioned by CAPS to
write last year's Stanford Lesbian Needs
Assessment in which she pinpointed prob
lems facing lesbian and bisexual women.
"People were telling me that it is very
difficult to be different here," she said.
"There is a collective unconscious stereo
type here of what a successful human being
is, and it is a very narrow mold."
Given the stereotype she has observed,
Heming said she believes some lesbian and
bisexual students might have a difficult
time building many close friendships.
"They feel they have to keep part of
themselves totally hidden," she said.
According to Heming, coming out as a
lesbian 20 years ago was in some ways
harder and in some ways easier than it is
for women today Now 43, she lives with her
lover in their house in Richmond.
"I knew from age 11, but I came out to
other people right before the emergence of
the feminist movement," she said. "In the
summer of love, 1969,1 came to California.
I remember driving across the country with
my first lover, and people saying, 'You girls
are going to California?'


On* of counselor Trudle Hemlng's goals Is to make It ssslsr for Issblsns and bisexual women to receive therapy from
Cowell's Counseling and Psychological Services. She leads both Individual and weekly group sessions.
"Everything was happening
very, very quickly — a wonderful
explosion of activities, events.
There was also a very definite sep
aratist thrust," she recalled.
But this made it difficult for
those who did not fit the mold
exactly, she added. "I saw a lot of
pain generated by women judging
each other. I was saying, 'We need
to learn to support each other
despite our differences.' There is
nothing worse than seeking sup
port, only to find that you have to
hide parts of yourself."
Today, Heming said she sees "a
lot more permission to be an indi
vidual," particularly in a univer
sity setting that encourages
exploration and "examining one's
assumptions."
