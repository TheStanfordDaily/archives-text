# East European students contrast two worlds
## 
### John Borland 
Radu Chesaru has seen more
of revolution than most. The 21-
year old Rumanian student was
shot in the back last year while
trying to recapture the state-run
television station during the vio
lent overthrow of the Ceaucescu
regime.
Along with six other students
from Hungary and Rumania,
Chesaru compared evolving
democracies in the two countries
with the U.S. political system
during a presentation last night
in Annenberg Auditorium.
The students are representa
tives of youth movements in
their respective nations.
Through the U.S.-sponsored
International Participation Pro
ject 2000, they have been study
ing American politics and work
ing on political campaigns in the
United States for several

nfonths.
Last night's discussion was
intended to compare their expe
riences in the recent anti-com
munist revolutions with what
they have seen here over the
past few months. Students
described their roles in demon
strations at home, then evalu
ated the American electoral sys
tem.
Stories of growing up under
Communist rule were fairly
standard. Each student detailed
the comprehensive method gov
ernments used to ensure loyalty,
beginning in nursery school.
"It was a very sophisticated
system," said Anita Balaton, an
American Studies, English and
History mcyor from Hungary. "It
influenced all aspects of our
lives. In high school, we would
criticize the party, but we would
never question its authority."
Some, like Chesaru, did ques-

tion party domination. Before he
was shot in the back, Chesaru
was detained last October by the
Rumanian secret police for anti
state activity. No one was
allowed to see him during the
two months he spent in jail, he
said.
Strong political concern is
lacking in the United States,
most panelists complained,
because the system does not pro
vide incentives to care. Speakers
contrasted current levels of apa
thy in America, particularly
among young people, with
excitement over new-found and
political freedoms in their own
countries.
Chesaru said Marx may have
been correct in saying that in
wealthy, liberal societies the
impetus to vote is lessened by
the knowledge that no leader
will substantially change the

status quo.
Economics major Imre
Baranyi, from Hungary, was
even more critical of the Ameri
can system. "The United States
is facing huge problems," he
said. "America is no longer the
number one nation in the
world."
"Policy makers need to take
into account the unification of
Europe, the end of the empire of
evil and huge internal indebted
ness," he added. "We need this
because the world needs Amer
i n
ica.
Audience reactions to the stu
dents presentation were favor
able. "What they're going
through is incredible," said
sophomore Gabriel Manriquez.
"They're rebuilding completely
from the grassroots level. It's
like some kind of dream for
them."
