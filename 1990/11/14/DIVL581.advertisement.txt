STANFORD UNIVERSITY CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES AND ALCOHOL POLICY
Student conduct is guided by the Fundamental Standard, which states the expectation that students
will act in ways that demonstrate respect for order, morality, personal honor, and the rights of others.
Implicit in the Standard is the understanding that students are responsible for making their own
decisions and accepting the consequences of those decisions.
In order to make informed decisions about alcohol use, students and others should be aware of the
health and safety risks associated with its use, as well as the state and local laws about possessing,
serving and consuming alcohol. It is widely recognized that the misuse and abuse of drugs ("controlled
substances")* and the abuse of alcohol are major contributors to serious health problems as well as to
social and civic concerns. The health risks associated with the use of illicit drugs and the abuse of
alcohol include various deleterious physical and mental consequences including addiction, severe
disability, and death. Information concerning the known effects of alcohol and specific drugs is
available from the Alcohol and Drug Information Center at the Cowell Student Health Center.
The goal of this policy is to reduce drug and alcohol abuse and the human and material costs
associated with it. The University, as an educational institution, approaches student conduct issues
from a perspective that places greater emphasis on individual responsibility and development than on
regualtory measures. Consequendy, education about and prevention of alcohol-related problems will
continue to be our primary emphasis. Morever, it is the intention of the University that students as
individuals and as members of groups will conduct themselves in accordance with this and all other
University policies governing student conduct.
* Controlled substances are those defined in 21 U.S.C. 812 and include, but are not limited to, such
substances as marijuana, heoin, cocaine and amphetamines.
Policy
It is the policy of Stanford University to maintain a drug-free workplace and campus. The unlawful
manufacutre, distribution, dispensation,possession, and/or use of controlled substances or the unlawful
possession, use or distribution of alcohol is prohibited on the Stanford campus, in the workplace, or as
part of any of the University's activites. The workplace and campus are presumed to include all
Stanford premises where the activites of the University are conducted. Violation of this policy may
resule in disciplinary sanctions up to and including termination of employment or expulsion of
students. Violations may also be referred to the appropriate authorities for prosecution. This policy
will be reviewed at least biennially.
Consequences of Violation
Educational and rehabilitative measures will be the preferred response to simple infractions. However,
behavior associated with drug or alcohol use and abuse may also constitute one or more of the
following:
1. Violation of the University residence agreement or Terms and Conditions of Fraternity Occupancy,
subjecting the student to loss of University housing
2. Violation of student organization conditions of recognition, subjecting the student to expulsion
from the organization and/or the organization's loss of University recognition and associated
privileges
3. Violation of the Fundamental Standard, subjecting the student to University discipline which
includes as a possible outcome suspension or expulsion from Stanford.
Inebriation is considered not as an excuse for misconduct but rather as an aggravating circumstance. A
student's careless or willful reduction, through the use of alcohol or other intoxicants, of his or her
own ability to think clearly, exercise good judgement, and respond to rational intervention is
considered grounds for more stringent penalties than might be levied otherwise.
Civil Liability
While the law regarding civil liability is complex, it is important to know that under some
circumstances party hosts, sponsors, bartenders, or others may be held legally liable for the
consequences of serving alcohol to underaged drinkers or to obviously intoxicated persons.
Criminal Liabilty
Stanford University is not a sanctuary from the enforcement of state and local laws. Students and
others on campus who violate the law may be and have been arrested and prosecuted. Primary
responsibility for law enforcement, including that related to alcohol, rests with law enforcement
agencies, primarily the Stanford Policy Department. Uniformed officers who patrol the campus and
respond to calls are deputized by the sheriff of Santa Clara County and are fully empowered and
authorized to stop vehicles, make arrests, and enforce all laws. Laws are subject to change;
consequendy, the following information is illustrative but must not be relied upon as a complete and
current citing of relevant laws. More information is available at the Stanford Department of Public
Safety, 711 Serra Street.

THE ROLE OF RESIDENCE STAFF PERTAINING TO THE
The role of Resident Assistants and Resident Fellows ("residence staff') at Stanford is principally
educational, advisory, and developmental. It is crucial that students trust their residence staff members
and feel comfortable confiding in them, turning to them freely for assistance whenever they need it.
As role models and as employees and agents of the University, residence staff are expected to comply
with the Controlled Substances and Alcohol Policy themselves. For example, they should not provide
alcohol to minors, nor should they allow University funds under their control to be used in any way
which violates the policy. With regard to the policy, residence staff members are expected to work
with students in the following ways.
As educators, residence staff should help ensure that students are made aware of the health risks
associated with the use and abuse of alcohol and other drugs, with University policy, and with
pertinent California law.
CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES AND ALCOHOL POLICY
As advisors, residence staff should urge sensible party planning and management and help students in
their efforts to abide by that urging.
As community builders, RAs and RFs should work closely with residents to make and maintain an
amiable, comfortable and supportive residential environment.
Resident Assistants and Resident Fellows are not expected to police or monitor the conduct of
students, or to receive or act upon reports of violations. However, they must continue to step in and
excercise responsible guidance any time they are aware of a dangerous situation — that is, a situation
which is threatening to the health or safety of one or more people.
