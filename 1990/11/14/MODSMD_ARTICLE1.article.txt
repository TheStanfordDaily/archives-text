# New alcohol policy released
## Draft document lists consequences for violations 
### Holly Hacker Staff writer 
After weeks of questions and qualms, administra
tors released a clarified version of Stanford's new
alcohol policy today, detailing consequences of viola
tions but still emphasizing individual responsibility.
The Controlled Substances and Alcohol Policy,
which took effect Oct. 1, states that the unlawful
use, possession or distribution of alcohol or drugs is
"prohibited on the Stanford campus or as part of any
of the University's activities."
The draft policy released today also lists conse
quences of violations, outlines the role of residence
staffs and offers guidelines in planning events in
compliance with the new rules. It will take effect at
the beginning of winter quarter.
The policy is printed on the back page of today's
Daily.
While the new polity does not forbid the use of
dorm funds to purchase alcohol, buying alcohol for
underaged drinkers will be a violation.
The draft policy also notes, "The role of resident
assistants and resident fellows at Stanford is princi
pally educational, advisory and developmental."
RAs and RFs "are not expected to police or moni
tor the conduct of students, or to receive or act upon
reports of violations," according to the policy.
Acting Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Diana Con
klin and Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Michael
Jackson wrote the draft policy and submitted it to

Acting Dean of Student Affairs Norm Robinson last
Friday.
After receiving student input on the specifics of
the draft, policy, Conklin and Jackson plan to revise it
and submit a final policy to Robinson Dec. 3.
Under the Drug-Free Schools and Communities
Act, Stanford has to expressly prohibit unlawful con
sumption or possession of illegal alcohol and drugs
on campus to maintain its eligibility for receiving
federal funds.
Conklin said she and Jackson "tried to keep fore
most the University's view of the student as being
responsible for his or her own behavior."
The policy will be enforced "as all other student
conduct matters have been" â€” by residence deans,
the Judicial Affairs Office and police officers, Con
klin said.
"We tried to have this policy be as harmonious as
possible with other existing student conduct poli
cies," she noted.
Explicit sanctions for violations of the alcohol pol
icy have not been outlined. As with other University
policy infractions, "every case is heard separately,"
according to Conklin.
The policy states that "educational and rehabili
tative measures will be the preferred response to
simple infractions," although some alcohol or drug
related behavior may result in expulsion from on
campus housing or the University itself.
Although purchasing alcohol
with dorm funds is not expressly
prohibited, a section outlining the
role of residence staff states they
"should not provide alcohol to
minors, nor should they allow
University funds under their con
trol to be used in a way which vio
lates the policy."
Also included in the draft pol
icy are guidelines for "event plan
ners." The policy suggests that
planners open events only to
invited guests, preferably not in
high school, and emphasize
responsibility to all individuals
sponsoring events.
Conklin said she and Jackson
presented the suggestions in
response to students and resi
dence staff members who asked
for "concrete guidelines" in
upholding the alcohol policy at
parties and other events.
"I'm hopeful that we'll have
something people will not only
like, but will be able to get guid

ance from and live with," Robin
son said.
Students and residence staffs
had the chance to voice their opin
ions and recommendations for
implementing the policy at open
meetings with Robinson. Individ
uals and students groups were
also encouraged to submit writ
ten suggestions to Conklin and
Jackson.
Conklin said the policy reflects
written suggestions and com
ments made at the meetings, as
well as "30 years' experience" at
Stanford between Jackson and
herself.
While Conklin said that "it was
really important to hear from the
community," she added, "I would
like to have seen less lamenting
[of] the policy" and "more tangi
ble suggestions."
