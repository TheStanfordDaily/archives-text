# More than sitting in a library:
## Program gives students taste of research 
### Amy Winkelman 
A common misconception about university
research is that it only involves graduate stu
dents in poorly-funded scientific pursuits. At
Stanford, this myth is exactly what Under
graduate Research Opportunities is trying to
dispel.
Last year, the program gave research grants
totaling $192,000 to 225 students. The pro
gram's offerings include 40 mayor grants of up
to $2,500 each year, as well as 75 small grants
of up to $500.
But when the Undergraduate Research
Opportunities program began in 1974, it con
sisted of no more than a file cabinet and a few
clipboards. Back then, the program was
designed only to match undergraduates with
faculty doing research in their area of interest.
In 1985, a $300,000 gift from the Firestone
Foundation allowed the program to offer
grants to four times as many students. In addi
tion, the program was made a Centennial
Campaign fund raising objective, earning $5.5
million for undergraduate research to date.
Unharmed by budget cuts
Funds raised for the program are placed in
an endowment, 4.5 percent of which can be
spent annually on student grants.
Recent budget cuts have left the program
virtually untouched because its funding comes
mostly from of the endowment, not the Uni
versity operating budget, according to pro
gram director Laura Selznick.
However, in the effort to streamline Uni
versity operations, the program recently
moved from the Office of the Dean of Under
graduate Studies to the School of Humanities
and Sciences. Because of the restructuring,
Undergraduate Studies will be eliminated next
year.
Selznick said she likes the move because the
program is closer to both faculty and students,
allowing her to work better with the research
programs in the individual academic depart
ments.
This streamlining has only bolstered a
strengthening and growing University pro
gram, Selznick said. "[Undergraduate
Research Opportunities] has been reaf
firmed."
Building robots, studying paper making
Students have received grants for every
thing from building a biped robot to visiting
Japan to study the ancient art of paper mak
ing.
Senior Anne Kauffman used a mtgor grant
to study theater production in the Soviet
Union last summer. Kauffman, who is major
ing in Slavic Languages and Literature and
Drama, went to Leningrad and Moscow to

research the original production of
Mayakovsky's play "The Bedbug."
Kaufmann studied photos, reviews, the
director's personal notes and letters housed in
the Bakrushin Theater Archives in Moscow.
"[The program is] a great way to motivate peo
ple and encourage research," Kaufmann said.
Because of his grant, Doug Stewart was
able to spent the summer of 1989 in Brazil
studying firsthand the colonization and defor
estation of the Amazon rain forest. The grant
also helped pay for travel and living expenses.
Not all grants are used for research in such
faraway places. Senior Louis Jackson used
funds from his grant to fly to Washington D.C.
to do research at the Library of Congress for
his honors thesis on the history of the Black
Panther party.
"[The program] gives the opportunity to
research one's own culture and heritage,"
Jackson said.
Not just reaaearch libraries
But research doesn't necessarily mean writ
ing papers and visiting libraries. Senior Debbie
Wicks used a mtgor grant to write "One Bad
Apple," a full-length musical that will be per
formed at Stanford in February.
Wicks, a music major, traveled to a national
music camp in Interlochen, Mich., where she
worked with other musicians on the musical's
score. The camp's symphony also performed
the score.
Grant funding helped Wicks cover her
expenses this summer while she worked on the
project. Wicks said the program "was wonder
ful and very supportive," adding that program
office workers plan to attend the February per
formance.
Selznick said undergraduate research pro
vides excellent opportunities to students who
want to get as much as they can from their
Stanford education.
Because most students do their research
over the summer, many grants also help
replace summer earnings students lose by
doing the research.
Currently, students on financial aid receive
$900 to replace summer earnings. "I don't
think it will increase in the near future,"
Selznick said. Although $900 may not be
enough for everyone, she said, the amount
makes students "more able to do research
than they would otherwise."
Other available grants
Undergraduate Research Opportunities
also offers Mellon Minority Undergraduate
Fellowships for minority students who intend
to complete doctorates eventually. The pro
gram aims to increase the number of people of
color with doctorates by providing a $20,000
incentive, Selznick said.

Past grants havs given stu
dents opportunities to study
the ancient art of paper mak
ing in Japan and to examine
firsthand the colonization and
deforestation of the Brazilian
rain forests.

Irvine Foundation awards for research in
humanities, social sciences and engineering
are also available to financially-eligible minor
ity students. These awards pay students the
equivalent of term-time earnings — what they
would earn from a job during the quarter — so
they can do research during the academic year.
For sophomores, the Chappell-Lougee
Scholars program awards two grants a year to
help students M get started" in research. Recip
ients can receive up to $2,500 to replace lost
earnings or to fund research. Financial need is
one criterion for the award.
Selznick said these grants are for students
who "have particular promise." Research top
ics do not have to be as defined as those for
general undergraduate research grants, she
said, but "students with a more focused pro
ject in mind have a better chance."
Grant criteria
The application process for getting a
research grant has three parts. A written pro
posal must be submitted detailing the plan for
the research, a budget and the student's back
ground.
Students must also submit an unofficial
transcript with their applications. Selznick
said, for the most part, grades are only used to
judge good academic standing and a "commit
ment to getting things done." The program
does not look favorably on incomplete or no
credit marks, she added.
Selznick also said she has not seen much
correlation between grades and quality of
research. "I've seen students turn around —
research can make a difference academically,"
she said.
Finally, the student must get a faculty spon
sor and letter of recommendation for the pro
ject.
Before applying for a grant, however, stu
dents must come up with a strong research
topic, Selznick said. "Anything could be wor
thy of research and jumping in with both feet
to do something new" is the best way to start,
she said.
In the end, Selznick said, students become
"turned on by doing something they love."

Irvine Foundation awards for research in
humanities, social sciences and engineering
are also available to financially-eligible minor
ity students. These awards pay students the
equivalent of term-time earnings — what they
would earn from a job during the quarter — so
they can do research during the academic year.
For sophomores, the Chappell-Lougee
Scholars program awards two grants a year to
help students M get started" in research. Recip
ients can receive up to $2,500 to replace lost
earnings or to fund research. Financial need is
one criterion for the award.
Selznick said these grants are for students
who "have particular promise." Research top
ics do not have to be as defined as those for
general undergraduate research grants, she
said, but "students with a more focused pro
ject in mind have a better chance."
Grant criteria
The application process for getting a
research grant has three parts. A written pro
posal must be submitted detailing the plan for
the research, a budget and the student's back
ground.
Students must also submit an unofficial
transcript with their applications. Selznick
said, for the most part, grades are only used to
judge good academic standing and a "commit
ment to getting things done." The program
does not look favorably on incomplete or no
credit marks, she added.
Selznick also said she has not seen much
correlation between grades and quality of
research. "I've seen students turn around —
research can make a difference academically,"
she said.
Finally, the student must get a faculty spon
sor and letter of recommendation for the pro
ject.
Before applying for a grant, however, stu
dents must come up with a strong research
topic, Selznick said. "Anything could be wor
thy of research and jumping in with both feet
to do something new" is the best way to start,
she said.
In the end, Selznick said, students become
"turned on by doing something they love."
A common misconception about university
research is that it only involves graduate stu
dents in poorly-funded scientific pursuits. At
Stanford, this myth is exactly what Under
graduate Research Opportunities is trying to
dispel.
Last year, the program gave research grants
totaling $192,000 to 225 students. The pro
gram's offerings include 40 mayor grants of up
to $2,500 each year, as well as 75 small grants
of up to $500.
But when the Undergraduate Research
Opportunities program began in 1974, it con
sisted of no more than a file cabinet and a few
clipboards. Back then, the program was
designed only to match undergraduates with
faculty doing research in their area of interest.
In 1985, a $300,000 gift from the Firestone
Foundation allowed the program to offer
grants to four times as many students. In addi
tion, the program was made a Centennial
Campaign fund raising objective, earning $5.5
million for undergraduate research to date.
Unharmed by budget cuts
Funds raised for the program are placed in
an endowment, 4.5 percent of which can be
spent annually on student grants.
Recent budget cuts have left the program
virtually untouched because its funding comes
mostly from of the endowment, not the Uni
versity operating budget, according to pro
gram director Laura Selznick.
However, in the effort to streamline Uni
versity operations, the program recently
moved from the Office of the Dean of Under
graduate Studies to the School of Humanities
and Sciences. Because of the restructuring,
Undergraduate Studies will be eliminated next
year.
Selznick said she likes the move because the
program is closer to both faculty and students,
allowing her to work better with the research
programs in the individual academic depart
ments.
This streamlining has only bolstered a
strengthening and growing University pro
gram, Selznick said. "[Undergraduate
Research Opportunities] has been reaf
firmed."
Building robots, studying paper making
Students have received grants for every
thing from building a biped robot to visiting
Japan to study the ancient art of paper mak
ing.
Senior Anne Kauffman used a mtgor grant
to study theater production in the Soviet
Union last summer. Kauffman, who is major
ing in Slavic Languages and Literature and
Drama, went to Leningrad and Moscow to

research the original production of
Mayakovsky's play "The Bedbug."
Kaufmann studied photos, reviews, the
director's personal notes and letters housed in
the Bakrushin Theater Archives in Moscow.
"[The program is] a great way to motivate peo
ple and encourage research," Kaufmann said.
Because of his grant, Doug Stewart was
able to spent the summer of 1989 in Brazil
studying firsthand the colonization and defor
estation of the Amazon rain forest. The grant
also helped pay for travel and living expenses.
Not all grants are used for research in such
faraway places. Senior Louis Jackson used
funds from his grant to fly to Washington D.C.
to do research at the Library of Congress for
his honors thesis on the history of the Black
Panther party.
"[The program] gives the opportunity to
research one's own culture and heritage,"
Jackson said.
Not just reaaearch libraries
But research doesn't necessarily mean writ
ing papers and visiting libraries. Senior Debbie
Wicks used a mtgor grant to write "One Bad
Apple," a full-length musical that will be per
formed at Stanford in February.
Wicks, a music major, traveled to a national
music camp in Interlochen, Mich., where she
worked with other musicians on the musical's
score. The camp's symphony also performed
the score.
Grant funding helped Wicks cover her
expenses this summer while she worked on the
project. Wicks said the program "was wonder
ful and very supportive," adding that program
office workers plan to attend the February per
formance.
Selznick said undergraduate research pro
vides excellent opportunities to students who
want to get as much as they can from their
Stanford education.
Because most students do their research
over the summer, many grants also help
replace summer earnings students lose by
doing the research.
Currently, students on financial aid receive
$900 to replace summer earnings. "I don't
think it will increase in the near future,"
Selznick said. Although $900 may not be
enough for everyone, she said, the amount
makes students "more able to do research
than they would otherwise."
Other available grants
Undergraduate Research Opportunities
also offers Mellon Minority Undergraduate
Fellowships for minority students who intend
to complete doctorates eventually. The pro
gram aims to increase the number of people of
color with doctorates by providing a $20,000
incentive, Selznick said.

Past grants havs given stu
dents opportunities to study
the ancient art of paper mak
ing in Japan and to examine
firsthand the colonization and
deforestation of the Brazilian
rain forests.
