# Vandals take break for Big Game week
## 
### Howard Libit Staff writer 
Blue and yellow paw prints
and red spray paint have been
remarkably absent from both
Stanford and UC-Berkeley this
week, as Big Game week van
dalism appears to be at one of
its lowest levels in recent years.
Police at Stanford and UC-
Berkeley speculate that in
creased security at the two
campuses has deterred the
crime typically associated with
Big Game week.
Neither department re
ported any incidents of vandal
ism this week.
Stanford police added extra
officers to patrol the campus
this week during the hours
from dusk to dawn. The addi
tional force is composed of off
duty police and special events
officers used at football games.
Many of the special events
officers concentrate on pre
venting vandalism by UC-
Berkeley students, according to
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer.
UC-Berkeley campus police
also added several off-duty offi
cers to patrol during Big Game
week, which will culminate
Saturday when Stanford plays
its final football game of the
season in Berkeley's Memorial
Stadium.
However, additional police
are not intended solely to pre
vent campus vandalism,
according to UC-Berkeley

Police Sergeant Maureen
O'Connell.
"During Big Game week,
there are a lot more people on
campus and students hold sev>
eral events," O'Connell
said. "This requires a few more
officers to both attend the
events and patrol the campus.
But it is closer to standard
operating procedure."
During Big Game week,
Stanford police stop and ques
tion people they believe might
be vandals, Niemeyer said.
"[The special events offi
cers] are stopping anyone who
is acting suspicious," Niemeyer
said. "There is no value to
increased patrols if they cannot
question people who are walk
ing around campus at 2 a.m."
In past years, UC-Berkeley
students have worn Stanford
shirts and carried backpacks in
order to avoid being stopped on
campus while attempting to
commit vandalism, he said.
"Historically, there is a large
problem with vandalism," said
O'Connell. "It has really
caused a lot of damage."
So far some traditional Big
Game pranks have been noted
around the Bay Area. Almost
two weeks ago, the large,
cement letter C on the hill
behind Memorial Stadium was
painted red. The letters Sand
U in the large "South San
Francisco" sign visible from
northbound Highway 101 were
also painted red recently.
