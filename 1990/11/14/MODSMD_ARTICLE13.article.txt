Florida shoots down Koalas
FREMONT, Calif. (AP) — Popular juice-fla
vored mineral water made by Koala Springs
International were pulled from shelves across
the country yesterday after tests found traces
of a cancer-causing substance.
The Australia company nationally head
quartered in Fremont recalled hundreds of
thousands of bottles and cans of the drink
after the Florida Health Department found
samples with 11 to 18 parts per billion of ben
zene.
That level of benzene exceeds the 1 part per
billion maximum for bottled water under
Florida law, said Dr. Richard Hunter, Florida's
assistant health officer for environmental
health.
Hunter said the level of benzene allowed for
water in Florida is based on the assumption
that people would drink two liters a day for a
70-year period. The standard is set at a level
that officials believe would not result in extra
cases of cancer in a million people if they drink
that amount.
"Clearly, Koala Springs is not the only
source of water for people, so I think there is
not a significant health risk for people," he
said.

Couple busted by doped up cash
ROSEVILLE, Calif. (AP) — The pungent
odor of marijuana wafting through a bank in
this Sacramento suburb led to the arrest of a
physician and his wife on suspicion of selling
the drug out of their home.

that the aroma came from a small bundle of
cash that was traced to Ann Patwell, 32, and
her husband, Wayne Patwell, 34.
