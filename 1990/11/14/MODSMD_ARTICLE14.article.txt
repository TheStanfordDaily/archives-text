# Feds favored certain S&Ls

WASHINGTON (AP) - Federal regula
tors gave preferential treatment as far back
as the mid-1980s to some troubled savings
and loans whose executives sat on regional
regulatory boards, a document released
yesterday indicates.
Such favoritism discouraged bank exam
iners and slowed recognition of the magni
tude of the financial troubles of S&Ls, Rep.
Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., said at a con
gressional hearing.
"Sirens were sounding in the basement
of the (Federal Home Loan Bank Board)
throughout 1988, but the regulators just
plugged their ears," he told the House Bud
get Committee's Task Force on Urgent Fis
cal Issues, of which he is chairman.
A spokesman for the Office of Thrift
Supervision, the new agency that took over
S&L regulation from the Federal Home
Loan Bank system, said the system has
improved significantly since S&L bailout
legislation was enacted last year.
"There has been a decided move to
improve examination and supervision" of
S&Ls, William Fulwider said in a telephone
interview. He declined to comment directly
on the task force's allegations.
Fulwider cited stricter capital require
ments for S&Ls, regulatory action against
conflicts of interest, and an increased num
ber of federal examiners.
The task force released a summary of a
1988 government review of the Federal
Home Loan Bank of Dallas, which was
responsible for regulating S&Ls in Texas,
Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi and New
Mexico.
The regulatory boards were the boards
of directors of the regional Federal Home
Loan Banks, institutions controlled by
S&Ls that both supervised and lent money
to the thrifts.
The review of the Dallas FHLB by an
outside "peer review team" of government
examiners indicates that senior federal
S&L regulators knew losses were deliber
ately concealed by the thrifts with the

approval of local examiners.
The review also found conflicts of inter
est that resulted in preferential treatment
of some S&L executives who also were
directors of the Dallas FHLB.
In one case, local examiners removed an
auditor who questioned the chairman of an
Arkansas S&L who was a director of the
Dallas FHLB, according to the task force
document. M.R. Godwin, chairman of First
Federal Savings of Arkansas, had been
accused of defrauding shareholders.
The Dallas bank board "had been more
interested in helping a fellow director"
than in removing Godwin from his First
Federal Savings post to protect sharehold
ers, the document states.
According to the document, preferential
treatment also apparently was given to:
Allan D. Myers, chairman of Olney Savings
Association and a director of the Dallas
FHLB; Shelby Smith, a director and former
employee of the Dallas FHLB; Robert Met
tlen, a director of Lamar Savings Associa
tion and a previous director of the Dallas
FHLB; and James Ward, chairman of Com
mercial Federal Savings Bank, Louisiana,
and a director of the Dallas FHLB.
The review found that the Dallas FHLB
failed to do financial examinations of nearly
200 S&Ls in a timely manner. The Dallas
regulators delayed taking some supervisory
actions and failed completely to take others,
the task force document states.
It also accuses the Dallas bank board of:
—"Terrible" monitoring of S&Ls' finan
cial condition.
—Weak supervision and inflated finan
cial ratings of S&Ls in the face of "tremen
dous growth, high-risk lending, poor capital
and insider abuse."
—An overly bureaucratic, multilayered
decision process that slowed proper super
vision.
Bailout legislation passed by Congress
last year to rescue the S&L industry could
ultimately cost taxpayers $500 billion,
according to some estimates.
