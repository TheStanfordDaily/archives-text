# NATO kept doomsday weapons dumps during Cold War

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -
Stockpiles of arms and explosives for
hundreds of resistance fighters trained
to counter a Soviet invasion were hid
den in Western European countries
from the 1950s until recently, officials
said yesterday.
News of the network raised con
cerns about whether some operatives
with access to the weapons caches may
have been involved in terrorist acts.
A former Belgian army intelligence
official and former network member,
Andre Moyen, said yesterday at least
six arms caches were spread over the
countryside until two months ago.
In the Netherlands, Prime Minister
Ruud Lubbers told Parliament yester
day that the government is running a
secret guerrilla organization similar to

the groups whose existence was
recently discovered in Italy and Bel
gium.
He said in a letter that successive
prime ministers and defense chiefs
always preferred not to inform other
Cabinet members or Parliament on the
secret organization.
Former Dutch Defense Minister
Henk Vredeling said the group set up
arms caches around the Netherlands
for sabotage purposes.
Speculation spread in Italy whether
the local network was connected to
right-wing terrorist attacks in the
early 1970s to keep Communists out of
power.
Belgium is investigating any links
between its local branch and indis
criminate killings in supermarkets in

the early 1980s, which killed at least
28 people. Authorities have linked the
murders to right-wing terrorism.
Italian Prime Minister Giulio
Andreotti brought the clandestine
organization, known under the code
name Gladio (Italian for "sword") in
Italy, to light last month.
The operation, set up in the early
1950s during the Cold War, was
designed to be an underground resis
tance network in case of a Soviet inva
sion in Western Europe. It mostly pre
pared communication networks,
escape routes and sabotage plans, offi
cials said this month.
Recent disclosures expand the scope
of the network that operated in many
countries in the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.

Many European politicians were
caught off guard, saying they knew
nothing about it. This raised questions
whether the network played by demo
cratic rules.
The German newspaper Die Welt
said pistols, grenade launchers, explo
sives and radios were stored in secret
caches for German resistance fighters.
It said U.S. agents masterminded the
network in cooperation with intelli
gence agencies of various European
lands in setting up what it called
"Operation Gehlen."
"The operation was expanded to all
of Western Europe by 1959," including
neutral Sweden and Switzerland, it
said. Die Welt telexed copies of its
report in advance of today's publica
tion.
