# Senators demand an emergency session

WASHINGTON (AP)-Key senators in both par
ties asked President Bush yesterday to convene an
emergency session of Congress for what Republican
leader Bob Dole called a "put-up-or-shut-up" vote on
administration policies in the Persian Gulf.
The White House quickly opposed the idea as
unnecessary. "There is no war,' said presidential
press secretary Marlin Fitz water.
Senate Democratic Leader George Mitchell, too,
showed little enthusiasm for the idea. He said that a
special session would be justified only if the presi
dent makes a decision to go to war and that Bush's
moves so far amount only to threats — which he can
issue without permission from Capitol Hill.
The requests for an emergency session reflected
increasing concern among lawmakers of both parties
over the prospect of war in the Persian Gulf, where
230,000 American troops are deployed as part of an
international force.
The president last week announced a major
buildup in the region to provide an "offensive mili
tary option" for use against Saddam Hussein and
Iraqi forces occupying Kuwait. U.S. strength is
expected to swell by 200,000 troops.
Sen. Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who
chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, said
"Congress ought to speak on this subject" before
any offensive military action by the United States.
Dole and House GOP Leader Robert Michel of Illi
nois had lunch with Bush at the White House to dis
cuss whether to call Congress back to vote on what
could amount to a declaration of war, although the
resolution would not be worded that bluntly.
Afterward, Michel sought to calm congressional
fears. "The president is not itching for a fight and he
is not trigger happy," Michel said, adding that White
House policy remains one of keeping up pressure on
Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.
On whether Congress should reconvene to debate
U.S. gulf policy, he said only, "If it's necessary, it's
necessary."
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., added his
voice to those calling for a special session, but for a
different reason — to approve a resolution barring
offensive moves by the president.
"President Bush's escalation of the confrontation
has put the country on a headlong course toward war
without giving sanctions a fair chance to work," he
said. "Silence by Congress now is an abdication of
our constitutional responsibility and an acquies
cence in war."
Asked whether war is inevitable, Kennedy said:
"I hope it would not be. I fear that it is."
Normally, when Congress adjourns for the year it
can be called back into session only by the president.
However, anticipating developments in the gulf, law
makers this year gave their own leaders authority to
call them back in the adjournment resolution passed
as Congress left town Oct. 28.
Dole and Sen. Richard Lugar, a senior Republican
member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said
Bush should call the emergency session to give law

makers a vote on administration actions that Lugar
said have put the nation "on a collision course" with
Saddam in the gulf.
"I think it ought to be put up to the Congress —
put up or shut up," Dole said. "And if they say no,
well, then they say no. And then the president has to
decide whether to go it alone."
Asked if lawmakers would be called back, Dole
said in an interview:
"I think we will be. I don't know when, but in my
view it's going to be before the first of the year."
The Kansas senator, noting increased criticism of
Bush from congressional Democrats, said he was not
suggesting that the president seek a formal declara-;

tion of war from Congress.
Lugar said Bush needs the undiluted support of
Congress and the American people for his actions in
the gulf.
"So long as Saddam Hussein and the rest of the
world have any doubt about the unified resolve of
the United States in this matter, the chances for mis
calculation and tragic mistakes loom much too
large," he said.
Not only would such a vote indicate the support of
Americans for Bush's commitment of force, it could
help persuade allies of U.S. seriousness and stem
what Lugar called "an erosion at the edges" of the
„ international alliance against Iraq, he said.
