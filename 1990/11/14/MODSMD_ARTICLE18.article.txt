# Soviet cities will begin rationing
## 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) — Moscow and Leningrad
appeared headed yesterday toward rationing meat,
butter, flour and other necessities as fears of a hun
gry winter spread through the country's two largest
cities.
Reformist Mayor Anatoly Sobchak urged
Leningrad City Council to adopt a broad rationing
program, saying it was the only way the city would
get through winter without hunger and popular
unrest.
"Democracy is facing a hungry winter," Sobchak
said. "It is crucial for democracy to survive this win
ter. The only solution I see is to introduce ration
cards now."
Moscow's City Council also has been considering
rationing plans. Soviet newspapers say it is likely to
begin allocating meat, butter and flour Dec. 1.
Both Moscow and Leningrad already ration sugar,
allowing two kilograms (4.4 pounds) per resident a
month. Leningrad also has a monthly ration of one
bottle of vodka and two bottles of wine per adult.
Moscow now allots 10 packs of cigarettes per person
a month.
Residents can buy additional supplies in the pri
vate markets that have sprung up under President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's economic reforms. But the
prices are beyond most budgets.
Fresh beef costs about two rubles ($3.60) a kilo
gram (2.2 pounds) in state-owned stores, where it is
hard to find. It is plentiful in private markets, but
costs 20 to 40 rubles ($36 to $72) per kilogram.
For an average worker who earns $450 a month,
that is roughly 2 1/2 to four days' wages.
Moscow has about 9 million residents, and
Leningrad nearly 5 million. Both are shopping hubs
that attract hundreds of thousands of visitors bent
on buying items they cannot find in their home vil
lages and towns.
Officials in Moscow and Leningrad accuse other
regions of refusing to send supplies to the mcgor
cities, in part because of resentment over the rela
tively prosperous lifestyle of city dwellers.
Also, the big cities have begun requiring residen
tial identification cards for purchases of some
clothes, food, furniture and other goods. People in
outlying villages retaliate by withholding agricul
tural produce.
Sugar rationing became common in the Soviet
Union during Gorbachev's unpopular anti-alcohol
campaign in 1986-87. Demand for sugar, used in
making moonshine, doubled in many regions, and it
disappeared from store shelves. Local officials issued
coupons for the right to buy a certain amount per
month.
As the economy weakened, rationing widened in
some smaller cities to include meat, vodka, butter
and similar staples. Such allocations are common in
northern Russia, where food supplies become thin
when the growing season ends and winter sets in.
Until now, Moscow and Leningrad have bucked
the trend.
"The entire country is introducing ration cards,
and we unfortunately cannot avoid it either,"
Sobchak told the Leningrad City Council.
Soviet television showed shoppers in Leningrad
waiting in long lines for ordinary items like butter,
milk and chocolate.
Leningrad residents would get monthly coupons
for five packs of cigarettes.
