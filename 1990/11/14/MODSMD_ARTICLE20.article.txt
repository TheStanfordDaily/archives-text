ASSU polls need to be
more representative of
the views of students

IT IS ADMIRABLE THAT THE
ASSU attempted last week to
gauge student opinion on many
important campus issues through
its first student poll of the year.
However, more steps need to be
taken to ensure the poll's results
are truly representative of stu
dents' views.
The easiest and most obvious
improvement would be a more sta
tistically sound poll. Several of the
previous survey's questions could
have been misconstrued or were
misleading, according to some crit
ics, including a Statistics Depart
ment consultant.
It would take little time, and less
effort, to have an expert analyze
poll questions in the future. Polls
always have some degree of error,
but starting with a correctly writ
ten survey increases the ASSU
poll's accuracy and credibility.
The poll should also be viewed as
a means to gauge student opinion,
not to judge whether or not it is
"correct.'' Council of Presidents
member Jamie Green said she was
"shocked and outraged at the num
ber of students who have been
offended" by the new domestic
partners policy.
As poll organizers, the COP and
others involved should not pass
judgment on the results, but
rather present them to the commu
nity to decide.
According to some students, one
question concerning the new dis
tribution requirement proposal
was particularly problematic.
When asked if they approved of the
changes, respondents could
choose: too much change, correct

change, unfamiliar with change or
too little change.
Some students may have
answered "too little change," not
because they want more additions
to the current requirements, but
because they think the current
requirement system is inherently
flawed and needs work.
Another glitch in the current
polling procedure is that all
responses are voluntary. Those
who are interested in the issues
take the five minutes to fill out the
questionnaire, but many students
simply skip it. The fact that those
polled are self-selected may have
skewed the results.
The poll also neglected a signifi
cant number of students, specifi
cally graduate students and stu
dents living off campus. Of the
3,000 poll respondents, only 300
were graduate students — about 4
percent of the graduate student
population.
Although organizers said the
majority of issues included in the
poll focused on undergraduate
admissions, the domestic partners
policy is surely more of a graduate
concern.
For the next poll, the ASSU
should increase participation by
bringing surveys to more graduate
residences and by making ques
tionnaires more available, perhaps
by setting up a table at noon in
White Plaza the week of the poll.
Better yet, the ASSU may want
to switch its format to a phone poll
in which, for instance, every 10th
student in the Student Directory is
called. This setup is more random
and would reach an equitable per
centage of graduate students and
students living off campus.
However implemented, future
polls will not increase in signifi
cance if students do not take the
time to respond. The ASSU is mak
ing an effort, but they need stu
dent support in this initiative.
