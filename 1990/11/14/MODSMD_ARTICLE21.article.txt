Americans are beginning to view war with Iraq as inevitable

THE OTHER NIGHT, I decided to
go hear William Sloane Coffin,
National President of
SANE/Freeze Campaign for Global Secu
rity, speak on "America's Response to the
Middle East Crisis."
I'm glad that I did.
It was obvious that Coffin had spent
months researching, reflecting upon and
discussing the issues at hand, and it was
obvious that I have much to learn.
Coffin spoke realistically and
humanely, yet even in his careful words
of moral reflection, "if" sometimes
became "when." No longer was the spec
ulation of war an "if," but a "when," as
in "when the body bags start to come
back."
The Stanford Middle East Action Net
work passed out slips of paper with
information about an Emergency
Response Plan if the United States
attacks Iraq. These seem to be strong
signs of anticipation, especially from
those out there who are working the
hardest to oppose policies of aggression.
A great number of American citizens

are beginning to think that war with
Iraq seems inevitable.
As I sat in Cubberley Auditorium,
realizing my own avoidance of the issues
and my own recent mental resignation to
hesitant predictions of war, I wasn't
greatly surprised by the small number of
students in the audience. The audito
rium was by no means full, and most of
those in attendance were local commu
nity residents.
Similarly, another talk I went to, as a
part of the Stanford-sponsored Middle
East Teach-in, was not well-attended by
the community and downright poorly
attended by students.
I think that it is fantastic that an
event at Stanford brings in people from
the community, but what about our
more immediate student community?
Twenty-four hour news programs like
CNN continually pump images of Ameri
can soldiers in the Middle East into liv
ing rooms across the country. America
sits and watches, waiting. Today's col
lege-age generation has never really lived
through a war.

Is our sitting and waiting a sign of
disbelief, apathy, or inability to even
relate to the concept of weir?
The media gives us images of an
enemy, the brutality and immorality of
people whose ways we were not at all
ready to castigate until our oil supply
was threatened.
President Bush continues to heighten
his own propaganda, hypocritically
pointing the "finger of principle" at a
man who rules for the sake of power
itself.
If the brutality of Saddam Hussein is
implicitly worse than that of Hitler, does
Bush therefore have us in for a war that
will be as quickly and easily fought as
World War II?
I wasn't around for that one, but
when suddenly the soldiers are my age or
even younger, a certain uneasiness
begins to settle in on top of my cynicism.
Relatively speaking, there is little cov
erage given to those who are speaking
out intelligently about the effects and
implications of American aggression
against Iraq. Instead, recent surveys and

predictions of the worst broadcast a per
suasive consensus that unilateral Ameri
can involvement is inevitable and per
haps even called for.
Against such a current of thought, it
is very difficult to believe that my voice
or any of the millions of voices as small
as mine could change the progression of
what soon may become the events of his
tory.
I wondered where the voices of our
moral leaders were, until I heard one
speak to a sparsely-seated auditorium at
Stanford. I wonder how much of us
really know about the issues.
I wonder if we are asking the right
questions or if we are asking questions
at all. I wonder how our newly-elected
politicians will join the dialogue.
Will they sit and wait as it seems the
majority of those whom they represent
are doing? I wonder if it will come to
"when the body bags start to come back"
before we really start to use our own
small voices.
