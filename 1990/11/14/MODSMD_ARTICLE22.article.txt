# ASSU poll was flawed and not representative
## 
### 
Before anyone chooses to view the
recent ASSU poll results as representa
tive of student opinion, he or she should
consider several serious flaws in the sur
vey.
The most conspicuous defect is that
the polls were not made readily available
to students living in fraternities and off
campus; they were distributed through
ASSU dormitory representatives, who
have no analog outside of the dorms.
Another problem was the method of
poll-taking: students were given surveys
which they had the option to fill out and
return. Many students, of course, did not

on the returned polls-

return their surveys, and the assessors of
the poll erroneously assumed that those
unrepresented opinions were the same as
those on the returned polls. The factor of
non-response is a major source of bias in
any optional survey.
A fair poll must give every person in
the population the same chance of being
chosen for the sample. In a poll of

Stanford students, this can be Accom
plished by calling random students
(every tenth in alphabetical order, for
example) and recording their opinions.
Students not contacted might feel left
out, but the results of the poll would be
representative of student opinion, and
that should be the ASSU's primary goal.
