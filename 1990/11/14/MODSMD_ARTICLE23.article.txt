Hurray for the Department of
Athletics ban of the Stanford Band! Its
brand of humor is totally out of place at
an event as serious as a football game.
Besides, there will now be more oppor

tunities to hear the truly inspirational
yell leaders. Now if the Athletics
Department would just get rid of pre
game tailgaters, it would be so much eas
ier to find a parking space
