## With jobs and respect for all

SO YOU MADE IT to prestigious
Stanford! The Admissions Office
believed in you. And now your fam
ily, your prospective employers, society
and even you yourself are probably more
likely to believe in you.
Such expectations of success tend to be
self-fulfilling, justifying investments of
guidance, training and other scarce
resources in your development.
But what about the so-called "forgot
ten half" — the half of America's high
school graduates who do not go to college?
Our society is undermining its own
future by failing to believe and invest in
them, according to several recent reports.
Compared to our mqjor economic com
petitors, the United States has done piti
fully little to train the non-college bound.
America believes in winners. It also
tends to believe that natural ability more
than educational investment explains
achievement. We track students from an
early age, and essentially discard those
who do not succeed academically
They endure a watered-down curricu
lum which stresses "life survival skills"
— such as how to balance a checkbook —
but does not teach the vocational and
technical skills that would render them
employable and thereby give them some
income to balance in the first place.
It reminds one of Martin Luther
King's statement that it is a cruel thing to
tell a bootless man to pick himself up by
his bootstraps.
These bootless graduates have met
society's low expectations. Left to sink or
swim without adequate skills, most floun
der through low-wage, dead-end jobs or

head to unemployment lines or even
prison.
According to the U.S. Office of Tech
nology Assessment's report "Worker
Training," Germany does not leave its
non-college bound to fend for themselves,
but rather administers a formal appren
ticeship program that provides over 60
percent of its entry-level workers with
three years of integrated training both in
class and on the job.
This makes for a supportive transition
from school to work between the ages of
16-19, when attitudes toward work are
formed.
Recognizing the importance of publicly
acknowledging and respecting vocational
achievement, Germany and Japan also
certify skill levels through exams.
According to a report of the Commis
sion on the Skills of the American Work
force, U.S. high schools must better
address the needs of non-college bound
students. Vocational offerings must be
drastically upgraded and integrated with
academic curricula, through closer collab
oration between employers and schools.
And the school-to-work transition
must be aided through guidance coun
selors who are as concerned with placing
students in jobs as in college, and orga
nized mentor programs which actively
involve members of the current work
force in the guiding of their successors.
Continued national failure to take
such steps not only damages the
prospects for the forgotten individuals,
but drags down the productivity and com
petitiveness of the economy as a whole,
with negative consequences for every

one's standard of living.
So you need not be a bleeding-heart,
tax-and-spend liberal to favor reforms.
Even growth-oriented, conservative Niet
zschean overmen who scorn the weak and
want to restore America's will to power
should take notice.
With fewer young workers entering
the American work force, we can no
longer afford to neglect the training needs
of half of them.
Reforms will demand increased
resources, but not just from the govern
ment. Germany's apprenticeship pro
gram, for example, is jointly financed by
government, business and labor.
MBAs heading out to conquer corpora
tions should also note that in Germany
and Japan, which boast higher worker
productivity, pay narrower differentials
between the college educated and the
non-college educated than in the United
States.
But ultimately such tangible changes
will not come without a shift in attitudes:
toward restoring respect for our fellow
citizens who do not go to college but have
an equally important role to play in our
collective future.
