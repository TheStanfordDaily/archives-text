Stanford's ability to laugh at itself is being stifled by business interests

Yes, this is another letter
about the controversy surrounding
the Stanford Band. But no, this is
not another letter about the Oregon
game halftime or the subsequent suspen*
sion of the Band.
This letter is about the Athletics
Department's plans for the Band's
future.
Please remember that I cannot speak
for the Band or its members, but only as
an aging trombone player who is more
than weary of one-sided "compromises."
Until recently, the Athletics Depart
ment has reviewed the halftime (and
pregame) shows for home games during
the week before the game.
This has become common knowledge
during the past weeks. What is not so
widely known is that this policy came
into effect only last year.
Until then, the Band was left to its
own better judgment in determining
what would be acceptable to put on the
field.
Granted, this earlier policy led to a

few questionable shows in the last 20
years. It is now being treated as a fore
gone conclusion that the Athletics
Department will, at the very least, want
to exert some sort of control over field
shows for away games in the same way
as it now controls the home perfor
mances.
Though the reaction to the most
recent controversy has been varied (as
noted by Alan Cummings), the reaction
(from most of the Band members as well
as the rest of the student body) to this
expected change in policy has been rela
tively low-key.
Even those who do not see why there
has been such a fuss over the Oregon
halftime seem to think that it would be
perfectly reasonable for the Athletics
Department to assume this added mea
sure of control over the Band.
After all, the Athletics Department
really holds all the cards anyway, doesn't
it? They could ban the Band forever if
they wanted. (I will refrain from pushing
this point any further in the interest of

keeping at least some of my friends.)
It was suggested in a Daily editorial
that this added control over the Band
should be instituted, not because the
Oregon show was really unacceptable,
but in order to avoid anything worse
from appearing on the field.
Anyone who accepts this suggestion is
missing the point entirely If the Athlet
ics Department has final say over the
field shows, not only will truly unaccept
able material (whatever that is) be cen
sored, but nothing even remotely ques
tionable will make it out of the Athletics
Department's office alive.
The support that the Band has
received from the press over the Oregon
show would not be possible, since the
press would never learn of any of the
show ideas that the Athletics Depart
ment has canned.
And where does that leave the Band?
A show like the one at Oregon, one
which almost every Bay Area account
has termed inoffensive, would not even
make it past the planning stages.

I can think of no shows
that the Band has per
formed since the 1986
debacle that have been
even remotely offensive,
until this recent controver
sy.

The point is, not only will you never
see another offensive show, but you will
never again see a show which anyone in
the Athletics Department views as dam
aging to its financial interests.
And this brings up the largest prob
lem with the proposed policy. Since the
Athletics Department has had final say
over the shows for home games, the
Band and its management have lived in
constant fear of their own shadows.
No one can even consider presenting
an idea that might offend the Athletics

Department (regardless of whether the
idea would offend anyone else).
This has stifled the ability of the Band
to present a funny show, since every idea
must first be indexed against the latest
appropriateness edict issued from the
Athletics Department.
When the Band is not funny, people
invariably question the creativity of its
members; they don't stop to think that
there might be many compelling ideas at
the bottom of an Encina Hall trash can.
I can think of no shows that the Band
has performed since the 1986 debacle
that have been even remotely offensive,
until this recent controversy. But still,
the Athletics Department takes more
and more control over the activities of
the Band with each passing year.
I think it is a sad commentary on the
state of this University that its ability to
accept friendly jibes at itself and its sur
roundings is being stifled in the interest
of big-business athletics.

years. It is now being treated as a fore
gone conclusion that the Athletics
Department will, at the very least, want
to exert some sort of control over field
shows for away games in the same way
as it now controls the home perfor
mances.
Though the reaction to the most
recent controversy has been varied (as
noted by Alan Cummings), the reaction
(from most of the Band members as well
as the rest of the student body) to this
expected change in policy has been rela
tively low-key.
Even those who do not see why there
has been such a fuss over the Oregon
halftime seem to think that it would be
perfectly reasonable for the Athletics
Department to assume this added mea
sure of control over the Band.
After all, the Athletics Department
really holds all the cards anyway, doesn't
it? They could ban the Band forever if
they wanted. (I will refrain from pushing
this point any further in the interest of

keeping at least some of my friends.)
It was suggested in a Daily editorial
that this added control over the Band
should be instituted, not because the
Oregon show was really unacceptable,
but in order to avoid anything worse
from appearing on the field.
Anyone who accepts this suggestion is
missing the point entirely If the Athlet
ics Department has final say over the
field shows, not only will truly unaccept
able material (whatever that is) be cen
sored, but nothing even remotely ques
tionable will make it out of the Athletics
Department's office alive.
The support that the Band has
received from the press over the Oregon
show would not be possible, since the
press would never learn of any of the
show ideas that the Athletics Depart
ment has canned.
And where does that leave the Band?
A show like the one at Oregon, one
which almost every Bay Area account
has termed inoffensive, would not even
make it past the planning stages.

I can think of no shows
that the Band has per
formed since the 1986
debacle that have been
even remotely offensive,
until this recent controver
sy.

The point is, not only will you never
see another offensive show, but you will
never again see a show which anyone in
the Athletics Department views as dam
aging to its financial interests.
And this brings up the largest prob
lem with the proposed policy. Since the
Athletics Department has had final say
over the shows for home games, the
Band and its management have lived in
constant fear of their own shadows.
No one can even consider presenting
an idea that might offend the Athletics

Department (regardless of whether the
idea would offend anyone else).
This has stifled the ability of the Band
to present a funny show, since every idea
must first be indexed against the latest
appropriateness edict issued from the
Athletics Department.
When the Band is not funny, people
invariably question the creativity of its
members; they don't stop to think that
there might be many compelling ideas at
the bottom of an Encina Hall trash can.
I can think of no shows that the Band
has performed since the 1986 debacle
that have been even remotely offensive,
until this recent controversy. But still,
the Athletics Department takes more
and more control over the activities of
the Band with each passing year.
I think it is a sad commentary on the
state of this University that its ability to
accept friendly jibes at itself and its sur
roundings is being stifled in the interest
of big-business athletics.
