# An onion, not a band, should cause tears to come to your eyes
## 
### 
In response to the Nov. 9 letter by
Elizabeth Eng, I must challenge her
attack on the the Stanford Band.
Elizabeth, I am sure you meant no
harm in comparing our University and
our Band to those of the Midwest, but I
feel your entire reasoning is faulty.

I am not a band member, nor an
expert in such affairs, but I sincerely
doubt the validity of the qualifications
which you use to judge marching bands.
I don't feel you should rely on a
marching band to "make tears come to
your eyes and leave a lump in your
throat." You can leave such physical
stimulations to peeling raw onions and
swallowing whole potatoes.
In addition, I question your assump
tion that a band can inject spirit into a
home crowd when the "home team is los
ing 28-0 at the half."
I think a more effective solution to

this miracle-wish is an additional six
pack and a dose of gullibility serum for
each and every Stanford fan.
This will surely remove the biting
cynicism prevalent throughout the Stan
ford student body and will also convince
the home crowd that our team can come
back from such a deficit.
And when you continue your band
bashing, claiming that "the combination
of music and marching is an art and has
nothing to do with politics or rebellion,"
I think you overlook the responsibility of
artists to inform their society of its
shortcomings and to influence their pub

lie's opinions.
Your restriction of the focus of art
would rebuke Picasso for painting
"Guernica," Mickiewicz for writing
"Forefather's Eve" and Dickens for
authoring "Great Expectations."
Each of these highly renowned artists
created widely appreciated works which
address controversial issues of politics or
of rebellion. So too can the artistic per
formances of our Band.
I too "want our football team to be
the best," and I too believe "we need
some pride."
However, I don't believe following the

mundane march-step of other marching
bands will aid our football program or
instill pride in the heart of each Stanford
student.
Our coaches and our team will prove
their own capabilities on the field (BEAT
CAL!). And it goes without saying that
we already have a proud and wonderful
tradition which creates a veritable
plethora of school spirit here at Stan
ford: it is the one, the only, the truly
incomparable Band.
