Two Stanford professors were awarded
the National Medal of Science, the
nation's highest science award, by Presi
dent Bush in a ceremony at the White
House yesterday.
Philosophy Prof. Patrick Suppes and
Computer Science Prof. John McCarthy
were among 20 scientists nationwide who
received the medal. Neither could be
reached for comment.
Bush called the recipients "trpilblazers
... who press the very limits of their
fields."
The recipients were chosen by the

presidential Committee on the National
Medal of Science based on achievements
in their respective fields and on their
overall contribution to the development
of scientific thought.
Suppes was a main force in developing
computer programs as teaching aids for
all levels of education across the United
States.
"He is a pioneer in the field of com
puter education," said Philosophy
Department Chair John Perry.
Psychology Prof. Gordon Bower, a col
league, called Suppes "a renaissance man
(with) an exceedingly rare breadth of
knowledge and interest" in philosophy,
mathematics, science and education.

Bush called the recipients
'trailblazers... who press
the very limits of their
fields.'

"He has been an exceedingly impor
tant intellectual figure in philosophy,"
Bower said.
Suppes uses his computer programs to
teach 12 courses a year, including an
undergraduate class in logic which about
3,000 students have taken. He owns
Computer Curriculum Corporation in

Palo Alto, which markets his teaching
programs.
"We are all tremendously proud of
him," Perry said.
McCarthy was involved in the early
development of Stanford's computer sci
ence department. "He was one of a hand
ful of key figures defining what computer
science was all about," said Computer
Science Chair Jeffrey Ullman.
McCarthy coined the term "artificial
intelligence" and pioneered the study of
trying to make computers copy human
thought processes.
He also originated time-sharing, which
allows several people to use the same
computer at once. "The whole concept is

due to McCarthy," said Ullraan.
"He has combined ideas from formal
logic and made it effective on computers,"
said Computer Science Prof. Terry Wino
grad.
Fifteen Stanford faculty members
have been Medal recipients, as well as two
Hoover Institution affiliates. The
National Medal of Science was estab
lished by Congress in 1959 to recognize
outstanding contributions in the sciences.
"It's a fabulous honor, one of the great
est things that could ever happen to a
philosopher or scientist," Bower said.
