## Faster, safer test for leukemia will be valuable in research 
### Chris Patil 
A new method of rapidly
detecting the genetic abnormality
that causes one form of leukemia
may soon become a valuable tool
in research of the disease, Stan
ford pathologists say.
The procedure, called fluores
cent in situ hybridization, is more
accurate than two older tests for
chronic myelogeneous leukemia,
according to a study published last
month.
Chronic myelogeneous leuke
mia is one of the most common
forms of blood cancer found in
U.S. patients.
The protocol makes possible for
the first time genetic analysis of
patients M on a cell-by-cell basis,"
explains Douglas Tkachuk, a post
doctoral scholar at the School of
Medicine and chief author of the
study.
The new procedure can provide
results within 24 hours — much
faster than previous techniques,
which require cell cultures and
chromosomal preparations that
may take weeks.
Another advantage of the pro
tocol is its use of nonradioactive
dyes. Older procedures label
probes with radioactive isotopes
that threaten health and require
time-consuming safety measures.
DNA, found in each cell of a
person's body, contains all of an
individual's genetic information.
Human DNA is organized in 23
pairs of large molecules called
chromosomes.
Chronic myelogeneous
leukemia (CML) is characterized
by a specific chromosomal translo
cation, an abnormality that
results from the exchange of DNA

segments between the ninth and
22nd chromosomes.
This aberration is present in 95
percent of CML patients.
Because "most of the molecular
biology of [CML] is already
known," the disease was an ideal
model for the development of fluo
rescent in situ hybridization,
Tkachuk said.
To locate the translocated sites,
the protocol uses small pieces of
DNA, called probes, that individu
ally correspond to only one of the
translocated segments.
The probes are labeled with flu
orescent dyes that allow scientists
to visually distinguish them: a red
dye for the gene usually found on
the ninth chromosome, and a
green dye for the sequence usually
found on the 22nd chromosome.
The probes are "hybridized," or
bound to the cell DNA, which can
then be illuminated with ultravio
let light and examined through a
microscope.
Healthy sample DNA will show
red and green dots distributed
randomly around the nucleus.
However, the translocation
that occurs in CML patients' DNA
brings the probe binding sites
close together, and the dots will
often appear as a single yellow
dot.
The dot pattern makes genetic
analysis of patients so simple that
researchers might eventually be
able to computerize the process,
Tkachuk said.
He suggested that a computer
could measure the average dis
tance between dots in a large
number of cells over a very short
time, increasing test accuracy and
saving researchers time.
After more refinement of the
technique, it may eventually be
used in clinical diagnosis of CML.
However, Tkachuk is quick to
point out that at present the new
method is simply a tool for further
research of the disease.
"The work right now is in a
developmental stage. The real
limiting factor is the sensitivity of
the test," he explained. At the pre
sent level of accuracy, 1 in 100
healthy cells appear abnormal.
However, the proportion of
false-positive results will drop
after further research, Tkachuk
says.
The scientists expect fluores
cent in situ hybridization to have
broad applications.

One advantage of the new technique is its
use of nonradioactive dyes; older procedures
employ radioactive isotopes that threaten
health and require time-consuming safety
measures.

"The technique can be applied
to other diseases in which chro
mosome aberrations are present,
including other leukemias, lym
phomas and rarer tumors such as
Ewing's sarcoma," said Tkachuk.
Use of the technique for other
diseases awaits only the identifi
cation and cloning of their
translocated sites. "It's just a mat
ter of time," Tkachuk says.
Michael Cleary, Stanford
pathologist and Tkachuk's collab
orator, has already cloned the
aberrant genes for lymphoblastic
leukemia.
The procedure could also be

used in cure-related research. Sci
entists could use the probing tech
nique to monitor the success of
drugs designed to kill abnormal
cells, Tkachuk said.
Further development of the
protocol will attempt to optimize
conditions for a third color of fluo
rescent probe.
The protocol should eventually
be available commercially as a
diagnostic kit. Lawrence-Liver
more National Laboratory, where
the research was originally
performed, owns the patent for
the procedure.

diseases awaits only the identifi
cation and cloning of their
translocated sites. "It's just a mat
ter of time," Tkachuk says.
Michael Cleary, Stanford
pathologist and Tkachuk's collab
orator, has already cloned the
aberrant genes for lymphoblastic
leukemia.
The procedure could also be

used in cure-related research. Sci
entists could use the probing tech
nique to monitor the success of
drugs designed to kill abnormal
cells, Tkachuk said.
Further development of the
protocol will attempt to optimize
conditions for a third color of fluo
rescent probe.
The protocol should eventually
be available commercially as a
diagnostic kit. Lawrence-Liver
more National Laboratory, where
the research was originally
performed, owns the patent for
the procedure.
A new method of rapidly
detecting the genetic abnormality
that causes one form of leukemia
may soon become a valuable tool
in research of the disease, Stan
ford pathologists say.
The procedure, called fluores
cent in situ hybridization, is more
accurate than two older tests for
chronic myelogeneous leukemia,
according to a study published last
month.
Chronic myelogeneous leuke
mia is one of the most common
forms of blood cancer found in
U.S. patients.
The protocol makes possible for
the first time genetic analysis of
patients M on a cell-by-cell basis,"
explains Douglas Tkachuk, a post
doctoral scholar at the School of
Medicine and chief author of the
study.
The new procedure can provide
results within 24 hours — much
faster than previous techniques,
which require cell cultures and
chromosomal preparations that
may take weeks.
Another advantage of the pro
tocol is its use of nonradioactive
dyes. Older procedures label
probes with radioactive isotopes
that threaten health and require
time-consuming safety measures.
DNA, found in each cell of a
person's body, contains all of an
individual's genetic information.
Human DNA is organized in 23
pairs of large molecules called
chromosomes.
Chronic myelogeneous
leukemia (CML) is characterized
by a specific chromosomal translo
cation, an abnormality that
results from the exchange of DNA

segments between the ninth and
22nd chromosomes.
This aberration is present in 95
percent of CML patients.
Because "most of the molecular
biology of [CML] is already
known," the disease was an ideal
model for the development of fluo
rescent in situ hybridization,
Tkachuk said.
To locate the translocated sites,
the protocol uses small pieces of
DNA, called probes, that individu
ally correspond to only one of the
translocated segments.
The probes are labeled with flu
orescent dyes that allow scientists
to visually distinguish them: a red
dye for the gene usually found on
the ninth chromosome, and a
green dye for the sequence usually
found on the 22nd chromosome.
The probes are "hybridized," or
bound to the cell DNA, which can
then be illuminated with ultravio
let light and examined through a
microscope.
Healthy sample DNA will show
red and green dots distributed
randomly around the nucleus.
However, the translocation
that occurs in CML patients' DNA
brings the probe binding sites
close together, and the dots will
often appear as a single yellow
dot.
The dot pattern makes genetic
analysis of patients so simple that
researchers might eventually be
able to computerize the process,
Tkachuk said.
He suggested that a computer
could measure the average dis
tance between dots in a large
number of cells over a very short
time, increasing test accuracy and
saving researchers time.
After more refinement of the
technique, it may eventually be
used in clinical diagnosis of CML.
However, Tkachuk is quick to
point out that at present the new
method is simply a tool for further
research of the disease.
"The work right now is in a
developmental stage. The real
limiting factor is the sensitivity of
the test," he explained. At the pre
sent level of accuracy, 1 in 100
healthy cells appear abnormal.
However, the proportion of
false-positive results will drop
after further research, Tkachuk
says.
The scientists expect fluores
cent in situ hybridization to have
broad applications.

One advantage of the new technique is its
use of nonradioactive dyes; older procedures
employ radioactive isotopes that threaten
health and require time-consuming safety
measures.

"The technique can be applied
to other diseases in which chro
mosome aberrations are present,
including other leukemias, lym
phomas and rarer tumors such as
Ewing's sarcoma," said Tkachuk.
Use of the technique for other
diseases awaits only the identifi
cation and cloning of their
translocated sites. "It's just a mat
ter of time," Tkachuk says.
