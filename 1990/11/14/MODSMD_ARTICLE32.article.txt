## Faster, safer test for leukemia will be valuable in research 
### Chris Patil 
A new method of rapidly
detecting the genetic abnormality
that causes one form of leukemia
may soon become a valuable tool
in research of the disease, Stan
ford pathologists say.
The procedure, called fluores
cent in situ hybridization, is more
accurate than two older tests for
chronic myelogeneous leukemia,
according to a study published last
month.
Chronic myelogeneous leuke
mia is one of the most common
forms of blood cancer found in
U.S. patients.
The protocol makes possible for
the first time genetic analysis of
patients M on a cell-by-cell basis,"
explains Douglas Tkachuk, a post
doctoral scholar at the School of
Medicine and chief author of the
study.
The new procedure can provide
results within 24 hours â€” much
faster than previous techniques,
which require cell cultures and
chromosomal preparations that
may take weeks.
Another advantage of the pro
tocol is its use of nonradioactive
dyes. Older procedures label
probes with radioactive isotopes
that threaten health and require
time-consuming safety measures.
DNA, found in each cell of a
person's body, contains all of an
individual's genetic information.
Human DNA is organized in 23
pairs of large molecules called
chromosomes.
Chronic myelogeneous
leukemia (CML) is characterized
by a specific chromosomal translo
cation, an abnormality that
results from the exchange of DNA

segments between the ninth and
22nd chromosomes.
This aberration is present in 95
percent of CML patients.
Because "most of the molecular
biology of [CML] is already
known," the disease was an ideal
model for the development of fluo
rescent in situ hybridization,
Tkachuk said.
To locate the translocated sites,
the protocol uses small pieces of
DNA, called probes, that individu
ally correspond to only one of the
translocated segments.
The probes are labeled with flu
orescent dyes that allow scientists
to visually distinguish them: a red
dye for the gene usually found on
the ninth chromosome, and a
green dye for the sequence usually
found on the 22nd chromosome.
The probes are "hybridized," or
bound to the cell DNA, which can
then be illuminated with ultravio
let light and examined through a
microscope.
Healthy sample DNA will show
red and green dots distributed
randomly around the nucleus.
However, the translocation
that occurs in CML patients' DNA
brings the probe binding sites
close together, and the dots will
often appear as a single yellow
dot.
The dot pattern makes genetic
analysis of patients so simple that
researchers might eventually be
able to computerize the process,
Tkachuk said.
He suggested that a computer
could measure the average dis
tance between dots in a large
number of cells over a very short
