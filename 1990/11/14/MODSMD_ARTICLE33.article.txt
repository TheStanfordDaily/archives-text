# Stanford invention lets you conduct an orchestra — by yourself

Editor' 9 note: This is the first
in a series of three articles on
music innovations and inventions
at Stanford.
Have you ever daydreamed
about conducting your own
orchestra? Maybe you just want to
step into your high school band
director's shoes for a day.

Well, listen up, all you aspiring
Toscaninis — Radio Batons can
make it possible.
An instrument that combines
conventional conducting with
computers and synthesizers,
Radio Batons were developed by
Max Mathews of the Center for
Computer Research in Music and
Acoustics.
Along with a computer and a
synthesizer, the instrument con
sists of two batons resembling
timpani mallets that are waved
over a sensing "box" that moni
tors the motions of the batons.
Using the batons, one can con
duct any piece of music (meaning
a sequence of notes as they appear
on a composer's score) that has
been entered into the computer.

The conductor can vary the phras
ing, volume, meter and length of
notes.
It's every conductor's dream —
a perfectly responsive orchestra.
Mathews was inspired to
develop Radio Batons by Pierre
Boulez, a renowned French con
ductor who wanted to conduct
pre-recorded music so as to coor
dinate it with a live performer.
While Mathew's batons don't
exactly do this, they do open up a
whole new field of opportunity for
expression, and Mathews believes
they have a lot to offer both pro
fessional and amateur musicians.
"Radio Batons are especially
useful for amateurs without tech
nical ability," said Mathews.
By automating the pre-deter
mined parts of music, Radio
Batons eliminate such problems
as wrong notes and tuning errors
which plague amateur musicians.
"More energy can then be
devoted to shaping notes; there is
more attention devoted to expres
sion," Mathews said.
A far cry from the sterile beeps
and buzzes one often associates
with synthesized music, Radio
Batons are "an instrument more
human than traditional instru
ments," believes Mathews.
The control system for The
Batons makes them quite versa
tile.
The control parameters fire set
up in a grid-like system. The beat
ing of the right baton controls the
meter, while the left baton can
move in a north-south direction to
control volume and in an east

west direction to control vibrato.
Based on the programming, a
conductor may also cue and cut off
specific instruments, make one
instrument more prevalent than
another and shape phrases by
adding extra "taps" with the
baton.

"It's an orchestra more precise
than a live one under the direction
of a conductor," says Mathews.
Any score that entered into the
computer can be interpreted using
Radio Batons.
Mathews himself likes all types
of music, and conducts everything

from Mozart to Chopin using his
high-tech batons.
Mathews studied violin as a
child and still plays "occasionally"
today. Trained as an electrical
engineer, he began working with
computers in the 1950'5. Mathew«
has spent much of his time as

researcher at Bell Laboratories.
Radio Batons have been about
five years in the making, and
three prototypes currently exist.
While these early models cost
upwards of one thousand dollars
