# Nobel laureate shares prize, credit
## Taylor's group confirmed quark model of particle physics 
### Michael Malione 
Physics Prof. Richard Taylor
of the Stanford Linear Accelera
tor Center joined the ranks of
the world's most renowned sci
entists when he received the
Nobel Prize in Physics last
month.
But in an interview with The
Daily, Taylor downplayed the
experiment that qualified him
for the award.
Although his work with sub
atomic particles in the early '70s
confirmed the quark model of
particle physics and paved the
way for advances in several sci
entific disciplines, Taylor called
his experiment itself "extremely
simple and straightforward."
"People have different con
cepts of what's hard and what's
easy," he added.
The quark model predicted
that protons and neutrons —
previously believed to be funda
mental particles of matter — are
actually composed of smaller ele
ments called quarks.
Taylor's group of about 30
scientists proved the physical
existence of quarks in matter by
taking an extensive series of
electron energy measurements.
The group was led by Taylor
and two colleagues, Jerome
Friedman and Henry Kendall,
now at MIT. Friedman and
Kendall shared the physics prize
with Taylor.
The reason it took the
academy so long to recognize
Taylor's work is "because [Tay
lor, Friedman and Kendall]
never went on the lecture series,
they never campaigned and they
diffused the credit throughout
their group," said Michael Rior

dan, a researcher at the center
who worked in Taylor's group.
"The academy spends more
money figuring out who to
award the prize to than the
actual amount of the prize,"
which is about $700,000, said
Taylor.
Conducted from 1967
through 1975, Taylor's experi
ment involved extensive mea
surements of electron scattering
by first protons and later neu
trons.
Taylor's group fired a beam of
high-energy electrons from the

accelerator at protons and mea
sured the energy distribution of
the electrons as they scattered
after the collisions.
By varying the energy of the
incident beam and measuring
the energy of scattered electrons
at different angles from it, they
were able to reconstruct a com
plete picture of the interactions
between the colliding protons
and electrons.
Through this process, they
found that the proton consists of
smaller particles that are bound
tightly together.

This observation required
electron energies high enough to
produce what are called inelastic
collisions.
If the energies of the colliding
electrons are below a certain
threshold, the protons behave as
if they are single particles, and
the collisions are said to be elas
tic.
Elastic collisions reveal noth
ing new about the structure of
the proton.
However, if the electrons have

enough energy, protons can get
deformed to a higher energy state
or even shattered altogether in
the collisions.
When this happens, the energy
spent deforming or shattering the
protons is reflected in the reduced
energy of the scattered electrons.
It is these inelastic collisions
that reveal the presence of
smaller particles bound together
in the protons.
As more refined experiments
and studies of the data were
made, it became possible to deter
mine the physical properties of
these particles, and Taylor and
his colleagues found that the data
matched up with the values pre
dicted by the theoretical quark
model.
The quark model had been pro
posed independently several years
earlier by the physicists Murray
Gell-Mann and George Zweig as a
way of explaining the large num
ber of subatomic particles that
had been discovered in high
energy physics experiments.
The theory "was in disrepute,"
however, because it required
quarks to have fractional charges,
according to Riordan.
Further experiments with neu
trons — in addition to protons —
provided additional confirmation
of the quark model. And as the
mountain of evidence built up, it
became clear that a physical basis
for the quark model had been
found.
As a result, Taylor's group has
been credited with the discovery
of the quark.
Regarding future technological
applications of the quark theory,
Taylor said "Nobody can see
ahead. Understanding leads to
application."
Around the turn of the century
"Ernest Rutherford said that
nuclear power was moonshine,"
Taylor pointed out.
This discovery has led to the
development of quantum chromo
dynamics, a theory explaining the
forces between quarks, which in
turn has led to great progress in
the areas of cosmology and
nuclear physics.
In nuclear physics, quantum
chromodynamics explains several
observed reactions that in the
past were complete mysteries.
