# Bugs investigate human reproductive behavior

Q % How far away from
• humans, evolution-wise, is
it oefore the monthly reproduction
cycle becomes the yearly "heat"
cycle?
A .The Bugs consulted a num
• ber of experts and they all
told us that seasonal fertility
depends more on where an animal
lives than how closely it is related
to humans.
And unlike many other human
traits (designer clothing, a written
language, and wholesale environ
mental destruction) we share
year-round fertility with a num
ber of other animals.
Among primates, those that
live in harsh climates have very
narrow yearly periods of fertility,
while those that live in the tropics
(where the seasonal changes are
less severe) are reproductively
active for a large part of the year.
When fertility is seasonal, it is

usually timed such that the young
are weaned when food is most
abundant. This is easy to under
stand, since it is important for
young animals to have a large food
supply when they're starting out
on their own.
This climate-dependence is
found in many other animals, and

even in non-mammals. For exam
ple, snakes that live in Canada
only mate during a few weeks of
each year, while their tropical rel
atives are fertile for several
months.
So, for most animals, it is their
environment and life-style and
not their evolutionary relatives
which dictate when they are fer
tile.
Humans are an exception
because we can control our envi
ronment and care for our young.
So it doesn't matter when the chil
dren are weaned and women can
be fertile all year long. One excep
tion is people living in very harsh
climates (Like the Inuits in the
frozen north.) where childbirth is
limited to certain seasons, but
that may be a learned behavior
rather than instinct.
The key take-home message for
all animals (even humans) is that
the tropics are definitely the best
place for doing the wild thing all
year long.

,/ use the metric system in
Vy • my science classes, but what
eve\r happened to the United
States going metric ?
A, Although 98 percent of the
• world's countries officially
use the metric system, the United
States has the dubious honor of
standing with other high-tech
countries like Liberia and Burma
to be the sole defenders of the
British inch/pound system.
Australia, Canada and even
Great Britain came to their senses
and abandoned this antiquated
system in favor of metric over 10
years ago.
Strange as it may seem, there
was a time when Congress could
agree on an important issue with
out weeks of farting and snorting.
Under these unusual circum
stances, they passed the Metric
Conversion Act of 1975. However,
they made the act purely volun
tary, and the public was too igno
rant or too stubborn, so conver
sion faltered.
Today, scientists and multina

tional corporations in the U.S.
routinely use the metric system,
as do pharmacists, drug dealers,
and General Motors (except for
their speedometers). But, you'll
still get strange looks if you ask
for a kilogram of bananas at Safe
way. Hope still remains for the
rest of the country as more and
more manufacturers produce
metric products in an effort to
compete internationally.
Competition with foreign coun
tries finally prompted Congress to
pass the Omnibus Trade and
Competitiveness Act of 1988.
Although this act compels the gov
ernment to use the metric stan
dard by 1993, we Science Bugs
will be surprised if the govern
ment actually wakes up to this sci
entifically sound system of mea
surement.
