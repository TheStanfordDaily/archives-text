# AIDS treatment tests more flexible
## Rapid research advances alter clinical-trial process for new treatments 
### Chris Patil 
Scientific and social aspects of
the AIDS epidemic have forced an
evolution in the way new treat
ments for the disease are tested,
according to Thomas Merigan,
director of the Center for AIDS
Research at the School of
Medicine.
The swift pace of AIDS
research requires many scientists
to extensively alter their testing
procedures several times each
year, Merigan asserted last week
in the New England Journal of
Medicine.
Such rapid progress provides
an impetus to shorten the tradi
tional phases of the clinical-trial
process for new treatments, he
elaborated.
Normally, researchers test new
treatments in three phases, Meri
gan explained in an interview.
"Phase I trials are designed to
test the safety of the new treat

ment, Phase II to test its efficacy,
and Phase 111 to compare it with
standard treatment in a larger
number of patients selected to be
as homogeneous as possible," he
said.
"The protocol is developed
before the trial begins, and there
are usually no changes in it as the
trial progresses," Merigan said.
However, according to Meri- *
gan, AIDS patients and activist
groups have pushed for flexibility
in clinical-trial structure to assure
patients of the best care available
at each stage of an experimental
study. .
Consequently, some scientist*
have begun to alter the previously
rigid pattern of clinical trials.
"It's not surprising what has
happened in light of intense
activist pressure and patient
sophistication ... our research
practice has changed to meet their
expectations," Merigan said.
"Because the research is rapid,

AIDS patients and
activist groups have
pushed for flexibility
in clinical-trial struc
ture to assure
patients of the best
care available.

protocols must be changed in mid
stream to ensure that none of the
limbs of a trial involves treatment
known to be inferior," he wrote.
"In designing protocols, you
really want to achieve what I call a
balanced-coin situation," Merigan
said.
"When you have an unan
swered treatment question and
need to compare approaches, you
want to create a situation in
which you have every reason to
believe that either way the coin
falls in randomization would be

equally beneficial for the patient,"
he explained.
He cautioned that these
changes ought not threaten the
elements of randomization, con
trol and organization that
researchers must maintain in
clinical trials.
"The challenge for researchers
is to carefully evaluate each of the
changes made during a trial to
make sure meaningful results will
still be obtained," Merigan said.
Merigan sees the new partner
ship of doctors and AIDS patients
in clinical trials as a model that
could be followed by those testing
therapies for other fatal illnesses.
"I predict that this new level of
rapport will come to be the stan
dard of care for patients with all
types of serious diseases," he said.
"For example, I believe patients
with cancer now expect and
receive much more detailed infor
mation about all aspects of their
care."
