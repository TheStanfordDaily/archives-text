# Macintosh facts you won't find under the Apple menu
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
In all likelihood, you've got a pretty
good idea of how to use the Macintosh on
your desk. You know all the mouse tech
niques, you understand the workings of
the Finder, and you're pretty comfortable
working with the applications you use all
the time.
Of course, there are also 10,000 little
things you may or may not know that
could make your time on the Mac a bit
more pleasant and productive. In the fol
lowing, I will provide some that have
come to mind lately and offer you the
opportunity to send in your best Mac tips
for possible inclusion in a future column.
Closing a lot of windows
The desktop has a tendency to become
very cluttered when you open several pro
grams and documents from within fold
ers. There are several ways to close all the
windows at once when you're in the
Finder.
First, you can hold down the option
key while choosing close from the file
menu — the menu then becomes close all.
Alternatively, the same affect can be
obtained by pressing option, command
and w at the same time (the command key
has the four-leaf clover symbol and some

times an apple on it).
Second, if you're running under ver
sion 6.0.3 or later of the system software,
you can click in the close box of a window
while holding down the option key. Like
magic, everything will shut before your
very eyes.
Finally,under system 6.0.4 or later, if
you hold down option while opening a
folder, the parent window of the open
folder will close. For example, if you open
up the "Documents" folder in the "Hard
Disk" window, when the "Documents"
window appears, the "Hard Disk" window
will disappear.
Which version of the system?
The number of Macintosh users who
are using non-recommended versions of
the system software is about equal to the
number of Macintosh users. Because
Apple puts out a new system release with
every machine, there are a lot of systems
out there.
In short, here are the recommended
system versions for the various Macs:
• System 6.0.7 — Classic* and Ilsi*
• System 6.0.5 — Ilfx*, Ilci and
Portable
• System 6.0.4 — 11, Ilex, SE and Plus
• System 6.0.3 — SE/30
The asterisked ones are required: if
you don't use them the computer will not

function properly. The
others are Apple's sug
gested system software
selections. For you, they
might not be the best
choices.
For example, if you're
running a Mac Plus and
don't need version 6.0 or
greater, you should stick
with 5.0. It's smaller,

takes up less memory and never had to be
replaced by seven updates including two
that were canceled before they ever
reached users.
Similarly, if you're running a lot of dif
ferent Macs in the same office or dorm
cluster, perhaps SEs and SE/30s, you
might be best off standardizing on ver
sion 6.0.4 so as to avoid running multiple
systems. While you can mix different sys
tems on the same network, the results are
often unpredictable.
The Mac it not a typewriter
There's a brand new book out there
titled "The Mac is not a Typewriter,"
which explains all about the differences
between the way things were done and
the way things should be down now the
Mac is capable of generating high-quality
typography.
If you don't have time to pick up the

book, here are a few simple
tips:
• Don't use the double
hyphen — to set off a point
you're making. Use the em
dash — it makes a stronger
statement. You can type an
em dash by pressing the
option, shift and hyphen
keys all together.
• Consider abandoning

the double space as well. In typesetting,
you never strike the space bar twice in
succession. If you're doing a paper for
Freshman English it's alright to put two
spaces after each sentence, in a newslet
ter, though, one is enough.
• Curl your quotes. In Microsoft Word
4.0, the easiest way to do this is to turn on
the smart quotes function under "Prefer
ences ..." in the edit menu. It replaces
the foot and inch marks normally gener
ated by the quote key with professional
looking curled quotes that differ on the
open and close end. (Look at any quota
tion in The Daily if you don't know what
I mean.
Curled quotes can be entered manually
from the keyboard by using the bracket
keys in conjunction with the option and
shift keys. If you need to do it this way,
though, it's only worth it on special occa
sions.

The number of Macintosh
users who are using non
recommended versions of
the system software is
about equal to the number
of Macintosh users.

Read the manual
When you're bored some sleepy, rainy
afternoon this winter, thumb through
those pretty books that came with your
computer and software — they may
answer the questions you've always been
asking.
While documentation is of variable
quality, many companies — including
Mac Write 11-maker Claris and its parent
company Apple — produce top-notch
manuals that present a lot of information
in an easy-to-understand format.
These suggestions are merely surface
scratchers. Please send in any of your
own.

Mark Rogowsky is The Daily's computer
systems manager. He finds you can never
know too much about the Macintosh if
you have to support it.
