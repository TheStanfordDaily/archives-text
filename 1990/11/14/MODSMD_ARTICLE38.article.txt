# Stanford to lead global cancer study

Lifestyle factors may increase a man's risk of
prostate cancer, say Stanford scientists who will lead
a U.S. and Canadian research collaboration investi
gating the causes of the disease.
Prostate cancer is the most common and second
most fatal form of cancer among men.
The four year study, led by Alice Whittemore, pro
fessor of health research and policy, will compare
lifestyle factors of men in the Bay Area, Los Angeles,
Honolulu, Vancouver and Toronto.
The researchers will contact 1,500 Chinese,
Japanese, black and white males with prostate can
cer, as well as 1,500 such men without cancer
selected randomly from the general population.
Black males in the Bay Area have the highest
prostate cancer rate in the world, exceeding both
U.S. whites and blacks in Africa, said Whittemore.
Prostate cancer occurs more frequently among
U.S. whites than among Chinese-Americans and
Japanese-Americans.
However, since the cancer rate is higher for these
U.S. immigrants than it is in China or Japan,
researchers expect that lifestyle factors can increase
one's chance of developing prostate cancer.
Several hypotheses involving diet and exercise
patterns are being examined in the study. One such

hypothesis suggests that diets high in fat and low in
vitamin A can predispose an individual to develop
prostate cancer.
Study participants will be interviewed about their
diet and exercise habits, as well as other lifestyle fac
tors, to determine the effects of such variables on
cancer rate.
Blood samples will also be taken from the partici
pants, and analyzed for hormones, genetic factors
and a chemical indicator of prostate cancer called
prostate specific antigen.
In a recent study, Whittemore and colleagues
found that specific lifestyle habits, including a high
fat diet and lack of exercise, were correlated with
higher colorectal cancer rates among Chinese-Amer
ican men as compared to Chinese men living in
China.
The researchers expect similar findings for the
causes of prostate cancer.
This year, an estimated 106,000 American men
will will get prostate cancer, and 30,000 will die.
The study is being funded by the U.S. National
Cancer Institute and the National Cancer Institute
of Canada.
Participating institutes will include University of
Southern California the University of Hawaii, the
Cancer Control Agency of British Columbia and the
University of Toronto.
