## Men's hoops sends Illawarra Hawks down under 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
Just say g'day, g'night and g'bye to
Australia's Illawarra Hawks, who forgot
how to shoot in the first half of last
night's exhibition game with the Stan
ford men's basketball team.
Unfortunately for the Hawks, the
Cardinal didn't have nearly as many
problems picking their defense apart,
and the result was a less-than-thrilling
75-53 Stanford win.

Cardinal 75

Hawks 53

Illawarra, an Aussie club team just
starting a barnstorming tour of the
U.S., came into last night's contest rid
ing the momentum of a near-upset at
California last Friday. The Bears had to
squeak out an 85-84 win with a three-
Eoint prayer from halfcourt at the
uzzer, so Illawarra looked like at least a
half-decent opponent for Stanford.
Or not. Apparently the Hawks spent
the weekend sightseeing just a little too
much, because for 20 minutes last night
they couldn't have thrown the ball into
the Pacific. Against the Cardinal's man
to-man defense, Illawarra shot a horrid
8-for-26 (.307) in the first half, and the
result was a 42-19 halftime hole.
The Hawks outscored Stanford 34-33
in the second half, but the game was
obviously long since over. Stanford, who
shot 33-for-62 (.532), was led by center
Adam Keefe's 22 points (8-for-9 from
the floor, 6-for-7 from the line) and nine
rebounds in only 20 minutes of play.
Andrew Vlahov added 13 points (6-for
-10, 1-for-l) and five rebounds, while
Patric Fairs led the Hawks with 17
points and five boards.
"I think maybe they had a bad
game," Keefe said. "I don't know how
Cal played them — if they had their
starters in or what. We really played
well tonight. We played smooth and we
played together."
"They (the Hawks) have a lot of good
players," Stanford coach Mike Mont
gomery said. "Fairs is a great player. I
thought they'd be competitive, but to be
honest I thought we'd pull away any
way.
"They did a few things that gave us

problems, things we hadn't worked on,"
Montgomery said. "That matchup zone,
and the three-quarter-court pressure
gave us a few problems."
The zone and pressure after each
made basket kept the Hawks in the
game for the first seven minutes, but
that was it. With the score tied at 12,
Stanford sophomore Marcus Lollie
came in to play the point - and the fun
began.
Lollie started things off with a steal
and full-court drive, but missed the
layup. John Patrick was there for the
follow-up to make it 14-12. A patented
Vlahov-to-Deshon Wingate look-out
below alley-oop dunk and a three-point
play by Vlahov made it 19-14, and then
Lollie picked up the evening's sweetest
assist:
Running the fast break after yet
another Hawk miss, Lollie bounced a
pass between three silly-looking defend
ers standing in the paint to Kenny
Hicks, who took a step, soared over the
other two Hawks and laid the ball in
with his left hand from the right side of
the basket.
A Lollie jumper from the foul line
after another break made it 23-14, and
Illawarra called time out.
"Marcus made a big difference: He
changed the tempo and got us running,"
Montgonery said. "He definitely keyed
the fast break.... Marcus has picked us
up on so many occasions, coming off the
bench. That's a real lift for us."
Keefe capped the 11-0 run with a
jumper in the paint, and then took over
the game: a 15-footer, a turnaround
from 10, another wide open shot from
the foul line, a three-point play on a
drive, a layup and a free throw made the
score 42-19, and that was that.
All told, Keefe scored 12 of the Cardi
nal's final 17 first-half points in the
space of seven minutes, putting the
game out of reach. During that stretch
Illawarra managed one measly three
pointer.
"We just defended real well," Mont
gomery said. "I thought that would hap
pen.
Sophomore guard Peter Dukes got
into the defensive swing of things — and
picked up a few votes for the Almost a
Great Pass Award — with a minute to go
in the half. Keefe broke up a pass near
midcourt and then, as Dukes scrambled
for the ball, took off for the basket.
Dukes had two Hawks all over him and

'Marcus made a big
difference: He
changed the tempo
and got us running. He
definitely keyed the
fast break.'
— Mike Montgomery

was facing the wrong way, so he decided
to throw the ball over his head without
looking and hope it would get to Keefe.
The pass/lob was a little short, so
Keefe came back to the ball, took about
45 steps and was fouled going in for the
dunk.
Ugly, but effective.
The Hawks hung tough in the second
half, hitting 11 of their 16 shots, but
kept themselves out of the game with 11
more turnovers. Stanford's starters
played only the first few minutes of the
half, and then Montgomery emptied his
bench. At one point there were two
sophomores and three redshirt fresh
men on the floor.
The inexperience showed, and Mont
gomery wasn't thrilled with what he
saw. "We had a group of kids on the floor
late in the game who are all good play
ers, but they weren't being very compet
itive," Montgomery said. "We need to
elevate our competitive level: I'm not
talking about missed baskets or being
nervous. Nobody was sticking their nose
in there and getting loose balls. . . .
Everyone seemed like they were looking
for someone else to do it."
