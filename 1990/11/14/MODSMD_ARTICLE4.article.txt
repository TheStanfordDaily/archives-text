Although voter turnout was low throughout the
region in the Nov. 6 election, early tallies indicate
that voter participation at Stanford was even lower.
Voting results for Stanford also differed signifi
cantly from the statewide results in several cases. In
particular, Stanford voters overwhelmingly voted for
Democratic gubernatorial candidate Dianne Fein
stein.
According to the Registrar of Voters in San Jose,
voter turnout for Stanford for the gubernatorial
election was tallied at 44.2 percent, a figure which
many observers called startlingly low.
Although 6,596 people were registered to vote at
Stanford, only 2,913 ballots were cast.
Overall voter turnout for Santa Clara County
was low, with a semi-official count of 55.5 percent.
The statewide tally of pollsters was low as well.
Stanford had one of the lowest voter turnouts in
the county, second only to East Palo Alto, where only
about 41 percent of registered voters went to the
polls.
This year's voter participation at Stanford also
decreased compared with previous years. In the last
gubernatorial election in 1986, Stanford showed a
46.1 percent turnout.
As of yesterday, the voter count of still prelimi
nary because it does not include some absentee bal
lots.
Yesterday, the Registrar of Voters gave Stanford's
preliminary figures for several races.
In the race for governor, Feinstein received more
than three times as many votes as overall winner
Republican Pete Wilson. In the race for the 12th con
gressional district of California, Republican incum
bent Tom Campbell received almost 1,378 votes. Fig
ures were not available for Democratic challenger
Robert Palmer.
Stanford voters were almost split on Proposition
128, "Big Green," with only a four vote margin
against the measure. Voters overwhelmingly sup
ported Proposition 130, "Forests Forever, which
would have banned clear-cutting of forests. The
industry countermeasures. Propositions 135 and
138, were also rejected by a large margin.
Proposition 134, the "Nickel-a-Drink" tax, was
supported by a small margin of 36 votes.
One of the few measures
passed in the statewide election,
Proposition 140 on term limits,
was rejected by Stanford voters
by a more than 2 to 1 margin.
Both the Stanford Democrats
and College Republicans
expressed some concern about the
low turnout.
Scott Christofferson, co-chair
of the Stanford Democrats, said
he was disappointed by the low
voter turnout at Stanford,
Christofferson also com
mented on the general sense of
apathy.
The fact that many Stanford
voters are not originally from Cal
ifornia is largely to blame as well,
Christofferson said.
John Abbott, president of the
Stanford Republicans, agreed.
"Most of this school is not from
California," he said, "and are only
here for four years or less. Elec
tions do not hold a very strong
attraction."
