# Arizona MLK Day issue has nothing to do with football
## 
### 
The controversy unfolding over the
Arizona vote to reject a Martin
Luther King Jr. holiday is sad. But
it is also a little irritating. I keep asking
myself one pertinent question, but no one
seems to have the answer: Will someone
please tell me what this issue has to do
with sports?
In case you were buried in mid-term
hell, let me fill you in on the goings-on in
The Land of the Sun. On Election Day, in
a narrow vote, Arizonans rejected a pro
posal to make King's birthday a state hol
iday. Arizona is currently one of only
three states without the holiday.
At this point I was thinking two
things: 1) I thought MLK Day was a
national holiday. Shows how much I
know. 2) What a bunch of morons.
Beyond that, what are the implica
tions? Suspension of highway funds? A
public apology demanded by Coretta
Scott King? National disgrace? I didn't
see any of this, but instead the headlines
were dominated by something far worse:
a "football chilling effect."
Say what?
Yes, a sad commentary on the progress
of civil rights and the historic legacy of
one of our country's leaders, and the
world took notice because of football. I'll
have to check my Britannica, but I don't
think King ever played the game. So what
gives?
No one seems to know, but the 1993
Superbowl in Phoenix is gone. Or "dead,

dead, dead," as Chronicle columnist C.W.
Nevius put it. After some pre-election
warnings, the NFL saw the election
results and pulled out of there faster than
you can say "corporate sponsorship."
But that was only the beginning. The
Fiesta Bowl, played in Tempe, Ariz, on
New Year's Day, suddenly found their
invitations being returned en masse with
a simple "Thanks, but no thanks"
response. There was talk of moving the
bowl to another state. Sunday, officials
finally decided to stick it out in Tempe,
but they've been reduced to slumming for
teams. Louisville, a fringe Top 20 team
that was nowhere a few years ago, will
play a team to be named later, i.e. who
ever's left.
Then there is the hilarious tale of the
Copper Bowl. I say hilarious from the
Stanford point of view, for the folks in
Berkeley are not laughing. Crying maybe.
Poor Cal is so caught between a rock and
a hard place that the Golden Bear is in
danger of being skinned alive.
The Copper Bowl is a relatively new,
cheesy bowl in Tucson, Ariz. No one
except the teams in it ever cared about
the Copper Bowl until last week. Now,
everyone knows about the bowl, and has
an opinion about it. Funny what a little
political controversy can do for your PR.
The Copper had decided to invite Cal if
the Bears beat Oregon last Saturday,
which they (surprisingly) did. The Bears
rejoiced at their first bowl bid in over a

decade...until they began to feel the pres
sure from different areas of society to
reject what they had worked so hard for.
Should they ignore the King holiday vote
and play, or should they take the moral
high ground and refuse the bid?

On the same day that Virginia backed
out of an informal committment to play
in the Fiesta Bowl, the Bear players voted
unanimously to play in the Copper. And
as much as I hate to say it, especially dur
ing Big Game week, Cal Did the Right
Thing.
It's easy to criticize their decision. Too
easy. The NAACP accordingly did so, as
the front page of yesterday's Chronicle
proclaimed. The article quoted the PR
head of the NAACP as saying, "We just
don't understand how a school with the
University of California's tradition could
have made this decision. The university
has always been a campus that has fos
tered humanitarian ideals."
Mr. Williams is missing the point. It's

just a football game. Simply because the
Cal football team plays in a bowl game in
Arizona, it doesn't have to be construed
as a slap in the face to the Berkeley "tra
dition." Where is it written that bowl par
ticipants must endorse the politics of the
state the game is played in?
Individuals certainly have a right to
object. Nobody is forcing them to go to the
game, to spend their money in this state
of questionable race relations. But for the
Cal players, there really isn't any choice.
The goal of any college team is to play in
a bowl game. Unlike Virginia, who had
the Sugar Bowl as a backup option, there
is no other bowl for Cal. It's the Copper or
nothing.
The Bears' decision should not be seen
as a case of giving in to the temptation of
the money and prestige of a bowl game.
Instead, they were making a statement by
refusing to bow to the pressure to reject
the bid. They were in effect stating,
"Look, this is a football decision, not a
racial relations decision. It would be
unfair to make ourselves end our fans
suffer for what some voters decided about
the political merits of a state holiday."
Or, as I said earlier, "What does this
have to do with sports?"
Let the NFL pull their showcase out of
Arizona. Cal's decision is positive in that
it further establishes the (albeit tenuous)
division between college and pro sports
that has to exist for the system to work.
These are juat college kids, not business

It's time to take a step
back, leave the bicker
ing to the real politi
cians, and play the
game.

men or politicians.
Sports are already too political anyway.
Nevius's column compared this issue
with the controversy last summer over
Shoal Creek Country Club and the Pro
fessional Golf Association. That too was
about racism, and it dominated the sports
page headlines with political sniping and
posturing. Further back we have the var
ious Olympic boycotts and massacres. It's
time to take a step back, leave the bicker
ing to the real politicians, and play the
game.
Besides, Cal will need the Copper Bowl
to go out a winner and erase the bad feel
ings of the loss they are going to suffer
this Saturday. You heard it here first:
Stanford, 25-12. See you at the game.

The controversy unfolding over the
Arizona vote to reject a Martin
Luther King Jr. holiday is sad. But
it is also a little irritating. I keep asking
myself one pertinent question, but no one
seems to have the answer: Will someone
please tell me what this issue has to do
with sports?
In case you were buried in mid-term
hell, let me fill you in on the goings-on in
The Land of the Sun. On Election Day, in
a narrow vote, Arizonans rejected a pro
posal to make King's birthday a state hol
iday. Arizona is currently one of only
three states without the holiday.
At this point I was thinking two
things: 1) I thought MLK Day was a
national holiday. Shows how much I
know. 2) What a bunch of morons.
Beyond that, what are the implica
tions? Suspension of highway funds? A
public apology demanded by Coretta
Scott King? National disgrace? I didn't
see any of this, but instead the headlines
were dominated by something far worse:
a "football chilling effect."
Say what?
Yes, a sad commentary on the progress
of civil rights and the historic legacy of
one of our country's leaders, and the
world took notice because of football. I'll
have to check my Britannica, but I don't
think King ever played the game. So what
gives?
No one seems to know, but the 1993
Superbowl in Phoenix is gone. Or "dead,

dead, dead," as Chronicle columnist C.W.
Nevius put it. After some pre-election
warnings, the NFL saw the election
results and pulled out of there faster than
you can say "corporate sponsorship."
But that was only the beginning. The
Fiesta Bowl, played in Tempe, Ariz, on
New Year's Day, suddenly found their
invitations being returned en masse with
a simple "Thanks, but no thanks"
response. There was talk of moving the
bowl to another state. Sunday, officials
finally decided to stick it out in Tempe,
but they've been reduced to slumming for
teams. Louisville, a fringe Top 20 team
that was nowhere a few years ago, will
play a team to be named later, i.e. who
ever's left.
Then there is the hilarious tale of the
Copper Bowl. I say hilarious from the
Stanford point of view, for the folks in
Berkeley are not laughing. Crying maybe.
Poor Cal is so caught between a rock and
a hard place that the Golden Bear is in
danger of being skinned alive.
The Copper Bowl is a relatively new,
cheesy bowl in Tucson, Ariz. No one
except the teams in it ever cared about
the Copper Bowl until last week. Now,
everyone knows about the bowl, and has
an opinion about it. Funny what a little
political controversy can do for your PR.
The Copper had decided to invite Cal if
the Bears beat Oregon last Saturday,
which they (surprisingly) did. The Bears
rejoiced at their first bowl bid in over a

decade...until they began to feel the pres
sure from different areas of society to
reject what they had worked so hard for.
Should they ignore the King holiday vote
and play, or should they take the moral
high ground and refuse the bid?

On the same day that Virginia backed
out of an informal committment to play
in the Fiesta Bowl, the Bear players voted
unanimously to play in the Copper. And
as much as I hate to say it, especially dur
ing Big Game week, Cal Did the Right
Thing.
It's easy to criticize their decision. Too
easy. The NAACP accordingly did so, as
the front page of yesterday's Chronicle
proclaimed. The article quoted the PR
head of the NAACP as saying, "We just
don't understand how a school with the
University of California's tradition could
have made this decision. The university
has always been a campus that has fos
tered humanitarian ideals."
Mr. Williams is missing the point. It's

just a football game. Simply because the
Cal football team plays in a bowl game in
Arizona, it doesn't have to be construed
as a slap in the face to the Berkeley "tra
dition." Where is it written that bowl par
ticipants must endorse the politics of the
state the game is played in?
Individuals certainly have a right to
object. Nobody is forcing them to go to the
game, to spend their money in this state
of questionable race relations. But for the
Cal players, there really isn't any choice.
The goal of any college team is to play in
a bowl game. Unlike Virginia, who had
the Sugar Bowl as a backup option, there
is no other bowl for Cal. It's the Copper or
nothing.
The Bears' decision should not be seen
as a case of giving in to the temptation of
the money and prestige of a bowl game.
Instead, they were making a statement by
refusing to bow to the pressure to reject
the bid. They were in effect stating,
"Look, this is a football decision, not a
racial relations decision. It would be
unfair to make ourselves end our fans
suffer for what some voters decided about
the political merits of a state holiday."
Or, as I said earlier, "What does this
have to do with sports?"
Let the NFL pull their showcase out of
Arizona. Cal's decision is positive in that
it further establishes the (albeit tenuous)
division between college and pro sports
that has to exist for the system to work.
These are juat college kids, not business

It's time to take a step
back, leave the bicker
ing to the real politi
cians, and play the
game.

men or politicians.
Sports are already too political anyway.
Nevius's column compared this issue
with the controversy last summer over
Shoal Creek Country Club and the Pro
fessional Golf Association. That too was
about racism, and it dominated the sports
page headlines with political sniping and
posturing. Further back we have the var
ious Olympic boycotts and massacres. It's
time to take a step back, leave the bicker
ing to the real politicians, and play the
game.
Besides, Cal will need the Copper Bowl
to go out a winner and erase the bad feel
