While no one was looking,
the men's golf team slipped oft
the Farm and won a tourna
ment.
Stanford finished just ahead
of rival California at the Uni
versity of San Francisco Invi
tational to win the tourna
ment, which featured a field of
thirteen western and mid
western teams. The Cardinal
shot 904 to the Golden Bears'
908.
USF and Washington were
right behind California, tying
for third with scores of 909
each.
Cardinal Dave Rutkowski
captured the individual title
despite a 78-stroke final day.
He burned up the 6808-yard
course the first two days, gar
nering a 73 and a 71, for a

tournament total of 222.
Rutkowski edged Califor
nia's Rob Martin by one stroke
to take first place.
Not too far behind him,
junior Christian Cevaer tied
for fourth among individuals
with a 225-Bhot performance.
His first two days out both pro
duced five-over-par 76's. He
finished the tournament with
a strong 73-stroke outing.
For reasons unknown, the
invitational was almost com
pletely unpublicized. Even
Stanford's own Sports Infor
mation Department was
caught by surprise when the
Cardinal returned home with a
tournament title.
However, if in the future the
men's golf team returns from a
tournament with another title
under its collective belt, that
should be no surprise to any
one.
