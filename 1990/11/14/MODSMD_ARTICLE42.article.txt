# Normality goes out the window
## Predictions are useless in 'Big' rivalry 
### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
It's a 93-year-long event. It's media hype,
student excitement and crazy outcomes. It's
rivalry to the umpteenth degree. It's the Big
Game, and it's coming to Berkeley this Satur
day.
This is no ordinary football game â€” for
anyone who suits up in cardinal and white or
blue and gold.
"There's no question it's not a normal
game. It gets ugly towards the end of the week,
but that's one of the things that's special
about it," said offensive lineman Chuck
Gillingham. "You know it's something special,
and you know it's Big Game, and that provides
the extra incentive."
There's even more to it for Bay Area natives
like Tuan Van Le.
Fueling the air of expectation and the desire
to finish off the season with a win is the per
sonal challange aspect of the contest.
It's only "friendly" sparring, but Stanford
and Cal players look forward to showing-up
former classmates on the gridiron, and rub
bing it in their faces the rest of the year.
For Lethe Big Game is for bragging rights.
The defensive back has already received two

phone calls wishing him and the Cardinal
some not-so-good luck and detailing where Le
will be spending the day if his callers have any
say in the matter. Le is planning on returning
the compliments.
Because as soon as Thanksgiving vacation
rolls around, Le and other Cardinal Northern
Califomians will be reminding their friends of
the result. Or vice-versa.
Last season's 24-14 underdog victory was
no exception.
"It's bragging rights, it's big time bragging
rights. I know for a fact that if we hadn't have
won the game I'd have been there listening to
him (California quarterback Mike Pawlawski)
talk." Le said. "It's hometown bragging rights
when it comes right down to it. If we win this
week I'm going to go home Thanksgiving and
have a good time bragging again."
The verbal exchange is especially prolific
between Le and Golden Bear buddies, because
it was Le who personally denied California a
sure victory two seasons ago, blocking Robbie
Keen's 20-yard field goal to preserve a 19-19
tie as time ran out.
But even without personal connections, the
rest of the Cardinal agrees with Le's descrip
tion of the annual matchup. There's definitely
something special about the season finale, and

every Stanford football player feels it, sooner
or later. Those who don't know about the tra
dition pick up the attitude quickly.
Playing California the third Saturday in
November is a Stanford institution.
"It grew on me. It goes deeper than the
rivalry. It's scary. You can feel it in the air," Le
said. "A lot of young players really don't know
that this is a 93-year tradition. This is the
longest-running game around."
It's big for the fans, who spend the week
parting, thinking of pranks and actually
wearing school colors, but it's huge for the
teams. Even as a recruit, Le could tell the
game had a life of its own.
"I was sitting there and I could feel the
excitement in the air, I could feel the players
on the field. It was so thick I wanted to be a
part of it," Le said. "Hearing about it, reading
about it, you get that sense of rivalry, but
being in it is a whole different world."
The game itself is indeed on a whole differ
ent plane. It has to be one of the weirdest con
tests around. Huge upsets, last-second victo
ries, "impossible" wins, and surprising stars
are nothing out of the ordinary when Califor
nia and Stanford clash on the gridiron. It
