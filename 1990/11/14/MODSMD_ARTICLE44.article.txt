# Fraternity members discuss Greek image
## 
### Allison Shue Staff writer 
Program and Fraternal
Affairs Adviser Michael Ram
sey-Ferez stressed the need for
fraternities to work with the
rest of the Stanford commu
nity in a meeting last night at
the Beta house.
About 25 fraternity mem
bers, resident assistants and
other students discussed an
increase in complaints about
fraternity members and the
overall image of fraternities.
Beta President Josh San
born initiated the program in
response to a letter Ramsey-
Perez sent to every fraternity.
The letter addressed "the
recent upswing in complaints"
about incidents involving fra
ternity members, Sanborn
said.
Ramsey-Perez opened the
discussion by stressing the
need to work with other seg
ments of the campus commu
nity to prevent future negative
incidents and promote the
image of fraternities.
Communication should play
a mtyor role, he said. "I think
the [Greek] community needs
to develop more ambassadors"
to let the rest of the commu
nity know about cultural and
educational programs spon
sored by fraternities, he added.
Ramsey-Perez cited a recent
Kappa Alpha Faculty Night as
one example of how fraternities
can create rapport with faculty
members, who might then feel
comfortable approaching fra
ternity members with con

cerns.
He also suggested reaching
out to other campus groups to
encourage joint planning of
programs.
Several students expressed
concern over the fraternity sys
tem's negative reputation and
advocated greater publicity of
Greek philanthropic events.
But a Florence Moore Hall
RA said negative incidents also
need to be addressed.
"Especially among frosh
this year, there's a general con
sensus that fraternities are bad
news," another Flo Mo RA
said.
Fraternity members also
expressed qualms about hold
ing an individual fraternity or
the whole fraternity system
collectively responsible for the
actions of its members.
"It's an easy label to put
that 'the Greek system has a
problem,' rather than 'this
house has a problem,' or 'this
individual has a problem,"'
said the RA of Delta Kappa
Epsilon.
But Ramsey-Perez said
because fraternities have the
privilege of selecting their
members, they "are taking a
certain amount of responsibil
ity for [their] brothers'
actions."
The role of the Interfrater
nity Council Judicial Board,
established this year, was also
discussed. The board consists
of fraternity members who
investigate complaints and dis
cipline fraternities for matters
other than Fundamental Stan
dard violations.
