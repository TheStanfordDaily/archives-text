# Dinner raises awareness of poverty, hunger
## 
### Anna Rabinowicz Staff writer 
Branner freshmen tried to simulate eating
conditions in Second and Third World coun
tries last night in the first annual Hunger Din
ner.
Intended to dramatize the global food
shortage, the dinner was part of the Stanford
International Development Organization's
effort to raise student awareness about issues
of poverty and hunger, said coordinator
Corona Freitag, a senior. The campaign will
culminate in tomorrow's sixth annual cam
puswide fast.
When freshmen entered the dining hall, 55
percent were assigned to the Third World, 30
percent to the Second World and 15 percent to
the First World — proportions corresponding
to actual population figures.
"Members" of the First World — countries
such as the United States, Canada and West
ern Europe — dined at tablecloth-covered
tables, ate a regular food service meal includ
ing ice cream and were served beverages by
waiters. Second World freshmen — simulating
citizens of Eastern Europe, Korea and Brazil
— ate rice and vegetables and sat at uncovered

tables.
Separated from the First World by a parti
tion, students assigned to the Third World
were given limited portions of rice and water
and sat on the floor in a circle.
"This metaphorically demonstrated how
the First World often doesn't see the problems
of the Third World," said organization mem
ber Josh Latimer, a junior.
Amid cries of "Hey you! Give me some
bread!," Brett Rogers, a "citizen" of the Third
World, led a military uprising against the First
World to steal bread crusts and coke. "We were
frustrated and hungry, he said. "The food
they're wasting could go to good use — to us."
Dan Jones, a First World "citizen,"
described the guilt felt by those who had eaten
full meals. "It was as effective as people
wanted it to be — you could make fun of it or
take it seriously. Sitting up at this table, I real
ized how much I take for granted."
Approximately 70 students dined in a hall
normally filled with 160 freshmen. The small
turnout disappointed Branner resident assis
tant Kesinee Angkustsiri, a senior, who
blamed it partially on a 7 p.m. Calculus 43
midterm.
In addition, she said, some students may

have feared they would go hungry. A regular
dinner was served after the simulation.
Chosen because of its all-freshmen struc
ture and size, Branner incorporated the dinner
into its Hunger Awareness Week, which
includes tomorrow's fast and a speaker next
week from the African National Congress.
Angkustsiri said although the students
didn't feel intense hunger and pain, the simu
lation was effective. "It's token learning, but
it's better than nothing."
Similar experiments have been attempted
at Oberlin College, Harvard University and
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as
well as at high schools nationwide.
Through last year's fast, the organization
raised $3,000 to benefit grassroots develop
ment projects such as a women's dairy in
Kenya, a poultry cooperative in Tamil Nadu,
India and the Ecumenical Hunger Project in
East Palo Alto.
Organization members will discuss two
such projects today at 5:30 p.m. in Cardenal
Lounge.
"This is meant to be an exchange program
— we contribute money, and the people we
assist tell us their experiences and give us
information," Freitag said.
