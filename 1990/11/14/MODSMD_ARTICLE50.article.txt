# Auction benefits cancer research
## 
### Kathy Ardalan 
In its philanthropic
activity for the year, the Delta
Delta Delta sorority held its third
annual auction yesterday to raise
money for cancer research at
Stanford Children's Hospital.
The 73 items auctioned at noon
in White Plaza ranged extensively
in price and variety. Among the
edibles offered were several boxes
of Mrs. Field's cookies and din
ners for two at 15 local restau
rants. The list also included sere
nades by several Stanford singing
groups, tickets to numerous
music events, compact disks,
video rentals, VIP" admission to
Sea World and even swimming
conditioning lessons.
Sorority President Julia
Ingram, a senior, predicted that

the earnings will equal the $4,000
raised last year.
Some of the more popular
items included a team spot for the
Kappa Alpha mud volleyball tour
nament, purchased for $95 by
Doug Murphy. Murphy, who
bought the place for himself and
his dormmates in Cardenal, said,
"We love volleyball. It is the thing
to do. We want to slide around in
the mud and have a good time."
Much of the bidding centered
on projects that sorority members
would perform. One student paid
$50 to De spoon-fed custom-made
sundaes by two Tri-Delts. Bed
time tuck-ins with freshly baked
cookies were among the other ser
vices offered.
Senior Stacey Wueste was
pleased with her $10 purchase —
a designated driver for herself and

five friends for one night. "It's
great that the Tri-Delts are pro
moting responsible drinking," she
said.
The sorority gave away a pair
of Stanford basketball tickets
along with each item.
Ingram said the auction's suc
cess depends on the hard work of
the sorority members, who
started planning the event last
spring.
She also thanked the compa
nies for contributing to the cause
and said, "The crowd was really
good."
Marc Vincenti, coordinator of
Community Affairs at Children's
Hospital, said he was delighted
with "the sorority's concern and
dedication to the community. We
really appreciate these kinds of
projects."
