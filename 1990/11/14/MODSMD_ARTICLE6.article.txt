# Requirements to top open forum agenda
## 
### Alex Hoye Staff writer 
The Committee on Undergrad
uate Studies' proposal to revise
the current system of distribution
requirements has sparked debate
on campus among both students
and faculty.
The proposal's primary tenet is
that requirements should go
beyond their current purpose of
encouraging breadth and explo
ration in diverse fields of study, as
stated in Courses and Degrees.
The requirements should fur
ther "help students prepare to
become responsible members of
society by ensuring that they take
courses introducing the major
social, historical, cultural and
intellectual forces that shape the
contemporary world," the com
mittee's report states.
The plan makes the current
asterisked non-Western culture
requirement, which can be satis
fied by courses that fulfill other
areas, into a full-fledged require
ment titled "World Cultures."
Tt further proposes an "Ameri

can Cultures" requirement, which
focuses on racial, religious, ethnic
and cultural differences in order
to address the growing diversity in
U.S. culture.
The proposal also calls for col
lapsing areas 4, "Human Develop
ment, Behavior and Language,"
and 5, "Social Processes and Insti
tutions," into a single area and
adding an asterisked Gender
Studies requirement.
Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy offered a compromise
proposal last month which adds a
"World Cultures" requirement,
replacing the current non-West
ern culture asterisked require
ment, but makes no other
changes. It stresses that courses
dealing with race, ethnicity, reli
gion and gender will continue to
be offered and can be used to ful
fill area requirements.
A forum for students to discuss
the proposal with faculty and
administrators — including His
tory Prof. Peter Duus, chair of the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies — will be held tonight at 7
p.m. in the Toyon Hall lounge.
The Faculty Senate is scheduled
to vote Nov. 29 on the committee's
proposal and on Abernethy's
alternative.
Reactions to the proposals
among faculty and students are
mixed.
Proponents of the committee's
proposal point to the growth of
the minority population in the
United States as necessitating
changes in curriculum.
David Brown, student repre
sentative to the Faculty Senate,
pointed out that the committee's

proposal mandates curriculum
changes beyond those of the Cul
tures, Ideas and Values program.
He said it is important to bring
race and gender issues outside of
Residential Education programs
and into the classroom.
But some are concerned that
"piling on" more requirements
would cause undue difficulty for
engineering and premedical stu
dents.
Anthony Siegman, electric
engineering professor and Faculty
Senate member, said engineers
"can live with one more class,"
but not in conjunction with the
popular drive to increase under
graduate research opportunities.
Reservations about the com
mittee proposal also include con

cern about the collapsing of areas
4 and 5. Senior Jay Goldin, an
ASSU senator, voiced concern
that it would encourage students
to take fewer classes in some of
Stanford's most developed depart
ments — economics, political sci
ence and psychology — and direct
them into the underdeveloped
ethnic studies programs.
Junior John Abbott, president
of the Stanford College Republi
cans, said he is concerned that the
new requirements are very politi
cally charged and that class lists
in the new curriculum would offer
little political diversity.
Some students also object to
the continued use of what they
consider a flawed "asterisk" sys
tem.

Junior Scott Christofferson,
co-chair of the Stanford
Democrats, said he supports Aber
nethy's proposal in part because
he feels the asterisk requirement
both encourages professors to pro
vide cursory material in areas
where they are unqualified to
teach and adversely affects stu
dents' course selections.
The goal of tonight's forum is
to increase awareness and discus
sion about the issue among stu
dents, according to ASSU Senate
chair Solina Kwan, a senior. It is
partially a response to an ASSU
dorm poll last week in which 19
percent of students surveyed said
they were unfamiliar with the
proposed changes.
