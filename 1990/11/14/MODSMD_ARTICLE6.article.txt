The Committee on Undergrad
uate Studies' proposal to revise
the current system of distribution
requirements has sparked debate
on campus among both students
and faculty.
The proposal's primary tenet is
that requirements should go
beyond their current purpose of
encouraging breadth and explo
ration in diverse fields of study, as
stated in Courses and Degrees.
The requirements should fur
ther "help students prepare to
become responsible members of
society by ensuring that they take
courses introducing the major
social, historical, cultural and
intellectual forces that shape the
contemporary world," the com
mittee's report states.
The plan makes the current
asterisked non-Western culture
requirement, which can be satis
fied by courses that fulfill other
areas, into a full-fledged require
ment titled "World Cultures."
Tt further proposes an "Ameri

can Cultures" requirement, which
focuses on racial, religious, ethnic
and cultural differences in order
to address the growing diversity in
U.S. culture.
The proposal also calls for col
lapsing areas 4, "Human Develop
ment, Behavior and Language,"
and 5, "Social Processes and Insti
tutions," into a single area and
adding an asterisked Gender
Studies requirement.
Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy offered a compromise
proposal last month which adds a
"World Cultures" requirement,
replacing the current non-West
ern culture asterisked require
ment, but makes no other
changes. It stresses that courses
dealing with race, ethnicity, reli
gion and gender will continue to
be offered and can be used to ful
fill area requirements.
A forum for students to discuss
the proposal with faculty and
administrators â€” including His

Committee on Undergraduate
