# Book rebates reduced Construction costs take their toll
## 
### Peter Cousins 
For the second consecutive
year, construction costs at the
Bookstore have taken a bite out of
the money allocated for student
rebate checks.
Students can expect to receive
10 percent of the total dollar
amount spent on books last year,
according to Bookstore General
Manager Eldon Speed. This is
down compared to a 12 percent
rebate after the 1988-89 school
year and a 16 percent rebate from

1987-88, Speed said.
Nearly 8,000 rebate checks for
a total of $273,789 have been
issued since last week. Speed said
a typical rebate check runs
between $40 and $50, reflecting
the average student's total book
purchases of $400 to 500.
He said the current remodeling
project, which will cost the
Bookstore about $3 million dollars
overall, is "a significant expansion
we will have to pay for ourselves."
This year students were able to
obtain their checks in one of two
ways. Checks were available for
pick-up in front of the Bookstore
on Monday, Tuesday, and
Wednesday of last week.
The rest of the checks were
mailed directly to students, and all
rebate checks have now been dis

tributed, Speed said.
The Bookstore rebates its prof
its on all student book purchases.
Speed said he expects rebates to
increase again after the expansion
project is finished.
The Bookstore expansion pro
ject began last fall and is currently
scheduled for completion in late
January. When completed, the
Bookstore will have an additional
two underground floors for text
books and other products.
