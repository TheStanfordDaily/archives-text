# Book rebates reduced Construction costs take their toll
## 
### Peter Cousins 
For the second consecutive
year, construction costs at the
Bookstore have taken a bite out of
the money allocated for student
rebate checks.
Students can expect to receive
10 percent of the total dollar
amount spent on books last year,
according to Bookstore General
Manager Eldon Speed. This is
down compared to a 12 percent
rebate after the 1988-89 school
year and a 16 percent rebate from

1987-88, Speed said.
Nearly 8,000 rebate checks for
a total of $273,789 have been
issued since last week. Speed said
a typical rebate check runs
between $40 and $50, reflecting
the average student's total book
purchases of $400 to 500.
He said the current remodeling
project, which will cost the
Bookstore about $3 million dollars
overall, is "a significant expansion
we will have to pay for ourselves."
