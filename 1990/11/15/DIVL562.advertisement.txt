Companies often give their college
recruits a very limited role to play. At
Microsoft your role is limited only by
your talent, imagination and energy. In
other words, what you can accomplish
is wide open.
This openness to ideas, anyone's
ideas, helps us constantly innovate the
personal computing industryâ€”every
thing from advanced operating envi
ronments to integrated applications. If
you have some innovative software
ideas of your own, check out the view
from Microsoft.
We are an equal opportunity em
ployer and are working toward a more
culturally diverse workplace.
