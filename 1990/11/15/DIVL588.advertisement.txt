HIGH-LEVEL CAREERS
ARE LAUNCHED WITH
AIR FORCE ROTC.
Flying a 15-ton jet is not for
everyone. But for those who can
meet the challenge, it's a thrill that
no other career can offer.
How about you? If you're thinking
about life at Mach 2, think about Air Force ROTC
immediately. It will launch the leadership skills you'll
need as an Air Force officer - skills that will serve you for
a lifetime. FAA-approved flight lessons will get your feet off
the ground for the first time.
