# Israeli president drops in
## Secret visit features speech to select group 
### Manjusha Pawagi 
In what turned out to be Stanford's best kept
secret yesterday evening, Israeli President Chaim
Herzog arrived at the University to speak to a select
group of professors and scholars at the Hoover Insti
tution.
Up to five minutes before Herzog arrived, stu
dents who asked campus police why there were bar
ricades around the circle between Hoover Tower and
Memorial Auditorium were told that the police were
"not at liberty to say."
Herzog was here at the invitation of long-time
friend George Shultz, Hoover fellow and former Sec
retary of State. Herzog spoke to a group of 89 invited
guests including University President Donald
Kennedy, Israeli Ambassador to the United States
Zalman Shoval and Hoover Director John Raisian.
The only members of the American media present
were reporters from the Associated Press and a few
California newspapers, and the only broadcast media
there were Israeli television and radio reporters.
Herzog devoted most of his half-hour speech to
criticism of the instant coverage that television gives
to world events, mainly those in Israel. "It is the
development of what I believe is one of the great dan
gers of democracy today in the world," he said, call
ing the media "the modern dictatorship."
He said the televised news that people get in the

morning is "superficial" and is more concerned with
drama than diplomacy.
"It is very, very difficult to explain to the world
which has got used to the idea of looking at the prob
lems as just black and white, as Israel and the Arabs
... that the picture is not black and white; it's a
large series of different shades of gray," Herzog said.
The problem is that Israel is host to the second
largest foreign press corps in the world, after Wash
ington, and is therefore subject to a kind of scrutiny
that the rest of the world avoids, Herzog said.
He said that during the same time that 17 Pales
tinians were killed in Israel last month, more than
1,000 people died in fighting in Lebanon and more
than 200 were killed in Hindu-Muslim riots in India.
But the Israeli incident was given the most publicity,
he said.
Gloria Walker, public affairs director for Hoover,
said "the evening was a great opportunity for the
Hoover Institution and Stanford University to host a
distinguished head of state." She added that it was
"a very exciting and successful enterprise for every
one involved."
Shultz and Kennedy just "wanted it to be very pri
vate and intimate," said Richard Sousa, associate
director of Hoover.
Walker said that with the Israeli and American
