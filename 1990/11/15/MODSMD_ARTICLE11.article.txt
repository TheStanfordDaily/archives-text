Women sue police after gender questioned
COSTA MESA, Calif. (AP) — Two female body builders filed a
$1 million claim against police, alleging five officers called them
transsexuals and forced one of them to drop her pants to prove
her sex.
Lorie Sencer, 28, and Bridget Morton, 20, filed the claim
against the city on Friday, said John J. Duran, a civil rights attor
ney who represents the women.
The women claim that five officers confronted them as they
were leaving the women's bathroom on Oct. 27 during a Billy Idol
concert at Pacific Amphitheatre.
Ms. Sencer said officers told her that they had received com
plaints of men using the women's bathroom.
"I told the cops, everything's cool," she said. "We're women.
We're body builders, and people made this kind of mistake before
because of our muscles. But we're women. Look at our breasts.
Come on."
But one policeman reportedly retorted: "You're in Costa Mesa
now You look like transsexuals to me. Are you in the middle of
sex-change operations?"
Ms. Morton left her identification in a car parked outside. She
said officers forced her to submit to a genital inspection to prove
she was a woman.
"The one officer said that we would have to go to jail unless
Bridget showed him some kind of proof that she was a woman,"
Ms. Sencer said.
Saddam adds 'guestage' to English language
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) — Saddam Hussein has contributed a
new word to the English language: "guestages," short for "guest
hostages."
The Iraqi president's ministers routinely warn reporters not to
refer to the thousands of Westerners banned from leaving Iraq as
hostages.
"This is a very, very bad and dirty word and I'm not going to
accept it,"says Information and Culture Minister Latif Jassim
during his news briefings.
And a warning in Iraq today should be taken seriously.
After several such warnings, the word "guestages" entered the
lexicon of Iraqispeak.
"Are you a h05..." The moment you ask any of the hundreds of
Westerners held in Baghdad hotels, comes the swift reply: "No,
I'm a guestage."
Little guy cleans up in wiper suit
DETROIT (AP) — The inventor of intermittent windshield
wipers agreed yesterday to settle a 12-year-old lawsuit against
Ford Motor Co. for $10.2 million.
Robert Reams' similar lawsuits against 19 other domestic,
European and Japanese automakers remain active. He contends
that each failed to pay him royalties for using his invention — a
windshield wiper that starts and stops at intervals when a contin
uous wiper motion isn't needed.
Originally, Kearns sought $141 million from Ford and had
rejected a $30 million settlement offer. Last July, after one mis
trial, jurors ordered Ford to pay $5.2 million plus interest, which
pushed the award to between $8.5 million and $11.5 million.
U.S. District Judge Avern Cohn approved the settlement after
spending most of a 20-minute hearing chatting with Kearns to be
sure he understood its terms. The other cases also are pending
before Cohn.
Bill Durkee, Kearns' attorney, said the next target probably
will be Chrysler Corp.
