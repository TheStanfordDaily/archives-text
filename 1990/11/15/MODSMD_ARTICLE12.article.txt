# Heseltine takes on Thatcher
## Ex-cabinet member wages 'war' to unseat prime minister 
### 
LONDON (AP) — Former Defense Secretary
Michael Heseltine yesterday challenged Prime Min
ister Margaret Thatcher in a six-day war for the
leadership of the government and the Conservative
Party.
Heseltine, who will stand against Thatcher in a
ballot among the 372 Conservative legislators on
Tuesday, accused her of splitting the party on
Europe and alienating voters with an unpopular
local government tax.
The challenge by Heseltine, a handsome, self
made millionaire who espouses a "caring capital
ism" in contrast to Thatcher's rigorous free-market
views, poses the biggest threat to her survival since
she won power more than 11 years ago.
"I am persuaded that I will now have a better
prospect than Thatcher of leading the Conservatives
to a fourth general election victory," Heseltine said.
Kenneth Baker, chairman of the troubled Conser
vative Party, said the 65-year-old prime minister will
fight to the end to keep power — through a possible
three ballots ending Nov. 29.
"This contest is unwanted and unnecessary,"
Baker said. "I am sure she will win on the first bal
lot."
Said Heseltine: "She would fight her corner. That
is wholly admirable."
Other ministers in the 22-member Cabinet said it
was wrong to challenge Thatcher now, with some
16,000 British troops in the Persian Gulf and war
threatening against Iraq.
Heseltine, who needs 159 votes in the first secret
ballot to force a runofT, said more than 100 legisla
tors have pledged support. Thatcher needs 214 votes

to win outright.
If a second ballot is needed it will be held Nov. 27
and may well bring in other contenders from the
Cabinet, such as Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd. If
no one won outright then, a third and final vote
among the last three top contenders will be held Nov.
29.
Heseltine, defense secretary until he stalked out
of Thatcher's Cabinet in 1986 in a Europe-related
dispute, stepped forward a day after her former
deputy prime minister delivered a scathing attack on
her attitude toward Europe.
The onslaught by Sir Geoffrey Howe, who
resigned Nov. 1, appeared to have tipped Heseltine
into his along awaited bid for the leadership.
Rebellion has simmered in the party for more
than a year, partly over Thatcher's isolation in the
stepped-up drive for greater European unity. Britain
alone rejected an agreement last month in principle
for a single central bank and single currency for the
12-nation European community.
But Thatcher's crisis is rooted in the Tories' 16-
month lag in opinion polls, mainly because of high
interest rates, double-digit inflation and an unpopu
lar local per-capita tax dubbed the "poll tax."
Heseltine said that if he wins he will order an
immediate review of that tax, which he said left "a
lingering sense of injustice."
Thatcher is the longest-serving head of govern
ment in the Western world, and Britain's longest
serving prime minister in this century.
The attempt to overthrow her threatened to
become a dirty, no-holds-barred campaign for the
leadership of the party.
