# Georgia seeks independence from U.S.S.R.

MOSCOW (AP) â€” Georgia's new parlia
ment declared yesterday it will seek full inde
pendence from the Soviet Union, which it
accused of seven decades of "bloody terror and
repression."
In Lithuania, Prime Minister Kazimiere
Prunskiene said her Baltic republic may soon
face a second Kremlin economic blockade. She
sought help in advance from other Soviet
republics, Western companies and former U.S.
Sen. Gary Hart.
Angry members of the national legislature
demanded that President Mikhail Gorbachev
report to them on his attempts to hold the
country together and on his Sunday meeting
with his main political rival, Russian Federa
tion President Boris Yeltsin.
Gorbachev agreed to address the Supreme
Soviet on Friday, the official Tass news agency
said.
Georgian lawmakers met in Tbilisi, their
capital, for the first time since a pro-indepen
dence coalition, the Round Table for a Free
Georgia, won Oct. 28 parliamentary elections.
Those elections were the first true multiparty
polling in Soviet history.
Parliament voted 238 to 5 with one absten
tion to elect Round Table leader Zviad Gam
sakhurdia, a 51-year-old author, as Georgia's
president. He immediately reiterated his
promise to lead the southern republic's 5.3
million people to complete independence and a
market-based economy.

"We are for an economy totally independent
of the central authorities, a maximum of pri
vatization, and business contacts with all
(other states) on a mutually beneficial basis,"
he told Interfax, an independent Soviet news
agency.
Tass said the parliament declared Georgia
was entering a transition period to "full state
independence" and dropped "Soviet" and
"Socialist" from its name. It now is called the
Republic of Georgia, instead of the Georgian
Soviet Socialist Republic. The length of the
transition period was not set.
Georgia earlier declared economic
sovereignty from the central Soviet govern
ment, but yesterday's declaration went fur
ther and appeared to rule out signing a new
treaty of confederation among the 15 Soviet
republics, as Gorbachev wants.
All 15 republics with the exception of Kir
gizia now have taken steps towara sovereignty
or independence, and the parliament of that
Central Asian republic has been debating a
possible sovereignty resolution for weeks.
Georgia's parliament restored the state
hymn, seal and flag used from 1919 to 1921,
when Georgia was independent.
In an amended preamble to the republic's
constitution, the lawmakers said that in
February and March of 1921, "Soviet Russia
rudely violated" a peace treaty it signed with
Georgia, occupied the republic by military
force and effectively annexed it.

The entire period in which Georgia has
been part of the Soviet Union has been marked
by "bloody terror and repression," the pream
ble says.
Georgia, in the Caucasus Mountains, is bor
dered by Russia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. The
republic is a major resort area and the nation's
fruit and vegetable basket. Georgia also has
mining and industry.
Lithuania was the first republic to declare
independence, on March 11. Its parliament
agreed to suspend the declaration in return for
the Kremlin's calling off a crippling, 10-week
trade embargo and entering negotiations.
Prunskiene said Monday night that Krem
lin officials show no willingness to compromise
and are trying to squeeze Lithuania economi
cally before scheduled fonpal negotiations
begin at the end of this month.
She said another embargo was "quite a pos
sibility, an ominous reality that is approaching
us."
During the first blockade, from April 18 to
June 30, Moscow cut off all oil, most natural
gas and many raw materials, forcing Lithua
nian factories to close and thousands to lose
jobs.
Prunskiene said she met yesterday with
Moscow Mayor Gavriil Popov; economist Grig
ory Yavlinsky, a deputy prime minister of the
Russian Federation; and Gary Hart, the for
mer U.S. senator from Colorado and 1988
Democratic presidential candidate.
