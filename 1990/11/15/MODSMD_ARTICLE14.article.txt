# Eastern pleads for life in bankruptcy court

NEW YORK (AP) - Eastern
Airlines begged a bankruptcy
judge for more cash yesterday to
stay alive, but creditors demanded
that the carrier close down, sell
whatever assets remain and pay at
least part of its enormous debt.
Eastern's trustee, Martin R.
Shugrue Jr., asked U.S. Bank
ruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland to
let the airline have $30 million
from an escrow account immedi
ately, $40 million in late December
and $10 million in early January.
The immediate cash from the

account of $273.6 million would
keep Eastern operating through
December, Shugrue said. He pre
dicted the carrier, which has been
in bankruptcy court since a crip
pling strike began in March 1989,
should be able to turn its losses
around early next year.
The airline's unsecured credi
tors, including banks, labor
unions and airplane manufactur
ers, said Eastern has virtually no
chance of becoming viable.
Shugrue criticized the creditors
for seeking liquidation, saying
many of the airline's assets would
lose value if it were forced to sell
them out of desperation.
"No one wins in a liquidation
mode, particularly in this environ
ment,' he said.
In a response to Eastern's
request for the money, the credi

tors asked the judge to close East
ern so it can be liquidated. The
creditors said Eastern's economic
performance has repeatedly fallen
short of Shugrue's projections.
They worried that if any more
money is handed out to keep East
ern alive, there would not be
enough left to oversee an orderly
liquidation of assets, including
planes and gate rights at
US. airports.
The two sides presented their
cases at a jammed hearing in
Lifland's Manhattan courtroom.
It was unclear when the judge
would rule.
Shugrue, a veteran airline
executive who was named by the
court to run Eastern seven
months ago, has sought to woo
travelers with an aggressive mar
keting campaign that includes

heavily discounted seats for vaca
tioners and first-class upgrades
for anyone paying full coach fare.
Miami-based Eastern's traffic
figures show more passengers are
flying the airline, but it's still con
fronting enormous obstacles
besides angry creditors and a debt
exceeding $1 billion.
Perhaps the most critical
immediate problem is fuel
expenses, which have nearly dou
bled since Iraq invaded Kuwait on
Aug. 2. Because Eastern is so
weak financially, the impact of
that unforeseen cost increase has
hurt Eastern more severely than
many of its rivals.
As Eastern's fate was being
determined in Lifland's court,
travel agents expressed mixed
views on the wisdom of purchas
ing its tickets.
