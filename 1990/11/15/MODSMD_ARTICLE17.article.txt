### 
King's place in history
secure, despite charges
of plagiarizing ideas

The discovery that
Martin Luther King Jr. pla
giarized parts of his schol
arly writings while at Boston Uni
versity diminishes neither his role
in history nor his contributions to
the civil rights movement.
This week Clayborne Carson,
editor of the Martin Luther King
Jr. Papers Project, acknowledged
that King appropriated words,
ideas and structures of argument
from other scholars without citing
them.
King's shortcomings as a
scholar should not be simply writ
ten off as the oral tradition of the
black church, as some have argued.
Such an explanation demeans the
black church and unfairly treats
the work of black scholars.
What is more, it is unnecessary
to absolve King of the plagiarism
charge in order to preserve his
place in history.
King will remain in the histori
cal memory a visionary leader and
a transformer of society. His gifts
as a speaker, a leader and an archi
tect of change remain beyond ques
tion.
King provided inspired leader
ship for the civil rights movement
in America with the philosophy of
nonviolent resistance to racial seg
regation and discrimination.
Drawing on the strength of his
religious convictions, his eloquence
and power as a speaker, and his
personal courage, King led move
ments for equality throughout the
South.
He risked arrest, threats of
death and the condemnation of a
prejudiced society in his dedication

the cause of equality.
He inspired thousands by his
own example and gradually won a
nation over to his cause. He made
great gains for the civil rights
movement and received the Nobel
Peace Prize for his efforts.
Advocating nonviolent resis
tance, King brought about peaceful
change in situations where vio
lence and bloodshed, instead of lib
erty and equality, would otherwise
have carried the day.
"King's greatness is based on
what he did after he left school,"
Carson noted. "That is his histori
cal contribution to American his
tory."
The fact that King was a sloppy
and less-than-scrupulous student
does not reflect on his more signif
icant accomplishments.
Rather, it serves to remind us
that all of our leaders, even the
most revered, have human frailties
and weaknesses — and that to
expect perfection, even of our
greatest leaders, is to be disap
pointed.
Carson and his colleagues of the
King Papers Project at Stanford
deserve credit as scholars for
uncovering and confronting the
discovery of King's plagiarism.
Showing a deep commitment to
historical truth, Carson refused to
gloss over evidence of King's short
comings as a scholar. Refusing the
chance to rewrite history, Carson
confronted what must have been a
disheartening revelation.
For the significance of their
research, and for their courage in
publicizing it, Carson and his team
deserve high praise.
They have increased the esteem
of their effort without seriously
tarnishing the memory of one of
America's most revered leaders.
Ultimately, in the story of King's
life and accomplishments, his aca
demic indiscretion will likely repre
sent little more than a footnote.
