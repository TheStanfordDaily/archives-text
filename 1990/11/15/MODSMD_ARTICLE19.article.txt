## The 						School of Negrohood 
### 
Admission to the School of
Negrohood is highly competitive.
Most applicants are very qualified
(meaning very black), as demonstrated by
records and tests.
Therefore, faculty readers look to the
required personal statement to learn
more about such things as the extent of
your black background and blood, your
oppression factor as a Negro, and your
ability to be black in several situations —
both formal and informal.
Also, please take this opportunity to
describe important or unusual aspects of
your blackness not apparent in the rest of
your application. However, the subject is
not limited; the choice of topic itself may
be informative to the readers.
Ever since the Cosbys made blackness
not only popular but also respectable, a
lot of perpetrators have cropped up. With
Afro-Americanized Bart Simpsons and
white rappers like the Beastie Boys and
Vanilla Ice, it seems that almost anybody
can be black nowadays.
However, I believe a member of the
School of Negrohood should be black
through and through — not just in color,
but in background and attitude as well. I
believe I have such qualifications and
would be an excellent student for the
school.
First, I was born a po' black child and
have been black ever since. As a matter of
fact, after more than 21 years, I think I'm
getting quite good at it.
My family's blackness also goes way
back. My father has been black ever since
he can remember. My grandparents —
whose great-great-grandparents were

slaves — sometimes joked that they was
black even before Adam was born.
Also, my background is particularly
black since I grew up in the inner city. As
studies have shown, black people are
more black when they grow up in poverty.
The crack house next door and the
numerous gang shootings in my neigh
borhood in the past few years have given
me an intense understanding of The
Black Experience. Unable to live a mid
dle-class lifestyle, I was forced to live the
way real black people do.
But not only did I live in the inner city,
I also went to an all-black high school
called JEFF-ah-son (actually spelled Jef
ferson). Since I wasn't shuttled off to a
predominantly white prep school and
forced to assimilate, I was allowed to be
black every day — and practice, of course,
makes perfect.
Thus, because I have lived such a black
life, my oppression factor as a Negro, col
ored African-American is very high.
Moreover, I am also quite capable of
being black at both formal and informal
occasions. In formal black sessions such
as both of the Black Student Union meet
ings I attended, I agreed with the liberal
agenda and was more or less able to sing
the Black National Anthem.
Also, as an informal black person, I am
able to sing certain black spirituals, recite
lines from Spike's movies and recognize
chitlins on a soul food platter.
In conclusion, I think that in light of
all this information, you too must con
clude that I is indeed black and therefore
qualified to enter the school in the fall.
However, there are unusual aspects of
my identity that may make me seem less

black than I really am.
Therefore, I confess: 1) I can't dance;
2) I never say "WORD!"; and 3) actually,
only one of my parents is black.
At this point, it may be tempting to
conclude that I, too, am a perpetrator, but
I beseech you: Do not make such a hasty
conclusion!
Though all of the things I detailed ear
lier may contribute to my blackness, they
don't actually make me black. What
makes me black is the fact that I identify
black; I am black; and I love being black.
Period.
Every thought I think, every word I
say and every column I write is black
'cause it's funneled through a black con
sciousness — my black mind.
It may be universal, but it's still black
because it's coming from me.
Therefore, I not only believe that I am
qualified to join The School but that every
black person around who wants to attend
is qualified as well.
It shouldn't be about who's the black
est because that will make our School too
small — we need all the people we've got
to achieve the dream.

he can remember. My grandparents —
whose great-great-grandparents were

slaves — sometimes joked that they was
black even before Adam was born.
Also, my background is particularly
black since I grew up in the inner city. As
studies have shown, black people are
more black when they grow up in poverty.
The crack house next door and the
numerous gang shootings in my neigh
borhood in the past few years have given
me an intense understanding of The
Black Experience. Unable to live a mid
dle-class lifestyle, I was forced to live the
way real black people do.
But not only did I live in the inner city,
I also went to an all-black high school
called JEFF-ah-son (actually spelled Jef
ferson). Since I wasn't shuttled off to a
predominantly white prep school and
forced to assimilate, I was allowed to be
black every day — and practice, of course,
makes perfect.
Thus, because I have lived such a black
life, my oppression factor as a Negro, col
ored African-American is very high.
Moreover, I am also quite capable of
being black at both formal and informal
occasions. In formal black sessions such
as both of the Black Student Union meet
ings I attended, I agreed with the liberal
agenda and was more or less able to sing
the Black National Anthem.
Also, as an informal black person, I am
able to sing certain black spirituals, recite
lines from Spike's movies and recognize
chitlins on a soul food platter.
In conclusion, I think that in light of
all this information, you too must con
clude that I is indeed black and therefore
qualified to enter the school in the fall.
However, there are unusual aspects of
my identity that may make me seem less

black than I really am.
Therefore, I confess: 1) I can't dance;
2) I never say "WORD!"; and 3) actually,
only one of my parents is black.
At this point, it may be tempting to
conclude that I, too, am a perpetrator, but
I beseech you: Do not make such a hasty
conclusion!
Though all of the things I detailed ear
lier may contribute to my blackness, they
don't actually make me black. What
makes me black is the fact that I identify
black; I am black; and I love being black.
Period.
Every thought I think, every word I
say and every column I write is black
'cause it's funneled through a black con
sciousness — my black mind.
It may be universal, but it's still black
because it's coming from me.
Therefore, I not only believe that I am
qualified to join The School but that every
black person around who wants to attend
is qualified as well.
It shouldn't be about who's the black
est because that will make our School too
small — we need all the people we've got
to achieve the dream.
