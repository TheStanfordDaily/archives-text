Holding candles and chanting "Bring
the troops home," several hundred Stan
ford students, faculty and community
members protested against U.S. interven
tion in the Middle East at a rally in White
Plaza last night.
Writing letters to government officials,
signing petitions and listening to draft
counselors occupied the time of many
participants, but the protesters focused
their attention on speakers beginning at
10 p.m. until after midnight. Music and
an open microphone extended the event
all night as students brought sleeping
bags and camped out.
"We oppose the U.S. military offensive
against Iraq. We want to find a peaceful

solution to the crisis in the (Persian) Gulf
and make our voices heard," said Tom
Clyde, a senior who helped organized the
rally. Clyde said it was fear that spurred
him to get together with a committee of
about 20 people last Wednesday to plan
the event.
"I realized that we needed to act now,"
he said. "I'm really pleased that we had
such fantastic support." The Stanford
Middle East Action Committee also sup
ported the rally.
The speakers represented the entire
political spectrum, and included Stanford
faculty, a former nurse in Vietnam,
Hoover Institution scholars and a minis
ter at Memorial Church. Participants
cheered, sang and held candles through
out the speeches.
History Asst. Prof. Joel Beinin called

an American offensive strike against Iraq
"unacceptable, because it's going to cost
tens of thousands of American casualties
and tens of thousands of Iraqi and
Kuwaiti casualties." He also said an
attack on Iraq would cause increased
political instability in the Middle East,
cost huge amounts of money and be
defending an "American way of life" that
he isn't sureis worth fighting and dying to
defend.
According to Paul George, director of
the Peninsula Peace Center in Palo Alto,
the government needs to be "consulting
the people of this country" about whether
to get into a war. Calling the possible war
a "Vietnam in the Persian Gulf," George
suggested there could be an uprising of
the American people against an offensive
strike.

P e &By Tuxen, who spent a year as a
nurse in Vietnam, told the crowd that the
war was not like popular TV shows and
movies, but "the reality was that young
men were dying." She described her expe
rience in vivid detail, leaving some in
attendance with tears in their eyes.
Hoover fellow Williamson Evers spoke
of the "broad coalition" opposing a war
with Iraq. "[President Bush] has not
given the American people a serious rea
son to kill hundreds of thousands of peo
ple," he said.
Tom Bethel, a visiting scholar at the
Hoover Institution and contributor to the
National Review, agreed. "It has not been
clearly explained what we're doing
there," he said. "If you are going to go to
war, you should have the country behind
you."

Marine Lance Cpl. Eric Larsen said he
would refuse to participate in an offensive
attack along with the "tens of thousands
of Gls who are for peace in the Middle
East who will refuse orders to fight."
Larsen, who serves in the Marine
Reserves, also encouraged students to
think about whether to sign up for the
Selective Service.
"A war in the Middle East will be a
bloody hell," Larsen said. "I don't want to
see any of my friends coming home in
body bags ... We have the responsibility
to stop this war before it starts."
Rev. Floyd Thompkins, associate dean
of Memorial Church, asked the govern
ment and military to "give peace a
chance." War is never good, he said, and
"the price of a human life has to be higher
than petroleum."
