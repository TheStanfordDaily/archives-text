Students must call
for end to American
aid to El Salvador
Earlier this year we commemorated
the 10th anniversary of the murder of El
Salvador's Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo
Romero, gunned down while saying a
Mass calling for peace and an end to U.S.
support for the military dictatorship.
This Friday we will commemorate the
first anniversary of the massacre of six
Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her
daughter. The priests were among the
most important voices calling for peace
and a negotiated settlement between the
government and the armed revolution
ary movement (the FMLN).
Ten years and $4.5 billion in U.S. aid
later, the cries for justice and peace are
still being silenced by blood and anguish
— more than 50,000 Salvadorans have
lost their lives to army and death squad
violence.
The Jesuits were faculty at the Uni
verstiy of Central America and the most
important intellectuals in the country,
their reputations for scholarship known
throughout the world. In fact, one of the
priests, Ignacio Ellacuria, was to be
invited as a visiting professor at Stanford
for this academic year.
Symbolizing the importance of their
intellectual work, the army cut out the
brains of two of the priests and left them
beside their bodies. In terms of Stanford,
a similar loss would mean coming to
classes to find Don Kennedy, several
deans and all of our favorite faculty
members tortured and mutilated and left
in the Quad.
Because we are committed to aca
demic freedom and the right to express
ourselves, we are deeply disturbed by
this atrocity and by U.S. involvement in
this crime.
Due to the lack of progress in investi
gating the massacre, Congress recently
voted to cut military aid to El Salvador

by 50 percent. While this was an impor
tant symbolic move, the army-backed
government will continue to receive
more than $300 million annually from
the United States.
Based on the history of the past 10
years, it is clear that this money will lead
not to democracy but to the continuation
of massive violations of human rights.
Both Romero and the six Jesuits were
murdered — 10 years apart — for calling
for essentially the same thing: a negoti
ated settlement and an end to U.S. sup
port for El Salvador's repressive regime.
When will this cycle of violence end?
As U.S. citizens, we must support a nego
tiated settlement and a full cut-off of
U.S. aid to El Salvador.
We invite you to join us in Cubberley
room 133 at 7:30 tonight for a program
titled, "Death and Rebirth in El Sal
vador." Speakers from El Salvador and
the Stanford community will be followed
by a candlelight march and vigil in White
Plaza.
The crosses you will see there are for
the Jesuits and symbolize the tens of
thousands of others killed in their strug
gle for peace and justice in El Salvador.

Fraternity housing
is discriminatory
against all women
Stanford fraternity housing is blatant
ly discriminatory against women. If all
fraternity housing was opened to women
and men alike, it's my guess that four
years of guaranteed housing would have
been a reality years ago.
As it stands now, there are more
housing spots available to men than
women on campus. Even when a frater
nity has open spaces, these are made

available for any male boarders. Women
are never given this option.
I am not advocating giving housing to
sororities to rectify this injustice. This
practice will only exclude more people
from housing they should rightly have.
Sororities have been unhoused for
years at Stanford, and fraternities could
easily learn to do the same. Fraternities
should acknowledge this longstanding
sex discrimination and open their doors
to all undergraduates.

Invasion of Kuwait
doesn't compare to
Gaza Strip dispute
In response to the article "Speaker
decries U.S. role in the Middle East,"
Rev. William Sloan Coffin's quote perpe
trates a gross distortion of historical
facts. It is ludicrous to fashion a paral
lelism between Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
and the 1967 Arab-Israeli War.
Iraq's occupation and subsequent
looting of Kuwait represented nothing
less than naked aggression against a rel
atively helpless neighbor whose territory
and wealth Saddam Hussein coveted.
Iraq was never threatened by Kuwait in
any fashion. Saddam and his regime
have been justly branded as international
brigands by not only the United States
but the world community as well.
By contrast, Israel came into posses
sion of the West Bank and Gaza Strip as
a result of defending herself successfully
against an aggressive war launched
against her by Egypt, Syria, Lebanon
and Iraq. On May 27,1967, nine days
prior to the outbreak of war, President
Nasser of Egypt stated clearly and unam
biguously, "Our basic objective will be
the destruction of Israel."
The United States reacted quite dif-

Iraq's occupation and sub
sequent looting of Kuwait
represented nothing less
than naked aggression
against a relatively help
less neighbor whose terri
tory and wealth Hussein
coveted.

ferently to the Six-Day War in 1967 and
to Iraq's aggression against Kuwait in
1990 because the events themselves were
quite different. To attempt to establish a
linkage between the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict and the current Iraq-Kuwait cri
sis is something that simply won't hold
water.

Students must call
for end to American
aid to El Salvador
Earlier this year we commemorated
the 10th anniversary of the murder of El
Salvador's Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo
Romero, gunned down while saying a
Mass calling for peace and an end to U.S.
support for the military dictatorship.
This Friday we will commemorate the
first anniversary of the massacre of six
Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her
daughter. The priests were among the
most important voices calling for peace
and a negotiated settlement between the
government and the armed revolution
ary movement (the FMLN).
Ten years and $4.5 billion in U.S. aid
later, the cries for justice and peace are
still being silenced by blood and anguish
— more than 50,000 Salvadorans have
lost their lives to army and death squad
violence.
The Jesuits were faculty at the Uni
verstiy of Central America and the most
important intellectuals in the country,
their reputations for scholarship known
throughout the world. In fact, one of the
priests, Ignacio Ellacuria, was to be
invited as a visiting professor at Stanford
for this academic year.
Symbolizing the importance of their
intellectual work, the army cut out the
brains of two of the priests and left them
beside their bodies. In terms of Stanford,
a similar loss would mean coming to
classes to find Don Kennedy, several
deans and all of our favorite faculty
members tortured and mutilated and left
in the Quad.
Because we are committed to aca
demic freedom and the right to express
ourselves, we are deeply disturbed by
this atrocity and by U.S. involvement in
this crime.
Due to the lack of progress in investi
gating the massacre, Congress recently
voted to cut military aid to El Salvador

by 50 percent. While this was an impor
tant symbolic move, the army-backed
government will continue to receive
more than $300 million annually from
the United States.
Based on the history of the past 10
years, it is clear that this money will lead
not to democracy but to the continuation
of massive violations of human rights.
Both Romero and the six Jesuits were
murdered — 10 years apart — for calling
for essentially the same thing: a negoti
ated settlement and an end to U.S. sup
port for El Salvador's repressive regime.
When will this cycle of violence end?
As U.S. citizens, we must support a nego
tiated settlement and a full cut-off of
U.S. aid to El Salvador.
We invite you to join us in Cubberley
room 133 at 7:30 tonight for a program
titled, "Death and Rebirth in El Sal
vador." Speakers from El Salvador and
the Stanford community will be followed
by a candlelight march and vigil in White
Plaza.
The crosses you will see there are for
the Jesuits and symbolize the tens of
thousands of others killed in their strug
gle for peace and justice in El Salvador.

Fraternity housing
is discriminatory
against all women
Stanford fraternity housing is blatant
ly discriminatory against women. If all
fraternity housing was opened to women
and men alike, it's my guess that four
years of guaranteed housing would have
been a reality years ago.
As it stands now, there are more
housing spots available to men than
women on campus. Even when a frater
nity has open spaces, these are made

available for any male boarders. Women
are never given this option.
I am not advocating giving housing to
sororities to rectify this injustice. This
practice will only exclude more people
from housing they should rightly have.
Sororities have been unhoused for
years at Stanford, and fraternities could
easily learn to do the same. Fraternities
should acknowledge this longstanding
sex discrimination and open their doors
to all undergraduates.

Invasion of Kuwait
doesn't compare to
Gaza Strip dispute
In response to the article "Speaker
decries U.S. role in the Middle East,"
Rev. William Sloan Coffin's quote perpe
trates a gross distortion of historical
facts. It is ludicrous to fashion a paral
lelism between Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
and the 1967 Arab-Israeli War.
Iraq's occupation and subsequent
looting of Kuwait represented nothing
less than naked aggression against a rel
atively helpless neighbor whose territory
and wealth Saddam Hussein coveted.
Iraq was never threatened by Kuwait in
any fashion. Saddam and his regime
have been justly branded as international
brigands by not only the United States
but the world community as well.
By contrast, Israel came into posses
sion of the West Bank and Gaza Strip as
a result of defending herself successfully
against an aggressive war launched
against her by Egypt, Syria, Lebanon
and Iraq. On May 27,1967, nine days
prior to the outbreak of war, President
Nasser of Egypt stated clearly and unam
biguously, "Our basic objective will be
the destruction of Israel."
The United States reacted quite dif-

Iraq's occupation and sub
sequent looting of Kuwait
represented nothing less
than naked aggression
against a relatively help
less neighbor whose terri
tory and wealth Hussein
coveted.

ferently to the Six-Day War in 1967 and
to Iraq's aggression against Kuwait in
1990 because the events themselves were
quite different. To attempt to establish a
linkage between the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict and the current Iraq-Kuwait cri
sis is something that simply won't hold
water.
