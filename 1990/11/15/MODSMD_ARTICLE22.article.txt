## Big Game action is really in stands 
### 
I'm not going to bore you
with predictions about how
the underdog Stanford Car
dinal is going to upset the bowl
bound California Golden Bears
in Saturday's Big Game. Nor
am I going to repeat cliches like
"In Big Game the better team
never wins" or "Expect the
unexpected in Big Game." It's
all been said and I'm tired of
hearing it.

Big Game. Big deal.
As I see it, the past several
Big Games haven't really been
terribly exciting football
games. Strangely enough, the
best team has won each of the
three Big Games I've watched.
I suppose that's why they
bother with keeping the score.
I expect the same will occur on
Saturday
Since the past several games
haven't been terribly enter
taining, and since everything
that can be said about Big
Game has already been written
this week, I'll write about
something infinitely less rele
vant but much more entertain
ing. The entertainment off the
football field.
No, it's not the yell leaders,
though if they're lucky they'll
get to partake in the annual
Meet-Your-Fellow-Fan-And-
Pummel-His-Face-In Big Game
Booster Slugfest.
You see, if Saturday's game
just doesn't hold your atten
tion and you're tired of arguing
about why California shouldn't
have accepted their bowl bid to
honor Martin Luther King,
then take a look at the crowd.
You're bound to see some
drunken incoherent idiot ham
mering on another sot's head.
It's just as fun as the World
Wrestling Federation, only
these people are really fighting
and they're doing it not in a
ring but in a crowd, where
those silly folks who come to
see a football game sit.
It happens every Big Game
and each year is stranger than
the previous one. So that you
know what to anticipate, I'll
give you a run down of some of
the more exciting of the recent
Big Game brawls.

Stanford won the 1984 Big
Game 27-10. After the
game, the jubiliant Cardi
nal fans rushed onto the field
to celebrate the victory. As The
Daily described it the following
Monday, the confrontation of
fans and police on the field
probably made Nikolai
Ceaucescu proud:
"[The fans] found a wall of
policemen and yellow-jacketed
security guards with no qualms
about getting physical with
anyone trespassing on the
Astroturf of Memorial Sta
dium. The situation grew ugly
when policemen began using
their billy clubs on uncoopera
tive fans."
The police were not grumpy
sore-loser Berkeley police,
mind you. This force consisted
of Stanford and Berkeley police
working together with a secu
rity force of Stanford and
Berkeley students.
Stanford police Captain
Raoul Niemeyer, defending his
officers against accusations of
excessive brutality, said that
"There was no misconduct on
their part [It was] the row
diest, rudest crowd of Stanford
students" that he had seen.
Niemeyer believed that the
policemen handled the situa
tion "as passively as possible."
Two years ago at Big Game,
which ended in a 19-19 tie with
Stanford keeping the Axe, the
crowd in Berkeley witnessed
perhaps one of the most bizarre
sights in Big Game history: a
fight between mascots. In the
third quarter, Oski and the
Tree squared off behind the
end zone in the Stanford sec
tion of Memorial Stadium.
After exchanging a few ini
tial punches, the brawling mas
cots wrestled each other to the
ground before the student
security contingent from Stan
ford could separate them. I'll
never forget watching Oski
stumble away from the fight,
stupidly unaware of the fact
that the right cheek of his cos
tume had been crushed in.
Similarly, the Tree walked
away literally crestfallen, as
the top third of his tree cos
tume had almost been knocked
off.
If such merriment isn't
entertaining enough for you,
consider last year's Big Game.
Stanford police arrest 27 peo
ple for "alcohol-related" inci
dents, several of whom were
charged with battery and other
serious crimes. Police officers
were pelted with rocks and full
