# Healthy Cooper is once again super
## 
### Harold Yu Staff writer 
The one thing that separates
bench-warming from NCAA
record-setting play is an offsea
son.
Enter exhibit A, Stanford mid
dle blocker Amy Cooper.
Last year around this time,
Cooper was jogging expectantly on
the sidelines during matches,
waiting for the call that never
came. This year, the Aurora, 111.
product is busy sprinting into col
legiate record books.
"Last season, I was an emo
tional wreck," Cooper said. "The
doctor told me I had two stress
fractures. I got out of shape. It
wasn't working out. I just
couldn't get off the ground."
But spectators at tonight's
Oregon State match will see a very
different picture. Cooper has
become a bulwark of the power
packed Cardinal offense and a
poster child of the Puritan work
ethic. Just ask coach Don Shaw.
"Amy is the perfect example of
how important an offseason is,"
Shaw said. "A lot of people don't
realize that. Last year she was
really frustrated but she took it
upon herself and decided she
would do something about it. It's
paid off."
That it has. Just ask the poor
souls from Nebraska, California,
Oregon and Washington. In her
matches against those four teams
this season, Cooper hit .600,
1.000, .565 and .545. In those four
matches, Cooper made no attack
errors, literally. The week of the
Nebraska match, Cooper hit over
.700 to earn Pac-10 Player-of-the-
Week honors.
Performances like these
account for her phenomenal
statistics. Cooper is hitting .363
on the year to lead the Pacific 10
Conference. She has 254 kills and
67 blocks, both third on the
squad.

California is probably the
firmest believer in these numbers.
Against the Bears, Cooper looked
pretty golden herself, tallying 13
kills in 13 attacks to record a per
fect 1.000 hitting percentage. In
terms of hitting efficiency, this
astonishing performance is the
best ever in the history of colle
giate volleyball. No player had
ever before tallied as many kills
while hitting 1.000 in a match.
"She is obviously one of the
hardest hitters on the team,"
freshman Heidi Eick said. "It's
hard for her to stand out when we
have Kristin (Klein) and Bev
(Oden). But she does."
And she always has. This kind
of success is not a novelty to
Cooper. In her freshman season,
Cooper hit a team-leading .334,
earning her All-Pac-10 honors.
She and fellow frosh Klein were
the fixtures on a team that went
27-2 in the regular season and was
ranked in the nation's top three
all year.
"The fact that we had to
replace three All-Americans in
Amy's freshman season is a credit
to her and Kristin," Shaw said.
"She came in to contribute right
off the bat and she did a great job.
Amy was a key person. We would
not have had that record without
her."
Shaw wasn't kidding either.
The squad lost 12 matches sans
vintage Cooper the following year.
A weight room accident after
her first season was the culprit.
Cooper suffered two stress frac
tures and a heavy dose of frustra
tion. She lost most of her offsea
son and with it, her competitive
shape.
Her injury meanwhile only
worsened. The pain became so
intense that she couldn't get off
the ground in a pre-match hitting
drill against Arizona. "Amy knew
getting hurt would cause her to
miss a lot of time," Shaw said.
"But she coped with it really
well."
That probably depends on your
definition of "cope." Cooper
groped with her relegated role
more so than her coaches may
have noticed. A dominant thirst to
contribute enveloped her
throughout the year. "I began to
feel that it was my fault we were
losing," Cooper said.
When you think about it, that's
a pretty big responsibility — for
someone who wasn't even on the
court — to take. But that may be
what Cooper is all about. Cooper's
first concerns are other people's,
especially when the other people
are her team.
"Amy's a great person," junior
hitter Jennifer Jackson said.
"She's really interested in other
people and what they're doing.
She's almost like a mother in a
good kind of way."
Her motherly instinct is giving

her some good signs right now.
With only three matches left in
her resurgent season, Cooper is
fully confident of her team's direc
tion. "I'm just excited to be doing
very well," she said. I want to get
Stanford back to the Final Four.
Every year that has been my goal.
I feel it's really close now."
Shaw feels it's really because of
players like Cooper. "Amy is a crit
ical player," Shaw said. "She's
always working her hardest and
her personality really adds to the
team. People notice when Coop
hammers the ball, but there are so
many other things she does out
there."
Hitting isn't a bad place to
start, though. Cooper hits hard,
really hard. And quick. "She adds
a lot to our team," Oden said.
"She has a really quick arm
swing." Cooper is one of those
players that makes sitting and
watching volleyball in tiny Burn
ham Pavilion a hazardous task.
But she also makes it a pleas
ant one. For her teammates and
her fans. "She's really funny,"

Eick said. "She jokes a lot and
she's always lending a helpful
hand. Amy makes us freshmen
feel at home."
Such appreciation is indicative
of the kind of respect Cooper com
mands and the kind she hopes to
further engender. "I can't recall
the number of comments I've got
ten from other coaches about how
much Cooper has improved,"
Shaw said.
Her ultimate goal is the U.S.
National Team and an engage
ment at the Olympic Games. Give
her a couple offseasons and she'll
be ready.
Card Notes
The ongoing national ranking saga
has appeared to reach a permanent
climax. UCLA, Nebraska and Stan
ford should finish one, two and three
in the rankingß. UCLA has lost only to
Nebraska this year. Nebraska has lost
to Stanford and the University of the
Pacific. Stanford has lost to UCLA
and UOP Barring any major upset in
the final week of the regular season,
this will be the final ranking order.

tures and a heavy dose of frustra
tion. She lost most of her offsea
son and with it, her competitive
shape.
Her injury meanwhile only
worsened. The pain became so
intense that she couldn't get off
the ground in a pre-match hitting
drill against Arizona. "Amy knew
getting hurt would cause her to
miss a lot of time," Shaw said.
"But she coped with it really
well."
That probably depends on your
definition of "cope." Cooper
groped with her relegated role
more so than her coaches may
have noticed. A dominant thirst to
contribute enveloped her
throughout the year. "I began to
feel that it was my fault we were
losing," Cooper said.
When you think about it, that's
a pretty big responsibility — for
someone who wasn't even on the
court — to take. But that may be
what Cooper is all about. Cooper's
first concerns are other people's,
especially when the other people
are her team.
"Amy's a great person," junior
hitter Jennifer Jackson said.
"She's really interested in other
people and what they're doing.
She's almost like a mother in a
good kind of way."
Her motherly instinct is giving

her some good signs right now.
With only three matches left in
her resurgent season, Cooper is
fully confident of her team's direc
tion. "I'm just excited to be doing
very well," she said. I want to get
Stanford back to the Final Four.
Every year that has been my goal.
I feel it's really close now."
Shaw feels it's really because of
players like Cooper. "Amy is a crit
ical player," Shaw said. "She's
always working her hardest and
her personality really adds to the
team. People notice when Coop
hammers the ball, but there are so
many other things she does out
there."
Hitting isn't a bad place to
start, though. Cooper hits hard,
really hard. And quick. "She adds
a lot to our team," Oden said.
"She has a really quick arm
swing." Cooper is one of those
players that makes sitting and
watching volleyball in tiny Burn
ham Pavilion a hazardous task.
But she also makes it a pleas
ant one. For her teammates and
her fans. "She's really funny,"

Eick said. "She jokes a lot and
she's always lending a helpful
hand. Amy makes us freshmen
feel at home."
Such appreciation is indicative
of the kind of respect Cooper com
mands and the kind she hopes to
further engender. "I can't recall
the number of comments I've got
ten from other coaches about how
much Cooper has improved,"
Shaw said.
Her ultimate goal is the U.S.
National Team and an engage
ment at the Olympic Games. Give
her a couple offseasons and she'll
be ready.
Card Notes
The ongoing national ranking saga
has appeared to reach a permanent
climax. UCLA, Nebraska and Stan
ford should finish one, two and three
in the rankingß. UCLA has lost only to
Nebraska this year. Nebraska has lost
to Stanford and the University of the
Pacific. Stanford has lost to UCLA
and UOP Barring any major upset in
the final week of the regular season,
this will be the final ranking order.

Junior Amy cooper, top, has rebounded from an injury-plagued
sophomore season to become one of the nation's most feared hitters.
She Is not a one-dlmenslonal player, however, and all of her skills have
been Instrumental to the team throughout the Cardinal's current
eight-match win streak.
The one thing that separates
bench-warming from NCAA
record-setting play is an offsea
son.
Enter exhibit A, Stanford mid
dle blocker Amy Cooper.
Last year around this time,
Cooper was jogging expectantly on
the sidelines during matches,
waiting for the call that never
came. This year, the Aurora, 111.
product is busy sprinting into col
legiate record books.
"Last season, I was an emo
tional wreck," Cooper said. "The
doctor told me I had two stress
fractures. I got out of shape. It
wasn't working out. I just
couldn't get off the ground."
But spectators at tonight's
Oregon State match will see a very
different picture. Cooper has
become a bulwark of the power
packed Cardinal offense and a
poster child of the Puritan work
ethic. Just ask coach Don Shaw.
"Amy is the perfect example of
how important an offseason is,"
Shaw said. "A lot of people don't
realize that. Last year she was
really frustrated but she took it
upon herself and decided she
would do something about it. It's
paid off."
That it has. Just ask the poor
souls from Nebraska, California,
Oregon and Washington. In her
matches against those four teams
this season, Cooper hit .600,
1.000, .565 and .545. In those four
matches, Cooper made no attack
errors, literally. The week of the
Nebraska match, Cooper hit over
.700 to earn Pac-10 Player-of-the-
Week honors.
Performances like these
account for her phenomenal
statistics. Cooper is hitting .363
on the year to lead the Pacific 10
Conference. She has 254 kills and
67 blocks, both third on the
squad.

California is probably the
firmest believer in these numbers.
Against the Bears, Cooper looked
pretty golden herself, tallying 13
kills in 13 attacks to record a per
fect 1.000 hitting percentage. In
terms of hitting efficiency, this
astonishing performance is the
best ever in the history of colle
giate volleyball. No player had
ever before tallied as many kills
while hitting 1.000 in a match.
"She is obviously one of the
hardest hitters on the team,"
freshman Heidi Eick said. "It's
hard for her to stand out when we
have Kristin (Klein) and Bev
(Oden). But she does."
And she always has. This kind
of success is not a novelty to
Cooper. In her freshman season,
Cooper hit a team-leading .334,
earning her All-Pac-10 honors.
She and fellow frosh Klein were
the fixtures on a team that went
27-2 in the regular season and was
ranked in the nation's top three
all year.
"The fact that we had to
replace three All-Americans in
Amy's freshman season is a credit
to her and Kristin," Shaw said.
"She came in to contribute right
off the bat and she did a great job.
Amy was a key person. We would
not have had that record without
her."
Shaw wasn't kidding either.
The squad lost 12 matches sans
vintage Cooper the following year.
A weight room accident after
her first season was the culprit.
Cooper suffered two stress frac
tures and a heavy dose of frustra
tion. She lost most of her offsea
