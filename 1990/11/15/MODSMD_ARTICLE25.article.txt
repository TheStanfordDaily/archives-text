# George now gets his kicks from football
## After a late start, former soccer player has become one of the Pac-10's top linebackers 
### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
When Ron George was a little
boy he dreamed of playing in the
World Cup. From the time his
family moved to then-West Ger
many in 1978 he did what every
other German boy does: he played
soccer. He played on school teams,
on Heidelberg club teams, and he
planned his future. He would be a
fullback for the German National
Team. He would help bring the
world title back to Germany.
Football wasn't even a consid
eration.
George added wrestling to his
athletic repetoire in high school,
but had no desire to hit the grid
iron. That was an American thing,
and air force base or no air force
base, he was living in Germany.
His next-door neighbor had
other ideas. The football coach of
Heidelberg American High School
thought George would be a perfect
addition to his team, and repeat
edly let him know that in the U.S.
football, not soccer, was the sport
of real men. After a year of harass
ment, George joined the team to
shut him up.
Goodbye, World Cup.
After not playing a single down
until midway through his junior
year, George is starting at outside
linebacker as a third-year sopho
more. And is leading the Pacific 10
Conference in sacks. Goalies,
quarterbacks, it's all the same to
George. Just give him a mission
and he'll come through.
"Out of high school I didn't
even think I'd play football again,
and once I decided on Stanford I
said 'okay, time to go onto just
school,' but when I got here the
gift horse breathed on me so I
took it," George said.

No one is complaining on this
side of the pasture. George is
developing into one of the pre
miere outside linebackers in the
conference, maybe in the nation.
With great speed to go along with
230 pounds on his 6-foot-2 frame,
he is a nightmare in the flesh to
opposing quarterbacks.
If he's not forcing them to eat
grass before they even get the ball
off, he's in their faces just gener
ally making life miserable.
He may have been a no-name
sophomore starting for a
maligned defense, but every signal
caller in the Pac-10 knows who
this Cardinal defender is now.
"There's no doubt that we
knew he was a talanted football
player. He's never played
linebacker before, he was always a
defensive back-type of player and
you never know how a player's
going to make that type of adjust
ment to a new position," said
coach Denny Green. "We moved
him the last part of last year when
he was sitting out and he looked
good enough that we gave him a
scholarship in January and he's
just come on like gangbusters.
"By far he's the most improved
player in the Pac-10 conference."
It's been a tough year for the
Cardinal's young defense, but if
the past two games are indicative
of the future, it is on its way to
being a force in the Pac-10, maybe
in the nation. George is one of the
reasons why. After playing in —
and starting — his first 10 games
at Stanford, the intense and
aggressive player is making a
rumble. He's third on the team
with 60 tackles, 17 unassisted.
He had 10 sacks. Has forced a
fumble. He's the Pac-10 Defensive
Player of the Week after sacking
Arizona quarterback George

Malauulu four times last week
end.
He's a football player now.
"He's had a spectacular year. I
think he is one of the most explo
sive outside linebackers in the
entire conference," Green said.
"He plays with a great deal of
intensity. Earlier in the year I
talked about having more quick
ness and speed off the perimeter.
You need it to apply pressure on
the quarterback and also to be
able to defend against the wide
game, and I think Ron's the best
there is at that.
"I personally feel he should be
a first-team All Pac-10 linebacker.
He has a great chance to be that
and to do that with two years to go
is an outstanding accomplish
ment."
Polite and friendly off the field,
George isn't making many friends
on opposing offenses. He doesn't
just sack a quarterback, he lets
him know who's in control. And
he plays every down like it's his
last.
When the little yellow flag hits
the turf and the ref motions per
sonal foul, eyes usually dart to
where George is. Meekness is not
his style.
But no one on a defense associ
ated with lackluster play in the
not-too-distant past is complain
ing.
Stanford is just thanking the
powers who be. Not only wasn't
George ever recruited, he ended
up on the Farm because of aca
demics and didn't even know if he
wanted to give football a shot. As a
freshman walk-on at the Air Force
Academy — it's kinda tough to be
recruited if you play on a different
continent — the All-Europe
player saw action on special teams

and was a back-up defensive back,
but he thought he was done with
the sport.
The Air Force just wasn't it.
George decided to transfer. Har
vard, however, was choice number
one. Green and staff won him over
to the Farm, but football was still
questionable. He transferred for
classes and professors, not to
spend hours at practice and meet
ings. He didn't think there'd be
time for both text books and play
books.
He didn't even like football
that much.
But after finding a way to com
bine Stanford's defensive schemes
and economics classes, George is
picking up an affinity for the
sport. Finally.
"It wasn't like one day I woke
up and said 'Wow, football is it!,' "
George said. "Football slowly grew
on me — like mold — to the point
where football is a real big part of
my life."
His goals however, have stayed
the same. Football has just
become a little more important.
George is at Stanford to learn.
Period. But now that success is
being achieved on the gridiron as
well as in the classroom, he
doesn't shy away from adding ath
letic ambitions to his collegiate
game plans.
"First and foremost I want to
do well in school, to learn as well
as to get good grades. But football
is a close second," George said.
"Eveiy day when I go onto the
field I want to give 100 percent
and individual goals are not bigger
than team goals.
"[Butl personally now I want to
have a greater field presence, I
want the other team to know that
I'm there. And I want to be Ail-
American in two years."

sive outside linebackers in the
entire conference," Green said.
"He plays with a great deal of
intensity. Earlier in the year I
talked about having more quick
ness and speed off the perimeter.
You need it to apply pressure on
the quarterback and also to be
able to defend against the wide
game, and I think Ron's the best
there is at that.
"I personally feel he should be
a first-team All Pac-10 linebacker.
He has a great chance to be that
and to do that with two years to go
is an outstanding accomplish
ment."
Polite and friendly off the field,
George isn't making many friends
on opposing offenses. He doesn't
just sack a quarterback, he lets
him know who's in control. And
he plays every down like it's his
last.
When the little yellow flag hits
the turf and the ref motions per
sonal foul, eyes usually dart to
where George is. Meekness is not
his style.
But no one on a defense associ
ated with lackluster play in the
not-too-distant past is complain
ing.
Stanford is just thanking the
powers who be. Not only wasn't
George ever recruited, he ended
up on the Farm because of aca
demics and didn't even know if he
wanted to give football a shot. As a
freshman walk-on at the Air Force
Academy — it's kinda tough to be
recruited if you play on a different
continent — the All-Europe
player saw action on special teams

and was a back-up defensive back,
but he thought he was done with
the sport.
The Air Force just wasn't it.
George decided to transfer. Har
vard, however, was choice number
one. Green and staff won him over
to the Farm, but football was still
questionable. He transferred for
classes and professors, not to
spend hours at practice and meet
ings. He didn't think there'd be
time for both text books and play
books.
He didn't even like football
that much.
But after finding a way to com
bine Stanford's defensive schemes
and economics classes, George is
picking up an affinity for the
sport. Finally.
"It wasn't like one day I woke
up and said 'Wow, football is it!,' "
George said. "Football slowly grew
on me — like mold — to the point
where football is a real big part of
my life."
His goals however, have stayed
the same. Football has just
become a little more important.
George is at Stanford to learn.
Period. But now that success is
being achieved on the gridiron as
well as in the classroom, he
doesn't shy away from adding ath
letic ambitions to his collegiate
game plans.
"First and foremost I want to
do well in school, to learn as well
as to get good grades. But football
is a close second," George said.
"Eveiy day when I go onto the
field I want to give 100 percent
and individual goals are not bigger
than team goals.
"[Butl personally now I want to
have a greater field presence, I
want the other team to know that
I'm there. And I want to be Ail-
American in two years."
When Ron George was a little
boy he dreamed of playing in the
World Cup. From the time his
family moved to then-West Ger
many in 1978 he did what every
other German boy does: he played
soccer. He played on school teams,
on Heidelberg club teams, and he
planned his future. He would be a
fullback for the German National
Team. He would help bring the
world title back to Germany.
Football wasn't even a consid
eration.
George added wrestling to his
athletic repetoire in high school,
but had no desire to hit the grid
iron. That was an American thing,
and air force base or no air force
base, he was living in Germany.
His next-door neighbor had
other ideas. The football coach of
Heidelberg American High School
thought George would be a perfect
addition to his team, and repeat
edly let him know that in the U.S.
football, not soccer, was the sport
of real men. After a year of harass
ment, George joined the team to
shut him up.
Goodbye, World Cup.
After not playing a single down
until midway through his junior
year, George is starting at outside
linebacker as a third-year sopho
more. And is leading the Pacific 10
Conference in sacks. Goalies,
quarterbacks, it's all the same to
George. Just give him a mission
and he'll come through.
"Out of high school I didn't
even think I'd play football again,
and once I decided on Stanford I
said 'okay, time to go onto just
school,' but when I got here the
gift horse breathed on me so I
took it," George said.

No one is complaining on this
side of the pasture. George is
developing into one of the pre
miere outside linebackers in the
conference, maybe in the nation.
With great speed to go along with
230 pounds on his 6-foot-2 frame,
he is a nightmare in the flesh to
opposing quarterbacks.
If he's not forcing them to eat
grass before they even get the ball
off, he's in their faces just gener
ally making life miserable.
He may have been a no-name
sophomore starting for a
maligned defense, but every signal
caller in the Pac-10 knows who
this Cardinal defender is now.
"There's no doubt that we
knew he was a talanted football
player. He's never played
linebacker before, he was always a
defensive back-type of player and
you never know how a player's
going to make that type of adjust
ment to a new position," said
coach Denny Green. "We moved
him the last part of last year when
he was sitting out and he looked
good enough that we gave him a
scholarship in January and he's
just come on like gangbusters.
"By far he's the most improved
player in the Pac-10 conference."
It's been a tough year for the
Cardinal's young defense, but if
the past two games are indicative
of the future, it is on its way to
being a force in the Pac-10, maybe
in the nation. George is one of the
reasons why. After playing in —
and starting — his first 10 games
at Stanford, the intense and
aggressive player is making a
rumble. He's third on the team
with 60 tackles, 17 unassisted.
He had 10 sacks. Has forced a
fumble. He's the Pac-10 Defensive
Player of the Week after sacking
Arizona quarterback George

Malauulu four times last week
end.
He's a football player now.
"He's had a spectacular year. I
think he is one of the most explo
sive outside linebackers in the
entire conference," Green said.
