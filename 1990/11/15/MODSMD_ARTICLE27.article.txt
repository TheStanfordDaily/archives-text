# Swim teams go up against California
## 
### Brandi Shipp 
The Stanford women's swim
famm will travel north today to
face off against California in the
last of a series of preseason
meets before the actual 1990-91
season gets underway for the
swimmers. At the same time, the
Stanford men's team will be
hosting the California swimmers
in a similar competition.
Both of the meets are actually
double-distance meets, where
the lengths of all regular events
are doubled.
For the women, under coach
Richard Quick, this meet will
not actually be scored, just like
the two previous meets of the

year. Instead, it will be used by
the two competing teams as a
guage with which to rate each of
the swimmers.
Consequently, almost every
one on the team will be compet
ing in this particular meet,
including two alumna who still
train with the team.
There has been a preseason
controversy with the women's
team regarding the eligibility of
sophomore Lea Loveless. Love
less, who transferred to Stan
ford from Florida, is being chal
lenged by the NCAA rule that
states that all transferring ath
letes must sit out of competition
for one year unless the univer
sity they left grants the athlete a

release.
Loveless was given a release
by the Florida coach, but due to
his later resignation, the Univer
sity recinded the release. Love
less was unsucessful in settling
the matter with Florida. "I tried
to deal with the university, but it
didn't work, so now I am appeal
ing to the NCAA," Loveless said.
There are several new faces
on the Stanford women's team,
including freshman Mary
Kelsey. Kelsey, who hails from
California, seems very optimistic
about today's meet, as well as
the team's upcoming season.
"We are a really close group with
a lot of enthusiasm. I know that
we are going to have a great

year," Kelsey said.
While the women are trying
to come out on top at Berkeley,
the Stanford men's team will be
here at deGuerre Pool, swim
ming towards a victory as well.
Led by veteran Jeff Rouse, who
is now ranked first in the world
in th 100-meter backstroke, the
Stanford men will be facing off
against the men of Berkeley in
their double-distance meet,
which will be their second meet
"Everybody is looking for
ward to getting some serious
racing in. It should be really
good to race new people," said
swimmer J.J. Freitag.
