## Undercover team keeps eye on Axe 
### Steve Mitzenmacher Staff writer 
The visible signs of Big Game week
end are appearing once again — an end
less array of commemorative t-shirts,
Gaieties posters and band rallies. But
one tradition, the Special Operations
Committee, remains invisible to the
public eye.
The committee, charged with the
duty of protecting the Axe from UC-
Berkeley, is shrouded in a veil of secrecy,
working undercover to prevent it from
being stolen when Stanford has it, and
stealing it when Stanford doesn't.
One member, who spoke on the con
dition of anonymity, only revealed, "We
like to have fun, maybe play some alpha
bet soup with signs in San Francisco. . .
. There are also some occasional mis
sions to UC-Berkeley to 'spruce up' the
campus."
When the committee does not have to

concentrate its energies on stealing the
Axe from UC-Berkeley, it spends its
time in "art class," changing the color of
signs from blue and gold to Cardinal
red. This year, a large cement "C"
overlooking the UC-Berkeley campus
mysteriously turned red, along with the
Sand U of the "South San Francisco"
visible from northbound Highway 101.
The member stressed that the com
mittee "is in no way related to the Axe
Committee, and no true history of the
organization is kept [because of] the
questionable nature of the group."
The Axe Committee keeps and pro
tects the cherished Axe — the symbol of
the Stanford-Berkeley rivalry — when
Stanford wins Big Game. Special Opera
tions, however, seems more concerned
that Stanford keep the Axe regardless of
the outcome of the football showdown.
Stanford has held the Axe for 36
months, since the 1987 Big Game. Pat
Broun, chair of the Axe Committee, said

his group "is always planning and think
ing of what might necessarily be needed
should the axe somehow be lost." In the
past, this is where Special Operations
has stepped in.
Students on the committee refused to
divulge details of how they protect the
Axe or of their current activities. The
Axe is kept in Tresidder Union in a case
with a burglar alarm.
The original Axe, brought by a Stan
ford yell leader to a hard-fought baseball
series in 1899 to rally the team against
UC-Berkeley, was stolen and held cap
tive by UC-Berkeley for 31 years. On
April 3, 1930, the "Immortal 21" men of
Stanford's Sequoia Hall outsmarted
"Cal's Grand Custodian," who was
transporting the Axe in an armored
truck. They stole the Axe and returned
it to the Stanford campus.
Since then, the Axe has been stolen
