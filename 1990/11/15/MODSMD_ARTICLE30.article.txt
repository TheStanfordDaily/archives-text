# INTERMISSION'S BIG GAME INDEX
## DON'T BE AFRAID Plot for Gaieties comes at right time 
### Michigan St. Pierre 
"Gaieties. We love Gaieties. We're
going to see it again and again."
Such were the words ringing out
across campus last November, after
Ram's Head Theatrical Society pre
sented its annual Big Game revue.
But just wait to hear what they'll be
saying this year.
Continuing the tradition as old as Big
Game itself, the wacky folks at Ram's
Head are at it again, this time bringing
us "Anachrophobia," which promises to
be the wildest Gaieties of them all.
As you'd expect, "Anachrophobia,"
which is the fear of being out of place in
time, is a light-hearted look at Stanford
life; from the ASSU Senate to a capella

groups, no one is immune from its rib
bing. While the plot is officially a
secret, Intermission has learned that it
includes the unlikely romantic coupling
of a schizophrenic resident assistant and
a 120-year-old freshman. The rest, we're
afraid, you'll just have to find out on
your own.
"Traditionally, Gaieties has focused
on accepted, well-known campus
jokes," says co-head writer Jeff Lipp
man. "It was 'nobody dates,' 'frat guys
are dumb,' 'Stern food is gross,' 'Branner
sucks' and 'Weenies are bad.' This is all
well and good, but how many times can
you recycle it?
"Co-head writer (Raphe) Beck
and I wanted to be a bit more bold.
We wanted to walk the line
between avant garde and out-of
hand. Some people will call us
cruel, but what do I care? I already
graduated."
Another change in this year's
show is that the traditional format
of loosely related sketches has been
replaced with a single, unified plot.
Says writing staff member Jen Der
wingson, "We felt that this was the
next logical step for the show.
"In 1988, there was a story
which tied the skits together; and
in 1989, there was a plot, though
the script often diverged from it.
For Anachrophobia,' we felt that if
we could work with the characters
for two hours instead of 10 min
utes, we could bring out the true
humor in them instead of relying
on stereotypes. Also, with a whole

show to develop a plot, we could do
more than just, 'the post office is
slow.' We could tell a story worth
hearing."
The concept of having a two
hour musical comedy to manage
was a challenge to first-time direc
tor William Thomas. Having
played the Ttee for the Band in
1988-89, as well as starring in Gai
eties last year, Thomas, a senior
majoring in philosophy, is no
stranger to Stanford audiences.
Nonetheless, he was, at first,
apprehensive.
"I was crazy about the idea of
directing, but I still wondered what
Nietzsche would have said about
it. I guess if he went to Stanford,
he'd probably have worked on Gai
eties too. You gotta come see it. It's
going to be swell."
This enthusiasm is shared by
Cindy Clumeck, who is appearing
in her third Gaieties. "The last two
shows were a lot of fun, and they
both turned out super. But for
some reason, this year is different.
Everyone is so excited about it. I

even heard that a woman who was
in Gaieties in 1986 wants to come
back and do a cameo this year.
Now that's excitement."
Though changes in the struc
ture of the script have been imple
mented, perhaps the most impor
tant change to Gaieties this year is
the greater use of special effects.
Pyrotechnics coordinator Greg
Sniff claims that a big part of it has
to do with an increasing reliance
on computers.
"Most Stanford students just
use their Macintosh to write papers
and play Tfetris. They never realize
what land of power this machine
has. We have all the major sound
and fire effects run on a single pro
gram. This is big league stuff. This
is Siegfried and Roy!"
The end result, of course, is a
theatrical event that is impressive,
to say the least.
Rounding out the major creative
elements in the show are original
compositions and choreography.
All of the music was written by a
staff led by Carolyn Shapiro, better

known as Marci of Marci and the
Moon Gods, and the opinion at
rehearsals is that it is some of the
best music written for Gaieties in
years.
From there, it became the
responsibility of choreographers
Kiko Korn and Allison Berry. "They
are, without a doubt, the best pair
you could have choreographing
this show," insists senior Charan
Devereaux, a veteran of many a
Stanford theatrical event.
Much of the work that goes into
this show is behind the scenes.
The responsibility for making Gai
eties the event that it is rests on the
shoulders of the literally hundreds
of people who volunteer thousands
of hours total to the production.
"I've been working on Gaieties
since February," claims producer
Rick Wolfgram, "but I love it.
Where else can a 20-year-old be in
charge of a project like this? It's
pure Stanford all the way."
Other jobs on the staff include
costuming, props, set design and
security. While the crowds are gen

erally cooperative, Bob Glouber
man is there just in case.
"When you have 1700 people,
many of them drunk, in a single
place, whipped into a frenzy by the
whole Big Game Week thing, you
can't be too careful. My job is a pre
cautionary one, but an important
one nonetheless. I trust that all
will go as planned."
Of course, none of this matters
if there isn't an audience, and
ticket sales for Gaieties are largely
dependent on word of mouth,
which in turn is determined by
how students felt about the previ
ous year's show.
As Howie Breinan, a Adams
House resident assistant, confided,
"I saw '(Follow) That Dog' and I
figured I'd seen just about enough,
but my roommate convinced me to
go last year, and that one was so
good that I already have my ticket
For this year."
Ram's Head, an entirely self
supporting, student-run organiza
tion, is well known on campus not
only for Gaieties, but also for its

Winter One Acts and its spring
musical.
Often seen as the bastard son of
an organization, Gaieties tends to
be the work horse of the trio, as its
ticket sales are needed both to run
Ram's Head throughout the year
and to pick up any financial slack
the other two shows may leave
behind.
Some seats remain for for this
year's show, and can be purchased
in White Plaza or by contacting the
Ram's Head office at 723-0801.
Gaieties only comes once a year,
and you certainly don't want to be
the only one on your hall who
doesn't know how many Delta
Gammas it takes to screw in a light
bulb.

Michigan St. Pierre is actually the
unbiased writing pair of director
William Thomas and head writer
Jeff Lippman. Intermission realizes
this may be a slight conflict of
interest, but we believe everyone
who claims to be a Stanford stu
dent must see Gaieties.

"In 1988, there was a story
which tied the skits together; and
in 1989, there was a plot, though
the script often diverged from it.
For Anachrophobia,' we felt that if
we could work with the characters
for two hours instead of 10 min
utes, we could bring out the true
humor in them instead of relying
on stereotypes. Also, with a whole

show to develop a plot, we could do
more than just, 'the post office is
slow.' We could tell a story worth
hearing."
The concept of having a two
hour musical comedy to manage
was a challenge to first-time direc
tor William Thomas. Having
played the Ttee for the Band in
1988-89, as well as starring in Gai
eties last year, Thomas, a senior
majoring in philosophy, is no
stranger to Stanford audiences.
Nonetheless, he was, at first,
apprehensive.
"I was crazy about the idea of
directing, but I still wondered what
Nietzsche would have said about
it. I guess if he went to Stanford,
he'd probably have worked on Gai
eties too. You gotta come see it. It's
going to be swell."
This enthusiasm is shared by
Cindy Clumeck, who is appearing
in her third Gaieties. "The last two
shows were a lot of fun, and they
both turned out super. But for
some reason, this year is different.
Everyone is so excited about it. I

even heard that a woman who was
in Gaieties in 1986 wants to come
back and do a cameo this year.
Now that's excitement."
Though changes in the struc
ture of the script have been imple
mented, perhaps the most impor
tant change to Gaieties this year is
the greater use of special effects.
Pyrotechnics coordinator Greg
Sniff claims that a big part of it has
to do with an increasing reliance
on computers.
"Most Stanford students just
use their Macintosh to write papers
and play Tfetris. They never realize
what land of power this machine
has. We have all the major sound
and fire effects run on a single pro
gram. This is big league stuff. This
is Siegfried and Roy!"
The end result, of course, is a
theatrical event that is impressive,
to say the least.
Rounding out the major creative
elements in the show are original
compositions and choreography.
All of the music was written by a
staff led by Carolyn Shapiro, better

known as Marci of Marci and the
Moon Gods, and the opinion at
rehearsals is that it is some of the
best music written for Gaieties in
years.
From there, it became the
responsibility of choreographers
Kiko Korn and Allison Berry. "They
are, without a doubt, the best pair
you could have choreographing
this show," insists senior Charan
Devereaux, a veteran of many a
Stanford theatrical event.
Much of the work that goes into
this show is behind the scenes.
The responsibility for making Gai
eties the event that it is rests on the
shoulders of the literally hundreds
of people who volunteer thousands
of hours total to the production.
"I've been working on Gaieties
since February," claims producer
Rick Wolfgram, "but I love it.
Where else can a 20-year-old be in
charge of a project like this? It's
pure Stanford all the way."
Other jobs on the staff include
costuming, props, set design and
security. While the crowds are gen

erally cooperative, Bob Glouber
man is there just in case.
"When you have 1700 people,
many of them drunk, in a single
place, whipped into a frenzy by the
whole Big Game Week thing, you
can't be too careful. My job is a pre
cautionary one, but an important
one nonetheless. I trust that all
will go as planned."
Of course, none of this matters
if there isn't an audience, and
ticket sales for Gaieties are largely
dependent on word of mouth,
which in turn is determined by
how students felt about the previ
ous year's show.
As Howie Breinan, a Adams
House resident assistant, confided,
"I saw '(Follow) That Dog' and I
figured I'd seen just about enough,
but my roommate convinced me to
go last year, and that one was so
good that I already have my ticket
For this year."
Ram's Head, an entirely self
supporting, student-run organiza
tion, is well known on campus not
only for Gaieties, but also for its

Winter One Acts and its spring
musical.
Often seen as the bastard son of
an organization, Gaieties tends to
be the work horse of the trio, as its
ticket sales are needed both to run
Ram's Head throughout the year
and to pick up any financial slack
the other two shows may leave
behind.
Some seats remain for for this
year's show, and can be purchased
in White Plaza or by contacting the
Ram's Head office at 723-0801.
Gaieties only comes once a year,
and you certainly don't want to be
the only one on your hall who
doesn't know how many Delta
Gammas it takes to screw in a light
bulb.

Michigan St. Pierre is actually the
unbiased writing pair of director
William Thomas and head writer
Jeff Lippman. Intermission realizes
this may be a slight conflict of
interest, but we believe everyone
who claims to be a Stanford stu
dent must see Gaieties.
"Gaieties. We love Gaieties. We're
going to see it again and again."
Such were the words ringing out
across campus last November, after
Ram's Head Theatrical Society pre
sented its annual Big Game revue.
But just wait to hear what they'll be
saying this year.
Continuing the tradition as old as Big
Game itself, the wacky folks at Ram's
Head are at it again, this time bringing
us "Anachrophobia," which promises to
be the wildest Gaieties of them all.
As you'd expect, "Anachrophobia,"
which is the fear of being out of place in
time, is a light-hearted look at Stanford
life; from the ASSU Senate to a capella

groups, no one is immune from its rib
bing. While the plot is officially a
secret, Intermission has learned that it
includes the unlikely romantic coupling
of a schizophrenic resident assistant and
a 120-year-old freshman. The rest, we're
afraid, you'll just have to find out on
your own.
"Traditionally, Gaieties has focused
on accepted, well-known campus
jokes," says co-head writer Jeff Lipp
man. "It was 'nobody dates,' 'frat guys
are dumb,' 'Stern food is gross,' 'Branner
sucks' and 'Weenies are bad.' This is all
well and good, but how many times can
you recycle it?
"Co-head writer (Raphe) Beck
and I wanted to be a bit more bold.
We wanted to walk the line
between avant garde and out-of
hand. Some people will call us
cruel, but what do I care? I already
graduated."
Another change in this year's
show is that the traditional format
of loosely related sketches has been
replaced with a single, unified plot.
Says writing staff member Jen Der
wingson, "We felt that this was the
next logical step for the show.
"In 1988, there was a story
which tied the skits together; and
