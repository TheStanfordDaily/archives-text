# INTERMISSION'S BIG GAME INDEX
## DON'T BE AFRAID Plot for Gaieties comes at right time 
### Michigan St. Pierre 
"Gaieties. We love Gaieties. We're
going to see it again and again."
Such were the words ringing out
across campus last November, after
Ram's Head Theatrical Society pre
sented its annual Big Game revue.
But just wait to hear what they'll be
saying this year.
Continuing the tradition as old as Big
Game itself, the wacky folks at Ram's
Head are at it again, this time bringing
us "Anachrophobia," which promises to
be the wildest Gaieties of them all.
As you'd expect, "Anachrophobia,"
which is the fear of being out of place in
time, is a light-hearted look at Stanford
life; from the ASSU Senate to a capella

groups, no one is immune from its rib
bing. While the plot is officially a
secret, Intermission has learned that it
includes the unlikely romantic coupling
of a schizophrenic resident assistant and
a 120-year-old freshman. The rest, we're
afraid, you'll just have to find out on
your own.
"Traditionally, Gaieties has focused
on accepted, well-known campus
jokes," says co-head writer Jeff Lipp
man. "It was 'nobody dates,' 'frat guys
are dumb,' 'Stern food is gross,' 'Branner
sucks' and 'Weenies are bad.' This is all
well and good, but how many times can
you recycle it?
