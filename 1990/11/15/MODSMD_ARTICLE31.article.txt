All the way from Georgia
Georgia in the U.S.S.R., that is. The Georgian State Dance
Company returns to San Francisco for a two-week engagement until
Nov. 25. The world famous, sabre-wielding Soviet dancers are per
forming at the Golden Gate Theatre, 1 Taylor Street at Market.
Tickets range from $20 to $39.50, and schedule information is
available at 243-9001. Catch them before Georgia becomes inde
pendent.
All the way up
It's almost time for Tahoe, and the Office of Student Activities
has an event that will whet any skier's appetite for self-destruction.
Just before everyone takes off for Thanksgiving dinners, the Office
will present Warren Miller's "Extreme Winter," the sire of snow ski-
new film showing great places to ski and even greater skiers
skiing there. The film, which is part of a series of Miller's spectacu
lar skiing spectacles, will be shown Tuesday at 7:30 in Memorial
Auditorium.
All the way to TV
Think you're funny? Want to become a major TV star? It may
never happen, but you will get a shot at the Warholian 15 minutes
of fame this Friday, when "America's Funniest People" comes to
White Plaza to seek "amusing or unusual talents." That means any
thing from celebrity impressions to funny pet antics, or whatever
else you think is funny. Or more importantly, that other people
think is funny. The television crew will be taping from 11 a.m. to 3
p.m. for the new show, to broadcast on ABC.
