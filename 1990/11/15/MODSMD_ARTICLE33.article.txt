# 3-D Batman needs another dimension
## 
### John Louie Editorial staff 
In many ways, John Byrne is
to the comic industry what Jose
Canseco is to baseball: both are
indisputably excellent in their
respective fields, but both are
also jerks.
Okay, maybe that's about as
far as the analogy goes. But
while no comic fan can criticize
Byrne's talent as a writer and
artist, many fans simply don't
like him. A recent issue of
"Comics Interview" dubbed
Byrne a "menace" to the indus
try because of his aggravating
ability to skip from project to
project.
Every six months or so, after
entering a new project with fer
vor and enthusiasm, Byrne
ducks out to take the creative
reins on some other new and
exciting project. Fans of conti
nuity have a hard time liking
Byrne.
However it's hard to ignore
his stellar work, which has
grazed the pages of "Super
man," "Wolverine," "X-Men,"
"Fantastic Four," "Namor the
Submariner," "Alpha Flight,"
"The Incredible Hulk." and
"The Man Of Steel." If Byrne
ever opted to stay on a title for
longer than two years, fans
could admire his loyalty as well.
"Batman 3-D" is a prime
example of Byrne's flighty style.
But this time, when he chan
nels his talent through the
exploits of the immensely pop
ular Dark Knight, Byrne comes
up incredibly short. The comic
book, presented in graphic
novel format and accompanied
by 3-D glasses, is hardly worthy

of the pristine packaging.
The 3-D effects, touted as
entering a "new dimension in
comics," are far from revolu
tionary. The comic industry
went through its 3-D hysteria
decades ago in the 19505, and
independent publishers have
churned out the occasional 3-D
special in recent years.
Ray Zone, responsible for
the 3-D effects of "Batman 3-
D," seems almost limited bv
the panels of the story, whicn
often display no more action
than the normal two-dimen
sional comic. When viewed
through the special glasses, the
red and blue double images
effectively add a dimension of
depth. But although word bub
bles jump off the page and per
spective seems more realistic,
there are no flying objects leap
ing off the page or characters
jumping towards you.
The sedate storyline can be
largely attributed to Byrne, who
fails to create suspense or even
drama despite using some of
Batman's more popular villains,
including Penguin, Riddler,
Joker and TWo-Face. A separate
pin-up section of Batman pan
els show more action than the
main story itself.
It's almost ironic that the
title of Byrne's 4 8-page story is
"Ego Trip." "Batman 3-D," for
Byrne, is exactly that; nothing
more than a resume-building
experience.
If the talented writer and
artist had taken more time to
create an interesting story or
exciting 3-D effects, the book
may have been worth the spe
cial format. As it stands, "Bat
man 3-D" clearly lacks depth.
