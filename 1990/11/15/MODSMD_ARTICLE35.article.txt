Hi there, and welcome to yet another cool,
COOL, nay — dare we say it? — FREEZIN'
issue of Intermission! We're so COOL this
week, you're gonna need MITTENS to turn
these pages!
We've got a Gaieties preview so FRIGID
they're moving to FROST Amphitheatre, and a
Big BIG BIG Game index that registers NEGA
TIVE on the Kelvin scale! So grab a SNOW
PLOW, check your anti-freeze and CHILL OUT
with Intermission: We're so cool COOL COOL
. . . we're HOT!
Not.
It's 7:00 on a Monday evening and there's
nothing to do. My laundry is folded. My room is
clean. I've clipped, trimmed, filed, waxed and
buffed each of my toenails. Sure, I have a 12-
page research paper due tomorrow, but I can
drop the class — "it isn't in my major." Being
undeclared has its privileges.
But the boredom grows unbearable. My
hands tremble. I start to shake, I start to cough.
I need something to distract me, and fast . . .
Lying on the table are two campus weeklies.
In one corner, Release Magazine. In the
other, The Stanford Review. I look to one. I look
to the other. I look at my toenails again, and
wonder if they could use a touch-up yet.

No luck. I would either have to read Release
and sacrifice my intelligence, or read The
Review and sacrifice . . . my intelligence. Boldly,
I choose the former and, deftly avoiding Tarty
Pics/ open it to . ..
WHAT'S THE FLICK? From one fantastic
Julia Roberts movie to the next, Sunday Flicks
has had a rocky time this year. It started with a
near mob scene as eager students made like a
Who concert trying to get into late Flicks. And
what were they so anxious to see? "Citizen
Kane?" "Casablanca?" A little "Lawrence of
Arabia," maybe? "No, Bob, I'm gonna have to
go lower." Hry "Pretty Woman."
Not that "Pretty Woman" was a bad movie,
per se, but it did kind of fall under that waste-of
good-blank-film, leave-your-brain-at-the-dorm,
no-it's-not-cute-it's-stupid, dog-breath-awful
hunk-of-junk sort of genre.
I didn't even think Julia Roberts was all that
pretty — and if a movie has nothing but looks
going for it, that means problems anyway.
Maybe if they had just called it "Woman," I'd
have enjoyed it more.
In contrast, I had no problems at all with the
title "Flatliners" — it sums up the movie's
scriptwriting quite well. Other names may have
been equally fitting, of course — "Flaccidplot
ters," "Flimsysceners," "Flippantthemers" —
but the truest title of the night belonged to those

of us in the audience: "Flickslosers."
Enough. I turn the page over; and discover...
KZSU "ON THE AIR:" I tried. I really, really,
really, really tried. But try as I might, I could not
understand a single sentence on this page. In
their almost paranoid efforts to avoid the main
stream, KZSU has become screwier than a
Stonehouse punt.
But "Alternative" is the catch phrase at
KZSU, especially for the music, which ranges
from "Mildly Alternative" (They Might Be
Giants, Skinhead O'Connor) to "Even More
Alternative" (Mistress Puppy Innards, The Har
monic Chainsaws) to "Hellaciously Alterna
tive" (Carpenters, Air Supply).
Most college stations, it seems, carry this
"alternative" policy to the extreme: The fewer
