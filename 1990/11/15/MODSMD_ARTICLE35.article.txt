Hi there, and welcome to yet another cool,
COOL, nay — dare we say it? — FREEZIN'
issue of Intermission! We're so COOL this
week, you're gonna need MITTENS to turn
these pages!
We've got a Gaieties preview so FRIGID
they're moving to FROST Amphitheatre, and a
Big BIG BIG Game index that registers NEGA
TIVE on the Kelvin scale! So grab a SNOW
PLOW, check your anti-freeze and CHILL OUT
with Intermission: We're so cool COOL COOL
. . . we're HOT!
Not.
It's 7:00 on a Monday evening and there's
nothing to do. My laundry is folded. My room is
clean. I've clipped, trimmed, filed, waxed and
buffed each of my toenails. Sure, I have a 12-
page research paper due tomorrow, but I can
drop the class — "it isn't in my major." Being
undeclared has its privileges.
But the boredom grows unbearable. My
hands tremble. I start to shake, I start to cough.
I need something to distract me, and fast . . .
Lying on the table are two campus weeklies.
In one corner, Release Magazine. In the
other, The Stanford Review. I look to one. I look
to the other. I look at my toenails again, and
wonder if they could use a touch-up yet.

No luck. I would either have to read Release
and sacrifice my intelligence, or read The
Review and sacrifice . . . my intelligence. Boldly,
I choose the former and, deftly avoiding Tarty
Pics/ open it to . ..
WHAT'S THE FLICK? From one fantastic
Julia Roberts movie to the next, Sunday Flicks
has had a rocky time this year. It started with a
near mob scene as eager students made like a
Who concert trying to get into late Flicks. And
what were they so anxious to see? "Citizen
Kane?" "Casablanca?" A little "Lawrence of
Arabia," maybe? "No, Bob, I'm gonna have to
go lower." Hry "Pretty Woman."
Not that "Pretty Woman" was a bad movie,
per se, but it did kind of fall under that waste-of
good-blank-film, leave-your-brain-at-the-dorm,
no-it's-not-cute-it's-stupid, dog-breath-awful
hunk-of-junk sort of genre.
I didn't even think Julia Roberts was all that
pretty — and if a movie has nothing but looks
going for it, that means problems anyway.
Maybe if they had just called it "Woman," I'd
have enjoyed it more.
In contrast, I had no problems at all with the
title "Flatliners" — it sums up the movie's
scriptwriting quite well. Other names may have
been equally fitting, of course — "Flaccidplot
ters," "Flimsysceners," "Flippantthemers" —
but the truest title of the night belonged to those

of us in the audience: "Flickslosers."
Enough. I turn the page over; and discover...
KZSU "ON THE AIR:" I tried. I really, really,
really, really tried. But try as I might, I could not
understand a single sentence on this page. In
their almost paranoid efforts to avoid the main
stream, KZSU has become screwier than a
Stonehouse punt.
But "Alternative" is the catch phrase at
KZSU, especially for the music, which ranges
from "Mildly Alternative" (They Might Be
Giants, Skinhead O'Connor) to "Even More
Alternative" (Mistress Puppy Innards, The Har
monic Chainsaws) to "Hellaciously Alterna
tive" (Carpenters, Air Supply).
Most college stations, it seems, carry this
"alternative" policy to the extreme: The fewer

listeners they can get, the better job
they think they're doing. Go
ahead, try calling a college D J some
night. Tne worst insult you can
give her is "Hey, all of us here love
your show." The second worst is
"How about some George
Michael?"
As I closed the pages, my Dear
Friend Chester walked in the door.
"Release?" he asked, pointing at
the paper.
"Gladly," I replied, and dropped
it to the floor
Boredboredboredboredbored. I
try catching dust specks with
tweezers. I bet myself how many

spit bubbles I can fit onto my
tongue. Oh, what the heck, I
finally decide, Let's go zany.
Tbenail check. Negative. I glance
at the table, where Stanford's other
entertainment weekly still sits. Cau
tiously, I pick it up and open it to ..
"HEY! You aren't reading The
Review, are you?"
Uh-oh. TYouble. I'd been caught
looking at The Stanford Review. If I
didn't think fast, I knew my social
life was over — no average Stan
ford liberal/activist would ever talk
to me again. Sure, I'd still have all
my Sigma Chi friends, but they're
on probation.
"Um ... Oh, NO, heh. I was
just. .. cleaning around the toilet,
and didn't want to waste any paper
towels." Phew.

Safe in my room, skimming the
tabloid-sized pages (hmm ... ), I
laugh at that crazy Review mental
ity ... or lack thereof.
Not that I have anything against
conservatives. Really. Some of my
best friends are conservatives. I
dress conservatively I give conser
vative estimates. Sometimes I even
conserve water.
But let's face it: our local reac
tionary publication is funnier than
our local humor magazine. Thie,
that's not saying much, but what
other paper spends a third of every
issue spewing about how well all
minorities are doing, another third
whining that they themselves are
the constant victims of prejudice
by a liberal majority and the final
third regurgitating jokes about the
Cultures, Ideas and Values tracks?

As I closed the pages, My Dear
Friend Chester walked in the door.
"Review?" he asked, pointing at
the paper.
"No thanks," I replied. "Once
was enough."
Still bored. Now restless. My
mind begins to wander: What
weighs more, a stack of unread
Releases or a stack of unread
Reviews? Don't be silly, I tell
myself. You know that neither car
ries any weight whatsoever.
But the worst thought is yet to
come: WHAT IF a horde of Review
ultra-conservatives took over
Release magazine? I imagine, with
horror, the resulting editors' meet
ing. . .
"Well, men, how does our Fash
ion '90 cover look?"
"It's bound to make waves, sir:

one Polo, two Izods and a cardi
gan."
"Smashing. Why doesn't some
one read our introduction?"
"'hot hot Hot HOT HOT air!
Welcome to Release. And inciden
tally, the way that CIV classes have
taken out the major authors and
let so many little ones go through,
no wonder it's pronounced tne
'sieve' requirement. Hot hot.'"
"Hey, that's pretty funny, that
bit you snuck in about CIV. What
do we say about movies?"
"They're all socialist 'plots.'"
"And restaurants?"
"Socialist."
"What about the Party Page?"
"Social list."
"And finally, how do our 'Party
Picks' look?"

"Republican, Republican,
Republican, Democrat."
"Democrat?"
"The Party Fool, Sin"
Snap out of it, Chris. I gathered
the two weaklies, wondering what
to do with them next. My toilet
was clean. Flicks wasn't for days.
They didn't even make good paper
weights.
As I closed the pages, My Dear
Friend Chester walked in the doot
"Recycle?" he asked, pointing at
the paper.
And I knew I'd found the one
place for them both.

Chris Harris is currently fulfilling
his lifelong dream of majoring in
International Relations, "if only
for a day." And this time, he really
has written a "bi-weekly" column.
