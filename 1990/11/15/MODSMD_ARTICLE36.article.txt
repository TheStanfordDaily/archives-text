# Valley offers new Chinese dining experience

When I first heard of the new
China Valley Restaurant in Los
Altos, I wondered what this restau
rant could possibly offer that
would differentiate itself from the
hundreds of others in this area.
Much to my surprise, China
Valley did deliver a unique concept
in Chinese dining, as much from
their atmosphere as from their
food.
The combination of hanging
foliage and peaceful music was a
surprising but refreshing change
from what I had come to expect
from a Chinese restaurant. Along
with the fully stocked wine rack —
much more common in a French
or Italian restaurant — and the
bright lighting, the overall result
was quite pleasing.
My companion and I began our
meal where one rightly should —
with appetizers, and lots of them.
We had a little trouble deciding
exactly where to start, so we threw

caution to the winds and ordered
the Po Po Plate, a combination of
almost every appetizer on the
menu. Golden hied prawns, egg
rolls, barbecue pork, crab-cheese
puffs, fried chicken wings and
teriyaki beef all came neatly placed
in a tray, with a miniature grill in
the middle.
We found the crab-cheese puffs
— fried won tons stuffed with crab
and cream cheese — to be espe
cially good, though we did doubt
the authenticity of their Chinese
heritage.
From there we branched out to
soup, hot and sour soup to be
exact. Aside from containing lots
of fresh vegetables and pieces of
tender meat, this was fairly stan
dard.
Feeling quite confident about
our selection ability thus far, we
unhesitatingly forged ahead to the
main course. Though we ourselves
are amazed at our digestive ability,
we managed to polish off not one,
not two, but THREE entrees:
minced chicken in lettuce cups,
sizzling beef and prawns with Chi

nese walnuts.
All of the the food we tasted was
prepared very well, with adequate
seasoning. Especially noteworthy,
however; was the lack of grease so
often found at other Chinese
restaurants.
Though it may seem like we
tried everything, the menu at
China Valley is quite extensive,
with a number of exotic dishes and
tofu specialties. And, for those
non-meat eaters, the chef/owner
informed us that any dish on the
menu could be made "vegetarian"
upon request.
The prices on the menu seemed
perfectly competitive with other
places as well. Most of their dishes
were in the range of $6 to $7, and
the portions were huge. One could
easily eat at this restaurant for
about $10 a person. In addition,
there are three standard dinners
which range from $8.95 to $9.95
per person; each of these include
two-three appetizers, soup, two
entrees and rice.
China Valley also has inexpen

sive lunch specials — 24 of them
— priced between $4.50 and
$4.75. All include soup, salad,
fried won ton, fresh fruit and your
choice of fried or steamed rice.
While I would not drive all the
way to get take out from them
(despite the 10% discount), the
good food and the fresh California
style decore definitely make it
worth the extra 10 minutes to drive
to Downtown Los Altos for a pleas
ant weekend dinner.
