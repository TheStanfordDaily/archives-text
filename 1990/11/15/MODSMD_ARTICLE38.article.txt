## MORE TO MUSIC Dan Levitin Phil Ramone: Producing Dylan, Simon, Joel 
### 
Phil Ramone is widely considered to
be one of the great producers in rock.
He has enjoyed long-lasting relation
ships with Paul Simon and Billy Joel
and has worked with artists as notable
and as diverse as Paul McCartney, Bob
Dylan, Lou Reed, Gloria Estefan and
Barbara Streisand.
His career has been consistently
successful for more than 20 years; he
has received eight Grammy Awards
and 12 nominations, not counting
those of the artists he has worked with.
Intermission managed to catch
Ramone between recording sessions to
ask him about his work.
Intermission: You recorded two
albums for Dylan, "Blood on the
Tracks" and "Before the Flood." My per
ception of Dylan is that he seems to
rely a great deal on inspiration and
spontaneity in his performances. How
do you create a well-crafted record with
someone who's so spontaneous?
Phil Ramone: If you understand
what Dylan is about, he comes to the
studio with what I call prepared spon
taneity. You never know what key he's
going to play in or when he's going to
play what. He performs in such a way
that the first thing he does is what
comes out most eloquently. He's not a
guy you go in and overdub, so you just
build your records around him, know
ing that.
The first time I recorded him, he
just came in with a bass player and
played the seven or eight songs he was
going to do, front to back, with about
an hour and a half of tape rolling. Then
we talked to the CBS people, and he
went back out and did it again. Maybe
the second time around the bass player
played better notes. We chose what we
liked. When he worked with Robbie
Robertson and The Band, those things
were choreographed and yet a lot of it
was left open, so that if he just decided
he wanted to sing another verse, he
could do it.
I: Working with Paul Simon or Billy
Joel has got to be very different...
PR: Definitely. For one thing, with
someone like Dylan you don't sit there
with him during the writing process.
He doesn't share that time with you,
whereas they'll [Simon and Joel] snare

unfinished songs — a missing verse,
alternate chord ideas, things like that
— with you, and so you're a lot closer
to what the songs are about.
I: Does that make you feel more
removed from him?
PR; No. Bob's a very nice man. He's
not what you'd call a high-intensity
conversationalist, but you don't need
that. You have your moments of pri
vacy with somebody, and you enjoy
them. But my way of working is not to
break that code of professionalism and
privacy that the artist sets up, whatever
that may be. Dylan treats the people he
works with in a completely profes
sional manner. Sometimes the doctor
patient-type thing is vital, so that you
keep from getting too close. He shares
what he needs to.
I: You've been with Billy Joel for
more than 10 years and at least that
many albums. In a case like that, does
it become difficult maintaining dis
tance?
PR: You do grow closer personally.
Billy's my child's godfather, and Paul
Simon — whom I named a son after —
and I are still close friends.
But there is a line when you are
employed by someone. You keep your
self somewhat at a distance so that
they have it clear in their minds that
you didn't party the last two nights
Decause you had work to do, maybe
some editing at 8:00 the next morning
that was more important. That's what
I consider the proper relationship
between an artist and a producer.
I've always thought a producer's job
is to be the objective director of action;
you need to know what's going on with
an artist because their emotional state
may be reflected in their work, in the
change of a lyric, for instance. But you
get enough intimacy working with
them 10 and 12 hours a day in the stu
dio. It's not necessary always to spend
the weekend with them.
I: It must be kind of strange to get
dumped after working with someone
for a while and then they move on to
somebody else.
PR: When the producer or artist
makes a change, the work they did
together remains.

I: I'm thinking of three situations in
particular. I thought "The Bridge" was
one of Billy Joel's best albums, repre
senting a new maturity in him as a
songwriter: The three albums you did
with Paul Simon, "Rhymiri Simon,"
"Still Crazy" and "One Trick Pony"
were very important albums in his
career. And many people think that
"Blood on the Tracks" was the last great
Dylan album. But each of these artists
used someone else for their next record.
Why do you think this happened, fol
lowing such peaks in their careers?
PR: Other than the obvious reason
of a scheduling conflict, if an artist
takes a new step forward, he is explor
ing a different reaction from the public
as well as within himself. In Paul's
case, after the soundtrack and the
movie came out, there were other
things in the way of us working
together, but we came back together to
talk and work on certain things
together for "Graceland."
You mentioned artistic maturity.
The public's perception of that isn't
always immediate. I thought "The
Nylon Curtain" was one of the best
things Billy had done, but a lot of peo
ple started calling it"The Nylon
Shmata" (Yiddish for "rag"), which I
thought was a terrible thing to say to
someone who's bared their soul writing
for a year. If we had instead put out
"Innocent Man II" or "Return of the
Innocent Man" I think thafwould have
been a big failure.
Take Springsteen's "Nebraska." I
don't think that 'platinumized' a lot of
people's offices, or decorated their
walls, but now it's considered a great
piece of work. And it's an album, a
transitional album, he had to make.
The tragedy of it is, the record busi
ness demands that you have hits
almost every time out. And if a pro
ducer has a relationship with someone
over a number of years, at some point
the time will come where someone, be
it the artist or the producer, will say, I
think I'd better go make a movie some
where else.
Nothing lasts forever. Every time
somebody calls me up and says, 'I'd
like to make another album with you/
I'm, like, 'Oh! Well, great!'
