Danny Elfman
Music For a Darkened Theatre
Grade: B-
Danny Elfman likes the dark.
As the lead singer of Oingo Boingo, Elf
man and his band have toyed with dark
themes since the start, including "Dead
Man's Party" and "When The Lights Go
Out."
In his solo career Elfman has also stayed
in the shadows.
One may not recognize Elfman's solo
work as easily because his songs lack his dis
tinctive vocal sound. However, as a film and
television theme song composer, Elfman has
enjoyed a separate, successful career
"Music For A Darkened Theatre: Film &
Television Music Volume I" collects Elf
man's orchestra music, which probably
appears in more places than one would
expect.
Although Elfman received extensive pub
licity for his musical contributions to "Bat
man," "Dick H-acy," "Darkman" and"The
Simpsons," some of his other scores shine
equally bright.
Elfman primarily deals in two styles of

orchestra music with his scores: brooding,
haunting pieces and light, quick-tempo
songs. The themes from "Batman" may be
Elfman's most famous "scary" score, but his
"Nightbreed" and "Darkman" scores share
similar melodramatic themes.
These songs are marked contrasts from
themes from "Pee Wee's Big Adventure,"
"Back to School" and "Hot to TVot," which
glide along with their peppy beats.
Most of the album's tracks have numer
ous excerpts from the movie or television
show, allowing listeners to hear many varia
tions of the same basic melody. However, the
highlight of the album, the theme from"The
Simpsons," is good enough to stand on his
own.
With "Music For A Darkened Theatre,"
Elfman only partially asserts his orchestral
talent. Perhaps he snould worry less about
redefining himself in a new genre of music,
and concentrate on creating more original
themes, instead of just rehashing the same
chords.
Then, Elfman may very well get the
chance to actually enter the spotlight.
