# Faculty, students discuss DR changes
## 
### Margaret Fitzpatrick 
Four members of the Faculty Senate
and 23 concerned students met in Toyon
Hall last night to discuss the proposed
changes to the distribution require
ments for undergraduates.
Peter Duus, history professor and
chair of the Committee on Undergradu
ate Studies, opened the discussion with
a brief explanation of the changes pro
posed by his committee and the ratio
nale behind them.
The committee's proposal includes
changing the number of requirements
from 10 to 11, condensing two social sci
ence requirements into one, adding
World Cultures and American Cultures
areas, and adding an "asterisked" gen
der studies requirement.
Duus explained the main reason for
the new approach: "It reflects a concern
by people in undergraduate studies and
others in the community that the pre
sent structuring of distribution require

ments doesn't pay enough attention to
areas of knowledge that undergraduates
in the '90s will need."
Thomas Wasow, dean of undergradu
ate studies, added that the distribution
requirements should not only introduce
students to a broad range of modes of
inquiry, but also educate them to be
responsible members of society.
Chad Walters, a junior in symbolic
systems, expressed concern that the
decreased number of social science
requirements would create a deficiency
in the breadth of the undergraduate
curriculum.
Anthropology Assoc. Prof. Sylvia
Yanagisako said there has been no real
outcry by the social sciences faculty over
the committee's proposal, because in all
likelihood, the World Cultures and
American Cultures requirements would
be met by social science courses.
Jack Rakove said that as a professor
of American history, he has reservations
about the American Cultures require-

distribution requirements

ment. He explained that in his classes
and in other classes in the History
Department, a successful effort is
already made to encourage awareness of
diversity in race and ethnicity and gen
der issues.
Rakove described the current ratio
nale for the new American Cultures
requirement as "spongy" and suggested
a need for "more academically
grounded" reasons.
Kirstin Sword, a senior in anthropol
ogy and feminist studies, disagreed with
Rakove's assertion that gender and eth
nic diversity issues are already ade
quately addressed.
