Unity 2
What Is It. Yo?l
Grade: A-
Combine reggae and rap and what do you
get? "Ragamuffin hip-hop/' Unity 2 style.
This band, fronted by Lionel "N6n6"
Bernard from Haiti and Sean "Cavo" Dins
more from Brooklyn, plays a unique combi
nation of American and Caribbean beats,
creating a distinctive style that is a refreshing
change of pace from the often oversampled,
overmixed hip-hop produced today.
The Unity crew's third album takes off
from the start with the title song, a hyped
introduction to the duo's rap stylings, sup
ported by a funky reggae beat.
The first single, "Shirlee (You're My
Girlie)," is probably the album's weakest
song, with a tedious chorus overbearing a
smooth example of the band's music.
But the rest of the album hits the mark
with lively reggae, hearty horn arrange
ments, a unique vocal combo and fun —
while occasionally socially conscious —
lyrics.
"Brooklyn Story" focuses on the racial
violence in New York state, hitting hard with
the line "Remember the man they call
Bernard Goetz/ Tbll me is he wrong, or is he

white?" And "Buckwheat the Rebel (Without
a Soul)": "Once upon a time I had girlies and
cash/ Now I'm just a crack head, looking
through trash."
They're no Public Enemy, nor are they
Bob Marley. But they do a solid job bringing
the two styles together, with enough funk of
their own to stand out in their own category.
