# Whitney and Tiffany: Pop princesses face off with new albums
## Whitney wins with right mix 
### 
Whltn«y Houston
I'm Your Baby Tonight
Grade: A
If Whitnev Houston is the
female equivalent of Michael Jack
son, this album is her "Thriller:"
Which doesn't mean that it will
sell 10 million copies or that fad
craving teenagers will be flocking
to stores to buy "Whitney Jackets."
It does mean that it's her most
intoxicating album yet, and it
avoids the pitfall of overproduction
that has plagued her in the past.
"I'm Your Baby Tbnight" was
produced by seven different pro
duction crews, making each song a
refreshing variation on a style that
is definitely Houston's own.
L.A. Reid and Babyface pro
duced the album's most alluring
cuts, bringing out Houston's ener
getic edge on songs like the title
track and first single, and perform
ing magic similar to that done by
Quincy Jones with Jackson's afore
mentioned smash.

That edge is sharpened even
more on "My Name Is Not
Susan/' a biting response to a
case of mistaken romantic
identity.
Even Houston's "Greatest
Love of All"-type tracks on
this album are noteworthy
for more than their noble
lyrical premises. "Mira
cle" brings a fuller and
more appealing sound
to a similarly styled
song.
Sure, many of
the cuts are typical
of her past works,
but they show a self
assured maturity that brings out
the best elements from those
efforts.
Round all that out with a duet
with Stevie Wonder and you have
an album that finally does Hous
ton's talent justice. Let's just hope
her next record, like Jackson's, isn't
"Bad."
