# Tiffany's lost in new direction

It's hard to take Tiffany seri
ously, whether she's performing at
shopping malls, bringing the
movie version of "The Jetsons"
to a grinding halt, or singing
lines like "When we're all
alone it feels so right/Making
love to you all through the
night."
So naturally I was skepti
cal when I read that
Tiffany was taking her
career in a "new direc
tion." It turned out to
be a co-opting of the
least interesting
aspects of rap music
into her already
candy-coated pop style.
The most annoying exam
ple of this is "Tiff's Back," which
features self-promoting lyrics with
none of the macho braggadocio or
humorous metaphors that make
them so appealing in rap.

Granted, most of the problems
Tiffany faces are the result of mis
guided packaging and producing
efforts. Unfortunately though, pop
ularity has not yet led the young
pop princess to take control of her
career, develop her own style and
mature musically.
Tiffany still seems confused,
empty and emotionless. The songs
she sings are written by others, and
she doesn't know them or under
stand them enough to instill them
with the proper feelings.
Occasionally, she lucks out and
comes up with an inspired perfor
mance, as happens on "Never Run
My Motor Down." But the good
songs are few and far between, con
sidering the lackluster vocal perfor
mances and the insipid mixture of
sappy pop styles.
Time may grant Tiffany the
experience and direction she needs.
Until then, however, I'll take my
love songs from someone who's
actually experienced the emotions.
