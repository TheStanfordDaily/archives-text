# Van Morrison still enlightening after 24 albums, waiting to get respect

Van Morrison
Enlightenment
Grade: B
What does it take to get noticed in this
business, anyway?
"Enlightenment" is Van Morrison's
24th solo album, and once again Van the
Man has shown that he can compose,
arrange and sing music as few have ever
been able to do.
Yet no one seems to notice. Not even

the "classic-rock" radio stations give him
his due. Sure, everybody knows "Brown-
Eyed Girl" and "G-l-o-r-i-a." But a lot of
people would tell you the latter song was
written by some other guy named Morri
son.
Just try to name somebody else who can
match The Man for both quality and quan
tity.
Dylan? Hey, Bob is a God, but "Under
the Red Sky" just doesn't cut it. The
Stones? Once every two or three years.

Maybe Neil Young, if you ignore such
stunning failures as "Reactor," "TYans" and
"Landing On Water."
So, what has the Rodney Dangerfield of
popular music offered us this time around?
Yet another solid album.
Musically, as always, the album is very
good. From the horns section which starts
the album's first track, "Real Real Gone,"
to the accordion on the final track, "Mem
ories," Morrison's arrangements are fresh
and compelling.

Other songs such as "Avalon Of The
Heart," "Youth of 1,000 Summers" and
"She's My Baby" also offer endearing
melodies, even if lacking in lyrical content.
Indeed, where "Enlightenment" falls
short of greatness is in its scarcity of lyrics.
On the other hand, Morrison often
transcends this repetition with the varia
tions of his vocals.
In fact, there are some signs of his lyri
cal successes of the past, even if they come
in small doses. For instance, the album's

title track, in its mocking of those who
take themselves too seriously, contains the
comment, "Every second, every minute/It
keeps changing to something different/
Enlightenment, don't know what it is."
Granted, "Enlightenment" is no
"Moondance" or "Astral Weeks," albums
which the uninitiated should purchase
long before Morrison's latest effort.
But "Enlightenment" deserves more
than a little respect.
