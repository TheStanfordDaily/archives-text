## Classy film depicts sleazy Von Bulow case 
### 
Reversal of Fortune
Jeremy Irons, Glenn Close
Grade: 8+
The case of Claus Von
Bulow, a New England socialite
accused of attempting to mur
der his wife with insulin injec
tions in 1982, was one of the
most publicized and sensational
cases of the decade.
It is very easy to assume that
a screen version of this tabloid
story would come off like a 2-
hour segment of TV's "Hard
Copy." But under the persistent,
methodical direction of Barbet
Schroeder and a terrific trio of
actors, "Reversal of Fortune"
delivers the sleazy goods in a
classy, mature and thoroughly
entertaining way.
This is trash for the sophisti
cated.
The story is told by Sunny
Von Bulow in a series of voice
overs, as she lies in a coma after
injecting herself (or being
injected) with a lethal amount
of insulin.
The film follows the case
from when Boston lawyer Alan
Dershowitz agrees to defend
Claus. There are flashbacks
throughout the story, which
show the Von Bulows' passion
less marriage and Sunny's
downward spiral into alcohol
and drug abuse.
Jeremy Irons and Glenn
Close play the high society cou

pie. Irons, a British actor who
has a tendency of delivering his
lines in a wooden, haughty way,
uses this demeanor to his
advantage.
His portrayal of Claus as a
debonair, enigmatic snob is
humorous but spooky — one
can sense the innate charm (or
is it deceit?) of this subdued
gentleman. At one point, he
buys cigarettes at a convenience
store and asks the cashier if she
can sell him any insulin. "Just
kidding," he winks.
Close, whose role is trivial
since she is in a coma except for
a few flashbacks, is icy and
pathetic as Sunny. Her lack of
love for both her husband and
her lifestyle is apparent, and
Close's tired, worn out perfor
mance is right on target.
But the actor who steals the
show is Ron Silver, who plays
the animated, hyperactive Der
showitz. He takes Von Bulow's
case for the challenge, not
because he believes his client is
innocent.
Unlike "Jagged Edge" and
"Presumed Innocent," two pre
vious courtroom dramas,
"Reversal of Fortune" is based
on a true story and thus lacks
the final meloaramatic theatrics
of its predecessors. Schroeder's
film may never quicken your
pulse, but it will certainly give
your brain a good workout.
