# 'Krays' intrigues with sinister British mobsters

The Krays

Grade: fl+
Silly me — I used to think all
gangsters were Italian.
Watching "The Krays" has cer
tainly opened my mind — I have
no doubt these English bad boys
have enough style and sinister
traits to hold their own with any
Godfathers or Good Fellas.
Based on a true story; "The
Krays" stars Gary and Martin
Kemp (of Spandau Ballet) in a
frightening yet fascinating por
trayal of twins Ronnie and Reggie
Kray. The film follows their violent
lives from their backstreets child
hood in the 1940s to their arrival
as kingpins of the London under
world in the 19605.
But make no mistake about it,
this is not your average gangster
flick.
Granted, the movie has all the
blood and guts you would expect,
complete with disgustingly realis
tic sound effects, (which I hope
your stomach can handle better
than mine). However, other "typi
cal" ingredients of a mob film are
missing, the most noticeable being
the exact nature of the Krays'
shady dealings.
And what we get is an intriguing
glimpse into the workings of two
twisted minds, and the relation
ships of which they play a part:
that of two brothers; that of a
mother and her sons; and that of
men and women in post-war Eng
land.

As the Krays grow, so does the
strength and tension of the rela
tionship between them.
United, their obsession with
power makes them famous, and
infamous, and is ultimately the
destructive force in their lives.
An amazing contrast to this
coldbloodedness is the extremely
close relationship which the boys
have with their mother, played by

Billie Whitelaw.
It becomes apparent that Mom
is the one who has had the real
strength, with the power to sustain
a family through the hard years of
war and to offer unquestioning
support for her sons despite their
questionable professions. It is
almost comic to watch her bring
ing trays of tea and biscuits to
meetings of hooligans in dark suits

in the close upstairs of her own
home.
Yet it is bitterness between the
sexes which is the most pervasive
element of the film. Mrs. Kray calls
the home a battle ground, and all
her female relatives repeat how
men never grow up and how they
have spent their lives obsessed
with the toys of war.
