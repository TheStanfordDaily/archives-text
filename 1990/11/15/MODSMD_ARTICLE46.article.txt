Graveyard Shift Jmßv;-;
David Andrews, Kelly Wolf
Steven King Is one of the world's most
prolific writers of horror. He Is also one of the
world's most successful writers of horror. So
why Is It then, that movies based on his best
seller novels are always complete flops?
Grantou, "Carrie" was acceptable, as was
"The Shining.* But, without exception, the
rest of the films were pure garbage. And this
Is no exception. It's not even worth going to
for a laugh, as !s "Maximum Overdrive."
Sibling Rivalry
Klrstle Alley, Jaml Gerfz and a whole slew of
unfortunate others
This movie had potential. A decent cast,
a proven director and good exposure. But I
guess It should have been obvious to every
one that this film was not going to be a win
ner. A woman marries her Insensitive hus
band for security reasons, regrets It and Is
too wishy-washy to get a divorce. So she
has an affair, And the man dies In bed. And
turns out to be her husbands long-lost
brother. Yawn.
White Palace
Susan Sarandon, James Spader
James Spader has quite the admirable
career, don't you think? You disagree? But
just take a look at his past successesl In
'Less than Zero," Spader played a sleazy
drug dealer who also dabbled In prostitu
tion. And In "Bad Influence," he took sec
ond billing to Rob Lowe, who stole his wife
and ruined his life. And most recently.
Spader Is teamed up with Sarandon (quick,
name a movie In which she has not had sex
with anyone) as a Jewish yuppie who falls
for a older, lower class woman. Come on,
how many other actors can you name that
have played such terrible roles In such horri
ble movies and still gotten to work again?
