# 'Bridge' in troubled water

### 
Graffiti Bridge
Prince, Morris Day
Grade: D
"Prince's Sludge" would have been a bet
ter title.
"Graffiti Bridge," Prince's newly released
movie, operates on unplanned, random
logic. Instead of any freshness, or even nov
elty, this adds a certain fetid triteness to the
film.
The storyline is simple enough: two
brothers own adjacent nightclubs left to
them by their father Competition for busi
ness, and survival, rests on the popularity of
each club's acts.
One brother; Morris Day, is a slick, greedy
operator who performs hip, if shallow,
music.
The other Prince, performs to some level
of spiritual depth and integrity as expressed
in his music. Prince's club is the less suc
cessful of the two and this sets up a conflict
between ideologies.
Prince is marketing himself as a '60s ide

alist-hippie, complete with long hair,
exposed chest and dangling chains. He is
also setting himself up as a Christ-figure
with an ascetic, devoted lifestyle.
Even I became choked up by some of his
longing, meaningful glances, though not
with tears. With an acidic bile.
On top of this Christian mythology is var
ious zodiac, occult, alchemical ana crayola
imagery. And more of the simple, ridiculous
latter tnan anything else.
The movie is nothing more than a con
fusing clump of symbols and references. The
images seemed to be saying: stare at things
long and hard enough and something will
happen.
Yeah, like sleep.
Some of the most interesting pieces in
this movie were the female performers,
despite their being relegated to absurd, back
ground positions. Apparently, this degrada
tion was meant to add humon
I didn't get it, but then again, I was fool
enough to stay for the whole movie.
