TUne In Tomorrow
Barbara Hershey, Peter Falk
Grade: C*
I usually have two reactions when I hear
the term "romantic comedy." First, I think of
the wonderful, wry humor of TYacy and
Hepburn films, the wit and wisdom of
"When Harry Met Sally".
But soon the warm feeling in my heart is
replaced by a turning in my stomach caused
by dreadful thoughts of other "romantic
comedies": the saccharine "Pretty Woman"
and the mindless "Bird on a Wire."
It was with these dualistic expectations
which I went to see the new romantic com
edy, "Time In lb morrow." On paper, I'm sure
this film looked like a winner. In fact, on
paper this story was the internationally
acclaimed novel oy Mario Vargas Llosa, Aunt
Julia and the Scriptwriter
Set in 1951 New Orleans, the main story
of "Time In Tbmorrow" revolves around the
six month romance of Martin (Keanu
Reeves), a 21 year-old newswriter at the local
radio station WXBU and an aspiring novel
ist, and Julia (Barbara Hershey), his sexy 36-
year-old, twice divorced, free-spirited aunt by

marriage, who has returned to town after
leaving 20 years earlier.
While these two are the focus of the
movie, everything is effected through Pedro
Carmichael (Peter Falk), a disheveled, enig
matic and eccentric scriptwriter of soap
opera serials.
Hired by low-rated WXBU for his "bril
liant" writing, Carmichael sky rockets the
ratings with a hilariously sleazy and far
fetched serial about a brother and a sister
who are passionately in love and the rest of
their tacky, licentious family
Pedro derives material for these artistic
creations by eavesdropping, plagiarizing, and
even manipulating the private lives around
him.
Sounds interesting, huh, like the makings
of an elaborately constructed and uniquely
funny movie, "a truly uproarious comedy"
(David Sheehan, KNBC-TV)? Well, guess
again. "Tbne In Tomorrow." is a clock
watcher
The reason rests in the fact that most of
the movie centers, not around the life-force
Falk as Pedro, but instead around a romance
which isn't the least bit interesting.
