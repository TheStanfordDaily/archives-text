# Unearthing a dark past
## Soviet finds names of Stalin's victims 
### Mike Laris Staff writer 
At age 26, Dmitrii Yurasov has
already done more to influence Soviet
history than most leaders three times
his age.
While working during the 1980s in
Soviet federal archives containing
Stalin-era documents, Yurasov cataloged
a list of approximately 250,000 names of
military, state and party officials perse
cuted under Joseph Stalin's harsh rule.
Yurasov smuggled pocket-sized note
books full of these names past govern
ment security guards each night as he
left work.
Yurasov is on campus this week as
part of a research tour to meet with
Soviet specialists at U.S. universities. He

met informally with students in Slavian
ski Dom on Wednesday and spoke at the
Hoover Institution yesterday.
Documents illustrating Stalin's
repression during the 1930s are fiercely
guarded and independent historians do
not have access to many of them. With
information from the classified materi
als, Yurasov was able document hun
dreds of thousands of individual cases of
arrest, deportation and execution.
Only in the last three years have Sovi
ets begun to openly criticize Stalin's
totalitarian methods.
In the late 1980s, after Yurasov wit
nessed government officials burning
documents, he gave up his quiet
information gathering activities and

exposed the government's
actions.
Against Soviet government
wished, he started "single-hand
edly declassifying these docu
ments," Yurasov said in a Tuesday
interview with The Daily. "I
wanted to report this right away
without waiting for official per
mission."
The forbidden history of the
Stalin era had fascinated him
since he was 13 and he read
opaque accounts of the period in
an encyclopedia, Yurasov said. At
that time, he began to keep small
notebooks recording inexplicable
Cages and vague references,

35 Soviet scholars at Hoover yes
terday.
By his early twenties, Yurasov
had become a technical expert at
organizing archives. He was so
skilled that the government made
an "astonishing" blunder and
hired him without realizing his
party credentials were suspect, he
said.
The government's decision to
hire him gave Yurasov wide access
to classified files. He began pub
lishing materials documenting
victims of Stalin's purges before
dramatic changes were codified in
the Soviet Union.
He was fired, his house was
searched, various research mate
rials were confiscated and he was
arrested.
But Yurasov continued pub
lishing articles underground.

When political conditions allowed,
he published articles in above
ground journals, totaling more
than 200 articles in the last two
years.
Yurasov is also a founding
member of the previously clandes
tine Memorial Society, a group
dedicated to documenting Stalin
era repression. He has traveled to
50 cities in the Soviet Union to
organize Memorial information
centers.
Through conversations, ques
tionnaires published in 25 news
{>apers and magazines, and 35,000
etters containing information,
the society was able to expand the
"card catalog" of Stalin's victims'
names. Yurasov calls this catalog
"a national treasure."
Today, even Soviet children's
history books acknowledge the
millions of atrocities of the period,
according to Hoover senior
research fellow Robert Conquest.
Conquest, along with the Center
for Russian and East European
Studies, organized Yurasov's visit
to Stanford.
"[Yurasov] got out the facts
more than any other person in the
Soviet Union," Conquest said.
Yurasov said he will continue
seeking names and will also seek
further details about the names
already gathered.
"I will try as much as I can to
concretize the names of people,
their biographies, so these will not
be lost in the future, so they will
be remembered, conserved," he
said. "Through this, there will be
a historical memory of 'people of
the past.'"

Coast meetings with Soviet schol-

ars, Yurasov went on a detour
that may have been more power
ful than anything on his schedule.
He saw a black granite symbol of
his idea of "historical memory" -
the Vietnam War memorial.
"It may be a blot on American
history," he said, "but even nega
tives must be preserved."
Yurasov said there is still not a
good faith effort by the Soviet gov
ernment to uncover the atrocities
of the past. In mid-1988, Yurasov
and other scholars demanded
access to KGB files from the
Stalin era, but were denied, he
said at Hoover.
"Everything remains almost as
it had been then â€” secret," he
said. "Don't be misled by the
things in journals about the open
ing of archives." According to
Yurasov, only limited archives
have been opened.
"This is typical of our pere
stroika," he said.
He added that to prevent
Stalin's repression from repeating
itself, the complete story must be
told, and fundamental judicial
reforms must be instituted.
"I am lucky because I not only
have work that is in full accord
with my conscience, I also have a
way to see it come to fruition, to
make a difference, to make things
happen," he said.
"It's kind of a cross. These obli
gations torment you, bring you
joy," he said. "You really don't
have time to be young."
