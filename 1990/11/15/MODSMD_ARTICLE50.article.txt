# 'Allegro' confuses, fails its expectations

Allegro Non Troppo
Bruno Bozzetto
Grade: D
I don't understand it.
It couldn't have been a lan
guage barrier problem because
I'm fairly fluent in Italian.
Besides, there were subtitles.
And it couldn't be that I just
have absolutely no sense of
humor; because IVe been told
otherwise. And not just by my
mother
So there's really only one
thing that it could be. But I'm
afraid to say it. Why? Because.
Because I saw the coming
attractions for "Allegro Non
Ttoppo," and I was so sure I was
going to love it.
It was supposed to be a cross
between "Fantasia" and "Yellow
Submarine." It was supposed to
be a brilliant parody of Walt
Disney, and everything he rep
resents to the American public.
It was supposed to be every
thing I love in a movie.
It was supposed to be funny.
And it was anything but.
Even as I'm writing this, I'm
afraid that some of you — or all

of you — are going to have seen
this film and absolutely adored
it. I'm afraid it's just me.
I mean, even Ebert (Of Siskel
and) liked it. A lot!
But the truth is, I hated "Alle
gro Non Ttoppo." Very much. If
I hadn't been reviewing it, I .
wouldn't have watched the
whole thing. As it was, my
attention wandered.
I thought that the writing
was horrible, the plot tasteless
and the animation pitiful. The
only thing decent about the film
was the music, and the direc
tors had nothing to do with
that.
Basically, "Allegro Non
"froppo" is a bunch of animated
shorts put to music, without
the style and innovation of
"Fantasia." And without the
humor of anything else.
I would like to tell you more
about "Allegro Non Ttoppo,"
but I have no idea what it was
about. I would have given it an
T' but Stanford policy says no
one can fail. Besides, I might
just get to review something I
dislike even more.
But I doubt it.
