WHY YOUR NeXT?
Before you decide on a personal computer, here are a
few important reasons why you should consider a NeXT:

Performance: NeXT workstations are among
the fastest desktop computers available, delivering 15
MIPS* of performance. That's faster than the fastest
Macintosh or 486 PC.
Ease Of Use: The NeXT operating system is
powerful, flexible and easy to use, combining the power
of UNIX with a state-of-the-art graphical user interface.
Display Postscript eliminates jagged images and type for
any font, size or angle and lets you clearly see your work
exactly as it will print.
Breakthrough Software: There are
more than 100 powerful applications for NeXT computers
with many more soon to come since the NeXTStep
environment allows programmers to create powerful new
applications faster than on any other system. That's why
Lotus Development chose the NeXT computer to create
Improv, their revolutionary new spreadsheet.
Connectivity: You can easily exchange files
between your NeXT and Macintosh or DOS computers.
You can even execute your favorite DOS programs inside
the NeXT operating system.
Price: Just as amazing as the NeXT computer is its
price. Stanford students and faculty can buy a complete
NeXTstation system for $3153. Plus, for a limited time
we'll include Lotus Improv, an $695 value, free.
That's no misprint. $3153.
