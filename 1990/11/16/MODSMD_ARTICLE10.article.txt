# Gay rights leader envisions unified community
## 
### Anita Presser Staff writer 
Harry Hay, founder of the first mqjor gay
rights organization, spoke at Branner Hall
last night, describing his struggle against
oppression.
"No gay men existed in the 19305....
We were heteros who performed perverted,
degenerate acts," said Hay, who was accom
panied by his biographer, Stuart Timmons.
As a gay student at Stanford, Hay said
he experienced disastrous consequences
when he "declared himself" to his peers in
1931.
"We didn't come out, we branded our
selves," he said. People avoided him when
they learned of his homosexuality, thinking
it would not be prudent to be seen with
him.

"I was hurt, but I was an actor and I pre
tended not to see anything," Hay contin
ued. When he told fellow Glee Club mem
bers, they responded by saying, "It doesn't
show — you still sound like a bass." He
dropped out later that year.
Hay is credited with being the founder of
the modern gay rights movement. "I knew I
carried a beautiful gift inside myself... at
the moment I could learn how to struggle
against oppression," he said.
As a community leader, Hay said he felt
a responsibility to bring the gay community
together and struggled to develop a "posi
tive image" of gay men, to "define ourselves
as we wished to be defined."
The movement adopted the term
homophile — love of the same — as an
alternative to "homosexual," which had
negative connotations at the time. The

movement also "took dirty words and made
them words of honor with a sense of joy and
being ourselves," Hay said.
Hay founded the Mattichine Society, the
first successfully organized group for gay
men, and the Radical Faerie movement,
which was concerned with the ongoing
needs of gay people.
The Mattichine Society began as an
underground, secret society where "people
could let their hair down," Hay said. "Men
would go dressed up in suits with their sis
ters and introduce them as their wives."
During the 19505, gay men were consid
ered "spiritually deformed," Hay said. "We
had a very negative picture of ourselves."
Men convicted of partaking in a "homo
sexual activity" faced harsh punishments,
sometimes a choice between a long prison
term or castration, Hay said. "Cops had a

quota system where they had to turn in a
certain number of homosexuals per week. "
If a man were charged with being gay, his
name, address and workplace would be
printed in newspapers. "He would be driven
out of town," Hay said. "You would lose
everything."
As a member of the Communist party
and a homosexual, Hay faced a "double
taboo." His struggle for reforms included a
"showdown" with Senator Joe McCarthy,
who led a widespread anti-Communist cam
paign in the 19605.
Hay said he envisions the future of the
gay movement as a society governed by con
sensus rather than democracy. "We as gay
people understand this, and we need to
teach others how to operate on consensus,"
he said. "I am placing the burden on you."
