BONN, Germany (AP) — Chancellor
Helmut Kohl said yesterday that Ger
many will send emergency supplies to the
Soviet Union in case of a food crisis this
winter.
In Washington, U.S. officials said the
Bush administration is also developing
contingency plans to provide emergency
food and medicine to the Soviet Union to
tide it through the winter.
The announcements came on the same
day that Leningrad's City Council voted
to begin widescale food rationing on Dec.
1 — for the first time since the Nazi siege
in World War 11.
Kohl spoke during a special session of

Parliament in which he summarized his
talks last weekend with Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev. The opposition con
vened the session to discuss the Persian
Gulf crisis.
The chancellor told legislators that
during talks with Gorbachev on Friday he
promised that Germany would assist the
Soviet Union financially "to the best of
our powers." The talks followed the sign
ing of a far-reaching cooperation and non
aggression treaty between the two coun
tries.
Specifically, he said, Germany would
send emergency shipments of food to the
Soviet Union "in case of acute supply

crises."
Concern has grown that the Soviet
Union could face serious shortages of
food and other essentials this winter,
causing extreme hardship and possibly
provoking civil unrest.
European Commission President
Jacques Delors earlier this week said the
fear of famine in the Soviet Union is one
of the European Community's biggest
concerns. A European source said it will
be one of the main topics at an EC sum
mit in Rome on Dec. 13.
In Oxford, England, Foreign Secretary
Douglas Hurd announced yesterday that
Britain will provide $39 million worth of

expertise to the Soviet Union over the
next two years.
He said help would be given in the
areas of food distribution and agriculture,
energy, small business formation, and
financifd services.
The Foreign Office also said a similar
fund for Eastern Europe will be doubled
to $58.5 million in fiscal 1991-2
U.S. officials said they are considering
using U.S. emergency disaster programs
to help the Soviets, airlifting food and
medicine, and dispatching technicians to
help solve transportation problems.
There is no decision yet to go ahead, the
officials stressed.

President Bush is expected to discuss
the situation with Gorbachev next week
during a 34-nation summit meeting in i
Paris.
The U.S. officials said their plans for .
emergency aid were prompted in large ,
measure by fear that internal strife may •
escalate in the Soviet Union. "It's a tense '.
moment, and it's anyone's guess whether 112
there is going to be some out-and-out con
frontation," one official said.

the Soviets during the transition from a
