# Senate committee holds S&L hearing

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Senate Ethics Committee opened
trial-like public hearings yester
day on the "Keating Five," with
the panel's lawyer declaring the
lawmakers helped the owner of a
failing savings and loan fight an
"all-out war" with federal regula
tors.
Special counsel Robert Bennett
said in his opening statement that
Sens. Alan Cranston and Dennis
DeConcini "were important play
ers" in Charles Keating's strategy
to stave off federal rules and that
Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr. "played
a much greater role" than he now
contends.
Speaking in a packed hearing
room, Bennett said Sens. John
McCain and John Glenn played
lesser roles. The lawyer spoke for
about five hours yesterday and
will resume this morning.
Before Bennett spoke, the

chairman of the six-senator com
mittee, Alabama Democrat How
ell Heflin, somberly told the sub
jects of the inquiry, "Many of our
fellow citizens apparently believe
that your services were bought by
Charles Keating, that you were
bribed, that you sold your office,
that you traded your honor and
your good names for contribu
tions and other benefits."
Keating contributed $1.3 mil
lion to campaigns of, and causes
favored by, the five senators.
While Bennett denied his role
was prosecutorial, Sen. David
Pryor, D-Ark. testily told him,
"You're beginning to reach per
sonal conclusions and deciding
what is relevant and what is not
relevant."
Bennett responded "It's less
my conclusion and more the objec
tive evidence."
