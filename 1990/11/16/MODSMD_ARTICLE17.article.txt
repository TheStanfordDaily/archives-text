# Romanians ask for: a new government

BRASOV, Romania (AP) —
Tens of thousands of Romanians
rallied against the government
yesterday, turning an anniversary
of the first mcyor protest against
Communist dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu into a denunciation of
his successors.
The rallies were fueled by
unrest over government reforms
that have tripled food prices, and
by resentment over President lon
Iliescu's having served as a Com
munist official years ago under
Ceausescu.
Demonstrators also took to the
streets of the capital Bucharest,
Timisoara, Constanta, Ploiesti,
lasi and Sibiu, demanding Ili
escu's resignation.
In Bucharest, up to 50,000
demonstrators converged on
Palace Square, where protesters
died in last year's uprising, and
marched to government head
quarters.
The protesters, including many
students, shouted anti-Iliescu slo
gans and jeered the price
increases. Thousands remained
on the streets last night and about
300 demonstrators blocked traffic
on the main boulevard.
More than 50,000 people ral
lied in the western city of
Timisoara, site of the massacre
that spurred the revolution.
The center of Ploiesti, 38 miles
nesfck of Bucharest, was also
blocked by demonstrators late last
night.
But the focus of the rallies was
Brasov, where thousands of work
ers marched through the city cen

ter to commemorate the Nov. 15, «
1987 riot against Ceausescu.
Three years ago in Brasov, a
man set himself afire on a hilltop
to protest Ceausescu's rule. Work
ers and others later attacked and '
ransacked city hall. The dreaded
Securitate secret police sup
pressed the rallies.
Scores of people accused of
instigating the protests were
arrested, tortured and jailed.
At yesterday's rally, former dis- -
sident Doina Cornea, among the *
first to support the 1987 protests, *
joined crowds calling for Iliescu's *
resignation. J
"We do not need hypocritical, *
violent demagogues," Cornea told •
demonstrators. \
Sorin Rosea said the newly *
established Civic Alliance opposi- .
tion group would organize com- *
mittees nationwide to seek out
remaining Securitate agents and !
publish names.
"We are not dealing with the
Communist phantom, but with a !
neo-Communist reality," he told
the crowd.
Iliescu promised gradual
reforms and social protection
after he won a landslide victory in
May elections.
But many Romanians accuse
him and his National Salvation
Front government of allowing old- -
regime officials to remain in the
bureaucracy and of personally
harboring Communist tendencies.
Both president and govern
ment insist they have shed their
Communist past.
