BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) — Former President
Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua held talks with Saddam
Hussein on Third World revolutionary efforts to
resist U.S. influence, Baghdad television said yester
day.
The Iraqi leader said his seizure of Kuwait on
Aug. 2 was a victory for all Third World countries
because it was important to show that "arrogant
powers cannot violate small nations," the television
quoted him as saying. It did not elaborate.
Ortega, who headed Nicaragua's leftist Sandin
ista administration, said he flew to Baghdad on
Wednesday to express solidarity with Hussein and
the Iraqi people, according to the report.
It said the two men had a "profound discussion"
covering the problems of liberation movements in
Third World countries trying to combat U.S. hege
mony.
Saddam expressed his desire to settle the Persian
Gulf crisis through dialogue and in cor\junction with
other regional disputes, especially the Arab-Israeli
conflict. The United States and many other nations
opposing Iraq reject the linkage.
Ortega was quoted as telling Saddam that the
struggle for freedom and independence in Latin
America would continue.
The United States supported the Contra rebels
who fought Ortega's government in the 1980s.
Ortega was defeated in February elections by a U.S.-
backed coalition.
