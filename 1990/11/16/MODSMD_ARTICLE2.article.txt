# Weenie pranksters vandalize campus

Big Game-related pranks have begun, as
UC-Berkeley students attempted to cancel last
night's Bonfire Rally and vandalized various
sites on campus.
Vandalism typically occurs on both the
Stanford and UC-Berkeley campuses during
Big Game Week, which culminates Saturday
when the Cardinal football team meets the
Golden Bears in the 93rd annual Big Game.
Falsified fliers appeared late yesterday
afternoon all over campus announcing the

cancellation of the Bonfire. The letter pur
ported to come from the Office of the Presi
dent and listed behavior of the Stanford Band
among the reasons for the cancellation.
Members of the Axe Committee, which
sponsors the Bonfire, were somewhat
impressed by the prank.
"I give Cal credit," said senior Pat Broun.
"It was a great idea, but it was not well done."
Broun explained that the fliers contained
several obvious flaws, including spelling mis
takes, an unofficial format and the lack of Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy's signature.
"If you have ever read anything written by

Donald Kennedy, you would know that it was
not even close," he added.
Broun said it was a simple prank because at
Stanford, unlike UC-Berkeley, most students
live and eat on campus. This allows a rumor to
spread very quickly through fliers.
UC-Berkeley students also attempted to
post fliers around the Bonfire site around 3
p.m., according to sophomore Marc Booth, an
Axe Committee member. He said the esti
mated 75 to 100 UC-Berkeley students who
came to post the fliers were scared off by Axe
