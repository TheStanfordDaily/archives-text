# Weenie pranksters vandalize campus

### Howard Libit Staff writer 
Big Game-related pranks have begun, as
UC-Berkeley students attempted to cancel last
night's Bonfire Rally and vandalized various
sites on campus.
Vandalism typically occurs on both the
Stanford and UC-Berkeley campuses during
Big Game Week, which culminates Saturday
when the Cardinal football team meets the
Golden Bears in the 93rd annual Big Game.
Falsified fliers appeared late yesterday
afternoon all over campus announcing the

cancellation of the Bonfire. The letter pur
ported to come from the Office of the Presi
dent and listed behavior of the Stanford Band
among the reasons for the cancellation.
Members of the Axe Committee, which
sponsors the Bonfire, were somewhat
impressed by the prank.
"I give Cal credit," said senior Pat Broun.
"It was a great idea, but it was not well done."
Broun explained that the fliers contained
several obvious flaws, including spelling mis
takes, an unofficial format and the lack of Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy's signature.
"If you have ever read anything written by

Donald Kennedy, you would know that it was
not even close," he added.
Broun said it was a simple prank because at
Stanford, unlike UC-Berkeley, most students
live and eat on campus. This allows a rumor to
spread very quickly through fliers.
UC-Berkeley students also attempted to
post fliers around the Bonfire site around 3
p.m., according to sophomore Marc Booth, an
Axe Committee member. He said the esti
mated 75 to 100 UC-Berkeley students who
came to post the fliers were scared off by Axe
Committee members construct
ing the Bonfire.
In another incident early
Wednesday morning, police
apprehended three UC-Berkeley
students near the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center at
1:30 a.m. The CPPC was spray
painted using bear claw and "Cal"
stencils.
Although no one actually saw
the students spray-paint the
building, police found them with
spray paint and stencils, accord
ing to Stanford Police Chief Mar
vin Herrington.
In a separate Big Game-related
incident, police apprehended four
members of the UC-Berkeley
band who allegedly threw eggs at
cars in the parking lot of the Delta
Tau Delta fraternity house.
Members of the UC-Berkeley
band were playing the school's
fight song and shouting outside
the house early Wednesday morn
ing, according to a resident.

The UC-Berkeley band mem
bers' car was later spotted behind
the Band Shak, where they were
caught by police, Herrington said.
Police did not file charges in
either Wednesday morning inci
dent because no one actually wit
nessed the acts, Herrington said.
He refused to release names
until the Santa Clara County dis
trict attorney's office decides
whether to file misdemeanor van
dalism charges, punishable by
fines and community service, in
the CPPC incident.
Two vandalism incidents also
occurred Wednesday evening that
led to no arrests.
Vandals spray-painted the
front of the Stanford Stadium
ticket office and were chased
away by police.
At Columbae House, vandals
poured\blue grease on bike seats
and wrote "Go Cal" on the front
door with the grease, according to
one house resident who asked to
remain anonymous.
UC-Berkeley campus police
reported no meyor incidents of
vandalism associated with Big
Game yesterday afternoon.
