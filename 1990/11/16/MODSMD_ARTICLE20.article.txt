### 
New polity may
encourage more
responsible behavior

THE UNIVERSITY'S Con
trolled Substance and Alco
hol Policy makes a largely
successful compromise between
federal regulations for funding and
Stanford's belief that students
should be responsible for making
their own decisions and accepting
the consequences of those deci
sions.
In many ways, the policy adds
little to what was already in place.
Rather, it reiterates and clarifies
the policies and responsibilities of
the handling and use of alcohol and
drugs on campus.
While the actual change on
paper may seem negligible, the
effects may be far-reaching.
Specifically, the University's
listing the party hosts, sponsors
and bartenders as possibly liable
for the consequences of serving
alcohol to minors and intoxicated
persons, and its declaration that
the University will not act as a
sanctuary from the enforcement of
state and local laws are very impor
tant.
While these are not necessarily
new policies, it makes clear any
possible ambiguities. Hopefully,
the fact that students are ulti
mately held accountable for their
use of alcohol will foster a more
responsible attitude toward drink
ing.

In addition, the University's
preference for educational and
rehabilitative measures in
response to simple infractions is a
positive one. The University has
affirmed its praiseworthy stance
that one of its concerns is to edu
cate its community about the
responsible use of alcohol.
The further definition of the
role of resident assistants and resi
dent fellows is a positive one. By
removing the residence staff from
the role of enforcer, the University
has reemphasized Residential Edu
cation's commitment to commu
nity and guidance.
But by not restricting the use of
dorm or house funds from alcohol
purchases, the University has
made a half-hearted compromise.
In essence, it has condoned the use
of alcohol, but will not be responsi
ble for any consequences. This
responsibility will ultimately lie
with the organizers of any events
including alcohol.
Also, the section on Conse
quences of Violation is nebulous.
By reserving the right to punish by
removal from University housing,
expulsion from organizations,
refusal of University recognition of
an organization, suspension and
expulsion from the University,
Stanford has the potential to wield
an extremely powerful weapon.
The Consequences of Violation
section of the new policy would
allow the University to take a
hard-line policy against any group
or organization if so desired. The
potential for carrying out an anti-
Greek agenda is a possibility worth
noting.
