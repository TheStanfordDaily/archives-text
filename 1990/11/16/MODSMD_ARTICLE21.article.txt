Advocate of drug use ignored serious social side effects

STUART REGES' ARTICLES IN
The Daily last week contained a
number of assertions and implica
tions to which I would like to respond.
Reges wrote about all the positive
experiences he's had in more than 10
years of illegal drug use. The implication,
based only on his own experiences and
those of some fellow users, was that ille
gal drug use has no negative physical,
social or economic effects if done in his
manner.
Next, he claimed that illegal drug use
has never affected his judgment, at least
as far as his own self-evaluation has
determined.
Lastly, the overall assertion of his dia
tribe concerning drug use was that the
well-documented social and economic
scourge of illegal drug use is all some
government ruse to legitimize repression
of our rights.
I agree that Reges has the right to not
only carry illegal drugs but also to con
sume them as he sees fit, as long as his
use doesn't affect anyone else. Hey! It's
his life and his body, and no one has the
right to tell him what to do with it, as
long as his actions don't affect them.
However, his illegal drug use affects
us all by further subsidizing a business
that produces only death and destruction
for many people and blights the society
we live in as a whole.
First, the money with which he pur
chases his drugs almost definitely ends
up lining the pockets of people who
(unlike the dealers he refers to) have no
compunctions about selling drugs to chil
dren, the economically deprived, the eco
nomically well-off... anybody with the
money.
These people have a history of bru
tally eliminating their competition and
all too many innocent bystanders, many
times children unfortunate enough to be
caught in the "elimination of marginal
firms from the marketplace" sometimes
known as the crossfire.

Second, I'm glad Reges has enjoyed
the drugs he have used and been smart
enough and financially able to obtain
only (pure) "good stuff." Poor addicts in
the ghettos of America don't often have
that luxury.
The result is that many experience
these phantom, negative effects that
don't exist in Reges' world and far too
many of them die, be it from impurities,
overdose or the (nonexistent?) negative
toll of the drugs themselves.
Verification can be found in the emer
gency rooms and morgues of most any
inner city hospital and a number of sub
urban hospitals as well (obviously those
users didn't know Reges' system). More
collegiate examples can be found as near
as Diana Conklin (she was lucky enough
to live) or as far as Len Bias, the great
University of Maryland basketball star
(he didn't).
As for Reges' pious statement about
not being addicted, I wonder if he could
go a year without drugs. Yes!? I dare him
to try because the sad fact is that illegal
drugs are highly addictive — that is

where the profits lie.
Reges' illegal drug purchases help per
petuate the business of distributing
these toxins and the ill effects on our
society that result.
Third, in reference to Reges' "unaf
fected judgment," I can only make an
analogy to the alcohol-impaired person
who didn't realize their judgment was
affected until they caused or were
involved in an automobile accident that
resulted in fatalities, or accidentally shot
their hunting buddy/friend/family mem
ber/lover ... to name only a few exam
ples.
Lastly, a visit to any economically
troubled inner city should disabuse
Reges of the notion that the social and
economic scourge of the drug trade, par
ticularly for blacks, is in any way a part
of some governmental imagination.
Detroit, where I'm from, has many
very real crack houses, crack babies,
drug-pushing gangs, drug-related gang
wars, drug-induced and/or drug-related
injuries (the bullets aren't always fatal)
and murders and economically devas-

tated neighborhoods where illegal drug
use is rampant and the drug trade is one
of the only available vocations.
Life in these areas is unusually brutal
and often fatal, particularly for young
males, because of the drug trade and the
violence that comes with it. It is no acci
dent that the armed forces loan their
surgeons to inner city emergency rooms
to obtain battlefield training.
If Detroit or perhaps Los Angeles is
too far, East Palo Alto has a lot to offer
in this area and it's just down University
Avenue — very convenient. Witness the
extensive 9 mm exterior home remodel
ing job done last year for an East Palo
Alto anti-drug crusader courtesy of her
(no doubt highly moral) local drug deal
ers. As a reminder, Reges' drug dollars
help finance this type of philanthropy
The basic point is that illegal drug use
affects us all in the way it shapes our
society. Reges' sanctimonious defense of
illegal drug use is extraordinarily igno
rant of the facts, and the "grand" idea
that only he is affected by his use is sim
ply selfish.
His ideas about how Stanford should
solve the problems arising from the new
federal drug and alcohol policy are
worthless because he is a fully-paid sup
porter of the problem.

social or economic effects if done in his
manner.
Next, he claimed that illegal drug use
has never affected his judgment, at least
as far as his own self-evaluation has
determined.
Lastly, the overall assertion of his dia
tribe concerning drug use was that the
well-documented social and economic
scourge of illegal drug use is all some
government ruse to legitimize repression
of our rights.
I agree that Reges has the right to not
only carry illegal drugs but also to con
sume them as he sees fit, as long as his
use doesn't affect anyone else. Hey! It's
his life and his body, and no one has the
right to tell him what to do with it, as
long as his actions don't affect them.
However, his illegal drug use affects
us all by further subsidizing a business
that produces only death and destruction
for many people and blights the society
we live in as a whole.
First, the money with which he pur
chases his drugs almost definitely ends
up lining the pockets of people who
(unlike the dealers he refers to) have no
compunctions about selling drugs to chil
dren, the economically deprived, the eco
nomically well-off... anybody with the
money.
These people have a history of bru
tally eliminating their competition and
all too many innocent bystanders, many
times children unfortunate enough to be
caught in the "elimination of marginal
firms from the marketplace" sometimes
known as the crossfire.

Second, I'm glad Reges has enjoyed
the drugs he have used and been smart
enough and financially able to obtain
only (pure) "good stuff." Poor addicts in
the ghettos of America don't often have
that luxury.
The result is that many experience
these phantom, negative effects that
don't exist in Reges' world and far too
many of them die, be it from impurities,
overdose or the (nonexistent?) negative
toll of the drugs themselves.
Verification can be found in the emer
gency rooms and morgues of most any
inner city hospital and a number of sub
urban hospitals as well (obviously those
users didn't know Reges' system). More
collegiate examples can be found as near
as Diana Conklin (she was lucky enough
to live) or as far as Len Bias, the great
University of Maryland basketball star
(he didn't).
As for Reges' pious statement about
not being addicted, I wonder if he could
go a year without drugs. Yes!? I dare him
to try because the sad fact is that illegal
drugs are highly addictive — that is

where the profits lie.
Reges' illegal drug purchases help per
petuate the business of distributing
these toxins and the ill effects on our
society that result.
Third, in reference to Reges' "unaf
fected judgment," I can only make an
analogy to the alcohol-impaired person
who didn't realize their judgment was
affected until they caused or were
involved in an automobile accident that
resulted in fatalities, or accidentally shot
their hunting buddy/friend/family mem
ber/lover ... to name only a few exam
ples.
Lastly, a visit to any economically
troubled inner city should disabuse
Reges of the notion that the social and
economic scourge of the drug trade, par
ticularly for blacks, is in any way a part
of some governmental imagination.
Detroit, where I'm from, has many
very real crack houses, crack babies,
drug-pushing gangs, drug-related gang
wars, drug-induced and/or drug-related
injuries (the bullets aren't always fatal)
and murders and economically devas-

tated neighborhoods where illegal drug
use is rampant and the drug trade is one
of the only available vocations.
Life in these areas is unusually brutal
and often fatal, particularly for young
males, because of the drug trade and the
violence that comes with it. It is no acci
dent that the armed forces loan their
surgeons to inner city emergency rooms
to obtain battlefield training.
If Detroit or perhaps Los Angeles is
too far, East Palo Alto has a lot to offer
in this area and it's just down University
Avenue — very convenient. Witness the
extensive 9 mm exterior home remodel
ing job done last year for an East Palo
Alto anti-drug crusader courtesy of her
(no doubt highly moral) local drug deal
ers. As a reminder, Reges' drug dollars
help finance this type of philanthropy
The basic point is that illegal drug use
affects us all in the way it shapes our
society. Reges' sanctimonious defense of
illegal drug use is extraordinarily igno
rant of the facts, and the "grand" idea
that only he is affected by his use is sim
ply selfish.
His ideas about how Stanford should
solve the problems arising from the new
federal drug and alcohol policy are
worthless because he is a fully-paid sup
porter of the problem.

Advocate of drug use ignored serious social side effects

STUART REGES' ARTICLES IN
The Daily last week contained a
number of assertions and implica
tions to which I would like to respond.
Reges wrote about all the positive
experiences he's had in more than 10
years of illegal drug use. The implication,
based only on his own experiences and
those of some fellow users, was that ille
gal drug use has no negative physical,
social or economic effects if done in his
manner.
Next, he claimed that illegal drug use
has never affected his judgment, at least
as far as his own self-evaluation has
determined.
Lastly, the overall assertion of his dia
tribe concerning drug use was that the
well-documented social and economic
scourge of illegal drug use is all some
government ruse to legitimize repression
of our rights.
