Dear Bug,
Do our black squirrels on cam
pus interbreed, date or even
socialize with our gray squirrels'?
Please don't tell me we have segre
gated squirrels!
— David Schechter
Dear David,
I turned directly to the source
to answer your question. Unfortu
nately, both sets of squirrels were
too busy hoarding acorns for the
winter to respond.
If I am not mistaken or para
noid, several squirrels even gave
me nasty looks (created by purs
ing their upper lips above their
two front buck teeth) when I
approached them. I guess they
still haven't forgotten the time my
bike wheel grazed the neck of
their skittish squirrel friend.
According to Carol Boggs, asso
ciate professor of Human Biology,
the black and the gray squirrels
are the same species. Grays and
blacks alike are known as sciurus
carolens or, in lay terms, oopsus
ranitoverus.
Since they are the same
species, they take part in the same
social events, mating rituals, and
— don't start getting excited
because I'm not going to discuss
the process now— they even inter
breed!
Dear Bug,
Why isn't the crossword in The
Daily perforated for QUIET
removal during lectures ?

Dear Geoff Ballew,
We all know how much profes
sors hate students who do cross
word puzzles during lecture.
(ATTENTION PROFESSOR
READERS: That's G-e-o-f-f B-a-1-
1-e-w!)

Your question is on the mind of
many a frustrated crossword-solv
ing student, who has had to sur
reptitiously contort The Daily into
all sorts of strange and unnatural
foldings, while pretending to take
notes and flashing the professor
an occasional "I know exactly
what you mean" glance.
After all that energy exerted,
the student begins to wonder if it
would be better to just go to sleep,
which makes no noise and
requires only basic bodily contor
tions.
While acknowledging that per
forations would facilitate the
covert crossword solving process,
The Daily does not think it feasi
ble. According to Brad Hayward,
The Daily's editor in chief, it
would be too expensive.
Moreover, the advertisers on
the back of the puzzle would be
furious if they discovered strange
perforations ravaging their sacred
announcements.

Dear Bug,
Are refried beans really fried
twice? Do we also have to pay
twice for them ?
— Frugal Gourmet
Dear F.G.,
Yes, you do have to pay twice
for refried beans — once before
you eat them, once afterward.
I realize how unsavory this
sounds, but if you take the time to
closely examine refried beans,
you'll see that they are anything
but glamorous.
According to Karen Johnston
of Beatrice Foods, the manufac
turers of Rosarita refried beans,
beans are not fried at all. Talk
about the verbal irony in modern
day cuisine!
The beans are cooked once in
big black kettles, then cooked
again after they are canned as
part of the "sterilization process."
Then why aren't they called
recooked beans? I ask Kay. A
stumper! Happy to be rid of me,
she promotes my question up the
annoying-consumer ladder, to the
manager of corporate communica
tions.
The manager tells me that "the
Hispanics," who invented refried
beans, utilized the "two-fold" pro
cess of cooking, then frying the
beans. "But that would make
them not Refried Beans, but
Cooked-Fried Beans," I helpfully
inform her. . .
"Hello, are you there? Hello??
Hello????"

The BUG wants you! But don't be
too flattered. The BUG really just
wants your questions and com
ments.
