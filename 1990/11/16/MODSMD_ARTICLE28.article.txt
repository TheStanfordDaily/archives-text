The first meeting of the Stanford
branch of the Woodrow Wilson League of
College Men was announced. "All men
interested in the Woodrow Wilson presi
dential boom" were invited to come. It
was hoped that branches all across the
country would start up, thereby providing
Wilson with a strong base of support.
Rather sexist, don't you say? But don't
forget, women couldn't vote back then.
Perhaps females could get revenge by
organizing a club today endorsing the
presidential aspirations of Laura Palmer.
1 mean, after Reagan and Bush, a true
stiff would be the next logical candidate.
And of course, Bob would be VP.

The Band announced today that it
would not perform at Big Game. The
strike was a result of a recommendation
by the Women's Conference that they
"perform in the future without [their]
majorette," high schooler Maxine Turner
because she was "unrepresentative and a
disgrace to Stanford." The Women's Con
ference issued an apology the next day,

and Turner was allowed to continue in
her msyorette capacity.
At least the Women's Conference
didn't try to suspend the majorette for a
game. Can you imagine the uproar then ?
There would have been anti- "Muffle the
Majorette" rallies and even a sleepout in
the Quad. Luckily, though, Turner was
able to twirl her baton at Big Game, lead
ings Stanford faithful to yell out, "Give
'em the Max, Max, Max."

Dr. John Gagnon of the Kinsey Insti
tute gave a talk on homosexuality last
night. He claimed that three to six per
cent of males and one to three percent of
females "confined their sexual activity
only to members of the same sex." Also,
"though some authorities have asserted
that homosexuality is a genetic tendency,
Dr. Gagnon feels it is learned in early

childhood rather than inherited."
Here is yet another example of the
growing split between rich and poor.
Obviously, the wealthy, who go to better
schools and have better teachers, will
have more opportunity to learn how to be
gay or lesbian than will their poorer
counterparts. There will have to be deseg
regation of heterosexual children into
homosexual schools in order to achieve
the proper balance, or else sex riots will
sweep the inner city.

Daniel Ellsberg, most famous for his
release of the Pentagon Papers to the
New York Times, spoke at Stanford about
nuclear military strategies. He said the
Pentagon considered two strategies for
protecting its B-52 bombers from Russian
missiles before rejecting both.
The first involved a "mile-wide high

way across the country". The B-52s
would just "taxi back and forth across the
country," and the Russians would never
know where exactly they were.
The other idea was to "put 10,000
first-stage Atlas engines in banks in Mon
tana." When the Russians attacked,
"we'd set off all these engines simultane
ously and stop the earth's rotation
briefly. . . . The missiles would, of course,
overshoot their targets, and they would
hit Cleveland and Boston."
And people wonder how we lost Viet
nam? Although I can't argue with the
expendability of Cleveland, or even
Boston, as long as "Cheers" was moved
out in time. Of course, the plan of stop
ping the earth'B rotation would fail, as
anybody who saw "Superman" knows.
Everything would merely go in reverse
until the earth started rotating properly
again, and the missiles would still hit
their primary targets.
