## 'Easy Ed' stands tall on the gridiron and the court 
### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
The television set glowed. It was the game
Ed McCaffrey should have been playing.
Instead, he was watching his little brother.
Billy McCaffrey was doing what Ed was
born to do. Dribble a ball. Control the hard
wood. At 6-5 Vi, 205 and possessor of a 38-inch
vertical jump, the elder McCaffrey looks like
he should be the one starting for Duke, follow
ing in the father's footsteps. But he's left the
family game to Billy and sister Monica, a for
ward for Georgetown.
Ed McCaffrey's world is one of hash marks
and shoulder pads.
But no one in the McCaffrey clan is com
plaining.
"Big Ed' 3" disertion has taken him to the
top. And is leading straight to the NFL.
The Cardinal senior is one of the best wide
receivers in the country, one of the best to ever
play on the football-rich Farm.
Giving up basketball for fooball is looking
more and more like the decision of his lifetime.
"Ed's one of the big money men on the
team, and he's the best receiver in the nation.
He makes things happen for the offense and
obviously he's a big deep threat, a possession
threat and just a great all-around football
player," said quarterback Jason Palumbis.
He might look perfect inside the paint, but
McCaffrey's combination of size and deceptive
speed — the lumbering-looking player actually
runs a 4.4-second 40 — has tossed him to the
top of collegiate football. The senior is snag
ging a piece of NCAA and Stanford history,
and is helping rebuild a winning (competitive)
program.
He can line up in almost any receiving posi
tion — wide-out, flanker, tight-end, and comes
down with almost everything tossed in his
direction. He makes bad passes look great. He
makes impossible catches look like routine.
He is redefining the position of collegiate
wide receiver.
"I can just throw the ball up high or any
where, and he goes up and gets it," Palumbis
said. "His speed, his jumping ability, his
height, everything — he's a great athlete, and
I can't say enough good things about him.
"You get the ball around to him, he's going
to come down with it. He's made my job a hell
of a lot easier."
His height gives McCaffrey a huge advan
tage in single coverage sitautions. If a team is
dumb enough to put only one defender on the

electric player, the defensive back is going to be
left grasping at air and wondering where
McCaffrey went.
But even if he is bracketed, McCaffrey has a
knack for finding his way to the ball and wrap
ping his big hands around it.
"You can't take McCaffrey on one-on-one.
When you try, more times than not he's going
to beat you. It's just my job to get the ball up
to him." Palumbis said. "He'a a big money
man and if you try to play man-on-man on Ed
he's gone."
"There are a number of recievers as fast as
Ed and a few as big but no one as fast and as
big," added receivers coach Brian Billick.
"We're in an era when corners are getting
smaller and smaller so they can run with
receivers, and when you put a 6-6 guy out, this
creates a huge advantage."
A preseason All-America pick, the quiet but
competitive receiver is carrying out the
prophecy. After playing in only eight of Stan
ford's first 10 games due to minor injuries —
he missed Colorado and sat out the second
halves of Washington and Arizona — he is
leading the Pacific 10 Conference with 59
receptions and 889 yards. Both are fifth-best
in the nation.
He had 176 yards and four touchdowns —
one of which he actually ran in on a reverse
while defenders were mauling fullback Tommy
Vardell — against Washington State, one of
the best single-game performances in Stanford
history. His 144 receptions are fourth in the
Cardinal record book, and his 2,305 career
yards are third.
The numbers make an impact, but McCaf
frey's mere presense lifts the Cardinal.
His performance is inspriring, his dedica
tion an incentive. The double-teaming just
gets another receiver open, or paves the way
for the backfield.
"It helps to have somebody that good be a
part of your game," said receiver Jon Pinkney.
"A great individual raises the play of your
whole group.
"It's also an advantage on the field to have
somebody like Ed playing on the other side. He
draws a lot of attention and helps the entire
offense because [the opponent] has to have
respect for your passing game, and you have to
deal with him. If I get double-teamed then he's
going to come through, and if he gets double
teamed we have to come through. If all the
receivers are doubled than we're going to be
able to run."

Football at California
TOMORROW - TV: PSN, Radio: KZSU with
Brian Webber and Mark McLaughlin in their
finale(9o.l FM), KCBS (740 AM). 3:30 p.m.
kickoff at Memorial Stadium.
RECORDS — Stanford (4-6, 3-4 in Pac-10 play),
Cal (6-3-1, 4-2-1 in the Pac-10).
MATCHUP — It's going to be a good one, folks.
Even if it weren't the Big Game it would be
an exciting contest. The two teams match up
pretty well, and both are on the upswing. The
fact that it is should only lead to more action
on the field. Cal is hot on the ground, with
Russell White and Anthony Wallace combing
to form the hottest backfield tandem the
Golden Bears have ever sported. Quarterback
Mike Pawlawskl isn't too bad either. But Stan
ford, with the relentless tandem of Ron
George and Dave Garnett, has been pretty
consistent at halting the run this season, and
its offense isn't too shabby either. It'll be Glyn
Mllburn reverse, long to Ed McCaffrey and
Tommy Vardell over the top.
Of course the fact that it is Big Game also
makes matchups irrelevant. What ever hap
pens, happens, and it's not necessarily the
best team that wins. It's wacky, it's weird, and
it's worth the trip across the Bay.
Beat the Weenies!

Glyn Milburn, McCaffrey is pacing the Cardi
nal offense. His total yards are second only to
Palumbis. His eight touchdowns are also good
for a No. 2 spot.
When it's third-and-long, when Stanford is
digging out of a deficit, the team looks to
McCaffrey.
And usually isn't disappointed.
"What he gives us is a guy we can go to in
clutch time and key situations, third down sit
uations, and also a guy that we can use to con
trol the defense. He brings us that balance
that we're looking for," said coach Denny
Green.
"When you're leading the league in passing
a lot of people are getting the ball, and Ed has
59 receptions and has really only played in
eight games. That's quite amazing," Green
said.
The humble player isn't fazed, however.
Fans, peers, friends can say whatever they
like. They can tell him he's God's gift to foot
ball, or that he stunk up the field (though the
reason why can't be found).
His vision remains the same.


Damlan Marhefka — Daily
Wide receiver Ed McCaffrey will be signing a lot of autographs for
some time to come. That's because sometime next year the senior
will also be signing a contract to play in the NFL He is currently
ranked the No. 5 receiver In the country, after having been No. 1
most of the season and then missing some playing time due to
injuries. When he finally leaves the Farm, he will be remembered as
one of Stanford's all-time great receivers.
"My goal has always been the
same. To play my part, to give 100
percent and to control the things I
can control," McCaffrey said.
"Such as catching everything
that's thrown to me, and not hav
ing any mental breakdowns."
His concentration is such that
he won't even talk about the
draft, the favorite subject of most
senior collegiate gridiron stars.
He will, however, be drafted.
And go high. Make no mistake,
lack of verbosity does not equal
lack of potential in this case.
Quite the opposite.

Scouts are drooling.
Agents are scheming.
Quarterbacks are getting
excited.
"Ed is definitely going to be a
very high draft choice. He com
pares with some of the great
ones," Green said. "I was here (as
an assistant) when we had James
Lofton, when we had Kenny
Margerum and when we had
Andre Tyler. Those are guys who
were outstanding players who
were first and second and fourth
round draft picks. He's definitely
on par with any of those guys,
who've had great careers."
Look out Neon Deion. Your
next challange is about to arrive.
"With his size, speed, excellent
work habits and his intelligence,

'He compares with
some of the great
ones.'

his future is limitless. Fate will
take a hand but he has the poten
tial to do great things at the next
level. He has all the tangibles and
intangibles," Billick said.
He may look better on a bas
ketball court, but Ed McCaffrey
seems to have adapted quite well
to the football terrain.
Sorry, Dad.
