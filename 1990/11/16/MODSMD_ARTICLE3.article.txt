# ASSU Senate opposes Gulf offensive
## 
### David Bianco Editorial staff 
The ASSU Senate opposes "an unprovoked non-
U.N.-Bponsored military offensive in the Middle
East," according to a bill passed at last night's senate
meeting.
The bill, originally formulated to "oppose war" in
the Persian Gulf, was in response to Wednesday's
anti-war rally and sleep-out in White Plaza, which
organizers said attracted more than 800 partici
pants.
Opposition to the bill was largely from senators
who thought it was not the senate's role to take a
stand on such a complex, national issue. "[Middle
East policy] is a complex issue and not something
that we as a student government should be deciding
for the entire student body," said sophomore Beth
Morgan, a senator.
But some senators said there were good reasons
for the ASSU to take a stand on the question of war
in the Middle East. Naomi Onaga, an undergraduate
senator, pointed out that "students are not exempted
from the draft. I think that this is a very important
student issue."
Council of Presidents member Ingrid Nava, a
senior, said she believes "most students on the cam
pus ... do not want offensive action."
Senator Noel Maurer, a junior, agreed. "I'm not in
favor of war in the Middle East," he said. "I don't
think you can find a single Stanford student who is."
Maurer, who said he has a friend currently serv
ing in the Marines in the Persian Gulf, said the war
issue is emotional for him.
But graduate senator John Overdeck objected to
such a short bill covering such a complex issue. "If I

had to express my points of view on the Persian Gulf
crisis, they would take more than two sentences," he
said.
The original bill, which was a sweeping condem
nation of war in the Persian Gulf, was reformulated
by a series of friendly amendments that left open the
option of military action by the United Nations in
case of Iraqi provocation. The amended bill passed
by an 11-6-3 vote.
After the bill passed, senator Alison Alter, a
sophomore, requested a straw poll including non
voting senators, senate associates and the Council of
Presidents to determine the entire body's stance on
the bill. The straw poll showed the larger group
opposed the bill by a vote of 15-16-5.
Earlier in the meeting, the senate discussed
another kind of poll — last week's student poll coor
dinated by ASSU dorm representatives.
Several senators complained of bias in the poll's
questions, but sophomore A.R. Jones, the survey's
coordinator, denied any bias within the poll.
Senator Bill Candelaria, a sophomore, said he
thought telephone polls were the best way to gauge
student opinion.
In other business, the senate approved a leave of
absence for senator Vivian Vice, who said she
planned to spend winter quarter working on
women's issues.
Two undergraduate senators objected to the
request because her leave of absence is tantamount
to relinquishing her voting rights as an undergradu
ate senator.
Also, two dorm representatives from Stern Hall
announced their intention to start an ASSU newslet
ter to be distributed campuswide.
