# An index to Big Game and stuff
## 
### 
I had so much fun reading
the Harper's Index-type
guide to Big Game in In
termission yesterday that I
tried to piece together a few
relevant numbers of my own
on the sports scene these days:
2 — The rank of Stanford
University in the latest U.S.
News and World Imperialism
estimation of America's learn
ing institutions.

24 — The rank of the Uni
versity of California at
Berkeley in the same poll.
4 — The points by which Cal
is favored over Stanford tomor
row. Is there a correlation be
tween the U.S. News thing and
the point spread? Yes, you sub
tract the better school's
ranking from that of the dum
ber school, then subtract two
more to correct for the margin
of error in the poll, then divide
the result by five, which is ex
actly the same as the combined
point total of a field goal and
a safety. I've finally cracked the
Vegas system.
13,075 — Stanford's enroll
ment.
31,000 — Cal's enrollent.
Shouldn't we have to score only
half as many points aa them?
140.1 — Jason Palumbis'
passing-efficiency rating, which
also happens to rank ninth in
the nation at last count. His
rating is the highest in the Pac
-10, by the way, and that means,
by the transitive property,
higher than USC's "wonder
boy," Todd Marinovich.
59 — The number of passes
that Ed McCaffrey has caught
this season, which ranks fifth
in the nation, No.l in the Pac
-10. McCaffrey's numbers this
year, along with his great size,
leaping ability and toughness
and decent speed should get
him a job in the NFL (q.v.).
Draft expert and Pro Foot
ball Weekly writer Joel
Buschbaum projects McCaffrey
to be selected in anywhere from
the second to fifth round in

the 1991 draft. McCaffrey's
little brother Billy just scored
19 points for the Duke basket
ball team the other night, in
cidentally. I guess some things
are in the genes.
The Palumbis-to-McCaffrey
connection doesn't have the
same ring to it as say
"Montana-to-Rice," but it could
be just enough to thrust Stan
ford over the top of California
when they meet in Berkeley to
morrow. (Subliminal message:
Wear a black armband.)
155 — The number of all
purpose yards that Glyn Mil
burn needs tomorrow against
Cal to break Darrin Nelson's
school record of 1,998 yards
rushing, receiving and return
ing. Milburn averages 184.3 all
purpose yards per game, second
in the nation.
169.0 — The passing rating
of Virginia quarterback Shawn
Moore, the man who should
win the Heisman Trophy. How
ever fallable the passing rating
is as a statistic, it does serve
as some indicator of perform
ance, and Moore's rating sur
passes Brigham Young's Ty
Detmer, Miami's Craig Erick
son, and Houston's David
Klingler, all-senior quarterback
Heisman hopefulls.
Detmer has put up great
numbers, and in fact he ranks
second to Moore in quarterback
rating points, but it's a distant
second. Erickson ranks fifth,
and Klingler isn't even on the
chart.
As for Notre Dame's Raghib
Ismail, he is probably the high
est rated professional prospect
at any position in the college
ranks right now. He has rare
speed and even rarer broken
field running ability.
But the Heisman is given to
the best performance by a col
lege player each year, and al
though Ismail has had some
spectacular and high-profile
touchdowns on national televi
sion, his overall statistics do
not justify his selection.
For that matter, San Jose
State's Sheldon Canley has
more all-purpose yards than Is
mail, as does Milburn,
Colorado's Eric Bieniemy and
Washington's Greg Lewis.
