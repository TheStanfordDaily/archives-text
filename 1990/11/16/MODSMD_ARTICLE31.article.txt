# Spikers obliterate Beavers in three
## 
### Harold Yu Staff writer 
With important persons like
Don Kennedy in attendance at
last night's volleyball match, you
knew you could expect a show.
And as Kennedy certainly may
have hoped, Stanford did most of
the showing.
At Burnham Pavilion yesterday
evening, the Cardinal swept away
conference rival Oregon State in
brutal fashion, 15-6, 15-8, 15-7.
Stanford exploited inept OSU ball
handling to seal its ninth consecu
tive victory. The team has only
two remaining regular season
matches this year.
Oregon State devastated its
staunch ball control reputation
early. The Cardinal struck for six
unanswered points as the Beavers
made a series of misplays in game
one. OSU fumbled away points
three and four before setter Jill
Sogge threw up an unhittable set
to squander point five. The
Beavers found themselves down
6-0 as they called timeout.
"I don't think we played very
well," OSU coach Guy Enriques
said. "We didn't control the ball
like we normally do."
The Beavers, who entered the
contest with more total blocks
than Stanford this year, had that
statistic thrown back in their face.
Kristin Klein, Bev Oden and
player-of-the-game Jessica Ben
ton combined for a triple block at
7-1.
The Cardinal front line tow
ered over the Beavers all night.
Stanford recorded 10 team blocks
and redirected the OSU offense
completely. "We just didn't give
them a chance to get going," Stan-

TONIGHT - 7:30 p.m. at
Burnham Pavilion. The match
will be televised live on the Prime
Ticket network.
RECORDS - Stanford (23-3, 15-2
and 2nd in Pac-10 flay), ranked
No. 3 in the nation. Oregon (15-
12, 6-10 and 7th in the Pac-10).
NOTES — Tonight's match is
Stanford's second to last of the
season. The team has not lost
since dropping a heart-breaker
to UCLA on October 19. The
Cardinal has surged with the hit
ting of Jessica Benton and Amy
Cooper. As teams focus on
Kristin Klein and Bev Oden,
Benton and Cooper have been
afforded a greater role in the
offense. Oregon still has slim
chances at an NCAA tournament
birth but has lost seven of its
last eight matches. Their best
attacker is middle blocker Min
dee Adams.

Cardinal 3
Beavers 0

ford coach Don Shaw said.
Two Klein kills pushed the Car
dinal ahead 11-3, and then Amy
Cooper and setter Carrie Feldman
stuffed another OSU attack.
Cooper and Feldman each had two
blocks on the night.
"I think we played pretty well,"
Feldman said. "We had been wor
ried about them all week long.
They really made us nervous."
These fears were somewhat
justified at the beginning of the
second game. OSU managed to
resume the scrappy, never-say-die
play that has earned them 22 wins
this season. The Beavers led 2-0
and 5-2 while the Cardinal
relented. Stanford neutralized
each of its side outs, committing
three service errors in a row at
one stage.
But the Cardinal just went to
the rising star of the offense to set
things straight. Down 4-5, Feld
man fed Benton who converted
one of her match-high 13 kills.
The senior middle blocker then
served two aces and had two kills
to spark a Stanford revival. Ben
ton finished with a match-high
seven digs and a .364 hitting per
centage.
"Jess has been playing really
well," Klein said. "She's hitting a
lot harder but some teams don't
pay attention to her."
OSU had to refocus its atten
tion a lot, with poor results. From
down on her knees, Feldman
made an acrobatic set to Jennifer
Jackson who made the score 10-7.
The Cardinal finished a 13-3 run
to seize game two in comeback
fashion.
"We just got careless with our
serving early," Shaw said. "But we
were doing a good job with our
blocking and our defense."
This trend persisted into the
third game as well. The Beavers
again posed a mini-threat, leading
5-3 at the start. But Benton con
tinued to convert, slamming three
more kills.
Oden made a solo block to halt
the OSU run. She had seven
blocks overall, more than twice
OSU's total to lead the defensive
surge.
And then the drama began.
Jackson slipped and fell on the
floor with Stanford down 5-6. She
sustained no injury but took a few
minutes to get up.
The crowd completely hushed
two points later when OSU setter
Sogge collided with a teammate
and fell to the court. She took

some time to rise but continued to
play. One point later, Cooper made
sure she still felt the daze, striking
a hard kill in her face while she
attempted to dig.
Sogge was fine but her offense
wasn't. The Beavers stalled at
point seven as the Cardinal raced
away. Sophomore Kristi Paaso
entered the match and served five
consecutive points. Stanford
scored nine times in a row to ter
minate the contest.
Cooper provided much of the
entertainment throughout the
evening, as she tenaciously
pounded a number of sets. The
Aurora, 111. middle blocker had 12
kills and a .476 hitting percent
age.
Feldman managed to keep OSU
honest with three dump kills and

a .600 hitting percentage. She and
Klein each had six digs to anchor
the Cardinal defense.
"We executed our game plan
well," Klein said. "OSU is a really
scrappy team, and they can give
us some problems. We knew what
to expect. But we're improving
day by day. They didn't play as
tough as last time (in Corvallis
earlier this season)."
The Cardinal has become
methodical in its disposal of oppo
nents. Stanford has now won sev
enteen of its last 18 matches. The
team is currently on pace for its
third-best season in school his
tory. The team will play confer
ence opponent Oregon tonight
and then tussle with No. 10 San
Jose State in the season finale
Tuesday.

Sogge was fine but her offense
wasn't. The Beavers stalled at
point seven as the Cardinal raced
away. Sophomore Kristi Paaso
entered the match and served five
consecutive points. Stanford
scored nine times in a row to ter
minate the contest.
Cooper provided much of the
entertainment throughout the
evening, as she tenaciously
pounded a number of sets. The
Aurora, 111. middle blocker had 12
kills and a .476 hitting percent
age.
Feldman managed to keep OSU
honest with three dump kills and

a .600 hitting percentage. She and
Klein each had six digs to anchor
the Cardinal defense.
"We executed our game plan
well," Klein said. "OSU is a really
scrappy team, and they can give
us some problems. We knew what
to expect. But we're improving
day by day. They didn't play as
tough as last time (in Corvallis
earlier this season)."
The Cardinal has become
methodical in its disposal of oppo
nents. Stanford has now won sev
enteen of its last 18 matches. The
team is currently on pace for its
third-best season in school his
tory. The team will play confer
ence opponent Oregon tonight
and then tussle with No. 10 San
Jose State in the season finale
Tuesday.

All-Amerlcan outside hitter Kristin Klein had six digs In last night's
dismantling of the Oregon State Beavers. She and her mates hope
to continue their streaking ways tonight against the Oregon Ducks.
With important persons like
Don Kennedy in attendance at
last night's volleyball match, you
knew you could expect a show.
And as Kennedy certainly may
have hoped, Stanford did most of
the showing.
At Burnham Pavilion yesterday
evening, the Cardinal swept away
conference rival Oregon State in
brutal fashion, 15-6, 15-8, 15-7.
Stanford exploited inept OSU ball
handling to seal its ninth consecu
tive victory. The team has only
two remaining regular season
matches this year.
Oregon State devastated its
staunch ball control reputation
early. The Cardinal struck for six
unanswered points as the Beavers
made a series of misplays in game
one. OSU fumbled away points
three and four before setter Jill
Sogge threw up an unhittable set
to squander point five. The
Beavers found themselves down
6-0 as they called timeout.
"I don't think we played very
well," OSU coach Guy Enriques
said. "We didn't control the ball
like we normally do."
The Beavers, who entered the
contest with more total blocks
than Stanford this year, had that
statistic thrown back in their face.
Kristin Klein, Bev Oden and
player-of-the-game Jessica Ben
ton combined for a triple block at
7-1.

TONIGHT - 7:30 p.m. at
Burnham Pavilion. The match
will be televised live on the Prime
Ticket network.
RECORDS - Stanford (23-3, 15-2
and 2nd in Pac-10 flay), ranked
No. 3 in the nation. Oregon (15-
12, 6-10 and 7th in the Pac-10).
NOTES — Tonight's match is
Stanford's second to last of the
season. The team has not lost
since dropping a heart-breaker
to UCLA on October 19. The
Cardinal has surged with the hit
ting of Jessica Benton and Amy
Cooper. As teams focus on
Kristin Klein and Bev Oden,
Benton and Cooper have been
afforded a greater role in the
offense. Oregon still has slim
chances at an NCAA tournament
birth but has lost seven of its
last eight matches. Their best
attacker is middle blocker Min
dee Adams.

ford coach Don Shaw said.
Two Klein kills pushed the Car
dinal ahead 11-3, and then Amy
Cooper and setter Carrie Feldman
stuffed another OSU attack.
Cooper and Feldman each had two
blocks on the night.
"I think we played pretty well,"
Feldman said. "We had been wor
ried about them all week long.
They really made us nervous."
These fears were somewhat
justified at the beginning of the
second game. OSU managed to
resume the scrappy, never-say-die
play that has earned them 22 wins
this season. The Beavers led 2-0
and 5-2 while the Cardinal
relented. Stanford neutralized
each of its side outs, committing
three service errors in a row at
one stage.
But the Cardinal just went to
the rising star of the offense to set
things straight. Down 4-5, Feld
man fed Benton who converted
one of her match-high 13 kills.
The senior middle blocker then
served two aces and had two kills
to spark a Stanford revival. Ben
ton finished with a match-high
seven digs and a .364 hitting per
centage.
"Jess has been playing really
well," Klein said. "She's hitting a
lot harder but some teams don't
pay attention to her."
OSU had to refocus its atten
tion a lot, with poor results. From
down on her knees, Feldman
made an acrobatic set to Jennifer
Jackson who made the score 10-7.
The Cardinal finished a 13-3 run
to seize game two in comeback
fashion.
"We just got careless with our
serving early," Shaw said. "But we
were doing a good job with our
blocking and our defense."
This trend persisted into the
third game as well. The Beavers
again posed a mini-threat, leading
5-3 at the start. But Benton con
tinued to convert, slamming three
more kills.
Oden made a solo block to halt
the OSU run. She had seven
blocks overall, more than twice
OSU's total to lead the defensive
surge.
And then the drama began.
Jackson slipped and fell on the
floor with Stanford down 5-6. She
sustained no injury but took a few
minutes to get up.
The crowd completely hushed
two points later when OSU setter
Sogge collided with a teammate
and fell to the court. She took

some time to rise but continued to
play. One point later, Cooper made
sure she still felt the daze, striking
a hard kill in her face while she
attempted to dig.
Sogge was fine but her offense
