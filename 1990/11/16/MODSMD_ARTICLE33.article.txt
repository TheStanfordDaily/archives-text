## 
### Brandi Shipp 
Yesterday both the men's and women's swimming
teams competed against the Golden Bears of Califor
nia. The women traveled to Spieker pool while the
men swam in deGuerre down on the Farm.
The men's meet, which was not scored, was actu
ally a double-distance meet, in which the lengths of
all of the regular events were doubled. At their first
home meet of the year, they gave it their all and per
formed splendidly
"The meet went really well. Stanford had a lot of
good swims," Erik Maurer said. "If it had been
scored, I think that we definitely would,have won."
Today's meet, although exibition only, was not
lacking in excitement and action. Jason Plummer,
Alex Kostich and freshman sensation Derek
Weatherford each set new meet records, a promising
achievement for such an early meet.
At poolside, the fans and swimmers helped to
keep the excitement flowing. "The team had a lot of
support and enthusiasm at the pool. Everyone was
pretty excited to see each other swim," Maurer said.
The next challenge for the Stanford men's team is
the U.S. Open, held in Indianapolis, Ind. from Nov.
30 to Dec. 2. There, the majority of the men will be
competing in an open meet, with a few other colle
giate teams, as well as several post-graduate stu
dents and the U.S. National Team.
Due to today's outstanding performance, how
ever, the team seems to be very optimistic about the
upcoming season, which officially begins in January.
"The team has the potential to do amazing things in
the pool," Maurer said. "This could be best team that
we have had since the team that won the NCAA
championship last in 1987."

'This could be best team that
we have had since the team
that won the NCAA champi
onship last in 1987.'

While the Stanford men's team was hosting the
California men at deGuerre Pool, the Cardinal's
women's team was a few miles to the north, deuling
it out against California's women's team. Their meet
was a double-distance exibition, as well. It provided
an excellent opportunity for the No. 2 Cardinal
women to get a grasp of their progress thus far this
year.
According to Stanford's top freshman recruit,
Summer Sanders, the meet went very smoothly.
"Individually, everyone swam pretty well today,"
Sanders said.
Coach Richard Quick pointed out that basically
everyone swam excellent!, and was unhappy with
only the relays. The women have been working long
and hard for the upcoming season, with the hopes of
taking the NCAA title away from the Lady
Longhorns of Texas, last season's champs.
"We have been practicing non-stop and we are all
a little broken-down now. But we are working really
hard for the season," Sanders said.
According to Sanders, the team looks promising
for the next season. "The team looks real good.
Texas looks really stong, but when we taper, we will
be right there with them," she commented. "It will
be hard, but we are on our way."
