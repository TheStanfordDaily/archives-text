# Big Splash will be gigantic
## 
### Aden Fine Staff writer 
The NCAA tournament will
start one week from today, but the
Stanford water polo team is
hardly thinking about that right
now.
The Cardinal has the annual
Big Splash game against Califor
nia on its mind right now.
As senior Colin Keely said,
"The Big Splash is a really big deal
and is always an exciting game.
All the games I've played in have
been ones to remember, and this
one should be no different."
And what makes this year's
contest even more exciting is that
Cal is ranked No. 1 in the country,
and Stanford is No. 2. You
couldn't ask for a better game,
and Saturday at 12:30 p.m. the
crowds will settle in to Califor
nia's Spieker Pool for the much
awaited match-up.
. The two teams have already
met three times this year, but
Stanford would be happy if none
of those games even counted. You
see, the Cardinal, who are 23-5 on
the year, have been handed three
of those losses by the Golden
Bears. California has won the
games by scores of 12-11,11-7 and
11-7.
Nevertheless, coach Dante Det
tamanti is still confident about his
team's chances of upsetting the
tup team in the country. "I really
feel confident that we're going to
win this game. The three losses
don't really mean anything, and
besides, we haven't even played
that well in those games."
In addition, after playing
extremely well last weekend on its
trip down to USC and UCLA, the
Cardinal appears ready for the
challenge.
"I think we're peaking at just
the right time," said Dettamanti.
"Everyone's playing well, and
we're not making any mistakes
like we did earlier in the year. We
really dominated UCLA last week
end — a team that killed us in the
beginning of the year — so this
shows how good we are playing
right now."
Stanford will need to be playing
its very best to overcome the
Bears. California has held on to
the No. 1 ranking all year long and
has suffered only one blemish on

their record, an 11-10 mid-season
loss to Pepperdine.
California is led by its standout
All-American, Chris Humbert.
Humbert, who led the U.S.
National Team in scoring at this
summer's Goodwill Games, ter
rorized the Cardinal in the game
at deGuerre Pool, scoring five
times to lead his team to victory.

Water Polo »». UOP, Cal
THIS WEEKEND - The UOP game
will begin today at 3 p.m. at
deGuerre pool. The Big Splash
against California will begin to
morrow at 12:30 p.m. at Spieker
Pool.
RECORDS — Stanford (4-1 and
second in Pac-10 play), ranked
No. 2. California (5-0 and first
in Pac-10), ranked No. 1 in the
nation.

However, the Bears are not just
a one man team. "They have a lot
of guys who can hurt you," Detta
manti said. "We can't afford to
concentrate only on Humbert,
because then the other guys will
kill us. Their team plays every
phase of the game well, so we'll
have to be totally sharp and not
make any mistakes."
Mistakes may indeed be what
determines the outcome between
these very closely talented teams.
As Dettamanti said, "It's going to
be a tight game for sure, and it
will probably come down to which
team makes the critical mistake
and which team can capitalize on
the mistake."
Something else that has
plagued Stanford in its three
losses to the Bears has been the
disappearance of the highly
potent Cardinal offense.
Throughout the season, Stanford
has been scoring at least 10 goals
in almost every game, but in the
last two meetings with its archri
val, the team has been able to only
score seven goals.
Against a team with as much
talent as the Bears, Dettamanti
knows that his team needs to
score more. "Our problem in the
losses [to California] has been
that we haven't scored enough.
Our defense has been fairly good,
but we just haven't been able to be
effective on offense."

If the offense is to come alive,
don't be surprised if it is the four
Stanford seniors who will be lead
ing the way. After all, the seniors
are the team's top four scorers.
Rick McNair, a nominee for the
NCAA's "Top-Six" award, had an
impressive weekend against USC
and UCLA last weekend, scoring
six times, to give him 49 goals for
the year. Behind McNair in team
scoring is Greg Olson, who has
rebounded from a bit of a scoring
slump and now has 43 goals.
Keely and Chuck Maguy round
out the senior class, respectively
having tallied 39 and 38 goals
apiece.
After having played in three
Big Splashes, Keely knows how
exciting and tense this game is
likely to get. "There's going to be
a big crowd there, and everybody's
going to be pretty emotional, so
it'll definitely be a great game. We
both have really good teams, and
each of us really wants to win this
game, so it'll be a battle out
there."
Before the team gets to go to
battle against the giant, however,
the Cardinal will first face the
University of Pacific in a non
league game today at 3:00 p.m. at
deGuerre Pool. It is Stanford's
last home game of the year. The
Cardinal have already beaten the
Tigers once this year, by a score of
11-7.
Although Pacific doesn't figure
to give Stanford too tough a con
test, Keely feels this game will
help his team get ready for the Big
Splash. "Cal will be a very emo
tional game, and we'll be pretty
pumped up for it, so this game will
give us a chance to calm down a
bit and get ourselves completely
mentally ready for Cal."
A win over the Bears on Satur
day would be a huge boost to the
Cardinal's confidence going into
next week's NCAAs, and depend
ing on the results of the protest
over last weekend's UCLA game,
it could also give Stanford a share
of the Pacific 10 Conference
championship.
Despite all the pressure of the
game, Dettamanti is confident in
his team. "If we can keep the
game close, I think we have a
great shot at winning it."
The Stanford players and fans
can only hope their coach is right.

NCAA's "Top-Six" award, had an
impressive weekend against USC
and UCLA last weekend, scoring
six times, to give him 49 goals for
the year. Behind McNair in team
scoring is Greg Olson, who has
rebounded from a bit of a scoring
slump and now has 43 goals.
Keely and Chuck Maguy round
out the senior class, respectively
having tallied 39 and 38 goals
apiece.
After having played in three
Big Splashes, Keely knows how
exciting and tense this game is
likely to get. "There's going to be
a big crowd there, and everybody's
going to be pretty emotional, so
it'll definitely be a great game. We
both have really good teams, and
each of us really wants to win this
game, so it'll be a battle out
there."
Before the team gets to go to
battle against the giant, however,
the Cardinal will first face the
University of Pacific in a non
league game today at 3:00 p.m. at
deGuerre Pool. It is Stanford's
last home game of the year. The
Cardinal have already beaten the
Tigers once this year, by a score of
11-7.
Although Pacific doesn't figure
to give Stanford too tough a con
test, Keely feels this game will
help his team get ready for the Big
Splash. "Cal will be a very emo
tional game, and we'll be pretty
pumped up for it, so this game will
give us a chance to calm down a
bit and get ourselves completely
mentally ready for Cal."
A win over the Bears on Satur
day would be a huge boost to the
Cardinal's confidence going into
next week's NCAAs, and depend
ing on the results of the protest
over last weekend's UCLA game,
it could also give Stanford a share
of the Pacific 10 Conference
championship.
Despite all the pressure of the
game, Dettamanti is confident in
his team. "If we can keep the
game close, I think we have a
great shot at winning it."
The Stanford players and fans
can only hope their coach is right.
The NCAA tournament will
start one week from today, but the
Stanford water polo team is
hardly thinking about that right
now.
The Cardinal has the annual
Big Splash game against Califor
nia on its mind right now.
As senior Colin Keely said,
"The Big Splash is a really big deal
and is always an exciting game.
All the games I've played in have
been ones to remember, and this
one should be no different."
And what makes this year's
contest even more exciting is that
Cal is ranked No. 1 in the country,
and Stanford is No. 2. You
couldn't ask for a better game,
and Saturday at 12:30 p.m. the
crowds will settle in to Califor
nia's Spieker Pool for the much
awaited match-up.
. The two teams have already
met three times this year, but
Stanford would be happy if none
of those games even counted. You
see, the Cardinal, who are 23-5 on
the year, have been handed three
of those losses by the Golden
Bears. California has won the
games by scores of 12-11,11-7 and
11-7.
Nevertheless, coach Dante Det
tamanti is still confident about his
team's chances of upsetting the
tup team in the country. "I really
feel confident that we're going to
win this game. The three losses
don't really mean anything, and
besides, we haven't even played
that well in those games."
In addition, after playing
extremely well last weekend on its
trip down to USC and UCLA, the
Cardinal appears ready for the
challenge.
"I think we're peaking at just
the right time," said Dettamanti.
"Everyone's playing well, and
we're not making any mistakes
like we did earlier in the year. We
really dominated UCLA last week
end — a team that killed us in the
beginning of the year — so this
shows how good we are playing
right now."
Stanford will need to be playing
its very best to overcome the
Bears. California has held on to
the No. 1 ranking all year long and
has suffered only one blemish on

their record, an 11-10 mid-season
loss to Pepperdine.
California is led by its standout
All-American, Chris Humbert.
Humbert, who led the U.S.
National Team in scoring at this
summer's Goodwill Games, ter
rorized the Cardinal in the game
at deGuerre Pool, scoring five
times to lead his team to victory.

Water Polo »». UOP, Cal
THIS WEEKEND - The UOP game
will begin today at 3 p.m. at
deGuerre pool. The Big Splash
against California will begin to
morrow at 12:30 p.m. at Spieker
Pool.
RECORDS — Stanford (4-1 and
second in Pac-10 play), ranked
No. 2. California (5-0 and first
in Pac-10), ranked No. 1 in the
nation.

However, the Bears are not just
a one man team. "They have a lot
of guys who can hurt you," Detta
manti said. "We can't afford to
concentrate only on Humbert,
because then the other guys will
kill us. Their team plays every
phase of the game well, so we'll
have to be totally sharp and not
make any mistakes."
Mistakes may indeed be what
determines the outcome between
these very closely talented teams.
As Dettamanti said, "It's going to
be a tight game for sure, and it
will probably come down to which
team makes the critical mistake
and which team can capitalize on
the mistake."
Something else that has
plagued Stanford in its three
losses to the Bears has been the
disappearance of the highly
potent Cardinal offense.
Throughout the season, Stanford
has been scoring at least 10 goals
in almost every game, but in the
last two meetings with its archri
val, the team has been able to only
score seven goals.
Against a team with as much
talent as the Bears, Dettamanti
knows that his team needs to
score more. "Our problem in the
losses [to California] has been
that we haven't scored enough.
Our defense has been fairly good,
but we just haven't been able to be
effective on offense."

If the offense is to come alive,
don't be surprised if it is the four
Stanford seniors who will be lead
ing the way. After all, the seniors
are the team's top four scorers.
