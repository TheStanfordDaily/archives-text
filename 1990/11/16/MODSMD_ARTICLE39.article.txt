## 
### Jennifer Paley Staff writer 
Former U.S. Attorney General Edwin
Meese and Ira Glasser, executive director of
the American Civil Liberties Union, squared
off over drug legalization yesterday at a
Hoover Institution conference on U.S. drug
policy.
Glasser argued that advocates of drug pro
hibition must reconsider current drug policy,
while Meese, an honorary fellow at Hoover,
responded in a prepared statement that "pro
posals for the legalization of narcotics should
be soundly rejected."
Glasser said present drug laws "protect
[criminal drug] cartels against competition,
against taxation, against regulation and
against quality control."
Meese, on the other hand, said that if drugs
were legalized, a black market would still exist
and cater to minors, and lower prices on the
open market would increase demand.
The two speakers also disagreed on whether

Meese said illegality of drugs
serves as a deterrent, but
Glasser countered that drug
prohibition leads to an
increase in drug-related
crime.

legalization proponents or opponents need to
provide proof of why a policy of legalization
would or would not work.
Meese held that since "the burden of proof
is on the proponents of change in drug policy,
it is incumbent upon them to provide the
answers to several critical questions," such as
the proposed method of sale, price, taxes and
benefits to society.
Glasser responded to this argument in a
question-and-answer session after the debate.
"There is a double standard concerning evi
dence and the burden of proof," he said.

He argued that current drug policy was not
"a product of careful discussion and study." He
drew a parallel between Meese's support of the
present policy and a physician's insistence on
administering a patient medicine "that is
killing [him] and refusing to try something
else."
Meese defended current policy by asserting
that "the illegality of drugs is a mtyor factor in
deterring people who fear the law."
Glasser said drug prohibition has contribut
ed to an increase in drug-related violence and
the number of criminals in the United States
and said fewer crimes would be committed if
drugs were more accessible.
The debate was followed by brief speeches
given by James Jacobs, a professor of law at
New York University, and Joseph McNamara,
San Jose police chief.
The conference concludes today with dis
cussions on the medical and economic implica
tions of U.S. drug policy and a keynote address
by Milton Friedman, a senior research fellow
at the Hoover Institution.
