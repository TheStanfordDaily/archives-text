# Anti-war students plan six-day fast
## 
### Miranda Doyle Staff writer 
At least 14 students will fast
together for six days next week to
oppose U.S. military intervention
in the Middle East. The group
formed spontaneously at the anti
war rally and sleep-out in White
Plaza Wednesday night.
"We are all opposed to the
United States starting a war in
the Middle East and interested in
making a personal sacrifice,'' said
junior Marty Smith, one of the
protesters.
After hearing activist Fred
Moore speak at Wednesday's rally
about his experiences fasting for
peace, the students decided to
begin fasting immediately.
Each student will go without
food for a day or two and then
trade off to other students until
Nov. 20, when the entire group
will begin a six-day fast.
"Hopefully, people will join us

as it picks up momentum," said
freshman Matthew Mizel. "No
one is required to go the whole
week. A lot of people, like me,
have not fasted before."
Mizel said he is "a little scared"
about the fast, but is "strongly
opposed to war and human beings
killing other human beings."
"My goal right now is to draw
attention to my feelings," he said.
Mizel said he consulted a doc
tor yesterday about how fasting
will affect him physically.
Smith said he is also concerned
about physical effects, but the
group is doing research on how to
deal with any problems.
"I think we are all going to be
pretty cautious about it,"he said.
"What is important is that we can
draw as much attention to the
issue as possible."
