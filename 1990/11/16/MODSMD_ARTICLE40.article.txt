# SIDO fast benefits grassroots development

Many Stanford students gave up their
meal cards yesterday to participate in a fast
that will benefit grass-roots development pro
grams at home and abroad.
"Fast '90" is the sixth in a series of annual
fasts sponsored by the Stanford International
Development Organization. "The response [in
the past] has been really good," said coordina
tor Corona Freitag, a senior. Last year, the fast
raised between $3,000 and $4,000. "[But] it
was restricted to the dorms and didn't reach
out much to coops or to self-ops," added junior
Radha Rangarajan, also a coordinator.
The organization extended participation

this year to independent dining halls outside
of University Food Service. Some of the
houses gave up "luxury" foods like cookies and
crackers while others simply cooked vegetar
ian meals to cut meat costs.
The houses and University Food Service
will donate the money saved by producing
fewer meals.
Money collected from the fast is channeled
to grass-roots development projects on various
parts of the globe. Examples of beneficiaries
from last year include a youth program in
Ahmedabad, India, a community garden and
orchard project in Zimbabwe and the Ecu
menical Hunger Program in East Palo Alto.
"One-third of the funding goes to local U.S.

projects and two-thirds goes overseas," Fre
itag said.
Describing the project selection process,
said the group is constrained by a
relatively small budget. "Since we have to split
money between projects, we prefer smaller
projects with smaller budgets," she said.
Other criteria include the degree of commu
nity support, the number of people impacted
and the involvement of women.
"Interest and awareness of Third World
issues [among Stanford students] is at a low,"
observed Rangarajan. "The fast and events
around the fast generate discussion of such
issues," she said.
