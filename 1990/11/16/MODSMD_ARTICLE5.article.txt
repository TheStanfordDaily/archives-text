# Band faces flung fruit

Over the years, the Stanford
Band has weathered many Big
Games at Memorial Stadium in
Berkeley. "The Play" of the 1982
Big Game saw the trouncing of
several Band members as the UC-
Berkeley team scored in the final
seconds. More recently, Band
members have been the target of
timid epithets and more painful
frozen oranges, hurled at them by
California fans.
This year will be different,
however, according to Benjamin
Meyers, public relations manager
for the Band. As the incomparable
Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity Marching Band enters the
stadium tomorrow in Berkeley, it
will be prepared to do battle, not
only defending against the Berke
ley onslaught but also restoring
its honor after a one-game sus
pension.
Exactly what the Band is plan
ning remains top secret. Its pro
gram, which will include a pre
game and a half-time show, "will
definitely be satirical, playing on
recent events," Meyers said.
Although he declined to state
what these "recent events" might
be, Meyers hinted at the Band's
performance two weeks ago in
Oregon, which led to its suspen
sion.
Meyers said there would be one
Cal-directed "dig" at the end of
half-time. "The weenies are not
going to escape unscathed," he

promised.
Meyers said the Band would
not tread lightly after coming off
its suspension. "We'll stick to the
kind of band we are, lampooning
and spoofing," he said. "We will
concentrate on the show's appeal
by using our usual formula of top
ical humor," Meyers said.
He also cited the numerous let
ters of support received from stu
dents and alumni after being
banned following the Oregon
game two weeks ago. Tomorrow's
show has already been approved
by the Department of Athletics.
The Athletics Department
appears to be the least of the
Band's worries, however, when
juxtaposed with the dozens of
frozen oranges "funnelated" at
them by the Cal fans. Funnelation
is the method of launching heavy
objects hundreds of feet with a
contraption consisting of strands
of surgical tubing attached to a
plastic funnel.
"Cal hasn't learned more civi
lized ways to hurt us," said one
band member, referring to the hail
of hard citrus the band receives
every other year when it travels to
Berkeley. In the past, the Band
has taken precautions to fend
against the onslaught, wearing
hardhats and using golf clubs to
chip the fruit back into the Cal
stands.
"The essence of Big Game is
the hundreds of pounds of poten
tial pulpy mixture that the Cal
fans throw at us every year. If we
could only get them to throw bot
tles of Smirnoff," suggested
another band member.
And though the rivalry
remains intense, relations
between the UC-Berkeley march
ing band and the Band are not as
violent as with the California
fans. While Stanford fans sing
their own version to California's
fight song, "The Dirty Golden
Bear," the Band sings another
"more scatological version," said
Meyers. "[The Band version]
deals with parts of the Bear's
anatomy and basically insults his
manhood as a bear."
When asked what the essence
of Big Game is for the Band, one
bass drummer replied profoundly,
"Visceral vitriol and the rhythmic
glory of combat. This is the unde
niable essence."

For the record

An article in Wednesday's Daily
about the hunger banquet spon
sored by the Stanford Internation
al Development Organization mis
stated the purpose of the event,
which was to dramatize the global
inequities in food distribution.
