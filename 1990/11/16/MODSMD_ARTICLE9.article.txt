# Anniversary vigil honors slain Salvadoran Jesuits
## 
### Denise M. Morris Staff writer 
Students and faculty gathered last night
to honor the memory of six Jesuit priests
and two women who were killed by govern
ment troops at a university in El Salvador
one year ago today.
More than 100 people attended the com
memoration at the School of Education and
a candlelight vigil held afterward in White
Plaza.
Speakers included Cristina Avila and
Oscar Chicas, native Salvadorans who
spoke with the aid of a translator, and Stan
ford Political Science Assoc. Prof. Terry
Karl.

The program focused on the possibilities
for hope in El Salvador, specifically, a new
cooperative dedicated to the priests' mis
sion.
The cooperative, Segundo Montes City,
was founded in memory of one of the mar
tyred priests killed by Salvadoran soldiers
Nov. 16, 1989. Its population of 8,400 is
dedicated to standing against injustice and
protesting the violation of human rights,
thus becoming the model that Montes envi
sioned, according to Avila.
The social organization of the city
includes a 40-member representative
assembly, a legislative body of six and an
executive committee of five, all elected by
the community.

However, Segundo Montes has yet to
reach full development. The Salvadoran
army frequently blocks access to food and
supplies, claiming the town shelters leftist
guerrillas.
It is not unusual for members of the
community to be randomly taken as prison
ers, Avila said.
Chicas joined Avila in the sentiment that
moral, political and economic support from
outside El Salvador are necessary to estab
lish internal peace. They invited American
groups to send delegates to observe first
hand both the city's progress and the
repression it still faces.
The 1989 murder of the priests and their
staff members was a political event, accord

ing to Karl. The elite military battalion that
killed them was trained by U.S. forces, and
the weapons and ammunition were pur
chased with U.S. funds, she said.
Although 50 percent of U.S. funding to
El Salvador has been cut, "we have to
achieve 100 percent reduction of aid," Avila
said.
"That aid is guns, and those guns are
pointed at us," Karl quoted martyred Jesuit
lgnacio Martin-Baro as saying.
The event was sponsored by the Stan
ford Central America Action Network,
Memorial Church, the Center for Latin
American Studies and other religiously
affiliated groups.
