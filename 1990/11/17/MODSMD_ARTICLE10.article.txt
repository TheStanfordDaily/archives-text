# Pawlawski turns Bear offense into Copper
## 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
At the beginning of fall prac
tice, California's football team
read like an incomplete sentence
ending with two question marks.
California cellar-dweller, inex
perienced cream-puff. Wait until
next year, 2-9 ,lose the Axe again.
Perry Klein? Mike Pawlawski?
But as the bowl-bound Golden
Bears ponder their surprising 6-3-
1 record, the second question
mark junior quarterback Mike
Pawlawski has transformed
into an exclamation point, and all
of a sudden the apparent incoher
ence of the California squad now
reads like a too-good-to-be-true
fairy tale.
Pawlawski has been the

favorite rags-to-riches writer for
the Bears in 1990, emerging from
second-string obscurity to engi
neer a season-opening win over
Wisconsin, find guiding Cal to its
first winning season since 1982.
A 6-foot-3, 205-pound junior
from Yorba Linda, Calif., Paw
lawski rode the pine behind Troy
Taylor for two years and battled
Perry Klein for the starting role
before this season began but now
leads a potently balanced offen
sive attack.
"It's great to play and it is nice
to be part of a winning program,"
said Pawlawski, one of 12 starters
who will return for fin improving
Cal team in 1991. -
"I think our whole offense is
tougher," added Pawlawski, who
haa thrown 16 touchdown passes

and is No. 10 in Cal's all-time sin
gle-season offensive rankings.
"We're not going to back down
from anybody. And it's a team
feeling. That's best of all."
The sports magazines that
unanimously picked Cal as the
doormat of the Pacific 10 Confer
ence have moved on to other sub
jects, leaving Pawlawski and the
Bears to answer the preseason
criticism.
"I have nothing to say to
them," said Pawlawski. "There's
no need to, I'll let the results
speak for themselves. Those guys
didn't watch us practice, they just
based their predictions on last
year's record."
Pawlawski and the Bears have
written several exciting chapters
in their dream season already,

with a win over UCLA and a tie of
USC, but Pawlawski knows the
Bears need to win Big Game for a
satisfying conclusion to the regu
lar season.
"You hate to lose Big Game,"
he said, admitting that the Cal
coaching staff has been watching
a tape of Cal's 1982 final-Play win
over Stanford. "I wouldn't say it
would wreck our season, but you
can tell the fans are a lot more
excited about this one."
Pawlawski will be facing a
Stanford defense that has
improved during its current two
game win streak, but has been
exploited by the big pass play all
yearlong.
"I expect a good team. They
look talented and they play a pres
sure defense. Sometimes they give

up big plays, but sometimes they
make big plays for themselves,"
he said.
"It's a man-to-man defense,
and we have Brian Treggs. I've
said all season long that there
aren't too many guys who can
cover him for an entire game,"
continued Pawlawski, who has hit
Treggs 42 times for a team-lead
ing 541 reception yards.
Cal truly has a balanced offen
sive attack, gaining 197 yards per
game on the ground and 196
through the air. But Pawlawski
hasn't been shy about opening up
the air assault. The Bears scored a
flea-flicker touchdown in a 28-3
pasting of Oregon last weekend
and are a threat for more decep
tion against the Cardinal.
"That (the flea-flicker) was a
great play. Coach Mariucci (the
offensive coordinator) is open to
players and other coaches sug
gesting plays, and he's willing to
put them into the offense," said
Pawlawski, who joined Troy Tay
lor in designing another pitch
throwback-pass play that is in
Cal's offensive arsenal.
Pawlawski, who played on Cal's
kickoff coverage team for part of
last season, has earned a reputa
tion as a Jim McMahon-type field
leader, but he plays down the com
parison, citing media hype.
"As long as it works, I don't
really care," he said. "Let's just
say I'm not that big on running
out of bounds."
With Pawlawski still running
at linebackers instead of away
from them, the Bears will not be
finished until December when Cal
goes Copper-Bowling. And only
then will Pawlawski be able to sit
back and finally read the exciting
story he has helped write.

Pawlawski and the Bears have
written several exciting chapters
in their dream season already,

with a win over UCLA and a tie of
USC, but Pawlawski knows the
Bears need to win Big Game for a
satisfying conclusion to the regu
lar season.
"You hate to lose Big Game,"
he said, admitting that the Cal
coaching staff has been watching
a tape of Cal's 1982 final-Play win
over Stanford. "I wouldn't say it
would wreck our season, but you
can tell the fans are a lot more
excited about this one."
Pawlawski will be facing a
Stanford defense that has
improved during its current two
game win streak, but has been
exploited by the big pass play all
yearlong.
"I expect a good team. They
look talented and they play a pres
sure defense. Sometimes they give

up big plays, but sometimes they
make big plays for themselves,"
he said.
"It's a man-to-man defense,
and we have Brian Treggs. I've
said all season long that there
aren't too many guys who can
cover him for an entire game,"
continued Pawlawski, who has hit
Treggs 42 times for a team-lead
ing 541 reception yards.
Cal truly has a balanced offen
sive attack, gaining 197 yards per
game on the ground and 196
through the air. But Pawlawski
hasn't been shy about opening up
the air assault. The Bears scored a
flea-flicker touchdown in a 28-3
pasting of Oregon last weekend
and are a threat for more decep
tion against the Cardinal.
"That (the flea-flicker) was a
great play. Coach Mariucci (the
offensive coordinator) is open to
players and other coaches sug
gesting plays, and he's willing to
put them into the offense," said
Pawlawski, who joined Troy Tay
lor in designing another pitch
throwback-pass play that is in
Cal's offensive arsenal.
Pawlawski, who played on Cal's
kickoff coverage team for part of
last season, has earned a reputa
tion as a Jim McMahon-type field
leader, but he plays down the com
parison, citing media hype.
"As long as it works, I don't
really care," he said. "Let's just
say I'm not that big on running
out of bounds."
With Pawlawski still running
at linebackers instead of away
from them, the Bears will not be
finished until December when Cal
goes Copper-Bowling. And only
then will Pawlawski be able to sit
back and finally read the exciting
story he has helped write.
At the beginning of fall prac
tice, California's football team
read like an incomplete sentence
ending with two question marks.
California cellar-dweller, inex
perienced cream-puff. Wait until
next year, 2-9 ,lose the Axe again.
Perry Klein? Mike Pawlawski?
But as the bowl-bound Golden
Bears ponder their surprising 6-3-
1 record, the second question
mark junior quarterback Mike
Pawlawski has transformed
into an exclamation point, and all
of a sudden the apparent incoher
ence of the California squad now
reads like a too-good-to-be-true
fairy tale.
Pawlawski has been the

favorite rags-to-riches writer for
the Bears in 1990, emerging from
second-string obscurity to engi
neer a season-opening win over
Wisconsin, find guiding Cal to its
first winning season since 1982.
A 6-foot-3, 205-pound junior
from Yorba Linda, Calif., Paw
lawski rode the pine behind Troy
Taylor for two years and battled
Perry Klein for the starting role
before this season began but now
leads a potently balanced offen
sive attack.
"It's great to play and it is nice
to be part of a winning program,"
said Pawlawski, one of 12 starters
who will return for fin improving
Cal team in 1991. -
"I think our whole offense is
tougher," added Pawlawski, who
haa thrown 16 touchdown passes

and is No. 10 in Cal's all-time sin
gle-season offensive rankings.
"We're not going to back down
from anybody. And it's a team
feeling. That's best of all."
The sports magazines that
unanimously picked Cal as the
doormat of the Pacific 10 Confer
ence have moved on to other sub
jects, leaving Pawlawski and the
Bears to answer the preseason
criticism.
"I have nothing to say to
them," said Pawlawski. "There's
no need to, I'll let the results
speak for themselves. Those guys
didn't watch us practice, they just
based their predictions on last
year's record."
