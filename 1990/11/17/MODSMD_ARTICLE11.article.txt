# Wallace's performance cannot be overlooked
## 
### Peter Blum Staff writer 
The world has myopia when it
comes to Anthony Wallace.
Throughout his football career,
the senior California tailback has
not been the focus of hype, glitz or
glamour.
Until now.
Rushing for 903 yards in Cal's
10 first games, Wallace has
already banged his way to fourth
place on Cal's all-time single sea
son rushing list with two games
remaining.
Not too bad for a player who
was constantly overlooked and
underrated until this season.
As a junior at Pasadena High
School, Wallace played fullback in
the I-Formation. But the next
year before he could really take
advantage of the I his team
switched to the wishbone in which
no one single player received all of
the attention. So despite gaining
nearly 1,700 yards his senior year,
he was only recruited by a handful
of small schools.
"Not a lot of major schools
were looking at me," said Wallace.
"[USC's] Ricky Ervins and I
played in the same conference and
we had about equally good years. I
guess that he just knew the right
people."
With the goal of playing foot
ball for a big-time collegiate
power, Wallace opted to hone his
skills at Pasadena City College.
Yet even after two years of junior
college ball, colleges were not
exactly beckoning at his doorstep.
In addition to Cal, only lowa
State, San Diego State and Long
Beach State were interested in
him. And even Cal was primarily

only interested in his kickoff
return ability (he ran back nine
kickoffs for touchdowns his sec
ond year).
At Cal last year, he was thrown
together with five other players to
challenge for an open tailback
spot. But Wallace took his
anonymity in stride and ulti
mately started most of the Bears'
games in the backfield.
"It was not a big jump for me
[from junior college ball to NCAA
ball]," Wallace said. "The guys are
stronger and faster here, but I got
hit .much harder in junior col
lege."
Despite being used mostly as a
blocking back for quarterback
Troy Taylor last year, Wallace still
managed to pound his way to 560
rushing yards.
Nonetheless, he was looked
upon as being the temporary fill
in for phenom Russell White.
White sat out last season because
of the Proposition 48 bylaw which
sets minimum academic stan
dards for entering collegiate ath
letes.
Throughout the spring and
summer, everyone seemed to for
get about Wallace the returning
senior starter and focused their
attention on White, who had set
the California high school record
with 5,998 rushing yards and 94
touchdowns during his three
years at Crespi High School in Van
Nuys.
Thus, it was another day in the
life of Anthony Wallace.
"He [White] just got more
hype," said Wallace. "In away it
bothered me, but I've been
through it all competing with guys
who everyone pumped up."
As a result of the challenge that

White posed, last summer Wallace
worked out harder than he ever
had before.
"Russell made me a better per
son by making me work and focus
harder," Wallace said.
And on opening day, the under
rated veteran not the hailed
redshirt who had yet to carry the
ball lined up behind quarter
back Mike Pawlawski in the back
field.
Still, doubts persisted that it
was only a matter of time before
White would step in and take the
reigns away from Wallace.
But that has not been the case.
Neither has predominated over
the other in the backfield. The two
have split time in the I and
Bomber's formation (an extra
receiver lined up in place of the
tight end).
Wallace and White, dubbed the
"W-W Attack," are in reach of
becoming the first Pacific 10 Con
ference tandem of teammates to
rush for 1,000 yards each in a sea
son. In addition to Wallace's 903
yards, White has added another
823 yards.
And what does the future have
in store for Wallace?
He plans on entering next
year's draft but admits that he is
scared about where he will fit in.
"I just hope I go in the first 10
rounds," said Wallace. "I'm not
looking for a first-round pick.
With a chance, I'll make anyone a
satisfied customer."
At the moment, the 5-foot-11,
195-pound Wallace is relishing the
attention and success surround
ing him. For he knows that he has
never had a problem with being
overrated.

attention on White, who had set
the California high school record
with 5,998 rushing yards and 94
touchdowns during his three
years at Crespi High School in Van
Nuys.
Thus, it was another day in the
life of Anthony Wallace.
"He [White] just got more
hype," said Wallace. "In away it
bothered me, but I've been
through it all competing with guys
who everyone pumped up."
As a result of the challenge that

White posed, last summer Wallace
worked out harder than he ever
had before.
"Russell made me a better per
son by making me work and focus
harder," Wallace said.
And on opening day, the under
rated veteran not the hailed
redshirt who had yet to carry the
ball lined up behind quarter
back Mike Pawlawski in the back
field.
Still, doubts persisted that it
was only a matter of time before
White would step in and take the
reigns away from Wallace.
But that has not been the case.
Neither has predominated over
the other in the backfield. The two
have split time in the I and
Bomber's formation (an extra
receiver lined up in place of the
tight end).
Wallace and White, dubbed the
"W-W Attack," are in reach of
becoming the first Pacific 10 Con
ference tandem of teammates to
rush for 1,000 yards each in a sea
son. In addition to Wallace's 903
yards, White has added another
823 yards.
And what does the future have
in store for Wallace?
He plans on entering next
year's draft but admits that he is
scared about where he will fit in.
"I just hope I go in the first 10
rounds," said Wallace. "I'm not
looking for a first-round pick.
With a chance, I'll make anyone a
satisfied customer."
At the moment, the 5-foot-11,
195-pound Wallace is relishing the
attention and success surround
ing him. For he knows that he has
never had a problem with being
overrated.

Running back Anthony Wallace Is Cal's leading rusher with 903
yards, but he still has had to battle for recognition over more highly
touted teammate Russell White.
The world has myopia when it
comes to Anthony Wallace.
Throughout his football career,
the senior California tailback has
not been the focus of hype, glitz or
glamour.
Until now.
Rushing for 903 yards in Cal's
10 first games, Wallace has
already banged his way to fourth
place on Cal's all-time single sea
son rushing list with two games
remaining.
Not too bad for a player who
was constantly overlooked and
underrated until this season.
As a junior at Pasadena High
School, Wallace played fullback in
the I-Formation. But the next
year before he could really take
advantage of the I his team
switched to the wishbone in which
no one single player received all of
the attention. So despite gaining
nearly 1,700 yards his senior year,
he was only recruited by a handful
of small schools.
"Not a lot of major schools
were looking at me," said Wallace.
"[USC's] Ricky Ervins and I
played in the same conference and
we had about equally good years. I
guess that he just knew the right
people."
With the goal of playing foot
ball for a big-time collegiate
power, Wallace opted to hone his
skills at Pasadena City College.
Yet even after two years of junior
college ball, colleges were not
exactly beckoning at his doorstep.
In addition to Cal, only lowa
State, San Diego State and Long
Beach State were interested in
him. And even Cal was primarily

only interested in his kickoff
return ability (he ran back nine
kickoffs for touchdowns his sec
ond year).
At Cal last year, he was thrown
together with five other players to
challenge for an open tailback
spot. But Wallace took his
anonymity in stride and ulti
mately started most of the Bears'
games in the backfield.
"It was not a big jump for me
[from junior college ball to NCAA
ball]," Wallace said. "The guys are
stronger and faster here, but I got
hit .much harder in junior col
lege."
Despite being used mostly as a
blocking back for quarterback
Troy Taylor last year, Wallace still
managed to pound his way to 560
rushing yards.
Nonetheless, he was looked
upon as being the temporary fill
in for phenom Russell White.
White sat out last season because
of the Proposition 48 bylaw which
sets minimum academic stan
dards for entering collegiate ath
letes.
Throughout the spring and
summer, everyone seemed to for
get about Wallace the returning
senior starter and focused their
attention on White, who had set
the California high school record
with 5,998 rushing yards and 94
touchdowns during his three
years at Crespi High School in Van
Nuys.
