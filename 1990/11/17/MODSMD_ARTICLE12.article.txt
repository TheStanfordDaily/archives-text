### Michelle Ghert Staff writer 
For the 12 graduating Cardinal
football players, Saturday's
matchup is more than just the Big
Game. It is the Last Game.
As these seniors engage in their
last week of official practice at
Stanford, they reflect on their col
lege careers while contemplating
the future. But mostly they are
focusing on the task at hand: to
beat Cal and end their Stanford
careers with a victory to remem
ber.
"You don't remember many
games 15 to 20 years from now,"
cornerback Kevin Scott said. "But
I'm sure I'll remember this one."
Defensive tackle Scott Palm

"This is my last game ever in
the cardinal and white," Palm
bush said. "A win means bragging
rights for the rest of my life."
For the Cardinal seniors, Big
Game 1990 may be the last game
of their Stanford careers, but it is
also the final confrontation with
the 'archrival.' The intense
rivalry of the Big Game tradition
will be a strong driving force
behind these players as they set
out to keep the Axe in Stanford

territory.
"It means a lot to win for the
students," right guard Chuck
Gillingham said. "We're playing
for ourselves but at the same time
we are playing for a greater pur
pose."
With seemingly all Northern
Californian eyes on Big Game, the
Stanford football players soak up
the rivalry and convert it into
emotion.
"The emotion and the intensity
are definitely one of a kind,"
Gillingham said. "It seems like
everyone is getting involved."
Wide receiver Ed McCaffrey
sees his last Big Game as one that
is "separate from the entire sea
son.
"The game takes on a meaning
of its own," McCaffrey said. "Both
teams come out and play hard
nose football. Anything can hap
pen.
The Cardinal seniors intend to
make it happen this year by end
ing their Stanford careers with a
three-game winning streak and a
win against Copper Bowl-bound
California.
