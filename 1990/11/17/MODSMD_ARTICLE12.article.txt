# Seniors prepare for emotional final game
## 
### Michelle Ghert Staff writer 
For the 12 graduating Cardinal
football players, Saturday's
matchup is more than just the Big
Game. It is the Last Game.
As these seniors engage in their
last week of official practice at
Stanford, they reflect on their col
lege careers while contemplating
the future. But mostly they are
focusing on the task at hand: to
beat Cal and end their Stanford
careers with a victory to remem
ber.
"You don't remember many
games 15 to 20 years from now,"
cornerback Kevin Scott said. "But
I'm sure I'll remember this one."
Defensive tackle Scott Palm
bush agrees.
"This is my last game ever in
the cardinal and white," Palm
bush said. "A win means bragging
rights for the rest of my life."
For the Cardinal seniors, Big
Game 1990 may be the last game
of their Stanford careers, but it is
also the final confrontation with
the 'archrival.' The intense
rivalry of the Big Game tradition
will be a strong driving force
behind these players as they set
out to keep the Axe in Stanford

territory.
"It means a lot to win for the
students," right guard Chuck
Gillingham said. "We're playing
for ourselves but at the same time
we are playing for a greater pur
pose."
With seemingly all Northern
Californian eyes on Big Game, the
Stanford football players soak up
the rivalry and convert it into
emotion.
"The emotion and the intensity
are definitely one of a kind,"
Gillingham said. "It seems like
everyone is getting involved."
Wide receiver Ed McCaffrey
sees his last Big Game as one that
is "separate from the entire sea
son.
"The game takes on a meaning
of its own," McCaffrey said. "Both
teams come out and play hard
nose football. Anything can hap
pen.
The Cardinal seniors intend to
make it happen this year by end
ing their Stanford careers with a
three-game winning streak and a
win against Copper Bowl-bound
California.
"If Stanford wins this year, we

years. This Big Game marks the last time Gillingham and a group of 11 other graduating seniors get the
chance to bring football glory back to the Farm.
graduate without losing once to
Cal," placekicker John Hopkins
said. "We want to win this year
and finish on a positive note."
"We're finally playing the way
we want," offensive tackle Darran
Baird said. "As a senior, there
could be nothing better than to
win against Cal."
At the end of a season that
Gillingham says "mirrors my
career ups and downs," the gradu
ating class will be closing a chap
ter in Stanford football history.
When coach Denny Green took
over the program in 1989, those
players recruited by former coach
Jack Elway were forced to adjust
to a completely different style of
coaching.
"Our class got caught in the
middle of a situation in which we
had to learn to play the game a dif
ferent way," Palmbush said.
"The staff changeover was one
hell of a learning experience,"
Gillingham said. "We matured a
lot from it."
Green commends the group for
sticking through the transition
and expresses his pride in their
achievements.
"They're a hard-working group

that has been through a lot,"
Green said. "These past four years
have been hard in that the team
hasn't quite reached its goal. But
the seniors have made tremen
dous strides, both personally and
as a group."
The players look back on their
individual collegiate careers and
find that the past four years have
indeed been rough, though defi
nitely successful at times.
"I haven't had the best of
luck," Palmbush said. "It's been
frustrating but it's still the game
of football and something I really
enjoy. It's what I came here to do."
"We had our ups and downs,"
Scott said. "At times I wish I could
have done more, but I'm happy
with what I've done. I'd do it all
over again."
The senior Cardinal football
players have one more chance to
do it again. Many of them find
themselves awash in nostalgia.
"It hit me all of a sudden at the
Washington State game," Baird
said. "It was the last time I would
march into the stadium with the
team. I couldn't help but get a tear
in my eye."
"It's a tough feeling," Palm
bush said. "There's no question it
will be the toughest after Big
Game. It will be the end of a 10-
year commitment to football."

Hopkins agrees that ending a
college career is something that
one can never be completely pre
pared for.
"You know for four years that
it's coming but you can never
really be prepared," Hopkins said.
"Still, I'm looking forward to
being done and looking back on
what I've accomplished."
Much of the sentimentality
that the seniors experience is due
to the team camaraderie.
"It's more than just football,"
Scott said. "It's relationships with
teammates that will last forever. I
know I will look back and smile
when I think about it."
For McCaffrey, Big Game is a
time to feel sentimental towards
friends, but it is also a time to look
towards the future.
"I will miss a lot of players and
friends," McCaffrey said. "But it's
time to move on."
As the Cardinal football seniors
look towards their future, some
have hopes of being drafted by the
NFL and others know that their
football careers are over.
"Personally, I haven't had
much thought of going pro,"
Palmbush said. "I've given up
nine years of my life but there are
other things out there to do. Col
lege was my time to play and now
I want to earn a living with my

brains."
Gillingham is unsure of his
football future but has prepared
other options.
"I'm applying to law school,"
Gillingham said. "If a football
career is out there, then great. If
not, then that's fine."
Running back Jon Volpe is
looking forward to making a fresh
start and putting forth his best
effort to make a professional foot
ball team.
Hopkins shares in the opti
mism.
"I think I will definitely have a
shot," Hopkins said. "Teams
always need a kicker."
Scott and McCaffrey also see a
possible football career in the
future.
"If not, I'll go out and start
interviewing like everyonfe else,"
McCaffrey said.
For now the senior Cardinal
football players have one more
task set out for them. In fighting
for a win that according to Green
"would heal a lot of wounds," the
12 graduating seniors will play
together for the last time.
"It's our last game together,
and therefore it's more intense
than any other game," Palmbush
said. "We have to give it all we got.
There's absolutely nothing to hold
back."
