# Only excitement is certain at Big Game
## 
### Swaminatha Gurudevan 
Yes, it's that time of year again
when the Bay Area goes crazy.
The Axe is up for grabs, the book
ies in Las Vegas place their bets,
and the Stanford Cardinal
marches into Berkeley to take on
the California Golden Bears in the
annual Big Game.
Big Game is the final game of
the regular season, an opportu
nity for Cardinal football to
defend the Axe against the
marauding Golden Bears.
Perhaps the most vivid symbol
of Big Game and the rivalry that
exists between Stanford and Cal is
the Axe. As Chris Myers, former
Daily writer, notes, the Axe is "a
sharp piece of metal suitable for
cutting wood, rendered virtually
useless by its lack of a handle. An
object of jealousy, thievery, compe
tition, bloodlust. A symbol of the
longest-standing and richest rival
ries in collegiate athletics. The
spoils of the Big Game."
The inscription engraved on
the plaque mounted beneath the
Axe describes it best, stating:
"The Stanford Axe Forged
March 1899. Captured by Califor
nia April 15,1899. Recaptured by
Stanford April 3, 1930. To be
awarded annually to the winner of
'The Big Game.'"
The Cardinal has done an ade
quate job of defending the Axe,
winning Big Game twice and tying
once in the past three years. They
have a 44-37-11 series lead and a
5-4-1 edge during the 1980s.
One of the four Cardinal
defeats this decade was a particu
larly heartbreaking and forever
immortalized match-up, occur

ring on Nov. 20, 1982. Cal
clinched the victory on a multi-lat
eral, last second miracle play
known as The Play. The Play has
been called the most amazing run
back in football history and has
been preserved on countless high
light films.
With less than a minute to play,
the Cardinal trailed, 19-17 and it
appeared that the Bears would be
triumphant. Starting from his
own 20, Cardinal quarterback
John Elway engineered a spectac
ular drive that took the team the
length of the field, including a
fourth-and-17 conversion at the
Cardinal 13. The drive culmi
nated in a 35-yard field goal by
Mark Harmon. The Cardinal led,
20-19.
It was over.
Not so fast, Cardinal fans.
There were still four ticks on the
clock and Stanford had to kick off.
Harmon's squib-kick was fielded
at Cal's 44 and on the ensuing
runback, five laterals took place as
the Golden Bears shocked the
Cardinal by returning the kickoff
for a touchdown. Golden Bear
Kevin Moen scored the winning
touchdown, running through
Stanford Band trombonist Gary
Tyrrell.
Eight years after The Play,
football players have a different
vision of Big Game. For seniors
Chuck Gillingham, Jono Tunney,
Kevin Scott and Ed McCaffrey,
Big Game will be an opportunity
to beat Cal in their final game at
Stanford.
Gillingham, a fifth-year senior
playing left guard, has had an
exceptional career here at Stan
ford, starting 32 of the last 33

games for the Cardinal.
Tunney, an inside linebacker,
led all Stanford tacklers in 1988
with 155, third best in the Pacific
10 Conference and had an impres
sive performance against Arizona.
Scott is considered one of the
finest cornerbacks in the nation.
His contributions to Stanford
football have been phenomenal,
including a 95-yard kickoff return
for a touchdown in 1988's Big

Game. "Kevin has tremendous
quickness," Stanford head coach
Denny Green noted. "He is one of
the top competitors at Stanford
today."
Wide receiver Ed McCaffrey,
has led the Pac-10 in receptions
and receiving yardage throughout
the season and is currently third
in the nation in total cataches.
These aforementioned four
seniors will perhaps save their

best for last today, and Stanford
football will attempt to cap off the
1990 season with a 5-6 record,
improving tremendously on its 3-
8 finish last year.
Will the Axe stay at Stanford
for yet another year? Will
Palumbis have incredible num
bers passing? Will the Band have
a spectacular show at halftime?
At 3:30 p.m. today, all those
questions will be answered.

For the 93rd time since 1892, the Cardinal and the Golden Bears will be facing off to do battle for The
Axe. The Cardinal hold a 44-37-11 edge, but the Bears are bowl bound this year. Of course, this being
Big Game, history has taught that anything can happen.
