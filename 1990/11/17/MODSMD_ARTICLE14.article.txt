# Coach Green brings fresh air to the Farm

Records can certainly be
deceiving.
Dennis Green heads into
today's game against California
with a 7-14 record as head coach
at Stanford. But the difference
between the current Cardinal
team and that of a few years ago is
undeniable.
"Coach Green has brought the
pride of the past back into Stan
ford football," senior cornerback
Kevin Scott said. "It hasn't shown
in our record yet, but it will. It def
initely will."
Green took over a collapsing
Stanford football program in Jan
uary 1989. The Cardinal had tum
bled from an 8-4 Gator Bowl team
in 1986 to a 3-6-2 squad in 1988, a
team that fell far short of presea
son expectations. Immediately
after his arrival, Green recognized
several changes that had to be
made.
"I knew that to do anything
else, we had to reestablish that
commitment to winning," the sec
ond-year coach said. "We had to
reestablish a consistent winning
streak."
From the start, Green's coach
ing philosophy differed greatly
from that of previous coach Jack
Elway. He stressed a physical,

attacking approach that was
nonexistent two years ago at Stan
ford.
"When I came here, I knew
that we had to become more phys
ical defensively," Green said.
"Stronger teams like Washington
and Southern Cal were just driv
ing the ball down our throats. We
needed a tough off-season train
ing program."
The new element in the pro
gram was apparent immediately
to former Elway players.
"Coach Green brought a much
more aggressive style of play to
Stanford," senior linebacker Jono
Tunney said. "[The veterans] all
realized that things around here
were definitely on the upswing."
Green's first two seasons as
head coach have undoubtedly
been marked by sparks of bril
liance. In a 1989 game against
Oregon, the Cardinal scored the
final 18 points of the game,
including a touchdown as time
expired to register an 18-17 upset
over the Ducks. At times in 1990,
such as against Oregon State and
Arizona, Stanford looked down
right dominant on both sides of
the field.
And then there was the Notre
Dame game.
The coach called the 36-31
upset of the top-ranked Irish "a
great step for Stanford football."

Indeed, the victoiy was a perfect
indicator of just how far Stanford
has come as a team in its two
years under Green.
"Two years ago, a victory over
Notre Dame wouldn't even have
been thought about," Tunney
said. "The time has finally come
when the team actually can
believe in its coaches."
Green, at the age of 39, became
one of the youngest head coaches
in the history of Stanford football.
However, he certainly did not lack
experience or familiarity with the
Cardinal program.
After graduating from lowa in
1971, he played for one season
with the British Columbia Lions
of the Canadian Football League.
He returned to lowa in 1972 as a
graduate assistant coach. From
1974 to 1977, Green was the
receivers' coach at his alma mater
before coming to Stanford for the
first time in 1977.
Under the tutelage of then
head coach Bill Walsh, the Cardi
nal experienced two of its best sea
sons in recent history. As running
backs coach in 1977 and 1978,
Green helped the Cardinal to a 17-
7 record, and back-to-back bowl
victories (over Louisiana State in
the 1977 Sun Bowl and Georgia in
the 1978 Bluebonnet Bowl).
It was at Stanford in the late
1970s that Green developed his

reputation as one of the strongest
recruiters in the game. Darrin
Nelson, one of the greatest run
ning backs in Cardinal history,
was the gem of a superb nucleus
of players brought in by the coach
in his two years.
After moving with Walsh to the
San Francisco 49ers in 1979,
Green returned to Stanford as
offensive coordinator under coach
Paul Wiggin in 1980. In that sin
gle season, Green, using All-
Americans Ken Margerum and
John Elway, developed one of the
most potent offenses in the Pacific
10 Conference.
At the age of 31, Green was
hired to coach at Northwestern.
He ended the school's NCAA
record 34 game losing streak and
was named Big Ten Conference
Coach of the Year in 1982. When
Green left Northwestern in 1985,
there was no question that the
school's football fortunes had
begun to change.
However, the expectations at
an athletic powerhouse like Stan
ford automatically exceeded those
of Northwestern. Green admits
that Stanford has not been as suc
cessful as he anticipated in 1990.
"I think that this has been a
season of missed opportunities,"
he said. "We've played hard all
