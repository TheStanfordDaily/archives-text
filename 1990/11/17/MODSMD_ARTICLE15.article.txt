# Cal/Stanford Matchups
## 
### 
In his final start, Scott will be
matched up with one of the Pac
10's finest receivers. Treggs is
currently fifth in the conference
in receptions with 42 catches for
541 yards. Against Oregon,
Treggs pulled down five catches
for 106 yards to put him in the
fourth spot on the all-time Cal
reception list. QBs have avoided
throwing to Scott's side of the
field all season, but look for
Pawlawski to try to sneak a few
passes past Scott in order to hit
his premier receiver.

With dependable protection
from his offensive line throughout
the year, Pawlawski has effec
tively directed the Golden Bear
offense to its most successful sea
son in recent memory. Pawlawski
has already thrown for 17 touch
downs this season and would love
to air it out against the Stanford
secondary. Tunney heads the list
of Cardinal defensive linebackers
with 71 tackles and will lead a
charge of Stanford defenders
through the line to pressure the
Golden Bear quarterback.

In his final collegiate appear
ance, McCaffrey will be looking to
secure a position on first-team All-
America with one last strong per
formance. After sitting out the
second half with a thigh bruise
against Arizona, McCaffrey hopes
to be at 100 percent in his
matchup against the 6-foot-1 Wil
son. Wilson has come out of the
Golden Bear secondary to record
65 tackles this year. As usual, the
6-5 McCaffrey will stretch out and
use his height as an advantage
against his shorter opponent.

Redmond has been a key player
in the Cal defensive turnaround.
After trying to maintain his pride
through his first three years on an
embarrassing defensive unit, Red
mond has exploded this season to
lead the Golden Bears with 84
tackles. In a similar situation, Mil
burn heads a corps of talented
Cardinal running backs and put
together his best rushing game of
the season against Arizona. Mil
burn leads the Pac-10 with 1843
all-purpose yards. Redmond will
attempt to fill up the inside and
force Palumbis to get the ball to
Milburn in the air, not on the
ground.

Palumbis has far exceeded
expectations this season. He leads
the Pac-10 with a 69.3 passing
percentage and has thrown for
2,326 yards. Except for a midsea
son lull, Palumbis has successfully
directed the Stanford passing
offense, which now leads the
league with an average of 251.0
yards a game. In his final home
game, English will attempt to
eliminate Palumbis' passing
options by putting together effec
tive secondary coverage. Coming
out of his strong safety position,
English has marked up 53 tackles
for the Golden Bears.

Forget what a bear does in the
woods; our tree has never been part
of any forest. The Tree changes its
form every year to keep pace with
the individuality that sets it apart
from every other mascot in the
country. Yo Cal! Seen the UCLA
Bruin? Hmm ... brown, furry,
stupid grin on its face—yup, same
dumb bear. Atta babe Berkeley, way
to be original! Aside from that,
trees have good practical purpose
(wood don't ya know); Bears are
only good as subjects of National
Geographic specials, and we all
know what great ratings PBS gets.
