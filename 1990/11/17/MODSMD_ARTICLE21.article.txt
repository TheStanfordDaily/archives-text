# Backcourt superstar forced into limelight

### David Hirning Senior staff writer 
Conversation recently over
heard at a dining hall somewhere
on campus:
"Hey, you get your basketball
passes yet?"
"Yeah, I bought the men's pass,
but I decided not to get the
women's tickets."
"You what? You mean you're
going to blow off the defending
national champs this year? Are
you crazy?"
"Heck, they're not gonna be
any good this year. They lost Azzi
and the small forward, what's her
name, Steding. Why would I go?"
"Get real. They're going back to
the Final Four, you watch. They
still got Sonja Henning, right?"
"Sonja who?"
Henning. Sort of rhymes with
winning. Sort of the glue that held
last year's dynamic championship
team together. If you haven't been
properly introduced, meet Sonja
Henning, point guard, senior co
captain of the Stanford Cardinal.
Although perhaps the best kept
secret in the nation for the last
three years, Henning is no
stranger to those who have had
the misfortune to go up against
her. While her teammates have
racked up big numbers, Henning
is the invisible force behind the
Cardinal's high-powered offensive
attack.

But anonymity is part of the
point guard's job description, and
there is no better one in the col
lege women's game today. Maybe
even in the college game period.
To watch Sonja Henning run the
point is to see a true artist at
work. One is not aware of the
artist's hand in the finished cre
ation, but only of the beauty that
is evoked.
That is why Henning could go
unnoticed last year, as the Cardi
nal went 32-1 and captured its
first-ever national title with an
88-81 win over Auburn. Why she
could lead all Stanford scorers
with 21 points and pull down nine
rebounds in that game yet be left
off the all-Final Four team. And
why she can seem so unperturbed
by the lack of recognition.
"It's just a matter of winning
ballgames and whatever it takes
to win it," she said. "I still want to
win, I wanted to win last year, and
right now it's still my primary
goal."
All good things must come to
an end, however, and Henning will
be unable to avoid the spotlight
this season as the Cardinal pre
pares to defend its NCAA title.
Already a leader on the floor, Hen
ning will have to assume even
more of an exemplary role with
the loss of such players as Azzi,
Steding and Stacy Parson.
It is a mark of Henning's lead

Though largely ignored last year because of Jennifer Azzi, Sonja Henning (above) was the glue that lifted
her team to the NCAA Championship. The National Freshman of the Year three years ago, the senior
will once again be called upon to lead her team to glory.
