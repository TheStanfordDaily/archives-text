# Backcourt superstar forced into limelight
## 
### David Hirning Senior staff writer 
Conversation recently over
heard at a dining hall somewhere
on campus:
"Hey, you get your basketball
passes yet?"
"Yeah, I bought the men's pass,
but I decided not to get the
women's tickets."
"You what? You mean you're
going to blow off the defending
national champs this year? Are
you crazy?"
"Heck, they're not gonna be
any good this year. They lost Azzi
and the small forward, what's her
name, Steding. Why would I go?"
"Get real. They're going back to
the Final Four, you watch. They
still got Sonja Henning, right?"
"Sonja who?"
Henning. Sort of rhymes with
winning. Sort of the glue that held
last year's dynamic championship
team together. If you haven't been
properly introduced, meet Sonja
Henning, point guard, senior co
captain of the Stanford Cardinal.
Although perhaps the best kept
secret in the nation for the last
three years, Henning is no
stranger to those who have had
the misfortune to go up against
her. While her teammates have
racked up big numbers, Henning
is the invisible force behind the
Cardinal's high-powered offensive
attack.

But anonymity is part of the
point guard's job description, and
there is no better one in the col
lege women's game today. Maybe
even in the college game period.
To watch Sonja Henning run the
point is to see a true artist at
work. One is not aware of the
artist's hand in the finished cre
ation, but only of the beauty that
is evoked.
That is why Henning could go
unnoticed last year, as the Cardi
nal went 32-1 and captured its
first-ever national title with an
88-81 win over Auburn. Why she
could lead all Stanford scorers
with 21 points and pull down nine
rebounds in that game yet be left
off the all-Final Four team. And
why she can seem so unperturbed
by the lack of recognition.
"It's just a matter of winning
ballgames and whatever it takes
to win it," she said. "I still want to
win, I wanted to win last year, and
right now it's still my primary
goal."
All good things must come to
an end, however, and Henning will
be unable to avoid the spotlight
this season as the Cardinal pre
pares to defend its NCAA title.
Already a leader on the floor, Hen
ning will have to assume even
more of an exemplary role with
the loss of such players as Azzi,
Steding and Stacy Parson.
It is a mark of Henning's lead

ership and past performance as a
three-year starter that the loss of
those players doesn't faze her in
the slightest.
"I don't see any difference this
year," she said. "We have a great
group of people, and I don't see
any difference in what my role is.
Our team is exceptional in that
we're all followers and we're all
leaders."
Henning will excuse her coach
for disagreeing with her slightly.
Tara VanDerveer has been quick
to credit her point guard with
much of her squad's success over
the years, and especially so this
season. "It all starts with Sonja,"
VanDerveer said recently. "She's
our floor captain. She's the key:
her defensive pressure, she
pushes the ball up the court ...
she's definitely the key to our suc
cess. She makes everyone else
look good."
The veteran coach once told a
reporter, "I could leave practice,
and no one would notice. If Sonja
left, things would fall apart."
Henning came to the Farm
from Racine, Wis., three years ago
and cemented a backcourt that
quickly became known as the
nation's best. With the multi-tal
ented sophomore Azzi at shooting
guard, Henning deftly made the
transition from high school scor
ing star (28.3 points-per-game) to
unselfish point guard.
The result? Merely a National
Freshman of the Year award, 10.8
points per game, and 128 assists
(4 per game). But, as always
seems to be the case with Hen
ning, it was the team's perfor
mance that highlighted her
impact best. Only .500 (14-14) the

previous year, Stanford posted a
remarkable 27-5 record that sea
son and advanced to the NCAA
tournament.
Success was nothing new for
Henning, who led her high school
team to the state finals and in the
process garnered All-America sta
tus and the title of "Miss
Basketball" in Wisconsin. Yet
when it came time to choose a col
lege, the recruit ignored the tradi
tional powers and chose an unher
alded Stanford program.
Why not stay closer to home
and contend for an NCAA title, or
follow childhood hero Cheryl
Miller to USC? The key to Hen
ning's decision was not basket
ball, but academics. "I knew I
wanted to go to a great school,"
said the economics major, who did
the traditional Stanford student
one better by earning a 4.3 GPA in
high school.
"I knew basketball would end
someday, and where I got my
degree was more important than
the basketball tradition."
Still, Henning would watch the
NCAA championship games on
TV as a kid, and always hoped to
be there one day. She saw that the
team had potential when she
arrived, but no one knew just how
much that potential would blos
som.
Henning has blossomed along
with it, and proved it to herself,
and to those that weren't aware of
her talents by making the U.S.
national team this past summer.
Along with Cardinal teammate
Azzi, Henning helped the team
win both the World Champi
onships and the Goodwill Games.
For Henning, the summer was
both exciting and enlightening.
"It was a great experience, I got
to see a lot of great American and
international players play," she
said. "It's an entirely different

game from the collegiate level
it's a much quicker, much more
physical game. It tries to be a
strictly transition game."
VanDerveer sees Henning's
summer experience paying divi
dends this year in practice. "Play
ing on the national team has
really helped her a lot," the coach
said. "She's shooting the bail
really well, her threes are looking
good and she's been unstoppable
at practice."
Watching Henning play can be
a tiring experience. She never
stays still and is always moving or
directing traffic. The arrival of
Henning allowed VanDerveer to
install one of the most successful
up-tempo offenses in the nation.
An accurate passer, Henning can
hit the outlet or run the break
herself, penetrating inside for a
layup, a foul, or both.
"You have to have a really good
group of players that can pull [the
fast break] off," Henning said.
"It's a lot of fun to play an up
tempo game, to run up and down
the court. But on our team, we
like to run, but we have great
block players and in half-court we
should be able to match with any
one.
It would seem as if Henning
could retire early, now that the
Cardinal has reached the ultimate
plateau of an NCAA title. But the
senior would be the first to say
that this team has an even greater
ambition.
"I think the win last year has
given us greater incentive to do it
again," she said. "It's a bigger
challenge to repeat than to actu
ally win it, so we're facing it as a
bigger challenge."
And if the Cardinal can pull it
off, undoubtedly by the end of the
year there won't be a basketball
fan in the nation who will be ask
ing, "Sonja who?"

"You have to have a really good
group of players that can pull [the
fast break] off," Henning said.
"It's a lot of fun to play an up
tempo game, to run up and down
the court. But on our team, we
like to run, but we have great
block players and in half-court we
should be able to match with any
one.
It would seem as if Henning
could retire early, now that the
Cardinal has reached the ultimate
plateau of an NCAA title. But the
senior would be the first to say
that this team has an even greater
ambition.
"I think the win last year has
given us greater incentive to do it
again," she said. "It's a bigger
challenge to repeat than to actu
ally win it, so we're facing it as a
bigger challenge."
And if the Cardinal can pull it
off, undoubtedly by the end of the
year there won't be a basketball
fan in the nation who will be ask
ing, "Sonja who?"
Conversation recently over
heard at a dining hall somewhere
on campus:
"Hey, you get your basketball
passes yet?"
"Yeah, I bought the men's pass,
but I decided not to get the
women's tickets."
"You what? You mean you're
going to blow off the defending
national champs this year? Are
you crazy?"
"Heck, they're not gonna be
any good this year. They lost Azzi
and the small forward, what's her
name, Steding. Why would I go?"
"Get real. They're going back to
the Final Four, you watch. They
still got Sonja Henning, right?"
"Sonja who?"
Henning. Sort of rhymes with
winning. Sort of the glue that held
last year's dynamic championship
team together. If you haven't been
properly introduced, meet Sonja
Henning, point guard, senior co
captain of the Stanford Cardinal.
Although perhaps the best kept
secret in the nation for the last
three years, Henning is no
stranger to those who have had
the misfortune to go up against
her. While her teammates have
racked up big numbers, Henning
is the invisible force behind the
Cardinal's high-powered offensive
attack.

But anonymity is part of the
point guard's job description, and
there is no better one in the col
lege women's game today. Maybe
even in the college game period.
To watch Sonja Henning run the
point is to see a true artist at
work. One is not aware of the
artist's hand in the finished cre
ation, but only of the beauty that
is evoked.
That is why Henning could go
unnoticed last year, as the Cardi
nal went 32-1 and captured its
first-ever national title with an
88-81 win over Auburn. Why she
could lead all Stanford scorers
with 21 points and pull down nine
rebounds in that game yet be left
off the all-Final Four team. And
why she can seem so unperturbed
by the lack of recognition.
"It's just a matter of winning
ballgames and whatever it takes
to win it," she said. "I still want to
win, I wanted to win last year, and
right now it's still my primary
goal."
All good things must come to
an end, however, and Henning will
be unable to avoid the spotlight
this season as the Cardinal pre
pares to defend its NCAA title.
Already a leader on the floor, Hen
ning will have to assume even
more of an exemplary role with
the loss of such players as Azzi,
Steding and Stacy Parson.
It is a mark of Henning's lead

ership and past performance as a
three-year starter that the loss of
those players doesn't faze her in
the slightest.
"I don't see any difference this
year," she said. "We have a great
group of people, and I don't see
any difference in what my role is.
Our team is exceptional in that
we're all followers and we're all
leaders."
Henning will excuse her coach
for disagreeing with her slightly.
Tara VanDerveer has been quick
to credit her point guard with
much of her squad's success over
the years, and especially so this
season. "It all starts with Sonja,"
VanDerveer said recently. "She's
our floor captain. She's the key:
her defensive pressure, she
pushes the ball up the court ...
she's definitely the key to our suc
cess. She makes everyone else
look good."
The veteran coach once told a
reporter, "I could leave practice,
and no one would notice. If Sonja
left, things would fall apart."
Henning came to the Farm
from Racine, Wis., three years ago
and cemented a backcourt that
quickly became known as the
nation's best. With the multi-tal
ented sophomore Azzi at shooting
guard, Henning deftly made the
transition from high school scor
ing star (28.3 points-per-game) to
unselfish point guard.
The result? Merely a National
Freshman of the Year award, 10.8
points per game, and 128 assists
(4 per game). But, as always
seems to be the case with Hen
ning, it was the team's perfor
mance that highlighted her
impact best. Only .500 (14-14) the

previous year, Stanford posted a
remarkable 27-5 record that sea
son and advanced to the NCAA
tournament.
Success was nothing new for
Henning, who led her high school
team to the state finals and in the
process garnered All-America sta
tus and the title of "Miss
Basketball" in Wisconsin. Yet
when it came time to choose a col
lege, the recruit ignored the tradi
tional powers and chose an unher
alded Stanford program.
Why not stay closer to home
and contend for an NCAA title, or
follow childhood hero Cheryl
Miller to USC? The key to Hen
ning's decision was not basket
ball, but academics. "I knew I
wanted to go to a great school,"
said the economics major, who did
the traditional Stanford student
one better by earning a 4.3 GPA in
high school.
"I knew basketball would end
someday, and where I got my
degree was more important than
the basketball tradition."
Still, Henning would watch the
NCAA championship games on
TV as a kid, and always hoped to
be there one day. She saw that the
team had potential when she
arrived, but no one knew just how
much that potential would blos
som.
Henning has blossomed along
with it, and proved it to herself,
and to those that weren't aware of
her talents by making the U.S.
national team this past summer.
Along with Cardinal teammate
Azzi, Henning helped the team
win both the World Champi
onships and the Goodwill Games.
For Henning, the summer was
both exciting and enlightening.
"It was a great experience, I got
to see a lot of great American and
international players play," she
said. "It's an entirely different

game from the collegiate level
it's a much quicker, much more
physical game. It tries to be a
strictly transition game."
VanDerveer sees Henning's
summer experience paying divi
dends this year in practice. "Play
ing on the national team has
really helped her a lot," the coach
said. "She's shooting the bail
really well, her threes are looking
good and she's been unstoppable
at practice."
Watching Henning play can be
a tiring experience. She never
stays still and is always moving or
directing traffic. The arrival of
Henning allowed VanDerveer to
install one of the most successful
up-tempo offenses in the nation.
An accurate passer, Henning can
hit the outlet or run the break
herself, penetrating inside for a
layup, a foul, or both.
"You have to have a really good
group of players that can pull [the
fast break] off," Henning said.
"It's a lot of fun to play an up

both exciting and enlightening.
"It was a great experience, I got
to see a lot of great American and
international players play," she
said. "It's an entirely different

game from the collegiate level
it's a much quicker, much more
physical game. It tries to be a
strictly transition game."
VanDerveer sees Henning's
summer experience paying divi
dends this year in practice. "Play
ing on the national team has
really helped her a lot," the coach
said. "She's shooting the bail
really well, her threes are looking
good and she's been unstoppable
at practice."
Watching Henning play can be
a tiring experience. She never
stays still and is always moving or
directing traffic. The arrival of
Henning allowed VanDerveer to
install one of the most successful
up-tempo offenses in the nation.
An accurate passer, Henning can
hit the outlet or run the break
herself, penetrating inside for a
layup, a foul, or both.
"You have to have a really good
group of players that can pull [the
fast break] off," Henning said.
"It's a lot of fun to play an up
tempo game, to run up and down
the court. But on our team, we
like to run, but we have great
block players and in half-court we
should be able to match with any
one.
It would seem as if Henning
could retire early, now that the
Cardinal has reached the ultimate
plateau of an NCAA title. But the
senior would be the first to say
that this team has an even greater
ambition.
"I think the win last year has
given us greater incentive to do it
again," she said. "It's a bigger
challenge to repeat than to actu
ally win it, so we're facing it as a
bigger challenge."
And if the Cardinal can pull it
off, undoubtedly by the end of the
year there won't be a basketball
fan in the nation who will be ask
ing, "Sonja who?"
