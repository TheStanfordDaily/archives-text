Re: The Stanford Band's
Pregame and Halftime Shows
at Big Game

We wish to discuss the suspi
cious rumors regarding the Stan
ford Band's Big Game program.
Due to its desire to "surprise" the
football fans, the Stanford Band
has refused to reveal publicly its
plans for this weekend. Several
overt and covert attempts to dis
cover what the group will perform
have been met with dismal failure.
Even the intense media atten
tion focused on the Band in
wake of the Stanford Athletic
Department's momentary sus
pension of the group has not
induced it to talk.
Our inside man in the Band,
however, has uncovered some
information that could prove use
ful Saturday. There is apparently
no truth to the rumor that the
Band will present the "Zits A-Pop
pin'" show. We repeat THIS IS
FALSE!!! Our contact refused to
reveal further specifics, claiming:
"I could tell you more but I'd
have to kill you."
Nevertheless, according to
16th-century playwright William
Shakespeare: "The Band is full of
noises, sounds and sweet airs,
that give delight and hurt not."
Despite this pithy observation,
Shakespeare would neither con
firm nor deny that that the Stan
ford Band will actually perform
the so-called "Raging Salami"

show.
Suffice to say that local meat
processing plants and butcher
shops have been placed at Defcon
3, and all bratwurst within 50
miles has been impounded.
These precautions, coupled
with our fruit-throwing students,
should provide adequate protec
tion from the Band throughout
Big Game.
Now if only we could kidnap
that meddling Tree ...
