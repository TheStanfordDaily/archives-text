# Chalk Talk 'The Play'

Whether it's, as some say, the "Greatest Play in College Football History," "The 11-20-82 Robbery," or simply just "The Play," California's five-lateral,
kickoff-return-for-game-winning-touchdown was no doubt one of the most memorable Big Game moments. With Stanford having just taken a 20-19 lead and receiving a 15-yard penalty
for excessive celebration, Mark Harmon squib kicked the ball to Kevin Moen (1). He fielded it at the Cal 44 and quickly threw an overhand lateral to Richard Rodgers. Seeing little
daylight (2), Rodgers quickly lateraled to Dwight Garner. That should have been it as Gamer was seemingly tackled by a combination of Cardinal defenders Mark Andrew, Dave Wyman
and Jack Gilmete (3). Somehow, the whistles weren't blown and the ball was flipped back to Rodgers. He headed right and lateraled to Marlet Ford (4). Viewers of the replay have
claimed the toss was forward. Regardless, Ford proceeded upfield and, when confronted by more Stanford special teamers, flipped the ball backward hoping Moen would be there.
He was; he made his way through the Band; and he crashed into trombonist Gary Tyrrell in the end zone (6) as he scored. Cal's 25-19 victory prompted then-Cardinal quarterback John
Elway to say: "These guys (the officials) ruined my last game as a college player. This is a farce and a joke."
