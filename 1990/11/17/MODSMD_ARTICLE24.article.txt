# Birch still on top

As evidenced by its five consec
utive NCAA championships, the
Stanford women's tennis team
has been, and continues to be, the
dominant force in its sport. With
three team titles and one individ
ual crown under her belt, senior
Sandra Birch epitomizes this suc
cess.
Birch is looking forward to the
exciting challenges of her final col
legiate season. She thinks that
Stanford has a good shot at win
ning this year's national champi
onship. However, according to
Birch, winning an unprecedented
sixth national championship in a
row will not be an easy task.
She says there will be a lot
more close matches this year and
the team will once again have to
come together as a cohesive unit
in order to win it all.
"There are a lot of very good
teams out there this year so we
must play very consistent tennis
to win," Birch said.
Last year's team did not lose a
single match. Over the summer,
however, two of the Cardinal's
best players, Lisa Green and
Meredith McGrath, moved on to
the professional circuit.
To offset these losses, Stanford
landed some of the most sought
after recruits in the nation, and
these new members must produce
immediately in order for the team
to continue with its phenomenal
success.

According to Birch, it is very
hard to predict how well the team
will do because the season is only
in its incipient stages. The first
dual meet of the season is not

until January, but, according to
the preseason Volvo Tennis/Colle
giate rankings, the Cardinal has
the No. 1 women's tennis team in
the nation.
Birch attributes much of the
team's unparalleled success to
coach Frank Brennan. Brennan's
ability to remove some of the pres
sure from his players at crucial
moments stands out as one of his
best coaching characteristics.
"Frank really emphasizes the
playing of the game for the sake of
enjoyment," Birch said.
Birch has two primary goals for
this year. As a singles player, she
wants to learn how to take control
of a match and become a much
more aggressive player. As a dou
bles player, Birch says she wants
to work on being more consistent.
Over the summer, she played
tennis almost every day and
worked on improving her topspin
backhand and her level of physical
fitness. In the past, Birch had
trouble playing against baseliners.
These players forced Birch to uti
lize a more aggressive playing
style with which she was unfamil
iar. She is hoping that her hard
work over the summer will help
her to control matches and will
pay off at NCAAs.
Over the past three years,
Birch has earned almost every sin
gle accolade that women's tennis
has to offer. She has been an Ail-
American three times. In 1989,
she won the NCAA Women's Sin
gles Championship and the Brod
erick Award, given annually to the
most outstanding collegiate
women's tennis player.
Birch's success is not limited to
