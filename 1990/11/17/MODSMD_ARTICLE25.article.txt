# Big Game Fun
## 
### Michael Clayton Beat Cal 
Without glorifying the petty
vandalism that typifies this week,
I decided to compile a Top 10 List
of Big Game Pranks. I must
emphasize that California Rally
Committee chair Tommy So
reports that "The Rally Commit
tee pulls off no pranks," and Stan
ford Axe Committee chair Pat
Broun explains that he has "no
comment" regarding any of the
following events.
10) Paying for pranks
Any prankster, regardless of
his preparation or the seriousness
of his venture, runs the risk of
getting nailed by the other side.
In 1965, a Stanford Band mem
ber and a Dollie determined to
journey to Cal, wanting to do a lit
tle painting on campus. In order
to discourage authorities from
suspecting them, the two individ
uals planned to step into the cor
ner if anyone approached and
exchange a bit of fluid.
However, undaunted by the
action in the shadows, a Cal Rally
Committee (Rally Comm) mem

ber interrupted the romantic
affair and accosted the two indi
viduals. He found red spray paint
cans hidden in their garments and
promptly escorted them into Rally
Comm headquarters where fellow
members were prepared with a
razor.
The Dollie was released after
receiving little punishment, only a
few hairs missing behind the left
ear, but the Stanford Band mem
ber had to trudge back to campus
with an undisguisable black mark.
In punishment for his ill-fated
attempt, the musician received an
embarrassing haircut his entire
head was shaved except for a
rather fuzzy "C" in the middle.
9) A shade of Cardinal
One of the oldest and most per
sistent activities of the Stanford
faithful as Big Game week
approaches is to turn the cement
"C" behind Memorial Stadium a
shade of cardinal.
Without marking up high
scores for uniqueness or difficulty
of execution, the tradition lives
on. The life of this tradition is
underlined by the fact that, in


Spec Ops
The capture of Oski in 1986 ranks second among the great Big Game pranks. The bear made it back to
Berkeley two years later after being found in San Francisco.
1942, 120 layers of paint were
removed from the sturdy symbol.
Of these layers, only 40 layers
were the Cal gold.; before the end
of World War 11, the symbol of the
Berkeley campus had been cov
ered by 80 coatings of red.
Still not satisfied to trash tradi
tion and stay gold for an entire
year, the cardinal "C" made its
annual appearance in Berkeley
earlier this month.
8) Floating fliers
Hiring private planes to write
messages and pull signs across the
sky has been a consistent part of
the Big Game festivities, but last
year, a few Cal students added a
creative twist to the aerial maneu
vers.
On Thursday night of Big
Game week, a few Cal students
rented a charter plane to fly over
the Stanford campus and drop
several thousand anti-Cardinal
fliers. With the usual "Go Bears"
and "Burn the Ugly Stanford
Tree" messages, the fliers were
supposed to disrupt a rally being
held at White Plaza for the foot

ball team.
Instead, the pranksters mis
navigated and dropped the pam
phlets on Wilbur and Stern Halls.
The students looked out of their
barrack windows and saw a bevy
of Berkeley fliers floating down
from the sky.
7) Band without bus
The Cal and Stanford bands
have always been active partici
pants in the festivities. But, in the
early 1980s, the Stanford Band
pulled off a most embarrassing
stunt on the Cal musicians.
Needing to bus to the game at
Stanford Stadium, the Cal band
had scheduled a 10 a.m. pick-up
time in Berkeley. Unfortunately
for the Golden Bear faithful, a few
Stanford Band members located
the bus company, and, the day
before Big Game, called and can
celed the Cal band's trip to Palo
Alto. - N
Unsuspectingly, the Cal band
waited in the parking lot until
10:30 before calling the bus com
pany. When the bus company
informed the band that their char
tered trip had been canceled the
previous day, the Cal band could
only grimace and frantically ask to
get another bus as soon as possi
ble.

By the time the new bus
arrived in Berkeley at 11 o'clock,
Saturday morning traffic had
appeared, and the band had no
hope of arriving at the game
before halftime much less by
kickoff.
The Stanford Band danced
through its halftime routine with
the smug knowledge that its musi
cal counterparts were stuck inside
a bus somewhere in the Penin
sula. Finally, in the middle of the
third quarter, the Cal band
marched into the stadium.
6) Cal critters on campus
Cal has taken advantage of the
animal kingdom in the past few
years to disturb the Stanford cam
pus.
The first appearance of small
rodents happened at the end of
Gaieties. While Stanford students
danced to the music of the Stan
ford Band and trumpeted about
the disgusting traits of the cam
pus up north, a few Cal students
quietly opened two shoe boxes full
of blue and gold mice. The Big
Game excitement quickly turned
the atmosphere in Memorial
Auditorium into pandemonium.
The Cal pranksters were not
content just to disturb the Stan
ford ralliers, however. Instead,
they decided to add some excite
ment to the lives of the nerds
locked in the confines of Green.
Thousands of crickets and hun
dreds of mice were released in the
stacks. For months, students
could hear the sounds of wildlife
when they went into Green to
study.

In fact, the lasting effects of
this campaign can still be experi
enced. If Stanford students ven
ture back into Green's dark
stacks, they will hear Cal's chirp
ing (and reproducing) crickets.
5) The most recent Axe theft
Attempting to gain control of
the Stanford Axe has been the pri
mary collegiate focus for a num
ber of Cal and Stanford students.
For these shifty-eyed individuals,
the past 17 years have been frus
trating.
In 1973, three Stanford stu
dents pulled off the last theft of
the Axe at Ming's in Palo Alto.
Posing as Cal coach Mike White,
the students called up the Rally
Comm and requested that the Axe
be brought to the Northern Cali
fornia Football Writers' weekly
meeting. After much discussion,
the students were able to convince
the Rally Comm that the press
wanted to take a picture of the
Axe a few weeks before-Big Game.
When the Axe arrived in the
parking lot at Ming's, the Stan
ford students confronted the Rally
Comm. Posed as Cal football play
ers, the students wielded bats and
snatched the Axe from the Cal
students.
4) Walking up and down
Hoover Tower
While random Bear prints
painted across campus have never
been that difficult to create, in the
early 19605, a few Cal students
tajught the Golden Bear how to
climb.
One afternoon Cal students

painted Bear claw prints moving
up Hoover Tower. University
President Wallace Sterling was so
incensed at the vandalism he
ordered that the prints come
down by the next morning or the
incident would be investigated.
The next morning, the Bear
prints were certainly coming
down Hoover Tower right next
to the paws going up the struc
ture.
3) Prepared to fire

With Cal embroiled in the mid
dle of the free speech movement in
1964, a few hard-core pranksters
forced the student body presi
dents at Stanford and Cal to pre
sent a joint statement that: "The
weeks before Big Game do not
constitute an open season for
assault, battery or vandalism, nor
is misguided school spirit a basis
for pardon."
On Halloween night, a group of
Stanford students had stolen the
prized golden cannon. The stu
dents entered into a locked stor
age tunnel beneath Memorial Sta
dium, lifted up the 600-pound bar
rel and carried it across the field
to put it into the back of a Dodge
Dart.
A few days later, the Rally
Comm discovered a car with its
bumper touching the ground in
the Stern parking lot and quickly
took the cannon back.
However, the Stanford crew
returned the next evening and
snuck into the Cal student union.
Foiling the supposedly tight secu
rity for the cannon, the Stanford
students informed the janitor in
the student union that the Rally
Comm needed to fix the barrel of
the cannon for the upcoming
game against Washington.
Within two days, the cannon
had returned the Farm.
At the same time, the Rally
Comm had confiscated among
other things a Stanford banner
and 20,000 stunt cards. After one
set of negotiations to trade the
victory cannon for the banner and
the cards failed at the San Fran
cisco Airport, the two groups met
for a second time outside the Cas
tle Bowling Alley, near the Cow
Palace.
At this point, the Big Game
rivalry became as hot as it has
ever been. Fifteen Stanford fresh
man and three cars surrounded
the Cal pickup that had brought
the stunt cards. One of the Stan
ford, students broke the right win

dow of the truck with a hammer
and squirted tear gas into the win
dow hoping to flush out the Cal
student.
Instead, the student picked up
a gas mask and also a loaded
revolver. Then, the Cal student
slammed his truck into the Stan
ford vehicles earning himself a
brief trip to the police office.
Finally, after the Cal student
was released by authorities, nego
tiations resumed and, at 1 a.m.,
the "Treaty of Castle Lanes" was
signed. The actual exchange of the
cannon for the cards and banner
occurred at 4 a.m. in of the Hall of
Justice in San Francisco.
2) The lost Golden Bear
Not much can be said in
print. The stuffed Oski appeared
on the Stanford campus. The eru
dite Oski wrote that he did not
want to return to Berkeley. The
unfortunate Oski had to return to
the stench of the Cal student
union after two years. Someone
knows more; no one tells more.
1) The Immortal 21

On April 3, 1930, 21 men from
Sequoia Hall scratched their
names into Big Game historical
records by recapturing the Stan
ford Axe from Cal.
In the 19305, the Axe was still
not the spoils for a Big Game vic
tory; instead, for nearly 30 years,
Cal students, whose predecessors
had taken the Axe from Stanford
students at a baseball game in
1899, brought the stolen mer
chandise out for display annually
at the springtime Axe Rally.
That evening the group fol
lowed the Axe procession back
from the Greek Theater to the
American Trust Company. While
the Cal protectors stepped out of
the armored car, the Stanford
pranksters yelled from the back of
their Buick, "We want to take a
picture."
The Grand Custodian stepped
out of the car to the blinding flash
of a camera bulb and to the rush
of 21 Stanford students, who
grabbed the Axe, tussled with the
Cal protectors, and then escaped
with a crowd with the spoils.
Without glorifying the petty
vandalism that typifies this week,
I decided to compile a Top 10 List

At this point, the Big Game
rivalry became as hot as it has
ever been. Fifteen Stanford fresh
man and three cars surrounded
the Cal pickup that had brought
the stunt cards. One of the Stan
ford, students broke the right win

dow of the truck with a hammer
and squirted tear gas into the win
dow hoping to flush out the Cal
student.
Instead, the student picked up
a gas mask and also a loaded
revolver. Then, the Cal student
slammed his truck into the Stan
ford vehicles earning himself a
brief trip to the police office.
Finally, after the Cal student
was released by authorities, nego
tiations resumed and, at 1 a.m.,
the "Treaty of Castle Lanes" was
signed. The actual exchange of the
cannon for the cards and banner
occurred at 4 a.m. in of the Hall of
Justice in San Francisco.
2) The lost Golden Bear
Not much can be said in
print. The stuffed Oski appeared
on the Stanford campus. The eru
dite Oski wrote that he did not
want to return to Berkeley. The
unfortunate Oski had to return to
the stench of the Cal student
union after two years. Someone
knows more; no one tells more.
1) The Immortal 21

On April 3, 1930, 21 men from
Sequoia Hall scratched their
names into Big Game historical
records by recapturing the Stan
ford Axe from Cal.
In the 19305, the Axe was still
not the spoils for a Big Game vic
tory; instead, for nearly 30 years,
Cal students, whose predecessors
had taken the Axe from Stanford
students at a baseball game in
1899, brought the stolen mer
chandise out for display annually
at the springtime Axe Rally.
That evening the group fol
lowed the Axe procession back
from the Greek Theater to the
American Trust Company. While
the Cal protectors stepped out of
the armored car, the Stanford
pranksters yelled from the back of
their Buick, "We want to take a
picture."
The Grand Custodian stepped
out of the car to the blinding flash
of a camera bulb and to the rush
of 21 Stanford students, who
grabbed the Axe, tussled with the
Cal protectors, and then escaped
with a crowd with the spoils.
Without glorifying the petty
vandalism that typifies this week,
I decided to compile a Top 10 List
of Big Game Pranks. I must
emphasize that California Rally
Committee chair Tommy So
reports that "The Rally Commit
tee pulls off no pranks," and Stan
ford Axe Committee chair Pat
Broun explains that he has "no
comment" regarding any of the
following events.
10) Paying for pranks
Any prankster, regardless of
his preparation or the seriousness
of his venture, runs the risk of
getting nailed by the other side.
In 1965, a Stanford Band mem
ber and a Dollie determined to
journey to Cal, wanting to do a lit
tle painting on campus. In order
to discourage authorities from
suspecting them, the two individ
uals planned to step into the cor
ner if anyone approached and
exchange a bit of fluid.
However, undaunted by the
action in the shadows, a Cal Rally
Committee (Rally Comm) mem

ber interrupted the romantic
affair and accosted the two indi
viduals. He found red spray paint
cans hidden in their garments and
promptly escorted them into Rally
Comm headquarters where fellow
members were prepared with a
razor.
The Dollie was released after
receiving little punishment, only a
few hairs missing behind the left
ear, but the Stanford Band mem
ber had to trudge back to campus
with an undisguisable black mark.
In punishment for his ill-fated
attempt, the musician received an
embarrassing haircut his entire
head was shaved except for a
rather fuzzy "C" in the middle.
9) A shade of Cardinal
One of the oldest and most per
sistent activities of the Stanford
faithful as Big Game week
approaches is to turn the cement
"C" behind Memorial Stadium a
shade of cardinal.
Without marking up high
scores for uniqueness or difficulty
of execution, the tradition lives
on. The life of this tradition is
underlined by the fact that, in


Spec Ops
The capture of Oski in 1986 ranks second among the great Big Game pranks. The bear made it back to
Berkeley two years later after being found in San Francisco.
1942, 120 layers of paint were
removed from the sturdy symbol.
Of these layers, only 40 layers
were the Cal gold.; before the end
of World War 11, the symbol of the
Berkeley campus had been cov
ered by 80 coatings of red.
Still not satisfied to trash tradi
tion and stay gold for an entire
year, the cardinal "C" made its
annual appearance in Berkeley
earlier this month.
8) Floating fliers
Hiring private planes to write
messages and pull signs across the
sky has been a consistent part of
the Big Game festivities, but last
year, a few Cal students added a
creative twist to the aerial maneu
vers.
On Thursday night of Big
Game week, a few Cal students
rented a charter plane to fly over
the Stanford campus and drop
several thousand anti-Cardinal
fliers. With the usual "Go Bears"
and "Burn the Ugly Stanford
Tree" messages, the fliers were
supposed to disrupt a rally being
held at White Plaza for the foot

ball team.
Instead, the pranksters mis
navigated and dropped the pam
phlets on Wilbur and Stern Halls.
The students looked out of their
barrack windows and saw a bevy
of Berkeley fliers floating down
from the sky.
7) Band without bus
The Cal and Stanford bands
have always been active partici
pants in the festivities. But, in the
early 1980s, the Stanford Band
pulled off a most embarrassing
stunt on the Cal musicians.
Needing to bus to the game at
Stanford Stadium, the Cal band
had scheduled a 10 a.m. pick-up
time in Berkeley. Unfortunately
for the Golden Bear faithful, a few
Stanford Band members located
the bus company, and, the day
before Big Game, called and can
celed the Cal band's trip to Palo
Alto. - N
Unsuspectingly, the Cal band
waited in the parking lot until
10:30 before calling the bus com
pany. When the bus company
informed the band that their char
tered trip had been canceled the
previous day, the Cal band could
only grimace and frantically ask to
get another bus as soon as possi
ble.

By the time the new bus
arrived in Berkeley at 11 o'clock,
Saturday morning traffic had
appeared, and the band had no
hope of arriving at the game
before halftime much less by
kickoff.
The Stanford Band danced
through its halftime routine with
the smug knowledge that its musi
cal counterparts were stuck inside
a bus somewhere in the Penin
sula. Finally, in the middle of the
third quarter, the Cal band
marched into the stadium.
6) Cal critters on campus
Cal has taken advantage of the
animal kingdom in the past few
years to disturb the Stanford cam
pus.
The first appearance of small
rodents happened at the end of
Gaieties. While Stanford students
danced to the music of the Stan
ford Band and trumpeted about
the disgusting traits of the cam
pus up north, a few Cal students
quietly opened two shoe boxes full
of blue and gold mice. The Big
Game excitement quickly turned
the atmosphere in Memorial
Auditorium into pandemonium.
The Cal pranksters were not
content just to disturb the Stan
ford ralliers, however. Instead,
they decided to add some excite
ment to the lives of the nerds
locked in the confines of Green.
Thousands of crickets and hun
dreds of mice were released in the
stacks. For months, students
could hear the sounds of wildlife
when they went into Green to
study.

In fact, the lasting effects of
this campaign can still be experi
enced. If Stanford students ven
ture back into Green's dark
stacks, they will hear Cal's chirp
ing (and reproducing) crickets.
5) The most recent Axe theft
Attempting to gain control of
the Stanford Axe has been the pri
mary collegiate focus for a num
ber of Cal and Stanford students.
For these shifty-eyed individuals,
the past 17 years have been frus
trating.
In 1973, three Stanford stu
dents pulled off the last theft of
the Axe at Ming's in Palo Alto.
Posing as Cal coach Mike White,
the students called up the Rally
Comm and requested that the Axe
be brought to the Northern Cali
fornia Football Writers' weekly
meeting. After much discussion,
the students were able to convince
the Rally Comm that the press
wanted to take a picture of the
Axe a few weeks before-Big Game.
When the Axe arrived in the
parking lot at Ming's, the Stan
ford students confronted the Rally
Comm. Posed as Cal football play
ers, the students wielded bats and
snatched the Axe from the Cal
students.
4) Walking up and down
Hoover Tower
While random Bear prints
painted across campus have never
been that difficult to create, in the
early 19605, a few Cal students
tajught the Golden Bear how to
climb.
One afternoon Cal students

painted Bear claw prints moving
up Hoover Tower. University
President Wallace Sterling was so
incensed at the vandalism he
ordered that the prints come
down by the next morning or the
incident would be investigated.
The next morning, the Bear
prints were certainly coming
down Hoover Tower right next
to the paws going up the struc
ture.
3) Prepared to fire

With Cal embroiled in the mid
dle of the free speech movement in
1964, a few hard-core pranksters
forced the student body presi
dents at Stanford and Cal to pre
sent a joint statement that: "The
weeks before Big Game do not
constitute an open season for
assault, battery or vandalism, nor
is misguided school spirit a basis
for pardon."
On Halloween night, a group of
Stanford students had stolen the
prized golden cannon. The stu
dents entered into a locked stor
age tunnel beneath Memorial Sta
dium, lifted up the 600-pound bar
rel and carried it across the field
to put it into the back of a Dodge
Dart.
A few days later, the Rally
Comm discovered a car with its
bumper touching the ground in
the Stern parking lot and quickly
took the cannon back.
However, the Stanford crew
returned the next evening and
snuck into the Cal student union.
Foiling the supposedly tight secu
rity for the cannon, the Stanford
students informed the janitor in
the student union that the Rally
Comm needed to fix the barrel of
the cannon for the upcoming
game against Washington.
Within two days, the cannon
had returned the Farm.
At the same time, the Rally
Comm had confiscated among
other things a Stanford banner
and 20,000 stunt cards. After one
set of negotiations to trade the
victory cannon for the banner and
the cards failed at the San Fran
cisco Airport, the two groups met
for a second time outside the Cas
tle Bowling Alley, near the Cow
Palace.
At this point, the Big Game
rivalry became as hot as it has
ever been. Fifteen Stanford fresh
man and three cars surrounded
the Cal pickup that had brought
the stunt cards. One of the Stan
ford, students broke the right win

dow of the truck with a hammer

ers, the students wielded bats and
snatched the Axe from the Cal
students.
4) Walking up and down
Hoover Tower
While random Bear prints
painted across campus have never
been that difficult to create, in the
early 19605, a few Cal students
tajught the Golden Bear how to
climb.
One afternoon Cal students

painted Bear claw prints moving
up Hoover Tower. University
President Wallace Sterling was so
incensed at the vandalism he
ordered that the prints come
down by the next morning or the
incident would be investigated.
The next morning, the Bear
prints were certainly coming
down Hoover Tower right next
to the paws going up the struc
ture.
3) Prepared to fire

With Cal embroiled in the mid
dle of the free speech movement in
1964, a few hard-core pranksters
forced the student body presi
dents at Stanford and Cal to pre
sent a joint statement that: "The
weeks before Big Game do not
constitute an open season for
assault, battery or vandalism, nor
is misguided school spirit a basis
for pardon."
On Halloween night, a group of
Stanford students had stolen the
prized golden cannon. The stu
dents entered into a locked stor
age tunnel beneath Memorial Sta
dium, lifted up the 600-pound bar
rel and carried it across the field
to put it into the back of a Dodge
Dart.
A few days later, the Rally
Comm discovered a car with its
bumper touching the ground in
the Stern parking lot and quickly
took the cannon back.
However, the Stanford crew
returned the next evening and
snuck into the Cal student union.
Foiling the supposedly tight secu
rity for the cannon, the Stanford
students informed the janitor in
the student union that the Rally
Comm needed to fix the barrel of
the cannon for the upcoming
game against Washington.
Within two days, the cannon
had returned the Farm.
At the same time, the Rally
Comm had confiscated among
other things a Stanford banner
and 20,000 stunt cards. After one
set of negotiations to trade the
victory cannon for the banner and
the cards failed at the San Fran
cisco Airport, the two groups met
for a second time outside the Cas
tle Bowling Alley, near the Cow
Palace.
At this point, the Big Game
rivalry became as hot as it has
ever been. Fifteen Stanford fresh
man and three cars surrounded
the Cal pickup that had brought
the stunt cards. One of the Stan
ford, students broke the right win

dow of the truck with a hammer
and squirted tear gas into the win
dow hoping to flush out the Cal
student.
Instead, the student picked up
a gas mask and also a loaded
revolver. Then, the Cal student
slammed his truck into the Stan
ford vehicles earning himself a
brief trip to the police office.
Finally, after the Cal student
was released by authorities, nego
tiations resumed and, at 1 a.m.,
the "Treaty of Castle Lanes" was
signed. The actual exchange of the
cannon for the cards and banner
occurred at 4 a.m. in of the Hall of
Justice in San Francisco.
2) The lost Golden Bear
Not much can be said in
print. The stuffed Oski appeared
on the Stanford campus. The eru
dite Oski wrote that he did not
want to return to Berkeley. The
unfortunate Oski had to return to
the stench of the Cal student
union after two years. Someone
knows more; no one tells more.
1) The Immortal 21

On April 3, 1930, 21 men from
Sequoia Hall scratched their
names into Big Game historical
records by recapturing the Stan
ford Axe from Cal.
In the 19305, the Axe was still
not the spoils for a Big Game vic
tory; instead, for nearly 30 years,
Cal students, whose predecessors
had taken the Axe from Stanford
students at a baseball game in
1899, brought the stolen mer
chandise out for display annually
at the springtime Axe Rally.
That evening the group fol
lowed the Axe procession back
from the Greek Theater to the
American Trust Company. While
the Cal protectors stepped out of
the armored car, the Stanford
pranksters yelled from the back of
their Buick, "We want to take a
picture."
The Grand Custodian stepped
out of the car to the blinding flash
of a camera bulb and to the rush
of 21 Stanford students, who
grabbed the Axe, tussled with the
Cal protectors, and then escaped
with a crowd with the spoils.
Without glorifying the petty
vandalism that typifies this week,
I decided to compile a Top 10 List
of Big Game Pranks. I must
emphasize that California Rally
Committee chair Tommy So
reports that "The Rally Commit
tee pulls off no pranks," and Stan
ford Axe Committee chair Pat
Broun explains that he has "no
comment" regarding any of the
following events.
10) Paying for pranks
Any prankster, regardless of
his preparation or the seriousness
of his venture, runs the risk of
getting nailed by the other side.
In 1965, a Stanford Band mem
ber and a Dollie determined to
journey to Cal, wanting to do a lit
tle painting on campus. In order
to discourage authorities from
suspecting them, the two individ
uals planned to step into the cor
ner if anyone approached and
exchange a bit of fluid.
However, undaunted by the
action in the shadows, a Cal Rally
Committee (Rally Comm) mem

ber interrupted the romantic
affair and accosted the two indi
viduals. He found red spray paint
cans hidden in their garments and
promptly escorted them into Rally
Comm headquarters where fellow
members were prepared with a
razor.
The Dollie was released after
receiving little punishment, only a
few hairs missing behind the left
ear, but the Stanford Band mem
ber had to trudge back to campus
with an undisguisable black mark.
In punishment for his ill-fated
attempt, the musician received an
embarrassing haircut his entire
head was shaved except for a
rather fuzzy "C" in the middle.
9) A shade of Cardinal
One of the oldest and most per
sistent activities of the Stanford
faithful as Big Game week
approaches is to turn the cement
"C" behind Memorial Stadium a
shade of cardinal.
Without marking up high
scores for uniqueness or difficulty
of execution, the tradition lives
on. The life of this tradition is
underlined by the fact that, in


Spec Ops
The capture of Oski in 1986 ranks second among the great Big Game pranks. The bear made it back to
Berkeley two years later after being found in San Francisco.
1942, 120 layers of paint were
removed from the sturdy symbol.
Of these layers, only 40 layers
were the Cal gold.; before the end
of World War 11, the symbol of the
Berkeley campus had been cov
ered by 80 coatings of red.
Still not satisfied to trash tradi
tion and stay gold for an entire
year, the cardinal "C" made its
annual appearance in Berkeley
earlier this month.
8) Floating fliers
Hiring private planes to write
messages and pull signs across the
sky has been a consistent part of
the Big Game festivities, but last
year, a few Cal students added a
creative twist to the aerial maneu
vers.
On Thursday night of Big
Game week, a few Cal students
rented a charter plane to fly over
the Stanford campus and drop
several thousand anti-Cardinal
fliers. With the usual "Go Bears"
and "Burn the Ugly Stanford
Tree" messages, the fliers were
supposed to disrupt a rally being
held at White Plaza for the foot

ball team.
Instead, the pranksters mis
navigated and dropped the pam
phlets on Wilbur and Stern Halls.
The students looked out of their
barrack windows and saw a bevy
of Berkeley fliers floating down
from the sky.
7) Band without bus
The Cal and Stanford bands
have always been active partici
pants in the festivities. But, in the
early 1980s, the Stanford Band
pulled off a most embarrassing
stunt on the Cal musicians.
Needing to bus to the game at
Stanford Stadium, the Cal band
had scheduled a 10 a.m. pick-up
time in Berkeley. Unfortunately
for the Golden Bear faithful, a few
Stanford Band members located
the bus company, and, the day
before Big Game, called and can
celed the Cal band's trip to Palo
Alto. - N
Unsuspectingly, the Cal band
waited in the parking lot until
10:30 before calling the bus com
pany. When the bus company
informed the band that their char
tered trip had been canceled the
previous day, the Cal band could
only grimace and frantically ask to
get another bus as soon as possi
ble.

By the time the new bus
arrived in Berkeley at 11 o'clock,
Saturday morning traffic had
appeared, and the band had no
hope of arriving at the game
before halftime much less by
kickoff.
The Stanford Band danced
through its halftime routine with
the smug knowledge that its musi
cal counterparts were stuck inside
a bus somewhere in the Penin
sula. Finally, in the middle of the
third quarter, the Cal band
marched into the stadium.
6) Cal critters on campus
Cal has taken advantage of the
animal kingdom in the past few
years to disturb the Stanford cam
pus.
The first appearance of small
rodents happened at the end of
Gaieties. While Stanford students
danced to the music of the Stan
ford Band and trumpeted about
the disgusting traits of the cam
pus up north, a few Cal students
quietly opened two shoe boxes full
of blue and gold mice. The Big
Game excitement quickly turned
the atmosphere in Memorial
Auditorium into pandemonium.
The Cal pranksters were not
content just to disturb the Stan
ford ralliers, however. Instead,
they decided to add some excite
ment to the lives of the nerds
locked in the confines of Green.
Thousands of crickets and hun
dreds of mice were released in the
stacks. For months, students
could hear the sounds of wildlife
when they went into Green to
study.

In fact, the lasting effects of
this campaign can still be experi
enced. If Stanford students ven
ture back into Green's dark
stacks, they will hear Cal's chirp
ing (and reproducing) crickets.
5) The most recent Axe theft
Attempting to gain control of
the Stanford Axe has been the pri
mary collegiate focus for a num
ber of Cal and Stanford students.
For these shifty-eyed individuals,
the past 17 years have been frus
trating.
In 1973, three Stanford stu
dents pulled off the last theft of
the Axe at Ming's in Palo Alto.
Posing as Cal coach Mike White,
the students called up the Rally
Comm and requested that the Axe
be brought to the Northern Cali
fornia Football Writers' weekly
meeting. After much discussion,
the students were able to convince
the Rally Comm that the press
wanted to take a picture of the
Axe a few weeks before-Big Game.
When the Axe arrived in the
parking lot at Ming's, the Stan
ford students confronted the Rally
Comm. Posed as Cal football play
ers, the students wielded bats and
snatched the Axe from the Cal
students.
