# Big Game Fun
## 
### Michael Clayton Beat Cal 
Without glorifying the petty
vandalism that typifies this week,
I decided to compile a Top 10 List
of Big Game Pranks. I must
emphasize that California Rally
Committee chair Tommy So
reports that "The Rally Commit
tee pulls off no pranks," and Stan
ford Axe Committee chair Pat
Broun explains that he has "no
comment" regarding any of the
following events.
10) Paying for pranks
Any prankster, regardless of
his preparation or the seriousness
of his venture, runs the risk of
getting nailed by the other side.
In 1965, a Stanford Band mem
ber and a Dollie determined to
journey to Cal, wanting to do a lit
tle painting on campus. In order
to discourage authorities from
suspecting them, the two individ
uals planned to step into the cor
ner if anyone approached and
exchange a bit of fluid.
However, undaunted by the
action in the shadows, a Cal Rally
Committee (Rally Comm) mem

ber interrupted the romantic
affair and accosted the two indi
viduals. He found red spray paint
cans hidden in their garments and
promptly escorted them into Rally
Comm headquarters where fellow
members were prepared with a
razor.
The Dollie was released after
receiving little punishment, only a
few hairs missing behind the left
ear, but the Stanford Band mem
ber had to trudge back to campus
with an undisguisable black mark.
In punishment for his ill-fated
attempt, the musician received an
embarrassing haircut his entire
head was shaved except for a
rather fuzzy "C" in the middle.
9) A shade of Cardinal
One of the oldest and most per
sistent activities of the Stanford
faithful as Big Game week
approaches is to turn the cement
"C" behind Memorial Stadium a
shade of cardinal.
Without marking up high
scores for uniqueness or difficulty
of execution, the tradition lives
on. The life of this tradition is
underlined by the fact that, in


Spec Ops
The capture of Oski in 1986 ranks second among the great Big Game pranks. The bear made it back to
Berkeley two years later after being found in San Francisco.
