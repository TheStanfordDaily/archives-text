# Alumni cherish pregame festivities

### Catherine Lewis 
Cars flood the campus. Horns
honk. Ticket scalpers vie for
attention. Shouting and laughing
voices pierce the air.
Once again the young and the
old alike have come to take part in
one of Stanford's most celebrated
traditions, the Big Game.
While the Big Game is obvi
ously about football, it's also
about old friends, sunny Satur
days and great parties tail
gaters as they are commonly
called. This year the Big Game
will be held at Berkeley, and many
Stanford fans will miss being
down on the Farm.
What is it that draws people to
the familiar haunts of the Farm
and the Big Game? It may be tra
dition that brings people back
year after year. A sense of security
and continuity can be found in a
scene that replays itself with
uncanny similarity Saturday upon
Saturday.
It is a pastime enjoyed by Stan
ford alumni and passed on to their
children and to their children's
children. It may also be about
shared values and a common rival.
The Big Game unites us.
"We've been coming here
together for 20 some odd years,"

Robert Fenwick, a Stanford grad
uate from the class of 1962, said.
It is a game day earlier this year,
and he stands before an enticing
array of gourmet cheese, cucum
ber salad, fresh bread and enough
white wine to take care of his
group of 17, plus any friends who
may drop by. His wife laughs and
says she's the one to interview,
because the "true story here
should be all the work" she and
her friends have put in over the
years in preparation for these par
ties.
Her favorite tailgate party she
recalls in vivid detail.
"We refer to it as the Marakesh
day," she said. The women in
charge of "catering" these parties
brought big screens, a huge orien
tal rug, throw pillows and enough
"finger food" to feed the hungry
crowd a Moroccan feast not to be
forgotten. "We sat behind these
screens and really did it up. You
never would have known we were
at a football game."
The Fenwick's son, Darryl,
proudly carries on the family tra
dition. "I graduated (from Stan
ford) in 1987," he said. "As far as I
know, I was conceived after one of
these things."
Motioning to the group, a
friend of the Fenwicks' points out,

"We're all 'double-E's' from Stan
ford. You might say we're the
nerds of this crowd, but we sure
have a good time." As he says this
a chorus of voices agree.
The "double-E's," a self
appointed nickname for electrical
engineering majors, are not your
typical "nerds." One showed off
the Ferrari he had driven up in
that day Stanford red, of
course.
Laughingly, the group remi
nisced about the year it rained so
hard they were forced to huddle
under the food table for shelter.
They wouldn't think of leaving
early.
At gatherings across the grove,
barbecues and beach chairs
emerge from suburban station
wagons and sedans. The smell of
grilled burgers masks the once
prevalent lemon scent of eucalyp
tus leaves. Card tables spread
with salads made with specialty
items such as bow-tie pasta, red
potatoes and green leafy lettuce
accompany what's on the grill.
"We're over here." One family
waves to another couple they had
arranged to meet. "Make yourself
at home. There's beer and sodas
in the cooler."
Even on other Saturdays, the
Big Game dominates conversa

tion. "I've only missed one Big
Game since I started at Stanford
in 1970 when my oldest daugh
ter Laurie was born," Matt James,
a San Francisco businessman
said. "After that we tried to time
our kids a little better," he added
with a smile.
While the more urban Berkeley
campus has traditions which dif
fer, the motivations of the faithful
students and alumni remain the
same. Fraternity houses replace
the lavish motor homes which
host Stanford parties. Lawns and
groves are replaced by crowded
streets teeming with excited fans.
But the draw toward the game
and the escape and enjoyment it
provides is the same. Friends
return to find friends and comfort
is found in familiarity. Rooting
against the "team from across the
Bay" unites people like few things
in life can.
"I come to be with my friends,"
a man said at a recent Stanford
game. "This place I know. And
that's comfortable. No matter
what happens, I look forward to
coming back here."
He was just one person, but he
captures the spirit that will bring
thousands back to the Big Game.

hard they were forced to huddle

They wouldn't think of leaving
early.
At gatherings across the grove,
barbecues and beach chairs
emerge from suburban station
wagons and sedans. The smell of
grilled burgers masks the once
prevalent lemon scent of eucalyp

with salads made with specialty
items such as bow-tie pasta, red
potatoes and green leafy lettuce
accompany what's on the grill.
"We're over here." One family
waves to another couple they had
arranged to meet. "Make yourself
at home. There's beer and sodas
in the cooler."
Even on other Saturdays, the
Big Game dominates conversa

tion. "I've only missed one Big
Game since I started at Stanford
in 1970 when my oldest daugh

While the more urban Berkeley
campus has traditions which dif

students and alumni remain the
same. Fraternity houses replace
the lavish motor homes which
host Stanford parties. Lawns and
groves are replaced by crowded
streets teeming with excited fans.
But the draw toward the game
and the escape and enjoyment it
provides is the same. Friends
return to find friends and comfort
is found in familiarity. Rooting
against the "team from across the
Bay" unites people like few things

"I come to be with my friends,"
a man said at a recent Stanford
game. "This place I know. And
that's comfortable. No matter
what happens, I look forward to
coming back here."
He was just one person, but he
captures the spirit that will bring
thousands back to the Big Game.
Cars flood the campus. Horns
honk. Ticket scalpers vie for
attention. Shouting and laughing
voices pierce the air.
Once again the young and the
old alike have come to take part in
one of Stanford's most celebrated
traditions, the Big Game.
While the Big Game is obvi
ously about football, it's also
about old friends, sunny Satur
days and great parties tail
gaters as they are commonly
called. This year the Big Game
will be held at Berkeley, and many
Stanford fans will miss being
down on the Farm.
What is it that draws people to
the familiar haunts of the Farm
and the Big Game? It may be tra
dition that brings people back
year after year. A sense of security
and continuity can be found in a
scene that replays itself with
uncanny similarity Saturday upon
Saturday.
It is a pastime enjoyed by Stan
ford alumni and passed on to their
children and to their children's
children. It may also be about
shared values and a common rival.
The Big Game unites us.
"We've been coming here
together for 20 some odd years,"

Robert Fenwick, a Stanford grad
uate from the class of 1962, said.
It is a game day earlier this year,
and he stands before an enticing
array of gourmet cheese, cucum
ber salad, fresh bread and enough
white wine to take care of his
group of 17, plus any friends who
may drop by. His wife laughs and
says she's the one to interview,
because the "true story here
should be all the work" she and
her friends have put in over the
years in preparation for these par
ties.
Her favorite tailgate party she
recalls in vivid detail.
"We refer to it as the Marakesh
day," she said. The women in
charge of "catering" these parties
brought big screens, a huge orien
tal rug, throw pillows and enough
"finger food" to feed the hungry
crowd a Moroccan feast not to be
forgotten. "We sat behind these
screens and really did it up. You
never would have known we were
at a football game."
The Fenwick's son, Darryl,
proudly carries on the family tra
dition. "I graduated (from Stan
ford) in 1987," he said. "As far as I
know, I was conceived after one of
these things."
Motioning to the group, a
friend of the Fenwicks' points out,

"We're all 'double-E's' from Stan
ford. You might say we're the
nerds of this crowd, but we sure
have a good time." As he says this
a chorus of voices agree.
The "double-E's," a self
appointed nickname for electrical
engineering majors, are not your
typical "nerds." One showed off
the Ferrari he had driven up in
that day Stanford red, of
course.
