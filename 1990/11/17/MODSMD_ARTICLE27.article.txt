# An annual tradition for dedicated alumni
## 
### Catherine Lewis 
For current students at Stan
ford and California the Big Game
is the here and now. "Will we win
on this Saturday?" remains the
most prominent question on
everyone's mind. But what actu
ally makes the Big Game so mon
umental is the tradition which
embraces it.
Since 1892, Stanford and Cal
teams, coaches and fans have been
traveling across the Bay for the
most important - and emotional -
game of the season.
Lloyd McGovern, a Stanford
graduate in the class of 1947, is a
Cardinal fan and football histo
rian of long-standing. Along with
his love for the game, he has a
one-of-a-kind collection which
includes every Big Game program
since 1893. He remembers his
first Big Game and learning about
the intense rivalry quite clearly.
"It was 1933 and I was 11 years
old," McGovern said. "My uncle,
who was a doctor and Cal grad,
took me to the game. We were sit
ting in the Cal section, and when
Stanford scored a touchdown, I
jumped up and yelled. Someone
told my uncle to 'Shut that kid

up.' They weren't too happy with
me in that section."
McGovern has gone to every
Big Game since, continuing to
root for Stanford.
Harry Agler, a Berkeley gradu
ate in the class of 1948, also has
long ties to the Stanford—Cal
rivalry. Agler knows the Big Game
from both sides, as a player and a
fan. Through the years he has
stayed a strong Cal supporter and
was recently president of the Cali
fornia Bear Backers Association.
"My favorite game," recalls
Agler with obvious pleasure, "was
the Big Game of 1947. It was
coach Pappy Waldorf s first year.
Cal had only lost one game and
Stanford had only won one... We
were a 35 point favorite."
But as the years have proven,
in the Big Game point spreads
mean little.
"With 2 minutes to play Stan
ford was ahead 18-14," Agler said.
"Then in the final moments we
threw a long touchdown pass to
win the game."
Agler, who was Cal's team cap
tain at the time, has a surprising
reason for calling this his favorite
game.
"Stanford was the better team

during that game. And I've always
had the most admiration for those
players," he said. Of course, Cal
did win the game.
Many fans seem to find victory
the sweetest when the game is
close. McGovern's favorite game
has a similar story, but a different
victor of course, Stanford.
"It was 1974 and Stanford was
behind early in the game 10-13,"
McGovern remembers. "Finally,
we went ahead 19-13 in the fourth
quarter. Then, led by Steve
Bartkowski, Cal came back to lead
it by 20-19 with only 23 seconds
left.
"Stanford took the ball and
with four seconds to go set the
stage for a fifty yard field goal by
Mike Langford to win the game
22-20," McGovern recalls with
great fondness. Langford, McGov
ern notes, did not kick "like those
soccer kickers of today, but right
straight through those goal
posts."
McGovern like Agler seems to
revel in the heated competitive
ness of a good rivalry.
Pundits, point spreads and
even coaches have a hard time
predicting winners of the Big
Game. In fact, McGovern pointed
out that only 40 percent of pre
dicted Big Game favorites win as
compared to 70 to 80 percent of
favorites in other games.
Given this, Agler and McGov
ern still have their favorites and
thoughts on what it will take to
win this year's big game. Agler, as
you might guess, predicts a win
for Cal, and thinks that the most
important factors in the game are
the constants which influence the

game year after year.
"The players must concentrate
on the fact that this is the last
game. They've got to be fired up,"
Agler said. "After this there will be
no more practice films, no more
training. They have got to adopt
the motto 'We will not be denied.'"
McGovern also talked about
the emotional adrenalin needed to
win the game.
"The other things I think are
important are that we can't make
mistakes. We've got to watch for
the gadget plays," he said. "Both
coaches in the Big Game try tricky
plays that they don't use during
the rest of the season."
McGovern also stressed the
need to be alert. "In a game like
this," he said, "one play can turn
it around." He predicts a Stanford
victory.
A Stanford football historian as
well as faithful fan, McGovern
knows many interesting statistics
about the Big Game. As the last
game of the season, graduating
seniors want to go out with a
resounding victory.
However, some of the greatest
quarterbacks of both teams have
ended their college years with
embarrassing defeats in the Big
Game. McGovern calls it the
"graveyard of great quarter
backs." The Big Game graveyard
includes: Jim Plunkett (1970),
John Elway (1982), Steve
Bartkowski (1974), Frankie
Albert (1941), Gary Kerkorian
(1951), John Paye (1986) arid
Troy Taylor (1989).
Both Agler and McGovern say
that during the years they have
been going to the Big Games, little

has changed. Both teams have had
their slumps, and often at the
same time. Yet, no matter what
the preceding season was like, the
Big Game venue was overflowing
with fans, and the rivaliy never
waned.
"In 1960, Stanford was win
less. Cal had one win. Yet, 76,000
people packed Memorial Sta
dium," McGovern said.
While it is easy to sense the
excitement that emanates from
close, hard-fought victories, it has
been 55 years since the outcome of
a Big Game made the difference in
sending either team to the Rose
Bowl. Outside observers might
well wonder what drives the
rivalry between two teams when
the final score often determines
little.
"How else can you say it?"
McGovern said. "This is about
tradition. This is really a social
and traditional classic. I think
there is no other rivalry in the
country like it. It's about emotion,
and when it's over you'll remem
ber it for the rest of your life."
Agler echoed almost the exact
same sentiments. "It's the last
game and you go all out. You do
things you wouldn't have done
before. These people are your
friends, and you know you will
hear about this for the rest of your
life."
"The Axe is sort of a silly sym
bol," said McGovern. "But only
one person goes home with it. You
either have it or you don't."
"Very few neutral people go to
the Big Game. You're either for
the red or the blue."

"It was 1974 and Stanford was
behind early in the game 10-13,"
McGovern remembers. "Finally,
we went ahead 19-13 in the fourth
quarter. Then, led by Steve
Bartkowski, Cal came back to lead
it by 20-19 with only 23 seconds
left.
"Stanford took the ball and
with four seconds to go set the
stage for a fifty yard field goal by
Mike Langford to win the game
22-20," McGovern recalls with
great fondness. Langford, McGov
ern notes, did not kick "like those
soccer kickers of today, but right
straight through those goal
posts."
McGovern like Agler seems to
revel in the heated competitive
ness of a good rivalry.
Pundits, point spreads and
even coaches have a hard time
predicting winners of the Big
Game. In fact, McGovern pointed
out that only 40 percent of pre
dicted Big Game favorites win as
compared to 70 to 80 percent of
favorites in other games.
Given this, Agler and McGov
ern still have their favorites and
thoughts on what it will take to
win this year's big game. Agler, as
you might guess, predicts a win
for Cal, and thinks that the most
important factors in the game are
the constants which influence the

game year after year.
"The players must concentrate
on the fact that this is the last
game. They've got to be fired up,"
Agler said. "After this there will be
no more practice films, no more
training. They have got to adopt
the motto 'We will not be denied.'"
McGovern also talked about
the emotional adrenalin needed to
win the game.
"The other things I think are
important are that we can't make
mistakes. We've got to watch for
the gadget plays," he said. "Both
coaches in the Big Game try tricky
plays that they don't use during
the rest of the season."
McGovern also stressed the
need to be alert. "In a game like
this," he said, "one play can turn
it around." He predicts a Stanford
victory.
A Stanford football historian as
well as faithful fan, McGovern
knows many interesting statistics
about the Big Game. As the last
game of the season, graduating
seniors want to go out with a
resounding victory.
However, some of the greatest
quarterbacks of both teams have
ended their college years with
embarrassing defeats in the Big
Game. McGovern calls it the
"graveyard of great quarter
backs." The Big Game graveyard
includes: Jim Plunkett (1970),
John Elway (1982), Steve
Bartkowski (1974), Frankie
Albert (1941), Gary Kerkorian
(1951), John Paye (1986) arid
Troy Taylor (1989).
Both Agler and McGovern say
that during the years they have
been going to the Big Games, little

has changed. Both teams have had
their slumps, and often at the
same time. Yet, no matter what
the preceding season was like, the
Big Game venue was overflowing
with fans, and the rivaliy never
waned.
"In 1960, Stanford was win
less. Cal had one win. Yet, 76,000
people packed Memorial Sta
dium," McGovern said.
While it is easy to sense the
excitement that emanates from
close, hard-fought victories, it has
been 55 years since the outcome of
a Big Game made the difference in
sending either team to the Rose
Bowl. Outside observers might
well wonder what drives the
rivalry between two teams when
the final score often determines
little.
"How else can you say it?"
McGovern said. "This is about
tradition. This is really a social
and traditional classic. I think
there is no other rivalry in the
country like it. It's about emotion,
and when it's over you'll remem
ber it for the rest of your life."
Agler echoed almost the exact
same sentiments. "It's the last
game and you go all out. You do
things you wouldn't have done
before. These people are your
friends, and you know you will
hear about this for the rest of your
life."
"The Axe is sort of a silly sym
bol," said McGovern. "But only
one person goes home with it. You
either have it or you don't."
"Very few neutral people go to
the Big Game. You're either for
the red or the blue."
For current students at Stan
ford and California the Big Game
is the here and now. "Will we win
on this Saturday?" remains the
most prominent question on
everyone's mind. But what actu
ally makes the Big Game so mon
umental is the tradition which
embraces it.
Since 1892, Stanford and Cal
teams, coaches and fans have been
traveling across the Bay for the
most important - and emotional -
game of the season.
Lloyd McGovern, a Stanford
graduate in the class of 1947, is a
Cardinal fan and football histo
rian of long-standing. Along with
his love for the game, he has a
one-of-a-kind collection which
includes every Big Game program
since 1893. He remembers his
first Big Game and learning about
the intense rivalry quite clearly.
"It was 1933 and I was 11 years
old," McGovern said. "My uncle,
who was a doctor and Cal grad,
took me to the game. We were sit
ting in the Cal section, and when
Stanford scored a touchdown, I
jumped up and yelled. Someone
told my uncle to 'Shut that kid

up.' They weren't too happy with
me in that section."
McGovern has gone to every
Big Game since, continuing to
root for Stanford.
Harry Agler, a Berkeley gradu
ate in the class of 1948, also has
long ties to the Stanford—Cal
rivalry. Agler knows the Big Game
from both sides, as a player and a
fan. Through the years he has
stayed a strong Cal supporter and
was recently president of the Cali
fornia Bear Backers Association.
"My favorite game," recalls
Agler with obvious pleasure, "was
the Big Game of 1947. It was
coach Pappy Waldorf s first year.
Cal had only lost one game and
Stanford had only won one... We
were a 35 point favorite."
But as the years have proven,
in the Big Game point spreads
mean little.
"With 2 minutes to play Stan
ford was ahead 18-14," Agler said.
"Then in the final moments we
threw a long touchdown pass to
win the game."
Agler, who was Cal's team cap
tain at the time, has a surprising
reason for calling this his favorite
game.
"Stanford was the better team

during that game. And I've always
had the most admiration for those
players," he said. Of course, Cal
did win the game.
Many fans seem to find victory
the sweetest when the game is
close. McGovern's favorite game
has a similar story, but a different
victor of course, Stanford.
"It was 1974 and Stanford was
