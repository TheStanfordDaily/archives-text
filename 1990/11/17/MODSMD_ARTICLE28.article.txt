# Huskies end scrappy season on top of pile
## 
### Janet Feldstein 
The season is over for the
Pacific 10 Conference, and for
coaches and players at many of
the conference schools, this
Wednesday will be a day of much
Thanksgiving.
Five schools hold tied or win
ning records for the season; these
records have translated into tick
ets to bowl games for the likes of
USC, Arizona, California, and, of
course, Washington.
Within the conference, Wash
ington has emerged as the leader
of the Pac. Led by coach Don
James, the winningest coach in
conference history, the Huskies
now have a 7-1 record within the
Pac-10.
"Washington will be the team
which carries the banner for [the
Pac-10]," Stanford coach Denny
Green had said earlier in the sea
son, and he was right; undefeated
until last week's loss to UCLA,
the Huskies will be smelling roses
Jan. 1 as they head off to
Pasadena to wrangle with antici
pated opponent lowa.
In September, Washington
defensive tackle Tyrone Rodgers
predicted their coming success.
"We're shooting for the Roses,
then the next thing is the national
championship . . . The sky's our
limit."
That dream of a national cham
pionship may have fizzled after
last week's loss to UCLA, but the
Huskies are still happy they are
not suffering through the same
season as Oregon State, whose
limits have been much closer to
earth. The Beavers boast only one
win, and five in-conference losses
(nine overall). OSU's solitary vic
tory came against Arizona mid
way through the season, followed
by four disappointing losses.
Oregon State has some hope of
redemption in their final game
against Oregon; most of the
Ducks' wins have come from out
of the conference.
Oregon's impressive record is

another example of the successful
schools in the Pac-10 conference,
although the Ducks expected an
even better season. In October, a
Pac-10 spokesman predicted Ore
gon could have a 9-2 season, and
perhaps head to a bowl game.
Matt Marson, managing editor of
"Football News," predicted Ore
gon would bring home a Copper
Bowl trophy, but it appears the
Ducks are heading for the Free
dom Bowl.
It appears instead that Califor
nia will be headed for the Copper
Bowl, a reflection of their impres
sive 6-3-1 record (4-2-1 in the Pac
-10). California's four-game win
ning streak was broken by the
Huskies, but the Golden Bears
brought themselves back up to tie
USC and defeat Oregon.
Today's game against Stanford
presents another hurdle, magni
fied by the traditional rivalry
between the teams.
While Stanford's losing record
(3-4 in the Pac-10) reflects a disap
pointing season, the team has had
several well-deserved victories
which show the Cardinal's poten
tial and ability. Victories over
Notre Dame and Arizona are only
the tip of the iceberg. In early sea
son games against Colorado and
UCLA, Stanford was a combined
13 seconds and five points away
from beginning the season 2-0.
- The Cardinal boasts many star
players who brought the team
praise and recognition, despite the
overall record. "Stanford is a
much improved football team,"
Oregon State coach Dave Kragth
orpe said. "The addition of Glyn
Milburn in the backfield makes
Stanford much stronger."
USC is one team which was
able to shut down Milburn. The
Trojan rush defense was a key to
USC's 37-22 thrashing of the Car
dinal. In fact, USC boasts an
impressive seven victories (four in
the conference) and has lost only
two games and tied once.
The three-time defending Pac
-10 champion team is tied for third

with California but is not living up
to high expectations built up early
in the season. Hopes of a Rose
Bowl trip were dashed by several
midseason losses, including one
loss to Arizona which broke an
home winning streak of 11 games.
Arizona is another team whose
record is hardly indicative of its
power and potential. The Wild
cats' four losses were all within

the conference, and came after a
winning streak of the first three
games.
"Arizona is a great football
team, an outstanding defense and
has tremendous team speed.
They do a great job taking the ball
away, sacking the quarterback as
well as interceptions," Oregon
coach Rich Brooks said.
Unfortunately, after being the

only team to lose to the Beavers
this season, the bruised egos of
the Wildcats will have to mend
themselves in the Aloha Bowl
rather than the Rose.
For the Rose Bowl and all its
trappings belong to Washington,
and hopefully, come New Years
Day, the Huskies will bring glory
to the Pac-10 by feasting on
Hawkeye.

brought themselves back up to tie
USC and defeat Oregon.
Today's game against Stanford
presents another hurdle, magni
fied by the traditional rivalry
between the teams.
While Stanford's losing record
(3-4 in the Pac-10) reflects a disap
pointing season, the team has had
several well-deserved victories
which show the Cardinal's poten
tial and ability. Victories over
Notre Dame and Arizona are only
the tip of the iceberg. In early sea
son games against Colorado and
UCLA, Stanford was a combined
13 seconds and five points away
from beginning the season 2-0.
- The Cardinal boasts many star
players who brought the team
praise and recognition, despite the
overall record. "Stanford is a
much improved football team,"
Oregon State coach Dave Kragth
orpe said. "The addition of Glyn
Milburn in the backfield makes
Stanford much stronger."
USC is one team which was
able to shut down Milburn. The
Trojan rush defense was a key to
USC's 37-22 thrashing of the Car
dinal. In fact, USC boasts an
impressive seven victories (four in
the conference) and has lost only
two games and tied once.
The three-time defending Pac
-10 champion team is tied for third

with California but is not living up
to high expectations built up early
in the season. Hopes of a Rose
Bowl trip were dashed by several
midseason losses, including one
loss to Arizona which broke an
home winning streak of 11 games.
Arizona is another team whose
record is hardly indicative of its
power and potential. The Wild
cats' four losses were all within

the conference, and came after a
winning streak of the first three
games.
"Arizona is a great football
team, an outstanding defense and
has tremendous team speed.
They do a great job taking the ball
away, sacking the quarterback as
well as interceptions," Oregon
coach Rich Brooks said.
Unfortunately, after being the

only team to lose to the Beavers
this season, the bruised egos of
the Wildcats will have to mend
themselves in the Aloha Bowl
rather than the Rose.
For the Rose Bowl and all its
trappings belong to Washington,
and hopefully, come New Years
Day, the Huskies will bring glory
to the Pac-10 by feasting on
Hawkeye.

The season is over for the
Pacific 10 Conference, and for
coaches and players at many of
the conference schools, this
Wednesday will be a day of much
Thanksgiving.
Five schools hold tied or win
ning records for the season; these
records have translated into tick
ets to bowl games for the likes of
USC, Arizona, California, and, of
course, Washington.
Within the conference, Wash
ington has emerged as the leader
of the Pac. Led by coach Don
James, the winningest coach in
conference history, the Huskies
now have a 7-1 record within the
Pac-10.
"Washington will be the team
which carries the banner for [the
Pac-10]," Stanford coach Denny
Green had said earlier in the sea
son, and he was right; undefeated
until last week's loss to UCLA,
the Huskies will be smelling roses
Jan. 1 as they head off to
Pasadena to wrangle with antici
pated opponent lowa.
In September, Washington
defensive tackle Tyrone Rodgers
predicted their coming success.
"We're shooting for the Roses,
then the next thing is the national
championship . . . The sky's our
limit."
That dream of a national cham
pionship may have fizzled after
last week's loss to UCLA, but the
Huskies are still happy they are
not suffering through the same
season as Oregon State, whose
limits have been much closer to
earth. The Beavers boast only one
win, and five in-conference losses
(nine overall). OSU's solitary vic
tory came against Arizona mid
way through the season, followed
by four disappointing losses.
Oregon State has some hope of
redemption in their final game
against Oregon; most of the
Ducks' wins have come from out
of the conference.
Oregon's impressive record is

another example of the successful
schools in the Pac-10 conference,
although the Ducks expected an
even better season. In October, a
Pac-10 spokesman predicted Ore
gon could have a 9-2 season, and
perhaps head to a bowl game.
Matt Marson, managing editor of
"Football News," predicted Ore
gon would bring home a Copper
Bowl trophy, but it appears the
Ducks are heading for the Free
dom Bowl.
It appears instead that Califor
nia will be headed for the Copper
Bowl, a reflection of their impres
sive 6-3-1 record (4-2-1 in the Pac
-10). California's four-game win
ning streak was broken by the
Huskies, but the Golden Bears
brought themselves back up to tie
USC and defeat Oregon.
