# An entire season on the line

### Kevin Jeffery 
Six regular season victories, a
long-awaited bid to the Copper
Bowl, a guaranteed winning sea
son for the first time in eight
years.
Throw it out the window.
A down-to-the-wire struggle
with No. 2 Colorado. An historic
victory over top-ranked Notre
Dame. A chance for three straight
season-ending conference victo
ries.
Forget about it.
The Stanford Cardinal and Cal
ifornia Golden Bears battle for the
Axe for the 93rd time today in the
Pacific 10 Conference's oldest
rivalry the Big Game.
And when Big Game week rolls
around, you get the strange feel
ing that the previous two months
really did not matter that much.
Stanford coach Denny Green
said, "Anything that's taken place
up to now is insignificant. This is
an exciting game full of tradition
... you'll see some hungry players
and hungry coaches who all want
a piece of that tradition."
Cal coach Bruce Snyder was
not short on superlatives, either.
"This is definitely the best game
I've coached in, in terms of tradi
tion, and each year it seems to be
getting bigger and bigger," he
said. "I've always felt it was a
game made for heroes."
The Cardinal has had a few
more of those heroes in recent Big
Games, as Cal has been able to
muster only one win in the past
six years. The Golden Bears upset
a heavily favored Stanford team,
17-11, in 1986, and the 1988 Big
Game ended in a 19-19 tie as Stan
ford safety Tuan van Le blocked a
20-yard field goal attempt as time
expired.
Jono Tunney extolled the
importance of the Big Game, and
its impact on the players.
"We always look forward to
playing Cal because it's at the end
of the season and you can let
everything go," Tunney said.

"The emotion involved in the
game makes up for a lot of physi
cal limitations, and you'll see a lot
of people playing over their
heads."
Senior guard Chuck Gilling
ham added his personal perspec
tive on Big Game excitement as he
reflected on last year's match-up
and said, "Any time your hear
Stanford Stadium get loud, you
know it must be something big."
The Cardinal will face the Pac
10's top backfield tandem in
senior Anthony Wallace (90.3
yards per game) and sophomore
Russell White (82.3). The two Cal
tailbacks have the chance to
become the first duo of teammates
in conference history to each rush
for 1,000 yards in the same sea
son.
Tunney acknowledged the
threat that the pair of explosive
backs poses. "We could stop one of
them for a few downs, but they
just send another back of equal
talent out there to pound you."
Still the Stanford defense has
proved they are up to the task. In
the past two weeks, against Wash
ington State and Arizona, the Car
dinal has allowed just 93 yards per
game and only 2.6 per rush.
Snyder said the matchup of the
Cal rushing attack (averaging 197
yards) versus the Stanford run
defense should be one of the keys
to the game. Washington effec
tively shut down Cal's running
game two weeks ago allowing
them only 134 yards and blew
out the Bears, 46-7.
"There's just a mental thing
about being stopped on the run
that brings us down," Snyder
said.
"You can't underestimate the
effects of (flat out) stopping peo
ple," Green added. "It relieves the
pressure on our offense and gives
us lot more flexibility in play-call
â€¢ n
mg.
Cal will hope to control a
newly-balanced, potent Stanford
offensive attack, coming off its
most impressive rushing perfor

mance of the year last week
against Arizona.
The Cardinal gained 244 yards
on the ground in Tuscon, led by
sophomore halfback Glyn Mil
burn's career-best 142 yards for
7.1 yards per carry. Arizona coach
Dick Tomey called Milburn, "the
single biggest threat in the whole
league" after his dominating per
formance.
Senior fullback Tommy Vardell
added 80 yards and two touch
downs, which gave him 14 for the
season and vaulted him past Brad
Muster (12 TDs in 1986) for the
Stanford single-season touch
down record. Vardell also leads the
Pac-10 in scoring with 84 points.
Jason Palumbis, who Green
says is quarterbacking "better
than anyone in the conference
right now," is the conference's
top-rated passer, and will look to
exploit Cal's ninth-ranked defense
(allowing 421.3 yards per game).
Senior wide receiver Ed McCaf
frey will hope to enhance his All-
America candidacy in the final
game of his illustrious career.
Palumbis' favorite target enters
the game ranked fifth in the
nation in both receptions and
yards per game.
Green sees the Big Game as

'Anything that's taken
place up to now is
insignificant. This is
an exciting game that
is full of tradition...
you'll see some hun
gry players and hun
gry coaches who all
want a piece of that
tradition.'

After back-to-back victories over WSU and Arizona, the Cardinal do
have reason to celebrate. The Arizona game saw the long-awaited
return of the Cardinal rushing attack,
one that could add a positive label
to this inconsistent Stanford sea
son.
"If we win we can look at our
team as one that closed fast and
steadily improved," he said.
"That could give us a lot of con
fidence going into next season."
Snyder and the Bears won't be
looking forward to next season
quite yet. They have a date to play
in the Copper Bowl in Tucson,
Ariz. The decision to play and the
surrounding Martin Luther King
Jr. Day controversy has, Snyder
admitted, resulted in a lot of activ
ity on the campus surrounding
the team. But he said his team
planned to "be focused and
wanted to put on a show."
The 93rd Big Game should be
an explosive, exciting show if
recent history is any indicator.
"Playing in the Big Game is
like another world." Le said.
"You're playing for the hometown
bragging rights, you can't imagine
the feeling of the Big Game if
you've never been a part of it."
Maybe Gillingham summed up
the emotions of Big Game best.
"If you can't get emotional,
excited, and ready to play for the
Big Game," he said, "you
shouldn't be playing football."
