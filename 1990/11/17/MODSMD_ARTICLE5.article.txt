# Bear's Bowl
## 
### T. C. Hall Editorial staff 
It appears that Stanford must finally
face the worst truth of this entire crazy
season.
(Choke) California is going to a bowl
game (end-choke).
It's not official until Nov. 24, but after
the Bears forgot that they were sup
posed to collapse in the second half of
their schedule and wound up tying USC

and beating Oregon, it seems that the
boys in blue and gold are heading south
to play Wyoming in the Copper Bowl.
Nutty as it may be, the Bears are 6-3-
1 and the people from the historically
perplexed state of Arizona want Califor
nia to be a part of the New Year's Day
festivities. Arizonians showed they may
not know what constitutes a great man,
but the Copper (which is played in Tus
con) is hoping they know what makes a
great football team for their second-year
bowl.
Don Severe thinks that Cal is a good
bet, and he should know. Being a mem
ber of the selection committee, Severe
does not think a decision to invite Cal is
as harsh as his name.
"They're a Pac-10 team and we're in a
Pac-10 city," Severe said. "They're an
explosive team that can beat anybody on
any given day and they're a team that
travels well."
With a 3-2 road record this year, Cali
fornia does indeed travel well, but a
strange question has surfaced: Will they

travel to Tucson? The Copper bowl is
guaranteed to pay at least $600,000 to
the teams competing, but the decision to
play will involve a larger issue than
money.
Long the bastion of all that is liberal,
the University of California-Berkeley
may once again be faced with huge polit
ical controversy. The 1960s saw the Cal
campus awash with students angry over
involvement with communists in the
jungle; the '9os may bring the same kind
of anger over racists in the desert.
That problem arises from the political
and social faux pas that the Arizona vot
ers committed when they shot down a
proposal to honor Martin Luther King
Jr.'s birthday as a paid holiday. The
national can of worms that Arizonians
opened on themselves has brought about
socio-athletic controversy a la Shoal
Creek.
For Cal, playing in the Copper Bowl is
not as easy as saying yes.
"Why," questions noted activist (and
sports sociologist) Harry Edwards,
"wander into a fog-shrouded political
mine field if you don't have to do it?
"You can go play in the game if you
want, but at what price? How can you
ask a 19-year-old kid to cross an angry
picket line of black folks or white folks
for the purpose of earning a bowl pay
check for the school? How can you put a
kid in that position? You would have to
be a mental munchkin to do that."
Yet at the risk of appearing a cerebral
shorty to Edwards, the truth is that the
issue is actually not so cut and dried.
Sure Cal will get a considerable pay
check, but most of it will go to cover
expenses, and do not forget that the Pac
-10 gets a cut as well. No, the issue here
is a little larger, and definitely more
vague.
"Martin Luther King had a dream,"
Cal receiver Brian Treggs said, "and I
have a dream: to play in a bowl game."
