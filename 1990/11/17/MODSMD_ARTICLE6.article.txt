# Farm Odors
## 
### Michael Clayton Editorial staff 
When students returned to Stanford
this fall, they found a Farm that had
developed a rather unpleasant odor.
In two separate meetings, the Depart
ment of Athletics decided (1) to break
tradition by charging students for atten
dance at all varsity sports events, and (2)
to formalize an unspoken and confused
tradition allowing varsity athletes to
attend all varsity sports for free.

With these two decisions, the depart
ment has upset the fragile balance
between sports and study that the Uni
versity has taken so much pride in devel
oping. Instead of including athletic
achievement as one in a long list of out
standing extracurricular activities, the
department has taken it upon itself to
hammer in a privileged second tier a
division which turns the varsity athlete
at Stanford University into a Stanford
varsity athlete.
Why make such a big deal out of such
an insignificant change? Tickets to a vol
leyball game, a soccer game or a water
polo match are only two meager dollars
much less than paying to be enter
tained at the movie theater; who is going
to be hurt by losing a couple of bucks
each week? Will the smaller sports really
lose the dedicated fans or will the atten
dance charge for "students" just add a
little more cash to the Athletic Depart
ment's drained account?
According to Acting Athletic Director
Alan Cummings, the decision to charge

students for all events was a strictly
financial decision. The department
receives no money from the University's
student fees and, in order to maintain
the broad-based varsity sports program,
the department's cabinet decided to
charge students as one part within the
total plan to increase revenue.
At the second meeting, the cabinet
decided that it needed to standardize its
policy regarding the attendance of var
sity athletes at sporting events in which
they were not competing. Under NCAA
rules, varsity athletes cannot receive
hard tickets but can enter events
through a gate list.
Stanford has, in the past, allowed ath
letes to enter into events free, but the
procedure had not been formalized.
According to Cummings, this NCAA pro
cedure allows Stanford to grant privi
leges to its "student-athletes."
The time and effort that these ath
letes contribute to perfecting their per
formance is indisputably impressive.
The time dedicated to sport undeniably
cuts back on the ability of the non-schol
arship athletes to earn money through
part-time jobs in order to meet the
demanding financial requirements of
college.
Still, to suggest that the non-varsity
rugby player but not the varsity rower
need to pay in order to maintain the
broad athletic opportunities is absurd.
No one debates the fantastic value
that the breadth of the sports program
offers to every Stanford student. Fresh
man walk onto the Farm and have their
eyes opened by a dormmate playing a
sport that they had never even dreamed
about. Students, in the past, and ath
letes, in the present, could see their
friends playing in a water polo game, a
soccer game and a field hockey game all
in one afternoon without feeling guilty
about their wallets growing thin.
