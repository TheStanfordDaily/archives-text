# Farm Odors
## 
### Michael Clayton Editorial staff 
When students returned to Stanford
this fall, they found a Farm that had
developed a rather unpleasant odor.
In two separate meetings, the Depart
ment of Athletics decided (1) to break
tradition by charging students for atten
dance at all varsity sports events, and (2)
to formalize an unspoken and confused
tradition allowing varsity athletes to
attend all varsity sports for free.

With these two decisions, the depart
ment has upset the fragile balance
between sports and study that the Uni
versity has taken so much pride in devel
oping. Instead of including athletic
achievement as one in a long list of out
standing extracurricular activities, the
department has taken it upon itself to
hammer in a privileged second tier a
division which turns the varsity athlete
at Stanford University into a Stanford
varsity athlete.
Why make such a big deal out of such
an insignificant change? Tickets to a vol
leyball game, a soccer game or a water
polo match are only two meager dollars
much less than paying to be enter
tained at the movie theater; who is going
to be hurt by losing a couple of bucks
each week? Will the smaller sports really
lose the dedicated fans or will the atten
dance charge for "students" just add a
little more cash to the Athletic Depart
ment's drained account?
According to Acting Athletic Director
Alan Cummings, the decision to charge

students for all events was a strictly
financial decision. The department
receives no money from the University's
student fees and, in order to maintain
the broad-based varsity sports program,
the department's cabinet decided to
charge students as one part within the
total plan to increase revenue.
At the second meeting, the cabinet
decided that it needed to standardize its
policy regarding the attendance of var
sity athletes at sporting events in which
they were not competing. Under NCAA
rules, varsity athletes cannot receive
hard tickets but can enter events
through a gate list.
Stanford has, in the past, allowed ath
letes to enter into events free, but the
procedure had not been formalized.
According to Cummings, this NCAA pro
cedure allows Stanford to grant privi
leges to its "student-athletes."
The time and effort that these ath
letes contribute to perfecting their per
formance is indisputably impressive.
The time dedicated to sport undeniably
cuts back on the ability of the non-schol
arship athletes to earn money through
part-time jobs in order to meet the
demanding financial requirements of
college.
Still, to suggest that the non-varsity
rugby player but not the varsity rower
need to pay in order to maintain the
broad athletic opportunities is absurd.
No one debates the fantastic value
that the breadth of the sports program
offers to every Stanford student. Fresh
man walk onto the Farm and have their
eyes opened by a dormmate playing a
sport that they had never even dreamed
about. Students, in the past, and ath
letes, in the present, could see their
friends playing in a water polo game, a
soccer game and a field hockey game all
in one afternoon without feeling guilty
about their wallets growing thin.

In addition, the athlete who
excels in an unrecognized sport
could come to Stanford and prac
tice with Olympic-caliber coaches
and athletes.
But when faced with financial
difficulties, the department deter
mined to ask students but not the
athletes who receive the most
direct benefits from the strong
programs to pay to supplement
the athletic opportunities. The
department determined that the
Stanford student must finance
the facilities of the Stanford ath
lete.
The department could not
offer a more rational reason for
enabling varsity athletes free
admission than to comment that
the student-athletes "are easily
identifiable off of team rosters." A
more reasonable explanation
would be that the department
would like to extend privileges
granted by the NCAA to Stanford
athletes as a perk to the athletes
for their dedication and hard
work within the program.
In reality, most students can
find away to fork out the extra
forty-three dollars needed to buy
an all-sports pass and to support
Stanford athletics.

However, the privileged
exemption of athletes underlines
the most appalling point of the
entire discussion: The distinction
has violated the sacred principle
that a Stanford student, whether
a varsity athlete or a measly con
cert violinist, is first and foremost
a student and Stanford students
are treated equally by the Univer
sity.
The Farm must find away to
eliminate this stench.
Money speaks loudly in the
Department of Athletics, and one
solution is to make all of the ath
letes cough up some cash.
More effectively, the depart
ment must look at their ill-con
ceived approach towards the stu
dents as sources of revenue. The
department must recognize that
although the students' tuition
does not go into the AD's coffer,
Stanford students both those
with varsity credentials and those
with other skills already have a
bill that is a touch hefty to pay.
The additional revenue gar
nered from the dedicated stu
dents who are willing to feed
bucks into the system will never
outweigh the costs of destroying
the broad support that Stanford
students, even the fair-weather
fan who wishes to watch a friend
compete every so often, offer to
Stanford athletes.

to be hurt by losing a couple of bucks
each week? Will the smaller sports really
lose the dedicated fans or will the atten
dance charge for "students" just add a
little more cash to the Athletic Depart
ment's drained account?
According to Acting Athletic Director
Alan Cummings, the decision to charge

students for all events was a strictly
financial decision. The department
receives no money from the University's
student fees and, in order to maintain
the broad-based varsity sports program,
the department's cabinet decided to
charge students as one part within the
total plan to increase revenue.
At the second meeting, the cabinet
decided that it needed to standardize its
policy regarding the attendance of var
sity athletes at sporting events in which
they were not competing. Under NCAA
rules, varsity athletes cannot receive
hard tickets but can enter events
through a gate list.
Stanford has, in the past, allowed ath
letes to enter into events free, but the
procedure had not been formalized.
According to Cummings, this NCAA pro
cedure allows Stanford to grant privi
leges to its "student-athletes."
The time and effort that these ath
letes contribute to perfecting their per
formance is indisputably impressive.
The time dedicated to sport undeniably
cuts back on the ability of the non-schol
arship athletes to earn money through
part-time jobs in order to meet the
demanding financial requirements of
college.
Still, to suggest that the non-varsity
rugby player but not the varsity rower
need to pay in order to maintain the
broad athletic opportunities is absurd.
No one debates the fantastic value
that the breadth of the sports program
offers to every Stanford student. Fresh
man walk onto the Farm and have their
eyes opened by a dormmate playing a
sport that they had never even dreamed
about. Students, in the past, and ath
letes, in the present, could see their
friends playing in a water polo game, a
soccer game and a field hockey game all
in one afternoon without feeling guilty
about their wallets growing thin.

In addition, the athlete who
excels in an unrecognized sport
could come to Stanford and prac
tice with Olympic-caliber coaches
and athletes.
But when faced with financial
difficulties, the department deter
mined to ask students but not the
athletes who receive the most
direct benefits from the strong
programs to pay to supplement
the athletic opportunities. The
department determined that the
Stanford student must finance
the facilities of the Stanford ath
lete.
The department could not
offer a more rational reason for
enabling varsity athletes free
admission than to comment that
the student-athletes "are easily
identifiable off of team rosters." A
more reasonable explanation
would be that the department
would like to extend privileges
granted by the NCAA to Stanford
athletes as a perk to the athletes
for their dedication and hard
work within the program.
In reality, most students can
find away to fork out the extra
forty-three dollars needed to buy
an all-sports pass and to support
Stanford athletics.

However, the privileged
exemption of athletes underlines
the most appalling point of the
entire discussion: The distinction
has violated the sacred principle
that a Stanford student, whether
a varsity athlete or a measly con
cert violinist, is first and foremost
a student and Stanford students
are treated equally by the Univer
sity.
The Farm must find away to
eliminate this stench.
Money speaks loudly in the
Department of Athletics, and one
solution is to make all of the ath
letes cough up some cash.
More effectively, the depart
ment must look at their ill-con
ceived approach towards the stu
dents as sources of revenue. The
department must recognize that
although the students' tuition
does not go into the AD's coffer,
Stanford students both those
with varsity credentials and those
with other skills already have a
bill that is a touch hefty to pay.
The additional revenue gar
nered from the dedicated stu
dents who are willing to feed
bucks into the system will never
outweigh the costs of destroying
the broad support that Stanford
students, even the fair-weather
fan who wishes to watch a friend
compete every so often, offer to
Stanford athletes.
When students returned to Stanford
this fall, they found a Farm that had
developed a rather unpleasant odor.
In two separate meetings, the Depart
ment of Athletics decided (1) to break
tradition by charging students for atten
dance at all varsity sports events, and (2)
to formalize an unspoken and confused
tradition allowing varsity athletes to
attend all varsity sports for free.

With these two decisions, the depart
ment has upset the fragile balance
between sports and study that the Uni
versity has taken so much pride in devel
oping. Instead of including athletic
achievement as one in a long list of out
standing extracurricular activities, the
department has taken it upon itself to
hammer in a privileged second tier a
division which turns the varsity athlete
at Stanford University into a Stanford
varsity athlete.
Why make such a big deal out of such
an insignificant change? Tickets to a vol
leyball game, a soccer game or a water
polo match are only two meager dollars
much less than paying to be enter
tained at the movie theater; who is going
to be hurt by losing a couple of bucks
each week? Will the smaller sports really
lose the dedicated fans or will the atten
dance charge for "students" just add a
little more cash to the Athletic Depart
ment's drained account?
