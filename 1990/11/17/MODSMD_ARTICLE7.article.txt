# Superstar Milburn maintains level head
## 
### T.C. Hall Editorial staff 
Last week against Arizona,
Glyn Milburn ran a punt back for
an apparent touchdown and did
something very strange.
He celebrated.
"Ellery (Roberts) and I had
talked beforehand," Milburn said,
"and decided that if we did some
thing with (the punt) we would do
something so I just sort of put my
fingers in the air."
In this age of athletic show
boating, Milburn's slight display
of pistol shooting fingers only
drew yawns from the Wildcat
crowd, but the Cardinal could not
help but laugh at their offensive
star.
"They just laughed because the
play got called back and the joke
was on me," Milburn said. "It was
good fun."
It was good fun, but not for the
reason that Milburn thinks.
"It was great to see because he
doesn't do that kind of stuff,"
punter Paul Stonehouse said. "He
is not a rah-rah person. He
doesn't come to the sideline look
ing for high-fives."
Not that the 5-foot-9, all-pur
pose back from Santa Monica,
Calif, is not deserving of a couple
hand slaps. After transferring
from Oklahoma two years ago and
being forced to sit out last season,
Milburn has come on to become
the key behind the Stanford
offense.
In his duties as running back,
receiver, punt returner and kick
returner Milburn has amassed
1,843 yards and 4 touchdowns.
Milburn is second in the nation in
all-purpose yards, averaging 184.3
a game, and is on line to break
Darrin Nelson's school record of
1,998 all-purpose yards set in
1981.
Milburn could probably do a

cartwheel after every play and
people would not bat an eye, but
that is not how the redshirt
sophomore operates.
"I just let my actions show for
themselves," Milburn said. "I get
pretty excited when I run the ball,
but I like to save my energy for
the next play."
Maybe if you were dealing with
somebody else, hearing this slice
of humble pie served up might not
sound genuine, but according to
those who play with him, if he
tried to be anything else he would
not be Glyn.
"All you can do is respect him
because he doesn't try to prove
anything," Stonehouse said. "It
would be too fake if he tried to yell
and scream at everybody."
"He is a very sincere individ
ual," Turner said. "He will do
something, but won't talk about
it. He just does it."
That includes things on and off
the field.
Milburn is a young man who
takes his faith seriously and is
active both in the church and in
the community. Trips to the Stan
ford Children's Hospital are just
another part of a life that the
sophomore tries to pass off as
"simple." Milburn is not trying to
prove anything to anybody, he just
does what he does because he feels
it is right.
"I'm thankful for the abilities
that I have, and I have an appreci
ation for people who are less for
tunate," Milburn said. "This isn't
something that should be com
mended, it is just something that
is right. I'm happy with what I've
done this year, and I feel an obliga
tion to make other people feel
happy."
Whether it be the kids he sees
at the hospital or the teammates
he plays before at practice and at
games, it appears that Milburn is
succeeding at his goal.

"It is the funniest thing to
watch him," Stonehouse said,,
smiling. "To see him make so
many people look so clumsy, even
though you know they are all tal
ented players, is great."
"You think you have seen him
do everything," Turner said, "and
then he does something new.
Everyday he does something and
you just say 'wow.'"
Glyn Milburn is just a plain
surprise. In this age of athletic
egos that are fed by football facto
ries masking as colleges, and
multi-million dollar contracts that
help to create sports folk heroes,
Milburn has a refreshing sense of
perspective.

"I still think its weird to think
of people looking up to me because
it's not like I'm famous or any
thing," Milburn said. "I mean,
I'm still looking up to people."
One of those people be his
mother. A teacher in the Los
Angeles Unified School district,
Milburn's mom has had a firm
hand in shaping her son's views
and habits.
"My upbringing was really
important, Milburn said. "My
mom is a teacher and I have
always had to do my work first;
TV off until all the work was done,
that kind of thing. For the most
part I am disciplined, and have
been most of my career."

It is these work habits that
have been getting Milburn so
much press for his academic pur
suits, but Coach Denny Green
sees the same attitude on the field
as well.
"Glyn is not afraid to go 100
percent in practice or in a game,"
Green said. "Everybody knows he
only goes one speed."
Perhaps that is the secret to
what makes Milburn so special.
Life does not change because he is
in the classroom, on the field, or
talking to kids, Glyn Milburn only
knows how to be Glyn Milburn. If
that image is not what people

Glyn Milburn (above) has away of not letting anything get to him. After a stint at Oklahoma, the Santa
Monica native is now show-casing his talents for Stanford. The level-headed Milburn is respected for
selflessly getting the Job done, something his 1,843 all-purpose yards prove he has done.
expect, well, Milburn probably
would not know how to change.
"Glyn has his football friends
and his outside friends," Stone
house said. "He is not looking for
an image of football, but rather
one of friendship and success."
You have the feeling though
that the football image will be one
that will be hard to shake. Already

feared by coaches, Milburn still
has two more years to play, and
has the tools to someday make a
living carrying the football.
"There is no question (that he
can be a pro player)," Turner said.
"He is a football player. He has
great speed and acceleration and
is an excellent receiver who runs
super routes. There is no phase of
the game that he does poorly."
Except maybe showboat after a
score, but it's certain that the
sports world will forgive him for
that.
