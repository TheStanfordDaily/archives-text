# Young Cardinal takes wild roller coaster ride
## 
### David Schwartz 
"A rocky road."
The theme of the Stanford Car
dinal's 1990 football season can be
expressed in this short phrase.
The team experienced great tri
umph with a shocking upset
defeat of No. 1-ranked Notre
Dame, and near upsets of Col
orado and UCLA, yet experienced
the lows of being demolished by
Washington, suffering a shutout
at the hands of Oregon, and losing
to lesser team San Jose State.
All in all, this was a season of

"could've beens."
The Cardinal opened the 1990
football campaign on Sept. 6
against the No. 7 ranked Colorado
Buffaloes at Boulder in front of a
sold-out stadium and a national
prime-time ESPN television audi
ence. Stanford completely domi
nated the first half, taking a sur
prising lead of 14-0 into halftime.
But Colorado came alive in the
third quarter, led by quarterback
Darian Hagan and a 149 yard
rushing performance from Eric
Bieniemy. With the score 17-14
Stanford in the fourth quarter,

Colorado made one last march
down the field. With 1:40 to play,
Colorado was fourth and inches at
the Cardinal two.
Hagan converted. With about
30 seconds to play, Colorado was
first and goal at the Stanford one.
The Cardinal defense made three
consecutive goal-line stands. On
fourth-and-goal from the one,
with 12 seconds remaining, Bie
niemy went up over the top,
barely crossing the plane of the
goal line. The officials made a
judgment call in Colorado's favor
(The television replays were
inconclusive). Final score: Col
orado 21, Stanford 17.
Stanford traveled the following

week to Southern California, play
ing the UCLA Bruins at the Rose
Bowl. Stanford took the early lead
and led 14-7 at halftime. In the
third quarter, redshirt freshman
Tommy Maddox replaced starter
Jim Bonds and quarterbacked for
UCLA.
Although Stanford led 21-14
after three quarters of play,
UCLA, behind Maddox's 244
passing yards, outscored Stanford
18-10 in the final quarter. The
turning point of the game took
place at 5:54 in the fourth quarter.
UCLA just completed a TD drive
to tie the score at 28. But Cardinal
nose guard Frank Busalacchi
blocked the extra point. Maddox

alertly recovered the block and
passed to tight end Rick Daley for
the two point conversion to give
the Bruins a 29-28 lead.
John Hopkins put Stanford
ahead 31-29 with 1:14 to play on a
49-yard field goal, but UCLA
drove down the field, setting up
kicker Brad Deluiso for a field goal
with one second left on the clock.
Final score: UCLA 32, Stanford
31.
Commenting on the first two
defeats, coach Denny Green said,
"Disappointments are a part of
sports, unfortunately. Things
could have gone either way. I
think the big thing that our team
had to do was to get themselves
focused on the field and play like
we were capable of playing. We
were able to do that to a certain
extent so we were excited about it.
You can't dwell on [the losses]."
The Cardinal took out their
frustrations on the Pacific 10 Con
ference's cellar dweller, the Ore
gon State Beavers, in the home
opener. Before a spirited crowd,
Stanford demolished the boys
from Corvallis, evening their
record in conference play. Glyn
Milburn had 113 rushing yards on
20 carries.
Quarterback Jason Palumbis
was 15-18 for 122 yards before
being relieved early in the third
quarter, and receiver Ed McCaf
frey had eight receptions for 71
yards. Jimmy Klein's two inter
ceptions led an aggressive defense,
which had six quarterback sacks,
and Stanford racked up its highest
point total since 1988. Final score:
Stanford 37, Oregon State 3.
On the final Saturday of
September, the Cardinal faced the
San Jose State Spartans in the
annual "South Bay Showdown."
What should have been a
walkover for Stanford turned ugly
both on and off the field, as Stan
ford lost to an inferior San Jose
State squad, and some San Jose
State fans were ejected for fight
ing.

Even a beach Boys concert fol
lowing the game could not soften
this loss. Simply put, the Cardinal
did not execute. As guard Chuck
Gillingham said after the game,
"We just weren't getting things
done that we needed to get done."
McCaffrey was one of the few
bright spots for the Cardinal, net
ting 145 yards on 11 receptions.
On a historical note, kicker
John Hopkins became Stanford's
all-time leading scorer with his
field goal in the first quarter. But
that field goal was the Cardinal's
only score of the half, and San
Jose State built up a 21-3 third
quarter lead that the Cardinal
couldn't overcome. Final score:
San Jose State 29, Stanford 23.
Oct. 6, 1990 is a day that will
forever be remembered in the
annals of Stanford athletics. For it
was on this day that one of the
most amazing upsets in college
football history took place. The 1-
3 Cardinal traveled to South
Bend, Ind. to take on the No. 1
Ranked Fighting Irish of Notre
Dame. On paper, the Irish seem
ingly had everything in their
favor. Stanford had not won on
the road since 1986. Notre Dame
had not lost at home since 1985
and had not lost at home while
ranked No. 1 since 1954.
But all of these facts were shot
out of the water by the Stanford
Cardinal, the little engine that
could. It appeared as if it was
going to be a long day for Stan
ford, as Notre Dame established a
24-7 lead midway into the second
quarter. But Stanford scored on

an 80-yard drive with a two-point
conversion to cut the margin to
24-15 at halftime.
The teams battled throughout
the second half, and Stanford took
the lead 36-31 on "Touchdown"
Tommy Vardell's fourth TD
plunge of the day with 36 seconds
remaining.
But the scene was all too famil
iar. Just as in the Colorado and
UCLA games, Stanford seemingly
left too much time on the clock.
With 31 seconds left, Notre Dame
quarterback Rick Mirer guided his
team quickly down the field.
Starting at their own 18, the Irish
moved 47 yards to the Cardinal 23
behind Mirer passes of 26 and 21
yards.
The* Irish had 13 seconds left to
pull off a comeback victory. Mirer
threw incomplete, and the clock
stood at six seconds. On the final
play, Mirer lofted a spiral for the
left front of the end zone to tight
end Derek Brown. Brown
stretched out his hands, but the
ball went through his fingertips.
Game over. Stanford wins! The
Cardinal had done the impossible,
shattering the Irish mystique
before a stunned crowd.
Green said, "We were riding
high. We had a great opportunity
playing the No. 1 team, and we
[took] advantage of it." Final
Score: Stanford 36, Notre Dame
31.
However, the Cardinal did not
have much time to celebrate, for
the USC Trojans came to Stan
ford Stadium Oct. 13. Stanford
came out smoking, leading 16-7 at

the end of the first quarter,
amassing 230 yards in the pro
cess. But then the Cardinal ran
out of gas. Stanford was unable to
convert on first downs, and USC
Quarterback Todd Marinovich got
hot.
He threw a 77-yard touchdown
bomb to Gary Wellman, showing
the Cardinal defense he meant
business. USC led 20-16 at half
time, and the Trojans never
looked back. The bright spots for
the Cardinal were McCaffrey's
seven receptions for 127 yards and
two touchdowns, and Palumbis'
three touchdown passes on 30-45
completions. Final Score: USC 37,
Stanford 22.
Just when the Cardinal
thought the road couldn't get any
tougher, it did. The Pac-10 cham
pion Washington Huskies came to
the Farm, and Stanford players
and fans alike were happy to see
them leave. The Huskies domi
nated the game from the opening
kickoff. Five Cardinal turnovers
and 11 penalties for 75 yards did
not help the Stanford cause. The
Cardinal trailed 31-0 at halftime
and lost by a 36 point margin.
Basically, it was ugly. Final score:
Washington 52, Stanford 16.
Stanford traveled to Eugene,
Ore. the following Saturday to
take on their fourth top-25 team
in as many weeks, the Oregon
Ducks. Stanford's offensive effort
was lacking.
The defense played a solid
game for the most part, but a few
mistakes proved costly. Duck run
ning back Sean Burwell took

advantage of a player's being out
of position on a 10-yard touch
down run, and no one was near
receiver Ngalu Kelemeni on a 33-
yard touchdown pass from Ore
gon quarterback Bill Musgrave.
Defensive mistakes and offensive
impotency resulted in a Cardinal
defeat. Even the LSJUMB was
booed. Final score: Oregon 31,
Stanford 0.
The Cardinal vented its frus
trations on the Washington State
Cougars in its final home game of
the season. McCaffrey, in his final
home game, had a field day, catch
ing three touchdown passes from
Palumbis and compiling a total of
176 receiving yards. Linebacker
Dave Garnett led the defense with
seven tackles, as the Cardinal
posted a solid effort to earn their
first victory in three games. Final
Score: Stanford 31, Washington
State 13.
On Saturday, Nov. 10, the Stan
ford football team took on another
top-25 team, the Arizona Wild
cats, at Tuscon. The Aloha Bowl
bound Wildcats wanted to gain
momentum before their trip to
Hawaii, but the Cardinal had dif
ferent plans. Stanford compiled
425 yards total offense, led by Mil
burn's career high 142 yards
rushing. Vardell scored two touch
downs, giving him a total of 14
touchdowns for the season and
breaking Brad Muster's record of
12.
For the first time since 1988,
Stanford recorded back-to-back
victories. Final score: Stanford 23,
Arizona 10.
