# Young Cardinal takes wild roller coaster ride
## 
### David Schwartz 
"A rocky road."
The theme of the Stanford Car
dinal's 1990 football season can be
expressed in this short phrase.
The team experienced great tri
umph with a shocking upset
defeat of No. 1-ranked Notre
Dame, and near upsets of Col
orado and UCLA, yet experienced
the lows of being demolished by
Washington, suffering a shutout
at the hands of Oregon, and losing
to lesser team San Jose State.
All in all, this was a season of

"could've beens."
The Cardinal opened the 1990
football campaign on Sept. 6
against the No. 7 ranked Colorado
Buffaloes at Boulder in front of a
sold-out stadium and a national
prime-time ESPN television audi
ence. Stanford completely domi
nated the first half, taking a sur
prising lead of 14-0 into halftime.
But Colorado came alive in the
third quarter, led by quarterback
Darian Hagan and a 149 yard
rushing performance from Eric
Bieniemy. With the score 17-14
Stanford in the fourth quarter,

Colorado made one last march
down the field. With 1:40 to play,
Colorado was fourth and inches at
the Cardinal two.
Hagan converted. With about
30 seconds to play, Colorado was
first and goal at the Stanford one.
The Cardinal defense made three
consecutive goal-line stands. On
fourth-and-goal from the one,
with 12 seconds remaining, Bie
niemy went up over the top,
barely crossing the plane of the
goal line. The officials made a
judgment call in Colorado's favor
(The television replays were
inconclusive). Final score: Col
orado 21, Stanford 17.
Stanford traveled the following

week to Southern California, play
ing the UCLA Bruins at the Rose
Bowl. Stanford took the early lead
and led 14-7 at halftime. In the
third quarter, redshirt freshman
Tommy Maddox replaced starter
Jim Bonds and quarterbacked for
UCLA.
Although Stanford led 21-14
after three quarters of play,
UCLA, behind Maddox's 244
passing yards, outscored Stanford
18-10 in the final quarter. The
turning point of the game took
place at 5:54 in the fourth quarter.
UCLA just completed a TD drive
to tie the score at 28. But Cardinal
nose guard Frank Busalacchi
blocked the extra point. Maddox

alertly recovered the block and
passed to tight end Rick Daley for
the two point conversion to give
the Bruins a 29-28 lead.
John Hopkins put Stanford
ahead 31-29 with 1:14 to play on a
49-yard field goal, but UCLA
drove down the field, setting up
kicker Brad Deluiso for a field goal
with one second left on the clock.
Final score: UCLA 32, Stanford
31.
Commenting on the first two
defeats, coach Denny Green said,
"Disappointments are a part of
sports, unfortunately. Things
could have gone either way. I
