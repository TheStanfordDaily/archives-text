# Scott shoots to reach pros
## 
### Rick Campbell 
Stanford football has under
gone a great deal of change in the
past four years. There have been
new coaches, new formations and
many new players. Yet, during
that time one thing has remained
constant for Cardinal football
fans, the stellar play of cornerback
Kevin Scott.
The 5-foot-9 senior from St.
Mary's High School in Phoenix,
Ariz., donned a Stanford uniform
for the first time four years ago
and has since progressed into one
of the finest defensive backs in the
country.
The choice to come to the Farm
was not an easy one for Scott.
Having narrowed his choices to
three schools, Scott finally
selected Stanford over Arizona
and USC. The high powered aca
demics and lure of Pacific 10 Con
ference competition, among other
factors, eventually helped him
decide to lend his football talents
to the Cardinal.
"I really thought that it was
time to get away from there (Ari
zona), and I didn't want to get lost
in the shuffle at USC," Scott
explained. "Besides, I thought I
could come in here right away, get
a chance to start, and make an
impact."
And an impact is exactly what
Scott has made.
Since steeping into the starting
lineup for coach Jack Elway in the
fourth game of his freshman year,
he has wreaked havoc on opposing
wide receivers, gradually becom
ing one of the most respected
defensive backs in the country.
When Scott was given the oppor
tunity to win the starting job, he
stepped up, played well and has
yet to look back.

"I thought I could do the job,
and I let that be known to my
coaches and my teammates,"
Scott said of his first season with
the Cardinal. "I was given a
chance and I took advantage of it.
That's what it's all about, taking
advantage of opportunities."
Since that time Stanford faith
ful have felt very fortunate that
Scott was given that first chance.
While he has evolved into a great
cornerback, Scott has also become
the emotional leader of the young
Cardinal defense.
While this unit has taken its
licks at certain points of the sea
son, it has shown vast improve
ment the past two weeks and
hopes to carry its new found
momentum into today's game.
Scott's contributions to the
Stanford defense have not been
lost on defensive coordinator
Willie Shaw.
"Kevin's a very good leader,"
Shaw said. "He's a very motivated
and enthusiastic player, who also
does his homework. He picks up
offensive schemes as well as any
one. He has helped out a great
deal with the younger players as
they have tried to learn our
defense."
This leadership role that Scott
has assumed on the field is one
that he has welcomed. He believes
in the system that head coach
Denny Green and Shaw have
brought to Stanford and feels that
in a couple of years the Cardinal
will be a legitimate Rose Bowl con
tender.
In the meantime, he is happy
helping the younger players learn
the system and feels as though the
past two weeks are indicative that
they are beginning to execute as
they should.
"I think he (Shaw) relies on me

a lot," Scott explained. "He can
only coach the game; he can't play
it. He needs leadership on the field
if our defense is going to
improve."
While Scott has played a lead
ing role on the Cardinal defense
the past four years, he also real
izes the value of the coaching he
has received while at Stanford.
Shaw is a former defensive backs
coach in the NFL and has been
especially helpful in Scott's matu
ration into one of the best corner
backs in college football.
Inevitably, Scott has learned a
lot atjout defensive coverages and
about the physical style of play
that is sure to help him through
out his football career.
And while Scott is hesitant to
talk about the NFL, preferring to
concentrate on the game with Cal,
Shaw is more than willing to offer
his assessment of his star pupil's
abilities.
"As far as any of the other
defensive backs coming out of col
lege, I would rank Kevin right up
there with the best of them. I
would expect him to go relatively
high in the (NFL) draft," Shaw
said.
Although he admits to day
dreaming about the NFL, Scott
finds himself much more con
cerned with Big Game. While Cal
is a much improved team and
coming off a very impressive win
over Oregon, Stanford is unde
feated against the Golden Bears
during Scott's three years on the
Farm.
The Cardinal is currently play
ing its best football of the season
and Scott would like nothing bet
ter than to go out with a win
against Cal.
This year's Big Game also has a

special significance for Scott
because it will be the last game he
will play for the Cardinal. While
saddened by the thought of play
ing his final game for Stanford,
Scott has said he has done his best
to keep his thoughts on the game.
He feels that he has made his
contribution to Cardinal football
and is excited by the prospects of

how good Stanford will be in the
coming years.
"I try not to think about it (my
final game) too much, but when I
do think about it, I get a little
sad," Scott reflected. "It's a happy
moment because I am excited
about the future, but it is sad
when I think of leaving all my
friends.

the field.
