u my God, I can't oven
I I describe it, I cannot describe
it" said offensive tackle Dar
ran Baird.
Neither could anyone else, as the crowd
erupted for the second time, screaming
and pumping fists in the air, pouring over
the defenseless wall and mobbing the
team in celebration. Ninety-five players
ran around the field in ecstasy. Students,
athletes and coaches grabbed one another
and danced in the heaven known as
Memorial Stadium.
This*time there was no
penalty.
This time there were no seconds'on the
clock.
This time it was Stanford.
In what may have been the craziest,
most improbable, most dramatic Big
Game ever, Stanford pulled out an unbe- *
lievable 27-25 win as the clock hit :00 to
end the season with three straight victo
ries and a 5-6 year.

It was 1982 in reverse.
It was payback for The Play.
It was a game for the ages.
"This is the way to get it back,
this is the sequel. This is The
Play: Part II," said running back
Glyn Milburn. "It's kind of dtja
vu. They got theirs in '82 and now
we got ours."
"There's no question this was
the best [Big] Game of all time,"
offensive lineman Chuck Gilling
ham said. "Everyone can say 'Oh
they ran on the field' and all that
good stuff, but hey, that's hap
pened to us before."
With 12 seconds on the clock
thousands of California students
mobbed the field. Stanford had
just capped a dramatic drive by
pulling to within one point. Quar
terback Jason Palumbis had
moved the Cardinal 87 yards in
1:42, throwing key completions to
Chris Walsh and Milburn, hand
ing it off to Milburn for long gains,
and downing the ball in critical
situations to stop the clock. With
17 seconds remaining Palumbis
hit injured All-America receiver
Ed McCaffrey with a 19-yarder in
the end zone. Cal 25, Stanford 24.
Go for the tie or the win?
There was no question in coach
Denny Green's mind. Or in the
players'.
"If you're down it's ludicrous
not to go for it," Gillingham said.
"We worked all year for a situation
like that. Basically we had said on
the sideline if we get caught in a
situation like that we're going for
two."
Palumbis dropped back, going
for the two-pointer through the
air. Primary receiver Jon Pinck
ney appeared to be covered, but
McCaffrey was free deep in the
right side of the end zone. The ball
was headed home to McCaffrey's
familiar grasp and the victory,
when senior cornerback John
Hardy stepped in from nowhere.
Interception!
The home crowd went crazy.
Chanting "We want the Axe,"
Berkeley students, and a few play
ers, ran onto the field in celebra
"tibn, wallowing in the joy of
.defeating Stanford for the first
time since 1986. In their unadul
terated excitement, little did they
know they were becoming the
equivalent of the Stanford Band
in 1982.
For the game was not over.
Twelve seconds remained, as the
frenzied blue and gold crowd
seemed to have forgotton.
And in Big Game, 12 seconds
can be an eternity.
An announcement of "Every
one clear the field. The game is
not over," greeted the rejoicing
Golden Bears. The officials joined
in the celebratory mood by award
ing Cal a 15-yard delay of game
penalty for the premature celebra
tion, just as Stanford was penal
ized in That Other Big Game.
Stanford would kick off from

the 50 instead of the 35. An onside
kick was the only way to go.
John Hopkins' squib bounced
up the right side, and fittingly lept
into the arms of Cal's player of the
game, running back Russell
White. And as onside kicks often
do, squirmed right out.
"Cal's back line came and
landed right on it, but it squirted
right out of his hands and headed
out of bounds so I just dove and
held onto it and [the refereel blew
the whistle," said Kevin Scott.
Stanford ball at the 37. Nine
seconds to go.
Palumbis' threw his last pass
incomplete, overthrowing a cov
ered McCaffrey — but a flag was
down.
Cal's John Belli was called for
roughing the passer. The ball was
moved to the 22 with five seconds
to go.
The Bears called the obligatory
timeout to ice Hopkins.
"I was making sure there was
no time on the clock. You don't
want to leave time on the clock
because if you do the damndest
things can happen," Green said.

"And I had our number one secu
rity guy go down and make sure
the band was off the field and I
had our number two security guy
make sure the team stayed off the
field. If there was one second left
there were no Stanford students
who were going to be on the field."
Hopkins trotted back onto the
field for his sixth field goal
attempt of the evening. A 39-
yarder. The snap was good. The
kick? A little to the right, but
strong, and the Cardinal knew
this one was theirs.
Stanford 27, Cal 25. And the
clock showed 00:00.
"Wow, that's all you can say,"
said Pinckney. '
"I don't know it there's a more
fitting way to end the ballgame. If
we earn it, we earn it, and I think
we earned it," Green added.
"That's football. We never made
any excuses, we never asked for
any. It was a great football game.
If there was a better football game
in the history of the Big Game I
guess we'd all like to have it."
While 75,662 fans doubted that
Stanford had a prayer of pulling it

off, the Cardinal knew that it was
going to win. As soon as the team
methodically marched 83 yards
for a chance at victory, Stanford
players had a feeling the 93rd Big
Game was theirs.
"When I got ahold of the ball
(on the onside kick) all I could do
was smile in anticipation because
I knew the ball had bounced our
way for once, and finally we were
going to pull it out," said Scott.
"No one died down the stretch.
It looked like it was over but
everybody stayed in the game,
everyone kept their heads on it
and everyone played his ass off,"
Gillingham said. "I knew if we
have a chance we could take
advantage down the stretch."
And no one had the slightest
hesitation to call the victory well
deserved. Unusual penalties may
have aided the Cardinal in reach
ing the climax, but labeling the
plot cheap or unearned wasn't
even a consideration. Cal's five
laterals got the ball to the end
zone in '82, band or no band.
Hoppy's kick cruised through the
uprights just the same.

miracles? Yesf page 13

"If we did not win it we did not
deserve to win. You just have to
play it," Green said.
A thriller, however, was the last
thing in most fans' minds halfway
through the second quarter when
Cal led 17-3. There was excite
ment, there was White, Anthony
Wallace and Milburn, there were
some great plays. But there were
Stanford turnovers and mental
lapses.
Three times in the first 25 min
utes of the game Stanford had
driven toward a sure score, only to
come away with a fumble, an
interception and a lone field goal.
And the Bears were hot. White
and Wallace dazzled the crowds,
and frustrated the Cardinal
defense by continually turning
pitches and draw plays into 10- or
15-yard gains. And quarterback
Mike Pawlawski was adept when

needed, completing key third
down conversions and a few big
strikes throughout the first half.
White had 121 yards at half,
and finished the day with 177,
good enough to boost him over the
1,000-yard mark for the season.
Wallace cruised for 99 of his own,
which gave him 1,002 yards for
the year. It was the first time a
Pacific 10 Conference team has
ever had two backs each gain
1,000 yards on the ground.
Stanford knew it would have to
concentrate on stopping the two,
but had trouble keeping either
under reign. White broke free for
runs of 42, 25, 22,13 and 11 yards
and two touchdowns, and Wallace
bullied for a 44-yarder and
numerous first downs.
"We'd seen them on film and it
was just a matter that they came
out and fired off the ball well.
Their offensive line played really
well and they ran very hard and it
was really tough to contain
them," Scott said.
But a key second-quarter
defensive stand, when the Cardi
nal held the potent Bears to one
yard, slowed Cal's offensive
machine and gave Stanford the
confidence to keep plugging away.
Although the ensuing offensive
series, spearheaded by a Milburn
dash for 17, was stalled at the 12
when Palumbis missed McCaffrey
in the end zone on third down, a
field goal cut the lead to 11 at half
and gave the Cardinal momentum
going into the third quarter.
"It was a lot like Notre Dame.
We were kind of shooting our
selves in the foot. We were moving
the ball, we were running well,
but we weren't putting up any
points. We knew we could move
the ball," Pinckney said.

The second half they did. A
field goal on their first possession,
a touchdown on their second.
When they pulled to within two,
17-15, with five minutes remain
ing in the third quarter the fans
knew the game was heading for
the great matchup that it was
billed to be.
Cal's Joel Dickson blocked
Stanford's go-ahead field goal, but
after failing once again to make it
into the end zone, the Cardinal
got its three-pointer anyway. But
the Bear's offense, which had
been stymied for the first 20 min
utes of play after halftime, woke
up and cruised for the apparent
victory touchdown with six min
utes remaining.
But this is Big Game we're
talking about.
"We put ourselves in the posi
tion to win the game by playing
aggressive and hard-nosed foot
ball for 60 minutes," said
linebacker Ron George.
So did Milburn. The halfback,
who provided the Cardinal offense
what spark it had the first half,
was merely spectacular in the sec
ond. He could not be stopped. If he
wasn't returning kickoffs 45
yards, he was cutting back for
nine yards here, seven yards
there, or cruising for a 53-yard
touchdown. The latent talent that
had been untapped all season
burst forth Saturday evening.
Cal's defense could only watch. He
finished the day by avoiding Bear
tacklers for 196 yards rushing, 66
yards receiving and a Pac-10-
record 379 all-purpose yards.
"Milburn just has to be All-
American," Green elaborated.
Fullback Tommy Vardell also
helped carry the Stanford offense,
bulldozing for 59 yards on 13 car
ries and providing key blocks,
including the one that let Milburn
cruise for his 53-yard score.
It was the running game Stan
ford has been waiting for all sea

son.
"It was a game that offensively
and defensively running the ball
was key," explained Green. "They
ran the ball well but we ran the
ball well, better than we have all
year."
It was also the game of the year
for Palumbis. Although he started
slowly and seemed rather shaky at
first — he was 4-for-9 halfway
through the second quarter — the
junior directed the offense at will
and completed do-or-die passes.
A 26-of-41 performance,
including a touchdown, gave the
Cardinal 253 yards though the air,
mostly via the hands of Chris
Walsh, Pinckney and Milburn.
Combined with a season-high 247
yards rushing, Palumbis took
Stanford for a 600-yard ride.
But the game came down to
special teams, and it was the king
of the Cardinal specialty unit who
was the man of the hour, and of
Stanford history. By connecting
on his fifth field goal for the Car
dinal victory, Hopkins became the
first Stanford placekicker to ever
make five in a game, and passed
Mark Harmon as the all-time
point scorer on the Farm.
The records, however, meant
nothing to the senior.
"[The scoring record] will be
important in a few years, but right
now one or two records don't
mean anything compared to the
Axe, compared to the rivalry, com
pared to winning your last game
of your college career and going
out a winner. It's way more impor
tant. If I didn't get the records so
what. Maybe I'd care in a few
years," Hopkins said.
But he, like the rest of the Car
dinal, was just happy the breaks
finally went Stanford's way. For
once. After dropping last-second
thrillers to Colorado and UCLA
this season, and God-only-knows
how many in the past few years,
Stanford was relieved it was they

who were jumping up and down,
and not shaking their heads.
"It's nice to be on the right side
of it a few times. Notre Dame we
were on the right side, today we
were on the right side. It makes
up for some of the times when you
feel like you're never going to get
over the hump," Hopkins said, j
This count-your-lucky-stars;
win is going to help ease the mem-,
ory of the could-nave-beens and
should-have-beens of past con-|
tests for a long time.
"In June we're going to be;
walking around campus and we'U|
say 'Yes! we won Big Game!' and;
we'll go see the Axe every day,"!
George said. "It's just a great feel-!
ing because people remember.!
People are going to remember that;
we won the Axe for a whole year.";
There may never be another;
one like it.

It was 1982 in reverse.
It was payback for The Play.
It was a game for the ages.
"This is the way to get it back,
this is the sequel. This is The
Play: Part II," said running back
Glyn Milburn. "It's kind of dtja
vu. They got theirs in '82 and now
we got ours."
"There's no question this was
the best [Big] Game of all time,"
offensive lineman Chuck Gilling
ham said. "Everyone can say 'Oh
they ran on the field' and all that
good stuff, but hey, that's hap
pened to us before."
With 12 seconds on the clock
thousands of California students
mobbed the field. Stanford had
just capped a dramatic drive by
pulling to within one point. Quar
terback Jason Palumbis had
moved the Cardinal 87 yards in
1:42, throwing key completions to
Chris Walsh and Milburn, hand
ing it off to Milburn for long gains,
and downing the ball in critical
situations to stop the clock. With
17 seconds remaining Palumbis
hit injured All-America receiver
Ed McCaffrey with a 19-yarder in
the end zone. Cal 25, Stanford 24.
Go for the tie or the win?
There was no question in coach
Denny Green's mind. Or in the
players'.
"If you're down it's ludicrous
not to go for it," Gillingham said.
"We worked all year for a situation
like that. Basically we had said on
the sideline if we get caught in a
situation like that we're going for
two."
Palumbis dropped back, going
for the two-pointer through the
air. Primary receiver Jon Pinck
ney appeared to be covered, but
McCaffrey was free deep in the
right side of the end zone. The ball
was headed home to McCaffrey's
familiar grasp and the victory,
when senior cornerback John
Hardy stepped in from nowhere.
Interception!
The home crowd went crazy.
Chanting "We want the Axe,"
Berkeley students, and a few play
ers, ran onto the field in celebra
"tibn, wallowing in the joy of
.defeating Stanford for the first
time since 1986. In their unadul
terated excitement, little did they
know they were becoming the
equivalent of the Stanford Band
in 1982.
For the game was not over.
Twelve seconds remained, as the
frenzied blue and gold crowd
seemed to have forgotton.
And in Big Game, 12 seconds
can be an eternity.
An announcement of "Every
one clear the field. The game is
not over," greeted the rejoicing
Golden Bears. The officials joined
in the celebratory mood by award
ing Cal a 15-yard delay of game
penalty for the premature celebra
tion, just as Stanford was penal
ized in That Other Big Game.
Stanford would kick off from

the 50 instead of the 35. An onside
kick was the only way to go.
John Hopkins' squib bounced
up the right side, and fittingly lept
into the arms of Cal's player of the
game, running back Russell
White. And as onside kicks often
do, squirmed right out.
"Cal's back line came and
landed right on it, but it squirted
right out of his hands and headed
out of bounds so I just dove and
held onto it and [the refereel blew
the whistle," said Kevin Scott.
Stanford ball at the 37. Nine
seconds to go.
Palumbis' threw his last pass
incomplete, overthrowing a cov
ered McCaffrey — but a flag was
down.
Cal's John Belli was called for
roughing the passer. The ball was
moved to the 22 with five seconds
to go.
The Bears called the obligatory
timeout to ice Hopkins.
"I was making sure there was
no time on the clock. You don't
want to leave time on the clock
because if you do the damndest
things can happen," Green said.

"And I had our number one secu
rity guy go down and make sure
the band was off the field and I
had our number two security guy
make sure the team stayed off the
field. If there was one second left
there were no Stanford students
who were going to be on the field."
Hopkins trotted back onto the
field for his sixth field goal
attempt of the evening. A 39-
yarder. The snap was good. The
kick? A little to the right, but
strong, and the Cardinal knew
this one was theirs.
Stanford 27, Cal 25. And the
clock showed 00:00.
"Wow, that's all you can say,"
said Pinckney. '
"I don't know it there's a more
fitting way to end the ballgame. If
we earn it, we earn it, and I think
we earned it," Green added.
"That's football. We never made
any excuses, we never asked for
any. It was a great football game.
If there was a better football game
in the history of the Big Game I
guess we'd all like to have it."
While 75,662 fans doubted that
Stanford had a prayer of pulling it

off, the Cardinal knew that it was
going to win. As soon as the team
methodically marched 83 yards
for a chance at victory, Stanford
players had a feeling the 93rd Big
Game was theirs.
"When I got ahold of the ball
(on the onside kick) all I could do
was smile in anticipation because
I knew the ball had bounced our
way for once, and finally we were
going to pull it out," said Scott.
"No one died down the stretch.
It looked like it was over but
everybody stayed in the game,
everyone kept their heads on it
and everyone played his ass off,"
Gillingham said. "I knew if we
have a chance we could take
advantage down the stretch."
And no one had the slightest
hesitation to call the victory well
deserved. Unusual penalties may
have aided the Cardinal in reach
ing the climax, but labeling the
plot cheap or unearned wasn't
even a consideration. Cal's five
laterals got the ball to the end
zone in '82, band or no band.
Hoppy's kick cruised through the
uprights just the same.

miracles? Yesf page 13

"If we did not win it we did not
deserve to win. You just have to
play it," Green said.
A thriller, however, was the last
thing in most fans' minds halfway
through the second quarter when
Cal led 17-3. There was excite
ment, there was White, Anthony
Wallace and Milburn, there were
some great plays. But there were
Stanford turnovers and mental
lapses.
Three times in the first 25 min
utes of the game Stanford had
driven toward a sure score, only to
come away with a fumble, an
interception and a lone field goal.
And the Bears were hot. White
and Wallace dazzled the crowds,
and frustrated the Cardinal
defense by continually turning
pitches and draw plays into 10- or
15-yard gains. And quarterback
Mike Pawlawski was adept when

needed, completing key third
down conversions and a few big
strikes throughout the first half.
White had 121 yards at half,
and finished the day with 177,
good enough to boost him over the
1,000-yard mark for the season.
Wallace cruised for 99 of his own,
which gave him 1,002 yards for
the year. It was the first time a
Pacific 10 Conference team has
ever had two backs each gain
1,000 yards on the ground.
Stanford knew it would have to
concentrate on stopping the two,
but had trouble keeping either
under reign. White broke free for
runs of 42, 25, 22,13 and 11 yards
and two touchdowns, and Wallace
bullied for a 44-yarder and
numerous first downs.
"We'd seen them on film and it
was just a matter that they came
out and fired off the ball well.
Their offensive line played really
well and they ran very hard and it
was really tough to contain
them," Scott said.
But a key second-quarter
defensive stand, when the Cardi
nal held the potent Bears to one
yard, slowed Cal's offensive
machine and gave Stanford the
confidence to keep plugging away.
Although the ensuing offensive
series, spearheaded by a Milburn
dash for 17, was stalled at the 12
when Palumbis missed McCaffrey
in the end zone on third down, a
field goal cut the lead to 11 at half
and gave the Cardinal momentum
going into the third quarter.
"It was a lot like Notre Dame.
We were kind of shooting our
selves in the foot. We were moving
the ball, we were running well,
but we weren't putting up any
points. We knew we could move
the ball," Pinckney said.

The second half they did. A
field goal on their first possession,
a touchdown on their second.
When they pulled to within two,
17-15, with five minutes remain
ing in the third quarter the fans
knew the game was heading for
the great matchup that it was
billed to be.
Cal's Joel Dickson blocked
Stanford's go-ahead field goal, but
after failing once again to make it
into the end zone, the Cardinal
got its three-pointer anyway. But
the Bear's offense, which had
been stymied for the first 20 min
utes of play after halftime, woke
up and cruised for the apparent
victory touchdown with six min
utes remaining.
But this is Big Game we're
talking about.
"We put ourselves in the posi
tion to win the game by playing
aggressive and hard-nosed foot
ball for 60 minutes," said
linebacker Ron George.
So did Milburn. The halfback,
who provided the Cardinal offense
what spark it had the first half,
was merely spectacular in the sec
ond. He could not be stopped. If he
wasn't returning kickoffs 45
yards, he was cutting back for
nine yards here, seven yards
there, or cruising for a 53-yard
touchdown. The latent talent that
had been untapped all season
burst forth Saturday evening.
Cal's defense could only watch. He
finished the day by avoiding Bear
tacklers for 196 yards rushing, 66
yards receiving and a Pac-10-
record 379 all-purpose yards.
"Milburn just has to be All-
American," Green elaborated.
Fullback Tommy Vardell also
helped carry the Stanford offense,
bulldozing for 59 yards on 13 car
ries and providing key blocks,
including the one that let Milburn
cruise for his 53-yard score.
It was the running game Stan
ford has been waiting for all sea

son.
"It was a game that offensively
and defensively running the ball
was key," explained Green. "They
ran the ball well but we ran the
ball well, better than we have all
year."
It was also the game of the year
for Palumbis. Although he started
slowly and seemed rather shaky at
first — he was 4-for-9 halfway
through the second quarter — the
junior directed the offense at will
and completed do-or-die passes.
A 26-of-41 performance,
including a touchdown, gave the
Cardinal 253 yards though the air,
mostly via the hands of Chris
Walsh, Pinckney and Milburn.
Combined with a season-high 247
yards rushing, Palumbis took
Stanford for a 600-yard ride.
But the game came down to
special teams, and it was the king
of the Cardinal specialty unit who
was the man of the hour, and of
Stanford history. By connecting
on his fifth field goal for the Car
dinal victory, Hopkins became the
first Stanford placekicker to ever
make five in a game, and passed
Mark Harmon as the all-time
point scorer on the Farm.
The records, however, meant
nothing to the senior.
"[The scoring record] will be
important in a few years, but right
now one or two records don't
mean anything compared to the
Axe, compared to the rivalry, com
pared to winning your last game
of your college career and going
out a winner. It's way more impor
tant. If I didn't get the records so
what. Maybe I'd care in a few
years," Hopkins said.
But he, like the rest of the Car
dinal, was just happy the breaks
finally went Stanford's way. For
once. After dropping last-second
thrillers to Colorado and UCLA
this season, and God-only-knows
how many in the past few years,
Stanford was relieved it was they

who were jumping up and down,
and not shaking their heads.
"It's nice to be on the right side
of it a few times. Notre Dame we
were on the right side, today we
were on the right side. It makes
up for some of the times when you
feel like you're never going to get
over the hump," Hopkins said, j
This count-your-lucky-stars;
win is going to help ease the mem-,
ory of the could-nave-beens and
should-have-beens of past con-|
tests for a long time.
"In June we're going to be;
walking around campus and we'U|
say 'Yes! we won Big Game!' and;
we'll go see the Axe every day,"!
George said. "It's just a great feel-!
ing because people remember.!
People are going to remember that;
we won the Axe for a whole year.";
There may never be another;
one like it.

how many in the past few years,
Stanford was relieved it was they

who were jumping up and down,
and not shaking their heads.
"It's nice to be on the right side
of it a few times. Notre Dame we
were on the right side, today we
were on the right side. It makes
up for some of the times when you
feel like you're never going to get

end the season with three straight victo
ries and a 5-6 year.


Chris Eisenberg — Daily
It was 1982 in reverse.
It was payback for The Play.
It was a game for the ages.
"This is the way to get it back,
this is the sequel. This is The
Play: Part II," said running back
Glyn Milburn. "It's kind of dtja
vu. They got theirs in '82 and now
we got ours."
"There's no question this was
the best [Big] Game of all time,"
offensive lineman Chuck Gilling
ham said. "Everyone can say 'Oh
they ran on the field' and all that
good stuff, but hey, that's hap
pened to us before."
With 12 seconds on the clock
thousands of California students
mobbed the field. Stanford had
just capped a dramatic drive by
pulling to within one point. Quar
terback Jason Palumbis had
moved the Cardinal 87 yards in
1:42, throwing key completions to
Chris Walsh and Milburn, hand
ing it off to Milburn for long gains,
and downing the ball in critical
situations to stop the clock. With
17 seconds remaining Palumbis
hit injured All-America receiver
Ed McCaffrey with a 19-yarder in
the end zone. Cal 25, Stanford 24.
Go for the tie or the win?
There was no question in coach
Denny Green's mind. Or in the
players'.
"If you're down it's ludicrous
not to go for it," Gillingham said.
"We worked all year for a situation
like that. Basically we had said on
the sideline if we get caught in a
situation like that we're going for
two."
Palumbis dropped back, going
for the two-pointer through the
air. Primary receiver Jon Pinck
ney appeared to be covered, but
McCaffrey was free deep in the
right side of the end zone. The ball
was headed home to McCaffrey's
familiar grasp and the victory,
when senior cornerback John
Hardy stepped in from nowhere.
Interception!
The home crowd went crazy.
Chanting "We want the Axe,"
Berkeley students, and a few play
ers, ran onto the field in celebra
"tibn, wallowing in the joy of
.defeating Stanford for the first
time since 1986. In their unadul
terated excitement, little did they
know they were becoming the
equivalent of the Stanford Band
in 1982.
For the game was not over.
Twelve seconds remained, as the
frenzied blue and gold crowd
seemed to have forgotton.
And in Big Game, 12 seconds
can be an eternity.
An announcement of "Every
one clear the field. The game is
not over," greeted the rejoicing
Golden Bears. The officials joined
in the celebratory mood by award
ing Cal a 15-yard delay of game
penalty for the premature celebra
tion, just as Stanford was penal
ized in That Other Big Game.
Stanford would kick off from

the 50 instead of the 35. An onside
kick was the only way to go.
John Hopkins' squib bounced
up the right side, and fittingly lept
into the arms of Cal's player of the
game, running back Russell
White. And as onside kicks often
do, squirmed right out.
"Cal's back line came and
landed right on it, but it squirted
right out of his hands and headed
out of bounds so I just dove and
held onto it and [the refereel blew
the whistle," said Kevin Scott.
Stanford ball at the 37. Nine
seconds to go.
Palumbis' threw his last pass
incomplete, overthrowing a cov
ered McCaffrey — but a flag was
down.
Cal's John Belli was called for
roughing the passer. The ball was
moved to the 22 with five seconds
to go.
The Bears called the obligatory
timeout to ice Hopkins.
"I was making sure there was
no time on the clock. You don't
want to leave time on the clock
because if you do the damndest
things can happen," Green said.

"And I had our number one secu
rity guy go down and make sure
the band was off the field and I
had our number two security guy
make sure the team stayed off the
field. If there was one second left
there were no Stanford students
who were going to be on the field."
Hopkins trotted back onto the
field for his sixth field goal
attempt of the evening. A 39-
yarder. The snap was good. The
kick? A little to the right, but
strong, and the Cardinal knew
this one was theirs.
Stanford 27, Cal 25. And the
clock showed 00:00.
"Wow, that's all you can say,"
said Pinckney. '
"I don't know it there's a more
fitting way to end the ballgame. If
we earn it, we earn it, and I think
we earned it," Green added.
"That's football. We never made
any excuses, we never asked for
any. It was a great football game.
If there was a better football game
in the history of the Big Game I
guess we'd all like to have it."
While 75,662 fans doubted that
Stanford had a prayer of pulling it

off, the Cardinal knew that it was
going to win. As soon as the team
methodically marched 83 yards
for a chance at victory, Stanford
players had a feeling the 93rd Big
Game was theirs.
"When I got ahold of the ball
(on the onside kick) all I could do
was smile in anticipation because
I knew the ball had bounced our
way for once, and finally we were
going to pull it out," said Scott.
"No one died down the stretch.
It looked like it was over but
everybody stayed in the game,
everyone kept their heads on it
and everyone played his ass off,"
Gillingham said. "I knew if we
have a chance we could take
advantage down the stretch."
And no one had the slightest
hesitation to call the victory well
deserved. Unusual penalties may
have aided the Cardinal in reach
ing the climax, but labeling the
plot cheap or unearned wasn't
even a consideration. Cal's five
laterals got the ball to the end
zone in '82, band or no band.
Hoppy's kick cruised through the
uprights just the same.

■ Do you believe in
miracles? Yesf page 13

"If we did not win it we did not
deserve to win. You just have to
play it," Green said.
A thriller, however, was the last
thing in most fans' minds halfway
through the second quarter when
Cal led 17-3. There was excite
ment, there was White, Anthony
Wallace and Milburn, there were
some great plays. But there were
Stanford turnovers and mental
lapses.
Three times in the first 25 min
utes of the game Stanford had
driven toward a sure score, only to
come away with a fumble, an
interception and a lone field goal.
And the Bears were hot. White
and Wallace dazzled the crowds,
and frustrated the Cardinal
defense by continually turning
pitches and draw plays into 10- or
15-yard gains. And quarterback
Mike Pawlawski was adept when

needed, completing key third
down conversions and a few big
strikes throughout the first half.
White had 121 yards at half,
and finished the day with 177,
good enough to boost him over the
1,000-yard mark for the season.
Wallace cruised for 99 of his own,
which gave him 1,002 yards for
the year. It was the first time a
Pacific 10 Conference team has
ever had two backs each gain
1,000 yards on the ground.
Stanford knew it would have to
concentrate on stopping the two,
but had trouble keeping either
under reign. White broke free for
runs of 42, 25, 22,13 and 11 yards
and two touchdowns, and Wallace
bullied for a 44-yarder and
numerous first downs.
"We'd seen them on film and it
was just a matter that they came
out and fired off the ball well.
Their offensive line played really
well and they ran very hard and it
was really tough to contain
them," Scott said.
But a key second-quarter
defensive stand, when the Cardi
nal held the potent Bears to one
yard, slowed Cal's offensive
machine and gave Stanford the
confidence to keep plugging away.
Although the ensuing offensive
series, spearheaded by a Milburn
dash for 17, was stalled at the 12
when Palumbis missed McCaffrey
in the end zone on third down, a
field goal cut the lead to 11 at half
and gave the Cardinal momentum
going into the third quarter.
"It was a lot like Notre Dame.
We were kind of shooting our
selves in the foot. We were moving
the ball, we were running well,
but we weren't putting up any
points. We knew we could move
the ball," Pinckney said.

The second half they did. A
field goal on their first possession,
a touchdown on their second.
When they pulled to within two,
17-15, with five minutes remain
ing in the third quarter the fans
knew the game was heading for
the great matchup that it was
billed to be.
Cal's Joel Dickson blocked
Stanford's go-ahead field goal, but
after failing once again to make it
into the end zone, the Cardinal
got its three-pointer anyway. But
the Bear's offense, which had
been stymied for the first 20 min
utes of play after halftime, woke
up and cruised for the apparent
victory touchdown with six min
utes remaining.
But this is Big Game we're
talking about.
"We put ourselves in the posi
tion to win the game by playing
aggressive and hard-nosed foot
ball for 60 minutes," said
linebacker Ron George.
So did Milburn. The halfback,
who provided the Cardinal offense
what spark it had the first half,
was merely spectacular in the sec
ond. He could not be stopped. If he
wasn't returning kickoffs 45
yards, he was cutting back for
nine yards here, seven yards
there, or cruising for a 53-yard
touchdown. The latent talent that
had been untapped all season
burst forth Saturday evening.
Cal's defense could only watch. He
finished the day by avoiding Bear
tacklers for 196 yards rushing, 66
yards receiving and a Pac-10-
record 379 all-purpose yards.
"Milburn just has to be All-
American," Green elaborated.
Fullback Tommy Vardell also
helped carry the Stanford offense,
bulldozing for 59 yards on 13 car
ries and providing key blocks,
including the one that let Milburn
cruise for his 53-yard score.
It was the running game Stan
ford has been waiting for all sea

son.
"It was a game that offensively
and defensively running the ball
was key," explained Green. "They
ran the ball well but we ran the
ball well, better than we have all
year."
It was also the game of the year
for Palumbis. Although he started
slowly and seemed rather shaky at
first — he was 4-for-9 halfway
through the second quarter — the
junior directed the offense at will
and completed do-or-die passes.
A 26-of-41 performance,
including a touchdown, gave the
Cardinal 253 yards though the air,
mostly via the hands of Chris
Walsh, Pinckney and Milburn.
Combined with a season-high 247
yards rushing, Palumbis took
Stanford for a 600-yard ride.
But the game came down to
special teams, and it was the king
of the Cardinal specialty unit who
was the man of the hour, and of
Stanford history. By connecting
on his fifth field goal for the Car
dinal victory, Hopkins became the
first Stanford placekicker to ever
make five in a game, and passed
Mark Harmon as the all-time
point scorer on the Farm.
The records, however, meant
nothing to the senior.
"[The scoring record] will be
important in a few years, but right
now one or two records don't
mean anything compared to the
Axe, compared to the rivalry, com
pared to winning your last game
of your college career and going
out a winner. It's way more impor
tant. If I didn't get the records so
what. Maybe I'd care in a few
years," Hopkins said.
But he, like the rest of the Car
dinal, was just happy the breaks
finally went Stanford's way. For
once. After dropping last-second
thrillers to Colorado and UCLA
this season, and God-only-knows
how many in the past few years,
Stanford was relieved it was they

who were jumping up and down,
and not shaking their heads.
"It's nice to be on the right side
of it a few times. Notre Dame we
were on the right side, today we
were on the right side. It makes
up for some of the times when you
feel like you're never going to get

Stanford for a 600-yard ride.
But the game came down to
special teams, and it was the king
of the Cardinal specialty unit who
was the man of the hour, and of
Stanford history. By connecting
on his fifth field goal for the Car
dinal victory, Hopkins became the
first Stanford placekicker to ever
make five in a game, and passed
Mark Harmon as the all-time
point scorer on the Farm.
The records, however, meant
nothing to the senior.
"[The scoring record] will be
important in a few years, but right
now one or two records don't
mean anything compared to the
Axe, compared to the rivalry, com
pared to winning your last game
of your college career and going
out a winner. It's way more impor
tant. If I didn't get the records so
what. Maybe I'd care in a few
years," Hopkins said.
But he, like the rest of the Car
dinal, was just happy the breaks
finally went Stanford's way. For
once. After dropping last-second
thrillers to Colorado and UCLA
this season, and God-only-knows
how many in the past few years,
Stanford was relieved it was they

who were jumping up and down,
and not shaking their heads.
"It's nice to be on the right side
of it a few times. Notre Dame we
were on the right side, today we
were on the right side. It makes
up for some of the times when you
feel like you're never going to get
over the hump," Hopkins said, j
This count-your-lucky-stars;
win is going to help ease the mem-,
ory of the could-nave-beens and
should-have-beens of past con-|
tests for a long time.
"In June we're going to be;

There may never be another;

In what may have been the craziest,

end the season with three straight victo
ries and a 5-6 year.


Chris Eisenberg — Daily
It was 1982 in reverse.
It was payback for The Play.
It was a game for the ages.
"This is the way to get it back,
this is the sequel. This is The
Play: Part II," said running back
Glyn Milburn. "It's kind of dtja
vu. They got theirs in '82 and now
we got ours."
"There's no question this was
the best [Big] Game of all time,"
offensive lineman Chuck Gilling
ham said. "Everyone can say 'Oh
they ran on the field' and all that
good stuff, but hey, that's hap
pened to us before."
With 12 seconds on the clock
thousands of California students
mobbed the field. Stanford had
just capped a dramatic drive by
pulling to within one point. Quar
terback Jason Palumbis had
moved the Cardinal 87 yards in
1:42, throwing key completions to
Chris Walsh and Milburn, hand
ing it off to Milburn for long gains,
and downing the ball in critical
situations to stop the clock. With
17 seconds remaining Palumbis
hit injured All-America receiver
Ed McCaffrey with a 19-yarder in
the end zone. Cal 25, Stanford 24.
Go for the tie or the win?
There was no question in coach
Denny Green's mind. Or in the
players'.
"If you're down it's ludicrous
not to go for it," Gillingham said.
"We worked all year for a situation
like that. Basically we had said on
the sideline if we get caught in a
situation like that we're going for
two."
Palumbis dropped back, going
for the two-pointer through the
air. Primary receiver Jon Pinck
ney appeared to be covered, but
McCaffrey was free deep in the
right side of the end zone. The ball
was headed home to McCaffrey's
familiar grasp and the victory,
when senior cornerback John
Hardy stepped in from nowhere.
Interception!
The home crowd went crazy.
Chanting "We want the Axe,"
Berkeley students, and a few play
ers, ran onto the field in celebra
"tibn, wallowing in the joy of
.defeating Stanford for the first
time since 1986. In their unadul
terated excitement, little did they
know they were becoming the
equivalent of the Stanford Band
in 1982.
For the game was not over.
Twelve seconds remained, as the
frenzied blue and gold crowd
seemed to have forgotton.
And in Big Game, 12 seconds
can be an eternity.
An announcement of "Every
one clear the field. The game is
not over," greeted the rejoicing
Golden Bears. The officials joined
in the celebratory mood by award
ing Cal a 15-yard delay of game
penalty for the premature celebra
tion, just as Stanford was penal
ized in That Other Big Game.
Stanford would kick off from

the 50 instead of the 35. An onside
kick was the only way to go.
John Hopkins' squib bounced
up the right side, and fittingly lept
into the arms of Cal's player of the
game, running back Russell
White. And as onside kicks often
do, squirmed right out.
"Cal's back line came and
landed right on it, but it squirted
right out of his hands and headed
out of bounds so I just dove and
held onto it and [the refereel blew
the whistle," said Kevin Scott.
Stanford ball at the 37. Nine
seconds to go.
Palumbis' threw his last pass
incomplete, overthrowing a cov
ered McCaffrey — but a flag was
down.
Cal's John Belli was called for
roughing the passer. The ball was
moved to the 22 with five seconds
to go.
The Bears called the obligatory
timeout to ice Hopkins.
"I was making sure there was
no time on the clock. You don't
want to leave time on the clock
because if you do the damndest
things can happen," Green said.

"And I had our number one secu
rity guy go down and make sure
the band was off the field and I
had our number two security guy
make sure the team stayed off the
field. If there was one second left
there were no Stanford students
who were going to be on the field."
Hopkins trotted back onto the
field for his sixth field goal
attempt of the evening. A 39-
yarder. The snap was good. The
kick? A little to the right, but
strong, and the Cardinal knew
this one was theirs.
Stanford 27, Cal 25. And the
clock showed 00:00.
"Wow, that's all you can say,"
said Pinckney. '
"I don't know it there's a more
fitting way to end the ballgame. If
we earn it, we earn it, and I think
we earned it," Green added.
"That's football. We never made
any excuses, we never asked for
any. It was a great football game.
If there was a better football game
in the history of the Big Game I
guess we'd all like to have it."
While 75,662 fans doubted that
Stanford had a prayer of pulling it

off, the Cardinal knew that it was
going to win. As soon as the team
methodically marched 83 yards
for a chance at victory, Stanford
players had a feeling the 93rd Big
Game was theirs.
"When I got ahold of the ball
(on the onside kick) all I could do
was smile in anticipation because
I knew the ball had bounced our
way for once, and finally we were
going to pull it out," said Scott.
"No one died down the stretch.
It looked like it was over but
everybody stayed in the game,
everyone kept their heads on it
and everyone played his ass off,"
Gillingham said. "I knew if we
have a chance we could take
advantage down the stretch."
And no one had the slightest
hesitation to call the victory well
deserved. Unusual penalties may
have aided the Cardinal in reach
ing the climax, but labeling the
plot cheap or unearned wasn't
even a consideration. Cal's five
laterals got the ball to the end
zone in '82, band or no band.
Hoppy's kick cruised through the
uprights just the same.

■ Do you believe in
miracles? Yesf page 13

"If we did not win it we did not
deserve to win. You just have to
play it," Green said.
A thriller, however, was the last
thing in most fans' minds halfway
through the second quarter when
Cal led 17-3. There was excite
ment, there was White, Anthony
Wallace and Milburn, there were
some great plays. But there were
Stanford turnovers and mental
lapses.
Three times in the first 25 min
utes of the game Stanford had
driven toward a sure score, only to
come away with a fumble, an
interception and a lone field goal.
And the Bears were hot. White
and Wallace dazzled the crowds,
and frustrated the Cardinal
defense by continually turning
pitches and draw plays into 10- or
15-yard gains. And quarterback
Mike Pawlawski was adept when


Chris Eisenberg — Daily

needed, completing key third
down conversions and a few big
strikes throughout the first half.
White had 121 yards at half,
and finished the day with 177,
good enough to boost him over the
1,000-yard mark for the season.
Wallace cruised for 99 of his own,
which gave him 1,002 yards for
the year. It was the first time a
Pacific 10 Conference team has
ever had two backs each gain
1,000 yards on the ground.
Stanford knew it would have to
concentrate on stopping the two,
but had trouble keeping either
under reign. White broke free for
runs of 42, 25, 22,13 and 11 yards
and two touchdowns, and Wallace
bullied for a 44-yarder and
numerous first downs.
"We'd seen them on film and it
was just a matter that they came
out and fired off the ball well.
Their offensive line played really
well and they ran very hard and it
was really tough to contain
them," Scott said.
But a key second-quarter
defensive stand, when the Cardi
nal held the potent Bears to one
yard, slowed Cal's offensive
machine and gave Stanford the
confidence to keep plugging away.
Although the ensuing offensive
series, spearheaded by a Milburn
dash for 17, was stalled at the 12
when Palumbis missed McCaffrey
in the end zone on third down, a
field goal cut the lead to 11 at half
and gave the Cardinal momentum
going into the third quarter.
"It was a lot like Notre Dame.
We were kind of shooting our
selves in the foot. We were moving
the ball, we were running well,
but we weren't putting up any
points. We knew we could move
the ball," Pinckney said.

The second half they did. A
field goal on their first possession,
a touchdown on their second.
When they pulled to within two,
17-15, with five minutes remain
ing in the third quarter the fans
knew the game was heading for
the great matchup that it was
billed to be.
Cal's Joel Dickson blocked
Stanford's go-ahead field goal, but
after failing once again to make it
into the end zone, the Cardinal
got its three-pointer anyway. But
the Bear's offense, which had
been stymied for the first 20 min
utes of play after halftime, woke
up and cruised for the apparent
victory touchdown with six min
utes remaining.
But this is Big Game we're
talking about.
"We put ourselves in the posi
tion to win the game by playing
aggressive and hard-nosed foot
ball for 60 minutes," said
linebacker Ron George.
So did Milburn. The halfback,
who provided the Cardinal offense
what spark it had the first half,
was merely spectacular in the sec
ond. He could not be stopped. If he
wasn't returning kickoffs 45
yards, he was cutting back for
nine yards here, seven yards
there, or cruising for a 53-yard
touchdown. The latent talent that
had been untapped all season
burst forth Saturday evening.
Cal's defense could only watch. He
finished the day by avoiding Bear
tacklers for 196 yards rushing, 66
yards receiving and a Pac-10-
record 379 all-purpose yards.
"Milburn just has to be All-
American," Green elaborated.
Fullback Tommy Vardell also
helped carry the Stanford offense,
bulldozing for 59 yards on 13 car
ries and providing key blocks,
including the one that let Milburn
cruise for his 53-yard score.
It was the running game Stan
ford has been waiting for all sea

son.
"It was a game that offensively
and defensively running the ball
was key," explained Green. "They
ran the ball well but we ran the
ball well, better than we have all
year."
It was also the game of the year
for Palumbis. Although he started
slowly and seemed rather shaky at
first — he was 4-for-9 halfway
through the second quarter — the
junior directed the offense at will
and completed do-or-die passes.
A 26-of-41 performance,
including a touchdown, gave the
Cardinal 253 yards though the air,
mostly via the hands of Chris
Walsh, Pinckney and Milburn.
Combined with a season-high 247
yards rushing, Palumbis took
Stanford for a 600-yard ride.
But the game came down to
special teams, and it was the king
of the Cardinal specialty unit who
was the man of the hour, and of
Stanford history. By connecting
on his fifth field goal for the Car

"Milburn just has to be All-
American," Green elaborated.
Fullback Tommy Vardell also
helped carry the Stanford offense,
bulldozing for 59 yards on 13 car
ries and providing key blocks,
including the one that let Milburn
cruise for his 53-yard score.
It was the running game Stan
ford has been waiting for all sea

son.
"It was a game that offensively
and defensively running the ball
was key," explained Green. "They
ran the ball well but we ran the
ball well, better than we have all
year."
It was also the game of the year
for Palumbis. Although he started
slowly and seemed rather shaky at
first — he was 4-for-9 halfway
through the second quarter — the
junior directed the offense at will
and completed do-or-die passes.
A 26-of-41 performance,
including a touchdown, gave the
Cardinal 253 yards though the air,
mostly via the hands of Chris
Walsh, Pinckney and Milburn.
Combined with a season-high 247
yards rushing, Palumbis took
Stanford for a 600-yard ride.
But the game came down to
special teams, and it was the king
of the Cardinal specialty unit who
was the man of the hour, and of
Stanford history. By connecting
on his fifth field goal for the Car
dinal victory, Hopkins became the
first Stanford placekicker to ever
make five in a game, and passed
Mark Harmon as the all-time
point scorer on the Farm.
The records, however, meant
nothing to the senior.
"[The scoring record] will be
important in a few years, but right
now one or two records don't
mean anything compared to the
Axe, compared to the rivalry, com
pared to winning your last game
of your college career and going
out a winner. It's way more impor
tant. If I didn't get the records so
what. Maybe I'd care in a few
years," Hopkins said.
But he, like the rest of the Car
dinal, was just happy the breaks
finally went Stanford's way. For
once. After dropping last-second
thrillers to Colorado and UCLA
this season, and God-only-knows
how many in the past few years,
Stanford was relieved it was they

who were jumping up and down,
and not shaking their heads.
"It's nice to be on the right side
of it a few times. Notre Dame we
were on the right side, today we
were on the right side. It makes
up for some of the times when you
feel like you're never going to get
over the hump," Hopkins said, j
This count-your-lucky-stars;
win is going to help ease the mem-,
ory of the could-nave-beens and
should-have-beens of past con-|
tests for a long time.
"In June we're going to be;
walking around campus and we'U|
say 'Yes! we won Big Game!' and;
we'll go see the Axe every day,"!
George said. "It's just a great feel-!
ing because people remember.!
People are going to remember that;
we won the Axe for a whole year.";
There may never be another;
one like it.
Card notes
Stanford and Cal combined for an!
incredible 933 total yards.
Walsh led the Cardinal with 97J
yards receiving. Pinckney had 46 and;
McCaffrey 28.
Darrien Gordon, the wide*
receiver-turned defensive back, had!
one of the defensive plays of the day!
when he stymied a Cal drive by inter-1
cepting a Pawlawski pass. He looked;
just like a receiver. Funny.
Jono Tunney was involved in;
what could have been one of the'
weirder plays of the day when he»
picked up a Pawlawski fumble and'
cruised 40 yards only to have it!
stripped by White, turned defender for |
the moment. The runback was disal-;
lowed since the fumble was behind the 1
line of Bcrimmage, however. In college, >
the defense cannot advance a ball!
fumbled behind the line of scrimmage.!
Tunney led the Cardinal in tackles [
with 11, Gordon had 10, Jimmy;
Klein nine, Dave Garnett and;
Seyon Albert seven apiece and, 1
always hot for Big Game, Tuan Van •
Le six, including two for losses.
