u my God, I can't oven
I I describe it, I cannot describe
it" said offensive tackle Dar
ran Baird.
Neither could anyone else, as the crowd
erupted for the second time, screaming
and pumping fists in the air, pouring over
the defenseless wall and mobbing the
team in celebration. Ninety-five players
ran around the field in ecstasy. Students,
athletes and coaches grabbed one another
and danced in the heaven known as
Memorial Stadium.
This*time there was no
penalty.
This time there were no seconds'on the
clock.
This time it was Stanford.
In what may have been the craziest,
most improbable, most dramatic Big
Game ever, Stanford pulled out an unbe- *
lievable 27-25 win as the clock hit :00 to
end the season with three straight victo
ries and a 5-6 year.
