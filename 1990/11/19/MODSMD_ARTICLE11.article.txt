# Supreme Court rejects CNN's plea to air banned tapes
## 
### 
- WASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme
Court refused by a 7-2 vote yesterday to
» give Cable News Network permission to
< broadcast tape recordings of conversa
tions between Panama's Gen. Manuel
t Noriega and his lawyers.
The court rejected an emergency re
: quest by CNN that was aimed at lifting
a federal judge's order forbidding the
' broadcasts until he could determine what
the tapes disclose.
, The emergency request had called the
Nov. 8 order by U.S. District Judge
William Hoeveler in Miami an uncon
stitutional "prior restraint" of free
speech. But only two justices — Thurgood
Marshall and Sandra Day O'Connor —
agreed with that assessment.

Voting against CNN were Chief Justice
William Rehnquist and Justices Byron
White, Harry Blackmun, John Stevens,
Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy and
David Souter.
The Justice Department had joined
with Noriega's lawyers in opposing the
request.
In addition to the emergency request,
the court also turned down a formal ap
peal filed by the cable network, in a
one-sentence order.
CNN President Tom Johnson called the
court's decision "a loss of a battle in a
continuing war against censorship."
Johnson said the network would im
mediately turn the tapes in its possession
over to Judge Hoeveler. He said CNN is

"confident that after he reviews them he
will decide on the merits to deny the
prior restraint."
"CNN is committed to establishing its
full freedom to telecast newsworthy in
formation to the American people and it
will pursue this case vigorously in order
to do so," Johnson said.
Floyd Abrams, CNN's attorney in the
case, said the court's decison "has left
an opening through which defense
lawyers and prosecutors may try to
muzzle news articles."
"The refusal of the court to hear the
case does seem to countenance brief prior
restraints of a few days duration based
on almost no showing of need at all by
the courts," Abrams said.

In a dissenting opinion for himself and
O'Connor, Marshall said "this case is of
extraordinary consequence for freedom
of the press."
"Our precedents make unmistakably
clear that any prior restraint of expres
sion comes to this court bearing a heavy
presumption against its constitutional
validity and that the proponent of this
drastic remedy carries a heavy burden of
showing justification for its imposition,"
Marshall said.
"I do not see how the prior restraint
imposed in this case can be reconciled
with these teachings," Marshall said.
"Even more fundamentally, if the lower
courts in this case are correct in their
remarkable conclusion that publication

can be automatically restrained pending
application of the demanding test estab
lished by (a 1976 decision that severely
limited the power of judges to impose
such restraints) then I think it is imper
ative that we re-examine the premises
and operation of (that decision)," he
added.
Jane Kirtley, executive director of
Reporter's Committee for Freedom of the
Press, said she was "stunned" by the
decision, which she called "truly unprece
dented."
Walt Wurfel, a spokesman for the Na
tional Association of Broadcasters, said
his group was "very disappointed" with
the court's decision. "We view the lower
court's order as prior restraint," he said.
