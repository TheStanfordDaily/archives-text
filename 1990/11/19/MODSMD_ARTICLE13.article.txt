WASHINGTON (AP) - Florida Gov. Bob
Ms3ffhez" who refteSritly lost his re-election
bia, is likely to succeed William Bennett
as President Bush's top lieutenant in the
war on drugs, a White House official said
yesterday.
"Nobody else is being actively consid
ered," the official said. It was not clear
when the nomination might be announced.
Martinez, 55, was clobbered in his re
election effort by former Sen. Lawton
Chiles, losing by a 57-43 margin. He was
only the second Republican governor in
Florida since Reconstruction and he was
the second to lose a bid for a second term.
His term ends Jan. 8, when Chiles will be
inaugurated.
Bush traveled to Florida three times to
campaign for Martinez, and first lady Bar
bara Bush made a campaign commercial
on his behalf. Jeb Bush, one of the pres
ident's sons, was Martinez's campaign
chairman.
Bennett officially announced his resig
nation Nov. 8 as director of the Office of
National Drug Control Policy after 20
months on the job, but he is scheduled to
remain in the post until Nov. 30, according
to aides.
Bennett, who served as education secre
tary under President Ronald Reagan, ini
tially said he would become a fellow at a

conservative think-tank, the American En
terprise Institute, and write books on both
drugs and education.
But Republican sources said Saturday
that Bennett would be taking over Lee
Atwater's job as chairman of the Republi
can National Committee in January.
An administration source confirmed yes
terday that Bennett — who was a Democrat
until 1986 — had made up his mind to
accept the GOP job only Saturday morning.
Bush brushed aside questions about Ben
nett taking Atwater's job when he was
asked about it yesterday by reporters trav
eling with him in Europe.
"We're not discussing that," he said with
a smile. "A lot happens when I leave."
Atwater managed Bush's 1988 presiden
tial campaign but has been undergoing in
tensive treatment for a cancerous brain
tumor discovered last March.
In Paris, a senior administration official
traveling with the president said Atwater
will assume the title of "general chairman"
of the party. Asked whether the idea was
Bush's or Atwater's, the official said, "It
was both."
A GOP source said a formal announce
ment of Bennett's new job would not be
made until Bush returned at the end of
the week from his eight-day trip to Europe
and the Persian Gulf.
