# Gorbachev invites Pope to U.S.S.R.

ROME (AP) â€” Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev said yesterday he is convinced there is a
peaceful way out of the Persian Gulf crisis and that
"new ideas" have emerged to avert war.
Efforts for a political solution in the gulf figured
prominently in Gorbachev's brief stay in Rome and
his talks with Pope John Paul 11, who said he was
praying the world will be spared the "horrors" of a
military conflict.
Gorbachev renewed his invitation to the Polish
born pope, first made during their historic talks a
year ago, for a papal visit to the Soviet Union.
The pope later told reporters he hoped to go but
would not commit himself to a date.
"The right moment will come," said John Paul,
whose efforts for religious freedom contributed to
the revolutionary changes in Eastern Europe.
Vatican officials said the trip could not take place
before 1992, stressing that the Vatican first needs to
assess the number of priests and bishops and the
overall state of the church in the Soviet Union.
For Gorbachev, who was greeted by large and
friendly crowds, his brief stop gave him a respite
from his political and economic troubles at home.
He signed a 20-year friendship treaty with Italy
which includes a non-aggression clause, won com
mitments of nearly $5 billion over five years in sup
port for the Soviet economy, and received a $450,000
human rights prize from an Italian foundation
backed by a mineral water company.
Much of his day was spent in talks on the crisis
caused by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
After signing the friendship treaty at the Quirinal
presidential palace, Gorbachev said it was a "test"
for the international community to try to resolve the
gulf crisis peacefully.
"I am convinced that we will succeed in finding a
way out of this deep crisis," he said, speaking in
Russian which was translated into Italian.
"There are new ideas which need to be examined.
We are headed to the quest of a solution to this grave
crisis which involves everyone."
Gorbachev did not elaborate on the new ideas. His
spokesman, Vitaly Ignatenko, said they were dis
cussed in the private talks between Gorbachev and
Premier Giulio Andreotti.
