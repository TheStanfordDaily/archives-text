# Arabs kill suspect before school kids
## 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) â€” A Palestinian
headmaster was shot dead in front of his
pupils in a schoolyard yesterday for
allegedly collaborating with Israel, Arab
reports said.
Another Arab was killed in the occu
pied West Bank village of Jabaa by
armed Palestinians, the army said.
Masked assailants shot the headmas
ter, 31-year-old Saleh Salem Hyazi, in
the head as he finished an English les
son and was leaving the class in the
Rabah el Adaweyeh girls' high school in
the Gaza Strip town of Rafah, the
reports said. The army confirmed the
killing.
Graffiti painted on the school walls
claimed responsibility on behalf of a
group calling itself el-Fahed el-Aswad,
which means Black Leopard.

Itim, the Israeli news agency, said it
was the third time an alleged collabora
tor has been killed inside a Gaza Strip
school in recent months.
Arab reports said the assailants in
Jabaa were collaborators who were
armed by Israel to defend themselves.
The dead man was identified as Muham
mad Sharaim.
The deaths brought to 302 the num
ber of Arabs killed by fellow Palestini
ans, most on suspicion of collaborating
with Israel.
Some 773 Palestinians have been
killed by Israeli army and civilian gun
fire in the 35-month-old uprising. Fifty
two Israelis have died in the violence.
At least five Palestinians were
wounded by Israeli army gunfire in scat
tered stone-throwing riots in the occu

pied territories.
At the weekly Cabinet meeting, Eco
nomics Minister David Magen proposed
halving the Arab labor force in Israel by
fining employers who hire non-Israelis.
With unemployment running at 9
percent, Magen believed his proposal
would open 50,000 jobs for the coun
try's 92,000 people out of work, includ
ing 19,000 recently arrived Soviet immi
grants.
More than 100,000 Palestinians from
the occupied territories work in Israel.
According to Magen, about 70 percent of
them do not have the special work per
mits needed to prove they have no crim
inal or anti-Israel political background.
A spate of Arab knife attacks on Jews
has prompted calls for Arab workers to
be replaced by Soviet immigrants.
