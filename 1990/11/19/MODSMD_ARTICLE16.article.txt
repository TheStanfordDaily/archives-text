# Saddam says he will probably release all foreigners by March 25
## White House regards promise as hypocritical 
### 
Iraq promised yesterday to
release its remaining foreign
hostages over three months start
ing on Christmas unless some
thing "mars the atmosphere of
peace." President Bush said he
hoped for peace but left open the
prospect of war.
There has been speculation
that any military move to drive
Iraq out of Kuwait would take
place in the first several months of
the year, and the Iraqi offer to free
the hostages during that time
appeared aimed at staving off
such a strike.
Thousands of foreigners were
stranded by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion
of Kuwait, but hundreds have
since been selectively released by
the Baghdad government.
The latest mass departure was
yesterday, when 133 people left
Iraq for London on a U.S.*
arranged flight. Officials at the
U.S. Embassy in Baghdad said the
passengers included 76 Ameri
cans, many of them wives and
children of Kuwaiti nationals.
"I stayed as long as I could,"
said a woman from San Clemente,
Calif., who would not give her
name. "Kuwait went from the top
to total destruction."
The official Iraqi News Agency
said the decision to free the rest of

the hostages came at a meeting
presided over by Saddam. The for
eign "guests" — as it calls the
captives — would be allowed to
leave beginning Dec. 25, it said.
"The last batch .. . would leave
the Iraqi territories on March 25
unless something would take
place that mars the atmosphere of
peace," said the news agency.
The White House dismissed the
move as another ploy by Saddam,
and repeated its demand that all
the captives be unconditionally
freed.
White House press secretary
Marlin Fitzwater, in Paris with
the president, called the move a
"cynical attempt ... to manipu
late families' hopes and fears."
Western governments in the
past have denounced efforts by
Saddam to use the captives as
leverage in the gulf crisis.
In the mean time. Bush, in
Germany en route to Paris, con
ferred with Chancellor Helmut
Kohl about the anti-Iraq alliance,
which has assembled tens of thou
sands of troops in the gulf region.
Bush called on the German
leader to help "keep the coalition
together." Kohl, in a radio inter
view, underscored the need to do
everything possible to resolve the
crisis diplomatically before resort

ing to force.
Although Bush has spoken in
strong terms about the possibility
of a military strike, he played
down any differences of opinion.
"We're not ruling out any
options, we're not ruling any
options in,"he said.
Bush and Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev are going to
join leaders of 20 other nations in
Paris signing a conventional
forces treaty that reduces troop
and arms levels in Europe. From
Paris, Bush will fly to the Mideast
to spend Thanksgiving with U.S.
soldiers in the gulf region.
Former Nicaraguan President
Daniel Ortega, who met with King
Hussein yesterday, said the
monarch planned to meet Presi
dent Bush in Paris to discuss the
Persian Gulf crisis.
"They must look for a solution
through dialogue and negotia
tions," Ortega said of the two
leaders.
Jordanian Information Minis
ter Ibrahim Izzeddine refused to
confirm the report.
Hussein, whose country is
heavily reliant on Iraq and has
been hurt by the U.N. economic
sanctions, has been a self
appointed mediator for the crisis.
