## Football blessings 
### 
IN ONE OF THE MOST amaz
ing Big Games in history, Stan
ford capped a last-minute rally
with a 39-yard field goal with no
time remaining Saturday to over
power the Golden Bears, 27-25.
The game marked the fourth
year in a row Stanford has kept the
coveted Axe. It highlighted a sea
son of incredible football victories,
with upsets over Arizona and
Notre Dame.
But most of all, it redeemed
"The Play" of 1982, as Cal fans dis
covered their "victory" celebration
to be foolishly premature.
So, with Thanksgiving ap
proaching this week, let us give
thanks.
Thanks to Glyn Milburn, who
delivered a Pac-10 record 379 all
purpose yards.
Thanks to Jason Palumbis, who
motored the Cardinal down the
field with 13 plays in one minute
and 42 seconds.
Thanks to Ed McCaffrey, whose
second reception of the game in the
corner of the end zone put the Car
dinal behind by only a point.
Thanks to Denny Green for call
ing for the two-point conversion

attempt. Although the Cardinal
pass was intercepted by Cal's John
Hardy, Green's call showed pride
and confidence in the team.
Thanks to every single one of
the Cal fans who cascaded onto the
field with 12 seconds left.
Thanks to John Hopkins and
Kevin Scott for executing a perfect
onside kick and recovery, keeping
Stanford's hopes alive.
Thanks to John Belli, the Cal
lineman who leveled Palumbis
after his desperate errant throw,
causing the penalty which moved
the ball to the Cal 22-yard line.
Thanks again to Hopkins, whose
field goal with no time remaining
won the game for Stanford in dra
matic fashion.
Thanks to the Stanford Band
and Stanford fans for having the
sense to restrain their euphoria
until the clock ran out before flood
ing the field in celebration.
And thanks to the entire Stan
ford football team for a fantastic
finale to a truly incredible season.
Although the Cardinal ended the
season 5-6, 1990 will always be
remembered as a "winning" sea
son.
