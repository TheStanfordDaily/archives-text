# Fan free-for-all

Although this year's
game was both dramatic and
incredible, Stanford's come
from-behind victory was marred by
fans who took their emotions to
dangerous extremes.
Fans of both teams displayed
poor judgment and reprehensible
behavior even before the game
began. A biennial onslaught of
oranges was accompanied this year
by apples, tennis balls, frisbees,
water balloons and bananas.
The security force's lack of con
trol amid crushing stampedes onto
the field gave the upper hand to the

crowd's mob mentality. (Of course,
in future Big Games, if Cal fans
want to run onto the field before
the game ends, by all means let
them.)
However, it is ultimately the
fans' responsibility to keep Big
Game rivalry in the proper per
spective, concentrating on the foot
ball contest rather than personally
threatening one's rivals.
In the future, fans should let the
confrontations be kept to the foot
ball players. As evidenced by this
year's game, Big Game is an excit
ing enough without dangerous
antagonism.
