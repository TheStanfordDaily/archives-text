# Stanford files suit over logo
## 
### Kathy Ardalan 
Stanford has joined four other
universities in a lawsuit against a
company that allegedly made
unauthorized use of their logos.
Jon Sandelin, a senior associate
in the Office of Technology
Licensing, said he learned three
months ago that Tennessee-based
Jo Rose Originals was allegedly
selling counterfeited material
using logos of the five Universi
ties.
Administrators from Notre
Dame and USC learned of the
activity early this fall and asked
Stanford to participate a prelimi
nary investigation. UCLA and
Ohio State University are also
involved in the suit.
The case marks the first time
Stanford has taken civil legal
action against a trademark viola
tor. A similar case last year involv
ing a Canadian company's unau
thorized use of Stanford's logo
was prosecuted under Canadian
criminal laws, Sandelin said. The
company is no longer in business,
he noted.
The trademark lawyer for the
schools, Jeffrey Laytin, said in a
statement that "the trademarks,
trade names and logos of the five
universities are among their most
valuable assets."
If Laytin can prove Jo Rose
Originals used the logos with
"willful intent" of disobeying the
law, the company may be liable for
three times the damage, plus
attorney fees, Sandelin said.
He said the income Stanford
receives from licensing its trade
mark totals about $350,000 per
year, till of which goes to under
graduate financial aid. He
warned, "If we're not diligent

with our trademark, we'll lose
serious financial aid revenue."
On Oct. 29, U.S. District Court
Judge Thomas Higgins ordered
U.S. marshals and attorneys to
seize the counterfeited goods. The
confiscated material, worth about
$27,000, included low-quality T
shirts and sweatshirts with the
logos of the five universities.
Higgins gave a preliminary
injunction Nov. 8 prohibiting fur
ther sale of unlicensed merchan
dise by the company.
Sandelin said Jo Rose Originals
asked for a trademark license
application last year which it did
not complete.
