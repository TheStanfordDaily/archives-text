Alcohol policy hints at erosion of civil liberties

DID YOU SEE Wednesday's Daily
and in particular the back page?
Did you notice the "Stanford Uni
versity Controlled Substances and Alco
hol Policy?" Did you read it? Did you get
it? I hope so.
Remember, long ago, before the War
in the Middle East (more commonly
referred to as the "Gulf Crisis"), those
hallowed days of the "drug war?"
Well, those days are here, and maybe
here to stay.
Stanford's new polity is a direct result
of the federal government's "tough"
stance on drugs. So, what are the impli
cations? Maybe you will drink or smoke
in the privacy of your own room. But
what are the REAL implications?
Tiy this one out: the closing of the
American mind and the erosion of our
"inalienable" rights.
Where are we to turn to for unhin
dered intellectual pursuits — no longer
this university (nor any other). Now, I
suspect most people at Stanford don't
use "controlled substances," but does
that mean no one should? Does it mean
we should even leave the determination

I want a government that respects our rights as
individuals to seek knowledge or pleasure, with
or without chemical assistance. I want a govern
ment that represents you and me, not those
above the law.

of "controlled substances" to the govern
ment to dedde?
While numerous cultures throughout
the world provide a context in which the
use of "controlled substances" is socially
acceptable, you and I have been effec
tively robbed of the opportunity to expe
rience altered states of consciousness or
new perspectives.
If that's not offensive to you, imagine
how it will feel to have police officers
conduct a search of your room under the
pretense of looking for "drugs."
Never at Stanford? Look at the policy;
it reads simply, "Stanford is not a sanc
tuary from the enforcement of state and
local laws. Uniformed officers ... are

fully empowered and authorized to stop
vehicles, make arrests and enforce laws."
Look at the new policy. That is what
our government is doing to our rights as
outlined in the amendments to the Con
stitution.
What can we do? Forget Stanford and
the alcohol problem; we've bigger prob
lems to deal with. Maybe it's time we
took a critical look at the Constitution
and the present state of the government.
Maybe it's time for some changes.
How about reworking the presidential
branch in light of its mushrooming
power in the last half-centuiy, or
severely limiting contributions to candi

dates — you tell me.
Dare I even hark back to the words of
the Declaration of Independence, "That
whenever any Form of Government
becomes destructive to these ends (life,
liberty, the pursuit of happiness, and
government based on the consent of the
governed), it is the Right of the People to
alter or abolish it"?
We, yes, you and I, can change the
government. We have an obligation to do
so.
Too big, too entrenched, you say.
That's no excuse to let it become further
entrenched and rob us further of our
rights. Throughout history, the will of
the people has affected change.
I want a government that respects our
rights as individuals to seek knowledge
or pleasure, with or without chemical
assistance. I want a government that
represents you and me, not those above
the law. I want a government that lets us
live, not tells us how to live.
Look at the new poiicy again, please.
Now do you get it?
