# Graduate theme house explores multiculturalism
## 
### 
WE WERE DISAPPOINTED to
find that The Daily did not
include our home, the Graduate
Multicultural Theme House, in its cover
age of theme houses here on campus.
Rather than criticizing The Daily for
accidental exclusion of our house, or for
its limited emphasis on graduate inter
ests, we hereby write this letter to say we
exist.
We are the Graduate Multicultural
Theme House, a multicultural communi
ty located in the Rains Houses, whose
purpose is to support international and

American ethnic minority graduate stu
dents.
The house began this year as the first
ever graduate theme house at Stanford.
It arose from a need to have a supportive
living environment for minority graduate
students and create a campus communi
ty for anyone interested specifically in
issues of multiculturalism.
The house has been successful in cre
ating a place where graduate students
can freely discuss issues of race, culture
and ethnicity. Multiculturalism takes on
a real meaning in our house, thanks to
the diversity of individuals who live here

or visit. It has become a central meeting
place for many campus organizations
who are concerned with pluralistic grad
uate student interests.
To expand our vision, despite a limited
amount of time, we are sponsoring a
variety of programs. For example, our
house is developing a mentor program
for Stanford undergraduates to encour
age underrepresented peoples into gradu
ate schools here and throughout the
world. Later in the year, we will sponsor
campuswide events to celebrate and
explore our ethnic diversity.
Though far from perfect, our house

seeks to create bridges between the
diverse groups which make up our uni
versity. The house seeks to deal with the
changing needs of a world society directly
by creating a microcosm of a positively
interactive pluralistic community.
During our first year of existence at
Stanford, we would like to remind our
local community that as graduate stu
dents, we also care deeply about multi
culturalism and we are willing to live out
the experience.
