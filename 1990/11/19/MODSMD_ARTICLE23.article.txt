## We all need more hugs 
### 
STANFORD SHOULD INSTITUTE
some kind of hug therapy. I'm sure
that we would all perform better in
our classes and be more emotionally
healthy to boot.
I hadn't really thought about the idea
before a late-night dorm conversation I
was involved in yesterday.
Somebody said he was bothered
because he hadn't enjoyed very many
good hugs during the two months he's
been here. Quite a few others in the con
versation echoed his sentiments.
Then it occurred to me that I, too, have
had substantially fewer hugs at school
than at home. In fact, I've been walking
around in a sort of bubble ever since I left
home, with little physical contact with
anyone.
I've noticed that everyone is like that
to an extent. For example, I have a Cul
tures, Ideas and Values class that meets
in the lounge of the dorm instead of in a
classroom. We sit either on the floor or
the couches.
Many, including myself, are careful to
leave a pocket of space around them
selves. And if two people happen to touch,
one or both individuals will adjust to
avoid further contact with the other.
It seems to me that this tendency
makes physical contact with another
human being rare.
Maybe this phenomenon is just more
pronounced among freshmen. For
instance, I don't think that I've really had
enough time yet to develop personal rela
tionships to the point that hugging is a
comfortable thing to do.
I'm not talking about limp, wimpy

hugs, either. Those don't count. I'm talk
ing about BIG bear (not Cal-associated, of
course) hugs where you try to squish the
other person. Well, not quite, but it's the
same idea.
But you can't really go around just
hugging people you hardly know. Hug
ging, after all, usually connotes some sort
of affection.
That's probably why you also can't
very well ask to be hugged if you just feel
like being hugged. The other person
would most likely think that you were
making some strange sort of come-on.
This is why I believe a Stanford hug
therapy center is necessary. Students
need a place to go where they can get hugs
without having to deal with all the emo
tional, sometimes romantic, implications
that usually come attached.
Sometimes you just need a good, solid
hug. It's not necessarily because you are
attracted to the hugger or huggee,
whichever way you want to look at it.
Sometimes, you just need to squish and
be squished.
In this sense, a teddy bear or other
stuffed animal performs half the function
of a hug rather well. They obviously don't
make judgments on you or try to inter
pret the implications or motives behind a
hug. They just eryoy it. They don't have a
choice. The only problem is that stuffed
animals don't hug back.
So the way I envision it, the Stanford
hug therapy center would staff people
who would perform the task of teddy
bears that hug back.
I can picture myself staggering to the
center after a disastrous midterm, or

some other like catastrophe, and telling
the grandmotherly receptionist that I was
sorely in need of an emergency hug. I
would give her the whole sob story about
how I had gone back to my dorm and
found everyone missing.
She would then give me a cup of hot
cocoa while she looked for a staff hugger.
I would emerge from the therapy cen
ter consoled and rejuvenated. Life would
be breathed, or hugged, rather, back into
me.
I remember some study that shows
how babies who are touched and held a lot
grow up to be better-adjusted and more
emotionally stable than babies who aren't
exposed to as much physical human con
tact. The latter babies, if I recall correctly,
tend to be more reclusive, high-strung
and irritable.
I don't see why the same principle
wouldn't apply to people in general, irre
spective of age. It would follow that stu
dents who are exposed to a lot of hugs
would not only be happier but perform
better in school than those who aren't.
I think it would behoove Stanford,
then, to invest in hug therapy for the sake
of higher education.

infrequently. Her column appears every
