## Experience with Greeks, theme houses contradicts viewpoint 
### 
Although wilfred stone's
Nov. 12 viewpoint did raise several
issues that should be dealt with,
many of his points are inaccurate.
Having grown up with the influence
of many different cultures in Hawaii, I
was initially opposed to the idea of theme
houses and, to a large extent, fraterni
ties.
I was randomly placed in Casa Zapata,
the Chicano and Mexican-American
theme house, my freshman year, which
honestly made me quite apprehensive
because of my opposition to separate
housing. I quickly changed my mind,
however, once I arrived at Stanford.
While I found many of Stanford's

"multicultural" policies to be counter
productive, I was very impressed with
the way in which Zapata dealt with its
status as a "theme" house.
I was openly welcomed and encour
aged to participate in dorm activities and
felt very comfortable, even though I am
white.
In no way did I feel excluded "through
... pressure of numbers," nor was I
forced to be Chicano or anything besides
what I wanted to be. I attended many
functions out of personal interest, but I
was in no way made to feel guilty if I did
not attend or participate. Zapata also
offers to "usual" dorm functions (broom
ball, study breaks, etc.) making it a home

that simply had more opportunities than
a "regular dorm might.
Although I cannot speak for other
theme houses out of personal experience,
Zapata is truly a family that welcomes all
and which I will always be a part of.
As a member of Sigma Phi Epsilon, I
would also like to comment on some of
Stone's statements about fraternities.
Again, I will cede that there are excep
tions that fit his descriptions, and I will
speak only from personal experience.
I rushed primarily out of curiosity,
since I didn't feel that I would like a fra
ternity for similar, although not as
strong, feelings as Stone's.
Fraternities offer an opportunity for

people of similar interests to bond in a
group that will always be with them,
something that is often difficult at a uni
versity where everyone is very busy and
annual Draws often break up friends.
Although many fraternities have had
problems with sex and alcohol, I think it
is a dangerous generalization to claim
that fraternal "culture [is] rooted in
elitism and devoted to alcohol and sex."
Although I will not describe my sex
life, I strongly object to anyone claiming
I am devoted to sex, and as far as being
devoted to alcohol — I don't drink alco
hol, period. Admittedly, I am in the
minority on the latter point, but I don't
think I would feel as welcomed in the

fraternal system as I am if Stone's
claims were accurate.
Rather than canceling fraternities or
theme houses, more people should rush
and talk to fraternity members and find
out for themselves that fraternities are
not as Stone claims. Like other parts of
American society, fraternities have been
exclusionary based on race and creed in
the past, but today this is the exception,
not the rule.
Theme houses should also be oriented
as Zapata is, with a mixture of requests
and randoms and people of different cul
tures.
