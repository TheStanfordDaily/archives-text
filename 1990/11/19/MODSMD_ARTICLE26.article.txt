# Open-minded students will find that fraternities have much to offer
## 
### 
The generalized attack on
fraternities and sororities in Prof.
Wilfred Stone's Nov. 12 viewpoint
was quite disturbing.
The generalities and unsubstantiated
charges, however, were not what
distressed us the most; rather, it was the
complete lack of faith in the judgment
and wisdom of the Stanford student
body.
Rather than let students judge the
contribution a fraternity or a sorority
will make to their development for them
selves, Stone would eliminate all these
organizations and opportunities by his
fiat.
The Executive Board of the Interfra
ternity Council, on the other hand, does
not pretend to have all the answers, nor

do we maintain that what is best for one
individual is the right thing for another.
In contrast to Stone, we urge those in
the Stanford community to make up
their own minds and draw their own
conclusions. In short, we urge all fresh
men and interested upperclassmen to be
open-minded.
Come by a fraternity house for dinner,
talk to the guys about politics, philoso
phy or sports, ask questions of the Greek
who is your teaching assistant, investi
gate the skill development that fraterni
ties offer, be critical and skeptical.
We'll answer all of your questions
honestly — challenge our words — then
make an informed decision.
We think you'll like what we have to
offer. We can compete with any group on

campus in academic performance, com
munity service, athletics or leadership on
campus.
Many of our fraternities have a defi
nite over-representation of Phi Beta
Kappa members, and some have average
GPAs of more than 3.5. Virtually all put
in more time on community service pro
jects than the most ambitious dorms.
Virtually all student organizations
have Greek members at the very top of
their organizations, from the Stanford
Democrats to the College Republicans,
from The Daily to The Review and from
KZSIJ to the Stanford Directory.
In fact, nearly one-third of those
Stanford graduates will have been a
member of a Greek organization; most
will cite this as one of their most positive
experiences on campus. The reasons are

simple.
Many national fraternities promise to
make you a better person by joining.
While this may sound strange at first
glance, a careful look indicates that even
the most talented among us will proba
bly gain something from membership.
Seniors currently interviewing for
jobs are practicing many of the same
interpersonal communication skills
developed during Rush. Officers respon
sible for budgets and fund raising are
putting those experiences to work in the
real world.
Members involved in community ser
vice are probably in demand for their
motivational talents, and students who
have volunteered their time as a presi
dent probably possess more leadership
ability than could possibly be gained

from a classroom anywhere.
But all members of fraternities will
leave Stanford with something very few
other living arrangements or organiza
tions can hope to provide: a lifelong bond
with 40 to 60 fellow students. How
many non-Greek members of dorms will
leave Stanford and be able share their
most important problems, intimate expe
riences and greatest achievements with a
network like that?
Things like these may be just as valu
able as anything that can be taught in
Prof. Stone's classes.
