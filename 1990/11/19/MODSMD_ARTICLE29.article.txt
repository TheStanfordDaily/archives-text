## Just your typical Big Game finish 
### David Earnest Senior Staff Writer 
BERKELEY — Anyone who
thinks that football is played only
by the 22 players on the field has
obviously never seen a Big Game.
In Saturday's Big Game, the
93rd matchup between rivals Cal
ifornia and Stanford, the outcome
was decided not only by the Cardi
nal and Golden Bear players but
by the officials and, most impor
tantly, the California fans as well.
Golden Bear rooters from the
student section poured onto the
Astroturf at Memorial Stadium
with :12 remaining in the contest
when Stanford failed on a two
point conversion attempt. Coming
after a 87-yard, 14-play touch
down drive in the last 1:54 of the
game to pull Stanford within one
point at 25-24, the failed conver
sion appeared to preserve victory
and regain the Axe for California.
Or so the jubiliant Berkeley
fans thought. But as the Califor
nia players and fans mixed and
celebrated on the field, the offici
ating crew for the game, headed
by referee Pat Flood, was assess
ing an unsportsman like conduct
penalty against the Golden Bears
for the on-fleld celebration.
"The rule states that if the
team, which includes substitutes,
coaches, band members and
cheerleaders, comes on the field, a
penalty can be assessed," Flood
said after the game. "We can't
penalize the crowd."
So the team was penalized.
That 15-yard penalty allowed
Stanford to kick off from midfield
instead of the 35-yard line. When
Cardinal senior cornerback Kevin
Scott fell on place kicker John
Hopkins' onside kick at the Cal 37
with :09 remaining, Stanford was
nearly in range for the game-win
ning field goal instead of in their
own half of the field.
Stanford Coach Denny Green
opted to run one play before
attempting the 54-yard field goal,
hoping to shave some distance off
of the attempt. Quarterback
Jason Palumbis dropped back to
pass and quickly hurled the ball
out of bounds over receiver Ed
McCaffrey's hands to kill the
clock. But Bear nose guard John
Belli tackled Palumbis late and
Flood tossed his penalty flag
again.
The Bears were assessed a 15-
yard roughing the quarterback
penalty, which moved the ball
from the California 37 to the 22.
Instead of attempting a difficult
54-yard field goal, Hopkins came
onto the field to attempt a 39-
yarder after California called a
time-out.
When Hopkins' kick, a team
record fifth field goal in a game,
split the uprights as time expired,
it was the Stanford fans' turn to
celebrate on the floor of Memorial
Stadium.
"I was just blocking everything
out of my mind and I just tried to
keep my mind on getting the ball
downfield," Hopkins said on the
field as he celebrated with Stan
ford players and fans afterward.
"They called a timeout and gave
me a few extra minutes to warm
up. I didn't know [if it was good]. I
just kept my head down and then
looked up. I thought it might drift
right."
But it didn't and Stanford cele
brated the most improbable vic
tory in Big Game since the 1982
contest which California won with
"The Play," a five-lateral kickofT
return for the game-winning
touchdown with no time remain
ing.
"We just kept our heads in
there and kept hanging in," an
exhausted senior offensive guard
Chuck Gillingham said on the
field amid the Cardinal fans.
"Unbelievable. Oh my god. Oh my
god. It really ain't over till it's
over."
"[The California fans] were
extremely excited. It was that type
of game," Green said. "We were
fortunate. I'm not denying that.
But when they're getting ready to
play the hundred and third or
hundred and fourth Big Game,
they're not going to look back and
say 'They were lucky.' They're
going to look back and say 'They
9 99
won.
Though the penalty against the
California fans gave Stanford
advantageous field position for
the kickofT following the failed
two-point conversion, Hopkins'
onside kick, a non-call by the ref
erees and the roughing the passer

penalty helped the Cardinal win
the game.
The onside kick, after slipping
through the hands of two Stan
ford players and then off of a Cal
ifornia player, was recovered by
Scott "about a foot" from the side
line, according to Scott. The
senior cornerback also thought
that his feet might have been out
of bounds when he recovered the
ball, though he is certain his
knees and torso were in.
"It was about to go out of
bounds and I got my hands on it. I
just got up and ran before [the ref
eree] could change his mind,"
Scott said.
That non-call was followed by
the roughing-the-passer penalty
on the next play to put Stanford in
field-goal position.
"I didn't see [the late hit] com
ing — it was a blind-side shot.
Right as I got up I saw the flag so
I was happy," Palumbis said. "The
referees ref and I play. He made
the call and I'm not going to ques
tion it."
In any case, Hopkins' winning
field goal consummated Stan
ford's eight-year mission to
avenge a similarly stunning loss to
California on The Play.
"This will give us some
momentum going into recruit
ing," said Green, who is going on a
fishing vacation in the South now
that the season is over. "I guaran
tee you'll relive this one. Every
one who watched this one loved
it."
"I think we deserved to win,"
Gillingham said outside the locker
room after the game. "Football
often doesn't go the way you think
you deserve. But today it just hap
pened to go that way.
"We're not going to apologize
for the fans on the field or the late
hit," he said. "We've had stuff like
that going against us all year. It's
about time it went our way."
Eight years later, revenge has
finally come the Cardinal's way.

finally come the Cardinal's way.
BERKELEY — Anyone who
thinks that football is played only
by the 22 players on the field has
obviously never seen a Big Game.
In Saturday's Big Game, the
93rd matchup between rivals Cal
ifornia and Stanford, the outcome
was decided not only by the Cardi
nal and Golden Bear players but
by the officials and, most impor
tantly, the California fans as well.
Golden Bear rooters from the
student section poured onto the
Astroturf at Memorial Stadium
with :12 remaining in the contest
when Stanford failed on a two
point conversion attempt. Coming
after a 87-yard, 14-play touch
down drive in the last 1:54 of the
game to pull Stanford within one
point at 25-24, the failed conver
sion appeared to preserve victory
and regain the Axe for California.
Or so the jubiliant Berkeley
fans thought. But as the Califor
nia players and fans mixed and
celebrated on the field, the offici
ating crew for the game, headed
by referee Pat Flood, was assess
ing an unsportsman like conduct
penalty against the Golden Bears
for the on-fleld celebration.
"The rule states that if the
team, which includes substitutes,
coaches, band members and
cheerleaders, comes on the field, a
penalty can be assessed," Flood
said after the game. "We can't
penalize the crowd."
So the team was penalized.
That 15-yard penalty allowed
Stanford to kick off from midfield
instead of the 35-yard line. When
Cardinal senior cornerback Kevin
Scott fell on place kicker John
Hopkins' onside kick at the Cal 37
with :09 remaining, Stanford was
nearly in range for the game-win
ning field goal instead of in their
own half of the field.
Stanford Coach Denny Green
opted to run one play before
attempting the 54-yard field goal,
hoping to shave some distance off
of the attempt. Quarterback
Jason Palumbis dropped back to
pass and quickly hurled the ball
out of bounds over receiver Ed
McCaffrey's hands to kill the
clock. But Bear nose guard John
Belli tackled Palumbis late and
Flood tossed his penalty flag
again.
The Bears were assessed a 15-
yard roughing the quarterback
penalty, which moved the ball
from the California 37 to the 22.
Instead of attempting a difficult
54-yard field goal, Hopkins came
onto the field to attempt a 39-
yarder after California called a
time-out.
When Hopkins' kick, a team
record fifth field goal in a game,
split the uprights as time expired,
it was the Stanford fans' turn to
celebrate on the floor of Memorial
Stadium.
"I was just blocking everything
out of my mind and I just tried to
keep my mind on getting the ball
downfield," Hopkins said on the
field as he celebrated with Stan
ford players and fans afterward.
"They called a timeout and gave
me a few extra minutes to warm
up. I didn't know [if it was good]. I
just kept my head down and then
looked up. I thought it might drift
right."
But it didn't and Stanford cele
brated the most improbable vic
tory in Big Game since the 1982
contest which California won with
"The Play," a five-lateral kickofT
return for the game-winning
touchdown with no time remain
ing.
"We just kept our heads in
there and kept hanging in," an
exhausted senior offensive guard
Chuck Gillingham said on the
field amid the Cardinal fans.
"Unbelievable. Oh my god. Oh my
god. It really ain't over till it's
over."
"[The California fans] were
extremely excited. It was that type
of game," Green said. "We were
fortunate. I'm not denying that.
But when they're getting ready to
play the hundred and third or
hundred and fourth Big Game,
they're not going to look back and
say 'They were lucky.' They're
going to look back and say 'They
9 99
won.
Though the penalty against the
California fans gave Stanford
advantageous field position for
the kickofT following the failed
two-point conversion, Hopkins'
onside kick, a non-call by the ref
erees and the roughing the passer

penalty helped the Cardinal win
the game.
The onside kick, after slipping
through the hands of two Stan
ford players and then off of a Cal
ifornia player, was recovered by
Scott "about a foot" from the side
line, according to Scott. The
senior cornerback also thought
that his feet might have been out
of bounds when he recovered the
ball, though he is certain his
knees and torso were in.
"It was about to go out of
bounds and I got my hands on it. I
just got up and ran before [the ref
eree] could change his mind,"
Scott said.
That non-call was followed by
the roughing-the-passer penalty
on the next play to put Stanford in
field-goal position.
"I didn't see [the late hit] com
ing — it was a blind-side shot.
Right as I got up I saw the flag so
I was happy," Palumbis said. "The
referees ref and I play. He made
the call and I'm not going to ques
tion it."
In any case, Hopkins' winning
field goal consummated Stan
ford's eight-year mission to
avenge a similarly stunning loss to
California on The Play.
"This will give us some
momentum going into recruit
ing," said Green, who is going on a
fishing vacation in the South now
that the season is over. "I guaran
tee you'll relive this one. Every
one who watched this one loved
it."
"I think we deserved to win,"
Gillingham said outside the locker
room after the game. "Football
often doesn't go the way you think
you deserve. But today it just hap
pened to go that way.
"We're not going to apologize
for the fans on the field or the late
hit," he said. "We've had stuff like
that going against us all year. It's
about time it went our way."
Eight years later, revenge has
finally come the Cardinal's way.
