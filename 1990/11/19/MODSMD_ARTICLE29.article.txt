## Just your typical Big Game finish 
### David Earnest Senior Staff Writer 
BERKELEY â€” Anyone who
thinks that football is played only
by the 22 players on the field has
obviously never seen a Big Game.
In Saturday's Big Game, the
93rd matchup between rivals Cal
ifornia and Stanford, the outcome
was decided not only by the Cardi
nal and Golden Bear players but
by the officials and, most impor
tantly, the California fans as well.
Golden Bear rooters from the
student section poured onto the
Astroturf at Memorial Stadium
with :12 remaining in the contest
when Stanford failed on a two
point conversion attempt. Coming
after a 87-yard, 14-play touch
down drive in the last 1:54 of the
game to pull Stanford within one
point at 25-24, the failed conver
sion appeared to preserve victory
and regain the Axe for California.
Or so the jubiliant Berkeley
fans thought. But as the Califor
nia players and fans mixed and
celebrated on the field, the offici
ating crew for the game, headed
by referee Pat Flood, was assess
ing an unsportsman like conduct
penalty against the Golden Bears
for the on-fleld celebration.
"The rule states that if the
team, which includes substitutes,
coaches, band members and
cheerleaders, comes on the field, a
penalty can be assessed," Flood
said after the game. "We can't
penalize the crowd."
So the team was penalized.
That 15-yard penalty allowed
Stanford to kick off from midfield
instead of the 35-yard line. When
Cardinal senior cornerback Kevin
Scott fell on place kicker John
Hopkins' onside kick at the Cal 37
with :09 remaining, Stanford was
nearly in range for the game-win
ning field goal instead of in their
own half of the field.
Stanford Coach Denny Green
opted to run one play before
attempting the 54-yard field goal,
hoping to shave some distance off
of the attempt. Quarterback
Jason Palumbis dropped back to
pass and quickly hurled the ball
out of bounds over receiver Ed
McCaffrey's hands to kill the
clock. But Bear nose guard John
Belli tackled Palumbis late and
Flood tossed his penalty flag
again.
The Bears were assessed a 15-
yard roughing the quarterback
penalty, which moved the ball
from the California 37 to the 22.
Instead of attempting a difficult
54-yard field goal, Hopkins came
onto the field to attempt a 39-
yarder after California called a
time-out.
When Hopkins' kick, a team
record fifth field goal in a game,
split the uprights as time expired,
