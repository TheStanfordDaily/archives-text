# Card crushes outmanned Oregon for 10th straight win
## 
### Harold Yu Staff writer 
The Oregon Ducks knew they
were in trouble the minute they
got out of their cars in front of
Burnham Pavilion Thursday
night.
Prior to Friday night's confer
ence volleyball match, the Ducks
came to watch a bit of the Cardi
nal's contest against Oregon State
Thursday Before they even got
inside, however, their one eligible
setter, Molly McGrath, fell over
the pavement and sprained her
ankle while attempting to enter
Burnham. Her teammates fol
lowed suit shortly thereafter,
stumbling shamefully before
Stanford's high-flying women's
volleyball team.
The No. 3 Cardinal (24-3, 16-2
in Pacific 10 Conference play)
cruised to its 10th consecutive vic
tory, tripping up the hobbled Ore
gon Ducks 15-5, 15-7, 15-7. Stan
ford has one match remaining in
the regular season and is on track
to record the third-best season
record in team history.
Before a television broadcast,
sophomores Bev Oden and Kristi
Paaso furnished Oregon with a
brutal welcome to the Farm. Oden
had match-highs of 14 kills and
three blocks while hitting .619.
Paaso, who recently recovered
from injury, hit .727 and collected
eight kills, four digs and two
blocks.
As a team, Stanford hit .432
and made only seven total attack
errors on the night. Oregon mean
while had its problems. The
Duck's six starters had only eight
more kills than Oden for the
entire match. Two of their players
hit .000, one hit negatively and

"There are no excuses
tonight," Oregon coach Gerry
Gregory said. "1 thought Stanford
played awfully well. They caused
some problems for our team. I
would have liked to have chal
lenged them more for their vic
tory."
Considering the circumstances,
there is little he should be
ashamed of. Their setter McGrath
had to play because her backup,
Kalie Kerr, is redshirting this
year. McGrath's mobility was
noticeably hampered. She was
unable to retrieve a number of her
team's passes.
Her 6-foot blockers had their
problems too as Oregon faced four
of the top seven percentage hitters
in the conference. Oden, Ail-
American Kristin Klein, All-Pac
-10 Amy Cooper and senior Jessica
Benton had target practice with
the Oregon diggers. Oden
smashed two poor Ducks in the
face during the contest.
But the Ducks trudged bravely

ahead. Oregon led 2-1 in game one
before trading a number of side
outs with the Cardinal. The Ducks
served aggressively, forcing sev
eral misdirected passes.
"They're a tough serving
team," Stanford coach Don Shaw
said. "They served some bullets
out there. It took us a while to get
rolling."
The question, however, was not
if the Cardinal would get rolling
but when. Klein answered that
query rather swiftly. The outside
hitter reversed the early trend
with two consecutive kills. She
finished with seven kills and a
.384 hitting percentage. Oden
hammered an overpass and the
Cardinal led 5-2.
McGrath couldn't catch a
break all night long. At 5-10, she
collided with a teammate while
attempting to get to a ball. Benton
showed little mercy, subsequently
pounding three more kills. The
Cardinal coasted on a 6-0 game
ending run.
Oregon began to look exceed
ingly helpless as they fell behind
1-8 in the second game. They
found out that losing wasn't pain
less either. One of Oden's kills
during the run knocked a
defender over. Paaso, who had
entered in game one, struck two
kills to fuel the streak.
"I felt pretty good," Paaso said.
"Oregon is a good team to get
some playing time against. I was
relaxed. Physically, I think I'm
still improving."
Freshman setter Piper Hahn
entered the match and promptly
aced the Ducks. Under her direc
tion, the Cardinal sprayed numer
ous balls onto the Oregon turf.
Oden had a monstrous kill at 10-

( l think they're playing
as well as anyone in
the country right now.

5, Paaso added two more and then
Hahn executed a deceptive dump.
When Klein smoked another ball
past several blockers, the Cardinal
led 13-6.
"I think we played pretty well,"
Hahn said. "We didn't get into
many ruts. Right now we're on
the upswing."
Shaw himself was confident
enough of that to relieve some of
his starters in the third game.
Senior Cheryl Conly came on to
anchor the defense while junior
middle blocker Nicole Appleman
and freshman Heidi Eick under
took much of the offense.
The Cardinal led 10-1 before
letting Oregon quack back into
the affair. "You have to give credit
to Stanford," Gregory said. "I
think they're playing as well as
anyone in the country right now.
They're a very good team. They
did some good things."
If the good things continue, the
Cardinal will finish the season
ranked third in the nation. The
team will play in the Western
Regional of the NCAA tourna
ment and would likely meet No. 1
UCLA in the finals. The champion
of the regional will advance to the
Final Four in Maryland.
The last match of Stanford's
season will be Tuesday against
No. 10 San Jose State. The Spar
tans defeated the Cardinal last
year in San Jose. Earlier this sea
son, San Jose State defeated No. 5
University of the Pacific.

enough of that to relieve some of

The Cardinal led 10-1 before
letting Oregon quack back into
the affair. "You have to give credit
to Stanford," Gregory said. "I

They're a very good team. They
did some good things."
If the good things continue, the
Cardinal will finish the season
ranked third in the nation. The
team will play in the Western
Regional of the NCAA tourna
ment and would likely meet No. 1
UCLA in the finals. The champion
of the regional will advance to the
Final Four in Maryland.
The last match of Stanford's
season will be Tuesday against
No. 10 San Jose State. The Spar
tans defeated the Cardinal last
year in San Jose. Earlier this sea
son, San Jose State defeated No. 5
University of the Pacific.

The Oregon Ducks knew they
were in trouble the minute they
got out of their cars in front of
Burnham Pavilion Thursday
night.
Prior to Friday night's confer
ence volleyball match, the Ducks
came to watch a bit of the Cardi
nal's contest against Oregon State
Thursday Before they even got
inside, however, their one eligible
setter, Molly McGrath, fell over
the pavement and sprained her
ankle while attempting to enter
Burnham. Her teammates fol
lowed suit shortly thereafter,
stumbling shamefully before
Stanford's high-flying women's
volleyball team.
The No. 3 Cardinal (24-3, 16-2
in Pacific 10 Conference play)
cruised to its 10th consecutive vic
tory, tripping up the hobbled Ore
gon Ducks 15-5, 15-7, 15-7. Stan
ford has one match remaining in
the regular season and is on track
to record the third-best season
record in team history.
Before a television broadcast,
sophomores Bev Oden and Kristi
Paaso furnished Oregon with a
brutal welcome to the Farm. Oden
had match-highs of 14 kills and
three blocks while hitting .619.
Paaso, who recently recovered
from injury, hit .727 and collected
eight kills, four digs and two
blocks.
As a team, Stanford hit .432
and made only seven total attack
errors on the night. Oregon mean
while had its problems. The
Duck's six starters had only eight
more kills than Oden for the
entire match. Two of their players
hit .000, one hit negatively and

"There are no excuses
tonight," Oregon coach Gerry
Gregory said. "1 thought Stanford
played awfully well. They caused
some problems for our team. I
would have liked to have chal
lenged them more for their vic
tory."
Considering the circumstances,
there is little he should be
ashamed of. Their setter McGrath
had to play because her backup,
Kalie Kerr, is redshirting this
year. McGrath's mobility was
noticeably hampered. She was
unable to retrieve a number of her
team's passes.
Her 6-foot blockers had their
problems too as Oregon faced four
of the top seven percentage hitters
in the conference. Oden, Ail-
American Kristin Klein, All-Pac
-10 Amy Cooper and senior Jessica
Benton had target practice with
the Oregon diggers. Oden
smashed two poor Ducks in the
face during the contest.
But the Ducks trudged bravely

ahead. Oregon led 2-1 in game one
before trading a number of side
outs with the Cardinal. The Ducks
served aggressively, forcing sev
eral misdirected passes.
"They're a tough serving
team," Stanford coach Don Shaw
said. "They served some bullets
out there. It took us a while to get
rolling."
The question, however, was not
if the Cardinal would get rolling
but when. Klein answered that
query rather swiftly. The outside
hitter reversed the early trend
with two consecutive kills. She
finished with seven kills and a
.384 hitting percentage. Oden
hammered an overpass and the
Cardinal led 5-2.
McGrath couldn't catch a
break all night long. At 5-10, she
collided with a teammate while
attempting to get to a ball. Benton
showed little mercy, subsequently
pounding three more kills. The
Cardinal coasted on a 6-0 game
ending run.
Oregon began to look exceed
ingly helpless as they fell behind
1-8 in the second game. They
found out that losing wasn't pain
less either. One of Oden's kills
during the run knocked a
defender over. Paaso, who had
entered in game one, struck two
kills to fuel the streak.
"I felt pretty good," Paaso said.
"Oregon is a good team to get
some playing time against. I was
relaxed. Physically, I think I'm
