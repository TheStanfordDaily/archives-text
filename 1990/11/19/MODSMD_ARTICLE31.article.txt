The fat lady was already sitting in traffic trying to reach
the freeway when Stanford went in for the
touchdown that cut the Golden Bears' lead to one.
When she heard on the car radio that the Cardinal's
two-point conversion failed, she popped in a tape, unaware of
what was about to transpire. Cal's fans and players probably
would have eschewed the on-field celebration had they known
the 15-yard penalty they would accrue would be so costly. For as
the fat lady sped off into the night, Stanford not only recovered
the onside kick, the team picked up 15 more yards on another
penalty. That set the stage for John Hopkins to boot a 39-yard
field goal and boost the Cardinal to victory in the strangest Big
Game since 1982. It may never have a name as elegant as The
Play, but for Stanford it was just as sweet.
