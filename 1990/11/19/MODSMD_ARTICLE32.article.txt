# Fencers foil California
## 
### Amy Wusterbarth Staff writer 
Friday evening, while most of Stanford was
preparing for one of the greatest Big Games in
history, the men's and women's fencing teams
were initiating California's sting of defeat by
romping the Bears in Berkeley. The men won
foil 6-3, sabre 5-4 and epee 7-2 for a total score
of 18-9. The women defeated Cal by a score of
13-3.
Both men's and women's teams started
with their top fencers but quickly substituted
to let more inexperienced team members try
their hand in the competition.
"Our basic tactic was to make a big lead
right away and put the junior varsity in â€” we
got every fencer in," said men's coach Zoran
Tulum, We wanted them to get the flavor of a
big meet."
Women's coach Sherry Posthumus followed
the same strategy. "We used our first team for
the first round and then put in our JV fencers
so that we wouldn't hurt them too badly."
This matchup was more for fun because
California's fencing program is a club sport, as
opposed to Stanford s NCAA varsity program.
Fencer David Brody said, "We practice more
and do some recruiting. Berkeley is not a terri
bly tough team but they do have some good
fencers.
Some of these good fencers are graduate
students, an advantage that Stanford, as an
NCAA team, does not have. However, Stan
ford's junior varsity still managed to stop these
older fencers.
Stanford's win was especially impressive
because the top two Cardinal men did not com
pete. Nick Bravin, a junior, is last year's NCAA
foil champion. He is fencing in an interna
tional competition in London and aiming for a
spot on the 1992 Olympic team. Leonard
D'Amico, the men's top sabre fencer, is out
with a neck injury.
On the women's side, inexperienced fencers
also got a taste of competition after the top
four women, Lana Kang, Olivia Judson, Grace
Chang and Thea Wojtkowski, gave the team a
sizable lead.
"The match went very well,'' said team cap
tain Grace Chang, "Most of the fencers are
new to the team and they did pretty well."
This was one of several small meets which
will help the team gear up for two big meets
later in the season. "These are good morale
boosters," said Brody. "We get a chance to see
what kind of a team we have. This year looks
pretty good."
