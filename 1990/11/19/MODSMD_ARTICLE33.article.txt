# Basketball soars over High Five America
## Near-perfect shooting leads to 101-85 win 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
When a basketball team's starters miss a
grand total of two (yes, two) shots in the
first half of a game, it's a safe bet that
they're going to win.
The Stanford men's basketball team
made that bet pay off in a big way Friday
night, riding the momentum of a sizzling
first-half shooting performance to a 101-85
exhibition win over High Five America.

The victory over the run-'n'-get-gunned
AAU team completes the Cardinal's presea
son schedule. The team opens the regular
season this weekend in the Stanford Invita
tional, to be held Friday and Saturday
nights at Maples Pavilion.
Stanford's starters shot 19-for-21 in the
first half last Friday — for the record, for
ward Andrew Vlahov and guard Kenny
Ammann were the missed-shot culprits —
to pace the entire team to a 77 percent first
half clip. Adam Keefe made all seven of his
shots in the half and finished with a team
leading 22 points (he actually missed a shot
in the second) to go along with his four
rebounds and three assists.
Keefe's reaction to his performance?
"My defense was horrible,'' he said. Of
course. "I wasn't mentally into it. I could've
taken four charges, but I came away with
with none. My men were all over me on the
boards."
Stanford coach Mike Montgomery
wasn't very happy with the team's defense,
either. "We just didn't do a very good job,"
he said. "We shot 77 percent in the half, and
when you do that you should be up by more
than 13.... We need to do a better job
defensively and on the boards."
"It's just a mental thing with us," said
Ammann, who finished with 13 points on 5-
for-7 shooting (both misses were three
point attempts) to go along with his six
assists. "Everyone can play defense if they
really want to. We can't not be consistent..
.. We're not talented enough to just go out
and win."
They are talented enough, however, to
shoot like crazy. Ammann and Vlahov each
were 4-for-5 in the first half, while Keefe
and Deshon Win gate (4-for-4) were perfect.

Fifth starter John Patrick didn't take a
shot in the first half, but made all three of
his in the second. The unit finished the
game 28-for-34.
"The whole team is feeling more com
fortable than we were at this time last
year," Ammann said. "Last year weren't
sure what we could do — we weren't com
fortable with our roles. This year we are."
No Cardinal player was too comfortable
guarding High Five's Troy Lewis, who
drove and bombed for 27 points, slicing up
both the Cardinal's man and zone defenses.
When Lewis (a former Purdue star) was
open, he shot — and if he wasn't, well, he
usually shot it anyway: his 21 shots were as
many as any three of his teammates' totals
combined.
"There's no excuse for Lewis scoring
27," Montgomery said. "He's a good
shooter, but a lot of guys can shoot. We need
to play better defense on guys like him."
It was Lewis who kept High Five close at
the start — he had 17 at the half — but the
closest the Fivers (let's face it, this team
needs a nickname) would get to leading was
a 2-2 tie a minute into the game. Lewis kept
the game close until five minutes into the
second half when, with his team down 69-
81, the visitors' coach called timeout to
berate his players. ("Berate" is putting it
kindly, by the way.)
The pep talk worked wonders: in the
next six minutes the Cardinal went on a
tear, going up 89-58 and effectively puitting
the game away. Montgomery used just
about everyone on the bench, which
allowed the Fivers the chance to cut it to 15,
but that was at close as they'd get.
Montgomery wasn't in a mood to gush
about the win, however. "We can't be happy
beating a team like High Five by 16 and
thinking that's a milestone," he said.
"We've got a lot of work to do."

to play better defense on guys like him."
It was Lewis who kept High Five close at
the start — he had 17 at the half — but the
closest the Fivers (let's face it, this team
needs a nickname) would get to leading was
a 2-2 tie a minute into the game. Lewis kept
the game close until five minutes into the
second half when, with his team down 69-
81, the visitors' coach called timeout to
berate his players. ("Berate" is putting it
kindly, by the way.)
The pep talk worked wonders: in the
next six minutes the Cardinal went on a
tear, going up 89-58 and effectively puitting
the game away. Montgomery used just
about everyone on the bench, which
allowed the Fivers the chance to cut it to 15,
but that was at close as they'd get.
Montgomery wasn't in a mood to gush
about the win, however. "We can't be happy
beating a team like High Five by 16 and
thinking that's a milestone," he said.
"We've got a lot of work to do."

When a basketball team's starters miss a
grand total of two (yes, two) shots in the
first half of a game, it's a safe bet that
they're going to win.
The Stanford men's basketball team
made that bet pay off in a big way Friday
night, riding the momentum of a sizzling
first-half shooting performance to a 101-85
exhibition win over High Five America.

The victory over the run-'n'-get-gunned
AAU team completes the Cardinal's presea
son schedule. The team opens the regular
season this weekend in the Stanford Invita
tional, to be held Friday and Saturday
nights at Maples Pavilion.
Stanford's starters shot 19-for-21 in the
first half last Friday — for the record, for
ward Andrew Vlahov and guard Kenny
Ammann were the missed-shot culprits —
to pace the entire team to a 77 percent first
half clip. Adam Keefe made all seven of his
shots in the half and finished with a team
leading 22 points (he actually missed a shot
in the second) to go along with his four
rebounds and three assists.
Keefe's reaction to his performance?
"My defense was horrible,'' he said. Of
course. "I wasn't mentally into it. I could've
taken four charges, but I came away with
with none. My men were all over me on the
boards."
Stanford coach Mike Montgomery
wasn't very happy with the team's defense,
either. "We just didn't do a very good job,"
he said. "We shot 77 percent in the half, and
when you do that you should be up by more
than 13.... We need to do a better job
defensively and on the boards."
"It's just a mental thing with us," said
Ammann, who finished with 13 points on 5-
for-7 shooting (both misses were three
point attempts) to go along with his six
assists. "Everyone can play defense if they
really want to. We can't not be consistent..
.. We're not talented enough to just go out
and win."
They are talented enough, however, to
shoot like crazy. Ammann and Vlahov each
were 4-for-5 in the first half, while Keefe
and Deshon Win gate (4-for-4) were perfect.

Fifth starter John Patrick didn't take a
shot in the first half, but made all three of
his in the second. The unit finished the
game 28-for-34.
"The whole team is feeling more com
fortable than we were at this time last
year," Ammann said. "Last year weren't
sure what we could do — we weren't com
fortable with our roles. This year we are."
No Cardinal player was too comfortable
guarding High Five's Troy Lewis, who
drove and bombed for 27 points, slicing up
both the Cardinal's man and zone defenses.
When Lewis (a former Purdue star) was
open, he shot — and if he wasn't, well, he
usually shot it anyway: his 21 shots were as
many as any three of his teammates' totals
combined.
"There's no excuse for Lewis scoring
27," Montgomery said. "He's a good
shooter, but a lot of guys can shoot. We need
to play better defense on guys like him."
