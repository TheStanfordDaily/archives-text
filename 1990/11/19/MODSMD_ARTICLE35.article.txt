# Water polo closes season with Big Splash loss to Bears
## 
### Aden Fine Staff writer 
BERKELEY - At least Big
Game was fun.
The much anticipated Big
Splash water polo match between
Stanford and California, however,
was no fun at all for Cardinal fans.
Before a standing-room-only

crowd at Cal's Spieker Aquatics
Complex Saturday afternoon, the
No. 1-ranked Golden Bears easily
defeated No. 2 Stanford by a score
of 13-8. With the win, Cal won the
Pacific 10 Conference title. Stan
ford finished second.
Cal had already defeated the
Cardinal three times this year, but
coming into the game Stanford

seemed confident that it could
pull off an upset. The Bears
quickly put an end to these hopes,
however, scoring the first goal of
the game on their first possession.
This goal set the tone of the
match, as the Cardinal was never
able to overtake the top-ranked
Bears and never held a lead in the
entire game.

As coach Dante Dettamanti
said, "Part of the reason for the
lopsided game was that we didn't
play as well as we could, but Cal
also played incredibly well.
They're clearly a better team than
us right now."
Still, the first quarter was not
all that bad for the underdog Car
dined, which is now 24-6 on the
year. After the Cal goal, Chuck
Maguy came right back for Stan
ford on a nice backhand shot from
the hole position to tie the game
up. Then, after Berkeley's Chris
Oeding scored on a breakaway and
Chris Humbert added a goal,
Stanford's J.T. Matarangas, who
was starting his first game of the
year, launched a perfect skip shot
into the corner of the net to bring
his team back within one goal.
But with less than one minute
left in the quarter, Humbert
scored again to make the score 4-2
at the end of the opening period.
In fact, Humbert would continue
to score a lot more goals for the
rest of the day. By game's end, the
junior All-American from Lodi,
Calif, had tallied an amazing
seven goals to lead his team to the
victory.
Humbert opened up the sec
ond quarter with another goal,
but Rick McNair came back to
score the first of his two goals on
the day to make the score 5-3.
After Oeding scored again for the
Bears, junior Greg Morris tipped
in a rebound off a Maguy shot to
keep the Cardinal close at 6-4. But
then, everything fell apart for the
visitors.
Cal retaliated with a goal by

Pat Nelson, and with two seconds
left in the half, Humbert scored on
a 4-meter penalty shot after a con
troversial offensive foul on Stan
ford had led to a Cal breakaway.
"The penalty shot at the end of
the half really killed us," Detta
manti said. "That was the real
turning point in the game, and it
seemed to take the wind out of our
sails. It put us four down, instead
of only three, and that's a big dif
ference. It's possible to come back
from three goals down, but four,
well, that's almost impossible."
And it's even harder when
Humbert opens up the second half
with two more goals to put the
game out of reach at 10-4 midway
through the third quarter. In fact,
Stanford did not get another goal
until less than two minutes were
left in the quarter and McNair
managed to get a shot past Cal's
goalie.
Stanford did show some
improvement in the fourth quar
ter, however, as two reserves —
Morris and junior Shane Coons —
gave a little life to the team and
helped bring the score to 12-7.
After a couple of steals by Coons,
Morris scored two goals for his
team to give him three for the day.
That is as close as the score would
get, though, and there would be
no late-game miracles in this con
test.

Nevertheless, Dettamanti is
not that upset with the outcome
of the game. "It's disappointing,
but I'm happy with the effort the
guys put out. We tried hard the
whole game, even when it was no
longer a contest. The effort was
definitely there, but the execution
just wasn't."
One of the biggest problems for
the Cardinal was that its defense
was unable to stop the Cal offense.
Freshman goalie Larry Bercutt
had his worst game as a Cardinal,
and did not even pick up his first
save of the game until 2:25 was
left in the fourth quarter. He
ended up with two saves.
As Dettamanti said, "It's not
all Larry's fault. He had a bad
game, but so did the entire
defense. We just broke down in
almost every phase of our defense,
and you can't do that against a
team as good as Cal."
Despite the humbling loss,
Stanford may be able to use it as a
learning experience. As Maguy
said, "This game made us realize
that we're not as good as Cal is,
and we have a lot to work on if we
want to have a chance against
them."
In fact, the Cardinal may
indeed get another shot at the
Bears Nov. 25 in the NCAA cham
pionship game. Cal is seeded first
in the tournament and Stanford is
No. 2. If both teams win as they
are expected to, they will meet for
the national title. And as Detta
manti said, "We know that any
thing can happen in the NCAAs,
so this game won't matter at all."

left in the quarter, Humbert
scored again to make the score 4-2
at the end of the opening period.
In fact, Humbert would continue
to score a lot more goals for the
rest of the day. By game's end, the
junior All-American from Lodi,
Calif, had tallied an amazing
seven goals to lead his team to the
victory.
Humbert opened up the sec
ond quarter with another goal,
but Rick McNair came back to
score the first of his two goals on
the day to make the score 5-3.
After Oeding scored again for the
Bears, junior Greg Morris tipped
in a rebound off a Maguy shot to
keep the Cardinal close at 6-4. But
then, everything fell apart for the
visitors.

Pat Nelson, and with two seconds
left in the half, Humbert scored on
a 4-meter penalty shot after a con
troversial offensive foul on Stan
ford had led to a Cal breakaway.
"The penalty shot at the end of
the half really killed us," Detta
manti said. "That was the real
turning point in the game, and it
seemed to take the wind out of our
sails. It put us four down, instead
of only three, and that's a big dif
ference. It's possible to come back
from three goals down, but four,
well, that's almost impossible."
And it's even harder when
Humbert opens up the second half
with two more goals to put the
game out of reach at 10-4 midway
through the third quarter. In fact,
Stanford did not get another goal
until less than two minutes were
left in the quarter and McNair
managed to get a shot past Cal's
goalie.
Stanford did show some
improvement in the fourth quar
ter, however, as two reserves —
Morris and junior Shane Coons —
gave a little life to the team and
helped bring the score to 12-7.
After a couple of steals by Coons,
Morris scored two goals for his
team to give him three for the day.
That is as close as the score would
get, though, and there would be
no late-game miracles in this con
test.

Nevertheless, Dettamanti is
not that upset with the outcome
of the game. "It's disappointing,
but I'm happy with the effort the
guys put out. We tried hard the
whole game, even when it was no
longer a contest. The effort was
definitely there, but the execution
just wasn't."
One of the biggest problems for
the Cardinal was that its defense
was unable to stop the Cal offense.
Freshman goalie Larry Bercutt
had his worst game as a Cardinal,
and did not even pick up his first
save of the game until 2:25 was
left in the fourth quarter. He
ended up with two saves.
As Dettamanti said, "It's not
all Larry's fault. He had a bad
game, but so did the entire
defense. We just broke down in
almost every phase of our defense,
and you can't do that against a
team as good as Cal."
Despite the humbling loss,
Stanford may be able to use it as a
learning experience. As Maguy
said, "This game made us realize
that we're not as good as Cal is,
and we have a lot to work on if we
want to have a chance against
them."
In fact, the Cardinal may
indeed get another shot at the
Bears Nov. 25 in the NCAA cham
pionship game. Cal is seeded first
in the tournament and Stanford is
No. 2. If both teams win as they
are expected to, they will meet for
the national title. And as Detta
manti said, "We know that any
thing can happen in the NCAAs,
so this game won't matter at all."

BERKELEY - At least Big
Game was fun.
The much anticipated Big
Splash water polo match between
Stanford and California, however,
was no fun at all for Cardinal fans.
Before a standing-room-only

crowd at Cal's Spieker Aquatics
Complex Saturday afternoon, the
No. 1-ranked Golden Bears easily
defeated No. 2 Stanford by a score
of 13-8. With the win, Cal won the
Pacific 10 Conference title. Stan
ford finished second.
Cal had already defeated the
Cardinal three times this year, but
coming into the game Stanford

seemed confident that it could
pull off an upset. The Bears
quickly put an end to these hopes,
however, scoring the first goal of
the game on their first possession.
This goal set the tone of the
match, as the Cardinal was never
able to overtake the top-ranked
Bears and never held a lead in the
entire game.

As coach Dante Dettamanti
said, "Part of the reason for the
lopsided game was that we didn't
play as well as we could, but Cal
also played incredibly well.
They're clearly a better team than
us right now."
Still, the first quarter was not
all that bad for the underdog Car
dined, which is now 24-6 on the
year. After the Cal goal, Chuck
Maguy came right back for Stan
ford on a nice backhand shot from
the hole position to tie the game
up. Then, after Berkeley's Chris
Oeding scored on a breakaway and
Chris Humbert added a goal,
Stanford's J.T. Matarangas, who
was starting his first game of the
year, launched a perfect skip shot
into the corner of the net to bring
his team back within one goal.
But with less than one minute
left in the quarter, Humbert
scored again to make the score 4-2
at the end of the opening period.
In fact, Humbert would continue
to score a lot more goals for the
rest of the day. By game's end, the
