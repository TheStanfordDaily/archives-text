# Fate is finally on the side of the Cardinal

For as long as I can remember, I've
been a New York Giants fan. Each
Sunday, pulling for the boys in blue
has been a passion — and a curse.
You see, no matter how big the lead, no
matter how little time is left on the clock,
a Giants fan is always certain his team is
going to lose. This is a team that once went
3-12-1. A team that once led a home game
against Philadelphia securely until its
quarterback, the legendary Joe Pisarcik,
tried a reverse handoff instead of dropping
to one knee and letting the clock run.
Pisarcik's handoff never made it to the
running back. Instead, it hit the ground
and was picked up by the Eagles' Herman
Edwards, who ran into the end zone for a
game-winning touchdown. In NFL lore,
it's known simply as The Fumble.
Stanford, the other team I live and die
with each autumn, has its own version of
The Fumble (that five lateral, kickoff
return-for-touch'down, known as The
Play) and its own Herman Edwards (Kevin
Moen, the guy who knocked over trombon
ist Gary Tyrrell in '82). Unlike the Giants,
though, Stanford now has revenge.
With three minutes to go in Saturday's
Miracle at Memorial, I was going through
the usual end-of-the-game routine. The
woman next to me was a Cal alum and I
was congratulating her and mumbling on
about what a great Big Game it had been.

It didn't matter, we were going to lose.
I knew this because I had been there oh
so many times before. I wasn't going to be
fooled by The Tease, that evil gremlin who
makes his appearance in the closing sec
onds of many a game. The Tease took over
when the Bears foolishly decided to throw
on third-and-six with 2:06 on the clock.
Mike Pawlawski's pass fell incomplete and
the clock stopped. He obviosuly hadn't
seen the Pisarcik thing. The Cardinal
would get the ball back with enough time.
It didn't matter, we were still going to lose.
After the ensuing punt, Jason Palumbis
began to engineer the finest drive of this
magnificent season he's put together. Delu
sions of grandeur began to flash through
my mind. "Can we make it in time?" "Will
we punch it in?" But, no. I knew better. "I
hate this ... I hate this," I muttered.
"Why do you hate this?" the 6-year-old
boy standing behind me asked.
"Because," I said, "I know, no matter

what happens Stanford is still somehow
going to lose." The Tease had fooled me
one time too many. This time I wouldn't
get on the emotional roller coaster only to
be thrown from my seat when the safety
bar came loose ...
Yeah, right. Like I didn't go crazy when
Ed McCaffrey emerged from a game-long
shadow to catch The Pass in the front cor
ner of the end zone. Like I didn't go "Ed,
Ed, Ed" exhorting Palumbis to throw to
McCaffrey on the failed two-point conver
sion. Like I didn't scream "We have the
ball" when Kevin Scott finally recovered
an onside kick that about 2,000 players let
slip through their hands.
Then reality hit me like a frozen orange
hurled from the Cal student section. How,
with no timeouts and just nine seconds left
on the clock, were we going to get into posi
tion to kick The Field Goal? In the stands,
we figured Coach Denny Green had one
.option: a sideline pass 10 to 20 yards down
field. When Palumbis threw the ball away
into the Stanford bench, our hearts sank.
We were certainly going to lose.
Staring blankly at the lovely Astroturf
gridiron the Bears call home, I first spot
ted Palumbis sitting on his behind. Then
the little yellow square jumped up and
said to me: "Hey, it ain't over yet, kid."
Fifteen penalty yards later, the impos
sible had become the do-able. The Bears
called the obligatory timeout — the one

designed to, as sportscasters always say,
make John Hopkins think about it. "No
problem," I said as I stood there freezing
in the autumn evening air. "Ice water's
already running through my veins."
Hoppy, though, was apparently some
thing of a wreck. Practicing his kicks into
the side of the stands since the net was
already packed away, he shanked several
before gathering himself together for
what he would soon call "the greatest
moment of my life."
Those foolish Bears. The ones who
didn't learn, after eight years, that if you
run on the field at Big Game before time
expires you're going to lose, didn't realize
that their timeout would allow Hopkins
time enough to regain his composure.
When Chuck Gillingham's final snap
was placed down on the ground, and Hop
kins' foot sent it lofting through the goal
posts, it was clear: We were going to win!
Every now and then, Joe Pisarcik and
Gary Terrell probably think about The
Fumble and The Play — and wish they
could erase it from their minds. But Kevin
Moen and Herman Edwards will never
forget. And I'll remember running around
the field at Memorial Stadium screaming
"Yeeeesssss!" and hugging everyone in
sight for the rest of my life.

designed to, as sportscasters always say,
make John Hopkins think about it. "No
problem," I said as I stood there freezing
in the autumn evening air. "Ice water's
already running through my veins."
Hoppy, though, was apparently some
thing of a wreck. Practicing his kicks into
the side of the stands since the net was
already packed away, he shanked several
before gathering himself together for
what he would soon call "the greatest
moment of my life."
Those foolish Bears. The ones who
didn't learn, after eight years, that if you
run on the field at Big Game before time
expires you're going to lose, didn't realize
that their timeout would allow Hopkins
time enough to regain his composure.
When Chuck Gillingham's final snap
was placed down on the ground, and Hop
kins' foot sent it lofting through the goal
posts, it was clear: We were going to win!
Every now and then, Joe Pisarcik and
Gary Terrell probably think about The
Fumble and The Play — and wish they
could erase it from their minds. But Kevin
Moen and Herman Edwards will never
forget. And I'll remember running around
the field at Memorial Stadium screaming
"Yeeeesssss!" and hugging everyone in
sight for the rest of my life.

For as long as I can remember, I've
been a New York Giants fan. Each
Sunday, pulling for the boys in blue
has been a passion — and a curse.
You see, no matter how big the lead, no
matter how little time is left on the clock,
a Giants fan is always certain his team is
going to lose. This is a team that once went
3-12-1. A team that once led a home game
against Philadelphia securely until its
quarterback, the legendary Joe Pisarcik,
tried a reverse handoff instead of dropping
to one knee and letting the clock run.
Pisarcik's handoff never made it to the
running back. Instead, it hit the ground
and was picked up by the Eagles' Herman
Edwards, who ran into the end zone for a
game-winning touchdown. In NFL lore,
it's known simply as The Fumble.
Stanford, the other team I live and die
with each autumn, has its own version of
The Fumble (that five lateral, kickoff
return-for-touch'down, known as The
Play) and its own Herman Edwards (Kevin
Moen, the guy who knocked over trombon
ist Gary Tyrrell in '82). Unlike the Giants,
though, Stanford now has revenge.
With three minutes to go in Saturday's
Miracle at Memorial, I was going through
the usual end-of-the-game routine. The
woman next to me was a Cal alum and I
was congratulating her and mumbling on
about what a great Big Game it had been.

It didn't matter, we were going to lose.
I knew this because I had been there oh
so many times before. I wasn't going to be
fooled by The Tease, that evil gremlin who
makes his appearance in the closing sec
onds of many a game. The Tease took over
when the Bears foolishly decided to throw
on third-and-six with 2:06 on the clock.
Mike Pawlawski's pass fell incomplete and
the clock stopped. He obviosuly hadn't
seen the Pisarcik thing. The Cardinal
would get the ball back with enough time.
It didn't matter, we were still going to lose.
After the ensuing punt, Jason Palumbis
began to engineer the finest drive of this
magnificent season he's put together. Delu
sions of grandeur began to flash through
my mind. "Can we make it in time?" "Will
we punch it in?" But, no. I knew better. "I
hate this ... I hate this," I muttered.
"Why do you hate this?" the 6-year-old
boy standing behind me asked.
"Because," I said, "I know, no matter

what happens Stanford is still somehow
going to lose." The Tease had fooled me
one time too many. This time I wouldn't
get on the emotional roller coaster only to
be thrown from my seat when the safety
bar came loose ...
Yeah, right. Like I didn't go crazy when
Ed McCaffrey emerged from a game-long
shadow to catch The Pass in the front cor
ner of the end zone. Like I didn't go "Ed,
Ed, Ed" exhorting Palumbis to throw to
McCaffrey on the failed two-point conver
sion. Like I didn't scream "We have the
ball" when Kevin Scott finally recovered
an onside kick that about 2,000 players let
slip through their hands.
Then reality hit me like a frozen orange
hurled from the Cal student section. How,
with no timeouts and just nine seconds left
on the clock, were we going to get into posi
tion to kick The Field Goal? In the stands,
we figured Coach Denny Green had one
.option: a sideline pass 10 to 20 yards down
field. When Palumbis threw the ball away
into the Stanford bench, our hearts sank.
We were certainly going to lose.
Staring blankly at the lovely Astroturf
gridiron the Bears call home, I first spot
ted Palumbis sitting on his behind. Then
the little yellow square jumped up and
said to me: "Hey, it ain't over yet, kid."
Fifteen penalty yards later, the impos
sible had become the do-able. The Bears
called the obligatory timeout — the one

designed to, as sportscasters always say,
make John Hopkins think about it. "No
problem," I said as I stood there freezing
in the autumn evening air. "Ice water's
