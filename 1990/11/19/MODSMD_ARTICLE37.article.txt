# Friedman advocates legalization of drugs

Hoover Institution senior
research fellow Milton Fried
man staunchly advocated the
decriminalization of drugs as
the institutions' Conference on
Drug Policy came to a close Fri
day.
"Present methods are doing
a great deal of harm," said
Friedman, a recipient of the
1976 Nobel Prize in economics.
"The attempt to make the use
of drugs a criminal matter is
destroying our poorer neigh
borhoods in city after city and
is creating a whole climate that
is destructive to the people who
live there.
"Changes need to be made
now," he said, challenging an
argument made by former U.S.
Attorney General Edwin Meese
in a debate Thursday. Meese
said new policies need to be
thoroughly researched and
thought out before current
ones are changed.
"The burden of proof is on
those who want to change the
system now," Friedman said,
but "the tyranny of the status
quo" is hindering progress.
Friedman said the justifica
tion for government interfer
ence is to prevent harm to oth
ers. Both innocent bystanders
and chosen victims of drug

abuse feel the effects of an
overloaded, inefficient system.
The innocent victims "are
not only the crack babies of our
time," he said, but also "the
most important class of inno
cent victims, those who are not
protected by the police because
[the police] are too darn busy
trying to do something about
drugs."
He later said, "The greatest
beneficiaries of the decriminal
ization of drugs would be the
present drug addicts them
selves because (under the cur
rent system) they are made
criminals and thus can't ask
for help."
Friedman presented a
graph showing the relationship
between homicide rates and
the prohibition of alcohol. His
model began in 1933, when
Prohibition ended, with a
sharp but short-lived rise in
homicides. In the subsequent
years, his graph showed a
decline in homicides, except
during wartime.
"If the illegality of drug use
was decriminalized, there
would be a reduction in homi
cides," he concluded.
He also supported this claim
by showing that homicide rates
rose during the wars on drugs
of Presidents Nixon and Rea
gan.
