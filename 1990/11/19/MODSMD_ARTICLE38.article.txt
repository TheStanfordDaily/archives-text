# Band 'grovels' to redecorate its Shak
## 
### Jill Daniels Staff writer 
During the first six days of Big
Game week, the Stanford Band
built pyramids, highways and
temples. And on the seventh day,
there was "an apocalyptic redeco
ration," said Ben Myers, the
Band's public relations director.
In keeping with a tradition that
"goes back a really long time,"
each section of the band built
objects to decorate the Band Shak
while spending a night in it to
"prevent Cal people from coming
down and messing with the
(Band) Shak," Myers said.
Band members returned from
Big Game to the Band Shak Sat
urday night to "grovel" — the
Band's term for destroying all the
objects they have built.
"People picked up two-by-fours
and other heavy objects and
(started) bashing down every
thing," said band member Ryokei
Imai, a sophomore. He added that
20 to 30 people participated in the
destruction.
"I tried to stay away from it
'cause it can get dangerous with
drunken people swinging heavy
objects," said Morgan McCarroll,
the alto saxophone section leader.
"Groveling was more fun this year
'cause there were more objects to
grovel'" than in past years, he
added.
The mellophone section built a
5-foot-tall pyramid, and the drum
section built a "Temple of
Rhythm" with an altar and fake
Corinthian columns, Myers said.

During the destruction, "peo
ple were hanging from the temple
to try and get it down," Myers
said. The band finished groveling
within 15 minutes, he added.
Other structures included
"Tenor Castle," built by the tenor
saxophone section, and the trum
pet section's freeway called

"Trump Pike." The freeway,
about 3 feet wide and 2 feet tall,
ran through the temple and had
off-ramps leading to other objects,
Myers said.
The clarinet and piccolo sec
tions tried to build a spotted owl
out of papier-m&ch6, he said.
He added that the Band built
"nice, manly sized things."
According to Jeff Rahn, the
Band's former historian and
social manager, cleaning up the
destruction generally takes about
two hours and fills three dump
sters.
Although there were no van
dalism attempts this year, the UC-

Berkeley band visited the Band
Shak Tuesday night and played
for two hours with the band, Rahn
said.
"Grovel is officially the end of
fall band," said Marin Melchior,
who just completed her term as
band graphics coordinator. When
there are four seconds left in Big
Game, the outgoing band officers
relinquish their positions to the
new officers, she said.
"I don't think anyone knows
how [grovel] started," Melchior
added. "A lot of things are insti
tuted as traditions if you just treat
them that way and tell people it's
always been done."
