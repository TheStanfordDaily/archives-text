### 
Physics Prof. Emeritus Robert Hofstadter, whose
lifelong curiosity about the simplicity of nature
helped him win the Nobel Prize for detecting basic
subatomic particles, died of heart failure Saturday at
his campus home. He was 75.
The pioneer in nuclear research was awarded the
Nobel Prize in physics in 1961 for precisely deter
mining the size and shape of the proton and the neu
tron inside the nuclei of atoms. He shared the prize
with Rudolf Mossbauer of West Germany.

Born in New York City, Hofstadter received a
master's and doctorate from Princeton University
before he moved to Stanford in 1960 to teach and
research.
"He was somebody who was very much a believer
in the beauty and simplicity of nature, which led him
down certain pathways and made him want to
understand the innermost part of the smallest parti-
cles," Hofstadter's son, Douglas,
said Sunday in a telephone inter
view from his father's home.
Ten years ago, Hofstadter told
an interviewer that the work
which won him the prestigious
science award wasn't his most
important.
"There is work I did for which
I have never received any recogni
tion and which I think is of com
parable importance," said Hofs
tadter, a quiet man who refused
most interviews.
Douglas Hofstadter said that
work was his father's discovery
and invention of sodium iodide, a
crystal used in research to detect
other important subatomic parti
cles.
"He made the discovery in

1948 and he's very proud of it,"
Douglas Hofstadter said. "Most
people didn't even know he was
responsible for it."
Using that lesser known dis
covery, Hofstadter and his col
leagues worked for 10 years to
probe the nuclei by directing a
beam of electrons from a 220-foot
linear accelerator to obtain a
clearer picture of the structure of
the subatomic body.
"I've known people who could
run rings around him in scientific
arguments, but he's usually the
one who ends up being right,"
1981 Nobel laureate and former
Stanford colleague Arthur
Schawlow once said.
Hofstadter retired in 1985
after 25 years at Stanford.
He is survived by his wife,
Nancy, a brother, a sister, a son,
two daughters and two grand
sons.
