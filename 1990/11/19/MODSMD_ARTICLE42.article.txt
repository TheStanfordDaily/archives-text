### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
Stories about the ongoing
federal investigations of Stan
ford's indirect cost policies
have been splashed across the
pages of Bay Area newspapers
since mid-September. Now, the
topic appears to have caught
the eye of the national media as
well.
A producer from the ABC
news program "20/20" met
with several Stanford adminis
trators and faculty members
late last week to determine
whether the subject was wor
thy of a segment on the show.
According to Larry Horton,
associate vice president for
public affairs, "20/20" pro
ducer Bill Willson said he had
not yet made up his mind when
he left campus Friday.
Willeon did not return
phone calls.
Stanford's indirect cost poli
cies are the subject of two cur
rent federal investigations —
one by the General Accounting
Office, at the request of the
House Subcommittee on Over
sight and Investigations; the
other by the Inspector General

of the Office of Naval Research.
The investigations were
cerns raised by Paul Biddle, the
on-site representative of the
ONR. In a March 6 letter
addressed to his superior, Bid
die said Stanford's indirect cost
recovery practices had been
marred by "fraud" and
"abuse."
A congressional subcommit
tee staff member has been cited
in several media reports claim
ing Stanford overtoiled the gov
ernment by between $200 and
$300 million for the indirect
costs of research over the last
decade.
An internal audit subse
quently released by Stanford
concluded the University had
engaged in no wrongdoing.
In addition to Horton, Will
son met with University Con
troller Frank Riddle, Chief
Financial Officer William
Massy and Electrical Engineer
ing Prof. William Spicer, a vocal
critic of rising indirect cost
rates.
Stories on the investigations
have also appeared in The New
York Times and The Wall
Street Journal.
