# Top finance officer resigns
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
William Massy said Friday that
he will resign as the University's
chief financial officer in order to
head a new government-funded
study of financing and productiv
ity in higher education.
Massy, who has served as chief
financial officer for 13 years, will
remain in the position until a suc
cessor is chosen. The search is
expected to take between three
and six months.
The study Massy will lead is
part of a six-university consor
tium called the Center for Policy
Research and Education that will
examine finance, quality and per
formance in U.S. schools, colleges
and universities.
The U.S. Department of Educa
tion announced Friday that Stan
ford's Institute for Higher Educa-

tion announced
Friday that Stan
ford's Institute
for Higher Edu
cation Research,
which Massy also
heads, had been
awarded more
than $1 million to
research the com
ponent dealing

with higher education finance.
Massy said the new study will
explore "the way in which we
manage our institutions," focus
ing on issues of productivity and
cost containment. Over the past
few years, he said, increasing
tuition and indirect cost rates at
universities have prompted
a great deal of concern. "We have
to do better in these areas," Massy
said.
Researchers will also look at
ways to integrate the nation's col

leges and universities more closely
with secondary schools in order to
increase the number of minority
students "who make it through
the pipeline," Massy said. Right
now, he noted, "there are too
many leakages."
Massy has headed the institute
since the fall of 1988. Upon
assuming that post, he relin
quished many of the operating
responsibilities of his role as chief
financial officer. A new position,
vice president for administration,
was created at the time to take on
those responsibilities.
Massy said he had been con
cerned for some time about his
ability to devote himself to both
his administrative post and the
institute. During the last two
and-a-half years, his career has
increasingly focused on research,
