# Bringing diverse cultures together:
## New Latino group organizes 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
A group of students has created a new organiza
tion it hopes will include the entire spectrum of
Stanford Latino cultures, including Chicano, Mexi
can, Mexican-American, Hispanic and international
Latin American.
More than 50 Latinos attended the first meeting
of the new group — the Latino Student Association
— Thursday night in El Centro Chicano.
"All the .diverse parts [of Latino culture] have
something to offer," said junior Erik Peterson. "Each
segment is different. We hope to help students share
those differences."
Peterson, along with 14 other Latino students,
created the new group to address the social, cultural
and political needs of all Latino groups, not just Chi

The group members said they want to expand the
reach of the Latino community to include people
who often feel excluded — for example, international

explained Mike Canul, a senior.

Group members said they chose the name Latino
over Chicano because Latino is the more encompass

of the Chicano Power Movement in the 19705.
"Latino is a name everyone can identify them
selves with because it's a cultural term," Canul said.
Gandera emphasized that the group is not solely a
political one. "Our goal is to be a social, cultural and
political organization," she said, while other Chi
cano/Latino groups such as MEChA focus more on
politics.
According to Peterson, many students do not feel
included in the Chicano/Latino community. "They
see no way they can participate," he said.
"We want to try to come up with a common
vision," Gandera said.
Canul added that interest in a group bringing
together students of different Latino backgrounds
"has been in the minds of people for several years."
Now that the new association is a reality, many
students have expressed worries that MEChA and
the new group could become rivals. "There was lots
