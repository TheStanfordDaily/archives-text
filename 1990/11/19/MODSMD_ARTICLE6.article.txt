# Bringing diverse cultures together:
## New Latino group organizes 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
A group of students has created a new organiza
tion it hopes will include the entire spectrum of
Stanford Latino cultures, including Chicano, Mexi
can, Mexican-American, Hispanic and international
Latin American.
More than 50 Latinos attended the first meeting
of the new group — the Latino Student Association
— Thursday night in El Centro Chicano.
"All the .diverse parts [of Latino culture] have
something to offer," said junior Erik Peterson. "Each
segment is different. We hope to help students share
those differences."
Peterson, along with 14 other Latino students,
created the new group to address the social, cultural
and political needs of all Latino groups, not just Chi
canos. "We felt that no Latino student group on cam
pus was representative enough," said junior Tina
Gandera.
The group members said they want to expand the
reach of the Latino community to include people
who often feel excluded — for example, international
Latin American students. Basically, it includes peo
ple who don't consider themselves Chicano,
explained Mike Canul, a senior.

Group members said they chose the name Latino
over Chicano because Latino is the more encompass
ing cultural term. Also, they added, Latino does not
carry as much of a political connotation.
Chicano is a term which non-Latinos once used as
an insult but which eventually became a rallying cry
of the Chicano Power Movement in the 19705.
"Latino is a name everyone can identify them
selves with because it's a cultural term," Canul said.
Gandera emphasized that the group is not solely a
political one. "Our goal is to be a social, cultural and
political organization," she said, while other Chi
cano/Latino groups such as MEChA focus more on
politics.
According to Peterson, many students do not feel
included in the Chicano/Latino community. "They
see no way they can participate," he said.
"We want to try to come up with a common
vision," Gandera said.
Canul added that interest in a group bringing
together students of different Latino backgrounds
"has been in the minds of people for several years."
Now that the new association is a reality, many
students have expressed worries that MEChA and
the new group could become rivals. "There was lots
of MEChA versus [Latino Stu
dent Association] talk" at Thurs
day's meeting, said sophomore
Adriana Martinez.
"But I think we shouldn't be
talking about organizations," she
said, noting that "one of the
[association's] goals is to become
a vehicle for the community to get
involved with individual func
tions." Many other Latino stu
dents echoed her desire for the
two groups to coexist harmo
niously.
In a letter to The Daily, repre
sentatives of MEChA praised the
Latino Student Association as "a
reaffirmation of the commitment
... to actively pursue cultural,
social, political and community
issues."

They also wrote that MEChA
looks "forward to the prospect of
unity and the pursuit of a
stronger Latino community"
To help build this strong com
munity, Gandera said the new
association will coordinate com
munity service projects and social
functions which will include both
Latinos and non-Latinos.
Members said they also want
to focus on creating a Latino
alumni network and serving as a
pre-professional liaison between
Latino groups and Stanford's pro
fessional schools.
Gandera said the new group
also offers leadership opportuni
ties for Latino students. Elected
officers include a president and
vice president, a financial man
ager and directors of social
events, cultural programs, com
munity initiatives, community
service projects and public rela
tions.
