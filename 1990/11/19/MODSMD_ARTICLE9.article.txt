# Finding AIDS treatment for children is professor's goal
## 
### Cynthia Benton Staff writer 
Of more than 1,300 professors
at Stanford, Yvonne Maldonado
stands out as the only Chicana. As
an assistant professor at the
School of Medicine, she primarily
focuses on research and treat
ment of pediatric AIDS.
Maldonado received her bache
lor's in bacteriology from UCLA
and graduated from Stanford
Medical School in 1989. After a
residency at Johns Hopkins Uni
versity and fellowship studying
infectious diseases, Maldonado
worked as an epidemiologist at the
Center for Disease Control for two
years before returning to Stanford
as a faculty member.
Why did you decide to
become a professor, instead of
solely practicing medicine?
It would have to do with the
area I was interested in to begin
with. When I was in college, I
found that I really eryoyed lab
wortt in virology. At that point, it
was a matter of whether I was
going to go to medical school or
work in a virology lab. I decided
that my feeling about being a
physician was stronger, but I
always had that interest in lab
work. I liked research and I liked
the idea of answering questions,
but I also liked [caring for people].
That's why I picked academics.
What type of work are you
doing now?
Our functions as faculty here
in the Medical School are divided
into three main duties. First and
probably foremost, we teach the
medical students and the resident
doctors-in-training. We teach
them how to examine patients and
how to provide therapy.
The second duty is patient care.
We have a population of patients
to serve besides the students; we
treat patients both in the hospital
and in a clinic setting. Included in
our patient-care duties is the out
patient clinic.
Then our third function is
research. My particular focus is in
pediatric AIDS — looking at treat
ment, epidemiology and the natu
ral history of the disease. I am
concerned with ways we can diag

nose children more rapidly and
also treat them more rapidly and
efficiently with antiviral agents.
The second area that I do
research in is with vaccine-pre
ventable diseases. One area that is
particularly of interest to me is
looking at how effective the polio
virus vaccine is in developing
countries and how we can improve
it.
What activities are you
involved with outside your
job?
I work a lot with various AIDS
groups in California, at the Uni
versity, internationally and
nationally. I'm Spanish-speaking
and I have developed a specialty in
the epidemiology of AIDS, so I've
worked in Latin America coun
tries looking at prevention and
education [of AIDS] and develop
ing public health strategies.
How does it feel to be the
only female Chicano/Latino

professor on campus?
It is overwhelming. I try not to
think about it too much because
it's disturbing to me that the Uni
versity can't find other qualified
Latino professionals because I
know that they're out there. It's
an institutional response that's
not uncommon in other institu
tions.
The problem is overcoming
that institutional inertia. Every
body expresses an interest, but I
don't see much being accom
plished. There's really no change
in the number of faculty. If any
thing, the numbers have really
gone down.
I don't want to represent
myself as special or unique. I
know there are Chicano/Latino
women out there that have gone
into other professions that are
equally good at teaching and
thriving in an academic environ
ment. I think we really need to
look for them and actively pursue
having them on this type of cam

pus. I think academic institutions
.need to focus on recruitment, and
I don't think we need to change
our standards because there are
good people out there.
1 think it's really important for
students to have role models not
so much for the particular area
that they represent, but the fact
that they provide evidence to stu
dents who are trying to develop
their own professional identity
that there are possibilities open to
them. Just seeing somebody who
has accomplished (his or her)
goals is a real incentive for stu
dents to pursue them themselves.
Are there any social or eth
ical issues related to medicine
about which you are particu
larly concerned?
Well, my day-to-day contact is
with children who have AIDS, and
that's a very difficult area for me.
These are children who have a ter
minal or frequently terminal dis
ease who come from minority
families and poor families.
They're very alienated, and I find
that very difficult to deal with
because they fall through the
cracks socially.
Medically, we do as much as we
can, but I think socially and psy
chologically, on the societal level,
they really are deficient. They and
their families don't get as much
attention as oVier patients I get.
It's really hard not to become cyn
ical and overburdened by the med
ical system because you see the
worst of everything in the hospi
tal.
What do you enjoy most
about your job?
The variety. I get to do what I

like best and that's my job. It's
almost like getting to do your
favorite thing and being paid for
it. I love to teach. I like working
with students and residents-in
training. I like taking care of
patients, especially children,
because there is a lot of potential
for that child. There's a lot of
potential to make them better, to
make an impact on a young life.
And especially now that I have my
own children, I can really relate to
that whole parent-child interac
tion.
And I really like research. Most
of the work I'm interested in has
to do with preventable diseases.
The idea of doing research in
areas that would contribute to
preventing these diseases even
further is very attractive to me.
The university setting gives me
the flexibility to do all of these
things.
What do you enjoy least?
Well, the same thing that gives
you the flexibility also lets you get
involved in so many things, so you
really have to be careful of limit
ing yourself to what you can real
istically accomplish. That can be
very difficult when you're talking
about interacting on a non-medi
cal level because you have to get
involved with extracurricular
activities.
Involvement with students
means having time to see students
when they want to come and see
you and talking about not only
work but other things that are
going on in their lives. I think the
perception that I had before I
became faculty was that faculty
were not dealing with certain
things or just weren't interested,

but it's really not a matter of
interest. It's really just a matter of
t.ime.
What advice would you give
to someone considering enter
ing your profession?
I would say that the most
important thing if you're going
into medicine is to really develop a
broad-based education before
[you] go to medical school. I think
it's really important not to focus
primarily on one area before you
have to. As time goes on, you'll
naturally have to focus, and you'll
have less time to explore new
activities or to branch out.
How do you feel the Stan
ford Medical Center com
pares to other universities'
centers in terms of its
strengths and weaknesses?
I've worked here and at Johns
Hopkins University Medical Cen
ter .. . and I think Stanford com
pares favorably in a lot of ways.
Our research base is excellent
here. I think that our commit
ment to non-medical issues
among faculty and health staff is a
lot stronger. I think there's a
strong effort to include non
research issues in terms of quality
of life for physicians.
What are your future goals?
I'd like to try to make a differ
ence in pediatric care, especially
with very simple preventable dis
eases, in terms of developing
strategies to prevent children
from getting sick and dying from
diseases that currently should not
be occurring in populations
around the world. I'd also like to
make sure that my teaching here
is successful and that I interact
well with students.
I think I've set up a pretty good
research-teaching career program
for myself, and I'd like to make
sure that I reach all those
[research] goals. Setting up those
kind of goals may take a year or
so, but reaching those types of
goals is a lifetime achievement. In
terms of short-term goals, I just
want to make sure that I'm a good
physician, a good teacher and a
good mother.

favorite thing and being paid for
it. I love to teach. I like working
with students and residents-in
training. I like taking care of
patients, especially children,
because there is a lot of potential
for that child. There's a lot of
potential to make them better, to
make an impact on a young life.
And especially now that I have my
own children, I can really relate to
that whole parent-child interac
tion.
And I really like research. Most
of the work I'm interested in has
to do with preventable diseases.
The idea of doing research in
areas that would contribute to
preventing these diseases even
further is very attractive to me.
The university setting gives me
the flexibility to do all of these
things.
What do you enjoy least?
Well, the same thing that gives
you the flexibility also lets you get
involved in so many things, so you
really have to be careful of limit
ing yourself to what you can real
istically accomplish. That can be
very difficult when you're talking
about interacting on a non-medi
cal level because you have to get
involved with extracurricular
activities.
Involvement with students
means having time to see students
when they want to come and see
you and talking about not only
work but other things that are
going on in their lives. I think the
perception that I had before I
became faculty was that faculty
were not dealing with certain
things or just weren't interested,

but it's really not a matter of
interest. It's really just a matter of
t.ime.
What advice would you give
to someone considering enter
ing your profession?
I would say that the most
important thing if you're going
into medicine is to really develop a
broad-based education before
[you] go to medical school. I think
it's really important not to focus
primarily on one area before you
have to. As time goes on, you'll
naturally have to focus, and you'll
have less time to explore new
activities or to branch out.
How do you feel the Stan
ford Medical Center com
pares to other universities'
centers in terms of its
strengths and weaknesses?
I've worked here and at Johns
Hopkins University Medical Cen
ter .. . and I think Stanford com
pares favorably in a lot of ways.
Our research base is excellent
here. I think that our commit
ment to non-medical issues
among faculty and health staff is a
lot stronger. I think there's a
strong effort to include non
research issues in terms of quality
of life for physicians.
What are your future goals?
I'd like to try to make a differ
ence in pediatric care, especially
with very simple preventable dis
eases, in terms of developing
strategies to prevent children
from getting sick and dying from
diseases that currently should not
be occurring in populations
around the world. I'd also like to
make sure that my teaching here
is successful and that I interact
well with students.
I think I've set up a pretty good
research-teaching career program
for myself, and I'd like to make
sure that I reach all those
[research] goals. Setting up those
kind of goals may take a year or
so, but reaching those types of
goals is a lifetime achievement. In
terms of short-term goals, I just
want to make sure that I'm a good
physician, a good teacher and a
good mother.

Yvonne Maldonado, Stanford's only Chicana professor, says "insti
tutional inertia" has prevented Stanford and other institutions from
finding and hiring qualified Chicano and Latino women.

Of more than 1,300 professors
at Stanford, Yvonne Maldonado
stands out as the only Chicana. As
an assistant professor at the
School of Medicine, she primarily
focuses on research and treat
ment of pediatric AIDS.
Maldonado received her bache
lor's in bacteriology from UCLA
and graduated from Stanford
Medical School in 1989. After a
residency at Johns Hopkins Uni
versity and fellowship studying
infectious diseases, Maldonado
worked as an epidemiologist at the
Center for Disease Control for two
years before returning to Stanford
as a faculty member.
Why did you decide to
become a professor, instead of
solely practicing medicine?
It would have to do with the
area I was interested in to begin
with. When I was in college, I
found that I really eryoyed lab
wortt in virology. At that point, it
was a matter of whether I was
going to go to medical school or
work in a virology lab. I decided
that my feeling about being a
physician was stronger, but I
always had that interest in lab
work. I liked research and I liked
the idea of answering questions,
but I also liked [caring for people].
That's why I picked academics.
What type of work are you
doing now?
Our functions as faculty here
in the Medical School are divided
into three main duties. First and
probably foremost, we teach the
medical students and the resident
doctors-in-training. We teach
them how to examine patients and
how to provide therapy.
The second duty is patient care.
We have a population of patients
to serve besides the students; we
treat patients both in the hospital
and in a clinic setting. Included in
our patient-care duties is the out
patient clinic.
Then our third function is
research. My particular focus is in
pediatric AIDS — looking at treat
ment, epidemiology and the natu
ral history of the disease. I am
concerned with ways we can diag

nose children more rapidly and
also treat them more rapidly and
efficiently with antiviral agents.
The second area that I do
research in is with vaccine-pre
ventable diseases. One area that is
particularly of interest to me is
looking at how effective the polio
virus vaccine is in developing
countries and how we can improve
it.
What activities are you
involved with outside your
job?
I work a lot with various AIDS
groups in California, at the Uni
versity, internationally and
nationally. I'm Spanish-speaking
and I have developed a specialty in
the epidemiology of AIDS, so I've
worked in Latin America coun
tries looking at prevention and
education [of AIDS] and develop
ing public health strategies.
How does it feel to be the
only female Chicano/Latino

professor on campus?
It is overwhelming. I try not to
think about it too much because
it's disturbing to me that the Uni
versity can't find other qualified
Latino professionals because I
know that they're out there. It's
an institutional response that's
not uncommon in other institu
tions.
The problem is overcoming
that institutional inertia. Every
body expresses an interest, but I
don't see much being accom
plished. There's really no change
in the number of faculty. If any
thing, the numbers have really
gone down.
I don't want to represent
myself as special or unique. I
know there are Chicano/Latino
women out there that have gone
into other professions that are
equally good at teaching and
thriving in an academic environ
ment. I think we really need to
look for them and actively pursue
having them on this type of cam

pus. I think academic institutions
.need to focus on recruitment, and
I don't think we need to change
our standards because there are
good people out there.
1 think it's really important for
students to have role models not
so much for the particular area
that they represent, but the fact
that they provide evidence to stu
dents who are trying to develop
their own professional identity
that there are possibilities open to
them. Just seeing somebody who
has accomplished (his or her)
goals is a real incentive for stu
dents to pursue them themselves.
Are there any social or eth
ical issues related to medicine
about which you are particu
larly concerned?
Well, my day-to-day contact is
with children who have AIDS, and
that's a very difficult area for me.
These are children who have a ter
minal or frequently terminal dis
ease who come from minority
families and poor families.
They're very alienated, and I find
that very difficult to deal with
because they fall through the
cracks socially.
Medically, we do as much as we
can, but I think socially and psy
chologically, on the societal level,
they really are deficient. They and
their families don't get as much
attention as oVier patients I get.
It's really hard not to become cyn
ical and overburdened by the med
ical system because you see the
worst of everything in the hospi
tal.
What do you enjoy most
about your job?
The variety. I get to do what I

like best and that's my job. It's
almost like getting to do your
favorite thing and being paid for
it. I love to teach. I like working

training. I like taking care of

and in a clinic setting. Included in
our patient-care duties is the out
patient clinic.
Then our third function is
research. My particular focus is in
pediatric AIDS — looking at treat
ment, epidemiology and the natu
ral history of the disease. I am
concerned with ways we can diag

nose children more rapidly and
also treat them more rapidly and
efficiently with antiviral agents.
The second area that I do
research in is with vaccine-pre
ventable diseases. One area that is
particularly of interest to me is
looking at how effective the polio
virus vaccine is in developing
countries and how we can improve
it.
What activities are you
involved with outside your
job?
I work a lot with various AIDS
groups in California, at the Uni
versity, internationally and
nationally. I'm Spanish-speaking
and I have developed a specialty in
the epidemiology of AIDS, so I've
worked in Latin America coun
tries looking at prevention and
education [of AIDS] and develop
ing public health strategies.
How does it feel to be the
only female Chicano/Latino

professor on campus?
It is overwhelming. I try not to
think about it too much because
it's disturbing to me that the Uni
versity can't find other qualified
Latino professionals because I
know that they're out there. It's
an institutional response that's
not uncommon in other institu
tions.
The problem is overcoming
that institutional inertia. Every
body expresses an interest, but I
don't see much being accom
plished. There's really no change
in the number of faculty. If any
thing, the numbers have really
gone down.
I don't want to represent
myself as special or unique. I
know there are Chicano/Latino
women out there that have gone
into other professions that are
equally good at teaching and
thriving in an academic environ
ment. I think we really need to
look for them and actively pursue
having them on this type of cam

pus. I think academic institutions
.need to focus on recruitment, and
I don't think we need to change
our standards because there are
good people out there.
1 think it's really important for
students to have role models not
so much for the particular area
that they represent, but the fact
that they provide evidence to stu
dents who are trying to develop
their own professional identity
that there are possibilities open to
them. Just seeing somebody who
has accomplished (his or her)
goals is a real incentive for stu
dents to pursue them themselves.
Are there any social or eth
ical issues related to medicine
about which you are particu
larly concerned?
Well, my day-to-day contact is
with children who have AIDS, and
that's a very difficult area for me.
These are children who have a ter
minal or frequently terminal dis
ease who come from minority
families and poor families.
They're very alienated, and I find
that very difficult to deal with
because they fall through the
cracks socially.
Medically, we do as much as we
can, but I think socially and psy
chologically, on the societal level,
they really are deficient. They and
their families don't get as much
attention as oVier patients I get.
It's really hard not to become cyn
ical and overburdened by the med
ical system because you see the
worst of everything in the hospi
tal.
What do you enjoy most
about your job?
The variety. I get to do what I

like best and that's my job. It's
almost like getting to do your
favorite thing and being paid for
it. I love to teach. I like working
with students and residents-in
training. I like taking care of
patients, especially children,
because there is a lot of potential
for that child. There's a lot of
potential to make them better, to
make an impact on a young life.
And especially now that I have my
own children, I can really relate to
that whole parent-child interac
tion.
And I really like research. Most
of the work I'm interested in has
to do with preventable diseases.
The idea of doing research in
areas that would contribute to
preventing these diseases even
further is very attractive to me.
The university setting gives me
the flexibility to do all of these
things.
What do you enjoy least?
Well, the same thing that gives
you the flexibility also lets you get
involved in so many things, so you
really have to be careful of limit
ing yourself to what you can real
istically accomplish. That can be
very difficult when you're talking
about interacting on a non-medi
cal level because you have to get
involved with extracurricular
activities.
Involvement with students
means having time to see students
when they want to come and see
you and talking about not only
work but other things that are
going on in their lives. I think the
perception that I had before I
became faculty was that faculty
were not dealing with certain
things or just weren't interested,

but it's really not a matter of
interest. It's really just a matter of
t.ime.
What advice would you give
to someone considering enter
ing your profession?
I would say that the most
important thing if you're going
into medicine is to really develop a
broad-based education before
[you] go to medical school. I think
it's really important not to focus
primarily on one area before you
have to. As time goes on, you'll
naturally have to focus, and you'll
have less time to explore new
activities or to branch out.
How do you feel the Stan
ford Medical Center com
pares to other universities'
centers in terms of its
strengths and weaknesses?
I've worked here and at Johns
Hopkins University Medical Cen
ter .. . and I think Stanford com
pares favorably in a lot of ways.
Our research base is excellent
here. I think that our commit
ment to non-medical issues
among faculty and health staff is a
lot stronger. I think there's a
strong effort to include non
research issues in terms of quality
of life for physicians.
What are your future goals?
I'd like to try to make a differ
ence in pediatric care, especially
with very simple preventable dis
eases, in terms of developing
strategies to prevent children
from getting sick and dying from
diseases that currently should not
be occurring in populations
around the world. I'd also like to
make sure that my teaching here
is successful and that I interact
well with students.
I think I've set up a pretty good
research-teaching career program
for myself, and I'd like to make
sure that I reach all those
[research] goals. Setting up those
kind of goals may take a year or
so, but reaching those types of
goals is a lifetime achievement. In
terms of short-term goals, I just
want to make sure that I'm a good
physician, a good teacher and a
good mother.

Yvonne Maldonado, Stanford's only Chicana professor, says "insti
tutional inertia" has prevented Stanford and other institutions from
finding and hiring qualified Chicano and Latino women.
