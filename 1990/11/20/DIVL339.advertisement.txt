Insurance
All students are required to have medical insurance. If you are
covered by insurance already, you may waive the Stanford policy
(Bankers). If you do not waive the policy, it is automatically added to
your tuition hill each quarter ($150).
Note: there is a difference between Cowell and the Stanford
(Bankers) insurance policy! No insurance is involved when students go
to Cowell for routine care. You are not required to have the Stanford
insurance to visit Cowell. Howevder, a student who stops out for a
quarter may have the Stanford insurance, but will be billed for using
Cowell; the payment may be applied to the insurance.
Visits to the Palo Alto Medical Clinic (PAMC), when students are
referred by Cowell, are also normally covered by Cowell, with no
insurance being involved. However, Cowell coverage excludes: major or
minor surgery, fracture/dislocation care, diagnostic procedures over
$200, and hospitalization, including emergency room care. Any
problems in this latter category are not covered by Cowell, but are
routinely covered by insurance.
Snidents who visit the PAMC or the Medical Center on their own
will not be covered by Cowell, and may not be covered by the Stanford
insurance either, since that system is designed to pay for only what
Cowell will not routinely cover.
Emergency room visits when Cowell is closed, after 11pm at night,
are not covered by Cowell and will be billed to the student. The Stanford
plan covers such visits, as will most insurance; however, the Stanford
insurance has a $200 deductible, and then pays only 80% of usual and
customary fees subsequently. Physical therapy is not covered by Cowell
this year, and therefore is also now applicable to insurance.
Students who are covered by Kaiser insurance, or other HMOs,
should make sure that they are covered before visiting the F.R or being
referred to the PAMC for fracture or surgical care, or expensive
diagnostic testing. Kaiser will normally cover visits to the Stanford KR,
for example, only in cases of a true emergency.
