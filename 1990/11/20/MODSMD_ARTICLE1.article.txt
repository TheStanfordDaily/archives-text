# Webb Ranch conditions slowly improving
## 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
Once workers at Webb Ranch
signed a new contract last April,
their battle to improve their liv
ing conditions seemed finished.
But when the dust settled
from the conflict between the
owners of the ranch and the
United Stanford Workers, the
real work of creating a habitable
workplace for the ranch's Mexi
can immigrant workers began.
According to USW field repre
sentative Ruben Serna, that
work is going smoothly. "Every
thing is going fine," he said. "It's
not as good as we'd like it to be,
but I think everybody's doing
well."
Augustin Gonazales, who has
worked at Webb Ranch for 17
years, said conditions have
improved a little over last year.
"Today life is a little better —
a little, but not much," he said.
"A lot of things are still the
same."
Webb Ranch is a vegetable
and berry farm and horse stable
on 237 acres of University land.

where from 15 to 50 people work
and live at the ranch with their
families.
The Webb family, which has
owned the ranch since 1922, has
complied with the contract that
was forged after a year-long
standoff between the Webbs and
the USW over workers' living con
ditions. The five-year contract
provides for changes in housing,
pay rates, worker control in farm
production and a worker seniority
system.
"They want to cooperate with
the union," Serna said. "They
want to get on with their busi
ness."
The new contract broke a year
long stalemate between the Webbs
and the USW which began in
April, 1989, when the workers
voted to join the union. The USW
brought national media to the
ranch for a view of the living con
ditions in spring 1989 and led a
protest march at the ranch in Jan
uary 1990.
Though the workers do not live
in plush conditions, Serna said,
they are better off than they were
before. "Workers are no longer
sleeping outside under the trees,"
he said.
Currently, the barracks that

the workers live in can hold 15 to
20 people in a set of 10 foot by 10
foot rooms. The barracks also has
a communal kitchen, bathroom
and living area.
There are also four mobile
homes, which each hold one fam
ily, and three houses that also
hold one family each. The mobile
homes and houses are used for the
15 long-term workers and their
families, while seasonal workers
— who are usually single — live in
the barracks.
"There are still a lot of repairs
that need to be done," said worker
Francisco Mendoza, citing prob
lems with toilets and the paint
work inside the buildings.
In addition to poor living condi
tions at the ranch before the con
tract, rent policy was deemed
unfair by the union. Before the
contract was created, the owners
charged the workers 75 cents per
hour for rent. Therefore, the
more workers worked, the more
rent they had to pay.
With the new contract, work
ers have formed a non-profit
housing corporation in which they
charge themselves $28 a month
for rent. The money is then used
to pay for utilities and some
repairs and to keep the housing in
accordance with county and state
housing codes.
The housing is also no longer
overcrowded, Serna said, because
many of the illegal "drifters" that

the Webbs used to hire chose to
leave once the contract was
signed.
However, the housing "needs a
lot of improvement," he added.
Serna said he visits the ranch
about once a week to check on the
workers' conditions.
He added that the USW is seek
ing to raise about $80,000 to build
an improved barracks that would
hold 20 to 30 people.
Four pay classifications have
also been formed. Workers receive
different wages for being field
hands, tractor drivers, mainte
nance workers and supervisors.
Rates for University contract
work are higher.
Before the new contract was
ratified, workers who were con
tracted by the University for work
outside the ranch were given only
$2.75 out of the $8 per hour that
the University paid the ranch for
the labor, according to a Daily
investigation. Under the new con
tract, workers receive the entire
amount after legal deductions.
Workers also have a seniority
system under the new contract.
Layoffs, as well as job assignment,
are now made according to senior
ity.
According to Serna, workers
now say they have a greater voice
in the operation of the ranch.
When they see a problem, Serna
said, the workers tell him immedi
ately.
