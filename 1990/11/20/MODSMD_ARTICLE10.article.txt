Contaminated weenies recalled
WASHINGTON (AP) - A Chicago com
pany has voluntarily recalled more than five
tons of hot dogs suspected of being contami
nated by food poisoning organisms, the Agri
culture Department said Monday.
Officials said David Berg & Co. is recalling
10,000 pounds of bulk-packed "David Berg
Beef Frankfurters" distributed in California,
Illinois, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and
Texas.
Also being recalled are about 1,400 pounds
of retail-packaged "David Berg Deli Beef
Franks" distributed in the Chicago metropoli
tan area.
The franks may be contaminated with liste
ria monocytogenes, an organism that can
cause listeriosis, which was described as "a
rare but potentially serious disease."
The agency said that in general, listeriosis is
believed to pose "little risk" for healthy peo
ple. Most vulnerable are those with weakened
immune systems, including infants, the elderly
and the chronically ill.
Symptoms in adults include the sudden
onset of flu-like symptoms such as fever, chills,
headache, backache and sometimes abdominal
pain and diarrhea. Newborns can exhibit respi
ratory distress, refusal to drink and vomiting.
Florida con executed yesterday
STARKE, Fla. (AP) â€” Robert Clark went
silently to his death in Florida's electric chair
yesterday for shooting to death a scrap yard
owner after forcing him to write a $5,000 check.
Clark, 49, made no last statement before a
hidden executioner threw the switch that
delivered a 2,000-volt electric charge at 7:01
a.m., prison authorities said. A prison doctor
pronounced Clark dead at 7:07 a.m.
Clark was the fourth Florida inmate to die
this year and the 25th to be strapped into the
electric chair since the state resumed execu
tions in 1979.
Under his fifth death warrant, Clark had
been scheduled to be executed Nov. 14. But a
pair of temporary court delays pushed it back
first to Saturday and then yesterday morning.
Clark and his young male lover abducted
David Drake from a St. Petersburg bank park
ing lot, drove him to a secluded area north of
the city and ordered him at gunpoint to write a
$5,000 check. Clark then shot Drake twice in
the head.
When Drake was killed, Clark was on parole
from California for the killing of a 14-year-old
boy.
Milli Vanilli stripped of Grammy
LOS ANGELES (AP) - The band Milli
Vanilli was stripped of its Grammy Award yes
terday because other singers substituted for
the pop duo on the best-selling "Girl, You
Know It's True" album.
It's the first time in the 34-year history of
Grammys that an award has been taken away.
Trustees of the National Academy of
Recording Arts & Sciences voted overwhelm
ingly to rescind the award given to Milli Vanilli
members Rob Pilatus and Fabrice Morvan,
said academy President Michael Greene.
The attorney representing Pilatus and Mor
van said the pair already had planned to sur
render the Grammy.
A decision on the disposition of the 1989
new artist award will be made by an academy
subcommittee Dec. 5 in New York.
