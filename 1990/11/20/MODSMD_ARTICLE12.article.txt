NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — Iraq will send
250,000 more troops to Kuwait, giving it a
military superiority in the Persian Gulf
standoff that "others cannot match," the
official Iraqi News Agency reported yester
day.
INA said President Saddam Hussein and
his military commanders met and decided
to send seven extra divisions of the regular
army and an additional 150,000 reserves
and draftees.
The announcement, monitored in
Cyprus, came 11 days after President Bush
announced a U.S. buildup in the gulf to
about 430,000 military personnel, expected
to be completed in January.
No indication emerged as to where the
extra regular Iraqi troops would come from.
Iraq's army — totaling 55 divisions of
555,000 regular troops and 480,000
reserves — already was believed to have
430,000 men in southern Iraq and Kuwait.
"It is worth mentioning that according
to military considerations, the percentage
of attacking force to defending force is
three to one," INA said.
"This means the United States will need
to mobilize a 3-million-strong force with
similar equipment and armament to our
forces" if it is to attack, the agency went on.
"The superiority will thus remain at its
required standard, which the others cannot
match."
Iraq's regular army includes seven divi
sions of the elite Republican Guards, total
ing about 120,000 men. These troops
formed the spearhead of Iraq's offensives in
the closing stages of the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq
war in which Iranian-held Iraqi territory
was recaptured. They also led the invasion
of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
In Kuwait, Iraq already has an estimated

10 divisions — three armored, two mecha
nized infantry, four infantry and one com
mando — totaling 170,000 troops, with
about 1,500 T-55 and T-62 tanks.

A further 15-16 divisions totaling about
250,000 men, including at least six Repub
lican Guard divisions with up to 1,800
tanks, including all Iraq's T-725, and
approximately 750 guns are dug in in
southern Iraq south of Basra straddling the
Kuwaiti border.
Five more divisions, totaling 20,000
men, are believed to be spread along the
Saudi Arabia border, many in the sector
near Kuwait.
The multinational force of about
350,000 troops in the gulf region includes
240,000 Americans. An estimated 170,000
ground troops, 46,000 Navy personnel and
30,000 Air Force personnel are deployed in
northeastern Saudi Arabia around
Dhahran and the bulk of the kingdom's oil
fields.
Bush announced Nov. 8 he has ordered
more U.S. forces into the gulf region and
said the planned rotation of troops already
deployed in Saudi Arabia has been
scrapped.
