# Troop reduction treaty signed at Paris summit

PARIS (AP) - Leaders of 34
nations toasted the end of Cold War
rivalries yesterday in a celebration tar
nished by distant military rumbles
from the Middle East. President Bush
and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
grappled for a common strategy on the
possible use of force to oust Iraq from
Kuwait.
In capping a long-awaited East-West
agreement to reduce forces and troop
levels in Europe, Bush said the treaties

and testimonials of Paris would be
undermined "if the rule of law is
shamelessly disregarded elsewhere."
In the ornate French presidential
residence, the Elysee Palace, leaders of
16 NATO members and the remaining
six Warsaw Pact nations signed two
treaties â€” one making sweeping cuts
in non-nuclear arms throughout
Europe and the other pledging non
aggression toward one another.
Then, the 22 representatives of the
two military alliances joined leaders of

neutral and unaligned countries to
begin an unprecedented 34-nation
summit on the future of Europe.
"What a long way the world has
come," Gorbachev declared.
A mark of just how far the world
had come is the alliance between Bush
and Gorbachev against Iraq.
French President Francois Mitter
rand formally opened the 34-nation
Conference on Security and Coopera
tion in Europe. "Our meeting today
marks the end of an epoch and thereby

a beginning," he declared. "It is the
first time in history that we witness a
change in depth of our landscape
which is not the outcome of a war or
bloody revolution."
The centerpiece of the summit, the
Conventional Armed Forces in Europe
(CFE) treaty, calls for the destruction
or removal of thousands of tanks,
artillery pieces, combat vehicles and
attack aircraft from the Atlantic to the
Ural Mountains deep inside the Soviet
Union.
