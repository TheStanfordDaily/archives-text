# FDA accused of hindering abortion drug research

WASHINGTON (AP) - Medical
researchers accused the Food and
Drug Administration yesterday of
imperiling their supply of a French
abortion drug that shows promise in
treating cancer and other diseases.
Scientists are being "whiplashed by
the FDA decision" to issue an import
alert on the French drug RU-486, Dr.
George P Chrousos, of the National
Institute of Child Health and Develop
ment in Bethesda, Md., said at a con
gressional hearing.
"I won't be able to initiate a new
study" because of the uncertain supply
of RU-486, Chrousos said. He said the

reluctance by the French company,
Roussel-Uclaf, to supply it for research
in this country was "unethical."
The FDA got "carried away" under
pressure from the right-to-life move
ment and "may have made a political
decision," Chrousos added.
The FDA issued an import alert in
June 1989 barring the abortion drug
for personal use after getting inquiries
from right-to-life groups and a dozen
members of Congress who oppose
abortion, including Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., and Rep. Robert Dornan, R-
Calif.
Since then, some U.S. researchers
have had difficulty getting the drug

from its French manufacturer, which
fears its business could suffer if it
becomes embroiled in an abortion con
troversy.
The regulatory agency's import
alert was not a politically motivated
decision, the FDA's Ronald G. Chese
more told the House subcommittee on
regulation, business opportunities and
energy.
And "there was no intention" of
slowing down the supply of the drug
for scientific research, said Chese
more, the FDA's associate commis
sioner for regulatory affairs.
The drug has shown promise in
treating breast and brain cancer, Cush

ing's Syndrome and other diseases.
Cushing's Syndrome is a disorder of
the pituitary gland.
The FDA didn't consult leading U.S.
researchers before issuing the import
alert, testified Dr. Kathryn Horwitz, a
professor of medicine at the University
of Colorado.
The FDA announced the alert 19
days after demands for it from mem
bers of Congress.
"This certainly must be a new land
speed record for an agency response to
congressional inquiries," observed
subcommittee chairman Rep. Ron
Wyden, D-Ore. He called FDA's action
"very irresponsible."
