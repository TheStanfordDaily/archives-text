## A 						timely protest 
### 
Rally and fast
show student
desire for peace

Last week's anti-war
rally in White Plaza sent a
strong message to our com
munity and to our leaders in Wash
ington: we don't want war. Amid
speakers, petition signing, draft
information booths, black arm
bands and candles, the message
came across clear and simple.
The spirited turnout of hun
dreds, in the cold and in the middle
of midterms, demonstrated that
this is an issue about which Stan
ford cares.
While some may criticize the
rally for not offering alternative
plans to war, the rally should still
be considered a success on its own
merits. It achieved a number of
goals:
It brought much needed media
coverage to campus, exposing the
fact that colleges are not apathetic
about the potential for war in the
Middle East. Hopefully, such cover
age will cause both leaders and
other students to think twice about
the crisis.
It set the precedent for a non
partisan discussion about war in
the Middle East. By inviting people
of different opinions to speak and
by leaving time for an open mike at
the end, the organizers of the rally
avoided party politics that would
have marred the event.
And it helped personalize the
issue of a possible war in the Mid
dle East. The fact that the rally
was on campus and that students
organized and participated in it
showed others that this is an issue
that needs attention. Student
speakers who know soldiers sitting
in the Saudi desert and speakers

who may be there in a few months
hammered this point home.
Hopefully, some students' six
day fast starting today to protest
the offensive stance taken by the
U.S. military will be as successful.
By choosing to fast during the
upcoming Thanksgiving holiday,
the protesters have the chance to
make an even stronger statement.
On the other side of the coin,
however, the ASSU Senate bill con
demning any non-United Nations
sanctioned aggression against Iraq
by the United States is utterly use
less and out of place.
Such a bill stands to accomplish
as much as a bill condemning rape,
murder or crime. The ASSU Sen
ate would better spend its time and
energy creating ways of informing
students about the crisis in the
Gulf and opening channels of
debate and discussion on campus.
The bill's legitimacy is also in
question since the majority of the
senate was against it, evidenced by
a straw poll including non-voting
members. If the bill does not even
represent the views of the senate,
how can the ASSU think the state
ment speaks for the entire student
body?
While the anti-war rally in
White Plaza and the ensuing fast
can be considered successful
already, much more still needs to
be accomplished. The Stanford
community needs to roll up its
sleeves and start to work together
on this difficult issue.
The University has great poten
tial to lead the way in an intelligent
and focused discussion of what is
to come in the Middle East. Politi
cal historians, professors, veterans
and experts on foreign policy all
stand as resources here just wait
ing to be tapped.
If Stanford is as great a leader in
courage, intelligence and creativity
as it says it is, it will rise to the
challenge in this potentially dark
hour.
