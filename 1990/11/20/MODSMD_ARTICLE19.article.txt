## The 						end of living,.. 
### 
I WENT TO LOS ANGELES last
weekend. No, no, nobody was pointing
a gun at my head, nor was I on drugs;
a couple of friends of mine who live there
were putting on a play, so I road-tripped
down to see it.
Now, LA. bashing comes fairly natu
rally to most people it seems, and espe
cially to me, seeing as how I grew up in
the real California (everything north of
Monterey). Out of respect for my friends
who have to try to be happy there, I
refrained from any particularly nasty
commentary while I was visiting. But
now that I'm here, and they can't hear
me, here goes. ...
Just kidding. There's no real purpose
in harshing on L.A when it's merely a
very extreme representation of the worst
excesses our wonderful modernity has to
offer. Problems which one can find in
many other places — smog, industrial
waste, smog, despoliation of natural
beauty, smog, depletion of natural
resources, smog — are simply more visi
ble and more concentrated in the Los
Angeles basin. There, it's not an abstract
danger; you can feel the rot in your bones.
As my bones ached, I kept thinking of
a piece written by Chief Seattle of the Sal
ishan Indians in the Pacific Northwest,
back in 1854. President Pierce had sent
emissaries to the chief to convince him to
sell his tribal lands to the U.S. govern
ment, promising in return to reserve
some of it for the perpetual use of the Sal
ishan.
In reply, Chief Seattle wrote a letter
talking of his people's relationship with

the land, and how they saw the earth in a
radically different manner than did its
new owners.
Looking out at the LA. skyline, one
section in particular kept coming to mind,
where Chief Seattle wrote, "The air is
precious to the red man, for all things
share the same breath — the beast, the
tree, the man, they all share the same
breath. The white man does not seem to
notice the air he breaths. Like a man
dying for many days, he is numb to the
stench."
What kept this running through my
head was the fact that I, in a matter of a
day, had become numb to the noxiousness
of the air quality that had been apparent
as soon as I came down off the Grapevine.
My nose had ceased to discern the acrid
odor and my eyes had ceased to see the
fuzzy browaoosa. pervading every view.
It made me wonder what Chief Seattle
would've thought had he been around to
see that it's no longer just trees and ani
mals that we share our air with, but also
factory furnaces and about ten zillion
cars.
I looked at my car, a gas-guzzling V-8,
which, on ignition, belches enough smoke
to screen an entire carrier group, and
thought of the leaded, regular gas sitting
in its tank, waiting for the chance to help
poison the atmosphere.
I glanced down the beach, at the
Chevron refinery located conveniently on
the water, its smokestacks built tall
enough to prevent the pollutants from
settling onto the city. They just fall out
somewhere downwind.

I looked at the crowds playing in the
sand and thought of the millions of people
all crammed into that airspace, sucking
down breath after breath of fouled oxy
gen.
I watched a woman up the street use a
hose to wash off her sidewalk, sacrificing
water to laziness in the fourth year of a
drought.
I tried to imagine the scene before me
in 20 years and wonder whether the halt
ing steps now beginning to undo the dam
age of 100 years of industrialization will
have progressed, or whether they will
have been too little at too late a time, and
the Los Angeles of the movie "Blade Run
ner," periodically lit by the burn-off of
waste gases and permanently covered by
a synthetic-chemical cloud, will have
become reality.
Finally, I thought of the last lines of
Chief Seattle's letter, how they had never
really spoken to me as forcefully as they
did at that moment, standing in the heat
and the glare of L.A.:
"Where is the thicket? Gone.
Where is the eagle? Gone.
The end of living and the beginning of
survival."
