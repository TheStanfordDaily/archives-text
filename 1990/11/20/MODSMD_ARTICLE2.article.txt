# Kingscote tenants hassled, not helped
## 
### Cecilia Tom Editorial staff 
Kingscote Gardens may occupy
the best non-University housing
location on campus, but some stu
dents who try to take advantage of
it find themselves seeking legal
advice instead.
Although the quaint apartment
building at 586 Lagunita Drive,
which rests on Stanford-leased
land, cries out convenience and
beauty, several residents complain
that they suffer from strained
relationships with their building
manager.
Sixteen students recently
signed a letter addressed to
Graeme Howard, the owner of the
building, documenting evidence of
their manager R. Lyn Mack's
"hesitancy ... to repair and main
tain the premises," her disregard
for the tenants' personal safety
and her "repeated attempts ... to
intimidate [residents!" via threats
of eviction.
Mack declined to return phone
calls. When approached, she
stressed there is "nothing going
on" at Kingscote and refused to
comment further.
Approximately 55 people live in

the three-story building, includ
ing undergraduate and graduate
students, visiting professors and
other permanent residents. Mack
lives on the first floor of the build
ing.
The students said they are
unable to rectify the situation
because Mack always tells them to
direct their complaints to Michael
O'Brien, the property manager of
A Better Property Management,
the company that manages the
building. Mack then answers the
phone herself, they said.
O'Brien said the students have
been informed by the ASSU Legal
Counseling services that they
should direct written letters to
him if they have problems with
their apartments. So far, he has
not received anything, he said.
O'Brien added that he and
Howard met with Jewel Hudson
from the legal service last Monday
to discuss the situation, but
stressed that the students "have
no legal grounds for further
action."
Students said although
Howard had a meeting with Diane
Paulson from University Real
Estate and Lands Management
while he was on campus, he
refused to talk to the students.
"He just came here for show,"
many students claimed.
O'Brien said Howard hired the
management company to take
care of Kingscote, and "does not
get with its operations.
He said Howard lives on the East
Coast and was here only to visit
some relatives.
Paulson could not be reached
for comment,
Two students who moved into
the building this fall said they
have had particularly unpleasant
experiences with Mack.
One of them, Angela Bakker,
almost had her car towed away
the first day when she was
unloading her belongings.
Although her lease specifies that
no illegal parking is allowed, load
ing and unloading are written
exceptions, she said.
Her roommate, Laurel Sulli
van, said she was locked in her
apartment for more than two
hours because both the lock and
the telephone line were defective.
Before the incident, the two
students had written to Mack
demanding what they felt was
entitled to them — "an initially
working phone line, and a safe
dwelling."
However, it took a letter to Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy

from Sullivan's father, a threat of
legal action and a protest gesture
of moving out for one night to get
the lock and phone line fixed, Sul
livan said.
O'Brien, however, refuted the
students' allegation, saying all
written "fix-it" requests are
"promptly dealt with."
Robert Weisberg, a law profes
sor and resident fellow at Murray
House, had informally advised
Bakker and Sullivan, who lived in
Murray last year. He said the
phone line was the "landlord's
problem, not the tenants'"
because the defect was in the
building before the students
moved in.
Weisberg added that a lock is an
"implied warranty" that does not
need to be expressly written on
the lease.
Weisberg said that although
the University may not be legally
obligated to help the students, it is
responsible to ensure that "sub
lettees get minimal habitability."
In his letter to Kennedy, the
student's father expressed dismay
that he was told "Stanford Uni
versity takes no responsibility and
will do nothing to help you." He
said Stanford even refused to pro
vide him with the address of A
Better Property Management.
Weisberg said the situation
"raises the question that was
raised in the more dramatic case
of Webb Ranch." Last year, when
The Daily discovered that the
owner of Webb was breaking labor
laws and mistreating workers, the

University refused to intervene on
the grounds that it is not respon
sible for the goings-on on land it
leases out.
Junior Charlene Son com
plained about Mack's "low level of
tolerance for noise," and said she
would call in the middle of the
night if someone is merely walk
ing around the room. "A person
needs to be human," said Son,
exasperated.
She added that Mack does not
allow stereos in the rooms,
although this is not a rule that is
expressly written in the apart
ment regulations. A note from
Mack to Son reads, "I told you
how disturbed I was to see [com
pact discs] coming in the mail to
you ... I am more than wounded
when my sleep is disturbed — I
am angry."
O'Brien said students are not
allowed to play their stereos
because that may disturb other
residents. Kingscote "is a place for
serious students," he asserted.
O'Brien added that rules for
silence are expressly written in
the house rules. "We do not allow
rowdiness in the building."
Four students who live
together on the second floor have
been threatened with eviction for
"violating the rule for being noisy
after 10 o'clock," according to one
student, who wishes to remain
anonymous. She said Mack unjus
tifiably protested their walking on
the wooden floor at night when
the padding that she promised
was never delivered.

Mack "said it is not worth it
because she's planning on evicting
us," the student said.
In one notice to the students,
Mack complained about telephone
ringing at night: "I turn my phone
off at night — an emergency can
be handled through the police
department."
"'She thought it was our mali
ciousness to keep her awake," the
student added.
Mack also unreasonably for
bids overnight guests unless she
gives a written consent, the stu
dent said. "Operating costs ...
elevate with each resident plus
wear and tear on the unit," Mack
wrote in a memorandum to some
residents.
Son's roommate Elizabeth
Ramirez said she received three
letters from Mack last Wednesday
asking whether the students have
decided to move out. Ramirez said
they have never indicated a desire
to get out of the lease.
Son said she was surprised to
be told there have been 20 other
complaints from Kingscote resi
dents when she went to the ASSU
Legal Counseling Services for
advice.
Bill Faulkner, an attorney at
the counseling services, declined
to verify that his office has coun
seled students who live in
Kingscote.
Son said she plans to write up a
list of tenant rights and distribute
it to fellow Kingscote residents.

written "fix-it" requests are
"promptly dealt with."
Robert Weisberg, a law profes
sor and resident fellow at Murray
House, had informally advised
Bakker and Sullivan, who lived in
Murray last year. He said the
phone line was the "landlord's
problem, not the tenants'"
because the defect was in the
building before the students
moved in.
Weisberg added that a lock is an
"implied warranty" that does not
need to be expressly written on
the lease.
Weisberg said that although
the University may not be legally
obligated to help the students, it is
responsible to ensure that "sub
lettees get minimal habitability."
In his letter to Kennedy, the
student's father expressed dismay
that he was told "Stanford Uni
versity takes no responsibility and
will do nothing to help you." He
said Stanford even refused to pro
vide him with the address of A
Better Property Management.
Weisberg said the situation
"raises the question that was
raised in the more dramatic case
of Webb Ranch." Last year, when
The Daily discovered that the
owner of Webb was breaking labor
laws and mistreating workers, the

University refused to intervene on
the grounds that it is not respon
sible for the goings-on on land it
leases out.
Junior Charlene Son com
plained about Mack's "low level of
tolerance for noise," and said she
would call in the middle of the
night if someone is merely walk
ing around the room. "A person
needs to be human," said Son,
exasperated.
She added that Mack does not
allow stereos in the rooms,
although this is not a rule that is
expressly written in the apart
ment regulations. A note from
Mack to Son reads, "I told you
how disturbed I was to see [com
pact discs] coming in the mail to
you ... I am more than wounded
when my sleep is disturbed — I
am angry."
O'Brien said students are not
allowed to play their stereos
because that may disturb other
residents. Kingscote "is a place for
serious students," he asserted.
O'Brien added that rules for
silence are expressly written in
the house rules. "We do not allow
rowdiness in the building."
Four students who live
together on the second floor have
been threatened with eviction for
"violating the rule for being noisy
after 10 o'clock," according to one
student, who wishes to remain
anonymous. She said Mack unjus
tifiably protested their walking on
the wooden floor at night when
the padding that she promised
was never delivered.

Mack "said it is not worth it
because she's planning on evicting
us," the student said.
In one notice to the students,
Mack complained about telephone
ringing at night: "I turn my phone
off at night — an emergency can
be handled through the police
department."
"'She thought it was our mali
ciousness to keep her awake," the
student added.
Mack also unreasonably for
bids overnight guests unless she
gives a written consent, the stu
dent said. "Operating costs ...
elevate with each resident plus
wear and tear on the unit," Mack
wrote in a memorandum to some
residents.
Son's roommate Elizabeth
Ramirez said she received three
letters from Mack last Wednesday
asking whether the students have
decided to move out. Ramirez said
they have never indicated a desire
to get out of the lease.
Son said she was surprised to
be told there have been 20 other
complaints from Kingscote resi
dents when she went to the ASSU
Legal Counseling Services for
advice.
Bill Faulkner, an attorney at
the counseling services, declined
to verify that his office has coun
seled students who live in
Kingscote.
Son said she plans to write up a
list of tenant rights and distribute
it to fellow Kingscote residents.
Kingscote Gardens may occupy
the best non-University housing
location on campus, but some stu
dents who try to take advantage of
it find themselves seeking legal
advice instead.
Although the quaint apartment
building at 586 Lagunita Drive,
which rests on Stanford-leased
land, cries out convenience and
beauty, several residents complain
that they suffer from strained
relationships with their building
manager.
Sixteen students recently
signed a letter addressed to
Graeme Howard, the owner of the
building, documenting evidence of
their manager R. Lyn Mack's
"hesitancy ... to repair and main
tain the premises," her disregard
for the tenants' personal safety
and her "repeated attempts ... to
intimidate [residents!" via threats
of eviction.
Mack declined to return phone
calls. When approached, she
stressed there is "nothing going
on" at Kingscote and refused to
comment further.
Approximately 55 people live in

the three-story building, includ
ing undergraduate and graduate
students, visiting professors and
other permanent residents. Mack
lives on the first floor of the build
ing.
The students said they are
unable to rectify the situation
because Mack always tells them to
direct their complaints to Michael
O'Brien, the property manager of
A Better Property Management,
the company that manages the
building. Mack then answers the
phone herself, they said.
O'Brien said the students have
been informed by the ASSU Legal
Counseling services that they
should direct written letters to
him if they have problems with
their apartments. So far, he has
not received anything, he said.
O'Brien added that he and
Howard met with Jewel Hudson
from the legal service last Monday
to discuss the situation, but
stressed that the students "have
no legal grounds for further
action."
Students said although
Howard had a meeting with Diane
Paulson from University Real
Estate and Lands Management
while he was on campus, he
refused to talk to the students.
"He just came here for show,"
many students claimed.
O'Brien said Howard hired the
management company to take
care of Kingscote, and "does not
get with its operations.
He said Howard lives on the East
Coast and was here only to visit
some relatives.
Paulson could not be reached
for comment,
Two students who moved into
the building this fall said they
have had particularly unpleasant
experiences with Mack.
One of them, Angela Bakker,
almost had her car towed away
the first day when she was
unloading her belongings.
Although her lease specifies that
no illegal parking is allowed, load
ing and unloading are written
exceptions, she said.
Her roommate, Laurel Sulli
van, said she was locked in her
apartment for more than two
hours because both the lock and
the telephone line were defective.
Before the incident, the two
students had written to Mack
demanding what they felt was
entitled to them — "an initially
working phone line, and a safe
dwelling."
However, it took a letter to Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy

from Sullivan's father, a threat of
legal action and a protest gesture
of moving out for one night to get
the lock and phone line fixed, Sul
livan said.
O'Brien, however, refuted the
students' allegation, saying all
written "fix-it" requests are
"promptly dealt with."
