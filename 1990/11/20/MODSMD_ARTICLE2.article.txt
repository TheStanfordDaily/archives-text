# Kingscote tenants hassled, not helped

Kingscote Gardens may occupy
the best non-University housing
location on campus, but some stu
dents who try to take advantage of
it find themselves seeking legal

building at 586 Lagunita Drive,
which rests on Stanford-leased
land, cries out convenience and
beauty, several residents complain
that they suffer from strained

direct their complaints to Michael
O'Brien, the property manager of
A Better Property Management,

O'Brien said the students have
been informed by the ASSU Legal
Counseling services that they
should direct written letters to
him if they have problems with
their apartments. So far, he has

O'Brien added that he and
Howard met with Jewel Hudson
from the legal service last Monday
to discuss the situation, but
stressed that the students "have

Students said although

Paulson from University Real
