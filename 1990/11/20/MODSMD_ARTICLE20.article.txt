## Ethnic and gender studies are necessary in today's America 
### 
CURRENTLY THE FACULTY Sen
ate is considering a proposal that
will:
• Include an American Cultures distri
bution requirement, which is designed to
"cultivate students' understanding of the
history, significance and consequences of
racial, ethnic and religious differences in
the culture and society of the United
States;"
• Turn the former "asterisk" for Non-
Western Culture into a World Cultures
requirement;
• Make Gender Studies an "asterisk;"
and
• Collapse requirements 4 and 5 into
one requirement.
If passed, the proposal will come into
effect starting with the next freshman
class.
We feel that the purpose of higher
education is to help people become
responsible and productive citizens. The
distribution requirements introduce stu
dents to the areas of thought they need

to consider to become such citizens.
By the year 2000, the mcgority of Cali
fornians will be people of color. A few
decades after that, people of color will
represent the msgority in the United
States itself. In addition, minorities and
women will comprise 85 percent of the
entering American work force by the end
of the century.
Considering that distribution require
ments should help students interact bet
ter with society and that the country's
demographics are changing rapidly, we
feel that it is more important than ever
for the requirement system to include
ethnic and gender studies. The American
Cultures requirement would encompass
these ethnic studies. In fact, the 1989
University Committee on Minority
Issues explicitly recommended that the
requirement system be changed to
include ethnic and gender studies.
Although Cultures, Ideas and Values
proposed to include non-Western culture
and gender issues in its curriculum.

many feel that it fails to do so. In addi
tion, most CIV tracks do not focus on
cultural and gender interactions in
America.
Some members of the Stanford com
munity have complained that including
ethnic and gender studies in the require
ment system will overemphasize such
studies and de-emphasize other require
ments.
We feel that there is no emphasis
problem because most people have never
studied ethnic or gender issues, which
indicates an underemphasis on ethnic
and gender studies in American educa
tion. Stanford students, including many
Asian-Americans, have not had the
opportunity to learn about the Asian-
American heritage.
An American Cultures requirement
would not detract from the "techie"
requirements or even overemphasize the
"fuzzy" ones. Behind the requirement
system is the philosophy that we must
learn to work with each other to make

the world run.
In other words, people are the focus of
the distribution requirement system.
Because the American Cultures require
ment would directly address interactions
between people, it transcends academic
classifications of "humanities vs. sci
ence." All students can stand to gain
from such a requirement.
Finally, we believe that ethnic and
gender studies courses would not be
"white-bashing sessions" or the indoctri
nation of "politically correct" thinking.
Rather, ethnic and gender studies will
expand many students' minds by expos
ing them in an academic setting to issues
they may otherwise not consider.
