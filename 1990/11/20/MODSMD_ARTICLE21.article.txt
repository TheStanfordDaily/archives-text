# Needless repairs are aggravating, waste vital funds
## 
### 
Bravo! Stanford University has done
it again. A brand new way to inconve
nience, distress and anger its residents
and waste money at the same time.
A few days ago the "earthquake
repair" crews moved into our apartment
and we moved out. But not really. It's
just that all our furniture and wall fix
tures are heaped in the center of each
room, covered in dirty plastic.
We eat dinner sitting in a corner star
ing at bare walls and peeking around the
heap at the TV we have pulled out.
And why is this being done? "There

are cracks in the wall that need to be
repaired," is the pat answer from the
Escondido Village Facilities Office.
And will these repairs make the build
ings safer in the event of future earth
quakes? "No. These repair* are purely
cosmetic."
Cosmetic?! But we can hardly see the
cracks! And who is paying for the
repairs? "Some funds from the Federal
Emergency Management Act and some
funds from the University."
FEMA?! Isn't that for emergency
assistance? Nobody's life or livelihood is
at stake here, unless you count the con
tractor doing the job. And isn't the
University going through a tight budget
crunch? Cutting what most consider
essential services in other areas of stu
dent life?
