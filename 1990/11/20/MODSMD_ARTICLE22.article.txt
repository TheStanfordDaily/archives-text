# 'Scramble bands' provide outlet for creativity
## 
### 
I am writing this letter in response to
Elizabeth Eng's plea in the Nov. 9 Daily
in which she asked the $64 question,
"Why don't we get a REAL Band?"
What do Harvard, Yale, Princeton,
Columbia, Brown, Dartmouth, Penn,
William and Mary, Williams and
Amherst have in common? Well, they all
have intelligent, well motivated students
They also all have bands like the incom
parable Stanford Band. Why?
A primary consideration is that it
would take anywhere from 5 to 10 per
cent of the student body of any one of
these institutions to form a musical

horde like the one Eng describes.
A second, more subtle reason is free
dom of expression. The world of the
"scramble band" (as we call them "back
east") opens unlimited avenues of cre
ativity to the inventive band member.
As to the accusation that the Band is
having their "own little party," having
spent a number of long nights writing
shows I can assure you that the intent of
a halftime show is to amuse the crowd,
poke fun at authority and, believe it or
not, provide some good music.
Also, the overriding motivation is to
provide support for the athletes.
I don't want to put down huge bands
like USC's or Ohio State's, but I think
that the evolution of the "Marching
Band" into what we have now is a very
natural one.
