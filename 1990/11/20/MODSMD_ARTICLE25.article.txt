The Web of Disinformation:
Churchill's Yugoslav Blunder

Half a century ago, Drazha
Mihailovich, guerrilla resistance leader in
occupied Yugoslavia, was a hero in the
Allied world. The press, starved for good
news from the European front, celebrated
the exploits of his forces, known as Chet
niks, as a symbol of resistance to Nazi
tyranny. Time featured him on a cover in
the spring of 1942. The Allies, most
importantly Britain (which had primacy
in determining Balkan policy), accorded
him full recognition and support.
But by the end of 1943 the Allies had
abandoned Mihailovich, his forces now
under the shadow of accusations of inac
tivity and collaboration, in favor of the
rival Communist-led Partisan movement
under Josip Broz Tito.
Tito, lavished with British and Ameri
can arms and later aided by the Red
Army, emerged victorious from
Yugoslavia's bloody civil war and soon
took power, ruling until his death in 1980.
In 1946, the new Communist regime
firmly in control, Mihailovich was cap
tured, tried and executed as a traitor.
The story behind this dramatic and
fateful shift in policy is the subject of
David Martin's new book. The work is
essentially a response to the long
accepted line of the British establish
ment, which was eager to justify its policy
and, following the 1948 Tito-Stalin rift, to
court the Yugoslav leader.
Thus, historians of the West and East
have generally seen eye to eye on this sub
ject, claiming that Churchill's policy
switch was simply recognition of the fact

that the Partisans were the sole popular
and effective anti-Axis force in
Yugoslavia.
Martin is a journalist and political ana
lyst who has spent many years trying to
clear Mihailovich's name and revise West
ern historiography on this topic. (An ear
lier book, "Patriot or Traitor," was pub
lished by the Hoover Institution.)
His latest work, painstakingly docu
mented but consistently and provoca
tively readable, is an effort to show:
• That Mihailovich's movement was
not collaborationist but consistently anti-
Axis,
• That the relative contributions of the
two forces to the war effort did not justify
exclusive support for the Partisans, and
• That the decision to abandon
Mihailovich for Tito, which was "to affect
the course of Yugoslav history and the
balance of power in Europe," would likely
not have been made if not for a deliberate
campaign of falsification and sabotage in
British wartime intelligence agencies —
the "web of disinformation" of the book's
title.
Martin traces this web to one particu
larly hard-working and successful spider:
James Klugmann, an officer at the Cairo
headquarters for British missions to
Yugoslavia. He claims that Klugmann,
who was later a leader of the British Com
munist Party, was a Soviet mole, and
indeed none other than the missing
"Fifth Man" in the famous spy ring of
Klugmann's Cambridge comrades Kim
Philby, Guy Burgess, et al.
The evidence for Martin's claim is
entirely circumstantial, as he admits. But
in detailing the obvious doctoring of intel
ligence reports that went on in Cairo, he
makes a plausible case that Klugmann
was in a position, and had the motivation,
to lead such a disinformation campaign
on behalf of the Communist cause.

This issue will certainly be a mqjor
selling point for the book and will give spy
fans a lot to play with.
However, the book is not really about
Klugmann; it aims to tell a much wider
story. The chapters often seem disjointed,
as though written independently of one
another. Together, though, they present a
whole fascinating array of personalities
— some sharing Tito's political sympa
thies, others quite conservative — who
knowingly or unknowingly swallowed and
spread the myths about Yugoslavia origi
nating from Cairo.
Prime among these were two British
liaison officers with the Partisans,
William Deakin and Fitzroy Maclean
(later frequent guests at Tito's palatial
Adriatic villas), who were close to
Churchill and whose demonstrably outra
geous reports of massive Partisan
strength and Mihailovich collaboration
greatly influenced the prime minister.
Meanwhile, British and American offi
cers sent to Mihailovich reports that were
ignored, waited for supplies that never
arrived and listened to BBC reports prais
ing the Partisans for Chetnik actions they
had just witnessed. (One of these officers,
Michael Lees, has just written his own
book on the subject, "The Rape Of Ser
bia.")
It is always clear where Martin's sym
pathies lie. But he does not shy away from
confronting facts and documents put for
ward by those on the other side of this
historical controversy. He also leads the
reader briefly through the complexities of
Yugoslavia's internal ethnic and political
mess (particularly the frightful mas
sacres of Serbs by Croatian fascists),
which prevented the formation of a
strong, united front opposed to both
Hitler and Tito, and contributed to the
war's ultimate outcome.
Still, Martin contends that British and

American aid to Tito at the expense of
Mihailovich was essential to "the commu
nization of Yugoslavia." And the docu
mentation he has compiled is convincing
enough to have prompted the wartime
head of the British Foreign Office South
ern Department to write: "If the informa
tion contained in your work had been
available to us at the time, our whole pol
ity might, and probably would, have been
very different."
In light of the collapse of the post-war
order in Eastern Europe, including the
dramatic disintegration over the past sev

eral years of the entire political and eco
nomic structure of Titoist Yugoslavia, his
torical reevaluations such as David Mar
tin's take on added significance. It should

the exploits of his forces, known as Chet
niks, as a symbol of resistance to Nazi
tyranny. Time featured him on a cover in
the spring of 1942. The Allies, most
importantly Britain (which had primacy
in determining Balkan policy), accorded
him full recognition and support.
But by the end of 1943 the Allies had
abandoned Mihailovich, his forces now
under the shadow of accusations of inac
tivity and collaboration, in favor of the
rival Communist-led Partisan movement
under Josip Broz Tito.
Tito, lavished with British and Ameri
can arms and later aided by the Red
Army, emerged victorious from
Yugoslavia's bloody civil war and soon
took power, ruling until his death in 1980.
In 1946, the new Communist regime
firmly in control, Mihailovich was cap
tured, tried and executed as a traitor.
The story behind this dramatic and
fateful shift in policy is the subject of
David Martin's new book. The work is
essentially a response to the long
accepted line of the British establish
ment, which was eager to justify its policy
and, following the 1948 Tito-Stalin rift, to
court the Yugoslav leader.
Thus, historians of the West and East
have generally seen eye to eye on this sub
ject, claiming that Churchill's policy
switch was simply recognition of the fact

that the Partisans were the sole popular
and effective anti-Axis force in
Yugoslavia.
Martin is a journalist and political ana
lyst who has spent many years trying to
clear Mihailovich's name and revise West
ern historiography on this topic. (An ear
lier book, "Patriot or Traitor," was pub
lished by the Hoover Institution.)
His latest work, painstakingly docu
mented but consistently and provoca
tively readable, is an effort to show:
• That Mihailovich's movement was
not collaborationist but consistently anti-
Axis,
• That the relative contributions of the
two forces to the war effort did not justify
exclusive support for the Partisans, and
• That the decision to abandon
Mihailovich for Tito, which was "to affect
the course of Yugoslav history and the
balance of power in Europe," would likely
not have been made if not for a deliberate
campaign of falsification and sabotage in
British wartime intelligence agencies —
the "web of disinformation" of the book's
title.
Martin traces this web to one particu
larly hard-working and successful spider:
James Klugmann, an officer at the Cairo
headquarters for British missions to
Yugoslavia. He claims that Klugmann,
who was later a leader of the British Com
munist Party, was a Soviet mole, and
indeed none other than the missing
"Fifth Man" in the famous spy ring of
Klugmann's Cambridge comrades Kim
Philby, Guy Burgess, et al.
The evidence for Martin's claim is
entirely circumstantial, as he admits. But
in detailing the obvious doctoring of intel
ligence reports that went on in Cairo, he
makes a plausible case that Klugmann
was in a position, and had the motivation,
to lead such a disinformation campaign
on behalf of the Communist cause.

This issue will certainly be a mqjor
selling point for the book and will give spy
fans a lot to play with.
However, the book is not really about
Klugmann; it aims to tell a much wider
story. The chapters often seem disjointed,
as though written independently of one
another. Together, though, they present a
whole fascinating array of personalities
— some sharing Tito's political sympa
thies, others quite conservative — who
knowingly or unknowingly swallowed and
spread the myths about Yugoslavia origi
nating from Cairo.
Prime among these were two British
liaison officers with the Partisans,
William Deakin and Fitzroy Maclean
(later frequent guests at Tito's palatial
Adriatic villas), who were close to
Churchill and whose demonstrably outra
geous reports of massive Partisan
strength and Mihailovich collaboration
greatly influenced the prime minister.
Meanwhile, British and American offi
cers sent to Mihailovich reports that were
ignored, waited for supplies that never
arrived and listened to BBC reports prais
ing the Partisans for Chetnik actions they
had just witnessed. (One of these officers,
Michael Lees, has just written his own
book on the subject, "The Rape Of Ser
bia.")
It is always clear where Martin's sym
pathies lie. But he does not shy away from
confronting facts and documents put for
ward by those on the other side of this
historical controversy. He also leads the
reader briefly through the complexities of
Yugoslavia's internal ethnic and political
mess (particularly the frightful mas
sacres of Serbs by Croatian fascists),
which prevented the formation of a
strong, united front opposed to both
Hitler and Tito, and contributed to the
war's ultimate outcome.
Still, Martin contends that British and

American aid to Tito at the expense of
Mihailovich was essential to "the commu
nization of Yugoslavia." And the docu
mentation he has compiled is convincing
enough to have prompted the wartime
head of the British Foreign Office South
ern Department to write: "If the informa
tion contained in your work had been
available to us at the time, our whole pol
ity might, and probably would, have been
very different."
In light of the collapse of the post-war
order in Eastern Europe, including the
dramatic disintegration over the past sev

eral years of the entire political and eco
nomic structure of Titoist Yugoslavia, his
torical reevaluations such as David Mar
tin's take on added significance. It should
receive a lot of attention in Yugoslavia,
where these issues can finally be dis
cussed freely.
It deserves equal attention here in the
West, where those who made polity, as is
often the case, did not have to suffer the
consequences.
