Sidney Blumenthal's latest work narrates Amer
ica's political life for the past six years. He states
that it has been a time of empty, simplified politics,
in which Gorbachev and threats of a disintegrating,
almost non-existent Cold War served as covers for
the real issues facing America.
While the topic is current and interesting, I woultf
have to recommend this book to the more politically
minded person. Blumenthal's revelations have more
impact on those who have closely followed the
events. The book contains much name dropping and
references which may wane the less knowledgeable
reader's interest.
One of Blumenthal's main focuses is the Iran-
Contra affair during the Reagan administration. He
points to the scandal that was covered by a "cloud of
patriotism." Even the Democrats feared a confronta-

tion would somehow upset arms control negotiations
with the Soviets and reap disastrous consequences.
The result was Oliver North, "an example of
American heroism." The propaganda that portrayed
North as a brave individual fighting against the sys
tem became the epitome of the "management style"
that governed all political campaigns.
He contrasts this image with a short biography of
North which portrays him as a mentally inconsis
tent, easily indoctrinated hypocrite who wavered
between mental breakdowns and religious fanati
cism. Blumenthal often employs this method of par
alleling the image of an event with the facts about
the people involved to show the irony of the situa
tion. However, biographies of this sort often tend to
be lengthy to the point of distraction from the real
topic at hand.
Blumenthal also provides some very interesting
information concerning the summit talks between
Reagan and Gorbachev. He emphasizes that they
were rather meaningless in content, especially on
the part of Reagan who provided no agenda, even at
Gorbachev's request for one. Reagan also had very

few thoughts or opinions at these meetings on any of
the issues except for his insistence on the Star Wars
program, Blumenthal writes.
The author tries to foster a balance between com
plex political theory and anecdotal interludes. How
ever, this provides a structure that is sometimes dif
ficult to follow. While his amusing tangents are wel
come to the reader, they often seem to be poorly
placed in the midst of a complex political analysis,
making it difficult for the reader to follow his point.
One of the high points in the book is his account
of the 1988 election. He reveals the emptiness of the
campaign through a comparison between the issues
at hand and the priorities of the individual candi
dates. While crime and the declining econofny ought
to have been the focus of the campaign, the Cold War
and the "technological competition" with the Rus
sians was being promoted.
He compares this campaign to the McCarthy
Communist trials. Anyone who felt that such patrio
tism shouldn't have been the first and foremost con
cern was committing political suicide. Blumenthal
sees this as an "ideology of and for the past" since

Gorbachev had already taken steps in a conciliatory
direction.
Blumenthal also includes an amusing description
concerning Dan Quayle's training to become a politi
cian. He describes videos in which Quayle is being
trained to speak publicly and his only explanations
to questions about his motivation for running are
extremely inane, reflecting the personality that has
become America's best-known political joke.
The book is fairly lengthy and tends to shake the
reader's interest. The structure seems a bit complex,
but perhaps this is deliberate in order to convey the
political confusion of a time in which, as Blumenthal
quotes John Buchan, "the old world was crumbling
and there was no unanimity about the new."
I would recommend this perhaps for those who
are enthusiastically interested and informed, but for
others, I do not suggest that they pledge alliance to
this book.
