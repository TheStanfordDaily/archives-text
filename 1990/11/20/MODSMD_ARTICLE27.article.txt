## Spikers streak into last match 
### Harold Yu Staff writer 
Only a handful of teams can claim
any kind of superiority over the Stan
ford women's volleyball team the past
two seasons.
One is No.l UCLA, a squad that has
defeated the Cardinal six consecutive
times and is currently 29-1.
The other is San Jose State.
No kidding. The unheralded Spar
tans are No. 10 in the country, headed
for the NCAA tournament and are a
legitimate force in the power-packed Big
West Conference. They also can claim
victories against Stanford in their last
two meetings.
This is the main reason that the No.
3 Cardinal will have a little added moti
vation when the Spartans visit Burn
ham Pavilion tonight. The 7:30 p.m.
contest is the last regular season match
for Stanford this year.
"I want to treat this match as a play
off match," Stanford coach Don Shaw
said. "San Jose State is a playoff team.
They're the kind of team we'll be seeing
in the NCAA tournament."
The Cardinal has won 10 matches in
a row and is looking to maintain its
momentum before the first round of the
regional playoffs. The team also has a
remote chance at a No. 2 end-of-the-sea
son national ranking if it wins. Finish
ing No. 2 is the only way the Cardinal
can avoid playing in the same regional
as the top-ranked Bruins.
The team will also be seeking a little
vengeance. "Last year [when we lost at
San Jose] was such a huge upset," setter
Carrie Feldman said. "Since we've lost
to them twice, revenge is what we're
looking for."
If things continue as they have,
revenge is what they should get. In the
team's last ten matches, the Cardinal
has won 30 games to their opponents'
seven.

Four Stanford hitters are hitting over
.310 in Pacific 10 Conference play. Hard
hitting middle blocker Amy Cooper is
leading the conference with a .352 per
centage. Sophomore All-American Bev
Oden is second at .327. Junior left-side
hitter Kristin Klein is fourth at .315 and
senior Jessica Benton is right behind
with a .314 mark.
The return of Kristi Paaso will fur
ther complicate matters for San Jose
State. The sophomore hitter has recov
ered from back and ankle injuries that
sidelined her since the team's first road
trip. She has recently shown the form
that earned her a starting position as a
freshman last year.
"Kristi is playing really well," Feld
man said. "She's mixing up her hits and
swinging really hard."
Tonight's contest will also be an emo
tional finale for three Cardinal players.
Seniors Tracy Hughes, Cherly Conly
and Benton will each be competing in
the last regular season match of their
Stanford careers.
Benton, who starts at middle blocker,
has made dramatic improvements in her
game. The San Diego, Calif, native saw
her first real playing time last season
and has since emerged as an offensive
force. While teams focus on superstars
Klein and Oden, Benton has been
swinging away. With 120 kills, Benton
already has more kills than her total last
year. She will also finish in the top ten in

hitting percentage in the Pac-10.
Hughes has become a primary defen
sive substitute amid a heat of competi
tors. She has been instrumental in
Stanford's ability to control the ball. In
her freshman season, Hughes con
tributed solidly to the Cardinal team
that went to the national championship
match.
"The match will be emotional for
me," Hughes said. "I've been through a
lot here and volleyball has been a big
part of that."
Conly is a gifted passer and one of
Shaw's key defensive players. Last sea
son, she played in 19 matches and con
tributed 49 digs. "This year Cheryl has
done a good job," Shaw said. "She hasn't
got the playing time she did last season
but she's handled it well."
The Spartans will attempt to ruin the
sentimental occasion with an upset. San
Jose State relies upon its two left-side
hitters, Dawnis Wilson and Betsy Welsh.
Wilson is averaging 4.7 kills and 3.92
digs per game. She is hitting .289 on the
season. Welsh averages 4.29 kills and
2.99 digs a game.
San Jose State defeated then-No. 2
University of the Pacific earlier in the
season and has downed defending
national champion Long Beach State.
"They've become a real rival for us,"
Hughes said. "We lost to them in the
spring and we've been hungry for them
ever since."

freshman last year.
"Kristi is playing really well," Feld
man said. "She's mixing up her hits and
swinging really hard."
Tonight's contest will also be an emo
tional finale for three Cardinal players.
Seniors Tracy Hughes, Cherly Conly
and Benton will each be competing in
the last regular season match of their
Stanford careers.
Benton, who starts at middle blocker,
has made dramatic improvements in her
game. The San Diego, Calif, native saw
her first real playing time last season
and has since emerged as an offensive
force. While teams focus on superstars
Klein and Oden, Benton has been
swinging away. With 120 kills, Benton
already has more kills than her total last
year. She will also finish in the top ten in

hitting percentage in the Pac-10.
Hughes has become a primary defen
sive substitute amid a heat of competi
tors. She has been instrumental in
Stanford's ability to control the ball. In
her freshman season, Hughes con
tributed solidly to the Cardinal team
that went to the national championship
match.
"The match will be emotional for
me," Hughes said. "I've been through a
lot here and volleyball has been a big
part of that."
Conly is a gifted passer and one of
Shaw's key defensive players. Last sea
son, she played in 19 matches and con
tributed 49 digs. "This year Cheryl has
done a good job," Shaw said. "She hasn't
got the playing time she did last season
but she's handled it well."
The Spartans will attempt to ruin the
sentimental occasion with an upset. San
Jose State relies upon its two left-side
hitters, Dawnis Wilson and Betsy Welsh.
Wilson is averaging 4.7 kills and 3.92
digs per game. She is hitting .289 on the
season. Welsh averages 4.29 kills and
2.99 digs a game.
San Jose State defeated then-No. 2
University of the Pacific earlier in the
season and has downed defending
national champion Long Beach State.
"They've become a real rival for us,"
Hughes said. "We lost to them in the
spring and we've been hungry for them
ever since."

Bev Oden and her cohorts have one last regular season match before they gun for the
national championship In the NCAA playoffs. Tonight they will be seeking revenge
against the No. 10 San Jose State Spartans.
Only a handful of teams can claim
any kind of superiority over the Stan
ford women's volleyball team the past
two seasons.
One is No.l UCLA, a squad that has
defeated the Cardinal six consecutive
times and is currently 29-1.
The other is San Jose State.
No kidding. The unheralded Spar
tans are No. 10 in the country, headed
for the NCAA tournament and are a
legitimate force in the power-packed Big
West Conference. They also can claim
victories against Stanford in their last
two meetings.
This is the main reason that the No.
3 Cardinal will have a little added moti
vation when the Spartans visit Burn
ham Pavilion tonight. The 7:30 p.m.
contest is the last regular season match
for Stanford this year.
"I want to treat this match as a play
off match," Stanford coach Don Shaw
said. "San Jose State is a playoff team.
They're the kind of team we'll be seeing
in the NCAA tournament."
The Cardinal has won 10 matches in
a row and is looking to maintain its
momentum before the first round of the
regional playoffs. The team also has a
remote chance at a No. 2 end-of-the-sea
son national ranking if it wins. Finish
ing No. 2 is the only way the Cardinal
can avoid playing in the same regional
as the top-ranked Bruins.
The team will also be seeking a little
vengeance. "Last year [when we lost at
San Jose] was such a huge upset," setter
Carrie Feldman said. "Since we've lost
to them twice, revenge is what we're
looking for."
If things continue as they have,
revenge is what they should get. In the
team's last ten matches, the Cardinal
has won 30 games to their opponents'
seven.

Four Stanford hitters are hitting over
.310 in Pacific 10 Conference play. Hard
hitting middle blocker Amy Cooper is
leading the conference with a .352 per
centage. Sophomore All-American Bev
Oden is second at .327. Junior left-side
hitter Kristin Klein is fourth at .315 and
senior Jessica Benton is right behind
with a .314 mark.
The return of Kristi Paaso will fur
ther complicate matters for San Jose
State. The sophomore hitter has recov
ered from back and ankle injuries that
sidelined her since the team's first road
trip. She has recently shown the form
that earned her a starting position as a
freshman last year.
"Kristi is playing really well," Feld
man said. "She's mixing up her hits and
swinging really hard."
