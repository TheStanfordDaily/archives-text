# Women's Volleyball vs. San Jose State
## 
### 
TONIGHT — 7:30 p.m. start at Burnham Pavilion.
RECORDS — Stanford (24-3, 16-2 and 2nd in Pac-10 play), ranked No. 3 in the nation.
San Jose State (21-6, 12-6 In Big West), ranked No. 10.
NOTES - Stanford has everything to lose and not much to win in tonights affair. The
streaking Cardinal has not been upset by a team ranked lower than it all season.
Stanford must defeat the Spartans to retain its lofty ranking and to have any hope of
avoiding a regional clash with No. 1 UCLA. San Jose State may focus on the Cardinal
tandem of Kristin Klein and Bev Oden which will leave Jessica Benton all alone.
Benton has made opponents pay for this tactic. In her last ten matches, she has hit
.396.
