# Once upon a time there was a very, very exciting Big Game

"Please clear the field. The game is not
over.
"Please clear the field. The game is not
over..."
Twenty years from now, on a cold,
rainy Saturday afternoon in
November, two of my children will
be exploring in the attic of our house.
They'll check out the old furniture, play
with some of the clothes and toys, and
eventually they'll come across a worn-out
shoebox, stuffed with pictures, newspa
per clippings. .. and one faded, crumpled
football ticket.
They'll see photos of volleyball players
and baseball stars, look at stories about
tennis championships, basketball upsets
and countless road trips. Four years of
Stanford sports highlights will be in that
box, and they'll look at everything and
wonder about all those people, playing
games so long ago.
And then they'll look at that football
ticket.
I- It'll probably be a little yellow with
age, but they'll still be able to make out
the words: "Stanford Rooter, Big Game,
November 17, 1990."
; - And they'll wonder: Why isn't there
anything else about the football team in
the shoebox? Why just a single ticket,
when everyone else got pictures and sto
ries and stuff?
So, since it'll be raining and there
won't be much else to do, they'll come
running to find me, and they'll ask:
"Daddy, why did you keep this ticket?"
And oh, will I have a story to tell them.

I'll ask them to hop up on my lap —
hopefully, they'll be at the age when
it's still cool to sit on Daddy's lap
eveiy now and then — and I'll tell them
about that weekend before Thanksgiving,
1990.
I'll tell them about the best bonfire
Stanford University had ever seen. I'll tell
them about the funniest, most beauti
fully-performed Gaieties ever. And then,
after they politely ask me to get on with
it, I'll start talking about the game,
played on another cold November day.
I'll describe the two teams: The Good
Guys, who'd had their ups and downs all
year but had won two straight; and The
Bad Guys, who had a better record, and
had beaten a few teams that crushed The
Good Guys.
"Daddy, what were their names?"
they'll ask.
Well, I'll answer, The Good Guys were
called Stanford, and The Bad Guys were
called Weenies.
"Weenies! HA-HA-HA! Weenies!!"
After they calm down, I'll get on with
the game. Chances are that I won't say
too much about the first half (nothing too
exciting happened then, anyway), because
the game really started at halftime.
I'll describe the greatest Band on
earth, and then say that the Weenies' fans
were so mean and insecure that they had
to throw oranges at the Band. I'll talk
about the idiots who tackled the Tree, and
then I'll tell them The Good Guys' fans
would never be so classless. (I'll probably
skip the part about the slingshots, fruit
and water balloons from the Stanford sec
tion, 'cuz it won't really help the story.)

I'll describe the second-half kickoff,
which Glyn Milburn took almost to mid
field. And then they'll hear about John
Hopkins' third field goal, which cut what
had been a 14-point lead down to 17-9. At
the time it didn't seem like enough,
because Stanford hadn't been able to stop
the Weenies from scoring.
At least, not before then. Stanford
didn't let The Bad Guys score the next
time, and then, halfway through the third
quarter, Glyn screamed through their
line, running all the way to the end zone
faster than I'd ever seen anyone run.
That made the score 17-15, kids, and so
Stanford tried for a two-point conversion.
"Daddy, what's a two-point conver
sion?" my daughter Glynda will ask.
I'll explain the concept, and how it
makes college football so very exciting,
and then tell them that a friend of
Daddy's tried to run the ball in but got
tackled. The score stayed the same.
"OH NO!!"
Oh no, indeed.
It's okay, I'll say, because there was a
lot of time to play. In fact, Stanford
stopped the Weenies again, marched
right down the field and, right after the
fourth quarter started, lined up to kick
another field goal. This time, it was for
the lead.
The snap was fine, the ball was kicked,
and then — (I'll pause for effect, letting
the children wait with their eyes wide) —
it was blocked!!!
"OH NO!!!!!"
Yup.
After they get over the disappoint

ment, I'll tell them how right then I
turned to the woman next to me and said
that at least that wasn't the last play of
the game.
"What do you mean, Daddy?"
Just wait, I'll reply. Things turned out
to be not so bad, because the Weenies gave
the ball right back! Wasn't that nice of
them? And, a few plays later, Hopkins
tried another field goal. . . and it was
good!! We were winning!
"YAAYYY!!!"
The kids will jump up and down, and
after they settle down I'll go on — and tell
them that the Weenies came right back,
scored a touchdown, went for two. .. and
made it. Bad Guys, 25-18. Six minutes
left.
"AAUUGGGGHHH!!"
Plenty of time, plenty of time! I'll
shush them. Stanford got the ball, ran
some plays.. .and went straight back
wards. They had to punt. The Weenies got
the ball with four minutes left, and all
they had to do was run out the clock to
win.
Just then one of the kids will ask why
I'm telling them this depressing story. I'll
tell him to be patient, and then I'll pull

out the cliche about games not being over
until they're over. "Yeah, right!" he'll say
(He'll have a lot of me in him), and then
sit back and wait.
I'll go on, saying how the Stanford
defense, one final time, shut The Bad
Guys down. They had to punt and, one
final time, Stanford had the ball. Two
minutes to go. On the 13-yard line.
I'll tell them about that final Drive:
How quarterback Jason Palumbis took
the Cardinal the length of the field, being
perfect when he had to, stopping the clock
without wasting timeouts, and, with only
12 seconds left, passing the ball to Ed
McCaffrey in the end zone. Touchdown,
Good Guys. Down by one.
"ALL RIGHT!!!"
The coach decided to go for two points
and the win, I'll say, so Palumbis rolled
out, threw to McCaffrey. . .and it was
intercepted!!
Silence. "Daddy?" my son Jason will
ask.
"Yes?"
"Don't you mean Ed caught it? Didn't
The Good Guys win?"
No, son, he didn't catch it. In fact, a lot
of Weenie fans ran on to the field, because
they thought they'd won.
"But weren't they still winning? Why
are you telling us this?!"
Well, I'll answer, the game wasn't over.
There were still those 12 seconds. And, as
we watched all those people, I turned to
the man standing next to me — I would
never see him again after the game — and
said "That's a 15-yard penalty on them.
