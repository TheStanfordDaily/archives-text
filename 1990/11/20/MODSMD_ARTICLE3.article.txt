# New meters added near Tresidder
## 
### Marie Bui Staff writer 
RÂ«y Patel and his two friends
huddled in last week's noontime
drizzle around a parking meter in
the Tresidder Union lot. While
visiting campus, they wanted to
spend a couple of hours at the
Stanford Bookstore, but found
only one quarter between them.
Raj decided to go ask for change
and come back.
"It's a hassle to get quarters,
but if there weren't metered park
ing spaces, I probably wouldn't
get one," he sighed.
Metered spaces are "the main
way to accommodate visitor park
ing," agreed Tom Auer, program
manager of the Office of Trans
portation Programs.
Out of 17,500 parking spaces
on campus, 600 are currently
metered, he estimated. By later
this week, about 80 more meters
will be installed in and around the
Tresidder lot, according to Auer
and Officer Clifton Clarke, who is
in charge of meter installation.
The meters will replace green
curbs, which permit 40 minutes of
free parking, but are "time con
suming" and difficult to enforce,
said Sgt. Philip Love from the
Department of Public Safety.
The two officers whose beat

includes Tresidder must mark
cars and return often to enforce
the time limit. People sometimes
move their cars up a space or
scrub off the marks in order to
park longer, Love said.
Judy Simpson, who works at
the Stanford Bookstore, com
mented, "We do get a lot of visi
tors, and 40 minutes is not
enough."
Other local shop owners and
employees were not sure how
much the new meters will affect
business, but Carmelo Coglian
dro, a barber at Stanford
Hairstyling in Tresidder, said his
customers often complain about
the current parking situation.
They come in late for appoint
ments because they couldn't find
a parking space, he said.
Barbara Maria, a food service
worker at Tresidder, said she pre
ferred to buy a permit rather than
pump quarters into a meter every
day.
Community feeling was taken
into account when deciding to
convert to parking meters, Love
said. People called the police with
suggestions and complaints about
parking near Tresidder.
The meters are more flexible
than the green curbs, with short
limits for quick errands and
longer ones for visits or shopping.

New meters close to Tresidder will
allow 20 minutes of free parking,
and charge 25 cents for every 10
minutes after that. One and two
hour meters, charging 50 cents
per hour, will be mounted on the
poles that line Lagunita and Santa
Theresa Streets.
The free 20 minutes is designed
for people who come to Tresidder
for a quick errand, or to "drop
something off," Love said. All the
driver has to do is turn the handle
of the meter, Auer said.
Although there is nothing to
stop people from turning the han
dle more than once, similar
meters at the Law School have
worked well, he said.
The 20-minute meters should
"ensure turnover in the visitor
spaces," Auer said. They should
also provide more space for service
vehicles, Love added.
Auer said revenue from new
meters is not meant to compen
sate for losses from "Z" permits,
which allow commuters and
employees to buy cheaper parking
permits for less centrally located
lots. But he said "the more money
we take in through parking
meters, the less we have to charge
for permits."
The added revenue will help
the Transportation Department.
