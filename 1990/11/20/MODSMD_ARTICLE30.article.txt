# The 						Big Game Shame

What exactly is it about Big
Game that brings out the stupid
in people?
A few days before the annual
renewal of the great football
rivalry, students from California
trek down to Stanford — no mat
ter where the game is being played
that particular year — and engage
in some childish vandalism.
Not surprisingly, 1990 has been
no different. As residents of Gov
ernor's Corner are no doubt
aware, the spray painters from
our neighbor to the north-east left
a number of blue and gold blots on
campus that promise to remind us
of their visit for some time to
come.
I If the stupidity ended there,
with a pair of paw prints stenciled
by a select few students, it could
be written off as the actions of the
foolish few. Alas, when it's actu
ally game time, the dunderheads
pj-ove they form a frighteningly
significant minority.
"" For it is on game day when the
California cheering section shows
its lack of football knowledge. The
object of the game is not to pelt
the opposing team's band.
Sadly, a practice that was once
reserved exclusively for the Bear
Backers was taken up Saturday by
the Stanford Supporters as well.

The shame of watching cardinal
and white clad fans not only
engaged in the fruit throwing but
actually encouraging the hurlers
was too much to take.
The moral high ground that
once belonged to Stanford fans
now seemingly is in the hands of
the precious few who, upon dis
covering that their reserved seats
were located in the general admis
sion Stanford section, agreed to
find another place to sit.
Apparently, in California's infi
nite wisdom, they sold a few thou
sand more tickets than there were
seats in Memorial Stadium. Stan
ford students who arrived an hour
or more early to stake a claim to
some quality end zone seating dis
covered, one by one, that others
had tickets bearing the bench
numbers upon which the students
sat.
Many a touchy situation arose
when the students realized they
had no place to move to and no
definitive right to remain where
they were. "I had to move four
times already," one student
remarked when a ticket holder
showed up to claim the student's
spot. Another, unable to find a
seat, stood in the aisle with hun
dreds of similar plight and said: "I
should have asked for a window
seat."
While the camaraderie that
developed between the desasien
tos was somewhat charming, it
didn't change the fact that many
who paid between $12 and $24 for
a place to sit or stand didn't have
one.
Nor did it stop some particu
larly belligerent fans from

attempting to force students to sit
"down in front." Possessing a mis
taken notion that their tickets
allowed them an unobstructed
view while seated, these "fans"
ccyoled, threatened and even jos
tled some Stanford students who
had the unmitigated gall to stand
and cheer for the Cardinal.
One hopes when the game
comes back to The Farm next year
the paint, the fruit and the dou
ble-sold seats remain in Berkeley
— where they belong.
