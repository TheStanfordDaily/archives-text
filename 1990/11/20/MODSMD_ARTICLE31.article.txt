# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
This is a period of transition. Fall sport
seasons are ending and winter sports are
beginning. And it happens that, to all intents
and purposes , only one women's sport is cur
rently competing — volleyball.
So, considering the spikers' lightweight
competition last week, we figure that, in
light of certain other Big performances by
Cardinal athletes last week, the women

could handle a short hiatus before their next
representative appears in Athletes of the
Week.
So it is that the chosen ones this week
both made Big contributions to the football
team's mind-boggling Big Win on Saturday:
Glyn Milburn and John Hopkins.
The California defense found it virtually
impossible to stop Milburn, a 5-foot-9, 175-
pound tailback from Santa Monica, Calif.
He gained 66 yards receiving, the second
highest total of the day. He rushed for 196 of
Stanford's season-best 247 yards on the
ground, and on one of his carries ran 53
yards for one of the Cardinal's two touch
downs. He also returned a kickoff 45 yards.
All told, Milburn gained 379 all-purpose
yards, setting a Pacific 10 Conference record.
At the same time, he boosted himself ahead
of Darrin Nelson to set the new school record
for single-season all-purpose yards.
Coach Denny Green gushed about his No.
1 ball carrier: "Milburn just has to be Ail-
American," he said.

Milburn may have been the impetus for
the Cardinal offense, but when it was all said
and done, it was placekicker Hopkins who
lifted the Cardinal to one of its Biggest victo
ries ever.
The 6-3, 185-pound senior from Highland
Park, Texas kicked five field goals in the
game, setting a new school record. With his
final collegiate kick — the game-winning
field goal — Hopkins edged by Mark

Harmon's school record for career points
scored.
It was actually two of his kicks in the
unforgettable final 12 seconds that gave
Stanford the victory. The first was an
onsides kickoff which Kevin Scott recovered.
Following a roughing the passer penalty,
Hopkins put the ball through the uprights
and a bullet in the hearts of the Bears.
