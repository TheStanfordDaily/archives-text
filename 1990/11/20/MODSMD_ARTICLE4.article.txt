# ROTC stresses Middle East crisis
## 
### Peter Robison Staff writer 
One of 30 American men between the ages of
18 and 24 is in uniform in the Persian Gulf,
according to 1989 U.S. Census projections. The
current crisis, however, does not directly affect
Stanford's Reserve Officer Training Corps mem
bers, and will only influence the military status of
the general student body if a draft is enacted.
According to Barbie Richardson, a spokesper
son for the Selective Service, student deferment
was abolished in 1971, meaning that college stu
dents would have the same chance of being
drafted as non-students. During the Vietnam
War, students were exempt from the draft.
However, she said, "It would take an act of
Congress, signed by the president, to begin a new
draft," because the last one expired in 1974.
"There are no plans for a draft at this time,"
Richardson emphasized. "We've had no indication
of that from Congress or the president."
But if a draft were enacted, she said, the first
step would be to hold a national lottery to deter
mine draft order. "Young men turning 20 in the
year of the lottery would be the most vulnerable"
to being chosen for service, Richardson said. The
lottery would then induct men 21-25, with 18 and
19-year-old men the least likely to be chosen.
Drafted seniors would be allowed to complete
the school year, and other students would be
allowed to complete the current semester or quar
ter.
Stanford's ROTC members said the only

change in their program has been a greater
emphasis on awareness of issues in the Middle
East.
"We're emphasizing current events for our
[quarterly] exam, including geography, an under
standing of the issues in the Middle East and the
culture of the people," according to senior Jeff
Neal, a Navy ROTC member.
Other than that, "it will only affect us when we
graduate," said senior Kyle Ford, another Navy
ROTC member. "If the crisis is still going on then,
it is probable that we will be sent there."
According to Ford, the possibility of combat is
something he had considered before he entered
the ROTC program. "We'll have to wait and see
what happens," he said, "but if the crisis contin
ues, it's my duty to serve. That's why I'm in the
ROTC — to fight for my country."
"I've made a commitment to the armed
forces," Neal said. The possibility of combat "is
something I thought about before I joined. If I
have to go, I have to go."
Tom Clyde, a senior who helped organize the
Nov. 15 anti-war rally in White Plaza, said he
believes "most students oppose a U.S. attack."
Several members of Congress, including Sen.
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., have voiced concerns
that President Bush is massing U.S. troops for an
American first strike.
According to Clyde, there was "an unbelievable
turnout" for the rally. "Most people were moti
vated by a sense of urgency," Clyde said. "People
wanted to let Washington know they are opposed
to a first strike.
