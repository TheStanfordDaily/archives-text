# Senator gets cancer therapy at Stanford
## 
### 
Senator Alan Cranston, D-
Calif., checked into Stanford Hos
pital yesterday for the first day in
a seven-week radiation therapy
for prostate cancer.
The initial examination yester
day morning lasted for an hour
and a half and went well, accord
ing to a hospital spokesperson. As
he left the hospital after the tests,
Cranston told reporters that the
cancer had been contained. "But
it's very early still, and things
could change," the spokesperson
said.
Cranston, 76, last week said
that the cancer was "totally cur
able."
The treatment will be adminis
tered by Stanford oncologist Mal
colm Bagshaw, a national leader in
the field of radiation therapy and
cancer research who chairs the
department of radiation oncology
at the Hospital. Bagshaw was a
key participant in the creation of
the Stanford medical linear accel
erator, which has advanced
research in the area of radiation
treatment.
The radiation oncology depart
ment at Stanford is one of the

leading of its kind in the country,
according to a hospital spokesper
son. Cranston will also be receiv
ing medical attention at Johns
Hopkins University.
The senator, in the midst of
ethics hearings with four other
senators for his role in preventing
federal regulators from closing a
failing savings and loan institu
tion, announced two weeks ago
that he would not run for another
term because of his failing health.
Former gubernatorial candi
date Dianne Feinstein has been
mentioned as one person who
could run for his seat in 1992 or
the seat being vacated by Gover
nor-elect Pete Wilson.
Cranston missed the first
meeting of the Senate Ethics
Committee last week, at which
Cranston and Senator Dennis
DeConcini were called "by far the
most active" in persuading regula
tors to keep open Arizona
financier Charles Keating Jr.'s
savings and loan.
During his treatment,
Cranston will be staying with his
sister, Eleanor Cranston Cam
eron, who lives in Los Altos Hills.
