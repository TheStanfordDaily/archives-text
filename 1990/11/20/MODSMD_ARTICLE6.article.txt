## Sister Ncube discusses challenges facing women 
### Melissa Hollatz 
"I was challenged by the issues
of day-to-day living," Sister
Bernard Ncube, president of the
South African Federation of
Women, told an audience at Bran
ner Hall last night. "Those chal
lenges were so spontaneous that I
became part and parcel" of them,
she said.
Ncube spoke about women's
participation in the fight against
"the carnage and violence" that
characterizes her country.
According to Ncube, the
women's struggle is for basic sur
vival. "Women are not taking up
the struggle because it's their
option, but because it's their duty
and their right," she said.
"Women in the '80s have
mushroomed in every area to
organize themselves," according
to Ncube.
"The labor movement we orga
nized, the children's movement
we organized," she said. "Even at
the level of the churches, we
reached out to build bridges to
bring people together."
Ncube also discussed the issue
of homelands, provinces created
by the government as segregated

residential areas for blacks. She
called it a government attempt to
"divide and rule."
Ncube said South African
blacks oppose this policy, which is
the root of their battle. "The
struggle is not about apartheid. ..
.The struggle is about the chang
ing of group areas," she empha
sized. "The essence of freedom is
the restoration of the land to the
people."
She also called Chief Gatsha
Buthelezi, the leader of Inkatha
we Sizwe, a predominantly Zulu
organization, a puppet ruler
installed by the white govern
ment. "It is a strategy of the gov
ernment to destabilize and create
division between the blacks," she
said.
Despite the common percep
tion that the South African crisis
is nearing solution, Ncube said
her country's woes are far from
cured.
"Negotiation is a long, long
road that we have not gotten to,"
she said. "The new road is bloody,
is far, and is not achieved yet by
our people."
Ncube's presentation is part of
a 15-city tour sponsored by Global
Exchange.
