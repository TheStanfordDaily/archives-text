# Non-voting senators' role being reassessed
## 
### David Bianco Editorial staff 
Alison Alter is tired of sitting
on her hands.
As one of the ASSU's 20 non
voting senators, Alter can serve
and vote in senate committees,
participate in floor debate and
even submit bills.
But when the senate votes, she
has to sit back and watch her fel
low senators make decisions on
issues she feels she was elected to
work on.
Because of her frustration,
Alter, a sophomore, is looking into
two solutions: "straw polls" and a
change in the ASSU Constitution.
Alter began last Thursday to
request straw polls, or nonbinding
surveys, of all ASSU leaders
attending senate meetings. She
also hopes to amend the constitu
tion to allow votes for all 40 sena
tors.
"I feel that the structure of the
ASSU as it stands ... is self
defeating," Alter said. "It encour
ages people to miss (senate meet
ings) because there's someone
there to take their (places). And it
reduces the incentive for non-vot
ing senators" to actively partici

pate in the meetings.
When voting senators are
absent or leave meetings early,
non-voting senators are allowed to
vote in the order of the number of
votes they received in last spring's
elections.
At Thursday's senate meeting,
Alter requested a straw poll of all
senators, senate associates and
Council of Presidents members on
a bill passed by the voting sena
tors opposing an unprovoked U.S.
offensive in the Persian Gulf. The
poll showed that a majority of that
larger group opposed the bill.
"Thursday night was probably
the most frustrated that I felt,"
said sophomore Holly Haskew,
another non-voting senator. She
said students later approached
her to complain about the bill.
Haskew, who shared their senti
ments, could only respond by say
ing she could not vote.
The straw poll was taken after
the question was called, which
means voting senators were
unaware of the entire body's gen
eral opposition to the bill when
they voted. Haskew and Alter
both said they would like to see
more straw polls taken before an
official vote is taken.
Senate Chair Solina Kwan, a
junior, said she would encourage
more senators to move for straw
polls at future meetings.
But Mae Lee, a voting senator,
said she was unsure whether a
change was needed to incorporate
more straw polls. "I'd like to hear
some more debate about that,"
said Lee, a junior.
Lee also questioned the need
for official votes by all senators.
"Because the non-voting senators
have the ability to raise issues in
discussions and introduce bills,
the fact that there are 20 (voting)
senators is adequate for the stu
dent body."
"The fact that they can't vote
might be something that could be
looKed into," Lee added.
Alter said she plans to propose
an amendment to the ASSU Con
stitution that would go on the
spring ballot to allow all senators
to vote. "Forty people represent
12,000 a lot better than 20," she
said.
Alter, who is the 20th under
graduate senator in the ranking
based on number of votes received
in last spring's election, has never
voted in a senate meeting.
