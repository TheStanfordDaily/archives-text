# Universities as educators or enforcers in drug war?
## 
### Holly Hacker Staff writer 
The federal government has called
colleges and universities to the front line
in the war on drugs, but Stanford has
proven reluctant to take up arms when
it involves changing the University's
alcohol policy.
It comes as no surprise, therefore,
that a conflict has evolved between two
different philosophies: that of federal
government officials who want colleges
to take a more active role in upholding
alcohol and drug laws and that of Stan
ford administrators who maintain that a
university should educate and not
enforce.
"Higher education seems to be ignor
ing their role in the drug war," said
Ronald Bucknam, the director for Drug
Prevention Programs in Higher Educa
tion, a government agency. Bucknam

reflects the attitude of many in Washing
ton who believe that universities must
take greater enforcement measures to
flght alcohol and drug abuse.
The recently amended Drug-Free
Schools and Communities Act is one
attempt at forcing colleges and universi
ties to take a harder line against illicit
alcohol and drug use on campus.
Colleges 'diffident' about drug use
The original act — one element of
Congress' response to former President
Ronald Reagan's call for a "drug-free"
America — authorized $150 million per
year for four years to states, local gov
ernments and public schools to develop
substance abuse education and preven
tion programs.
David Robb, an aide in the Office of
National Drug Control Policy, said that
while elementary and secondary schools
have done their duty in helping fight the

war on drugs, "too many colleges and
universities have remained diffident
when it comes to drugs. Most have been
paying lip service."
Last year, Rep. Augustus Hawkins,
D-Calif., sponsored amendments to the
1986 act. The Office of National Drug
Control Policy, headed by William Ben
nett, lobbied for and authored the part
of the bill that required colleges to
expressly prohibit unlawful alcohol and
drug use on campuses in order to main
tain eligibility for federal grants, loans,
financial aid and other funding.
Bennett first outlined his plans to
fight substance abuse among youth in a
pamphlet he wrote as Secretary of Edu
cation in 1987, "Schools Without
Drugs."
Bennett encouraged schools to take a
hard line to "establish clear &nd specific
rules regarding drug use that include
strong corrective actions."

The amendments to the Drug-Free
Schools and Communities Act passed
late last year. As a result, Stanford had
to revise its old alcohol policy, which did
not expressly outlaw underage drinking
or forbid drug use, but rather left stu
dents responsible for making their own
decisions and dealing with any related
consequences.
And while Stanford has complied
with the federal regulations, administra
tors have done so reluctantlv. Many said
they want to maintain Stanford's role as
primarily a teaching institution and
leave law enforcement up to the police.
Educating versus enforcing
Acting Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Diana Conklin said universities are
"best suited to education and not law
enforcement or rule enforcement."
"I think it's important for educa
tional institutions to keep in mind how

people learn when making decisions
about student conduct in and out of the
classroom," she added.
Conklin said she believes students
will learn about and make wise choices
regarding substance abuse if given the
opportunity to think and decide for
themselves, without universities or leg
islators imposing strict rules and regula
tions.
"In my experience of 18 years in
higher education," Conklin noted, "I
have seen that people learn best in an
environment that respects intelligence
and gives opportunities for educated and
thoughtful decision-making."
Robb, speaking on behalf of members
of his office, disagrees. "We don't buy
the idea that purely educating someone
can inoculate them against drug use," he
said.
