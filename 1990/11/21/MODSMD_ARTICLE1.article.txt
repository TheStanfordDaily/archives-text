# Universities as educators or enforcers in drug war?
## 
### Holly Hacker Staff writer 
The federal government has called
colleges and universities to the front line
in the war on drugs, but Stanford has
proven reluctant to take up arms when
it involves changing the University's
alcohol policy.
It comes as no surprise, therefore,
that a conflict has evolved between two
different philosophies: that of federal
government officials who want colleges
to take a more active role in upholding
alcohol and drug laws and that of Stan
ford administrators who maintain that a
university should educate and not
enforce.
"Higher education seems to be ignor
ing their role in the drug war," said
Ronald Bucknam, the director for Drug
Prevention Programs in Higher Educa
tion, a government agency. Bucknam

reflects the attitude of many in Washing
ton who believe that universities must
take greater enforcement measures to
flght alcohol and drug abuse.
The recently amended Drug-Free
Schools and Communities Act is one
attempt at forcing colleges and universi
ties to take a harder line against illicit
alcohol and drug use on campus.
Colleges 'diffident' about drug use
The original act — one element of
Congress' response to former President
Ronald Reagan's call for a "drug-free"
America — authorized $150 million per
year for four years to states, local gov
ernments and public schools to develop
substance abuse education and preven
tion programs.
David Robb, an aide in the Office of
National Drug Control Policy, said that
while elementary and secondary schools
have done their duty in helping fight the

war on drugs, "too many colleges and
universities have remained diffident
when it comes to drugs. Most have been
paying lip service."
Last year, Rep. Augustus Hawkins,
D-Calif., sponsored amendments to the
1986 act. The Office of National Drug
Control Policy, headed by William Ben
nett, lobbied for and authored the part
of the bill that required colleges to
expressly prohibit unlawful alcohol and
drug use on campuses in order to main
tain eligibility for federal grants, loans,
financial aid and other funding.
Bennett first outlined his plans to
fight substance abuse among youth in a
pamphlet he wrote as Secretary of Edu
cation in 1987, "Schools Without
Drugs."
Bennett encouraged schools to take a
hard line to "establish clear &nd specific
rules regarding drug use that include
strong corrective actions."

The amendments to the Drug-Free
Schools and Communities Act passed
late last year. As a result, Stanford had
to revise its old alcohol policy, which did
not expressly outlaw underage drinking
or forbid drug use, but rather left stu
dents responsible for making their own
decisions and dealing with any related
consequences.
And while Stanford has complied
with the federal regulations, administra
tors have done so reluctantlv. Many said
they want to maintain Stanford's role as
primarily a teaching institution and
leave law enforcement up to the police.
Educating versus enforcing
Acting Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Diana Conklin said universities are
"best suited to education and not law
enforcement or rule enforcement."
"I think it's important for educa
tional institutions to keep in mind how

people learn when making decisions
about student conduct in and out of the
classroom," she added.
Conklin said she believes students
will learn about and make wise choices
regarding substance abuse if given the
opportunity to think and decide for
themselves, without universities or leg
islators imposing strict rules and regula
tions.
"In my experience of 18 years in
higher education," Conklin noted, "I
have seen that people learn best in an
environment that respects intelligence
and gives opportunities for educated and
thoughtful decision-making."
Robb, speaking on behalf of members
of his office, disagrees. "We don't buy
the idea that purely educating someone
can inoculate them against drug use," he
said.
He added that "individual
responsibility does not leave open
the option of breaking the law.
People who break the law should
face the music."
"I'm much more for voluntary
education than involuntary
enforcement," argued Louise
Miller, health promotion specialist
in alcohol and other drug abuse
prevention at Cowell Student
Health Center.
Miller added that she has
mixed feelings about the federal
legislation and subsequent change
in Stanford's alcohol policy.
On the one hand, Miller said
the legislation can only heighten
awareness on the dangers and
effects of substance abuse, some
thing that "was starting to hap
pen" before Congress passed anti
drug legislation.
However, Miller said she fears
the policy could create a "back
lash" against groups such as Pro
ject R 2 ISC — Risk Reduction of
Intoxicants in the Stanford Com
munity — which she heads. She
said R 2 ISC has helped students
become aware of and comfortable
with lower-risk drinking prac
tices.
She said instead of letting peo
ple realize the dangers of sub
stance abuse on their own, the
federal legislation may force them
into obeying the law only for fear
of breaking it.
"I would prefer to have people
come around to this through their
own time," Miller said.
More 'rules' people
Robb, however, recommended

what he called a "tough-love
approach" to alcohol and other
drug abuse, advocating stricter
penalties and greater family
involvement for college students
caught using alcohol or drugs.
He suggested administrators
should write, phone, or meet with
the students' parents after the
first offense, contacting the par
ents again and referring the stu
dent to a counselor after the sec
ond, and expelling the student
after the third. '
Bucknam said resident assis
tants as well as administrators
should crack down on unlawful
alcohol and other drug use, fault
ing universities such as Stanford
for hiring RAs to serve mainly as
educators and counselors, but not
as disciplinarians.
"Some colleges recruit more
'human' people than 'rules' peo
ple," he said. "I like rules."
With widespread concern about
alcohol and other drug use on col
leges campuses, Bucknam said,
"the RA role is having to get back
to dealing with the school's
responsibilities" in rule and law
enforcement.
Bucknam said for one RA to
serve as both an educator and an
enforcer "is psychologically and
physically impossible." He sug
gested that colleges "recruit half
the RAs to be there to make sure
the rules are fo"owed, the other
half as counselors."
"Recruit people who like
rules," Bucknam advised. He said
too many colleges have hired only
"people who don't like that role"
of enforcer.
Stanford unwilling to change
However, Stanford has no
intention of changing the role of
its RAs to that of police officer,

administrators said.
"The residential staff has been
able to relate to students in such a
way as to tap into other aspects of
their lives that are important,
contributing to growth, maturity
and development," said Ann Por
teus, assistant director of the
Office of Residential Education.
Bucknam contends that
enforcement of alcohol regula
tions is particularly important
because the increase in alcohol
use among college students "is
significant."
He cited a 1989 Department of
Health and Human Services sur
vey on drinking, drug use and
smoking among young adults. It
found that college-bound high
school seniors have lower rates of
alcohol use during high school
than those seniors who don't go to
college.
Yet the mean for those same
students once they are in college
is higher than the mean for those
who did not attend college.
"The environment in colleges
promotes use, and use is
expected," Bucknam explained.
"There are very few social activi
ties that don't require the use of
alcohol to feel comfortable," he
added. "It's not all right when you
go to college to refuse a beer."
However, at Stanford, where
administrators emphasize indi
vidual responsibility over rule
enforcement, the rates of alcohol
and other drug use appear lower
than the national average among
college students.
The Department of Health and
Human Services reported in its
survey that in 1988, 77 percent of
college undergraduates had used
alcohol within the last 30 days.
According to a 1990 survey of

Stanford undergraduates con
ducted by Cowell, that figure was
only 64 percent.
The national survey also
reported that in 1986, 22 percent
of college undergraduates had
tried marijuana within the last 30
days, and 7 percent had tried
cocaine. A 1986 survey of Stan
ford undergraduates shows that
11 percent of students had tried
marijuana and 2 percent had used
cocaine within the same period.
Conklin said, "Based on con
versations with colleagues at
other universities, we have a
much smaller problem with alco
hol abuse than other places. Cer
tainly we have problems, but I
don't think they're as bad as at
other schools."
An 'empty gesture'
Ironically, while the federal leg
islation forced Stanford to change
its alcohol policy, it seems to have
been aimed more at hard drugs,
such as cocaine.
"The focus of these efforts [by
the federal government] was not
intended to be alcohol. The origi
nal intent was to get at the alleged
cocaine epidemic," according to a
staff member of the Education
and Labor Committee.
In addition, some members of
Congress may have voted for the
Anti-Drug Abuse Act and similar
pieces of legislation to make a
symbolic statement against drug
abuse.
Many in Congress saw the ini
tial anti-drug legislation as an
"empty gesture," said Connie
Monahan, a legislative correspon
dent for Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-
N.M. "But as time goes on, it's
becoming more heartfelt," she
added.

Opposition to the general legis
lation was virtually non-existent,
Monahan said. "You wouldn't
look very popular if you opposed
it," she said, because "you'd be
seen as supposedly supporting
drug use."
The amendments that have
caused a change in Stanford's
alcohol policy have administrators
wondering how far the national
government will go in telling uni
versities what to do. "To what
extent should the federal govern

ment drive the formulation of
educational policy?" Conklin
asked.
The federal government may
go even further, according to some
Washington officials. The 1989
amendments are "expected to get
the attention" of colleges and uni
versities, according to Bucknam.
And if they don't? Bucknam
said Congress "will have to turn
the screws up a couple of notches"
on higher education.
