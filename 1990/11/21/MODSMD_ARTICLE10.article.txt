Court orders INS to
inform detainees of rights
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Despite six
years of court orders, immigration officers
have continued to pressure detained Salvado
rans into leaving the United States, and must
tell the detainees of their right to seek politi
cal asylum, a federal appeals court ruled yes
terday.
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
upheld a nationwide order by a federal judge in
Los Angeles requiring the Immigration and
Naturalization Service to advise detainees
from El Salvador of their right to call a lawyer
and fight deportation.
Although a similar order was in effect from
1982 to 1988, INS agents often ignored it or
evaded it by telling Salvadorans that if they
applied for asylum, they would be jailed for a
long time. The agents also did not let Salvado
rans consult with lawyers before signing agree
ments to leave the country and restricted or
banned writing materials at some detention
facilities, the court said.
The INS* "past and present misconduct
indicates a strong likelihood of future viola
tions," justifying a permanent injunction, said
Judge Mary Schroeder in the 3-0 appellate
decision.
Group sues to keep Bush
from unilateral strike
WASHINGTON (AP) - A group of 45
House Democrats asked a federal judge yester
day to block any order from President Bush for
a U.S. attack on Iraqi forces unless he first
obtained permission from Congress.
The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court,
also seeks a declaratory judgment that Bush is
required by the war powers clause of the Con
stitution "to seek a declaration of war or other
explicit authorization of Congress" before
launching an attack.
"If the president takes it upon himself — as
he may at any moment — to initiate such a war
without the unequivocal consent of Congress,
the victim of Iraqi aggression will be, not just
Kuwait, but the Constitution of the United
States," the lawmakers said in court papers.
Rep. Ronald Dellums, D-Calif., who orga
nized the filing of the lawsuit, said the court
action is intended to force Bush to give law
makers a chance to debate the wisdom of wag
ing war on Iraq.
Lawyers for the Center for Constitutional
Rights, which represents the lawmakers,
asked U.S. District Judge Harold Greene, a lib
eral appointee of President Carter, to hold a
hearing in 10 days.
