# Soviets reluctant to back U.N. offensive

PARIS (AP) â€” The Soviet Union said
yesterday the U.N. Security Council should
"take stock" of its sanctions against Iraq
and decide whether a new course of action
is necessary. But the Soviets again rebuffed
President Bush's efforts to rally support for
a resolution authorizing military force.
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard She
vardnadze, emerging from a 90-minute
meeting with Secretary of State James
Baker, told reporters, "We need to consult
with our colleagues and partners in the
Security Council."
But he stopped considerably short of
backing any measure that would advocate
the use of force.
Shevardnaze said the council should
"take stock of things and pass appropriate
judgment on what it has been doing."
Then, if necessary, he said, the body
should "adopt new resolutions with a view
to implementing all the previous deci
sions."
The Persian Gulf crisis dominated the
unofficial agenda at the 34-nation Confer
ence on Cooperation and Security in
Europe, although French President
Francis Mitterrand's spokesman said the
conference would not issue any statements
on the crisis.
"There will be no common declaration
by the 34 on the Gulf," Hubert Vedrine said
after a 45-minute private meeting of the
leaders.

Discussion in the closed session focused
on such matters as immigration from one
European country to the next and the con
tinent's environment.
Baker had been pressing a last ditch
effort to strike a deal before Bush's trip to
Saudi Arabia today. However, the Soviet
leader's statement indicated that the two
sides were still far apart.
Even so, Baker said: "The United States
and the Soviet Union have been united in
their approach to this problem" since Iraq's
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. "We are united
today. We intend to remain united," he
added.
As the Paris summit wound down its sec
ond day, both U.S. and Soviet officials
unveiled plans for a superpower summit in
Moscow early next year to sign a treaty on
reducing long-range nuclear weapons.
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwa
ter said there was no firm date for the sum
mit, although he said both countries were
shooting for January. Fitzwater said having
a nuclear arms treaty to sign was a prereq
uisite for the summit, but holding the ses
sion in January "is what we have been talk
ing about and shooting for."
Even before the end of the Baker and
Shevardnadze meeting, Fitzwater said it
seemed "very unlikely" that support could
be rallied for a resolution to step up pres
sure before the president's trip to the Mid
dle East.
