### 
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) — Lawmak
ers agreed yesterday to free all Ger
mans remaining in Iraq and Kuwait as
a gesture that President Saddam Hus
sein said should encourage dialogue
and avert war in the Persian Gulf.
The National Assembly voted to
approve Saddam's recommendation
that the Germans be allowed to leave
in response to recent statements by
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
stressing the need for a peaceful reso
lution of the crisis.
German government spokesman
Hans Klein, in Paris, said his nation
did not conduct any "special negotia
tions with Iraq — open or covert."
Earlier this week Iraq said all for
eigners would be set free between Dec.
25 and March 25, but Information
Minister Latif Nassiyif Jassim indi
cated Monday that some might be
allowed to leave earlier.
A Dutch company reported yester

day that 122 Dutch, Belgian and
British nationals who had just com
pleted a dredging project for the Iraqi
government would soon leave.
And the government indicated it
would free an unspecified number of
other Europeans in response to visits
by a Swiss delegation and a group of
European parliament members
headed by Jean-Marie Le Pen of
France.
The Western allies have accused
Saddam of trying to use the hostage
issue to try to split the alliance assem
bled against him after the Aug. 2 occu
pation of Kuwait.
Parliament speaker Saadi Mahdi
Saleh said there were 124 Germans
remaining in Iraq and Kuwait. No spe
cific arrangements were made for their
departure.
Only one of the National Assembly
members, Jamil Sheik Issa, voted
against the measure yesterday. He

declined to give a reason to reporters.
At least 10 of the "guests," as Iraq
calls foreigners held since the invasion
of Kuwait, spoke during the 90-minute
debate. They endorsed the president's
recommendation, citing the German
government's recent statements con
cerning the gulf crisis.
They said the release of the Ger
mans would encourage European
countries and the United States to
show willingness to avert war and
become involved in negotiations.
In Paris, German Foreign Minister
Hans Dietrich Genscher said: "I
believe we should appreciate above all
that the hostages are to be freed."
Wolfgang Boetsch, another German
politician, said the release would not
separate Germany from the interna
tional alliance opposed to Iraqi annex
ation of Kuwait. And Hans-Jochen
Vogel, chairman of a German opposi
tion party, said freeing the Germans

was a step toward resolving the con
flict without military intervention.
White House spokesman Marlon
Fitzwater, in Paris with President
Bush, said Baghdad's move was
another effort to chisel away interna
tional solidarity against Iraq.
The official Iraqi News Agency
quoted Saddam as saying Iraq should
"encourage Mr. Kohl and the people of
Germany for taking further stances
that distinguish between the interests
of Germany and the interests of the
callers of war and hegemony."
The president also noted that Ger
man experts have contributed to many
development projects in Iraq.
Baghdad radio quoted Saddam as
saying "the Arabs have always main
tained good relations with the German
people and never in the past did the
Germans do anything against the
Arabs."
