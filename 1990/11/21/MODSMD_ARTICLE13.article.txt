# Heseltine forces Thatcher into rematch
## British prime minister falls two votes short of defeating opponent 
### 
LONDON (AP) - The Conser
vative Party yesterday staggered
Prime Minister Margaret Thatch
er with faint support, forcing her
into a second round of balloting in
a fight for leadership of party and
country.
Thatcher, fell two votes short

of defeating the sternest challenge
of her 11-1/2 years as party leader,
but she rejected calls by some to
step down and vowed to battle on
in a second round of voting next
Tuesday. â€¢
Former Defense Secretary
Michael Heseltine, smiling and

looking very much like the winner
after the Conservative vote, also
declared himself ready for round
two.
"It is my intention to let my
name go forward for the second
ballot," a calm and determined
Thatcher told reporters outside

the British Embassy in Paris,
where she was attending a sum
mit on European security.
If Thatcher loses the leader
ship of the party, she would step
down as prime minister. The Con
servatives have a majority in the
650-seat House of Commons.
The opposition Labor Party
moved to capitalize on the turmoil
in Conservative ranks by tabling a
motion of no confidence in the
government. That motion, likely
to come to a vote before Tuesday,
would bring down the government
if it carries.
Thatcher, the longest-serving
prime minister in Europe, has
grown increasingly unpopular be
cause of a local services tax that is
widely viewed as unfairly favoring
the rich. Her government also has
been blamed for high inflation and
high interest rates, and the Con
servatives have trailed Labor in
opinion polls for 16 months.
Heseltine also focused his cam
paign on Thatcher's attitude to
ward Europe, which has caused
strains within her party.
Heseltine forced the issue by
winning barely enough votes to
deny Thatcher a first-ballot victo
ry in an unprecedented ballot
among the 372 Conservative
members of the House of Com
mons.
Because 16 lawmakers ab
stained, Thatcher needed 206
votes, or 15 percent, but received
204. Heseltine received 152.
In the second round, a simple
mfyority can win, but other candi
dates are now free to join the race.
If necessary, a third and final bal
lot would be held Nov. 29.
