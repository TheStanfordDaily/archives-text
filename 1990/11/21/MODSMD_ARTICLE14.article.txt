### 
NEW YORK (AP) — An engineer serving
on an Environmental Protection Agency panel
on smoking said yesterday he is near agree
ment with the Philip Morris tobacco company
on a $1 million research grant.
James Woods Jr., of the Virginia Polytech
nic Institute and State University in Blacks
burg, Va., is a member of an EPA panel review
ing an agency report that concludes that sec
ond-hand cigarette smoke causes lung cancer.
The panel will meet in Washington, D.C., in
December to consider the merits of the report.
Woods, a mechanical engineer, said negotia
tions on the grant began six or eight months
ago and that he submitted a proposal for the
money about one month ago. He earlier had

said Philip Morris had offered him the $1 mil
lion a month ago.
Steven Parrish, a Philip Morris spokesman,
said no offer had been made. Told of Parrish's
comment, Woods then said he was wrong
about the offer.
The grant provides for construction of an
office-like test chamber to investigate ventila
tion effectiveness, Woods said.
Woods said he expects to reach final agree
ment with Philip Morris on the grant in about
two months.
Robert Flaak, an administrator with EPA's
scientific advisory board, said the grant would
not conflict with Woods" advisory role at the
EPA.

"As long as it's in public knowledge, it does
not constitute a conflict of interest," Flaak
said. The existence of the grant has not been
officially disclosed. Flaak said it will be dis
closed at the EPA panel's December meeting.
An anti-smoking group was sharply critical
of the arrangement.
"It means that while he's sitting on the sci
entific advisory board reviewing what the EPA
has come up with, he's got this carrot dangling
in front of him which could affect his judg
ment," said Julia Carol, associate director of
Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights, based in
Berkeley, Calif.
Woods said his university is now consider
ing whether to accept the grant.
