# Space shuttle lands smoothly in Florida

### 
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.
(AP) — Atlantis and its five as
tronauts safely returned home
from a secret military mission
yesterday, gliding smoothly to
the first space shuttle landing
in Florida in five years.
The shuttle, diverted from
the California desert because of
high winds and damp runways,
swooped through a clear, bril
liant blue sky and touched
down at Kennedy Space Center
at 4:43 p.m. Its arrival was her
alded by the customary twin
sonic booms.
"Welcome home. It sure was
a beautiful sight," Mission
Control told the crew.
It was Kennedy's sixth shut
tle landing; the last one was in
1985, when Discovery blew a
tire.
Workers had to scramble to
prepare for the landing, assem
bling a convoy of support vehi
cles and bringing in extra per
sonnel. Atlantis had begun its
mission Thursday with an un
usual nighttime liftoff.
Atlantis' commander Rich
ard Covey and pilot Frank Cul
bertson Jr. emerged with the
rest of the crew from the shut
tle less than an hour after
landing. The men, wearing
striped, brightly colored jer
seys, were greeted by a half
dozen NASA officials, includ
ing Kennedy Space Center di
rector Forrest McCartney and
launch director Bob Sieck.
"Golly, I didn't expect to see
you when we landed," McCart
ney said Covey told him.
About 250 people, including
two busloads of workers from
the launch control center,
watched the landing from
bleachers and a grassy strip ad
joining the paved runway. They
whistled and cheered, waving
small American flags.
"It's very special, just like
the launch," Sieck said. "You
have to remember that half the
workforce (at Kennedy) has
never seen a shuttle landing."
"They worked so hard to get
it off, it's only fair that they
should see it land," said NASA
safety official A 1 Parrish.
William Lenoir, head of
NASA's space flight program.

said a quick check of the shut
tle showed it to be "very clean"
with dings on only a few of the
heat-resistant tiles.
Atlantis was supposed to
land Monday at Edwards Air
Force Base, Calif., but high
wind forced Mission Control to
call off the plan and extend the
shuttle's flight. Flight director
Randy Stone said Atlantis had
enough power and supplies to
stay aloft until Thursday, al
though it's doubtful NASA
would wait until then to bring
the shuttle home.
A quarter-inch of rain fell on
the Mojave Desert lakebed late
Monday and early yesterday,
creating pools of water on the
natural surface runways and
making them unsuitable for
landing. The concrete runway
would have been the only op
tion there yesterday and proba
bly today.
The outlook for today at Ed
wards was no better, prompt
ing NASA to opt for Kennedy.
The sky over Kennedy was
clear yesterday, and wind speed
was well within landing limits.
Kennedy's 2.8-mile-long
paved runway, which has
1,000-feet overruns on both
ends and is 300 feet wide, pro
vides less room for maneuver
ing than the wide-open desert.
Discovery, the last shuttle to
land at Kennedy, blew a tire
and sustained brake damage
during a 1985 landing.
Atlantis had been orbiting
amid a Pentagon-imposed si
lence since Thursday. Sources
said the astronauts deployed a
satellite Friday to spy on Iraq
by either photographic surveil
lance or electronic eavesdrop
ping.
The mission was the sev
enth and last secret shuttle
flight for the Defense Depart
ment. Two more Pentagon mis
sions are planned for the shut
tle, but the cargoes are unclas
sified.
Atlantis was supposed to lift
off in July with the spy satel
lite, but was grounded by hy
drogen leaks. The spacecraft
reportedly was modified to ob
serve the Persian Gulf while
the shuttle was being fixed.
