## Florence fiasco 
### 
The recent threats of
violence against American
university campuses in Italy
raise two disturbing problems for
the American public. The first is
the obvious potential for physical
harm that may come to U.S. citi
zens who have nothing to do with
the U.S. deployment in the Persian
Gulf.
The second problem is the atten
tion the American and internation
al media gave to the threats. The
people who wrote the notes intend
ed to frighten American students,
and nothing could have aided their
goal more than publicity that helps
them reach a larger audience.
The media played right into the
hands of the perpetrators, raising
the possibility that other pro-Iraqi
groups will follow this example and
attempt to write threatening notes
as scare tactics.
The inaccuracy of the media has

also been problematic, as the
Italian newspapers and the
Associated Press reported that
Stanford was one of the universi
ties that received a threat.
Syracuse University seems to be
taking the most rational course of
the universities that received
threats. Only three years after 35
of its students were killed in the
bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over
Lockerbie, Scotland, Syracuse
refuses to give in to anonymous
threats, dismissing them as the
work of harmless trouble-makers.
Stanford so far has also taken
the proper route, increasing securi
ty at the overseas centers around
the world, informing students and
parents of the threats and offering
tuition refunds to students who are
frightened and want to return
home. The University must not
overreact to the threats by closing
the Florence center and bringing
the students back to Stanford.
