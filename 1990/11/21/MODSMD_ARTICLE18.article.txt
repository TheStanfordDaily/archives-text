# Shop for safe sex
## 
### 
SEX MAY BE A fact of life, but
safe sex is life. With AIDS and
other sexually transmitted
diseases so rampant in our age
group among both heterosexual
and homosexual communities, peo
ple may be hesitant to pursue a
perfectly normal human activity.
Therefore, we give the Project
Student AIDS Volunteer Educators
a hearty "thank you" for their
efforts to reopen the Ye Olde Safer
Sex Shoppe.
The shop, located at the
Firetruck House, is a more conve
nient and comfortable setting for
students than Cowell Student
Health Center. The student-run
shop offers an assortment of con
doms and contraceptive devices for
the community, protecting stu
dents from threatening diseases
and unwanted pregnancies.

It is our hope that the shop con
tinues its educational mission of
raising AIDS awareness, perhaps
launching more outreach programs
for students who are too shy to
visit the shop.
The tradition of "rubberware"
parties that Daniel Bao instituted
before his graduation should defi
nitely live on. Bao, founder of the
shop and former treasurer of the
Gay and Lesbian Alliance at
Stanford, combined serious discus
sions and free condom giveaways at
these parties. In our opinion, the
more these events occur, the better
off students are.
Students should really take
advantage of the shop as a supply
source and an educational
resource. And, well ... have fun
with it.
