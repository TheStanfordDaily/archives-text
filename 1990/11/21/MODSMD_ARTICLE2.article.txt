# 'Fire Within':
## Looking for new identity 
### Eleni Kirkas Staff writer 
The Fire Within, an annual cel
ebration of multiculturalism
through song, dance and drama,
has been at the center of a compli
cated debate this year about its
proper function on campus.
Many have questioned if and
how the program should change,
which student groups should be
included and even whether to pro
duce the show at all.
The program is currently
scheduled for the beginning of
winter quarter, a departure from
the past two years in which it has
been held during Freshman Ori

according to Keith Archuleta,

a need for more education at Stan
ford about people of color, he said.
The Fire Within seemed a good
way to make aspects of these cul

ford community, as well as deal
with issues of racism, Archuleta
added.
The purpose was "to share the
cultures and traditions of those
four groups with everyone on
campus," he said.
However, in the spirit of the
new, more expansive definition of
multiculturalism, some students
have questioned whether this pro

multicultural message and
whether other groups should be
included in the production.
