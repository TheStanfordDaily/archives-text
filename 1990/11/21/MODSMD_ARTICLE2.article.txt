# 'Fire Within':
## Looking for new identity 
### Eleni Kirkas Staff writer 
The Fire Within, an annual cel
ebration of multiculturalism
through song, dance and drama,
has been at the center of a compli
cated debate this year about its
proper function on campus.
Many have questioned if and
how the program should change,
which student groups should be
included and even whether to pro
duce the show at all.
The program is currently
scheduled for the beginning of
winter quarter, a departure from
the past two years in which it has
been held during Freshman Ori
entation. The Fire Within is pre
sented by members of the Asian-
American, black, Chicano/Latino
and Native American communi
ties at Stanford. In addition, the
Council of Presidents helps coor
dinate this activity.
At issue, said COP member
Goodwin Liu, was the need to
"define clearly what it is we're try
ing to achieve."
At the beginning of fall quarter,
organizers were trying to gauge
the extent of student interest in
the program in order to decide if
the show would go on, according
to COP member Jay Tucker.
In the past few weeks, however,
organizers decided that they
would continue planning to hold
the program with the four original
communities participating.
The Fire Within was conceived
three years ago, in the wake of the
You Can Make A Difference Con
ference on institutional racism,
according to Keith Archuleta,
director of the Black Community
Services Center and one of the
producers of the original program.
Some members of campus stu
dent of color groups felt there was
a need for more education at Stan
ford about people of color, he said.
The Fire Within seemed a good
way to make aspects of these cul
tures more accessible to the Stan
ford community, as well as deal
with issues of racism, Archuleta
added.
The purpose was "to share the
cultures and traditions of those
four groups with everyone on
campus," he said.
However, in the spirit of the
new, more expansive definition of
multiculturalism, some students
have questioned whether this pro
gram is the best way to deliver a
multicultural message and
whether other groups should be
included in the production.
Members of the Jewish com
munity in particular have
expressed an interest in being
involved with this year's produc
tion of The Fire Within, although
other program organizers said
they have not been contacted by
Jewish groups about this issue.
t Alison Alter, one Jewish stu
dent leader, said if the program is
as representing multi
culturalism, then it is incomplete.
But if its purpose is "clearly
defined and presented to the audi
ence, it's a different issue."
Other important considera
' tions, Alter said,' are the pro
gram's high profile and the large
' number of students who attend
* each year. The Fire Within
preaches a broad audience, she
* added, and"the communities that
' are traditionally part of it need to
hear what we have to say just as
much as the rest of campus."
~ Fire Within organizers insist
they do not mean to present the
* production as the only expression
of multiculturalism at Stanford.
Angelique Jackson of the Stanford
American Indian Organization
said, "It's multicultural only in
'the sense that we're more than

one culture." Multiculturalism is
broader than just these four
groups, she added.
Maria Peters of MEChA, a Chi
cano/Latino student organization,
said that after much discussion,
the four largest student of color
organizations have decided to
stick with tradition, keeping The
Fire Within a production of the
the Asian-American, black, Chi
cano/Latino and Native American
organizations.
Peters said the purpose of the
program is to promote "a better
understanding of the four com
munities and where we come from
culturally, and a better under
standing of our place in the uni
versity."
Both Peters and Jackson
emphasized their groups' willing
ness to work with other student
organizations and participate in
other programs with a multicul
tural focus.
COP member Jamie Green said
it is important to remember that
The Fire Within is not the only
program sponsored by the COR
and that all groups are encour
aged to develop new ideas for
sharing their cultures with other
students.
