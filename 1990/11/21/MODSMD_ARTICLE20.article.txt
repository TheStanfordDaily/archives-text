## On King's plagiarism 
### 
A HYPOTHETICAL DIALOGUE
between two individuals seeking to
make sense of last week's public
disclosure by Stanford historian Clay
borne Carson that Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr. plagiarized in his academic writ
ing;
A: To understand King's erratic use of
quotation marks and footnotes, you have
to go back to his disadvantaged education
in a totally segregated high school. His
early work at Morehouse College revealed
an eighth grade reading level and prob
lems with elementary grammar and
punctuation.
B: It is demeaning of you to imply that
he could not have overcome this early
handicap. His academic record at Crozer
Theological Seminary and Boston Uni
versity, where the plagiarism occurred,
was far superior to that compiled at
Morehouse. Anyway, his overall writing
demonstrates that he was aware of cita
tion procedures by then.
A: But being aware of them is different
from systematic training in their use.
Even at Crozer and Boston, his instruc
tors were negligent. I mean, it's not as if
he dredged up some unknown disserta
tion from another time and place and
secretly plagiarized it. King's own adviser
had supervised the earlier dissertation on
which he relied, and yet apparently never
impressed upon him the importance of
proper citation.
B: A doctoral candidate is an adult and
responsibility lies with him alone for
acknowledging his debts. But since you
mentioned it, the second reader of King's
dissertation draft did note in the margin

his failure to insert quotation marks
around one passage from theologian Paul
Tillich.
A: True, and King failed to make the
suggested revision. But if he was inten
tionally plagiarizing, wouldn't he have
been shrewd enough to make a correction
at least in the one place where he had
been caught? The fact that he didn't
bespeaks carelessness, rather than the
sneaky intent implied by the charge of
plagiarism.
B: And you're probably going to justify
this carelessness by pointing out how
busy he was with his duties as pastor of
Dexter Avenue Baptist Church during the
same period as he was writing his disser
tation.
A: The strain of those duties may be
relevant. But the deeper significance of
the black church was probably that it
inculcated in him an oral tradition in
which preachers routinely adopted the
words of their predecessors. As an orator,
King excelled at what scholars call "voice
merging," or blending the words of others
with his own. This talent may have also
explained his academic emphasis on syn
thesizing the best of divergent theological
traditions, rather than staking out origi
nal ground. According to his adviser, such
a derivative approach was common
among modern theologians.
B: You're just an apologist who cannot
accept the fact that your hero demon
strated his fallibility by violating the
standards of basic academic honesty.
A: I'm just trying to examine the con
text in which this occurred. Once you
acknowledge such possible mitigating fac-

tors as academic training, intent and cul
tural traditions, I am actually very willing
to admit that King was a fallible human
being who made mistakes. Disclosures
like this remind us not to deify our
heroes. Doing so not only sets us up for
disillusionment, but also detracts from
their accomplishments by framing them
as the predictable, indeed the expected,
handiwork of a perfect being, rather than
the outcome of difficult human struggles.
A society that aims, as ours increas
ingly has, to drive all but perfect beings
from its public offices and positions of
favor will soon be left not with truly great
leaders and heroes, but rather with
frauds who are most successful at hiding
their true humanity.
In my disappointment over the taint
on King's scholarship, I have tried not to
lose sight of his primary accomplishment,
which was not so much to introduce orig
inal words as to challenge our people to
breath life into the dead words tney were
already mouthing: "that all men are cre
ated equal." After all, isn't living up to
our words as important as putting quota
tion marks around them?
