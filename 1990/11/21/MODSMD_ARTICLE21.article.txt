## Rally should have examined issues in Gulf crisis thoroughly 
### 
WHAT IF YOU HAD TO GO into a
final exam and write an essay for
three hours on what the United
States should do in the Persian gulf?
As usual, you would have to write a
logical, coherent and consistent essay in
which you present an argument and
thoroughly examine all the issues. You
would have to address and refute all the
counter-arguments involved.
Unfortunately, if someone were to
grade Wednesday evening's rally in
White Plaza on the criteria used to eval
uate an exam essay, there would have to
be a massive curve.
While the prevailing opinion at the
rally, namely that the United States
should withdraw from the Gulf, may
indeed have a great deal of validity, there
was absolutely no compelling argument
put forward to justify it.
Far more disconcerting was the fact
that there was no examination of the
implications of the proposal on the
future of the United States and the Mid-

arguments will not make them go away. We all
must sit back and criticize and analyze our own
views before we act as individuals and as a
nation.

die East.
Is 520,000 people dead in four days
(according to the statistics presented on
the flyer advertising the rally) a com
pelling argument? Did anyone question
the validity of these statistics? Weren't
they from our government, which,
according to most at the rally, lies to us
all the time?
But let us say the statistics are accu
rate. As I recall, several million died in
World War II (I draw NO parallel
between the two situations), but does

that mean we should have sat it out?
Tragedy and death are the defining
factors of war, but they are not always
compelling reasons not to fight on given
occasions. Now clearly this may not be a
war worth fighting, but that is what we
must thoroughly discuss and debate.
There are several other issues which
have been ignored entirely. For example,
it is not totally clear that fewer people
will die if we pull out of the Gulf now.
The odds are extremely strong that
within a very short period of time Iraq

will have nuclear capability which could
possibly lead to a far worse war with far
more casualties in the future.
Whether this could happen or not, we
must discuss and debate what we would
do if it did and what precedents we
would set if we were to fight now to pre
vent this.
In the final analysis, we, as when we
write an essay on an exam, must
approach the problem from all sides and
consider all arguments. Arguing from
emotion and empty slogans, while spiri
tually redeeming for some, is not a Com
pelling argument.
Simply ignoring factors which under
mine our arguments will not make them
go away. We all mast sit back and criti
cize and analyze our own views before
we act as individuals and as a nation.
History will be grading us this time and,
unlike "F's" at Stanford, this "F" will
stick.
