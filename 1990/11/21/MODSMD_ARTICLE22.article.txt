in our building has taken the time to
write you an open letter in The Stanford
Daily, saying essentially that gay and les

Nor are the views of this couple
entirely peculiar. Having attended a
forum on domestic partners, we were
surprised to find a degree of homophobia
we would never have suspected.
But if we have heard expressions of
hate and rejection, so too have we heard
