## 'Celletto' puts entire orchestra at your fingertips 
### Julie Makinen 
Are you a cellist who feels like a repressed
Eddie Van Halen?
Would you be on MTV today, blazing
away with your pedal effects, if only you had
taken up the guitar instead of the cello in 4th
grade?
Chris Chafe started cello lessons at an
early age, too, but today he is no longer lim
ited to Beethoven or Bach, thanks to the cel
letto — an electronic, cello-like instrument
he invented that can sound like anything
from a symphony orchestra to an acoustic
guitar.
Working at Stanford's Center for Com
puter Research in Music and Acoustics,
Chafe began building the celletto in 1988.
The instrument consists of a carved wood
skeleton, strings, a bow, a pitchwriter (device
which translates sound waves into distinct
pitches), a computer and a synthesizer.
The performer plays the celletto like one
would play a cello — with a bow.
Vibrations from the strings are picked up
by transducing elements lying in the bridge
of the celletto and transmitted to the pitch
writer, where they are transformed into dis
tinct pitches.
The notes are finally emitted through a
synthesizer, which is necessary since the cel
letto has no sound box of its own.
Because the transducing elements are
not yet perfected, "the celletto currently is a
good instrument for exploring such dimen
sions as the timbre [the tone quality which
distinguishes the sound of a cello from the
sound of a trumpet or flute], rather than a

tool for ac
complishing
precise pitch
work," said
Chafe.
"The cel
letto is a good
instrument
for improvisa-

tional works," because improvisational
pieces are "open" to pitch errors and are not
greatly affected by slight pitch variations,
he said.
The instrument also provides a good
opportunity for adding new effects and
enhancing expression through bowing.
Many typical guitar pedal effects can be
produced on the celletto, including such
effects as echoes. The sounds of different
instruments — anything from a flute to a
harp to an entire orchestra — can be repro
duced using the celletto because it is all done
through the synthesizer.
Now cellists who never became accom
plished guitarists or synthesizer players can
create personal renditions of their modern
rock favorites using their bows.
One can even be accompanied by a com
plete violin section while playing a solo on
the celletto, and by using the celletto and the
computer, one is always ensured perfect syn
chronization.
What is especially unique about the cel
letto is that it allows a musician to exert ges
tural control through bowing. For example,
a cellist who wanted to play the saxophone in
a certain style could play expressively, using
the bow to achieve the desired sax effect.
