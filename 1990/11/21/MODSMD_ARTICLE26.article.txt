# Computers provide quicker drug testing

It may soon be possible to
predict the effects of drugs on
the human body before they
are actually tested on animals
or humans, according to a
Stanford neurologist.
Using a computer, a drug's
compatibility with a neuron
can be checked by comparing
its molecular structure against
that of the cell's receptor,
according to Dr. Stephen Per
outka, assistant professor of
neurology.
A receptor is the section of a
brain cell which receives
incoming information.
"Our goal was to see if we
can predict whether a drug will
work or not from its chemical
structure, at least as a starting
point — and it's working," Per
outka said.
So far, Peroutka's work
allows the molecular structure
of a particular neuron to be
entered into a computer. That
pattern is then screened
against a list of 10 million
drugs and their molecular

structures.
The computer returns a list
of all drugs that might react
with the neuron in question.
Peroutka said he intends to
adapt the program so that the
name of a drug can be entered
into the computer instead, and
the computer could output a
list of all parts of the brain and
body that the drug will affect.
"So far, our data indicate
that this may be possible," Per
outka said.
Computer screening
tremendously reduces the
amount of work and expense
that is required by traditional
drug screening methods. The
current laboratory tests, which
must be repeated many times,
may only be done at a rate of
about five per hour.
In comparison, Peroutka's
screening program checks 10
million drugs in less than three
hours.
The laboratory method is
slightly more accurate, but
practically speaking, it cannot
be used to test all of the drugs
that are currently available to
pharmacologists.
In screening for a particular
receptor, Peroutka was once given
the name of a drug last studied in
India ten years ago.
According to Peroutka, the
databases of chemicals' molecular

structures have been available for
many years.
"The question was: was there a
way to read those structural files
and make some hypothesis about
a particular receptor?" he said.
Working with Anne Schmidt, a
Stanford molecular biologist, Per
outka studied 19 drugs that were
known to work with the receptor
of a specific neuron. They were
able to develop nine "criteria" for
how a molecule should look in
order to react with the receptor.

To test their hypothesis, a drug
which differed from the criteria
by only one atom was tested on
the receptor. As expected, the
drug was rejected.
These results were published
in the October issue of Molecular
Pharmacology, a scientific jour
nal.
A program was later written
that allowed a computer to do all
of the necessary molecular struc
ture comparisons automatically.
The program was run with a

database of 40 drugs, and those
same 40 drugs were tested simul
taneously in a laboratory.
"In comparison, the computer
was very, very close in predicting
experimental drug effects," Per
outka said.
Peroutka said he wants to
improve the accuracy of his com
puter program and indicated that
the use of artificial intelligence is
key in giving the computer the
ability to recognize similarities
between molecular patterns.
