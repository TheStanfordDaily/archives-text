# Computers provide quicker drug testing

It may soon be possible to
predict the effects of drugs on
the human body before they
are actually tested on animals
or humans, according to a
Stanford neurologist.
Using a computer, a drug's
compatibility with a neuron
can be checked by comparing
its molecular structure against
that of the cell's receptor,
according to Dr. Stephen Per
outka, assistant professor of
neurology.
A receptor is the section of a
brain cell which receives
incoming information.
"Our goal was to see if we
can predict whether a drug will
work or not from its chemical
structure, at least as a starting
point â€” and it's working," Per
outka said.
So far, Peroutka's work
allows the molecular structure
of a particular neuron to be
entered into a computer. That
pattern is then screened
against a list of 10 million
drugs and their molecular

structures.
The computer returns a list
of all drugs that might react
with the neuron in question.
Peroutka said he intends to
adapt the program so that the
name of a drug can be entered
into the computer instead, and
the computer could output a
list of all parts of the brain and
body that the drug will affect.
"So far, our data indicate
that this may be possible," Per
outka said.
Computer screening
tremendously reduces the
amount of work and expense
that is required by traditional
drug screening methods. The
current laboratory tests, which
must be repeated many times,
may only be done at a rate of
about five per hour.
In comparison, Peroutka's
screening program checks 10
million drugs in less than three
hours.
The laboratory method is
slightly more accurate, but
practically speaking, it cannot
