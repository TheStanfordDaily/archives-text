# Urban exercisers: beware polluted air
## 
### Monica Uddin 
For many people on the Farm,
exercise is a way of life.
On a typical day, you can see
bikers headed for the Foothills,
joggers circling Campus Drive and
walkers strolling around the Oval.
But have you ever stopped to
wonder if exercising in"the great
outdoors" can do you more harm
than good?
The problem, as you can proba
bly guess, is air pollution.
In this era of high technology,
we are bombarded with every
thing from auto exhaust to factory
waste to paint fumes. These pollu
tants often contaminate urban air,
putting an added strain on the
respiratory system when it's
exerted during exercise.
But "even for a polluted urban
area," it's not necessarily health
ier to refrain from outdoor exer
cise â€” just be cautious of the
route you take, said Lynn Hilde
mann, assistant professor of civil
engineering.
Luckily, the Stanford area
rarely has any megor episodes of
air pollution, according to Hilde
mann, who is also part of an envi
ronmental engineering group at
Stanford.
Hildemann said she does not
believe there is much risk in out
door exercise on campus.

However, exercisers will be
"doing themselves a big favor" by
running around campus rather
than on El Camino Real, she said.
However, in larger urban areas,
the risk may be greater.
One of the main culprits of air
pollution is carbon monoxide,
which is caused largely by the
incomplete combustion of fossil
fuels and is found in everything
from auto emissions to cigarette
smoke. This gas binds easily to
hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying
molecule in red blood cells, and

disrupts the oxygen supply to the
body.
Because of this oxygen deficit,
the heart must work harder to
send sufficient amounts of oxy
gen-laden blood to the body.
Although healthy people don't
appear to be at a short-term risk
from carbon monoxide exposure,
those who suffer from coronary
artery disease should be cautious.
Low-level concentrations of the
gas, typical in most large cities,
were recently found to increase
the occurrence of ventricular

arrythmia.
These ill-timed contractions of
the heart tire the leading cause of
sudden death due to heart attack
and represent approximately
350,000 deaths per year.
In addition, research has
shown that exercise at low levels
of carbon monoxide worsens
ischemia, or oxygen deprivation,
in people whose hearts have stiff,
clogged arteries.
Another mtyor menace to respi
ratory health is ozone, a gas pro
duced when ultraviolet radiation
reacts with chemicals called
hydrocarbons from factory waste,
auto exhaust and other sources.
An ozone molecule becomes a
charged atom, or radical, when
one of its three oxygen atoms
breaks off. These radicals damage
cells in the respiratory tract by
releasing thromboxane, a sub
stance that irritates and con
stricts the bronchial tubes.
A 1988 study conducted by the
Environmental Protection Agency
indicated that college students
who exercised for almost 7 hours
in air approaching the EPA ozone
limit experienced reductions in
lung capacity leading to coughing,
shortness of breath and painful
breathing.

Although the students' lungs
returned to normal after a few
hours or days, the researchers
believe that continued exposure
might lead to chronic respiratory
problems later in life.
Despite all the disheartening
news, most people have little
cause to panic. Unless you're an

outdoor athlete who needs to
maintain peak performance, the
small oxygen deficit won't be
missed.
The best advice is to avoid
working out during midday, when
ozone levels are at their highest.
You could also try exercising in
a wooded area, as trees absorb
some of the pollution from the air.
And, as a last resort, there's
always the gym: ozone levels
indoors are usually half of what
they are outside.
