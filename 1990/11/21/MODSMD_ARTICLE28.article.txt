Q. Which library is safer in an
• earthquake, Meyer or
ureen?
A. That question is a lot like
• asking, "Which seat is safer
in a car wreck, the driver's or pas
senger's?" The answer depends on
where the car is hit and how hard.
And while one seat may be
safer in many types of crashes, if
your car is hit by a train, you're
history no matter where you sit.
Likewise with Meyer and Green,
there isn't a simple answer.
We spoke with Fouad
Bendimerad, who studies the
earthquake safety of buildings on
campus, and he was happy to fill
us in on what will fall down.
Bendimerad said that because
safety codes and construction
techniques are constantly improv
ing, newer buildings are generally
safer than older ones.
He explained that the support
ing members of modern buildings
are generally made of reinforced
concrete — a composite material
of steel reinforcing rods embedded
in a mixture of stones, sand and
cement.
Like most composite materials,

reinforced concrete has very dif
ferent properties than the materi
als from which it is made.
Although concrete itself is gen
erally brittle and liable to crumble
in an earthquake, reinforced con
crete will bend quite a bit before it
breaks.
As an example, parts of the
Museum of Art, which is made of
unreinforced concrete, cracked
and crumbled during the Earth
quake of '89 and the building is
now too hazardous to enter.
Compare that with the much
larger high-rises in Escondido Vil

iage, which shook but remained
standing. There, the modern rein
forced concrete flexed but did not
crumble. The buildings are still
safe to occupy.
However, even a reinforced
concrete structure can be danger
ous if it is designed improperly.
If, for example, support mem
bers do not go all the way from
foundation to the roof, the shak
ing stresses during a quake can be
concentrated on a few support
beams, overloading them and
causing them to crumble.
In California, this is usually
forbidden by building codes, but it
is not always true in other parts of
the country.
Even with all of this informa
tion, it is important to remember
the car-crash analogy when think
ing about relative quake safety.
Saying that building A is safer
than building B means that if
there were 100 A's and 100 B's
and these experienced 100 differ
ent earthquakes, A would be left
standing more often than B.
Since each earthquake is differ
ent and you are only likely to
experience a few in your lifetime
(less if they are really big), this
small sample size makes safety
predictions almost meaningless,

unless one building is really a
death-trap.
As for Meyer vs. Green,
Bendimerad said that they are
both about equally safe, with the
exception of the oldest part of
Green, which is so hazardous that
it is now closed.
Although the new parts of
Green are newer than Meyer, both
have similarly safety-conscious
designs and materials.
Bendimerad did not advise
picking one as safer than the
other, and the Bugs suggest that
you choose on the basis of the best
sleeping spots.
Bendimerad also gave the com
mon but sensible advice of getting
next to or under a desk or table
during an earthquake, then leav
ing the building quickly and care
fully once it stops.
The reasons are simple: as you
run screaming out of the building,
you are totally unprotected from
the falling nasties which usually
stop raining down once the shak
ing stops.
Since most quakes are not
severe enough to crumble modern
buildings and you are very likely
to be croaked by a falling light fix
ture as you run out, it is better to
stay under cover until the shaking
stops, then get out.
