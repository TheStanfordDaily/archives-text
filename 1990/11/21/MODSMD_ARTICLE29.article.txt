# What's good for you; what isn't: nutrition myths debunked
## 
### Shobhit Arora 
In our increasingly health-con
scious society, nutrition has
become a hot topic for research
and commercial exploitation.
Weight reduction has become a
billion-dollar industry that offers
a plethora of weight-loss tech
niques — everything from liquid
diets to grapefruit pills.
It is not surprising that, with
the barrage of health-related
advertisements we encounter on
television and in newspapers and
magazines, many people are left
confused as to what constitutes
good health practices and what
does not.
Most of us have heard such
blanket statements about nutri
tion as "saturated fat is bad for
you" and "fiber is good for you."
But how many people know
specifically which foods are high
in saturated fat and which are
high in fiber?
The problem with nutrition is

not always our misinterpretation
of the facts, but rather, our appli
cation of those facts to our daily
eating habits.
In other words, we must learn
to distinguish the true health
claims about foods from the nutri
tional myths.
Some of the more important
misconceptions that people have
about nutrition are addressed
below.
Myth: Red meat is bad for you
because it is high in fat.
Fact: Lean red meat, such as
flank steak or lean ham, has as lit
tle fat as the dark meat in chicken
and turkey.
Furthermore, it is a much bet-

ter source of iron and zinc, two
minerals in short supply in our
diet.
Although you should try to
limit your overall consumption of
red meat, especially in fast food
restaurants and dorm food service
(where the meat is often of low
grade quality, high in saturated
fat and fried in preparation), it is
important to realize that red meat
does have some beneficial nutri
tional value.
Myth: Chicken meals are the
best choice at fast food restaurants
because they have less fat than
comparable meals containing
beef
Fact: A typical chicken entree,
such as Chicken McNuggets,
derives almost two-thirds of its
calories from fat. Compare this to
a regular fast food hamburger, in
which only one-fifth of the calo
ries are from fat.
Myth: Foods that say "choles
terol free" are good for your heart.
Fact: Although "cholesterol-

ments about nutrition as 'saturated fat is bad
for you,' but how many people know specifi
cally which foods are high In saturated fat?

free" foods may have little or no
cholesterol, they often high in sat
urated fats such as coconut oil and
palm oil. Remember to read labels
and make sure that such "choles
terol-free" foods are also low in fat
before buying them.
Myth: Granola is a healthy
food.
Fact: Granola often contains a
lot of fat, up to 25 grams, and a
single cup may have between 500
and 600 calories.
Opt instead for cereals such as
shredded wheat and raisin bran,
which have under 200 calories and
one to two grams of fat per cup.
Myth: Eating one or two
meals a day is the best way to lose

weight.
Fact: When trying to lose
weight, it is best to eat four to six
smaller meals per day. A research
study showed that people who ate
2,000 calories in two meals per
day actually gained weight, while
those who had the same caloric
intake in four to six meals per day
lost weight.
Myth: Dieting will always help
you lose weight.
Fact: Dieting can actually
make you fat because it reduces
the amount of energy your body
uses to maintain itself.
Dieting also enhances the
body's ability to convert food into
fat. The best way to lose weight is

to reduce the amount of fat in
your diet (thereby reducing total
caloric intake) and to exercise aer
obically for about 20 minutes,
three to four times a week.
In our world of commercialized
health, nutrition can often be as
confusing as a Chem 33 midterm,
but it need not be. The key is mod
eration, both in what you eat and
how much you eat. Remember to
eat a variety of foods, especially
plenty of fruits and vegetables,
avoid eating too much meat, and
get plenty of exercise.

In our increasingly health-con
scious society, nutrition has
become a hot topic for research
and commercial exploitation.
Weight reduction has become a
billion-dollar industry that offers
a plethora of weight-loss tech
niques — everything from liquid
diets to grapefruit pills.
It is not surprising that, with
the barrage of health-related
advertisements we encounter on
television and in newspapers and
magazines, many people are left
confused as to what constitutes
good health practices and what
does not.
Most of us have heard such
blanket statements about nutri
tion as "saturated fat is bad for
you" and "fiber is good for you."
But how many people know
specifically which foods are high
in saturated fat and which are
high in fiber?
The problem with nutrition is

not always our misinterpretation
of the facts, but rather, our appli
cation of those facts to our daily
eating habits.
In other words, we must learn
to distinguish the true health
claims about foods from the nutri
tional myths.
Some of the more important
misconceptions that people have
about nutrition are addressed
below.
Myth: Red meat is bad for you
because it is high in fat.
Fact: Lean red meat, such as
flank steak or lean ham, has as lit
tle fat as the dark meat in chicken
and turkey.
Furthermore, it is a much bet-

ter source of iron and zinc, two
minerals in short supply in our
diet.
Although you should try to
limit your overall consumption of
red meat, especially in fast food
restaurants and dorm food service
(where the meat is often of low
grade quality, high in saturated
fat and fried in preparation), it is
important to realize that red meat
does have some beneficial nutri
tional value.
Myth: Chicken meals are the
best choice at fast food restaurants
because they have less fat than
comparable meals containing
beef
Fact: A typical chicken entree,
such as Chicken McNuggets,
derives almost two-thirds of its
calories from fat. Compare this to
a regular fast food hamburger, in
which only one-fifth of the calo
ries are from fat.
Myth: Foods that say "choles
terol free" are good for your heart.
Fact: Although "cholesterol-

free" foods may have little or no
cholesterol, they often high in sat
urated fats such as coconut oil and
palm oil. Remember to read labels
and make sure that such "choles
terol-free" foods are also low in fat
before buying them.
Myth: Granola is a healthy
food.
Fact: Granola often contains a
lot of fat, up to 25 grams, and a
single cup may have between 500
and 600 calories.
Opt instead for cereals such as
shredded wheat and raisin bran,
which have under 200 calories and
one to two grams of fat per cup.
Myth: Eating one or two
meals a day is the best way to lose

weight.
Fact: When trying to lose
weight, it is best to eat four to six
smaller meals per day. A research
study showed that people who ate
2,000 calories in two meals per
day actually gained weight, while
those who had the same caloric
intake in four to six meals per day
lost weight.
Myth: Dieting will always help
you lose weight.
Fact: Dieting can actually
make you fat because it reduces
the amount of energy your body
uses to maintain itself.
Dieting also enhances the
body's ability to convert food into
fat. The best way to lose weight is

to reduce the amount of fat in
your diet (thereby reducing total
