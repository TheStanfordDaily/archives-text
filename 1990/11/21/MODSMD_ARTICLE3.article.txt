# Anti-war activists begin fast
## 
### Manjusha Pawagi 
While most people at Stanford are getting
ready for a Thanksgiving filled with turkey and
pumpkin pies, some members of the community
plan to mark the holiday by not eating anything.
At a press conference yesterday, the group,
which formed at the anti-war rally in White Plaza
last week, announced the beginning of a
Thanksgiving week peace fast to protest the U.S.
military buildup in tne Persian Gulf.
Ten of the protesters have begun fasting since
Sunday and have been drinking only water.

"This is to show people that we're really seri
ous about stopping a war, that we're willing to
undergo something that personally affects us,"
said Kate Morris, a graduate student who has
fasted for two days.
"It's not like a rally where you just go home
afterwards and it's over; the fast continues,"
Morris added.
She said the fast is also designed to show sym
pathy for the Iraqi people who are being hurt by
the food embargo led by the United States.

Wall" In Whita Plaza yesterday. Chang la ona of at laaat 10 atudanta faatlng to protaat tha U.S. mil

"Last year, with the end of the
Cold War, there was much to be
thankful for," Morris said. "This
year, we fast, so that next year we
can be thankful that we will have
prevented a war in the Middle
East," she added.
Marty Smith, a junior, said a
fast is "a little more of a commit
ment than signing a petition."
While he's fasting, Smith said he
will also protest by not driving his
car or riding in anybody else's car.
Steven Bank-Guzman, a sopho
more, is in the fourth day of his
fast. "I have never felt such pain
in my life," he said. But he said he
thinks it is worth it because we
need to create global awareruss.
We need to understand that we co
exist in this world."
"I'm fasting to protest the pos
sibility of war," said Rev. Herb
Schmidt, a Lutheran Campus
Pastor, "and to viscerally experi
ence in my own body a small taste
of the terrible hunger, depriva
tion, horror and hardship which
will be experienced by thousands
of innocent people if war becomes
a reality."
John Chang, a senior, said the
group hopes to continue the Peace
Fast after Thanksgiving as well.
"We want to sign people up to
take turns fasting, a few days at a
time, until the end of the school
year in June, or until the soldiers
come home," said Chang.
The group will try to recruit
enough students to start such a
"chain fast" Monday at a table in
White Plaza.
The group spoke yesterday in
front of the newly erected Peace
Wall, a curved wall of plywood
panels that was painted with
names, poetry and pictures during
the overnight peace rally.
