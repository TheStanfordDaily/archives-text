# Anti-war activists begin fast

### Manjusha Pawagi 
While most people at Stanford are getting
ready for a Thanksgiving filled with turkey and
pumpkin pies, some members of the community
plan to mark the holiday by not eating anything.
At a press conference yesterday, the group,
which formed at the anti-war rally in White Plaza
last week, announced the beginning of a
Thanksgiving week peace fast to protest the U.S.
military buildup in tne Persian Gulf.
Ten of the protesters have begun fasting since
Sunday and have been drinking only water.

"This is to show people that we're really seri
ous about stopping a war, that we're willing to
undergo something that personally affects us,"
said Kate Morris, a graduate student who has
fasted for two days.
"It's not like a rally where you just go home
afterwards and it's over; the fast continues,"
Morris added.
She said the fast is also designed to show sym
pathy for the Iraqi people who are being hurt by
the food embargo led by the United States.
