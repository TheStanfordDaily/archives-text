## Spikers end regular season with win; face NCAAs 
### Harold Yu Staff writer 
San Jose State coach John Cor
belli knows Stanford pretty well.
Apparently, he thinks the Cardi
nal is pretty good.
"Stanford is a great team,"
Corbelli said. "This is probably
the best team they've ever had.
They've got everything: the
defense, the blocking and the hit
ting."

The fact that the No. 3 Cardi
nal had just swept Corbelli's Spar
tans may have had something to
do with his generous words. Last
night, Stanford made firm believ
ers of the San Jose contingent,
prevailing at Burnham Pavilion
15-11, 15-9, 15-7. The team fin
ished the 1990 regular season
with its eleventh consecutive win
and a 25-3 record.
"We could have played better,"
senior Cheryl Conly said. "But we
were in control the whole time.
There was never any doubt in any
of our minds."
Even so, the No. 10 Spartans
were not quite ready to buckle
under. San Jose State effectively
utilized a staunch outside attack
and aggressive serving to push the
Cardinal in every game. Stan
ford's high octane offense experi
enced a few kinks for the first
time in several matches.
"Some people expect us to ham
mer every team ranked below us,"

Stanford coach Don Shaw said.
"But that's not always going to
happen. San Jose State is a good
team."
The Spartans showed that
early, testing the Cardinal in game
one. After a Jennifer Jackson kill
lifted Stanford ahead 4-1, San
Jose answered with a 5-1 streak of
its own. All-AmericanB Bev Oden
and Kristin Klein each struck
kills, powering Stanford to a 7-6
advantage.
San Jose would have none of it,
though. They blocked a Cardinal
attack, forcing Shaw to call time
out. The Spartan blockers had
only two blocks on the night but
deflected an untold number of
balls up for its back row.
"I thought we blocked well and
attacked well," Corbelli said. "But
we put ourselves in a lot of trouble
with our passing."
The Cardinal caught on. Stan
ford exploited the Spartan let
down with a 8-5 game-ending run.
Klein rushed out of the team hud
dle to deliver an ace. San Jose
State fumbled two more passes,
falling behind 8-10. A thundering
block by Amy Cooper and three
Oden kills put an end to the game.
"We were pretty prepared for
what they were going to do,"
senior Tracy Hughes said. "They
came out playing well but we were
able to steady out."
San Jose State was still able to
stalemate the Cardinal in game
two anyway. The squads tied at 3-
3 and 5-5 before Stanford could
inch ahead.
Cooper menaced the Spartan
defense with three kills in the
game. She finished with 10 kills
and only one error for a match
high .600 hitting percentage.

As is fast becoming customary,
Oden hit an opposing player in the
face during an attack. At 7-5, the
6-foot-2 middle blocker pounded
San Jose's Heather McPherson in
the cheek. Klein followed Oden's
face-crush with a hard kill of her
own.
Cooper and setter Carrie Feld
man teamed for a block at 11-8 as
Stanford pulled away. Stanford
had 11 total team blocks on the
night. Oden led the Cardinal with
one solo block and four block
assists.
"At times we were out of sync,"
Shaw said. "San Jose State
changed the timing of our offense.
But we still came back to win
those games."
The third one, nevertheless,
would be a chore. San Jose's Daw
nis Wilson and Betsy Welsh
pounded the Spartans to a 7-3
advantage. Welsh and Wilson each
had 14 kills in the match. Their
team hit only .178 in the game but
was able to constrict Stanford's
offensive options with accurate
serving.
It didn't last. The Spartans
stalled at seven and watched the
Cardinal rock on an 8-0, match
ending run. Jackson and Oden
recorded back-to-back blocks to
charge the team.
"We got a little tentative," Cor
belli said. "Stanford is tough.
They'll keep coming back at you.
They're not going to just give
games away."
Certainly not. Stanford has
surrendered one game in its last
three matches against ranked
opponents. The team hopes to
continue thiss trend as it prepares
for the NCAA playoffs.
"I thought it was good that we

could beat them in three," Benton
said. "We're very confident right
now because we're right on pace."
The first round of the Western
Regional will be played Thursday,
Nov. 29. Because the Cardinal is
so highly-ranked the team's first
round match will likely be played
here at Burnham Pavilion.
If Stanford wins, the team will
compete in the regional tourna

ment. The location of this champi
onship will be announced after the
first round has been completed.
The likely sites are UCLA's
Pauley Pavilion and Stanford's
own Maples Pavilion.
The final NCAA poll was
announced late yesterday. The
Cardinal finished No. 3 in the
nation behind top-ranked UCLA
and Nebraska. Because Stanford

did not earn a No. 2 ranking,
UCLA and the Cardinal will both
remain in the Western regional.
Barring an upset, the teams will
meet in the championship match.
The winner will advance to the
Final Four in Maryland.
This season, Stanford compiled
the third best record in school his
tory.
