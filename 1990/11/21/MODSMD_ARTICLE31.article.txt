# Big Game is biggest when it's held in Memorial Stadium
## 
### 
Football season is over. And what an
ending it was. In a season full of ups
and downs (unfortunately more of
the latter), the Stanford Cardinal pro
vided its fans with a storybook finish that
rivals any ever seen on a gridiron.
If you were there, you know exactly
what I mean. If you weren't, you won't
quite understand. All I can say is: I'm
sorry. You missed one of the greatest
experiences of Stanford.
Those of you who aren't sports fans
(although I doubt you'd be reading this if
you weren't) can easily roll your eyes and
derisively scoff at this. It was just a foot
ball game, right?
Well, if it was any other game, even
with the same miraculous ending, you
might have a point. But this was more
than a football game. It was bigger than
the Superbowl or the 49ers. It was hilar
ity and drama, excitement and agony. It
was a testament to the human spirit.
And it was a darned good time.
Last year, towards the end of the sea
son, I talked to cornerback Kevin Scott.
He mentioned that he wasn't looking for
ward to finishing his career in Memorial

Stadium, where the atmosphere is any
thing but inviting. I, however, have to dis
agree.#
I'm sure Tuan Van Le would have to
disagree as well. So would anybody at the
1988 Big Game at Cal, the most exciting
finish to a game I'd ever seen ... until
last Saturday.
There is nothing like Big Game at
Memorial Stadium. I say this now, but I
said it to friends last week, too. My one
game there had convinced me of that. The
atmosphere in Berkeley creates an aura
around the proceedings that breathes
passion and drama.
This is not a knock against Stanford
Stadium per se, but the feeling is defi

nitely more laid-back there. The fans are
a good 30 yards from the action, due to
the track around the field. Maybe it's
partly due to the fact that the two Big
Games I've seen there have been Stan
ford romps. Great, to be sure, but not the
most pressure-packed, thrilling victories
I've seen. And as soon as Stanford gets
comfortably ahead, the bored and frus
trated (Berkeley) fans begin to try to kill
each other.
That's why I'm so happy my parents
had the foresight to give birth to me in
1969, so Big Game my senior year could
be in Berkeley. Memorial is a true football
stadium â€” you're almost literally breath
ing down the players' necks the whole
game.
This not only lets the fans get really
involved in the action, but it also makes
fruit-throwing much more exciting.
There's also something about the way
the stands at Cal make a complete circle,
and how you can look around at a sea of
blue and gold interrupted by the endzone
section of swarming cardinal and white
faithful. Looking at the crowd, you under
stand why they call this "Big Game."

In 1988, an exciting game seemed cer
tain to end up in a dramatic loss for Stan
ford. With the teams tied at 19-all and
only a few seconds left, Cal had managed
to work its way down to the Stanford two
yard line. Kicker Robbie Keen needed
only a 19-yard chip shot for the game.
The blue and gold fans were going crazy.
I, and the rest of the Cardinal fans and
players, were praying for a miracle.
Unbelievably, Van Le snuck through
and blocked the kick. Utter silence
emanted from the majority of the sta
dium, while in the endzone, we went
nuts. Slowly, the chant began to build:
"We keep the Axe! We keep the Axe!"
I still get a warm feeling remembering
that game.
But the 1990 game... well, what can I
really say? It's all been said and written
before, but you really had to be there. If I
live to be 110, I won't forget Ed McCaf
frey first dropping a pass in that final
drive, then making the touchdown recep
tion in the corner of the endzone, right in
front of us. I hugged everyone in sight.
I'll never forget the two-point conver
sion, which Denny Green had enough

guts to go for rather than end the game in
a tie for the second time in three years.
Who wants to keep the Axe like that?
Even if the Cardinal had lost, I'd still
think it was the right decision.
For a time, I thought we had lost. I'll
never forget the horror I felt when Cal
intercepted the ball in the endzone and
seemingly ended the game. I watched the
Berkeley students pour on the field, and I
looked up at the clock, expecting it to read
:00.
But instead, it read :12. Wait a minute.
The penalty moved up the kickofT to
the 50-yard line. Maybe. ... Almost as if
in a dream, Kevin Scott recovered the
onsides kick. I wonder what he thought of
Memorial right then? Another penalty
put the ball on the 22-yard line. The 22?!
We could actually. ...
John Hopkins strode onto the field for
the final kick of his college career. You
know the rest.
I love Memorial Stadium.

David Hinting thinks going to the Big
Game at Cal should be made one of the
new distribution requirements.
