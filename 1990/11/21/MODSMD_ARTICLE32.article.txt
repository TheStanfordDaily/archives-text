# Aquaflingers shoot for the national championship
## 
### Aden Fine Staff writer 
At the beginning of the year, the Stanford water
polo team set a goal to win the NCAA championship,
and now twenty nine games and twenty four wins
later, the goal is within reach.
; WTiile most Stanford students will be relaxing and
eating turkey this Thanksgiving weekend, the Cardi
nal water polo team will be in Long Beach at the Bel
mont Plaza Pool trying to win the national title.
; The tournament will begin for Stanford Friday
afternoon at 4:30 p.m. against Air Force, and if all
goes well, the Cardinal will hopefully be playing for
the championship Sunday night at 7:30 p.m.
; Stanford has won six national titles over the years
and, in so doing, the Cardinal has established an
incredible streak — since 1975, every member of a
Stanford team has been a part of a national champi
bnship team.
; However, no one on this year's team has ever been
fortunate enough to share in such a victory. As coach
Dante Dettamanti said, "This year's senior class
could be the first group we've had that has not won
a national championship, and we clearly don't want
that to happen. Everyone wants to do it for our four
seniors, and we're going to do our best."
If the Cardinal, seeded second in the tournament,
is going to continue its amazing streak, the team will
first have to get through the No. 10 Air Force Fal
cons in the opening game of the single elimination
tournament.
The first game of the NCAAs is usually an easy
game for the top seeds, but don't expect the Cardinal
to look past its opponent. Air Force is 19-6 on the
year, and Dettamanti called them the "best team
outside of California."
In addition, Dettamanti said, "This is the NCAAs,
and we can't think of any team as a pushover. We
treated the [Univ. of] Pacific game kind of lightly, and
we almost lost that game (the team won 11-10].
We've got to be psyched up right from the start and
oome out focused and play like the game is for the
national championship, even though it's just our
first game."
The importance of the first game can not be over
estimated, for if a team can have an easy victory,
then the starters can be rested for the upcoming
games that will be much tougher and more strain
ing.
Besides the obvious importance of winning the
first game, the team will also have to get by its sec-

to only two or three goals, we'll
have a real chance at winning.'

ond round opponent which will likely be UC-Santa
Barbara, the third seed in the tournament.
Santa Barbara is 22-7 on the year and has given
Stanford two of its tougher games of the year. The
Cardinal won both games, but just barely, as the
scores were 7-5 and 9-8.
As is evident, Santa Barbara will definitely be a
challenge for the No. 2 Cardinal to overcome. As Det
tamanti said, "They've been really tough in the last
couple of weeks. We had a hard time with them at the
beginning of the year, and they're playing even bet
ter now. It'll be a struggle for sure."
If the Cardinal does win the 7:30 p.m. game Sat
urday night, its opponent in the finals will probably
be none other than the top team in the country, Cal
ifornia. The same Bears team that has defeated
Stanford in all four of the teams' meetings this year
and just dominated the Cardinal in the Big Splash
last weekend.
Clearly, the road to the national championship
will not be an easy one. Still, Dettamanti and his
players know that they have a chance.
"You never know what's going to happen in
NCAAs," he said. "We've had a great year except for
the games against Cal, and we're going to try and do
everything in our power to come away with the title.
There's the hope that anything can happen in the
tournament, but if we're going to beat Cal, we'll
need a super game."
Senior Rick McNair, who is the Cardinal's leading
scorer with 53 goals, also knows it will take a great
effort to win the title. "This is my last chance to win
a championship, and I think we have a shot at it. Cal

is clearly a better team than us, so it might take
some kind of Big Game miracle for us to beat them.
If we're going to win, it'll take a magical game."
And it will also be necessary to stop California's
Chris Humbert, who dominated Big Splash and
almost single-handedly beat Stanford with an amaz
ing seven goals. As Dettamanti said, "We're defi
nitely going to try something different against Hum
bert. They depend so much on him that if we can
hold him to only two or three goals, we'll have a real
chance at winning."
Another thing that may work in the Cardinal's
favor is that the Bears will have a very tough second
round game. After opening against Brown, Califor
nia will have to play the winner of the UCLA-Pepper
dine game. Pepperdine is the only team that has
beaten Cal this year, and UCLA has a very talented
team that was ranked No. 2 for much of the year.
But all of that can be disregarded, because it is

now time for the tournament. And as a handwritten,
scrawled sign that is taped up on the window of the
water polo office says,"It only takes three games.
Win guys."
Card notes
In other news, Stanford's protest of the loss to UCLA
two weekends ago was upheld by the Pacific 10 Conference.
The game has been declared a "no-contest."
The Pac-10 announced its annual awards on Monday.
California's Steve Heaston was named the coach of the
year and Humbert was named the player of the year. Stan
ford's Colin Keely and Rick McNair were also named to the
all-conference team. McNair is the only returning selection
besides Humbert.
The tournament will mark the end of the Stanford
careers of four seniors. Besides Keely end McNair, Chuck
Msguy and Greg Olson will also be playing their last games
as members of the Stanford team.
