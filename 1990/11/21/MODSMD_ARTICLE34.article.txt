# McCaffrey is All-America
## 
### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
They've ranted and raved all year. Picked
him as a preseason All-American, sent the pro
scouts to analyze his every move, whispered
that he was the next Jerry Rice in the making.
The Kodak selection committee articulated
the premonitions and compliments by choos
ing wide receiver Ed McCaffrey as a First-
Team All American this past weekend.
The 6-5 split end from Allentown, Pa.
becomes the first Cardinal receiver since Ken
Margerum in 1980 to earn the distinction, and
the first Stanford player since fullback Brad
Muster and linebacker Dave Wyman in 1986 to
be recognized nationally.
The fifth-year senior overcame slight but
nagging injuries to snag a piece of Stanford
history. Even though he missed the season
opener at Colorado and two second-halves of
contests, McCaffrey ran-up a 61-reception
tally, eight touchdowns, and a Pacific 10 Con
ference-leading 917 yards though the air.
His 176 yards and four touchdowns versus
Washington State was one of the greatest
games ever posted by a Cardinal receiver.
"The nice thing is that he really deserved
it," said offensive coordinator Ron Turner.
"He's had a tremendous year and he's been so
important to the team."
And though he had 146 career receptions,
fifth in the Stanford record books, he may for
ever be remembered by fans on the Farm for
his second and final reception at Berkeley Sat
urday.
Plagued by a pulled calf muscle, McCaffey
was rendered almost impotent during the
entire Big Game, until the Cardinal just had to
have his services. Symbolizing his nationally
renowned talent, McCaffrey rose to the occa
sion. When the Cardinal embarked on one
final, desperation drive, it was McCaffrey
whom Jason Palumbis found open in the end
zone to set up Stanford's improbable 27-25 vic
tory.
McCaffrey's last second reception, however,
was far from the only memorable performance
at California. Two other Cardinal greats
helped carry Stanford to what may have been
the greatest victory in the history of the Big
Game, and were recognized for their contribu
tions.
Running back Glyn Milburn and place
kicker John Hopkins were selected as the
Pacific 10 Conference offensive and special
teams Players of the Week.
