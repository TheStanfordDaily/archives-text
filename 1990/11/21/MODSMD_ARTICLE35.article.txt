# Women open against Vols
## 
### David Hirning Senior staff writer 
Take two injured starters, an
uncertain lineup, a road opener,
national television, and the No. 6-
ranked Tennessee Lady Volun
teers as opponents, and what do
you have? A very nervous basket
ball team, it would seem.
But this is the Stanford Cardi
nal, ranked No. 2, defending
NCAA champion. These are play
ers that aren't used to losing.
Despite the long odds staring
them in the face for the 11 a.m.
(PST) face-off Sunday with Ten
nessee, the Cardinal women may
not be as gloomy as some pundits
might think. No one knows what
will go down at the oft-sold out
Thompson-Boling Arena Sunday
morning, not even Stanford coach
Tara VanDerveer.
"I would expect the veiy unex
pected. I have no idea what's
going to happen," VanDerveer
said.
These are the question marks
that are currently hanging over
the Cardinal's collective head:
center Trisha Stevens, with ten
donitis in both knees, did not play
at all in Stanford's only preseason
game and hopes to be ready by
Sunday; forward/center Val Whit
ing, whose knee injury in that
game kept her out of practice for a
week; the off-guard spot, where
Molly Goodenbour was placed in
the preseason but has now been
given tentatively to freshman
Christy Hedgpeth.
In addition, reserve guard Ann
Adkins has a stress fracture in the
left tibia and is out for four to six
weeks.
VanDerveer noted the uncer
tainty that her team faces going
into such a big game could be a
factor. "It's definitely thrown off
our timing, I think," she said. "We
haven't been able to play our front
three (Whiting, Stevens, and Julie
Zeilstra) the whole preseason.
People are going to have to just jell
during the season."
These are the game's definites:
The Lady Vols are good, very good;
and the arena will be jam-packed
with 20,000 screaming Tennessee
fans.
Conversely, Stanford should

feel somewhat at home on Sunday.
Fans will recall that Thompson-
Boling is the site of the Cardinal's
greatest triumph: last year's
NCAA Final Four victory and the
national championship. Admit
tedly, the crowd was slightly less
partisan last year, as the Lady Vols
were eliminated from the tourna
ment in the regional final.
Stanford's rise to national
prominence is measured in the
Tennessee series. The two-time
national champion Lady Vols were
out of the Cardinal's class before
the last few years, and the two
teams met for the first time in the
1988-89 season. The site was
Thompson-Boling and the game
was all Tennessee, 83-60.
Junior guard Jennifer Azzi
returned to her home state but
could only manage eight points
against the Vols, who would go on
to win the NCAA title. Katy Sted
ing led Stanford with 15 points.
VanDerveer later spoke of Ten
nessee giving the Cardinal "a les
son" in big-time college basketball
that day. Graciously, Stanford
returned the favor when they
played host to the Vols at Maples
the following year. The crowd,
over 5,000 strong, set a record for
women's basketball at Stanford
and the Cardinal responded with a
convincing 85-71 win.
Junior point guard Sonja Hen
ning emerged as a big-time player
with 23 points, and Stanford con
vinced the doubters that they
were for real. It was the first real
step on the road to the Cardinal's
national championship.
The team hopes to take a simi
lar step this season in the opener
for both teams. But the Lady Vols,
led by post player Daedra Charles,
will be looking for revenge for last

year's pasting and will be the ones
this time around to enjoy vocifer
ous crowd support.
"Tennessee's really an excel
lent team," VanDerveer said.
"They're good fundamentally, and
they have great coaches.
"It's still real early. I think it is
a good place for us to start, to get
it out of our system."
Card notes
Needing an extra body for practice
Monday, VanDerveer got a pretty good
sub — graduated Player of the Year
Jennifer Azzi. Unfortunately, Azzi
will be in the announcing booth on
Sunday instead of wearing cardinal
and white.
Whiting returned to practice on
Monday, and the coaches will play
"wait and see" with her condition.
The Cardinal's national television
appearance will be its fourth straight,
stretching back to the Regional Finals
last season. Stanford has a 5-2 record
on national TV
The Cardinal's brutal schedule
contains 11 games against AP Top 25
teams, including a possible rematch
with Tennessee in the Super Shootout
tournament Dec. 29-30.
VanDerveer owns one other head
coaching victory over Tennessee, a
double-overtime victory at Ohio State
which Stanford assistant coaches
Amy Tucker and Julie Plank both
played in.

Freshman Christy Hedgpeth has the tentative nod
to start at guard against the revenge-hungry
Tennessee Volunteers this Sunday.
