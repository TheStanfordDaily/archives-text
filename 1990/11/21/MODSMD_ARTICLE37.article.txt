# Men face little or no competition in Stanford Invitational
## 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
As the Stanford men's basket
ball team opens its regular season
this weekend in the inaugural
Stanford Invitational, respected
bookies everywhere are working
overtime to handle the action.
Here's the current line on:
(1) The Cardinal not winning
the tournament: 50-1.
(2) Rider and the winner of the
St. Mary's-Yaie game staying
within 20 points of Stanford: 10-1.
(3) The Cardinal breaking a
scoring record or six: 3-1.
Get in on the action while you
can, because it looks to be a wild
weekend in Maples Pavilion. For,
while the Cardinal is a heavy
favorite to waltz through the tour
ney, they should probably make it
interesting by continuing to do
what they did in the preseason:
run, run and run a little more.
"I told the guys that if we play

defense, we'll run every time,"
Stanford coach Mike Montgomery
said after the Cardinal's 101-85
thumping of High Five America
last Friday. "We had 36 points off
fast breaks on Tuesday (against
the Illawarra Hawks), and I can't
remember when we've scored that
many.
"If we play good defense, we'll
get lots of fast breaks — and
that's where Marcus really helps
us. He picks everyone up coming
off the bench."
That would be sophomore
guard Marcus Lollie, who has
entered each of the team's presea
son games, shifted the Cardinal's
gear to "burn," and helped the
team bury its opponents. When
Lollie comes in, look for everyone
to get just a step or two faster.
Of course, in those two games
the Cardinal was cruising by
teams that weren't exactly Divi
sion I caliber, and that will change
this weekend. A little. Of the three

The Broncs do have five starters returning,
including sophomore guard Darrick Suber
and senior forward Jim Cleveland, but the
Cardinal should have no trouble at all reach
ing the title game Saturday night.

visiting teams, only Yale had a
winning record last season at 19-
7, 10-4 in the Ivy League. As for
the other teams...
For those of you who know
absolutely nothing about Rider
College, it's located in
Lawrenceville, New Jersey, its
baseball team made the NCAA
playoffs in 1989 (the only year in
the last decade Stanford wasn't
invited) and its men's hoops team
went 10-18 last season.
The Broncs do have five
starters returning, including
sophomore guard Darrick Suber
(13 points per game) and senior

forward Jim Cleveland (11.5 ppg.,
5.3 rebounds per game), but the
Cardinal should have no trouble
at all reaching the title game Sat
urday night.
In that game, Stanford will face
either a Yale squad that finished
second in the Ivy League last year
(and is picked to do the same in
1990-91) or a St. Mary's team that
has only two starters back from
last year's 7-20 squad. Yale's
record last season was its best
since 1949, and the Bulldogs have
everybody back, including All-Ivy
forward Dean Campbell (14.8 ppg.
5.9 rpg.). St. Mary's, who finished

seventh in the West Coast Confer
ence in 1990, is most likely headed
for another rebuilding season.
Card notes
Montgomery announced the sign
ing of two more recruits this week:
Bart Lammersen, a 6-9 center, and
Andy Poppink, a 6-7 swingman, will
both attend Stanford next year. Lam
mersen averaged 16 points, 14(f)

rebounds and five blocks per game
during his junior year at James Madi
son High in Vienna, Va. Poppink aver
aged 15 points, eight rebounds and six
assists per game at Tecumseh (Mich.)
High, where he led his team to a 23-3
record and the Btate quarterfinals his
junior year.

including sophomore guard Darrick Suber
and senior forward Jim Cleveland, but the
Cardinal should have no trouble at all reach
ing the title game Saturday night.

visiting teams, only Yale had a
winning record last season at 19-
7, 10-4 in the Ivy League. As for
the other teams...
For those of you who know
absolutely nothing about Rider
College, it's located in
Lawrenceville, New Jersey, its
baseball team made the NCAA
playoffs in 1989 (the only year in
the last decade Stanford wasn't
invited) and its men's hoops team
went 10-18 last season.
The Broncs do have five
starters returning, including
sophomore guard Darrick Suber
(13 points per game) and senior

forward Jim Cleveland (11.5 ppg.,
5.3 rebounds per game), but the
Cardinal should have no trouble
at all reaching the title game Sat
urday night.
In that game, Stanford will face
either a Yale squad that finished
second in the Ivy League last year
(and is picked to do the same in
1990-91) or a St. Mary's team that
has only two starters back from
last year's 7-20 squad. Yale's
record last season was its best
since 1949, and the Bulldogs have
everybody back, including All-Ivy
forward Dean Campbell (14.8 ppg.
5.9 rpg.). St. Mary's, who finished

seventh in the West Coast Confer
ence in 1990, is most likely headed
for another rebuilding season.
