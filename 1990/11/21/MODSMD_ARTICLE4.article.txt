# Registrar will cut class list sign-ups
## 
### Peter Cousins 
In an effort to reduce spending,
the Registrar's Office will not hold
class list sign-ups for the next year
and a half, requiring individual
departments to hold their own
registrations.
Beginning winter quarter, stu
dents will have to sign separate
class lists for each department
instead of being able to register
for courses by computer.
Although many departments
have held their own registration
for some time, others are con
cerned that they will have diffi
culty handling the added responsi
bility.
Asst. Registrar Joy Parker
described the new system as a
"cost-cutting proposal." She scud
the reversion to the manual,
decentralized class list sign-ups
will eliminate unnecessary class
list signing.
Parker noted the change is only
temporary, as the University still
intends to fully computerize
course registration and allow stu
dents direct access to it. Sign-ups
that will now be decentralized will
return to the computerized sys
tem when it is finished in about a
year and a half, Parker added.
Many of the sign-ups under the
old system were unnecessary
because they were for classes that
did not have size limits, Parker
said. The University could easily
eliminate about one-half of the
class list sign-ups without affect
ing how departments function,
she noted.
Departments needing class

Sign-ups can still require them,
but they must now hold them on
their own. Parker said she
"doesn't think [the new system]
will inconvenience students."
In addition, because fewer
classes will require pre-registra
tion, students will find class list
signing "much easier," she added.
However, Parker said eliminating
sign-ups might increase some
class sizes.
The change will have varying
effects on individual departments.
Mathematics Department Aca
demic Secretary Sara MacGilvra
called the new policy a "really
poor idea." She said she believes
that computerized sign-ups were a
"key service that shouldn't have
been taken away" and that the
new system will prove to be "very
inconvenient" for students.
MacGilvra said the shift of
responsibility of class sign-ups
from the central offices will result
in more pressure on individual
departments. When asked how
the department would react, she
responded, "We don't have the
manpower."
Because of the new policy, there
will be no sign-ups for classes in
the Mathematics Department
winter quarter. MacGilvra said
that in a typical quarter 2,000 stu
dents take math classes and that
1,000 of these are in classes which
previously required them to sign
class lists.
She said she expects that stu
dents will have to be "very flexible
in schedules" to respond to the
