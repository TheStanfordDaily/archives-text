# Draft alcohol policy gets little reaction
## 
### 
Thanksgiving break and
scheduling conflicts resulted in
only a handful of people
responding to the draft version
of the implementation plan for
Stanford's new alcohol policy
this week.
Sponsored by the Office of
Residential Education, two
open forums were scheduled
for this week — Monday in Oak
Lounge East of Tresidder
Union and Tuesday in Kresge
Auditorium — to give people an
opportunity to voice their opin
ions on the Controlled
Substances and Alcohol Policy
draft.
According to Asst. Dean of
Residential Education Ann
Porteus, only two people
showed up on Monday, and two
resident assistants, one resi
dent fellow and one residence

dean came on Tuesday.
"I'm not surprised at the
low turnout, Porteus said. She
attributed it to several factors,
including the approaching
Thanksgiving break and end of
the quarter. She added that
either people are "tired of the
issue" or believe "the way the
[draft] ended up being written
was pretty satisfying.
The only recommendation
made was that the suggested
guidelines attached at the end
of the policy be made separate
from it, so they would not be
perceived as part of the policy,
according to Porteus.
As for the policy itself,
Porteus said no one recom
mended any specific changes to
the policy.
