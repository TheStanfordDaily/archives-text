# Officials will carve turkey before budget

Details of the University's lat
est budget woes won't be released
until after the Thanksgiving
break.
Provost James Rosse "warned"
the Faculty Senate two weeks ago
of an impending shortfall in this
year's operating budget. He had
been expected to reveal the extent
of the shortfall and the resulting
budget adjustments no later than
today.
However, "we just haven't had
a chance to get our business
done," explained Richard Kur
ovsky of the public affairs office.
Although Rosse has not made
public the size of the projected
shortfall, it appears to be more
than $5 million. That number is
based on known and estimated
figures in the three areas Rosse
has identified as sources of the
shortfall:
• Lowor-than-expected re

search volume, resulting in lower
indirect cost recovery;
• A provisional indirect cost
rate of 74 percent established for
the duration of the federal investi
gations of indirect cost policies
here (Stanford had proposed a
rate of 78 percent); and
• A drop in the payout rate on
the expendable funds pool, which
are non-endowment investments.
Stanford is currently in the
process of cutting $22 million
from its operating budget over
two years — what the administra
tion refers to as "repositioning."
Of the $22 million reduction,
$7 million was targeted for this
year's budget, with the remainder
to be cut from next year's operat
ing expenses.
The projected shortfall in this
year's operating budget will likely
prompt additional cuts.
The University's 1990-91 oper
ating budget is slightly more than
$400 million.
