# Water main floods El Camino
## 
### Miranda Doyle Staff writer 
A broken water main in Menlo
Park yesterday flooded parts of El
Camino Real, interrupted the
water supply to hundreds of
homes and caused Stanford Hos
pital to begin losing water pres
sure.
The break occurred around 4
p.m. in the 100 block of El Camino
Real, near the Stanford Park
Hotel.
"A huge amount of water was
spilled," said Estela Guerrero, a
records clerk at the Menlo Park
Police Department. "The water
was four feet deep on El Camino,"
she added.

Water to houses in Menlo Park
and parts of Palo Alto was shut ofT
by the San Francisco Water
Department after the break
occurred. It was not known last
night how long water service
would remain off.
According to Spyros Andre
opoulos, director of the Stanford
Medical Center news bureau, the
hospital began losing water pres
sure at 3:55 p.m.
The hospital put its contin-'
gency plan into effect immedi
ately, and officials said they
expected the hospital to regain full
pressure within a few hours after
the break occurred.
The hospital has a supply of
sterile water and ordered extra

drinking water to make sure they
would have enough to last until
the switch could be made.
After getting permission from
the City of Palo Alto at about 5
p.m., the hospital switched to the
Medical School's water supply,
which comes from Hetch Hetchy,
Andreopoulos said.
"Things are stable. The contin
gency plans have worked," he
said. "In the mean time, there is
no emergency."
The rest of Stanford campus
was not affected because its water
comes from the Hetch Hetchy
Reservoir, near Yosemite National
Park, rather than the Palo Alto
water supply.
