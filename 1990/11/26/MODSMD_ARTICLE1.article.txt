# ASSU attracting more freshman involvement
## 
### David Bianco Editorial staff 
For many freshmen, the ASSU means
little more than fee refunds, lecture notes
asd Sunday Flicks passes.
; But a growing number are taking a
much more active role in the ASSU — as
dorm representatives, senate associates,
senate interns and other workers.
"I think it's a really good idea for fresh
men to get involved because through partic
ipation in the ASSU you get a really good
idea of what's going on on campus," said
Ann Marie Downey, the head dorm repre
sentative for Wilbur Hall.
Downey, one of only three freshmen who
participated in the Council of Presidents
coordinated Leadership Summit earlier
this month, said freshmen who involve
themselves in student government "get a
frame of reference to work from for the rest
of your stay here."
Dorm representatives
Roughly half of the 70 dorm representa
tives are freshmen, according to sophomore
A.R. Jones, coordinator of the program.
Dorm representatives are elected or
appointed from most undergraduate resi
dences and meet weekly in small groups
from a particular area, such as Branner
Hall or Governor's Corner. All of these
areas select head representatives, who meet
weekly together with senators and COP
members.
The representatives, whom COP mem
ber Jay Tucker called "the foot soldiers of
the ASSU," are responsible for bringing
general student opinion to ASSU leaders.
. Freshman Julie Wiggins, a dorm repre
sentative from Rinconada, said she likes
being able to communicate the ideas of her
fellow freshmen to senators and COP mem
bers. Wiggins said her dorm has a positive
attitude toward the ASSU but admitted
that dorm representatives have no real
power.
"I would like to be able to do more," she

said. "But I feel being the communicator is
important. I'm making sure my friends'
ideas in my dorm at least get heard."
Jones said becoming a dorm representa
tive is "a great way to get involved with the
ASSU when you're first coming to Stan
ford." He said dorm representatives are
working on both campuswide projects and
dorm-speciilc initiatives.
In recent campuswide projects, dorm
representatives helped gauge student opin
ion by coordinating the ASSU poll taken
earlier this month.
Dorm representatives have also worked
on dorm-specific projects such as obtaining
more secure bicycle racks in front of Flo
rence Moore Hall and recycling fliers found
on dining area tables.
One major initiative of the dorm repre
sentatives program is a biquarterly ASSU
newsletter, to begin early next quarter.
Freshman Ying Ying Goh, a Stern Hall head
representative, said the newsletter has two
purposes — to let students know about the
ASSU's projects and activities and to
inform the various parts of the ASSU about
each other's activities.
The Stern dorm representatives sug
gested the newsletter and are currently
working to produce it with other students
throughout the campus.
Jones said the dorm representatives pro
gram is a way for freshmen to learn about
the resources of the ASSU as well as to try
to improve it."I hope all the freshmen will
look for ways to make the ASSU what they
want it to be," he said.
Senate associates
Seven members of this year's freshman
class have found another way to get
involved in the ASSU — as senate associ
ates.
Senate associates represent students
who could not vote in the previous spring's
election — first-year graduate students,
transfer students and freshmen. The asso
ciates, who were selected by a committee of
undergraduate senators, serve on
committees, draft bills and partic
ipate in senate debate — basically
all the rights of senators, except
one.
"I can't vote, since I was not
voted in," said Jekit Lam, a fresh
man senate associate who is also
the president of Gavilan. "[But]
according to the bylaws, I'm a sen
ator."
Lam said one of his goals as a
senate associate is to obtain more
financial aid for middle income
students.
He said the prevailing mental
ity among his fellow students is
that the ASSU is slow and has
"very little real power." But he
disagreed with that contention,
saying, "The ASSU can do a lot if
we get everyone going in the same
direction."
More than 50 freshmen applied
to be senate associates this year,
and according to Senate Chair
Solina Kwan, they exhibited "an
incredible amount of talent."
Nawwar Kasrawi, another
freshman senate associate, has
attended two senate meetings this
year. "They ranged from funny to
ridiculous to serious," he said.
Kasrawi, who attended high
school in England, said his previ
ous school "didn't have student
government on the American
model."
He said he has begun to learn
the rules of parliamentary proce
dure. "Our senate meetings are
really interesting," Kasrawi said.
He said the senate associates were

"pretty quiet" during the first
senate meeting they attended, but
have begun to participate more
fully.
For example, Kasrawi said he
helped write a bill earlier this
month which opposed the Depart
ment of Athletics' suspension of
the Stanford Band.
Kasrawi added he would like to
run for a full senator position in
the spring.
Other opportunities
In addition to being dorm rep
resentatives or senate associates,
some freshmen have found other
ways to get involved in the ASSU.
Greg Gilchrest, who was one of
more than 40 unsuccessful fresh
man applicants to be a senate
associate, has found his niche as a
senate intern.
The senate interns are new
positions created this year to
allow more students to work with
the ASSU. The interns work with
various senate committees or the
senate chair but are not consid
ered senators.
Gilchrest said he and several
other freshmen objected to last
week's senate bill opposing an
unprovoked U.S. offensive in the
Persian Gulf. "A lot of freshmen
don't think that's appropriate for
the student government to be say
ing that," he said.
But he said he thinks his class
has a better attitude toward the
ASSU than other classes. "Either
they don't know much about it or
they think it's a good thing to
have an involved student govern
ment," he said.
The ASSU also offers several
paid positions. Freshman Travis

Katz holds one of these positions
as a COP assistant. Katz's posi
tion involves returning letters
from other student governments,
keeping clips of news articles
about the ASSU and working on
COP projects such as a discount
card fund raiser, the Leadership
Summit and the ASSU poll.
Katz works approximately 10
hours per week, and he said the
student leaders treat him very
well. "It's the best of both
worlds," he said. "Not only do I
get to be on top of things and
know what's going on, but I also
get paid for it."
Many of the freshmen getting
involved said they were leaders of
their student governments in
high school. And that means a
msgor shift in thinking for many
freshmen, said senate chair
Kwan.
"The transition between high
school student government and
college student government is
quite a leap," Kwan said. "I think
high school is more social, and
when we come to college, we're
thrust into the real world.
"I like to think that the issues
we pursue have more direct
impact on our lives than the focus
of issues on the high school level."
Kwan said this year's fresh
man class has "a more positive
attitude about the ASSU's ability
to work on issues" than previous
classes.
"I think they see the structure
for them to give and benefit from
the Stanford community," she
said. "I'm sure that the experi
ences that they encounter, the
changes they create and the ideas
that they pursue will be very ful
filling."

idea of what's going on on campus," said
Ann Marie Downey, the head dorm repre
sentative for Wilbur Hall.
Downey, one of only three freshmen who
participated in the Council of Presidents
coordinated Leadership Summit earlier
this month, said freshmen who involve
themselves in student government "get a
frame of reference to work from for the rest
of your stay here."
Dorm representatives
Roughly half of the 70 dorm representa
tives are freshmen, according to sophomore
A.R. Jones, coordinator of the program.
Dorm representatives are elected or
appointed from most undergraduate resi
dences and meet weekly in small groups
from a particular area, such as Branner
Hall or Governor's Corner. All of these
areas select head representatives, who meet
weekly together with senators and COP
members.
The representatives, whom COP mem
ber Jay Tucker called "the foot soldiers of
the ASSU," are responsible for bringing
general student opinion to ASSU leaders.
. Freshman Julie Wiggins, a dorm repre
sentative from Rinconada, said she likes
being able to communicate the ideas of her
fellow freshmen to senators and COP mem
bers. Wiggins said her dorm has a positive
attitude toward the ASSU but admitted
that dorm representatives have no real
power.
"I would like to be able to do more," she

said. "But I feel being the communicator is
important. I'm making sure my friends'
ideas in my dorm at least get heard."
Jones said becoming a dorm representa
tive is "a great way to get involved with the
ASSU when you're first coming to Stan
ford." He said dorm representatives are
working on both campuswide projects and
dorm-speciilc initiatives.
In recent campuswide projects, dorm
representatives helped gauge student opin
ion by coordinating the ASSU poll taken
earlier this month.
Dorm representatives have also worked
on dorm-specific projects such as obtaining
more secure bicycle racks in front of Flo
rence Moore Hall and recycling fliers found
on dining area tables.
One major initiative of the dorm repre
sentatives program is a biquarterly ASSU
newsletter, to begin early next quarter.
Freshman Ying Ying Goh, a Stern Hall head
representative, said the newsletter has two
purposes — to let students know about the
ASSU's projects and activities and to
inform the various parts of the ASSU about
each other's activities.
The Stern dorm representatives sug
gested the newsletter and are currently
working to produce it with other students
throughout the campus.
Jones said the dorm representatives pro
gram is a way for freshmen to learn about
the resources of the ASSU as well as to try
to improve it."I hope all the freshmen will
look for ways to make the ASSU what they
want it to be," he said.
Senate associates
Seven members of this year's freshman
class have found another way to get
involved in the ASSU — as senate associ
ates.
Senate associates represent students
who could not vote in the previous spring's
election — first-year graduate students,
transfer students and freshmen. The asso
ciates, who were selected by a committee of
undergraduate senators, serve on
committees, draft bills and partic
ipate in senate debate — basically
all the rights of senators, except
one.
"I can't vote, since I was not
voted in," said Jekit Lam, a fresh
man senate associate who is also
the president of Gavilan. "[But]
according to the bylaws, I'm a sen
ator."
Lam said one of his goals as a
senate associate is to obtain more
financial aid for middle income
students.
He said the prevailing mental
ity among his fellow students is
that the ASSU is slow and has
"very little real power." But he
disagreed with that contention,
saying, "The ASSU can do a lot if
we get everyone going in the same
direction."
More than 50 freshmen applied
to be senate associates this year,
and according to Senate Chair
Solina Kwan, they exhibited "an
incredible amount of talent."
Nawwar Kasrawi, another
freshman senate associate, has
attended two senate meetings this
year. "They ranged from funny to
ridiculous to serious," he said.
Kasrawi, who attended high
school in England, said his previ
ous school "didn't have student
government on the American
model."
He said he has begun to learn
the rules of parliamentary proce
dure. "Our senate meetings are
really interesting," Kasrawi said.
He said the senate associates were

"pretty quiet" during the first
senate meeting they attended, but
have begun to participate more
fully.
For example, Kasrawi said he
helped write a bill earlier this
month which opposed the Depart
ment of Athletics' suspension of
the Stanford Band.
Kasrawi added he would like to
run for a full senator position in
the spring.
Other opportunities
In addition to being dorm rep
resentatives or senate associates,
some freshmen have found other
ways to get involved in the ASSU.
Greg Gilchrest, who was one of
more than 40 unsuccessful fresh
man applicants to be a senate
associate, has found his niche as a
senate intern.
The senate interns are new
positions created this year to
allow more students to work with
the ASSU. The interns work with
various senate committees or the
senate chair but are not consid
ered senators.
Gilchrest said he and several
other freshmen objected to last
week's senate bill opposing an
unprovoked U.S. offensive in the
Persian Gulf. "A lot of freshmen
don't think that's appropriate for
the student government to be say
ing that," he said.
But he said he thinks his class
has a better attitude toward the
ASSU than other classes. "Either
they don't know much about it or
they think it's a good thing to
have an involved student govern
ment," he said.
The ASSU also offers several
paid positions. Freshman Travis

Katz holds one of these positions
as a COP assistant. Katz's posi
tion involves returning letters
from other student governments,
keeping clips of news articles
about the ASSU and working on
COP projects such as a discount
card fund raiser, the Leadership
Summit and the ASSU poll.
Katz works approximately 10
hours per week, and he said the
student leaders treat him very
well. "It's the best of both
worlds," he said. "Not only do I
get to be on top of things and
know what's going on, but I also
get paid for it."
Many of the freshmen getting
involved said they were leaders of
their student governments in
high school. And that means a
msgor shift in thinking for many
freshmen, said senate chair
Kwan.
"The transition between high
school student government and
college student government is
quite a leap," Kwan said. "I think
high school is more social, and
when we come to college, we're
thrust into the real world.
"I like to think that the issues
we pursue have more direct
impact on our lives than the focus
of issues on the high school level."
Kwan said this year's fresh
man class has "a more positive
attitude about the ASSU's ability
to work on issues" than previous
classes.
"I think they see the structure
for them to give and benefit from
the Stanford community," she
said. "I'm sure that the experi
ences that they encounter, the
changes they create and the ideas
that they pursue will be very ful
filling."
For many freshmen, the ASSU means
little more than fee refunds, lecture notes
asd Sunday Flicks passes.
; But a growing number are taking a
much more active role in the ASSU — as
dorm representatives, senate associates,
senate interns and other workers.
"I think it's a really good idea for fresh
men to get involved because through partic
ipation in the ASSU you get a really good
idea of what's going on on campus," said
Ann Marie Downey, the head dorm repre
