# ASSU attracting more freshman involvement
## 
### David Bianco Editorial staff 
For many freshmen, the ASSU means
little more than fee refunds, lecture notes
asd Sunday Flicks passes.
; But a growing number are taking a
much more active role in the ASSU — as
dorm representatives, senate associates,
senate interns and other workers.
"I think it's a really good idea for fresh
men to get involved because through partic
ipation in the ASSU you get a really good
idea of what's going on on campus," said
Ann Marie Downey, the head dorm repre
sentative for Wilbur Hall.
Downey, one of only three freshmen who
participated in the Council of Presidents
coordinated Leadership Summit earlier
this month, said freshmen who involve
themselves in student government "get a
frame of reference to work from for the rest
of your stay here."
Dorm representatives
Roughly half of the 70 dorm representa
tives are freshmen, according to sophomore
A.R. Jones, coordinator of the program.
Dorm representatives are elected or
appointed from most undergraduate resi
dences and meet weekly in small groups
from a particular area, such as Branner
Hall or Governor's Corner. All of these
areas select head representatives, who meet
weekly together with senators and COP
members.
The representatives, whom COP mem
ber Jay Tucker called "the foot soldiers of
the ASSU," are responsible for bringing
general student opinion to ASSU leaders.
. Freshman Julie Wiggins, a dorm repre
sentative from Rinconada, said she likes
being able to communicate the ideas of her
fellow freshmen to senators and COP mem
bers. Wiggins said her dorm has a positive
attitude toward the ASSU but admitted
that dorm representatives have no real
power.
"I would like to be able to do more," she

said. "But I feel being the communicator is
important. I'm making sure my friends'
ideas in my dorm at least get heard."
Jones said becoming a dorm representa
tive is "a great way to get involved with the
ASSU when you're first coming to Stan
ford." He said dorm representatives are
working on both campuswide projects and
dorm-speciilc initiatives.
In recent campuswide projects, dorm
representatives helped gauge student opin
ion by coordinating the ASSU poll taken
earlier this month.
Dorm representatives have also worked
on dorm-specific projects such as obtaining
more secure bicycle racks in front of Flo
rence Moore Hall and recycling fliers found
on dining area tables.
One major initiative of the dorm repre
sentatives program is a biquarterly ASSU
newsletter, to begin early next quarter.
Freshman Ying Ying Goh, a Stern Hall head
representative, said the newsletter has two
purposes — to let students know about the
ASSU's projects and activities and to
inform the various parts of the ASSU about
each other's activities.
The Stern dorm representatives sug
gested the newsletter and are currently
working to produce it with other students
throughout the campus.
Jones said the dorm representatives pro
gram is a way for freshmen to learn about
the resources of the ASSU as well as to try
to improve it."I hope all the freshmen will
look for ways to make the ASSU what they
want it to be," he said.
Senate associates
Seven members of this year's freshman
class have found another way to get
involved in the ASSU — as senate associ
ates.
Senate associates represent students
who could not vote in the previous spring's
election — first-year graduate students,
transfer students and freshmen. The asso
ciates, who were selected by a committee of
