# Iraq turns farmers into fighters
## Boxing champ met with Saddam as part of peace mission 
### 
The Bush administration braced for a showdown
in the U.N. Security Council over the use of force in
the Persian Gulf, and Iraq threatened yesterday to
rain missiles on Saudi Arabia if U.S. troops try to
drive its armies out of Kuwait.
The Baghdad government also said it was mobiliz
ing tens of thousands of farmers for military service,
even though it is struggling to increase food produc
tion to offset the effects of U.N. sanctions imposed
after the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
Iraqi authorities, meanwhile, were taking steps to
make sure any shortages caused by the sanctions are
felt in Kuwait, which Iraq calls its 19th province.
The official Iraqi News Agency said food rationing
would begin soon in the conquered emirate.
Iraq continued its piecemeal release of foreign
hostages, but no Americans were among those freed
Sunday. More than 100 German hostages arrived

home after nearly four months of captivity, and 10
Greek nationals landed in Jordan. Iraqi officials also
said 70 Italians would be freed Tuesday.
Dozens of former government leaders and other
dignitaries have traveled to Baghdad to try to win the
release of captive foreigners, even though such pri
vate trips are discouraged by the U.S. government.
The latest such visitor was boxing legend
Muhammad Ali, who met with Saddam Hussein yes
terday at the presidential palace. An Ali associate,
Arthur Morrison, said the former world heavyweight
champion was on a "goodwill mission" and hoped to
free some Americans.
Morrison spoke to reporters on behalf of Ali, who
is suffering from Parkinson's disease and cannot
speak.
