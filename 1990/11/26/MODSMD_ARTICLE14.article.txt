## Class list screw-ups 
### 
Only major savings
could outweigh extra
burdens on students

TE: The Registrar's
Office, effective winter
JL quarter, no longer han
dles class list sign-ups," we learn in
the new Time Schedule.
Uh-oh.
Welcome to the Signet Time
Schedule, now with more footnotes
than one of Shakespeare's plays.
If you're planning to take Psy
chology 1, you'll have to go to the
back lobby of Building 420, but you
will not have to sign up in alpha
betical order.
If you want to take Introductory
Piano (Music 12), you'll have to go
to Braun 101, and you'll need to
follow the alphabetical class-list
signing schedule.
Of course, you won't find that
alphabetical listing in the Time
Schedule; you'll have to pick up
last Monday's Daily. Apparently,
the Registrar's Office really is
strapped for money; it couldn't
afford the ink necessary to provide
the alphabetical listing in the Time
Schedule.
Perhaps you want to take a golf
class. According to another foot
note, you'll have to follow the
Department of Athletics' "revised
alphabetical listing."
There seems to be a trend here.
Reduced spending by the Regis
trar's Office is going to translate
into confusion and inconvenience,

if not chaos.
The burden of registering stu
dents for classes whose enroll
ments are limited has now been
shifted to individual academic
departments. The prospects for a
smooth week of sign-ups are slim.
Some departments, like the Psy
chology Department, have
responded to their new task by
ignoring the alphabetical schedule.
Popular courses in such
departments may duplicate the
scene in front of the Creative Writ
ing program office, where students
sleep out to get into Fiction Writ
ing.
Or, the increase in competition
for classes might bring out the less
than-honest sides of people, as
names are conveniently crossed off
departments' ad-hoc sign-up lists.
Other departments, such as the
Mathematics Department, have
responded quite differently, simply
eliminating all class sign-ups.
As a result, either math classes
are going to balloon in size, or a lot
of students will be not-so-pleas
antly surprised come Jan. 7, when
they have been bumped like a pas
senger on an overbooked flight.
Moreover, because the various
departments are handling sign-ups
differently, a certain amount of
unfairness is introduced into the
registration process.
We hope the Registrar's Office
will save a lot of money with its
"cost-cutting proposal," as Asst.
Registrar Joy Parker described it.
Because only a significant reduc
tion in expenses could justify the
resulting costs to students and
departments.
