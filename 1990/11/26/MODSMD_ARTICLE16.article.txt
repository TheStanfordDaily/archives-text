## Stop stereotyping SLE 
### 
AS I WAS TRYING to figure out
which Cultures, Ideas and Values
track to sign up for, my first
impulse was to eliminate Structured Lib
eral Education from consideration.
Though I was intrigued by the course
description, it just sounded like too much
work.
Upon further reflection, however, I
decided that as long as I had to take CIV I
might as well get all I can out of it.
Little did I know at the time, but when
I signed up for SLE I wasn't just selecting
a CIV track. I was assigning myself to a
set of stereotypes.
Whenever I tell anyone that I live in
Florence Moore Hall, the immediate,
seemingly automatic response is a wary,
"Are you in SLE?" — as though the
answer would be a sure indicator of my
character.
When I reply in the affirmative, the
person will usually smile knowingly,
thinking, "A-ha, she's one of those. I
guess I won't be seeing much of her. She'll
be holed up in her room reading Plato and
writing her papers."
SLE is the only CIV track I know of
that elicits this sort of response. You don't
see anyone going around pointing out
people in the philosophy track, for
instance.
In a typical example of SLE-bashing,
some guy walks behind my dorm every
weekend yelling, "SLE sucks, SLE
sucks!"
How profound, and so eloquently
expressed, too. The boy has obviously
been spared the curse of being well-spo
ken.

I wonder what kind of person has
nothing better to do on Friday or Satur
day nights than holler about the unwor
thiness of a CIV track in monosyllabic
terms. One might be led to believe that
this fool's social life is worse than even
that of the stereotypical SLE student.
Then there was that article in The
Stanford Review that stated something to
the effect that if Stanford admitted any
more intellectuals, all the dorms would be
as dull as SLE dorms.
Well, that was the last straw. I'm sick
of hearing and reading all this nonsense
about SLE. It's just like any other CIV
track, only better.
To dispel the biggest misconception
about SLE, let me first say that the lives
of the students enrolled do not revolve
around it.
The workload is not nearly as large as
one might be led to believe. Literature
and the Arts, for instance, requires a lot
more work than SLE, but it seems to get
a lot less notoriety.
Other than the time Plato's "Repub
lic" had to be read in one week, the read
ing hasn't been that much of a strain, and
this quarter we just have to write four
three-page papers. It's a fair amount of
work, but definitely manageable.
Non-SLE people make a big deal about
how much time we spend in lectures and
discussions. But the lectures provide an
opportunity to listen and learn from a
variety of professors. Some of them can
actually make you enthusiastic about
seemingly dry readings.
As for the discussions, they provide the
only opportunity I have to interact with a

real professor on a regular basis. I can't
really do that in any of my other classes.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we re supposed to
seek out our professors — as though it
would be realistic for my chemistry
instructor to see all 400 of the students
enrolled in his class to see him individu
ally.
I get a one-on-one session with my sec
tion leader after each paper to discuss my
writing. Input, feedback. My, what a revo
lutionary concept. It's such a burden to
talk to a professor about how to improve
my writing skills. That guy was right:
SLE really sucks.
Non-SLE people also make an issue
out of the fact that the program is resi*
dence-based. You juat can't imagine what
a drag it is living with intelligent people
you can have fascinating conversations
about all sorts of things with.
The way I see it, I'm very lucky to be
living in a SLE dorm. From what I've
been hearing, it is one of the best inte
grated dorms on campus in terms of gen
der, culture, ethnicity, even economic
standing.
If you don't believe all the good things
I've said about SLE, come visit a SLE
dorm sometime.
But please, no SLE cracks until you
know what you're talking about.

character.
When I reply in the affirmative, the
person will usually smile knowingly,
thinking, "A-ha, she's one of those. I
guess I won't be seeing much of her. She'll
be holed up in her room reading Plato and
writing her papers."
SLE is the only CIV track I know of
that elicits this sort of response. You don't
see anyone going around pointing out
people in the philosophy track, for
instance.
In a typical example of SLE-bashing,
some guy walks behind my dorm every
weekend yelling, "SLE sucks, SLE
sucks!"
How profound, and so eloquently
expressed, too. The boy has obviously
been spared the curse of being well-spo
ken.

I wonder what kind of person has
nothing better to do on Friday or Satur
day nights than holler about the unwor
thiness of a CIV track in monosyllabic
terms. One might be led to believe that
this fool's social life is worse than even
that of the stereotypical SLE student.
Then there was that article in The
Stanford Review that stated something to
the effect that if Stanford admitted any
more intellectuals, all the dorms would be
as dull as SLE dorms.
Well, that was the last straw. I'm sick
of hearing and reading all this nonsense
about SLE. It's just like any other CIV
track, only better.
To dispel the biggest misconception
about SLE, let me first say that the lives
of the students enrolled do not revolve
around it.
The workload is not nearly as large as
one might be led to believe. Literature
and the Arts, for instance, requires a lot
more work than SLE, but it seems to get
a lot less notoriety.
Other than the time Plato's "Repub
lic" had to be read in one week, the read
ing hasn't been that much of a strain, and
this quarter we just have to write four
three-page papers. It's a fair amount of
work, but definitely manageable.
Non-SLE people make a big deal about
how much time we spend in lectures and
discussions. But the lectures provide an
opportunity to listen and learn from a
variety of professors. Some of them can
actually make you enthusiastic about
seemingly dry readings.
As for the discussions, they provide the
only opportunity I have to interact with a

real professor on a regular basis. I can't
really do that in any of my other classes.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we re supposed to
seek out our professors — as though it
would be realistic for my chemistry
instructor to see all 400 of the students
enrolled in his class to see him individu
ally.
I get a one-on-one session with my sec
tion leader after each paper to discuss my
writing. Input, feedback. My, what a revo
lutionary concept. It's such a burden to
talk to a professor about how to improve
my writing skills. That guy was right:
SLE really sucks.
Non-SLE people also make an issue
out of the fact that the program is resi*
dence-based. You juat can't imagine what
a drag it is living with intelligent people
you can have fascinating conversations
about all sorts of things with.
The way I see it, I'm very lucky to be
living in a SLE dorm. From what I've
been hearing, it is one of the best inte
grated dorms on campus in terms of gen
der, culture, ethnicity, even economic
standing.
If you don't believe all the good things
I've said about SLE, come visit a SLE
dorm sometime.
But please, no SLE cracks until you
know what you're talking about.
