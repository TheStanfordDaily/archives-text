## New breed of bureaucrats made horrible Tours decision 
### 
THE FRENCH DEPARTMENT
voted unanimously to keep the
Overseas Program in Tours,
though we are usually split four or five
ways on most issues.
The bunch has cumulatively spent
hundreds of years in that country and
devoted their professional lives to teach
ing its literature, art, ideas. Personally, I
have taught four overseas stints there,
two at Tours. It is hard for me to imag
ine a better setup for our students.
The staff is simply superb and has
had more than 30 years of experience
dealing with our American youngsters
who — practically all 5,000 who went
there — said they loved it.
The handsome old building is near
everything important. The city is charm
ing and full of history, as is the Loire Val
ley nearby. The mayor bought the build
ing to keep the rent low. Locating fami
lies to take the students in was a neigh

borly personal affair. The place consid
ered us a part of it (that isn't easy in
France).
A whole floor of the building was a
library, built up over 30 years just for
our students' needs (multiple volumes of
mqjor writers for coursework, books in
English, dictionaries, etc.) A librarian
worked there half-time.
Most universities have sent their kids
to provincial places like that because it
eases them into the scene. They are
more authentically French (the language
spoken at Tours is the purest French
anywhere; the air too is pure; don't ask
about Paris...). The "smiling" country
side is all around. And you can get to
Paris in an hour or two.
What about Paris? Everyone knows
about its marvels, but why do a strong
majority of Parisians want to live else
where? Congestion, traffic, impossible
parking, pollution, crime, rudeness. It is

no longer very French.
Hundreds of thousands of students
from everywhere crowd there and are
not very welcome. Their universities and
institutes have a very different approach
(calendar, style, level) and are not meant
for our kids at all.
Few really profit from those big
classes taught at breakneck speed for
eager natives in their local terms. With
the falling dollar and the rising prices,
Stanford money will simply evaporate in
the big city (That's not "big savings").
Whereas we had a whole elegant
building in Tours, in Paris we will be
attached to the Ecole Superieure de
Commerce in an unprepossessing part of
town. The Ecole, I am told, is eager to
get some prestige from the name of
Stanford and so has offered the use of
some classrooms and the library.
I'd be curious to see those classrooms;
modern style in France is generally plas

tic, tacky. I doubt our students will find
the library very congenial either. Instead
of being taught in French, they will be
taught mostly in English by French
teachers of unknown caliber. Who will
replace Claude Doubinsky, the finest aca
demic I have ever met? Anne Durand, a
strong, noble, caring person? Francoise
Perdoux, an incomparable teacher?
And what has commerce got to do
with most of our students, at least dur
ing the years when they are supposed to
be getting a liberal education?
But what do such humbly concrete,
human considerations mean to the new
breed of administrators who are trying
to convert what was once a cultural pro
gram into an instrument of "interna
tional technocracy" (Prof. Keith Baker's
term for what was happening to our
French campus)?
