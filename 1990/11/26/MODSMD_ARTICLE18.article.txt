# U.S. should lower its oil consumption, not wage Gulf war
## 
### 
I am participating in the Peace Fast at
Stanford because I believe that fasting is
one of the strongest possible statements
I can make of my fear and anger about
our seeming approach to war in the Mid
dle East.
While I strongly condemn the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait and support the pres
ence of United Nations troops in Saudi
Arabia, I feel even more strongly that it
is not the role of the United States to
attempt to liberate Kuwait militarily.
The United States has been one of the
largest violators of national sovereignty
and international law in recent history,
and our attempting to claim the moral
high ground in this instance is the

height of hypocrisy.
I believe the real reasons President
Bush is so eager to threaten war are that
he wishes to continue to assert the right
of the United States to be the global
policeman, to maintain high military
spending at a time when the end of the
Cold War has eliminated its mcgor justifi
cation and to distract us from the critical
problems facing us at home.
I do not personally believe that the
price of oil is really a mcgor concern,
since U.S. military intervention in the
Gulf has driven it up more than Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait would have by itself;
moreover, if the United States launches a
war, the price of oil will reach a ievei far
beyond what we have seen to date.
In 1980, when I was 18, President
Carter and the Congress asked me to
register for the draft and to be prepared
to fight in the Middle East to protect
"our" oil. I was so outraged by that idea
that I made the decision to refuse to reg-

We should not be fighting to preserve the 'American
Way of Life;' we should be fighting to change it to one
that is sustainable.

ister for the draft.
Now, 10 years later, when George
Bush is about to live up to Carter's
threats, I stand by my decision.
Although I do not wish to make those
who have volunteered for the military,
frequently low-income people and people
of color with few options for employ
ment, the victims in whatever conflict
may take place, I still believe that refus
ing to register and refusing to serve if
drafted for this war is the proper course.
I still remember a speech given by a
draft registration resister named Will
Barnes at a rally at Stanford in 1980, in
which he pointed out that the United

States consumes nearly a third of the
world's resources though it has only 5
percent of the population.
If we limited ourselves to our share,
we would not need to fight in the Gulf,
or in so many other places in the world
where U.S. access to resources remains a
key issue.
We should not be fighting to preserve
the "American Way of Life; we should
be fighting to change it to one that is
sustainable. The fate of all the peoples of
this planet, and of the planet itself,
depends on us changing our ways.
