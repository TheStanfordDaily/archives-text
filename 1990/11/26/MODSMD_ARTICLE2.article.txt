# Reporter was 'steps from prison'

Five vears ago, Leonid
Zagalsky's chief editor fired
him on the spot after receiving
a call from the KGB, the Soviet
secret police and intelligence
agency, which accused Zagal
sky of "contact with foreign
ers," taboo for journalists in
the Soviet Union.
Today, Zagalsky is at Stan
ford on a Knight Fellowship, a
one-year educational sabbati
cal for outstanding mid-career
journalists. He is a special cor
respondent for the progressive
Soviet newspaper Literatur
naya Gazeta and has become
one of his country's most
respected journalists.
Slim, with glasses, dark hair
and faded blue jeans, this out
going 35-year-old could pass
for a student, down to the $15
Centurion bike that he doesn't
lock up "because nobody will
want to steal it."
Zagalsky thrives on social
interaction. "Our first week
here the phone didn't ring, and
it was a tragedy for him," said
Natasha Zagalsky, his wife.
"Now we get calls all the time,
and he's happy."
But Zagalsky's easygoing
manner hides a keen nose for
news — and a determination to
track it down. He said he is not
averse to paying sources or giv
ing them "favors," he said.
"The real information is very
expensive," he explained.
For example, one important
Soviet official was notorious
for not talking to journalists,
Zagalsky said.
"I found out that he had a
special liking for galoshes that

... He spoke to me," Zagalsky
said.
According to Zagalsky, journal
ism "is not a profession, it's a way
of life." He started at age 14,
when a friend dared him to get
something printed in a Moscow
newspaper, for a one ruble
reward. His first story was about
children's quarrels at school —
"the only one thing you can write
about when you are 14," he said.
Before writing it, he consulted
journalists at the paper, who told
him, "Don't insult anyone."
He did.
The next morning, he faced a
furious principal who accused
him of slandering teachers and
letting down the school. Zagalsky
retaliated in print with a story
critical of the principal.
This streak of rebellion fol
lowed Zagalsky to college, where
he failed a compulsory "Science
Communism" course 12 times,

under a professor who wanted
dissident authors like Alexander
Solzhenitsyn shot. He finally
passed it under another professor.
"I had to [pass]. Because if you
are [expelled] from the university,
you have to go to the army," he
said.
In later years, his boldness got
him into trouble with authorities
more powerful than irate profes
sors. He was reluctant to discuss
in detail his encounters with the
KGB because he was "five steps
from prison," he said.
Natasha Zagalsky, also a jour
nalist, flinches at the memory of
her husband's summons to KGB
headquarters. She described
briefly the sleepless nights and
the worry about their 4-year old
son. "Our lives were completely
overturned," she said.
The coming of glasnost in 1987
brought a turn fcr the better for
both Zagalsky and the Soviet
press. Zagalsky got a job at
Gazeta, where he soon became
special correspondent to the chief
editor. And the Soviet press won
new freedom.
With fewer constraints, Soviet
newspapers — from the conserva
tive Pravda magazine to the pro

gressive Moscow News — "began
to discover their own identities"
for the first time, Zagalsky said.
He said this shift away from
transcribed speeches and official
dictates means that "now journal
ists have to write. And they don't
know how." He estimated that
only about 20 percent of his
paper's staff still write, with the
others now doing sorting, transla
tion and technical work.
But Zagalsky remains guarded
in what he says about glasnost.
He noted that glasnost was not a
democratic decision, but an order
"from the very top of society,
directly from [Soviet President
Mikhail] Gorbachev's office."
"Russians have a joke that
Gorbachev thinks there are two
o{ inions in the country, 'mine'
and 'wrong'," Zagalsky said.
Jagalsky's humor is sharpened
by a sober awareness of the prob
lems the Soviet press still faces,
including such practicalities as a
shortage of newsprint and a lack
of paper and fluid for copiers. In
addition, "The price of a personal
computer is equal to the lifetime
salary of the common journalist,"
he said.
