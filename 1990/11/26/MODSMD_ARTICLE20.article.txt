## Aley El-Shazly While Hussein seems ready to negotiate, Bush is preparing for war 
### 
IN THE PAST FEW DAYS, President
Bush and Secretary Baker have
started beating the drums of war, indi
cating that their patience is wearing thin
with Saddam Hussein, and urging the
whole world and the United Nations to
support an all-out war against Iraq.
All this is happening at a time when
Saddam Hussein is sending some signals,
albeit subtle, of his willingness to with
draw from most of Kuwait and negotiate
a settlement to this crisis.
Saddam's invasion of Kuwait is defi
nitely a crime for which he should not be
rewarded in any way. His brutality
against everyone, including his own peo
ple, should never be forgotten.
However, I fail to understand the rea
sons behind the United States' massive
military buildup in the Gulf, its categori
cal rejection of all chances for a negoti
ated settlement and its preparation for a
war that would be devastating for the
whole world.
President Bush first said the U.S.
troops were sent to the Gulf to defend
Sauai Arabia against a possible Iraqi
invasion. Defending Saudi Arabia does
not require a "pre-emptive" strike against
Iraq. If the United States were really
interested in Saudi security, why have
Congress and the administration persis
tently refused (and continue to do so to
this very minute) the sale of sophisticated
arms to the Saudis?
Nine million Saudi Arabians, with
some help form neighboring Arab coun
tries, should be able to defend their coun
try against Iraq's million-man army with
out the help of American troops, provided

that they had the necessary arsenal.
President Bush argues that the U.S.
troops are there to prevent Saddam from
controlling the oil fields and to protect the
"American way of life." However, if the
United States starts a war, oil prices are
likely to jump to $80 per barrel, and the
"American way of life" will not be pre
served.
Another reason that is frequently
being cited by President Bush for troop
deployment is "preventing naked aggres
sion" and "maintaining world order.
Why didn't the United States send its
troops to Afghanistan when it was
invaded by the Soviet Union in 1979?
Where were the U.S. troops when Israel
invaded Lebanon in 1982? Were these not
acts of "naked aggression"?
As for maintaining world order, how
can the United States police the globe
when it refuses to pay its dues to the
United Nations (a mere $300 million),
but continues to support the Israeli occu
pation of the West Bank, the Gaza Strip,
southern Lebanon, East Jerusalem and
the Golan Heights by an annual $3.3 bil
lion aid package?
Moreover, the United States has
vetoed more than two dozen Security
Council resolutions against Israel, in defi
ance to world order and the other 14
members of the council.
Rather than prepare for a military
invasion of Kuwait and Iraq, the United
States should start negotiating with Sad
dam Hussein. President Bush knows that
Saddam will never withdraw uncondi
tionally from Kuwait.
President Bush should therefore guar

an tee Saddam that the United States will
not attack Iraq once it withdraws its
troops from Kuwait. The United States,
should also offer to replace its troops in
Saudi Arabia by pan-Arab or U.N. forces
simultaneously.
Rather than insist on the return of the
exiled Kuwaiti emir to power, the United
States should urge free elections under
the auspices of the United Nations.
The U.S. administration should make
it clear that once Iraq withdraws from
Kuwait and a Kuwaiti government is
elected, it will not interfere with or pre

vent negotiations between Iraq and
Kuwait over their territorial or financial
disputes. Lifting economic sanctions
against Iraq could then be tied with com
pensating Kuwait for damage incurred
during the Iraqi invasion.
These proposals would be somewhat
face-saving for Saddam Hussein, and
should provide him with an incentive for
withdrawing from Kuwait.
The U.S. administration should also
support French President Mitterand's
proposal for the convening of an interna
tional peace conference to settle the Arab-
Israeli dispute shortly after the Iraqi

withdrawal from Kuwait. Such a confer
ence could also be used to rid the Middle
East of nuclear and chemical weapons.
A more balanced and even-handed pol
icy by the Bush administration toward
the Arab-Israeli conflict will help bring
peace to this area and gain the United
States some credibility as a world leader.
It is unlikely that Saddam will reject
such a plan. His annexation of Kuwait
appears to be a political ploy or bargain
ing chip, as he has dismantled and looted
Kuwait rather than settle Iraqis in the
newly annexed territory (as Israel is
doing in the occupied territories), in an
attempt to "get the most out of this inva
sion."
Moreover, Iraq will find it very difficult
to maintain its army for a long time with
the continued enforcement of the
embargo. On the other hand, if war
breaks out, oil prices will skyrocket, and
industrial nations with fragile economies
may be forced to break the embargo.
Whereas a negotiated settlement may
have the drawback of leaving Saddam as a
temporary hero in the eyes of some Arabs,
it is a cheap price to pay, and is far better
than a devastating war that would make
Saddam an eternal martyr and pave the
way for the appearance of other dictators
like him.
I urge all concerned Americans to
write their representatives in Congress to
urge the president to embark on the road
to negotiations before it is too late.
