## Cal hangs on to beat Cardinal 8-7 in NCAA final Water polo team rallies from four-goal deficit to get within one but has to settle for second-best 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
LONG BEACH, Calif. - Early
last week, Stanford senior Rick
McNair said he and his second
ranked Cardinal water polo team
mates would need to play "a mag
ical game" at the NCAA Champi
onships to beat No. 1 California.
Last night, against Cal in the
NCAA finals at the Belmont Plaza
Olympic Pool, the Cardinal played
that magical game — and found
out even that wasn't good enough.
By surviving a hectic, stressful
find quarter, the Bears captured
their third national title of the last
four years by downing Stanford 8-
7. Cal had held a 7-3 lead early in
the third quarter, but was then
almost completely shut down as
the Cardinal mounted a furious
comeback. The Bears didn't score
at all in the fourth.
"We played a heck of a game,"
Stanford coach Dante Dettamanti
said. "We couldn't have played
much better.... I really feel good.
We had a chance to win it at the
end, or at least tie it."
The win gives Cal a 29-1
record, while the Cardinal finishes
at 26-6 — with five of the six
losses coming at the hands of the
Bears.
The Cardinal had its chances to
tie the game, but couldn't deliver.
With 1:23 left in the fourth quar
ter and the Bears up by a goal, Cal
junior Eriks Krumins was whis
tled for a foul and ejected. The
Cardinal immediately called time
out to set up a play for the 6-on-5
situation, and then tried to work
the ball to McNair, who already
had two goals.
McNair got the ball to the left
of the goal, but was smothered by
a Cal defender. He passed out
front to sophomore J.T.
Matarangas, who fired the ball
and watched it bounce off Cal's
Julian Bailey and fly out of

bounds. Still Stanford's ball. One
minute left.
Greg Olson then took the ball
toward the right corner of the
goal, but was cut off. He passed
out front, the Cardinal worked the
ball around, buying time, looking
for a shot, and then, on a pass to
the middle, a Cal player got a fin
gertip on the ball.
Four players dove toward the
ball, which disappeared under the
waves. When it finally came up
from under the pile, it squirmed
right into the hands of Olson. He
was two feet from the goal, with
only the goalie to beat.
"They put a lot of pressure on
us and kind of broke up our
momentum," Olson said. "Then
there was the scramble, and I just
picked (the ball) up and threw it.
There wasn't time to think."
There was enough time, how
ever, for Cal goalie Jim Wagner to
smack Olson's shot away — right
to a Bear defender. Cal's fans,
thinking the game was over, went
crazy. (If only they'd rushed the
p001....)
Someone apparently forgot to
tell the Cardinal that the game
was over, because while Cal was
celebrating the Stanford players
were setting themselves up for a
last-ditch effort to tie the game.
Cal's Chris Humbert — who'd
scored (only) four goals, a poor
effort for him — was swimming in
front of Stanford's goal with the
ball, trying to run out the clock,
when Olson and goalie Larry
Bercutt stole the ball.
Ten seconds left. Bercutt
passed to senior Chuck Maguy,
who was two-thirds of the way
down the left side of the pool.

Eight seconds. Maguy looked
inside, saw nothing he liked, and
passed to Chip Blankenhorn, who
was directly in front of the goal,
eight meters away.
Six seconds. Blankenhorn
surged up, faked once, fired ...
and watched as the ball skipped
across the water, missed the right
corner of the goal by two feet and
scampered under the stands.
Game and national title, Califor
nia.
"We'd wanted McNair to shoot,
but they were playing him one-on
one," Dettamanti said. "We had
other guys open to shoot, though,
and we did get those three shots in
the last minute or so. We had our
chances to put the ball in: Cal's
goalie just made the saves."
"We had a couple really good
shots," said Maguy, who had one
goal. "We got the ball to Greg in
close, and he got off a good shot,
but their goalie made a great
save."
There was still that final play,
and the Cardinal almost pulled it
off. "We've practiced that situa
tion, when the other team is try
ing to run out the clock," Maguy
said. "Olson got back, and when
he and Larry stole the ball every
thing was perfect. We got the shot
off. .. everything was perfect. We
had the opportunity. We just
couldn't convert."
The Cardinal wouldn't have
had the chance to tie without the
play of Bercutt, who turned in one
of his best performances of the
year. "Larry played a great game,"
Dettamanti said. "Before the
game I left him off my all-tourna
ment team because he'd played
well in goal, but not great. I wish I
could get my ballot back."
"I thought Larry played great,"
Olson agreed.
Indeed he did: Bercutt made 14
saves during the game, five in the

J.T. Matarangas and the Cardinal made a great comeback against top-ranked California in the NCAA
title match last night, outscorlng the Bears 4-1 over the last 11 minutes of the game. It was not
enough, however, and Cal held on for an 8-7 victory In Long Beach last night.
