lt was only the season opener,
but the Tennessee Lady Volun
teers played like it was the NCAA
Final. Venting frustration stem
ming from last season's regional
loss, which forced Tennessee to
watch as Stanford won the
national title on the Lady Vols'
home floor, the No. 6-ranked
squad scrapped and clawed its way
to a vindicating 95-80 victory over
the No. 2 Cardinal.

Lady Vols 95
Cardinal 80

The loss snapped Stanford's
13-game win streak that dated
back to Feb. 10 of last season and
stretched through the Cardinal's
NCAA title drive. It also puts the
Cardinal (0-1) below .500 for the
first time since March 5, 1987,
when the current Stanford play
ers were all in high school.
It was a contest that Stanford
could have won, but cold shooting
streaks and poor rebounding
proved to be the Cardinal's undo
ing. Stanford shot 44 percent
from the floor to Tennessee's 52
percent, and was outrebounded 48
to 40 by the shorter Lady Vols.
"I hope this wasn't a fluke,"
Lady Vol coach Pat Summitt. "I'm
very excited about what I saw on
the court today. We have worked
extremely hard since our last loss
to Virginia. Our intesity level was
good and we played great defense.
"I felt this game was closer
than the score indicated. Even
when we were up by 10 with eight
minutes left I felt Stanford was
very much in the game."
"I thought Tennessee played a
great game," coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "They disrupted our
offense with their press and
played great defense throughout."
One bright spot was the return
of center Trisha Stevens. Stevens,
who has tendinitis and has not
fully recovered from off-season
knee surgery, was heroic in the
losing effort, hitting 28 points and
pulling down 10 rebounds. It was
the senior's first game action
since last April, but she showed no
signs of rustiness, canning 13-of
-20 from the field.
The Lady Vols maintained a
slight lead throughout most of the
first half, but the Cardinal hung
close thanks to the post wizardry
of Stevens and the shooting of for
ward Julie Zeilstra. Tennessee
opened up an 11-point advantage
midway through the half, but a

(one of three on the night) quickly
closed the gap and Stanford only
trailed 42-36 at halftime.
But the home team came out
and established an up-tempo
game in the second half, and the
slightly out-of-sync Cardinal
couldn't keep up. Stanford's own
fast break was stymied by the
Lady Vols' tenacious play on the
offensive boards. Time and again,
Tennessee would miss its first
shot but manage to grab the
rebound and convert the put
back. The Cardinal, meanwhile,
was typically getting only one
shot.
The Lady Vols sprinted to a 19-
point lead by the 10-minute mark,
and Stanford had run out of
answers. The Cardinal managed
to close to within eight, but Ten
nessee's hot shooters kept the
game just out of reach. Senior
Daedra Charles led the hosts with
24 points and 10 rebounds,
including 19 points in the second
half. Freshmen Nikki Caldwell
and Peggy Evans each contributed
20 points for the Lady Vols.
"Peggy Evans was great off the
offensive boards and Nikki Cald
well hit some big three-pointers,"
VanDerveer said. Despite having
only one senior in Charles, it was
the Lady Vols' depth that was a
decisive factor in the game.
Towards the end of the first half,
the Tennessee bench had already
poured in 20 points, while the
Stanford reserves had not scored.
Chris MacMurdo came off the
Cardinal bench to contribute
eight points in the second half, but
her fine play was not enough.
This lack of contribution off
the bench took its toll on the
starters. Already hampered by
injuries, Val Whiting and Stevens
got in foul trouble later in the
game, limiting their effectiveness.
Whiting was smothered by the
aggressive Tennessee defense all
afternoon, and managed only six
points for the game. Also victim
ized by fouls was Zeilstra, who
was slapped with her fifth with six
minutes to go after scoring 17
points.
Three-point shooting also went
the Lady Vols' way. Caldwell went
four of five from behind the stripe,
and Tennessee shot 56 percent (5-
of-9) overall from trey-land. Stan
ford could manage only 3-of-10 on
the afternoon.
"As far as we're concerned
we're a different team this year,"
VanDerveer said. "We have a long
way to go in a number of phases of
the game, especially defense. We'll
learn from today's experience


Michael Topolovac â€” Dally file
Center Trlsha Stevens scored 28 points In her first action of the season yesterday
but It was not enough In a 95-80 loss at Tennessee. Stevens had off-season surgery
on both knees In April but le still not at 100 percent and has missed s lot of practice.
