# Young Cardinal squad needs to fill a big hole
## 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
Jennifer Azzi was on the sideline at Thompson-
Boling Arena yesterday, but last year's NCAA Player
of the Year never left the bench.
Azzi provided color commentary for the Pacific
Sports Network broadcast, and while she added
some historical perspective for the NCAA champi
ons, she couldn't help the Cardinal on the court.
Azzi's outside scoring punch and dazzling floor
leadership were obviously missed in the Stanford
opener. But an immediate replacement was not
expected by coach Tara VanDerveer.
Freshman Christy Hedgpeth got the starting nod
in Azzi's old position. Hedgpeth scored four points in
her first game, but the fifth spot in the lineup is still

an unsettled question for the Cardinal.
Hedgpeth, a 5-foot-10 sharpshooter from
Thomasville, N.C., beat out diminutive sophomore
guard Molly Goodenbour, rim-rattling 6-0 sopho
more forward Chris MacMurdo and 5-11 forward
guard Martha Richards for the starting spot.
Hedgpeth, who scored 32 points per game her
senior year at Westchester Academy, quietly con
tributed her four points, shooting l-for-6 from the
field, with two free throws. She missed her first col
legiate shot, a 16-footer from the right wing, off the
back rim, but buried a five-foot jumper in the second
half.
Defensively, Hedgpeth and her Cardinal team
mates weren't able to slow Volunteer freshman
Nikki Caldwell, who drilled four three- pointers and
scored 20 points.
Goodenbour, at 5-6, is possibly the best three
point shooter on the team but is still improving her
ball-handling. She saw only limited action in the
opener, replacing Hedgpeth once in the first half and
returning with 3:15 left in the game. She missed two
three-pointers, but added a lay-in at the buzzer.
With MacMurdo in the lineup, Stanford loses
some defensive quickness, but gains strength and
scoring punch. MacMurdo scored eight points and
was the leading scorer off the bench, shooting 3-for
-4 from the field and 2-for-2 from the line.
With MacMurdo playing opposite Henning in the
backcourt, Stanford has four players over six feet
tall, and a stronger rebounding alignment. She was a
medical redshirt her freshman year with a back
injury, but has returned to fall speed.
Junior Richards is another piece to the puzzle.
Richards was scoreless in the opener, substituting at
forward for sophomore Val Whiting Richards' role
in the Stanford offense is still undefined, but she is a
dangerous outside shooter.
Card notes
Forward Julie Zeilstra moved into 16th place on the
school all-time scoring list.
