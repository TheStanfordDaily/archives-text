# Men dump Rider and Yale to win Stanford Invitational
## 
### Robert Pardington Senior staff writer 
* The Yale Bulldogß came in to
the final game of the Stanford
Saturday night hop
ing to scrap out a win against the
Cardinal using a slowed down
tempo and outside shooting,
o The problem was, their tallest
was only 6-foot-5, and
they were hopelessly overmatched

just a formality to determine the
.best team on the floor as Stanford

"Ugly," was the only way Stan
ford forward and tournament
Most Valuable Player Andrew Vla
hov could describe the champi
onship game. "Most basketball
players don't like to play against
the style that the Ivy League
plays. They're real patient."
Yale, which finished second in
the Ivy League last year, kept it
close for one half as they held cen
ter Adam Keefe to only three
points on l-of-5 shooting.
The Bulldogs would collapse
two or three players on Keefe

whenever he got the ball, and then
hack at him while he was going up
for a shot, trying to disrupt his
rhythm.
"They did a good job of bottling
us up a little," Stanford coach
Mike Montgomery said. "I don't
think we got it into (Keefe) as
much or as cleanly as we wanted
to."
Last season, Yale was in the top
10 in the nation in defensive field
goal percentage, and they showed
some of that tenacity Saturday.
"We've been able to stop some
real good players," Yale coach Dick
Kuchen said. "You have to key on
(Keefe), and get as much help as
you possibly can."
"I was definitely a little out of
sync," Keefe said. "In the first
half I felt like I was trying to get

out from underneath the rim."
The slow-down style of play
was frustrating for Keefe and
Stanford, which became tentative
on offense.
"We knew they'd try to slow
tempo, run motion, and they did a
good job of doing it," Montgomery
said.
But while the Cardinal was
having trouble scoring in the first
half, shooting only 41.7 percent,
the Bulldogs were a pathetic 32.0
percent from the field. Most of
their buckets came on three-point
shots or on put backs of missed
shots inside.

well, and we got annihilated on

the backboards," Kuchensaid.
On the game, the Cardinal dou
bled the Bulldogs' rebounding
total, 48 to 24 to be exact. Keefe,
who finished with eight points,
nevertheless had 13 rebounds.
Vlahov, added six boards to his
seven on Friday, and forward
Brent Williams also had six, in
only 11 minutes off the bench and
in only the second game of his col
lege career.
Sophomore guard Kenny Hicks
popped in eight of his 10 points in
the second half to supply an offen
sive threat off the bench. Hicks
had eight points and four assists
in 19 minutes of action Friday,
and was named to the All-Tourna
ment team.
"(Hicks) is a gamer," Mont
gomery said, "I've been after him
to play better in practice so that it
will carry over to the games, and
he's been doing that."
Keefe was also named All-Tour
ney, joining Vlahov, Yale guard Ed
Peterson and Rider guard Darrick
Suber.
Forward Deshon Wingate
deserved consideration for the All-
Tournament team just on the
merit of two beautiful alley-oop
dunks against Yale, both on passes
from Vlahov. On the second dunk,

Wingate leaped literally over Yale
center Travis McCready and had
his knees on McCready's shoul
ders while performing said dunk.
Keefe said after the game that
while he was frustrated at times,
the team's performance against
Yale was encouraging, because it
showed that even if the big scorers
don't produce, the other players
can compensate.
"We're all that much better
this year," Keefe said. "(Kenny)
Ammann and I can have bad
games and we'll still win by 20."
Stanford played all of the play
ers who suited up and gave many
of the reserves significant min
utes in a 93-66 drubbing of Rider
College Friday night. Stanford got
out to a 9-0 advantage and just
glided in from there.
"December is to find out what
combinations you need," Mont
gomery said. "I'm looking for
combinations to see what people
can give us."
In the first game of Williams'
career, the redshirt freshman
scored eight points and pulled
down five rebounds in 19 minutes.
"Offensively, I took the shots I
was supposed to take," Williams

said.
Guard Peter Dukes played
more than half of the game
against Rider, scoring six points
and giving out two assists.
Keefe paced Stanford Friday,
pouring in 24 points on 7-of-8
shooting, and was a perfect 10-for
-10 at the free throw line.
Guard Kenny Ammann scored
17, hitting 6-of-8 from the floor
including 2-of-4 from behind the
three-point line.
Vlahov had 12 points, seven
rebounds and four assists in his

26 minutes of action.
Overall, Stanford shot a
tremendous 64.8 percent against
Rider, and hit at a 74.1 percent
clip in the second half.
"Certainly we felt that we could
do certain things any time we
wanted to do them," Montgomery
said. "But they had good quick
ness to compensate for their lack
of size and it was good to see what
we could do against their defen
sive pressure and quickness."
"I knew that obviously we'd
have to play a near-perfect game
to hang with these guys," Rider
coach Kevin Bannon said. "I knew
we'd have problems with their
inside game."
