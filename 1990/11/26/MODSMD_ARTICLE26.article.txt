# Cardinal to meet Wyoming
## 
### Harold Yu Staff writer 
It's funny how things work out.
Last season, the Stanford
women's volleyball team was
unceremoniously booted from the
NCAA tournament by the unsung
Wyoming Cowgirls. It was the
worst of defeats in the worst of
seasons.
The rejuvenated 1990 Cardi
nal, now 25-3, was given a prime
time shot at redemption when the
NCAA tournament pairingß were
announced late yesterday. No. 3
Stanford will host unranked
Wyoming (19-9) in the first round
in the West region. The match will
be played at Burnham Pavilion,
Thursday at 7:30 p.m.
"The match is another shot at
them," Stanford coach Don Shaw
said. "I think it'll be interesting.
They're a different team. They
lost a lot of seniors out there and
we were really young. It'll be a dif
ferent set-up, but they're still
going to be good this time."
The Cowgirls hit .231 as a team

this season. They are led by mid
dle blocker Dailene Glenn. The 5-
foot-10 senior had 366 kills and
129 digs this year, while hitting
.310.
Wyoming finished fourth in the
Western Athletic Conference with
a 5-5 conference record. The team
defeated No. 11 New Mexico Oct.
18 but finished the year with a
three-game loss at Kentucky. The
Cowgirls are seeded seventh in the
West.
Last season, Wyoming stunned
the Cardinal in the second round
of the tournament. In the contest
at Pauley Pavilion, Stanford led 2-
1 in games before surrendering
the match. The Cowgirls
advanced to the regional finals,
but lost to top-ranked UCLA.
Sophomore Bev Oden and junior
Kristin Klein both had 18 kills in
the defeat. Klein and Oden will
return to lead the Cardinal attack
Thursday.
"We're all really fired up,"
Klein said. "Everyone[s real
excited to get on to the big time.
We want revenge, but we're really

just looking at it as another team
to beat. We don't want to be
caught by surprise."
In other regional matches, No.
1 UCLA will face Gonzaga at
Wooden Center, No. 16 Pepper
dine meets New Mexico at Albu
querque and No. 19 San Diego
State meets No. 11 Brigham
Young in Provo. The four first
round victors will advance to the
Western Regional tournament.
While the site of the tournament
has not yet been officially
announced, the probable location
is UCLA's Pauley Pavilion.
The Western Regional may be
the most competitive of the tour
nament. Six teams ranked in the
last NCAA poll of the season will
play in the region.
The Northwest also features a
formidable group of teams. No. 4
Hawaii, No. 5 University of the
Pacific, No. 8 UC-Santa Barbara,
No. 9 Long Beach State and No.
12 San Jose State will compete for
the Final Four berth. Long Beach
is the defending national cham
pion.

12 consecutive home matches, will meet Wyoming Thursday night in Burnham Pavilion to open the
NCAA Tournament. Stanford will be trying to avenge a season-ending loss to the Cowgirls suffered
last December.
