To members of Project Stanford AIDS
Volunteer Educators, an ounce of educa
tion may be worth a pound of prevention.
The group aims to provide information to
college students to prevent the spread of
the deadly disease.
"AIDS is an epidemic that is not going
away. We have to put up an effort to coun
teract this disease," said junior Yelena
Ginzburg, a member of Project SAVE.
The project was started by Cowell Stu
dent Health Center two years ago in
response to a Center for Disease Control
study which found that about two out of
every 1,000 college students nationwide
carry the AIDS virus.
Cowell administrators decided they
needed to do more to educate Stanford
students about AIDS, and they enlisted
student volunteers in the effort.

Volunteers take a two-unit training
course on how to educate others to pre
vent the spread of AIDS and other sexu
ally transmitted diseases. The class meets
three hours per week and prepares the
volunteers to lead four different college
workshops.
These workshops, collectively called
"Safer Sex in the '905," are held through
out the year in dorms and other resi
dences. Last year, 1,300 students partici
pated in them, according to Pat Fabiano,
director of Cowell's Health Promotion
Program and the coordinator of the pro
ject. The first workshops were held this
quarter.
One workshop, "AIDS 101," teaches
basic information about the HIV virus
and the AIDS disease. Workshop leaders
discuss how the disease is transmitted
and explain to students how they can
reduce their risk of all sexually transmit

ted diseases by modifying their sexual
behavior.
"We train volunteers not to assault
their peers with this information," Fabi
ano said. "The volunteers are not there to
preach. Their message is just (for stu
dents) to be aware."
Another workshop, "Living With
AIDS," begins with a candid speech by
person who has AIDS. Then, the floor is

open for discussion. Students have the
chance to ask about the day-to-day reali
ties of the disease.
Volunteers also learn how to host
"Rubber Wear Parties." This "party" is
actually a practical discussion of contra
ceptives with a demonstration on how to
use them. Daniel Bao, a 1990 Stanford
graduate, used to host the parties, and he
is training the project members to con
tinue holding the workshops.
The fourth workshop is called "Sexual
ity and Intimacy in the Age of AIDS." It
seeks to help students build better inti
mate relationships with emphasis on
communication, self-esteem and
assertiveness.
Fabiano said Stanford students gener
ally are well-educated about AIDS and
have changed their attitudes toward the
disease â€” but they have not changed
their sexual behavior to be more safe.

Because behavior is so difficult to
change, the volunteers are encouraged to
try to touch students "personally" during
the workshops, she said.
Many of the volunteers have been
touched by the disease in their own lives.
"I got involved in this program because
someone very close to my family died of
AIDS, and it really had an impact on my
family," said freshman Michelle Fried
land.
The project also has educational out
reach programs for the local community.
Volunteers run a workshop called "AIDS
is Real," which informs high school stu
dents in San Mateo County public schools
about the disease. Project members also
participate in a support group for people
who are living with AIDS.
In the project's first year, 52 students
participated. This year, 51 students are
members.
