# Tiny acorns to mighty oaks: Students try to revitalize Foothills
## 
### Gerard Manning 
As Stanford celebrates its centennial, a group of
students is busy planting oak trees in the Foothills in
the hope that the trees will be around for the Univer
sity's next hundred years.
Under the direction of a Palo Alto-based ecology
group, Magic Inc., the students are planting acorns
to reverse decades of decline in the oak population
because of grazing and drought. This fall, volunteers
will plant and water 300 prepared sites with locally
grown, drought-resistant acorns to replace dead and
dying trees.
The company was called in by Stanford in 1983 to
organize the replanting effort after a survey showed
that many old trees were dying off and few young
ones were growing in their place. Tree cover had
dropped by almost 30 percent of what it was
recorded at in a 1928 survey.
Cattle, which graze in the Foothills during the
winter months, are the chief culprit, according to
Magic's Carl Wittenberg. "They just chew up all the
young seedlings that they can find," he said. "This
has blocked almost all regeneration over the past 50
years."
Most of the aging trees are now stressed or dying
from the drought and the drop in ground water
caused by the recent tapping of well water by Stan
ford and others. Fewer than 5 percent of the oaks
produce crops of acorns, and those acorns that do fall
are usually eaten by rodents or destroyed by the
drought.
To save the oak population, Stanford has barred
grazing on several hundred acres and turned to

Magic to organize a volunteer planting program in
these protected areas. Eventually, the whole area
will be fenced off for as long as is necessary for the
region to return to its natural condition.
Exclusion of cattle has already greatly helped
restoration of the native habitat. "In a number of
areas, juvenile trees, released from the pressures of
grazing, have responded dramatically" said Witten
berg, noting the return of many plants and animal
species to these areas since they've been protected.
Since 1984, hundreds of volunteers have planted
thousands of acorns. The initial results, from stan
dard forestry techniques, were disappointing; almost
90 percent of the first seedlings were wiped out by
rodents and the prolonged drought. So Magic created
new planting techniques to better protect the acorns.
By surrounding each planting site with rodent
proof wire mesh and watering the plants regularly
over their first two years, Magic has seen the
seedlings' survival rate soar to 98 percent, according
to coordinator Dave Mufily.
With over 1,000 new trees planted, some early
ones are even now producing their first crop of
acorns.
"It's fun to think that the acorns we plant now
will be looking down on Stanford at its next centen
nial," MufTly said.
The cooperation between Stanford and Magic has
gratified both sides. According to Judy Chan, associ
ate director of planning for Stanford, Magic's effort
and long-term commitment made the company the
ideal choice for the job. "We could not do it without
