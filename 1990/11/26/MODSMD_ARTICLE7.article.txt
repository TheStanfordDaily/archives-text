# After the Band, tight budget is next hurdle for Cummings
## 
### John Louie Editorial staff 
Soon after assuming the posi
tion of acting athletic director on
Oct. 1, Alan Cummings found
himself at the center of a campus
controversy that grew into a
national issue. Cummings, whose
graduation from Stanford in 1963
marked the same year that the
Stanford Band made its "transfor
mation" from a traditional march
ing band to its current form,
recently suspended the Band for
its controversial halftime perfor
mance at the University of Ore
gon.
Now, with the Band reinstated
and the football season behind
him, Cummings has concentrated
on sustaining the Department of
Athletics which boasts three
NCAA championship teams and a
commitment to a broad-based,
multi-level athletics program
amid increasing costs and budget
cuts.
What were the specific fac
tors precipitating the deci

sion to suspend the Band?
It was a collective decision
made by the staff of the depart
ment to suspend the Band, based
on our feeling regarding the show
at the University of Oregon game
on Oct. 27. The inappropriateness
of the show and the insensitivity
to the residents and community of
Oregon [were] evident. The spec
tators came to Autzen Stadium to
enjoy a football game and the
entertainment. I was at the game,
and I was disappointed that the
Band was received the way it was
and essentially booed off the field.
I then received a telephone call
from [Oregon Athletic Director]
Bill Byrne, and we needed to take
some action. We felt that a suspen
sion was appropriate, and that's
what we did. The suspension was
lifted for Big Game, but the initial
show theme was discussed and the
script was reviewed by two people
in the department who regularly
look over the scripts for home
games.
Some people have drawn a
parallel between the decision

to ban the Band and the cur
rent national controversy
over censorship in that artis
tic expressions which are
found offensive are sup
pressed. Do you agree with
this comparison?
I dismiss the issue of censor
ship and rather would like to
think that in the spirit of working
together with the Band and Ath
letics Department, we all have the
same common objective of sup
porting the football team, building
enthusiasm for the team and con
tributing to the general entertain
ment of the game and the day. I
don't consider this to be an issue
of censorship. And I don't expect
that we'll have any difficulty
working with the Band as we look
forward to next football season's
seven home games.
Following the decision to
suspend the Band, national
publications criticized Stan
ford's Athletics Department.
Sports Illustrated even
brought it to a more personal
level, suggesting that you

should M lighten up a bit." How
did you receive this criticism?
I think that always happens to
a person who is in the public eye. I
guess I maintain that when one
goes to visit another person's
home or community, tnat you
don't necessarily let anything go.
You have to be sensitive and aware
of the environment and the peo
ple. I don't believe we should
expect that people can do pretty
much anything they want at any
time, no matter where they are.
Byrne recently asked you in
a personal letter to keep the
Band home next year instead
of bringing them with the
team to Oregon. Will you com
ply with Byrne's request?
[Byrne] asked that the Band
not accompany the team to Ore
gon next year. At some point in
time, we'll find out what the
Band's plans are for next year and
if it's appropriate for them to go.
If they have plans, [the Athletics
Department] and the Band will
consider asking Bill Byrne to
reconsider. But at this point in
time, I am not spending any time
thinking about what we're going
to do next year. What we've been
doing recently is concentrating on
Big Game, and now hopefully
we're all celebrating our great vic
tory.
What do you see as the
Band's role here at Stanford?
The Band is there to give sup
port and spirit to the Stanford
team that's competing. I've been
around the Band and ei\joyed it
ever since its transformation in
1963. The Band is a student orga
nization and an activity of the
Department of Music. At the same
time, though, it's part of the
entertainment aspects of our ath
letics programs and support
groups. First and foremost, the
role of the Band is to support the
teams and add to the entertain

ment that a sporting event pro
vides.
One of [former Athletic
Director] Andy Geiger's con
troversial actions last year
was cutting funding for the
field hockey program. This
decision led some to claim
that Stanford only wanted to
fund programs that were
either winning programs or
prominent programs. Do you
agree?
I simply don't look at programs
from the standpoint of their abil
ity to generate revenue or to
attract large numbers of people.
We have a 29 sport program with
funding at a variety of levels. In
addition to that, we have a robust
and active intramural program as
well as a general recreation pro
gram.
I think the most difficult issue
before the new athletic director
will be to sustain the broad-based
program and see it flourish within
the context of financial equilib
rium. Our problems at Stanford
aren't any different than (those)
being faced at other colleges and
universities. We're dependent
upon gate and television revenue
to support the income side of the
ledger, while still being pressured
on the expense side to provide
opportunities for students to com
pete at the highest level.
I don't consider the decisions
regarding field hockey, sailing,
wrestling or any of the other
reductions in the staff as anything
more than an attempt to put
income and expense in equilib
rium. If we can't match the
increase in our expenses by an
increase in revenue sources,
something has to give. My com
mitment to this job as acting ath
letic director is to do everything I
can to sustain the program, yet I
know how difficult that is going to
be.

What do you think of the
yell leader program, and vjrill
it return next year?
This was a program that wps
viewed to help invite and fo4tr
the support for our team andfc to
increase the enthusiasm and stf>-
port.... The cheerleaders are (ty
ing very hard and working consci
entiously to give their total sup
port to the football team, and;l
hope they can be successful,
the end of the year, there will be
some kind of evaluation of the
cheerleaders, and the cheerlead
ers will get together to decide
whether to continue the prograrfc.
i
Why aren't you applying for
the permanent athletic direc
tor position?
I am looking forward to work
ing for the next athletic director.; I
feel I can make a better contribu
tion working in the general
administration of the prograjn
and also with the sport teams that
I'm responsible for. I enjoyed
working with Andy Geiger, and
look forward to working for tHe
next director.
What did you think of the
lack of security at Big Game?
The University of California is
responsible for the security of its
home games, and it's clear that
it's different than ours. We try to
maintain control and security and
safety and that obviously includes
not allowing spectators to enter
the field either before or during
the game or during halftime. We
think we have a good security
plan, but I don't want to get into
any judgments of the Berkeley
plan other than to say that it's
unfortunate to have [the] inci
dents that took place in Big Game.
What did you think of Big
Game in general?
The last three victories have
validated what a great plan Denny
Green has put in place with the
coaches and players; the prospects
for Stanford football are excellent.
This kind of win and enthusiasm
is college football at its finest.
Stanford has great potential with
its football program and this has
been a successful season, even
with the disappointments and
early losses.
After this Big Game, you have
to be optimistic.

i
Why aren't you applying for
the permanent athletic direc

I am looking forward to work

and also with the sport teams that
I'm responsible for. I enjoyed
working with Andy Geiger, and
look forward to working for tHe
next director.
What did you think of the
lack of security at Big Game?
The University of California is
responsible for the security of its
home games, and it's clear that
it's different than ours. We try to
maintain control and security and
safety and that obviously includes
not allowing spectators to enter
the field either before or during
the game or during halftime. We
think we have a good security
plan, but I don't want to get into
any judgments of the Berkeley
plan other than to say that it's
unfortunate to have [the] inci

What did you think of Big
Game in general?
The last three victories have
validated what a great plan Denny
Green has put in place with the
coaches and players; the prospects
for Stanford football are excellent.

Stanford has great potential with

Acting Athletic Director Alan Cummings Is trying to put the banning of the Stanford Band behind him and
focus on the more daunting task of managing his department with a strapped budget.

Soon after assuming the posi
tion of acting athletic director on
Oct. 1, Alan Cummings found
himself at the center of a campus
controversy that grew into a
national issue. Cummings, whose
graduation from Stanford in 1963
marked the same year that the
Stanford Band made its "transfor
mation" from a traditional march
ing band to its current form,
recently suspended the Band for
its controversial halftime perfor
mance at the University of Ore
gon.
Now, with the Band reinstated
and the football season behind
him, Cummings has concentrated
on sustaining the Department of
Athletics which boasts three
NCAA championship teams and a
commitment to a broad-based,
multi-level athletics program
amid increasing costs and budget
cuts.
What were the specific fac
tors precipitating the deci

sion to suspend the Band?
It was a collective decision
made by the staff of the depart
ment to suspend the Band, based
on our feeling regarding the show
at the University of Oregon game
on Oct. 27. The inappropriateness
of the show and the insensitivity
to the residents and community of
Oregon [were] evident. The spec
tators came to Autzen Stadium to
enjoy a football game and the
entertainment. I was at the game,
and I was disappointed that the
Band was received the way it was
and essentially booed off the field.
I then received a telephone call
from [Oregon Athletic Director]
Bill Byrne, and we needed to take
some action. We felt that a suspen
sion was appropriate, and that's
what we did. The suspension was
lifted for Big Game, but the initial
show theme was discussed and the
script was reviewed by two people
in the department who regularly
look over the scripts for home
games.
Some people have drawn a
parallel between the decision

to ban the Band and the cur
rent national controversy
over censorship in that artis
tic expressions which are
found offensive are sup
pressed. Do you agree with
this comparison?
I dismiss the issue of censor
ship and rather would like to
think that in the spirit of working
together with the Band and Ath
letics Department, we all have the
same common objective of sup
porting the football team, building
enthusiasm for the team and con
tributing to the general entertain
ment of the game and the day. I
don't consider this to be an issue
of censorship. And I don't expect
that we'll have any difficulty
working with the Band as we look
forward to next football season's
seven home games.
Following the decision to
suspend the Band, national
publications criticized Stan
ford's Athletics Department.
Sports Illustrated even
brought it to a more personal
level, suggesting that you

should M lighten up a bit." How
did you receive this criticism?
I think that always happens to
a person who is in the public eye. I
guess I maintain that when one
goes to visit another person's
home or community, tnat you
don't necessarily let anything go.
You have to be sensitive and aware
of the environment and the peo
ple. I don't believe we should
expect that people can do pretty
much anything they want at any
time, no matter where they are.
Byrne recently asked you in
a personal letter to keep the
Band home next year instead
of bringing them with the
team to Oregon. Will you com
ply with Byrne's request?
[Byrne] asked that the Band
not accompany the team to Ore
gon next year. At some point in
time, we'll find out what the
Band's plans are for next year and
if it's appropriate for them to go.
If they have plans, [the Athletics
Department] and the Band will
consider asking Bill Byrne to
reconsider. But at this point in
time, I am not spending any time
thinking about what we're going
to do next year. What we've been
doing recently is concentrating on
Big Game, and now hopefully
we're all celebrating our great vic
tory.
What do you see as the
Band's role here at Stanford?
The Band is there to give sup
port and spirit to the Stanford
team that's competing. I've been
around the Band and ei\joyed it
ever since its transformation in
1963. The Band is a student orga
nization and an activity of the
Department of Music. At the same
time, though, it's part of the
entertainment aspects of our ath
letics programs and support
groups. First and foremost, the
role of the Band is to support the
teams and add to the entertain

ment that a sporting event pro
vides.
One of [former Athletic
Director] Andy Geiger's con
troversial actions last year
was cutting funding for the
field hockey program. This
decision led some to claim
that Stanford only wanted to
fund programs that were
either winning programs or
prominent programs. Do you
agree?
I simply don't look at programs
from the standpoint of their abil
ity to generate revenue or to
attract large numbers of people.
We have a 29 sport program with
funding at a variety of levels. In
addition to that, we have a robust
and active intramural program as
well as a general recreation pro
gram.
I think the most difficult issue
before the new athletic director
will be to sustain the broad-based
program and see it flourish within
the context of financial equilib
rium. Our problems at Stanford
aren't any different than (those)
being faced at other colleges and
universities. We're dependent
upon gate and television revenue
to support the income side of the
ledger, while still being pressured
on the expense side to provide
opportunities for students to com
pete at the highest level.
I don't consider the decisions
regarding field hockey, sailing,
wrestling or any of the other
reductions in the staff as anything
more than an attempt to put
income and expense in equilib
rium. If we can't match the
increase in our expenses by an
increase in revenue sources,
something has to give. My com
mitment to this job as acting ath
letic director is to do everything I
can to sustain the program, yet I
know how difficult that is going to
be.

What do you think of the
yell leader program, and vjrill
it return next year?
This was a program that wps
viewed to help invite and fo4tr
the support for our team andfc to
increase the enthusiasm and stf>-
port.... The cheerleaders are (ty
ing very hard and working consci
entiously to give their total sup
port to the football team, and;l
hope they can be successful,
the end of the year, there will be
some kind of evaluation of the
cheerleaders, and the cheerlead
ers will get together to decide
whether to continue the prograrfc.

Department of Music. At the same
time, though, it's part of the
entertainment aspects of our ath
letics programs and support
groups. First and foremost, the
role of the Band is to support the
teams and add to the entertain

ment that a sporting event pro
vides.
One of [former Athletic
Director] Andy Geiger's con
troversial actions last year
was cutting funding for the
field hockey program. This
decision led some to claim
that Stanford only wanted to
fund programs that were
either winning programs or
prominent programs. Do you
agree?
I simply don't look at programs
from the standpoint of their abil
ity to generate revenue or to
attract large numbers of people.
We have a 29 sport program with
funding at a variety of levels. In
addition to that, we have a robust
and active intramural program as
well as a general recreation pro
gram.
I think the most difficult issue
before the new athletic director
will be to sustain the broad-based
program and see it flourish within
the context of financial equilib
rium. Our problems at Stanford
aren't any different than (those)
being faced at other colleges and
universities. We're dependent
upon gate and television revenue
to support the income side of the
ledger, while still being pressured
on the expense side to provide
opportunities for students to com
pete at the highest level.
I don't consider the decisions
regarding field hockey, sailing,
wrestling or any of the other
reductions in the staff as anything
more than an attempt to put
income and expense in equilib
rium. If we can't match the
increase in our expenses by an
increase in revenue sources,
something has to give. My com
mitment to this job as acting ath
letic director is to do everything I
can to sustain the program, yet I
know how difficult that is going to
be.

What do you think of the
yell leader program, and vjrill
it return next year?
This was a program that wps
viewed to help invite and fo4tr
the support for our team andfc to
increase the enthusiasm and stf>-
port.... The cheerleaders are (ty
ing very hard and working consci
entiously to give their total sup
port to the football team, and;l
hope they can be successful,
the end of the year, there will be
some kind of evaluation of the
cheerleaders, and the cheerlead
ers will get together to decide
whether to continue the prograrfc.
i
Why aren't you applying for
the permanent athletic direc
tor position?
I am looking forward to work
ing for the next athletic director.; I
feel I can make a better contribu
tion working in the general
administration of the prograjn
and also with the sport teams that
I'm responsible for. I enjoyed
working with Andy Geiger, and
look forward to working for tHe
next director.
What did you think of the
lack of security at Big Game?
The University of California is
responsible for the security of its
home games, and it's clear that
it's different than ours. We try to
maintain control and security and
safety and that obviously includes
not allowing spectators to enter
the field either before or during
the game or during halftime. We
think we have a good security
plan, but I don't want to get into
any judgments of the Berkeley
plan other than to say that it's
unfortunate to have [the] inci
dents that took place in Big Game.
What did you think of Big
Game in general?
The last three victories have
validated what a great plan Denny
Green has put in place with the
coaches and players; the prospects
for Stanford football are excellent.
This kind of win and enthusiasm
is college football at its finest.
Stanford has great potential with
its football program and this has
been a successful season, even
with the disappointments and
early losses.
After this Big Game, you have
to be optimistic.
