Walesa headed for
runoff in election
WARSAW, Poland (AP) -
Lech Walesa, who united Poles
in their struggle against com
munism, was leading in
Poland's first popular presiden
tial election yesterday but
appeared headed for a runoff,
according to state TV exit polls.
In a surprising development,
Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki was running neck
and-neck against Stanislaw
Tyminski for the No. 2 spot.
Tyminski, a political unknown
until recently, is a businessman
who returned to his homeland
only this fall after 21 years in
Canada and Peru.
The second-place finisher
will enter a Dec. 9 runoff if the
winner fails to gain an outright
mfyority in the first round.
Walesa, the head of Solidar
ity, had 41 percent of the vote, a
2-to-l lead over Mazowiecki and
Tyminski, according to the
polls. The polls indicated
Mazowiecki and Tyminski each
had 20.5 percent of the vote, far
ahead of the remaining three
candidates.
It was a stunning setback for
Mazowiecki, a former Walesa
ally who instituted unpopular
economic austerity measures
after taking command of
Poland's first postwar non-
Communist government.
"No matter what the election
results are, we created a basis
for a broader democratic move
ment in Poland," Mazowiecki
told supporters at a students'

Industrial Avsrage:

club in Warsaw. "We will con
tinue the struggle for a democ
racy as we want it."
He added later on television
that he was waiting for "real
results, and not just some «*ti
mates."ln North America,
Walesa got 60 percent of the
vote among Poles who cast bal
lots in the presidential election,
an official said yesterday.
Mazowiecki, on the other
hand, got 33 percent of the votes
cast in the United States and
Canada.
A total of 36,006 people voted
in North America, where ballot
ing on Saturday preceded by one
day the general election in
Poland, said Polish Consul
Andrezj Jaroszynski, citing
unofficial figures.
Tension pervades
Ivory Coast balloting
ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP)
— Voter turnout appeared light
yesterday in the countiy's first
multiparty parliamentary elec
tion, which opposition leaders
claim was marred by intimida
tion and fraud by the party that
ruled unchallenged for 30 years.
Several people remained hos
pitalized after a clash Saturday
between supporters of President
Felix Houphouet-Boigny's con
servative Democratic Party and
its chief rival, the left-leaning
Popular Front.
About 4.4 million people reg
istered to choose 175 legislators
from among the 490 candidates
representing 19 parties. Early
results are expected today.
