# Gunman kills four near Israeli border
## 
### 
EILAT, Israel (AP) - A lone
gunman slipped across the
Egyptian border yesterday and
ambushed a bus and three mili
tary vehicles, killing four Israelis
and wounding 27, the army said.
The attack was the third from
Arab territory in two days. At
least four Palestinian guerrillas
were killed and two Israeli soldiers
injured in incidents in Israel's
self-declared security zone in
southern Lebanon and off the
Mediterranean coast.
The dead in the border attack,
three soldiers and a civilian bus
driver, were shot on a road run
ning along the Israeli-Egyptian
border about 15 miles northwest
of the Israeli Red Sea resort of
Eilat, the army said. It said most
of the wounded were civilian
workers at an Israeli air base.
The gunman, who used an
automatic rifle and was described
as wearing a uniform, escaped
back into Egypt. He was shot by
an Israeli security guard and trail
ing blood, the army said.
An Israeli army patrol chased
him, firing, but did not pursue
him across the frontier, the army
said.
A senior Egyptian security
source in Cairo said an Egyptian
border policeman stationed in the
area had been arrested as the sus
pected assailant.
Israel army radio said the
assailant's blood-stained flak jack
et with "Allah" written on it was
found in the area. It said the
attack was claimed by the Moslem
fundamentalist group Islamic
Holy War-Jerusalem in a state
ment issued in Amman, Jordan.
Israeli and Egyptian reports
said the attacker was armed with
the Soviet-designed Kalashnikov

assault rifle.
Karen Golan, 12, who was on
the bus, said, "I was sitting next
to my father, near the back door.
Suddenly we saw a bus half on the
road, half in the wadi, and an
army van.
"A man came out as though he
was flagging us down for help. The
driver slowed down and stopped
and then the man opened fire.
"My father grabbed me and
told me to put my hands around
my head and get on the floor."
Israel television showed a
woman named Rachel Fishbein,
telling a relative on the telephone
that she had seen a passenger's
fingers blown off by bullets. "We
just lay there. Don't ask what hap
pened," she sobbed.
Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir called on Egypt to capture
and punish the assailant, and pre
vent further attacks.
Egyptian Foreign Minister
Esmat Abdel-Meguid called the
attack "very regrettable" and said
he hoped it would not affect rela
tions between the two countries.
Egypt and Israel have been at
peace since 1979, and the border is
less heavily defended than other
Israeli frontiers.
In another attack yesterday, a
Lebanese woman carrying explo
sives killed herself and injured
two Israeli soldiers in Israel's self
proclaimed security zone in south
ern Lebanon, army reports said.
The Syrian Socialist Nationalist
Party claimed responsibility for
the attack and said 12 Israeli sol
diers also were killed.
On Saturday, a navy gunboat
attacked a dinghy off the
Lebanese coast that officials said
was headed to attack Israel. The
five guerrillas aboard were killed.
