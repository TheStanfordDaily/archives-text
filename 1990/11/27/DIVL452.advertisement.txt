LOSE 20 POUNDS
IN TWO WEEKS!
Famous U.S. Women's Ski Team Diet
During the non-snow off season the U.S. Women's Alpine Ski Team
members used the "Ski Team" diet to lose 20 pounds in two weeks.
That's right—2o pounds in 14 days! The basis of the diet is chemical
food action and was devised by a famous Colorado physician
especially for the U.S. Ski Team. Normal energy is maintained (very
important!) while reducing. You keep "full"—no
starvation—because the diet is designed that way. It's a diet that is
easy to follow whether you work, travel or stay at home.
This is, honestly, a fantastically successful diet. If it weren't, the U.S.
Women's Ski Team wouldn't be permitted to use it! Right? So, give
yourself the same break the U.S. Ski Team gets. Lose weight the
scientific, proven way. Even if you've tried all the other diets, you
owe it to yourself to try the U.S. Women's Ski Team Diet. That is, if
you really do want to lose 20 pounds in two weeks. Order today.
Tear this out as a reminder.
