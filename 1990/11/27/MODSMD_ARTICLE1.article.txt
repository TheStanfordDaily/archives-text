# Revenue shortfall forces $8 million in reductions
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
In order to stay in good finan
cial health, the University will be
forced to swallow several doses of
"repositioning" sooner than the
doctor originally ordered.
University Provost James
Rosse announced yesterday that
he expects a revenue shortfall of
more than $8 million in this year's
operating budget. While Rosse
warned the faculty several weeks
ago that revenue projections had
been overly optimistic, yesterday
was the first time he publicly dis
closed the severity of the shortfall.
In order to avoid a deficit, the
current repositioning process will
be accelerated, forcing University
departments and offices to make
cuts within the next few months
that weren't scheduled to go into
effect until next year. In addition,
one-time reductions will be made
across the board for all depart
ments and offices.
As a result of the plan unveiled

yesterday, the layoffs of some Uni
versity employees are likely to
occur six months earlier than
expected, and some additional lay
offs may result. Rosse said it was
too early to speculate on how
many additional employees will be
laid off.
"This is a difficult message to
deliver, especially at the beginning
of a holiday season," Rosse and
University President Donald
Kennedy said in a letter released
yesterday to the Stanford faculty
and staff.
Making repositioning cuts dur
ing this fiscal year instead of next
effectively kills two birds with one
stone: a cut in the long-term bud
get base occurs, and a reduction in
expenditures is achieved in this
year's operating budget.
The $8 million in one-time
reductions this year does not
increase the amount the Univer
sity plans to cut from the budget
base in its repositioning efforts.
That figure remains at $22 mil
lion — at least for now.

Budget-planners will recon
vene in February, Rosse said, to
determine if additional cuts to the
budget base will be needed. (See
