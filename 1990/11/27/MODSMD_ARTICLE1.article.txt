# Revenue shortfall forces $8 million in reductions
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
In order to stay in good finan
cial health, the University will be
forced to swallow several doses of
"repositioning" sooner than the
doctor originally ordered.
University Provost James
Rosse announced yesterday that
he expects a revenue shortfall of
more than $8 million in this year's
operating budget. While Rosse
warned the faculty several weeks
ago that revenue projections had
been overly optimistic, yesterday
was the first time he publicly dis
closed the severity of the shortfall.
In order to avoid a deficit, the
current repositioning process will
be accelerated, forcing University
departments and offices to make
cuts within the next few months
that weren't scheduled to go into
effect until next year. In addition,
one-time reductions will be made
across the board for all depart
ments and offices.
As a result of the plan unveiled

yesterday, the layoffs of some Uni
versity employees are likely to
occur six months earlier than
expected, and some additional lay
offs may result. Rosse said it was
too early to speculate on how
many additional employees will be
laid off.
"This is a difficult message to
deliver, especially at the beginning
of a holiday season," Rosse and
University President Donald
Kennedy said in a letter released
yesterday to the Stanford faculty
and staff.
Making repositioning cuts dur
ing this fiscal year instead of next
effectively kills two birds with one
stone: a cut in the long-term bud
get base occurs, and a reduction in
expenditures is achieved in this
year's operating budget.
The $8 million in one-time
reductions this year does not
increase the amount the Univer
sity plans to cut from the budget
base in its repositioning efforts.
That figure remains at $22 mil
lion — at least for now.

Budget-planners will recon
vene in February, Rosse said, to
determine if additional cuts to the
budget base will be needed. (See

close, but do not inflict long-term
harm," Rosse said.
The $8 million reduction in
this year's operating budget
breaks down as follows:
• About $4 million will come

from accelerated repositioning —
from departments and offices
making cuts to their budget bases
earlier than planned;
• About $2 million will come
from repositioning reductions
that were made ahead of schedule;
and
• About $2 million will result
from one-time reductions to items
in this year's operating budget
that are not part of the larger
repositioning process.
Rosse has sent letters to deans
and vice presidents, informing
them of budget reduction targets
to be met by March 31,1990. The
targets range from 2.4 percent to
just over 7 percent. The higher
targets generally apply to admin
istrative areas and the lower tar
gets apply primarily to academic
units, Rosse said.

Student financial aid and obli
gatory debt payments are exempt
from the reductions.
Rosse has asked the deans and
vice presidents to submit plans for
budget reductions to him by Jan
uary 1.
The $8 million projected short
fall in this year's operating budget
is attributable to three causes,
Rosse reiterated yesterday. They
are:
• A lower than expected payout
rate on the University's expend
able funds pool, which is com
prised of non-endowment invest
ments;
• A provisional indirect cost
rate of 74 percent that has been
imposed by the government dur
ing the ongoing federal investiga
tions of Stanford's indirect cost
policies (the University had bud
geted a rate of 78 percent); and

• Lower than expected research
volume, resulting in lower than
expected indirect cost recovery
from research.
Two factors contribute to the
expected shortfall in research vol
ume. Based on the last several
months, budget-planners now
expect research volume to be the
same this year as last year.
Growth of 2 to 3 percent had been
expected.
Secondly, research volume was
lower last year than budget-plan
ners realized when they formu
lated this year's budget. Thus, the
projected growth was made from a
base that was too high.
These two factors alone have
created a projected shortfall of
$5.1 million.
The University operating bud
get is more than $400 million.

cial health, the University will be
forced to swallow several doses of
"repositioning" sooner than the

budget base will be needed. (See

close, but do not inflict long-term
harm," Rosse said.
The $8 million reduction in
this year's operating budget
breaks down as follows:
• About $4 million will come

from accelerated repositioning —
from departments and offices
making cuts to their budget bases
earlier than planned;
• About $2 million will come
from repositioning reductions
that were made ahead of schedule;
and
• About $2 million will result
from one-time reductions to items
in this year's operating budget
that are not part of the larger
repositioning process.
Rosse has sent letters to deans
and vice presidents, informing
them of budget reduction targets
to be met by March 31,1990. The
targets range from 2.4 percent to
just over 7 percent. The higher
targets generally apply to admin
istrative areas and the lower tar
gets apply primarily to academic
units, Rosse said.

Student financial aid and obli
gatory debt payments are exempt
from the reductions.
Rosse has asked the deans and
vice presidents to submit plans for
budget reductions to him by Jan
uary 1.
The $8 million projected short
fall in this year's operating budget
is attributable to three causes,
Rosse reiterated yesterday. They
are:
• A lower than expected payout
rate on the University's expend
able funds pool, which is com
prised of non-endowment invest
ments;
• A provisional indirect cost
rate of 74 percent that has been
imposed by the government dur
ing the ongoing federal investiga
tions of Stanford's indirect cost
policies (the University had bud
geted a rate of 78 percent); and

• Lower than expected research
volume, resulting in lower than
expected indirect cost recovery
from research.
Two factors contribute to the
expected shortfall in research vol
ume. Based on the last several
months, budget-planners now
expect research volume to be the
same this year as last year.
Growth of 2 to 3 percent had been
expected.
Secondly, research volume was
lower last year than budget-plan
ners realized when they formu
lated this year's budget. Thus, the
projected growth was made from a
base that was too high.
These two factors alone have
created a projected shortfall of
$5.1 million.
The University operating bud
get is more than $400 million.
In order to stay in good finan
cial health, the University will be
forced to swallow several doses of
"repositioning" sooner than the
doctor originally ordered.
University Provost James
Rosse announced yesterday that
he expects a revenue shortfall of
more than $8 million in this year's
operating budget. While Rosse
warned the faculty several weeks
ago that revenue projections had
been overly optimistic, yesterday
was the first time he publicly dis
closed the severity of the shortfall.
In order to avoid a deficit, the
current repositioning process will
be accelerated, forcing University
departments and offices to make
cuts within the next few months
that weren't scheduled to go into
effect until next year. In addition,
one-time reductions will be made
across the board for all depart
ments and offices.
As a result of the plan unveiled

yesterday, the layoffs of some Uni
versity employees are likely to
occur six months earlier than
expected, and some additional lay
offs may result. Rosse said it was
too early to speculate on how
many additional employees will be
laid off.
"This is a difficult message to
deliver, especially at the beginning
of a holiday season," Rosse and
University President Donald
Kennedy said in a letter released
yesterday to the Stanford faculty
and staff.
Making repositioning cuts dur
ing this fiscal year instead of next
effectively kills two birds with one
stone: a cut in the long-term bud
get base occurs, and a reduction in
expenditures is achieved in this
year's operating budget.
The $8 million in one-time
reductions this year does not
increase the amount the Univer
sity plans to cut from the budget
base in its repositioning efforts.
That figure remains at $22 mil
lion — at least for now.

Budget-planners will recon
vene in February, Rosse said, to
determine if additional cuts to the
budget base will be needed. (See
