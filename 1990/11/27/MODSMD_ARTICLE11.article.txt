Hostages moved to Baghdad
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) — More than 100
Americans, Britons and other Europeans held
at strategic sites in Kuwait have been moved to
Baghdad, diplomats reported yesterday.
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, mean
while, said three American hostages can go
home, and the Swedish Embassy announced
more than 50 Swedes in Iraq have also been
given permission to leave.
U.S. and British diplomats said the Western
hostages in Kuwait — including five Ameri
cans and 70 Britons — were brought to the
Mansour Melia Hotel in the Iraqi capital.
The diplomats, however, were unsure if the
Westerners would replace Germans allowed to
leave strategic sites inside Iraq or were
brought to Baghdad to be released.
They also said that Iraq has not allowed any
Iraqis to enter Kuwait for a week and has been
encouraging those in the country to go home.
Britons are the largest group of Westerners
in the two countries, with about 400 hiding in
Kuwait, another 400 not allowed to leave Iraq
but free to move within Baghdad and 330
hostages, the British Embassy said.
The U.S. Embassy has said there Eire more
than 900 Americans in the two countries,
including 104 held at strategic sites.
Polish prime minister resigns
WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Prime Minister
Tadeusz Mazowiecki resigned yesterday along
with his government a day after a political neo
phyte dealt him a humiliating defeat in presi
dential elections.
"Poland's painful but necessary program of
getting out of economic catastrophe can only
be realized with the understanding of the
meyority of the nation," said Mazowiecki, the
first non-Communist prime minister in the
East bloc. "Society made its choice."
He had come in third in presidential elec
tions Sunday, failing to qualify for a runoff
with Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, who fin
ished first.
Mazowiecki was knocked out of the race by
Stanislaw Tyminski, a wealthy businessman
who returned to Poland this fall after 21 years
in Canada and Peru.
"I will win these elections," an optimistic
Tyminski told supporters and the curious at
his Warsaw headquarters. "I am not afraid of
Walesa, I am not afraid of anyone."
Mazowiecki, 63, took office in August 1989
and spearheaded Eastern Europe's most ambi
tious economic reforms and won international
acclaim for his historic role in the democratiza
tion.
It was the first time Poles voted for a presi
dent by popular election. In the past, both
under Communist rule and before World War
11, presidents were elected by the Parliament.
