# U.N. powers agree to use of force on Iraq
## 
### 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) - The Soviet
Union and China joined the United States,
Britain and France yesterday in delivering
an ultimatum that gives Iraq until January
to withdraw its troops from Kuwait or face
a military strike.
The nations — the five permanent Secu
rity Council members with veto power —
agreed yesterday on a draft resolution that
allows use of "all necessary means" to lib
erate Kuwait and restore its government.
The draft contains optional deadline
dates — Jan. 1 or Jan. 15. It gives Iraq one
last chance in "a pause of goodwill."
The deadline in the final resolution, to
be adopted Thursday, will be decided in con
sultations among the 15 council members,
diplomats said.
Yesterday's accord ends speculation the
Soviets and Chinese might abstain. Previ
ously, the Kremlin and Beying pledged only
not to veto the measure.
The broad coalition against Iraq's inva
sion of Kuwait now has passed its toughest
test — authorization of military force.
The resolution demands that Iraq with
draw and authorizes "all necessary means"
— meaning military force — to drive Iraqi
invaders from Kuwait. But it decides "to
allow Iraq one final opportunity, as a pause
of goodwill," to leave the sheikdom it
invaded Aug. 2.
The measure is expected to be adopted at
an extraordinary session of foreign minis
ters. It would mark the second time in U.N.
history the Security council authorized mil
itary action to counter aggression. The first
was in 1950 during the Korean conflict.
The council also authorized military
action to enforce the maritime embargo of
Iraq and the blockade against Rhodesia —
now black-ruled Zimbabwe — in 1966.
British Ambassador David Hannay told
reporters the January deadline, whether
the first or 15th "is not a pause for good
offices."

"It is a pause in which we all are making
clear that no new measures will be taken
against Iraq prior to the end of that period,
after which the authorization to use all
measures ... which includes the use of
force, would become available," he said.
The envoy said Britain supports a Jan. 1
deadline because that would mean "nearly
six months that Iraq has been in illegal
occupation of Kuwait and long enough to
realize the world is united against it."
The United States also favors Jan. 1, but
U.S. officials in Washington indicated the
resolution and date were negotiable.
Kuwait was preparing a presentation for
the Security Council today — including a
videotape — to portray what it describes as
Iraqi atrocities since the invasion, including
the murder of children and looting of hospi
tals.
Soviet Ambassador Yuliy Vorontsov told
reporters yesterday as he entered consulta
tions "there is broad agreement" among
the five. He did not specify the deadline for
Iraqi troop withdrawal, but Western and
other diplomats said the Soviets favor more
time for peace efforts.
The draft resolution would authorize
"member states cooperating with the gov
ernment of Kuwait, unless Iraq on or
before Jan. 1 (15) 1991, fully implements
the foregoing resolutions (calling for with
drawal), to use all necessary means to
uphold and implement the Security Council
resolutions passed in response to Iraq's
invasion and occupation of Kuwait, and to
restore international peace and security."
The resolution text, obtained by The
Associated Press, says that despite all U.N.
efforts, "Iraq refuses to comply with its
obligation" to heed U.N. resolutions
demanding withdrawal from Kuwait "in
flagrant contempt of the council."
Foreign diplomats said they expect the
proposal to be amended before the vote this
week.
