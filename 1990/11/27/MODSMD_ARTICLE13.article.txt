# Matsushita buys MCA in Hollywood megadeal
## Firm pays $6.6 billion in largest Japanese purchase ever of a U.S. business

UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. (AP) -
The MCA conglomerate that gave
Americans "E.T.," Guns N' Roses and
"Murder, She Wrote" was purchased
in a $6.6 billion deal that firmly estab
lishes Japan's presence in Hollywood.
MCA Inc. was bought by Mat
sushita Electric Industrial Co. —
known as the maker of Panasonic,
Technics and Quasar products — in
the largest-ever purchase of a U.S.
company by a Japanese one.
The buyout accomplishes an objec

tive for Matsushita, which needed the
entertainment "software" of MCA to
complement its electronics "hard
ware" — the televisions, VCRs, radios
and stereos it makes.
The combination mirrors one
struck by Sony Corp., which bought
Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.
for $5 billion a year ago.
With MCA, Matsushita will try to
compete more effectively against its
archrival Sony and shake its image as
a copycat exploiting the technological

advances of other companies.
MCA, which began 65 years ago as a
booking agent for jazz bands, has
grown to become a colossus of films
(Universal Pictures' "E.T. the Extra-
Terrestrial," "Jaws," "Back to the
Future"), records (Reba McEntire,
Elton John, Guns N' Roses, Bobby
Brown, George Strait) and television
("Murder, She Wrote," "Mfyor Dad").
Its Universal Studios theme parks in
Florida and California are exceeded
only by Disney's.

"Software and hardware have been
developing simultaneously — they are
like wheels of the same car," Akio
Tanii, Matsushita's president, said at
company headquarters in Osaka,
Japan. "We intend that excellent
works made by MCA will be dis
tributed all over the world through a
variety of media."
Until the MCA deal, Sony's acquisi
tion of Columbia was tne largest
Japanese purchase of a U.S. business.
Sony also owns CBS Records.
