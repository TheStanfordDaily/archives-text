# Soviets to cut foreign aid, defense spending
## 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) - The Krem
lin said yesterday it wants to slash
foreign aid by 75 percent and
defense spending by 10 percent in
next year'B budget, which for the
first time makes a distinction
between national and republic
revenues.
Communist countries includ
ing Cuba, Vietnam, Ethiopia,
North Korea and Angola likely
would be hard hit by the cutback.
"We have a crisis in the man
agement system, instability is
besetting the economy in all
republics and the country as a
whole," First Deputy Prime Min
ister Yuri Maslyukov told the
Supreme Soviet legislature,
according to the official news
agency Tass.
Deputy Prime Minister Leonid
Abalkin also told the lawmakers
that real estate, stocks and cur
rency would be sold in the Soviet
Union for the first time next year.
The proposals illustrated the
government's pressing need to
reduce its budget in the face of
uncertain revenues from its frag
menting union. It also included an
assessment of the economy's
woes, including a projected budget
deficit this year of 56 billion
rubles ($lOO billion at the official,
but artificial exchange rate).
The lawmakers sent the pro
posal to committees for further
debate.
"Gratuitous assistance to for
eign countries will be cut by 75
percent as compared with the cur
rent year," Tass said.
Unofficial Soviet experts have
put that aid bill last year at $21.6
billion, with about one-quarter
going to Cuba, which is dependent
on tne Soviets for many goods,
including oil.
The Kremlin already has said
that in January it will begin
demanding pigment in convert
ible currency from its allies, who
until now have been charged low
"soft" currency rates for trade
with the Soviet Union.
The defense budget is to drop
to $116 billion next year, Tass
said. That would be roughly 40
percent of the proposed national
budget, which itself was projected
to be half of the union budget. The
officials gave no figure for defense
spending.

Soviet government bureau
cracy faces a 30 percent budget
cut, Tass reported. It offered no
details and exactly which agencies
would be hit was unclear.
The budget was divided for the
first time into national and repub
lic levels, "proceeding from the
new federation concept," Tass
said.
That concept is contained in
President Mikhail Gorbachev's
proposed new union treaty. The
document, now being considered
by the republic legislatures, would
hold the union together in a "vol
untary" federation, with Kremlin
control over military a flairs and
key industries.
Gorbachev needs the treaty to
maintain a uniform economic sys
tem while trying to appease inde
pendence movements that already
have paralyzed power between the
national and republic govern
ments.
At least six of the 15 republics
say they won't sign the treaty.
Under the proposed divided
national-republic budget, the cen
tral government's share of the
budget for 1991 would be $469 bil
lion, a bit less than half the total,
Tass said.
The Kremlin's 1991 deficit for
its share next year would be $23
billion, Tass reported.
Finance Minister Valentin
Pavlov said officials projected this
year's national deficit would be
$100 billion out of a budget of
$914.6 billion.
He said the Gross National
Product in the first nine months
of 1990 dropped by $23.4 billion
from the same period the previous
year, Tass said. The government
last month said the GNP — the
total value of the nation's annual
output of good and services — for
the period dropped 1.5 percent.
Tass said the budget proposed
temporarily freezing 50 percent of
the bank accounts of state-owned
businesses by Saturday, an appar
ent effort to cut the national
deficit and strengthen the ruble.
The government-run compa
nies could not use the money as
credit for borrowing, but could
transfer the funds to so-called
workers' collectives in the form of
"shares" in the companies, Tass
said.
