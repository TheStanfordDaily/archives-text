MONTERREY, Mexico (AP) — President
Bush, saying U.S.-Mexican relations "have
never been better," met with Mexican Presi
dent Carlos Salinas de Gortari yesterday for
talks the White House said focused on nego
tiating an end to trade barriers.
"Let's commence a new era for both our
nations," Bush said, addressing tens of
thousands of people at an evening welcom
ing ceremony in a plaza of this industrial city
in northern Mexico. Bush was here for two
days of talks.
"Viva Mexico!" Bush declared to cheers
that filled the large plaza.
A prospective U.S.-Mexican free trade
agreement, similar to one the United States
negotiated with Canada two years ago,
headed the agenda.
But the president also cited "challenges
in the world beyond our borders," particu
larly reconstruction in Central America
"and restoration of stability in the Persian
Gulf region."
Salinas has supported Bush's Persian
Gulf policy and has hinted he might send
troops to fight along with U.S. forces if the
United Nations agrees to a U.S.-backed reso
lution authorizing force against Iraq.
Mexico has also increased its oil produc
tion to help offset oil lost from Iraq and
Kuwait, boosting its exports to the United
States by 100,000 barrels a day. There are 42
gallons in each barrel.
"I've come to Mexico tonight with a mes
sage of respect .. . and hope for a brighter
future shared by our two countries," Bush
said. He called the ending of trade barriers
vital to both nations.
"I believe that U.S.-Mexican relations
have never been better," Bush said in his
first official visit as president.
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwa
ter said that, at their first session, the two
leaders focused on the proposed free trade

agreement.
"Both presidents are interested in pursu
ing the agreement as fast as possible and
attach high priority to its successful conclu
sion," Fitzwater said.
He said Bush and Salinas also talked

about increasing cooperation in the war
against drugs and working more closely to
end border violence.
Bush and Salinas discussed the situation
in El Salvador and agreed "to press for a
cease-fire."
