# Former S&L regulator says he was threatened
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The nation's for
mer chief S&L regulator testified yesterday
that his 1987 meetings with five senators, now
subjects of an ethics investigation, capped
"years of private threats" designed to stop
banking officials from curbing high-flying
thrill institutions.
Edwin Gray only had time to read a 13-page
opening statement at the Senate Ethics Com
mittee hearings into the five senators' ties to
former S&L operator Charles Keating Jr.
But he immediately set the stage for con
frontation with the senators by declaring that
he was trying to stop risky investments by
instutitions like Keating's failed Lincoln Sav
ings and Loan — while powerful politicians

were trying to stop him on Keating's behalf.
Gray did not go into details on the conduct
of the senators: Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.;
Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; John McCain, R-
Ariz.; John Glenn, D-Ohio, and Donald W.
Riegle Jr., D-Mich.
But his testimony starting today will be
crucial in determining whether the senators
made improper demands of regulators on
behalf of Keating, a political contributor to all
five.
Gray, former chairman of the Federal Home
Loan Bank Board, said that his meetings with
the five senators in April 1987, when they
intervened for Keating, "capped years of pri
vate threats and public vilification designed

not just to change particular decisions by the
bank board but to render us unable to carry
out our central responsibilities."
"No one in Washington with the slightest
knowledge of this issue can have been ignorant
of this situation or the effect it would have on
the way the regulators received and inter
preted messages from senators and congress

Gray is a crucial witness because of his
House Banking Committee testimony a year
ago that DeConcini offered a deal on Keating's
behalf when he, Cranston, Glenn and McCain
met with him on April 2, 1987. DeConcini has
vigorously denied proposing a deal.
