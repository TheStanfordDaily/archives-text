## Late night blues 
### 
AS DEAD WEEK approaches
students can look forward to
several sources of stress:
cramming 10 weeks of Shakespeare
and eight plays into a two-page
paper; trying to make up for sleep
ing in class and a dismal midterm
by slaying the fined; and struggling
to separate your chemical mixture,
identify the components, and then
form derivatives.
While some of this anxiety will
always loom at the end of each
quarter, there are some ways in
which stress can be avoided or
abated. A convenient place to buy
snacks and a good area to study
late into the night would signifi
cantly lessen pressure on students.
The demand for late night study
places and snack possibilities con
tinues to go unanswered, while sev
eral solutions seemingly go unno

ticed.
To start, the University could
reconsider the opening of Meyer
and Green Libraries later into the
night. By staggering the hours of
operation, enough time could be set
aside for workers to clean one
library while the other remains
open for use.
Similarly, Tresidder could be
kept open later, if just to serve as a
place with tables and chairs where
people can study. Schedules for
cleaning could be staggered.
In addition, keeping the
Tresidder Express open later into
the night would benefit students
greatly. The extra money needed to
keep the store open later would
surely be recouped from students
who would rather go to Tresidder
than order pizza or make a time
wasting trek to Safeway.
