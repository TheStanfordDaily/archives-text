IN TWO DAYS, THE FACULTY
Senate will vote on proposals
which would change the cur
rent distribution requirements.
The proposed changes would help
emphasize issues of race and gen
der.
For many, revamping the distri
bution requirement system will
have little effect. Graduate stu
dents and staff don't have any such
distribution requirements, and
undergraduates enrolled already
would still follow the current sys
tem.
Seemingly, there's little reason
to make a fuss about all of this
unless you care about what type of
education is produced here at
Stanford . . . and perhaps you
should.
An increase in the number of
distribution requirements could
mark a trend at Stanford toward a
more structured education. An

emphasis on race and gender issues
could serve as a new, decisive direc
tion for the University.
In addition, the proposed
amendments have the potential to
effect change beyond Palm Drive.
Other institutions acrosa the coun
try may follow suit.
The proposal by the Committee
on Undergraduate Studies would
stress race issues by adding a world
cultures requirement and an
American cultures requirement.
Also, an "asterisked" gender stud
ies requirement would have to be
fulfilled.
The Abernethy proposal would
remove the "asterisked" non-
Western requirement and add a
world cultures requirement.
Voice your opinion while you
can. Write letters and make phone
calls. The names of Faculty Senate
members are available through the
Academic Secretary's Office.
