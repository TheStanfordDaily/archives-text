# Actions likely won't be last

As a result of the budget reme
dies announced yesterday, the
University will likely escape this
year without a deficit. But Stan
ford's fiscal woes appear far from
over.
In an interview yesterday,
Provost James Rosse acknowl
edged that, due to national eco
nomic forces, the University's
most painful budget cuts may still
be on the way.
Around the beginning of
February, budget-planners will re
examine the University's "reposi
tioning" process. At that time,
"we'll make a decision as to
whether or not we'll have to do
more," Rosse said.
If additional cuts have to be
made, some academic programs —
which have remained almost
unscathed thus far — will likely
be placed on the chopping block.
If cuts are necessary, "we'll
have to reduce our ambitions in
regard to academic programs,"
Rosse said. "There's not a whole
lot of loose change sitting around
in support units."
A series of several unforeseen
external events, administrators
say, have had a near-crippling
effect on the University's finan
cial health. These include:

• Last fall's earthquake, which
caused millions of dollars worth of
damage;
• A change in the national
defense posture, resulting in
fewer research dollars flowing
into Stanford;
• The crisis in the Persian Gulf,
and the resulting effects on inter
est rates, the stock market and
the price of oil;
• The federal investigations of
Stanford's indirect cost policies,
resulting in a provisional indirect
cost rate that costs the University
tens of thousands of dollars a
month; and
• The budget impasse in
Congress, which delayed several
sources of federal funding to the
University.
"That's a long list of hits,"

Rosse said. "I don't expect the
world's going to collapse on us,
but we are going to have to pro
ceed with caution."
Administrators are especially
concerned about the health of
research at Stanford and the gov
ernment's willingness to support
the full costs of that research.
Indirect cost recovery from
research is the second-largest
income source for the University.
Furthermore, administrators
have pledged to keep increases in
tuition, the University's largest
revenue source, to a minimum.
"The conclusion is obvious,"
University President Donald
Kennedy told the Faculty Senate
earlier this year. "Help is not on
the way from the revenue side of
Stanford's budget."
