## Students should face the truth behind sleep deprivation 
### 
I AM WRITING THIS to take note of
the torrential outpouring of columns
related to my area of expertise: sleep
and its disorders.
First, there was Virginia Tsai's col
umn entitled "An Uncontrollable Sleep"
in the Oct. 8 Daily. I waited for weeks to
see if anyone would respond. In the col
umn, Tsai described herself as a very
sleepy person.
Her description should have rung a
bell in the heads of the more than 450
students who attended the Sleep and
Dreams course offered last winter quar
ter. It is difficult to believe that, of this
number, not one is a reader of The Daily
and its Opinions page; yet, no one
responded.
The second column, by Daniel Abbasi,
was entitled "Night People — Unite!"
and it appeared on Oct. 24. Abbasi very
correctly described the Delayed Sleep
Phase Syndrome which probably afflicts
half of the Stanford student body. Yet, no
one responded and my office received no
inquiries.
I would agree with Abbasi and would
further suggest that about half of the
Stanford courses now given in the morn
ing be shifted to the afternoon or
evening and that every attempt be made
to reduce noise pollution in the a.m.
Finally, a Health Tips column enti
tled, "Side and tired of school? Try get
ting more sleep" appeared on Nov. 7. The
headline, frankly, was more accurate
than the content.
At any rate last winter quarter I expli
cated in exquisite detail, with much repe
tition and passionate emphasis, what I
regarded as the most important principle
of the course, to wit: that the tendency
to sleep is a drive, that the strength of
the drive depends solely on prior sleep
deprivation and that falling asleep inap
propriately (I believe that falling asleep
whue studying is inappropriate) is prima
facie evidence that a person is sleep
deprived.

Falling asleep is not a talent. It is a condition, just like
being hungry because of food deprivation, or being
thirsty because of fluid deprivation.

In other words, falling asleep is not a
talent. It is a condition, just like being
hungry because of food deprivation, or
being thirsty because of fluid depriva
tion.
Unfortunately for human beings, a
heightened drive to sleep is either
extraordinarily hazardous, i.e., behind
the wheel of a car, or destructive in other
ways, such as falling asleep in class,
while reading, in nuclear power plants,
etc.
Scientific studies have shown that col
lege students are the second most sleep
deprived population in the United

States, the first being medical school
interns and residents. Such an extreme
sleep debt develops insidiously because of
ignorance.
College students do not know that:
• The need for sleep actually increases
from childhood to young adulthood;
• Sleep loss is cumulative;
• The sleep debt is only reversed by
sleep, and
• The way one feels at any particular
time may not accurately reflect their
underlying individual sleep debt and
degree of deprivation because the subjec
tive feeling is the instantaneous sum of

ongoing stimulation versus the degree of
sleep deprivation.
The foregoing important health facts
will be re-explained at great length in the
Sleep and Dreams course in the upcom
ing winter quarter. Sleepy people who
wish to understand themselves better
should plan now because last winter
quarter was a running battle with the
fire marshal about students sitting (or
perhaps sleeping) in the aisles.
With regard to Tsai, she may have
narcolepsy, but the odds are about 1 in
5,000. Sleep apnea, which is a major
cause of pathological sleepiness, tends to
afflict men (male/female ratio is 20:1).
By far the best possibility is that Tsai is
chronically sleep deprived.
We teach Sleep and Dreams in order
to inform undergraduates, not to grade
them. If, as the lack of response to any of
these three columns suggests, I have
failed to inform, then there is no point at
all. However, another possibility is that,
rather than reading The Daily, more peo
ple use it to wrap packages, recycle or
perhaps swathe their heads to muffle
early morning noises.
