Rabbit at Rest
By John Updike
Knopf, $21.95, 512 pages
Reviewed by Lee Newman
In John Updike's new novel "Rabbit at
Rest," Rabbit Angstrom once again
returns to the American public, this time
as an aging man. This realistic and touch
ing character must deal with his own fail
ing body and the possibility that along
with full service gas stations and his
mother's French toast, he too might
become part of the recent past.
Although Updike does create a strong ,
well-developed plot, "Rabbit at Rest"
actually becomes an internal dialogue for
Rabbit and the author. While external fac
tors, such as the death of his ex-lover and
his son's drug addiction, revolve around
Rabbit, the basic premise of the novel is
one man's perception of his changing
world.
Rabbit's dogged adherence to his
beliefs makes his adjustments to elderly
life difficult. He never considers himself
outdated, yet he resists the many changes
in his life. His gruff exterior also hides a
man who fears his growing unimportance
in this new modern world. These insecu
rities multiply as he becomes more aware
of his own mortality, especially after his
first heart attack.
Updike's strong character develop
ment creates a universal portrait from
which everyone can learn something.
Rabbit gives young readers insight into

middle age and older readers a slightly
amusing reflection of themselves. In fact,
the author's technique is so strong that
the reader seems to slip into the character
of Rabbit, absorbing his views and ideol
ogy for the duration of the novel.
Updike is so successful in his goal
because he has such a specific style. He
minutely describes each touch, taste,
smell or feeling to create vivid pictures for
the reader. Eating a Planter's Peanut Bar,
he describes trying to dislodge,"the sticky
brittle stuff, the carmelized sugar and
corn syrup from between his teeth." With
this kind of vivid imagery, the reader sees
the world as Rabbit experiences it.
The author also creates words and
phrases to express exact impressions. In
describing the same candy bar, Updike
says,"it is not so much the swallowing
and ingesting that he loves as the gritty
edgey feeling in his mouth, the first right
angled fragment slowly dissolving." He
splices words, such as grittyâ€”edgey,
together to form accurate descriptions of
universal sensations.
His eye for minute detail also extends
to product names. Updike seems fasci
nated by specific names and titles. He
never says, "Hand me the soap," but
rather, "Hand me the medium sized,
white bottle of Ivory." He chooses prod
ucts which the reader will instantly recog
nize, process, and form an image of. This
technique makes Rabbit's experiences
and commentary more believable.
While Updike's stylistic tools and
strong character development make this

novel definitely worth reading, the
author's portrayal of modern society is
also important. Rabbit's world is our
own, and this novel creates a miniature
replica of our lives, complete with drugs,
AIDS, cable television and Japanese cars.
"Rabbit at Rest" is an insider's por
trait of American culture, reflecting its
faults and treasures. This life is not one of
glamor, action or excitement. It is one of
mowing lawns and pot roasts, a comfort
ably familiar reality, which Rabbit gently
reminds us, is sometimes more interest
ing than exotic.

Lee Newman has fallen and could get up,
but simply refuses to.
