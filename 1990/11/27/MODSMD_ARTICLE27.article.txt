Cantor's Dilemma
By Carl Djerassi
Doubleday, $18.95, 230 pages.
Reviewed by Kecia Albright
Carl Djerassi's first novel is the
thoroughly captivating story of a
high-powered research scientist
and his breakthrough discovery,
which eventually wins him a
Nobel Prize. While ambition and
power politics constantly drive the
plot, Djerassi's characters show
humor, jealousy, affection and
warmth as well.
Professor I. Cantor (the I
stands for Isidore, which explains
why he goes by the initials 1.C.) is
a cancer researcher who has just
developed a new theory of tumor
ogenesis. In attempting to test his
hypothesis and confirm experi

mental results, he relies on post
doc Jeremiah Stafford, a similarly
driven scientist.
Ambition and egotism drive
Cantor and competing scientists
to race for results. This struggle
to prove something first leads to
subtle and not-so-subtle uses and
abuses of a power network in
which one hand washes the other.
The plot evolves, moving
adeptly from the realm of science
in Cantor's lab to the apartment
Stafford shares with his lover
Celly and her roommate Leah, to
Celly'B Aunt Paula's house. As the
action progresses, the characters'
lives become inextricably interwo
ven.
Djerassi's characters are highly
intelligent, highly cultured indi*
viduals. Dialogue is often verbal
jousting and a significant portion

of the time his characters interact
on a plane of abstract concepts
and erudite trivia.
Very clearly, these people are
meant to represent an intellectual
elite. The name dropping of
obscure literary theories or
authors could be seen as a snob
bish attempt on Djerassi's part to
gratify a pretentious readership.
His characters, however, go
beyond caricatures of academics.
Although devoted to their
work, the men and women
depicted in "Cantor's Dilemma"
also find time to be silly, preoccu
pied, irresponsible and loving. The
characters are made thoroughly
likable. Djerassi's thorough treat
ment of Celly, complete with many
flashbacks about her academic
and personal life, is especially
noteworthy.

Djerassi's characters
are highly intelligent,
highly cultured indi
viduals, and dialogue
is often verbal joust
ing.

In fact, unlike many works by
male writers where women are
relegated to the status of sex part
ner or nagging significant other,
this novel portrays strong women
favorably. Both Celly and Paula
are depicted as personally and sex*
ually assertive. Dr. Jean Ardley,
Celly'B mentor, is used as a means

of introducing the question of
women's acceptance in the scien
tific and academic communities.
Djerassi also portrays interper
sonal relationships well.
Celly and Stafford's relationship
in particular rings true; Djerassi
is able to realistically capture the
interactive dynamics of two ambi
tious young scientists with seem
ingly complementary personali
ties and goals, who nevertheless
experience uncertainties. Their
affection and concern for each
other show in their dialogue.
Through the well-drawn char
acters, Djerassi develops the
themes of egotism and hunger for
power. The lengths to which scien
tists will go, and how much
integrity they sacrifice; to
maintain their reputations is one
of the novel's central concerns.

The implications the answer to
this question has are enormous.
In modern society, complete faith
is placed in the purity and incor
ruptibility of science; a discredit
ing of this fundamental trust
would shake the very foundations
of our world view.
Admittedly, "Cantor's Dilem
ma" is not "great literature", nor
does it purport to be. However, it
does pose some questions that
should be contemplated. It is also
an engrossing, intelligent and
well-written tale of egos and
intrigue, love and mistrust. The
final plot twist is a surprising and
fitting ending.

Kecia Albright would Hlike to
thank Carlfyjtrassi, on bmhalf of
women everywhere, for his*contri
butions to modern science.
