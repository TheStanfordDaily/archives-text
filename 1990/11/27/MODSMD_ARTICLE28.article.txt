Although generally books pages review the latest
novels, we felt it our moral duty, since the consumer
season is approaching, to remind you of those great
British novelists who are assuredly available in
paperback.
Sadly, few people know the brilliant novelist
George Orwell through anything but his later works
such as "Animal Farm" or "1984," having never
experienced Orwell's earlier more entertaining
works.
From short stories about boarding school to tales
about the time he did as a plongeur in Paris, as
described in "Down and Out in Paris and London,"
Orwell's earlier books rank among the best biogra
phies ever penned.
EG. Wodehouse is another British novelist, per
haps one of the funniest. His tales of that bumbling
Bertie Wooster and his ever helpful manservant
Jeeves provide perfect light reading enjoyable to all
ages. His characters are so amusing that one who
has never delved into a Wodehouse novel knows not
what humor is.
For more reading enjoyable for the whole family,
James Heriot's novels should be opened up. Rue
fully, most people only know Heriot through the
BBC's "All Creatures Great and Small." Although a
great television show, Heriot's books describing his
life as a Yorkshire vet are both more plentiful and
more enjoyable than the series.
Alasdair Gray, even though Scottish, has a won
derfully distinct prose style which even incorporates
pictures when appropriate. Playing with mythology,
his short stories, "Mostly" both create new lore such
as "The Tale of The White Dog," and relie upon old
masters, incorporating old legends into his writing.
"His Decline of the Axle-Tree," for example, contains
an odd twist of EB. Shelly.
Anthony Burgess is another maestro of the writ
ten word. "A Clockwork Orange" is required mate
rial for any self-respecting college student, both as a
novel as well as Kubrik's cinematic masterpiece.
Burgess also excelled in writing "Earthly Powers,"
which has possibly the best opening line of a modern
novel.
Author of the acclaimed biography "T.S. Eliot"
and the forthcoming "Dickens," Peter Ackroyd is
also one of the best fiction writers around today. He
has a very special style, one that combines history
and storytelling to produces memorable, humorous
novels, including "Hawksmoore," "Chatterton" and
"First Light."
Graham Greene has established himself over the
course of several years as a premiere short-story
writer and novelist. "The Power and the Glory" is
one of his best, relating the dark story of a "whiskey
priest" in Mexico. Other works, including "Brighton
Rock" and "Our Man in Havana," seem to share a
sense of foreboding that Greene creates so well.
Another reputed short story teller is W. Somerset
Maugham. His collected short stories in four vol
umes are superb, and several of his novels are worth
a look, including "The Razor's Edge," "Lisa of Lam
beth" and "Of Human Bondage."
So look over to the other side of the Atlantic â€”
you artf'bound to come across something that is per
fect as a gift, or even something that is just right for
you. Trust us.
