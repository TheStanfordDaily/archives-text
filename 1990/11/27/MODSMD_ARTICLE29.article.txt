The Big Book for Peace
Edited by Ann Durell and
Marilyn Sachs
Dutton, $15.95,117 pages
The possibility of a war in the
Persian Gulf increases with
every passing day, but this spe
cial collection for children helps
give us at least an iota of hope
for the future. Several popular
children's authors and illustra
tors have contributed to this
diverse and enjoyable collection
of stories.
The message of this book is
apparent throughout, but
because it is presented in a vari
ety of ways it does not become
tedious. The collection manages
to span a wide spectrum of con
tent as well as presentation and
style. Peace and its implications

are presented on several differ
ent levels.
"I Was There" by Marilyn
Sachs is a poem that describes
the involvement of a child
protesting against the wrongs
that are present in society.
There are stories that are set
before a more traditional back
drop, dealing with thawing the
cold war for Siberian and
Alaskan Eskimoes in "There Is
an Island" by Jean Fritz.
Other stories deal with issues
of racial discrimination and
prejudice. "Letter from a Con
centration Camp" by Yoshiko
Uchido tells the story of the
treatment of Japanese Ameri
cans by the U.S. government
during World War Two. "The
Silent Lobby" by Mildred Pitts
Walter is a fictitious account of
an African-American demon
stration during the 1960'5.

Some of the entries in this
book are beautiful illustrations
accompanied by a few lines of
prose, as in "A Wild Safe Place"
by Maurice Sendak and "A
Ruckus" by Thatcher Hurd,
whereas other stories, like "The
Tree House" by Lois Lowry and
"A Midnight Clear" by Kather
ine Paterson rely more on clear,
effective dialogue for their
appeal.
Overall, this is an outstand
ing work, and definitely worth a
read, no matter what age group
you fall into.

"The Best of Lewis Carroll"
(Castle, 439 pages) is a great
book for children filled with the
most wonderful nonsense.
Truly a treasury of Lewis Car
roll, it contains his two Alice
stories as well as some of Car
roll's less well known stories.
It holds "The Hunting of the
Snark," a long flowing poem
with silliness oozing from its
stanzas, as well as Phantas
magoria, a collection of shorter
poems. It also has "A Tangled
Tale," an intense collection of
"knots," riddle-like puzzles
written in story form and hav
ing actual solutions.
The book ends magnificently
with actual letters from Lewis
Carroll to his young friends.
Evepr fan of Carroll should see
the intricate nonsense which he
so thoroughly displays master
ship of even in his daily corre
spondence.
"Esio Trot" (Viking) is a chil
dren's love story, written by
Roald Dahl. In the past Dahl
gave birth to those wonderfully
fascinating stories "Charlie and
the Chocolate Factory" and
"James and the Giant Peach,"
which few children ever forget,
even as they pass into adult
hood. With "Esio Trot," whose
title is derived by spelling tor
toise backwards, Dahl proves
that he retains his mystical abil
ity to produce timeless stories of
childhood.
"Land of The Long White
Cloud" (Arcade) consists of 21
tales that are about New
Zealand and its peoples. It is
written by world famous opera
singer Kiri Te Kanawa, and
illustrated by Michael Foreman.
