# Water use cut back
## 
### Peter J. Blum Staff writer 
Over two weeks have passed
since the San Francisco Water
District slapped the University
with its third fine in three months
for using too much water. During
this time, Stanford has taken sev
eral conservation measures, hop
ing not to exceed its December
allotment.
The University, which has gar
nered fines for overconsumption
totaling $209,000, began to
strengthen its conservation mea
sures Nov. 6 when it received a
$127,000 fine for the month of
October.
Stanford hopes to reduce its
consumption to the limit for
December by encouraging com
munity members to reduce water
usage and by restricting its own
use of water, according to David
Kaye, utilities manager at Opera
tions and Maintenance.
When fined, the University was
on a consumption pace of 85 mil
lion gallons of water per month,
although its November allotment
is only about 54 million gallons.
"We would have paid ten times
the normal price had we contin
ued our normal consumption,"
Kaye said.
Faced with another probable
fine for November if it did not cut
back consumption, Stanford
sought to cut its losses by supply
