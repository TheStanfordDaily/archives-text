# Water use cut back
## 
### Peter J. Blum Staff writer 
Over two weeks have passed
since the San Francisco Water
District slapped the University
with its third fine in three months
for using too much water. During
this time, Stanford has taken sev
eral conservation measures, hop
ing not to exceed its December
allotment.
The University, which has gar
nered fines for overconsumption
totaling $209,000, began to
strengthen its conservation mea
sures Nov. 6 when it received a
$127,000 fine for the month of
October.
Stanford hopes to reduce its
consumption to the limit for
December by encouraging com
munity members to reduce water
usage and by restricting its own
use of water, according to David
Kaye, utilities manager at Opera
tions and Maintenance.
When fined, the University was
on a consumption pace of 85 mil
lion gallons of water per month,
although its November allotment
is only about 54 million gallons.
"We would have paid ten times
the normal price had we contin
ued our normal consumption,"
Kaye said.
Faced with another probable
fine for November if it did not cut
back consumption, Stanford
sought to cut its losses by supply
ing about 25 percent of the cam
pus with water from one of its
three wells built in 1956. The Uni
versity will be operating a second
well in the near future and the
third one if the drought persists,
Kaye said.
Although Stanford owns the
well water, the cost of using it is
comparable to buying water from
the San Francisco Water District.
The University would not be
fined for excessive use of well
water, however, as it would for
exceeding its allotment from the
Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, located
near Yosemite National Park.
"We are making the effort to
bend the curve and reduce the
penalty for a couple of reasons,"
Kaye said. "First, we did not want
to draw another fine. And second,
we did not want to waste the
water of the Hetch Hetchy."
Since the severe conservation

measures took effect, Operations
and Maintenance has received
numerous complaints about water
quality.
Although the water is harder
and does not taste as good as that
of the Hetch Hetchy, it is checked
by a certified lab and is safe to
drink, Kaye said.
According to Kaye, the San
Francisco Water District has been
repairing pipes, and as a result,
certain segments of campus that
are not using well water are
encountering cloudy Hetch
Hetchy water.
In addition to switching to well
water on Nov. 6, the University
also halted all irrigation on cam
pus except in the Oval and the
Quad.
"Not watering the Oval would
cause damages that would be
extremely expensive to repair,"
Kaye told The Daily earlier this
month.
In the meantime, a water sys
tem retrofitting program in many
campus buildings has been inves

tigated since early last summer,
and in some instances is almost
near completion. The retrofitting
program installs and upgrades
water recycling equipment in labs
that use large amounts of water.
According to Kaye, the pro
gram has already provided savings
of nearly 600,000 gallons a year,
and when fully completed should
save approximately 25 million gal
lons each year.
Finally, Operations and Main
tenance is asking the Stanford
community to do the following to
conserve water:
• Go to car washes that use
recycled water instead of washing
cars on campus;
• While waiting for running tap
water to become hot, fill contain
ers with the warming water for
other uses;
• Install water-saving shower
heads and toilet devices; and
• Take shorter, water-conscious
showers.
