Oh my, that olde consumer season doth approach
when we all must pay our Yule tithe. Yet rest
assured, gentlefolks, for many a good book lie ready
to provide joy to the world for only a modest sum.
What price happiness? Only $8.95.
"Anybody's Bike Book," (Ten Speed Press) for
example, will mollify the pain hordes experience
daily due to intransigent bicycles like mine who've
decided they like the static state. Besides being quite
helpful to cool people riding one, three, or 10 speeds,
this classical fix-it book's new incarnation details the
maintenance of mountain bikes as well, so you in the
neon mountain bike crowd can start dancing.
"Anybody's Bike Book" is exactly what its title
suggests. Its pages contain general information
about bikes plus simple easily implementable
instructions on general repairs. This book can help
us poor ignorant souls understand those nasty cries
our bicycles make before time runs out, and our
wheels stop turning.
Also, illustrations abound within the book.
Straightforward pictures simplify repairs and allevi
ate the grief of finding out where in the book you
should be looking when you are clueless as to the
name of that odd shaped piece which broke yester
day. This is a generally useful book.
Looking for something a bit lighter? "It's here!
The modern marketing miracle you've been waiting
for."
"Not Available in Any Store" (Pantheon), a new
book by Richard Rosen and Steve Vance provides
"The complete catalog of the most amazing products
never made."
Rosen, who has written for and appeared in Sat
urday Night Live and Not Necessarily the News,
combines with Vance, a successful illustrator and
writer who co-authored "The Postcards that Ate my
Brain" with Matt Groening, to produce a book chock
full of joke ads for nonexistent products. This kind
of book you shouldn't read on busses or trains, to
avoid having everyone stare at you, wondering to
themselves which sanitarium you've just escaped
from since you're continuously laughing so hard.
One ad is for "The Man-On-The-Street Institute,"
which can get you on T.V in no time at all. "We'll
teach you generic responses to any natural catastro
phe, such as 'First there was this, uh, like this blind
ing flash, and then sort of a terrific rumble.'"
In "Not Available in any Store," illustrations
complement the products, beautifully lampooning
our society and its advertising by describing absurd
products which would be perfect for us.
Not quite $8.95, you'll find Charles Addams' "My
Crowd" (Simon and Schuster) worth the two extra
bucks. Addams was a famous cartoonist whose mas
terful macabre comics often lightened the New
Yorker's pages. It is from Addams' work that the
television Addams Family comes. Addams' one
panel illustrations, which Gary Larson's Far Side
greatly resembles, subtly perturb normal situations
achieving hilarious results which aren't always read
ily apparent. "My Crowd" will definitely appeal to
fans of that masterful illustrator Edward Gorey as
well. Addams' cartoons are definitely a must see.
