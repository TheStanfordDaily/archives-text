## Wrestlers take on S.F. State tonight 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
After a narrow and disap
pointing loss, the Cardinal
wrestling team is getting
exactly what it wants: another
chance to compete.
Stanford opened its season
with a close defeat to regional
rival Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo
less than two weeks ago, but
will have a chance to even their
record tonight at Burnham
Pavilion. At 7:30 p.m. the Car
dinal will take on San Fran
cisco State in preparation for
the big Las Vegas Invitational
this weekend.
"I'd think the only way we'd
lose is if we look past them to
the tournament we're compet
ing in this weekend, the Las
Vegas Invitational," coach
Chris Horpel said. "It's the sec
ond-biggest tournament of the
year, behind NCAAs, and we're
really looking forward to it. I'm
trying to get them to look at
this dual meet as a good tune
up for the Invitational."
Stanford, with what could
be the strongest team the
school has had in many years,
is trying to prepare for the
Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships and the NCAA Cham
pionships during winter quar
ter. But the team should face a
good test in the Division II
Gators, who have a lot more

competition under their belts
this year.
"This will be about their
fifth or sixth meet already and
this is our second," Horpel
said. "I don't know if that's
good or bad. Usually if you
compete that often in a short
Eeriod of time you get a little
anged up, but maybe they
aren't and so they're a little
more experienced. I don't
know."
The top wrestler for San
Francisco State was the Divi
sion II heavyweight champion
for last year, but Horpel is not
sure if he'll compete due to the
differing eligibility rules
between Division II and the
Pac-10. Horpel does, however,
expect to see a very good match
at 150 pounds.
There Stanford's Dave
Sacks will meet Eustacio Tor
res. Sacks is one of the Cardi
nal's top wrestlers and com
peted at the U.S. Olympic Festi
val over the summer. Torres,
on the other hand, spent his
summer training with some of
the top wrestlers in South
America.
Despite this, Horpel feels
confident entering the meet.
"I'm hoping to win about seven
of the 10 weight classes,'' he
said, although he went on to
say that this meet is not as
important as the competitions
the squad has upcoming.
