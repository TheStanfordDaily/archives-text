# The 						best
## Oden named Pac-10 Player of the Year 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Being placed on the All-Pacific
10 Conference team might serve
as a satisfying way to end the sea
son for many a volleyball player.
For three members of the Stan
ford Cardinal, however, it was
merely a nice appetizer en route to
this week's main course — the
NCAA tournament and a chance
to win a national title.
Juniors Kristin Klein and Amy
Cooper were placed on the all
league team for the third and sec
ond times respectively. But sopho
more Bev Oden grabbed the
biggest honor as she was named
the conference's player of the
year. The self-effacing superstar
downplayed the award in typical
fashion.
"I was really excited about it,"
she said. "[But] I wasn't really
expecting it." Oden thought
UCLA's Jenny Evans or Natalie
Williams would be tabbed for the
honor. But voters were hard
pressed to look past her .337 hit
ting percentage and 4.52 kill aver
age, the latter being good enough
for 18th in the nation.
Oden credited her successful
year to dedication in the offsea
son. "I worked on my entire game
over spring training," she said. "I
concentrated on who I was on the
court instead of being afraid."
Klein, who was selected to the
All-Pac-10 team for the third
straight year, said it's simple who
Oden is. "I don't think there's any
doubt (she's the league's best
player)," Klein said. "She's having

a great year."
For her own part, Klein said,
"Obviously, I'm excited."
Both, however, were more
excited about the prospect of play
ing Wyoming at Burnham Pavil
ion Thursday. The teams met in
the NCAA tournament in 1989
where the Cowgirls eliminated the
Cardinal in a heartbreaking five
game match.
"We're ecstatic we have
another chance at them," Oden
said. "We played terrible (the last
time). It was a bad year and a per
fect way to end it," she added
wryly.
Klein said the opportunity for
revenge "makes it even sweeter"
to be playing in the postseason.
She noted, however, that this first
playoff match was just one small
step toward the team's goal of a
national championship.
Cooper's return to the all-con
ference team puts a stamp on her
"comeback" year. After a sensa
tional freshman campaign, ir\jury
and other troubles led her to a
subpar sophomore season. In
1990, the junior has played
superbly, posting a .367 hitting
percentage, best in the confer
ence.
"She took over where she left
off freshman year," Klein said.
"She's helped our team tremen
dously this season after an 'off
year.'"
California's Cara Dane was
named the freshman of the year
and Arizona State's Patti Snyder
and Oregon State's Guy Enriques
were named co-coaches of the
year.

Watching her play, it seems obvious that sophomore Bev Oden is
often head and shoulders above everyone else on the court. The
Pac-10 office honored Oden by naming her the league Player of the
Year yesterday. Juniors Amy Cooper and Kristin Klein joined her on
the all-conference squad.
