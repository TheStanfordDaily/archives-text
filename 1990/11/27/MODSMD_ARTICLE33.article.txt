# The
						NCAA is too busy counting dollars to have any sense
## 
### 
It finally happened. I guess it was
inevitable; after all, we're living in an
age when many student-athletes can't
spell "GPA" and many others can't count
to 700. In fact, it's surprising this hasn't
happened sooner, considering the dunder
heads involved.
I'm talking, of course, about the
geniuses at the NCAA. Apparently some
thing screwy is going on with these folks,
because after years of ineptitude — let's
remember, these are the people who bring
you the mythical national football cham
pionship — they seem to have finally gone
off the deep end:
The NCAA has forgotten how to count.
I know, it may be too much for us to
ask, but you'd think that people who live
for TV money would at least be able to
keep their numbers straight. Specifically,
it seems the numbers "2" and "3" are the
ones giving the wonderkids problems. As
in who happens to be the No. 2 women's
volleyball team in the country and who
happens to be No. 3.
All right, at first glance this doesn't
seem to be an earth-shattering issue — at
one time or another, I'm sure we've all
had our doubts about the NCAA's cere
bral capacities — but this time things
seem different. Maybe it's because of the
stench.
Here's the deal: At the end of the regu
lar volleyball season the NCAA poll had
UCLA ranked No. 1, Nebraska at No. 2
and Stanford at No. 3. No one had any
trouble with UCLA on top, because the
Bruins are 31-1 and haven't lost since
early September. Two of those 31 wins
came against Stanford.
Next came Nebraska at No. 2. The
Huskers are the only team to beat UCLA

(they did it back in the first week of the
season), they have a road win against
Hawaii (the same week) and have beaten
Texas and Illinois, who were both ranked
in the top 10 at the time of the match.
(The top 10 may seem like a big deal, but
there's a serious drop in talent after No.
6. How serious? Imagine jumping off the
Eiffel Tower.)
The Huskers only have two losses this
year: Against the University of the
Pacific, early last month ... and against
some other team from Northern Califor
nia. I can't seem to remember who right
now.
Anyway, Stanford comes in at No. 3.
The Cardinal, like the Huskers, has
beaten Texas and Illinois. Stanford has
three losses — the two to UCLA and one
to UOP — compared to Nebraska's two,
so it makes perfect sense that the
Huskers are ranked ahead of the Cardi
nal, right?
Sure, if you want to completely forget
what happened back on Ortober 12 at
Maples Pavilion. Nebraska was in town
for the Stanford Invitational. At the time,
the Huskers were ranked No. 2 and the
Cardinal was way down at No. 6, thanks
to back-to-back losses to UCLA and UOP
three weeks earlier.

Of course, the match was a blowout.
Not even close. The better team wiped the
other one off the court and into the near
est dumpster, proving that polls know
almost as much about volleyball as a typ
ical s ports writer:
Stanford. 15-8, 15-10, 15-8.
Now, I don't know much about vol
leyball, but I do know a few basic
rules:
(1) You should probably hit the ball
over, and not under, the net;
(2) You should probably hit the ball
fewer than four times before getting it
over;
(3) When Stanford's Bev Oden hits the
ball at you, you should probably get the
hell out of the way; and
(4) When you win 15-8, 15-10 and 15-8
it's usually because you're just a wee bit
better than the other guys.
It seems like no big deal, of course —
after all, what's the big difference
between second and third? It just means
the two teams go to different regions in
the playoffs, right?
Well, in a normal world — i.e. one not
run by the NCAA — it wouldn't really
matter. Unfortunately....
The NCAA women's volleyball tourna
ment, unlike the men's basketball tour
ney (and all sane playoff formats), is
seeded regionally. What that means is
that certain teams are placed in certain
regions regardless of their records. Stan
ford and UCLA are always in the West
region. Pacific and Hawaii are always in
the Northwest. Nebraska is always in the
Mideast, and Texas is always in the
South.
This may seem a little stupid, but . ..

oh, hell, let's face it: It's extremely stupid.
My guess is it's split up this way to make
sure different regions of the country are
represented in the Final Four.
That may sound like a great idea, but
in the nine years of the NCAA tourna
ment only one non-West (California and
Hawaii) team has won the title: Texas, in
1988. Basically the format usually lets
two not-so-great teams make the Final
Four, while the best teams in the country
have to play each other in earlier rounds.
There's only one way to get out of the
play-who's-in-your-region format: If two
teams from the same area — say, UCLA
and Stanford — are ranked first and sec
ond in the country, the second-ranked
team will be sent to another, weaker
region to set up a showdown in the NCAA
final.
Is this becoming a little clearer? If not,
let's see if we can get to the heart of it: If
Stanford were at No. 2 right now, the Car
dinal would have been sent to the South
region, which right now consists of Texas
and seven bad jokes. Since the tourna
ment committee decided to seed Stanford
third, the Cardinal has to stay in the West
— and beat UCLA at UCLA — just to get
to the Final Four.
The decision also means that Texas
has a free ride to the Final Four. And, hoo
boy, guess who happens to be a member of
the tournament committee, which
decides who plays where:
Texas coach Mick Haley.
Does anyone else smell something?
I sure did, so I decided to see what Mick
had to say about the whole situation. I
got his office number from The
Daily's handy Directory of College Athlet

ics (wanna call Lou Holtz?) and away we
went, investigative-journalist like:
"Texas women's athletics."
"Hi. Is Mick in?"
"I'm sorry, he's at practice."
A likely story. "Do you know when he'll
be back?"
"Well, they finish around 4, but he
never comes back to the office afterward."
"Nuts. I don't suppose you can give out
his home number, huh?"
"Nope.**
Strike one.
Never one to just give up — well, at
least not without a good reason — I tried
to get in touch with Christine Hoyles,
who was the chair of the tournament
committee. Christine works at the Pacific
10 Conference office, so I gave them a
call.
"Pacific 10 Conference."
"Hi. Is Christine Hoyles in?"
"No, I*m sorry, she's out."
"Swell. When do you expect her back?"
"Thursday."
Strike two.
I'd had enough with the small fry. It
was time to head straight to the top! I was
going to be heard, dammit!
President Bush wasn't in, so I placed a
call to the NCAA office in Shawnee Mis
sion, Kansas. After one wrong number,
two transfers, three "please holds" and
one "Can she call you back?", I finally got
to talk to Donna Noonan, the NCAA's
assistant director of women's champi
onships.
Donna didn't want to offer her own
opinion on the seeding, but was more
than happy to give the committee's offi-
