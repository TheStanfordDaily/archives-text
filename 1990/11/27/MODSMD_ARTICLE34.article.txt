# Ultimate team splits

### Michelle Ghert Staff writer 
The Stanford men's ultimate
frisbee team opened its season
with a 2-2 performance at the Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo Invitational
Tournament. Posting impressive
wins against UC-Davis and Los
Positos College, Stanford was in
turn defeated by Cal Poly-SLO
and by the defending national
champion team from UC-Santa
Barbara.
"The best teams on the West
Coast were there," team president
Neil Mahutte said. "It's so early
on in the season that the results of
the tournament don't really pre
dict the year's outcome."
The Cardinal, however, consid
ers the results of the tournament
very encouraging in light of the
fact that of the 21 Cardinal play
ers who traveled to San Luis
Obispo, only eight had previous
playing experience.
The very young Cardinal squad
will have the bulk of its season in
the spring. The team is expecting
to remain the West Coast under
dogs in the early part of the sea
son but predicts a significant
improvement by the end of the
year.
"At this point we are the under
dog," Mahutte said. "But Stan
ford has always been strong and
will be in a position to surprise
people."

Lacrosse
In a preseason scrimmage
against California last Friday, the
Stanford men's lacrosse team
came up short to the California
Golden Bears with a 14-5 final
score.
"It was our first game and their
fifth of the season," Greg Fowlkes
said. "They were a lot more orga
nized than we were."
Stanford is still in preseason
mode but in January will begin
practicing full swing to prepare
for the winter-spring competitive
season.
Despite the loss, Stanford put
in some good individual perfor
mances. Curt Cetrullo was the top
Cardinal scorer with two goals.
Teammates Fowlkes, Alex Perkins
and Brad Winters followed with
one goal each. Fowlkes describes
goalie Dan Garza's performance
as "brilliant at times."
Card notes
The Stanford ice hockey team was
undefeated against California two
weekends ago. The two-game series
began in front of Stanford's largest
home crowd ever aa the Cardinal iced
the Bears 6-3. Tim Westergrln and
Jenko Hwong had two goals each for
Stanford. Saturday at Calfornia, Stan
ford foreshadowed Big Game with a
game-winning goal by freshman
Corey Sammona with 27 seconds
led on the clock.
