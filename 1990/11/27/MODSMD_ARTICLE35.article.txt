# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
One team came oh-so-close to capturing a
national title; the other found a bit of tar
nish on its championship crown as it began
its 1990-91 campaign. And while their bit
tersweet defeats were hardly as tasty as the
weekend's turkey and sweet potato, water
polo's Rick McNair and women's basket
ball's Trisha Stevens nevertheless found
the recipe for Athlete of the Week honors.

Stevens, a 6-foot-3 senior from Philo
math, Ore., has rarely stepped onto the
hardwood since helping the Cardinal win its
first-ever NCAA championship last spring in
Tennessee's Thompson-Boling Arena.
The center had surgery on both knees
after the season ended and did not recover as
quickly as she had hoped. As a result,
Stevens missed most of fall practice and
many doubted she would be ready for Sun
day's opener against the Lady Vols on the
very same floor she last played.
So all Stevens did was score 28 points
against Tennessee. Once again, she was
Stanford's prime-time player and helped
prevent a 95-80 shellacking from becoming a
runaway rout.

McNair, a 6-5 senior holeman from
Lafayette, Calif., scored eight goals in three
games as he and the Cardinal mounted a
valiant drive for their first NCAA title since
1986.
In the tournament opener against Air
Force Friday, McNair tallied three scores as
the Cardinal routed the servicemen 14-6.
The next day, he again recorded a hat trick
as second-seeded Stanford took down third
rated UC-Santa Barbara 9-7.
That victory set up a showdown with top
ranked California, which had trounced the
Cardinal just a week earlier in the Big
Splash.
When the Golden Bears moved ahead 7-3
it seemed like another trampling was afoot.
But McNair and his mates came charging

back. As the third period ended, Colin Keely
found McNair amid a tangle of players in
front of the goal.
McNair reached up above everyone,
tipped the ball, disappeared underwater,
resurfaced and scored — all in the blink of
an eye — to make it 8-6 California. Stanford
scored once more but was unable to find the
goal again despite having a number of oppor
tunities in the closing seconds.
