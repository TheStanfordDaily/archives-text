Texas Sigma Nu's
suspended
The University of Texas
chapter of the Sigma Nu frater
nity has been suspended
because of an alleged weekend
hazing incident in which a
pledge claims to have been
beaten and subjected to other
forms of harassment, Univer
sity officials said Nov. 15.
The mother of the pledge
said her son "was beaten with a
broomstick, walked on by fra
ternity members wearing
boots, and that fraternity
members led him around the
room by some kind of cloth
wrapped around his testicles."
The incident comes less
than three months after the
fraternity ended a yearlong
probation because it required
pledges to steal lumber from a
construction site in September
1989.

Duke students debate
conservative agenda
Faculty members and stu
dents at Duke University
debated the agenda of the Duke
chapter of the National Associ
ation of Scholars, a national
organization that advocates a
traditional Western curricu
lum.
Michael Gillespie, an
English professor and propo
nent of the association, said the

group focuses on three areas:
protecting freedom of speech,
debating the necessity of an
anti-harassment code and
maintaining a traditional cur
riculum.
Some students said the prin
ciples in the association's char
ter are threatening to women
and students of color, while
others said the labeling of the
organization's supporters as
sexist, racist and homophobic
only serves to to obstruct open
discussion.

Amherst dissolves
ROTC ties
Amherst College decided on
Nov. 14 to sever its ties with
the Reserve Officer Training
Corps at the University of Mas
sachusetts because the pro
gram excludes gays and les
bians.
Only eight Amherst stu
dents are involved in the ROTC
program, and their status will
not be affected because the
University will continue to
accept scholarship money from
ROTC for those students.
Beginning next year, stu
dents enrolled in ROTC will
not be able to receive Amherst
credit for military science
classes taken at Mas
sachusetts. In addition, schol
arship money from the Depart
ment of Defense will not be
accepted.
