# Impact study ordered
## P.A. firm to evaluate Sand Hill extension 
### Marie Bui Staff writer 
Last week, the Palo Alto City
Council awarded a contract to a
San Francisco firm to produce an
environmental impact report on
the possible extension of Sand Hill
Road.
The company, Environmental
Impact Planning Associates, has
already produced two reports on
the proposed construction.
Palo Alto will pay the firm
$275,000 to investigate the
impact of building a road on Stan
ford property that winds by the
San Francisquito Creek and the
Stanford Shopping Center to El
Camino Real.
Consultants from the firm will
consider the impact of several
options facing the Palo Alto City
Council: no construction; building
either a two- or a four-lane road
from Sand Hill to Quarry Road or
Palm Drive; or building public
transit that would decrease the
need for the road.
The report is expected to be
completed within 10 months, but
any construction would probably
not begin for at least a year and a
half.
Stanford will reimburse Palo
Alto for the full cost of the report,
unless the city rejects the project
after the report is issued. In that
case, Palo Alto has agreed to pay
one half of the cost of preparing
the study.
Palo Alto, and not Stanford,
will deal directly with the consul

tants due to a recent recommen
dation from the state government,
which has required environmen
tal impact reports before con
struction since 1970. The study is
more likely to be objective if a pub
lic agency is responsible for pay
ment, rather than the developer,
according to Marvin Overway,
chief transportation official for
Palo Alto.
Tony Badger, leader of Neigh
bors Against Sand Hill Expansion,
disagreed. Since Palo Alto agreed
to pay one half the expense only if
the project is abandoned, the city
has reason to push the project to
succeed. Badger calls the deal a
"tremendous mistake" on Palo
Alto's part.
Russell Faure-Brac from the
environmental firm said it is "not
important to us who our client is
on the job," because the report is a
legal document and the firm is
non-partisan. He said this is "one
of the longer-lasting" controver
sial projects the firm has handled.
A 1975 report on the Sand Hill
project done by the consulting
firm was paid for by the city of
Palo Alto. Stanford commissioned
the company again for the same
project in 1984.
In addition to the cost of the
latest report, the University will
have to pay the legal fees if the
report is contested, according to
Andy Doty, director of community
relations in the Office of Public
Affairs.
