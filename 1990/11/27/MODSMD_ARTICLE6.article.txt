# Karl raises campus awareness of Latin American issues
## 
### Samantha Sherman Staff writer 
As Terry Karl, the new director of the Stanford
Center for Latin American Studies, appeared in the
hall of Bolivar House, an over-zealous dog came
dashing in to join her.
"I'm sorry," said the director. "Deli isn't here
every day."
In addition to her role as center director, Karl is
an associate professor of political science, author,
fund-raiser, adviser and member of the Latin Amer
ica Panel at the Center for Overseas Studies among
other things — in short, an extraordinarily busy
woman.
Yet Karl makes sure she still has time to chat with
her colleagues, advise her students and take in an
occasional stray animal. Deli, for example, was
adopted by Karl after she saw it roaming hungrily
for three days outside of a delicatessen, hence the
name.
But sweeping gestures of humanity are the norm
and not the exception for Karl, whom History Prof.
Stephen Haber repeatedly praised as "an extremely
decent human being."
Latin American Studies administrator Jutta
Mohr regards her in the same light. "She is a feeling,
compassionate individual," Mohr said.
Indeed, it is her remarkable sense of compassion
which compelled Karl to pursue a career in Latin
American studies.
Karl first visited an underdeveloped country
when she went to Mexico in 1972 to aid in the trans
lation of a children's book she had written.

"Students are always happy to hear my under
graduate work in literature has nothing to do with
what I'm doing now," the Stanford graduate said
with a laugh.
But taking a more serious tone, Karl recalled her
reaction to Mexico. Having only previously traveled
in industrialized countries, she had never been con
fronted with the harsh realities of poverty and
underdevelopment — the children on the streets
begging in the cold, uneducated and hungry.
She then decided to come back to Stanford where
she soon completed a master's and a doctoral degree
in political science.
She has since lived in Venezuela and various
countries in the Caribbean and Central America, and
has held teaching positions at UC-Berkeley and Har
vard.
"I feel very strongly about teaching and advising
theses," Karl said.
"[Teachingl is a way of communicating the deep
interconnection that exists between all of us. Latin
American problems translate into the United States
as drug trade, refugee and environmental concerns.
Their issues must be our issues," she stressed.
Karl won the 1989 Dean's Award for Distin
guished Teaching, and was also nominated for a
Gores Award for Excellence in Teaching for 1989-90.
"The students all rave about her," Haber said in
reference to her advisees.
It is easy to see why. "She's one of the more engag
ing people around here," according to University

Terry Karl is the new director of the Stanford Center for Latin American Studies. Among other activities,
Bolivar House, where the center Is located, sponsors talks and hosts visiting professors.
President Emeritus Richard
Lyman, who is currently the
director of the Institute for Inter
national Studies at Stanford.
Karl plans her classes so the
material is coordinated with her
research findings. Both her writ
ing and her teaching focus on
three central areas of interest:
United States policy toward Cen
tral America, problems of Third
World countries in transition to
democracy and the sources of
poverty in developing countries.
Her most recent work is titled
"The Paradox of Plenty." The
book, due out in 1991 from the
University of California Press,
examines the impact of oil booms
on exporting countries.
"Terry makes Stanford a much
more lively place intellectually
than if she were not here," Haber
said.
In addition to her work at
Stanford, Karl continues to
accompany Congressional delega
tions to Central America, which
she has done since 1983.
"I also do a lot of work with
refugees," said Karl. "And I love
to garden, but I almost never have
the chance," she quickly added.
Considering the goals she has
set for the Latin American center
and her accomplishments so far,
gardening will understandably sit
on the back burner for a while.
As director, Karl supervises a
considerably large operation. The
center grants an interdisciplinary
undergraduate degree as well as a
master's. However, it has no full

time faculty, as they are all mem
bers of specific academic depart
ments. Almost 100 professors
teach through the center.
When combined with the staff
across the Bay, the number grows
larger. Bolivar House, which
houses the center, works in con
junction with a similar center at
UC-Berkeley, allowing students to
draw on a greater pool of exper
tise.
Karl has already done a lot of
work to encourage the develop
ment of new research interests.
Douglas Murray, a Mac Arthur
fellow and a Fulbright recipient
who is examining the effects of
pesticides in Latin America, and
Rudolpho Stavenhagen, a Ful
bright scholar and Tinker visiting
professor who specializes in prob
lems of ethnicity and human
rights, have both been invited to
the center to share their scholarly
pursuits.
In addition, the center orga
nizes talks on subjects related to
Latin America every Wednesday.
An accomplished fund-raiser,
Karl designed the Knowles Fund,
a $100,000 endowment to help
graduate students conduct
research exploring Latin Ameri
can gender issues.
For Karl, an important feature
of conducting research is the link
it provides between the scholar
and the real world. She believes
community outreach programs
add to one's academic experience
and ought to be undertaken by
the center.
To this end, Karl started a
refugee project which sent Stan
ford students to the Mexican bor
der to interview children sent
across without their parents who

'What made those deaths so special...
is that these are people just like me.
They had strong conceptions of social
justice and negotiations, and this is
exactly why they were killed.'

are now held in detention centers
by the Immigration and Natural
ization Service.
Karl has worked with the Stan
ford Program in International
and CrosB-Cultural Education to
develop a curriculum for public
schools that reflects an awareness
of international issues, and she
hopes to provide similar opportu
nities to students.
"I have a lot of different kinds
of responsibilities," said Karl,
"but I have a wonderful staff
here."
Kathleen Morrison, the cen
ter's new assistant director, has a
doctorate in education and is a
specialist on Chilean education, a
definite asset considering the
development of a new Stanford
campus in Santiago.
Karl was on the panel set up by
Overseas Studies to structure a
program in Chile. Panelists were
asked for their input regarding
possible location, curriculum and
faculty, as well as how to best
develop ties in Chile.
When tisked about her partici
pation in "Death and Rebirth in
El Salvador," a vigil held Nov. 15
commemorating the deaths of six
Jesuit priests and two staff mem
bers of the Universidad Centro
Americana, Karl became lost in
thought. A difficult subject Karl

settled into her chair and began:
"It was particularly shocking
for me personally because I had
worked with [three of] these
priests throughout the '80s. They
had been nominated as Tinkers at
Stanford .. . and were exceptional
scholars and teachers.
"I first met Ignacio Martin-
Baro in 1979. We called him
Father Nacho. In his last conver
sation with me he said, 'You have
to cut aid. Those guns are aimed
at us.'
"They were killed by a U.S.-
trained and financed brigade, and
Army Major Eric Buckland said
that he and the Embassy had
prior knowledge but made no
effort to stop [the shooting]. The
story is so ugly.
"What made those deaths so
special to me and have such an
impact is that these are people
just like me. They had strong con
ceptions of social justice and nego
tiations, and this is exactly why
they were killed. They were the
most effective spokespeople for
peace."
Having ignored her first two
phone calls during the interview,
Karl could not deny a third. She
apologized profusely, and, as most
people in such demand do, van
ished.
