# Karl raises campus awareness of Latin American issues
## 
### Samantha Sherman Staff writer 
As Terry Karl, the new director of the Stanford
Center for Latin American Studies, appeared in the
hall of Bolivar House, an over-zealous dog came
dashing in to join her.
"I'm sorry," said the director. "Deli isn't here
every day."
In addition to her role as center director, Karl is
an associate professor of political science, author,
fund-raiser, adviser and member of the Latin Amer
ica Panel at the Center for Overseas Studies among
other things — in short, an extraordinarily busy
woman.
Yet Karl makes sure she still has time to chat with
her colleagues, advise her students and take in an
occasional stray animal. Deli, for example, was
adopted by Karl after she saw it roaming hungrily
for three days outside of a delicatessen, hence the
name.
But sweeping gestures of humanity are the norm
and not the exception for Karl, whom History Prof.
Stephen Haber repeatedly praised as "an extremely
decent human being."
Latin American Studies administrator Jutta
Mohr regards her in the same light. "She is a feeling,
compassionate individual," Mohr said.
Indeed, it is her remarkable sense of compassion
which compelled Karl to pursue a career in Latin
American studies.
Karl first visited an underdeveloped country
when she went to Mexico in 1972 to aid in the trans
lation of a children's book she had written.

"Students are always happy to hear my under
graduate work in literature has nothing to do with
what I'm doing now," the Stanford graduate said
with a laugh.
But taking a more serious tone, Karl recalled her
reaction to Mexico. Having only previously traveled
in industrialized countries, she had never been con
fronted with the harsh realities of poverty and
underdevelopment — the children on the streets
begging in the cold, uneducated and hungry.
She then decided to come back to Stanford where
she soon completed a master's and a doctoral degree
in political science.
She has since lived in Venezuela and various
countries in the Caribbean and Central America, and
has held teaching positions at UC-Berkeley and Har
vard.
"I feel very strongly about teaching and advising
theses," Karl said.
"[Teachingl is a way of communicating the deep
interconnection that exists between all of us. Latin
American problems translate into the United States
as drug trade, refugee and environmental concerns.
Their issues must be our issues," she stressed.
Karl won the 1989 Dean's Award for Distin
guished Teaching, and was also nominated for a
Gores Award for Excellence in Teaching for 1989-90.
"The students all rave about her," Haber said in
reference to her advisees.
It is easy to see why. "She's one of the more engag
ing people around here," according to University
