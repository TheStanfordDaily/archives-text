# Escondido repairs only 'cosmetic'

Earthquake repairs in Escondido Village have
stirred complaints from many residents who call the
construction unnecessary, inconvenient, a security
risk and an invasion of privacy.
Most of the damage in the apartments comes
from last October's 7.1 earthquake.
"We had four hairline cracks and one cracked
bathtub tile," said Escondido resident Brenda Rush
ing, a graduate student in biology. Her husband
Rhett, an engineer, said he has been watching the
repairs, which he called "incredibly cosmetic."
"They are not structural at all. Nothing [the
workers] are doing will increase or add to earth
quake safety in the future," he said.
According to project supervisor Douglas Kirk of
Brero Construction Corp., which is in charge of the
repairs, "The interior (work) is mainly cosmetic."
Lap-Ping Wong, the company's housing operations
coordinator for apartment facilities, also admitted
the work is structurally unnecessary, but said
repairs still must be made.
According to one resident, some workers don't see
eye to eye with their supervisors about the repairs.
"I talked to a worker and he himself said this was
pointless," said resident Prasad Raje, a graduate stu
dent in electrical engineering.
Residents say that in addition to making unneces
sary repairs, the construction company has invaded
their privacy and disregarded security by leaving
doors open.
"Security here is a joke. Doors are left wide open.
Everybody has access to our house," said Rhett
Rushing.
"We have to hide away checkbooks and jewelry,"
Reye said. "We have strange people in the house."
Wong said he reported the students' security con
cerns to the construction company. "[The company
says] the eight people they have selected are hand
picked, have worked for the company for a long time
and are very trustworthy."
The construction company denied that security is

a problem. "When they work in the stairwells ... ,
they block the doors open,' Kirk said. Some
exterior doors are left open, but all our employees
wear name tags and tenants have been informed to
call us if they find any strangers without name tags
in the building."
Residents were first notified of the repairs at a
house meeting early in October.
"We got a flier that said nothing had to be moved,"
said resident Lianne Martin.
But residents said this has not been the case. "I
came home and my shower curtain, my shampoo, my
towels..., everything — my whole bathroom — had
been thrown on the living room floor," Brenda Rush
ing said.
Cleanup has also been a problem, according to
Rushing and other residents. Tarps given out to
cover furniture had been used before and were dirty,
Rushing said. "We were just dragging in dust."
"There were chunks of tiles and a layer of dust in
my bathroom. Nobody had swept, as they had
promised they would do. There was no note as to
whether or not we could use the shower. Our apart
ment was totally trashed," she added.
Martin agreed. "The doorknobs were full of plas
ter, the whole place was a mess," she said. Not one
thing was cleaned. We couldn't even use our toilet.
Cleanup, however, is not a problem in the eyes of
the construction company. "IThe workers] do not
dust, but they sweep and vacuum each day, as in our
contract," Kirk said. He added that the University
has hired a separate cleanup crew to do extra clean
ing.
Money from the Federal Emergency Management
Act may be used to pay for some of these repairs,
which angers many of the residents.
"If there were any structural damage, I could under
stand a lot more. A lot of federal money is being
wasted here," said Rhett Rushing. "They're burning
up federal money for cosmetic reasons," he added.
It is uncertain whether funds from FEMA will be
used for the work. However, Wong said University
officials hope the act will subsidize the repairs.
