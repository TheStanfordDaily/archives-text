## Rough-and-tumble Biddle challenges indirect cost policies 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
In an office tucked away on the sec
ond floor of McCullough Building sits a
desk cluttered with countless three
ring binders, a half-eaten family-size
bag of potato chips and numerous
memos. An American flag hangs limply
in the comer of the room. Anchored on
the front of the desk is a two-and-a-half
foot black, hard-plastic nameplate that
shouts its owner's name — PAUL BID
DLE — in big, white uppercase letters.
The name is one many Stanford
administrators would prefer not to
know.
Biddle is the resident representative
of the Office of Naval Research, the
government agency that negotiates the
indirect cost rates applied to Stanford's
federally sponsored research.

He is making life difficult for the
University.
As the result of questions Biddle has
raised about the propriety of past
actions here, two federal agencies —
ONR and the General Accounting
Office — are currently investigating
Stanford's indirect cost practices. GAO
officials have become a fixture in the
University Controller's Office during
the last month.
Numerous stories have run in the
local and national media, all saying
that Stanford may have overbilled the
government by as much as $200 or
$300 million during the last decade.
There is talk about possible House sub
committee hearings in March.
Biddle says that since his arrival in
October 1988, he has shattered the
tranquility of Stanford's relationship
with the government — a relationship

that he says had been far too cozy dur
ing the last decade, allowing Stanford
to collect millions of dollars in indirect
cost recovery that it may not have been
entitled to.
Since Biddle's concerns first sur
faced, Stanford administrators have
maintained that the University has
nothing to hide from examination of its
policies.
During the last few weeks, The
Daily has been granted two hour-long
interviews with Biddle. This story
marks the first time Biddle has spoken
publicly about the nature of some of his
concerns and about his relationships
with Stanford and ONR officials.
A free-spirited, rough-and-tumble
regulator, Biddle says he calls things
the way he sees them, regardless of
