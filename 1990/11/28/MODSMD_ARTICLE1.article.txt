# The 						man behind the controversy
## Rough-and-tumble Biddle challenges indirect cost policies 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
In an office tucked away on the sec
ond floor of McCullough Building sits a
desk cluttered with countless three
ring binders, a half-eaten family-size
bag of potato chips and numerous
memos. An American flag hangs limply
in the comer of the room. Anchored on
the front of the desk is a two-and-a-half
foot black, hard-plastic nameplate that
shouts its owner's name — PAUL BID
DLE — in big, white uppercase letters.
The name is one many Stanford
administrators would prefer not to
know.
Biddle is the resident representative
of the Office of Naval Research, the
government agency that negotiates the
indirect cost rates applied to Stanford's
federally sponsored research.

He is making life difficult for the
University.
As the result of questions Biddle has
raised about the propriety of past
actions here, two federal agencies —
ONR and the General Accounting
Office — are currently investigating
Stanford's indirect cost practices. GAO
officials have become a fixture in the
University Controller's Office during
the last month.
Numerous stories have run in the
local and national media, all saying
that Stanford may have overbilled the
government by as much as $200 or
$300 million during the last decade.
There is talk about possible House sub
committee hearings in March.
Biddle says that since his arrival in
October 1988, he has shattered the
tranquility of Stanford's relationship
with the government — a relationship

that he says had been far too cozy dur
ing the last decade, allowing Stanford
to collect millions of dollars in indirect
cost recovery that it may not have been
entitled to.
Since Biddle's concerns first sur
faced, Stanford administrators have
maintained that the University has
nothing to hide from examination of its
policies.
During the last few weeks, The
Daily has been granted two hour-long
interviews with Biddle. This story
marks the first time Biddle has spoken
publicly about the nature of some of his
concerns and about his relationships
with Stanford and ONR officials.
A free-spirited, rough-and-tumble
regulator, Biddle says he calls things
the way he sees them, regardless of

Paul Blddle, the campus representative of the Office of Naval Research, has recent
ly raised qusstlons about the propriety of Stanford's Indirect cost recovery policies.
The questions have prompted several federal Investlgstlons.
whom he may alienate in the process. "If
I have a bitch, I'll go after anyone," he
says, matter-of-factly. "I'm not a wall
flower."
Biddle is a large man. He sports white
hair, wire-rim glasses, a chubby face and a
large belly.
He says he is a champion of the tax
payer, an outsider who arrived as ONR's
resident representative at Stanford with
out all the baggage of a career civil ser
vant. Being relatively new to government,
Biddle says, he was able to "take a look at
things that other people may have been
blas6 or casual about."
At 46 years old, Biddle is not a com
plete stranger to government work — he
volunteered for service in Vietnam and
worked briefly for the Internal Revenue
Service several years ago — but he has
spent most of his professional life in the
private sector, working as an accountant
at several Big 8 firms.
In the early 1980s, Biddle started his
own business, providing audit services to
high-tech firms in the United States and
the Far East. He sold his practice in 1985
and then moved back into government
work as an auditor for the Defense Con
tract Auditing Agency. DCAA is responsi
ble for auditing defense contractors,
including Stanford.
Biddle made waves while at DCAA, he
says. He says he enjoyed going after the
"big boys" of the defense industry.
"If I thought something was not... in
the best interests of the government or
the taxpayer, I was very vocal," he recalls.
"I figured what the hell could I lose?"
Biddle has had "a very successful
career," says George Banks, a longtime
friend and a former employer who is now
a management consultant. Biddle is a
"workaholic" who's "very dedicated" to
the task at hand, Banks says. "When Paul
starts something, he wants to finish it."
A less flattering portrait
Conversations with Stanford officials,
particularly those in the Controller's
Office, as well as with Biddle's immediate
superior in the Navy, paint a far less flat
tering portrait.
They say Biddle is quite good at mak
ing sensational allegations, but far less
adept when it comes to offering specifics.
The concerns Biddle has raised about
Stanford's indirect cost policies have left
them baffled, they say.
"I really don't know where Paul's com
ing from,"says Robin Simpson, Biddle's
superior in ONR. "We're having a hard
time understanding what his concerns
are He kind of flops around."
Simpson, now Biddle's boss, was the
resident representative at Stanford from
1980 until Biddle replaced him in 1988.
The practices now being questioned by
Biddle took place during Simpson's
tenure here.
Since Biddle's arrival at Stanford, his
relationship with Simpson has been less
than comfortable. In December 1989,
Simpson placed Biddle on a four-month
probation because of an extremely large
backlog of paperwork that had accumu
lated in Biddle's office. "He wasn't per
forming his job," Simpson says.
Biddle contends the backlog resulted
from lack of staffing in the office. He says
the decision to put him on probation,
which amounted to his removal from sev
ered aspects of the job, was "piss-poor."
Janet Sweet, the official in Stanford's
Controller's Office who "has the most con
tact with Biddle, says she is unclear as to

both Biddle's specific concerns and his
motives. "This is all quite a mystery,
really," she says. "Paul's agenda is some
thing he's going to have to let you in on."
Sweet offers few kind words about Bid
dle.
She says Biddle is "full of venom." She
says he "does not communicate well,"
that he often expects her to read his
mind. Some of the positions he's taken
are "crazy," she says. Questioned about
Biddle's competence, she says "it's hard
to tell," given how long it takes Biddle to
address "even the most routine matters."
Sweet and Biddle used to be good
friends.
In 1986, DCAA assigned Biddle to
Stanford for part of the two-and-a-half
years he would spend with the auditing
agency. "At that time, Janet and I were
friendly," Biddle recalls.
The two would occasionally go out to
lunch together, alternately picking up
each other's tab, Biddle says. Sweet and
her parents even dropped by a Christmas
party of his, he recalls. "We had a very
easy-going situation."
But, Biddle is quick to note, back then,
"I had no awareness of the things I have
awarenesses of now."
Conditions imposed by the Navy
Discerning Biddle's specific "aware
nesses" has been difficult, in part due to a
restriction of information imposed by the
Navy.
The two interviews with Biddle were
both conducted in his office on campus
and monitored over speakerphone by
ONR public affairs officials at the
agency's headquarters in Arlington, Va.
Under the conditions of the interviews,
Biddle was not permitted to speak about
the specifics of the ongoing investigations
at Stanford.
At several points in both interviews,
Biddle drifted into areas deemed too sen

sitive by those in Arlington and was told
he could say no more on the subject.
But while specifics have been hard to
come by, the nature of his concerns is
more evident.
Much of what Biddle is questioning
centers around the legitimacy and appli
cability of memoranda of understanding
signed by Stanford and ONR in the early
1980s. Memoranda of understanding, or
MOUs, are written agreements on how
particular cost issues are to be handled by
the parties involved.
There are various types of MOUs. The
agreements may address one-time events
— for example, allowing a substitute sig
nature on a document that was to be
signed by a researcher who is deceased.
Or they may have longer-term conse
quences, such as replacing the standard
methodology used in calculating indirect
costs associated with a university's
library with a method more specific to the
pattern of use of Stanford's libraries.
Several MOUs, especially those with
longer-term consequences, have a signifi
cant impact on how much money Stan
ford is able to collect from the federal gov-?
ernment.
As of September 1990, there were 86
MOUs that had been signed by Stanford
and ONR that were currently in effect.
The majority of those went into effect in
the early 1980s, a time when new rules
governing indirect cost recovery had just
been put in place by the government.
Revised rules in 1979
In November 1979, the government
revised Circular A-21, the document that
lays out the principles of indirect cost
recovery for educational institutions. The
changes first affected Stanford in fiscal
year 1981. "We had to re-evaluate the
whole world, basically," says Sweet, who
has handled indirect cost recovery issues
for Stanford for the last 20 years.

As part of this re-evaluation, Stanford
and ONR representatives reached numer
ous agreements during the early 1980s
about how the changes in A-21 would
affect what Stanford could and could not
claim as legitimate indirect costs of
research.
Biddle contends ONR was far too
accommodating to Stanford with respect
to the development of MOUs during this
period, frequently agreeing to MOUs that
lacked proper justification. "It appears
that anything the University felt might
be beneficial to them has been character
ized and documented in the format of an
MOU," he says.
"If (ONR) had taken a position of only
permitting MOUs that we absolutely
believed were appropriate, rather than
saying we can't find any reason to fault
them, we would not have had the growth
of MOUs that we've experienced here."
The large number of MOUs that were
signed during the early 1980s, Sweet
says, were the result of a unique opportu
nity to clarify the process by which Stan
ford is reimbursed for indirect costs.
"It was an unusual opportunity to
start writing down more," she says. Most
of the new MOUs were the result of docu
menting practices the two parties had
been following for years, Sweet contends.
One purpose of MOUs, she says, is to
provide an "institutional memory."
Furthermore, she notes, many of these
MOUs were beneficial to the government,
not Stanford.
DCAA falls further behind
At the same time that Stanford and
ONR were agreeing to a host of new
MOUs, something else significant was
occurring. DCAA, the government agency
responsible for auditing Stanford's indi
rect costs, was falling further and further
behind in its audits — prompting Stan
ford and ONR to take several compen

satory actions, the propriety of which
Biddle is now questioning.
The system of indirect cost recovery is
designed to work in a multi-step process:
• In advance of the fiscal year, Stanford
and ONR agree to a proposed indirect cost
rate (so that researchers know how much
to ask for when seeking grants);
• At the end of the fiscal year, Stanford
submits to DCAA an indirect cost study,
showing the indirect costs it actually
incurred during the fiscal year;
• DCAA audits Stanford's submission,
looking for any errors or questionable
applications of cost principles in A-21;
• Based on DCAA's findings, Stanford
and ONR negotiate an actual rate and
determine if Stanford has under-recov
ered or over-recovered with respect to the
proposed rate; and
• Any under-recovery or over-recovery
is considered a "carry-forward" and is
applied to subsequent years' rates.
Most involved with the process agree
that for the system to operate efficiently,
audits most be done promptly. That
hasn't happened.
DCAA's audit of Stanford's indirect
costs from fiscal year 1980 was not com
pleted until 1984. The audits of FY 1981
and 1982 were never performed. DCAA
completed FY 1983 in May 1987, but
issued a revised report just this fall. FY
1984, 1985 and 1986 were completed in
May 1990. Audits for subsequent years
have not begun.
'Abused in some way'
Stanford, ONR and DCAA all publicly
give the same explanation for the delayed
audits: They say that during the 1980s an
understaffed DCAA had to devote its
resources to its biggest risks and that
Stanford was far lower on the priority list
than the mtyor defense contractors that
DCAA is also responsible for auditing.
In an interview, Biddle offered a differ
ent view. DCAA, he says, was "really try
ing to help (ONR) until 1983 or 1984." At
that point, Biddle says, DCAA "felt they
had been abused in some way — that
their positions had not been addressed in
negotiations, that they had been taken
advantage of by the development of
MOUs."
DCAA, he says, "more or less gave up
on ONR" because they felt ONR was "not
negotiating in a way that was consistent
with what they thought the questioned
costs were."
At this point in the interview, public
affairs officials in Arlington intervened,
saying that the only "official" explanation
DCAA has provided "has to do with
resources vs. risks."
Joseph Riden, the branch manager of
the local DCAA office, would not com
ment on Biddle's assertion.
In any event, the long lulls between
the close of a fiscal year and the comple
tion of that year's audit have provided
fertile ground for Biddle to plow — and
unearth practices between Stanford and
ONR that he believes are suspect.
One such practice Biddle is question
ing has to do with the applicability of
MOUs. Biddle contends it is "question
able" to apply an MOU to the actual costs
of a given year if that MOU did not exist
when the costs were initially proposed.
If, for example, an MOU is to be used
to calculate actual indirect costs for FY
1981, then that MOU must have been in
place at the time the University proposed
its indirect cost rate for FY 1981, Biddle
contends. In the past, proposed rates
have generally been agreed to more than
a year in advance of the fiscal year in

with Biddle. Both were monitored by ONR public affairs officials in Arlington, Va.
which they are operative.
"There would be no problem in the
University recovering funds that it had
expended if those funds were associated
with the manner proposed," Biddle says.
"But if after you put in your proposed
rates, you go back and tinker with how
you determined costs and come up with a
much larger amount — which is what the
MOUs do — that's questionable. We don't
know how that's going to shake out," he
says.
The impropriety, Biddle says, is that
"the costs were determined on a
that wasn't consistent with Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles."
Generally Accepted Accounting Princi
ples, or GAAF) refer to a set of accounting
rules and procedures issued by the Finan
cial Accounting Standards Board.
According to Sweet, the whole ques
tion of how MOUs can be applied "doesn't
have anything to do with GAAP" GAAI>
she says, "has zip to do with this."
What's more, she says, Biddle has
never even mentioned any concerns to
her about GAAP "Not once," she says.
University seeks legal opinion
In response to this and other questions
Biddle has raised, the University recently
obtained an outside legal opinion on the
applicability of MOUs.
Citing Section 31.109(b) of the Federal
Acquisition Regulations, attorney Allan
Joseph argues that the language of that
section does not preclude MOUs from
being established after costs are incurred.
FAR 31.109(b) states, in part:
"Advanced agreements may be negotiated
either before or during a contract, but
should be negotiated before incurrence of
the costs involved."
According to Joseph, "The guidance
provided by FAR 31.109(b) is that MOUs
should be negotiated before incurrence of
the costs, but there is no requirement
that it must be negotiated at that time. In
short, the language found at FAR 31.109
(b) is permissive, not mandatory.
"Neither this nor any other regulation
prohibits the parties from negotiating (or
modifying) an advance agreement after
costs are incurred," he states.
According to University Legal Counsel
Debra Zumwalt, the distinction between
"should" and "must" is very common in
contract law.
For the past decade, it has been a regu
lar practice of Stanford and ONR to nego
tiate MOUs after indirect costs have been
incurred. Biddle's suggestion that the
practice is problematic "is the first of its
kind I've heard," Zumwalt says.
Biddle has also raised a more general
question about the applicability of MOUs,
which University officials say they have a
hard time comprehending.
Biddle argues that MOUs are not
legally binding on either party when
determining actual costs. That view,
Sweet says, is "crazy."
If Biddle's view is cbri"ect, then the
ruleß Stanfdfffftas btleii'tflayingby during
the last decade change drastically,
potentially decreasing Stanford's allow
able indirect costs by millions of dollars.
Both Sweet and University Controller
Frank Riddle have signed sworn state
ments saying it has always been their
understanding that MOUs were to be
used to determine actual costs. Both Rid
dle and Sweet have handled indirect cost
recovery issues for the University for
more than 20 years.
ONR and DCAA have always operated
under the same assumptions, Sweet and
Riddle say.
"It would not have made sense for the
parties to enter into such agreements
unless they were binding for purposes of

determining actual costs," Sweet and Rid
dle say in their statements. "Until this
issue was recently raised by Mr. Biddle,
(we) have never heard anyone, in the gov
ernment or at Stanford, question the
validity of the MOUs or their application
to the determination of final, actual indi
rect cost rates."
Simpson, the ONR representative at
Stanford from 1980 until 1988, says he
has operated under the sa/ne understand
ing.
ONR will be issuing a legal opinion on
this issue shortly, Simpson said.
DCAA would not comment.
Skipping '81 and *82 audits
Biddle says he is also concerned about
an agreement reached by Stanford and
ONR in 1985 that was intended to get
DCAA back on track — by skipping the
audits for 1981 and 1982.
By the summer of 1984, Sweet says,
DCAA had just finished auditing Stan
ford's indirect cost claims of fiscal year
1980, and they had fiscal years 1981,
1982 and 1983 "in the hopper." Before
long, FY 1984 would require auditing.
As a result of the backlog, Sweet says,
Stanford and ONR were "feeling hung
out to dry."
The two parties were not able to nego
tiate final rates on the early years of the
1980s. Furthermore, they were applying
carry-forwards to future years' rates that
had not been confirmed through audit.
Doing so put Stanford in "an awkward
position" with respect to A-21 guidelines,
says Riddle, the University controller.
"We became quite worried about the
backlog of DCAA audits," Sweet recalls.
"Many years were going by as they com
pleted one year's audit."
In 1985, Stanford and ONR reached an
agreement whereby audits would not be
performed for 1981 and 1982, allowing
DCAA to skip ahead to 1983. The agree
ment, Sweet says, "was purely a way to
help (DCAA) out of their backlog crisis."
As part of the deal reached with ONR,
Stanford returned $400,000 from both
years to DCAA. "Historically speaking,"
Sweet says, adjustments made in Stan
ford's indirect cost recovery as a result of
audits were typically no more than
$400,000.
The agreement carried another stipu
lation. If more than $400,000 in costs
questioned by the FY 1983 audit were
sustained in negotiations with ONR, then
like items would be examined in FY 1981
and 1982, leaving open the possibility of
Stanford returning more to the govern
ment for those items.
As it turned out, Sweet says, the initial
FY 1983 audit, issued in April 1987, ques
tioned around $350,000 in costs — "a rel
atively small amount." So the agreement
remained valid.
But, just this fall, the DCAA issued a

revised report that contains additional
questioned costs. While none of the par
ties involved would provide exact figures,
apparently several million dollars in addi
tional costs are now being questioned.
The reason for the higher cost find
ings, Sweet says, is that Biddle told DCAA
not to apply some MOUs to final costs.
Biddle contends that, given FY 1981
was the first year changes in A-21
affected Stanford, it should have been
deemed essential for DCAA to audit 1981
and 1982. U I think most of us feel it's
imperative that we get into 1981 and
1982 and ascertain what the situation is,"
he says.
"We should not have gone forward
with MOUs or with cost determinations
that had not been anchored with DCAA
unless we had a hell of a lot of confidence
in what we were doing," he says.
Sweet says she has no objection to FY
1981 and 1982 being audited but sees no
reason to do so. DCAA is already quite
behind as it is, she says, and it does not
need the added burden of re-examining
those years.
Interestingly, she says, Biddle has
never asked her about why the agreement
not to audit 1981 and 1982 was reached.
When the agreement was made, Sweet
says, "Paul was nowhere near this scene."
Controversy from the start
Biddle arrived on the scene in fall of
1988. Controversy arrived with him.
Shortly before Biddle accepted the job
as ONR resident representative at Stan
ford, plans were being finalized to con
duct a new study of library usage. Previ
ous studies had been conducted at Stan
ford several times in the past, the most
recent in 1981.
The usage patterns detected in the
study serve as the basis for an MOU
between Stanford and the government
that allows the University to recover
more on indirect costs associated with the
library than they would be allowed under
the default methodology in A-21.
Prior to Biddle's arrival, a proposal for
the study was sent to Simpson, who at
that time held the resident representative
position at Stanford but knew he would
be moving up in the ONR chain of com
mand when a replacement could be
found.
Sweet says that the proposed method
ology for the libraiy study was the same
as ONR and DCAA had agreed to in past
studies and that Simpson voiced no sub
stantial concerns about the proposal to
her or her staff over the summer of 1988.
Then Biddle arrived.
In a meeting several days after Biddle
began work as the resident representative
here, he said he had problems with the
study. The meeting was also attended by
Simpson, as part of a transitional period
between his residency and Biddle's.
"Paul indicated to us that he had con
cerns," Sweet recalls. But, she says, it was
apparent to everyone in the room that he
had nOt yet read the proposal for the
study.
"I think you have to view it in several
ways," Biddle says, in response to Sweet's
assertion. "First of all, that was almost
immediately after my coming here. And
no one likes a smart ass who comes in and
starts telling you how to do your business
when you're the new boy on the block. I
indicated my dissatisfaction with the sub
mission as I had it before me. . ..
"I didn't think it was really appropri
ate for me to start kicking the crap out of
something when I had only been here a
week to 10 days... I felt the opportunity
would be provided me down the road to
get into it and be more specific after I
more or less accomplished some respect

within the organization."
'We had pleaded, we had begged*
But, Sweet says, those specifics never
came.
Months went by, she says, without Bid
die specifying his concerns. As the sched
uled date to begin the study drew closer
and closer, Sweet's frustration mounted.
"My staff had thrown up their hands,"
she says. "We had asked, we had
reminded him and reminded him, we had
pleaded, we had begged."
Biddle didn't respond, she says. So she
went above his head, and called Jack
Ducey, one of Biddle's superiors in ONR.
Biddle subsequently sent Sweet two
letters, dated May 19 and July 4, 1989,
which he contends adequately docu
mented his concerns about Stanford's
library study proposal.
Sweet says the letters did no more
than "regurgitate the cost principles in A
-21." The letters, she said, contained only
"a few vagueries regarding how he would
set up a study."
The study has since been postponed.
The frustration on both sides regard
ing the library study seems symptomatic
of the relationship that has developed
between Biddle and Sweet over the past
several years.
Biddle claims that Sweet would go over
his head far too often, seeking accommo
dation from Simpson or Ducey on issues
that should have been addressed through
the ONR campus office. Sweet says Bid
dle just didn't budge on many issues,
leaving her no other choice but to talk to
his superiors.
"It's been a frustrating couple of years,
to say the least," Sweet says. "Even the
smallest issues never get resolved."
Biddle contends the tension has
resulted from a level of scrutiny higher
than was applied under Simpson.
"I have a different mentality set," Bid
dle says."I do not approve on the basis I
have no reason to disbelieve. I only
approve and accommodate on the basis
that it's appropriate. One is managing by
exception, the other is managing by con
firmation."
The University, he says, preferred the
management style of his predecessor.
"Stanford much appreciates not having to

go through the rigamarole and the
scrutiny associated with a positive confir
mation vs. an exception basis," he says.
'Back-door type awarenesses'
Biddle says that when he arrived as the
resident representative at Stanford,
Sweet and Riddle would often communi
cate behind his back with his superiors in
ONR.
"The Controller's Office has always
felt relative advantage in their discus
sions with people who they have known
for a long time and worked with," Biddle
says. "We had all this back-door-type
awareness, understandings, accommoda
tions, that I was having to live with as I
went through and started to review the
indirect cost areas."
"There was nothing going on behind
his back," Simpson contends.
Sweet says she only dealt with Biddle's
superiors when she had exhausted other
channels. "We went above his head only
when things didn't move and just didn't
get done," she says. If she were as slow in
performing her job as Biddle is in per
forming his, Sweet says, it would be justi
fiable for him to go over her head.
"We have certainly tried to keep the
relationship good," Sweet says. But, she
says, Biddle seems to feel that a good rela
tionship is not a proper relationship. In
order to be proper, Sweet says, "you don't
have to bare your teeth and be nasty."
His rocky relationship with Sweet
should not cloud the real issues of the
investigations, Biddle contends.
"It's not a personal thing," he says.
"The concerns I have here are not per
sonal. They're government."
Biddle says that, prior to obtaining his
position in ONR, he had submitted his
resume to Stanford on several occasions
as part of broad job searches. He says he
has never been interviewed for a job here.
"Stanford is a place very convenient to
where I live, so it's always on my list," he
says.
"I'm very positive on this institution,"
Biddle says."I think the nation is very
fortunate to have a consolidation of the
scientific talent that we find on this cam
pus. ... I'm not down on the institution,
just on the positions that are adopted by
some of its administrators."
