Tokyo is most expensive city for
expatriates; Quito cheapest
GENEVA (AP) — Tokyo tops a new list of the world's most
expensive cities for expatriates while a weaker dollar lowered liv
ing costs for foreigners in the United States, according to a survey
published yesterday.
With an index figure of 170 against New York's 100, Tokyo
ranked first among 89 mqjor cities in the survey prepared by Cor
porate Resources Group, a Geneva-based consultancy. Trailing
Tokyo were Osaka at 163, and Libreville, Gabon, at 147.
Prague, at 56, and Ecuador's capital of Quito, 54, were at the
bottom of the list as most cheapest cities to live in. Moscow was
temporarily dropped from the survey "due to the severe shortage
of goods and services," CRG said.
Among the 48 cities listed as cheaper than New York were
Hong Kong, Jeddah, Singapore, Buenos Aires, Lisbon, Jakarta,
Bombay and Manila.
Tehran, which topped the previous list has been deleted
because calculating the basket for the Iranian capital has proved
"too complicated," a CRG official said.
Fire finally extinguished at Denver airport
DENVER (AP) — A huge jet fuel fire that burned unchecked for
two days near Stapleton International Airport was extinguished
yesterday with help from a team of specialists flown in from
Texas.
Mounting an all-out assault, firefighters put out the blazes in
two storage tanks about 2:30 p.m.
A five-man team from Williams, Boots & Coots of Port Neches,
Texas, donned fireproof suits and sealed broken valves on an
800,000-gallon tank that was one-third to one-half full of jet fuel
and a 350,000-gallon tank that had only a fraction of fuel left.
A snowstorm that dusted Denver with up to 2 inches of snow
dropped temperatures below freezing and further hampered the
efforts of more than 60 firefighters yesterday morning.
Eastern begs for more money to stay alive
MIAMI (AP) — Eastern Airlines said yesterday it would ask a
federal bankruptcy judge for another $120 million to stay alive,
far more than the $15 million it originally planned to seek.
Spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said the airline would go
before Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland later today in New York.
She said the money from its escrow fund, on top of $15 million
approved last month, would keep Eastern operating through the
first quarter of 1991, when trustee Martin Shugrue insists the
airline can break even.
The airline's executives believe that each time they go back to
court seeking additional funds, Eastern suffers damage because
of consumer uncertainty until after the request is approved, Ms.
Ceremsak said.
Lifland released $15 million after a lengthy hearing Nov. 14 in
which creditors had urged Eastern's liquidation.
In a filing Monday, Eastern estimated the liquidation talk in
November cost it $55 million to $70 million in cancellations and
"people that just didn't call."
