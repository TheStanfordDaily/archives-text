# Israel ponders border clashes

JERUSALEM (AP) — A pall hung over Israel on
yesterday as it buried three of its five soldiers killed
in a clash with Palestinian guerrillas in southern
Lebanon.
Radio stations played sad songs, and Mqj. Gen.
Yossi Peled, commander of the sector where the
deaths occurred, said: "Today we paid in a big way,
heavily."
The shock over the latest deaths was compounded
by the fact that only two days earlier, four Israelis
were shot and killed by an infiltrator on the Egyp
tian border.
In a commentary in the daily Maariv, Shmuel
Schnitzer wrote: "We have to learn to live with the
feeling that death lurks everywhere."
The border violence also includes two army deaths
on the Jordan River this month. "I don't recall a
month where we have paid such a price," said an
army officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
In fact, the army has suffered much higher
casualties during Israel's 42 years of statehood. But
the latest deaths caught the Israeli public off guard
— preoccupied by the 3-year-old Palestinian uprising
in the occupied territories and the influx of Soviet
Jews.
Yesterday, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
Cabinet was in special session to debate the $37.5
billion state budget for 1991. At issue was how to
cover the costs of absorbing hundreds of thousands
of immigrants while maintaining a strong military
posture. No decision was reached.
The army also faces a struggle to retain public
confidence. It has been wracked for months by a
bitter race for the post of chief of stafT. And in the
midst of the news of the deaths in Lebanon, it
emerged that a senior general had resigned in anger,
complaining that the army was ill-prepared for war.
As head of training and planning, Mqj. Gen. Moshe
Bar-Kochba was in charge of studying the lessons
of past military setbacks. In a letter broadcast by
Israel radio, he claimed no one was paying attention
to his findings.
All this, plus the undercurrent of worry that the
Persian Gulf crisis could drag Israel into war, has
created an atmosphere of foreboding.
