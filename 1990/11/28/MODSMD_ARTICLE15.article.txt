# Appeals Court rejects teacher's libel claim against a pupil
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - A school
newspaper article calling a teacher a
"babbler" and the worst teacher at the
school was not libelous because it con
tained no assertions of fact, a state
appeals court ruled yesterday.
Both statements, attributed to an
anonymous student responsible for a
smoke bomb in the teacher's class,
were subjective expressions that could
not be proved true or false, said the Ist
District Court of Appeal.
Only a false and harmftil statement
of fact can be grounds for a libel suit.
A lawyer for a student in the case
called the ruling a victory for freedom
of expression. The teacher's lawyer
said the decision "undermines the
authority of every classroom teacher."
The teacher, Larry L. Moyer, said he

has taught for 24 years and recently
switched from math to business
courses. He declined comment on the
ruling.
The suit stemmed from a March
1988 article in the student newspaper
In Flight, at Foothill High School in
Pleasanton, about the explosion of a
smoke bomb in Mover's classroom.
The article quoted "The Shadow," the
student who supplied the bomb to a
fellow student, as calling Moyer "a
babbler" and"the worst teacher at
FHS."
Moyer sued the school principal, the
newspaper adviser, the student
reporters and the Amador Valley Joint
Union High School District. The suit
was dismissed by Alameda County
Superior Court Judge Richard Hodge,

whose ruling was upheld in a 3-0
appeals court decision.
The appeals court noted that the
U.S. Supreme Court last June rejected
previous rulings that said statements
of opinion could not be libelous. But
the appeals court said libel still must
be based on statements that can be
reasonably understood to contain fac
tual assertions. The disparaging com
ments about Moyer did not meet that
test, the court said.
Quoting a dictionary definition of
"babbler" as someone who talks fool
ishly or unintelligibly, Presiding Jus
tice John Racanelli said readers of the
article "would have understood that
the word was not used literally but as a
form of exaggerated expression con
veying the student-speaker's disap

proval of (Moyer's) teaching or speak
ing style."
Calling Moyer the school's worst
teacher was also not a factual state
ment that could be proven, but "sim
ply an expression of anger or disgust,"
Racanelli said.
Robert Links, a lawyer for one of
the students Moyer sued, said the rul
ing shows that the Supreme Court
decision has not weakened protection
for freedom of expression.
"This case started out as the
teacher who was out to teach a lesson
to the students," Links said. "It
wound up being a case where students
taught a lesson to the teacher because
they taught him what the First
Amendment means."
