# John Major elected Prime Minister

### 
LONDON (AP) - John Mqjor,
endorsed by Margaret Thatcher
as the politician closest to her
heart, was elected by the Conser
vative Party yesterday night to
succeed her as prime minister.
47, fell two votes short
of winning a mtgority in voting
among the 372 Conservative
Party members of Parliament, but
his two opponents quickly
conceded defeat and the party
confirmed Mcgor as the winner.
Thatcher, ending 11V4 years in
power, intended to submit her res
ignation to Queen Elizabeth II
this morning, and Mcyor would
then be called to lead the govern
ment.
Msgor, the chancellor of the ex
chequer, emerged from his official
residence at 11 Downing St.yes
terday night smiling and holding
hands with his wife, Norma. In
side, Thatcher, who came next
door from the prime minister's 10
Downing Street residence,
embraced Msgor. "I am thrilled
and delighted that John M«gor is
to succeed me," the "Iron Lady"
said in a statement released by
aides.
"It is a very exciting thing to
become leader of the Conservative
Party, and particularly exciting, I
think, to follow one of the most
remarkable leaders the Conserva
tive Party has ever had," Mcyor
said.
"Our job now I think is quite
clear. We are going to unite totally
and absolutely, and we're going
to win the next general election,"
said Major, who will be the
youngest British prime minister
in this century.
Mcyor received 185 votes, two
short of a mcuority. Former De
fense Secretary Michael Heseltine
received 131 and Foreign Secre
tary Douglas Hurd had 56.
Hurd and Heseltine conceded
within minutes, and party offi
cials declared Msyor elected.
The party had been torn by the
sudden and unexpected leadership
challenge by Heseltine, who last
week stopped Thatcher short of
victory in the first round of the
leadership race.
Thatcher had not wanted to

leave office, but she decided to
resign last week after she was
unable to put down Heseltine's
challenge.
She said she resigned to let
someone from the Cabinet stand
against Heseltine. Major and
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd
both joined the race, but before
the vote her aides spread the word
that she was backing Mcyor.
The son of a circus performer
and at one time a welfare
recipient, Mcyor personifies the
values of self-reliance and hard
work that Thatcher had preached
to the nation.
His election climaxed a month
of British politics-turned-upside
down, and the Western world's
longest-serving head of govern
ment was driven from office by a
revolt in party ranks.
Heading a government that was
trailing the opposition Labor
Party in the polls and suffering
a losing streak in local Parliamen
tary elections, Thatcher lost con
trol of events after her deputy,
Sir Geoffrey Howe, resigned on
Nov. 1.
Howe, the fourth Cabinet mem
ber to resign because of disputes
over policy toward the European
Community, shocked the House
of Commons on Nov. 13 by calling
Thatcher a threat to Britain's vital
interests.
The next day, Heseltine an
nounced he would challenge her.
Six days later, with Thatcher at
a 34-nation summit in Paris of
ficially ending the Cold War,
Heseltine polled enough votes to
deny her re-election as leader.
Two days later, she decided to
resign after party leaders told her
she could not win.
Heseltine, 57, said Major's elec
tion "lays the basis for the unity
of our party."
Hurd said the party needed to
unite, and "John is the
right leader for this task."
Opposition leaders derided
Major's election as "Thatcherism
with a different face." The Con
servatives' main rivals, the
socialist Labor Party, demanded
a general election.
"John is a Thatcherette

— that is how he sought election
and that is how he got elected,"
said Labor Party leader Neil Kin
nock. "It means that the policies
that brought the poll tax, reces
sion, heavy mortgages and rising
unemployment will go on."
During his five-day campaign,
Mcyor had said he would review
the "poll tax," an unpopular local
tax brought in by Thatcher, but
he gave no other hints of differing
with her.
While adopting a gentler tone
on the contentious issue of Brit
ain's involvement in Europe, he
shares her opposition to a single

European currency and shares her
belief in tight restraint on gov
ernment spending.
However, he insisted over the
weekend, "I am not running as
'Son of Thatcher.' I am running
as myself, with my own priorities
and my own programs."
Meyor's victory ended a patient,
four-year campaign by Heseltine
to promote himself as a future
leader of the party.
"Tomorrow always dawns," he
said, smiling after conceding
defeat.
Major was elected to Parliament
in 1979.

gives a high five In London yesterday after his fellow candidates
wilted In the leadership contest.
LONDON (AP) - John Mqjor,
endorsed by Margaret Thatcher
as the politician closest to her
heart, was elected by the Conser
vative Party yesterday night to
succeed her as prime minister.
47, fell two votes short
of winning a mtgority in voting
among the 372 Conservative
Party members of Parliament, but
his two opponents quickly
conceded defeat and the party
confirmed Mcgor as the winner.
Thatcher, ending 11V4 years in
power, intended to submit her res
ignation to Queen Elizabeth II
this morning, and Mcyor would
then be called to lead the govern
ment.
Msgor, the chancellor of the ex
chequer, emerged from his official
residence at 11 Downing St.yes
terday night smiling and holding
hands with his wife, Norma. In
side, Thatcher, who came next
door from the prime minister's 10
Downing Street residence,
embraced Msgor. "I am thrilled
and delighted that John M«gor is
to succeed me," the "Iron Lady"
said in a statement released by
aides.
"It is a very exciting thing to
become leader of the Conservative
Party, and particularly exciting, I
think, to follow one of the most
remarkable leaders the Conserva
tive Party has ever had," Mcyor
said.
"Our job now I think is quite
clear. We are going to unite totally
and absolutely, and we're going
to win the next general election,"
said Major, who will be the
youngest British prime minister
in this century.
Mcyor received 185 votes, two
short of a mcuority. Former De
fense Secretary Michael Heseltine
received 131 and Foreign Secre
tary Douglas Hurd had 56.
Hurd and Heseltine conceded
within minutes, and party offi
cials declared Msyor elected.
The party had been torn by the
sudden and unexpected leadership
challenge by Heseltine, who last
week stopped Thatcher short of
victory in the first round of the
leadership race.
Thatcher had not wanted to

leave office, but she decided to
resign last week after she was
unable to put down Heseltine's
challenge.
She said she resigned to let
someone from the Cabinet stand
against Heseltine. Major and
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd
both joined the race, but before
the vote her aides spread the word
that she was backing Mcyor.
The son of a circus performer
and at one time a welfare
recipient, Mcyor personifies the
values of self-reliance and hard
work that Thatcher had preached
to the nation.
His election climaxed a month
of British politics-turned-upside
down, and the Western world's
longest-serving head of govern
ment was driven from office by a
revolt in party ranks.
Heading a government that was
trailing the opposition Labor
Party in the polls and suffering
a losing streak in local Parliamen
tary elections, Thatcher lost con
trol of events after her deputy,
Sir Geoffrey Howe, resigned on
Nov. 1.
Howe, the fourth Cabinet mem
ber to resign because of disputes
over policy toward the European
Community, shocked the House
of Commons on Nov. 13 by calling
Thatcher a threat to Britain's vital
interests.
The next day, Heseltine an
nounced he would challenge her.
Six days later, with Thatcher at
a 34-nation summit in Paris of
ficially ending the Cold War,
Heseltine polled enough votes to
deny her re-election as leader.
Two days later, she decided to
resign after party leaders told her
she could not win.
Heseltine, 57, said Major's elec
tion "lays the basis for the unity
of our party."
Hurd said the party needed to
unite, and "John is the
right leader for this task."
Opposition leaders derided
Major's election as "Thatcherism
with a different face." The Con
servatives' main rivals, the
socialist Labor Party, demanded
a general election.
"John is a Thatcherette

— that is how he sought election
and that is how he got elected,"
said Labor Party leader Neil Kin
nock. "It means that the policies
that brought the poll tax, reces
sion, heavy mortgages and rising
unemployment will go on."
During his five-day campaign,
Mcyor had said he would review
the "poll tax," an unpopular local
tax brought in by Thatcher, but
he gave no other hints of differing
with her.
While adopting a gentler tone
on the contentious issue of Brit
ain's involvement in Europe, he
shares her opposition to a single

European currency and shares her
belief in tight restraint on gov
ernment spending.
However, he insisted over the
weekend, "I am not running as
'Son of Thatcher.' I am running
as myself, with my own priorities
and my own programs."
Meyor's victory ended a patient,
four-year campaign by Heseltine
to promote himself as a future
leader of the party.
"Tomorrow always dawns," he
said, smiling after conceding
defeat.
