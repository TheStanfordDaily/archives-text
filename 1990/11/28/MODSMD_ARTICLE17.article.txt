# Deadline set by U.N. for Saddam
## 
### 
Iraq will have less than seven weeks to withdraw
nearly half-million troops from Kuwait before it
faces the prospect of a U.N.-authorized military
strike, the Soviet ambassador to the United Nations
said yesterday.
Meanwhile, three Americans waving Iraqi and
American flags arrived in Jordan after being freed by
Iraq's leader, Saddam Hussein.
And in Saudi Arabia, where the multitude of U.S.
troops are based facing off against Iraq, the first rain
of the two-month rainy season fell in the north, fill
ing jeep tracks with puddles and forcing Arab forces
allied with the West to bundle up against the unfa
miliar dampness.
U.S. boxing great Muhammad Ali met for 50 min
utes yesterday with Saddam in Baghdad and was
promised that a number of Americans held hostage
in Iraq would be freed at an unspecified date. Ali said
he wouldn't leave Iraq until he is handed over some
hostages held as "human shields" against possible
attack.
The second-ranking Democrat in the House said
yesterday night he would oppose a resolution autho
rizing the early use of force to throw Iraq out of
Kuwait.
Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., the mtgority
leader of the House, spoke in a telephone interview
after some Senate Democrats questioned the need
for offensive action right away
The disclosure of Gephardt's position was the
first public opposition among party leaders in
Congress to the use of force, something the United
Nations is expected to endorse soon.
Gephardt, who will outline his views further in a
speech on Wednesday, said in a telephone interview,
"I think we should stay the course with sanctions."
"I would not be in favor of authorizing force at
this point. I'm not ruling it out," Gephardt said.
"The question is not whether military action is
justified. It is," said Sen. Sam Nunn, chairman of
the Senate Armed Services Committee, which began
several days of hearings on the gulf crisis. "The ques
tion is whether military action is wise at this time
and in our own national interest."
Nunn said he supported the resolution to come
before the UN. Security Council later this week
authorizing member countries to use "all necessary
means" to restore Kuwait.
The hearings were called — after Congress
adjourned for the year — in reaction to Bush's deci
sion to send an additional 200,000 troops to the gulf
to provide an "offensive military option."
With the administration seeking U.N. approval
for the use of force in the gulf, some committee mem
bers said the president also must make the same
request of Congress.
Neither House Speaker Thomas Foley nor his
Senate counterpart, Msyority Leader Georee
Mitchell, D-Maine, has indicated whether he would
support a congressional resolution authorizing
offensive military action.
Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., said the policy change to
underline a U.S. attack capability undermines the
nation's attempts to maintain international support
for the sanctions "by declaring, through its own
word and those of the imminent U.N. resolution,
that our patience was almost spent."
Committee member Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.,
declared, "It is not enough for President Bush to go
to the United Nations to get approval for the use of
military force in the Persian Gulf."
