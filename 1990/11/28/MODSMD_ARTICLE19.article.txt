## Be careful with fire 
### 
Organizers of 'The Fire
Within' must carefully
examine their goals

IN THE WAKE of this year's
Leadership Summit, the orga
nizers of "The Fire Within"
have some very tough decisions
ahead of them.
In past years, the program cele
brating multiculturalism has been
criticized for its non-inclusiveness.
This year, the stage is set not
only for dance, music and drama,
but for the possible inclusion of
other groups.
The organizers need to consider
what the objectives of the program
are, the validity of such objectives
and how the program would best
achieve them.
Is "The Fire Within" a celebra
tion all by itself, is it meant to cre
ate understanding, or is it sup
posed to achieve something else?
They need to weigh the pros and
cons of inviting more than the
Asian American Student Associa
tion, the Black Student Union,
MEChA, a Chicano/Latino student
group, and the Stanford American
Indian Organization to participate.
A symbolic gesture of inclusive
ness may prove logistically impos
sible. Time may be short, and the
number of interested groups may
be great.
To exclude any organization,
however, could be interpreted as a
judgment as to what acts, and what
student groups, are important.
Exclusion of any cultural group
may also call into question any
claims of the program's being all
encompassing.
If University and ASSU funds or
resources are to be used, the orga

nizers must justify the use of such
funds for the objectives of the pro
gram.
In such a case, the program's
benefits should be spread over the
entire campus.
Accountability to the people who
supply the resources in the form of
ASSU fees or tuition payments
should be upheld.
Two years ago, the Council of
Presidents initiated the program
and received Residential Educa
tion's backing as a part of Orienta
tion. It was in its first year that the
program received its greatest criti
cism.
In the program, the Council of
Presidents and the four organizing
minority groups brought the
United Stanford Workers on stage
in a show of support for them and
their negotiations with the Univer
sity.
Alice Supton, the Associate
Dean of Residential Education,
commented that the cultural pro
gram's support for the USW
should have been balanced with a
counter-viewpoint.
Freshmen complained that the
USW endorsement was inappropri
ate and that the groups were trying
to separate themselves from the
rest of the Stanford community.
But that was two years ago.
Since then, there has been
another program which went very
smoothly by comparison.
Now, the organizers of "The Fire
Within" have the advantage of a
greater perspective and more time
to plan.
Tough decisions will have to be
made regarding the entire pro
gram. "The Fire Within" has much
potential to be inclusive and divi
sive. Hopefully, its organizers will
realize this and make its decisions
wisely.
