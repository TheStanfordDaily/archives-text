# Employees will be warned to follow alcohol policy
## 
### Manjusha Pawagi 
University officials will send all Stan
ford employees a letter next month warn
ing that they could face disciplinary
action ranging from a warning to dis
missal if they violate Stanford's new drug
and alcohol policy.
Although the new policy prohibits
unlawful use and possession of both
drugs and alcohol in the workplace,
administrators said they are most con

cerned about faculty and staff providing
alcohol to underage students.
Manager of Employee Relations Keith
Smith said the main thrust of the
explanatory letter is "the need to insure
that alcohol is not provided to persons
under 21."
The Controlled Substances and Alco
hol Policy was drafted by the Office of
Student Affairs in response to the Drug-
Free Schools and Communities Act,
which required universities to expressly

prohibit the unlawful use of alcohol and
drugs on campus to maintain eligibility
for federal funds. The policy took effect
Oct. 1.
"People need to know that if they have
a party celebrating a birthday or an end of
term project and alcohol is served to a
minor, they're subject to University disci
pline," said Doug Dupen, deputy manager
of Employee Relations.
He gave the example of a supervisor
giving beer to an 18-year-old at a lab gath

ering. After the first offense, a warning
letter will appear on the supervisor's file,
Dupen said. The next time the University
will "get tougher," he added.
Dupen said most people know what is
legal and what is not. However, he noted,
"Before, it was none of the employer's
business, but now that we do have a pol
icy, we've got to do something about it."
Smith said a person serving alcohol to
minors "was already violating the law, but
is now also violating University rules."

But he added, "We don't intend to have
people standing there with armed guards
at the punch bowl."
Along with the letter, a copy of the new
policy will be sent to every faculty mem
ber and University employee early next
month.
The University policy prohibits the
"unlawful manufacture, distribution, dis
pensation, possession and/or use of con-
trolled substances or the unlaw
ful possession, use, or distribu
tion of alcohol" on the Stanford
campus. It further states that
"vitiation of this policy may
result in disciplinary sanctions up
to and including termination of
employment."
The letter fulfills another
requirement of the federal act —
making the provisions of the new
policy known. Even though the
policy was printed in The Daily
Nov. 14, Smith said sending out
copies with explanatory letters is
"the simplest way to satisfy your
self that everyone's informed."
Dean of Undergraduate Stud
ies Tom Wasow said he thought
Stanford's previous alcohol and
drug policy "was an extremely
intelligent and enlightened one,
and the federal government
forced us to change it." He said,
"Given the constraints placed by
the federal government, the pol
icy Student Affairs has come up
with is as good as we can hope
for."
'Wasow said he doesn't think it
will affect faculty members other
than those who serve as resident
feHows. He added that faculty
student gatherings are "typically
not wild raucous affairs" and that
serving less alcohol will not
change them.
■Sue SchafTer, vice president for
Administrative Resources, said
the new policy should stop under
age students from being served
alcohol at faculty-student func
tions.
