University officials will send all Stan
ford employees a letter next month warn
ing that they could face disciplinary
action ranging from a warning to dis
missal if they violate Stanford's new drug
and alcohol policy.
Although the new policy prohibits
unlawful use and possession of both
drugs and alcohol in the workplace,
administrators said they are most con

cerned about faculty and staff providing
alcohol to underage students.
Manager of Employee Relations Keith
Smith said the main thrust of the
explanatory letter is "the need to insure
that alcohol is not provided to persons
under 21."
The Controlled Substances and Alco
hol Policy was drafted by the Office of
Student Affairs in response to the Drug-
Free Schools and Communities Act,
which required universities to expressly

prohibit the unlawful use of alcohol and
drugs on campus to maintain eligibility
for federal funds. The policy took effect
Oct. 1.
"People need to know that if they have
a party celebrating a birthday or an end of
term project and alcohol is served to a
minor, they're subject to University disci
pline," said Doug Dupen, deputy manager
of Employee Relations.
He gave the example of a supervisor
giving beer to an 18-year-old at a lab gath

ering. After the first offense, a warning
letter will appear on the supervisor's file,
Dupen said. The next time the University
will "get tougher," he added.
Dupen said most people know what is
legal and what is not. However, he noted,
"Before, it was none of the employer's
business, but now that we do have a pol
icy, we've got to do something about it."
Smith said a person serving alcohol to
minors "was already violating the law, but
is now also violating University rules."

But he added, "We don't intend to have
people standing there with armed guards
at the punch bowl."
Along with the letter, a copy of the new
policy will be sent to every faculty mem
ber and University employee early next
month.
The University policy prohibits the
"unlawful manufacture, distribution, dis
pensation, possession and/or use of con-
