The ASSU shouldn't speak for student body on national issues

THE ASSU HAS STRUCK AGAIN.
For the umpteenth time, the ASSU
overstepped its bounds with its
passage of a Nov. 15 bill stating its oppo
sition to U.S. actions in the Gulf Crisis.
The question I would pose to all those
senators who voted for it is, "From
where do you derive the authority to
make such a pronouncement?"
You were voted into your offices, not
to pass judgments on issues of national
political scope, but to act as a govern
mental body whose responsibility is to
address CAMPUS issues. Can you under
stand that? In case you can't, let me say
it again. CAMPUS issues.
When you ran for office, you did not
state your views on national political
questions, but on concerns and ideas
confined to University-related problems
and proposed solutions.
No one cared if you were pro-choice or
pro-life. No one cared if you were pro
intervention or pro-isolationist. No one
cared if you thought President Bush was
a good guy or an idiot. Do you under
stand? No one cared and no one asked.
Why? Because you were not expected
to voice your opinions on those matters.
If people wanted you to address those
types of topics, they . 'ould have asked
you for your position and would have
voted for you on the basis of your
answers.
But they didn't.
Therefore, you have no electoral basis
for your decision. And if you were capa
ble of reasoning through this process
yourselves, you would see that you had
no business passing that bill.
By passing that bill, you claimed to
speak for all of the Stanford student
body. Council of Presidents member
Ingrid Nava even proclaimed that it was
a righteous decision because, according
to The Daily, "she believes 'most stu
dents on the campus ... do not want
offensive action.'"
Did you know that for sure? Did you

You were voted into your offices, not to pass
judgments on issues of national political scope,
but to act as a governmental body whose
responsibility is to address campus issues.

ask?
Well, you did not ask me. And you do
not speak for me.
As a matter of fact, I whole-heartedly
disagree with you. I think that the pres
ence of U.S. troops in the Gulf is a very
good idea and I also think that with
drawing those troops would be a huge
mistake.
And while I would like to avoid war if
at all possible, I realize that sometimes

war is a necessary action, and so would
even support an offensive strike against
Iraq if the economic embargo fails. I
even have my reasons for this.
But you did not bother to ask.
One senator, Naomi Onaga, tried to
defend the passing of the bill by saying,
"Students are not exempted from the
draft. I think this is a very important
student issue."
Well, I hate to break it to you like this,

but there is no draft. Your argument
from that point of view is moot. And
even if there were a draft, it would not
be for the student government to voice
its opposition to it, because it possesses
no electoral foundation for such a judg
ment.
Perhaps the ASSU needs a new defini
tion of its purpose. As I see it, the
responsibilities of a student government
extend no further than student/adminis
tration/faculty relations.
The student government should
ONLY be concerned with issues pertain
ing to the proper course of campus life in
academic, social, administrative and fis
cal areas. Extra-campus affairs such as
abortion, the death penalty, foreign
affairs, etc. should be off-limits. It is not
your responsibility nor your right to
make policy in these matters.
If a member of the ASSU makes such
a statement on a national political issue,
he or she should make quite sure that it
is understood as a personal opinion, and
not an opinion representative of the stu
dent body as a whole. But most impor
tantly, the ASSU Senate, as a represen
tative and deliberative body, should not
utilize its time or its energy to deal with
extra-campus questions, for that is not
its purpose.
It is time for the ASSU to stop trying
to grab power to which it has no right.
This campus is supposed to work as a
democracy, so quit trying to transform it
into an oligarchy, or some other such
tyranny.
If Ingrid Nava, Noel Maurer and
Naomi Onaga, to name a few, feel that
they have to voice their opinions on
these matters then let them do it as a
personal statement, or under th« aus
pices of another, private organization.
Because while they claim to speak in
the name of the student body, they actu
ally have no mandate to do so.

responsibilities of a student government
extend no further than student/adminis
tration/faculty relations.
The student government should
ONLY be concerned with issues pertain
ing to the proper course of campus life in
academic, social, administrative and fis

abortion, the death penalty, foreign
affairs, etc. should be off-limits. It is not
your responsibility nor your right to
make policy in these matters.
If a member of the ASSU makes such
a statement on a national political issue,
he or she should make quite sure that it
is understood as a personal opinion, and
not an opinion representative of the stu

utilize its time or its energy to deal with
extra-campus questions, for that is not
its purpose.
It is time for the ASSU to stop trying
to grab power to which it has no right.
This campus is supposed to work as a
democracy, so quit trying to transform it
into an oligarchy, or some other such
tyranny.
If Ingrid Nava, Noel Maurer and
Naomi Onaga, to name a few, feel that
they have to voice their opinions on
these matters then let them do it as a
personal statement, or under th« aus

Because while they claim to speak in
the name of the student body, they actu

The ASSU shouldn't speak for student body on national issues

THE ASSU HAS STRUCK AGAIN.
For the umpteenth time, the ASSU
overstepped its bounds with its
passage of a Nov. 15 bill stating its oppo
sition to U.S. actions in the Gulf Crisis.
The question I would pose to all those
senators who voted for it is, "From
where do you derive the authority to
make such a pronouncement?"
You were voted into your offices, not
to pass judgments on issues of national
political scope, but to act as a govern
mental body whose responsibility is to
address CAMPUS issues. Can you under
stand that? In case you can't, let me say
it again. CAMPUS issues.
When you ran for office, you did not
state your views on national political
questions, but on concerns and ideas
confined to University-related problems
and proposed solutions.
No one cared if you were pro-choice or
pro-life. No one cared if you were pro
intervention or pro-isolationist. No one
cared if you thought President Bush was
a good guy or an idiot. Do you under
stand? No one cared and no one asked.
Why? Because you were not expected
to voice your opinions on those matters.
If people wanted you to address those
types of topics, they . 'ould have asked
you for your position and would have
voted for you on the basis of your
answers.
But they didn't.
Therefore, you have no electoral basis
for your decision. And if you were capa
ble of reasoning through this process
yourselves, you would see that you had
no business passing that bill.
By passing that bill, you claimed to
speak for all of the Stanford student
body. Council of Presidents member
Ingrid Nava even proclaimed that it was
a righteous decision because, according
to The Daily, "she believes 'most stu
dents on the campus ... do not want
offensive action.'"
Did you know that for sure? Did you

ask?
Well, you did not ask me. And you do
not speak for me.
As a matter of fact, I whole-heartedly
disagree with you. I think that the pres
ence of U.S. troops in the Gulf is a very
good idea and I also think that with
drawing those troops would be a huge
mistake.
And while I would like to avoid war if
at all possible, I realize that sometimes

war is a necessary action, and so would
even support an offensive strike against
Iraq if the economic embargo fails. I
even have my reasons for this.
But you did not bother to ask.
One senator, Naomi Onaga, tried to
defend the passing of the bill by saying,
"Students are not exempted from the
draft. I think this is a very important
student issue."
Well, I hate to break it to you like this,

but there is no draft. Your argument
from that point of view is moot. And
even if there were a draft, it would not
be for the student government to voice
its opposition to it, because it possesses
no electoral foundation for such a judg
ment.
Perhaps the ASSU needs a new defini
tion of its purpose. As I see it, the
responsibilities of a student government
extend no further than student/adminis
tration/faculty relations.
The student government should
ONLY be concerned with issues pertain
ing to the proper course of campus life in
academic, social, administrative and fis

abortion, the death penalty, foreign
affairs, etc. should be off-limits. It is not
