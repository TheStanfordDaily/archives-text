## Driving Miss Mom... 
### 
MY MOTHER JUST LEFT town
after a nice vacation here on the
West Coast, and it's a wonder
we're still alive.
There were no earthquakes, despite
her certainty that one would hit precisely
upon her arrival. And I did not crash the
car at every corner, despite the hair-rais
ing gasps and shrieks with which she
punctuated our voyages about town.
The euphemism for such a spectacle is
"back-seat driving," but this hardly cap
tures the zeal she displayed. I'd prefer
something more energetic, say Automo
bile-Based Maternal Bombardment
(ABMB). While I commend the Surgeon
General's efforts to protect the fetus from
maternal drinking, I wish he would make
some similar statement about the threat
to the post-adolescent posed by ABMB.
Mothers everywhere will surely bristle
at my suggestion that they are the only
offenders. Indeed they are not. But my
own unscientific poll confirmed that
mothers intervene in the automobile
more often and with far greater intensity
than other demographic groups. Perhaps
because they lack the normal social inhi
bitions against advice-giving.
If ever there were a behavior which
bent backward on itself, thoroughly
negating the intention which animated it,
this is it. The scenario goes something
like this:
You're driving along innocently
enough, maybe a couple miles per hour
over the speed limit. Gentle jazz on the
radio. Sun shining warmly through the
windshield. Mom by your side, taking in
the scenery.

Then suddenly, a terrifying shriek
straight out of a horror movie: "WATCH
OUT!!!" Reflexively, you slam on the
brakes. Your body is jolted forward, acti
vating the seat-belt restraint. The. car
behind nearly rear-ends you, its driver
too busy swerving to honk the horn. Your
heart races, sweat cascades from your
furrowed brow.
"What? What is it?" you implore your
mother breathlessly.
"Oh sorry, I thought that car was going
to pull out," she says matter-of-factly,
pointing to a car at the corner nearly a
block ahead which now inches forward
but continues to wait patiently to break
into the light traffic.
Mom's intention in such instances is
simply to anticipate hazards developing
on the road ahead and to ensure that pre
cautions are taken. And defensive driving
is a fine strategy when the individual
employing it is actually driving.
But the effect is reversed when it is
practiced — out loud — by passengers,
especially mothers. In such cases, the
anticipated dangers — whether they
materialize or not — are far outweighed
by the very real danger of scaring the hell
out of the driver.
In between these frantic, death-defy
ing moments, Mom provides running
commentary on my driving. I'm too close
to the center line. Or, alternately, too
close to the shoulder. If speed rather than
steering is the issue — say I'm purport
edly too close to the car in front of me —
the verbal remonstration will be rein
forced by her right foot as it instinctively
pursues an imaginary brake, moving

slightly to the left and then depressing
itself firmly, but vainly, into the floormat.
I'm thinking about buying one of those
dual-control driver's ed cars, and having
the instructor's side disengaged. That
way, when my mom visits, she can keep
herself busy with imaginary driving while
I get us safely to our destination.
The full extent of ABMB is hard to
measure, because its most frequent con
sequence is the "near-miss" rather than
the actual collision. My incidence of near
misses goes way up when Mom is in the
car, though I cannot convince her of this.
In fairness, perhaps a non-maternal
example is in order. A friend of
more inclined to offensive rather thin
defensive driving often reaches over at
her own discretion' ahd honks my horn if
she is upset with somebody else's driving.
In these days of pistol-toting drivers, this
could eventually prove as lethal as Mom's
interventions.
I know that mothers and friends mean
well. I'm not suggesting criminal penal
ties or anything. Like I said, just a state
ment from the Surgeon General (they
seem to work pretty well) and perhaps an
ABMB support group would do for
starters.

Speaking of driving, Daniel Abbasi hates
the whole drive-thru concept. He claims
that nobody's that busy.
