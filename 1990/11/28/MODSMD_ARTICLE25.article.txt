# What are Indirect costs?
## 
### 
Indirect costs of research
include Items such as electricity,
building depreciation, administra
tive expenses and use of the
library by researchers â€” Items that
are not easily attributable to a spe
cific research project.
Stanford's indirect cost rate is
74 percent, among the highest in
the nation.
That means that If a Stanford
professor wants to conduct
$10,000 worth of research, he or
she must obtain an extra $7,400 to
cover indirect costs.
