## Get into the groove: movements make Biomuse-ic

a three-part series examining the work of
Stanford researchers in musics and acous
tics.
Big Game, 2000 AD: The Stanford Band
takes the field, and all the members have
electrodes strapped to their arms, legs and
brains. They carry no instruments.
Suddenly, they start to move and the
most incredible rendition of "All Right

Now" kicks in
Is this ano
ther incompa
rable hoax?
No way!
The Band
could some
day be mak
ing music
from their

musclewaves and brainwaves with the help
Of a new Stanford invention: Biomuse.
Biomuse is a device which picks up brain
and muscle waves with electrical sensors
and converts them into music using com
puters and synthesizers.
With Biomuse, one can actually listen to
the human body in motion.
For example, Biomuse can be pro
grammed so that pitch is raised as muscle
tension increases. One could then play a
scale simply by lifting an arm.
Not only can one listen to the body, one
can actually create a whole symphony
directed with bodily movements.
All it takes is a little programming.
Calf action could control a percussion
section, thighs could direct the woodwinds,
arms could control the brass and the head

could be in charge of a string section. Start
jumping around and you have a one-man
band.
Biomuse is the brainchild of Stanford
audio researcher Hugh Lusted and Electri
cal Engineering Prof. Ben Knapp of San
Jose State University.
"I'd been dreaming of a device which
could directly interact with the human ner
vous system ever since high school," said
Lusted.
Lusted and Knapp (then an electrical
engineering student at Stanford) began col
laborating during the spring of 1987.
Amazingly, Knapp too had been envisioning
such a machine.
Within three weeks, the first Biomuse
protocol was operational.
"It was a crazy three weeks. We were up
late nights, running around, getting parts.
It was exciting," Lusted said.
The first Biomuse cost only about $100,
mainly for parts. It was a simple model in
which muscle intensity corresponded to
pitch. Contracting a muscle would raise the
pitch, relaxing would lower it.
Lusted compared this setup to a fretless
instrument such as the violin.
"You had to learn where the increments
were," said Lusted, meaning how much
tension one must exert in order to raise the
pitch one note.
Knapp and Lusted then took their cre
ation to John Chowning, Director of Stan
ford's Center for Computer Research in
Music and Acoustics. Chowning gave the
two inventors a vote of confidence and was
excited about Biomuse as a new form of
expression for musicians.

Stanford audio researcher Hugh Lusted busts a move to demonstrate his new Invention, Blomuse. Through electrodes
attached to various parts of the body, Blomuse can translate body movements and brainwaves Into music.
Biomuse was soon patented
through Stanford.
In 1988, a second, much more
elaborate Biomuse was ready.
This one was about five times as
expensive and required "enor

mous amounts of labor," said
Lusted.
If Biomuse were to be mar
keted as a consumer item, Lusted
anticipates that it would initially
retail for about $2,000. However,
a "high-end institutional model
with advanced, specialized fea
tures" could cost upwards of five
or ten thousand dollars.
Lusted is enthusiastic about

hooking up Biomuse with Macin
tosh computers.
Conceivably, "Biomuse for the
Mac" would allow the user to
specify a part of the body to con
trol a specific instrument at a cer
tain volume using pull-down
menus on the Mac.
Biomuse is scheduled to make
an appearance at the Mac World
convention being held in San

Francisco in January.
Biomuse is also being imple
mented as a musical instrument
by D'Cuckoo, a Bay Area elec
tronic marimba group which
develops its own electronic trig
gering devices.
Many possible spinoff inven
tions from the basic Biomuse
technology are already being
experimented with.

Lusted and Knapp have
already developed a device which
tracks eye motion.
With this tool, one can actually
move a cursor on a computer
screen just by looking left, right,
up or down.
Lusted and Knapp recently
demonstrated how this technol
ogy allows one to play a video
game without a joystick. Their

"eye controller" plugs into the
joystick jack of a computer. The
player then directs his eyes to
move his playing piece.
Such a tool would not only be
of interest to couch potatoes and
Nintendo junkies but could also
be a valuable tool for paralysis
victims, opening up the world of
computers and music to the
severely disabled.
