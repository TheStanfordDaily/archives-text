# Reading between the lines: What's really in a Twinkie
## 
### June Cohen Editorial staff 
What is carrageenan anyway?
My roommate posed this ques
tion while perusing the research
for this column.
Perhaps you've pondered this
— albeit briefly — after gathering
the courage to actually read the
ingredient list on your favorite
junk food.
I Or not.

While struggling through Niet
zsche and 50-pound microbiology
texts, the last thing most students
want to do is read something else
they don't understand.
Ingredient lists are indeed
formidable — big, scary looking
words with frightening implica
tions written with blurry ink on
the crease of a plastic wrapper.
If you dare attempt to read this
list, you may find yourself won
dering: Should you really be eat
ing things you can't pronounce?
And why does something as
small as a Twinkie need so many
ingredients?
What could they possibly be
for?
Well, the good news is that not
all of these ingredients are bad for
you — some of those big words
signify vitamins or natural ingre
dients.
The bad news is ... well, let's
take a look through the Hostess
cabinet and you can judge for

yourself.
Case study: the Twinkie
The first ingredient of this pop
ular snack is corn syrup.
What, not sugar?
Don't be fooled. It may sound
healthier, but corn syrup, a sweet
syrup prepared from cornstarch,
is simply another form of sugar.
Corn syrup is also used in the
sticky stuff on envelopes and
stamps. Mmm.
Next is enriched flour, that

is, flour with several nutrients
added to it, including "Niacin (a
'B' vitamin), Iron (Ferrous Sul
fate), Thiamine Mononitrate
OBI') and Riboflavin 0B2').
All these 'enriching' nutrients
are good for you, but are added in
such minute amounts that you
definitely shouldn't count on
them to bolster your health.
Sugar and water, the next two
ingredients, are pretty self
explanatory.
Next, the wrapper reads: "par
tially hydrogenated vegetable

and/or animal shortening
(contains one or more of: canola
oil, corn oil, cottonseed oil, soy
bean oil, beef fat)."
First of all, for those of you
who, like Engineering Prof. Gil
Masters, are unfamiliar with
cooking recipes, shortening means
any kind of fat, such as the oils
listed above.
Canola oil is a monounsatuar
ted fat and is currently viewed as
the healthiest cooking oil. in
terms of lowering cholesterol and
Beef fat, or lard, however, is a sat
urated fat, and is considered one
of the worst.
The words "and/or" and "con
tains one or more of" signify that
the company can pretty much use
whichever one they want to;
which usually equates with
whichever is cheapest.
You're probably familiar with
eggs and skim milk.
Twinkies contain less than 2
percent of the rest of these ingre
dients.
Whey, as in 'curds and...' is
the liquid remaining after fat and
certain proteins are removed from
milk.
Modified starch is ordinary
starch which has been chemically
altered to control thickening or
jelling.
The chemicals used for starch
modification may be difficult for
babies to metabolize. You are
probably not an infant, so you're
OK on this one.
Salt.
Leavening causes dough to
rise. Twinkies use baking soda,
monocalcium phosphate and/or

sodium acid-pyrophosphate to
accomplish this. None of these are
known to be toxic.
Lecithin is one of those ingre
dients you see all the time, in
breakfast cereals, candy and
bread, but probably never know
what it is.
And perhaps you don't care.
But if you do, it is a natural
antioxidant, meaning it prevents
spoilage of fatty products.
also an emulsifier, meaning it
maintains a specific consistency in
the Twinkie.
Cellulose Gum is made from
the cell walls of plants. It also
functions in maintaining that spe
cial Twinkie consistency.
My mother never let any prod
uct with Polysorbate 60 into our
household.
Polysorbate 60 is an emulsifer
(see lecithin) which has been asso
ciated with a specific contaminant
known to cause cancer in animals.
No toxicity is known for humans,
however.
Sodium caseinate is a solu
ble form of milk protein which is
used as a texturizer in ice cream,
frozen custard ice milk, and —
one can only assume — Twinkie
filling.
Natural and artificial fla
vors. Pretty self-explanatory,
except that artificial flavorings
may be made with all natural
ingredients.
Any ingredient with no coun
terpart in nature must be classi
fied as artificial.
Artificial color (yellow No.

5). Ever wonder what was wrong
with yellow No. 5 that manufac
turers have to list it specifically?
Well, it turns out that Yellow
No. 5 is made from certain chemi
cals such as tartrazine, which
some individuals are allergic to.
Tartrazine is a bright orange
yellow powder derived from tar.
People who are allergic to aspirin
are frequently allergic to tar
trazine as well.
- Finally, sorbic acid if added to
qnniW."
Although sorbic acicl is practi
cally noii-raOfe it maf*cause skin
irritation in sensitive individuals,
and has caused cancer when
injected in large doses under the
skin of rodents.
Another forbidden ingredient
of my childhood, sorbic acid is
used to prevent the growth of
mold and yeast, and helps give
Twinkies that unbelievable shelf
life.
By the way, carrageenan is not
a component of Twinkies, but it is
found in canned whipped cream,
ice cream, chocolate-flavored
drinks, chocolate milk and other
chocolate products (funny it
should sound familiar) and is
another emulsifier.
Seaweed-like in odor, car
rageenan is derived from Irish
Moss and has been known to
cause cancer when iryected under
the skin of animals and to lower
their rates of survival when
ingested.

What is carrageenan anyway?
My roommate posed this ques
tion while perusing the research
for this column.
Perhaps you've pondered this
— albeit briefly — after gathering
the courage to actually read the
ingredient list on your favorite
junk food.
I Or not.

While struggling through Niet
zsche and 50-pound microbiology
texts, the last thing most students
want to do is read something else
they don't understand.
Ingredient lists are indeed
formidable — big, scary looking
words with frightening implica
tions written with blurry ink on
the crease of a plastic wrapper.
If you dare attempt to read this
list, you may find yourself won
dering: Should you really be eat
ing things you can't pronounce?
And why does something as
small as a Twinkie need so many
ingredients?
What could they possibly be
for?
Well, the good news is that not
all of these ingredients are bad for
you — some of those big words
signify vitamins or natural ingre
dients.
The bad news is ... well, let's
take a look through the Hostess
cabinet and you can judge for

yourself.
Case study: the Twinkie
The first ingredient of this pop
ular snack is corn syrup.
What, not sugar?
Don't be fooled. It may sound
healthier, but corn syrup, a sweet
syrup prepared from cornstarch,
is simply another form of sugar.
Corn syrup is also used in the
sticky stuff on envelopes and
stamps. Mmm.
Next is enriched flour, that

is, flour with several nutrients
added to it, including "Niacin (a
'B' vitamin), Iron (Ferrous Sul
fate), Thiamine Mononitrate
OBI') and Riboflavin 0B2').
All these 'enriching' nutrients
are good for you, but are added in
such minute amounts that you
definitely shouldn't count on
them to bolster your health.
Sugar and water, the next two
ingredients, are pretty self
explanatory.
Next, the wrapper reads: "par
tially hydrogenated vegetable

and/or animal shortening
(contains one or more of: canola
oil, corn oil, cottonseed oil, soy
bean oil, beef fat)."
First of all, for those of you
who, like Engineering Prof. Gil
Masters, are unfamiliar with
cooking recipes, shortening means
any kind of fat, such as the oils
listed above.
Canola oil is a monounsatuar
ted fat and is currently viewed as
the healthiest cooking oil. in
terms of lowering cholesterol and
Beef fat, or lard, however, is a sat
urated fat, and is considered one
of the worst.
The words "and/or" and "con
tains one or more of" signify that
the company can pretty much use
whichever one they want to;
which usually equates with
whichever is cheapest.
You're probably familiar with
eggs and skim milk.
Twinkies contain less than 2
percent of the rest of these ingre
dients.
Whey, as in 'curds and...' is
the liquid remaining after fat and
certain proteins are removed from
milk.
Modified starch is ordinary
starch which has been chemically
altered to control thickening or
jelling.
The chemicals used for starch
modification may be difficult for
babies to metabolize. You are
probably not an infant, so you're
OK on this one.
Salt.
Leavening causes dough to
rise. Twinkies use baking soda,
monocalcium phosphate and/or

sodium acid-pyrophosphate to
accomplish this. None of these are
known to be toxic.
Lecithin is one of those ingre
dients you see all the time, in
breakfast cereals, candy and
bread, but probably never know
what it is.
And perhaps you don't care.
But if you do, it is a natural
antioxidant, meaning it prevents
spoilage of fatty products.
also an emulsifier, meaning it
maintains a specific consistency in
the Twinkie.
Cellulose Gum is made from
the cell walls of plants. It also
functions in maintaining that spe
cial Twinkie consistency.
My mother never let any prod
uct with Polysorbate 60 into our
household.
Polysorbate 60 is an emulsifer
(see lecithin) which has been asso
ciated with a specific contaminant
known to cause cancer in animals.
No toxicity is known for humans,
however.
Sodium caseinate is a solu
ble form of milk protein which is
used as a texturizer in ice cream,
frozen custard ice milk, and —
one can only assume — Twinkie
filling.
Natural and artificial fla
vors. Pretty self-explanatory,
except that artificial flavorings
may be made with all natural
ingredients.
Any ingredient with no coun
terpart in nature must be classi
fied as artificial.
Artificial color (yellow No.

5). Ever wonder what was wrong
with yellow No. 5 that manufac
turers have to list it specifically?
Well, it turns out that Yellow
No. 5 is made from certain chemi
cals such as tartrazine, which
some individuals are allergic to.
Tartrazine is a bright orange
yellow powder derived from tar.
People who are allergic to aspirin
are frequently allergic to tar
trazine as well.
- Finally, sorbic acid if added to
qnniW."
Although sorbic acicl is practi
cally noii-raOfe it maf*cause skin
irritation in sensitive individuals,
and has caused cancer when
injected in large doses under the
skin of rodents.
Another forbidden ingredient
of my childhood, sorbic acid is
used to prevent the growth of
mold and yeast, and helps give
Twinkies that unbelievable shelf
life.
By the way, carrageenan is not
a component of Twinkies, but it is
found in canned whipped cream,
ice cream, chocolate-flavored
drinks, chocolate milk and other
chocolate products (funny it
should sound familiar) and is
another emulsifier.
Seaweed-like in odor, car
rageenan is derived from Irish
Moss and has been known to
cause cancer when iryected under
the skin of animals and to lower
their rates of survival when
ingested.
