Healthy and wealthy
Stanford Shopping Center
— where Palo Alto yuppies
turn to find the cutting edge of
style: the latest fashions, high
tech gadgets, nouveau cuisine.
But this pricey open-air mall
is home to another first-of-its
kind innovation — the nation's
first, and as of yet, only health
library.
In between holiday shopping
and gourmet coffee breaks,
shoppers can investigate home
treatment of hemorrhoids or
the pros and cons of proges
terone treatment for premen
strual syndrome.
Two years ago, Dr. Walter
Bortz 11, associate professor of
medicine, suggested putting a
library in the mall, in order to
provide a large number of peo
ple access to health informa
tion.
Although his colleagues
laughed at the suggestion, the
library has proved a success so
far, according to an article pub
lished in a recent issue of
American Medical News.
Installed in August, 1989,
the library attracted 11,350
health-conscious shoppers over
its first 12 months.
Local techie hero
President George Bush pre
sented the National Medal of
Technology to Dr. Chauncey
Starr, the founding president
of the Electric Power Research
Institute (EPRI) in Palo Alto.
The medal is awarded annu
ally in recognition of excep
tional contributions to the
nation and society through the

development or application of
technology.
Starr was recognized for his
contributions to energy pro
duction and policy, pioneering
work in the development of
nuclear energy, organizing
EPRI and playing a leading
role in the development of
engineering education pro
grams.
U.S. affects global
greenhouse effect
The United States is now
the only wealthy Western
nation that has not made a spe
cific commitment to reduce
carbon dioxide emissions by
the end of the century.
The second World Climate
Conference was held in
Geneva, Switzerland last week,
and in the weeks leading up to
the summit, 18 Western Euro
pean nations, along with Aus
tralia, Japan, New Zealand and
several other nations, announ
ced their plans to stabilize car
bon dioxide emissions.
Carbon dioxide is a green
house gas which is the primary
cause of global warming.
In drafting the conference's
final declaration, U.S. negotia
tors blocked attempts to place
specific timetables on industri
alized nations' reduction of
carbon dioxide emissions.
Other nations resisting such
restrictions include the Soviet
Union, due to their failing
economy, and China, due to
their low per capita emissions
of carbon dioxide.
