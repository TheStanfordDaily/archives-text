# Profs.: Bush can't declare war alone
## Stanford teachers help write draft saying he must get consent of Congress 
### Anna Rabinowicz Staff writer 
Two Stanford law professors
joined nine of the nation's fore
most constitutional law scholars
in a brief urging a federal court to
rule that President Bush cannot
go to war against Iraq without
Congress' consent.
Law Profs. Gerald Gunther
and John Hart Ely are part of the
academic coalition that formu
lated the 13-page brief.
The brief states that Congress
alone has the constitutional
authority to declare war. In an
interview yesterday, Gunther
said, "I hope it will stiffen the
backbone of Congress to take its
responsibility seriously."
In addition, the document

states that the courts must not
shirk their responsibility to rule
on issues involving the War Pow
ers Act, which requires the presi
dent to recall forces if Congress
does not declare war within a 60-
day period after military action is
taken or extend by law the 60-day
period. Courts cannot contend the
issue is merely a political argu
ment between two branches of
government, the brief holds.
President Bush has asserted he
has fulfilled his constitutional
obligation by conferring with
Congress during the Persian Gulf
crisis.
The brief is part of a suit
brought last week by 45 Demo
cratic congressmen who are trying
to guarantee that Congress will

heard Dec. 4 in Federal District
Court in Washington, D.C.
Signers of the brief want to
show that support for an exten
sive congressional role in the deci
sion about war is non-partisan,
Gunther scud. "We represent a
broad political spectrum â€” liber
als, moderates, conservatives....
Our opinions differ on all sorts of

things; on this issue, we are as
one," he said.
Other signers include law pro
fessors from the University of
Chicago and Columbia, Duke,
Harvard and Yale Universities, as
well as a former State Department
legal adviser.
Gunther said his and Ely's
actions do not carry a seal of
approval from Stanford. "The
brief explicitly states that our
affiliations are only used for iden
tification purposes," he noted.
Harold Koh, a professor at Yale
Law School who drafted the brief,
said, "We are a distinguished
group specialized in this area. ...
