Q m Does repeatedly picking
• warts cause cancer? What
aoout scabsf
A .Picking on one's teaching
• assistant has been known to
cause all types of medical prob
lems, but repeatedly picking at
one's scabs is not known to cause
cancer.
Although there seems to be
something innately satisfying
about toying with scabs, hang
nails, warts, zits and other skin
disturbances, this is not the rec
ommended course of therapy.
Not only can this prolong the
healing process, but picking can
also promote scarring of the skin.
Playing with warts isn't quite
like playing with fire, but one is
playing with a virus. Warts are
caused by one of a variety of
viruses called human papilloma
viruses (HPV).
This name is typical of the
medical profession's pompous
obfuscation since "papilloma" is
just a derivative of the Latin word
for wart.
The cells in a wart are regular

human skin cells which have been
infected with HPV
Inside these cells, copies of the
HPV's DNA direct the skin cells to
proliferate, forming the wart.
This is typical of viruses, which
act as parasites within the host's
cells and force them to produce
more viruses.
The most common warts are
caused by types of HPV that have
not been known to cause cancer.
However, many of the rarer
types of warts are caused by

viruses which do have oncogenic
(cancer-causing) potential. These
warts are found primarily on the
genital region and also near the
larynx, and the cancers that they
cause develop only rarely
Since warts appear to be spread
from person to person, it is best
not to pick them or cut them ofF
and trade them. This can cause
spreading of the warts on oneself
and perhaps to others.
Although many warts will sim
ply disappear over time, wart
removal is a common medical pro
cedure. Since most treatments
involve burning the warts off with
chemicals, heat or cryogenic liq
uids, genital warts should best be
left in professional hands.
Q . What does LD-50 mean ?
A. Since poisoning is just a
• matter of dosage, LD-50 is
used to measure chemical toxicity.
It is the level of a particular chem
ical required to kill 50 percent of
the test subjects, usually rats, and
by extrapolation, humans. It is
usually given in units of
milligrams of chemical per kilo
gram of the test subject's body
weight and gives a relative mea
sure of poisonousness.

Although there seems
to be something
innately satisfying
about toying with
scabs, hangnails,
warts, zits and other
skin disturbances,
this is not the recom
mended course of
therapy.

For example, the extremely
toxic nerve gas Sarin (isopropyl
methyl phosphonofluoridate) has
an LD-50 of less than 0.01 mg/kg
in humans (don't ask us how they
know), so a drop the size of a grain
of salt will most likely do you in.
Aspirin, usually considered
more benign, has an LD-50 of
2000 mg/kg whereas alcohol's is
13,700 mg/kg for rats. This is only
slightly less toxic than Tresidder
entries, where half our subjects
died, and the others wished for
death, after only two bacon double
cheeseburgers. As far as Tresidder
goes, we suggest that you "just
say no." «
