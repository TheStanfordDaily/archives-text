						message to St. Nick: A new system in our stocking

### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
The pervasive theme of the Computer
Corner Christmas Wish List is that you
can never have enough power. In the com
ing paragraphs, I will tell you what I want
for my personal Macintosh use and for
our system here at The Daily.
Keep in mind, that the wish list is just
that. There is no delusion that any or all
of it will be fulfilled. With that caveat, let
me begin:
'Next, please'
As anyone with a Macintosh network
knows, Apple Share servers are not exact
ly speed demons. In order to get high per
formance from your file server, you need
to blow about six grand on a Ilfx and still
your saddled with a 68030 processor and
Apple's dreadful implementation of
SCSI.
Imagine if you could get a 68040-based
machine with a SCSI-2 interface to serve
as your network repository. Imagine if
the machine was UNIX-based, supported
true multitasking and could be used as a
nifty workstation in the off hours when
the server wasn't busy. Now for the best
part.

Imagine you could buy this machine
for $3,300 at your friendly neighborhood
Bookstore.
Guess what? You can . . . sort of. The
machine is made by Next, Inc. and since
Motorola began volume shipments of the
040 yesterday, it should be available with
in a few weeks. Unfortunately, there isn't
yet an Apple Share clone that runs on the
Next.
We here at the Wish List hope someone
writes one soon — and sells it for under
$1,000.
Two score and seven . . .
Meanwhile back in Cupertino, the
Apple engineers are hard at work on an
040 machine of their own that will run
almost all existing Mac software. Sadly, it
will probably not be ready until next sum
mer and will undoubtedly set you back
about $7,000 — enough to buy two Nexts
and a decent VCR.
More exciting for the typical Macin
tosh user is System 7, that wonderful
operating system upgrade that promises
to revolutionize the way we use comput
ers. It's already way behind schedule and
Apple's not promising it before June.
That doesn't mean we can't keep our
fingers crossed for an earlier delivery.

Apparently, the beta ver
sion is rock solid — nearly
as much so as the new Sys
tem 6.0.7, which is giving
Ilsi and Classic users
nuyor headaches.
Not only will System 7
give us a new finder that
actually finds files (it can
even tell our dog-slow
servers to search locally),
it will let loose a flood of
1 A • A

upgrades from companies that are hold
ing back revisions until Apple gives
birth to its new baby.
Microsoft has rewritten everything,
including Word and Excel. They've also
put together a database that promises to
shake up the market.
If and when seven-oh ships, the Mac
will once again be the hot software plat
form. It will do things Windows-users can
only dream about. And, while the Next is
still sexy, there are a couple million Macs
out there and a couple thousand Jobs
boxes.
The $2 billion quarter
No, not a numismatists dream, instead
Computer Corner hopes Apple hits the
jackpot with the Classic, Ilsi and the

soon-to-be-released LC
and makes a ton of money.
If the dough rolls in, the
heads will stop rolling
back on the Apple campus.
A stable Apple is much
more likely to be a produc
tive Apple than one that's
constantly reorganizing
and forcing upper-level
managers to resign.
Recently, it has come to

light that a bunch of geniuses upstairs
tried to kill the LC at every turn. This is
the computer that's going to sell by the
boatload since education, business and
home users are all clamoring for it. But it
didn't fit with some marketing wizards'
notion of how the Mac line should shake
out and almost never saw the light of day.
Fortunately, a cadre of Apple employ
ees, in the spirit of the firm's early days,
worked on the project in secret and
impressed the right people at the right
time when they got it finished. Thanks to
them, it's coming our way.
The bigger Apple is, the more capable
it will be of providing customer support
and service, designing newer and better
products, and serving as an innovator,
helping to keep the computer industry

strong.
'No problem, pal'
Most of you are probably more than a
little tired of seeing the bomb icon and
those six dreaded words: "Sorry, a system
error has occurred."
Wouldn't you feel a little better if the
Mac occasionally just let you know that
everything was A-OK in RAM City? While
that feature isn't likely to be implemented
soon, there is something you can do today.
Using a number of programs including
Fedit, Symantec Utilities for the Macin
tosh and CE Software's Heap Fixer, you
can increase the size of your system heap.
All those INITs and desk accessories
you have running take up a chunk of
memory and the system has to keep track
of them. Sometimes it fails to do so and
gives up the ghost. A lot of crashes are
caused by an "overflow" in the heap mem
ory.
Assuming you've got enough RAM (it's
down to about $40 per one-megabyte
SIMM), allot an extra 300-400K to the old
heap. You won't notice any difference,
except when your Mac stops crashing.
