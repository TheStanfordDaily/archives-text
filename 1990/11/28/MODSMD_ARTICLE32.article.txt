"I was worried about us looking past this
competition," said Stanford coach Chris
Horpel. "Our guys are looking good. We're
still making some technical errors, but I'm
pleased with the conditioning and mental
aspects."
The team took the lead early and built on
it. In the 118-pound bout Phil Nowick shut
out Mark Zonligt with a 17-0 technical fall,
earning the Cardinal a 5-0 lead.
Jay Jackson executed a two-point rever
sal in the last five seconds to pull out a vic
tory against Brett Spaid in the 126-pound
bout. Jackson had two quick takedowns to
lead 4-1. Spaid executed a two-point rever
sal and an escape to take a 1 point edge.
Working the right leg, Jackson came back
with several takedowns to set up the last
second reversal.
Stanford's lone loss came in the 134-

pound match. SF-State's Matt Machon
dominated Matt Duckworth for a 18-4
major decision. Machon nearly pinned
Duckworth several times while scoring 13
straight points. Stanford's lead was cut to
8-4.
James Dinette made sure that the
Gators would not get any closer. He took
command of the 142-pound contest early
and beat Erik Carcamo 10-3.
In the 150-pound bout Dave Sacks
pinned Greg Lewis at 4:42 to extend the
lead to 17-4. "Dave was concerned about
not being big enough for the weight class
since he wrestled at 134 pounds last year,"
said Horpel, "but he's done really well."
Matt Topham increased the lead to 21-4
with a 12-3 win over LeMarlin Cooper in
the 158-pound class. Co-captain and
nationally No. 1-ranked Steve Buddie
destroyed Robert Gray 18-4 in the 167-
pound bout to clinch the team victory, 25-4.
In the 177-pound match Steve
Yarbrough dominated Bill Pedersen for the
major decision, 17-5.
"I knew San Francisco State probably
wasn't going to be as tough as some of the
competition I'm probably going to run into
this weekend [at the upcoming Las Vegas
Invitational]," said Yarbrough.
Mark Graham continued the onslaught
by shutting out Simon Keifer 15-0 in the
190-pound bout for the technical fall. Stan
ford forfeited the heavyweight bout to fin
ish the team match, 35-10.
Next for the Cardinal grapplers is the
Las Vegas Invitational this weekend.

It really wasn't much of a contest at noisy Burham Pavilion last night. Without one of their top wrestlers, the San Francisco
State Gators were virtually Impotent against the Cardinal grapplers, who munched them 35-10. Dave Sacks moved up two
weight classes but still managed to pin his opponent to help lead Stanford to victory.
