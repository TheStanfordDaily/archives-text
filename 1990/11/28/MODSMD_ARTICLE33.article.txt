# Cardinal fans, rejoice! Hoops fever has hit the Farm
## 
### 
As the winter winds begin to blow
and November's parting brings on
December's chill, the frostbitten
Cardinal sports fan can finally come in
from the cold: it's time for hoops on the
Farm.
Three years ago, when I first located
Maples Pavilion on the campus map and
straggled in from the throes of the winter
rain to catch the Cardinal, basketball was
merely that: a sanctuary in which to stay
warm and wait for the defending cham
pion baseball and tennis teams to begin
play and hail the advent of spring. Who
cared about basketball in California?
Buying football tickets was obligatory,
but when the ticket seller pushed the
combination football/basketball package
on me (this was before someone dreamed
up the "all-sports pass" concept), I was
skeptical. We had a basketball team? We
had two basketball teams? Were they any
good?
Three years, three NCAA tourney
appearances, three big upsets, and one
national title later, I have my answer.
Stanford basketball is very good, and
worth the price of admission.
The Stanford women's basketball
team achieved the pinnacle of their sport
last season with an NCAA championship,
which they won on national television in
convincing fashion. The sparkling squad
missed a perfect 33-0 season by a mere
three points. The Cardinal entered this
season with three returning starters and
a No. 2 ranking.
The Stanford men, under the leader
ship of Mike Montgomery, have returned
all five starters off last year's NIT tour

ney team. Always an upset threat, the
Cardinal are picked by many to finish as
high as third in the Pacific 10 Conference,
which already boasts No. 2 Arizona and
No. 12 UCLA.
I don't care if it's 85 degrees out — I'm
definitely goin' to some games.
This, of course, was not always so.
There was good reason for skepti
cism in the fall of 1987. The Stan
ford women were a young team (that
year's media guide cover had the players
posing at the fountain in front of Old
Union with the slogan "Stanford discov
ers the fountain of youth!"), and were
coming off an unexciting 14-14 season the
previous year. A few seasons before, the
team had posted an embarassing 5-23
mark. Few people attended women's
hoops games.
The men were a similar unknown
quantity, youthful but unproven. Just
before Freshman Orientation, I read in a
Bay Area paper that Stanford's chances
for a banner season were dashed by an
injury to center Eric Reveno. He would
redshirt that year. They had some guy
named Lichti (is that pronounced

"Licked-eye?"), but as a rule, no one gave
Stanford basketball any respect.
But, that year, the rules changed.
Women's coach Tara VanDerveer, enter
ing her third year, made it known that
losing would not be tolerated. With a
freshman class that included Sonja Hen
ning and Trisha Stevens, VanDerveer set
about enforcing her "take no prisoners"
attitude on the Pac-10 and the rest of the
country. The team's record jumped to an
astounding 27-5, with win streaks of 11
and 14 games, and made it to the Sweet
Sixteen at NCAAs before bowing to
Texas.
Not to be outdone, the men aleo made>.
great strides. Lichti proved to be the best
kept secret in the East Coast-biased col
lege basketball world, and classmate
Howard Wright asserted himself as a top
quality big man. But few took notice of
the Cardinal until February 2,1988. That
was the date of The Miracle at Maples.
The long-maligned Pac-10 was finally
getting respect, thanks to the efforts of
Lute Olson and the Arizona Wildcats. The
Wildcats entered Maples that night as the
No. 1 team in the country, with hopes of
going through the Pac-10 unbeaten. The
Cardinal played a game for the ages, hold
ing Arizona stars Sean Elliot and Steve
Kerr in check and beating the 'Cats by
eight. Upset number one.
Suddenly, people knew who Stanford
was. Although the year ended in disap
pointment as the NCAA selection com
mittee passed over the 21-12 Cardinal,
the foundation had been laid.

The following year, football was passe, and basketball
became the obsession. Everyone went to the games,
including the women. And why not? VanDerveer's team
was dominant, setting a league record with an 18-0 con
ference mark, and going 28-3 overall. A loss to
Louisiana Tech in the Elite Eight was a disappointment.

Final Four aspirations.
To men's fans, 1988-89 was simply
"The Journey to the Tourney." Lichti and
Wright were all-America candidates.
Reveno was back. Adam Keefe was the
most promising recruit in years. Stanford
had an outside shot at the Pac-10 title,
and were shoe-ins for its first NCAA tour
ney appearance in 47 — count 'em, 47 —
years. The lines outside Maples before the
game against a good California team were
forming at 1 p.m.
That game, which was on ESPN and
featured a breakaway, 360-degree dunk
by Lichti that I will never forget, was sec
ond in excitment only to Miracle at
Maples 11. Arizona had dominated the
Pac-10, still had Elliot and forward

Anthony Cook . . . and Stanford slapped
them down again, 83-78. Upset number
two was the high point of a terrific season
(26-7, second in the league).
Unfortunately, nunfber tlwe®
was the low point, a shocking first-round
loss to unheard-of Siena College in the
NCAA tournament. The journey was a
short one, but memorable nevertheless.
All of you but the freshmen doubtless
need no prompting to recall last year.
Despite the graduation of Lichti, Wright,
and Reveno, the men retained a level of
respectability and Keefe's brilliant play
began to emerge. The women had four
starters back, including All-World Jen
nifer Azzi. They were unstoppable all
year, and broke Stanford's name into the
college basketball "Prime Time" zone
with the NCAA title.
And now, basketball is here again. I get
a warm feeling just thinking about it.

would get zero work done during college
hoops season.
