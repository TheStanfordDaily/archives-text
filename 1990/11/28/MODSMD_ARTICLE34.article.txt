# Sailing finishes third in international regatta
## 
### Deborah Claymon 
Stanford sailors spent a very
politically correct Thanksgiving
challenging both national and
Japanese competitors in the 1990
U.S.-Japan Goodwill Intercolle
giate Regatta. Stanford placed a
close third behind last year's
national champions UC-Irvine
and East coast powerhouse
Georgetown.
With much multicultural flair,
senior Dave Dowd finished in the
front of "A" division. Despite light,
shifty wind conditions, his consis
tently strong finishes were the
key to the team's overall third
place. Stanford held first place for
the first two days of racing. The
top Japanese boat finished in
fifth.
Stanford paired Dowd and
Catherine Ivey in "A" division
with seniors Rick Rosen and
Rebecca Bryson in "B," hoping to
take the regatta. An unfortunate
disqualification on Saturday put
Rosen back in the fleet. Dowd
managed the sporadic wind with
confidence, staying in the top ten
of any race in the regatta.
Rosen and Bryson garnered
more first place bullets than any
other combination, but struggled
to gain consistency.
"The disqualification really
hurt, and unfortunately we just
couldn't make up the ten points
we needed," said a disappointed
Rosen, who finished fourth in
division.
Hosted by Nikken Lease Group
from Japan, this cross-cultural
experience is unique to any Inter
collegiate competition. The
Japanese learned simple English

racing terms, like starboard and
sea room, in order to make com
munication possible on the water.
Extremely light wind in New
port Harbor greatly challenged
the racing. "I like the flukey con
ditions because it takes patience.
You have to be really alert and
focused on the changes," said
Dowd, who came back strongly on
the second day with a 1-2-1.
Dowd has sailed varsity at
Stanford for four years. This sea
son, he and Ivey are one of the
Cardinal's finest pairs, having
won division in all but one
regatta. Ivey, a sophomore and a
women's skipper, is sailing with
Dowd this year to gain more colle
giate racing experience.
"There is no experience like
being up with the top sailors every
race. I learn so much by watching
what's happening with the wind
and how the others are reacting,"
said Ivey.
Thinking back on the racing
this weekend, Ivey said that Dowd
"did a really good job of not over
reacting when the wind died. He
was really patient in the boat and
the first person in the fleet to cap
italize on the wind shifts."
The Cardinal is disappointed at
the loss, but Dowd and the rest of
the team definitely think there is
potential for Stanford's ranking
to go up this year. As the season
progresses, the team will compete
in more national intersectionals.
"It's very important that Stan
ford spends time sailing against
the power schools from the East
Coast," said Dowd.
The team's goal is to have per
formance peak when Nationals
are close at hand next spring.
