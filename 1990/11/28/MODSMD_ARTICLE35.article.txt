Before The Big Game
fades away, you might be
interested to learn of an
early one when Stanford!
won with the aid of super
natural powers.
In 1900 Charles K. Frield
and Will Irwin (who worked
on the S.F. Chronicle) col
laborated on a book called
Stanford Stories.
In one of these [stories],
"The Substituted Fullback,"
a star Stanford fullback dies
during the football season.
But in his last moments he
tells a psychology prof, "I'll
come back somehow... if
there is anything in it."
So naturally his spirit
returns during The Big
Game to animate a "scrub
fullback" who makes a sen
sational run to break a 6-6
tie.
I just bought a second edi
tion (1913) and was interest
ed to learn that at the turn
of the century the team had
no name at all — though the
color "cardinal" is men
tioned — and that the game
with Berkeley (not yet called
The Big Game) was played
on Thanksgiving Day in San
Francisco, where both teams
stayed at hotels.
Regards from an alum
who, when he writes to Herb
Caen, signs himself Penin
sula Pete.
