# Forum held on proposed DR changes

Two days before the Faculty Senate is
scheduled to vote on proposed changes to the
distribution requirements, about 30 students
attended a meeting last night to express their
concerns on the issue to faculty members.
Four professors present at the meeting held
in Larkin — History Profs. Peter Duus and
Jack Rakove, Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy and Electrical Engineering Prof.
Anthony Siegman — gave their opinions on
the present system of requirements, the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Studies proposal
and the Abernethy proposal.
Duus began by explaining the committee

proposal, which would add two new full distri
bution requirements — World Cultures and
American Cultures — and an asterisked gen
der studies requirement. It would also merge
requirements four and five, which include
behavioral and social sciences.
Gender studies was not made into a full
requirement because Duus and his colleagues
did not feel the department had enough staff
or courses for students to fulfill such a
requirement, he said.
Duus said he feels there is a need to study
the remaining 80 percent of the cultures in the
world which are not covered in any depth in
Cultures, Ideas and Values or required in any
of the other distribution requirements.

The other new requirement, American Cul
tures, would cover topics dealing with the
racial and ethnic diversity of America, he said.
Speaking after Duus, Abernethy said he
feels there is a need for a World Cultures
requirement. His proposal simply replaces the
now asterisked non-Western requirement with
the World Cultures requirement. But beyond
this modification, the benefits of the present
system outweigh the possible future benefits
of changing it, he added.
He said he would prefer that students be
encouraged, rather than required, to take
courses in American cultures and gender
issues. Abernethy also suggested
the University increase funding
for these developing areas so that
the variety of courses available to
students is as broad and appeal
ing as possible.
Rakove basically agreed with
Abernethy. He brought up the
question of whether the Ameri
can and World Cultures and gen
der studies areas are important
enough to merit their own
requirements, since many stu
dents already take courses in
these areas.
Siegman made a few comments
before the forum opened up to
questions from the students. He
said the present system is man
ageable for engineering mcgors
but that they have many require
ments to fulfill within their
majors.
He said that adding one more
course to the list wouldn't burden
engineering majors with too
much work, but runs the risk of
putting such constraints on their

time that it would be difficult for
them to participate in outside
activities.
When the forum opened up to
public comment, one student
asked Duus if he thought Stan
ford was being trendy and "jump
ing on the political bandwagon"
by creating distribution require
ments dealing with issues such as
race, ethnicity and gender.
Duus responded by asking how
trendiness was defined. He said
all knowledge changes over time,
and new areas of importance do
come up. If that is trendy, he said,
then this is a trendy issue.
"What could be more universal
than gender?" Duus asked later

in the forum.
One student proposed having a
four-quarter Cultures, Ideas and
Values track as opposed to having
a new distribution requirement in
World Cultures. Abernethy
responded by saying a fourth
quarter of CIV would fall short of
what a World Cultures require
ment could cover.
Another student asked if per
haps Stanford was making a
value judgment by merging
requirements four and five.
Duus said merging them does
not indicate valuing one area
above another because the pro
posed requirement would still
allow students to be exposed to
both fields. Duus said, "We don't
feel it will have a very serious
impact on the courses students
will take."
One student suggested allow
ing the CIV course to fulfill what
would be the World Culture dis
tribution requirement. Duus
responded by saying that CIV
now offers only a few non-West
ern works and does not cover as
much material as a distribution
requirement would.
