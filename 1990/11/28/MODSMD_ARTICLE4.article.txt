# Forum held on proposed DR changes

Two days before the Faculty Senate is
scheduled to vote on proposed changes to the
distribution requirements, about 30 students
attended a meeting last night to express their
concerns on the issue to faculty members.
Four professors present at the meeting held
in Larkin — History Profs. Peter Duus and
Jack Rakove, Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy and Electrical Engineering Prof.
Anthony Siegman — gave their opinions on
the present system of requirements, the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Studies proposal
and the Abernethy proposal.
Duus began by explaining the committee

proposal, which would add two new full distri
bution requirements — World Cultures and
American Cultures — and an asterisked gen
der studies requirement. It would also merge
requirements four and five, which include
behavioral and social sciences.
Gender studies was not made into a full
requirement because Duus and his colleagues
did not feel the department had enough staff
or courses for students to fulfill such a
requirement, he said.
Duus said he feels there is a need to study
the remaining 80 percent of the cultures in the
world which are not covered in any depth in
Cultures, Ideas and Values or required in any
of the other distribution requirements.

The other new requirement, American Cul
tures, would cover topics dealing with the
racial and ethnic diversity of America, he said.
Speaking after Duus, Abernethy said he
feels there is a need for a World Cultures
requirement. His proposal simply replaces the
now asterisked non-Western requirement with
the World Cultures requirement. But beyond
this modification, the benefits of the present
system outweigh the possible future benefits
of changing it, he added.
He said he would prefer that students be
encouraged, rather than required, to take
courses in American cultures and gender
