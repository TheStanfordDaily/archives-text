# Medical researcher starts program to train student 'health associates'
## 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
After 35 years in medical research, Dr.
Tien-Wen Wiedmann from the Stanford
Medical Center is closing her lab to create
a more active student-run public health
program.
The project Wiedmann hopes to get
started will eventually train 150 students
to be "health associates." These under
graduate men and women would live in
dorms and provide health care informa
tion and programming for their fellow
residents.
The project will begin next quarter
with a prototype course for interested
students. The introductory course will

teach students the scientific bases of com
mon health problems. If it goes well,
another course is planned in the spring to
provide further training for those inter
ested in becoming health associates.
Student coordinator Ivana Kim, a
junior, said the associates would be "kind
of like [advising associates] on the health
level." She said the health associates
would do more than "just put out fliers."
The students would be trained in basic
first aid in case of emergencies, but would
primarily serve to create health program
ming and to refer people who need coun
seling and treatment to the appropriate
medical facilities, Kim said.
Wiedmann said the goals of the project
are two-fold. "There is an urgent need for

a comprehensive and scientific education
program which deals with the total health
of the student," she said.
"There is also the problem of science
education in U.S. schools not keeping
pace with technical advances," she added.
"Presenting health-related issues with
emphasis on underlying scientific princi
ples will promote interest and literacy in
these sciences through their application."
The health associates program is part
of a larger project Wiedmann envisions in
which health associates would reach out
to local high-schools to teach similarly
scientifically-based health courses.
The courses would address such topics
as stress, sleep disorders, depression, eat
ing disorders and physical fitness, accord

ing to the course outline. Students can
take the spring course for three, four or
five units. To receive four units, students
must take an optional discussion section.
Those wishing to be health associates
must also take health education training
for a total of five units.
Wiedmann admits the program is in its
infancy and needs support from a variety
of campus academic and public-health
departments. She is currently soliciting
support from the Cowell Student Health
Center, the Human Biology program and
the Stanford Medical School's Center for
Research in Disease Prevention.
John Farquhar, director of Stanford
Medical Center's disease prevention cen
ter, said the center is willing to provide

lecturers for the spring course as well as
health education training for the associ
ates. He said they can also use the cen
ter's health library to obtain up-to-date
information.
Cowell Student Health Center Direc
tor Harvey Weinstein responded more
cautiously, saying that the program
would overlap with Cowell's own public
health projects, including a proposed
Health Advocates Program, designed
along the same lines as the health associ
ates program.
Science will be the emphasis in
the health associates' training, according
to senor Debbie Lindes, a student project
