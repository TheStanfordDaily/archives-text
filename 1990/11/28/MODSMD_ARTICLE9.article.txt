# Greeks address issue of acquaintance rape
## 
### Alexa E. Lee 
About 20 members of Stan
ford's Greek system attended a
workshop last night designed to
encourage fraternity and sorority
members to "take action from
within" to address the issue of
acquaintance rape.
The focus of this "Greek Rap"
session was to open up communi
cation on the subject because
"this is an important issue that
doesn't intuitively come to mind,"
said Isaac Kato, a workshop coor
dinator and Theta Xi member. "It
needs to be sort of taught."
"This issue affects us and we
need to take action from within,"
added Karen Kramer, another

workshop coordinator and a
Kappa Alpha Theta sorority mem
ber. Kramer opened the session by
giving the statistic that "one out
of every three females between
the ages of 18 to 24 has been a vic
tim of acquaintance rape."
The workshop included a role
play demonstrating the difficult
situations that can arise when
heavy drinking accompanies
casual sex.
Participants also discussed
their views on section 261 of Cali
fornia's Penal Code, which defines
rape as "an act of sexual inter
course accomplished with a per
son (who is) not the spouse of the
perpetrator," specifically under
the circumstance "where the per

son is prevented from resisting by
any intoxicating or anesthetic
substance, or any controlled sub
stance, administered by or with
the knowledge of the accused."
Most said they found this defi
nition shocking.
"It definitely makes you think
about the consequences and the
actions that you take, " said Phi
Delta Theta member Todd
Hosein.
The workshop also focused on
an anti-rape slogan used at many
college campuses — "No Means
No" — as both sexes exchanged
their opinions on the mixed sig
nals that may lead to sexual inter
course.
"I think that sexual miscom

munication is one of the causes of
acquaintance rape and if we are
aware of the signals we are giving,
maybe we can stop sending the
harmful ones, and keep guys from
interpreting them in the wrong
way, said Delta Delta Delta mem
ber Marsi Lindersmith.
The discussion ended with the
announcement that Stanford's
Rape Education Project will set up
a wreath in White Plaza today to
promote awareness of how
widespread the rape acquaintance
problem is. One yellow ribbon will
be tied on the wreath for every
reported rape victim on campus.
In addition, students are
encouraged to tie ribbons for
themselves or people they know.
