# Few support DR proposal
## 
### Geoff Goldman Editorial staff 
Only 15 percent of Stanford
undergraduates support a pro
posal by the Committee on Under
graduate Studies to change the
distribution requirements, a Daily
poll has found.
The committee proposal is
under serious consideration by
the Faculty Senate, which is
scheduled to vote on it this after
noon.
More undergraduates sup
ported maintaining the current
requirements than favored either

the committee proposal or an
alternative proposed by Political
Science Prof. David Abernethy.
The majority of graduate students
either have no opinion or don't
know enough about the proposals
to comment.
In addition, the poll also found
that undergraduates are evenly
split on whether there should be a
requirement that would "critically
examine the concept of race,"
which is included in the proposal
by the Committee on Undergrad
uate Studies.
