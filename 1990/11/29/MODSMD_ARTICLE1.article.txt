# Few support DR proposal
## 
### Geoff Goldman Editorial staff 
Only 15 percent of Stanford
undergraduates support a pro
posal by the Committee on Under
graduate Studies to change the
distribution requirements, a Daily
poll has found.
The committee proposal is
under serious consideration by
the Faculty Senate, which is
scheduled to vote on it this after
noon.
More undergraduates sup
ported maintaining the current
requirements than favored either

the committee proposal or an
alternative proposed by Political
Science Prof. David Abernethy.
The majority of graduate students
either have no opinion or don't
know enough about the proposals
to comment.
In addition, the poll also found
that undergraduates are evenly
split on whether there should be a
requirement that would "critically
examine the concept of race,"
which is included in the proposal
by the Committee on Undergrad
uate Studies.

By an almost 2-to-l margin,
however, undergraduates believe
that students should not be
required to take a class in gender
studies. Among all students,
women are evenly split on the
issue, while men are markedly
against having a gender studies
requirement.
The Daily polled 423 students
Tuesday and Wednesday on the
distribution requirements, the
University's new alcohol policy
and the domestic partners policy.
Results for the other questions
will be printed in tomorrow's
Daily.
Every 10th student in the
Stanford Directory was chosen to
participate in the poll. About 52
percent of the respondents were
graduate students, and about 57
percent were male.
The margin of error was 5 per
cent overall and 7 percent among
only the undergraduate popula
tion.
Of the 204 undergraduates
who responded, 30 supported the

Undergraduate Studies proposal,
40 supported Abernethy's pro
posal, 70 supported the current
requirements and 32 favored
"other changes" in the require
ments. Thirty-two said they had
no opinion about the require
ments or didn't know enough
about the proposals.
Of the graduate students
responding, 69 said they had no
opinion and 73 said they didn't
know. Of those that did state an
opinion, 32 favored the committee
proposal, 16 favored the Aber
nethy proposal, 18 supported the
current requirements and 11 sup
ported other changes.
The students were given an
explanation of the two proposals
before the questions were asked.

The committee proposal would
add two new requirements —
"World Cultures" and "American
Cultures"— and would add an
asterisked gender studies require
ment. It would also collapse cur
rent requirements in areas four
and five, which include behavioral
and social sciences, into a single
requirement.
The Abernethy proposal would
change the current asterisked
non-Western culture requirement,
into a full-fledged requirement
but otherwise leaves the current
system intact.
On the gender studies issue, 76
women favored a requirement
while 80 opposed it. Among men,
61 were in favor and 136 were
opposed. Overall, 66 students said
they had no opinion or didn't
know.
On the question of establishing
a requirement examining the con
cept of race, 80 undergraduates
favored the requirement, 80
opposed it and 44 had no opinion
or didn't know. But graduate stu
dents favored such a requirement
by a 2-to-l margin, with 103 say
ing yes, 52 saying no and 60 hav
ing no opinion or not knowing.

On the gender stud
ies issue, 76 women
fsvored a requirement
while 80 opposed it.
Among men, 61 were
in favor and 136 were
opposed.
