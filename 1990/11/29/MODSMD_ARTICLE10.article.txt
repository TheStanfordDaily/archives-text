# From Stanford to the six o'clock news
## Alumna finds local TV anchor job demanding, educational 
### Denise M. Morris Staff writer 
Kate Kelly, KPIX news anchor and
Stanford alumna, discussed her career and the
world of journalism with a group of about 50
people at Branner Hall yesterday afternoon.
One of the first issues Kelly addressed was
upward mobility in journalism. Although she
has opportunity for promotion, she does not
take advantage of it, Kelly said. Several factors
persuade her to stay at KPIX, a local CBS affil
iate, including an interest in local news and a
desire to stay in the Bay Area, where she grew
up, she said.
When asked about the benefits of a career in
journalism, Kelly responded, "It's like going to
school every day." She described it as a learn
ing process, in which one must be flexible.
It is not unlikely for a reporter to spend a
considerable amount of time on one story just
to be suddenly assigned to another one or to
have the story condensed into a 90-second seg
ment, Kelly said.
She said she had originally planned to mtgor

in art history at Stanford before switching to
journalism. Since she had been writing for The
Daily and taking journalism classes for fun,
the switch was not difficult. After taking a
summer course in broadcasting, she decided on
a career in television news.
After graduating in 1979, Kelly moved to a
small station in Redding. She recommended
working in a small market because it provides
the reporter with behind-the-camera work as
well as reporting technique.
After a stay in Austin, Texas, Kelly came
home to work in San Francisco. Although
reporters have traditionally aimed for posi
tions in the big networks, Kelly said "the pol
ish on that golden apple is tarnished."
Although the networks and cable news net
works offer coverage of foreign news, many
reporters now want positions in urban areas,
she said.
She also noted that urban areas are a good
job market for people of color and women.
Reporters should have better success in urban
areas since they are a "hot property," Kelly
said. People of color and women are needed in

these areas because they better represent their
audience.
One student asked Kelly what it is like to be
a woman in the business. Kelly responded that
the journalism business is no different than
any other.
While a woman "doesn't have to be a witch,
she must learn to be firm and aggressive," she
said. And although a woman may experience
subtle sexism, there is "room for women to
take positions of power."

People of color and
women are needed in
urban areas because they
better represent their
audience, Kelly said.
