Stanford Police are investigat
ing an alleged assault in Crothers
Hall last week involving a Stan
ford graduate student and a
woman who was apparently his
girlfriend.
The Santa Clara County Dis
trict Attorney's Office is consider
ing filing charges against both
people.
The woman, a student at the
College of Notre Dame in Bel
mont, reported being assaulted by
the man, a third-year Stanford
law student, at 6:50 p.m. on Sun
day, Nov. 18, according to Stan

ford Police Capt. Marvin Moore.
The man was subsequently
arrested, Moore said.
"It was possibly a boyfriend
girlfriend argument," Moore said.
"It may be a case of two victims
and two suspects. Each person is
both a suspect and a victim."
After talking with both parties,
police submitted a report on the
incident to the District Attorney's
Office. They are requesting the
man be charged with assault and
battery and the woman be
charged with brandishing a
weapon or assault with a deadly
weapon, Moore said.
The two argued in the man's
room in Crothers, and he allegedly

attacked the woman and repeat
edly hit her, Moore said. However,
she allegedly attacked him with a
straight-edge razor, Moore added.
"It may be a mutual combat sit
uation," he said.
The woman was treated at
Stanford Hospital for bruises
around the head and neck after
the incident.
Moore said he did not know
when the District Attorney would
decide whether to file charges.
The Office of Judicial Affairs is
not yet involved in the situation
but probably will begin a confiden
tial judicial process, according to
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole.
"Where there is alleged miscon

duct of a Stanford student, the
Office of Judicial Affairs looks
into the situation," Cole said.
She would not comment fur
ther on the incident.
No one in Crothers reported
the incident. The woman said in
an interview Monday that she
found a police officer near the dor
mitory and reported the incident.
"It is really not uncommon
that people did not call 911
because people are pretty apa
thetic," Moore said. "There have
been quite a few cases where peo
ple heard or saw the crime but did
not report it."
