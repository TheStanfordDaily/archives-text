NEW YORK (AP) — Cuba yesterday
rejected a U.S. appeal that it support a resolu
tion in the United Nations authorizing the use
of force to liberate Kuwait from Iraqi invaders.
"The text that we have before us in not
acceptable," Foreign Minister Isidoro
Malmierca said after a 90-minute evening
meeting with Secretary of State James Baker

Cuban formal session in more than 30 years.

Judge lifts ban on Noriega tapes
MIAMI (AP) — A federal judge yesterday
lifted a ban on broadcasting tapes of Manuel
Noriega's prison telephone calls, defusing a
confrontation between the rights of the media
and those of a criminal defendant.
While CNN hailed the decision as a victory
over censorship, Noriega's defense and consti
tutional specialists said the case showed the
U.S. Supreme Court was willing to accept at
least temporary restrictions on the press.
U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler's deci
sion ended a three-week legal battle between
Noriega and the network, which aired some of
the tapes before the judge ordered CNN to
stop.
CNN President Tom Johnson said the deci
sion would allow the network to pursue its
story on the government's taping of the ousted
Panamanian leader's conversations.
