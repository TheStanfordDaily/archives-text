# China won't back U.N. force against Iraq
## Despite possible veto, diplomats still predict Security Council resolution would pass 
### 
(AP) — China's foreign minister
said yesteray his country will not back
a proposed U.N. Security Council reso
lution authorizing force against Iraq, a
day before foreign ministers prepared
to vote on the measure.
China is one of the five permanent
members of the Security Council and
could veto the measure. At the United
Nations, however, diplomats said they
didn't expect such a move and pre
dicted the resolution would pass.
Roland Dumas, the foreign minister
of France, issued a "final appeal" to
Iraq to pull out of Kuwait, warning
that Baghdad had six weeks to "allow
reason to triumph."
President Bush has gathered sup
port abroad for military action, but he
faces trouble in Congress. A leading
democrat said yesterday he did not
support the use of force against Iraq
any time soon — even U.N.-authorized
force.

There also were appeals for peace in
Baghdad. Iraq's deputy foreign minis
ter urged Bush to open talks on the
Persian Gulf crisis, although he did
not offer concessions regarding
Kuwait.
Secretary of State James Baker 111
has asked that foreign ministers repre
sent their countries in the Security
Council for today's vote.
Before leaving Beijing for the
United Nations yesterday, China's for
eign minister, Qian Qichen, threw the
only shadow over the vote, saying his
country would not back the use-of
force resolution.
"It has always been the position of
China to call for a peaceful settlement
of the gulf crisis and to avoid the use of
force or the act of war," Qian told
reporters.
At the United Nations, diplomats
were divided over whether China
would abstain, or eventually vote in

favor of the resolution after wringing
political concessions out of Washing
ton.
"It seems rather clear that they're
not thinking of vetoing," said British
Ambassador David Hannay.
Qian was to meet with Baker late
yesterday. China wants Washington to
lift economic sanctions imposed fol
lowing the June 1989 military crack
down that crushed China's pro-democ
racy movement.
Also speaking before leaving for
New York, Dumas told the French Par
liament Iraq had given no sign of with
drawing from Kuwait, despite earlier
U.N. resolutions imposing a trade
embargo, among other measures.
"I call on the Iraqi leaders to under
stand that this is really the final appeal
being addressed to them," Dumas said.
"I say with all seriousness: It is up to
Iraq to decide its future."
France has said it will vote in favor

of the U.N. resolution, which Security
Council ambassadors yesterday pre
dicted would pass easily.
"There is political will to adopt
another resolution," said Canadian
Ambassador Yves Fortier.
Oil prices were stable early yester
day on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, with many traders waiting
for the Security Council vote. Oil was
down 36 cents at $32.50 per barrel on
contracts for January delivery.
Under the proposed resolution, Iraq
must withdraw its nearly half-million
troops from occupied Kuwait before
Jan. 15 or face "all necessary means"
to force them from the emirate.
But Iraq yesterday called for talks.
Iraq's deputy prime minister, Taha
Yassin Ramadan, said Bush "is leading
the entire world to a ruinous war" and
"has no choice other than to come to
his senses and initiate a dialogue."
