# Fed confirms recession near
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Federal Reserve Chair
man Alan Greenspan said yesterday that oil-price
problems from the Persian Gulf crisis have pushed
the economy into "a meaningful downturn," con
firming private analysts' recession talk.
Appearing before the House Banking Committee,
he also said the central bank can do little to cushion
the effect of higher oil prices on Americans' standard
of living.
Separately, the Commerce Department reported
that the economy, as measured by the gross national
product, grew at a lackluster 1.7 percent annual rate
in the July-September quarter, even worse than the
previously reported 1.8 percent rate.
Most private analysts believe the economy has
weakened sharply since the quarter ended, an
assessment Greenspan confirmed. But he carefully
avoided describing the deterioration as a recession,
which is defined as a contraction of six months or
more in the GNP
"All indications are that a meaningful downturn
in aggregate output occurred as we moved through
October into November," Greenspan told the com
mittee.
Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., responded, "This
seems to me to be a nice way of saying we've entered
a recession."
Greenspan cautioned, however, that "we won't
know whether it is the beginning of a recession or
just some aberration in economic activity for quite a
while. ... We couldn't conceivably know for certain
until April or May of next year."
He said that another Commerce Department
report yesterday did not fit with the weak data.
Orders to U.S. factories for "big ticket" durable
goods, designed to last three or more years, rose
more strongly than anticipated in October, jumping
3.6 percent, driven by orders for automobiles and
aircraft.
"It is clearly the case . . . that the world out there,
when you look at the hard data, is not in as bad
shape as it feels," he said.
Greenspan conceded, though, that the GNP will
contract in the current quarter if the decline begun
in October persists.
At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said the economy is not in a recession yet, but added,
"I think everyone acknowledges we're in a slow
period."
Greenspan said oil prices, which have risen from
$20 a barrel before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on
Aug. 2 to around $33 now, are cutting the spending
power of businesses and consumers.
