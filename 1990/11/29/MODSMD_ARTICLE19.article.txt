# Former military chiefs urge caution in Middle East

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Two for
mer U.S. military chiefs urged caution
in the Persian Gulf yesterday, even as
President Bush sent Secretary of State
James Baker 111 to press the United
Nations for formal support of a possi
ble attack against Iraq.
"I counsel patience," said retired
Adm. William Crowe, who was chair
man of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under
President Reagan. 4 'War is not neat,
it's not tidy, and once you resort to it,
it*B uncertain and it's a mess."
Retired Air Force Gen. David Jones,
chairman of the joint chiefs under
President Carter, voiced concern with
the latest troop deployment, in which
Bush is sending 200,000 more to bol
ster the 230,000 already in the gulf
and to add an offensive capability.
Jones said his fear "isn't that we

might choose to fight, but rather that
the deployment might cause us to fight
— perhaps prematurely and perhaps
unnecessarily."
The former chiefs' comments were
generally in line with those of lawmak
ers — mainly Democrats — whose
objections have risen in volume as a
shooting war has seemed more likely
in the weeks since Congress adjourned
for the year.
Post-adjournment hearings by a
range of committees are occurring this
week and next, though top Bush offi
cials won't testify until next week,
after the U.N. Security Council action.
Baker went to New York Wednesday
to personally take charge of the U.S.
effort to win formal international sup
port of the idea of a last-resort attack
to free Kuwait from Saddam Hussein's

forces, which invaded on Aug. 2.
Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., the Senate
minority leader, said in a statement
yesterday evening the chances were
"better than 50-50" for a special ses
sion to deal with the Gulf, probably
before Christmas. He didn't say who
would call it, the president or congres
sional leaders.
Dole's statement attracted atten
tion because he put it out after a chat
with the president. But the White
House said no decision had been made
on whether to seek a special session.
"The question is how much pain we
administer and how quickly and
whether we do it with the embargo or
the use of force," said Sen. Sam Nunn,
D-Ga., whose Armed Services Commit
tee began its hearings Tuesday.
Later, Nunn expressed doubts

about the size of the U.S. forces, saying
the number "is much too large to be
able to be sustained politically and per
haps even logistically."
Meanwhile, House Mtgority Leader
Richard Gephardt broke with the
administration and stepped ahead of
other party leaders on the subject of
military confrontation with Saddam,
announcing his opposition to the use
of U.S. military force in the near
future.
And Rep. Lee Hamilton, chairman
of the House Foreign Affairs' Middle
East Subcommittee, said he believes it
is time for Bush to send an envoy to
Baghdad to open talks with Saddam,
with the aim of making U.S. intentions
clear and exploring non-military solu
tions to the crisis.
