# A 						peaceful solution for S. Africa?
## Officials discuss apartheid, what happens after it dies 
### Dan Stearns Staff writer 
Two South African officials discussed
the status and future of their country at
a forum last night sponsored by
SWOPSI at the Center for Educational
Research at Stanford.
Zephania Makgetla, assistant to the
chief representative of the African
National Congress' Washington office,
primarily emphasized the injustices
that blacks have endured in South
Africa since 1961 when the ANC was
banned by the government. He repeat
edly added that the system of apartheid
should not only be changed, but dis
carded immediately.
Tracy Hendriks, a vice consul at the
South African Consulate in Beverly
Hills, detailed what shape she thinks a
new South African constitution might

take in the near future.
"The new constitution will be based
on equal rights and rights which are
protected. The constitution will be
acceptable to every person and every
party. Every person will have a right to
vote," she said.
"Apartheid is an unacceptable prac
tice condemned by the whole world,"
said Makgetla. "There should be no
reform in apartheid. It must be swept
off the table.
"We want all people to be a part of the
election process. We want the people to
not feel left out," he said. "South Africa

belongs to the people of South Africa.
This is a life and death situation, and
many people have died in the last 30
years."
Hendriks said she thinks a new gov
ernment would assume one of three pos
sible shapes: power sharing by political
parties, rule by majority (one vote per
person) or a combination of both in a
"two-tier format."
For Makgetla, the struggle for racial
equality has been personally "painful,"
as he has not seen his parents since his
exile to the United States from South
Africa in 1964.
"We believe at this time, when only
one country on the continent is still
under bondage, that we must take
meaningful steps to make changes,"
said Makgetla.

'Apartheid is an unac
ceptable practice con
demned by the world.'
He cited several examples of "bondage," such as
separate wards in hospitals for blacks and whites.
"The change in South Africa is irreversible, and
the stumbling blocks are being removed," said Hen
driks. "Apartheid should be ended as soon as possi
ble."
Makgetla added that large numbers of blacks in
South Africa have been forced from their homes and
placed in remote lands to make room for whites.
"Eighty-seven percent of the land went to 14 percent
of the people," he said.
Makgetla said that South Africa was second only
to Iran in executions in the 1980s and that his coun
try accounted for 47 percent of the world's execu
tions. A person can be executed in South Africa on
charges of "resisting apartheid," he noted.
In addressing the issue of "black on black" vio
lence and killings within the townships of South
Africa, Makgetla said witnesses have seen white
police encouraging the violence.
While Makgetla's presentation clearly expressed
themes of violence, Hendriks emphasized a peaceful
future for South Africa.
Both Hendriks and Makgetla agreed that eco
nomic sanctions have severely hurt South Africa.
The policy has led to 40 percent unemployment and
a negative growth rate in the economy.
