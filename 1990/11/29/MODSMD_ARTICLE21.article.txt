Acquaintance rape at
Stanford is a constant prob
lem that receives only occa
sional attention.
According to a survey conducted
last spring by Stanford's Rape
Education Project, one third of all
female students at Stanford have
been coerced into sexual inter
course without their consent.
Ninety-four percent of these rapes
are conducted by acquaintances of
the victim.
What's more, almost all of these
cases of sexual abuse go unreport
ed. Because of feelings of guilt,
shame and reluctance to make
charges against an acquaintance,
victims almost never report the
assaults to police or University offi
cials.
The issue rarely receives the
publicity it merits.
This week's "Greek Rap" ses
sion, attended by about 20 fraterni
ty and sorority members, was a
positive step "to take action from

within" to address the issue of
acquaintance rape.
The session was an admirable
step in increasing awareness of the
problem of acquaintance rape
among members of the Greek sys
tem, which has often been cited as
one source of the acquaintance
rape problem.
Similarly, the Rape Education
Project's ribbon wreath in White
Plaza will increase student aware
ness of just how profound the prob
lem of rape is. Students are asked
to tie a yellow ribbon on the wreath
if they or a friend have been the vic
tim of sexual assault.
It is important to bring the
undiscussed issue and silent crime
of acquaintance rape into the open.
The problem of campus rape is
usually discussed only after an inci
dent. This process of ongoing edu
cation reminds us that rape is a
problem we should always have in
mind.
