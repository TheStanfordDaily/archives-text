ON DEC. 4, A Federal District
court in Washington, D.C.,
will hear a suit brought by
45 Democratic congressmen seek
ing to ensure that President Bush
cannot launch an attack on Iraq
without a declaration of war by
Congress.
Stanford law professors Gerald
Gunther and John Hart Ely should
be commended for their role in the
drafting of a brief urging the court
to rule on behalf of the 45 con
gressmen.
The court's decision will be par
ticularly significant in light of indi
cations that the United Nations
Security Council will adopt a reso
lution today allowing the use of
force to oust Iraqi troops from
Kuwait if they are not withdrawn
by Jan. 15.

The benefits of such an affirma
tion notwithstanding, such a reso
lution does not, on its own, give
President Bush carte blanche to
launch an offensive. For that, the
president needs the approval of
Congress, as the brief states.
In addition, there is an another
reason to applaud the stance taken
by Profs. Gunther and Ely. Like the
other nine scholars who wrote and
signed the brief, Gunther and Ely
are experts in the study of constitu
tional law.
Hopefully, other Stanford pro
fessors, so many of whom are
experts in their respective fields,
will follow the example set by
Gunther and Ely and take advan
tage of future opportunities to con
tribute their expertise to important
national debates.
