SLAVERY IS NOT FUNNY. Neither
is the death of a young black soldier
in Vietnam, nor the destruction of
the black family.
But sometimes laughing makes those
things easier to handle. Sometimes laugh
ing is the only way to avoid the pain.
And laugh is exactly what you will do
when you see George Wolfe's play "The
Colored Museum," performed at The
Nitery today through Sunday.
Wolfe's parody of black life and black
people pokes fun at everything from slav
ery to black Wall Street executives, from
black drag queens to Ebony magazine.
Through a series of monologues and
dialogues, Wolfe's unrelenting script cuts
to the core of such issues as the politics of
hair in"The Hairpiece," stardom's price
for black performers in "Lala's Opening,"
and the power of the "snap" in"The
Gospel According to Miss Roj."
The "Last Mama-on-the-Couch Play,"
primarily a spoof on Lorraine Hans
berry's "A Raisin in the Sun," is the play's
supreme farcical moment.
Walter-Lee-Beau-Willie-Jones, "whose
brow is heavy with 300 years of oppres
sion" wants to be somebody. His mother's
advice, however, is to "wipeyo' feet."
Sometimes though it's hard to know
how to respond to the play. As laughter
escapes your lips, a too sweet, bittersweet
sting lingers. Even disguised as the outra
geous, the truth can cause us pain. With
Wolfe's play, laughter doesn't come with
out a price.
Consider Miss Roj, the consummate
drag queen who resides at the "Bottom
less Pit." She/he/it is perhaps the most

outrageous character - the one who gets
the biggest laugh. Struttin' around show
ing off her patio pants declaring "there
are your dingy queens, white men who
like their chicken legs dark," Miss Roj is
bound to make you chuckle.
But just as you laugh at Miss Roj's out
rageous fashion and character, she works
on you like a chisel — exposing you for
who you are when all the while you think
she's telling her own story.
She's not "your regular oppressed
American Negro ... [she is] an extrater
restrial ... [she has] real power." And
though her power makes us laugh, it
makes us uncomfortable as well.
With Miss Roj, Wolfe shows one way in
which blacks have found power even in
their disenfranchised position in society.
Then of course there is the beautiful,
comical couple in "Photo Session," unable
to resplve the contradictions of a colored
existence, who decide to live inside Ebony
magazine for an easier, two-dimensional,
non-meaningful life.
But even their outlandish presentation
teaches the audience a lesson. With
"Photo Session," blacks realize that there
is no escape from the pain. They have to
deal with it, embrace it, live with it. Not
even Ebony magazine can keep them
from feeling.
In "Permutations," little Normal Jean
is a teenage mother — not to a baby but
an egg.
So Normal Jean in "Permutations"
may make you laugh when she describes
making love with the garbage man who
smelled like a "juicy, juicy grape," but
what's behind her humor?

If you go beyond the laughter, you will
certainly find pain.
The play's run this weekend is a rare
treat you shouldn't miss because unlike
many other plays, the play is meant to be
seen and experienced, not just read. Wolfe
himself said, "In many respects, the cen
tral character of the play is the audience."
That means that each one of you will
have to respond. And not just to Miss Roj,
but you'll have to respond to all of the
characters who look to you for answers,
for validation, for help.
But a black audience isn't necessarily
the best audience. Wolfe said, "The best
houses are half-black and half-white."
Whatever your identification is, how
ever, the play will move you to think ...
but mostly to feel.
"At each performance, some people
come out laughing, others crying. The
other night someone said to me, 'This is
too painful to go through, but I believe
that wounds heal better in open air.'
There's a dangerous tension that has to
resolve into laughter," Wolfe said.
You need this play. The play you needs
you. We hope to see you there.
