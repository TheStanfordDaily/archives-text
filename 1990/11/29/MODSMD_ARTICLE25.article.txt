Faculty Senate needs to update DRs for modem world

ACHIEVING A BETTER under
standing of ourselves and others
should be a central purpose of
undergraduate education. As demo
graphics and social values change, the
requirements for sound 21st century
leadership must include sensitivity to
issues of race and gender. Irrespective of
career path or major, we all will affect or
relate with human beings in our work and
everyday lives.
Why single out race and gender for
increased attention? Because these
issues, like no others, are fundamental to
human understanding and to the creation
of a more just and humane society. For
many students like ourselves, our under
graduate years at Stanford comprise the
last experience that can openly call these
issues into our consciousness.
Through a recent ASSU poll of the stu

dent body, we discovered that more stu
dents supported a change in the require
ments than those who did not. Of the
approximately 3,000 respondents, 42 per
cent indicated that the proposal repre
sents the "correct change" or "not
enough change," whereas 35 percent indi
cated that adoption of the proposal would
be "too much change." (Nearly 20 per
cent of the respondents said they were
not informed enough to comment on the
proposed changes.) Moreover, many felt
that an asterisked gender studies require
ment does not do enough to address gen
der issues in the curriculum.
Some students who opposed the pro
posal argued that ethnic and gender stud
ies should not be mandated. Others
argued that requirements dealing with
non-Western, ethnic and gender issues
are important, but that additional

requirements would be a burden.
Indeed, proposing to change the distri
bution requirements raises legitimate
concerns. But let's be clear: The proposal
is asking this University to affirm its val
ues.
If the institution values critical exami
nation of race and gender, if Stanford's
mission is to prepare new leaders for a
diverse and rapidly changing society, and
if the University aims to create a warmer,
more compassionate campus, then mem
bers of the University — including the
Faculty Senate — should view the pro
posed changes as an avenue to express
these commitments.
Ideally, Stanford would be a free intel
lectual marketplace for students to
choose a well-rounded education on their
own. But through the distribution
requirements, Stanford has chosen to

issue a statement about what basic
knowledge or modes of thinking the Uni
versity considers important. What is
included says as much as what is not.
University President Donald Kennedy
said it best when he wrote last spring:
"We build intellectual fortresses on quick
sand, then watch them fall and build oth
ers. That's our line of business."
We hope the senate makes our distri
bution requirements more relevant to the
challenges we face at Stanford and in our
ever-changing world. The proposal
reflects values that we and other mem
bers of the Stanford community hold very
dear.
