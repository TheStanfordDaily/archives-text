# We should condemn Israel's aggression in addition to Iraq's
## 
### 
In an attempt to discredit the paral
lelism between the Iraqi occupation of
Kuwait and the Israeli occupation of the
West Bank and Gaza, two students
argued that "Israel came into possession
of the West Bank and Gaza as a result of
defending herself successfully against an
aggressive war launched against her by
Egypt, Syria, Lebanon and Iraq," (letter
to The Daily, Nov. 15).
We are led to believe from the argu
ment that the Israeli occupation is defen
sive and the Iraqi aggressive. While we
agree with these students that the
events surrounding these occupations
are "quite different," their attempt to
justify Israel's occupation by perverting
historical facts is unacceptable.
Firstly, neither Lebanon nor Iraq was

involved in the 1967 war. The real partic
ipants were Jordan, Egypt and Syria.
Secondly, the war was launched with a
"preventive" first strike by Israel against
Egypt. Jordan and Syria entered the war,
but the Arab states were crushed in six
days.
Well before the initiation of war, mili
tary intelligence in Tel Aviv reported
that a first strike would result in a swift
victory for Israel. On the eve of the war,
President Nasser of the United Arab
Republic (Egypt and Syria as united in
1958) stated that if the Israelis do not
attack, "we will leave them alone."
The distortion of facts in the media is
a dangerous tool; it has been used to pro
mulgate myths about Israel's occupation
of the West Bank and Gaza for 23 years.
Such misleading rhetoric as appeared in
the Nov. 15 letter attempts to justify
Israel's occupation of Palestinian territo
ries, which Israel consistently refuses to
either annex or liberate, but continues
instead to administer with an oppressive
military regime.

By refusing to adhere to U.N. Resolu
tions 242 and 338, which call for Israel's
withdrawal to pre-1967 boundaries, and
by encouraging nearly 100,000 Jewish
citizens to settle in the occupied territo
ries, Israel has explicitly violated inter
national law since 1967.
The Oct. 8 incident at Jerusalem's
Temple Mount, when Israeli ground
troops and police fired live ammunition
into crowds of Palestinian civilians,
attacked Makassad hospital with rubber
and marble bullets, and shot tear gas
into the maternity ward, is but one
example of the aggressive policies of the
Israeli government toward the Pales
tinian people.

We do not agree that a strict parallel
can be drawn between the Iraqi and the
Israeli occupations. However, we
strongly oppose the attempt to miscon
strue the nature of the Israeli occupa
tion, which we believe is no less aggres
sive or brutal than Iraq's recent inva
sion. If Iraq should be condemned for its
naked aggression and violation of inter
national law, which we believe it should
be, then the aggressive nature of the
Israeli occupation cannot be denied.
