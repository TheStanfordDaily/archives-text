## Doug Felt 'Rules' people make far more efficient RAs than 'human' people 
### 
THE TIME: early December 1992.
The place: a small room hidden
away in an obscure corner of the
Wilbur basement.
"Look, Claire, I only want to help you."
Claire's resident assistant David Robb
paced slowly across the cement floor. "But
you know how Bucky gets. And rules are
rules."
He turned, looked sympathetically at
her and shrugged. "My hands are tied."
"But, it was just a beer," Claire sighed.
She'd lost count of the hours, and the
cords on her wrists and legs were begin
ning to chafe. "Just a few sips."
Her head sagged, grazing the bare bulb
hanging on its frayed cord. It swung
slowly, inches away, so bright she couldn't
see David or anyone else who might be in
the tiny room.
David stepped back into the light, sat
in the chair across from her. "Perhaps,
Claire, if you could just tell me who gave
you that beer,"he suggested. "I'm a
human RA; I understand. Sometimes we
make mistakes. Sometimes we forget the
rules." He paused. "But Bucky. . ." His
voice trailed off.
"I told you," Claire sighed, her voice
barely a whisper. "No one gave me the
beer."
David shook his head slowly. "Claire,
Claire. Bucky doesn't want to hear that.

He doesn't pay lip service to rules. He
enforces them. It isn't 1990 anymore, you
know."
He waited, but Claire just sat motion
less, mute, her eyes downcast. The min
utes ticked by.
David stood and stepped back into the
darkness, toward the door. The handle
creaked as he slowly turned it. "We're just
doing what's best for you, Claire. Tough
love works wonders. Someday you'll
thank us for it."
He opened the door, and a glimmer of
light slipped through the narrow crack.
"Don't make a bad situation worse,
Claire."
"I just wanted to see for myself,"
Claire blurted out. "For myself, that's
all." A brief flash of defiance lit her eyes
and dimmed again. "That's all. .
"Against the rules, Claire." The door
clicked shut. Claire listened to his foot
steps slowly fade away.
Minutes passed. Was it still daylight
outside? Claire wondered. She tried to
look about the room, but she couldn't tell
if it was really empty or not. She kept
quiet. A spider scuttled along the wall,
trying to keep out of the light. The bulb
hung motionless, for what seemed like an
eternity, until, suddenly, the door was
thrown open.
Claire's other RA, Ronald Bucknam —

he always used his last name — strode
into the room, threw his leg over the chair
and sat down. He thrust his granite face
into the light and looked hard at Claire.
"Individual responsibility does not
leave open the option of breaking the
law." His voice was cold and even. "People
who break the law should face the
music."
Claire said nothing.
Bucknam lifted the bulb a bit closer to
Claire's face. Sweat broke across her
brow. "Higher education has been ignor
ing its role in the drug war," he said, in
the same even tone. "Too many universi
ties have remained diffident when it
comes to drugs. Right, Claire?"
Claire still said nothing.
"Right?" His voice rose a bit.

"Right," Claire whispered.
"But now universities have established
clear and specific rules regarding drug
use — rules that include strong corrective
actions." Bucknam leaned back. "And you
know the rules, don't you Claire?"
"We recite them in class every day," she
whispered.
"We don't buy the idea that purely edu
cating someone can inoculate them
against drug use." He laughed. "Didn't
work for you, did it, Claire?"
Again she was mute.
"Did it, Claire?" he shouted. No laugh
ter now.
"I just wanted. .
"Wanted what?" Bucknam cut her off.
"To become an addict? Get hooked on
dope? First alcohol, then maryuana, then

crack, then you're hustling on the street
to support a habit."
His voice lowered. "Tell me who gave
you the beer, and we'll go easy on you. You
might even be able to stay in college." It
was a lie, but an effective one.
Claire sweated under the hot light.
The pain in her arms and legs was almost
unbearable. Bucknam spoke. "Too many
colleges recruit more 'human' people
than 'rules' people. People who don't like
the role of enforcer, Claire." He leaned
forward, grinned. "But me ... I like it."
The door opened and David stepped in.
"We have to protect you from yourself,
Claire. Tell Bucky what he wants to
know." Claire looked at her two RAs.
"Remember the rules, Claire," Bucknam
added.
The room swam about her. The heat,
the dark, the gnawing pain grew, minute
by minute, until she could bear it no
longer. Her voice was barely audible when
she finally spoke. "I got the beer from my
resident fellows."
"Go, get 'em, David." Bucknam kicked
back in his chair, a smile playing across
his lips. "We're going to turn the screws
up a couple of notches on higher educa
tion."

eternity, until, suddenly, the door was
thrown open.
Claire's other RA, Ronald Bucknam —

he always used his last name — strode
into the room, threw his leg over the chair
and sat down. He thrust his granite face
into the light and looked hard at Claire.
"Individual responsibility does not
leave open the option of breaking the
law." His voice was cold and even. "People
who break the law should face the
music."
Claire said nothing.
Bucknam lifted the bulb a bit closer to
Claire's face. Sweat broke across her
brow. "Higher education has been ignor
ing its role in the drug war," he said, in
the same even tone. "Too many universi
ties have remained diffident when it
comes to drugs. Right, Claire?"
Claire still said nothing.
"Right?" His voice rose a bit.

"Right," Claire whispered.
"But now universities have established
clear and specific rules regarding drug
use — rules that include strong corrective
actions." Bucknam leaned back. "And you
know the rules, don't you Claire?"
"We recite them in class every day," she
whispered.
"We don't buy the idea that purely edu
cating someone can inoculate them
against drug use." He laughed. "Didn't
work for you, did it, Claire?"
Again she was mute.
"Did it, Claire?" he shouted. No laugh
ter now.
"I just wanted. .
"Wanted what?" Bucknam cut her off.
"To become an addict? Get hooked on
dope? First alcohol, then maryuana, then

crack, then you're hustling on the street
to support a habit."
His voice lowered. "Tell me who gave
you the beer, and we'll go easy on you. You
might even be able to stay in college." It
was a lie, but an effective one.
Claire sweated under the hot light.
The pain in her arms and legs was almost
unbearable. Bucknam spoke. "Too many
colleges recruit more 'human' people
than 'rules' people. People who don't like
the role of enforcer, Claire." He leaned
forward, grinned. "But me ... I like it."
The door opened and David stepped in.
"We have to protect you from yourself,
Claire. Tell Bucky what he wants to
know." Claire looked at her two RAs.
"Remember the rules, Claire," Bucknam
added.
The room swam about her. The heat,
the dark, the gnawing pain grew, minute
by minute, until she could bear it no
longer. Her voice was barely audible when
she finally spoke. "I got the beer from my
resident fellows."
"Go, get 'em, David." Bucknam kicked
back in his chair, a smile playing across
his lips. "We're going to turn the screws
up a couple of notches on higher educa
tion."

David stepped back into the light, sat in the chair
across from her. 'Perhaps, Claire, if you could just tell
me who gave you that beer,' he suggested. 'I'm a
human RA, I understand. Sometimes we make mis
takes. Sometimes we forget the rules.' He paused. 'But
Bucky...' His voice trailed off.
THE TIME: early December 1992.
The place: a small room hidden
away in an obscure corner of the
Wilbur basement.
"Look, Claire, I only want to help you."
Claire's resident assistant David Robb
paced slowly across the cement floor. "But
you know how Bucky gets. And rules are
rules."
He turned, looked sympathetically at
her and shrugged. "My hands are tied."
"But, it was just a beer," Claire sighed.
She'd lost count of the hours, and the
cords on her wrists and legs were begin
ning to chafe. "Just a few sips."
Her head sagged, grazing the bare bulb
hanging on its frayed cord. It swung
slowly, inches away, so bright she couldn't
see David or anyone else who might be in
the tiny room.
David stepped back into the light, sat
in the chair across from her. "Perhaps,
Claire, if you could just tell me who gave
you that beer,"he suggested. "I'm a
human RA; I understand. Sometimes we
make mistakes. Sometimes we forget the
rules." He paused. "But Bucky. . ." His
voice trailed off.
"I told you," Claire sighed, her voice
barely a whisper. "No one gave me the
beer."
David shook his head slowly. "Claire,
Claire. Bucky doesn't want to hear that.

He doesn't pay lip service to rules. He
enforces them. It isn't 1990 anymore, you
know."
He waited, but Claire just sat motion
less, mute, her eyes downcast. The min
utes ticked by.
David stood and stepped back into the
darkness, toward the door. The handle
creaked as he slowly turned it. "We're just
doing what's best for you, Claire. Tough
love works wonders. Someday you'll
thank us for it."
He opened the door, and a glimmer of
light slipped through the narrow crack.
"Don't make a bad situation worse,
Claire."
"I just wanted to see for myself,"
Claire blurted out. "For myself, that's
all." A brief flash of defiance lit her eyes
and dimmed again. "That's all. .
"Against the rules, Claire." The door
clicked shut. Claire listened to his foot
steps slowly fade away.
Minutes passed. Was it still daylight
outside? Claire wondered. She tried to
look about the room, but she couldn't tell
if it was really empty or not. She kept
quiet. A spider scuttled along the wall,
trying to keep out of the light. The bulb
hung motionless, for what seemed like an
eternity, until, suddenly, the door was
thrown open.
Claire's other RA, Ronald Bucknam —

he always used his last name — strode
