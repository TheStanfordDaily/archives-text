# B-school paper offers business, writing practice

The student financial newspaper Doug Reed
started as an undergraduate couldn't stay out of the
red. Now red is the bold color of the masthead of the
thriving paper he co-edits as a business student.
Princeton University's The Capitalist could not
pay its bills. But the demise of the publication did
not signal the end of the editorial career of Reed,
now a second-year student at Stanford's Graduate
School of Business. He and second-year business
student Rob Williamson co-edit The Reporter, the
business school's 23-year-old newspaper. And stay
ing out of the red is no longer a problem.
Twenty-two hundred copies are distributed
biweekly within the Business School community.
Richly funded by advertisements from recruiters
anxious to catch the eye of business students, the
paper averages from 12 to 20 pages and is peppered
with sections devoted to school news, features,
columns, entertainment, intramural sports and
humor.
"Real GSB News" is detailed on the back page,
with "GSB" signifying "Gossip, Sex and Banter"
aplenty. The ASSU Type and Design Shop handles
the paper's typesetting.
Williamson characterized the paper as a "mirror"
of the Business School community, with no particu
lar "issues agenda," unlike some other schools'
papers which he branded "more serious and full of
corporate propaganda."
By comparison, this year's premiere issue of Har
vard Business School's The Harbus News featured
front page stories on The Boeing Company and the
reworking of academic schedules to diminish stu
dent tension. The Reporter debuted with a human
interest profile of the first-year class and a story
praising students' non-profit summer jobs.
Staffers all full-time business students
embrace the forum to express their creativity, artic
ulate their opinions and divert themselves from aca
demic pressures.
"When people enter the [Business School] they
hear from classmates who include ex-bankers, polit
ical lobbyists, magicians, physicians and
entrepreneurs with diverse cultural and ethnic his
tories," said features editor Jill Nguyen. "The
Reporter showcases this rich mix of experiential and
educational backgrounds. It's a great source of
learning."
For some, there's a manage
ment lesson to be learned as well.
"Everyone in Business School
worked in business, but few have
really had to manage," said Reed.
"Now, when we talk in class about
personnel issues, I can think in
terms of how I manage people on
the paper."
And the marketing classes
they've been taking are applicable
as well. The staff devised a
provocative way to advertise for
submissions, which it welcomes
for every section of the paper.
Inside the November issue,
distributed in each student mail
box, was a Macintosh disk labeled
"Official Article Submission
Disk," with a flyer soliciting con
tributions. An adhesive sticker
was attached, replicating the
front page of an issue, including
the eye-catching red masthead.
The response has been very
positive. "Even if they use the
disk for something else, at least
it's good advertising for The
Reporter," Reed said.

In the paper's long history,
there have also been lessons in
the contentious side of corporate
life. Two years ago, students took
issue with the financial compen
sation of Reporter staffers. "It
used to be lucrative for students
to work for the paper," Reed said.
"Other student organizations
made money, but they donated
any excess profit to charity. There
was a student uprising, forcing
the previous editors to do the
same."
How do busy Business School
students find time to manage a
paper and wax creative? They are
not unwilling conscripts. "People
love writing . . . especially if
they've had a strange experi
ence," said Nguyen, a second-year
business student.
Scott McDonald, a second-year
business student, holds the
newly-created position of manag
ing editor. He maps the layout, a
task formerly divided among the
editors of the six sections, bring
ing consistency to the format and
conveying a more polished look.
McDonald praises the
endeavor as a "management
training experience" in motivat
ing people.
