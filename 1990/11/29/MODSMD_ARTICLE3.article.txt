# B-school paper offers business, writing practice

The student financial newspaper Doug Reed
started as an undergraduate couldn't stay out of the
red. Now red is the bold color of the masthead of the
thriving paper he co-edits as a business student.
Princeton University's The Capitalist could not
pay its bills. But the demise of the publication did
not signal the end of the editorial career of Reed,
now a second-year student at Stanford's Graduate
School of Business. He and second-year business
student Rob Williamson co-edit The Reporter, the
business school's 23-year-old newspaper. And stay
ing out of the red is no longer a problem.
Twenty-two hundred copies are distributed
biweekly within the Business School community.
Richly funded by advertisements from recruiters
anxious to catch the eye of business students, the
paper averages from 12 to 20 pages and is peppered
with sections devoted to school news, features,
columns, entertainment, intramural sports and
humor.
"Real GSB News" is detailed on the back page,
with "GSB" signifying "Gossip, Sex and Banter"
aplenty. The ASSU Type and Design Shop handles
the paper's typesetting.
Williamson characterized the paper as a "mirror"
of the Business School community, with no particu
lar "issues agenda," unlike some other schools'
papers which he branded "more serious and full of
corporate propaganda."
By comparison, this year's premiere issue of Har
vard Business School's The Harbus News featured
front page stories on The Boeing Company and the
reworking of academic schedules to diminish stu
dent tension. The Reporter debuted with a human
interest profile of the first-year class and a story
praising students' non-profit summer jobs.
Staffers all full-time business students
embrace the forum to express their creativity, artic
ulate their opinions and divert themselves from aca
demic pressures.
"When people enter the [Business School] they
hear from classmates who include ex-bankers, polit
ical lobbyists, magicians, physicians and
entrepreneurs with diverse cultural and ethnic his
tories," said features editor Jill Nguyen. "The
Reporter showcases this rich mix of experiential and
educational backgrounds. It's a great source of
learning."
