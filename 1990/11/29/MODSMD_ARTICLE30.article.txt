## Feldman set to lead Cardinal into NCAA tournament 
### Harold Yu Staff writer 
In her senior year of high school,
Stanford sophomore Carrie Feldman
was the top-ranked setter in the nation.
In her senior year of high school,
Stanford freshman Piper Hahn was also
the top-ranked setter in the nation.
It doesn't take a Ph.D. mathemati
cian to figure out that in this case two
plus two equalled trouble.
Feldman was fresh off a trial-by-flre
initiation to the Stanford volleyball pro
gram. In her freshman season, she was
ushered into immediate duty when
senior leader Lara Asper sustained a
career-ending injury.
Hahn was fresh off a banner year.
The prize pup of the 1990 recruiting
class earned national High School
Player-of-the-Year honors while leading
her Mira Costa team to the state title.
When Stanford coach Don Shaw got
to see his two precious ball-handlers in
the preseason, he knew he could expect
a battle.
It's probably fair to say that this bat
tle has been won.
Tonight, when the NCAA tourna
ment show begins, Feldman will step
forth as the ringleader of the streaking
No. 3 Cardinal. But she'll be the first to
admit that while the road to this posi
tion has been difficult, it has been —
first of all — supremely educational.
"Piper pushed me a lot harder this
year," Feldman said. "Sometimes when I
got pulled, I wondered why But watch
ing from the bench, I could see what
wasn't working. I think we've both
become pretty good setters because of
this."
Most observers thought Feldman
already was one. In her first season, the
Davis, Calif, product recorded 1,041
assists, the most ever by a freshman at
Stanford. Currently, she has 2,053
assists in her young career. That total
places Feldman second all-time at Stan
ford in less than two full seasons.
Feldman has been named to the
Pacific 10-Conference all-freshman
team and to the all-tournament team at
this season's Stanford Invitational. She
is fast gaining national prominence
despite playing volleyball's least glam
orous position.
"We're real happy with Carrie," Shaw
said. "She's done real well. You've got to
consider what the team's done this year
in terms of wins and hitting percentage.
Carrie has got a lot to do with that."
Feldman's journey started humbly
enough five years ago at Davis High.
She had anything but a storybook begin
ning, showing little interest in a sport

she started late and at whim. "I was the
alternate on my freshman team and I
didn't really like it," Feldman said.
This fledgling interest developed into
an overwhelming passion and the 5-
foot-10 sophomore began to distinguish
herself nationally As a senior in high
school, Volleyball Monthly tabbed her as
the top high school setting recruit in the
nation before she opted for the Farm.
Shaw's plan was simple. Play Asper.
Let Feldman watch and digest. Great
setters aren't recruited. They're nur
tured and developed.
This Utopian plan didn't make it
through the first home match. The
senior mentor was lost to injury and the
freshman pupil was thrust into the
lineup.
"It was really hard on Carrie," junior
All-Pac-10 middle blocker Amy Cooper
said. "Losing Lara was such a shock to
the entire team that everyone just
expected a great setter replacement.
[The situation] was really, really hard on
her."
Feldman coped. Despite having no
experience in the faster college game,
she emerged as a constant in Shaw's
offensive formula. "People saw Asper as
the huge focus of the team," junior Ail-
American Kristin Klein said. "It was
real easy last year to point the finger at
Carrie, but I think she did a great job.
She learned real fast. I know she had a
hard time but I think her hard work is
paying off."
This fact is imediately evident. Feld
man recorded team-leading averages of
11.5 assists and .4 aces per game this
year. She has collected 182 digs, 35
blocks and 48 dump kills.

"Carrie has got a good mind for the
game," Shaw said. "She really has the
ability to implement any game plan we
want her to. If she continues to work
hard, she'll be a real fine setter."
Feldman just sort of takes comments
like this in stride. If there is one thing
that really stands out about her, it is
that she doesn't. Feldman is cool, calm,
pacific. She is a monument of mellow
ness in a game of frenetics.
'The good thing about Carrie is that
she's got an even personality," Shaw
said. "She's real steady and she keeps
her head."
A Feldman translation: "I'm pretty
kick-back. Away from volleyball, I just
sort of hang out."
It may be easy to confuse this kind of
passivity with apathy. Nothing could be
father from the truth. Feldman may not
be the most vocal player, but she cer
tainly ranks among the most active and
alert.
"She's not real moody," Cooper said.
"But she takes control. Her mind is
always working and she's always on top
of the game."
Her deceptively strong attitude is
matched by her strongly deceptive tech
nique. Feldman is an artist with the vol
leyball. She cloaks her true intentions
with her fine, picturesque style. The
uneducated defensive eye has great dif
ficulty deciphering her work.
"She's really hard to read," Cooper
said. "She's very deceptive to the block
ers.
Feldman is very clear, however,
about her remaining ambitions. Staking
Stanford to its first ever national cham
pionship remains foremost in the cate
gory. "Kristin and Coop are probably
sick of these weird finishes two years in
a row," Feldman said. "I think the team
is ready."
Card notes
Tonight's winner will face the winner of
the Brigham Young-San Diego State match.
The other two teams that will be in the
Western Regional next weekend are the win
era of the UCLA-Gonzaga and New Mexico-
Pepperdine matches.
First-round matchups in the South
Region are Texas Tech. at Texas-Arlington,
Louisville at LSU, Florida State at Kentucky
and Maryland at Texas.
In the Northwest it will be Southwest
Missouri State at Hawaii, San Jose State at
Long Beach State, Idaho State at UC-Santa
Barbara and Montana at the University of
the Pacific.
In the Mideast: Purdue at Penn State,
Illinois at Wisconsin, Pittsburgh at Ohio
State and Miami, Ohio at Nebraska.

This fact is imediately evident. Feld
man recorded team-leading averages of
11.5 assists and .4 aces per game this
year. She has collected 182 digs, 35
blocks and 48 dump kills.

"Carrie has got a good mind for the
game," Shaw said. "She really has the
ability to implement any game plan we
want her to. If she continues to work
hard, she'll be a real fine setter."
Feldman just sort of takes comments
like this in stride. If there is one thing
that really stands out about her, it is
that she doesn't. Feldman is cool, calm,
pacific. She is a monument of mellow
ness in a game of frenetics.
'The good thing about Carrie is that
she's got an even personality," Shaw
said. "She's real steady and she keeps
her head."
A Feldman translation: "I'm pretty
kick-back. Away from volleyball, I just
sort of hang out."
It may be easy to confuse this kind of
passivity with apathy. Nothing could be
father from the truth. Feldman may not
be the most vocal player, but she cer
tainly ranks among the most active and
alert.
"She's not real moody," Cooper said.
"But she takes control. Her mind is
always working and she's always on top
of the game."
Her deceptively strong attitude is
matched by her strongly deceptive tech
nique. Feldman is an artist with the vol
leyball. She cloaks her true intentions
with her fine, picturesque style. The
uneducated defensive eye has great dif
ficulty deciphering her work.
"She's really hard to read," Cooper
said. "She's very deceptive to the block
ers.
Feldman is very clear, however,
about her remaining ambitions. Staking
Stanford to its first ever national cham
pionship remains foremost in the cate
gory. "Kristin and Coop are probably
sick of these weird finishes two years in
a row," Feldman said. "I think the team
is ready."

Ever since her sophomore year in high school, Carrie Feldman has led a volleyball-filled
life. Her dedication has paid off as she has been a quiet leader for the Cardinal squad,
taking them to a No. 3 national ranking. The team opens NCAA tournament play tonight
against Wyoming in Burnham Pavilion.
In her senior year of high school,
Stanford sophomore Carrie Feldman
was the top-ranked setter in the nation.
In her senior year of high school,
Stanford freshman Piper Hahn was also
the top-ranked setter in the nation.
It doesn't take a Ph.D. mathemati
cian to figure out that in this case two
plus two equalled trouble.
Feldman was fresh off a trial-by-flre
initiation to the Stanford volleyball pro
gram. In her freshman season, she was
ushered into immediate duty when
senior leader Lara Asper sustained a
career-ending injury.
Hahn was fresh off a banner year.
The prize pup of the 1990 recruiting
class earned national High School
Player-of-the-Year honors while leading
her Mira Costa team to the state title.
When Stanford coach Don Shaw got
to see his two precious ball-handlers in
the preseason, he knew he could expect
a battle.
It's probably fair to say that this bat
tle has been won.
Tonight, when the NCAA tourna
ment show begins, Feldman will step
forth as the ringleader of the streaking
No. 3 Cardinal. But she'll be the first to
admit that while the road to this posi
tion has been difficult, it has been —
first of all — supremely educational.
"Piper pushed me a lot harder this
year," Feldman said. "Sometimes when I
got pulled, I wondered why But watch
ing from the bench, I could see what
wasn't working. I think we've both
become pretty good setters because of
this."
Most observers thought Feldman
already was one. In her first season, the
Davis, Calif, product recorded 1,041
assists, the most ever by a freshman at
Stanford. Currently, she has 2,053
assists in her young career. That total
places Feldman second all-time at Stan
ford in less than two full seasons.
Feldman has been named to the
Pacific 10-Conference all-freshman
team and to the all-tournament team at
this season's Stanford Invitational. She
is fast gaining national prominence
despite playing volleyball's least glam
orous position.
"We're real happy with Carrie," Shaw
said. "She's done real well. You've got to
consider what the team's done this year
in terms of wins and hitting percentage.
Carrie has got a lot to do with that."
Feldman's journey started humbly
enough five years ago at Davis High.
She had anything but a storybook begin
ning, showing little interest in a sport

she started late and at whim. "I was the
alternate on my freshman team and I
didn't really like it," Feldman said.
This fledgling interest developed into
an overwhelming passion and the 5-
foot-10 sophomore began to distinguish
herself nationally As a senior in high
school, Volleyball Monthly tabbed her as
the top high school setting recruit in the
nation before she opted for the Farm.
Shaw's plan was simple. Play Asper.
Let Feldman watch and digest. Great
setters aren't recruited. They're nur
tured and developed.
This Utopian plan didn't make it
through the first home match. The
senior mentor was lost to injury and the
freshman pupil was thrust into the
lineup.
"It was really hard on Carrie," junior
All-Pac-10 middle blocker Amy Cooper
said. "Losing Lara was such a shock to
the entire team that everyone just
expected a great setter replacement.
[The situation] was really, really hard on
her."
Feldman coped. Despite having no
experience in the faster college game,
she emerged as a constant in Shaw's
offensive formula. "People saw Asper as
the huge focus of the team," junior Ail-
American Kristin Klein said. "It was
real easy last year to point the finger at
Carrie, but I think she did a great job.
She learned real fast. I know she had a
hard time but I think her hard work is
paying off."
This fact is imediately evident. Feld
man recorded team-leading averages of
11.5 assists and .4 aces per game this
year. She has collected 182 digs, 35
