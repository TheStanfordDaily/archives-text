# NFL Commissioner unable to find fines that are fine
## 
### 
Paul Tagliabue should take a bow. As
the National Football League's
commissioner, he has made the
NFL not only the source of great Sunday
afternoon entertainment but also the
moral leader of professional sports
leagues.
After the voters in Arizona rejected a
proposed holiday to honor Martin Luther
King Jr., Tagliabue threatened to move
the 1993 Super Bowl out of Phoenix in
Erotest. The message, Tagliabue would
ave us believe, is that the NFL is not
morally neutral and in fact can be a vehi
cle for social change and justice.
Yeah, right.
Yesterday's sports headlines will tell
you just how far the NFL will go to
uphold its moral precepts. On Tuesday,
Tagliabue issued his sentences for the
perpetrators of the league's other ugly
incident this season: the Lisa Olson inci
dent.
Olson was the Boston Herald reporter
who was alledgedly sexually harrassed by
several New England Patriot players in
the Pats' locker room after a game Sept.
17. After the incident and the media out
cry, Tagliabue formed a commission
headed by Harvard Law Professor and
former Watergate prosecutor Philip Hey
mann to investigate the incident and
uncover the truth.

After interviewing 91 witnesses, Iley
mann compiled a 60-page report for
Tagliabue which detailed the events of
Sept. 17. Among the disgraces outlined in
Heymann's report:
• An unknown player stood naked next
to Olson as she was interviewing a Patriot
player, saying to her "Here's what you
want. Do you want to take a bite out of
this?"
• Tight end Zeke Mowatt "purposely
displayed himself to her in a suggestive
way. Laughter erupted and shouts from
other players continued, especially 'Is she
looking? Is she looking at it?'"
• Heymann concluded that "Mowatt's
account of the same period is not credi
ble." That is to say, he lied.
• The Patriots' management was
equally responsible since "No one tried to
bring the humiliating activity around

Lisa Olson to a stop. Neither players nor
management personnel said or did any
thing."
In my mind, all of this qualifies as
being morally repugnant. This inci
dent, more than any in the NFL that I
can remember, deserved a swift response
from Tagliabue with strong punishments
imposed on the perpetrators. It was the
commissioner's golden opportunity to
assert once again that the NFL is not a
morally neutral institution.
So Tagliabue fined Mowatt $12,500
and fellow players Robert Perryman and
Michael Timpson $5,000 each. The
Patriot organization was fined $50,000
for its inaction following the incident and
for some repulsive public statements
from team owner Victor Kiam. No one
was suspended.
That's not exactly the unequivocal
condemnation that I had hoped for.
In fact, it is so incredibly dispropor
tionate to the seriousness of the incident
that it makes the commissioner look
rather hypocritical after taking the Super
Bowl away from Phoenix, which after all
as a city did vote in favor of the King hol
iday even though it lost on the state bal
lot. The fact that Tagliabue fined Cincin
nati coach Sam Wyche $30,000 this sea
son for keeping a woman reporter out of

the locker room makes the fines of
Mowatt, Timpson, Perryman and the
Patriot organization even more ludicrous.
Tagliabue is no more interested in
upholding moral propriety than Josef
Stalin was. Consider these recent devel
opments in the NFL which Tagliabue has
not addressed.
Cincinnati Bengal rookie wide receiver
Reggie Rembert was arrested and
charged yesterday with driving while
intoxicated after he smashed his car into
a sewer pipe. Drunken driving arrests of
NFL players are as frequent as Eric Dick
erson's gripes these days.
The Denver Broncos are set to wel
come offensive tackle Gerald Perry back
to the team after he was forced to take a
paid absence of leave. Perry was sent
home by the Broncos after being arrested
for his third sexual assault charge in four
seasons. Perry, who has been arrested in
the past for soliciting prostitutes, was
charged this season with third-degree
sexual assault against the fiancee of
teammate Orson Mobley.
The Broncos also have held onto tight
end Clarence Kay, who has been arrested
three times for drunken driving. Kay met
with Tagliabue in New York during the
preseason this year after his third arrest,
but Tagliabue did nothing to punish Kay.
No fine, no suspension. Zippo.

Former Washington defensive end
Dexter Manley wasn't so lucky. His third
violation of the league's substance abuse
policy two years ago led then-Commis
sioner Pete Rozelle to ban Manley from
the league for life. But last week, Tagli
abue seemed willing to let bygones be
bygones and reinstated Manley.
The only explanation that I can find
for Tagliabue's hypocrisy is that he is try
ing to minimize the damage to the
league's image caused by the behavior of
the considerable many hoodlums in the
league. He'll take action when the pub
lic's attention is focused on an issue but
will neglect those transgressions that the
public ignores.
But if the commissioner is going to
overlook so many transgressions and con
done others with petty fines and no sus
pensions, then he should give the Super
Bowl back to Phoenix, or maybe just fine
the city $5,000. Of the sins committed,
Mowatt's et al. was considerably more
repugnant than that of Arizonans.
Or maybe the commissioner should
just get out of the business of trying to
dispense justice and uphold the morally
right. In my opinion, moral hypocrisy is
worse than moral corruption.

was suspended.
That's not exactly the unequivocal
condemnation that I had hoped for.
In fact, it is so incredibly dispropor
tionate to the seriousness of the incident
that it makes the commissioner look
rather hypocritical after taking the Super
Bowl away from Phoenix, which after all
as a city did vote in favor of the King hol
iday even though it lost on the state bal
lot. The fact that Tagliabue fined Cincin
nati coach Sam Wyche $30,000 this sea
son for keeping a woman reporter out of

the locker room makes the fines of
Mowatt, Timpson, Perryman and the
Patriot organization even more ludicrous.
Tagliabue is no more interested in
upholding moral propriety than Josef
Stalin was. Consider these recent devel
opments in the NFL which Tagliabue has
not addressed.
Cincinnati Bengal rookie wide receiver
Reggie Rembert was arrested and
charged yesterday with driving while
intoxicated after he smashed his car into
a sewer pipe. Drunken driving arrests of
NFL players are as frequent as Eric Dick
erson's gripes these days.
The Denver Broncos are set to wel
come offensive tackle Gerald Perry back
to the team after he was forced to take a
paid absence of leave. Perry was sent
home by the Broncos after being arrested
for his third sexual assault charge in four
seasons. Perry, who has been arrested in
the past for soliciting prostitutes, was
charged this season with third-degree
sexual assault against the fiancee of
teammate Orson Mobley.
The Broncos also have held onto tight
end Clarence Kay, who has been arrested
three times for drunken driving. Kay met
with Tagliabue in New York during the
preseason this year after his third arrest,
but Tagliabue did nothing to punish Kay.
No fine, no suspension. Zippo.

Former Washington defensive end
Dexter Manley wasn't so lucky. His third
violation of the league's substance abuse
policy two years ago led then-Commis
sioner Pete Rozelle to ban Manley from
the league for life. But last week, Tagli
abue seemed willing to let bygones be
bygones and reinstated Manley.
The only explanation that I can find
for Tagliabue's hypocrisy is that he is try
ing to minimize the damage to the
league's image caused by the behavior of
the considerable many hoodlums in the
league. He'll take action when the pub
lic's attention is focused on an issue but
will neglect those transgressions that the
public ignores.
But if the commissioner is going to
overlook so many transgressions and con
done others with petty fines and no sus
pensions, then he should give the Super
Bowl back to Phoenix, or maybe just fine
the city $5,000. Of the sins committed,
Mowatt's et al. was considerably more
repugnant than that of Arizonans.
Or maybe the commissioner should
just get out of the business of trying to
dispense justice and uphold the morally
right. In my opinion, moral hypocrisy is
worse than moral corruption.

Paul Tagliabue should take a bow. As
the National Football League's
commissioner, he has made the
NFL not only the source of great Sunday
afternoon entertainment but also the
moral leader of professional sports
leagues.
After the voters in Arizona rejected a
proposed holiday to honor Martin Luther
King Jr., Tagliabue threatened to move
the 1993 Super Bowl out of Phoenix in
Erotest. The message, Tagliabue would
ave us believe, is that the NFL is not
morally neutral and in fact can be a vehi
cle for social change and justice.
Yeah, right.
Yesterday's sports headlines will tell
you just how far the NFL will go to
uphold its moral precepts. On Tuesday,
Tagliabue issued his sentences for the
perpetrators of the league's other ugly
incident this season: the Lisa Olson inci
dent.
Olson was the Boston Herald reporter
who was alledgedly sexually harrassed by
several New England Patriot players in
the Pats' locker room after a game Sept.
17. After the incident and the media out
cry, Tagliabue formed a commission
headed by Harvard Law Professor and
former Watergate prosecutor Philip Hey
mann to investigate the incident and
uncover the truth.

After interviewing 91 witnesses, Iley
mann compiled a 60-page report for
Tagliabue which detailed the events of
Sept. 17. Among the disgraces outlined in
Heymann's report:
• An unknown player stood naked next
to Olson as she was interviewing a Patriot
player, saying to her "Here's what you
want. Do you want to take a bite out of
this?"
• Tight end Zeke Mowatt "purposely
displayed himself to her in a suggestive
way. Laughter erupted and shouts from
other players continued, especially 'Is she
looking? Is she looking at it?'"
• Heymann concluded that "Mowatt's
account of the same period is not credi
ble." That is to say, he lied.
• The Patriots' management was
equally responsible since "No one tried to
bring the humiliating activity around

Lisa Olson to a stop. Neither players nor
management personnel said or did any
thing."
In my mind, all of this qualifies as
being morally repugnant. This inci
dent, more than any in the NFL that I
can remember, deserved a swift response
from Tagliabue with strong punishments
imposed on the perpetrators. It was the
commissioner's golden opportunity to
assert once again that the NFL is not a
morally neutral institution.
So Tagliabue fined Mowatt $12,500
and fellow players Robert Perryman and
Michael Timpson $5,000 each. The
Patriot organization was fined $50,000
for its inaction following the incident and
for some repulsive public statements
from team owner Victor Kiam. No one
was suspended.
That's not exactly the unequivocal
condemnation that I had hoped for.
In fact, it is so incredibly dispropor
tionate to the seriousness of the incident
that it makes the commissioner look
