# Cardinal gridders place many athletes on all-league team

It was repeated all season long.
It was especially prominent when
Stanford almost beat Colorado,
when the Cardinal lost to San
Jose State, when the squad suf
fered through a three-game losing
streak.
"Stanford's a better team than
its record shows." Though the
Cardinal ended the year with
three consecutive, and impressive
victories, a 5-6 tally was not
reflective of the team's potential.
Or its overall performance.
The Pacific 10 Conference
coaches agreed. Four Stanford
C layers were selected to the all
>ague first team, the third-high
est total among the 10 squads.
Ten gridders in all were given con
ference honors.
"It just goes to show that the
players here at Stanford are up
there with the best," selectee
Kevin Scott said. "Having four
[players] on the first team shows

that we are up there in the Pac.
It's great for the program."
Wide receiver Ed McCaffrey,
running back Glyn Milburn and
offensive lineman Bob Whitfield
were chosen for the first team
offense, while cornerback Scott
was named to the defensive unit.
All were first-time selections.
Only McCaffrey and Scott are
seniors.
"It's a really positive step [for
the program 1" said coach Denny
Green. "Ed clearly played like an
All-American this season, Mil
burn was the most explosive new
comer [in the country] and though
he played really well all year, he
really put up the numbers in the
last three games. Bob continued
his ascent to be the best offensive
lineman in the country."
All-American McCaffrey
caught 61 passes for 917 yards,
both of which led the Pac-10 and
were in the top 10 nationally. Mil
burn, the nation's No. 1 all-pur
pose runner with a 202 yards-per
game average, raced for a school

record 2,222 all purpose yards,
including 729 rushing, and caught
64 passes for 632 yards. Left
tackle Whitfield, who is the only
sophomore finalist for the presti
gious Outland Trophy, was also
just named Football News second
team All-American. Defensive
leader Scott had 53 tackles,
including four for loss, three
interceptions, six deflected passes,
and two fumble recoveries — the
second of which was the onside
kick-off at Big Game.
In addition, linebacker Jono
Tunney and Milburn were
selected as second team defensive
all-conference players. The senior
inside linebacker's 82 tackles led
the team for the third consecutive
year. Milburn's second selection,
this time as a return specialist,
honored his 594 yards in kickoff
returns and 267 yards in running
back punts.
Quarterback Jason Palumbis,
linebackers Dave Garnett and
Ron George, fullback Tommy
Vardell and place kicker John

Hopkins were named honorable
mention All Pac-10. All but Hop
kins return next season.
"We're a little disappointed
that Jason didn't get at least sec
ond team, but with a year to go
he'll be ready to go out and chase
the top honors," Green said.
Palumbis posted a 68.6 comple
tion percention, the best in the
nation and a Stanford record. He
also passed for 2,579 yards and 11
touchdowns. George and Garnett
solidified into a potent lineback
ing tandem, and by the end of the
season became a nightmare for
opposing quarterbacks. Vardell set
a new Cardinal record of 14 rush
ing touchdowns, and Hopkins
broke the school records for most
field goals in a game and most
career points with his winning
field goal at Big Game.
Washington's Greg Lewis was
named Pac-10 Offensive Player of
the Year, and Arizona's Darryl
Lewis and Washington's Steve
Emtman were Co-Defensive Play
ers of the Year. Tailback Greg

Lewis led the Pac-10 and was
sixth in the nation in rushing with
1,279 yards. Cornerback Darryl
Lewis led the conference and was
second in the NCAA with seven
interceptions, and tackle Emtman
led the Husky defense that
allowed fewer than 300 yards and
14 points a game.
Trailing the conference pub
lishment by a few days, the Cardi
nal also just announced its
"bests," giving out team awards at
the annual football banquet. The
Most Valuable Player, as selected
by his teammates, was McCaffrey,
but Milburn stole the show, taking
home four awards. Mr. Excite
ment was named Top Sophomore,
Special Teams Offensive Player of
the Year, Top Player in the Big
Game, and was honored for being
named Pac-10 Player of the Week
for his 379 all purpose yards
agasint Cal.
Walk-on Toby Norwood was
named Outstanding Freshman for
his play on special teams. Offen
sive lineman Chris Dalman

accepted his Outstanding Junior
award in the name of the entire
offensive line. Senior running
back Jon Volpe was given the Jim
Reynolds Trophy as the player
demonstrating courage on the
field and dedication to the game.
The A 1 Masters Award for the
player most representing the ideal
Stanford athlete — athletic
achievement, performance and
academics — and usually reserved
for a senior, went to sophomore
Garnett.
Vardell won the Russel-Huston
Award for the player who exempli
fies aggressiveness and excep
tional performance, and offensive
guard Tyrone Parker and
linebacker Kevin Puk were named
Outstanding Scout Team players.
Whitfield joined Milburn as the
Outstanding Player of the Big
Game, and linebacker Vince
Otoupal was Milburn's counter
part for the special teams award,
winning Defensive Player of the
Year.

all-conference players. The senior
inside linebacker's 82 tackles led
the team for the third consecutive
year. Milburn's second selection,
this time as a return specialist,
honored his 594 yards in kickoff
returns and 267 yards in running
back punts.
Quarterback Jason Palumbis,
linebackers Dave Garnett and
Ron George, fullback Tommy
Vardell and place kicker John

Hopkins were named honorable
mention All Pac-10. All but Hop
kins return next season.
"We're a little disappointed
that Jason didn't get at least sec
ond team, but with a year to go
he'll be ready to go out and chase
the top honors," Green said.
Palumbis posted a 68.6 comple
tion percention, the best in the
nation and a Stanford record. He
also passed for 2,579 yards and 11
touchdowns. George and Garnett
solidified into a potent lineback
ing tandem, and by the end of the
season became a nightmare for
opposing quarterbacks. Vardell set
a new Cardinal record of 14 rush
ing touchdowns, and Hopkins
broke the school records for most
field goals in a game and most
career points with his winning
field goal at Big Game.
Washington's Greg Lewis was
named Pac-10 Offensive Player of
the Year, and Arizona's Darryl
Lewis and Washington's Steve
Emtman were Co-Defensive Play
ers of the Year. Tailback Greg

Lewis led the Pac-10 and was
sixth in the nation in rushing with
1,279 yards. Cornerback Darryl
Lewis led the conference and was
second in the NCAA with seven
interceptions, and tackle Emtman
led the Husky defense that
allowed fewer than 300 yards and
14 points a game.
Trailing the conference pub
lishment by a few days, the Cardi
nal also just announced its
"bests," giving out team awards at
the annual football banquet. The
Most Valuable Player, as selected
by his teammates, was McCaffrey,
but Milburn stole the show, taking
home four awards. Mr. Excite
ment was named Top Sophomore,
Special Teams Offensive Player of
the Year, Top Player in the Big
Game, and was honored for being
named Pac-10 Player of the Week
for his 379 all purpose yards
agasint Cal.
Walk-on Toby Norwood was
named Outstanding Freshman for
his play on special teams. Offen
sive lineman Chris Dalman

accepted his Outstanding Junior
award in the name of the entire
offensive line. Senior running
back Jon Volpe was given the Jim
Reynolds Trophy as the player
demonstrating courage on the
field and dedication to the game.
The A 1 Masters Award for the
player most representing the ideal
Stanford athlete — athletic
achievement, performance and
academics — and usually reserved
for a senior, went to sophomore
Garnett.
Vardell won the Russel-Huston
Award for the player who exempli
fies aggressiveness and excep
tional performance, and offensive
guard Tyrone Parker and
linebacker Kevin Puk were named
Outstanding Scout Team players.
Whitfield joined Milburn as the
Outstanding Player of the Big
Game, and linebacker Vince
Otoupal was Milburn's counter
part for the special teams award,
winning Defensive Player of the
Year.
It was repeated all season long.
It was especially prominent when
Stanford almost beat Colorado,
when the Cardinal lost to San
Jose State, when the squad suf
fered through a three-game losing
streak.
"Stanford's a better team than
its record shows." Though the
Cardinal ended the year with
three consecutive, and impressive
victories, a 5-6 tally was not
reflective of the team's potential.
Or its overall performance.
The Pacific 10 Conference
coaches agreed. Four Stanford
C layers were selected to the all
>ague first team, the third-high
est total among the 10 squads.
Ten gridders in all were given con
ference honors.
"It just goes to show that the
players here at Stanford are up
there with the best," selectee
Kevin Scott said. "Having four
[players] on the first team shows

that we are up there in the Pac.
It's great for the program."
Wide receiver Ed McCaffrey,
running back Glyn Milburn and
offensive lineman Bob Whitfield
were chosen for the first team
offense, while cornerback Scott
was named to the defensive unit.
All were first-time selections.
Only McCaffrey and Scott are
seniors.
"It's a really positive step [for
the program 1" said coach Denny
Green. "Ed clearly played like an
All-American this season, Mil
burn was the most explosive new
comer [in the country] and though
he played really well all year, he
really put up the numbers in the
last three games. Bob continued
his ascent to be the best offensive
lineman in the country."
All-American McCaffrey
caught 61 passes for 917 yards,
both of which led the Pac-10 and
were in the top 10 nationally. Mil
burn, the nation's No. 1 all-pur
pose runner with a 202 yards-per
game average, raced for a school

record 2,222 all purpose yards,
including 729 rushing, and caught
64 passes for 632 yards. Left
tackle Whitfield, who is the only
sophomore finalist for the presti
gious Outland Trophy, was also
just named Football News second
team All-American. Defensive
leader Scott had 53 tackles,
including four for loss, three
interceptions, six deflected passes,
and two fumble recoveries — the
second of which was the onside
kick-off at Big Game.
In addition, linebacker Jono
Tunney and Milburn were
selected as second team defensive
all-conference players. The senior
inside linebacker's 82 tackles led
the team for the third consecutive
