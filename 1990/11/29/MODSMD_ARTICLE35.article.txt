## Drama Department play explores issues of race 
### Anita Schneider Staff writer 
After receiving his bachelor's
at Harvard University, Harry
Elam considered going to law
school. But he realized that the
drama of the courtroom was the
only thing that excited him
about law.
So instead, Elam went to
Berkeley to earn his master's
and doctorate in drama.
Prof. Elam is currently visit
ing Stanford from the Univer
sity of Maryland—College Park,
and is instructing students in
black drama, contemporary
American drama, non-tradi
tional drama and works of con
temporary black playwrights.
Elam is also directing George
Wolfe's "The Colored
Museum," which opened last
night at the Nitery and runs
through this weekend.
"The Colored Museum" has
a rich and unavoidable message.
As Elam explains, "all people
have to lose their cultural blin
ders — the things that color
their perceptions of African-
American culture."
In Wolfe's controversial play,
we are all challenged to re
examine the stereotypes we
have of black Americans. Wolfe,
himself tired of being defined by
labels and preconceived
notions, wrote the play as a
series of vignettes, with differ
ent characters and a different
stereotype in each.
Each of the characters —
some humorous, some harrow
ing — have a different way of
dealing with the pain of their
cultural past.
In "Soldier with a Secret,"
Junie, a black Vietnam veteran,

believes death is the only solu
tion to stopping his pain, while
characters in the"The Photo
Session" hide behind the pages
of Ebony magazine to gloss over
theirs.
A black businessman mov
ing up the corporate ladder in
"Symbiosis" tries to destroy his
younger self and every element
of his youth — including his
Tfemptations albums and his
Converse All-Stars. And in
"The Hairpiece," standards of
beauty are illuminated as a
woman considers which wig to
wear — Afro or straight hair.
By dramatizing stereotypes,
Wolfe is instructing black audi
ences to not avoid the experi
ences that are painful in being
black, but to realize that there's
a great cultural diversity and a
contradiction in identity that's
not be escaped, but to be
embraced.
In the final scene, set aboard
the cockpit of an airplane, Tbpsy
says, "Before exiting, check the
overhead as any baggage you
don't claim, we trash."
As Elam suggests, what
Tbpsy really is saying is, "Please
claim your history, your past,
the things that you treasure. As
you leave, bring that with you.
It's important to carry that with
you."
And both Wolfe and Elam are
trying to get people to realize
just that.

"The Colored Museum " is pre
sented in collaboration with the
Committee on Black Perform
ing Arts and runs from Wednes
day to Friday at 8 p.m., Satur
day at 1 and 2 p.m. and Sunday
at 2 p.m. Tickets are available
by calling 725-ARTS.
