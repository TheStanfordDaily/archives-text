# San Francisco Symphony salutes Stanford Centennial

3 Mahler, Bach, champagne,
| chocolate truffles and glory to
i Stanford. A divine afternoon is in
; the making this Sunday when the
San Francisco Symphony salutes
Stanford's Centennial with a com-
H mand performance followed by a
,F gala reception at Davies Symphony
v Hall in San Francisco.
The concert will open with the Stanford
Hymn, performed by the Stanford Symphonic
, Chorus, and the program includes Gustav
Mahler's Symphony No. 5. Stanford student
Chuck Seiber is the featured soloist for J.S.
Bach's Concerto in A Minor for Violin.
Seiber, a graduate student in manufactur
ing systems engineering, auditioned last May,
with three other outstanding student musi
cians selected by the Music Department. And
with only three days' notice.
Well aware of the talent of the others who
auditioned, Seiber says he was amazed when
he was informed that he would be performing
the violin solo for the evening.
"Being from Davis, I always thought the
San Francisco Symphony was
the pinnacle. This is a
dream come true for

J me," he said. "It is such a great
musical honor. I'd be happy to
?lay 'TVinlde TVinkle, Little Star'
them."
ls it happened, it is not "TVinkle
e," but another masterpiece that
n assigned to him. The Concerto
lor is a short work which will con
l with the longer Mahler sym
violin solo," Seiber says, "people
ng, romantic concerto However,
lis for a more compact, clean per
is not flashy and ritzy. It is
ectual music."
Seiber has been working with a student pianist for
months to learn the music. He has met with San Fran
cisco conductor Herbert Blomstedt only once for a half
an hour, and he will meet with the orchestra for the
first time on Sunday afternoon for their first rehearsal
together before the concert.
Seiber jokingly predicts that when he steps out onto
the stage, he will be thinking "I'm really an engineer.
I'm not supposed to be here. Where's the drafting
table?"

This engineer looks forward
to seeing how the audience will
react to his performance.
Seiber can be assured of at

least a few satisfied listeners, as his parents from
nearby Davis will attend, and will "bring along hordes
of relatives and friends."
Seiber's parents have always been supportive of his
musical endeavors. When he began violin lessons at
age five, it was much more his parents' idea than his,
but by the time he reached high school and got
involved with the "artsy music crowd," he had devel
oped the intrinsic love of music that is now so much a
part of his personality.
During high school, the numerous honors he
received for his performances both at home and
abroad led to his decision to attend the prestigious
Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York.
After a year there, he decided to transfer to Stanford
where he felt he could pursue a more diverse univer
sity career.
It has turned out to be the right decision for Seiber.
"If it were not for the atmosphere of the Music Depart
ment here, which is -both excellent and enjoyable, I
probably would have just gotten lost in my engineer
ing problem sets," he says.
Far from being lost, Seiber will be a shining repre
sentative of the intellectual diversity of Stanford
University at the musical tribute this Sunday.
A Stanford motif will adorn one of the Christmas
trees that deck the symphony hall throughout Decem
ber "I think this will help make the event especially
meaningful," says Susan Wolfe, assistant director of
the Stanford Centennial.
Stanford singing groups placed throughout the hall
will perform seasonal music during the reception, and
the hall will also be decorated with banners commem
orating Stanford's past 100 years.
Hot spiced cider will be served at intermission, and
champagne and chocolates will be served at the recep
tion afterward.
With students, alumni, faculty, staff and other
members and supporters of the Stanford "family" pre
sent, Wolfe thinte it will be an especially festive com
munity celebration.
"It will truly be a Stanford family event," she
promises.

Tickets for Sunday's performance are available from
Tresidder Ticket Office, 725-ARTS. Tickets cost $15
for students, $25 for faculty and relatives.

lor is a short work which will con
l with the longer Mahler sym
violin solo," Seiber says, "people
ng, romantic concerto However,
lis for a more compact, clean per
is not flashy and ritzy. It is
ectual music."
Seiber has been working with a student pianist for
months to learn the music. He has met with San Fran
cisco conductor Herbert Blomstedt only once for a half
an hour, and he will meet with the orchestra for the
first time on Sunday afternoon for their first rehearsal
together before the concert.
Seiber jokingly predicts that when he steps out onto
the stage, he will be thinking "I'm really an engineer.
I'm not supposed to be here. Where's the drafting
table?"

This engineer looks forward
to seeing how the audience will
react to his performance.
Seiber can be assured of at

least a few satisfied listeners, as his parents from
nearby Davis will attend, and will "bring along hordes
of relatives and friends."
Seiber's parents have always been supportive of his
musical endeavors. When he began violin lessons at
age five, it was much more his parents' idea than his,
but by the time he reached high school and got
involved with the "artsy music crowd," he had devel
oped the intrinsic love of music that is now so much a
part of his personality.
During high school, the numerous honors he
received for his performances both at home and
abroad led to his decision to attend the prestigious
Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York.
After a year there, he decided to transfer to Stanford
where he felt he could pursue a more diverse univer
sity career.
It has turned out to be the right decision for Seiber.
"If it were not for the atmosphere of the Music Depart
ment here, which is -both excellent and enjoyable, I
probably would have just gotten lost in my engineer
ing problem sets," he says.
Far from being lost, Seiber will be a shining repre
sentative of the intellectual diversity of Stanford
University at the musical tribute this Sunday.
A Stanford motif will adorn one of the Christmas
trees that deck the symphony hall throughout Decem
ber "I think this will help make the event especially
meaningful," says Susan Wolfe, assistant director of
the Stanford Centennial.
Stanford singing groups placed throughout the hall
will perform seasonal music during the reception, and
the hall will also be decorated with banners commem
orating Stanford's past 100 years.
Hot spiced cider will be served at intermission, and
champagne and chocolates will be served at the recep
tion afterward.
With students, alumni, faculty, staff and other
members and supporters of the Stanford "family" pre
sent, Wolfe thinte it will be an especially festive com
munity celebration.
"It will truly be a Stanford family event," she
promises.

Tickets for Sunday's performance are available from
Tresidder Ticket Office, 725-ARTS. Tickets cost $15
for students, $25 for faculty and relatives.
