# Juan Darien' a bizarre and enticing mix of music, dance, puppetry
## 
### Melissa Dagodag Staff writer 
"Juan Darien" is a uniquely frightening, yet
uplifting cross-cultural blend of music, dance and
puppetry.
Although the Marines' Memorial Theater bills
it as appropriate for children, and alleges that
they will bea>me theater-lovers for life after view
ing this Carnival Mass, the solemn, dark, wooden
masks of many performers; the alluring, yet
melancholy tone of the Requiem Mass sung in
Spanish, and the obscene gestures of puppets cop
ulating and defecating behind the puppeteers'
screen might be more suitable for adults.
The show, written by Julie Taymor and Elliot
Goldenthal and directed by Taymor, is a musical
fable (Goldenthal wrote the music) drawn from
the short story of an Uruguayan writer; Horatio
Quiroga.
The fable involves the magical transformation
of a jaguar cub into a boy,when a bereaved mother
lovingjy breast-feeds the orphan cub. Eventually,
after the woman whom he considers to be his
mother dies, Juan Darien enters the real world as
an adolescent, only to be goaded into reverting to
his former animal stature by the cruelty of
mankind.
Ultimately, Juan returns as a jaguar to the
wild jungle from which he came.
The torture and re-transformation of Juan
Darien is enacted quite violently as his shirt is
torn off, and he is placed on top of a whipping
block. A company of 18 performers bring this
frightening and dramatic tale to life.

The sets of "Juan Darien" are magnificent,
ranging from the enormous jungle leaves which
descend onto the stage, to the colorful banners
swirling around Juan in the Carnival scene. The
hundreds of white butterflies in the third scene
send the same kind of excited chills through the
audience as the Flying Monkeys of "The Wizard
of Oz" generate.
The costume of the domineering
schoolteacher, with an opened book substituting
for hair, is quite ingenious. The singing is
exquisite, and the sounds of several rarely-heard
instruments add to the powerfully eerie sensa
tions which the play induces in its viewers.
However, "Juan Darien" is much more than a
bizarre extravaganza of sights and sounds, for its
plot offers food for thought.
In a sense, the play is a commentary on
racism, which makes an outsider all too keenly
aware of his or her differences from others. Cru
elly, Tbledo whips the ground behind Juan, tortur
ing him and marking nim with red slashes — fig
uratively and literally making him different from
all the other non-jaguars.
All in all, it's more than worth your while.

"Juan Darien" had its West Coast premiere at the
Marines' Memorial Theater on Nov. 14 and will
run until Dec. 9. Showtimes are Tuesday
through Saturday at 8 p.m., with matinees on
Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday at 2 p.m..
Tickets are $22 for balcony and $32 for orchestra
Tuesday through Thursday. $24 and $34 Friday
through Sunday. Tickets are available through
Ticketron, (415) 243-9001.
