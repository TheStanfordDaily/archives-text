Silly Velveteen Rabbit
Lively Arts at Stanford presents a special family holiday perfor
mance of The Velveteen Rabbit, by the Oberlin Dance Company-
San Francisco. A brand new production of Margery Williams' warm
and magical children's tale, the ballet will be performed at 7:30 p.m.
Friday and Saturday and 2 p.m. Sunday in Memorial Auditorium.
The story deals with the world of an exuberant child, a disapproving
nanny and a soft, plush velveteen rabbit endowed with "real life" by
a little boy. As the press release notes, "When circumstances part
them, the rabbit must search for his true identity, finding at last
that being real means 'somebody loves you.'" Sounds like a Whitney
Houston song.
Tell Penn, don't Tell Her
The zany, madcap, nutty, crazy, silly, goofy performers of magi
cal buffoonery bring their new "Refrigerator Tour" to the Warfield
Theatre for a short stint, running from last night through Dec. 9.
Perm's the guy who talks, Teller's his short friend who bears the
brunt of most of the duo's tricks. Together, they form an amazing
pair of showmen that take their task seriously, and make fun of
themselves at the same time. Call 775-7722 for show information.
