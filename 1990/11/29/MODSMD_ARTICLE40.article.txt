## O.J.'s Saudi trip misguided 
### 
Ah, thanksgiving, a
time to reflect on the
blessings of the year. An
afternoon to spend renewing the
ties that bind family and
friends.
For NBC Sports, however, the
holiday was used for an ill-con
ceivea and poorly produced
journey to the Middle East that
succeeded only in trivializing
the Gulf Crisis.
As part of its coverage of the
Detroit Lions/Denver Broncos
clash on Thanksgiving day,
NBC's "NFL Live" sent studio
analyst and football legend O.J.
Simpson to Saudi Arabia to cap
ture the mood of American sol
diers spending the holiday in
the Persian Gulf.
"The Juice's" sojourn proved
to be a low moment in sports
journalism. Simply put, he was
as out of place as Bob Hope
would be broadcasting the Super
Bowl.
Simpson provided a series of
meaningless live reports from a
U.S. base in the Saudi desert all
throughout Hirkey Day. In his
pre-game segment, the running
back-turned-actor (remember
"Capricorn One"?)-turned
sportscaster enjoyed his best
moments of the broadcast
introducing a rather frivolous
taped segment chronicling his
visits with service men and
women as they performed their
daily tasks.
Ridiculously clutching a
football, the erstwhile Buffalo
Bill demonstrated a real inabil
ity to put together a coherent
sentence. Without the benefit of
a teleprompter, Juice fumbled

his way through an impromptu
conversation about the
Lions/Broncos match-up with
Marines from Detroit and Den
ver. The entire exchange was
largely unintelligible.
"NFL Live" anchor Bob
Costa s, who is unquestionably
the most talented broadcaster in
sports television today, was
then placed in the awkward role
of facilitating a dialogue
between a lieutenant in Saudi
Arabia and her family back in
the United States.
This long distance call, while
tender, seems better suited for
AT&T than for NBC. It was an
intrusion on a difficult moment
for a separated family, and it
exploited the emotional trauma
of those left in the wake of Oper
ation Desert Shield.
As if Thursday's mistakes
were not enougn, Sunday's
installment of "Live" featured
Simpson, safely back in a New
York studio, fondly recalling the
highlights of his mission to the
Middle East. Certainly not the
stuff Emmys are made of.
The "Juice Journey" is the
latest in a series of unnecessary
tinkerings with "NFL Live."
With the capable Costas at the
helm, the show has consistently
outperformed its CBS rival,
"The NFL Today." Ratings
stunts like Simpson's trip serve
only damage the credibility of
an otherwise excellent program.
Let's hope the crisis in the
Gulf is resolved quickly, before
"Santa Simpson" returns with
yuletide greetings for a Saudi
Christmas.
