# Um, has anyone seen our $8 million?
## 
### 
This week, to express our solidarity with Joel
Stein, we thought we'd celebrate that down
trodden community of unfortunates: Daily
columnists. We decided to make an agenda and
stamp out oppression everywhere in one fell
blow. We would empower ourselves so much
that our shorts would glow. This article would
be the instrument of freedom for good souls
everywhere, the very manifesto of The Good
Life.
But then we realized that excerpts of it might
wind up in the Review, so we nixed it.
Besides, the University's $8 million budget
boo-boo is a lot more amusing. Isn't it funny to
imagine our administration hurriedly trying to
chop as much funding from as many programs
as it can? Hee, hee.
Obviously, this kind of streamlining is neces
sary, but Provost James Rosse and that crowd
don't have a very effective plan for doing it.
Their cunning strategy revolves around the
mysterious process of "repositioning." What a
nice, inoffensive word. Sounds like everything's
going to be pretty much the same, just in differ
ent places.
We can see how a lost of money's going to be
saved once we all start taking classes in the Post
Office and bying books at the Mausoleum.
Clearly, the Budget People need our help. So
here you go, Jim:
First, figure out what really needs to go.
Instead of bagging the odd overseas program
here and there, try to be more realistic. We're
wasting a bunch of money right here on The
Farm.
For example, two weeks ago, we saw over
$20,000 go up in smoke. After the surprising
and heart-warming thumbs-down we gave the
Axe Committee two years ago, some of you felt

guilty and let them back on campus. And now
they're back to their old tricks, frying large,
stuffed animals in the Lagunita Dust Bowl.
Well, we're all for a good campfire, but we can
think of cheaper ways to fix our vittles.
And while it has alwavs been our fervent
desire that the members of the Axe Committee
dine well before Big Game, it hasn't always been
our fervent desire to pick up the tab. Axe the
fire, Jim, and we're up a cool $30,000.
Stanford could also save a good deal of green
by finding new jobs for those guys with the
Ghostbuster packs that blow leaves out of the
way. They just frolic around in pairs playing air
hockey, then bound off while the wind rear
ranges the leaves on the sidewalk behind them.
It's "repositioning," we suppose, but...
Certainly, we have seen some exciting new
patterns over the years, but we have the Rodin
Sculpture Garden for all the art we want
(although, maybe we should get rid of that, too.
How much could we get for The Gates of Hell?).
Let's sell their packs back to Paramount and
save some cash.
No doubt some will complain that this is too
dangerous. Students will ever have to be on
their guard against turning an ankle on a stray
leaf. But look at it this way: Cowell will just give
the injured students a sheet on "How to Take
Care of Your Cold or Flu." Xeroxing's cheap, so
we don't lost any money there.
But besides simply cutting the budget, Jim,
we need a way to increase revenue. Sure, there's
the traditional method: raising student tuition
(again). But that's getting stale. And it's getting
annoying.
There are certainly a few more inventive and
lucrative projects that can be carried out. We
can start by levying heavy fines on vehicles

parked illegally in loading zones located conve
niently close to certain dorm rooms. Janet
Evans is probably good for a couple grand that
way.
And Jim, where do all the quarters go that we
pump so faithfully into those washing
machines? Do the RFs go on laundry-subsi
dized junkets to the Bahamas? Well, we'd like to
see the University better tap this amazing
resource. Those washers and dryers have to be
worth hundreds of thousands every yean And if
we make the washers even smaller and the
dryer cycles even shorter, we can probably soak
students for double that
With an aggressive, new stance on fundrais
ing and a sharper eye toward trimming waste,
we don't need to panic when Dick Cheney and
his cronies in the Pentagon quit tossing crumbs
our way.

sition" the due-dates of a few papers. Paul
Grubb secretly desires his own Leafbuster
Power Pak.

everywhere, the very manifesto of The Good
Life.
But then we realized that excerpts of it might
wind up in the Review, so we nixed it.
Besides, the University's $8 million budget
boo-boo is a lot more amusing. Isn't it funny to
imagine our administration hurriedly trying to
chop as much funding from as many programs
as it can? Hee, hee.
Obviously, this kind of streamlining is neces
sary, but Provost James Rosse and that crowd
don't have a very effective plan for doing it.
Their cunning strategy revolves around the
mysterious process of "repositioning." What a
nice, inoffensive word. Sounds like everything's
going to be pretty much the same, just in differ
ent places.
We can see how a lost of money's going to be
saved once we all start taking classes in the Post
Office and bying books at the Mausoleum.
Clearly, the Budget People need our help. So
here you go, Jim:
First, figure out what really needs to go.
Instead of bagging the odd overseas program
here and there, try to be more realistic. We're
wasting a bunch of money right here on The
Farm.
For example, two weeks ago, we saw over
$20,000 go up in smoke. After the surprising
and heart-warming thumbs-down we gave the
Axe Committee two years ago, some of you felt

guilty and let them back on campus. And now
they're back to their old tricks, frying large,
stuffed animals in the Lagunita Dust Bowl.
Well, we're all for a good campfire, but we can
think of cheaper ways to fix our vittles.
And while it has alwavs been our fervent
desire that the members of the Axe Committee
dine well before Big Game, it hasn't always been
our fervent desire to pick up the tab. Axe the
fire, Jim, and we're up a cool $30,000.
Stanford could also save a good deal of green
by finding new jobs for those guys with the
Ghostbuster packs that blow leaves out of the
way. They just frolic around in pairs playing air
hockey, then bound off while the wind rear
ranges the leaves on the sidewalk behind them.
It's "repositioning," we suppose, but...
Certainly, we have seen some exciting new
patterns over the years, but we have the Rodin
Sculpture Garden for all the art we want
(although, maybe we should get rid of that, too.
How much could we get for The Gates of Hell?).
Let's sell their packs back to Paramount and
save some cash.
No doubt some will complain that this is too
dangerous. Students will ever have to be on
their guard against turning an ankle on a stray
leaf. But look at it this way: Cowell will just give
the injured students a sheet on "How to Take
Care of Your Cold or Flu." Xeroxing's cheap, so
we don't lost any money there.
But besides simply cutting the budget, Jim,
we need a way to increase revenue. Sure, there's
the traditional method: raising student tuition
(again). But that's getting stale. And it's getting
annoying.
There are certainly a few more inventive and
lucrative projects that can be carried out. We
can start by levying heavy fines on vehicles

parked illegally in loading zones located conve
niently close to certain dorm rooms. Janet
Evans is probably good for a couple grand that
way.
And Jim, where do all the quarters go that we
pump so faithfully into those washing
machines? Do the RFs go on laundry-subsi
dized junkets to the Bahamas? Well, we'd like to
see the University better tap this amazing
resource. Those washers and dryers have to be
worth hundreds of thousands every yean And if
we make the washers even smaller and the
dryer cycles even shorter, we can probably soak
students for double that
With an aggressive, new stance on fundrais
ing and a sharper eye toward trimming waste,
we don't need to panic when Dick Cheney and
his cronies in the Pentagon quit tossing crumbs
our way.

Daniel Kronenfeld is currently trying to "repo
sition" the due-dates of a few papers. Paul
Grubb secretly desires his own Leafbuster
Power Pak.
