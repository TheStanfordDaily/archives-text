Hindu Love Gods
Grade: B+
Fans of R.E.M. are an
intensely devoted lot, quick to
defend the band from its critics.
That the Georgia-based garage
band eventually became MTV
darlings fuels an inevitable
response of "we told you so,"
particularly with respect to
complaints about Michael
Stipe's limited vocal powers.
Fame or not, though, Stipe is
not a great vocalist. He mum
bles, he whines, he seems emi
nently bored with his job. Some
of his most die-hard fans admit
this.
Enter the Hindu Love Gods,
a project which Rolling Stone
has been spreading rumors
about for some time. The band
features Warren Zevon in the
role of lead vocalist, backed by
Bill Berry, Peter Buck and Mike
Mills — essentially, R.E.M.
without Stipe.
The results are impressive.
Zevon is stripped of the
sometimes too-pat Hollywood
backing he sported in his early
days, and wild, previously
masked aggression in R.E.M.'s
rhythm section is revealed. Pit
ted against Zevon's mammoth
and distinctive vocal personal

ity, the R.E.M.ers come alive.
The guitars sound big and
angry; the bass and drums are
solia and loud.
Produced by Andrew Slater
and Niko Bolas, the album is an
extension of Zevon's Virgin
Records debut, "Sentimental
Hygiene," which was recorded
by the same men and also fea
tured back up by the R.E.M.
boys. But the Love Gods have a
different sound, a spontaneity
and collaboration which makes
it seem more of a group effort.
This time around, the selec
tions are all covers, most of
them classic Southern blues.
Included are Robert Johnson's
"Walkm' Blues" and "'fravelin'
Riverside Blues," Willie Dixon's
"Wang Dang Doodle" and a sur
prisingly well-matched version
of Prince's "Raspberry Beret."
Best known for rock hits
such as "Excitable Boy," "Were
wolves of London" and
"Lawyers, Guns and Money,"
Zevon has never sounded bet
ter; he is a natural for old blues.
And the material gives him
vocal opportunities he didn't
have with his rock tunes, oppor
tunities to slide and growl as he
does on such selections as
Johnny Horton's "I'm a One-
Woman Man."
