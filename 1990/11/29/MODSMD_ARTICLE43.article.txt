# Madonna's 'Collection' immaculately fresh

Madonna
The Immaculate Collection
Grade: A-
Madonna has reached the enviable position
of pop stardom where she could literally release
a bowel movement onto a slab of vinyl and sell
millions of copies.
lb her credit, she has never done this, but
critics still argue that her albums contain much
excretory substance and few gems.
With "The Immaculate Collection,"
Madonna serves up a critic-proof compilation
that chronicles her rise to Tbp 40 immortality.
A historical essay on the inside jacket of the
record gushes about her music: "... before her
hit singles became Events, they were great
records, the best of which hit pop's cosmic G
spot..."
For all of you looking for such a spot, well,
now you know where to find it.
The first side of Madonna's musical trip
through the land of nostalgia recounts the
Material Girl's earliest dance pop hits, from
"Holiday" and "Borderline" to "Into the
Groove" and "Crazy for You." With a renewed
sound quality and a few slight remixes to keep
ardent fans amused, it captures well the begin
ning of Madonna's career.
Listening, one realizes that only six years ago
"Like A Virgin" shook conservative parents and
moralists. Tbday, with the rise of 2 Live Crew,
Madonna's lyrics seem innocently risque. The
time capsule feel of side one is unavoidably
endearing, even if you did grow up with Quiet
Riot.
The second side is a more recent assembly of
number-one hits, including "Open Your Heart,"
"Express Yourself" and "Vogue." One pleasant
surprise is the club version of "Like A Prayer,"
which has been circulating dance clubs while
remaining unavailable to the public. Backed by
a persistent electronic beat, it makes for a much

more "danceable" song than the original.
Always the shrewd businesswoman,
Madonna includes two new selections for fans
who already own her greatest hits. "Justify Mv
Love" is a hilarious but undeniably catchy self
parody, complete with heavy breathing and
meloaramatic lyrics: "I want to run naked in a
rainstorm/Make love on a train/I'm open and
ready"
Backed by a languorous, rap-like beat, she
moans her lines with masturbatorv exuber
ance, begging critics to assail her while keeping
her tongue firmly in cheek.
"Rescue Me" is Madonna's most powerful
delivery since "Like a Prayer." It's a stormy
gospel-flavored song that shows how much
stronger and deeper her voice has become since
her days of chirping "Borderline." This strength
is evident in her lyrics, too: "With you I'm not a
fascist/Can't play you like a toy/And when I
need to dominate/You aren't my little boy"
This certainly isn't 1983's Boy Tby talking
anymore.
For those of you who have never bought a
Madonna album but have always had the fan
tasy to do so, now is the time.
You just might find your cosmic G-spot.

Cole Porter covers
make fine tribute
Red Hot & Blue
Various artists
Grade: A
The problem with most benefit albums is
that they often end up as preachy, slap-dash
attempts to make money that you can't stand
after a week. When was the last time you lis
tened to your "We are the World" tape, anyway?

But you can tell "Red Hot & Blue" seeks to do
more tnan raise funds for AIDS research by just
looking at the array of talent it features. The
charity project features the best modern rockers
out there, from David Byrne and U2 to the
Neville Brothers and the Fine Young Cannibals.
Their common goal goes beyond a worthy
charity. As a packet accompanying the tape sug
gests, the album "represents an attempt to
rediscover and reinterpret classic pop songs ...
to rejuvenate contemporary pop music."
The album is a salute to Cole Porter, one of
the top Broadway composers of the 1920s and
'30s. Through his intelligent and frank lyrics in
songs like "Let's Do It, Let's Fall in Love," Porter
helped pave the way for such artists as Prince
and John Lennon to explore sexuality. It's only
fitting, then, that modern musicians pay back
that debt.
By and large, the tape succeeds in evoking
romance and wit of Porter's songs. And by set
ting his lyrics to acoustic guitars and synthesiz
ers, the respective artists bring about innova
tions in Porter's music that no doubt would
have amazed him.
Among other great songs, Sinead O'Connor's
killer rendition of "You Do Something to Me" is
truly a must-have for any of her fans. Similarly,
Annie Lennox of the Eurythmics is perfectly
wistful and sensual as she sings "Every Time
We Say Goodbye."
Besides updating these and other ballads,
"Red Hot" also transforms some of Porter's best
into modern dance music. "Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire" by the Thompson Twins and "Too
Darn Hot" by Erasure stand out.
If raising money for AIDS research isn't
enough motivation to get this album, the music
definitely should be. And if you don't believe
me, check out a TV station near you. A special
video version of "Red Hot & Blue" will hit
ABC's airwaves on Dec. 1.
