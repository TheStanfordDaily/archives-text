CINEMASCOPE

The Krayt
Gary and Martin Kemp
Instead of looking at the shady dealings
of criminals, this film delves Into the psycho
logical workings of their twisted minds.
Centered around a pair of twins who rule
the London underworld during the 19605,
"The Krays" shows you the way they think
and feel, not Just act.
Reversal of Fortune
Glenn Close, Jeremy Irons, Ron Silver
Surpassing the expectations of many,
"Reversal of Fortune" Is a look at Sunny Von
Bulow's deteriorating life of drugs and alco
hol. and the fatal Injection the put It all to
an end.
Jacob's Ladder
Danny Alello. Tim Robblns
Tim Robblns plays Jacob Singer, a
Vietnam veteran who Is living the sedate life
of a U.S. Postal employee until he starts to
be pursued by strange demons. Drunk?
Crazy? Just flat out possessed? We 11... no.
Perhaps Singer was the unwilling participant
In unethical Army experiments.

THE FLICKS FIX

The Cook, The Thief. Hit Wife & Her Lover
Richard Bohrlnger, Michael Gambon,
Before Dead Week hits you full force
(Now, aren't you sorry that you didn't do
those 500 pages of reading when they
were assigned?) take a mental break with
the film that was called the most sensation
al film of the year. They banned The Band
for less than this. Much less.
