# Costner's directorial debut 'Dances' impressively
## 
### 
Dances with Wolves
Kevin Costner, Mary McDonnell
Grade: A
Lieutenant John Dunbar's first non
hostile contact with the Sioux Indians
symbolizes his departure from white
society. He leaves his deserted fort
dressed in full regalia, carrying the
American flag.
By the time he reaches the Sioux vil
lage, he is out of uniform, holding a
bleeding Sioux, her wounds bandaged
with the flag.
At that point in "Dances With
Wolves," Dunbar begins his gradual
immersion into Sioux culture. Through
his fictional experiences, the viewer is
presented a revisionist, although
romantic, vision of the American West

before the days of Joseph Glidden and
Fredrick Jackson Hirnen
Dunbai; played well by Kevin Cost
ner, is an idealist who wishes to see the
frontier before it is gone. He gets his
chance after receiving a commendation
for heroism in a Civil War battle. His
journey from the battlefield to the fron
tier consisting of a couple of excellent
scenes including a bizarre encounter
with the Army commander of Fort
Hayes, is one of the most intriguing sec
tions of the film.
Upon arriving at his new post, Dun
bar discovers that it is nothing more
than a couple of empty sod buildings.
With no garrison to command, he
begins studying the nature around him.
After several encounters between
Dunbar and the Indians, he decides to

make the aforementioned visit to the
Sioux village. The woman he rescues,
named Stands With a Fist (Mary
McDonnell), turns out to be a white
woman who had been raised by the
tribe.
Stands With a Fist eventually acts as
Dunbar'B translator and teacher.
Starved for human contact, Dunbar
spends the majority of his time bonding
with the tribe. He participates in a stun
ning buffalo hunt, marries Stands With
a Fist, takes the Sioux name of Dances
With Wolves, and leads the tribe in
defending their village against a Pawnee
Indian attack.
The remainder of "Dances With
Wolves" concerns Dunbar's capture
and escape from the U.S. Army.
From a commercial viewpoint,

"Dances With Wolves" represents a
reckless gamble. With a running time of
three hours, subtitles for the Lakota
language of the Sioux and, except for
Costnei; a cast of unknown actors, the
film contradicts some of the basic
assumptions of what a major motion
picture should be. Add to this the fact
that Costner served as first-time direc
tor and co-producer, and you have the
recipe for disaster
The result, though, is an epic West
ern that ranks as one of the must-see
films of the year Costner keeps the film
consistently watchable, the pacing is
fairly leisurely but never bogs down,
and the visuals are stunning. In partic
ular; the buffalo hunt must be seen to be
believed.
