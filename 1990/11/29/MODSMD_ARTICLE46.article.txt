Rocky V
Guess who?
Grade: 0+
Dismissing "Rocky V" would be easy.
It is the fifth film in a series of for
mula films. However; in this final go
around, Sylvester Stallone and com
pany attempt to do more than simply
milk their cash cow.
Like the original, this installment
depicts Rocky Balboa's quest for dignity
and self-respect, not fame and fortune.
Wiitten by Stallone, who created the
series, the script focuses on the charac
ters instead of the fights.

And from the very beginning, "Rocky
V" grabs the viewer's attention. Starting
with an outstanding recap of Rocky's
improbable fight for national honor
against Soviet Ivan Drago, the film
moves directly to the chilling conse
quences. The fight has left Rocky
stricken with serious brain damage.
Retiring to his mansion, he quickly
discovers that his attorney has left him
bankrupt. All Rocky has to his name is
his old house in South Philadelphia and
the gym of his dead trainer; Mickey
(Burgess Meredith).
Though it might be hard to believe
that Rocky would allow himself to fall

so far so fast, he confronts and rejects
his most obvious financial option: a
comeback fight. However, he's not
allowed to make his decision in peace.
Throughout the film, an unscrupulous
Don King-type promoter tries to hound
Rocky back into the ring.
With the comeback possibility elimi
nated, the conclusion of "Rocky V"
becomes unknown, giving the film an
unusual quality of uncertainty.
After a surreal flashback of Mickey,
Rocky decides to get on with his life, re
opening the gym. This sets up the
entrance of a young boxer, Tbmmy
Gunn (Tbmmy Morrison), who con

vinces Rocky to become his trainer
A couple of characteristic
training/fight montages occur before
Tbmmy betrays Rocky for the boxing
promoter This forces Rocky to watch
Tbmmy battle for the title from the
comfort of his own basement. In one of
the best scenes of the film, Rocky
unconsciously boxes his old punching
bag as he watches the fight.
The end of the film comes in the
form of an epic street brawl between
Rocky and Tbmmy. It is a fitting final
fight for Rocky. His life has come full
circle.
