# 'Rescuers' in Disney tradition

### 
Rescuers Down Under
Miss Bianca Bernard
Grade: A
I once received a card that
read, "You know you're getting
old when your first car dies, your
first boyfriend gets married and
people start calling you ma'am."
All of these things happened
to me quite some time ago, but
I've never felt really old until I
saw "The Rescuers Down
Under" And cried.
I know, everyone cries when
Bambi loses his mother, and
when Dumbo loses his — that's
natural. But crying during the
opening scene?
I'm not kidding. No sooner
had the movie started than tears
came to my eyes. What a sap!
In retrospect, however, I'm
not that ashamed. OK, so I did
pretend not to see my former
dormmate on the way out of the

theater (my eyes were red).
But here's the absolute truth"The
—"The Rescuers Down Under"
is a fantastic movie.
With the exception of "The
Little Mermaid," the past few
Disney films haven't been able to
really hold their own against the
classics. But this is different.
For those of you who aren't
familiar with The Rescuers, they
are a pair of mice — yes, mice —
who, as members of the Interna
tional Rescue Aid Society, travel
around the world to save chil
dren from evil adults.
This time, Miss Bianca and
Bernard head for Australia to
save Cody, a young boy, from Per
cival McLeach, a poacher. The
boy saved a golden eagle — a very
rare bird — from a trap and
became friends with her. And
now McLeach wants to know
where the nest is — and won't let

Cody go until he talks.
As always, Miss Bianca and
Bernard are transported to their
destination by an albatross; this
time it's Wilbur, Orville's (he was
their "airplane" in the first Res
cuers movie) brother. After all, as
the slogan of Albatross Airlines
says, "We're Born to Fly."
The voice of Wilbur is sup
plied by John Candy who creates
perhaps the funniest character in
the film. And there is plenty
funny about this film.
It has always been Disney's
talent to take a wonderful chil
dren's movie and to stock it full
of jokes and innuendos that only
adults would get — but without
ruining the movie for the chil
dren.
And from what I heard in the
theater around me, the children
enjoyed as much as I did.
Although, they weren't crying.
