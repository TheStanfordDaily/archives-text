# 'Home Alone' great for pre-teens

Home Alone
Macaulay Culkln, John Candy
Grade: C
In movies such as "The Break
fast Club," "Sixteen Candles" and
"Ferris Bueller's Day Off,"
writer/director John Hughes cast a
humorous yet discerning eye on
the teenage psyche, deftly convey
ing the emotional traumas of ado
lescence.
In his latest screenwriting effort,
however, Hughes leaves his teenage
wastelands behind, choosing
instead to explore the boundless
realms of the pre-adolescent mind.
The end result is "Home
Alone," a film which will send kids
into uncontrollable hysterics, but
will leave anyone over the age 12
pondering the loss of their nard
earned $6.50.
The premise of "Home Alone"
is every 8-year-old's dream, a
"Risky Business" for the pre-teen
set: Kevin McAllister (Macaulay

Culkin, who played John Candy's
inquisitive nephew in "Uncle
Buck"), the youngest of five chil
dren, is accidentally left behind
when his family leaves for Christ
mas vacation in Europe.
Left alone for the holidays in his
family's posh suburban house,
Kevin has a great time fending for
himself until two would-be cat bur
glars show up (Joe Pesci of "Lethal
Weapon II" and Daniel Stern, the
voice of Kevin in ABC's "The Won
der Years"). Determined to defend
his family's possessions, Kevin
transforms into a pre-pubescent
Rambo, setting various booby traps
to foil the attempts of his bumbling
foes to enter the house.
Sound like an interesting story
idea? For an ABC "After-School
Special," perhaps, but certainly not
for a two-hour motion picture:
director Chris Columbus ("Adven
tures in Babysitting") attempts to
compensate for the lack of plot by
focusing primarily on Kevin's one

kid war on the burglars.
Culkin, however, is not up to
the task of carrying the movie on
his own. In addition, his character
of Kevin is just too annovingly pre
cocious to have much appeal.
Furthermore, some of the booby
traps he meticulously constructs
are downright sadistic. While it's
clear that director Columbus
seems to be taking a cartoon-like
approach to the film's humorous
moments, it is nevertheless hard to
think of Kevin as cute after he glee
fully causes a grown man to get
swatted across the face by a hot
iron.
Still, despite the film's shaky
plot and insipid comedy, most of
the cast does a fine job with the
limited roles they are given, partic
ularly Pesci and Stern as the bur
glars. Indeed, one of the film's best
moments occurs when John Candy
makes a cameo appearance as a
polka player named Gus.
