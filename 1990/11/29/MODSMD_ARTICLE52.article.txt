This week we, Intermission's roving roman
tics, headed for THE HILLS!
Actually, we headed for Skywood Restaurant
& Bar, perched at the summit of the Foothills
on Skyline Drive. This great getaway offers
spectacular views and incredibly friendly ser
vice. And the food's pretty good too.
Just getting to Skywood is fun. The drive to
the restaurant takes you through the quaint
town of Woodside and the mansion-infested
Portola Valley.
If you reach the top of the mountain before
dinner time, we recommend that you take a
short excursion south on Skyline to get an
incomparable view of the Peninsula, the Bay

and our own beautiful campus. At sundown,
this vantage point affords a perfect view of the
sun's plunge into the Pacific.
And this view is what really sets Skywood
apart from other restaurants.
If you can — and you absolutely should try
— get a table by the window. That way you can
gaze out over a picturesque scene while you
dine. A small meadow surrounded by trees pro
vides a direct view of Hoover Tower and the
campus lights below.
And the food?
The Skywood menu offers a variety of
seafood and Italian cuisine. Unless you have a
mammoth appetite, you only need one appetiz
er between any couple. For that appetizer, we
recommend the Shrimp Bordelaise.
Skywood's salad and soup selection is pretty
standard, but the main menu offers a wide
choice of pasta, meat, chicken and seafood dish
es. The chef is very generous with prawns in the
Fettucini Skywood, and don't be timid if you

want more of the tasty sauce.
Skywood offers a unique atmosphere which
blends quiet mountain cabin "woodsiness" with
intimate dining. The elegance of tables illumi
nated by candlelight and tuxedo-clad servers
pleasantly contrasts with the rustic atmosphere
set by two roaring fires and the local art which
adorns the walls. This eclectic setting allows
you to be equally comfortable in casual or for
mal attire.
Bisher, the friendly manager and half-owner
of Skywood, encourages groups — such as
sororities, fraternities and dorms — to consider
holding formals or similar events at the restau
rant.

Skywood Restaurant and Bar is located at the
crossroads of Highway 84 and Skyline Drive
about 20 minutes up a windy, bicycle-infested,
scenic road. Skywood's phone number is 851-
7444.
