# Wreath spotlights rape
## 
### Minal Hajratwala Staff writer 
As the holiday season approaches, cel
ebratory wreaths are becoming a com
mon sight. But a more solemn wreath,
one that does not tell of joy, was hung in
White Plaza yesterday.
The Rape Education Project, which
put up the wreath, is asking students
who have experienced actual or
attempted sexual assault or know some
one who has to tie a yellow ribbon to the
wreath.
"We are trying to raise awareness of
sexual assault on campus, to show stu
dents it happens to people around them,
to people they know," said senior Sally
Bennett, a member of the group.
"A lot of people realize [sexual
assault] is a problem," said project mem
ber Andrea Torres, a senior. "But I don't
think people realize the full extent and
the prevalence of rape, whether stranger
or acquaintance."

"By making people on campus com
fortable discussing rape in the context of
the wreath, we are trying to alleviate
some of the stigma rape survivors expe
rience," said project member Michelle
Finkel, a senior. "We are trying to de
stigmatize the experience."
A 1988 survey conducted by project
members showed that 29 percent of
undergraduate women and 10 percent of
undergraduate men at Stanford have
experienced attempted or actual sexual
coercion, defined as full sexual activity
against their will.
Similar wreaths have been effective at
raising awareness at Yale and other uni
versities.
"I am just shocked at how quickly
[the wreath] has filled up," Finkel said.
"It has been up less than a day, and it
looks full already."
Yellow ribbons are traditionally used
in time of war to show solidarity for
those who are fighting, according
to Torres. "The yellow ribbons
represent solidarity with and sup
port for survivors of sexual
assault," she said.
The ribbons, donated by Menlo
Florist, are available in a box near
the wreath and at the Women's
Center. The wreath will be in
White Plaza into next week.
The Rape Education Project
began in the late 1970s to raise
awareness about "rape culture"
â€” the media images and misogy
nist language that contribute to
the prevalence of rape, according
to Finkel. The group facilitates
dorm presentations and sponsors
Rape Awareness Week each
spring.
