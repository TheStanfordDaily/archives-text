# 'Expert' says not to worry
## Quake won't hit Bay, he now predicts 
### Jill Sporleder Staff writer 
Seismologists aren't very shook up about
Iben Browning's earthquake predictions.
In July, Browning, a climatologist,
claimed there was an 87 percent probability
that either the San Francisco Bay Area,
Southern Missouri or Japan would suffer a
large earthquake on Monday, Dec. 3. Yester
day, however, Browning changed his predic
tion, eliminating the Bay Area from the
danger zone.
Browning had predicted the Bay Area
temblor would occur along the Hayward

fault, in the East Bay.
In a statement yesterday, Browning's
daughter, Evelyn Garriss, said Browning is
"less concerned about Hayward" but is "not
backing off about New Madrid," the fault in
Missouri.
Browning now says there is a 50 percent
chance that an earthquake will occur along
the New Madrid fault in Missouri late Sun
day or early Monday.
His forecasts are based on astronomical
calculations about the pressures the sun
and moon exert on the Earth's surface.
