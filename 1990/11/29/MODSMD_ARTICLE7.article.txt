# 'Expert' says not to worry
## Quake won't hit Bay, he now predicts 
### Jill Sporleder Staff writer 
Seismologists aren't very shook up about
Iben Browning's earthquake predictions.
In July, Browning, a climatologist,
claimed there was an 87 percent probability
that either the San Francisco Bay Area,
Southern Missouri or Japan would suffer a
large earthquake on Monday, Dec. 3. Yester
day, however, Browning changed his predic
tion, eliminating the Bay Area from the
danger zone.
Browning had predicted the Bay Area
temblor would occur along the Hayward

fault, in the East Bay.
In a statement yesterday, Browning's
daughter, Evelyn Garriss, said Browning is
"less concerned about Hayward" but is "not
backing off about New Madrid," the fault in
Missouri.
Browning now says there is a 50 percent
chance that an earthquake will occur along
the New Madrid fault in Missouri late Sun
day or early Monday.
His forecasts are based on astronomical
calculations about the pressures the sun
and moon exert on the Earth's surface.

50 percent chance that an earth
quake will occur along the New

Browning claims to have pre
dicted last October's Loma Prieta
earthquake, the Mexico City
earthquake of 1985 and the erup
tion of Mount St. Helens volcano,
as well as the downfall of commu
nist governments in Eastern
Europe.
But earthquake experts ques
tion both Browning's methods
and the amount of attention he is
receiving from the media and the
public.
Seismologist A 1 Lindh of the
United States Geological Survey
in Menlo Park said that because
Browning doesn't document his
evidence, he couldn't comment on
the predictions' scientific validity.

Tom McEvily, head of the
National Earthquake Prediction
Center and professor of seismol
ogy at UC-Berkeley, duplicated
the methods Browning claims to
use in a study of recent earth
quakes measuring 6.5 or higher
on the Richter scale. He found
that Browning's method pre
dicted earthquakes with the same
amount of accuracy that one
would get predicting them ran
domly.
The greatest level of accuracy
in prediction that scientists can
give using current technology is
in broad predictions, Lindh said.
"Scientists can say there is a
67 percent probability that the
Bay Area will suffer a quake
larger than 7.0 sometime in the
next 30 years, but that's the best
we can do," he said. "We can't pin
it down to a specific day."

A story in yesterday's Daily
incorrectly identified some indi
viduals who accompanied Asst.
Controller Janet Sweet to a
Christmas party several years ago
hosted by Paul Biddle, the campus
representative of the Office of
Naval Research. In an interview
for the story, Biddle said Sweet
was accompanied by "her folks."
Biddle was not referring to
Sweet's parents as the story indi
cated, but to members of her staff
in the controller's office.

For the record
