Lyme Disease
Lyme disease is a bacterial infection transmitted in
California by the bite of the Western Black-Legged tick. It
is named for Old Lyme, Connecticut, the location of the
first diagnosed cases in 1978.
Only 1-2% of Western Black-Legged ticks in California are
infected by the bacteria, as opposed to 60% of deer ticks,
the carrier in the northeast. Furthermore, the bacteria is not
transmitted to humans until after the tick has fed for several
hours. Most of the cases in California have been north of
the Bay Area.
Early symptoms include a rash 3-30 days after the
bite, with fever, aches, and fatigue. The rash, called
erythema migrans, starts at the site of the bite and slowly
expands in a circular red or pink pattern during the first
few weeks. It may be as large as 10-15 inches in diameter.
If the early disease is not treated, complications may affect
the heart, nervous system, and joints.
Early treatment with antibiotics is usually successful,
but is usually based only on the history and clinical
finidings. The blood test is not positive for several weeks.
For prevention, wear long pants and long sleeves in
"tick country" (grasses and brush in rural settings with
aftenoon shade). Check yourself for ticks after possible
exposure; remember the long feeding time required for
infection. Ticks should be pulled straight out with a tissue
or tweezers, grasping the tick as close to the mouthparts as
possible.
