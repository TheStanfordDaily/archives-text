# Students made sick
## Food Service's lasagna may be cause 
### Tahira Boyd 
Several students said they
became ill after eating lasagna at
Lagunita Dining Hall Monday
evening, but managers deny that
the incidents, currently under
investigation, are due to food poi
soning.
Approximately 10 students, all
of whom reside in East Lagunita
Court, experienced nausea, diar
rhea, headaches and vomiting
through early Wednesday.
Freshman Copely Kelly, an
Ujamaa resident, said she became
ill approximately six hours after
eating dinner. "I immediately
questioned the lasagna," believing
that her sickness was due to food
poisoning, she said.
Another Ujamaa resident,
freshman Kira Williams, became
nauseous close to the same time
Kelly did. "I felt like my food
never completely digested and my
stomach kept making gurgling
sounds" for almost 10 hours,
according to Williams.
Both students went to Cowell
Student Health Center, where
they were given an examination

and some medication. Cowell staff
who examined them and other
sick students concluded that the
students had gastroenteritis,
according to Cowell industrial
hygienist Steve Derman, who is
investigating the case.
But Susan Nunan, Lagunita
Dining Hall manager, said she
doubts that the students actually
experienced food poisoning. First,
she said all the lasagna was pre
pared at the same time by a cook
who has been working at Lagunita
for years. She also argued that
lasagna is too acidic to result in
food poisoning.
In addition, "usually 60 to 70
percent of the people eating the
same dish are affected by food poi
soning," Nunan said. "Basically, a
small number of Ujamaa residents
and an even smaller number of
Naranja residents became ill."
An investigation is currently
under way. The meat and vegetar
ian lasagna have been saved, along
with the blue cheese dressing, so
they can be tested.
"There is no evidence of food
poisoning at the moment,"
Derman said.
