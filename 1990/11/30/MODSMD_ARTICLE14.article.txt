Bulgaria premier steps down
SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) — Premier Andrei
Lukanov and his government of former
Communists resigned yesterday under unre
lenting pressure from strikes, street protests
and the halls of Parliament. Lukanov said his
successor will come from outside the party.
"This represents the true end to
Communism in Bulgaria," Petar Beron, leader

of the opposition Union of Democratic Forces, told The
Associated Press.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators, eagerly awaiting word
on Lukanov's resignation around the Grand National Assembly,
burst into cheers after hearing the news of the government's fall.
Police estimated the crowd at up to 70,000.
"Lukanov KGB spy" and "Down with Communists" chanted
the jubilant crowd, waving blue flags of the main opposition
alliance. Some uncorked champagne bottles.
Western food aid arrives at Moscow
MOSCOW (AP) — The first planeload of food from German
charities arrived yesterday evening to begin relieving Soviets
weary of the daily hunt for food on the poorly stocked shelves of
state stores.
Bleary-eyed shoppers trundled between empty metal food
cages at the Gastronom store across from the Kiev Railroad
Station.
Thirty people slumped dejectedly in line in a supermarket that
by 7 p.m. contained only lemonade, tiny red apples, five fancy
cakes, and a counter full of mix for home-brewed kvas, a type of
beer.
The line woke up when a clerk appeared with a shopping cart
containing unrecognizable cuts of mutton. Within moments, the
clerk was screaming.
"I'll just throw it out, and you can grab the one you want!"
she shouted, tossing plastic packages of bony meat at the crowd
and dashing back to sanctuary.
Yesterday's planeload of 25,000 pre-packaged meals from
German charities was being sent to children's hospitals and
orphanages, said Valeria Kuprina, deputy chairman of the
Moscow branch of the Soviet Children's Fund.
