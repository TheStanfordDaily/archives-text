NEW YORK (AP) - The Daily
News filed a $50 million civil rack
eteering lawsuit yesterday against
a group representing striking
workers and 23 drivers for
allegedly conspiring to force the
taÂ«ccept wasteful contracts
or to sell the paper to them.
The lawsuit asserted that the
unions had one of two intentions.
The News claimed they want to
coerce the tabloid into accepting a
featherbedding settlement that
contained abuses the News has
striven to eliminate in 10 months
of negotiations.
The News also claimed that
through violence the unions
hoped to implement a buyout plan
organized by Theodore Kheel, the
unions' unpaid legal adviser.
Kheel is not named in the law
suit. Named are the Newspaper

and Mail Deliverers' Union of
New York and Vicinity, the Allied
Printing Trades Council, the
umbrella group representing the
nine striking unions, and 23
drivers, some of whom have been
arrested during the course of the
strike.
Richard Weiss, a spokesman for
the Allied, said there would be no
comment until the unions had
seen the lawsuit.
"This lawsuit is a response to a
conspiracy of violence and intimi
dation that has victimized the
News, its dealers, advertisers and
readers since the strike began,''
said News Publisher James Hoge
in a statement given reporters.
"We intend to resist this cam
paign of violence and coercion
with every legal means at our dis
posal."
