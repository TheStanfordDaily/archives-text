### 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) -
The U.N. Security Council, led by
the United States, voted 12-2 yes
terday to authorize military
action to free Kuwait if Iraq does
not withdraw its occupying troops
and release all foreign hostages by
Jan. 15.
The only other time the coun
cil, created 45 years ago to iron
out international disputes, has
sanctioned force to counter
aggression was during the Korean
War.
China abstained, while Cuba
and Yemen cast dissenting votes
in a session arranged by the
United States in a show of inter
national solidarity against Iraq.
In an extradordinary meeting
of 13 foreign ministers, the coun
cil handed Iraqi President Sad
dam Hussein an ultimatum to

vacate the small oil-rich sheikdom
that his troops invaded Aug. 2, or
risk military conflict with U.S.-led
forces.
In Washington, President Bush
called the U.N. vote a very strong
and powerful message. "It will go
around the world loud and clear
that this guy's got to get out of
there.
"Once again, the United
Nations, exercising its proper
responsibility and its peacekeep
ing function, made a very power
ful statement. Everybody ought to
understand how strong it is and
how important it is," Bush said
minutes after the vote.
"Our aim today must be to con
vince Saddam Hussein that the
just, humane demands of the
Council and the international
community cannot be ignored,"

said Secretary of State James
Baker, top representative for the
United States as president of the
council.
"If Iraq does not reverse its
course peacefully, then other nec
essary measures, including the
use of force, should be autho
rized," said Baker. "We must put
the choice to Saddam Hussein in
unmistakable terms."
"If war is imposed upon us by
the United States, this will be our
destiny," said Iraqi Ambassador
Abdul Amir al-Anbari. "Our peo
ple will not kneel, we will rise to
this responsibility."
Baker at this juncture
appeared to glare at the Iraqi rep
resentative and flipped through a
copy of the U.N. Charter. British
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd
twirled his earphone. All the min

isters in session wore dark suits
and sat somberly around a circu
lar table in the vaulted council
chamber.
Kuwaiti Foreign Minister
Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber,
however, was not pacified, saying,
"The intransigence of the Iraqi
regime is pushing the region to a
conflagration which we do not
want, but which appears to be the
only avenue to restore our
rights."
The Kuwaiti representative
denounced the "wild beasts" from
Iraq whom he said were pillaging
his country and murdering his
people. "The Iraqi aggressor
showed no sense of mercy or com
passion, indeed, no respect for the
divine or human codes of con
duct."
