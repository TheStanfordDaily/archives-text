MOSCOW (AP) â€” President Mikhail Gorbachev
pronounced himself and other Communists "guilty
before the working class" in a candid admission of
blame yesterday for the country's worsening econo
my and political paralysis.
He told nearly 1,000 delegates to the 28th Moscow
City Communist Party Conference that the Soviet
Union faced increasing difficulties with food sup
plies, ethnic conflicts, crime and "a battle of laws
that has led to a paralysis of power."
"The reasons," Gorbachev said, were "errors in
the actions of central organs, above all in the Central
Committee of the Communist Party, and including
the actions of the general secretary and president."
Gorbachev, 59, is both the country's president
and general-secretary of the 18-million-member
party.
In his hour-long speech, he promised immediate
steps to increase food supplies, reiterated his deter
mination to hold the restive republics together, and
urged the delegates to keep the common man in
mind.
He said failure by the party leadership to address
workers' concerns was responsible for its defeat in
recent elections around the country.
"We are guilty before the working class, I think,
all of us, and I personally take responsibility," he
said.
