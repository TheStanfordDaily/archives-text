# ASSU senators debate their role
## Taking stands on national issues inappropriate, some say

The United Farm Workers grape boycott. The
murder of Central American Jesuit priests. The pos
sibility of a U.S. offensive in the Persian Gulf.
Over the past several years, the ASSU Senate has
debated bills on these and other national issues.
They won't be able to do that anymore, if a bill pro
posed at last night's senate meeting by graduate sen
ator John Overdeck passes.
The bill, which was eventually referred to com
mittee, proposed that the senate "confine its bills
and resolutions to University-related matters of an
academic, administrative, fiscal and social nature."
During the senate's "open forum" period, seniors
Tammy Kang and Marc Evans expressed their oppo
sition to the bill passed at the senate meeting two
weeks ago which opposed an unprovoked U.S. offen
sive in the Persian Gulf.
Kang and Evans said their opposition was based
not on the bill specifically, but on the senate's
attempt to represent student opinion on national
issues.
"It's not your job to pass policy in this body on
these issues," Evans chided.
The senate also passed a bill supporting greater
diversity on Stanford's faculty. The bill encouraged
students to attend next week's talk by Prof. Derrick
Bell, who is on a leave of absence from Harvard Law
School until it hires a female professor of color.
It also stated that the senate supports "increased
hiring and tenure of qualified faculty of color, women
faculty and other under-represented groups such as
those with varied physical abilities and sexual orien
tations."
According to graduate senator Darrell Brooks,

one of the bill's authors, Stanford has "very few" fac
ulty of color and faculty who are openly gay or les
bian. He also said that Stanford currently has no pol
icy seeking to remedy that situation.
Also, the Council of Presidents announced its
intention to create a "cultural celebration" in the
Quad during spring quarter to observe the Stanford
Centennial. The celebration would include various
theme houses on campus as well as the ASSU. the
Bechtel International Center and Hillel, a Jewish
student organization.
In other business, ASSU Financial Manager Tor
rence Boone, a senior, reported that while the Dow
Jones Industrial Average had recently dropped 15
percent, the ASSU's investments had only dropped
1.1 percent. "We're doing very well compared to the
general market," he said.
Boone also reminded the senate that Monday is
the last day students can turn in project ideas for a
new ASSU business and reported that 2,700 stu
dents applied for fee refunds during Fall Quarter.
But the unsettled debate over the senate's very
role encompassed the meeting's most heated
moments.
Some senators vocally advocated the senate's
right to pass bills such as the one referring to the
Gulf Crisis.
"I don't see why we're here if we can't take a posi
tion" on issues of national significance, said senator
Bill Candelaria, a junior.
Senator Leina Johansson, a senior, echoed this
sentiment. "We are elected to represent students,"
she said. "If it's a student issue, the students have to
take a stand on it."
But Overdeck vigorously defended the bill he
wrote with Evans, charging the
senate: "You're here to serve the
students. You're not here to pass
ineffectual resolutions."
Overdeck compared the sen
ate's Persian Gulf bill to former
U.S. Secretary of Education
William Bennett's opposition a
few years ago to the Cultures,
Ideas and Values requirement,
suggesting that both instances
were inappropriate.
He asserted a "groundswell of
support" among students for his
bill. He acknowledged that the
senate would likely defeat a bill
limiting its own abilities, but he
threatened to place it on the bal

lot of next spring's ASSU elec
tion.
The senate voted to send the
bill to the Administration and
Rules Committee, which will
meet next week to discuss it and
could bring it back to the senate
next quarter.
Several senators promised to
discuss the issue of the senate's
role with their constituents. Also,
Overdeck challenged senator
David Brown, a former COP
member who supports the sen
ate's right to vote on national pol
icy issues, to debate the issue "in
a public forum."
Some student leaders pointed
out that the political involvement
of the ASSU was an issue in last
spring's election. Senator Alison
Alter, a sophomore, said she ran
on a platform of depoliticizing the

ASSU.
Also, the ASSU Constitution/
Bylaw Reform Task Force sub
mitted a preliminary report on
bylaw election and finance
reform.
The following task force pro
posals will be among those
debated and voted on at the first
meeting of winter quarter Jan.
10:
• Write-in slates for the Coun
cil of Presidents race must be for
a declared slate or four ASSU
members;
• No campaign materials may
be posted in the Quad;
• Fee refunds will be available
starting the sixth, instead of the
third, week of the quarter; and
• Business projects shall be
under the direct supervision of
the Financial Manager.
