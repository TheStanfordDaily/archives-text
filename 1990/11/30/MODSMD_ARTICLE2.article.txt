# ASSU senators debate their role
## Taking stands on national issues inappropriate, some say

The United Farm Workers grape boycott. The
murder of Central American Jesuit priests. The pos
sibility of a U.S. offensive in the Persian Gulf.
Over the past several years, the ASSU Senate has
debated bills on these and other national issues.
They won't be able to do that anymore, if a bill pro
posed at last night's senate meeting by graduate sen
ator John Overdeck passes.
The bill, which was eventually referred to com
mittee, proposed that the senate "confine its bills
and resolutions to University-related matters of an
academic, administrative, fiscal and social nature."
During the senate's "open forum" period, seniors
Tammy Kang and Marc Evans expressed their oppo
sition to the bill passed at the senate meeting two
weeks ago which opposed an unprovoked U.S. offen
sive in the Persian Gulf.
Kang and Evans said their opposition was based
not on the bill specifically, but on the senate's
attempt to represent student opinion on national
issues.
"It's not your job to pass policy in this body on
these issues," Evans chided.
The senate also passed a bill supporting greater
diversity on Stanford's faculty. The bill encouraged
students to attend next week's talk by Prof. Derrick
Bell, who is on a leave of absence from Harvard Law
School until it hires a female professor of color.
It also stated that the senate supports "increased
hiring and tenure of qualified faculty of color, women
faculty and other under-represented groups such as
those with varied physical abilities and sexual orien
tations."
According to graduate senator Darrell Brooks,

one of the bill's authors, Stanford has "very few" fac
ulty of color and faculty who are openly gay or les
bian. He also said that Stanford currently has no pol
icy seeking to remedy that situation.
Also, the Council of Presidents announced its
intention to create a "cultural celebration" in the
Quad during spring quarter to observe the Stanford
Centennial. The celebration would include various
theme houses on campus as well as the ASSU. the
Bechtel International Center and Hillel, a Jewish
student organization.
In other business, ASSU Financial Manager Tor
rence Boone, a senior, reported that while the Dow
Jones Industrial Average had recently dropped 15
percent, the ASSU's investments had only dropped
1.1 percent. "We're doing very well compared to the
general market," he said.
Boone also reminded the senate that Monday is
the last day students can turn in project ideas for a
new ASSU business and reported that 2,700 stu
dents applied for fee refunds during Fall Quarter.
But the unsettled debate over the senate's very
role encompassed the meeting's most heated
moments.
Some senators vocally advocated the senate's
right to pass bills such as the one referring to the
Gulf Crisis.
"I don't see why we're here if we can't take a posi
tion" on issues of national significance, said senator
Bill Candelaria, a junior.
Senator Leina Johansson, a senior, echoed this
sentiment. "We are elected to represent students,"
she said. "If it's a student issue, the students have to
take a stand on it."
But Overdeck vigorously defended the bill he
