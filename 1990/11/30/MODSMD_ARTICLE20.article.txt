## 
### 
LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) — An Andean
summit that listed a common market and
anti-drug trafficking efforts at the top of
its agenda brought together the presi
dents of Venezuela, Colombia, Peru,
Ecuador and Bolivia yesterday.
President Bush's "initiative of the
Americas" to create a hemisphere-wide
zone for free trade within North and
South America will also be discussed dur
ing the two days of meetings that opened
yesterday.

President Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia
is host of the summit, attended by presi
dents Cesar Gaviria of Colombia, Carlos
Perez of Venezuela, Alberto Fujimori of
Peru and Rodrigo Boija of Ecuador.
"Our principal proposition during this
historical summit is the creation of a com
mon and free market in the region," Paz
Zamora said.
It is the fourth such summit since the
Andean pact came into being in 1988. La
Paz is 13,000 feet up in the Andean

mountains. The government has pro
vided emergency oxygen equipment
should visiting dignitaries be affected by
the rarefied air.
At a news conference shortly after
arriving here, Gaviria called for demo
cratic elections in Cuba.
"I would be pleased if Cuba became a
full member of the international commu
nity through the implementation in Cuba
of a democratic electoral system," Gaviria
said.

"We respect the self determination of
nations and in that sense we respect the
Cuban system, but I hope that they enter
a democratic electoral system."
The fight against cocaine trafficking in
the region is expected to be a prime topic
in the presidential talks. Peru and Bolivia
produce 80 percent of the coca leaf that
forms the basis of cocaine. Colombia is
the world's largest processor of cocaine.
Peru has rejected involving the mili
tary in the anti-drug battle. Bolivia has

agreed that the military can take part.
Regarding trade, plans are under way
to create a common Andean market by
1992, although Ecuador has opposed such
a plan.
Bolivia's planning minister, Enrique
Garcia, said, "The fundamental principle
for Andean integration has to be consis
tent with free market economic policies
that regional economies are on the road to
implementing. It is not possible to main
tain subsidies or protections of any type."
