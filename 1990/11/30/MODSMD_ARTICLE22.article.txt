Atypical Stanford dor
mitory usually houses some
combination of resident
assistants, focus assistants, advis
ing associates, theme associates
and resident computer coordina
tors, which, in laypeople's terms,
are RAs, FAs, AAs, TAs and RCCs.
To add to this string of endless
acronyms is a new proposal for
HAs — Health Associates, who
would live in dorms and provide
health care information and pro
gramming for fellow residents.
Given the already overflowing
programming schedules in dorms,
especially in theme houses, the via
bility of a new set of health pro
grams is questionable.
The project, designed by Dr.
Tien Wed Wiedmann of the Stan
ford Medical Center, would offer
courses on the scientific bases of
common health problems. Stu
dents could then take follow-up
training courses to qualify them

selves as health associates.
As it is currently conceived, the
program would seem to overlap
with the Health Advocates Pro
gram proposed by Cowell Student
Health Center. In addition, groups
like Food, Body Image and Self-
Esteem already present programs
addressing areas the health associ
ate program would cover. Many
resident assistants are already tak
ing advantage of these programs,
and should continue to do so.
In the meantime, efforts should
be directed to other facets of the
project, such as introducing similar
courses to local high schools. The
project provides a valuable oppor
tunity for premedical students to
participate in pre-professional
activities and deserves a chance for
growth.
However, scientific principles
underlying health problems may
just not be the stuff for dorm pro
gramming.
