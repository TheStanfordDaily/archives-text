Caffeine.
Virtually every student, gradu
ate and undergraduate, will con
suit ! unspeakable amounts of this
drug over the next week. And
b'' of its foolish Dead Week
poli y the University only has
itself to blame.
We've said it before and we'll say
it agahi: We need a better Dead
Wee,:. The one we currently have
often requires students to study for
finals while writing papers and tak
ing tests for overzealous profes
sors.
The need for a dramatically
improved Dead Week should be

apparent to all undergraduates
who have roamed the campus,
their eyes glazed over from lack of
sleep.
Granted, a certain number of
students are going to study at the
last minute. But presently, stu
dents are encouraged to cram to
finish Dead Week assignments and
prepare for finals simultaneously.
As a result of the present system,
undergraduates turn in half-baked
academic work and are discouraged
from actually learning their mate
rial.
The only people who don't seem
to be able to see the problem are
faculty and administrators.
In short, students are miserable
and administrators apathetic. And
the only people who could be happy
with the current state of affairs are
the Caffeine Growers of America.
