Women have their fair share of University housing

I AM WRITING TO CLARIFY SOME
housing assignment policies dis
cussed in a letter in the Nov. 15 Daily
titled "Fraternity housing is discrimina
tory against all women."
In her letter, Victoria Carreon stated
that "There are more housing spots
available to men than women on cam
pus." The implication in the letter is that
men have a better chance of being
assigned campus housing than women
because of the 440 spaces in fraternity
houses assigned specifically to them.
In reality, all student spaces in cam
pus housing (including the fraternity
spaces) are totaled and then allocated
according to the percentage of men and
women in the undergraduate student
population.
The current undergraduate popula
tion is approximately 56 percent men
and 44 percent women; the overall hous
ing allocation to students reflects this

In Draw-assigned housing, the overall ratio is closer to
50 percent men and 50 percent women to account for
the number of spaces in all-male fraternities.

ratio. However, because of the specific
assignment of spaces only to men in fra
ternity housing, there is a disproportion
ately larger share of spaces available to
women in Draw-assigned housing.
In other words, there is the same per
centage of undergraduate men and
women in campus housing as reflected in
the at-large student population, but in
Draw-assigned housing, the overall ratio
is closer to 50 percent men and 50 per
cent women to account for the number
of spaces in all-male fraternities.
In spite of the many concerns raised
in Carreon's letter about the fact that

only men are assigned to fraternities, the
one positive effect of this current policy
is the resulting balance of men and
women in many campus residences
assigned in the Draw. This would not be
the case otherwise, given the greater
numbers of men in the overall under
graduate student population.
It is also important to note that fra
ternities have quotas of spaces which
they have to fill with students (including
boarders) in order to fulfill their obliga
tions to guarantee campus housing to a
specific number of students and to retain
their campus housing privilege as a fra
ternity.

In effect, the current allocations of
Draw-assigned and fraternity housing do
not have any impact on the ability to
guarantee four years of housing to all
undergraduates, as Carreon suggests.
Rather, we simply need more total hous
ing spaces for undergraduates to fulfill a
four-year housing pledge.
We are in the process of building these
needed spaces on the Manzanita Park
site in order to be able to guarantee four
years of housing by the fall of 1992 to all
undergraduates who are willing to accept
a space anywhere on campus.
I hope this clarifies any misconcep
tions about assignment policies and equi
table housing allocations to undergradu
ate men and women which may have
resulted from some points in Carreon's
recent letter.
