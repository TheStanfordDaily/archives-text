To members of the Stanford commu
nity:
I invite you to share your ideas on the
future direction of athletics at Stanford.
Prior to the search for a new director
of at hi ' ■ , University President Donald
Kennedy formed an ad hoc committee on
athletics at Stanford to examine the
entin ;ithl<H ic program and make recom
mendations for its future. The 18-mem
ber committee consists of student-ath
letes, coaches, Athletics Department
admirr trntors, faculty, staff, alumni and
one trustee.
During the past few weeks, the com

mittee has met in small group sessions
with intercollegiate coaches, athletes,
representatives from Club Sports,
Recreation and Physical Education and
members of various support organiza
tions for Stanford athletics.
A paramount concern in our discus
sions has been how to continue to
embrace and sustain a broad-based ath
letic program and maintain financial
equilibrium.
As many of you are involved in the
myriad of sports and recreational oppor
tunities at Stanford — as participants, as
spectators and in the use of facilities —
your concerns about the Stanford athlet
ic program and recommendations for the
future are of critical importance to the
committee's work and will be part of the
final report to the president at the end of
this year.
I encourage you to write to me with
any comments or suggestions on

Stanford athletics at the Office of Public
Affairs, Stanford, CA 94305-2040, or call
me directly at 723-2862.
I look forward to hearing from you.
