# School of Education has improved its hiring practices
## 
### 
I understand I am often referred to as
a perennial cynic of the University's
affirmative action practices, so I would
like to try to change my image.
I congratulate the School of Education
for appointing an African-American to a
continuing (not fixed-term) professional

staff position. I cannot recall an African-
American eryoying this privilege in that
school over the last 20 years.
In addition, the school now has an
African-American in a tenured faculty
position — possibly only the second per
son holding such a position in the history
of the Education School, so congratula
tions are in order again.
True to form, however, I must say
more is to be expected from this school
than from the other six. And while I
have returned to form, I might as well
ask the question: If the University has
found it necessary to establish a policy in
the Administrative Guide prohibiting
sexual harassment in the workplace, why
can't it do so prohibiting racial harass
ment?
