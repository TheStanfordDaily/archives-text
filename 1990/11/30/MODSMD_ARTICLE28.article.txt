## No mo' Cookie Puss

JIM HENSON. JIM BAKKUS. Tom
Carvel. What do these three people
have in common? Yes, they each have
nine letters in their name (oooh, spooky),
but that's not the point.
The correct answer is that they are all
important cultural figures of my child
hood. And now they're dead.
At this point, a large, well-dressed
cricket appears on my shoulder, and I
immediately squish him with my pop-up
Richard Scarry Story Book (the things I
could tell you about the Lowly worm
page. ...), but not before he has time to
make me feel guilty about writing a
humor column about death.
"Joel, death is not funny. Mutilated
limbs, maybe. Facial deformities, possibly.
But death be not funny."
My recently deceased insect-friend had
ruined my fun. I put all my death jokes
back in the 'D' file. I couldn't even use the
one about having plenty of time to make
up for lost sleep. Nor the one about the
virtues of worm-massages. I couldn't
escape from the big, green stain on my
sweater; my intimations would have to be
post-Martinizing.
So I'm not writing about death, per se.
I'm writing about the death of an era. An
era represented by the warm voice of Ker
mit T. Frog, the stodgy intonation of Mr.
Howell and the phlegm-clogged larynx of
Tom Carvel.
When I went home for Thanksgiving, I
was confused and disoriented. I was
returning to a place where I had once
been someone else. I unpacked my suit
case in a room with Babar (Is that one 'b'
or two?) wallpaper and slept in a bed with
"Joannie Loves Chachi" sheets. And I

didn't know how to act.
During those four days, I did some
things that I now realize, in retrospect,
were somewhat silly. I wore my high
school class ring one day. I tried to fit into
my parachute pants. And I kept listening
to that damn Dexy's Midnight Runners
tape (c'mon Eileen, y'know what I mean).
I didn't realize how silly it all was until
the last day of vacation. I was sitting at
home, just recovering from a really
uproarious episode of Punky Brewster,
when The Song started.
"Just sit right back and you '11 hear a
tale. ..." I began to groove. I began to
move. I let the music be my soul.
"With Gilligan, the Skipper too. The
Millionaire. ..." And then I realized;
there were only five castaways left.
Epiphany: There would probably never
be another Gilligan's Island reunion. And
even if there were, it wouldn't be the
same. Who would The Globetrotters play?
Mrs. Howell couldn't stay in a whole
game without a sub.
I started to scream. I started to yell. I
started to sound like an a cappella Guns
and Roses album.
This wasn't about feeling old because
the television stars of my time were get
ting old. The Actual Escape Episode was
taped long before I realized that
Maryanne is more attractive than Ginger.
This was about moving on. A certain
stage of my life was over now, and I
couldn't try to return to it.
The Kermit-Howell-Fudgie the Whale
era had ended, only to be replaced with
the Simpson-Howser-Jackson era (Bart,
Doogie, and 80, respectively — which are
also commands you might give to your

dog).
The death of my one-time cultural
icons had served a purpose besides giving
me article fodder.
It reminded me how important it is to
appreciate life and enjoy the moment.
After all, one minute you're hiding under
neath a desk, throwing around sexual
banter in falsetto to a pig, and the next
minute — BOOM! You're as dead as the
whole Fraggle deal.
Not that it isn't good to remember the
past, and even sit down every so often to
scrape that cookie substance from the
middle of a Cookie Puss Ice Cream Cake.
It's just that I know that if you let
yourself stagnate, and keep yourself from
changing, you'll wind up mourning for
the good ol' days, sitting behind some
lonely bar with a bottle of gin, a couple of
greasy french fries and half a story about
the night after the junior prom as your
only companions. And not even Guy Smi
ley would let that happen.
Sure I miss what I had. But I'm not
going to let that stop me from having a
great time. Because I've changed. Five
hours a week of "One of These Things Is
Not Like The Other" just wouldn't cut it
anymore. Now I'm just as happy with five
hours of Physics for Poets.
Hey, the bell ain't tolling for me.

the last day of vacation. I was sitting at
home, just recovering from a really
uproarious episode of Punky Brewster,
when The Song started.
"Just sit right back and you '11 hear a
tale. ..." I began to groove. I began to
move. I let the music be my soul.
"With Gilligan, the Skipper too. The
Millionaire. ..." And then I realized;
there were only five castaways left.
Epiphany: There would probably never
be another Gilligan's Island reunion. And
even if there were, it wouldn't be the
same. Who would The Globetrotters play?
Mrs. Howell couldn't stay in a whole
game without a sub.
I started to scream. I started to yell. I
started to sound like an a cappella Guns
and Roses album.
This wasn't about feeling old because
the television stars of my time were get
ting old. The Actual Escape Episode was
taped long before I realized that
Maryanne is more attractive than Ginger.
This was about moving on. A certain
stage of my life was over now, and I
couldn't try to return to it.
The Kermit-Howell-Fudgie the Whale
era had ended, only to be replaced with
the Simpson-Howser-Jackson era (Bart,
Doogie, and 80, respectively — which are
also commands you might give to your

dog).
The death of my one-time cultural
icons had served a purpose besides giving
me article fodder.
It reminded me how important it is to
appreciate life and enjoy the moment.
After all, one minute you're hiding under
neath a desk, throwing around sexual
banter in falsetto to a pig, and the next
minute — BOOM! You're as dead as the
whole Fraggle deal.
Not that it isn't good to remember the
past, and even sit down every so often to
scrape that cookie substance from the
middle of a Cookie Puss Ice Cream Cake.
It's just that I know that if you let
yourself stagnate, and keep yourself from
changing, you'll wind up mourning for
the good ol' days, sitting behind some
lonely bar with a bottle of gin, a couple of
greasy french fries and half a story about
the night after the junior prom as your
only companions. And not even Guy Smi
ley would let that happen.
Sure I miss what I had. But I'm not
going to let that stop me from having a
great time. Because I've changed. Five
hours a week of "One of These Things Is
Not Like The Other" just wouldn't cut it
anymore. Now I'm just as happy with five
hours of Physics for Poets.
Hey, the bell ain't tolling for me.

JIM HENSON. JIM BAKKUS. Tom
Carvel. What do these three people
have in common? Yes, they each have
nine letters in their name (oooh, spooky),
but that's not the point.
The correct answer is that they are all
important cultural figures of my child
hood. And now they're dead.
At this point, a large, well-dressed
cricket appears on my shoulder, and I
immediately squish him with my pop-up
Richard Scarry Story Book (the things I
could tell you about the Lowly worm
page. ...), but not before he has time to
make me feel guilty about writing a
humor column about death.
"Joel, death is not funny. Mutilated
limbs, maybe. Facial deformities, possibly.
But death be not funny."
My recently deceased insect-friend had
ruined my fun. I put all my death jokes
back in the 'D' file. I couldn't even use the
one about having plenty of time to make
up for lost sleep. Nor the one about the
virtues of worm-massages. I couldn't
escape from the big, green stain on my
sweater; my intimations would have to be
post-Martinizing.
So I'm not writing about death, per se.
I'm writing about the death of an era. An
era represented by the warm voice of Ker
mit T. Frog, the stodgy intonation of Mr.
Howell and the phlegm-clogged larynx of
Tom Carvel.
When I went home for Thanksgiving, I
was confused and disoriented. I was
returning to a place where I had once
been someone else. I unpacked my suit
case in a room with Babar (Is that one 'b'
or two?) wallpaper and slept in a bed with
"Joannie Loves Chachi" sheets. And I

didn't know how to act.
During those four days, I did some
things that I now realize, in retrospect,
were somewhat silly. I wore my high
school class ring one day. I tried to fit into
my parachute pants. And I kept listening
to that damn Dexy's Midnight Runners
tape (c'mon Eileen, y'know what I mean).
I didn't realize how silly it all was until
the last day of vacation. I was sitting at
home, just recovering from a really
uproarious episode of Punky Brewster,
when The Song started.
