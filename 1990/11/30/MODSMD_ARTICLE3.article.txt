# Students won't alter drinking, poll shows
## 
### John Louie Editorial staff 
Although only 37 percent of
Stanford students support the
new University alcohol and drug
policy, 73 percent said that the
new policy would minimally affect
their behavior, a Daily poll has
found.
Undergraduates disagreed
with the alcohol and drug policy
overwhelmingly, with 57 percent
in opposition. Only 31 percent of
the graduate respondents dis
agreed with the policy.
In addition, a strong mtyority
of respondents agreed with the
University policy on domestic
partners that affords married stu
dent benefits — including married
housing — to unmarried couples
if they have a commitment that is
similar to marriage.
54 percent of students under

21 years of age disagreed with the
alcohol and drug policy, but 41
percent of students 21 years old
and older agreed with the policy.
However, when asked how
much this policy would affect
their behavior on a scale of one to
five, with one being "not at all"
and five being "very much,"
almost half of the students under
21 years of age replied "not at all."
The policy, which allows Stan
ford to punish illegal drug users
and underage drinkers under the
Fundamental Standard and Resi
dence Agreement, was established
earlier this year in order to com
ply with the federal Drug-Free
Schools and Communities Act.
Before the questions were asked,
polled students were given a brief
explanation of the new policy.
Of the 204 undergraduates
polled, 117 disagreed with the pol
icy, 59 agreed with the policy, and
28 said they had no opinion on the
policy or didn't know enough
about the policy guidelines. Of the
160 students under 21 who
replied, 87 disagreed with the pol
icy and 47 agreed.
More than half of the under
graduates polled said that the
alcohol policy would not affect
their behavior. Of the 160 stu
dents under 21 who replied, 79
said their behavior would be unaf
fected by the policy.
Almost 60 percent of the stu
dents polled agreed with the
domestic partners policy adopted

by Stanford last month.
A gender breakdown showed
than women were more likely to
support the domestic partners
policy than men, with 56 percent
of men and 65 percent of women
in agreement with the policy.
Graduate students agreed with
the policy by an almost 3-1 mar
gin, with 143 of the 219 students
polled agreeing with the policy
and only 47 disagreeing. Under
graduate students agreed with the
domestic partners policy by only a
2-1 margin, with 109 of the 204
students in support of the policy
and 57 students in opposition.
The Daily polled 423 students
Tuesday and Wednesday evenings
on the proposed distribution
requirements, the alcohol policy
and the domestic partners policy.
Results of the distribution

requirements questions were
printed in yesterday's Daily.
Every 10th student in the
Stanford Directory was chosen to
participate in the poll. About 52
percent of the respondents were
graduate students, and about 57
percent were male. About 38 per
cent of the respondents were
under 21 years of age.
The margin of error was 5 per
cent over the entire sample, 6 per
cent over the graduate population
and 7 percent among only the
undergraduate population. The
margin of error was 8 percent for
students under 21 years of age.
