# Students won't alter drinking, poll shows
## 
### John Louie Editorial staff 
Although only 37 percent of
Stanford students support the
new University alcohol and drug
policy, 73 percent said that the
new policy would minimally affect
their behavior, a Daily poll has
found.
Undergraduates disagreed
with the alcohol and drug policy
overwhelmingly, with 57 percent
in opposition. Only 31 percent of
the graduate respondents dis
agreed with the policy.
In addition, a strong mtyority
of respondents agreed with the
University policy on domestic
partners that affords married stu
dent benefits — including married
housing — to unmarried couples
if they have a commitment that is
similar to marriage.
54 percent of students under

21 years of age disagreed with the
alcohol and drug policy, but 41
percent of students 21 years old
and older agreed with the policy.
However, when asked how
much this policy would affect
their behavior on a scale of one to
five, with one being "not at all"
and five being "very much,"
almost half of the students under
21 years of age replied "not at all."
The policy, which allows Stan
ford to punish illegal drug users
and underage drinkers under the
Fundamental Standard and Resi
dence Agreement, was established
earlier this year in order to com
ply with the federal Drug-Free
Schools and Communities Act.
Before the questions were asked,
polled students were given a brief
explanation of the new policy.
