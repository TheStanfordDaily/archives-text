## David Chan Isolationists ignore the importance of U.S. influence in the world 
### 
I have a neighbor who is a big bully.
One day, he forces his way into my home,
beats me up, helps himself to my property
and then abducts me. I manage to call the
police, but they cannot agree among
themselves on what to do to rescue me,
except to call on everyone not to do any
business with my neighbor until he
releases me.
Meanwhile, my abductor is dismem
bering me piece by piece, and I am in
great agony. I do not think I can survive
until he gets tired of being ignored by
everybody.
I have a friend who is a bodybuilder, a
really tough guy. I call on him for help.
However, he only responds by doing exer
cises in front of my abductor's house, hop
ing to impress him into releasing me. In
the meantime, he has second thoughts
about rescuing me.
He wonders if it is worth getting him
self hurt. He rationalizes that I wasn't
such a nice fellow after all. And he tells
himself that since I am related to my
neighbor, it is really a family affair that
he has no right to intervene in.
My name is Kuwait. The friend I
thought I had is named the United States.
THIS POLITICAL ALLEGORY
sums up my view of the Persian
Gulf situation. Of course, no one
has the right to demand that his friends

risk getting hurt to help him. But the one
who does not take risks to help a friend in
trouble does not deserve the respect of
others.
The real issue in the debate over U.S.
involvement in the Persian Gulf concerns
the U.S. role in world affairs. Is this coun
try willing to pay the price to have an
influence over events that happen outside
its boundaries? If the United States can
not back up its friends when they are in

trouble, why should anyone care what it
thinks?
I believe an isolationist United States
is inconsistent with the aims of those who
see this country as a force for the protec
tion of human rights and the environ
ment of the world. For if no one cares
about U.S. public opinion, then Green
peace, Asiawatch, Africa watch and other
such organizations based in the United
States will also lose their influence in the

rest of the world.
It is because other countries want the
United States for their friend that they
care about what U.S. citizens think of
their governments and their policies. If
this country wants to sit on the sidelines
like the little nations of the world, mind
ing its own business, so be it. But take
note that nobody pays much attention to
what those little countries think about
what they do.
I also find a Eurocentrism of the worst
kind in the attitude of the anti-war move
ment in the West. It seems that the only
war that matters to them is the Cold War
between the superpowers, and the only
disarmament that they care about is in
Europe. Since the end of World War 11,
only North America and Europe have
been in peace, while wars have continued
to ravage the rest of the world.
If Third World countries do not think
they can rely on the United Nations or
their friends to help protect them from
aggression, then logically they will have
to arm themselves to the teeth for their
own self-defense.
The non-intervention of the West in
the face of naked aggression such as
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait is thus a recipe
for continuing and escalating the arms
race in the Third World, diverting
resources much needed for fighting
poverty, famine and disease.

I am tired of the simplistic arguments
presented in favor of a U.S. withdrawal
from the Gulf. The fact that U.S. service
men may lose their lives is an argument
against any war. It could have been used
to argue against the involvement of this
country in World War 11. It obscures the
distinction between justified and unjusti
fied wars. For the first time in 40 years,
U.S. troops can do some good in the
world. If not now, then never!
The only other argument presented is
just as silly. It is claims that Kuwait was
not a democracy and thus does not
deserve help. Does anyone seriously
believe that Kuwaitis are better off under
Saddam Hussein than they were under
the Kuwaiti royal family? What better
chance is there for U.S. citizens to influ
ence the democratization of Kuwait than
if they have just liberated it?
My parents, who grew up in China dur
ing the World War 11, brought me up to
believe two things: that the United States
always does what is right and that the
United States always helps those in need.
I have long given up the first belief, which
is naive and false. Perhaps I should give
up the second as well.
Shame on you, United States!
