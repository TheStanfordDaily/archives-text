# Commies in health care?

The Daily Palo Alto
The Student Affairs Commit
tee announced that "after this
date, [weekdays] must be kept
free from all student social func
tions, formal or informal...
The committee reached this
decision in order to promote
"health and scholarship" with
"health . . . probably the more sig
nificant of the two." The great
hope of the committee was that
"this regulation will leave four
nights a week absolutely free for
study."
Notice how health is consid
ered more important than schol
arship? It's all right if you flunk
as long as you 're still alive to pay
next quarter's tuition bill.
However, I fail to see how stay
ing in on weeknights to study is
considered healthful. On the con
trary — you would be more sub
ject to red-eye, nervous ticks,
paper-cut fingers and other mal
adies associated with learning.
On the other hand, though, you
might as well do your problem sets
since you've lost the joy that comes
from watching "Cop Rock."

In a story entitled, "Students
Honest Injuns," The Daily
reported that no one had stolen
the courtesy money at the tele
graph office in the Union. The
branch manager, Paul Brewer,
said, "Stanford University has the
most honest group of students
that I have ever seen. No one ever
steals ... those five nickels."
Brewer said that people send
telegrams for many reasons, but
he had noticed at Stanford that
many "students often rush to
send a wire saying they had
passed an examination that they
thought they failed."
Wow! I am just so impressed.
No one stole 25 cents. And that
bought a lot more 50 years ago
than it does now.

For example, that could buy
you a few gallons of gasoline.
Really. It really could.
Yet 1 can't believe that Stan
ford students sent telegrams
about their finals. I mean, I
believe that they sent word that
they had done well on finals, but
who would be stupid enough to
tell their parents that they blew
chunks on a test.

The Stanford Daily
A letter to the editor stated
that "the American people have
lately become conscious of the dire
threat presented by communists
abroad, but few have come to real
ize the graver menace presented
by communism and socialism at
home. . . . The Stanford Public
Health Service [is] a socialistic
outfit."
The letter writer explained
that everybody had to pay the
same amount each quarter
"regardless of race, color, creed, or
status, be they black or white,
Catholic, Protestant or Christian
Scientist," and even people who
never utilized their services had to
pay.
The Russians are coming! The
Russians are coming! It even
appears that communist plants
are still doing their devious work
at Cowell.
Since everyone knows that a

Cowell is slow, and its
service sucks. Cowell
must be communist.

communist system is notoriously
inefficient and provides low qual
ity products — and Cowell is slow,
and its service sucks, then Cowell
must be communist.
Just kidding. Thanks to the
Cowell nurses who put my finger
back together after I almost sliced
it off with a bagel knife. By the
way, it fell off again this week.
Should I use Krazy Glue again or
try thumbtacks ?

A University study revealed
that the average grade at Stanford
was 3.4 — a little over a B+. Also,
"in general, students in classes
with higher technical content
receive lower grades" than those
in humanities classes.
However, the highest GPA was
reported among natural sciences
majors, which was attributed to
the "pre-med syndrome," the
drive for good grades for medical
school.
Reasons for the disparity in
grades ranged from smaller
classes in humanities courses to
the fact that "humanities exams
are targeted toward comprehen
sion in a larger framework on a
more abstract basis than exams in
the sciences."
Come on. Let's face it. We all
know the real reason why techies
get lower grades. THEY'RE
DUMBER!!!
Gimme a break. Anybody can
do mutual recursion or quantum
electrodynamics, but let's see
someone extract all the symbolism
from"The Metamorphosis."
By the way, if the average
grade at Stanford is a B+, at least
I can say my grades aren't aver
age. That's about all I can say,
especially with my mother read
ing this.

must be communist.

communist system is notoriously
inefficient and provides low qual
ity products — and Cowell is slow,
and its service sucks, then Cowell
must be communist.
Just kidding. Thanks to the
Cowell nurses who put my finger
back together after I almost sliced
it off with a bagel knife. By the
way, it fell off again this week.
Should I use Krazy Glue again or
try thumbtacks ?

The Stanford Daily
A University study revealed
that the average grade at Stanford
was 3.4 — a little over a B+. Also,
"in general, students in classes
with higher technical content
receive lower grades" than those
in humanities classes.
However, the highest GPA was
reported among natural sciences
majors, which was attributed to
the "pre-med syndrome," the
drive for good grades for medical
school.
Reasons for the disparity in
grades ranged from smaller
classes in humanities courses to
the fact that "humanities exams
are targeted toward comprehen
sion in a larger framework on a
more abstract basis than exams in
the sciences."
Come on. Let's face it. We all
know the real reason why techies
get lower grades. THEY'RE
DUMBER!!!
Gimme a break. Anybody can
do mutual recursion or quantum
electrodynamics, but let's see
someone extract all the symbolism
from"The Metamorphosis."
By the way, if the average
grade at Stanford is a B+, at least
I can say my grades aren't aver
age. That's about all I can say,
especially with my mother read
ing this.

Nov. 30,1909
The Daily Palo Alto
The Student Affairs Commit
tee announced that "after this
date, [weekdays] must be kept
free from all student social func
tions, formal or informal...
The committee reached this
decision in order to promote
"health and scholarship" with
"health . . . probably the more sig
nificant of the two." The great
hope of the committee was that
"this regulation will leave four
nights a week absolutely free for
study."
Notice how health is consid
ered more important than schol
arship? It's all right if you flunk
as long as you 're still alive to pay
next quarter's tuition bill.
However, I fail to see how stay
ing in on weeknights to study is
considered healthful. On the con
trary — you would be more sub
ject to red-eye, nervous ticks,
paper-cut fingers and other mal
adies associated with learning.
On the other hand, though, you
might as well do your problem sets
since you've lost the joy that comes
from watching "Cop Rock."
Nov. 29, 1937
The Stanford Daily
In a story entitled, "Students
Honest Injuns," The Daily
reported that no one had stolen
the courtesy money at the tele
graph office in the Union. The
branch manager, Paul Brewer,
said, "Stanford University has the
most honest group of students
that I have ever seen. No one ever
steals ... those five nickels."
Brewer said that people send
telegrams for many reasons, but
he had noticed at Stanford that
many "students often rush to
send a wire saying they had
passed an examination that they
thought they failed."
Wow! I am just so impressed.
No one stole 25 cents. And that
bought a lot more 50 years ago
than it does now.

For example, that could buy
you a few gallons of gasoline.
Really. It really could.
Yet 1 can't believe that Stan
ford students sent telegrams
about their finals. I mean, I
believe that they sent word that
they had done well on finals, but
who would be stupid enough to
tell their parents that they blew
chunks on a test.

Nov. 29, 1950
The Stanford Daily
A letter to the editor stated
that "the American people have
lately become conscious of the dire
threat presented by communists
abroad, but few have come to real
ize the graver menace presented
by communism and socialism at
home. . . . The Stanford Public
Health Service [is] a socialistic
outfit."
The letter writer explained
that everybody had to pay the
same amount each quarter
"regardless of race, color, creed, or
status, be they black or white,
Catholic, Protestant or Christian
Scientist," and even people who
never utilized their services had to
pay.
The Russians are coming! The
Russians are coming! It even
appears that communist plants
are still doing their devious work
at Cowell.
Since everyone knows that a

Cowell is slow, and its
service sucks. Cowell
must be communist.
