# Bug checks into El Camino motels
## 
### Amy Gillett Staff Writer 
Dear Bug,
Why are there so many motels on El Camino?
Who stays at them ?
— Innocently Curious
Dear 1.C.,
Business people of all types utilize the
rooms of El Camino's luxurious motor inns
and motels. There are a lot of businesses in the
area, many of which aren't illustrious enough
to put their clients up in full-fledged hotels.
The sagging businesses turn to the motels as
economical refuges for their out-of-town asso
ciates.
"But why do certain El Camino motel
rooms feature racy red bulbs?" you may ask.
Do business people really require red rooms?
According to "Randy," a long-time Palo Alto
resident, some of these rooms are the sites of
illegal business transactions. He says that one
of the oldest professions in the world is carried
on behind many an innocent-looking motel
sign.
Just how tawdry are these places? I tar
geted two motels for my investigation. The
Glass Slipper Inn, innocently shaped like Cin
derella's palace, advertises in the yellow pages
as featuring Color Televisions and Compli
mentary Coffee.
Do they also feature the Magic Fingers, a
popular intramattress massage system? Do
they rent rooms by the hour? I wondered.
"No" and "Oh No!!" were the answers I
received from the receptionist of the inn.
"Do you hold business conferences?" I
asked.
"No. We don't do that sort of thing. Our
rooms are too small for it," answered the rep
resentative of the fairy tale palace.
"Do you mean the bedrooms aren't big

enough or that the common rooms around the
lobby aren't big enough?" I persisted.
"Yes," replied the cryptic receptionist.
Next I phoned the Co-Z 8 Motel, whose ad
in the phone book features a blob of heads
framed by a festive heart. A very refined Cupid
takes aim at the hazy body mass. Surely the
CO-Z 8, with its "seven locations to serve you'
would live up to its ad.

"Do you rent by the hour?" I asked.
"No," I was informed, "you pay for a full
day even if you only sleep for two hours."
"And do you have Magic Fingers?" I asked.
"What's that?" the receptionist wanted to
know. A true disappointment!
So, although some of the motels on El
Camino may house questionable activities and
emit strange red lights, the real nature of
motel affairs remains nebulous.
Dear Bug:
What is the correct way to refer to the sister
of one's grandmother? Most people seem to
call her their great aunt, but this doesn't quite
make sense to me. After all, if she's your
grandmother's sister, shouldn't she be called
you grand aunt? And what about your great
grandmother's sister ? Is she your great-great
aunt or your great grand aunt ?
— Alex C.

Dear Alex,
Your question is truly in the Holiday Spirit.
At this time of year, we find ourselves seated
around fossilized relatives who undoubtedly
deserve grand names, or great names at the
very least.
Your confusion over the issue stems from
your misunderstanding of the "grand" portion
of grandmother and grandfather. Grand
mother and grandfather are inviolable enti
ties, just like mother and father.
Trying to split them up for analysis would
be equivalent to taking the mot and fat out of
mother and father. It's simply not advisable.
Grand remains bound to grandmother and
grandfather, and may not be applied to other
relations.
Great, on the other hand, can be thrown
around freely If you are not clear who rela
tives are, and they are over 80, they can safely
be termed great aunts.
Discretion is advisable, however, as many
elderly male relations will resent being
referred to as "great aunt." For every 20-year
increment over 80, tag on another great.
(Sample usage: Great Great Great Aunt Mae
once bartered her gold pieces for a slab of mut
ton.)
If relatives are of Russian descent, you have
the option of tagging the great on at the end of
their names, as in Aunt Catherine the Great
and Uncle Alexander the Great.

Got papers to write, finals to take, planes to
catch? Well, put your priorities in order — cast
them all aside and write a letter to the BUG at
b.bug@macbeth! Use the holiday break to pon
der all those questions you haven't had time
for during the quarter and send them to BUG,

to put their clients up in full-fledged hotels.
The sagging businesses turn to the motels as
economical refuges for their out-of-town asso
ciates.
"But why do certain El Camino motel
rooms feature racy red bulbs?" you may ask.
Do business people really require red rooms?
According to "Randy," a long-time Palo Alto
resident, some of these rooms are the sites of
illegal business transactions. He says that one
of the oldest professions in the world is carried
on behind many an innocent-looking motel
sign.
Just how tawdry are these places? I tar
geted two motels for my investigation. The
Glass Slipper Inn, innocently shaped like Cin
derella's palace, advertises in the yellow pages
as featuring Color Televisions and Compli
mentary Coffee.
Do they also feature the Magic Fingers, a
popular intramattress massage system? Do
they rent rooms by the hour? I wondered.
"No" and "Oh No!!" were the answers I
received from the receptionist of the inn.
"Do you hold business conferences?" I
asked.
"No. We don't do that sort of thing. Our
rooms are too small for it," answered the rep
resentative of the fairy tale palace.
"Do you mean the bedrooms aren't big

enough or that the common rooms around the
lobby aren't big enough?" I persisted.
"Yes," replied the cryptic receptionist.
Next I phoned the Co-Z 8 Motel, whose ad
in the phone book features a blob of heads
framed by a festive heart. A very refined Cupid
takes aim at the hazy body mass. Surely the
CO-Z 8, with its "seven locations to serve you'
would live up to its ad.

"Do you rent by the hour?" I asked.
"No," I was informed, "you pay for a full
day even if you only sleep for two hours."
"And do you have Magic Fingers?" I asked.
"What's that?" the receptionist wanted to
know. A true disappointment!
So, although some of the motels on El
Camino may house questionable activities and
emit strange red lights, the real nature of
motel affairs remains nebulous.
Dear Bug:
What is the correct way to refer to the sister
of one's grandmother? Most people seem to
call her their great aunt, but this doesn't quite
make sense to me. After all, if she's your
grandmother's sister, shouldn't she be called
you grand aunt? And what about your great
grandmother's sister ? Is she your great-great
aunt or your great grand aunt ?
— Alex C.

Dear Alex,
Your question is truly in the Holiday Spirit.
At this time of year, we find ourselves seated
around fossilized relatives who undoubtedly
deserve grand names, or great names at the
very least.
Your confusion over the issue stems from
your misunderstanding of the "grand" portion
of grandmother and grandfather. Grand
mother and grandfather are inviolable enti
ties, just like mother and father.
Trying to split them up for analysis would
be equivalent to taking the mot and fat out of
mother and father. It's simply not advisable.
Grand remains bound to grandmother and
grandfather, and may not be applied to other
relations.
Great, on the other hand, can be thrown
around freely If you are not clear who rela
tives are, and they are over 80, they can safely
be termed great aunts.
Discretion is advisable, however, as many
elderly male relations will resent being
referred to as "great aunt." For every 20-year
increment over 80, tag on another great.
(Sample usage: Great Great Great Aunt Mae
once bartered her gold pieces for a slab of mut
ton.)
If relatives are of Russian descent, you have
the option of tagging the great on at the end of
their names, as in Aunt Catherine the Great
and Uncle Alexander the Great.

Got papers to write, finals to take, planes to
catch? Well, put your priorities in order — cast
them all aside and write a letter to the BUG at
b.bug@macbeth! Use the holiday break to pon
der all those questions you haven't had time
for during the quarter and send them to BUG,
P.O. Box 6597, Stanford.
