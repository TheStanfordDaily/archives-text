## Cardinal spikers blow Cowgirls out of Burnham Demons beware: the Card cometh 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer Harold Yu Staff writer 
If you're keeping score at
home, call it one demon down and
two to go.
Last night, the women's volley
ball team avenged last year's sea
son-ending defeat to Wyoming —
and did so in impressive fashion.
One might reasonably argue that
the Cardinal is the best team in
the nation right now.
For Stanford to prove it,
though, they'll have to exorcise
those other two demons. The first
will likely confront them a week
from Saturday when they should
meet UCLA in the West Regional
final. (That matchup only takes
place if both teams win their
regional semifinals, of course.)
The Cardinal's problem is they
haven't beaten the Bruins in Los
Angeles in quite a while. A confi
dent coach Don Shaw says,
"That's ancient history." And he
may be right. Stanford scored an
apparent match point when the
teams met at Pauley Pavilion in
October. While the ball was called
out — and Stanford subsequently
was defeated by UCLA that night
— it did establish the Cardinal's
ability to get the game-winner in
Southern California.
From the confidence they
exuded on the court last night, it's
clear the team believes its nearly a
shoo-in against the Bruins this
time around. "It doesn't matter
who's on the other side of the net.
It doesn't matter where we play
'em. It doesn't matter when we
play 'em," Shaw says.
It's equally apparent they've
put the debacle that was last sea
son behind them. "We're a very
different team," Shaw notes.
"[The players] took what was a
very frustrating and disappoint
ing year and used it as an educa
tional experience."

According to Stanford coach
Don Shaw, volleyball is a very sim
ple game.
Last night, the No. 3 Cardinal
(26-3) showed exactly what he
meant. Stanford provided a brief
one hour seminar in the basics:
passing, setting and hitting their
way into the second round of the
NCAA tournament.
Before a sell-out Burnham
Pavilion crowd, the Cardinal
blitzed unranked Wyoming (19-
10) in its final home match of the
season, 15-4, 15-5, 15-8.
"Anything could have hap
pened," Wyoming coach Mike
English said. "But Stanford play
ed very well. They did a nice job of
executing. We didn't get into
sync."
The Cowgirls, in fact, failed to
tally a point until down 7-0 in the
first game. Stanford outscored
English's squad 45-17 in a match
that was decided at the onset.
Aggressive Cardinal serving
caused a host of problems for
Wyoming. Their passers made
sure that setter Kim Smith had a
thorough workout, misplaying
balls all over the court for her.
Wyoming muffed point one, over
passed the ball to surrender point
two and watch an attack come
back in their faces for point three.
Pacific 10 Conference Player of
the Year Bev Oden smashed five
early kills to prop Stanford ahead
10-1 in the first game. But Oden
showed National Player of the
Year form in amassing a match
high 14 kills and hitting .480.
"Bev is a tremendous player,"
English said. "She's one of the
country's best."
At times during the game, it
looked as if Shaw would be able to
clear his bench. The Cardinal had
its way with its overmatched
counterpart. Standout setter Car
rie Feldman was able to drop over
an easy dump kill. Senior Jessica
Benton and junior Amy Cooper
kick-started the middle attack
with three kills between them.
The Cowgirls sealed their own
fate, double-hitting a ball and

making an attack error on the
game's final points. "I think we
could have executed better," Shaw
said. "But Wyoming could have
played better too. They weren't
passing the brll. They were
shanking the ball all over the
place."

Stanford didn't squander the
favor. All-Pac-10 selection Kristin
Klein led another 4-0 surge in the
second game with two kills. Ben
ton scorched the ball cross court
for two more kills and helped
Oden roof another attack. Benton
had nine kills and hit .571 in the
match.
Benton and Oden dismantled
the Wyoming offense as the tan
dem together collected six blocks.
Feldman joined in on the fun, solo
blocking a Wyoming attacker at 4-
0.
The Cardinal defense kept the
Cowgirls at a .141 hitting percent
age and allowed Dailene Glenn,
their best hitter, only three kills
and a .071 mark.
"I knew Stanford would be bet
ter in some positions," English
said. "But they blocked better
than we felt they could."
As soon as it looked like
Wyoming would not score again,
the team went on a run. Poor Car
dinal passing led to five Wyoming
points in the middle of the second
game. A Kathy Jurgens ace
reversed the trend and Klein and
Benton put the game away. Klein
made an overpowering kill of an
overpass at 10-5 that rocked the
Burnham crowd.
Feldman delivered one of her
classic deep aces to ignite the Car
dinal on another 4-0 in the final
game. The Cardinal had six aces
on the night. Benton and Klein

watched the Cowgirls streak for
five consecutive points. This was

Considering the Cardinal grad

single unit than it has in some
time. The feel the players have for
one another on the court, as much

gives them an edge over equally
talented but less synchronized
outfits — UCLA, perhaps?
For arguments sake, say Stan

demon that confronts them there,
in College Park, Md., is one the

team's current members know lit

Nancy Reno, Wendi Rush, Teresa

sister of current superstar Bev
Oden — led the Cardinal to, but
not through, the Final Four time
and again.
If the outcome is to be different

Feldman will go a long way toward
making that so. But so will the
play o r ' *in Klein and Amy

the only point in the match where
Stanford did not lead.
The run was little more than a
diversion and the Cardinal broke
away. Cooper hammered two
quick strikes to propel Stanford
ahead. Her teammates responded,
hitting .370 for the game. It took

three match points to seal the vic
tory but another Jurgens ace
ended the affair.
"I thought Stanford would be a
better passing team," English
said. "But they still did a good job
of getting their offense anyway.
It's an honor to play against
them." .
Either Brigham Young or San
Diego State will get that honor
next. Stanford will meet the win-

ner of that contest next Friday at
the Western Regional. The tour
nament will be held at UCLA if
the No. 1 Bruins win this weekend
against Gonzaga in their first
round match.
The Cardinal finished their
home season with 13 consecutive
wins. In the streak, Stanford lost
only two games. Overall, the team
is on a 12 match win streak.

Last night, the women's volley
ball team avenged last year's sea
son-ending defeat to Wyoming —
and did so in impressive fashion.
One might reasonably argue that
the Cardinal is the best team in
the nation right now.
For Stanford to prove it,
though, they'll have to exorcise
those other two demons. The first
will likely confront them a week
from Saturday when they should
meet UCLA in the West Regional
final. (That matchup only takes
place if both teams win their
regional semifinals, of course.)
The Cardinal's problem is they
haven't beaten the Bruins in Los
Angeles in quite a while. A confi
dent coach Don Shaw says,
"That's ancient history." And he
may be right. Stanford scored an
apparent match point when the
teams met at Pauley Pavilion in
October. While the ball was called
out — and Stanford subsequently
was defeated by UCLA that night
— it did establish the Cardinal's
ability to get the game-winner in
Southern California.
From the confidence they
exuded on the court last night, it's
clear the team believes its nearly a
shoo-in against the Bruins this
time around. "It doesn't matter
who's on the other side of the net.
It doesn't matter where we play
'em. It doesn't matter when we
play 'em," Shaw says.
It's equally apparent they've
put the debacle that was last sea
son behind them. "We're a very
different team," Shaw notes.
"[The players] took what was a
very frustrating and disappoint
ing year and used it as an educa
tional experience."

According to Stanford coach
Don Shaw, volleyball is a very sim
ple game.
Last night, the No. 3 Cardinal
(26-3) showed exactly what he
meant. Stanford provided a brief
one hour seminar in the basics:
passing, setting and hitting their
way into the second round of the
NCAA tournament.
Before a sell-out Burnham
Pavilion crowd, the Cardinal
blitzed unranked Wyoming (19-
10) in its final home match of the
season, 15-4, 15-5, 15-8.
"Anything could have hap
pened," Wyoming coach Mike
English said. "But Stanford play
ed very well. They did a nice job of
executing. We didn't get into
sync."
The Cowgirls, in fact, failed to
tally a point until down 7-0 in the
first game. Stanford outscored
English's squad 45-17 in a match
that was decided at the onset.
Aggressive Cardinal serving
caused a host of problems for
Wyoming. Their passers made
sure that setter Kim Smith had a
thorough workout, misplaying
balls all over the court for her.
Wyoming muffed point one, over
passed the ball to surrender point
two and watch an attack come
back in their faces for point three.
Pacific 10 Conference Player of
the Year Bev Oden smashed five
early kills to prop Stanford ahead
10-1 in the first game. But Oden
showed National Player of the
Year form in amassing a match
high 14 kills and hitting .480.
"Bev is a tremendous player,"
English said. "She's one of the
country's best."
At times during the game, it
looked as if Shaw would be able to
clear his bench. The Cardinal had
its way with its overmatched
counterpart. Standout setter Car
rie Feldman was able to drop over
an easy dump kill. Senior Jessica
Benton and junior Amy Cooper
kick-started the middle attack
with three kills between them.
The Cowgirls sealed their own
fate, double-hitting a ball and

making an attack error on the
game's final points. "I think we
could have executed better," Shaw
said. "But Wyoming could have
played better too. They weren't
passing the brll. They were
shanking the ball all over the
place."

tle about. Stanford greats like
Nancy Reno, Wendi Rush, Teresa
Smith and Kim Oden — the older
sister of current superstar Bev
Oden — led the Cardinal to, but
not through, the Final Four time
and again.
If the outcome is to be different
this time, the play of Oden and
Feldman will go a long way toward
making that so. But so will the
play o r ' *in Klein and Amy
Cooper, as well as that of Tracy
Hughes and Kathy Jurgens. For
tunately, the Cardinal seems to
know that and, with everyone fill
ing their roles well, the smart
money is no longer riding on the
demons.

the only point in the match where
Stanford did not lead.
The run was little more than a
diversion and the Cardinal broke
away. Cooper hammered two
quick strikes to propel Stanford
ahead. Her teammates responded,
hitting .370 for the game. It took

three match points to seal the vic
tory but another Jurgens ace
ended the affair.
"I thought Stanford would be a
better passing team," English
said. "But they still did a good job
of getting their offense anyway.
It's an honor to play against
them." .
Either Brigham Young or San
Diego State will get that honor
next. Stanford will meet the win-

ner of that contest next Friday at
the Western Regional. The tour
nament will be held at UCLA if
the No. 1 Bruins win this weekend
against Gonzaga in their first
round match.
The Cardinal finished their
home season with 13 consecutive
wins. In the streak, Stanford lost
only two games. Overall, the team
is on a 12 match win streak.
