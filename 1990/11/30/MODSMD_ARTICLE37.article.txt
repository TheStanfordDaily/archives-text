# An early look at the Pac-10
## 
### 
Now that a few early-sea
son tournaments have
been played, we can get a
better idea of which college bas
ketball teams have it, which
teams really have it, and which
teams are going to have a long
season.
For Stanford, it is still too
early to tell. The Cardinal
steamrolled Rider and Yale in
the Stanford Invitational, but
those victories were "gimmes."
The Apple Invitational starting
tonight might prove a little
tougher of a challenge, but not
by much. George Washington,
Vanderbilt and Hawaii still
don't have the size and ability to
play Stanford close.
The Cardinal got encourag
ing, productive minutes from
sophomore Kenny Hicks and
redshirt freshman Brent
Williams last weekend. They
will provide good backcourt
depth, if they don't end up start
ing at some point in the year.
But a glaring weakness
seems to be the relief corps for
Adam Keefe and Andrew Vla
hov. Not that Lang Meyer, Jim
Weaver, Jim Morgan and Paul
Garrett can't play. They just
need to be worked in for signifi
cant minutes. They're unproven
commodities.
Right now, though, the front
court looks scarily shallow, a
problem that will become very
plain when Stanford plays Ari
zona with its multiple tower-of
power lineups.
Around the Pacific 10 Con
ference:
No. 2 Arizona looked much
too good while beating
Arkansas, the AP preseason No.
2 team, by a margin of 12
points. Sport Magazine rated
Arizona forward Sean Rooks
fifth among the power forwards
in the nation. In his first few
games this year, Rooks has put
up some monster numbers, and
has become a dominating inside
scorer. Rumor has it that the
Portland Trail Blazers have an
eye on drafting Rooks, though,
so he might turnout to be a dud.
(The Blazers took Sam Bowie
over Michael Jordan and
Charles Barkley in 1984).
Joining Rooks in the "Tucson
Skyline" is center Brian
Williams, who is also certainly
one of the top big men in the
nation. Every team in the coun
try with the exception of maybe
Georgetown will have huge

match-up problems with Rooks
and Williams. These two players
alone could allow the Wildcats
to run away with the Pac-10
title.
But wait, there's more. Ari
zona's highly-touted transfer
from Kentucky, guard Chris
Mills, has been called by many
the best player in the Pac-10.
He seems to have all the tools,
and he is especially dangerous
from long range. Guard Matt
Muehlebach is a very solid ofT
guard, and Matt Othick is
another excellent shooter at the
point.

UCLA could take second in
the conference, but its claim to
that position is very tenuous.
Forward Don McLean, is (gulp,
choke) a very good all-around
player, even though he looks like
a cross between Gumby and
Beaver Cleaver. McLean fin
ished right behind Keefe in Pac
-10 scoring last season, and tied
Keefe for the conference lead in
rebounding, with an average of
9.1 per game. They should con
tinue their battles down low this
year.
The Bruins would have a
firmer grasp on the No. 2 slot if
6-foot-8 all-everything recruit
Ed O'Bannon hadn't been lost
for the season due to ir\jury.
O'Bannon was the top prep
player on the west coast, and
JCLA won the tight recruiting
war.
Third could go to Stanford,
USC or possibly Oregon. USC
could finish well purely on the
strength of sophomore and bur
geoning superstar Harold
Miner, who scored 20.6 points
per game last year. He can drive
to the hoop as well as fill it up
from outside (60 three-pointers
last year). Miner gets help from
senior forward Ronnie Cole
man, a steady inside man who
can rebound.
Oregon finished a surprising
fifth in the Pac-10 last season
and has everybody back. Point

guard Terrell "quickness per
sonified" Brandon made the all
conference team in his first year
of college ball. Brandon aver
aged 17.9 points, 6.0 assists,
was third in the league in three
point shooting percentage, and
second in steals.
Joining Brandon in the Ore
gon Duck backcourt is Kevin
Mixon, who hit for 80 three
pointers to lead the Pac-10. Ore
gon's stalwart down low is
senior Richard Lucas, who gath
ered 8.5 boards per game
although he stands only 6-foot
7.
One of the Ducks' prime-time
recruits is guard-forward Clyde
Jordan from West Covina, Calif.
If Clyde has anywhere near the
talents that his all-NBA name
would indicate, he will be a
guaranteed star.
California should finish in
the top half of the conference
after taking third last year. The
Golden Bears return sophomore
sensation Brian Hendrick, who
also made the all Pac-10 first
team in his first year. Cal loses
point guard Keith Smith to
graduation but retain shooting
guard Ryan Drew, who has
excellent range and good hands
on defense.
Arizona State returns one of
the Austins, 6-foot-10 senior
center Isaac Austin, and the
Sun Devils made a trip to the
National Invitational Tourna
ment at the end of last year. But
there's no room in the Inn this
year for Arizona State.
Oregon State finished tied
with Arizona for the conference
title last year almost exclusively
on the phenomenal ability of
now-Seattle Supersonic Gary
Payton. This year the Beavers
will have to rest their hopes on
the skinny shoulders of Will
Brantley. OSU got bad news in
the form of a season-ending
ii\jury to center Scott Haskin
and the loss to Proposition 48 of
forward Karl Anderson.
The Beavers do add transfer
guard Tony Ross, who set the
all-time NCAA record for three
pointers made by a freshman, at
San Diego State. So far Ross has
not been on track, however.
Washington and Washington
State suffer from a general lack
of talent.

Robert Pardington suffers from
a general lack of talent in most
things except for video games.

Now that a few early-sea
son tournaments have
been played, we can get a
better idea of which college bas
ketball teams have it, which
teams really have it, and which
teams are going to have a long
season.
For Stanford, it is still too
early to tell. The Cardinal
steamrolled Rider and Yale in
the Stanford Invitational, but
those victories were "gimmes."
The Apple Invitational starting
tonight might prove a little
tougher of a challenge, but not
by much. George Washington,
Vanderbilt and Hawaii still
don't have the size and ability to
play Stanford close.
The Cardinal got encourag
ing, productive minutes from
sophomore Kenny Hicks and
redshirt freshman Brent
Williams last weekend. They
will provide good backcourt
depth, if they don't end up start
ing at some point in the year.
But a glaring weakness
seems to be the relief corps for
Adam Keefe and Andrew Vla
hov. Not that Lang Meyer, Jim
Weaver, Jim Morgan and Paul
Garrett can't play. They just
need to be worked in for signifi
cant minutes. They're unproven
commodities.
Right now, though, the front
court looks scarily shallow, a
problem that will become very
plain when Stanford plays Ari
zona with its multiple tower-of
power lineups.
Around the Pacific 10 Con
ference:
No. 2 Arizona looked much
too good while beating
Arkansas, the AP preseason No.
2 team, by a margin of 12
points. Sport Magazine rated
Arizona forward Sean Rooks
fifth among the power forwards
in the nation. In his first few
games this year, Rooks has put
up some monster numbers, and
has become a dominating inside
scorer. Rumor has it that the
Portland Trail Blazers have an
eye on drafting Rooks, though,
so he might turnout to be a dud.
(The Blazers took Sam Bowie
over Michael Jordan and
Charles Barkley in 1984).
Joining Rooks in the "Tucson
Skyline" is center Brian
Williams, who is also certainly
one of the top big men in the
nation. Every team in the coun
try with the exception of maybe
Georgetown will have huge

match-up problems with Rooks
and Williams. These two players
alone could allow the Wildcats
to run away with the Pac-10
title.
But wait, there's more. Ari
zona's highly-touted transfer
from Kentucky, guard Chris
Mills, has been called by many
the best player in the Pac-10.
He seems to have all the tools,
and he is especially dangerous
from long range. Guard Matt
Muehlebach is a very solid ofT
guard, and Matt Othick is
another excellent shooter at the
point.

UCLA could take second in
the conference, but its claim to
that position is very tenuous.
Forward Don McLean, is (gulp,
choke) a very good all-around
player, even though he looks like
a cross between Gumby and
Beaver Cleaver. McLean fin
ished right behind Keefe in Pac
-10 scoring last season, and tied
Keefe for the conference lead in
rebounding, with an average of
9.1 per game. They should con
tinue their battles down low this
year.
The Bruins would have a
firmer grasp on the No. 2 slot if
6-foot-8 all-everything recruit
Ed O'Bannon hadn't been lost
for the season due to ir\jury.
O'Bannon was the top prep
player on the west coast, and
JCLA won the tight recruiting
war.
Third could go to Stanford,
USC or possibly Oregon. USC
could finish well purely on the
strength of sophomore and bur
geoning superstar Harold
Miner, who scored 20.6 points
per game last year. He can drive
to the hoop as well as fill it up
from outside (60 three-pointers
last year). Miner gets help from
senior forward Ronnie Cole
man, a steady inside man who
can rebound.
Oregon finished a surprising
fifth in the Pac-10 last season
and has everybody back. Point

guard Terrell "quickness per
sonified" Brandon made the all
conference team in his first year
of college ball. Brandon aver
aged 17.9 points, 6.0 assists,
was third in the league in three
point shooting percentage, and
second in steals.
Joining Brandon in the Ore
gon Duck backcourt is Kevin
Mixon, who hit for 80 three
pointers to lead the Pac-10. Ore
gon's stalwart down low is
senior Richard Lucas, who gath
ered 8.5 boards per game
although he stands only 6-foot
7.
One of the Ducks' prime-time
recruits is guard-forward Clyde
Jordan from West Covina, Calif.
If Clyde has anywhere near the
talents that his all-NBA name
would indicate, he will be a
guaranteed star.
California should finish in
the top half of the conference
after taking third last year. The
Golden Bears return sophomore
sensation Brian Hendrick, who
also made the all Pac-10 first
team in his first year. Cal loses
point guard Keith Smith to
graduation but retain shooting
guard Ryan Drew, who has
excellent range and good hands
on defense.
Arizona State returns one of
the Austins, 6-foot-10 senior
center Isaac Austin, and the
Sun Devils made a trip to the
National Invitational Tourna
ment at the end of last year. But
there's no room in the Inn this
year for Arizona State.
Oregon State finished tied
with Arizona for the conference
title last year almost exclusively
on the phenomenal ability of
now-Seattle Supersonic Gary
Payton. This year the Beavers
will have to rest their hopes on
the skinny shoulders of Will
Brantley. OSU got bad news in
the form of a season-ending
ii\jury to center Scott Haskin
and the loss to Proposition 48 of
forward Karl Anderson.
The Beavers do add transfer
guard Tony Ross, who set the
all-time NCAA record for three
pointers made by a freshman, at
San Diego State. So far Ross has
not been on track, however.
Washington and Washington
State suffer from a general lack

Robert Pardington suffers from
