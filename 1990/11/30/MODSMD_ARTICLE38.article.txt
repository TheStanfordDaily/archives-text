# Men host Apple Invitational
## 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
Something unusual may hap
pen to the Stanford men's basket
ball team when it hosts the sev
enth annual Apple Invitational
this weekend:
The Cardinal may actually lose
a game.
No, really.
Stanford has owned the Apple
Invite for the last four years, win
ning all eight of its games and
walking away with the champi
onship each time. In the six years
the tournament has been around,
the Cardinal has won it five times.
Of course, most of those wins
came at the expense of non-bas
ketball powers like the University
of the Pacific (1984), Yale (1985),
Columbia (1986), William & Mary
and Brown (1987), Cornell and
Colorado State (1988) and Lehigh
and Lousiana Tech (1989).

This time around, there are at
least two teams — Hawaii and
Vanderbilt — that have a chance
of dethroning the Cardinal. Those
two teams will play tonight at 8:30
p.m. at Maples Pavilion, while
Stanford will face George Wash
ington University in the opening
game at 6:30 p.m.
"It's always fun to bring in
teams from around the country,"
Stanford coach Mike Montgomery
said. "It's a good chance to see

other styles of play."
Of course, the quality of teams
in this year's Invitational means it
also may be a good chance to lose.
"We certainly feel we have a lot of
work to do," Montgomery said.
"Last weekend (in the Stanford
Invitational) was a good chance to
get some game time in, but there
wasn't the same caliber of teams
that there is in this tournament."
Hawaii shot the Cardinal down
in the first round of last season's
NIT, and Stanford probably won't
have much trouble remembering
that game if the two schools
should happen to meet in the
championship tomorrow night.
"Hawaii presented us with a real
nice way to end the season last
year," Montgomery said dryly,
referring to the 69-57 pounding
the Rainbows gave the Cardinal in
the NIT. "They were one of the
few teams that physically domi
nated us."
Unfortunately for Hawaii
coach Riley Wallace, four of that
team's starters (along with four
other lettermen) have graduated,
leaving him with a lot of holes to
fill. "Last year we were a big,
strong team, but this year we're
just a bunch of country boys from
the islands," Riley said. "Skinny
kids."
Those kids may have to face
one of Riley's worst nightmares:
Stanford's Adam Keefe, who
scored 31 points against the Rain
bows last year. "Keefe is as good
an offensive player as we've
played since I've been a coach,"
Riley said. "I dread playing him
again."
He may not have to, because
Vanderbilt mav get the honors.
The Commodores have three
starters back from last year's NIT
champs — including NIT MVP
Scott Draud, a guard who scored
16.5 per game last year — and
seem to have the best chance of
stealing the Apple title from Stan*
ford.
Even with those three starters
back, though, Vanderbilt coach
Eddie Fogler isn't sure what kind


(lie
Sophomore guard Kenny Hlcke was Impressive In the Stanford
Invitational laat weekend, making the all-tournament team.
