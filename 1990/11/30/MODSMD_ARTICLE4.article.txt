# Fac Sen passes revamped DRs

### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
A divided Faculty Senate passed a pro
posal yesterday to revamp the University's
distribution requirements — a move that
will require future undergraduates to take
courses examining non-Western cultures,
racial and religious diversity in the United
States and gender issues before they gradu
ate.
The measure, approved by an unoffical
tally of 26-15, was a slightly modified ver
sion of the proposal introduced last May by
the Committee on Undergraduate Studies,
chaired by History Prof. Peter Duus.
Duus said in an interview after the meet
ing that he was "surprised and pleased" by
the margin of victory and called the new
requirements "a step in the right direction"
for preparing Stanford students to live in
an increasingly global society.
Opponents to the revision argued that
the new requirements were a concession to
the "politically correct," that a piecemeal
revision process had failed to examine the
overarching rationale for the DR system
and that there was little evidence to suggest
the community favored such a change.
A Daily poll published yesterday found
only 15 percent of the student body sup
ported the committee's proposal.
As a result of yesterday's decision, next
year's freshmen will face two new require

ments: "World Cultures," which replaces
the "asterisked" status of the current non-
Western requirement; and "American Cul
tures," which may be fulfilled by courses
that examine "racial, ethnic and/or reli
gious diversity in the culture and society of
the United States."
Incoming students will also be required
to fulfill an "asterisked" gender studies
requirement. The behavioral science and
social science requirements, areas 4 and 5,
will be collapsed into a single requirement.
The number of required courses for
undergraduates will be 11 instead of 10.
The only modification to the committee
proposal in yesterday's debate was the
removal of a sentence mandating that
courses fulfilling the "American Cultures"
requirement "must examine critically ideas
about race."
Duus said the amendment should have
only "a minimal effect" on what courses are
certified to fulfill the "American Cultures"
requirement. But the change does leave
open the possibility that a course on reli
gious groups in the United States could sat
