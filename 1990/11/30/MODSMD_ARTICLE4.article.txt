# Fac Sen passes revamped DRs
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
A divided Faculty Senate passed a pro
posal yesterday to revamp the University's
distribution requirements — a move that
will require future undergraduates to take
courses examining non-Western cultures,
racial and religious diversity in the United
States and gender issues before they gradu
ate.
The measure, approved by an unoffical
tally of 26-15, was a slightly modified ver
sion of the proposal introduced last May by
the Committee on Undergraduate Studies,
chaired by History Prof. Peter Duus.
Duus said in an interview after the meet
ing that he was "surprised and pleased" by
the margin of victory and called the new
requirements "a step in the right direction"
for preparing Stanford students to live in
an increasingly global society.
Opponents to the revision argued that
the new requirements were a concession to
the "politically correct," that a piecemeal
revision process had failed to examine the
overarching rationale for the DR system
and that there was little evidence to suggest
the community favored such a change.
A Daily poll published yesterday found
only 15 percent of the student body sup
ported the committee's proposal.
As a result of yesterday's decision, next
year's freshmen will face two new require

ments: "World Cultures," which replaces
the "asterisked" status of the current non-
Western requirement; and "American Cul
tures," which may be fulfilled by courses
that examine "racial, ethnic and/or reli
gious diversity in the culture and society of
the United States."
Incoming students will also be required
to fulfill an "asterisked" gender studies
requirement. The behavioral science and
social science requirements, areas 4 and 5,
will be collapsed into a single requirement.
The number of required courses for
undergraduates will be 11 instead of 10.
The only modification to the committee
proposal in yesterday's debate was the
removal of a sentence mandating that
courses fulfilling the "American Cultures"
requirement "must examine critically ideas
about race."
Duus said the amendment should have
only "a minimal effect" on what courses are
certified to fulfill the "American Cultures"
requirement. But the change does leave
open the possibility that a course on reli
gious groups in the United States could sat
isfy the "American Cultures" requirement
without explicitly addressing the issue of
race.
Duus has contended for some time that
the "American Cultures" requirement is
not an ethnic studies requirement. During
senate debate, he noted the requirement
could be filled by a course on the history of
American schools or a course on the Consti
tution and civil rights, provided just a small
part of either of the courses addressed

issues of race or ethnicity.
An alternate proposal
that left the DR system vir
tually intact was given
serious consideration yes
terday, but was eventually
rejected by the senate.
Introduced by Political Sci
ence Prof. David Aber
nethy, the alternate pro
posal called for upgrading
the "asterisked" non-West-

ern requirement to a "full-fledged" require
ment, but otherwise left the present system
unchanged.
Introduced as a substitute motion, the
Abernethy proposal was defeated by an
unofficial 22-18 tally.
Abernethy said after the meeting that he
wasn't particularly surprised by the out

come. He said changing the DRs was a
value decision, and that he didn't agree
with the values embodied by the change.
He argued that the increased emphasis
on the study of race and gender would
undercut the requirements' goal of expos
ing students to a wide variety of academic
disciplines.
In yesterday's meeting, Jay Tucker, a
Council of Presidents member with speak
ing privileges in the senate, voiced his sup
port of the committee's proposal, calling
the revamped requirements "a funda
mental change in the way students are edu
cated on this campus." He said the new
requirements would provide students with

the tools to be responsible
members of society.
While Duus and others
on the committee assured
senate members that there
were enough courses
already in existence to ful
fill the new requirements,
Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Ewart Thomas
said in yesterday's meeting

that the revised requirements would
prompt the development of many new
courses for undergraduates.
Thomas also noted that the increased
number of requirements would require a
modest increase in the money required to
pay teaching assistants.

ported the committee's proposal.
As a result of yesterday's decision, next
year's freshmen will face two new require

ments: "World Cultures," which replaces
the "asterisked" status of the current non-
Western requirement; and "American Cul
tures," which may be fulfilled by courses
that examine "racial, ethnic and/or reli
gious diversity in the culture and society of
the United States."
Incoming students will also be required
to fulfill an "asterisked" gender studies
requirement. The behavioral science and
social science requirements, areas 4 and 5,
will be collapsed into a single requirement.
The number of required courses for
undergraduates will be 11 instead of 10.
The only modification to the committee
proposal in yesterday's debate was the
removal of a sentence mandating that
courses fulfilling the "American Cultures"
requirement "must examine critically ideas
about race."
Duus said the amendment should have
only "a minimal effect" on what courses are
certified to fulfill the "American Cultures"
requirement. But the change does leave
open the possibility that a course on reli
gious groups in the United States could sat
isfy the "American Cultures" requirement
without explicitly addressing the issue of
race.
Duus has contended for some time that
the "American Cultures" requirement is
not an ethnic studies requirement. During
senate debate, he noted the requirement
could be filled by a course on the history of
American schools or a course on the Consti
tution and civil rights, provided just a small
part of either of the courses addressed

issues of race or ethnicity.
An alternate proposal
that left the DR system vir
tually intact was given
serious consideration yes
terday, but was eventually
rejected by the senate.
Introduced by Political Sci
ence Prof. David Aber
nethy, the alternate pro
posal called for upgrading
the "asterisked" non-West-

ern requirement to a "full-fledged" require
ment, but otherwise left the present system
unchanged.
Introduced as a substitute motion, the
Abernethy proposal was defeated by an
unofficial 22-18 tally.
Abernethy said after the meeting that he
wasn't particularly surprised by the out

come. He said changing the DRs was a
value decision, and that he didn't agree
with the values embodied by the change.
He argued that the increased emphasis
on the study of race and gender would
undercut the requirements' goal of expos
ing students to a wide variety of academic
disciplines.
In yesterday's meeting, Jay Tucker, a
Council of Presidents member with speak
ing privileges in the senate, voiced his sup
port of the committee's proposal, calling
the revamped requirements "a funda
mental change in the way students are edu
cated on this campus." He said the new
requirements would provide students with

the tools to be responsible
members of society.
While Duus and others
on the committee assured
senate members that there
were enough courses
already in existence to ful
fill the new requirements,
Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Ewart Thomas
said in yesterday's meeting

that the revised requirements would
prompt the development of many new
courses for undergraduates.
Thomas also noted that the increased
number of requirements would require a
modest increase in the money required to
pay teaching assistants.
