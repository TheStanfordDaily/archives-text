# Hoopsters face Notre Dame, No. 13 Long Beach State
## Freshman Hedgpeth is stepping into big shoes 
### Dave Hirning Senior staff writer Dave Hirning Senior staff writer 
You can take the freshman out
of North Carolina, but you can't
take North Carolina out of the
freshman. The friendly smile and
the slight twang are as endearing
as they are unmistakable.
With the potential that fresh
man guard Christy Hedgpeth has
displayed at guard, the Stanford
women's basketball team will take
her any way they can get her.
Although a newcomer to the
defending champion Cardinal, the
Thomasville, N.C. product has
already made her presence felt.
In her two months as a Stan
ford student, Hedgpeth won a
starting spot on the No. 2 presea
son-ranked Cardinal, in the posi
tion formerly occupied by NCAA
Player of the Year Jennifer Azzi.
No big deal.
All she had to deal with in her
debut at sixth-ranked Tennessee
was the pressure of television and
a crowd of 7,500, which included
a host of friends, ex-coaches and
relatives, including her parents.
It was pretty intimidating for a
player who "wasn't even sure I
was going to play" for the Cardi
nal this year. After all, Hedgpeth
almost didn't come to Stanford
because she thought that the
coaches saw more talent in her
than she possessed.
That fear, and heavy recruiting
pressure by home-state programs
Duke, Wake Forest and North
Carolina, almost kept Hedgpeth
down home. "If I had signed early
(in the fall period), I wouldn't be
here," Hedgpeth said. "I wasn't
sure I could handle being that far
from home."
As her success so far shows, the
Cardinal coaches are glad she
made the trek to California.
"Christy's contribution to our
team is that she is a competitor,
and she listens," Coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "She tries really

hard to do what you ask her to
do."
Hedgpeth entered a wide-open
battle for the starting guard spot
opposite senior Sor\ja Henning
when she came to practice this
fall, and quickly emerged as a
front-runner. One reason was her
size. At 5-foot-10, Hedgpeth has
the height for the off-guard spot.
Another big factor is her ath
letic conditioning and ability. A
former tennis prodigy (she was
USTA state singles champion as a
10-year-old), Hedgpeth entered
fall practice in excellent shape.
"She worked really hard in the
summer," VanDerveer said. "Her
conditioning is not like a fresh
man's conditioning. She can run
all day."
In the opener against the Vol
unteers, Hedgpeth had a rocky
afternoon. She made only one of
six shots and scored just four
points. The fact that Molly Good
enbour will start in her place
today against Long Beach State
seems to bear that out. But this is
not the full story.
On the contrary, VanDerveer
liked what she saw from her fresh
man guard, and plans to rotate
her with Goodenbour depending
on the opponent. "I was very
pleased with Christy," she said.
"She was the one getting the
steals, she was the one that was
more aggressive. She did some
really good things, but as the
game went on, her (lack of) experi
ence showed."
The unassuming Hedgpeth
would be the first to admit she has
a lot to learn and saw good and
bad in her first outing. But she
said that the pressure of the Ten
nessee game didn't really hit her
until afterwards, and she is ready
for the next challenge against No.
13 Long Beach. This will be her
second game, and it's on television
(Sports Channel cable) too. More
pressure.
"It'll be a little bit easier, and

I'll know a little bit more of what
to expect," Hedgpeth said.
"There's a lot of intensity on the
court in the game situation help I
look forward to playing."
One advantage that Hedgpeth
had at Tennessee that will be
absent in Long Beach is the pres
ence of her parents. "That was the
best thing about the trip for me,"
she said with a grin. "They're the
reason while I'm still playing
sports - they never put any pres
sure on me."

That sound you heard last Sun
day afternoon was not the bells of
Hoover Tower. It wasn't the Clock
Tower striking off the hour.
No, that ringing sound
emnated all the way from
Knoxville, Tenn., where the No. 2
Stanford women's basketball
team got a rude awakening at the
hands of the No. 6 Tennessee
Lady Volunteers. The defending
national champions were hum
bled 95-80 on regional television
and had a point brought home to
them which they hadn't quite
believed up until then:
Last year means nothing, on
the court.
"We have no excuses," Coach
Tara VanDerveer said. "I don't
think we could have played any
worse. We have a lot of work to
do."
After two hard practices and a
lot of soul-searching, the Cardinal
will tackle another talented, moti
vated opponent on the road
tonight in No. 13 Long Beach
State.
The 49ers are a different ani
mal than the Lady Vols, but could
mean just as much trouble. A
lightning-quick, fast-breaking
team, Long Beach has already
upset one top-10 squad this sea
son. In their opener, the 49ere
bested No. 7 Texas, 80-74.
VanDerveer sees Long Beach as
a team, along with Tennessee,
that she would like her team to
emulate. "If you look at all those
things (running the ball, speed),
those are the things that we want
to do," she said. "We're playing
against teams that do the things
we want to do the best."
The Cardinal will hurry back
from their game in Southern Cali
fornia in order to take on Notre
Dame at home on Sunday.
There are some specific
changes that VanDerveer will
make this weekend as a result of
the Tennessee experience, start
ing with the starting lineup. "I

didn't like our big lineup—Val,
Julie and Trisha together," she
said bluntly. "I thought it was too
slow. I think we need to experi
ment with our backcourt, in terms
of a rotation."
VanDerveer said that this
means sophomore Chris Mac-
Murdo and freshman Kelly
Dougherty will see more time at
the "three," or small forward spot,

1 didn't like our big
lineup.'
— Tara VanDerveer

with junior Julie Zeilstra moving
to the power forward and Val
Whiting returning to last year's
effective "sixth player" role. The
guard rotation will consist chiefly
of Sonja Henning, Molly Gooden
bour (who will start tonight) and
Christy Hedgpeth.
VanDerveer also referred to
three areas in which Tennessee
outplayed Stanford as keys for
improvement: executing half
court offense, half-court defense,
and rebounding. When asked
about the Lady Vols offensive
rebounding success against the
Cardinal, VanDerveer replied:
"Maybe they (the Cardinal)
thought somebody else was going
to get it."
The Stanford running game
was not quite where the coaches
wanted it, something that will
have to be remedied against the
49ers. Long Beach is led by four
returning starters, including
seniors Penny Moore (15 points
per-game, eight rebounds) and
Dana Wilkerson (16 ppg). This
group helped the 49ers go 25-9
and reach the second round of the
NCAAs last year.
This will be Stanford's first
ever meeting with Notre Dame,
which is led by guard Karen
Robinson. Robinson, a 5-foot-6
senior, averaged 15 points a game
last season and had 26 in the
Fighting Irish's season opener
against Evansville.

Whiting returning to last year's
effective "sixth player" role. The
guard rotation will consist chiefly
of Sonja Henning, Molly Gooden
bour (who will start tonight) and
Christy Hedgpeth.
VanDerveer also referred to
three areas in which Tennessee
outplayed Stanford as keys for
improvement: executing half
court offense, half-court defense,
and rebounding. When asked
about the Lady Vols offensive
rebounding success against the
Cardinal, VanDerveer replied:
"Maybe they (the Cardinal)
thought somebody else was going
to get it."
The Stanford running game
was not quite where the coaches
wanted it, something that will
have to be remedied against the
49ers. Long Beach is led by four
returning starters, including
seniors Penny Moore (15 points
per-game, eight rebounds) and
Dana Wilkerson (16 ppg). This
group helped the 49ers go 25-9
and reach the second round of the
NCAAs last year.
This will be Stanford's first
ever meeting with Notre Dame,
which is led by guard Karen
Robinson. Robinson, a 5-foot-6
senior, averaged 15 points a game
last season and had 26 in the
Fighting Irish's season opener
against Evansville.


Tracy Allen - Dally Ale
Freshman guard Christy Hedgpeth has been thrust Into Tara
VanOerveer's starting lineup at the off-guard spot, Jennifer Azzl's
old position.
You can take the freshman out
of North Carolina, but you can't
take North Carolina out of the
freshman. The friendly smile and
the slight twang are as endearing
as they are unmistakable.
With the potential that fresh
man guard Christy Hedgpeth has
displayed at guard, the Stanford
women's basketball team will take
her any way they can get her.
Although a newcomer to the
defending champion Cardinal, the
Thomasville, N.C. product has
already made her presence felt.
In her two months as a Stan
ford student, Hedgpeth won a
starting spot on the No. 2 presea
son-ranked Cardinal, in the posi
tion formerly occupied by NCAA
Player of the Year Jennifer Azzi.
No big deal.
All she had to deal with in her
debut at sixth-ranked Tennessee
was the pressure of television and
a crowd of 7,500, which included
a host of friends, ex-coaches and
relatives, including her parents.
It was pretty intimidating for a
player who "wasn't even sure I
was going to play" for the Cardi
nal this year. After all, Hedgpeth
almost didn't come to Stanford
because she thought that the
coaches saw more talent in her
than she possessed.
That fear, and heavy recruiting
pressure by home-state programs
Duke, Wake Forest and North
Carolina, almost kept Hedgpeth
down home. "If I had signed early
(in the fall period), I wouldn't be
here," Hedgpeth said. "I wasn't
sure I could handle being that far
from home."
As her success so far shows, the
Cardinal coaches are glad she
made the trek to California.
"Christy's contribution to our
team is that she is a competitor,
and she listens," Coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "She tries really

hard to do what you ask her to
do."
Hedgpeth entered a wide-open
battle for the starting guard spot
opposite senior Sor\ja Henning
when she came to practice this
fall, and quickly emerged as a
front-runner. One reason was her
size. At 5-foot-10, Hedgpeth has
the height for the off-guard spot.
Another big factor is her ath
letic conditioning and ability. A
former tennis prodigy (she was
USTA state singles champion as a
10-year-old), Hedgpeth entered
fall practice in excellent shape.
"She worked really hard in the
summer," VanDerveer said. "Her
conditioning is not like a fresh
man's conditioning. She can run
all day."
In the opener against the Vol
unteers, Hedgpeth had a rocky
afternoon. She made only one of
six shots and scored just four
points. The fact that Molly Good
enbour will start in her place
today against Long Beach State
seems to bear that out. But this is
not the full story.
On the contrary, VanDerveer
liked what she saw from her fresh
man guard, and plans to rotate
her with Goodenbour depending
on the opponent. "I was very
pleased with Christy," she said.
"She was the one getting the
steals, she was the one that was
more aggressive. She did some
really good things, but as the
game went on, her (lack of) experi
ence showed."
The unassuming Hedgpeth
would be the first to admit she has
a lot to learn and saw good and
bad in her first outing. But she
said that the pressure of the Ten
nessee game didn't really hit her
until afterwards, and she is ready
for the next challenge against No.
13 Long Beach. This will be her
second game, and it's on television
(Sports Channel cable) too. More
pressure.
"It'll be a little bit easier, and

I'll know a little bit more of what
to expect," Hedgpeth said.
"There's a lot of intensity on the
court in the game situation help I
look forward to playing."
One advantage that Hedgpeth
had at Tennessee that will be
absent in Long Beach is the pres
ence of her parents. "That was the
best thing about the trip for me,"
she said with a grin. "They're the
reason while I'm still playing
sports - they never put any pres
sure on me."

That sound you heard last Sun
day afternoon was not the bells of
Hoover Tower. It wasn't the Clock
Tower striking off the hour.
No, that ringing sound
emnated all the way from
Knoxville, Tenn., where the No. 2
Stanford women's basketball
team got a rude awakening at the
hands of the No. 6 Tennessee
Lady Volunteers. The defending
national champions were hum
bled 95-80 on regional television
and had a point brought home to
them which they hadn't quite
believed up until then:
Last year means nothing, on
the court.
"We have no excuses," Coach
Tara VanDerveer said. "I don't
think we could have played any
worse. We have a lot of work to
do."
After two hard practices and a
lot of soul-searching, the Cardinal
will tackle another talented, moti
vated opponent on the road
tonight in No. 13 Long Beach
State.
The 49ers are a different ani
mal than the Lady Vols, but could
mean just as much trouble. A
lightning-quick, fast-breaking
team, Long Beach has already
upset one top-10 squad this sea
son. In their opener, the 49ere
bested No. 7 Texas, 80-74.
VanDerveer sees Long Beach as
a team, along with Tennessee,
that she would like her team to
emulate. "If you look at all those
things (running the ball, speed),
those are the things that we want
to do," she said. "We're playing
against teams that do the things
we want to do the best."
The Cardinal will hurry back
from their game in Southern Cali
fornia in order to take on Notre
Dame at home on Sunday.
There are some specific
changes that VanDerveer will
make this weekend as a result of
the Tennessee experience, start
ing with the starting lineup. "I

didn't like our big lineup—Val,
Julie and Trisha together," she
said bluntly. "I thought it was too
slow. I think we need to experi
ment with our backcourt, in terms
of a rotation."
VanDerveer said that this
means sophomore Chris Mac-
Murdo and freshman Kelly
Dougherty will see more time at
the "three," or small forward spot,

1 didn't like our big
lineup.'
— Tara VanDerveer

with junior Julie Zeilstra moving
to the power forward and Val

team, Long Beach has already
upset one top-10 squad this sea
son. In their opener, the 49ere
bested No. 7 Texas, 80-74.
VanDerveer sees Long Beach as
a team, along with Tennessee,
that she would like her team to
emulate. "If you look at all those
things (running the ball, speed),
those are the things that we want
to do," she said. "We're playing
against teams that do the things
we want to do the best."
The Cardinal will hurry back
from their game in Southern Cali
fornia in order to take on Notre
Dame at home on Sunday.
There are some specific
changes that VanDerveer will
make this weekend as a result of
the Tennessee experience, start
ing with the starting lineup. "I

didn't like our big lineup—Val,
Julie and Trisha together," she
said bluntly. "I thought it was too
slow. I think we need to experi
ment with our backcourt, in terms
of a rotation."
VanDerveer said that this
means sophomore Chris Mac-
Murdo and freshman Kelly
Dougherty will see more time at
the "three," or small forward spot,

1 didn't like our big
lineup.'

with junior Julie Zeilstra moving
to the power forward and Val
Whiting returning to last year's
effective "sixth player" role. The
guard rotation will consist chiefly
of Sonja Henning, Molly Gooden
bour (who will start tonight) and
Christy Hedgpeth.
VanDerveer also referred to
three areas in which Tennessee
outplayed Stanford as keys for
improvement: executing half
court offense, half-court defense,
and rebounding. When asked
about the Lady Vols offensive
rebounding success against the
Cardinal, VanDerveer replied:
"Maybe they (the Cardinal)
thought somebody else was going
to get it."
The Stanford running game
was not quite where the coaches
wanted it, something that will
have to be remedied against the
49ers. Long Beach is led by four
returning starters, including
seniors Penny Moore (15 points
per-game, eight rebounds) and
Dana Wilkerson (16 ppg). This
group helped the 49ers go 25-9
and reach the second round of the
NCAAs last year.
This will be Stanford's first
ever meeting with Notre Dame,
which is led by guard Karen
Robinson. Robinson, a 5-foot-6
senior, averaged 15 points a game
last season and had 26 in the
Fighting Irish's season opener
against Evansville.
