Although the Indy 500 and
Hoosier basketball put Indi
anapolis on the sporting world
map, this Midwest city hosts
other lesser known sporting
events, such as swimming's
U.S. Open.
Yesterday the men's and
women's swim teams packed up
their suits and headed for chilly
Indianapolis to compete in this
international event.
The Cardinal team of 20
women and 12 men will swim
on Friday, Saturday and Sunday
against other collegiate com
petitors, international swim
mers and high school-aged
United States Swimming mem
bers. The meet will be scored
individually, with no team
scores compiled.
In order to be eligible for the
meet, swimmers had to make

Senior National qualifying
times, equivalent to qualifying
times for the Olympic Trials.
The U.S. Open is the main
focus for the swimmers during
the fall. "This is a good time to
race and get good times," said
freshman Summer Sanders.
Sanders is competing in the 200
IM, 400 IM, 100-meter fly, 200
fly and the 100-meter breast
stroke.
Although qualifying times
are needed for the meet, com
petitors will come from a wide
variety of schools and associa
tions. "This will be pretty good
competition," said Laurie Gan
drud, who is swimming in the
100 breast, 200 breast and 400
IM.
Teams are preparing differ
ently because this meet is more
important for some teams than
others. Some teams have
tapered down their workouts
while others have rested. Stan

ford hasn't tapered down as
much as for other competi
tions.
However, this competition is
still important for the Stanford
swimmers. "This is not like a
practice meet," said swimmer
Lea Loveless. Loveless is racing
in the 200 IM, 100-meter back
stroke and the 200 back.
Along with the 32 Cardinal
swimmers are three other
women who train with the
Stanford team. Jill Johnson,
who graduated from Stanford
in June, and Jenna Johnson, an
Olympic medalist who gradu
ated in 1989, are both compet
ing in Indianapolis. Angie
Wester-Kreig, a post-grad swim
mer, is also competing.
After this meet, the swim
mers will set their sights on
February's Pacific 10 Confer
ence schedule and the NCAA
Championships at the end of
March.
