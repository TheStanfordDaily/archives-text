## 
### Gretchen Atwood Staff writer 
This weekend the Stanford
grapplers will tpr their luck in
Las Vegas. But instead of gam
bling, they will be wrestling
some of the top teams in the
country.
Among the 46 teams com
peting in the Las Vegas Invita
tional will be the defending
national champion, Oklahoma
State, and the 1990 NCAA run
ner-up, Arizona State. Stan
ford enters with a 1-1 record
after blowing out San Fran
cisco State on Tuesday.
"This is really going to be a
good test for Steve Buddie and
Steve Yarbrough, who have
both done well at this level,"
said Stanford coach Chris Hor
pel.
"Buddie didn't place in this

tournament last year but
placed 4th in the NCAA, so
that shows you how tough the
tournament is," said Horpel.
Currently Buddie is ranked No.
1 in the country.
"My goal is to win," said
Yarbrough, "I'm right up there
with the top of them. If I have
a good tournament and do
everything right I have a good
shot."
Also gunning for a top finish
is 142-pounder James Dinette.
"We expect to do really well in
the weight classes that we've
been strong in this year, 142-
177. We're hoping to place. If
you can do that you know
you're on your way to nation
als," said Dinette.
"James has really come close
to placing before so he's some
one who might come through
for us," said Horpel.
