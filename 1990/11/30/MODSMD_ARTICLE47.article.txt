# Students rally over DRs
## 
### Sarah Truitt Staff writer 
As Faculty Senate members entered the
Law School yesterday to vote on proposed
distribution requirements, students on
both sides of the issue rallied outside in an
attempt to influence the outcome.
About 50 students came to support a
proposal endorsed by the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies, which the Faculty
Senate passed by an unofficial vote of 26-
15.
Students held banners and chanted slo
gans such as "Professors fight. Make the
DRs right" and "We must make the DRs
just." They also distributed fliers to Faculty
Senate members that responded to criti
cisms of the committee proposal.
"The new proposal was created to pro
vide for a more diverse curriculum,"
according to senior Sarah Fiarman, a mem
ber of the Feminist Studies Program Com
mittee.
Several Students First Issues Commit
tee members who opposed the committee
proposal and other changes in the require
ments stood in the doorway telling mem
bers of the Senate, "Keep the facts in
mind."
"Even if the subject matter is valid, it
doesn't necessarily follow that... it should
therefore be required," sophomore Chris
Patil said.
The new DRs "would force me to make a
decision between advanced study of my cho
sen field in exchange for something I don't

value as highly — politically charged expo
sure to certain issues that could be best
explored in a dorm-based program or on an
individual level," he continued.
The changes passed yesterday include
the addition of World Cultures and Ameri
can Cultures requirements and an aster
isked gender studies requirement. Areas
four and five, which include behavioral and
social sciences, will be collapsed into a sin
gle area.
Supporters argued that the changes will
broaden the curriculum and make it more
inclusive to reflect a more diverse society.
But Students First members said the com
mittee proposal would place an unreason
able academic burden on students in engi
neering mayors and restrict students' free
dom in selecting courses.
"It's really sad to see students taking
Anthropology 1 for the non-western civi
lization requirement. Being able to do that
is kind of a cop-out," according to Carl
Hicks, a supporter of the committee pro
posal.
In addition, "making these areas DRs
will show the commitment on the part of
the University to develop these depart
ments," said senior Liz Cook, a member of
the ASSU Committee on Democracy and
Education.
But senior Eric Krock offered an oppos
ing opinion, saying, "My concern is that the
academic courseload will have a dispropor
tionate effect on the engineers at Stanford
who already have a much heavier
courseload."


Hilary Smith — Dally
Members of the People's Platform and Students First voice their opinions on the proposed changes to the DR system to
members of the Faculty Senate as they enter the Law School yesterday. The Senate eventually voted to accept the pro
posal submitted by the Committee on Undergraduate Studies.
