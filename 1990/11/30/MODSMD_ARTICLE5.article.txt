tion to keep the Fundamental
Standard intact, and what do you
get?
A new alcohol policy that meets
the federal requirements but does

little to change student drinking behavior
In August, administrators learned that to
maintain eligibility for federal funding, they had
to clearly prohibit unlawful drinking and drug use
on campus by Oct. 1, under the Drug-Free
Schools and Communities Act.
Weeks of frustration, debate over how to

enforce the policy and fear that resident assis
tants would be forced to police dorms for under
age drinking culminated in a new policy that,
given the federal requirements, has done an
admirable job of keeping in line with the Funda
mental Standard.
Yet after so much concern and discussion, it
seems that little will ultimately change in the res
idences and fraternities beyond token changes in
the structure of parties.
One result of the new policy has been to
encourage safer parties that comply with the law.
But beyond a few signs warning students about
state drinking laws, a few extra door monitors
and smaller and less alcohol-focused parties, any
one who wants a beer badly enough can still find
a way to get it.
The structure and size of par
ties is one area that will undergo
change. "I think we're going to
see the all-campus alcohol party
become an endangered species,"
said Adrian Miller, a resident
assistant in Donner House.
He predicted more parties will
be open to invited guests only and
that parties will become "a lot
more creative" and shy away from
a heavy alcohol focus.
All fraternities completed
training last spring in safe party
planning, but the new policy
"causes us to go an extra yard and
do more than we would've on our
own," said Interfraternity Coun

cil President Erik Jorgensen.
Fraternity members will be
more inclined to check for IDs at
parties and mark the hands of
those who can legally drink, Jor
gensen said. As for the parties at
which "easy beer" is available, he
predicted, "I think that will
change."
The Kappa Sigma fraternity
recently placed fencing in the
back of the house to ensure that
partygoers enter through the
front door, where they can be
checked for Stanford IDs and
proof of age, Kappa Sigma presi
dent Andrew Kassoy said.
Instead of closing its parties,
Kassoy said Kappa Sigma has
chosen to publicize them less than
in the past to prevent large num
bers of guests.
Some dorms are also shifting
away from large, alcohol-focused

parties.
Donner recently held a party
with a "Twister" game theme and
limited attendance to guests only,
Miller said, and reported that res
idents found it possible to eryoy
themselves while fostering a safer
drinking environment.
Other dorms may see even
fewer modifications. "In my opin
ion, nothing has changed," said
Matt Eldridge of the drinking sit
uation in Trancos, where he is an
RA. He added that the house will
continue to purchase alcohol with
dorm funds for its residents, all
freshmen.
The new policy "means noth
ing," Eldridge said. "It's a smoke
screen. I have seen no signs that it
will be strictly enforced."
In Branner Hall, if residents
choose to drink the RAs "let them
know what the California law is,

remind them of the University
policy and then leave our doors
open for questions," according RA
Morris Sim.
Some RAs said the policy will
change only how students obtain
their alcohol and where they
drink it, but not alter the quan
tity in which it is consumed.
Despite extra precautions,
eradicating underage drinking
seems highly unlikely. "I don't
think anyone can claim to do
that," Kassoy said.
The federal government may
have succeeded in getting Stan
ford to change its alcohol policy,
yet it is far from assuring that
underage students here will
abstain from drinking.
To most students, as Morgan
pointed out, the policy amounts
to little more than "an annoy
ance."
