# Chicano group supports 'techies'
## Pre-professional organization creates 'familia' atmosphere 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
They don't wear pocket protectors. And they even
have a social life.
Members of the Stanford Society of Chicano and
Latino Engineers and Scientists, who comprise a
diverse cross-section of the Chicano/Latino commu
nity, defy traditional stereotypes of antisocial
"techies. n
"When you go to the meetings, you know you're

going to see your friends — not just people in an
organization," said sophomore liaison Leticia
Gomez.
The society's stated goal is to increase the number
of Chicanos and Latinos in the academic and profes
sional areas of engineering and science. But the soci
ety, which numbers 70 members, serves another
purpose: to provide a warm and comfortable support
group to help students through the rigors of a Stan-
ford technical education.
"We want to encourage, moti
vate and retain Latinos in engi
neering and science," said presi
dent Rolando Zeled6n. "But we
also want to foster a 'familia'
atmosphere in which the mem
bers are not just numbers."
The group, which is associated
with the national Society of His
panic Professional Engineers,
sponsors numerous academic and
social programs to achieve its two
goals.
Members can receive tutoring
in engineering fundamentals such

as calculus or physics. "We want
to get the word [about tutoring]
out to the underclassmen,"
Zeled6n said. "We lose a lot of
freshmen and sophomores who
get bogged down by calculus,
physics or the 50 series," he said.
"We want them to know that
[those classes] aren't what engi
neering is all about."
Faculty members often come to
the meetings to discuss their
classes and to get to know the stu
dents. Two faculty/staff advisors
assist the group: Civil Engineer
ing Prof. James Leckie and No£
Lazano, associate dean and direc
tor of student affairs.
The six-year-old group also
offers pre-professional assistance
such as training in resume-writ

ing and in interview skills.
Through the group's shadow pro
gram, members can spend a day at
work with a professional in sci
ence or engineering.
The society also sponsors visits
of representatives from corpora
tions and agencies such as Shell
Oil, NASA and Apple Computer.
Next month, the society will co
sponsor a technical job fair with
Stanford's other minority engi
neering groups.
The society networks closely
with the 11 other universities
such as UC-Berkeley and the Uni
versity of Washington that com
prise the local region of the
umbrella national society.
Zeled6n said the officers are
working to establish a database of

science and engineering alumni.
"We feel the follow-up is impor
tant," he said.
That personal link between
people is important to the group,
members said. In keeping with its
"familia" atmosphere, the group
sponsors frequent social activi
ties. One of the group's main
goals is to encourage students to
work in groups.
"It's easier to study when
you're with friends," said member
Rosaura Sandoval, a junior.
Other social gatherings include
Tuesday study nights at El Cen
tro, TGIFs, salsa and lambada
dance lessons, intramural soft
ball, retreats, broomball and
social mixers with the other
minority engineering groups.
