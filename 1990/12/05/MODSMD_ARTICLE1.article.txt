## Stanford billed yacht costs to U.S.; revelation raises ire of congressman 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
By all accounts, Victoria, a 72-foot yacht
owned and operated by Stanford's sailing
program and moored near Oakland, is a
beautiful recreational vessel. Its interior
sports walnut and cherry paneling, marble
counters, brass lamps, mirrors and
exquisite joinery.
ror the past three years, the University
has inadvertently charged the government
for depreciation on the yacht, claiming it as
an indirect cost of federally sponsored
research conducted at Stanford.
Stanford acknowledged the error to the
government last Thursday and indicated
that it would return $184,286 to the gov
ernment. That figure represents deprecia
tion on the yacht, as well as the deprecia
tion costs of other athletic equipment that
had been billed to the government during
the last decade as a result of the same
accounting error.
While the dollar impact of the error is
relatively small — the University has recov
ered $554 million in indirect costs over the
last decade — the revelation has proven
most embarrassing for the University
Stanford's indirect cost recovery practices

are the subject of several
ongoing federal investiga
tions.
The revelation also
prompted a stinging letter
to government auditors
from Rep. John Dingell, D-
Mich., chair of the House
Subcommittee on Over
sight and Investigations,
one of the three federal

agencies examining Stanford's indirect cost
practices.
"Clearly at this time Stanford does not
even know what is being charged to the
government until the government identi
fies the mischarge on an item-by-item
basis," Dingell wrote to government audi
tors in letter dated Dec. 4.
A staff member of the subcommittee said
in an interview yesterday that the Univer
sity's error regarding the yacht was not an
isolated incident. "We know of other similar
things," he said. "I'm very confident that
we're going to come up witn a lot of charges
like this."
Sources close to the investigation say the
subcommittee is likely to hold hearings on
