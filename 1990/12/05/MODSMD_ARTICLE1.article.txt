## Stanford billed yacht costs to U.S.; revelation raises ire of congressman 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
By all accounts, Victoria, a 72-foot yacht
owned and operated by Stanford's sailing
program and moored near Oakland, is a
beautiful recreational vessel. Its interior
sports walnut and cherry paneling, marble
counters, brass lamps, mirrors and
exquisite joinery.
ror the past three years, the University
has inadvertently charged the government
for depreciation on the yacht, claiming it as
an indirect cost of federally sponsored
research conducted at Stanford.
Stanford acknowledged the error to the
government last Thursday and indicated
that it would return $184,286 to the gov
ernment. That figure represents deprecia
tion on the yacht, as well as the deprecia
tion costs of other athletic equipment that
had been billed to the government during
the last decade as a result of the same
accounting error.
While the dollar impact of the error is
relatively small — the University has recov
ered $554 million in indirect costs over the
last decade — the revelation has proven
most embarrassing for the University
Stanford's indirect cost recovery practices

are the subject of several
ongoing federal investiga
tions.
The revelation also
prompted a stinging letter
to government auditors
from Rep. John Dingell, D-
Mich., chair of the House
Subcommittee on Over
sight and Investigations,
one of the three federal

agencies examining Stanford's indirect cost
practices.
"Clearly at this time Stanford does not
even know what is being charged to the
government until the government identi
fies the mischarge on an item-by-item
basis," Dingell wrote to government audi
tors in letter dated Dec. 4.
A staff member of the subcommittee said
in an interview yesterday that the Univer
sity's error regarding the yacht was not an
isolated incident. "We know of other similar
things," he said. "I'm very confident that
we're going to come up witn a lot of charges
like this."
Sources close to the investigation say the
subcommittee is likely to hold hearings on

Dingell
Stanford's indirect cost practices
in February or March.
Larry Horton, associate vice
president for public affairs,
acknowledged that the University
considered the oversight "a seri
ous error," but he said it should be
kept in perspective.
"This problem developed in the
context of an accounting process
that involved literally millions of
transactions over a period of
almost 10 years," Horton said.
"We don't want to make excuses,
but with this kind of volume, mis
takes will happen."
Indirect costs of research are
those costs that are not easily
attributable to a particular
research project. When Stanford
researchers conduct federally
sponsored research on campus,
the government reimburses the
University for the indirect costs of
the research as well as the cost of
the research itself.
Allowable indirect costs of
research include such things as
electricity, maintenance, adminis

trative overhead and use of
libraries by researchers.
Stanford's practices have come
under extreme scrutiny in recent
months as a result of concerns
raised by Paul Biddle, the on-cam
pus representative of the Office of
Naval Research, the federal
agency that negotiates with the
University to determine its indi
rect costs.
Biddle contends that prior to
his arrival in October 1988, the
relationship between Stanford
and the government had been far
too cozy, allowing Stanford to col
lect millions of dollars in indirect
cost recovery that it may not have
been entitled to.
Biddle's concerns have
prompted a review by the Navy. In
addition, DingelTs subcommittee
has requested that the General
Accounting Office examine Stan
ford's practices as part of a larger
probe into how universities
charge the government for indi
rect costs of federally sponsored
research. GAO auditors have
become a fixture in the University
Controller's Office during the last
month.
In the letter sent to auditors,
Dingell drew a parallel between

the current investigations of
Stanford's indirect cost policies
and the high-profile probes of
major defense contractors con
ducted by his subcommittee sev
eral years ago. In 1985, Dingell's
subcommittee found that the Pen
tagon had paid $640 for a toilet
seat and that General Dynamics
had billed the Pentagon for coun
try club dues and dog kennel
boarding.
The finding on Stanford's
yacht is reminiscent of these dis
coveries, Dingell wrote. "This is
exactly the way the subcommit
tee's investigation of defense con
tractor overhead abuses began —
with the identification of a few
horror stories that led to an
indictment of the entire system,"
Dingell wrote.
"Initially, contractors in the
defense industry also claimed that
outrageous charges to the taxpay
ers were merely aberrations.
Later audits proved them wrong
— the practice was indeed
widespread."
University Legal Counsel
Debra Zumwalt called Dingell's
analogy unfair. "I don't expect
this to be a horror story," she said.
Zumwalt said those in Stanford's

Controller's Office who handle
indirect costs issues are among
the most respected in the nation.
The University obtained Victo
ria as part of its boat donation
program. A "donor" sold the yacht
to Stanford's sailing program in
December 1987 for $100,000, a
price far below the appraised
value of the boat. The sailing pro
gram took out a loan from the
University to make the purchase.
Currently, the yacht is for sale
to the public at a price of
$475,000; the profit will help fund
the University's sailing program.
Due to a depressed market for
large boats, Stanford has been
unable to sell the the Victoria,
according to Blake Middleton,
director of Stanford's sailing pro
gram.
Stanford's varsity sailing team,
the Athletic Department's sailing
and windsurfing classes and the
Stanford Sailing Association,
which provides recreational
opportunities for students, fac
ulty, staff and alumni, all fall
under the organizational
umbrella of the sailing program.
The largest boat owned by the
program, Victoria is used for

recreational purposes, mostly on
weekends, by members of the
Stanford Sailing Association. It is
not used in any sailing team com
petitions.
Concerns about the yacht first
surfaced publicly in a Peninsula
Times Tribune story in late
September. The story quoted an
anonymous source, now widely
believed to be a staff member of
the Dingell subcommittee, saying,
"We don't want to be paying for
putting in tennis courts, or for a
65-foot yacht or for someone's
salary who doesn't even work at
the University anymore."
After Leila Kahn, a staff mem
ber of the Dingell subcommittee,
visited campus and raised the
same issue, Horton sent her a let
ter, dated Oct. 25, responding to
her concern. In his letter, Horton
contended that the 72-foot yacht
did "not affect charges to the gov
ernment in any way."
According to subcommittee
staff, further prodding by GAO
officials uncovered the error.
Stanford officials contend the
error was discovered as part of a
review of indirect cost allocations
by the Controller's Office.

On Nov. 29, Horton wrote a
second letter to Kahn, acknowl
edging that an error had been
made. "Although we believed that
the information I provided you
(on Oct. 25) was accurate — we
recently learned that it was in
error," ho wrote.
The same day, Janet Sweet of
the Controller's Office sent a let
ter to Biddle, the ONR campus
representative, informing him of
the error and assessing its finan
cial impact.
Determining the University's
indirect costs of research is a com
plicated, time-consuming task,
University officials say. Allowable
indirect costs of running the Uni
versity are identified and allo
cated to various cost pools. The
University and the government
have agreed on what percentage
of each cost pool can be charged to
research.
Victoria and some other equip
ment donated to or purchased by
the Athletic Department during
the last decade were inadvertently
included in one of these costs
pools — the equipment deprecia
tion pool — and charged to the
federal government as an indirect
cost of doing research here.
