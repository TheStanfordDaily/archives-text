### Howard Libit Staff writer 
A female Stanford undergradu
ate was sexually assaulted in Gov
ernor's Corner early Friday morn
ing after being stalked by an
unidentified assailant.
The assault occurred on the
north side of Sterling Quad in
Governor's Corner between
Robinson and Schiff Houses at
about 1 a.m., according to Stan
ford Police Sgt. Dell Bandy.
The assailant grabbed the vic
tim from behind in a surprise
attack, Bandy said. Using a red
marker, he drew an "X" on her
upper chest. The attack lasted
about two minutes, Bandy noted.
The victim received no physical
injuries and was not raped, Bandy
said.
"Based on statements made by
the suspect to the victim (during
the attack), we ruled that it was a
sexual assault," Bandy said.
The suspect is described as a 6-
foot male of medium build. At the
time of the alleged assault, he was
wearing dark clothing and a ski
mask, according to the victim.
Police believe that the suspect
deliberately chose his victim and
that the assault was not a random
attack.
"Our investigation has deter
mined that this suspect knew a lot
about the victim, such as her rou
tines and where she lives," said
Bandy. "The information shows
that this suspect definitely chose

this victim specifically.
"There is not someone out
there that everyone has to worry
about," Bandy added.
Police refused to elaborate on
many of the details in the case for
fear of jeopardizing their investi
gation. Bandy said nolice are con
tinuing to pursue leads and are
interviewing residents of the sur
rounding dorms.
After the attack, police blocked
off the area between Robinson
and Schiff for several hours to
search for clues.
Along with Governor's Corner
Residence Dear Mary Haynes and
Robinson resident fellows Susan
and Richard Nolen-Hoeksema,
Bandy held an open meeting Fri
day evening in the Robinson
lounge to ask for assistance in the
investigation and to reassure resi
dents that the attack was not ran
dom.
In the meeting, several stu
dents said they thought the area
where the attack occurred was
poorly lit. While Bandy agreed
that the lighting of the area
should be re-evaluated, he said
that crime scene was actually
well-lit.
The victim is currently off
campus and is doing well as police
continue to search for the suspect,
Bandy said.
Bandy urged people who were
in the area of the attack between
midnight and 1 a.m. Friday to
contact him at the police station,
723-9633.
