# Latest draft of new alcohol policy contains only a few minor changes
## 
### Holly Hacker Staff writer 
Students will be greeted next quarter
by a fully implemented and enforced alco
hol polity that differs little from the draft
version submitted last month, containing
only a few format changes, according to
administrators.
Stanford's Controlled Substances and
Alcohol Policy, in its most recent form,
was submitted to acting Dean of Student
Affairs Norm Robinson yesterday by Act

ing Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Diana
Conklin and Assoc. Dean of Student
Affairs Michael Jackson.
After Robinson reviews the polity and
makes any additional suggestions or
changes, the polity will be enacted begin
ning winter quarter. Students and faculty
will be sent copies of the policy.
Jackson said he and Conklin "tight
ened up the language" of the policy but
changed "nothing that is really meyor."
He added, "I think there has been general
acceptance that we're headed down the

right road" with the policy.
As required by the federal Drug-Free
Schools and Communities Act, Stanford
had to revise its alcohol policy to prohibit
the unlawful use and possession of alco
hol and other drugs in order to continue
receiving federal funding.
The only significant change made to
the draft policy was clarifying the differ
ence between suggested guidelines for
complying with the policy and actual
applications of the policy, Jackson
explained.

Attached to the draft policy was a sec
tion titled "Guidelines for Event Plan
ners," which stated that University funds
could not be used in a way that violated
the policy, that planners would be held
responsible for holding events in compli
ance with the policy and that residences
or student organizations that violated the
policy would be subject to discipline as a
group.
Jackson said some students read the
three statements as mere suggestions and
not enforceable stipulations of the policy.

He and Conklin therefore renamed the
section "Policy Applications" and
included it as part of, and not attached to,
the policy.
Like other rules of student conduct,
the policy will be governed by the Funda
mental Standard.
While Robinson said he had not yet
read the latest version of the policy, he
predicted, "I don't think that the essence
of it and the thrust of it are going to
change."
