Strict gun control fails in New York
NEW YORK (AP) — New York City is closing out its bloodiest
year on record: more than 2,000 murders so far, and December —
traditionally one of the deadliest months — has barely begun.
Despite some of the strictest gun control laws in the nation,
including a 180 day waiting period, Police said the death toll has
already surpassed last year's record of 1,905.
The count included the mass-murder 87 people who were
killed when a man set fire to a social club in March with a can of
gasoline.
This year's count of more than 2,000 reflected the first 11
months of the year, according to unofficial statistics released
Monday. Thirteen people were murdered Saturday and Sunday
nights, the first two days of December, police said.
Police criticized for Miami riot
MIAMI (AP) — Merchants criticized police response as they
angrily cleaned up yesterday from a night of looting and fires trig
gered by the acquittal of six police officers in the fatal beating of
a Puerto Rican drug dealer.
Police Chief Peny Anderson said police could have moved in
earlier. But he defended his department, saying there were no
deaths or violent clashes with police.
"The police knew it was going to happen and they just sat back
and did nothing, absolutely nothing," said Richard Munoz, who
owns Los Hispanos Supermarket.
Munoz said his small grocery store was not damaged because
he scared off the looters.
"I spent all night armed and on the roof," Munoz said.
Cutting prices, not fat
CHICAGO (AP) — Fast food is getting cheaper, especially
when compared to Stanford University Food Service.
With McDonald's, Taco Bell and Burger King outlets on many
street corners and retail strips, industry analysts say price is
eclipsing convenience as the main selling point.
Taco Bell and Wendy's are at the front of the price-cutting
movement, known in the industry as "value pricing."
Some customers at a downtown Chicago Taco Bell said the
lower prices encourage them to eat more — and even spend more
— than they used to.
"I had three tacos today. I usually get two, maybe one," said a
woman who identified herself as A. Bradley. "I guess if the price
is lower, your stomach can take more."
Coca-Cola decides to save the world
ATLANTA (AP) — Soft drink giant Coca-Cola served up one
for the environment yesterday, making an announcement that
they plan to sell their products in recycled plastic bottles.
The cola maker became the latest to join the corporate race to
please an increasingly environmentally conscious market. If
approved by the Food and Drug Administration, soft-drink bottles
would become one of the first cases in which recycled plastic is
used in direct contact with food.
