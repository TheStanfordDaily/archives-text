MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (AP)
— President Bush yesterday
firmly rejected recommendations
from former Pentagon chiefs to
give sanctions against Iraq at least
a year to work before resorting to
military force.
Bush, on the second day of a
salute-to-democracy tour across
South America, expressed doubt
that "sanctions alone would bring
(Iraq's Saddam Hussein) to his
senses."
The United Nations resolution
authorizing force against Iraq
unless it withdraws from Kuwait
by Jan. 15 was "loud and clear,"
Bush said. "But I don't think Sad
dam Hussein yet understands
that."
"The best hope for peace is for
him to understand that all means
— all means — necessary to fulfill
these resolutions will be used
against him," Bush said at a news
conference with Uruguayan Pres
ident Luis Alberto Lacalle.
The Persian Gulf crisis was at
the top of his agenda as Bush
arrived here from Brazil for talks
with Lacalle and an address to
Congress. Several hundred leftist
demonstrators protested outside
as Bush spoke to the lawmakers.
As Bush spoke, former Defense
Secretary Robert S. McNamara
added his voice to the list of wit
nesses before the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee urging cau
tion in the stand against Iraq.
"Who can doubt that a year of
blockade will be cheaper than a
week of war?" said McNamara,
who led the Pentagon during the
U.S. buildup in Vietnam.
Bush firmly rejected sugges
tions from two former chairmen
of the joint chiefs — Gen. David
Jones and Adm. William Crowe —
that he give sanctions against Iraq
up to 18 months to work before
resorting to force. Senate
Democrats also have urged Bush
to stick with the sanctions.
"I don't agree with them,"
Bush said. "I can't say how long
(sanctions should be tested) but I
don't agree with them."
Bush endorsed remarks Sun
day by Secretary of State James A.

'I'm not in a negotiat
ing mood or anything
of that nature when I
meet with Aziz,' Bush
said.

Baker 111, who said the United
States would not attack Iraq if it
withdrew from Kuwait and com
plied with all UN. peacemaking
resolutions. "I did not have any
problem with that at all," the
president said.
Bush indicated he would take a
tough stand when he meets at the
White House with Iraq's Foreign
Minister Tariq Aziz on the gulf
crisis. He said he would not allow
any linkage with the Palestinian
issue and Israeli occupation of the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
"I'm not in a negotiating mood
or anything of that nature when I
meet with Aziz," Bush said.
Bush said the sanctions have
been costly to Uruguay, as well as
other countries, as oil prices
climbed and export markets to
Iraq and Kuwait were closed.
"And yet you never flinched,
your country never flinched, you
never wavered in support of these
U.N. sanctions," Bush, the first
American president to visit
Uruguay since Lyndon Johnson in
1967, told the lawmakers.
Tcwlay, Bush will head across
the River Platte to Buenos Aires,
mopping up from a failed revolt
within the Argentine military.
Bush said he did not view Mon
day's uprising as a sign that
democracy is fragile in Argentina.
He said he would salute President
Carlos Menem for his leadership
and economic reforms.
Argentina has dispatched two
warships to the Persian Gulf, the
only Latin nation to join the
multinational force. OPEC-mem
ber Venezuela, the last stop on
Bush's trip, has stepped up oil
production to help fill the gap in
world supplies.
Bush opened his visit here by
proclaiming "a new era in U.S.-

Latin American relations."
"We in the Americas are on the
brink of something unprece
dented in world history — the
first wholly democratic hemi
sphere," Bush said.
"And in anticipation of that,
we need to create together a per
manent partnership among all the
nations of the Americas," he said.
Bush and Lacalle both spoke of
the importance of lifting barriers
to international trade, including
farm subsidies. Trade talks are
now in their final days in Brussels
in the effort to rewrite the global
trading rules last forged in
Uruguay in 1986.

"We are in the same boat in
this GATT negotiations," said
Lacalle, who said protectionist
barriers and subsidies have "hurt
millions of people."
"We foresee a whole hemi
sphere of much more open trade,"
said Bush, who exhorted develop
ing countries to "move briskly to
privatization, to free markets"in
order to attract investments and
new technology.
Bush said "we are not locked
on a specific figure" on how
deeply farm subsidies should be
cut. "We are locked on the fact
that there has to be inclusion of
all categories (of products)."

up to 18 months to work before
resorting to force. Senate
Democrats also have urged Bush
to stick with the sanctions.
"I don't agree with them,"
Bush said. "I can't say how long
(sanctions should be tested) but I
don't agree with them."
Bush endorsed remarks Sun
day by Secretary of State James A.

'I'm not in a negotiat
ing mood or anything
of that nature when I
meet with Aziz,' Bush
said.

Baker 111, who said the United
States would not attack Iraq if it
withdrew from Kuwait and com
plied with all UN. peacemaking
resolutions. "I did not have any
problem with that at all," the
president said.
Bush indicated he would take a
tough stand when he meets at the
White House with Iraq's Foreign
Minister Tariq Aziz on the gulf
crisis. He said he would not allow
any linkage with the Palestinian
issue and Israeli occupation of the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
"I'm not in a negotiating mood
or anything of that nature when I
meet with Aziz," Bush said.
Bush said the sanctions have
been costly to Uruguay, as well as
other countries, as oil prices
climbed and export markets to
Iraq and Kuwait were closed.
"And yet you never flinched,
your country never flinched, you
never wavered in support of these
U.N. sanctions," Bush, the first
American president to visit
Uruguay since Lyndon Johnson in
1967, told the lawmakers.
Tcwlay, Bush will head across
the River Platte to Buenos Aires,
mopping up from a failed revolt
within the Argentine military.
Bush said he did not view Mon
day's uprising as a sign that
democracy is fragile in Argentina.
He said he would salute President
Carlos Menem for his leadership
and economic reforms.
Argentina has dispatched two
warships to the Persian Gulf, the
only Latin nation to join the
multinational force. OPEC-mem
ber Venezuela, the last stop on
Bush's trip, has stepped up oil
production to help fill the gap in
world supplies.
Bush opened his visit here by
proclaiming "a new era in U.S.-

Latin American relations."
"We in the Americas are on the
brink of something unprece
dented in world history — the
first wholly democratic hemi
sphere," Bush said.
"And in anticipation of that,
we need to create together a per
manent partnership among all the
nations of the Americas," he said.
Bush and Lacalle both spoke of
the importance of lifting barriers
to international trade, including
farm subsidies. Trade talks are
now in their final days in Brussels
in the effort to rewrite the global
trading rules last forged in
Uruguay in 1986.

"We are in the same boat in
this GATT negotiations," said
Lacalle, who said protectionist
barriers and subsidies have "hurt
millions of people."
"We foresee a whole hemi
sphere of much more open trade,"
said Bush, who exhorted develop
ing countries to "move briskly to
privatization, to free markets"in
order to attract investments and
new technology.
Bush said "we are not locked
on a specific figure" on how
deeply farm subsidies should be
cut. "We are locked on the fact
that there has to be inclusion of
all categories (of products)."

noon In Montevideo.
MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (AP)
— President Bush yesterday
firmly rejected recommendations
from former Pentagon chiefs to
give sanctions against Iraq at least
a year to work before resorting to
military force.
Bush, on the second day of a
salute-to-democracy tour across
South America, expressed doubt
that "sanctions alone would bring
(Iraq's Saddam Hussein) to his
senses."
The United Nations resolution
authorizing force against Iraq
unless it withdraws from Kuwait
by Jan. 15 was "loud and clear,"
Bush said. "But I don't think Sad
dam Hussein yet understands
that."
"The best hope for peace is for
him to understand that all means
— all means — necessary to fulfill
these resolutions will be used
against him," Bush said at a news
conference with Uruguayan Pres
ident Luis Alberto Lacalle.
The Persian Gulf crisis was at
the top of his agenda as Bush
arrived here from Brazil for talks
with Lacalle and an address to
Congress. Several hundred leftist
demonstrators protested outside
as Bush spoke to the lawmakers.
As Bush spoke, former Defense
Secretary Robert S. McNamara
added his voice to the list of wit
nesses before the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee urging cau
tion in the stand against Iraq.
"Who can doubt that a year of
blockade will be cheaper than a
week of war?" said McNamara,
who led the Pentagon during the
U.S. buildup in Vietnam.
Bush firmly rejected sugges
tions from two former chairmen
of the joint chiefs — Gen. David
Jones and Adm. William Crowe —
that he give sanctions against Iraq
up to 18 months to work before
resorting to force. Senate
Democrats also have urged Bush
to stick with the sanctions.
"I don't agree with them,"
Bush said. "I can't say how long
(sanctions should be tested) but I
