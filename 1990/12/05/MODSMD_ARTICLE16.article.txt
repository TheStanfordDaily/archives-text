# Plane collision investigated

### 
ROMULUS, Mich. (AP) - The
captain of a DC-9 that collided in
fog with another jetliner on an
airport runway, killing eight peo
ple, returned to the cockpit only
last week from a five-year medical
leave, officials said yesterday
Investigators were trying to
determine whether the Northwest
Airlines captain, William
Lovelace, or his first officer,
James F. Schifferns, was at the
controls Monday when it ran into
a Boeing 727 racing for takeoff at
Detroit Metropolitan Airport.
Schifferns, who spent 20 years
in the Air Force, was hired by
Northwest in March, his first job
in commercial aviation.
National Transportation
Safety Board investigators said
they were looking at such factors
as human error, weather and
equipment as possible causes of
the accident.
A fireball fed by fuel burned
away the top of the Pittsburgh
bound DC-9 after the right
wingtip of the Northwest 727 tore

open the DC-9's fuselage and dis
lodged an engine.
Noxious fumes killed seven
men and a woman among the 43
people aboard the DC-9, said
Wayne County Chief Medical
Examiner Bader Casein. Seven
people remained hospitalized, two
of them in critical condition.
I.C. Payne, a passenger on the
DC-9, said he couldn't see much
out his window and just remem
bers a piece of shrapnel striking
him on the head.
"It nearly knocked me out of
my seat," said Payne, a quality
inspector for General Electric
based in Fort Wayne, Ind. "The
first thing I did was reach up to
see if all my head was still on.
Then I heard someone in the front
of the plane yell out that the
engine just blew."
NBC news reported last night
that it had obtained partial tran
scripts of an exchange between an
air traffic controller and the DC-9
cockpit.
That exchange showed the con

troller asking the pilot to verify
his position. I
The collision occurred near the
end of runway 3C, which leads
directly into runway 21C. The
DC-9 turned right off a taxiway
into runway 3C and into the path
of the 727, officials said.
Another Northwest spokes
man, Bob Gibbons, said the flight
was Lovelace's first without
another pilot observing since he
returned to flying Nov. 25. He
spent five years on medical leave
for kidney stones, Gibbons said.
Recordings of cockpit conversa
tions were being analyzed
yesterday in Washington.
The Memphis-bound 727 had
153 people aboard. Some suffered
minor scrapes and bruises when
sliding down emergency slides.
Romulus, 10 miles from
Detroit, was the site of the second
worst air crash in U.S. history, the
Aug. 16, 1987, crash of a North
west MD-80 on takeoff. That
crash killed 156.
