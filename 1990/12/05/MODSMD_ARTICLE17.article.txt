# Supreme Court reaffirms right to an attorney
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - A
Supreme Court ruling reinforcing
the right of criminal suspects to
legal representation is an impor
tant deterrent to police coercion,
claims the lawyer who won the
case.
"I view the opinion as a signifi
cant reaffirmation of the rights"
of the accused, said attorney
Floyd Abrams, who handled the
appeal of Mississippi death row
inmate Robert S. Minnick.
"I'm not surprised the court
has determined that after some
one in custody requests counsel
that counsel must be present at all
subsequent interrogations,"
Abrams said.
By a 6-2 vote Monday, the jus
tices overturned Minnick's mur
der conviction because police
questioned the suspect without
his lawyer present.
The court said that unless a
previously questioned suspect
asks to talk to police, they may not
renew questioning in the absence
of his lawyer — even after the sus
pect and attorney have conferred.
The high court previously had
barred police from resuming the
questioning of a suspect who asks
to see a lawyer for the first time,
unless the suspect initiates the
conversation.
The court's dissenters said the
ruling protects the guilty and
unduly hamstrings police.

The Justice Department, which
had urged the court to uphold
Minnick's conviction, declined
comment on the ruling.
In other actions Monday, the
Supreme Court:
— Rejected the appeal of a Cal
ifornia community college accused
of unlawful censorship for block
ing the on-campus performance of
a racially charged.
The justices, without com
ment, rejected arguments by the
college officials that the lawsuit
should be killed.
The case raises the question of
whether college administrators
have the same broad power as
public high school officials to limit
freedom of speech in school-spon
sored activities.
The California dispute began in
June 1986 when Alan Dißona, a
drama teacher at San Diego Com
mmunity College, planned a class
production of "Split Second."
The play is about a black New
York City police officer who fatally
shoots a white suspect after the
suspect has taunted him with
racial slurs and epithets.
—Agreed to use a case from
Florida to decide whether police
who have an owner's permission
to search a car must get a court
warrant before opening any con
tainers inside the vehicle.

employees claiming they were
fired so their employers would not
have to pay pension benefits. The
court ruled unanimously that
fired employees may sue in federal
court, but not in state courts for
potentially larger punitive dam
ages.
—Ruled by a 6-3 vote in a case

that a federal anti-counterfeiting

The Mississippi confession case
provided at least a mild surprise
in that Justice Anthony M.
Kennedy wrote the court's opin
ion.
Kennedy dissented in 1988
when the court threw out a bur
glary conviction because police
questioned a suspect who had
invoked his right to a lawyer. The
issue in that case was whether the
suspect could be quizzed about a
crime other than the one for

which he was arrested.
But on Monday, Kennedy said,
"Whatever the ambiguities of our
earlier cases on this point, we now
hold that when counsel is
requested, interrogation must
cease, and officials may not reini
tiate interrogation without coun
sel present, whether or not the
accused has consulted with his
attorney."
The decision relied largely on a
1981 high court ruling that barred
police from reinitiating
questioning of a suspect who has
asked for but not yet talked to a
lawyer. Monday's ruling extends
that protection to instances in
which a suspect already has con
ferred with an attorney.
Kennedy said the purpose of
both rulings is to discourage
police from badgering a defendant
into giving up the right to a lawyer
provided by the court's landmark
Miranda ruling in 1966.
But Justice Antonin Scalia, in a
dissenting opinion joined by Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist,
called the ruling a "misguided"
expansion of constitutional rights
that will discourage "an honest
confession."
The ruling produces "a verita
ble fairyland castle of imagined
constitutional restriction upon
law enforcement," Scalia said.
Justice David H. Souter did not
take part in the case.
