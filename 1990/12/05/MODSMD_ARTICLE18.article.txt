NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Con
tinental Airlines is using come
dians to lighten the atmo
sphere on some flights this
week, but they're not allowed
to make jokes about the com
pany's bankruptcy court filing.
Peter Bales, one of five
comics chosen, said the air
line's financial troubles were
t he least of his worries. Turbu
lent skies on the Newark-New
Haven, Conn., route on Mon
day forced the stand-up come
dian to deliver his 10-minute
shtick sitting down.
"It's difficult to be funny
when you're try not to vomit,"
Bales said in a telephone inter
new yesterday from his home
in Northport, N.Y.
On Monday, the airline said
it would continue normal oper
ations while it seeks protection
from creditors under Chapter
11 of the federal bankruptcy
laws. The nation's fifth-largest
airline said a $2.2 billion debt
and increased jet fuel costs due
to the Persian Gulf crisis forced
the move.
Continental first served up
cabin comedy on its Detroit-
Cleveland route in August, said
spokeswoman Nancy Compel.
This week, its Continental
Express division is offering

stand-up comedians and busi
ness speakers on its 46-seat
commuter service to New
Haven — the serious stuff in
the mornings and the funny
stuff in the afternoons.
"It's going well," Compel
said yesterday. "Travelers
seem to enjoy it, even though It
was a little bit rough and our
comedian had to sit down."
The comedians were advised
last week to keep the cabin
humor clean and not make
jokes about airplanes.
On Monday, Compel said,
she "told them the news of the
day"and reminded them to
"stay away from inappropriate
material."
Bales said he avoided nega
tive airline jokes, but added
that he generally says what he
wants.
He began by warning heck
lers they would be asked to
leave. Then he griped about the
gig, saying there were "two
guys with headphones" in hi*
dressing room.
The jokes were delivered
while he was strapped into hia
seat, with his head craning
down the aisle to catch a glint
mer of response over the noisy
engines.
