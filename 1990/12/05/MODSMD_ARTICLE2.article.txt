# SLAC to lay off 50 in first of personnel, program cuts
## 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
The Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter will lay off more than 50 workers in
the next three months because of a short
fall in federal funding, Director Burton
Richter announced last week.
Layoffs in SLAC's electronics depart
ment will be followed by layoffs through
out the federally funded research center
Due to federal cuts, SLAC's 1991 bud
get is $10 million less than 1990's $150

million budget. In a Nov. 27 memo dis
tributed to SLAC's 1,300 employees,
Richter said the difference will be made
up through personnel and program
reductions.
"We have decided that to reduce costs,
to remain scientifically productive and
technologically competitive, and to plan
for the future, we must make some signif
icant operational changes in the organiza
tion, n the memo stated.
Lee Lyon, director of personnel, said
the 120-member electronics department's

importance has decreased now that labo
ratopr research is focused on SLAC's cen
terpiece, the Stanford Linear Collider.
"We almost surely will have to make
other reductions," he added.
According to Richter's memo, SLAC
intends to enact the layoffs fairly. How
ever, members of the United Stanford
Workers — which represents about 425
lab workers — are already protesting the
personnel cuts.
"The layoff is unjust," USW field rep
resentative Reuben Serna said yesterday

at a noon meeting that attracted over 70
union and non-union SLAC workers.
SLAC administrators, whom he accused
of mismanaging the budget and staff, are
"tping to make the workers pay for their
mistakes."
However, according to Lyon, "We cer
tainly plan on doing this with as much
compassion and caring and fairness as we
can."
Serna scud the USW wants to see that
SLAC complies with the legal terms of its
contract with the USW. including the

issuing of 30-day layoff notices.
Lyon said workers will be given at least
that much warning.
According to Richter's memo, workers
will receive information about severance
pay, benefits and alternative employment
at SLAC or on campus. Though attrition
and the elimination of unfilled vacancies
and contract employees will assist the
restructuring, Richter said some layoffs
must occur.
