## The end of debate?
### 
Political correctness
accused of stifling
intellectual freedom

IN A NOV 26 EDITORIAL, The
Wall Street Journal made an
alarming assertion about the
nature of intellectual debate on the
nation's college campuses.
The Journal feels such debate
has all but disappeared.
What's more disturbing is the
blame the Journal directs at fac
ulty and administrators, accusing
them of indoctrinating their stu
dents with "Politically Correct
views."
Is the Stanford campus Politi
cally Correct?
If so, then there is cause for
alarm, since Political Correctness
is an ideology that demands that
people subscribe to it or be
attacked for their dissent.
"Political Correctness," the
Journal writes, "requires that stu
dents, faculty, and administrators
project 'right' opinions about
women, sexism, race and the
numerous other categories of victi
mology. ..
; "The chief victim of this effort
is, of course, intellectual freedom."
; One cannot help wondering
whether the creation of a Gender
Studies requirement and an Amer
ican Cultures requirement was the
result of critical thinking or simply
the product of a Politically Correct
Faculty Senate.
There is nothing inherently
wrong with having opinions which
happen to coincide with those in
the Politically Correct dossier.
Everything is wrong with hold
ing such opinions simply because
they are the "right" opinions. It
Would be terrible if members of the
Faculty Senate voted for the

changes solely for fear of being
labeled unsympathetic to the his
tory of women or non-white Amer
icans.
Yet a stifling of debate, whether
or not it occurred within the Fac
ulty Senate, seems to have
occurred on the campus as a whole.
The difficulty of some individual
interactions and lack of meaning
ful debate on certain subjects point
to a subtle pressure to think "cor
rectly" â€” or be considered to have
invalid opinions.
This pressure could eventually
undermine Politically Correct ide
als by driving opposition under
ground, and perhaps by causing a
dangerous backlash.
Universities are places where
thought processes and opinions
should be constantly scrutinized
and rethought. The moment we
begin to accept ideas without first
challenging their validity repre
sents the interment of intellectual
ism.
Moreover, there is no evidence to
suggest that an adoption of a moral
high ground, as practiced by the
Politically Correct, is an effective
means for remedying inequities.
If anything, the opposite i3 true.
The Journal writes, "White males
have been identified by the Politi
cally Correct as history's primary
force of oppression." Maybe so, but
how sympathetic is an individual
white male likely to be when he is
constantly held accountable for the
collective guilt of all white males,
ever?
What is clear is that no one
should adhere to an opinion with
out thinking it through for himself
or herself.
Also clear is that no group of
people has the right to stifle debate
on an issue simply because it sees
no alternative. Progress requires
debate, which, in turn, demands a
difference of opinion.
