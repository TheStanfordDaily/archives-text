## Violence in our time 
### 
UNLEASHING A PRIMORDIAL
fury, the man lifts a typewriter
skyward and slams it down onto
the woman's head. Onlookers squeal with
delight as blood streams from the gashes
in her skull.
Defying the mortal blow, she pounces
on him and smashes his head through a
glass window. He presses his thumbs sav
agely into her eye sockets, inspiring unre
strained cheering in the crowd. Breaking
free, she pulls out a pistol and shoots him.
He lunges at her, clasping her head in
both hands and pounding it repeatedly
into the floor as those watching roar with
approval.
I won't say how this confrontation
ends, since you might still be planning to
see the new movie in which it appears, an
adaptation of Stephen King's "Misery."
For me, it was an unexpectedly horrifying
experience. Less because of the violence
than the audience's exuberant response
to it.
I felt like Winston Smith in George
Orwell's "1984" during a "Two Minutes
Hate" session. As in Oceania, where the
Party uses giant telescreen images of
alternating enemies to drive its citizens
into a frenzy, it seemed remarkably easy
for the filmmakers to manipulate the
audience seated around me. Of course,
their task was made easier by the fact
that people went to the show seeking to
be manipulated. We paid to get scared.
And we were.
But then there was more: we were
given a chance to get even. To hate the vil
lain who had scared us. And to cheer for
the violence inflicted on her. It's as if

Hitchcock's "Psycho" ended not with
Norman's schizophrenic dialogue in the
police station, but with a graphic torture
scene in which he is punished, say, by the
extraction of his eyeballs and fingernails.
We haven't quite gotten to that point
yet, but the sadistic edge to recent cine
matic violence seems to go beyond stylis
tic updating. Like rock music fans who
require higher and higher decibel levels to
stimulate their progressively damaged
eardrums, moviegoers are numb to tradi
tional violence (barroom fistfights, are
you kidding?) and require ever more
shocking scenes to be moved.
"Misery" obliges with a particularly
nauseating scene. Anne Wilkes, the
demented nurse and self-proclaimed #1
fan of writer Paul Sheldon, has taken him
captive in her secluded farmhouse. Deter
mined to prevent him from escaping, she
"hobbles" him by tying him down and
shattering his ankles with a sledgeham
mer. We get to savor this in the clinical
slow-motion now customary for violent
climaxes.
The New York Times review of "Mis
ery" referred to another scene in which
Anne uses an electric carving knife to
remove one of Sheldon's body parts, yet
this did not appear in the version I saw.
Maybe preview audiences actually started
vomiting on the theater floors and a last
minute edit was made.
But if such violence manages to shock
its audience, this only magnifies the sud
den emotional swing toward wild, vindic
tive exuberance when the story's villain is
assaulted. The audience starts to sound
like a mob, so caught up in hate that it

forgets it is watching the murder of a
human being, or at least an extremely
realistic portrayal thereof.
Is our society capable of separating
fact from fiction? The crowd outside Ted
Bundy's execution roared "Burn, Bundy,
Burn!", exhibiting a particularly unnerv
ing kind of vindictive catharsis that goes
far beyond mere support for the death
penalty. And the crime wave we are riding
features new levels of remorseless brutal
ity, as seen in "wilding" incidents.
It is debatable whether violence in film
actually increases its incidence in society.
But even if it only mirrors, rather than
causes, the violent impulses in our cul
ture, we should take note.
When we return from winter recess,
less than two weeks will remain before
the deadline of the U.N. ultimatum to
Saddam Hussein. A war fever may begin
to build at that point. Whatever one
thinks about the rationale for such a war,
I'm sure we can all agree that any deci
sion must be based on sober reasoning,
rather than manipulation of some emo
tional yearning for a vindictive, and vio
lent, catharsis.
After what I witnessed at the movies
last night, I am less confident that sobri
ety will reign.

I felt like Winston Smith in George
Orwell's "1984" during a "Two Minutes
Hate" session. As in Oceania, where the
Party uses giant telescreen images of
alternating enemies to drive its citizens
into a frenzy, it seemed remarkably easy
for the filmmakers to manipulate the
audience seated around me. Of course,
their task was made easier by the fact
that people went to the show seeking to
be manipulated. We paid to get scared.
And we were.
But then there was more: we were
given a chance to get even. To hate the vil
lain who had scared us. And to cheer for
the violence inflicted on her. It's as if

Hitchcock's "Psycho" ended not with
Norman's schizophrenic dialogue in the
police station, but with a graphic torture
scene in which he is punished, say, by the
extraction of his eyeballs and fingernails.
We haven't quite gotten to that point
yet, but the sadistic edge to recent cine
matic violence seems to go beyond stylis
tic updating. Like rock music fans who
require higher and higher decibel levels to
stimulate their progressively damaged
eardrums, moviegoers are numb to tradi
tional violence (barroom fistfights, are
you kidding?) and require ever more
shocking scenes to be moved.
"Misery" obliges with a particularly
nauseating scene. Anne Wilkes, the
demented nurse and self-proclaimed #1
fan of writer Paul Sheldon, has taken him
captive in her secluded farmhouse. Deter
mined to prevent him from escaping, she
"hobbles" him by tying him down and
shattering his ankles with a sledgeham
mer. We get to savor this in the clinical
slow-motion now customary for violent
climaxes.
The New York Times review of "Mis
ery" referred to another scene in which
Anne uses an electric carving knife to
remove one of Sheldon's body parts, yet
this did not appear in the version I saw.
Maybe preview audiences actually started
vomiting on the theater floors and a last
minute edit was made.
But if such violence manages to shock
its audience, this only magnifies the sud
den emotional swing toward wild, vindic
tive exuberance when the story's villain is
assaulted. The audience starts to sound
like a mob, so caught up in hate that it

forgets it is watching the murder of a
human being, or at least an extremely
realistic portrayal thereof.
Is our society capable of separating
fact from fiction? The crowd outside Ted
Bundy's execution roared "Burn, Bundy,
Burn!", exhibiting a particularly unnerv
ing kind of vindictive catharsis that goes
far beyond mere support for the death
penalty. And the crime wave we are riding
features new levels of remorseless brutal
ity, as seen in "wilding" incidents.
It is debatable whether violence in film
actually increases its incidence in society.
But even if it only mirrors, rather than
causes, the violent impulses in our cul
ture, we should take note.
When we return from winter recess,
less than two weeks will remain before
the deadline of the U.N. ultimatum to
Saddam Hussein. A war fever may begin
to build at that point. Whatever one
thinks about the rationale for such a war,
I'm sure we can all agree that any deci
sion must be based on sober reasoning,
rather than manipulation of some emo
tional yearning for a vindictive, and vio
lent, catharsis.
After what I witnessed at the movies
last night, I am less confident that sobri
ety will reign.
