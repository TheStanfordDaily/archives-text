## Would you risk your life fighting in a war you support? 
### 
MARC EVANS' LETTER regard
ing the inappropriateness of the
ASSU resolution opposing
Bußh's Gulf policy (The Daily, Nov. 28)
disturbed, angered and agitated me
enough to write a response.
What bothered me was the section
that read: "I think that the presence of
U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf is a very
good idea and I also think that with
drawing those troops would be a huge
mistake. And while I would like to avoid
war if at all possible, I realize that some
times war is a necessary action, and so
would even support an offensive strike
against Iraq if the economic embargo
fans."
Reagan*B barb to Carter during the
Presidential debates — "There you go
again" — kept running through my
head, although I probably should be
thinking "There we go again."
It isn't Evans' view that a military
response to Saddam is needed and is
likely to be the most effective way to
resolve the crisis that upsets me.
I don't agree with this opinion and am
deeply troubled by the escalated con
frontations and expanding objectives
that Bush has set in motion. But reason

able and even wise people can disagree;
differing opinions generally help to pro
duce a better conclusion. Instead, I am
annoyed with Evans' failure to address
another question.
The best — dare I say most responsi
ble — question is not do you support a
war in the Middle East but will you fight
in one? Men and women of the U.S.
armed forces are going to die, and many
more Iraqi men, women and children
will also die.
If you think that the goals are impor
tant enough and the interest vital
enough to justify war, then you ought to
put your life at risk for them. Are you
willing to risk your life?
The army takes volunteers every day.
Nothing is stopping you except the inter
ests, goals, passions, dreams, loves,
thrills and appetites of your life. Never
theless, this zeal you have for life is
something that you share with people
from all over the world, including Iraqis
and U.S. military personnel.
If you think that the real world
requires them to risk death, then you
must be willing to do so too. Anything
less is immoral.
I am aware that many of you will
think me simplistic and naive. You may

think that the issue is much more com
plex and needs to be addressed less per
sonally. I don't. My arguments stand on
their own. Still, I will dress it up academ
ically for you.
In "Maternal Thinking," Sara Rud
dick offers a most penetrating critique of
just war theory. When human beings are
placed in categories of combatants and
civilians, they are abstracted from the
lives they lead and from the bodies in
which they exist. Just war theory loses
touch with the real lives that are being
sacrificed.
Ruddick argues that morally this con
nection must be maintained. Surpris
ingly, this insight does not lead her to
pacifism. She claims that a person may
be morally justified in killing another.
Still, one must never forget that it was a
loving, caring, forgiving, dreaming per
son that you killed. Moral thinking and
acting demands that much of yotk.
Adam Wolman wrote a more discern
ing editorial for the New York Times
entitled "We're Feeling the Draft." In it,
Wolman personally confronts the
prospect of his being drafted to fight in a
Middle Eastern war.
He writes: "We start to realize we're
thinking like pacifists, drawing the line

not in the sand but in the head and
heart. As cowards (for we're quite aware
that to many these words are synony
mous), we know that we never could
swallow the concept of a knuckle-to-bone
confrontation as a means of settling a
dispute...."
"The process becomes far too cruel,
horrible, infinitely brutal for us cowards
to take. I can stomach a fight between
good and evil until I see a fighter, good or
evil, in a puddle of blood. And that's
what it all comes down to when you get
it up close."
As a pacifist, I know that pacifism
takes more courage than Wolman real
izes. He hasn't had much experience
with pacifism and is just beginning to see
courage in a new light. But I admire the
way he makes it personal.
People die personally. People take
responsibility personally. In the real
world, there is no other way. After you
have wrestled with these issues, I will
listen more intently to whether and why
you support a war.
