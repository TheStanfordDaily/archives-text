# Israeli president had no right to criticize media
## 
### 
As an alumnus and a reader of The
Daily from time to time, I would like to
comment on a recent issue which report
ed tihe visit of Israeli President Chaim
Heiizog.
IJlis criticism of media writers telling
the truth and television showing actual
happeningß is incredible.

We witnessed night after night the
shooting of teenagers for throwing rocks,
the blowing up of Palestinian houses,
helicopters deporting Palestinian men
(breaking up their households) and the
invasion of Lebanon, where American
furnished bombs were destroying build
ings, hospitals and schools.
What right does Herzog have to come
to this country and our university and
criticize our media for showing and
reporting the truth?
I wonder if George Shultz and his
friend Herzog discussed the 1982 inva
sion of Lebanon, which slaughtered
35,000 innocent civilians, maimed anoth-

er 35,000 and left 300,000 homeless.
These are the kind of facts that appar
ently Herzog doesn't believe should be
discussed or publicized at a seat of learn
ing such as Stanford. His reference to
killings in India was irrelevant and no
reason for the media to be silent about

Israel's actions.
Furthermore, why should Herzog
bring religion into the matter by catego
rizing "Islamic fundamentalism" as a
danger to the world — when the impact
of Jewish religious fundamentalism on
Israeli politics is one of the main reasons
we have no peace in the Middle East.
I only hope that Shultz is teaching the
objective facts about the U.S. handling of
the Israeli-Palestinian controversy, even
though his tenure as Secretary of State
is responsible for Israel's intransigence
towards any peace efforts.
