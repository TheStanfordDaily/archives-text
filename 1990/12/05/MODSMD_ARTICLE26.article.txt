## Peter Duus New DR requirements will increase breadth of education at Stanford 
### 
CHANGES IN THE UNIVER
SITY'S distribution requirement
system approved by the Faculty
Senate on Thursday have aroused appre
hensions, and misapprehensions, among
many students. Let me try to allay anxi
eties, in Bug-like fashion, by answering
Questions that have come up during the
ebate on the revisions.
Won't the new requirements reduce
intellectual breadth in the DR system ?
No. The new requirements will provide
more social, cultural, historical and geo
graphical breadth without greatly sacri
ficing disciplinary breadth. The new
World Cultures requirement, for exam
ple, mandates attention to the 80 percent
of the human race not covered in the cur
rent Cultures, Ideas and Values require
ment.
What about collapsing existing Areas
4 and 5? Won't that reduce student expo
sure to the behavioral and social sci
ences?
Slightly, perhaps. However, it seems
likely that most students will continue to
take introductory courses like Economics
1, Psychology 1 and other large courses
that they have used to satisfy those area
requirements in the past. And many of
the courses certified to satisfy the new

World Cultures and American Cultures
requirements — perhaps most of them —
will be in the social sciences or behavioral
sciences.
Won't the addition of another DR
course impose a special burden on engi
neering students 1
Yes, it probably will. The demands of
megor requirements are usually heavier
for engineering students than for those
majoring in the humanities and sciences.
For this reason, and perhaps many oth
ers, engineering students deserve our
sympathy. At the same time, as faculty
have pointed out over the years, there is a
benefit in requiring all students, what
ever their specialized fields, to share a
common intellectual core curriculum.
Will the new requirements force stu
dents to learn "politically correct" atti
tudes ?
Of course not. Courses will be certified
to satisfy the new DRs in the same way
the current DR courses are. The Commit
tee on Undergraduate Studies Subcom
mittee on Distribution Requirements will
determine which courses count, and one
important task of that committee is to
ensure that courses are neither included
nor excluded on narrow political or ideo
logical grounds.

Isn 't the adoption of the new DR areas
an attempt to use the curriculum for the
purposes of"social engineeringV
No, not if "social engineering" means
trying to push social behavior and social
change in a certain direction. In content,
courses certified under new DR areas are
no more or less likely to produce particu
lar social outcomes that courses on ele
mentary physics or elementary eco
nomics.
Students can make whatever use they
wish of the knowledge, methods of analy
sis and cognitive skills they acquire in
these courses. DR courses provide stu
dents with intellectual tools, not social
blueprints.
Don't the new DR areas overlap with
the shift made to the CIV requirement two
years ago ?
Very little, and certainly far less than
the current Literature and Fine Arts or
the current Philosophical, Social and
Religious Thought requirements overlap
with CIV Reading "The Tale of Gei\ji" in
the CIV Literature track is no substitute
for taking a course on the history and cul
ture of Japan. On the other hand, one
could argue that taking the three quarter
CIV Philosophy track is equivalent to sat
isfying the current Area Three require

ment three times.
Is there any overarching rationale for
the new DR system ?
Yes. It is the same rationale for the
existing system. The DR system should
encourage students to explore a broad
range of disciplines and areas of knowl
edge. It should also help prepare students
to become informed, intelligent and
responsible members of their society.
Won't the new DR requirements
restrict students' freedom of choice?
Yes, but so does the current system.
Is a process of piecemeal or incremen
tal revision the best way to shape a distri
bution system ?
In my view, probably not, but that's
the way we seem to do things around
here. The current system was assembled
in an incremental way, as were the
changes that resulted in CIV Perhaps
next time, the faculty will decide to start
from scratch in designing a new DR sys
tem.
Does that mean that the revised DR
system will not remain in place perma
nently?
Not if history is any guide. During the
16 years I have been at Stanford, there
have been two DR systems in place, or
two and a half if you count CIV

Change, however, is not necessarily a
bad thing. The DR system embodies fac
ulty judgments about what is important
for students to learn and know. As the
boundaries of knowledge change, those
judgments are bound to change, too,
A DR system that was appropriate for
the 1930s or the 1960s might not be
appropriate for the 19905. There is no
"perfect" or "right" DR system. There are
only systems that try to embody the fac
ulty's pedagogical priorities. And Stan
ford is certainly not unique among its
peer institutions in periodically reconsid
ering and reshaping its core curriculum
What would the founders of the Uni
versity think about the revisions?
Beats me, but there may be a clue in a
remark made by David Starr Jordan at
the University's dedication ceremony.
Higher education, he observed, should
"help to free [students] from the dead
hands of old traditions and to enable
them to form opinions worthy of the new
evidence each new day brings them."
Draw your own conclusions.
