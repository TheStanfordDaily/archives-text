# Letter comparing Israeli and Iraqi acts was unfair, distorted the facts
## 
### 
Erin Clune and Mohamad Ali's letter
claiming that two students distorted the
facts concerning Israel's acquisition of
the West Bank and Gaza Strip is also a
distortion of the facts of the 1967 Arab-
Israeli War (The Daily, Nov. 29).
Clune and Ali claim that Iraq was not
involved in the war. This is not true. The
Iraqi Air Force participated in the war.
They attacked Israel on the afternoon of
the first day of the war and their air
units were subsequently attacked by
Israel. Additionally, Iraq moved forces
into Jordan, but they arrived too late to
participate. Israel had already destroyed
Arab forces on the Jordanian front.
It is true that Israel launched a "pre
ventive" first strike. What Clune and Ali
fail to mention is that the Arab countries
were the first to mobilize for this war.
Nasser ordered the United Nations
Emergency Force to withdraw from the
1948-1956 cease-fire line. Iraq began
moving forces into Jordan days before
the Israeli attack.
Additionally, the Arabs blockaded the

Strait of Tiran. Israel had announced
earlier that it would go to war if any of
the above conditions existed. Israel's pre
emptive strike was an act of self-defense
in the face of imminent attack.
While I do not condone Israel's occu
pation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
it is understandable that they consider
this land an important security zone.
One should remember that the Israelis
also captured the Sinai Peninsula during
this war. An accord with Egypt led to the
return of this land. Perhaps the same
will someday happen with the West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
Anyone desiring to draw parallels
between the Iraqi and Israeli occupations
should take into account all the facts.
Kuwait lost its sovereignty in the wake
of Iraqi aggression. Nothing similar
occurred during the 1967 Arab-Israeli
War.

I am writing in response to a letter in
the Nov. 29 Daily in which two students
attempted to clarify the events of the
1967 Arab-Israeli war and to show that
Israel should be condemned in the same
way as Iraq for its recent aggression.
I don't think Clune and Ali are very
fair in their assertions. First of all, Israel
acquired the West Bank because King
Hussein of Jordan decided to conclude a
military pact with Egypt and Syria just
before the outbreak of war. Thus, Israel
had no choice but to fight a mobilized
Jordanian military force and to occupy
the West Bank. Without the military
pact, the Israelis would have had no real
reason to fight Jordan.
Secondly, unlike the Kuwaitis, the
Palestinians have shown that they are
violent and aggressive through continu
ous acts of terrorism against Israel since
its independence in 1948 and most
recently through the multiple attacks on
Israeli civilians in the past month. The
nature of Palestinian aggression and vio

lence has forced Israel to maintain secu
rity zones in the West Bank and else
where since the 1967 war to protect its
borders.
Iraq has never experienced this kind
of aggression at its borders; it has no
need of Kuwait as a security zone.
Therefore the two occupations cannot
seriously be compared. Further, Clune
and Ali claim that Iraq was not involved
in the 1967 war, when, in fact, Iraqi
troops were sent to Jordan to aid in what
was to be the final downfall of Israel.
I do not wish to deny that there have
been regrettable violations of human
rights in the occupied territories. We can
only hope that a successful solution will
be found that accommodates both sides.
But I think it is only fair that people
consider and understand the circum
stances surrounding the Israeli occupa
tion before condemning Israel and Iraq
in the same breath.
