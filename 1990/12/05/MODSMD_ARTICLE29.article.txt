Kingdom

To call Amy Hempel's latest
book a collection of short stories is
misleading. "At the Gates of the
Animal Kingdom" consists of 16
shorts without story, the shortest,
"In the Animal Shelter," barely
filling two-thirds of a page. Amy
Hempel writes in anecdotes and
images, and therefore needs no
room for plot development.
The narrators of all 16 stories
are female. These are women of
different ages, personalities and
concerns: an elderly woman dis
tressed by cruelty to animals, a
young girl in her first affair, a
bride and bridesmaid who seem to
have dated only men named Jim.
Hempel's first sentences are
self-consciously absurd; she wants
your attention, and is not subtle
about getting it."The year I began
to say vahz instead of vase, a man
I barely knew nearly accidentally
killed me."
For better or worse, Hempel
has a flair for the quirky. She uses
phrases like "The Pepto-Abysmal
room" and "Attorney-at-Last." If
this kind of play on words makes
you wince, be forewarned: there's
more to come.
Hempel's style is insightful on
the verge of incomprehensible.
She rarely uses description in its
traditional form. More often than
not, you won't know what the

main characters look like, or even
their names. Deciphering Hemp
el's writing takes work; "The Day
I Had Everything," about a
woman waiting to have surgery
for breast cancer, is particularly
difficult to "get."
Hempel emphasizes that each
sentence and each word has a sig
nificance far beyond its dictionary
meaning. In"The Harvest," a
story of a young woman who is
injured in a car accident, she adds
an 'aside' to the reader explaining
how the story was written. Here
she includes the details she omit
ted from the original story

because she felt they were not
believable; "I leave a lot out when
I tell the truth,"says Hempel.
Puns and twists on old cliches
play up the humor in the most
tragic stories. In"The Most Girl
Part of Me," about a teenage girl's
first love, she describes her
boyfriend's reaction to his
mother's death: "That was before
his mother died. She died eight
days ago. She did it herself. Big
Guy showed me the rope burns in
the beam of the ceiling. He said,
'Anyplace I hang myself is
home.'"
Out of context, this passage

sounds atrocious. Although the
surrounding mood of the story
softens it a little, Hempel's inten
tion here and elsewhere in the
book is clearly to provoke uncom
fortable laughter.
Hempel knows what she is
doing — even the "bad" puns are
not accidental. If at times she is in
danger of being too clever, of
upstaging the emotions of a char
acter with a cute word-play, she is
excused by the final product.
