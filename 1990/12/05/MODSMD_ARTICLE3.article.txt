# Police chief blasts crime rate ranking
## Stanford No. 4 in nation, paper says 
### Michael Friedly Editorial staff 
A USA Today report this week
ranked Stanford as having the
fourth highest overall crime rate
among college campuses, but
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Her
rington denounced the figure as
misleading and inaccurate.
The USA Today figures were
computed by determining the
total number of crimes per 1,000
students for campuses across the
nation. With 91 crimes per 1,000
students, Stanford was ranked
behind Yale University, Georgia
Institute of Technology and
Emory University.
"The Stanford University cam
pus, by any measurable standard,
would have to be considered a safe
and peaceful place," Herrington
said in a statement released yes
terday.
"Safety is a relative thing. It's
pretty difficult to come up with a
way of comparing different cam
puses," he said.

Herrington criticized the sur
vey for not taking into account
certain factors that are unique to
Stanford. "It's not relevant to
compare [crime statistics] school
to-school when the setting is so
different," he said yesterday.
He pointed out that the USA
Today survey failed to differenti
ate between violent crimes and
property crimes. Only seven vio
lent crimes were reported last
year at Stanford; the rest were
crimes against property.
Of the seven violent crimes,
two were forcible rapes, one was a
robbery and four were aggravated
assaults. By comparison, last year
there were 55 violent crimes
reported at UC-Berkeley.
Herrington said the fact that
the rates were calculated as
crimes per 1,000 students is prob
lematic. Although Stanford has
about 13,000 students, its total
population is about 30,000, all of
whom report crimes to the Stan
ford Police. This total figure
includes faculty and staff, depen
dents of students, private home
owners and employees at the
Stanford Shopping Center and the
industrial research park on Page
Mill Road.

"I don't know of any campus
that has a significant population
that is not students, except for
us," he said.
In addition, since most stu
dents live on campus, the reported
crime rate is much higher here.
"All of your personal property is
here. If something is stolen, then
you are going to report it," Her
rington said.
