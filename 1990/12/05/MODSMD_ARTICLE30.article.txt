The Human Being: A War
rior's Journey Towards
Peace and Mutual Healing
By Steve Mason
Touchstone, $9.95, 110 pages
Steve Mason was an Army cap

tain and a decorated Vietnam
combat veteran, and he is also the
Poet Laureate of the Vietnam Vet
erans of America. He previously
wrote "Johnny's Song" and "War
rior For Peace."
This is a new collection of
poems, divided into four sections.
They grapple various aspects of
life — the plight of Amerasians in
"Father! Father!" and the
encounter between Mason and a
Soviet ex-soldier in "No Milk For a
Poet."
Freaks: We Who are Not as
Others
By Daniel Mannix
Research, $12.95, 124 pages ;
Not quite perfect for the holi
day season, this book definitely
manages to raise an eyebrow or
three, if only for its explicit pho
tography. The visual element defi
nitely dominates this book, as pin
heads, apemen and Siamese
twins, among others, are dis
played with some relish.
The author has uncovered
these masterpieces of the macabre
from his personal collection, iund
concludes this bizarre work with a
most enlightening chapter; —
"How to be a Freak." Any ques
tions? >
