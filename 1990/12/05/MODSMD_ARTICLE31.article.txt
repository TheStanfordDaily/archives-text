While her name may not be as hyped as
that of Diane Fossey and her gorillas,
Jane Goodall is in many ways an even
more impressive character. By a strange
twist of fate, she was transformed from a
secretarial school graduate to an amateur
ethologist by Louis Leakey in 1960.
Young, inexperienced, and barely qual
ified, she set out into the forests of Tanza
nia to study chimpanzees as a possible
clue to human behavioral patterns. She
ended up staying 30 years.
In her recent book, "Through A Win
dow," Goodall picks up where her last
book left off, expanding upon her discov
eries of chimp behavior and chronicling
the last twenty years of the Kasakela

chimp community. While she has now
received a doctorate from Cambridge and
become a respected member of the scien
tific community, her book is most cer
tainly for the layman as well as the scien
tist and artfully preserves the wonder and
excitement with which she first
approached her assignment.
When Goodall first embarked upon her
study, "In 1960, it was not permissible . .
. to talk about an animal's mind... . Nor
was it quite proper to talk about animal
personality." Through much of her own
research and campaigning, it is now
widely recognized that chimpanzees are
the closest relatives to the human, not
only physiologically, but differing only a
little more than 1 percent in DNA struc
ture.
Knowing the close evolutionary link
which we ail share with chimps, it is no
surprise Goodall is so fascinated with
their ways of understanding and with her
crusade to establish animals as intelligent

beings who are invaluable tools for learn
ing about ourselves.
Despite the importance of the fact that
chimpanzees are links to human evolu
tionary history, it is clear from the begin
ning that these are more than just sub
jects in an objective study; they are per
sonalities, companions with whom she
has spent the better part of her adult life.
Goodall's commitment to the chim
panzees runs much deeper than the
mindless pursuit of science; it is also
fueled by an intense desire to understand
the chimps in their own right. When she
writes, "Often I have gazed into a chim
panzee's eyes and wondered what was
going on behind them," the reader is sud
denly aware of the force that has driven
her to continue for 30 years.
The book itself is a series of these
investigations behind the chimps' eyes.
She devotes chapters to all of the princi
pal members of the group, demonstrating
their unique personalities while giving

the book a novel-like feel.
After 30 years of research, it is no won
der she should know the relations of the
group so well. What made little sense
after just 10 years of research now comes
to have meaning and justification. She
documents the rise and fall of competing
groups of chimps, battles for dominance
within the group, sordid tales of cannibal
ism and attack, mating relations, and
simple anecdotes with accuracy and intel
ligence.
In many ways, the interactions of the
Kasakela community are a microcosm of
human relations. Goodall believes that,
"Knowing that chimpanzees possess cog
nitive abilities once thought unique to
humans, knowing that they ... can rea
son, feel emotions and pain and fear, we
are humbled."
This leads to a firm belief that chim
panzees do not belong as research ani
mals, performers, or pets. An entire chap
ter and an appendix are devoted to this

subject, and Good all lashes out at -the
mistreatment and abuse which these ani
mals receive. >*

This type of writing makes the bQok
not only a scientific document, but! the
personalized account of a woman wh6rhas
given much of her life to the study and
advancement of non-human prirraftes.
While her prose may not always be "the
most eloquent and her own opinions
about chimps come to overburden-
reader at the end, these are the character
istics which make Goodall most endear
ing.
Undoubtedly, she is a scientific author
ity in her field; however, it is her attach
ment to the chimps themselves and her
extensive knowledge of their personalities
which makes "Through A Window" inter
esting.

ethologist by Louis Leakey in 1960.
Young, inexperienced, and barely qual
ified, she set out into the forests of Tanza
nia to study chimpanzees as a possible
clue to human behavioral patterns. She
ended up staying 30 years.
In her recent book, "Through A Win
dow," Goodall picks up where her last
book left off, expanding upon her discov
eries of chimp behavior and chronicling
the last twenty years of the Kasakela

chimp community. While she has now
received a doctorate from Cambridge and
become a respected member of the scien
tific community, her book is most cer
tainly for the layman as well as the scien
tist and artfully preserves the wonder and
excitement with which she first
approached her assignment.
When Goodall first embarked upon her
study, "In 1960, it was not permissible . .
. to talk about an animal's mind... . Nor
was it quite proper to talk about animal
personality." Through much of her own
research and campaigning, it is now
widely recognized that chimpanzees are
the closest relatives to the human, not
only physiologically, but differing only a
little more than 1 percent in DNA struc
ture.
Knowing the close evolutionary link
which we ail share with chimps, it is no
surprise Goodall is so fascinated with
their ways of understanding and with her
crusade to establish animals as intelligent

beings who are invaluable tools for learn
ing about ourselves.
Despite the importance of the fact that
chimpanzees are links to human evolu
tionary history, it is clear from the begin
ning that these are more than just sub
jects in an objective study; they are per
sonalities, companions with whom she
has spent the better part of her adult life.
Goodall's commitment to the chim
panzees runs much deeper than the
mindless pursuit of science; it is also
fueled by an intense desire to understand
the chimps in their own right. When she
writes, "Often I have gazed into a chim
panzee's eyes and wondered what was
going on behind them," the reader is sud
denly aware of the force that has driven
her to continue for 30 years.
The book itself is a series of these
investigations behind the chimps' eyes.
She devotes chapters to all of the princi
pal members of the group, demonstrating
their unique personalities while giving

the book a novel-like feel.
After 30 years of research, it is no won
der she should know the relations of the
group so well. What made little sense
after just 10 years of research now comes
to have meaning and justification. She
documents the rise and fall of competing
groups of chimps, battles for dominance
within the group, sordid tales of cannibal
ism and attack, mating relations, and
simple anecdotes with accuracy and intel
ligence.
In many ways, the interactions of the
Kasakela community are a microcosm of
human relations. Goodall believes that,
"Knowing that chimpanzees possess cog
nitive abilities once thought unique to
humans, knowing that they ... can rea
son, feel emotions and pain and fear, we
are humbled."
This leads to a firm belief that chim
panzees do not belong as research ani
mals, performers, or pets. An entire chap
ter and an appendix are devoted to this

subject, and Good all lashes out at -the
mistreatment and abuse which these ani
mals receive. >*

This type of writing makes the bQok
not only a scientific document, but! the
personalized account of a woman wh6rhas
given much of her life to the study and
advancement of non-human prirraftes.
While her prose may not always be "the
most eloquent and her own opinions
about chimps come to overburden-
reader at the end, these are the character
istics which make Goodall most endear
ing.
Undoubtedly, she is a scientific author
ity in her field; however, it is her attach
ment to the chimps themselves and her
extensive knowledge of their personalities
which makes "Through A Window" inter
esting.

outside her window.
