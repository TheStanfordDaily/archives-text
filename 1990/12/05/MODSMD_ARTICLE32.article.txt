## Stop sniffling: Prevention and treatment of the Dead Week cold 
### June Cohen Editorial staff 
It's Dead Week.
You have a cold. You feel lousy.
So what else is new?
Between cramming, blowing
your nose and whining to your
mother over the phone, you decide
to take action and invest a few dol
lars in cold medicine.
Good move — but the next step
is even more important — decid
ing which medication to purchase.
Your first impulse may be to
purchase a supposed panacea —
the medicine which promises to
cure the greatest amount of symp
toms. After all, you feel pretty
lousy, and if you don't have a
cough yet, you might have one

tomorrow, so you might as well
buy the all-in-one drug, right?
Wrong.
According to Dr. Cheryl Gold,
an internist at the School of
Medicine, "shotgun" medicines
intended to combat every symp
tom may cause unwanted side
effects, which is particularly
annoying if you don t even have
the symptom the ingredient is
intended to relieve.
Also, drugs intended to cope
with multiple symptoms might
not even have enough of any sin
gle ingredient to do the best job
against what's bothering you, she
added.
"If you have a slight headache
and nasal congestion, for example,
buy a remedy which targets those

symptoms. You don't need a drug
that is also touted to relieve a
cough," Gold said.
Although colds are an integral
(yet avoidable) part of Dead Week,
Gold advises that some cold-like
symptoms are warnings that the
problem may be more serious and
medical care should be sought.
Gold recommends contacting
your physician if you develop a
fever above 101 degrees, a severe
sore throat and swollen neck

glands, facial pain and a thick
nasal discharge or a cough lasting
more than two weeks.
Prevention
And of course, there's the age
old adage, "An ounce of..
To prevent getting a cold in the
first place, Gold recommends
"wash[ing] your hands. That's the
best way to stop the spread of the
infection. Rhinovirus, the most
common cold virus, is most easily
transmitted from one person to
another by hand-to-hand con
tact."
"The virus is common in the
eyes and nose. If you have a cold
and touch your face, you could
transmit the virus to someone else
if they touch their eyes or nose

after you shake their hand," she
said.
And, from one sleep-debt
stricken student to another —
going to bed at a reasonable hour
can't hurt either. Fatigue is one of
mtyor factors lowering the
body's resistance to viral infec
tion.
As for vitamin C, the evidence
of its benefits is contradictory.
Some authorities claim that tak
ing 1,000 - 2,000 milligrams of
vitamin C daily is effective in pre
venting a cold.
Other sources indicate that, at
the onset of a cold, taking 600-625
milligrams of vitamin C every
three hours may be successful for
treatment (although how you
break 1,000 mg tablets into incre

ments of 625 is beyond me).
A well-balanced diet is also cru
cial to the immune system, so you
should make an effort to move
past the beer/pizza and
coffee/muffin ruts that students
often fall into.
And I might as well put in a
plug for the healing capacity of
good-old-fashioned chicken soup.
(I'd heartily recommend the mat
zoh-ball soup at Max's Opera
Cafe, which is too good to be
authentic.)
But whining to Mom always
works best for me.
