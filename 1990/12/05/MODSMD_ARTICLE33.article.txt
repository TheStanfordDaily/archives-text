# Buy, sell, trade: Weighing your options for a Macintosh upgrade
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Across the hall from you a friend has
just unpacked her new Macintosh Ilsi.
You watch as she plugs it in, turns on 13
inches of living color and starts com
puting at warp speed.
Quickly, your attention shifts back
toward your desk. There sits a pokey SE
you bought a couple years back. You're
envious, but not so much that you can't
think straight. "What if I upgrade my
Mac?" you think.
What if, indeed. Depending on which
Mac you own, you have a lot of options,
including selling your computer and
buying a new one, purchasing a genuine
Apple upgrade, or looking at third-party
alternatives. As always, each option has
its pluses and minuses. The space below
is devoted to examining the alterna
tives.
Before considering any upgrade, you
must ask yourself "Do I need more Mac
than I already have?" If all you do is sit

down and word process a
few times a week, you
probably don't need more
than you already have.
Or your existing com
puter just might need a
shot in the arm. A hard
drive, for example, brings
you speed, convenience
and file organization —
you'll never use floppies
again. Alternatively, if

you simply want to be able to run more
than one program at a time, you might
simply buy more memory, which can be
had cheaply these days, to allow you to
run Multifinder.
Assuming you know you need a more
powerful Mac, you'll often find it cheap
er to upgrade some circuitry rather
than swap your entire machine.
Say, for instance, you want to soup
up your Mac Plus. A trade-in will net
you less than $500 — not even enough
to buy a Classic. However, for $1,200
(street prices may be lower) Total Sys-

tems will sell you a Gem
ini 020 Plus with a math
coprocessor and a fast
SCSI port for your hard
disk. With the Gemini
board in place, your Plus
will outrun an SE/30.
For $2,600, a Gemini
030 Plus will actually
paste a Ilci. Holy quick
Macintosh, Batman!
Accelerators are also

available for the SE, including several
that will match the performance of the
Gemini boards for the Plus. Prices are
often lower because the SE comes with
an expansion slot while accelerators for
the Plus require you to clip them to the
microprocessor.
Incidentally, let a qualified techni
cian install these unless you're sure you
know what you're doing. (And if you
open a Plus or SE, you void any war
ranty that may still be in effect.)
SE owners can also have the logic
boards replaced in their computers with

genuine SE/30 models. If you have the
old 800K drives, you can also have a
Super Drive put in as well. Unfortunate
ly, the price of the upgrade remains
mystifyingly high at $1,200 for the
board and $400 more for the drive.
Consider that the Bookstore will
upgrade your ancient Mac II to a state
of-the-art Ilfx for $2,200 plus memory
and disk drive, and one has to wonder if
some folks in Cupertino just forgot they
were supposed to lower the price of the
SE-to-SE/30 upgrade.
But I digress. If you want a genuine
SE/30 and have an SE and a hefty
chunk of change, sell your SE — fast.
The resale value of the SE has
dropped 25 percent since the introduc
tion of the Classic. But if you sell now to
Elite Computers in Cupertino (408-
725-1556) or Maya Computer in Waits
field, Vt. (800-541-2318), you'll get
between $600 and $850 for it depending
on whether you have regular drives,
Super Drives and/or a hard disk.
Microdisc will then gladly sell you an

SE/30 with a pristine 40-megabyte hard
disk, guaranteed System 7 compatibili
ty and a one-year warranty, all for
$2,023 plus tax.
Incidentally, the resale for SE/30s
runs between $1,700 and $1,800 if
you're looking to move even further
upscale. For that matter, those fortu
nate enough to own the Ilci can vault it
past Ilfx performance for a cool $2,000
with a 50MHz Daystar Power Card.
Clearly, the plethora of options is
more than enough to set your head
spinning. When sorting out your choic
es, seek advice from the consultants at
Academic Information Resources, the
folks at Computer Ware or Mac World
and Mac User magazines.
More power for your Mac can go a
long way toward relieving the aggrava
tion generated by a slow, underpowered
computer. Keep in mind that to run
System 7 you need a 68030 based
machine or a 68020 one with a PMMU
chip (ask your accelerator dealer for
details).

Apple upgrade, or looking at third-party
alternatives. As always, each option has
its pluses and minuses. The space below
is devoted to examining the alterna
tives.
Before considering any upgrade, you
must ask yourself "Do I need more Mac
than I already have?" If all you do is sit

down and word process a
few times a week, you
probably don't need more
than you already have.
Or your existing com
puter just might need a
shot in the arm. A hard
drive, for example, brings
you speed, convenience
and file organization —
you'll never use floppies
again. Alternatively, if

you simply want to be able to run more
than one program at a time, you might
simply buy more memory, which can be
had cheaply these days, to allow you to
run Multifinder.
Assuming you know you need a more
powerful Mac, you'll often find it cheap
er to upgrade some circuitry rather
than swap your entire machine.
Say, for instance, you want to soup
up your Mac Plus. A trade-in will net
you less than $500 — not even enough
to buy a Classic. However, for $1,200
(street prices may be lower) Total Sys-

tems will sell you a Gem
ini 020 Plus with a math
coprocessor and a fast
SCSI port for your hard
disk. With the Gemini
board in place, your Plus
will outrun an SE/30.
For $2,600, a Gemini
030 Plus will actually
paste a Ilci. Holy quick
Macintosh, Batman!
Accelerators are also

available for the SE, including several
that will match the performance of the
Gemini boards for the Plus. Prices are
often lower because the SE comes with
an expansion slot while accelerators for
the Plus require you to clip them to the
microprocessor.
Incidentally, let a qualified techni
cian install these unless you're sure you
know what you're doing. (And if you
open a Plus or SE, you void any war
ranty that may still be in effect.)
SE owners can also have the logic
boards replaced in their computers with

genuine SE/30 models. If you have the
old 800K drives, you can also have a
Super Drive put in as well. Unfortunate
ly, the price of the upgrade remains
mystifyingly high at $1,200 for the
board and $400 more for the drive.
Consider that the Bookstore will
upgrade your ancient Mac II to a state
of-the-art Ilfx for $2,200 plus memory
and disk drive, and one has to wonder if
some folks in Cupertino just forgot they
were supposed to lower the price of the
SE-to-SE/30 upgrade.
But I digress. If you want a genuine
SE/30 and have an SE and a hefty
chunk of change, sell your SE — fast.
The resale value of the SE has
dropped 25 percent since the introduc
tion of the Classic. But if you sell now to
Elite Computers in Cupertino (408-
725-1556) or Maya Computer in Waits
field, Vt. (800-541-2318), you'll get
between $600 and $850 for it depending
on whether you have regular drives,
Super Drives and/or a hard disk.
Microdisc will then gladly sell you an

SE/30 with a pristine 40-megabyte hard
disk, guaranteed System 7 compatibili
ty and a one-year warranty, all for
$2,023 plus tax.
Incidentally, the resale for SE/30s
runs between $1,700 and $1,800 if
you're looking to move even further
upscale. For that matter, those fortu
nate enough to own the Ilci can vault it
past Ilfx performance for a cool $2,000
with a 50MHz Daystar Power Card.
Clearly, the plethora of options is
more than enough to set your head
spinning. When sorting out your choic
es, seek advice from the consultants at
Academic Information Resources, the
folks at Computer Ware or Mac World
and Mac User magazines.
More power for your Mac can go a
long way toward relieving the aggrava
tion generated by a slow, underpowered
computer. Keep in mind that to run
System 7 you need a 68030 based
machine or a 68020 one with a PMMU
chip (ask your accelerator dealer for
details).

Across the hall from you a friend has
just unpacked her new Macintosh Ilsi.
You watch as she plugs it in, turns on 13
inches of living color and starts com
puting at warp speed.
Quickly, your attention shifts back
toward your desk. There sits a pokey SE
you bought a couple years back. You're
envious, but not so much that you can't
think straight. "What if I upgrade my
Mac?" you think.
What if, indeed. Depending on which
Mac you own, you have a lot of options,
including selling your computer and
buying a new one, purchasing a genuine
Apple upgrade, or looking at third-party
alternatives. As always, each option has
its pluses and minuses. The space below
