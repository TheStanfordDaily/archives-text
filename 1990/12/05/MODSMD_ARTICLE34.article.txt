# Bugs reflect on glass, paper and the 'abortion pill'

Q, What exactly is RU-486,
• and how does it work ?
A. Not to be confused with RX
• 7, R2D2, or Formula 409,
RU-486 is a drug made by the
French company Roussel-Uclaf
(hence its name). It is sold under
the name "mifepristone" as a drug
for terminating pregnancies, and
works by blocking the function of
the hormone progesterone.
Nicknamed by many as the
"abortion pill," RU-486 is used in
France as an alternative to surgi
cal abortions. It is being used
there in 25 to 30 percent of volun
tary terminations and has a suc
cess rate of 96 percent when given
with another hormone, prost
aglandin.
RU-486 is a chemical analog of
the hormone progesterone. It
binds to the progesterone recep
tors on the surface of cells and

prevents them from responding to
that hormone.
Progesterone is the main signal
for the continuation of pregnancy,
so blocking that signal results in a
series of events leading to the
expulsion of the embryo.
As with a normal miscarriage,
RU-486 can induce expulsion of
the embryo and endometrial lin
ing, accompanied by uterine
bleeding. This bleeding lasts an
average of nine days.
RU-486 has other possible
medical applications. Animal tests
show that it can be taken to
induce labor at term, as well as to
increase lactation (milk secre
tion). Furthermore, it may be
used to treat certain types of
breast and brain cancer.
Although it has yet to be tested
in the United States, California's
Attorney General, John Van de
Kamp, is working on a way to
allow testing in this state using a
1987 law — bypassing the long
process of approval by the Federal
Food and Drug Administration.

. Why is it that you can see
Vy .through glass — what
makes it different from, say,
paper, which is opaque, and
metal, which reflects ?
A. When you start talking
• about light, you can't avoid
talking about Quantum Mechan
ics, a subject so complicated and
bizarre tnat even God doesn't
understand it.
Physicists may claim to under
stand it, but we at Science Bug
Labs feel that they are just bluff
ing. We plan to continue in this
fine tradition.
The short answer is that you
can see through it because it is
both colorless and transparent.
But that's just restating the ques
tion in technical terms — another
time-honored scientists' dodge.
Glass is colorless because all
wavelengths of visible light pass
through it without being
absorbed. Visible light is absorbed
when its photons interact with the
electrons in the absorbing

molecule. If the photon has just
the right amount of energy to
excite the electrons into a particu
lar excited state, that photon is
absorbed.
The energies of the excited
states of a molecule are deter

mined by which atoms are in the
molecule and the way they are
bonded.
Photons of visible light do not
have enough energy to excite the
tightly-held electrons in the glass
up to any excited states, so the
photons pass right through, and
the glass appears colorless.
Glass is transparent because
the light that passes through it is
not scattered by any cracks or
imperfections in it.
At almost any interface
between two different materials,
light is reflected as it passes from
one material to the other. This is
why cracks in glass (interfaces
between the glass and the air in
the crack) appear silvery —
they're reflecting some of the light
that hits them.
If you had ajar full of powdered
glass, light would not get through
it because it would be scattered in
all directions by the zillions of
glass-air interfaces and never
make it to the other side.

The reflections from metal are
a very different story because of
the unusual distribution of elec
trons in a metal. Here the atoms
are bathed in a sea of free-roam
ing electrons. These loose elec
trons make metals good electrical
conductors and create an almost
infinite number of excited states
accessible to visible light.
Here the astute reader may
ask, "If metal interacts with all
wavelengths of light, then why
isn't it black, like charcoal? Good
question, smarty-pants, but the
physicists have an answer — the
metal spits the photon right back.
Metal, unlike charcoal, is a con
ductor, so the electric and mag
netic fields of the incoming light
induce similar fields in the mobile
electrons of the metal.
These induced fields respond in
such a way that photons are re
generated, traveling back out of
the metal. Don't ask us to explain
any more; we didn't understand it
either.
