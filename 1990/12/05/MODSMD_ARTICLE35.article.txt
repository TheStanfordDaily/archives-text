## From little sister to big star: Oden makes her mark 
### Harold Yu Staff writer 
Stanford middle blocker Bev Oden
was ready to quit volleyball the day she
started.
"Basically, I was just terrible,'' Oden
recalled. "It was the Christmas Club
tournament, I had had two practices. I
didn't know where I was going or what
was going on. I was just humiliated. I
was terrible. It was too much."
But Oden's reluctant volleyball
beginning was far more than a simple
matter of first-time jitters. This was not
your everyday case of a star born from
nothing. That day, Oden first felt the
painful stigma of her heritage. She was
Kim and Elaina Oden's little sister. And
given this, she was supposed to be amaz
ing.
Today, few will contend that she is
not. Oden is the bona fide superstar of
the No. 3 Cardinal and not a single
opposing coach has claimed otherwise.
But Friday night, when she leads
Stanford into the NCAA Western
Regional tournament, Oden will con
tinue a struggle she began in the sev
enth grade. She will contend with not
only the fierce triple blocks of her oppo
nents but the unrelenting expectations
of her fans and peers.
Currently Oden is caught in the
midst of a violent storm. It begins with
her sisters. Her eldest sibling, Kim, is
the reigning queen of the volleyball
world. She is the captain of the Olympic
team and considered perhaps the best
American women's volleyball player
ever.
At the 1988 Games, she won the Sil

ver Spike Award, given to the player
with the highest hitting percentage at
the Olympics. In September, she was
named the Best Blocker at the World
Championships, which placed her on
the All-World team.
In her career at Stanford, Kim hit
over .370, had 1,751 kills, 104 aces and
253 solo blocks. To qualify that last fig
ure, sister Bev is currently second all
time with 83.
Then there is Elaina. Bev's second
sister went to the University of the
Pacific, where she led the Tigers to
national crowns her freshman and
sophomore seasons. She is currently
starting for the U.S. National team and
is truly one of the hardest hitters play
ing the game.
But while her sisters' successes have
been inspiring for the youngest Oden,
they have also been somewhat damag
ing. She has lived with the comparisons,
expectations and hoopla aroused by her
siblings from even before day one. Oden
recalls being anxiously asked when she
would start the game while watching
her sisters play in high school.
"It got bad around that time," Oden
said. "There were more and more com
parisons. It was really hard. I wasn't so
sure I had all that potential. People were
making me out to be a huge superstar,
which I wasn't. I was a failure. For the
longest time, I was failing to meet these
expectations."
It's hard to imagine someone who
wouldn't. While Oden was learning tht
game, her sisters were dueling in the
NCAA championship match. As Kim
and Elaina rose to new volleyball
heights, they took the expectations on

their littlest sister to other-worldly lev
els. For Oden, the sport became more
than a game, it became a proving
grounds for her supposed worth.
Pressure like this had an immediate
impact on her collegiate decision. Stan
ford, which Kim attended, was not her
foremost option. "Stanford was the far
thest thing from my mind," Oden said.
"I had to deal with [the image of Kim]
for four years in high school. I wanted to
go somewhere else where no one would
know me."
Her gradual acceptance of Stanford
as a viable alternative came slowly. "By
my senior year, I started not to care,"
Oden said. "I said to myself, This is
ridiculous; I want to play and enjoy the
game.' After that, I decided that I was
going to do what I wanted to do."
She eventually realized that Stanford
was what she wanted. But Oden would
still be conscious of her image. She did
not want to come to Palo Alto as the
national High School Player of the Year
or as the athlete Volleyball Monthly was
willing potentially the best ever. She
didn't want to be Kim's awesome little
sister or Stanford's one-player future.
She wanted to be Bev, period.
"Everyone was going to compare her
to her sisters," Stanford coach Don
Shaw said. "But she handled it well.
There in the limelight, you might think
she would be different than she really
is."
When she walked into camp, the first
thing her teammates noticed was her
nature. Oden was basically shy. She was
not the know-it-all, do-it-all headstrong
superstar who would tell her teammates
how to play.
"She was not at all coming in where
she thought she was the best player,"
teammate Jennifer Jackson said. "I
didn't get any impression of that at all.
She came in kind of her shy self. She's
pretty shy and unassertive, which you
think would be the opposite."
But, as far as volleyball was con
cerned, Oden made an aggressive state
ment. In less than two years, she has
done more than even her staunchest
fans could have expected. The Irvine,
Calif, product has hit .370 and .340 the
past two seasons. She has 867 total kills,
511 career digs, and 83 solo blocks.
She has been named first-team Ail-
American, All-Pacific 10 Conference
twice, Pac-10 Freshman of the Year, Pac
-10 Player-of-the-Year and Tournament
MVP twice. Oden has played with the
U.S. National B team and is a strong
prospect for the Pan-Am Games this

experts.
