# Women cagers get back on track with a pair of wins
## 
### David Hirning Senior staff writer 
Two down, nine more tough
ones to go.
The Stanford women's basket
ball team will play 28 regular sea
son games this year. That's not
unusual. That 11 of those games,
more than a third of the schedule,
are against ranked opponents is
unusual. And after an opening
loss to No. 6 Tennessee, the Cardi
nal looked to bounce back with . ..
another top-10 opponent, No. 10

Long Beach State.
Stanford was equal to Round
Two of their "NBA schedule,"
however, and got back on the win
ning track Nov. 30 with a see-saw
79-72 win over the 49ers. The
defending national champs then
started a new win streak with a
97-67 trouncing of Notre Dame
Sunday in Maples Pavilion.
Neither win was easy, despite
the latter score, and the Cardinal
won both games despite getting
outrebounded in each. Coach Tara
VanDerveer's lineup changes were

successful in many respects, but
still failed to reverse Stanford's
rebounding woes. The Cardinal
have been beaten on the boards in
all three games this year.
"I think it's a matter of com
mittment by the front-line play
ers," VanDerveer said. "Julie (Zeil
stra), Val (Whiting), and Trisha
(Stevens) have to rebound. That's
what they're out there for. But
you have to get extra rebounding
from your 'three' (small forward)
and your 'two' (big guard)."
"We're really upset, really dis
appointed about our rebounding,"
said the big forward Zeilstra. "I
don't know what it is ... people
just have to work a lot harder to
get rebounds."
In a hectic, hard-fought game
at Long Beach, the Cardinal man
aged to grab only 35 boards while
the 49ers came away with a glar
ing 67 rebounds. Against the
Fighting Irish, Stanford closed
the gap but still lost the battle, 40-
34.
Fortunately, Stanford won both
of the wars, and improved its
record to 2-1 on the season. The
Cardinal showed character in
coming from behind against Long

Beach, and then exhibited traces
of last season's form by blowing
out a pesky Irish squad in the late
going. On the whole, VanDerveer
and Stanford will take the wins
and the experience as they pre
pare for a tough holiday schedule
(see box).
The Long Beach State victory
helped salve the wounds that the
Lady Volunteers inflicted a week
previous, as Stanford downed a
team that had upset No. 7 Texas
in its opener. The 49ers started off
the game like a team bent on two
upsets in a row, streaking to leads
of seven and then 10 in the first
half on the strength of reserve
Vjera Kaludjerovich's 11 points.
The board differential was huge
(35-10), but the Cardinal man
aged to close to within five by half
time.
Rather than get frustrated,
Stanford came out fired up for the
second half and cooled off the
blazing 'Niners. Long Beach never
increased its advantage, and the
Cardinal broke out on top for good
with a Molly Goodenbour three
pointer at the 12:54 mark. The
sophomore guard, who started for
the first time this season, had four

treys and 14 points for the game,
second only to Zeilstra, who took
top honors with 22.
Stanford managed to stay on
top of the run-and-gun Long
Beach team the rest of the way,
leading by 10 at one point before
settling for the seven-point win.
Senior point guard Soiya Henning
played the entired game (for the
second game in a row), contribut
ing nine points and eight assists,
and the tenacious Cardinal
defense held the 49ers to just 28
percent from the field in the sec
ond half.
The game was a tribute to the
Cardinal's will to win, according
to Zeilstra. "Long Beach kind of
gave up, and we just wanted the
game more, the entire game," she
said.
VanDerveer's new smaller
lineup was a mixed success, with
Goodenbour hitting 14 but small
forward Chris MacMurdo shoot
ing just two of eight from the field
and grabbing two rebounds. Stan
ford has more mobility with this
lineup, but sacrifices power in the
paint by keeping 6-foot-3 Val
Whiting out of the game.
However, after Sunday's game,
VanDerveer's change proved,
wiser. MacMurdo came up with
nine rebounds against the Irish,
and scored 11 points. As the coach
flatly stated after the 30-point
win, "The small lineup is here to
stay."
The 6-0 sophomore MacMurdo
was disappointed in her starting
debut against the 49ers, but rel
ished the chance to improve her
skills. "It means a lot to me, that
Tar a has the confidence to start
me," she said. "Tara told me I had
to rebound more, and I think

today was an improvement."
Because MacMurdo must try to
replace three-time All Pac-10 for
ward Katy Steding at the position,
her continuing improvement will
be perhaps the biggest factor in
Stanford's quest to repeat as
champions. Steding's combina
tion of outside shooting and
scrappy rebounding has been
missed this year.
In the regular season home
opener against Notre Dame, the
rejuvenated Cardinal slipped com
fortably into the friendly confines
of Maples Pavilion. A crowd of
3,774 showed up on a Sunday
afternoon to continue a Stanford
tradition: lopsided women's bas
ketball victories.
But the Irish hadn't travelled
halfway across the country just to
play the willing victims. Led by
senior guard Karen Robinson,
Notre Dame stuck close for most
of the first half. A suffocating zone
defense bottled up the Cardinal's
inside game and forced Stanford
to launch shots from the perime
ter. They didn't always hit. When
Katura Jones hit from inside with
4:43 left, the startled Maples
crowd was looking at a two-point
Stanford lead, 34-32.
This was not in the script. By
now, Cardinal home dominance is
of almost legendary proportions: a
streak of 32 straight wins, second
longest in the nation (Auburn has
won 55 straight). That span
includes two undefeated home
campaigns, with the last loss in
Maples to UCLA in early 1988.
However, the Tara VanDerveer
stressed conditioning took its toll
in the second half, and the Cardi-


Tracy Allen â€” Dally
Trlsha Stevens led the Cardinal In scoring last year, but in their
championship-defending season Stevens has been limited because
she Is still recoverin from summer surgery. Her recovery will be a
key to the team's continued success.
