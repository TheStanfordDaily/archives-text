# Stevens playing her way back
## 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
Stanford bounced back from
a seasoning opening defeat, but
there is concern on the Stan
ford sideline that senior power
forward Trisha Stevens nasn't
bounced back from off-season
knee surgery.
Stevens, who led last year's
national championship team by
scoring 17.6 points per game,
has seen more bench time than
playing time in Stanford's first
three games.
Last year against Long
Beach State Stevens tallied
career-highs with 35 points
and 12 rebounds. But Friday in
a 79-72 defeat of the same
team, Stevens played just 12
minutes, scoring six points
with one rebound. Sunday
against Notre Dame, the All-
America candidate was limited
to 18 minutes and eight points.
"We're still finding out what

she can do," said Stanford
coach Tara VanDerveer after
Sunday's 97-67 victory over
No. 34 Notre Dame. "She's
doing the best she can consid
ering the circumstances."
The circumstances are that
Stevens has still not recovered
from surgery she had on both
knees in April. She suffered
from tendinitis in both knees
last year and averaged only
23.5 minutes per game, but
was expected to fully recover
for the start of fall practice.
However, her knees didn't
respond to a summer of rigor
ous rehabilitation, so Stevens
has skipped full-court running
drills, rested and applied a lot
of ice.
"It's coming along," said a
smiling Stevens after the Notre
Dame game. "I've stopped try
ing to worry about it.
Sitting on the bench is not
something Stanford's 6-foot-3
starting forward likes to do.
Stevens led the Pacific 10 Confer
ence in field goal percentage last
year (.549) and moved into sixth
on the Stanford all-time scoring

list with her eight points against
the Fighting Irish.
"She's doing really, really
well," said VanDerveer. "She's a
finely-tuned machine and right
now she's running a little rough.
She's been a little harder on her
self than she should be."
"It looks good, but I don't
know how it feels," VanDerveer

continued. "She wouldn't tell me
anyway."
After the Tennessee loss, Van-
Derveer switched away from the
triple tower starting lineup of
Stevens, Val Whiting and Julie
Zeilstra, starting sophomore
Chris MacMurdo at small for
ward. After Sunday's victory she
announced the smaller lineup is
here to stay.
