Stanford bounced back from
a seasoning opening defeat, but
there is concern on the Stan
ford sideline that senior power
forward Trisha Stevens nasn't

knee surgery.
Stevens, who led last year's
national championship team by
scoring 17.6 points per game,

Stevens has still not recovered
from surgery she had on both
knees in April. She suffered
from tendinitis in both knees

"It's coming along," said a
smiling Stevens after the Notre
Dame game. "I've stopped try
