# Men show two different faces in claiming third place
## Surles steals the show

As Michael Jordan has proven, sometimes that
one player can just take over a basketball game. It
doesn't matter what the opposing team does, at
times Jordan will just score.
Not that George Washington University's Dirkk
Surles is anywhere near Jordan's talent level. But
the combination of Surles' unstoppable offense and
Stanford's easily-stoppable offense in the second half
of Friday night's first-round loss to the Colonials
forced the Cardinal into an early exit of its host tour
nament.
It was a matchup problem in the backcourt, basi
cally. Stanford needed sophomore guard Kenny
Hicks as a defensive stopper against Surles. That
meant that starting off guard Kenny Ammann had
to sit, and he played only five minutes in the second
half. The Cardinal had no scoring potential from the
outside without Ammann, and Hicks' efforts turned
out to be ftitile against Surles.
Surles scored 29 points on 13-of-20 shooting.
Scoring 29 points in college basketball is roughly
equivalent to scoring 40 in the NBA. Turn out the
lights, game's over.
Stanford coach Mike Montgomery placed the
blame for the win on the team's overall effort. They
weren't hungry enough. But if you listen to Hicks
talk, it was more Surles and the George Washington
backcourt's brilliant quickness than any lack of
desire by the Cardinal squad.
"There's not much you can do," Hicks said after
the game. "I had a hand in his face, but he was just
unconscious.
"We underestimated them. Their backcourt was
definitely quicker than most teams we've played."
Hicks said.
Montgomery admitted that it is hard to win a
game when someone on the other team goes off like
that.
"Criminy sakes, how many times did (Surles) just
light it up?," Montgomery asked. "You're not going
to win too many ball games when a kid scores 29. He
just killed us."
Another problem cited by Montgomery was the
failure to rebound well enough against a smaller
team. But Stanford tied the Colonials on the boards,
38 to 38 on the game, and outrebounded them 23 to
18 in the second hidf, when George Washington
pulled away.
The Colonials' starting backcourt of Surles, only a
sophomore, and Alvin Pearsall, a freshman,
outscored Ammann and Patrick 38 to eight. On the

game, George Washington shot 43.8 percent from
three-point range compared to the Cardinal's 17.6
percent.
Many of those missed three-pointers came in the
last few minutes of the game, by which time Stan
ford was desperately behind and heaving desperation
shots at the basket.
For Surles this was his third straight game scor
ing 20 points or more, but he made it clear that Fri
day night was something special.
"I was hot tonight," Surles said. "I was getting

the open shot."
George Washington coach Mike Jarvis offered
praise for his star sophomore, and an assessment of
the game in general.
"When you talk about a sophomore going 13-for
-20, that's unbelievable," Jarvis said. "(We said) let's
get the ball into Surles' hands and go."
It was plain to all watching that there was a fun
damental discrepancy in quickness for the two
teams, and that was the difference in the game.
"One thing we are is fairly quick," Jarvis said.

Dr. Jekyll would have been proud of the Stanford
men's basketball team last weekend, for the Cardi
nal showed all the signs of a serious split personality
playing in its own Apple Invitational.
Two different Cardinal teams showed up for the
Invite: One team had its head in the game, and one
didn't. One team hustled and dove for loose balls,
and one didn't. One team looked hungry, and one
didn't.
And, as a result, one team romped, and the other
— to put it kindly — didn't.
Stanford finished third in the Apple — for the
first time ever — because the team that showed up to
play George Washington on Friday apparently had
other things on its mind. The Colonials took advan
tage of the Cardinal's lack of interest (and its 25 per
cent shooting performance in the second half) to run
away to an 81-70 win.
The Cardinal rebounded (literally and figura
tively) the following night, crushing Hawaii 84-55 in
the tournament's consolation game to run its season
record to 3-1. George Washington lost to Vanderbilt
76-74 in the tournament championship.
"I think we showed that we can be beaten when
we don't play hard, and when we play hard we can be
damn good," said Stanford forward Andrew Vlahov,
who scored 12 points in each game.
"We had a meeting (Saturday) morning, and we
said 'Well, it's gut-check time. Can we play? Do we
have character?'" Vlahov said. "We answered those
questions — one game too late."
"We played (against Hawaii) the way we have to
play to be successful," Stanford coach Mike Mont
gomery said. "That shouldn't be anything but the
norm for for us."
It certainly wasn't the norm Friday night, as the
Colonials dealt the Cardinal its first-ever opening
round Apple Invite loss. Stanford was up 27-17 after
10 minutes, but then stood by and passively watched
the Colonials take a 41-39 lead at the half.
"I think we got a little too comfortable out there,"
said center Adam Keefe, who poured in 28 points and
grabbed 10 rebounds. "They cut it down to five, and
then four, and then two, and it was like we were say
ing "Well, it's no big deal, we're still close.' We just let
it slide.
"For somebody to come into our gym and do that
.. . We've got to start thinking 'They can't do that in
our house' and start kicking some butt."
The only that butt that got kicked, however, was
colored Cardinal. The Colonials pulled away in the
second half behind sophomore guard Dirkk Surles,
