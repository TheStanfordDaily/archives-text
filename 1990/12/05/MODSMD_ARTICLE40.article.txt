# Men show two different faces in claiming third place
## Surles steals the show 
### Robert Pardington Senior staff writer Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
As Michael Jordan has proven, sometimes that
one player can just take over a basketball game. It
doesn't matter what the opposing team does, at
times Jordan will just score.
Not that George Washington University's Dirkk
Surles is anywhere near Jordan's talent level. But
the combination of Surles' unstoppable offense and
Stanford's easily-stoppable offense in the second half
of Friday night's first-round loss to the Colonials
forced the Cardinal into an early exit of its host tour
nament.
It was a matchup problem in the backcourt, basi
cally. Stanford needed sophomore guard Kenny
Hicks as a defensive stopper against Surles. That
meant that starting off guard Kenny Ammann had
to sit, and he played only five minutes in the second
half. The Cardinal had no scoring potential from the
outside without Ammann, and Hicks' efforts turned
out to be ftitile against Surles.
Surles scored 29 points on 13-of-20 shooting.
Scoring 29 points in college basketball is roughly
equivalent to scoring 40 in the NBA. Turn out the
lights, game's over.
Stanford coach Mike Montgomery placed the
blame for the win on the team's overall effort. They
weren't hungry enough. But if you listen to Hicks
talk, it was more Surles and the George Washington
backcourt's brilliant quickness than any lack of
desire by the Cardinal squad.
"There's not much you can do," Hicks said after
the game. "I had a hand in his face, but he was just
unconscious.
"We underestimated them. Their backcourt was
definitely quicker than most teams we've played."
Hicks said.
Montgomery admitted that it is hard to win a
game when someone on the other team goes off like
that.
"Criminy sakes, how many times did (Surles) just
light it up?," Montgomery asked. "You're not going
to win too many ball games when a kid scores 29. He
just killed us."
Another problem cited by Montgomery was the
failure to rebound well enough against a smaller
team. But Stanford tied the Colonials on the boards,
38 to 38 on the game, and outrebounded them 23 to
18 in the second hidf, when George Washington
pulled away.
The Colonials' starting backcourt of Surles, only a
sophomore, and Alvin Pearsall, a freshman,
outscored Ammann and Patrick 38 to eight. On the

game, George Washington shot 43.8 percent from
three-point range compared to the Cardinal's 17.6
percent.
Many of those missed three-pointers came in the
last few minutes of the game, by which time Stan
ford was desperately behind and heaving desperation
shots at the basket.
For Surles this was his third straight game scor
ing 20 points or more, but he made it clear that Fri
day night was something special.
"I was hot tonight," Surles said. "I was getting

the open shot."
George Washington coach Mike Jarvis offered
praise for his star sophomore, and an assessment of
the game in general.
"When you talk about a sophomore going 13-for
-20, that's unbelievable," Jarvis said. "(We said) let's
get the ball into Surles' hands and go."
It was plain to all watching that there was a fun
damental discrepancy in quickness for the two
teams, and that was the difference in the game.
"One thing we are is fairly quick," Jarvis said.

Dr. Jekyll would have been proud of the Stanford
men's basketball team last weekend, for the Cardi
nal showed all the signs of a serious split personality
playing in its own Apple Invitational.
Two different Cardinal teams showed up for the
Invite: One team had its head in the game, and one
didn't. One team hustled and dove for loose balls,
and one didn't. One team looked hungry, and one
didn't.
And, as a result, one team romped, and the other
— to put it kindly — didn't.
Stanford finished third in the Apple — for the
first time ever — because the team that showed up to
play George Washington on Friday apparently had
other things on its mind. The Colonials took advan
tage of the Cardinal's lack of interest (and its 25 per
cent shooting performance in the second half) to run
away to an 81-70 win.
The Cardinal rebounded (literally and figura
tively) the following night, crushing Hawaii 84-55 in
the tournament's consolation game to run its season
record to 3-1. George Washington lost to Vanderbilt
76-74 in the tournament championship.
"I think we showed that we can be beaten when
we don't play hard, and when we play hard we can be
damn good," said Stanford forward Andrew Vlahov,
who scored 12 points in each game.
"We had a meeting (Saturday) morning, and we
said 'Well, it's gut-check time. Can we play? Do we
have character?'" Vlahov said. "We answered those
questions — one game too late."
"We played (against Hawaii) the way we have to
play to be successful," Stanford coach Mike Mont
gomery said. "That shouldn't be anything but the
norm for for us."
It certainly wasn't the norm Friday night, as the
Colonials dealt the Cardinal its first-ever opening
round Apple Invite loss. Stanford was up 27-17 after
10 minutes, but then stood by and passively watched
the Colonials take a 41-39 lead at the half.
"I think we got a little too comfortable out there,"
said center Adam Keefe, who poured in 28 points and
grabbed 10 rebounds. "They cut it down to five, and
then four, and then two, and it was like we were say
ing "Well, it's no big deal, we're still close.' We just let
it slide.
"For somebody to come into our gym and do that
.. . We've got to start thinking 'They can't do that in
our house' and start kicking some butt."
The only that butt that got kicked, however, was
colored Cardinal. The Colonials pulled away in the
second half behind sophomore guard Dirkk Surles,

who made six of his eight shots in
the half and led both teams with
29 points. Stanford's Kenny
Hicks Bpent most of the half fight
ing through pick after pick after
pick trying to get to Surles, but to
no avail.
"He had about 200 picks set for
him," Hicks said. "When they do
that, the most you can do is hope
for help.... He was hot. Some
times I had a hand in his face and
I blocked him once, but even that
went in. I was dismayed.
"In the first half I thought he
was human at least. In the second
I started to think he was inhu
man."
Surles might have been uncon
scious, but it was Stanford who
was having serious mental prob
lems. "I think our pregame men
tal set was in another world," Vla
hov said. "We weren't very
focused on the game."
Or on the hoop. Stanford was
an abysmal 3-for-17 from the
three-point line, and scored
exactly seven baskets in the sec
ond half. "It doesn't take a genius
to figure out our shooting hurt
us," Montgomery said.
The team's complacent atti
tude might have hurt as well.
"They were hungrier than we
were, and we can't have that,"
Montgomery said. "We got beat,
and deservedly so."
"We didn't show them much
respect, and they came in and
kicked our ass," Vlahov said.
The Cardinal did a little ass

kicking of its own the next night
in the consolation game by
swarming Hawaii on defense, div
ing after every single loose ball
and crashing the boards like crazy.
Guard Kenny Ammann came to
life, scoring eight points in the
game's first three minutes and
hitting the deck about 40 times
fighting for the ball in the first
half.
"That's the way you should
play all the time," Montgomery
said. "If there's a loose ball you
should go for it. . . . Ammann
really set the tone at the start of
the game."
Ammann also more than made
up for Friday's shooting disaster.
He finished with 15 points on 6-
of-10 shooting, and backcourt
mate John Patrick added 13. The
two had been a combined 2-for-12
the night before.
The game was tied at 14 after
five minutes, but then Stanford
went on a 17-0 tear to put it away
early. Ammann started the run
with a jumper, and Keefe put in
six of his 22 points during the
streak.
When Vlahov stole the ball at
the top of the key, dribbled the
length of the court and slammed
it home with eight minutes to go,
the score was 31-14 and the Rain
bows were a mess. Hawaii called
timeout, but it didn't do a heck of
a lot of good: The lead kept going
up, up, up to 23 at the half. Good
night.
"There's not much you can say
when you get a good ass-kicking
like that," Hawaii coach Riley
Wallace said. "When they ran off
17 in a row we dropped our heads
a little bit. The shots that didn't

drop for them last night did
tonight."
The Cardinal also made a point
of banging under the boards just a
little more than they had the pre
vious night. George Washington
had fought Stanford to a 38-all
standstill on the boards on Friday,
but Hawaii couldn't do the same.
The final damage was 42-27 Stan
ford, with Keefe taking in 13
rebounds, Vlahov adding nine and
Deshon Wingate seven (to go
along with his 11 points).
"They were very physical the
entire game," Wallace said.
"The bottom line is we needed
to come out and play with our
hearts, like we wanted it," Keefe
said. "We needed to give out some
hits instead of just taking them."
"We had a little different
agenda tonight," Montgomery
agreed. "We were focussed, work
ing hard There was clearly a
difference in the team's mental
preparation."
There was also a difference in
how it protected its lead. The two
teams traded baskets at the start
of the second half, but the Cardi
nal wouldn't let the Rainbows get
closer than 20. "The whole team
did a great job of not letting that
happen," Keefe said. "Even dur
ing timeouts we'd say 'C'mon,
let's beat 'em by 30, let's beat 'em
by 40, let's not just trade baskets.'
The lead did get up to 30 at one
point, and the game was capped
by an authoritative Lang Meyer
"Get-out-of-my-way!" dunk with
less than two minutes to go. The
dunk came off a missed shot: the
ball bounced straight up off the
rim, Meyer's looong arms reached

above everyone else, and before
anyone knew what was happen
ing, the ball had been stuffed.
Emphatically. The crowd went
bananas, the players on the bench
almost killed each other handing
out high fives, and the game was
over.
"Andrew said after the game
that this is the Stanford team we
have to be," Patrick said. "Not the
one that played George Washing
ton."
Card notes
The Cardinal has the next 10 days
off for finals before returning to
action Saturday the 15th against
Santa Clara at Maples. Marcus Lol
lie, who has been out with a sprained
ankle, should be fine by then.
Freshmen Bobby Patton and
Nick Ravn and sophomore Mike
Morris have all decided to redshirt
this season.
Apple Computers gave away a Mac
Ilci at halftime of each game this
weekend. Contestants had 45 seconds
to make a layup, a free throw and a
three-pointer, with the computer
going to whoever made three baskets
the fastest.
In the first game's media shootout,
The Daily was well-represented by its
intrepid men's basketball writer, who
hit the layup and proceeded to toss up
seven — count 'em! — seven airballs
and three bricks. In an interview after
the disaster, the writer, who will
remain nameless, offered the follow
ing explanation: "So I choked. Sue
n
me.
A videotape of the fiasco,
tentatively titled "45 Seconds of Inep
titude," will be in stores in time for
Christmas.
