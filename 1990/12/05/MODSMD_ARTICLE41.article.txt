# Fencers foil Banana Slugs
## 
### Dax Kurbegov Staff writer 
In their first NCAA competi
tion of the year, the Stanford
men's and women's fencing teams
skewered the Banana Slugs of
UC-Santa Cruz by margins of 16-
11 and 11-5.
Saturday's meet at Santa Cruz
was marked by the growing
maturity of the young Stanford
squad, as they never trailed in the
meet.
The Banana Slugs have tradi
tionally given the Cardinal fencers
a great deal of trouble. Last year
the men's team defeated Santa
Cruz only once before Western
regionals, and that was only due
to a Santa Cruz fencer who was
later found to be ineligible. The
women's team also struggled, los
ing 8-8 by touches and then win
ning 8-8 by touches later in the
year.
The men's team captured foil
5-4 in the first event of the day
without the services of NCAA
champion Nick Bravin, who was
in France for a World Cup event.
The sabre team soundly
downed the Slugs 6-3. That con
tingent was led by Leonard "The
Blur" D'Amico who returned
from an injury to have a perfect
day for the Cardinal. D'Amico also
sealed the victory for Stanford

overall by defeating Banana Slug
veteran Ed Meserve 5-1. E p e e
also won 5-4. Epee fencer David
Brody said, "This is the first time
in over three years that our epee
team has beaten Santa Cruz. It is
a very exciting victory for us and
bodes well for the future of the
epee team."
According to men's coach
Zoran Tulum, the epee fencers
struggled last year due to their
youth and experience. "We started
two sophomores and a freshman
last year," said Tulum. "Those
same fencers are now experienced
and will continue to get better."
Tulum also said that this year's
team has a distinct advantage
over the previous team. "Last year
we lost half the team due to grad
uation and academic concerns."
All the starting squads this
year are the same with the excep
tion of Jim Farrell, a sabre fencer
who graduated. In addition, the
Cardinal men'f team will only
graduate one fencer at the end of
this year, team captain Stan Brob
ston.
Likewise, the women's team
has only lost one fencer this sea
son, and they easily handled
Santa Cruz 11-5. Led by Western
Regional Champion Lana Kang,
captain Grace Chang and senior
Olivia Judson, the Cardinal
started slowly by losing the first

two bouts but came back to win
eight of the last ten.
Women's coach Sherry Posthu
mus said, "Santa Cruz is always
tricky beaiuse you're never sure
who you will face. However, they
are not as strong as they were last
year."
Freshman Thea Wojtkowski
made her debut fencing for the
Cardinal by going 2-2 on the day.
Posthumus said Wojtkowski was
clearly nervous in her early bout,
"but Thea the Tiger just got bet
ter and better as the meet went
n
on.
Wojtkowski has three years
experience in club fencing before
coming to Stanford. Wojtkowski
said, "I wish I could be more con
sistent in my fencing. Still, I was
pretty happy."
Team astrologer and epee
fencer Jeremy Nelson provided
another explanation for the Cardi
nal's success this weekend. "It
was my lucky fluorescent pink
boxers with bright green polka
dots," he said. "I think the whole
team should get them. They're so
bright you can see them right
through the pants. It's very dis
tracting for opponents."
The teams will meet again in
early February before the Cardi
nal defends its Western Regional
Championship in March.
