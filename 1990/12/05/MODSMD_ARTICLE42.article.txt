Summer Sanders and Jeff
Rouse made waves in the Mid
west this weekend at the U.S.
Open Swimming meet in Indi
anapolis, In. Sanders and Rouse
led a powerful Cardinal brigade
to a strong showing in the pre
season event.
Sanders was a triple winner,
capturing the 200-meter butter
fly and the 200- and 400-meter
medleys. She also racked up the
highest score at the meet with
99 points.
"I was happy with my times,"
said Sanders, "They were even a
little faster than I expected,
probably because we've been
working so hard in practice."
Sanders had slow times in the
morning trials but picked up
and flew through the evening
fined rounds.
Rouse won the 100-meter
backstroke and "had an all
around great meet," according
to men's coach Skip Kenney.
Rouse, a junior, is ranked No. 1
in the nation in both the 100-
and 200-meter backstroke.
"I just wanted to swim fast in
this meet and come out feeling
positive about January," said
Rouse, "The meet went really

well; I exceeded all of my expec
tations."
In January Sanders and
Rouse head for the World
Championships in Pferth, Aus
tralia. "I'm going to try for best
times," said Sanders, "I'm not
worried about placing."
Until then, Sanders plans to
work on the 400-meter medley.
"I need to learn how to pace it so
that it doesn't hurt as bad at the
end."
Rouse will be swimming in
the 100- and 200-meter back
stroke and probably the medley
relay.
Sanders and Rouse weren't
the only ones who had great
races last weekend. "The team
as a whole worked really well
and eveiyone got better every
day," said Rouse.
After travelling all day
Thursday, the swimmers had a
shaky start on Friday. But by
the third day of competition, the
team had "great attitudes and
great races," according to
Rouse.
Men's coach Skip Kenney
agreed, noting that several
swimmers had best times
unshaven. This was especially
impressive considering the level
of competition and the Cardi
nal's lack of preparation.

The best swimmers in the
country were at this meet,
according to Kenney, including
the World Championship team.
Also at the Open was the No. 1-
ranked Texas women's team.
"We did really well compared
to Texas," said Sanders, "They
kind of got us in the sprint
events but with more work we'll
get 'em."
Stanford, unlike some
teams, did not taper their work
outs in preparation for this
meet. They continued to train
very hard, doing aerobic work
outs without concentrating on
speed work.
"Everyone is in different
stages of training right now,"
said Kenney, "Some got ready
for this meet and others didn't."
As an example, Kenney noted
that Olympic medalist Matt
Biondi didn't make it into the
final round for any event.
"This was just a meet for the
coaches to see how we're doing,"
said Sanders. The Cardinal
swimmers used the U.S. Open
for individual progress.
"We just wanted to go race,"
said Kenney, "If you can survive
the psychological aspect of going
up against prepared competi
tion then you're in great shape."
