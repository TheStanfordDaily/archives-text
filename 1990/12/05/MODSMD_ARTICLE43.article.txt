What a difference a few seconds
makes. Steve Buddie lost focus for
a brief moment in his 167-pound
bout at the Las Vegas Invitational
and consequently lost the first
round match to Oklahoma's
Jason Leonard, 3-2.
"I just wasn't mentally pre
pared. I was expecting an easier
match," said Buddie.
"Steve was not completely psy
chologically ready and gave up the
first takedown. Leonard was
really strong on top, so Steve had
a hard time escaping and turn
ing," said Stanford wrestling
coach Chris Horpel.
Despite his first round loss,
Buddie found a path to fourth
place in the tournament. Since
Leonard made it to the quarterfi
nals, Buddie qualified for the con
solation round.
He pinned Illinois State's Matt
Gruazka at 3:28 and received a
default from Lincoln's Curtis
White. Buddie was up by 12 points
when White injured his shoulder
and withdrew from the tourna
ment.
Next Buddie beat Rob Dicks
from Fresno State with an 18-3
technical fall at 3:38. Indiana's
Casey Graham was Buddie's next
victim. At 2:48 Buddie pinned him
and followed with a 14-8 decision
over lowa State's Bob Thompson.
This set up a rematch with
Leonard, who lost in the semifi
nals of the main draw. Buddie
crushed Leonard, 12-0.
Arizona State's G.T. Taylor,

Buddie's high school nemesis, was
next. Taylor beat Buddie in high
school for the state championship.
Buddie returned the favor in last
year's Las Vegas Invitational. But
last weekend Taylor won, 11-4, to
take third place.
"I tried to keep it even on my
feet. He was more aggressive than
he's ever been against me. Once
he got a lead he was able to stall,"
said Buddie.
He finished fourth with a 14.25
point total. "Losing the first
round match took some pressure
off me," said Buddie, "*1 got back
to the old me and proved I could
fight back."
Buddie's matches typified the
tournament for the Stanford
grapplers. The team didn't score
any points in the four lightest
weight classes. Phil Nowick, Jay
Jackson, Matt Duckworth and
James Dinette lost to first round
opponents who didn't advance to
the quarterfinals.
"This tournament is a little too
intense this early. It's like having
the NCAAs in preseason," said
Horpel.
The team came through to
score well in several heavier
weight classes to finish 17th of 44
teams. Oklahoma State squashed
the competition, fielding at least
six finalists, including several sec
ond-stringers.
"It was like a good college team
at a weak high school tourna
ment," said Horpel, "I don't know
if any team can touch them."
Despite the domination of
Oklahoma State, several grap
plers placed and scored. Seeded

No. 4, Steve Yarbrough placed
fifth in the 177-pound class while
scoring 10.5 points.
He went to sudden-death over
time in his first round bout and
executed a takedown to beat Cen
tral Michigan's Mike Galvin 9-7.
Next he crushed Dan Staata from
West Virginia, 10-1, and outma
neuvered Fresno State's Scott
Boness for a 9-6 victory.
Yarbrough was pinned for the
first time in his collegiate career
by No. 1 seed Cory Olson from
Nebraska. Olson pinned him at
2:32 in the semifinal bout.
In the consolation bracket,
Yarbrough lost to Cal State-Bak
ersfield's Mark Scheff 4-3. He
received a forfeit from Michigan's
Larry Green in the sth place
match.
In the 190-pound class Mark
Graham beat Lincoln's Craig
Locke in the first round with a 16-
0 technical fall at 2:32. He then
won a close 12-9 bout against Curt
Strahm from Oregon.
Arizona State's Rex Holman,
the No. 8 seed and eventual cham
pion, beat Graham 13-2 in the fol
lowing round. In consolation Gra
ham fell to Chico State's Carson
Wollert 8-2.
Dave Sacks recieved half a
point for beating Oregon State's
Dave Millbum 8-3 in the consola
tion bracket. He then lost to Joe
Cassidy from Lehigh, 10-2. He
was bumped from the 150-pound
main draw by Missouri's Dan
Dunkin 8-5.
Matt Topham also collided with
a tough Missouri grappler in the
first round.

tournament for the Stanford
grapplers. The team didn't score
any points in the four lightest
weight classes. Phil Nowick, Jay
Jackson, Matt Duckworth and
James Dinette lost to first round
opponents who didn't advance to
the quarterfinals.
"This tournament is a little too
intense this early. It's like having
the NCAAs in preseason," said
Horpel.
The team came through to
score well in several heavier
weight classes to finish 17th of 44
teams. Oklahoma State squashed
the competition, fielding at least
six finalists, including several sec
ond-stringers.
"It was like a good college team
at a weak high school tourna
ment," said Horpel, "I don't know
if any team can touch them."
Despite the domination of
Oklahoma State, several grap
plers placed and scored. Seeded

No. 4, Steve Yarbrough placed
fifth in the 177-pound class while
scoring 10.5 points.
He went to sudden-death over
time in his first round bout and
executed a takedown to beat Cen
tral Michigan's Mike Galvin 9-7.
Next he crushed Dan Staata from
West Virginia, 10-1, and outma
neuvered Fresno State's Scott
Boness for a 9-6 victory.
Yarbrough was pinned for the
first time in his collegiate career
by No. 1 seed Cory Olson from
Nebraska. Olson pinned him at
2:32 in the semifinal bout.
In the consolation bracket,
Yarbrough lost to Cal State-Bak
ersfield's Mark Scheff 4-3. He
received a forfeit from Michigan's
Larry Green in the sth place
match.
In the 190-pound class Mark
Graham beat Lincoln's Craig
Locke in the first round with a 16-
0 technical fall at 2:32. He then
won a close 12-9 bout against Curt
Strahm from Oregon.
Arizona State's Rex Holman,
the No. 8 seed and eventual cham
pion, beat Graham 13-2 in the fol
lowing round. In consolation Gra
ham fell to Chico State's Carson
Wollert 8-2.
Dave Sacks recieved half a
point for beating Oregon State's
Dave Millbum 8-3 in the consola
tion bracket. He then lost to Joe
Cassidy from Lehigh, 10-2. He
was bumped from the 150-pound
main draw by Missouri's Dan
Dunkin 8-5.
Matt Topham also collided with
a tough Missouri grappler in the
first round.
What a difference a few seconds
makes. Steve Buddie lost focus for
a brief moment in his 167-pound
bout at the Las Vegas Invitational
and consequently lost the first
round match to Oklahoma's
Jason Leonard, 3-2.
"I just wasn't mentally pre
pared. I was expecting an easier
match," said Buddie.
"Steve was not completely psy
chologically ready and gave up the
first takedown. Leonard was
really strong on top, so Steve had
a hard time escaping and turn
ing," said Stanford wrestling
coach Chris Horpel.
Despite his first round loss,
Buddie found a path to fourth
place in the tournament. Since
Leonard made it to the quarterfi
nals, Buddie qualified for the con
solation round.
He pinned Illinois State's Matt
Gruazka at 3:28 and received a
default from Lincoln's Curtis
White. Buddie was up by 12 points
when White injured his shoulder
and withdrew from the tourna
ment.
Next Buddie beat Rob Dicks
from Fresno State with an 18-3
technical fall at 3:38. Indiana's
Casey Graham was Buddie's next
victim. At 2:48 Buddie pinned him
and followed with a 14-8 decision
over lowa State's Bob Thompson.
This set up a rematch with
Leonard, who lost in the semifi
nals of the main draw. Buddie
crushed Leonard, 12-0.
Arizona State's G.T. Taylor,

Buddie's high school nemesis, was
next. Taylor beat Buddie in high
school for the state championship.
Buddie returned the favor in last
year's Las Vegas Invitational. But
last weekend Taylor won, 11-4, to
take third place.
"I tried to keep it even on my
feet. He was more aggressive than
he's ever been against me. Once
he got a lead he was able to stall,"
said Buddie.
He finished fourth with a 14.25
point total. "Losing the first
round match took some pressure
off me," said Buddie, "*1 got back
to the old me and proved I could
fight back."
Buddie's matches typified the
tournament for the Stanford
grapplers. The team didn't score
any points in the four lightest
weight classes. Phil Nowick, Jay
Jackson, Matt Duckworth and
James Dinette lost to first round
opponents who didn't advance to
the quarterfinals.
