# Coalition forms to oppose Gulf intervention
## 
### Michael Friedly Editorial staff 
Students from 16 universities
across the state have joined forces
to form a coalition against Ameri
can intervention in the Persian
Gulf crisis.
The formation of the California
State Network Against U.S. Inter
vention in the Middle East was
announced Monday morning at a
press conference held in Sproul
Plaza at UC-Berkeley. The
statewide network will be part of a
nationwide alliance of 70 universi
ties that is currently being orga
nized to call attention to opposi
tion to American intervention.
The statewide network
includes representatives from
Stanford, San Francisco State
University, UC-Santa Cruz, UC-
Berkeley and Hastings College of
the Law.
Hastings student Kathleen
Stewart said representatives from
her school would use their legal
knowledge to help attain conscien
tious objector status for military
personnel who disagree with the
current deployment of U.S.
troops.
In addition, she said the Hast
ings representatives would try to
remind President Bush that "the
constitution mandates that

Congress cast the vote in declar
ing war."
M Yet Bush has already cast the
die," she said. "And it seems it is
the people who stand to lose —
namely their lives and their loved
ones."
The alliance was created to pro
vide a statewide and national
organization to mobilize students
if there is an war against Iraq.
"The question is unity. There is
a real need for unity in the anti
war movement and a need for
Bush and the powers that be to
see that we are unified," according
to Hilary Diamond, a San Fran
cisco State student who is a leader
of the statewide network.
"I would hope that we are visi
ble so that we can show there is
dissent to the consensus," said
Kate Morris, a Stanford student
representative to the statewide
network. "If you can say there are
actions across the country, then
that is more powerful than indi
vidual universities" sponsoring
their own movements against the
intervention, she said.
The universities have agreed
on a platform of three main
demands:
• Bringing the American troops
home from Saudi Arabia;
• Greater spending on educa
tional issues rather than military

ones; and
• Having no draft and no selec
tive service.
"There is a need for a broad
anti-war movement and I think
those three demands are some
thing that students across the
country agree with," Diamond
said.
"There is occasionally a cam
pus here and there that doesn't
agree with the message," but not
many, she said.
"There is a lot more depth in
this movement" than in the anti
war movement of the 19605, Mor
ris said. The Stanford movement
has received support from across
the political spectrum, from liber
als as well as conservatives and
libertarians.
"We'll work with [conserva
tives]," Morris said at the press
conference, "even though I won't
agree with them."
"The movement at Stanford is
less focused" on specific alterna
tives to American intervention as
a result of the disparate views,
Morris added.
"What we're trying to do is
invite as many people as possible,"
she said. She noted students at
other universities have taken a
more radical stance against the
war because they have a greater
consensus among the organizers

than Stanford does.
The Stanford organizers now
plan to focus their activities on
presenting peaceful alternatives
to war with a forum tonight in
Toyon Hall and a gathering
tomorrow at noon in White Plaza
at which alternatives will be dis
cussed.
In addition, an all-day fast is
planned for tomorrow with a
break-fast meal scheduled for
midnight.
Morris said there are tentative
plans for a conference at Stanford
early next year that would "bring
together activists from the West
ern region."
Diamond said she began orga
nizing a statewide alliance after
working with the Committee
Against the Vietnam War in the
Middle East, a nationwide organi
zation against U.S. intervention in
Saudi Arabia. She said the com
mittee asked her to focus on coor
dinating students for the group.
"I felt like the campus move
ment was very important and
needed to be independent" of the
committee, so she began organiz
ing the statewide network, Dia
mond said. "It was just a matter of
connecting up with a few key peo
ple."
