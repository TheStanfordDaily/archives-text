# Cuts plague non-ethnic centers with different kinds of problems
## 
### Minal Hajratwala Staff writer 
While the ethnic community centers
are "in the same boat" with respect to
budget cuts, the four other centers face a
different set of concerns, ranging from
even more limited finances to stringent
legal requirements.
In particular, the non-ethnic centers
— the Bechtel International Center, the
Disability Resource Center, the Lesbian,
Gay and Bisexual Community Center and
the Women s Center — do not have spe
cific guidelines like those recommended
by the University Committee on Minority
Issues.
The I-Center, which received the
l argest budget cut of any community cen
ter, provides a variety of legal services —
from student immigration visas and other
paperwork to Orientation activities for
international students. In recent years, it
has also sponsored programs such as a
film series, an evening Espresso Bar and
noon lectures.
"We have a dual face — administrative
and programming," director John Pear
bon said. "No matter where the cuts
come, it could easily be said that's the
wrong place."
The I-Center became part of Campus
Affairs Sept. 1 because its old home, the
office of the Dean of Graduate Studies,
Will be eliminated next year.
"Campus Affairs has become, in a
sense, the home of the community cen

ters, which is really exciting," said Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Michael Jackson.
"There is real potential of involving
the I-Center in multiculturalism and
including international issues in multi
culturalism," Pearson said.
The I-Center will also cut its budget by
15 percent. Although most Campus
Affairs cuts took effect Sept. 1, many I-
Center cuts have been delayed while it
adjusts to being part of a different depart
ment.
Cuts in the center will probably mean
reducing staff — two of tne 13 full-time
positions, according to Pearson.
Projected cuts also include shifting
from individual to group advising on
issues such as immigration and overseas
studies, Pearson said.
Some smaller cuts have already been
made, such as publishing fewer newslet
ters and changing the way the center
remains open.
In the past, student hosts have been
paid to staiT the center every evening and
weekend. Now, the I-Center closes Mon
day nights, and staffing is part of the
duties of the resident staff couple.
Trying to stay above water
To try to develop some guidelines for
future expansion, the LGBCC and the
Women's Center have been asked to
undertake needs assessments similar in
spirit to UCMI to gauge where funding
can best be allocated.
But officers of the LGBCC questioned

the need for such a study. "The needs are
so painfully obvious to us," said Tom
Henning, an LGBCC officer.
Community-building is one of the cen
ter's greatest tasks.
The newest of the community centers,
the LGBCC was officially established in
October 1987. Its non-salary budget
amounts to approximately $2,000 —
about one-tenth that of the other commu
nity centers.
"Even cutting [the entire LGBCC bud
get] would not help the University solve a
$22 million budget problem, at all," said
Program and Fraternal Affairs Adviser
Michael Ramsey-Perez.
The University pays for 20 hours a
week of student staff time as well as copy
ing, telephone service and other day-to
day expenses, said Ramsey-Perez, who
advises the student-run center.
"When the center was founded three
years ago, there was a sense of optimism
that we will in time build a program and
develop the infrastructure necessary," he
said.
But budget cuts have tempered this
optimism. "We have lost a certain amount
of momentum that you really can't calcu
late the cost of," Henning said.
"We can make three-year budget plans,
but they don't necessarily mean any
thing," he said.
Although the center is cost-efficient
because it relies so much on volunteers,
Ramsey-Perez said, the paid staff time of
20 hours a week "is barely enough to

function as an administrative unit, let
alone providing service."
"We are really fighting to keep our
heads above water," scud graduate stu
dent David Bradfute, an LGBCC officer.
Like others in the University, LGBCC
officers feel the tight budget situation
forces them to compete with other pro
grams for funding.
"We are fighting for a limited amount
of money with the other community cen
ters," Henning said.
Less effect on Women's Center
The Women's Needs Assessment is
already underway, but its progress has
been slowed by the budget situation. "We
just don't have the money, and it has
slowed things down considerably," Hop
per said. For example, funding a graduate
student research assistant for the project
has been "a big struggle," she said.
The Women's Center is unique among
the community centers because it is
almost entirely ASSU-funded. Although
the other centers work with student
groups that receive ASSU special fees,
their operating budgets come from the
Office of Student Affairs.
Because of this, repositioning's impact
on the Women's Center has been mini
mal. However, Acting Coordinator Teri
Hopper said the cuts have made expan
sion more difficult.
For example, Women's Center staff
have pushed for a more central location
on campus for years.

"With the recognition that the
Women'B Center needs to be moved, we
have been trying to find other ways of
compensating — for example, increasing
our advertising budget," Hopper said.
"But there isn't any extra money for
that."
'A time bomb'
The Disability Resource Center pro
vides services mandated by law in addi
tion to educational programming and
support for student organizations.
Among other tasks, volunteers at the
Disability Resource Center read text
books into tape recorders for blind stu
dents, take class notes for deaf students
or students who do not have the use of
their arms.
"We have a huge volunteer services
program — 4,000 hours a year of volun
teer labor," Acting Director Molly Sand
perl said. "That is an enormous amount
of money we save the University."
One "potential time bomb" in terms of
lawsuits is that none of the other commu
nity centers are wheelchair accessible,
according to Sandperl.
"Students with disabilities cannot
really connect with those groups," she
said. "Someone could probably sue and
win, but right now we do not have a stu
dent for whom it is a personal issue.
The budget cuts will make it more dif
ficult to solve this and other problems,
Sandperl said.
