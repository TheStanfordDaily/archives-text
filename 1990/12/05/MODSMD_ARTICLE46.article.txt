# Everything you always wanted to know about the Hum Sex course
## 
### David Bianco Editorial staff 
With his thick Armenian accent, quick
wit and teddy-bear smile, Psychiatry
Prof. Herant Katchadourian has taught,
entertained and occasionally titillated
thousands of students over the past few
decades in his Human Sexuality In
addition, he lectures in the Human Biol
ogy core and conducts educational
research.
Your Human Sexuality class is
perennially one of the most popular
at Stanford. How do you account for
the packed auditoriums?
Well, I do think the subject has some
thing to do with it. Although I must say
that one year when I wasn't here, some
body else taught the course and there
were only 40 students. So I assume the
way the course is taught may also be a
factor.
Some people may take the class
because so many others have taken it.
This was more of a factor earlier when we
used to meet in Memorial Auditorium
and we had 1,200 students.
And this was also in the height of the

'60s and '70s, and I
think some students
took it as an act of rebel
lion so that they could
write home and say,
"Guess what course I'm
taking." I don't think
that works anymore.
More seriously, sexu
ality concerns students
in a very personal way at

many levels. From an academic perspec
tive, the interdisciplinary focus may be
another attraction. I know of no other
course which covers as broad a range of
topics from biology, behavior and culture.
Are you ever surprised at the
knowledge (or lack thereof) students
have regarding sex and sexuality?
I have ceased to be surprised after so
many years. Occasionally I am surprised.
You know, there is a huge range in back
grounds in this respect in that class.
One young woman told me that until
she heard the lecture on autoeroticism,
she was not aware that all these years
what she was doing was called masturba
tion.
Another student in class first heard

about transsexuals in class, and realized
that he was a transsexual. He subse
quently went into treatment and had
transsexual surgery.
I am giving you the more dramatic
(examples), but I think most people learn
something. Some more than others.
Do you think your Hum Sex class
promotes sexual promiscuity at
Stanford?
My gut reaction is that it does not. The
main impact of these classes appear to be
on attitudes, not on behavior. There are
many factors that shape behavior.
Simply because you hear a lecture on
sexual intercourse, you don't say, "Oh,
well, gee, so that's what it is, let me go
and try it out." It just doesn't work that

way, I don't think.
But it does seem to
have an impact on stu
dents' attitudes. A per
son becomes more
accepting of his or her
own sexuality and more
tolerant of the sexuality
of others different as
that may be from one's
own.

What's the most unusual question
you've gotten?
The lecture included a discussion of
artificial insemination. And I said some
thing about Nobel laureates . . . having
donated sperm to a Southern California
sperm bank.
So, lecture finished, and student came
up and said, "Can I ask you a question?"
"Sure."
He said, "How do they get the sperm
out of the Nobel laureate?"
I said, "How do you think they get it
out?"
He said, "Is there some kind of
machine?"
I said, "Why do you need a machine?"
He said, "You mean. ..." and then he
made a hand gesture.

I said, "Yeah, that's exactly how they
get it."
He said, "I'll be damned."
You see, for him, the idea of a Nobel
laureate masturbating was absolutely
beyond belief. This guy just couldn't com
prehend that this was something that
these great men would do.
Have students ever asked you for
advice on their personal sex lives?
Very rarely. I think they realize that
my role as a teacher is not that of a ther
apist.
One instance that comes to my mind
involved a young man who had been, you
know, fairly active sexually in high school
but had not had sexual intercourse. He
now had a girlfriend, and at one point,
somewhat to his surprise, she had sug
gested it.
And under those circumstances he
simply couldn't have an erection. So he
was obviously very surprised, and rather
upset. In this case I did talk to him at
some length.
How does your use of humor affect
your teaching?

There are several components
to my so-called humor. One is that
I speak a certain way, so that even
when I am not trying to be
humorous some people think it's
funny. You see, I grew up in the
Middle East and I am used to
speaking in parables and
metaphors and caricatures. And
this strikes people sometimes as
being humorous.
But I will also deliberately use
humor. I find that humor greatly
helps to put people at ease and
everyone is in a more relaxed
frame of mind and also it helps to
make a point once in a while.
Many students are often
surprised at the way you
teach about abortion, show
ing both sides of this complex
social issue. How do you see
the future of the abortion
debate in this county?
That's a hard question. I have
two scenarios. One possibility is
for this debate to become even
more polarized, where people sim

ply don't hear anymore what the
other side is saying. So there's no
dialogue.
Or, it's going to become more
rational, whereby people will be
both more understanding and
respectful of each other's opinions
and we will be able to say, "Well,
this is what we are entitled to
think and believe as individuals.
But as a group we need to come to
some acceptable conclusion which
is going to make nobody happy,
but which will be possible to toler
ate."
What kinds of changes in
law do you anticipate in the
area of sexuality in the next
decade?
I can say something about the
areas where the law is likely to
change; I can't tell exactly what
the law is going to be. Clearly,
there is going to be a lot of legisla
tion dealing with the conse
quences of new reproductive tech
nology. That's a wide-open and
highly problematic area.
Which areas of the curricu
lum do you think absolutely
merit a distribution require
ment?

I was the dean of undergradu
ate education when the current
distribution requirements were
set up. So I had a lot to do with
them.
I did not participate in the cur
rent debate. My concern is that we
cannot make the distribution
requirements the battleground
for the issue of diversity or repre
sentation.
It's not distribution require
ments as such, but the educa
tional program as a whole, which
must make sure that all the
important social issues are
addressed.
Are you ever tempted to
commercialize your subject?
Sexuality never was nor is it
now my primary interest, because
some of the people who are in it
make me nervous, partly because
of the tendency to commercialize
and too many axes to grind.
And as long as this continues,
universities are not going to pay
serious attention to it. This is
why, despite the fact that there
has been a modern field of human
sexuality now for 30 years, there
is not a single serious Stanford
level department or program in
the entire country.

that one year when I wasn't here, some
body else taught the course and there
were only 40 students. So I assume the
way the course is taught may also be a
factor.
Some people may take the class
because so many others have taken it.
This was more of a factor earlier when we
used to meet in Memorial Auditorium
and we had 1,200 students.
And this was also in the height of the

'60s and '70s, and I
think some students
took it as an act of rebel
lion so that they could
write home and say,
"Guess what course I'm
taking." I don't think
that works anymore.
More seriously, sexu
ality concerns students
in a very personal way at

many levels. From an academic perspec
tive, the interdisciplinary focus may be
another attraction. I know of no other
course which covers as broad a range of
topics from biology, behavior and culture.
Are you ever surprised at the
knowledge (or lack thereof) students
have regarding sex and sexuality?
I have ceased to be surprised after so
many years. Occasionally I am surprised.
You know, there is a huge range in back
grounds in this respect in that class.
One young woman told me that until
she heard the lecture on autoeroticism,
she was not aware that all these years
what she was doing was called masturba
tion.
Another student in class first heard

about transsexuals in class, and realized
that he was a transsexual. He subse
quently went into treatment and had
transsexual surgery.
I am giving you the more dramatic
(examples), but I think most people learn
something. Some more than others.
Do you think your Hum Sex class
promotes sexual promiscuity at
Stanford?
My gut reaction is that it does not. The
main impact of these classes appear to be
on attitudes, not on behavior. There are
many factors that shape behavior.
Simply because you hear a lecture on
sexual intercourse, you don't say, "Oh,
well, gee, so that's what it is, let me go
and try it out." It just doesn't work that

way, I don't think.
But it does seem to
have an impact on stu
dents' attitudes. A per
son becomes more
accepting of his or her
own sexuality and more
tolerant of the sexuality
of others different as
that may be from one's
own.

What's the most unusual question
you've gotten?
The lecture included a discussion of
artificial insemination. And I said some
thing about Nobel laureates . . . having
donated sperm to a Southern California
sperm bank.
So, lecture finished, and student came
up and said, "Can I ask you a question?"
"Sure."
He said, "How do they get the sperm
out of the Nobel laureate?"
I said, "How do you think they get it
out?"
He said, "Is there some kind of
machine?"
I said, "Why do you need a machine?"
He said, "You mean. ..." and then he
made a hand gesture.

I said, "Yeah, that's exactly how they
get it."
He said, "I'll be damned."
You see, for him, the idea of a Nobel
laureate masturbating was absolutely
beyond belief. This guy just couldn't com
prehend that this was something that
these great men would do.
Have students ever asked you for
advice on their personal sex lives?
Very rarely. I think they realize that
my role as a teacher is not that of a ther
apist.
One instance that comes to my mind
involved a young man who had been, you
know, fairly active sexually in high school
but had not had sexual intercourse. He
now had a girlfriend, and at one point,
somewhat to his surprise, she had sug
gested it.
And under those circumstances he
simply couldn't have an erection. So he
was obviously very surprised, and rather
upset. In this case I did talk to him at
some length.
How does your use of humor affect
your teaching?

There are several components
to my so-called humor. One is that
I speak a certain way, so that even
when I am not trying to be
humorous some people think it's
funny. You see, I grew up in the
Middle East and I am used to
speaking in parables and
metaphors and caricatures. And
this strikes people sometimes as
being humorous.
But I will also deliberately use
humor. I find that humor greatly
helps to put people at ease and
everyone is in a more relaxed
frame of mind and also it helps to
make a point once in a while.
Many students are often
surprised at the way you
teach about abortion, show
ing both sides of this complex
social issue. How do you see
the future of the abortion
debate in this county?
That's a hard question. I have
two scenarios. One possibility is
for this debate to become even
more polarized, where people sim

ply don't hear anymore what the
other side is saying. So there's no
dialogue.
Or, it's going to become more
rational, whereby people will be
both more understanding and
respectful of each other's opinions
and we will be able to say, "Well,
this is what we are entitled to
think and believe as individuals.
But as a group we need to come to
some acceptable conclusion which
is going to make nobody happy,
but which will be possible to toler
ate."
What kinds of changes in
law do you anticipate in the
area of sexuality in the next
decade?
I can say something about the
areas where the law is likely to
change; I can't tell exactly what
the law is going to be. Clearly,
there is going to be a lot of legisla
tion dealing with the conse
quences of new reproductive tech
nology. That's a wide-open and
highly problematic area.
Which areas of the curricu
lum do you think absolutely
merit a distribution require
ment?

I was the dean of undergradu
ate education when the current
distribution requirements were
set up. So I had a lot to do with
them.
I did not participate in the cur
rent debate. My concern is that we
cannot make the distribution
requirements the battleground
for the issue of diversity or repre
sentation.
It's not distribution require
ments as such, but the educa
tional program as a whole, which
must make sure that all the
important social issues are
addressed.
Are you ever tempted to
commercialize your subject?
Sexuality never was nor is it
now my primary interest, because
some of the people who are in it
make me nervous, partly because
of the tendency to commercialize
and too many axes to grind.
And as long as this continues,
universities are not going to pay
serious attention to it. This is
why, despite the fact that there
has been a modern field of human
sexuality now for 30 years, there
is not a single serious Stanford
level department or program in
the entire country.
