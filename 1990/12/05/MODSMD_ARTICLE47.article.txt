# Researcher: Quake wasn't San Andreas' fault
## 
### Miranda Doyle Staff writer 
Last vear's Loma Prieta
earthquake may not have been
on the San Andreas fault, and
the possibility of another North
ern California temblor is higher
because pressures on the San
Andreas were not completely
relieved, a Stanford researcher
has asserted.
Paul Segall, associate profes
sor of geophysics, co-authored a
report appearing in the Nov. 30
issue of Science Magazine com
paring the Loma Prieta earth
quake to a computer study of
ground displacement during the
1906 San Francisco earthquake.
He is presenting his paper today
at an American Geophysical

Union convention in San Fran
cisco.
According to co-author
Michael Lisowski of the U.S.
Geological Survey in Menlo
Park, the two earthquakes were
very different, which suggests
that another fault runs along
side the San Andreas but
diverges and curves southwest
toward Santa Cruz.
"The Loma Prieta earth
quake released a lot of the stress,
but there is probably still more,"
Lisowski said. "We are not pre
dicting another earthquake, but
the danger is non-negligible."
Shortly after last October's
temblor, which registered 7.1 on
the Richter scale, most scientists
concluded the epicenter was
along the San Andreas fault. If

this is true, pressures on the
fault in Santa Cruz would have
been relieved, and the chances of
another earthquake in that
region would be small.
But Segall and Lisowski
believe a different fault was
involved and stress on the San
Andreas was not completely
released last year. "There is
some strain left to be relieved,"
said Lisowski. "It may not hap
pen for another 100 years, but
the hazard is there."
The pair began their research
last March. They wanted to
recompute the earth's angle
changes from the 1906 earth
quake.
Using triangulation surveys
done before 1906, Segall and
Lisowski found inconsistencies

in the studies done after that
earthquake. Surveyors appar
ently had displacements going in
the wrong direction.
By comparing studies of
Loma Prieta mountain, the
highest in the Santa Cruz chain,
the scientists found that it
moved in different directions in
the two earthquakes. This
should not have happened if the
Loma Prieta earthquake was on
the same fault as the 1906 earth
quake was.
In 1906, the mountain moved
a meter to the southeast. In
1989, it moved about a fifth of
that distance due south. The dif
ference in magnitude of the
motion appears to be the same
as the difference in magnitude
between the two quakes.
