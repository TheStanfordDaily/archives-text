No charges will be filed follow
ing a domestic fight in Crothers
Hall two weeks ago, Stanford
Police said Monday.
The fight, involving a Stanford
law student and a woman who was
apparently his girlfriend, took
place Nov. 18.
"Initially, there were allega
tions that he assaulted her," said
Stanford Police Capt. Marvin
Moore. "After interviewing both
of them, we determined that it
could be a mutual combat situa
tion."
Moore said the man could have
been charged with aggravated
assault and that the woman could
have been charged with either
brandishing a weapon or assault

with a deadly weapon.
The man was detained and
released last week.
The case was referred to the
Santa Clara County District
Attorney's Office, which
announced Friday it would not file
charges against either.

For the record

An article in Friday's Daily
quoted Trancos RA Matt Eldridge
as saying that Trancos would con
tinue to buy alcohol with dorm
funds. Eldridge later said the
dorm will not continue this prac
tice because it is prohibited under
the new University alcohol policy.
