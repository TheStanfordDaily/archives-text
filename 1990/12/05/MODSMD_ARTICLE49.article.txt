# Officials open Kingscote investigation after student complaints
## 
### Cecilia Tom Editorial staff 
Recent tenant criticisms have
prompted University officials to begin an
investigation into the management prac
tices at Kingscote Gardens apartments.
The apartments, at 586 Lagunita Dr.,
belong to Graeme Howard, who leases the
land from Stanford. The lease will expire
in 1997.
The University is "looking into" possi
ble breaches of Howard's obligation to
Stanford, according to Senior University
Counsel Jasper Williams, although he
would not disclose the contents of the
lease.
Williams said the investigation is
fueled in part by a Nov. 20 Daily article
which detailed complaints of student ten
ants in the apartment building.
He said the University is justified in
undertaking the investigation because
Howard's obligations to tenants may
overlap with his obligations to Stanford.
However, no action will be planned until
more information is available, Williams
added.
He did not specify when the investiga
tion will be completed or what action the
University might take.
In a letter to Howard dated Nov. 9, 16
students expressed dissatisfaction over
building manager Lyn Mack and her
unwillingness to "repair and maintain
the premises" in a timely manner.
Trie students received notes dated Nov.
26 — apparently in response to the Daily

article — from Michael O'Brien,
Kingscote's property manager, saying
there were several other groups willing to
take over their leases if they wanted to
move out. The letter advised them to see
Mack for details because of the "now
lengthy waiting list for Kingscote Gar
dens caused by The Daily article."
Angela Bakker, a junior who drafted
the original complaint letter, informed
Mack last Saturday that she intends to
move out. But contrary to O'Brien's
letter, Mack told her no one is ready to
move into her apartment, Bakker said.
She said O'Brien's letter is just "an
empty gesture" for use by the manage
ment company when it wants to try to
evict tenants. The letter is "indicative of
how warped the mentality is at
Kingscote," she added.
O'Brien and Mack could not be
reached for comment.
A lawyer for Bakker and her roommate
Laurel Sullivan advised them they are
under no obligation to move out unless
Kingscote secures a tenant for the apart
ment.
Besides undergraduate students, sev
eral faculty and staff members have expe
rienced similar problems with Kingscote
management.
Ellen Pledger, a staff coordinator at
the School of Medicine, said she moved
out of her apartment last July when she
"couldn't take the harassment any
longer." Mack sued her for breaking the
lease, and they will face each other in
small claims court on Jan. 18.

Pledger said Mack has no ground to
sue her because Bakker and Sullivan
were waiting to move into her apartment.
She added she would only have been
liable for breaking the lease if no new ten
ants could be found.
What is unusual, Pledger said, is that
Bakker and Sullivan could not move into
the apartment for five days after they
paid the rent for September. Bakker said
Mack cited apartment cleaning as the rea
son for the delay — two months after
Pledger moved out.
Mack is suing "in a punitive manner"
because she was not given the 30-day
notice of termination, Pledger asserted.
She said Mack was aware of her plans to
move out since April, when she informed
Pledger that her lease would not be
renewed after its expiration on Aug. 31.
Pledger said Mack was away on vaca
tion when she moved out — "the most
peaceful point in my whole existence [at
Kingscote]."
Pledger's boyfriend Mark Jacobs, who
moved in with her in December, said
Mack once called Pledger at work and
protested the way he smiled at her.
Mack was complaining about some
thing at the time, Jacobs explained. "I
smiled to show congeniality, instead of
saying 'Get out of my face, woman!' What
else can I do?"
He added that Mack once threatened
to tow his car away when he was unload
ing a microwave oven unless his friend
stayed in the car. Pledger said the request
was unreasonable because it was impossi

ble for one person to handle the load.
There was a "constant state of war
between what was permitted and what
was not," Pledger said, citing another
instance when Mack refused to call a tow
truck even though "there really was an
unauthorized car parked in [her] space."
Richard Stifel, who graduated last
June, sued Mack and the management
company for towing his car away while he
was visiting his friend lan Bremmer in
Kingscote on July 30.
Stifel said he was unloading some gro
ceries at Bremmer's apartment when his
car was towed. Mack, who lives on the
first floor of Kingscote, refused to open
her apartment door or talk to him when
he inquired about his car, Stifel said.
It cost him $150 and an overnight
effort to recover his car, Stifel added.
Stifel lost his small claims case in
court, as he acknowledged that Kingscote
was private property and that he did not
belong there. Still, he maintained that he
was inconvenienced, both when his car
was towed and when Mack refused to sign
for a court summons sent by certified
mail.
He had to hire a private investigator to
deliver the subpoena personally, Stifel
said.
Despite the incident, Bremmer said he
knows "a lot of people who are happy" at
Kingscote.
Patricia Mabrouk, who lived in
Kingscote for a year as a post-doctoral
student, is not one of them. She said the
management company "willfully tried to

withhold" her security deposit when she
moved out on Aug. 10.
Mabrouk said that after vacating her
apartment for two weeks and leaving
multiple phone messages for Mack and
O'Brien, her check was not sent. She
finally sought help from Carmen Jevons,
Stanford's assistant ombudsperson, who
called Mack on her behalf on Aug. 28, a
Tuesday.
Jevons said Mack told her the check
had been mailed the previous Friday, but
Mabrouk said that when she received her
check Aug. 30, she discovered the enve
lope was postmarked Aug. 29.
"This provides irrefutable evidence
that Ms. Mack and Mr. O'Brien had no
intention of refunding my security
deposit. The postmark also makes it clear
that the phone call made by [JevonsJ gal
vanized [the management company] to
refund my check," Mabrouk asserted.
Jevons said the Ombudsperson's office
tries to resolve problems and examine
grievances of students and community
members but does not provide legal
advice.
Mabrouk said she also consulted with
Bill Faulkner from the ASSU Legal Coun
seling Services, who advised her to cite
the California Civil Code when demand
ing her refund and, if necessary, initiate a
suit in small claims court.
Faulkner has previously refused to
verify that his office had been advising
students from Kingscote.
