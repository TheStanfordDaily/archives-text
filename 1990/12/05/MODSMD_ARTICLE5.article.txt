# Budget cuts stunt growth of community centers
## 
### Minal Hajratwala Staff writer 
Although funding for Stanford's eight
community centers has virtually escaped
University's $22 million in budget cuts, the
centers' ability to continue to develop has
been curtailed, according to directors.
The centers include the four ethnic com
munity centers, as well as Bechtel Interna
tional Center, the Disability Resource Cen
ter, the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Commu
nity Center and the Women's Center.
As multicultural ism has become more
important to the University's mission, the
ethnic community centers have begun to be
institutionalized during the past five years.

according to Keith Archuleta, director of
the Black Community Services Center.
They are thus at a crucial juncture in their
development into full-fledged University
organizations.
The community centers — designed to
provide services for and education about
campus minority groups — are part of
Campus Affairs, a subdivision of the Office
of Student Affairs headed by Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Michael Jackson.
"Despite the budget (cuts), the Campus
Affairs centers are playing a more integral
role in the University's academic mission,"
Jackson said.
The oldest and largest of the community
centers, the I-Center, is the only one whose

budget was actually cut — by 15 percent.
"The [other] community centers are
young, underdeveloped and underfunded,
so any cut would effectively cripple them,"
according to Program and Fraternal Affairs
Adviser Michael Ramsey-Perez.
"Across the University, people have had
to take 12 to 30 percent budget cuts,"
observed Jackson. By not cutting the cen
ters' budgets, he said, Stanford "has made a
real strong statement that the community
centers are very important institutions."
Although many of the centers' base bud

gets show a slight increase this vear, there
will be less money available for special
requests, Jackson said.
Including salaries, the four ethnic com
munity centers have a combined budget of
half a million dollars, Jackson said.
More growth still needed
But center directors argue the need for
growth is urgent if they are to become fully
functional facilities. "We did not have cuts,
but we have been put on hold for the next
steps to get up to a sufficient level," said
Jim Larimore, director of the Native Amer
ican Cultural Center.
Although the centers receive
different amounts of funding for
staff and equipment, "we're in
pretty much the same boat," Lari
more said.
"We remain underfunded for
office supplies and equipment. We
have had to take some program
ming money and use it for day-to
day expenses," he said.
Frances Morales, in her second
year as director of El Centro Chi
cano, said, "Last year they found
money to build a wall so that we
could have an office. But it is still
a little makeshift; we are still
waiting to have ... basic things
like a desk that is functional."
Rick Yuen, director of the
Asian American Activities Center,
said, "Departments that have
been around have the benefits of
being institutionalized. We've
been in the developing stages."
"By being forced to cut back,
some people in other departments
have a sense of what it's like to
function underfunded, which we
have done for years," Larimore
said. "But that is a lesson I really
would not wish on anybody."
Several center directors said
they were asked to come up with
three scenarios last spring for cut
ting 5, 10 and 15 percent of their

budgets.
"At 5 percent, we would have
cut Black History Month,"
Archuleta said. "At 10, we would
have cut staff," Archuleta said.
But Morales said, "We had no
place to cut. We would have been
cutting essentials like tele
phones." Currently, student
groups who use El Centro phones
must pay part of the cost.
UCMI: A dream deferred?
In its March 1989 report, the
University Committee on Minor
ity Issues recommended six steps
to strengthen the four ethnic
community centers.
Although University officials
vowed last spring that budget cuts
would not affect the progress of
UCMI, "it seems that is exactly
what is being hurt," Archuleta
said, noting that many of the Uni
versity employees laid off have
been people of color.
"Expectations were raised ...
in the student population and in
the University itself that our
needs would start being met," he
said. "There is a tension between
what is and what should be."
But some administrators
believe the centers are progress
ing at a reasonable rate. "In this
budget atmosphere, some hopes
are going to be deferred a little
bit," Jackson said.
One UCMI-recommended
change that has been fully imple

mented is hiring for each center a
full-time director who also serves
as an assistant dean of Student
Affairs.
"Having full-time directors
really helps because it gives the
centers real legitimacy," said
Morales, who works 10 to 12
hours a day and sometimes on the
weekend. "But we are really over
extended in terms of staff."
The UCMI report also recom
mended that each center employ
three full-time staff members by
this fall. But in light of cam
puswide layoffs, "more staff is on
the back burner, clearly," Jackson
said.
Other UCMI recommendations
also remain to be met.
"Space is an immediate con
cern, because student organiza
tions can feel that squeeze," Yuen
said, noting that 35 student orga
nizations regularly meet at the
Asian American Activities Center.
"Meetings are often doubled
booked."
An additional burden
In a spirit of cooperation many
attribute to UCMI, University
departments such as the Office of
Residential Affairs and the Public
Service Center now routinely
work with center staff to coordi
nate programs on multicultural
ism.
"UCMI told the whole Univer

sity to use the community cen
ters, which is great," Archuleta
said. "But it is frustrating because
we don't have the resources to
match those growing relation
ships," he added.
"Without having the internal
staffing level increase, that [coop
eration] is just more work on the
shoulders of fewer people," Lari
more said.
Center staff are thus forced to
choose between supporting others
with multicultural programming
and serving their own constituent
student communities.
"I feel worst about the fact that
Stanford students aren't getting
very much information about
American Indian and Alaska
Native history in the curriculum,"
Larimore said. "The education
falls to the centers; we function as
a University resource center."
But because of lack of funding
and staff time, "we cannot lend
very much support to others who
are trying to make the effort," he
noted.
Uncertainty for the future
"Repositioning" has had few
positive effects on the centers,
directors said.
At Bechtel International Cen
ter, there have been "little glim
mers" of positive effects, but
these are few and far between,
said Director Jon Pearson. "In
general, it's a nightmare."

'In this budget atmosphere, some
hopes are going to be deferred a little
bit.'

Compounding the chronic
underfunding of some centers is
continued uncertainty about the
state of the budget.
"Nothing is really certain,"
Morales said. "For a while you
think it is, and then it's not
again."
University officials have indi
cated that the centers may be
asked to hold some of the money
budgeted for this year in reserve
for next year, Morales said.
"If there is another round of
this, I don't know where people
can cut any further without a big
effect on students," Pearson said.
Jackson said he is currently
starting an analysis "to see where
we were and where we are going"
in terms of funding and resource
allocation.
All of the centers are seeking
alternative sources of funding
including alumni donations, he
said.
The I-Center already receives
gifts from alumni and others for
small projects and is looking at
ways to increase its income by
renting out its guest room and
allowing more weddings to take

place there.
The LGBCC has received some
unsolicited funds from alumni
which paid for some staff time last
year, according to Ramsey-Perez.
However, concerted fund rais
ing efforts require staff time —
something many of the centers
are already short on.
"I want to do more work with
alumni," Morales said. "During
the summer I had time to think
about fund raising. But during
the school year, I have no extra
time."
Archuleta said, "If we had the
basics, I would be more than will
ing to work with the Office of
Development and the Alumni
Association to fund raise."
Despite the frustrations of
dealing with limited resources,
however, most directors concede
that the budget cuts are neces
sary.
"I look at it as growing pains
Stanford is going through," Yuen
said. "There are very few univer
sities that are developing this way.
... I really believe Stanford wants
to move into the next 100 years in
a good way."
