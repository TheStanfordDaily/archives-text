# Budget cuts stunt growth of community centers

### Minal Hajratwala Staff writer 
Although funding for Stanford's eight
community centers has virtually escaped
University's $22 million in budget cuts, the
centers' ability to continue to develop has
been curtailed, according to directors.
The centers include the four ethnic com
munity centers, as well as Bechtel Interna
tional Center, the Disability Resource Cen
ter, the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Commu
nity Center and the Women's Center.
As multicultural ism has become more
important to the University's mission, the
ethnic community centers have begun to be
institutionalized during the past five years.

according to Keith Archuleta, director of
the Black Community Services Center.
They are thus at a crucial juncture in their
development into full-fledged University
organizations.
The community centers — designed to
provide services for and education about
campus minority groups — are part of
Campus Affairs, a subdivision of the Office
of Student Affairs headed by Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Michael Jackson.
"Despite the budget (cuts), the Campus
Affairs centers are playing a more integral
role in the University's academic mission,"
Jackson said.
The oldest and largest of the community
centers, the I-Center, is the only one whose

budget was actually cut — by 15 percent.
"The [other] community centers are
young, underdeveloped and underfunded,
so any cut would effectively cripple them,"
according to Program and Fraternal Affairs
Adviser Michael Ramsey-Perez.
"Across the University, people have had
to take 12 to 30 percent budget cuts,"
observed Jackson. By not cutting the cen
ters' budgets, he said, Stanford "has made a
real strong statement that the community
centers are very important institutions."
Although many of the centers' base bud

gets show a slight increase this vear, there
will be less money available for special
requests, Jackson said.
Including salaries, the four ethnic com
munity centers have a combined budget of
half a million dollars, Jackson said.
More growth still needed
But center directors argue the need for
growth is urgent if they are to become fully
functional facilities. "We did not have cuts,
but we have been put on hold for the next
steps to get up to a sufficient level," said
Jim Larimore, director of the Native Amer
ican Cultural Center.
