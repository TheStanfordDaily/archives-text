# Contemporary holiday classics
## Some pop artists can capture the holiday spirit in song 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
No time for introductions.
Here's a list of the top 10 Christ
mas songs by rock artists — ever.
10) Joan Jett & the Black
hearts, "Little Drummer Boy."
Jett — the woman who brought
you such classic versions of clas
sics "I Love Rock and Roll" and
"Crimson and Clover" belts out
the seasonal standby like its never
been belted before.
9) U2, "Christmas (Baby
Please Come Home)." A relatively
obscure, upbeat ditty by rock's
most over-rated band. They incor
porate Christian imagery in many
of their songs ("I Still Haven't
Found What I'm Looking For,"
etc.), so they were a natural for this
list.
8) Bryan Adams, "Reggae
Christmas." I was a Bryan Adams
fan in my junior high days and I
hear the video for this one is quite
good.
7) Bruce Springsteen & the E
Street Band, "Merry Christmas
Baby." Amen.
6) The Alarm, "Happy Christ
mas (War is Over)." Tnis tune,

performed better by others (see
selection #4) is one of those new
tunes added on to a greatest hits
package. I find this practice rather
offensive. But, the greatest hits
package itself, titled "Standards," is
quite good.
5) Bob & Doug McKenzie,
"The 12 Days of Christmas."
Geddy Lee of Rush did not perform
on this one. He did sing backup on
another tune off the same album
by these northern hosers. Never
theless, the irreverant version of
the Christmas classic makes my
list.
4) John Lennon, "Happy
Christmas (War is Over)." See
selection #6.
3) Band Aid, "Do They Know
It's Christmas?" So what the hell
happened to Live Aid, Band Aid,
We are the World, We are the Chil
dren, Hands Across America and
all that stuff? Does hunger no
longer exist?
2) John Cougar Mellencamp,
"I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa
Claus." On this introspective
offering, Cougar explores the ten
sion between a married couple
heading into their second decade
together. Movine.

1) Bruce Springsteen & the E
Street Band, "Santa Claus is
Coming to Town." A far and away
winner. Recorded in 1975 (that was
15 years ago if you can believe it),
Bruce proves he's the Boss on this
one. And you better be good for
goodness sake. . . .
lb fill the space I've been allot
ted, here are a couple songs that
weren't so good and therefore
didn't make my list (in no particu
lar order):
Bon Jovi, "Back Door Santa."
No explanation needed.
Stevie Nicks, "Silent Night." I
like Stevie Nicks. But my mother
does a better job on this one.
AC/DC, "Hell's Bells." A fine
song but it just didn't fit the cate
gory.
Madonna, "Santa Baby." The
video was just a little too sexually
oriented for my puritanical ways.
Spank me.

appearance in Intermission. In his
first, many issues ago, he reviewed
several movies he hadn't seen.
