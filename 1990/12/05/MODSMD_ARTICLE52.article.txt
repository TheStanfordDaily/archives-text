# Hollywood's holiday treats: Not all gifts come under trees
## 
### Mara Winokur Tims better half 
Christmas break. All that free time.
What will you do? What will you do?
If you're like me, you'll mope. You can't
complain about it. Bitching about being in
school is one thing, but bitching about not
being in school? My parents aren't all that
sympathetic about it. I bet yours aren't either.
They'll tell you to read a book. Am 1 right?
Right.
Like you don't get enough of that during
the year.
I, personally, don't want to do ANY
THING that involves any of the higher brain
functions or three- or more syllabic words.
And I've already seen the latest Rocky film.
Fortunately, there are a whole slew (what a
neat word!) of films coming out. Soon.
And here they are. More or less. I'm work
ing on a minimum amount of information
and a maximum amount of supposition. The
Daily will not be held accountable for any
errors in time, place or plot. As usual.
December 7
"The Rookie." Clint Eastwood and Char
lie Sheen star as a pair of mismatched cops
thrown together for a car-theft investigation.
Looks like another film of the "old wise
cop/new wet-behind-the-cars cop" genre, but

Eastwood's good at this type of role. Doesn't
look too bad.
December 12
"Come See the Paradise." Racial injustice
at its worst. Dennis Quaid plays an Ameri
can whose Japanese American wife and child
spend part of World War II in an interment
camp. Sounds really uplifting.
December 14
Big day at the movies. "Edward Scis
sorhands," starring Winona Ryder and John
ny Depp, is about a man who has scissors for
hands. No joke. He becomes a hit with the
ladies because of his hair-styling ability. That
is the truth, I swear.
Sean Connery is back with Michelle Pfeif
fer in"The Russia House." He's a British
publisher, she's a Russian something-or
other. I presume they fall in love and make
one of Hollywood's best-looking couples.
And, though he backed out of "Predator
2," Arnold Schwarzenegger comes through in
the clutch with "Kindergarten Cop." Going
undercover as a teachei; Schwarzenegger has
trouble with a room full of five-year-olds. If 1
were five, I would listen to him.
December 19
Another book goes to the movies with
"Bonfire of the Vanities," starring Tbm
Hanks, Mclanie Griffith and Bruce Willis. If
you've read the book, this is bound to be a

disappointment. If not, don't until after you
see the film. Trust me.
"Havana." I'm not really sure what this is
about, but it stars Robert Redford. I think it's
"Out of Africa" goes to Cuba. Lena Olin plays
his woman.
"Awakenings" stars Robert De Niro as a
man who's been asleep for 30 years, and
Robin Williams as the doctor who wakes him
up. Doesn't this sound like a story you read
as a child?
December 21
Winona Ryder in yet another movie,
"Mermaids." Here she plays Cher's daughter;
and not a happy one at that. Seems Mom's a
little easy-going. Or easy, as the case may be.
No one knows about the title, it seems.
December 25
Do I really have to tell you? Everybody
knows this is when the long-awaited and
much-promoted "Godfather III" comes out.
A 1 Pacino playing his most famous role.
Again. This time it's 20 years later and he's
trying to get his life on the right side of the
law. Before you get too excited, think about

how long those lines at the theater

arc going to be. Mom's not

going to let you skip the

family thing to
wait for tickets;
mark my

words.
Competing for the crowds on Christmas is
"Scenes from a Mall," starring Woody Allen
and Bette Midler as a husband and wife look
ing for each other's 15th anniversary pre
sents. Sounds fascinating. Kind of like the
Hone Shopping Network.
Also in December
"Mr. and Mrs. Bridges," with Paul New
man and Joanne Woodward as husband and
wife. So good, it almost seems real.
"Look Who's Talking Tbo," with John Tra-

volta and Kirstie Alley. Mikey gets a siste^

with the voice of Roseanne Bart Enough

to scar a kid for life.
"Almost an Angel," with Paul
Hogan as a thief who wakes up one
day and thinks he's an angel.

And "Once Around," with

Holly Hunter and Richard
Dreyfuss. This time
they're both alive.
