Blame it on Art
Many strange things are done for Art's sake. This weekend, Art
won't be disappointed about what's in store for him. Dancers David
Parsons, Peter Pucci and Molissa Fenley will be performing their
unusual solo works Sat. at 8 p.m. in Memorial Auditorium. In
Parsons' trademark solo, "Caught," strobe light effects create the
illusion that he never touches the ground. Pucci also performs orig
inal works that include "13' x 13'," where he jumps, claws, clutch
es and whirls around in a 13-foot space, wearing only his under
wear. Fenley will dance "State of Darkness," a Northern California
premiere that uses a darkened stage background to spotlight each
muscle movement. Potential viewers should be warned: her perfor
mance contains partial nudity. Tickets, available at Tresidder, are
$16 to $22, not including a $3 student discount.
Strung out?
The Stanford String Quartet's second concert of the season is
tomorrow at 8 p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditorium. The program
includes Mozart, Turina and Dvorak, as well as a West Coast pre
miere of a recorder piece by Ezra Laderman called "Talkin'-Lovin'-
Leavin'."
