# ON THE TUBE
## Holidays: Top TV time 
### 
There are still 20 shopping
days left until Christmas.
However, it's time now to
prepare for the annual cavalcade
of holiday television specials. So
put those books aside, quit
moaning about finals, and get
ready for some serious TV
watching. Forget May and
November Sweeps, this is
clearly the grandest part of the
year to immerse yourself in the
tube.
The "official" TV holiday
season begins tomorrow with
TNT's airing of the timeless
Frank Capra classic "It's a Won
derful Life." From then until
early January, Stewart's most
tender film can likely be found
somewhere on cable at any time
of the day. Tb miss this flick is
tantamount to skipping that
second glass of egg nog on
Christmas Day.
Be sure to make time for
such other seasonal treats as
"Miracle on 34th," in which a
young Natalie Wood encounters
the real Santa Claus in a depart
ment store, and Bing Crosby's
splendid movie rendition of
"White Christmas" in "Holiday
Inn." Even if you have to con
tend with a "colorized" version,
these nostalgic treats should
not be overlooked.
Perhaps the most wonderful
moments in the next month
will be provided by the ani
mated "children's" specials.
While aimed at a pre-teen audi
ence, these yearly gems allow
viewers of any age to revel in
memories of simpler days.
While any ranking of this
genre will be a highly personal
affair, here are my top five all
time favorite Christmas spe
cials. (Drum roll, please.)
5. "Frosty the Snowman."
Granted, the animation is a bit

flat and Jimmy Durante belts
out a rather husky version of the
holiday ditty, but this one has
all the elements of a good story.
You're lying if you claim you
weren't seriously upset as a kid
when the evil magician locked
old Frosty in the greenhouse.
4. "The Peanuts' Christmas
Special." Linus delivers a pas
sionate narrative on the true
meaning of the season. Charlie
Brown buys a lame tree. Snoopy
builds the coolest light display.
Pure Charles Schulz magic.
3. "Santa Claus is Coming
to Town." A terrific hour-long
tale chronicling young Kris
Kringle that has been inexplica
bly missing from the networks
the past few seasons. Hosted by
Fred Astaire, the show boasts
such memorable characters as
"Burger Meister-Meister Burg
er" and a really spooky winter
warlock. This special provides
the origins for that catchy tune,
"Just Put One' Foot in Front of
the Other" that is probably
lodged somewhere in your
unconscious.
2. "Rudolph, the Red-Nosed
Reindeer." The standard for all
marionette-based Christmas
stories. I still get a warm feeling
from Burl Ives' version of "Silver
and Gold." Yukon Cornelius
may be the funniest character
on all of holiday TV.
1. "How The Grinch Stole
Christmas." The Dr. Scuss clas
sic makes its TNT debut this
Thursday night. Find a friend
with cable and tape "The Simp
sons" — "The Grinch" is sim
ply delightful holiday fare. Boris
Karlov's narration of Seuss'
richly woven tale adds to its spe
cial feel. It's not only entertain
ing, but holds a grand metaphor
with year-long significance.
