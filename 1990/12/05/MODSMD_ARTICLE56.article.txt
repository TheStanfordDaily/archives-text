# Holidays are here, but how would we know?

### 
OH, BY THE WAY, it's December. Sur
prised? In this wonderschool of palm
lovers' trees and dust-covered skis, is
there any way at all that we can tell the holidays
are approaching? Not everyone, after all, can be
like "earthquake" Iben Browning, able to predict
the future from the sun, the moon and the "lost
pets" section of the classifieds. (No offense,
Iben, but maybe we should lay off "The Omen"
trilogy for a while, hmm?)
So what, then, is there at Stanford that tells
us the holidays are near? What clues are there
that will knock us into that seasonal spirit?
Well, it isn't the change in weather. Mainly
because there isn't one. Not a hint of rain, let
alone snow, greets us here, and California's
quintessential holiday weather song, "I'm
Dreaming of a Wet Christmas," just doesn't
have the same spirited effect. Besides, wet
dreams have no place in holiday celebrations.
And it's not the approach of finals, for the
same reason: nothing changes. Dead Week is as
grand a Stanford myth as Lake Lag. About the
only difference between it and any other week is
that upperclassmen, listening to the primal
screams, can play "Name that Freshman
Dorm."
It may be Food, Folks and Fun — not
McDonald's, but Thanksgiving dinner — that
gets us into seasonal spirits. But then again:
Every family, it seems, has one completely
random relative that they would otherwise
never admit knowing, let alone being related to,
but every year feels obligated to unchain, dust
off, and bring out of the closet for Thanksgiving
dinner. And every year brings a new disaster.
You know the type: He's usually like My
Dear Friend Chester's Uncle Arnie: loud,
swinging single, pushing 40, whatever hair he
has left combed up and back in a slick Jon
Lovitz wave, sitting behind a plate of food that
would dwarf Marge Simpson's hairdo, talking
about his latest get-rich-quick plan. The rest of
the family smiles sickly and stares uncomfort
ably into their yams, hoping they won't be too
embarrassed, but there's no escaping the fact
that some time over the weekend he's going to
turn the channel off of "Miracle on 34th Street"
because he has an important bet placed on
"American Gladiators."
Well. It isn't the increase in shopping, as the
generic Stanford freshman agonizes for days
before deciding what to get each member of the
family. Tfell me, kiddies, if this list looks famil
iar:
Little sister — Stanford sweatshirt (M);
Mom — Stanford sweatshirt (L);
Big brother — Stanford sweatshirt (XL);
Dad — Stanford sweatshirt (XXXL);
Uncle Arnie — "The American Gladiators
Story" commemorative souvenir booklet, com
plete with full-color "Lace" pull-out.
Finally, it probably isn't any rise in religious
atmosphere. Call me a stark raving mad

lunatic, but Midnight Mass loses just a little
spiritual sanctity when it's held in the same
place that "The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, and
Her Lover" is scheduled for later that day.
No, despite the funky alliteration, mixing
Midnight Mass and the MemAud mentality
was probably a bad idea. Not that the audience
alternated cheering and hissing each Saint's
name as it was spoken, but I did have to resist a
crazy urge to crumple up my program and
throw it at the Brannerite across the aisle.
And the approach of Chanukah doesn't help
much either — after all, it's only a Menorahty
celebration.
Which leaves only one other alternative,
only one possible indication that the holidays
are upon us, unless I missed something (which
is entirely possible — this is the "Chris-miss"
season): fust in time for non-stop joyous cele
brations, immense feasts and an all-around
rocking month of festive goodwill, everybody
and her great grandmother gets sick.
My personal cold finally arrived last week,
just in the nick of time for Santa's approach —
shall we say, just in the time of Nick. ("Hey,
Chris, what's that I see approaching in the dis
tance, about a mile away now? Oh, must be
your joke . . ..")
I woke up feeling funny. Nothing unusual, I
thought. I'm a humor columnist. I'm supposed
to feel funny. But when I stopped sneezing long
enough to look in the mirror, I knew something
was wrong. No, I wasn't Ingrid Nava. Worse.
Overnight, it looked as if my face had slid about
an inch down from the rest of my head.
Bummer, man.
My eyes drooped, my nose sagged with the
weight of built-up mucous, and my mouth
formed a grimace that would make Leona
Helmsley look like a dolly in comparison.
I slipped on some sweats, popped a few
Advils, mussed up my hair for complete effect,
and headed off to class, hoping to sleep it off. No
luck. But as I rode back by Meyer, glancing at
the message on the vandalized Thinker, a bril
liant thought struck me: "Why didn't I go to
Cowell?"
Time Out for Tangent: Actually, the
statue's question, "Why didn't I go to Cal?" may
be a legitimate thought, if one ignores relative
crime rates, football scores and the city's 20-
year time lag in fashion statements. . .. How
bad is Berkeley culture? Imagine a mutant
strain of Lambda Nu running rampant through
the streets of Palo Alto, and you'll get the idea.
Back to the point: Stanford has over 12,000
thinkers on and around campus. Maybe it's
time to give Cal one of their own.
I enter Cowell Student Health Center and
walk up to the receptionist. "Hello, I have a
killer cold and my face also slipped out of place
overnight."
"Hmm . . . The cold we can help. No
facelifts, however. Have you been having any

hallucinations?"
"Well, last night I had a dream that I woke up
as Joel Stein."
"Any lasting effects? Infatuation with Fisher-
Price toys . . . outbursts of long hair . . . sudden
cravings for soft-serve ice cream?"
"Not that I can tell. But I was also wondering
if you took sperm donations here."
I fill out all the forms, take a number, steal
some tissues, and have a seat in the waiting
room. A stack of Time magazines sits on a
table. I pick one up and flip through it. Great. I
had been wondering what had happened last
August. These issues were so old my barber
shop wouldn't take them.
I look around at the five or six other patients
around me, each one of them losing pounds in
phlegm as they plow through their Kleenex
boxes.
Hmm, the girl next to me looks kind of cute.
I adjust my collar, glance over and, for one beau
tiful moment suspended in time, our eyes meet.
I smile. She smiles. Our hearts flutter, beat as
one. Hospital muzak tinkles in the background.
She smiles again. I smile again. She sniffs and
wipes her nose with the back of her hand.
Extending the same hand, she leans over and
whispers, "Hi, my name's Chelsea. Can you
keep a secret? I really enjoy bodily fluids."
Before I have time to look for the hidden
camera, my name is called. "Hi, can you keep a
secretion?" I ask, hand her my most recent
Kleenex, and walk quickly away, hoping her
fetish is satisfied.
And after three hours of pokes, prods, jabs,
queries, questions, shakes and coughs in Cow
ell, I emerge from the building, confident that I
will get better. I clutch the little white packet of
red cure-all pills firmly in hand, take a whiff of
the warm December air, and smile.
Who needs tinsel? Who needs dreidels? Who
needs George Bailey, Heat-Miser or "Rudolph's
Shiny New Year" to tell them what season it is?
I'VE GOT A VIRUS and my head feels like
about twelve Uncle Amies are jumping around
inside it, and dagnabbit, that's all I'll ever need
to remind me of the holidays.
I walk back home and puke with a feeling of
absolute peace and goodwill toward all
humankind, knowing that Chelsea would have
appreciated the beautiful moment.

I look around at the five or six other patients
around me, each one of them losing pounds in
phlegm as they plow through their Kleenex
boxes.
Hmm, the girl next to me looks kind of cute.
I adjust my collar, glance over and, for one beau
tiful moment suspended in time, our eyes meet.
I smile. She smiles. Our hearts flutter, beat as
one. Hospital muzak tinkles in the background.
She smiles again. I smile again. She sniffs and
wipes her nose with the back of her hand.
Extending the same hand, she leans over and
whispers, "Hi, my name's Chelsea. Can you
keep a secret? I really enjoy bodily fluids."
Before I have time to look for the hidden
camera, my name is called. "Hi, can you keep a
secretion?" I ask, hand her my most recent
Kleenex, and walk quickly away, hoping her
fetish is satisfied.
And after three hours of pokes, prods, jabs,
queries, questions, shakes and coughs in Cow
ell, I emerge from the building, confident that I
will get better. I clutch the little white packet of
red cure-all pills firmly in hand, take a whiff of
the warm December air, and smile.
Who needs tinsel? Who needs dreidels? Who
needs George Bailey, Heat-Miser or "Rudolph's
Shiny New Year" to tell them what season it is?
I'VE GOT A VIRUS and my head feels like
about twelve Uncle Amies are jumping around

OH, BY THE WAY, it's December. Sur
prised? In this wonderschool of palm
lovers' trees and dust-covered skis, is
there any way at all that we can tell the holidays
are approaching? Not everyone, after all, can be
like "earthquake" Iben Browning, able to predict
the future from the sun, the moon and the "lost
pets" section of the classifieds. (No offense,
Iben, but maybe we should lay off "The Omen"
trilogy for a while, hmm?)
So what, then, is there at Stanford that tells
us the holidays are near? What clues are there
that will knock us into that seasonal spirit?
Well, it isn't the change in weather. Mainly
because there isn't one. Not a hint of rain, let
alone snow, greets us here, and California's
quintessential holiday weather song, "I'm
Dreaming of a Wet Christmas," just doesn't
have the same spirited effect. Besides, wet
dreams have no place in holiday celebrations.
And it's not the approach of finals, for the
same reason: nothing changes. Dead Week is as
grand a Stanford myth as Lake Lag. About the
only difference between it and any other week is
that upperclassmen, listening to the primal
screams, can play "Name that Freshman
Dorm."
It may be Food, Folks and Fun — not
McDonald's, but Thanksgiving dinner — that
gets us into seasonal spirits. But then again:
Every family, it seems, has one completely
random relative that they would otherwise
never admit knowing, let alone being related to,
but every year feels obligated to unchain, dust
off, and bring out of the closet for Thanksgiving
dinner. And every year brings a new disaster.
You know the type: He's usually like My
Dear Friend Chester's Uncle Arnie: loud,
swinging single, pushing 40, whatever hair he
has left combed up and back in a slick Jon
Lovitz wave, sitting behind a plate of food that
would dwarf Marge Simpson's hairdo, talking
about his latest get-rich-quick plan. The rest of
the family smiles sickly and stares uncomfort
ably into their yams, hoping they won't be too
embarrassed, but there's no escaping the fact
that some time over the weekend he's going to
turn the channel off of "Miracle on 34th Street"
because he has an important bet placed on
"American Gladiators."
Well. It isn't the increase in shopping, as the
generic Stanford freshman agonizes for days
before deciding what to get each member of the
family. Tfell me, kiddies, if this list looks famil
iar:
Little sister — Stanford sweatshirt (M);
Mom — Stanford sweatshirt (L);
Big brother — Stanford sweatshirt (XL);
Dad — Stanford sweatshirt (XXXL);
Uncle Arnie — "The American Gladiators
Story" commemorative souvenir booklet, com
plete with full-color "Lace" pull-out.
Finally, it probably isn't any rise in religious
atmosphere. Call me a stark raving mad

lunatic, but Midnight Mass loses just a little
spiritual sanctity when it's held in the same
place that "The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, and
Her Lover" is scheduled for later that day.
No, despite the funky alliteration, mixing
Midnight Mass and the MemAud mentality
was probably a bad idea. Not that the audience
alternated cheering and hissing each Saint's
name as it was spoken, but I did have to resist a
crazy urge to crumple up my program and
throw it at the Brannerite across the aisle.
And the approach of Chanukah doesn't help
much either — after all, it's only a Menorahty
celebration.
Which leaves only one other alternative,
only one possible indication that the holidays
are upon us, unless I missed something (which
is entirely possible — this is the "Chris-miss"
season): fust in time for non-stop joyous cele
brations, immense feasts and an all-around
rocking month of festive goodwill, everybody
and her great grandmother gets sick.
My personal cold finally arrived last week,
just in the nick of time for Santa's approach —
shall we say, just in the time of Nick. ("Hey,
Chris, what's that I see approaching in the dis
tance, about a mile away now? Oh, must be
your joke . . ..")
I woke up feeling funny. Nothing unusual, I
thought. I'm a humor columnist. I'm supposed
to feel funny. But when I stopped sneezing long
enough to look in the mirror, I knew something
was wrong. No, I wasn't Ingrid Nava. Worse.
Overnight, it looked as if my face had slid about
an inch down from the rest of my head.
Bummer, man.
My eyes drooped, my nose sagged with the
weight of built-up mucous, and my mouth
formed a grimace that would make Leona
Helmsley look like a dolly in comparison.
I slipped on some sweats, popped a few
Advils, mussed up my hair for complete effect,
and headed off to class, hoping to sleep it off. No
luck. But as I rode back by Meyer, glancing at
the message on the vandalized Thinker, a bril
liant thought struck me: "Why didn't I go to
Cowell?"
Time Out for Tangent: Actually, the
statue's question, "Why didn't I go to Cal?" may
be a legitimate thought, if one ignores relative
crime rates, football scores and the city's 20-
year time lag in fashion statements. . .. How
bad is Berkeley culture? Imagine a mutant
strain of Lambda Nu running rampant through
the streets of Palo Alto, and you'll get the idea.
Back to the point: Stanford has over 12,000
thinkers on and around campus. Maybe it's
time to give Cal one of their own.
I enter Cowell Student Health Center and
walk up to the receptionist. "Hello, I have a
killer cold and my face also slipped out of place
overnight."
"Hmm . . . The cold we can help. No
facelifts, however. Have you been having any

hallucinations?"
"Well, last night I had a dream that I woke up
as Joel Stein."
"Any lasting effects? Infatuation with Fisher-
Price toys . . . outbursts of long hair . . . sudden
cravings for soft-serve ice cream?"
"Not that I can tell. But I was also wondering
if you took sperm donations here."
I fill out all the forms, take a number, steal
some tissues, and have a seat in the waiting
room. A stack of Time magazines sits on a
table. I pick one up and flip through it. Great. I
had been wondering what had happened last
August. These issues were so old my barber
shop wouldn't take them.
I look around at the five or six other patients
around me, each one of them losing pounds in
phlegm as they plow through their Kleenex
boxes.
Hmm, the girl next to me looks kind of cute.
I adjust my collar, glance over and, for one beau

I smile. She smiles. Our hearts flutter, beat as
one. Hospital muzak tinkles in the background.
She smiles again. I smile again. She sniffs and
wipes her nose with the back of her hand.
Extending the same hand, she leans over and
whispers, "Hi, my name's Chelsea. Can you
keep a secret? I really enjoy bodily fluids."
Before I have time to look for the hidden
camera, my name is called. "Hi, can you keep a
secretion?" I ask, hand her my most recent
Kleenex, and walk quickly away, hoping her
fetish is satisfied.
And after three hours of pokes, prods, jabs,
queries, questions, shakes and coughs in Cow

I slipped on some sweats, popped a few
Advils, mussed up my hair for complete effect,
and headed off to class, hoping to sleep it off. No
luck. But as I rode back by Meyer, glancing at
the message on the vandalized Thinker, a bril
liant thought struck me: "Why didn't I go to
Cowell?"
Time Out for Tangent: Actually, the
statue's question, "Why didn't I go to Cal?" may
be a legitimate thought, if one ignores relative
crime rates, football scores and the city's 20-
year time lag in fashion statements. . .. How
bad is Berkeley culture? Imagine a mutant
strain of Lambda Nu running rampant through
the streets of Palo Alto, and you'll get the idea.
Back to the point: Stanford has over 12,000
thinkers on and around campus. Maybe it's
time to give Cal one of their own.
I enter Cowell Student Health Center and
walk up to the receptionist. "Hello, I have a
killer cold and my face also slipped out of place
overnight."
"Hmm . . . The cold we can help. No
facelifts, however. Have you been having any

hallucinations?"
"Well, last night I had a dream that I woke up
as Joel Stein."
"Any lasting effects? Infatuation with Fisher-
Price toys . . . outbursts of long hair . . . sudden
cravings for soft-serve ice cream?"
"Not that I can tell. But I was also wondering
if you took sperm donations here."
I fill out all the forms, take a number, steal
some tissues, and have a seat in the waiting
room. A stack of Time magazines sits on a
table. I pick one up and flip through it. Great. I
had been wondering what had happened last
August. These issues were so old my barber
shop wouldn't take them.
I look around at the five or six other patients
around me, each one of them losing pounds in
phlegm as they plow through their Kleenex
boxes.
Hmm, the girl next to me looks kind of cute.
I adjust my collar, glance over and, for one beau
tiful moment suspended in time, our eyes meet.
I smile. She smiles. Our hearts flutter, beat as
one. Hospital muzak tinkles in the background.
She smiles again. I smile again. She sniffs and
wipes her nose with the back of her hand.
Extending the same hand, she leans over and
whispers, "Hi, my name's Chelsea. Can you
keep a secret? I really enjoy bodily fluids."
Before I have time to look for the hidden
camera, my name is called. "Hi, can you keep a
secretion?" I ask, hand her my most recent
Kleenex, and walk quickly away, hoping her
fetish is satisfied.
And after three hours of pokes, prods, jabs,
queries, questions, shakes and coughs in Cow
ell, I emerge from the building, confident that I
will get better. I clutch the little white packet of
red cure-all pills firmly in hand, take a whiff of
the warm December air, and smile.
Who needs tinsel? Who needs dreidels? Who
needs George Bailey, Heat-Miser or "Rudolph's
Shiny New Year" to tell them what season it is?
I'VE GOT A VIRUS and my head feels like
about twelve Uncle Amies are jumping around
inside it, and dagnabbit, that's all I'll ever need
to remind me of the holidays.
I walk back home and puke with a feeling of
absolute peace and goodwill toward all
humankind, knowing that Chelsea would have
appreciated the beautiful moment.

Chris Harris clearly has a "sick" sense of
humor.
