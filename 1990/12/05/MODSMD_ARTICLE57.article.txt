Father M.C.
Father's Day
Grade: fl+
Father M.C. isn't the best rapper in the world,
nor is he the best R&B crooner. Without the voice
of Chuck D or Luther Vandross, Father M.C.
comes up with a style right in between — laying his
smooth raps over an often intoxicating background
chorus of voices and rhythm.
The first two singles off the New York rapper's
debut album are perfect examples of Father's
rhythm-and-rap. "I'll Do For You" and "Treat
Them Like They Want to Be Treated" make astute
use of catchy backing choruses to make otherwise
lackluster songs sizzle.
"I've Been Watching You" plays off the same
style with a clever back-and-forth duet between
Father M.C. and Lady Kazan.
Lyrically, Father M.C. sticks to love songs but
avoids much of the macho of other rappers. In a
hip-hop world full of Ice T's and 2 Live Crew's,
Father M.C. could be called the "nice guy" of rap.
As he explains in "I'll Do For You," "I don't know,
it's the way that I am/ Introduce me to your moth
er, and I'll say 'Hello ma'am.'"
Producers Mark Rooney and Mark Morales
probably deserve some credit for helping Father
M.C. carve his own niche, but the rapper born
Timothy Brown isn't all a product of the studio. He
won the USA Roller Rink rap competition in 1985,
and worked his way around to land an MCA record
ing contract.
While the music doesn't always match the
power of the first two singles, Father M.C. comes
up with enough hooks to keep people singing and
danctng. And don't hate him just because he's a
nice guy.
