The Collections
Grade: -A+
Okay, so you think Sinatra is
corny.
He is. But there is one thing that
is undeniable. Virtually every
major musician, including Miles
Davis, Elvis Costello, Elvis Presley,
George Harrison and Louis Arm
strong, has called him the best
vocalist of the century. As Jim
Morrison once said, "No one can
touch him."
In honor of Sinatra's 75th birth
day this year, Capitol Records and
Reprise have, separately, released
special compilations of nis record
ings during the years he was with
them. The Capitol compilation
covers the 19505, Reprise's handles
the years 1961 to 1984. If you buy
• the Reprise collection, you will
own virtually every important
recording Sinatra made during a 23
year period.
The collection is entrancing,
mesmerizing, from the downbeat
of "Let's Fall In Love" to the last
note of "Mack the Knife," 81 songs
and four CDs later. Sinatra brings a
timelessness to his material, his
vocals somehow transcending
notions of musical style or genre.
Yet to be a fan of his is to be
frustrated by undeniable contradic
tions. For all the respect he
receives, he is so out of it that he
doesn't seem to know the good

musicians among his fans from
the bad. Over the years he could
have had his choice of collabora
tors - Miles Davis or Lou Reed
come to mind as interesting possi
bilities - but he chose New Kids on
The Block. (They're currently
working on an album together, if
you hadn't heard.)
And his propensity for "uncool
ness" is longstanding; for example,
a concert tour with Pia Zadora and
Don Rickles. And by keeping com
pany with Dean Martin, a half-rate
singer from the booze set, he sug
gests that he is in the same league
as Martin, or probably more accu
rately, he mistakenly thinks that
Martin is in the same league as
himself.
Sinatra truly seems not to know
any better This is the same thing
that has always frustrated me
about McCartney. Why didn't he
work with some great musicians
after the Beatles broke up? Many
were available, and plenty others
would have made the time: Jimmy
Page, Pete Tbwnshend, Jeff Beck; or
more recently, why not Phil
Collins?
The answer to this is the answer
in Sinatra's case: he just must not
know any better. Yet, if you can for
get what you know about the man,
the music is truly amazing. He
glides effortlessly from note to
note, sliding like a trombone,
growling like a saxophone. And
what sets him off from everyone

As Jim Morrison once
said, 'No one can
touch him.'

else, all the serious musicians will
tell you, is his phrasing. He can
play with rhythm like no one else,
holding back, skillfully teasing
your sense of where the beat
should be.
Among the songs included here
are a healthy sampling from his
Vegas years and Sinatra at his most
sentimental. But this is some of his
best work: "It Was A Very Good
Year," "My Way," "Strangers in the
Night" and "Somethin' Stupid," a
duet with his daughter Nancy,
which reached #1 in 1967.
Some of the Sinatra-isms are
annoying. In "Something," he
sings on the refrain, "You're asking
me will my love grow/I don't know,
I don't know/You stick around,
Jack, it may show. ..For years he
introduced George Harrison's
"Something" as "one of the greatest
love songs ever written .. . written
by a couple of songwriters named
Lennon and McCartney." But the
song works and he brings some
thing fresh to it and to everything
he records. Having heard his ver
sion, one can never listen to the
Beatles' version quite the same.
