Grade: C
Stephen Frears' "The Grifters"
is a nasty, ugly and crass film that
goes out of its way to make its
audience squirm. Based on Jim
Thompson's novel, it tells the
story of three con artists who
make up a bizarre romantic trian
gle; a mother, a son and the
woman who comes between
them.
John Cusack plays a young
drifter who earns his living by rip
ping people off for small bills. In
tow is his girlfriend (Annette Ben
ing), who doesn't hesitate to wrig
gle out of her spandex minidress
when financial opportunity
knocks. Oddly neither one of the
two has any idea that the other is
a master con artist. It is no sur
prise that one of the film's major
plot twists is that they will even
tually attempt to deceive each
other.
Rounding out this enigmatic
trio is Cusack's mother, played by
Anjelica Huston in a platinum
blonde wig. The love she shares
with her son is slightly more
romantic than a simple case of
common blood.
These characters are hardly
likable, but at least they re
unusually intriguing. Huston's
new wave Mama struts across
the screen, a post-modern, pistol

packing dominatrix with a lethal
temper She has several lines of
snazzy dialogue, but the strength
of her performance lies in her
body language.
As a middle-aged woman who
seduces her son, she makes the
process utterly convincing (the
film's most clever idea is making
her virtually indistinguishabie
from character, which
provides for a mistaken-identity
twist).
The incestuous undertones of
Huston and Cusack's relation
ship, however, exi9t only for
shock value. The darkly comic
potential for this twisted affair is
rarely tapped. Rather, characters
are subjected to various forms of
sadistic torture; one woman is
Sunched in the stomach, only to
ave the butt of a cigar extin
guished in her palm. Another
character's head is blown to bits.
Later, a jugular vein is slashed by
a broken glass.
The elegance and reserve that
director Frears showed with
"Dangerous Liaisons" is replaced
by a disturbing nastiness. Like
"Prizzi's Honor," "The Grifters"
tries to show the power money
has over love. But the exaggerated
mean streak that permeates
nearly every scene is not funny —
it's crass.
