# IFC votes to make Rush dry
## 
### Peter Robison Staff writer 
The Interfraternity Council
voted overwhelmingly Monday to
require all campus fraternities to
hold an alcohol-free Rush spring
quarter, a move that IFC presi
dent Erik Jorgensen described as
a "m«gor policy change."
Stanford's Greek system was
one of the only systems nation
wide that still allowed alcohol to
be served at Rush functions,
according to Jorgensen, a senior.
The vote was 11-2, with Phi
Kappa Psi abstaining. Kappa
Alpha and Beta Theta Pi voted
against the measure.
Jorgensen said the switch to a
dry Rush is intended to "send a
strong message" to the University
that the IFC is committed to "self
regulation."
"It's a good step for us," Jor
gensen said. "We're showing the
University that we're taking mat
ters into our own hands, rather
than waiting until they step in. We
wanted to assure them early on."
Stanford's new alcohol policy
played a large role in the IFC's
decision, he added.
"This is in line with Stanford's
new alcohol policy," Jorgensen
said. "The wet Rush hasn't been
abused in the past, but we decided
to end it» particularly because of
the new policy."
Michael Ramsey-Perez, pro
gram and fraternal affairs adviser,
said he supports the change. "I
think it's a good idea," he
explained. "If you look at the rules
of the national fraternities, the
law and University policy, it
makes sense.
"Rush is a function where the
primary audience is freshmen and
sophomores, people under the
drinking age," Ramsey-Perez said.
"It's hard to justify serving alco
hol at those functions."
The dry Rush will not be detri
mental to the Greek system, Jor
gensen said. He noted that four

fraternities — Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, Phi Delta Theta, Sigma
Chi and Delta Tau Delta — have
"had dry Rush in the past and
have had no problem fulfilling
their quota of members."
Sigma Chi president Wesley
Ehlers, a junior, agreed. "It won't
change the way Rush operates,"
he said. "SAE has had a dry Rush
for years, and it hasn't affected

their program."
"I think it's a huge positive,"
said IFC Rush Chair Joe Riley, a
senior. "It's easier to really get to
know people with alcohol out of
the way. And it sends a message to
people who try to stereotype fra
ternity members as big drinkers."
Riley said a dry Rush will
"force houses to be more creative

with the entertainment they pro
vide during Rush. It will make
Rush bigger and better."
"It made sense," Jorgensen
said. "Rush is a time when frater
nities are really under the micro
scope. We're going to let people
know that we don't need alcohol
to have a successful fraternity sys
tem."
