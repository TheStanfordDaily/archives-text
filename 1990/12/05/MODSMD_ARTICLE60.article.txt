Robot Jox
Nobody worth mentioning
Grade: See explanation below
My friend — let's call him The Fat One —
has a system for rating bad movies.
Instead of giving them stars, as real critics
do, he gives them boxes of Sno Caps.* The
worse a movie is, the more boxes of Sno
Caps it gets, from one to four.
"Robot Jox" is a three-box movie. (I said
four boxes, but The Fat One said there's only
been one of those, "Plan 9 from Outer
Space," and I haven't seen it so I couldn't
argue. Well, The Fat One should know. He's
the expert.)
But judge for yourself.
It's 50 years after the nuclear holocaust.
War has been outlawed. (Does anyone see a
logistical problem with this?) All territorial
disputes are settled in Siberia by men who
strap themselves into huge (we're talking
really big here) TVansformer-like robots and
beat and stomp each other to death.
Actually, they're not supposed to kill each
other. There are rules to these "games," as
they are called. But, well, you know, you put
on a hundred-story high, weapon-laden
monster suit and you lose control of your
self. Happens to all of us sometimes.
These are the "Robot Jox."
We enter as Alexander, of the Confedera
tion (say that with an air of disdain, please),
is killing one of the American fighters. How
cruel! How unjust! How can all these people
be surprised? He's done this nine out of nine
times!
Anyway, since the rest of the American
team is dead, it's now time to use the best
fighter in the country — Achilles. (Ooooh! A

bit of literary reference! Is this supposed to
fool us into thinking the writers of this
garbage have educational backgrounds?)
And we get to see the very intensely dra
matic build-up to the fight. Excuse me, that
should be THE FIGHT.
There are also some minor plots (as com
pared to the major plot I just described)
about genetically engineered fighters and
duty to one's country and duty to one's self
and duty in general. Oh yeah, and equal
rights for women.
And glasnost. No kidding.
By now, you probably think that I abso
lutely HATED this film and would not rec
ommend it if my mother were in it.
(Hmmm. Now there's an idea. My mother
in a robot suit.)
WRONG.
This is one of the funniest movies I've
seen in a long time. Of course, it wasn't sup
posed to be funny. The people who made this
film ACTUALLY THOUGHT THEY HAD
A GOOD IDEA!! No joke!
It was hysterical! Every time I thought,
"Oh no. Don't tell me he's going to !" He
filled in the blank! Every single time!
So go see this movie. I'd say wait until it
comes out on tape, but somehow I don't
think it's going to be mass-produced. And it
cannot, should not be missed.
As The Fat One said, "This will set the
tone for the '905."

* When asked why Sno Caps were used, The
Fat One replied, "No one really knows. His
torical reasons." He reluctantly admitted,
however, that Milk Duds would work just as
well.
