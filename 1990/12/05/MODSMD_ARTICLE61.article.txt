CINEMASCOPE

Dances with Wolves
Kevin Costner. Mary McDonnell
Costner plays an American lieutenant who becomes part
of a Sioux village; McDonnell Is the Indian woman he marries.
Sound simple? Well, yes and no. The plot Isn't too difficult to
follow, but It's full of symbols and meaning. And the visuals
are stunning.
Jacob's Ladder
Danny Alello, Tim Robblns
Tim Robblns plays Jacob Singer, a Vietnam veteran who is
living the sedate life of a U.S. Postal employee until he starts
to be pursued by strange demons. Drunk? Crazy? Just flat out
possessed? We 11... no. I'll give you a hint: perhaps Singer was
the unwilling pari.clpant In unethical Army experiments.
Reversal of Fortune
Glenn Close. Jeremy Irons, Ron Sliver
Surpassing the expectations of many, "Reversal of
Fortune" Is not a two-hour version of "A Current Affair."
Rather. It Is a look at Sunny Von Bulow's deteriorating life of
drugs and alcohol, and the fatal Injection that put it all to an
end. Was It suicide, or did philandering husband Claus hold
the needle? You decide.
