# Reiner's first try at horror doesn't deliver
## 
### 
Misery
James Caan, Kathy Bates
Grade: B
No one can accuse director Rob Reiner of not
being versatile.
During his eight years as a director, Reiner
has hopped from one film genre to another with
practiced ease, trying his hand at everything
from scathing satire ("This is Spinal Tap") to
bittersweet fairy tales ("The Princess Bride").
In his latest effort, a screen adaptation of
Stephen King's popular novel "Misery"
(Reiner's also directed "Stand by Me," based on
a King novella called "The Body"), Reiner dives
head-first into the cinematic world of thrillers
and, surprisingly, comes up short: ultimately,
"Misery" delivers more laughs than it does
chills and thrills.
It's not that "Misery" is a bad movie: techni
cally, it's quite well-executed. It's just that the
film lacks a certain, well, charge, that unbear
able build-up of tension that makes your stom
ach flip every time something moves on-screen.
The screenplay, penned by writer William
Goldman (Oscar-winner for "Butch Cassidy
and the Sundance Kid"), remains, on the whole,
faithful to the novel, although gore-minded
King aficionados will be disappointed to note
that the book's self-indulgent violence has been
carefully toned-down.
James Caan plays Paul Sheldon, the author
of an immensely successful series of romance
novels whose title character, Misery Chastain,
has become a pulp-literature legend. Sheldon

Reiner's primary failure in 'Misery' is his Inability to sustain a
prolonged feeling of suspense. Throughout the film he falls to
fully capitalize on potentially dramatic scenes.

has recently killed Misery off in a soon-to-be
published final installment in the series.
After he completes his first non-Misery
novel in a hotel in Colorado, Sheldon starts to
drive home when he is suddenly caught in a
blizzard. Sheldon's car runs off the road and
overturns, crushing his legs beneath the frame.
Miraculously, he is saved by Annie Wilkes
(Kathy Bates), a registered nurse who lives on an
isolated mountain farm. Annie shyly admits
that she is his "number-one fan", and promises
to nurture the bed-ridden author back to health.
Much to Sheldon's chagrin, however, Annie
turns out to be a psychopath, and her angelic
bedside manner quickly degenerates into a dan
gerously unstable demonic fury when she
learns that Sheldon has murdered her beloved
Misery in his latest book.
The remainder of the film documents Shel
don's desperate attempts to escape from
Annie's clutches.
Reiner's primary failure in "Misery" is his
inability to sustain a prolonged feeling of sus
pense. Throughout the film he fails to fully cap
italize on potentially dramatic scenes. Similarly,

the story's climax fizzles somewhat, leaving the
viewer thirsting for more.
On the other hand, Reiner produces some
extremely humorous moments from Sheldon
and Annie's dangerous game of cat-and-mouse
— the film is wrought with darkly comedic
scenes. Indeed, the film's wry sense of humor
ultimately overshadows its rather limp
attempts at generating suspense.
In addition, the acting is excellent. Caan
does a fine job in his role as Sheldon, but it is
Bates who ultimately steals the show with her
fiendishly demented portrayal of Annie. Her
dramatic range is tremendous: one moment she
is all smiles and sweetness, motherly clucking
over Sheldon and his injuries. Then, before you
can say/'Heeeere's Johnny", she flies into an
insane, sledge-hammer wielding rage.
Of the 17 film and television adaptations of
his stories, King reportedly referred to Reiner's
version of "Misery" as his favorite. And while it
is true that "Misery" is a decent thriller that
remains well above the standards of most Hol
lywood blood-orgies, the film is simply not up
to Reiner's usualstandards of excellence.
