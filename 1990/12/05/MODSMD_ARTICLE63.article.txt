# Chez T.J.: French with flair
## 
### Marni Rager 
Chez T.J. is, without a doubt, one of
the nicest restaurants in the area. It offers
classic sophistication in the food it serves
and the environment it serves it in.
Established only eight years ago, Chez
T.J. has become one of the most well
known French restaurants in the country.
A quiet establishment, it is run by the
owners, chef T.J. McCombie and maitre
d' George Aviet. By themselves, the two
maintain the excellence their patrons
have come to expect.
The secret to Chez T.J. is the care the
owners take not only with the food, but
also with those who dine there. The two
— yes, two — waiters are pleasant and
Aviet knows most of the crowd by name.
Of course, the food is a crowd-pleaser
as well. Three changing "prix fix 6" din
ners of four, five and eight courses are
served. The food is French, but is obvi
ously influenced by health-conscious Cal
ifornians. Lean meat and light sauces are
used to keep customers happy.
And happy I was.
lb begin with, I ordered a cream of car
rot soup with sorrel chiffonade. This was
Suite light and made for a nice prelude to
le salmon, which was served with toma
toes and rock salt. It was quite tasty, but

do not order it if you dislike salt.
Between courses, port wine and pear
sorbet in a champagne float is served to
cleanse the palate. It also makes a nice
contrast to the dishes that follow.
For me, this was chicken, lean and
thinly sliced. It was delicious! Tbpped
with polenta, surrounded by sun-dried
tomatoes and resting in a fantastic white
wine cream sauce (all of the sauces I
tasted at Chez T.J. were fantastic), this
dish was truly the high point of my meal.
Salad is served last, which is tradi
tional for the French, and is a choice
between a few selected imported cheeses,
or mixed green lettuce picked from Chez
T.J.'s private garden. And the desserts, of
course, are homemade.
Chez T.J. is serious about its reputa
tion and it shows. This restaurant is for
special occasions — so make note of it for
the time you are serious about impressing
someone. But be sure to make a reserva
tion well in advance.
You won't be sorry.

right off of El Camino, in Mountain View.
