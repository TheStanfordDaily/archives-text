# Boy Wonder's return doesn't match hype

So this is Robin.
After all the hype, the enormous
publicity posters and the secretive
planning, DC Comics released the
first issue of the "Robin" mini
series to an industry breathless
with anticipation. Even a cursory
glance, however, could tell that the
final product is little more than a
marketing scam.
The storyline focuses on Tim
Drake, the third youngster to don
the suit of Robin, Batman's faithful
sidekick. The five-issue series
marks the first adventure of Drake,
who even sports a brand new cos
tume, black Kevlar cape and all.
(Ever wonder why the Dark Knight
had a partner whose costume was
brighter than a Christmas tree?)
Unfortunately, the costume is
the book's most interesting facet.
As expected, Robin has to learn
ancient fighting disciplines by
studying abroad and learning from
a strict old sage. As expected, his
first encounter with a girl brings
trouble and a good fight. And as
expected, Robin's do-gooder heart
plunges him into his first all-out
battle, an apparent no-win situa
tion that ends with the cliffhanger
"lb be continued." Yawn.

problem compounded by the clut
tered layouts. And without his
mask, Drake looks like a ten-year
old rather than a vibrant, athletic
teenager:
But the most annoying part of
"Robin" lies outside the pages of
the book itself. In an effort to fur
ther fan hysteria, DC printed lim
ited amounts of the first issue,
which were shortly, if not immedi
ately, followed by a "second print
ing" edition. This tactic appreci
ated the value of the first issue
instantly, as fans flocked to stores
to buy an "original."
Sure, first printings get a free
Neal Adams poster inside, as well
as the satisfaction of owning a
"valuable" comic. But DC's ploy
took all the fun out of collecting
comics, concentrating on artificial
demand rather than genuine qual
ity.
Instead of paying bundles of
extra money for a shoddy, disap
pointing product, one should pick
up other books which consistently
contain excellent artwork and
intriguing stories. "Robin" may
have value, but it lacks the quality
as well as the fun.
