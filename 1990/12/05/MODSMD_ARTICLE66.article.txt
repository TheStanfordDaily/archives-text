# Palo Alto Theatreworks' 'Into the Woods' goes out on a limb
## 
### Anita Schneider Staff writer 
Working with large casts is Theatre Works'
director Robert Kelley's forte.
So directing Stephen Sondheim's hit musical
"Into the Woods" is like a dream come true. Kel
ley pulls out all the stops for this large-scale
musical and does it in a way that would make
Sondheim himself proud.
The concurring tales of Jack and the
Beanstalk, Little Red Riding Hood, Rapunzel
and Cinderella are masterfully staged, and the
imaginative settings by Michael Puff add the
dimension and sense of foreboding that are cru
cial to this fairy-tale musical.
Sondheim's score and James Lapine's book
both won Tbnies in 1988, and their songs and
text meld beautifully. They've taken familiar
fairy tales, added a few dramatic plot reversals,
and created a story with a lesson.
Which is simply this: we all must make dif
ficult choices on the paths we encounter on our
trek "into the woods" — but we're never alone
in making those choices.
The story begins when The Baker and his
wife (played by Jack Davis and Christine
McHugh, respectively) find they're unable to
have a child because a witch has put a curse on
them. They beg the witch — who is named,
appropriately, The Witch — for mercy.
And she is happy to oblige, if they will first
find her "the cow as white as milk, the cape as
red as blood, the hair as yellow as corn, the slip

per as pure as gold."
However, also involved in the musical are
many other characters immersed in many other
different, but related pursuits. All of the inter
twining tales make for many humorous inci
dents.
One of the most amusing moments is when
Cinderella's Prince and Rapunzel's Prince, hav
ing already won brides, seek the love of Sleeping
Beauty and Snow White.
Actors Russ Grieve and Richard Kelley as the
Princes are perfect blends of vanity and pom
posity as they each attempt to outdo the other's
infatuation in the song "Agonv." The lyrics
underline the message that we often want what
is out of reach, just as Cinderella and Rapunzel
are to the Princes.
Another character that will elicit laughs is
Little Red Riding Hood (played to the hilt by
Liana Young, a dynamic, tough and highly artic
ulate young performer).
In Sondheim's version of the famous story,
Little Red (as she is called) is saved by The
Baker (who is still pursuing the items for The
Witch) from the wolf's clutches. She wanders
through the woods and eventually strikes up a
friendship with Jack (of the Beanstalk), por
trayed with great sensitivity by Robert Hich
born.
Young and Hichborn have a style very suit
able for musical theater, and above all they're
able to project. They each grasp one quality in
their characters — Little Red's independence
and Jack's naivete — and carry it through so

that their actions are clear. Brian Keith Russel as
the Wolf is also fun, and outrageously bold.
Perhaps the most crucial character in the
entire show is The Witch, played by Simone
Cox. Unfortunately, her part is also quite mud
dled.
In the early scenes, she wears hideous make
up, and it's obvious she's the antagonist. But
when The Baker delivers to her the four items
she's requested, and the spell is broken, she
becomes beautiful. From that point on it's diffi
cult to understand her and her motives.
for example, in the song "Lament," The
Witch sings of her daughter, Rapunzel: "Chil
dren can only grow from something you love to
something you lose."
lb hear The Witch suddenly expressing her
self from the heart is uncharacteristic. And as
Cox herself seems unsure of her emotions, the
scene becomes very confusing — you have no
idea what to feel for her.
"Into the Woods" is sprinkled with ideas not
automatically associated with fairy tales. Of
course, the visual effects — the Wolf, the Giant
and the Witch's magic — will capture a child's
imagination (though the show is not recom
mended for children under nine), but adults can
find satisfaction in the play's deeper messages.

"Into the Woods" is playing in Palo Alto until
Dec. 29 at the Lucie Stern Theater on 1305
Middlefield Road.

Stephen Sondheim's "Into the Woods," being presented by Palo
Alto's Theatreworks through December 29.
Working with large casts is Theatre Works'
director Robert Kelley's forte.
So directing Stephen Sondheim's hit musical
"Into the Woods" is like a dream come true. Kel
ley pulls out all the stops for this large-scale
musical and does it in a way that would make
Sondheim himself proud.
The concurring tales of Jack and the
Beanstalk, Little Red Riding Hood, Rapunzel
and Cinderella are masterfully staged, and the
imaginative settings by Michael Puff add the
dimension and sense of foreboding that are cru
cial to this fairy-tale musical.
Sondheim's score and James Lapine's book
both won Tbnies in 1988, and their songs and
text meld beautifully. They've taken familiar
fairy tales, added a few dramatic plot reversals,
and created a story with a lesson.
Which is simply this: we all must make dif
ficult choices on the paths we encounter on our
trek "into the woods" — but we're never alone
in making those choices.
The story begins when The Baker and his
wife (played by Jack Davis and Christine
McHugh, respectively) find they're unable to
have a child because a witch has put a curse on
them. They beg the witch — who is named,
appropriately, The Witch — for mercy.
And she is happy to oblige, if they will first
find her "the cow as white as milk, the cape as
red as blood, the hair as yellow as corn, the slip

per as pure as gold."
However, also involved in the musical are
many other characters immersed in many other
different, but related pursuits. All of the inter
twining tales make for many humorous inci
dents.
One of the most amusing moments is when
Cinderella's Prince and Rapunzel's Prince, hav
ing already won brides, seek the love of Sleeping
Beauty and Snow White.
Actors Russ Grieve and Richard Kelley as the
Princes are perfect blends of vanity and pom
posity as they each attempt to outdo the other's
infatuation in the song "Agonv." The lyrics
underline the message that we often want what
is out of reach, just as Cinderella and Rapunzel
are to the Princes.
Another character that will elicit laughs is
Little Red Riding Hood (played to the hilt by
Liana Young, a dynamic, tough and highly artic
ulate young performer).
In Sondheim's version of the famous story,
Little Red (as she is called) is saved by The
Baker (who is still pursuing the items for The
Witch) from the wolf's clutches. She wanders
through the woods and eventually strikes up a
friendship with Jack (of the Beanstalk), por
trayed with great sensitivity by Robert Hich
born.
Young and Hichborn have a style very suit
able for musical theater, and above all they're
able to project. They each grasp one quality in
their characters — Little Red's independence
and Jack's naivete — and carry it through so

that their actions are clear. Brian Keith Russel as
the Wolf is also fun, and outrageously bold.
Perhaps the most crucial character in the
entire show is The Witch, played by Simone
Cox. Unfortunately, her part is also quite mud
dled.
In the early scenes, she wears hideous make
up, and it's obvious she's the antagonist. But
when The Baker delivers to her the four items
she's requested, and the spell is broken, she
becomes beautiful. From that point on it's diffi
cult to understand her and her motives.
for example, in the song "Lament," The
Witch sings of her daughter, Rapunzel: "Chil
dren can only grow from something you love to
something you lose."
lb hear The Witch suddenly expressing her
self from the heart is uncharacteristic. And as
Cox herself seems unsure of her emotions, the
scene becomes very confusing — you have no
idea what to feel for her.
"Into the Woods" is sprinkled with ideas not
automatically associated with fairy tales. Of
course, the visual effects — the Wolf, the Giant
and the Witch's magic — will capture a child's
imagination (though the show is not recom
mended for children under nine), but adults can
find satisfaction in the play's deeper messages.

"Into the Woods" is playing in Palo Alto until
Dec. 29 at the Lucie Stern Theater on 1305
Middlefield Road.
