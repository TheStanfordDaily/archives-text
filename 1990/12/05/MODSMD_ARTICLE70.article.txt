# Cutups Penn and Teller relive the gory days of theatrical magic

### Mara Winokur Editorial staff 
He is six-and-a-half feet tall, weighs
235 pounds and is one mean son-of-a
gun. Not just kind of mean, really mean.
He can — and will — cut you down in the
blink of an eye. Before you know what
happened. Before you can say, "Abra
c&dabra."
No, he's not Rocky or Rambo or even
Arnold Schwarzenegger's latest adver
sary. He's Penn Jillette, one-half of the
magic/comedy team Penn & Tfcller. And
no one is safe from his wrath.
No one.
Not his parents, not the audience and
definitely not other magicians. Not even
his poor partner Tfcller.
Especially not his poor partner Tfcller.
For those of you who have managed to
miss the last four years of David Letter
man, Penn & Tfcller is the funniest team
of magicians to hit the stage. Ever.
But that doesn't quite cover it. Perhaps
this will help.
The curtain rises to reveal two people
seated cross-legged on a platform the
height and width of a queen-size bed.
They are completely covered by a blan
ket, except for their hands, which are
sticking out of four holes in the front.
They perform a basic "Now you see it,
now you don't, oh wait a minute, there it
is again" magic trick with a handkerchief.

Simple. You see it all the time. Big Deal.
Then, suddenly, a refrigerator falls on
top of them.
And that is the beginning of Penn &
Teller's Refrigerator Tbur.
You see, Penn & Tfcller are more than
magicians. They're really, REALLY
weird, bizarre, zany, sick and twisted
magicians. Nothing is too sacred to
attack. Nothing is too deranged to per
form.
If you're looking for a show to take the
kids to, this isn't it. The falling refrigera
tor is one of the simpler, shorter tricks in
Penn & Teller's repertoire. From this eye
catching opener, Penn & Tfcller go on to
read people's minds, make audience
members levitate and kill an immortal
duck.
All right, so it doesn't sound too com
plex or exciting on paper, but in perfor
mance it is both. For Penn & Tfcller do not
just put on a show, they live it. Every
trick lasts for at least 20 minutes and has
a story to go with it. And that's where
things get really interesting. And funny.
And strange.
Take, for example, Penn & Teller's ver
sion of one of Houdini's famous escape
tricks.
Penn explains, very simply, how Hou
dini performed because he doubted the
"seers" and psychics" of his day. After
selecting two members of the audience,

Penn goes on to let us know what he is
going to do — escape from a box that is
tighdy sealed.
And then he takes off his clothes.
Well, not all of his clothes. Well, at
least not while we can still see him. Any
way, that's Penn for you.
Penn does all the story telling. (Which
is why Tfcller gets abused.) Tfcller does not
talk on stage or on television. He does,
however, talk in real life. Or so Penn said.
Yet they both do the tricks, and are defi
nitely a team.
Tnough sometimes, you can't help
but wonder.
Like when Tfcller stabs Penn with a
knife. Or when Penn lambastes Tfcller
with a string of insults. Or when Tfcller
handcuffs himself to Penn, and won't let
him move.
Strange? Yes. Tasteless? No. The
Refrigerator Tbur is not, though it may
sound that way. Instead, it is remarkably
clever. And sarcastic. And weird.
It makes you wonder how they
thought of some of their material. But as
Penn says, "You wouldn't want to know."
Probably not. But you would want to
see it.

Penn &) Teller are performing at the
Warfield in San Francisco until Dec. 18.
