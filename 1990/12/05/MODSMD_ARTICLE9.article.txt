# Eastern Europeans learn about capitalism
## 
### Jason Bloomstein Senior staff writer 
After helping shift American
politics to the right during the
Reagan Administration, the
Hoover Institution is attempting
to spread its influence to a new
target: Eastern Europe.
Twelve Polish and Hungarian
diplomats jetted off to New York
on their way home Saturday,
having completed a Hoover
sponsored one-quarter intensive
training program in American
capitalism and international pol
icy.
With the recent dismantling
of communist regimes across
Eastern Europe, many newly
installed governments are seek
ing training for new government
leaders who will facilitate a move
toward democracy and a free
market economy.
When Polish Deputy Foreign
Minister Jerzy Makarczyk told
then-Secretary of State George
Shultz last February about

Poland's need for Western
trained free marketeers, Shultz
suggested that Makarczyk send
his promising civil servants to
Stanford.
Hoover rarely acts in a teach
ing capacity, and it was the first
time Eastern European diplo
mats had come to the Institution
for training, according to Hoover
director John Raisian. As a
result, the number of partici
pants was limited to 12 — eight
Poles and four Hungarians, all
university-educated, govern
ment ministry personnel. The
focus was on young, potential
leaders: the oldest was 29, the
youngest 23.
The diplomats attended two
seminars at Hoover, one in eco
nomics led by Hoover senior fel
low Charles McClure and one in
international relations led by
senior research fellow Charles
Hill and History Prof. Norman
Naimark. They also audited
other courses, mainly in eco
nomics, in the School of Human

ities and Sciences.
In addition, the diplomats
were instructed on how to foster
and deal with certain peculiari
ties of an open society, such as a
free press.
"We learned not to get angry
at the media," said Wojciech
Iwanczyk, an officer in the Pol
ish foreign ministry, at a press
conference Friday. M We also
learned many other things, such
as environmental issues and
how to finance new enterprises."
"The last three months have
had a definite impact on my
life," said Julia Kircsi, a member
of the Hungarian Minister's
Cabinet who has a master's
degree in international relations
from Budapest University of
Economics. "Everyone in former
communist countries wants
democracy and a free market.
Hoover has been a good opportu
nity," she added in strikingly
clear English.
When asked if they felt the
instruction they received from

Hoover was decidedly biased
toward conservatism, many said
no and others championed con
servative politics as necessary to
relieve Eastern Europe of its
troubles.
Forty years of failed left-wing
politics under communist rule
naturally require the infusion of
conservative thinking, Iwanczyk
argued. "The new mood is to the
right and that is the right atti
tude," he said.
Raisian added that dozens of
Stanford faculty were involved
in the diplomats' education,
including History Prof. Gordon
Craig, who said he did not see
any signs of imbalance in the
views exposed to the Poles and
Hungarians.
Raisian said that he hopes
the program will be continued
next year. The Czechoslovakian
government has also expressed
interest in participating, he said.
The diplomats also found
time to explore various Califor
nia attractions.
