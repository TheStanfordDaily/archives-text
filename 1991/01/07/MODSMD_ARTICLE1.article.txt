# Stanford's indirect cost rate knocked down 2 points
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
The war that haa erupted over Stan
ford's indirect cost policies has yet to be
won, but the University suffered a $2.5
million casualty over winter break.
Stanford and the Navy agreed Dec. 20
to an interim indirect cost rate of 72 per
cent for this fiscal year. That figure is two
points lower than the provisional rate
imposed on Stanford in the fall when the
Navy began its investigation of the Uni
versity's indirect cost policies. Each per
centage-point drop costs the University
about $1.26 million in expected revenue.
Indirect costs are those costs that are
not easily attributable to a specific
research project, such as electricity, main-

tenance and administra
tive overhead. Stanford
had originally proposed
an indirect cost rate of 78
percent for this year;
that would mean that for
every dollar researchers
receive in federal grants,
the government reim
burses Stanford an addi
tional 78 cents for indi-

rect costs of the research.
In addition to the Office of Naval
Research, two other federal agencies —
the House Subcommittee on Oversight
and Investigations, and the General
Accounting Office — are investigating
Stanford's indirect cost policies. The
investigations were prompted by con

cerns raised by Paul Biddle, the campus
representative of the naval office. The
naval office is the agency that negotiates
indirect cost rates on behalf of the federal
government.
Biddle has alleged that prior to his
arrival in October 1988, Stanford and the
Navy enjoyed a far too "cozy" relation
ship, allowing the University to collect
millions of dollars in indirect cost recov
ery over the past decade to which it was
not entitled.
Stanford has repeatedly denied Bid
die's allegations.
On Dec. 13, Adm. William Miller, the
Chief of Naval Research, appointed a five
person panel from the Navy, including
Biddle, to address the concerns Biddle has
raised. After meeting with Stanford

administrators for four days, the Navy
panel and Stanford agreed to an interim
rate of 72 percent.
But many battles remain.
The parties will meet again Feb. 15 to
review the 72 percent interim rate. After
that point, they will try to close the books
on fiscal years 1981 through 1986, which
remain open largely due to a backlog in
government auditing.
Furthermore, the Navy panel and
Stanford have yet to address the issue
that could prove most costly to Stanford:
the legal status of dozens of "memoranda
of understanding" between Stanford and
the government. Biddle has said these
agreements are not legally binding and
should not be honored because they are
too generous to Stanford.

Many of the agreements allow Stan
ford to recover more in indirect costs than
would be allowable under the methodol
ogy outlined by the government rules.
The government allows universities to
claim more than would be allowable if the
University can justify the reasons for the
additional costs.
Biddle has estimated that during the
last decade Stanford overbilled the gov
ernment by more than $200 million for
indirect costs. A large percentage of that
figure is tied to the status of the memo
randa of understanding between Stan
ford and the Navy.
The University has obtained a legal
opinion from a San Francisco law firm


Biddlt
backing its position on the valid
ity of the agreements. Stanford
has also agreed to provide a list of
the agreements for review by the
Navy. The two parties hope to
complete this review by April 1.
In related developments:
• During finals week last
quarter, both the San Jose Mer
cury News and the Los Angeles
Times reported that Stanford had
billed the government $3,000 for
a cedar-lined chest, $2,500 to
refurbish a grand piano and up to
$2,000 a month for flower
arrangements at the Lou Henry
Hoover House, the residence of

University President Donald
Kennedy — all as indirect costs of
research.
The revelations, leaked by the
staff of the House Subcommittee
on Oversight and Investigations,
followed revelations a week ear
lier that Stanford had inadver
tently billed the government for
depreciation on the Sailing Pro
gram's 72-foot yacht Victoria.
But while claiming the depreci
ation on the yacht as an indirect
cost of research was clearly a vio
lation of government rules, the
same cannot be said about the
chest, piano and flowers in
Hoover House.
These items "are not specifi
cally unallowable," a staff mem
ber of the Dingell subcommittee
acknowledged last week.

In addition to
being the resi
dence of the Uni
versity president,
Hoover House is
also the site of
several research
related confer
ences and brief
ings. Therefore,
Stanford claims a

fraction — about one-fifth — of
Hoover House's operating costs
as an indirect cost of research.
Sources close to the investiga
tions said that regardless of
whether or not such charges are
legally allowable, they have little
to do with research and are there
fore of questionable validity.
• On Dec. 18, Kennedy
released a six-page statement in

'We have seen no evidence suggesting
wrongdoing by Stanford personnel or
improper relationships between them
and government employees.'

an effort to clarify several issues
related to the indirect cost contro
versy.
While Kennedy acknowledged
that some errors were inevitable
in an accounting system as com
plicated as Stanford's, he
defended the University's behav
ior during the past decade.
"We have seen no evidence sug
gesting wrongdoing by Stanford
personnel or improper relation
ships between them and govern

ment employees," Kennedy
wrote. "We believe that virtually
all transactions will be found to
have been treated in accord with
applicable federal rules, and
under clearly made and under
stood agreements with the gov
ernment."
Kennedy was also highly criti
cal of leaks made to the press by
congressional investigators. The
leaks have given a "distorted view
of the entire situation," Kennedy

wrote. "The old saying has never
been truer than it is in this case:
falsehood is half way 'round the
world while truth is still pulling
up its socks."
Due to agreements of confiden
tiality with the government,
Stanford has not been able to
"repair the damage" of some alle
gations, Kennedy said. "Stanford
is prepared, as always, to make a
full public accounting of its work
when all the facts are in,"he
wrote.

The war that haa erupted over Stan
ford's indirect cost policies has yet to be
won, but the University suffered a $2.5
million casualty over winter break.
Stanford and the Navy agreed Dec. 20
to an interim indirect cost rate of 72 per
cent for this fiscal year. That figure is two
points lower than the provisional rate
imposed on Stanford in the fall when the
Navy began its investigation of the Uni
versity's indirect cost policies. Each per
centage-point drop costs the University
about $1.26 million in expected revenue.
Indirect costs are those costs that are
not easily attributable to a specific
research project, such as electricity, main-

tenance and administra
tive overhead. Stanford
had originally proposed
an indirect cost rate of 78
percent for this year;
that would mean that for
every dollar researchers
receive in federal grants,
the government reim
burses Stanford an addi
tional 78 cents for indi-

rect costs of the research.
In addition to the Office of Naval
Research, two other federal agencies —
the House Subcommittee on Oversight
and Investigations, and the General
Accounting Office — are investigating
Stanford's indirect cost policies. The
investigations were prompted by con

cerns raised by Paul Biddle, the campus
representative of the naval office. The
naval office is the agency that negotiates
indirect cost rates on behalf of the federal
government.
Biddle has alleged that prior to his
arrival in October 1988, Stanford and the
Navy enjoyed a far too "cozy" relation
ship, allowing the University to collect
millions of dollars in indirect cost recov
ery over the past decade to which it was
not entitled.
Stanford has repeatedly denied Bid
die's allegations.
On Dec. 13, Adm. William Miller, the
Chief of Naval Research, appointed a five
person panel from the Navy, including
Biddle, to address the concerns Biddle has
raised. After meeting with Stanford

administrators for four days, the Navy
panel and Stanford agreed to an interim
rate of 72 percent.
But many battles remain.
The parties will meet again Feb. 15 to
review the 72 percent interim rate. After
that point, they will try to close the books
on fiscal years 1981 through 1986, which
remain open largely due to a backlog in
government auditing.
Furthermore, the Navy panel and
Stanford have yet to address the issue
that could prove most costly to Stanford:
the legal status of dozens of "memoranda
of understanding" between Stanford and
the government. Biddle has said these
agreements are not legally binding and
should not be honored because they are
too generous to Stanford.

Many of the agreements allow Stan
ford to recover more in indirect costs than
would be allowable under the methodol
ogy outlined by the government rules.
The government allows universities to
claim more than would be allowable if the
University can justify the reasons for the
additional costs.
Biddle has estimated that during the
last decade Stanford overbilled the gov
ernment by more than $200 million for
indirect costs. A large percentage of that
figure is tied to the status of the memo
randa of understanding between Stan
ford and the Navy.
The University has obtained a legal
opinion from a San Francisco law firm


Biddlt
backing its position on the valid
ity of the agreements. Stanford
has also agreed to provide a list of
the agreements for review by the
Navy. The two parties hope to
complete this review by April 1.
In related developments:
• During finals week last
quarter, both the San Jose Mer
cury News and the Los Angeles
Times reported that Stanford had
billed the government $3,000 for
a cedar-lined chest, $2,500 to
refurbish a grand piano and up to
$2,000 a month for flower
arrangements at the Lou Henry
Hoover House, the residence of

University President Donald
Kennedy — all as indirect costs of
research.
The revelations, leaked by the
staff of the House Subcommittee
on Oversight and Investigations,
followed revelations a week ear
lier that Stanford had inadver
tently billed the government for
depreciation on the Sailing Pro
gram's 72-foot yacht Victoria.
But while claiming the depreci
ation on the yacht as an indirect
cost of research was clearly a vio
lation of government rules, the
same cannot be said about the
chest, piano and flowers in
Hoover House.
These items "are not specifi
cally unallowable," a staff mem
ber of the Dingell subcommittee
acknowledged last week.

In addition to
being the resi
dence of the Uni
versity president,
Hoover House is
also the site of
several research
related confer
ences and brief
ings. Therefore,
