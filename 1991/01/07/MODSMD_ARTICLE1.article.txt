# Stanford's indirect cost rate knocked down 2 points
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
The war that haa erupted over Stan
ford's indirect cost policies has yet to be
won, but the University suffered a $2.5
million casualty over winter break.
Stanford and the Navy agreed Dec. 20
to an interim indirect cost rate of 72 per
cent for this fiscal year. That figure is two
points lower than the provisional rate
imposed on Stanford in the fall when the
Navy began its investigation of the Uni
versity's indirect cost policies. Each per
centage-point drop costs the University
about $1.26 million in expected revenue.
Indirect costs are those costs that are
not easily attributable to a specific
research project, such as electricity, main-

tenance and administra
tive overhead. Stanford
had originally proposed
an indirect cost rate of 78
percent for this year;
that would mean that for
every dollar researchers
receive in federal grants,
the government reim
burses Stanford an addi
tional 78 cents for indi-

rect costs of the research.
In addition to the Office of Naval
Research, two other federal agencies —
the House Subcommittee on Oversight
and Investigations, and the General
Accounting Office — are investigating
Stanford's indirect cost policies. The
investigations were prompted by con

cerns raised by Paul Biddle, the campus
representative of the naval office. The
naval office is the agency that negotiates
indirect cost rates on behalf of the federal
government.
Biddle has alleged that prior to his
arrival in October 1988, Stanford and the
Navy enjoyed a far too "cozy" relation
ship, allowing the University to collect
millions of dollars in indirect cost recov
ery over the past decade to which it was
not entitled.
Stanford has repeatedly denied Bid
die's allegations.
On Dec. 13, Adm. William Miller, the
Chief of Naval Research, appointed a five
person panel from the Navy, including
Biddle, to address the concerns Biddle has
raised. After meeting with Stanford

administrators for four days, the Navy
panel and Stanford agreed to an interim
rate of 72 percent.
But many battles remain.
The parties will meet again Feb. 15 to
review the 72 percent interim rate. After
that point, they will try to close the books
on fiscal years 1981 through 1986, which
remain open largely due to a backlog in
government auditing.
Furthermore, the Navy panel and
Stanford have yet to address the issue
that could prove most costly to Stanford:
the legal status of dozens of "memoranda
of understanding" between Stanford and
the government. Biddle has said these
agreements are not legally binding and
should not be honored because they are
too generous to Stanford.

Many of the agreements allow Stan
ford to recover more in indirect costs than
would be allowable under the methodol
ogy outlined by the government rules.
The government allows universities to
claim more than would be allowable if the
University can justify the reasons for the
additional costs.
Biddle has estimated that during the
last decade Stanford overbilled the gov
ernment by more than $200 million for
indirect costs. A large percentage of that
figure is tied to the status of the memo
randa of understanding between Stan
ford and the Navy.
The University has obtained a legal
opinion from a San Francisco law firm
