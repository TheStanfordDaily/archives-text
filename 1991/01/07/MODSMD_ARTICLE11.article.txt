Thatcher opposes
European union
LONDON (AP) — Former
Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher has agreed to become
the first president of a biparti
san group of British lawmakers
opposed to a federal Europe,
press reports said yesterday.
The organization is known
as the Bruges Group, after the
Belgian city where Thatcher, in
a speech on Sept. 20, 1988, ex
pressed her opposition to full
political union in Europe.
Thatcher's latest move could
be seen as a challenge to the
more conciliatory tone on Euro
pean economic and political
union taken by her successor,
Prime Minister John M^jor.
George Robertson, spokes
man on European affairs for
the opposition Labor Party,
said, "It shows that the divi
sions within the Tory party on
Europe will carry on. She will
remain to haunt Mayor."

Gabal Mansura, southwest Ko
rdofan, the news agency scud,
quoting an unidentified mili
tary source.

against the government of this
northeastern African country
in 1983 to demand greater re
forms for the mainly animist

Nunn stresses
agendas for 1992
WASHINGTON (AP) - If
you want to run for president,
you need to develop a domestic
agenda. So says Sen. Sam
Nunn, who is planning a series
of domestic policy forums
around the country in Febru
ary and March.
The most outspoken Demo
cratic critic of President Bush's
Persian Gulf policy insists he
has no plans to run for presi
dent in 1992.
But "if you were going to
run for president, you would
need to develop an agenda for
America," Nunn said. "The
problem with the Democratic
Party in the last two elections
is we haven't been credible
enough to force the party who
won to have an agenda."
To address the problem,
Nunn and the Democratic
Leadership Council he helped
establish will conduct forums
on such issues as economic pol
icy, health care and the deterio
ration of families.
