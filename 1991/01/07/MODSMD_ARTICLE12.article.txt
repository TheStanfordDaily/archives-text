MOMBASA, Kenya (AP) -
Evacuees from Somalia's capital
yesterday told of a city in smoke,
with large sections blasted and
burned in street battles between
rebel and government forces that
left "corpses decomposing every
where." <*<»■•'»*»
The rebels said they had
launched their final offensive to
end President Mohamed Siad
Barre's 21-year rule in the Horn
of Africa nation of 8 million. They
said more than 1,500 people have
died in eight days of fighting.
On Saturday, American and
Italian aircraft evacuated hun
dreds of foreigners, but the heavy
fighting prevented Italian cargo
planes from continuing the rescue
operation yesterday, Italian offi
cials said.
They said Italy would attempt
a sea rescue on Tuesday if its
planes could not land by then. The
United States said all Americans

have been evacuated.
Egyptian sources reported that
a Saudi airliner managed to land
yesterday in Mogadishu, the capi
tal, on a separate mission to res
cue Arabs trapped by the fighting.
Scores of foreign evacuees,
mostly women and children,
recounted the horror in Somalia's
capital. They arrived a day earlier
at this Indian Ocean port aboard
Italian cargo planes.
They said that large, primarily
residential areas in the north
western section of Mogadishu had
been turned to rubble.
"There are corpses decompos
ing everywhere in those areas,"
said one Swedish woman, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
"People just step aside and
nobody does anything."
The evacuees accused Siad
Barre's troops of looting and
killing civilians since the rebel
offensive intensified on Dec. 30.
