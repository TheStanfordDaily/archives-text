# Saddam says no deal without linkage
## 
### 
Saddam Hussein told Iraqis
yesterday to prepare for a long
war against the "tyranny repre
sented by the United States," and
he again ruled out an uncondi
tional withdrawal from Kuwait.
In a national television address
three days before the first direct
U.S.-Iraqi talks, Saddam again
linked any pullout to an Israeli
withdrawal from the occupied ter
ritories — a stand Washington has
repeatedly rejected.
In Washington, Secretary of
State James Baker repeated that
stand, saying the United States
"will not agree to anything that
would constitute linkage."
Saddam's TV address came
nine days before the Jan. 15 U.N.
deadline for Iraq to pull out of
Kuwait or face possible attack.
Martial music preceded his
speech, which marked the 70th
anniversary of the founding of the
Iraqi army.
Dressed in his customary olive
green military fatigues and dark
beret, Saddam opened the 25-
minute address with a verse from
the Koran, Islam's holy book,
which said that war is moral when
the cause is just.
Saddam praised his soldiers for
"the return of Kuwait to its Iraqi
motherland," where it would
remain "for the present and
future times."
"The battle against the
tyranny represented by the
United States and the slogans of
hegemony it is raising ... is not
expected to be a short one," Sad
dam said in calm, measured tones.
The message was apparently
aimed at building morale in a
nation suffering increasingly from
a global U.N. trade embargo.
"A battle of such scope
requires great sacrifices both in
quantity and quality, irrespective

of the foreseen and unforeseen
consequences which will no doubt
please the friend and anger the
enemy."
In his speech, Saddam also
boasted that his army now has the
strength "to accomplish all its
goals and take on the enemy.
"It is indeed a source of great
pride to accomplish more than one
goal in a single showdown," said
Saddam, linking his struggle to
the liberation of the Israeli-occu
pied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Meanwhile, Baker left Wash
ington later yesterday for London,
ahead of his scheduled talks
Wednesday with Iraqi Foreign
Minister Tariq Aziz in Geneva. If
that meeting fails, he said, "I am
closing the door" to further talks.
The foreign ministers of Saudi
Arabia, Egypt and Syria backed
the U.S. stand, calling the Baker-
Aziz meeting the last chance to
resolve the 5-month-old gulf crisis
peacefully. The ministers met yes
terday in Saudi Arabia.
In other developments yester
day, 42 German, Belgian and Ital
ian air force jets flew to Turkey to
help defend its frontier with Iraq
if war breaks out. They made up a
NATO air team requested by
Turkey, whose border with Iraq is
a possible second front in a Per
sian Gulf war.
In the meantime, Iran and the
European Community made new
efforts to try to avert a gulf war.
Iran urged the 46-nation Organi
zation of the Islamic Conference
to consider a peace initiative, and
the EC repeated an invitation to
Aziz to meet for talks.
"Things could change in the
coming days," French Foreign
Ministry spokesman Daniel
Bernard said in explaining tne
new in'ritation.

nicknamed the building the "Baghdad Hard Rock Cafe."



King Fahd of Saudi Arabia (above) faces reporters grimly yesterday,
no doubt haunted by the prospect of having to don a gas mask like
a worker (left) with Aramco, the Saudi government-run oil company.
The workers were given free masks yesterday.
