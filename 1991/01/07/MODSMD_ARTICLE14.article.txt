# U.S. seeks justice to Salvadoran rebels' alleged slaying of airmen

COMALAPA, El Salvador (AP) - The
U.S. ambassador demanded yesterday
justice in the alleged rebel execution of
two U.S. airmen last week. The leftist
insurgents promised to investigate the
slayings.
In Washington, Secretary of State
James Baker said he would respond by
asking Congress to end restrictions on
military aid to the right-wing Salvadoran
government.
El Salvador's top Roman Catholic offi
cial said a church inquiry lends support
to U.S. claims that two of three U.S. sol
diers were shot and killed after their heli
copter was downed by rebels Wednesday.
"Those who committed this act, who
murdered our colleagues, perpetrated a

war crime," U.S. Ambassador William
Walker said, denouncing the rebels of the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation
Front.
The group has fought successive U.S.-
backed governments for 11 years. About
72,000 people, most of them civilians,
have died in the war.
"We are determined to see those
responsible for the deaths of these Amer
icans brought to justice," Walker said.
He spoke during a memorial ceremony
at Comalapa airport, 35 miles south of
the capital of San Salvador.
Later, a U.S. Air Force C-130 transport
plane took off for the United States car
rying the bodies of Lt. Col. David Pickett,
Chief Warrant Officer Daniel Scott and

Pvt. Ist Class Earnest Dawson.
U.S. officials said Saturday that pre
liminary autopsies indicated that only
Scott had died in the crash itself. They
said Pickett and Dawson were shot with
at least three different weapons as they
lay injured at the crash site.
"What kind of animals would execute
injured, helpless and non-threatening
persons in their power, and do so in cold
blood?" Walker asked.
President Alfredo Cristiani, who
attended the memorial service, also
promised to try those involved in the
deaths.
"We will do everything possible so that
those guilty of this infamous murder
receive punishment ... according to the

law, Cristiani said.
It was unclear how the government
would arrest the rebels who allegedly exe
cuted the two soldiers.
The rebels' clandestine Radio
Farabundo Marti dropped earlier denials
of the execution yesterday and promised
"an exhaustive investigation" of the inci
dent.
The radio said the rebel group has "a

clear policy of assuming responsibility for
each one of its acts, and we will proceed in
that manner in this new situation."
Rebel officials first claimed that all
three soldiers had died when the heli
copter crashed. They later said all had
died of crash injuries shortly after the
helicopter went down.
In the United States, Baker told ABC
TV that the men "were murdered by the
FMLN, at least two of them for sure,"
and he called the action "outrageous."
Congress last year froze $42.5 million
in aid to El Salvador because of human
rights complaints. The main allegation
was that the military was trying to block
an investigation into the murder of six
prominent Jesuit priests.
