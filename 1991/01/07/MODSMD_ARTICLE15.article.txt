SACRAMENTO (AP) - Pete
Wilson marked his second day of
inaugural celebrations yesterday
with a Hollywood-style gala, a
community reception and an ecu
menical church service disrupted
briefly by pro-life protests.
The Republican governor-elect,
who formally takes the oath of
office as California's 36th gover
nor this morning, and his wife
Gayle were joined by about 1,100
supporters, two choirs and 15 reli-
S'ous leaders of a dozen different
iths at an ecumenical service at
a Catholic church 1 1/2 blocks
from the state Capitol.
The church service was fol
lowed by an afternoon community
reception at the California State
Railroad Museum, where the
Wilsons arrived on an antique
steam engine.
About 60 scripture-quoting
pro-life protestors and another
dozen demonstrators for the

homeless picketed outside the
ecumenical service, and eight pro
life demonstrators were arrested
inside the church.
Wilson didn't publicly acknowl
edge the protest against his pro
choice stance, but Bishop Francis
Quinn of the host Cathedral of the
Blessed Sacrament referred to the
brief disruption in the introduc
tory rites.
"The church is not a museum
for saints, but a hospital for those
who hurt and also for those who
protest," Quinn told the congre
gation. "Prayer is crucial, not just
a mindless exercise to get out of
the way before getting down to
the serious business of govern
ment."
While Wilson didn't come in
direct contact with the protestors,
Quinn did meet with them outside
the church to chants of "Judas,"
"murderers" and "baby butch
ers."
