# New York City is in fiscal crisis

NEW YORK (AP) — Firehouses close, traffic
crawls and thousands of municipal workers wait for
pink slips as the brutal arithmetic of fiscal crisis
begins to shrink the nation's largest municipal gov
ernment.
In the past three weeks, slumping local tax rev
enues have led budget forecasters to double their
estimate of the city's current budget gap to $500 mil
lion. That deficit, roughly equal to the annual budget
of Cincinnati, is out of a total 1990-91 city budget of
$28 billion. And it prompted the city's budget direc
tor, Philip Michael, to speak the two dreaded words.
"It is not a mischaracterization to say this is a fis
cal crisis," said Michael, who told New Yorkers to
expect "larger service reductions than have ever
been seen before."
That sent a shudder through those who lived
through the city's brush with bankruptcy in the mid
19705, when streets went uncleaned and bridges
were not maintained.
Although Michael insisted the city could cope with
the crisis, events last week indicated it would be
painful.
The Fire Department closed three firehouses,
despite community protests, to save $3 million a
year.
