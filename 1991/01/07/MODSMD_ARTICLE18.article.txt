## Resolutions for 1991 
### 
The community needs
to set new goals for a
promising new year

A T THE START OF YET
/\ another year, it seems alto-
JL JLgether appropriate for the
Stanford community to make some
New Year's resolutions for itself.
Maintaining long-range perspec
tive is often difficult when con
fronted with the daily challenges of
university life — be they financial
challenges facing the University's
officers or academic challenges fac
ing its students.
What follows are some sug
gested goals for the community to
pursue in 1991. Some of these res
olutions apply only to a few admin
istrators, and some are directed
solely at students — but many
apply to all of us.
• Preserve academic programs to
the greatest extent possible in the
next round of budget cuts. With
indirect-cost investigations, a
deepening recession, a "reposition
ing" process and earthquake
repairs all confronting the Univer
sity, more painful cuts are sure to
come soon. Academic programs
should be among the last to be Sac
rificed; if such an action becomes
necessary, students should play a
part in determining what cuts are
made.
• Make remaining layoff deci
sions in as fair, equitable and com
passionate a manner as possible.
It's important that the reposition
ing process live up to its name and
result in a truly streamlined
University — and not simply
deplete the ranks of the Univer
sity's lower-paid workers.
• Create a constructive debate
on the current Persian Gulf crisis.
• Preserve intellectual freedom

and honest discussion, whatever
the issue. It's time to recognize and
counteract the effects of "political
correctness" that are appearing in
the news more and more.
• Move forward with the devel
opment of the new distribution
requirements. There's little time
and less money to take on this
effort, but the faculty has commit
ted to doing it. It would be disap
pointing for the efforts of many
people thus far to be wasted
because of a lack of organization or
resources.
• Finish Kimball Hall on time
and continue construction on sub
sequent phases of that project.
• Continue the effort to recruit
and hire minority faculty.
• Enforce the University's new
alcohol policy wisely, keeping in
mind the respect for individual
decision-making that has charac
terized the University's position on
this issue in recent years.
• Give issues of sexual harass
ment, sexual assault and sexual
abuse the attention they deserve.
Implement the recommendations
of the Task Force on Sexual
Assault, due out soon.
• Shape an ASSU election sea
son unhampered by the political
bickering of last spring by getting
the rules straight beforehand. And
also — reform the confusing and
inadequate ASSU Bylaws.
• Cut back on water University
wide. California is entering its fifth
year of drought with no let-up in
sight.
• Continue to foster closer rela
tions between the University and
the Hoover Institution.
• Fill the large pothole that now
wreaks havoc on the tires of cars
traveling southbound on Palm
Drive.
• Win national championships in
men's and women's basketball,
and send the football team to the
Rose Bowl next New Year's Day.
