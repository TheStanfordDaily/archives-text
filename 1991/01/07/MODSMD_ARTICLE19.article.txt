America should support its friends in the Gulf

I HAVE A NEIGHBOR WHO is a big
bully. One day, he forces his way into
my home, beats me up, helps himself
to my property and then abducts me.
I manage to call the police, but they
cannot agree among themselves on what
to do to rescue me, except to call on every
one not to do any business with my neigh
bor until he releases me.
Meanwhile, my abductor is dismem
bering me piece by piece, and I am in
great agony. I do not think I can survive
until he gets tired of being ignored by
everybody.
I have a friend who is a body builder, a
really tough guy. I call on him for help.
However, he only responds by doing exer
cises in front of my abductor's house,
hoping to impress him into releasing me.
In the meantime, he has second
thoughts about rescuing me. He wonders
if it is worth getting himself hurt for. He
rationalizes that I wasn't such a nice fel
low after all. And he tells himself that
since I am related to my neighbor, it is
really a family affair that he has no right
to intervene in.
My name is Kuwait. The friend I
thought I had is named America.
This political allegory sums up how I
see the Persian Gulf situation. Of course,
no one has the right to demand that his

friends risk getting hurt to help him. But
no one who does not take risks to help a
friend in trouble deserves the respect of
others.
The real issue in the debate over Amer
ica's involvement in the Persian Gulf con
cerns America's role in world affairs.
Is America willing to pay the price to
have an influence over events that hap
pen outside her boundaries? If America
cannot back up her friends when they are
in trouble, why should anyone care what
America thinks?
I believe an isolationist America is
inconsistent with the aims of those who
see America as a force for the protection
of human rights and the environment of
the world. For if no one cares abut Amer
ican public opinion, then groups such as
Greenpeace, Asiawatch, Africawatch, and
other such organizations based in the
United States will also lose their influ
ence in the rest of the world.
It is because other countries want
America for their friend that they care
about what Americans think of their gov
ernments and their policies. If America
wants to sit on the sidelines like the little
nations of the world, minding their own
business, so be it. But take note that
nobody pays much attention to what
those little countries think about what

other nations do.
I also find a Eurocentrism of the worst
kind in the attitude of the anti-war move
ment in the West. It seems that the only
war that matters to them is the Cold War
between the superpowers, and the only
disarmament that they care about is in
Europe. Since the end of World War 11,
only North America and Europe have
been in peace, while wars have continued
to ravage the rest of the world.
If Third World countries do not think
they can rely on the United Nations or
their friends to help protect them from
aggression, then logically they will have
to arm themselves to the teeth for their
own self-defense. The non-intervention of
the West in the face of naked aggression
such as Iraq's invasion of Kuwait is thus
a recipe for continuing and escalating the
arms race in the Third World, diverting
resources much needed for fighting
poverty, famine and disease.
Thus, the attitude of the isolationists
in the United States smacks of Eurocen
trism. "Let the savages out there slaugh
ter each other. Don't let us get involved or
we might get hurt!" Of course, that
ignores the fact that quite a number of
the conflicts out there have their roots in
the colonial past.
I am tired of the simplistic arguments

presented in favor of a U.S. withdrawal
from the Gulf. That American soldiers
may lose their lives is an argument
against any war. It could have been used
to argue against U.S. involvement in the
Second World War too. It obscures the
distinction between justified and unjusti
fied wars. For the first time in 40 years,
American troops can do some good in the
world. If not now, then never!
The only other argument presented is
just as silly. It is claimed that Kuwait was
not a democracy, so it doesn't deserve
.American help. Does anyone seriously
believe that Kuwaitis are better off under
Saddam Hussein than they were under
the Kuwaiti royal family? What better
chance is there for Americans to influence
the democratization of Kuwait than if
they have just liberated it?
My parents, who grew up in China dur
ing the Second World War, brought me up
to believe two things: that America
always does what is right, and that Amer
ica always helps those in need. I have long
given up the first belief which is naive and
false. Perhaps I should give up the second
as well.
Shame on you, America!

America thinks?
I believe an isolationist America is
inconsistent with the aims of those who
see America as a force for the protection
of human rights and the environment of
the world. For if no one cares abut Amer
ican public opinion, then groups such as
Greenpeace, Asiawatch, Africawatch, and
other such organizations based in the
United States will also lose their influ
ence in the rest of the world.
It is because other countries want
America for their friend that they care
about what Americans think of their gov
ernments and their policies. If America
wants to sit on the sidelines like the little
nations of the world, minding their own
business, so be it. But take note that
nobody pays much attention to what
those little countries think about what

other nations do.
I also find a Eurocentrism of the worst
kind in the attitude of the anti-war move
ment in the West. It seems that the only
war that matters to them is the Cold War
between the superpowers, and the only
disarmament that they care about is in
Europe. Since the end of World War 11,
only North America and Europe have
been in peace, while wars have continued
to ravage the rest of the world.
If Third World countries do not think
they can rely on the United Nations or
their friends to help protect them from
aggression, then logically they will have
to arm themselves to the teeth for their
own self-defense. The non-intervention of
the West in the face of naked aggression
such as Iraq's invasion of Kuwait is thus
a recipe for continuing and escalating the
arms race in the Third World, diverting
resources much needed for fighting
poverty, famine and disease.
Thus, the attitude of the isolationists
in the United States smacks of Eurocen
trism. "Let the savages out there slaugh
ter each other. Don't let us get involved or
we might get hurt!" Of course, that
ignores the fact that quite a number of
the conflicts out there have their roots in
the colonial past.
I am tired of the simplistic arguments

presented in favor of a U.S. withdrawal
from the Gulf. That American soldiers
may lose their lives is an argument
against any war. It could have been used
to argue against U.S. involvement in the
Second World War too. It obscures the
distinction between justified and unjusti
fied wars. For the first time in 40 years,
American troops can do some good in the
world. If not now, then never!
The only other argument presented is
just as silly. It is claimed that Kuwait was
not a democracy, so it doesn't deserve
.American help. Does anyone seriously
believe that Kuwaitis are better off under
Saddam Hussein than they were under
the Kuwaiti royal family? What better
chance is there for Americans to influence
the democratization of Kuwait than if
they have just liberated it?
My parents, who grew up in China dur
ing the Second World War, brought me up
to believe two things: that America
always does what is right, and that Amer
ica always helps those in need. I have long
given up the first belief which is naive and
false. Perhaps I should give up the second
as well.
Shame on you, America!
