# Deukmejian's papers find home at Hoover
## 
### Michael Friedly Editorial staff 
The Hoover Institution will be
the new home for many of Califor
nia Gov. George Deukmejian's
Sublic records, Hoover Director
ohn Raisian announced last
month.
Deukmejian's papers will join
former Gov. Ronald Reagan's
papers in the Institution.
Raisian cited two reasons why
Deukmejian chose Hoover for the
site of his gubernatorial papers.
First, the Institution already
houses Reagan's gubernatorial
documents. In addition, Deukme
jian donated past papers to
Hoover from when he was a state
assemblyman, state senator and
attorney general for California
from 1962 to 1983.
Hoover is also the home for the
papers of Sen. S.I. Hiyakawa and
Rep. Pete McCloskey, as well as an
extensive collection of papers
from Soviet and Eastern Euro
pean history.
"We gather a lot of national
papers," Raisian said, "although it
is not our principal focus." Hoover
specializes in international rela

tions in the 20th century.
Raisian said Hoover was inter
ested in the papers because "Cali
fornia is an important part of the
national picture, and it is our
home state." The papers "relate to
social changes, and that is the
principal focus of the institution,"
he said.
"I've talked to Deukmejian
informally two or three times"
about housing the papers at
Hoover, Raisian said. He said the
governor sent staff members on a
couple of occasions to see
Hoover's facilities.
Even so, "the decision came a
lot sooner than we expected,"
Raisian added.
A portion of Deukmejian's
gubernatorial papers will be kept
at the State Archives in Sacra
mento.
Raisian also said he had been in
contact with Governor-elect Pete
Wilson about connections
between Hoover and the new state
government. Wilson "has indi
cated that with the budget prob
lem that he will be facing . . . there
might be some expertise at
Hoover that can be used in some
advisory capacity," he said.
