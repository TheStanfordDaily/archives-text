# Med school students committed to perform community service
## 
### 
Stanford is one step ahead in educat
ing physicians for the 21st century.
Take a given day in the South Bay.
You can find medical students working at
a free health clinic which they started for
the homeless.

In East Palo Alto, medical students
offer AIDS prevention materials to high
risk persons, they teach it in the schools
and they offer counseling to those who
undergo testing. They work at a camp
for kids who have diabetes and are start
ing a "big-brother" program for those
with chronic illnesses.
These are only a select few programs;
Stanford medical students have devel
oped an extensive commitment to assist
ing the community.
The School of Medicine has taken an
active step in recognizing and

encouraging that commitment. Nov. 20
was the first meeting of the new Office of
Public Service Opportunities, created to
coordinate and promote medical student
projects.
Through the initiation of this office,
the school has affirmed the important
role of public service in the education of
Well-rounded, humanitarian physicians.
The work for this office has just begun;
many projects are yet to be uncovered
and organized and many more are in
need of funding.

The list of students, faculty and staff
involved in the development of this office
is extensive. A special note of praise goes
to Deans David Horn and Charlotte
Jacobs for their guidance and foresight.
The support which the Medical School
has given to public service in the curricu
lum sets a precedent and serves as a role
model for other medical schools across
the nation.
