## Vanishing movie magic 
### 
I'VE KNOWN SINCE ABOUT the
first or second grade that movies are
just "pretend." And, of course, as I
grew older I came to learn that movies are
filmed on sets and sound stages using
props and other such artifice.
I knew all this, but the knowledge
never stopped me from getting involved
in the plot of a movie or developing a
fondness for certain characters.
In fact, I have oftentimes found myself
either yelling at the villains for being
unspeakable, mean and heartless or try
ing to wipe the tears discreetly from my
eyes after a particularly touching scene.
My recent visit to Universal Studios,
however, has unfortunately spoiled the
magic of the cinema for me. The whole
time I was there, I felt like a complete
idiot for ever allowing a movie to elicit
any sort of emotion from me other than
contempt.
I was horrified to think that I had so
many times been fooled into forgetting
that a movie is anything more than actors
and actresses dressed up in costumes try
ing to convince the audience that they are
someone else.
I remembered how many times I had
put reality on the back burner during a
film, and I blushed from embarrassment.
I just couldn't believe that any of the
cheap wooden facades ever had any sem
blance of being real.
The fact that the tour guide kept clari
fying over and over again that a facade is
a "fake front" made me feel even more
like a fool. I couldn't help thinking that
maybe the reiteration of such a conde
scending definition was simply an indica

tor of the mental capacity of anyone who
falls for Hollywood gimmicks and ploys. I
didn't like where that left me.
Take for example Cabot Cove, Maine,
where "Murder, She Wrote" is supposedly
set. On the few occasions that I have
watched the show I've thought to myself
that maybe Maine would be a nice place to
live. It looks so cute and quaint in the
opening credits.
The real Cabot Cove is a 50-yard
stretch of faded wooden planks positioned
next to a small pond which conveniently
serves simultaneously as the coast of
Maine and the home of "Jaws."
Speaking of "Jaws," according to the
tour guide, the screams of a girl who got
ripped up by the giant shark were so real
istic because she was actually getting a
couple of her ribs broken. Apparently, the
people who were supposed to pull the
ropes to thrash her around in the water
got their signals crossed and pulled at the
same time, in opposite directions.
I couldn't believe that the studio would
actually brag about that on the tour.
Somebody got seriously injured and the
tour guide made it sound like a most
incredible feat of film technology.
My little tour of Universal Studios was
one magic-spoiling revelation after
another.
I discovered what movie snow is really
made of, and I didn't like what I found. It
sort of ruins the charm of films like "It's
a Wonderful Life" to know that the snow
was probably nothing more than shreds
of white plastic sheeting, or that the snow
on the foliage was dyed-on.
"The Hunt for Red October" was also

infinitely less intriguing when I consid
ered the fact that the underwater subma
rine shots were most likely filmed using a
child's plastic bath toy for the submarines
and the kitchen sink as the Atlantic
Ocean.
I also found out that in old westerns
the moviemakers would actually alter the
size of the doorways to make the men
seem bigger than they really were. Simi
larly, they would also make the doorways
bigger so that the women would seem
more petite and delicate.
And get this, the girl who got stabbed
in the shower in tlie movie "Psycho" let
out such a blood-curdling scream because
Alfred Hitchcock replaced the warm
water she was used to with cold water.
It's disconcerting to know that such a
big part of American entertainment is
built on gimmick and ruse. The film
industry has managed to con millions of
people, if only for a couple hours at a
time.
Universal Studios undoubtedly makes
oodles and oodles of money conducting
these tours around their facilities, but if
they were really smart they'd keep their
trade secrets to themselves, preserve the
mystique of the cinema, and just let peo
ple go on believing in movie magic.
