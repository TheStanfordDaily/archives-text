## Helen Tjioe Iraqi aggression best answered by compassion, non-violence 
### 
AN OPEN LETTER to President
Bush: We, ai concerned young citi
zens of America, wish to voice our
alarm at your foreboding decision to send
troope to the Persian Gulf. As rumors of
escalating tensions and imminent war cir
culate, we feel that our voices, and those
of other Americans, are not being heard.
Vie have watched, with great sadness,
the unfolding events of these past few
months — sadness not only for our fellow
youth in tanks, warplanes and gas masks,
whom we see, with ever-increasing clar
ity, being hovered over by the dark spectre
of Death, but also for the loss of that
divine auality, so crucial for the well
being of nations, for the well-being of
man: empathy.
We feel that aggression is best
answered not by an even more potent and
debilitating display of force, but rather, by
a show of compassion and non-violence.
What the world needs most in this
exciting era of rapid change and immense
possibilities is not the presence of the

United States as a global police officer,
but rather, as a global role model. Have
we not learned from the lessons of history
that the road of violence does not lead to
peace?
We, as future leaders of America, feel a
deep sense of responsibility for the
actions of our nation, and a strong sense
of commitment to the preservation of the
ideals upon which this nation was
founded.
For it is our generation that will have
to bear the full burden of war. It is young
Americans who will die in combat, and
Coung Americans who will inherit a war's
loody legacy.
We are frustrated by the lemming-like
lack of public debate over the direction
this nation is so hastily taking. Are we
truly willing to sacrifice thousands of
lives for oil? For the preservation of "the
American way of life" ?
• Why was Congress not consulted
before the decision to launch a military
blockade of Iraq was made? Does not our

enforcement of a blockade without con
gressional approval constitute a blatant
violation of our own Constitution? If so,
then is it not hypocritical of the United
States to be so quick to condemn Iraq for
transgressing international law?
• Are we in a position to punish Iraq
for its invasion of Kuwait when we our
selves invaded both Grenada and
Panama?
• What exactly would American youth
be dying for? For the emir of Kuwait? For
agreeable gas prices at the pump?
• Why does the United States now
show such indignation toward Iraq's
recent act of violence when it has turned
a blind eye to countless other similar acts
of violence?
• Why has the pitiful plight of the
thousands of displaced refugees not
received more than scant attention from
our governmental leaders and from the
press? Ought we not commit ourselves to
this grave human crisis of immense pro
portions with as much fervor as that with
which we have readied our vast military

colossus for battle?
• Is it morally conscionable for us to
wage this war with an all-volunteer army,
comprised largely of poor and underprivi
leged youths? Why should those who ben
efit least from our society be expected to
sacrifice the most for it? Ought not our
fighting force be broadly representative of
the entire American population in order
for it to maintain political and democratic
legitimacy?
• Are the citizens of America aware
that it has been the rich, industrialized
nations of the West that have been,
through their vast network of transna
tional oil companies, the primary
exploiters of Arab oil? How long will it be
before we trade equitably with our fellow
nations? Before we begin to show true
respect for the precious natural resources
of our planet, respect for the breathtak
ing yet startlingly fragile natural beau
ties of the world in which we live, respect
for our fellow human beings?
We, as a nation, must address these
questions, and others like them, before

any further decisions to escalate tensions
in the Middle East are made. Too much
has already been decided by too few. We
are a democracy, not a monarchy. Silence
can no longer be construed as approval.
We implore you, Mr. President, to rec
ognize the growing voice of dissent that
cries out from cities across the nation.
Give the American people answers to the
above questions, publicly and without
delay.
And, most importantly, allow the citi
zens of this world to carry within their
hearts a glimmer of hope for a world free
of hatred and animosity, a world in which
aggressors are shown the path toward the
Ideal, not punished for their transgres
sions, a world worthy of being called the
home of humanity.
Send our troops home.
