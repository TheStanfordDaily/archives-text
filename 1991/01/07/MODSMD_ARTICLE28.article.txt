## Stanford blows huge lead, drops to 0-2 in Pac-10 Behind by 17, Oregon storms back in second half on the way to OT win 
### Robert Pardington Senior staff writer 
EUGENE, ORE. — Stanford
led by as much as 17 points over
the Oregon Ducks but lost in
overtime 81-77 at a raucus
McArthur Court last night.
As they had against Oregon
State Thursday, the Cardinal
dominated the first half, shoot
ing 51.7 percent to Oregon's 33.3
and outrebounding the Ducks
19-14. And this time, Stanford
had something to show for it,
leading 33-23 at half.
But the Ducks rallied in the
second half, going on a 23-5 run
at one point. The crowd of 7,000
plus cheered wildly as the mo
mentum swung tremendously to
Oregon's favor.
Oregon's junior guard Terrell
Brandon, who had a game-high
33 points, hit a three-pointer to
pull the Ducks within two at
51-49. Then a three-point play
underneath by Richard Lucas,
who finished with 19 points and
16 rebounds, put Oregon up 52-
51.
The game see-sawed from
there but Stanford gradually
rebuilt its lead to 67-63 on the
strength of baskets by Kenny
Ammann and a slam dunk by
Deshon Wingate. But Lucas hit
a free throw with 35 seconds
remaining in regulation to cut
Stanford's lead to 67-64.
Stanford called time out, but
then Wingate could not inbound
the ball in five seconds and it
was Oregon's ball. Brandon at
tempted a three-pointer that
bounced back out to him and
his second shot went through
the net to tie the game at 67
with onlv 10 seconds to play.
The Cardinal inbounded the
ball at the opposite baseline but
Ammann lost it out of bounds
under full-court pressure by the
Ducks. Brandon missed an off
balance 25-footer as time ex
pired.
The teams exchanged buckets

in the overtime and a dunk by
Keefe made it 76-75, Oregon
ahead by one. Ammann fouled
the Ducks' starting off-guard
Kevin Mixon. Mixon, who had
been held scoreless all game, hit
both free throws to put Oregon
ahead by three with 20 seconds
to go.
Stanford hurried down court,
and Keefe was forced to take a
three-pointer with seven
seconds on the clock. He was
fouled while going up and was
awarded three foul snots.
Keefe missed the crucial first
free throw but hit the next two.
John Patrick was forced to foul
Brandon at the other end. Bran
don hit his first foul shot,
missed the second, but the re
bound was tipped by Mixon back
into his hanas. Ammann had to
foul again with two seconds left
and Brandon iced the game with
both free throws.
"It was really a great come
back by our kids," Oregon Coach
Don Monson said. "This was one
of the better ones."
"We had the game within our
hands, and we let it slip away,"
Wingate commented after the
game. "The effort was there and
to not get the win really hurts."
"I can't fault our effort,"
Stanford Coach Mike Mont
gomery said. "I just think we
made some key mistakes at key
times."
Stanford was using a new de
fensive formation, the triangle
and two, with the two defenders
up on top in an attempt to pres
sure Oregon's guards and con
tain any penetration by point
guard Brandon.
In the first half it was fairly
effective. Brandon had 14
points, but the whole Oregon
offensive scheme seemed to be
disrupted.
"In the first half we were
standing around," Monson said.
"We were somewhat confused


Al Green — Daily
Bounce, bounce.
Guard Kenny Ammann and his teammates will have to bounce back into form for the
rest of their schedule, as the team opened Pac-10 play with two disappointing losses
In Oregon.
