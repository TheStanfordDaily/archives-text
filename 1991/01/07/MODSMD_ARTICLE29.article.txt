CORVALLIS, ORE. â€” Oregon State center Teo
Aliegovic hit a short hook shot with 5:18 left to
put the Beavers ahead for good en route to a
73-66 win Thursday over Stanford in the Pacific
10 Conference opener for both schools.
The Cardinal dominated the main statistical
categories in the first half, outshooting OSU .524
to .394, and outrebounding the shorter Beavers
20 to 11. But Stanford led only 32-29 at halftime,
as Oregon State forced 10 turnovers by the Car
dinal. The Beavers used tough full-court pressure
from the start and gathered seven steals in the
first half.
"We were trying to wear them down," Oregon
State coach Jim Anderson said. "We wanted them
to make some errant passes and poor decisions."
To combat the press, Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery went with a three-guard line-up of
John Patrick, Marcus Lollie, and Kenny Hicks
along with big men Adam Keefe and Jim Morgan
for a stretch in the first half.
"They were going to a press-match zone and
you don't lose much defensively (with the three
guard line-up)," Montgomery said.
In the second half, Montgomery abandoned the
three-guard rotation in favor of the conventional
two guards, two forwards line-up in an effort to
provide some inside scoring.
Oregon State collapsed its perimeter defenders
to help out in the paint, and Stanford's shooting
suffered. The Cardinal could muster only 41.4
percent on field goals in the second half. Center
Adam Keefe, Stanford's go-to man, took only nine
shots on the game.
"Keefe is tough. I was very tired," Oregon
State's sophomore forward Chad Scott said,"But
we collapsed on him and boxed him out."
"We can't seem to get the ball down low very
well," Montgomery said. "And so the advantage
we usually nave isn't there."
The press was still on, but Stanford was beating
it across midcourt better in the second half. The
problem was not punching the ball inside for the
score.
"The press I don't think bothered us," Patrick
said. "But we have to gain something, we have
to make people pay for (putting on tne press)."
Meanwhile, Oregon State's Alibegovic and Will
Brantley were catching fire, and OSU shot 59.3
percent as a team in the second half. Alibegovic
nad a game-high 24 points,and Brantley added
20 of his own.
