# Summer protesters get probation, fines
## 
### Michael Friedly Editorial staff 
Five protesters who locked
themselves in Hoover Tower this
summer to protest University lay
offs were sentenced to fines and
probation after pleading no con
test to the charges last month.
Political Science Prof. John
Manley, United Stanford Workers
field representatives Linda
Crouse and Reuben Serna, USW
secretary Sammy Brooks and
Tresidder custodian Ray Hensen
were fined a total of $400, which
will cover the costs of the Stanford
Police Department for their ser
vices during the protest.
In addition, the Palo Alto
Municipal Court gave the
protesters five-day suspended jail
sentences and probation for the
rest of the 1990-91 school year.
The police arrested the five
after a Sept. 1 rally in which about
150 protesters gathered in White
Plaza and marched to Hoover
Tower. The five protesters then
locked themselves in the Herbert
Hoover Memorial Room by plac
ing handcuffs on the metal doors.
The protest was in response to
the decision of Tresidder manage
ment to contract custodial jobs to
an outside company, threatening
the jobs of the eight-person custo
dial crew.
The protesters originally
pleaded innocent to charges of
trespassing in October, but
changed their pleas to no contest
after negotiations with the Santa
Clara County District Attorney's
office.
"It wasn't a fair sentence,"
Brooks declared after it was
handed down.
"When we committed civil dis

obedience, we knew that we would
have a penalty, and we were pre
pared for that," according to
Crouse. But "we feel that the real
criminals are Stanford," she said.
Brooks defended the protest,
saying, "It was successful in mak
ing the community aware of the
problems of the layoffs."
"We normally don't do sit-ins,"
Brooks said. "We just wanted to
make it dramatic."
Crouse also said the protest
was successful. "It was something
we had to do. If we had gone qui
etly and simply let the crew be dis
mantled without any protests,
that in itself would have been a
defeat," she said.
Brooks said the USW would
step up its efforts in response to
the possibility of increased layoffs
as a result of an $8 million
University deficit this year, but he
declined to say what the USW
efforts would be.
"We're going to fight like hell to
make sure that the budget cuts
fall more fairly than they have
fallen so far," Crouse said. "We
will speak out. We will demon
strate. If we have to go to jail
again, we will."
Crouse said the five defen
dants considered asking the judge
to give them a sentence of commu
nity service on Stanford's 72-foot
yacht, the Victoria. Depreciation
on the yacht was accidentally
charged to the federal government
by the University as an indirect
cost on federally-sponsored
research.
Crouse said the five decided
against asking the judge for ser
vice on the yacht because "we
weren't sure he had a sense of
humor."
