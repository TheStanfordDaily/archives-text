# No. 8 cagers handle Oregon schools
## 
### David Hirning Senior staff writer 
Utilizing a pair of big lineups,
two big nights by forward Julie
Zeilstra, and tenacious rebound
ing by their big people, the Cardi
nal women's basketball team
posted a pair of decent-sized victo
ries at home over the Oregon
schools last week to open its
Pacific 10 Conference schedule.
While both final margins were
comfortable, No. 8-ranked Stan
ford did not display the type of
dominance it did against the same
schools last year, indicative both
of the Cardinal's changed person
nel and of the new talent at Ore
gon State and Oregon. Both
games were still up for grabs at
halftime.
This noted, the 99-81 win over
the Beavers and the 88-61 defeat
of the Ducks still gives Stanford a
fair head of steam going into this
Friday's showdown against con
ference nemesis Washington in
Seattle.
With the loss of two top scorers
to graduation and an injury to

another big gun in Trisha
Stevens, the 6-foot-3 Zeilstra has
had to step in and assume the
scoring duties for the Cardinal.
Going into Thursday's game
against Oregon State, the junior
led Stanford with a 17.3 points
per game average.
Apparently, Zeilstra was hold
ing something back. Dominating
offensively both inside and out,
the Vernal, Utah, native tore up
OSU for 27 points on 9-of-15
shooting, tying a career high. Two
nights later she set a new personal
best, pouring in 33 in only 26 min
utes of play, single-handedly
breaking open a close game with
Oregon.
"I gave her the green light to
shoot threes at will," Stanford
coach Tara VanDerveer said after
Zeilstra's offensive show. "I think
she sometimes passes up good
shots, but I don't think she did
that tonight."
Zeilstra's performance and
point guard Sonja Henning's 25
points were needed to hold off a
vastly improved Beaver team that
boasts nine new players. One new
comer is 6-4 center Natalia

Mattick, a West German who
gives OSU good size inside. Her 23
points and forward Judy Shan
non's 24 paced the Beaver attack.
"They're one of the most
improved teams in the Pac-10,"
VanDerveer said of the Beavers,
who lost for only the third time in
11 games. "They were well pre
pared for us."
After a woeful start to the sea
son, Stanford has improved its
rebounding, and it showed against
OSU. The Cardinal pulled down a
whopping 27 offensive rebounds
and outboarded its opponent 55-
34. This vindicated VanDerveer,
who felt that Stanford's rank of
10th in rebounding among Pac-10
teams was misleading because of
the Cardinal's difficult non-con
ference schedule.
"I know we can rebound," she
said.
Zeilstra led the way on the
boards as well, grabbing 13, while
Val Whiting continued to clean the
glass to transparency with 12
rebounds.
Rebounding was one of the rea
sons VanDerveer returned to her
"big lineup" against the Ducks.

The lineup, nicknamed the "Tri-
Towers," starts 6-3 players Zeil
stra, Trisha Stevens, and Val
Whiting in the frontcourt and 5-
10 Christy Hedgpeth with Sonja
Henning at guard. This lineup can
also help by contributing points at
the small forward spot.
VanDerveer used the lineup for
only the second time this season,
after the first attempt resulted in
a 15-point loss to Tennessee. "We
may have scrapped something
that was good at Tennessee with
out giving it enough time to
work."
Of the three towers, the small
forward is — you guessed it —
Zeilstra. Playing on the perimeter,
"Z" hit four of six three-pointers
and 12 of 16 from the floor over
all.
"Offensively, I'm pretty com
fortable [at the small forward],"
Zeilstra said. "It definitely opened
me up on the perimeter, and I
would be foolish not to take the
shots."
It was two such treys which
broke the backs of the Ducks, who
hung close to the Cardinal for
most of the first half and only
trailed by 11 at halftime. The first
increased the Stanford lead to 47-
33 to open the second half and
ignited the crowd, and the second
pushed the advantage to 17. Zeil
stra scored eight more points and
then left for good with more than
11 minutes to play. The game, for
all intents and purposes, was over.
Oregon coach Elwin Heiny
cited Stanford's defensive pres
sure as crucial to the Cardinal run
which built a 35-point lead at one
point. Heiny called Stanford the
toughest his team has faced this
season, which includes losses to
No. 7 Auburn and No. 10 Rutgers.
"This team is a lot better than
Auburn," he said. "Stanford has
more depth. Auburn is not as
great in as many spots, and the
inside game is much better here."
Four other Stanford players hit
for double-figures against the
Ducks, led by Stevens's 14 points.
Whiting, Henning, and Chris
MacMurdo added 10 each.
As the big lineup returned, so
did freshman guard Christy Hedg
peth. The off-guard had so
impressed the coaches in fall prac
tice that she was named the
starter for the nationally televised
opener at Tennessee — a tough
debut for a freshman. In that
game, Hedgpeth played thirty
minutes, managing four points on

l-of-6 shooting.
Trouble with her shot and inex
perience relegated Hedgpeth to a
backup role for the next eight
games, as sophomore Molly Good
enbour started. Hedgpeth aver
aged 16 minutes of time off the
bench in those games, and was
reinserted into the lineup against
Oregon State. The tough non-con
ference schedule helped her
mature quickly.
"I know more of what to
expect," Hedgpeth said. "We've
played the top teams in the coun
try, so I had confidence going in."
The North Carolina native
came up with five points, six
assists, and seven rebounds in 26
minutes against the Beavers. She
got the call again against Oregon,
but a tough first half of shooting
(she and Goodenbour were a com
bined 0-11 from the field) limited
her contribution.
"We're still really looking for a
lineup," VanDerveer said. "I liked
the combination of Sonja and
Christy."
Sophomore guard Angela Tay
lor, a who walked-on who made
the team last fall, was Hedgpeth's
replacement with 14:32 left in the
first half against OSU. It was an
uncharacteristic early entrance
for the crowd favorite, and Van-
Derveer was pleased with her play.
"I thought Angela showed good
defensive pressure," the coach
said. "She's going to play more."

utes of play, single-handedly
breaking open a close game with
Oregon.
"I gave her the green light to
shoot threes at will," Stanford
coach Tara VanDerveer said after
Zeilstra's offensive show. "I think
she sometimes passes up good
shots, but I don't think she did
that tonight."
Zeilstra's performance and
point guard Sonja Henning's 25
points were needed to hold off a
vastly improved Beaver team that
boasts nine new players. One new
comer is 6-4 center Natalia

Mattick, a West German who
gives OSU good size inside. Her 23
points and forward Judy Shan
non's 24 paced the Beaver attack.
"They're one of the most
improved teams in the Pac-10,"
VanDerveer said of the Beavers,
who lost for only the third time in
11 games. "They were well pre
pared for us."
After a woeful start to the sea
son, Stanford has improved its
rebounding, and it showed against
OSU. The Cardinal pulled down a
whopping 27 offensive rebounds
and outboarded its opponent 55-
34. This vindicated VanDerveer,
who felt that Stanford's rank of
10th in rebounding among Pac-10
teams was misleading because of
the Cardinal's difficult non-con
ference schedule.
"I know we can rebound," she
said.
Zeilstra led the way on the
boards as well, grabbing 13, while
Val Whiting continued to clean the
glass to transparency with 12
rebounds.
Rebounding was one of the rea
sons VanDerveer returned to her
"big lineup" against the Ducks.

The lineup, nicknamed the "Tri-
Towers," starts 6-3 players Zeil
stra, Trisha Stevens, and Val
Whiting in the frontcourt and 5-
10 Christy Hedgpeth with Sonja
Henning at guard. This lineup can
also help by contributing points at
the small forward spot.
VanDerveer used the lineup for
only the second time this season,
after the first attempt resulted in
a 15-point loss to Tennessee. "We
may have scrapped something
that was good at Tennessee with
out giving it enough time to
work."
Of the three towers, the small
forward is — you guessed it —
Zeilstra. Playing on the perimeter,
"Z" hit four of six three-pointers
and 12 of 16 from the floor over
all.
"Offensively, I'm pretty com
fortable [at the small forward],"
Zeilstra said. "It definitely opened
me up on the perimeter, and I
would be foolish not to take the
shots."
It was two such treys which
broke the backs of the Ducks, who
hung close to the Cardinal for
most of the first half and only
trailed by 11 at halftime. The first
increased the Stanford lead to 47-
33 to open the second half and
ignited the crowd, and the second
pushed the advantage to 17. Zeil
stra scored eight more points and
then left for good with more than
11 minutes to play. The game, for
all intents and purposes, was over.
Oregon coach Elwin Heiny
cited Stanford's defensive pres
sure as crucial to the Cardinal run
which built a 35-point lead at one
point. Heiny called Stanford the
toughest his team has faced this
season, which includes losses to
No. 7 Auburn and No. 10 Rutgers.
"This team is a lot better than
Auburn," he said. "Stanford has
more depth. Auburn is not as
great in as many spots, and the
inside game is much better here."
Four other Stanford players hit
for double-figures against the
Ducks, led by Stevens's 14 points.
Whiting, Henning, and Chris
MacMurdo added 10 each.
As the big lineup returned, so
did freshman guard Christy Hedg
peth. The off-guard had so
impressed the coaches in fall prac
tice that she was named the
starter for the nationally televised
opener at Tennessee — a tough
debut for a freshman. In that
game, Hedgpeth played thirty
minutes, managing four points on

l-of-6 shooting.
Trouble with her shot and inex
perience relegated Hedgpeth to a
backup role for the next eight
games, as sophomore Molly Good
enbour started. Hedgpeth aver
aged 16 minutes of time off the
bench in those games, and was
reinserted into the lineup against
Oregon State. The tough non-con
ference schedule helped her
mature quickly.
"I know more of what to
expect," Hedgpeth said. "We've
played the top teams in the coun
try, so I had confidence going in."
The North Carolina native
came up with five points, six
assists, and seven rebounds in 26
minutes against the Beavers. She
got the call again against Oregon,
but a tough first half of shooting
(she and Goodenbour were a com
bined 0-11 from the field) limited
her contribution.
"We're still really looking for a
lineup," VanDerveer said. "I liked
the combination of Sonja and
Christy."
Sophomore guard Angela Tay
lor, a who walked-on who made
the team last fall, was Hedgpeth's
replacement with 14:32 left in the
first half against OSU. It was an
uncharacteristic early entrance
for the crowd favorite, and Van-
Derveer was pleased with her play.
"I thought Angela showed good
defensive pressure," the coach
said. "She's going to play more."
Utilizing a pair of big lineups,
two big nights by forward Julie
Zeilstra, and tenacious rebound
ing by their big people, the Cardi
nal women's basketball team
posted a pair of decent-sized victo
ries at home over the Oregon
schools last week to open its
Pacific 10 Conference schedule.
While both final margins were
comfortable, No. 8-ranked Stan
ford did not display the type of
dominance it did against the same
schools last year, indicative both
of the Cardinal's changed person
nel and of the new talent at Ore
gon State and Oregon. Both
games were still up for grabs at
halftime.
This noted, the 99-81 win over
the Beavers and the 88-61 defeat
of the Ducks still gives Stanford a
fair head of steam going into this
Friday's showdown against con
ference nemesis Washington in
Seattle.
With the loss of two top scorers
to graduation and an injury to

another big gun in Trisha
Stevens, the 6-foot-3 Zeilstra has
had to step in and assume the
scoring duties for the Cardinal.
Going into Thursday's game
against Oregon State, the junior
led Stanford with a 17.3 points
per game average.
Apparently, Zeilstra was hold
ing something back. Dominating
offensively both inside and out,
the Vernal, Utah, native tore up
OSU for 27 points on 9-of-15
shooting, tying a career high. Two
nights later she set a new personal
best, pouring in 33 in only 26 min
utes of play, single-handedly
breaking open a close game with
Oregon.
