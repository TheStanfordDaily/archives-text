# Winter break hoops wrap-up
## Women manage to hold their own 
### David Hirning Senior staff writer 
Last year, the undefeated
Stanford women's basketball
knocked off the second-ranked
Tennessee Lady Volunteers 10
days before Christmas and had
a very merry holiday season.
The Cardinal easily won two
Christmas tournaments
against inferior competition
and waltzed into conference
play at 9-0.
This year, the Grinch almost
stole the Cardinal's Christmas.
The Grinch hatched this evil
plan, you see. First, he'd wipe
out the defending national
champions' top three scorers
(the graduated Jennifer Azzi
and Katy Steding, and the
injury-hampered Trisha
Stevens). Then, he'd give them
a December schedule that
included a pre-finals swing
through the Mountain Time
Zone (replete with a bout of
food poisoning and a scary
injury), a home tournament
with two teams ranked higher
than the Cardinal, and another

tournament that included
ranked Texas and top-ten Ten
nessee (who had already seen
and beaten the Cardinal earlier
in the year, 95-80).
You're a mean one, Mr.
Grinch. You really are a heel.
Stanford showed it knows
the true meaning of Christmas,
however, bouncing back from
an upset loss at Colorado and
giving its fans a gift by winning
the tough Cardinal Classic and
playing well in the Super
Shootout.
Here, then, is how the
women fared while The Daily
slept:
Colorado 71, Stanford 66
Coors Event Center, Dec. 6
The Cardinal had
rebounded from its opening
loss at Tennessee with a road
win over No. 10 Long Beach
State and a drubbing of Notre
Dame at home. But the Buf
faloes were lying in ambush for
them in Boulder. Stanford was
outrebounded for the fourth
consecutive game, 54-45, and
made barely a third of their shots
(34.4 percent).
The Cardinal trailed by two at
the half but fell behind by 13 with
11:27 left in the game. Stanford
then staged a rally that closed the
gap to one on Val Whiting's three
point play with 54 seconds
remaining. Colorado then con
verted two free throws, but a foul
sent Sonja Henning to the line
with 26 seconds left.
What followed was a bizarre set

of circumstances. Henning, who
shot nearly 74 percent from the
line last season, missed the front
end of the one-and-one. In the
scramble for the rebound, Julie
Zeilstra fouled Sherrice King and
injured her left shoulder. She left
the game, and a few minutes later
the Cardinal left the floor with
their second loss in four games.
VanDerveer observed that sim
ply playing Stanford is a huge
motivation for most teams. "It
seems we bring out the best in
every team we play," she said
afterwards.
Later, she brought up the game
again because of the lesson it
taught her team.

"We learned a lot from the loss
to Colorado," she said. "It was a
painful loss. . . . Everyone wants a
piece of that championship ban
ner, even if they can't get one of
their own. Against Colorado, we
found out that you better be ready
to play or you won't win the
game."
Stanford 78, Utah 74
John M. Huntsman Center, Dec. 8
The Cardinal carried into the
game the emotional baggage of
the upset loss, the doubtful condi
tion of their leading scorer, and a
nasty case of food poisoning that
affected Angela Taylor, Trisha
Stevens, and Tara VanDerveer.
The game was also a homecoming
for Vernal, Utah native Zeilstra.
With the trainer's permission,
Zeilstra played and scored 12
points, all of them necessary.
Stanford never trailed, but never
led by more than 13, either. Some
creative officiating almost cost the
Cardinal the game down the
stretch, as Zeilstra fouled out
while going up for a jumper with
1:43 to play. The 13-point lead
was whittled to two with only
eight seconds left, but Stevens'
two free throws iced the game for
Stanford.
Sonja Henning scored 15
points and had 5 assists to lead
the Cardinal.
Stanford 105, Brigham Young
64
Cardinal Clas√üic at Maples Pavilion,
Dec. 21
Ten days before the game with
the Cougars, VanDerveer
reflected on her murderous sched
ule that saw the Cardinal play
four out of the first five games on
the road, two against top ten
teams. "We need a game like
BYU," the beleaguered coach said.
VanDerveer faced the unusual
situation of being the underdog at
her own tournament. Either of
the other two teams, undefeated
and No. 3-ranked Georgia and No.
8 Northwestern, could hand the
Cardinal its third loss. However,
Stanford needed only to defeat
BYU to reach the finals, while the

other two squads would have to
beat up on each other.
Indeed, the 1-9 Cougs were just
what the doctor ordered for Stan
ford, which fell out of the top-ten
to No. 12 in the AP rankings after
the Colorado loss. Using it as a
game to "try a lot of lineups" and
let the players see the system "be
successful," the Cardinal pasted
the outclassed BYU squad and
revenged an eight-point loss four
years ago (despite a triple-double
by a freshman named Jennifer
Azzi).
Julie Zeilstra chipped in her
obligatory 20 points, leading five
players in double figures for the
Cardinal. And Stanford finally
outrebounded a team, with a 47-
43 edge.
Stanford 82, No. 3 Georgia 79
Cardinal Classic Championship at
Maples, Dec. 22
Georgia may have been 7-0, but
it also may have been tired from
the previous night's overtime win
over Northwestern. Stanford had
a boisterous crowd of 2500 and a
34-game home winning streak on
the line.
Make that 35.
It wasn't easy, however. The
Lady Bulldogs showed no signs of
fatigue as they raced out to a 21-
10 advantage. That's when Van-
Derveer inserted freshman guard
Christy Hedgpeth into the game.
Hedgpeth caught fire, hitting 5 of
5 from the field and 2 of 2 from
the three-point line. Her trey at
the 8:51 mark caught Georgia and
tied the game at 30-all. Stanford
went on to lead by eight at half;
Hedgpeth had 16 points to lead all
scorers.
It was a lead the Cardinal

never relinquished, but the Lady
Dawgs did cut it to two with less
than four minutes remaining.
Two baskets by Whiting nailed
down Stanford's biggest win of
the year so far.
Stanford 82, No. 21 Texas 00
Super Shootout at Hilton Head, S.C.
Dec. 29
A good win on a neutral court
against the Lady Longhorns, who
entered the season highly ranked
before losing the first three games
of the season. Sor\ja Henning had
perhaps her best game of the sea
son, scoring 21 points on 6-of-13
shooting. Zeilstra, Stevens and
Whiting also made double-figures
for the Cardinal, who led by 16 at
the half and then played even the
rest of the game.
No. 7 Tennessee 84, Stanford
77
Super Shootout Championship, Dec.
30
VanDerveer and the Cardinal
looked forward to a rematch with
the Lady Vols to provide a mea
sure of the team's improvement
from the opener.
The game was tied 38-all at the
half, with the Cardinal hitting 58
percent of their shots and Hen
ning scoring 13. But with the
game in doubt in the second half,
Stanford let Tennessee off the
hook.
"We had a chance to win, but
we got down by 10 and couldn't
get it back," VanDerveer said.
So it seems that, for all the
Grinch's efforts, it was the Cardi
nal's heart that grew many times
its size over the Christmas sea
son. Now, the team will see if the
rest of the season can be as jolly.
