# Men go 3-0 at home, 1-2 on road

Even if you loved your time
at home during winter break,
you probably didn't appreciate
it half as much as the Stanford
men's basketball team. The
Cardinal romped in three home
games during the vacation,
then dropped two of three on
the road before opening Pacific
10 Conference play last Thurs
day at Oregon State.
Stanford lost that game and
fell again yesterday at Oregon.
With a 1-4 record in its last five
games — all of them on the
road — Stanford will be more
than happy to return to Maples
Pavilion this week to take on
Washington and Washington
State.
With the winter break
games, which began the day

after finals ended, the Cardinal
finished its non-conference
schedule with a 7-3 record.
Stanford 82, Santa Clara 47
Maples Pavilion, Dec. 15
After a two-week layoff for
Dead Week and finals, the Car
dinal came out and handed the
Broncos their second-worst
defeat ever. Santa Clara scored
a whopping 11 points (yes,
eleven) in the first half.
Center Adam Keefe led
Stanford with 12 points (five
for-six from the floor, two-for
two from the line), while
Andrew Vlahov, Deshon
Wingate and Kenny Hicks
added 11.
Keefe also dominated on
defense, holding Santa Clara's
7-foot-1, 285-pound Ron Reis
