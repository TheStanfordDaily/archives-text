# Men go 3-0 at home, 1-2 on road
## 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
Even if you loved your time
at home during winter break,
you probably didn't appreciate
it half as much as the Stanford
men's basketball team. The
Cardinal romped in three home
games during the vacation,
then dropped two of three on
the road before opening Pacific
10 Conference play last Thurs
day at Oregon State.
Stanford lost that game and
fell again yesterday at Oregon.
With a 1-4 record in its last five
games — all of them on the
road — Stanford will be more
than happy to return to Maples
Pavilion this week to take on
Washington and Washington
State.
With the winter break
games, which began the day

after finals ended, the Cardinal
finished its non-conference
schedule with a 7-3 record.
Stanford 82, Santa Clara 47
Maples Pavilion, Dec. 15
After a two-week layoff for
Dead Week and finals, the Car
dinal came out and handed the
Broncos their second-worst
defeat ever. Santa Clara scored
a whopping 11 points (yes,
eleven) in the first half.
Center Adam Keefe led
Stanford with 12 points (five
for-six from the floor, two-for
two from the line), while
Andrew Vlahov, Deshon
Wingate and Kenny Hicks
added 11.
Keefe also dominated on
defense, holding Santa Clara's
7-foot-1, 285-pound Ron Reis
to a measly five points (12 below
his average) and five rebounds
(seven below normal). The Cardi
nal hit 31 of its 60 field goal
attempts, while the Broncos made
just 17 of 59.
After the game, Santa Clara
coach Carroll Williams said Stan
ford was the best team his Bron
cos had played — including Indi
ana, who had beaten Santa Clara
by only five points.
Stanford 117, UC-Irvine 87
Maples Pavilion, Dec. 19
The Anteaters came into this
game convinced that pressing the
Cardinal was the only way to win.
So they pressed and ran and
pressed and ran... and got run
straight into the ground.
Stanford turned the ball over
against the press only once in the
first half, shredding the Irvine
defense on the way to a 56-37
halftime lead. When the dust had
settled (and the Anteaters had
wiped the sneaker prints off their
foreheads) the Cardinal had its
second highest scoring total ever.
It was only the second time in
coach Mike Montgomery's five
years here that Stanford had bro
ken 100.
Stanford 86, Florida 74
Maples Pavilion, Dec. 21
The Cardinal led this one by 12
at the half and cruised from there,
getting the lead as high as 19 at
one point.

Florida's front line of Stacie
Poole, Hosie Grimsley and
Dwayne Davis stand 6-6, 6-4 and
6-7, and that didn't do a heck of a
lot of good against the 6-9 Keefe,
6-7 Vlahov and 6-7 Wingate. Davis
led all scorers with 27 (12-of-13(!)
from the field), but he didn't get
any help.
Stanford was led by (surprise)
Keefe, who had 22 points, while
Vlahov added 13. Ammann and
Patrick made seven of their nine
three-point attempts.
Colorado 89, Stanford 79
Colorado Conference Center, Dec. 23
With three easy home wins in
the books, the Cardinal headed
for Boulder for its first road game
of the season — and ran straight
into an aggressive Buffalo squad.
Guard Stevie Wise had 29 points
(15 on three-pointers) to lead Col
orado, which won despite being
outrebounded 38-26.
Keefe led Stanford (yet again)
with 20 points and 15 boards and
kept Colorado center Shaun Van
diver in foul trouble all night.
The difference in the game
came at the three-point line: Stan
ford hit five of its eight threes, but
Colorado had nine (in 19
attempts). Ammann had three
three-pointers on the way to a 16-
point performance; Vlahov added
another 16 and Hicks had 10.
Stanford 70,
Central Florida 61
Orlando Arena, Dec. 29
Central Florida whittled away
at a 16-point halftime deficit, but
ran out of time in the first game of
the Florida Citrus Bowl/Red Lob

ster Classic. The Cardinal went
dangerously cold at the end of the
game, hitting only three field
goals in the last 12 minutes, but
four free throws by Ammann and
three by Patrick in the last 70 sec
onds kept the Knights at bay.
Keefe had 17 points (with 10
rebounds), Patrick 16 and
Ammann 15. It was Ammann who
sparked an early 12-0 run with
eight points, as the win earned the
Cardinal the right to play North
Carolina in the tournament's
championship game.
No. 7 North Carolina 71,
Stanford 60
Orlando Arena, Dec. 30
The Tar Heels looked like they
were on their way to a romp late
in the first half, but the Cardinal
would have none of it. Clawing
back against a ferocious trapping
defense and taking advantage of
absolutely horrid Carolina shoot
ing, Stanford wiped out a 13-point
deficit and was up by five with 13
minutes left in the game.
After that, though, momentum
swung back to the 'Heels, who
turned the defensive pressure up
a notch to take control of the
game. An 18-6 run midway
through the second half, just after
Stanford took its five-point lead,
proved to be decisive. North Car
olina shot 33 per cent in the sec
ond half, missed four dunks and
generally did not look anything
like the No. 7 team in the country.
Stanford was led by You-Know-
Who, who had 20 points.
With four wins in the six
games, Stanford took a 7-3 record
up to Oregon last week to open
Pac-10 play.
