# Women fall to UCLA in regional
## 
### Harold Yu Staff writer 
Cardinal volleyball players Bev
Oden and Kristin Klein each made
the second Final Four appear
ances of their careers Dec. 13 at
the University of Maryland. But
like their previous trips, the Stan
ford standouts went to observe as
first-team All-Americans rather
than play as Final Four competi
tors.
Klein, Oden and company came
one match shy of that feat, ending
a resurgent season with a loss in
the finals of the Western Regional
tournament. The Cardinal (27-4)
fell to No. 1-ranked and eventual
national champion UCLA, 15-10,
15-8, 15-12 at Wooden Center
Dec. 8. The Bruins were over
powering, securing their third vic
tory in as many tries against Stan
ford. UCLA proceeded to Mary
land Dec. 13 where they joined
Louisiana State University, the
University of Pacific and
Nebraska in the NCAA Final
Four. The Bruins swept both LSU

and Pacific to claim the 1991 title.
Stanford did little better than
its Final Four counterparts,
relenting to a Bruin team that
executed the fundamentals to per
fection. UCLA All-American
Natalie Williams was menacing,
pouding 29 kills and hitting .512.
"I think this is the best UCLA
tCalTi that we've played," Oden
said after the contest.
The Bruins dictated the affairs
from the beginning. While the
Cardinal was able to control the
ball and attack effectively,
UCLA's defense was unrelenting.
The teams rallied to a 4-4 tie in a
game that promised to last a
while.
Oden and All-Pac-10 middle
blocker Amy Cooper established
the middle attack, leading Stan
ford to a 9-6 advantage. The
blocker tandem had eight kills
altogether in the streak.
UCLA answered with a little
known middle blocker named Lisa
Hudak. After a Klein kill, Hudak
entered the match and immedi
ately recorded a block. She then

slammed four kills to complement
the deep Bruin outside attack.
UCLA proceeded to record four
teen consecutive sideouts.
"(UCLA setter) Holly (McPeak)
and I stayed after practice and
worked on my hitting all week,"
Hudak said. "I think it showed in
that she had more confidence in
me and trusted that if she set the
ball to me it would end up in a
kill."
Stanford outside hitter Jen
nifer Jackson hit through the
block to end her squad's offensive
drought. But Hudak then killed
an overpassed ball and the Bruins
terminated the first game.
"We didn't serve as tough as we
would have liked to," Stanford
coach Don Shaw said. "We didn't
side out consistently when we got
chances to score. I felt we had
good control of the first game the
longer it went. But we didn't side
out as we should. If we had won
that first game it might have been
a different match. I felt it gave
them a great deal of momentum."
UCLA rode that momentum to

a convincing game two display.
Klein powered three kills early to
prop Stanford ahead 2-0. But
Hudak again converted a McPeak
set. Ail-American Jenny Evans
slammed a crosscourt putaway
and then aced the Cardinal.
UCLA led 4-2 before Stanford
could settle down.
The Cardinal tried to pick away
at the Bruin lead but could do lit
tle better than match side-outs.
Stanford hit .118 in the game
while the Bruins attacked at a
.302 clip.
Stanford coach Shaw did every
thing he could to stop the melee.
He called timeouts down 4-7 and
4-12 and tried player substitu
tions like using sophomore Kristi
Paaso.
The one thing Shaw couldn't
do was take UCLA's Natalie
Williams off the court. That made
all the difference. Williams was
McPeak's terminator option. She
managed a kill in almost every
opportunity she had. After each of
Williams six game kills, her fans
in the stands showed their appre
ciation by bowing to her.
Cooper halted the streak tem
porarily with a quick attack for a
sideout. After a mini sideout-war,
the Cardinal lofted up an overpass
for UCLA's Marissa Hatchett.
She hammered away at the gift as
her Bruins finished Stanford off
in 22 minutes.
"We did not pass the ball very
well toinight," Klein said. "It is
hard to hit effectively when the
defense knows where it's going. It
is hard to hit high sets."
Game three devolved into a
slugfest. Both teams unleashed its
big guns as Oden and Williams
teed away. Williams missed long in
her first swing of the game and
the Cardinal built a 2-0 lead.
UCLA Ail-American Jenny
Evans slammed a kill to charge
the Bruin offense. Williams then
tomahawked four more kills and
raised her fist in exclamation with
each one.
Cardinal co-captain Jessica
Benton struck for several game
three kills but the Cardinal strug
gled to keep pace. Despite her ten
match kills, Stanford faced the
prospects of elimination. UCLA
streaked ahead 13-9 on the
strength of their block and
defense.
Despite a saved match-point

after a Benton kill, the Cardinal
could still not stop the high-flying
Williams. She pounded down the
decisive kill with authority and
then turned to her teammates to
start the celebration.
"UCLA's a great team and they
proved it," Shaw said. "We were
doing the things we wanted to try
to do. We just gave them too many
one-contact points."
The Bruins outhit the Cardinal

.303 to .238, had six more blocks
and five more digs. Evans had 15
kills and Hatchett had 17 to com
plement Williams' numbers.
Stanford was led by Oden who
had 18 kills and Klein who had 14.
Oden and Cooper were both
named to the West All-Region
team at the conclusion of the tour
nament. The Stanford tandem

was joined by McPeak, Williams
and Hatchett from UCLA and
New Mexico's Pauline Manser.
The Cardinal qualified for the
final with a convincing defeat of
San Diego State the previous
night. Stanford won 15-11, 13-15,
15-6, 15-1. The Aztecs were held
to an .067 team hitting percentage
and had fifteen attacks blocked.
Oden led the Cardinal with 16
kills and seven blocks. Benton
contributed 12 kills, six blocks
and a .474 hitting percentage. The
Cardinal needed only one hour
and twenty-eight minutes to van
quish San Diego State.
While the tournament pro
duced the eventual national
champion, several coaches
expressed some concern over its

setup. The fact that both No. 1
UCLA and No. 3 Stanford played
in the same region meant that one
of the four top-ranked teams in
the nation would be unable to
qualify for the Final Four.
A number of coaches felt that
the final of the Western Regional
was the true national champi
onship contest. Shaw himself felt
that a seeding process would be
more favorable for the NCAA
tournament so that each of the
top four teams would play in a dif
ferent regional.
The current playoff system
may be put to a test next season as
UCLA and Stanford should again
clearly be the two most dominant
teams in the country. UCLA
returns all of its current starters
except outside hitter Samantha
Shaver and setter McPeak.
Shaver's loss may mean little
because the Bruins will return

former first team Ail-American
hitter Elaine Youngs. McPeak will
be replaced by Julie Bremner who
recently started for the U.S.
National team.
The Cardinal should be
UCLA's top challenger. Stanford
returns five starters, including
All-Americans Klein and Oden
and All-Pac-10 Cooper. Middle
blocker Benton will graduate but
junior Nicole Appleman, fresh
man Heidi Eick or junior Jodi
Birk can step in.
Prior to the Final Four, Oden
was announced as the 1990-91
National Player of the Year. The
sophomore has been named a first
team All-American in each of her
first two seasons and is widely
considered the most dominant col
legiate player in the country. Oden
now has the unique opportunity
to be a three-time National Player
of the Year in her career.

was joined by McPeak, Williams
and Hatchett from UCLA and
New Mexico's Pauline Manser.
The Cardinal qualified for the
final with a convincing defeat of
San Diego State the previous
night. Stanford won 15-11, 13-15,
15-6, 15-1. The Aztecs were held
to an .067 team hitting percentage
and had fifteen attacks blocked.
Oden led the Cardinal with 16
kills and seven blocks. Benton
contributed 12 kills, six blocks
and a .474 hitting percentage. The
Cardinal needed only one hour
and twenty-eight minutes to van
quish San Diego State.
While the tournament pro
duced the eventual national
champion, several coaches
expressed some concern over its

setup. The fact that both No. 1
UCLA and No. 3 Stanford played
in the same region meant that one
of the four top-ranked teams in
the nation would be unable to
qualify for the Final Four.
A number of coaches felt that
the final of the Western Regional
was the true national champi
onship contest. Shaw himself felt
that a seeding process would be
more favorable for the NCAA
tournament so that each of the
top four teams would play in a dif
ferent regional.
The current playoff system
may be put to a test next season as
UCLA and Stanford should again
clearly be the two most dominant
teams in the country. UCLA
returns all of its current starters
except outside hitter Samantha
Shaver and setter McPeak.
Shaver's loss may mean little
because the Bruins will return

former first team Ail-American
hitter Elaine Youngs. McPeak will
be replaced by Julie Bremner who
recently started for the U.S.
National team.
The Cardinal should be
UCLA's top challenger. Stanford
returns five starters, including
All-Americans Klein and Oden
and All-Pac-10 Cooper. Middle
blocker Benton will graduate but
junior Nicole Appleman, fresh
man Heidi Eick or junior Jodi
Birk can step in.
Prior to the Final Four, Oden
was announced as the 1990-91
National Player of the Year. The
sophomore has been named a first
team All-American in each of her
first two seasons and is widely
considered the most dominant col
legiate player in the country. Oden
now has the unique opportunity
to be a three-time National Player
of the Year in her career.
Cardinal volleyball players Bev
Oden and Kristin Klein each made
the second Final Four appear
ances of their careers Dec. 13 at
the University of Maryland. But
like their previous trips, the Stan
ford standouts went to observe as
first-team All-Americans rather
than play as Final Four competi
tors.
Klein, Oden and company came
one match shy of that feat, ending
a resurgent season with a loss in
the finals of the Western Regional
tournament. The Cardinal (27-4)
fell to No. 1-ranked and eventual
national champion UCLA, 15-10,
15-8, 15-12 at Wooden Center
Dec. 8. The Bruins were over
powering, securing their third vic
tory in as many tries against Stan
ford. UCLA proceeded to Mary
land Dec. 13 where they joined
Louisiana State University, the
University of Pacific and
Nebraska in the NCAA Final
Four. The Bruins swept both LSU

and Pacific to claim the 1991 title.
Stanford did little better than
its Final Four counterparts,
relenting to a Bruin team that
executed the fundamentals to per
fection. UCLA All-American
Natalie Williams was menacing,
pouding 29 kills and hitting .512.
"I think this is the best UCLA
tCalTi that we've played," Oden
said after the contest.
The Bruins dictated the affairs
from the beginning. While the
Cardinal was able to control the
ball and attack effectively,
UCLA's defense was unrelenting.
The teams rallied to a 4-4 tie in a
game that promised to last a
while.
Oden and All-Pac-10 middle
blocker Amy Cooper established
the middle attack, leading Stan
ford to a 9-6 advantage. The
blocker tandem had eight kills
altogether in the streak.
UCLA answered with a little
known middle blocker named Lisa
Hudak. After a Klein kill, Hudak
entered the match and immedi
ately recorded a block. She then

slammed four kills to complement
the deep Bruin outside attack.
UCLA proceeded to record four
teen consecutive sideouts.
"(UCLA setter) Holly (McPeak)
and I stayed after practice and
worked on my hitting all week,"
Hudak said. "I think it showed in
that she had more confidence in
me and trusted that if she set the
ball to me it would end up in a
kill."
Stanford outside hitter Jen
nifer Jackson hit through the
block to end her squad's offensive
drought. But Hudak then killed
an overpassed ball and the Bruins
terminated the first game.
"We didn't serve as tough as we
would have liked to," Stanford
coach Don Shaw said. "We didn't
side out consistently when we got
chances to score. I felt we had
good control of the first game the
longer it went. But we didn't side
out as we should. If we had won
that first game it might have been
a different match. I felt it gave
them a great deal of momentum."
UCLA rode that momentum to

a convincing game two display.
Klein powered three kills early to
prop Stanford ahead 2-0. But
Hudak again converted a McPeak
set. Ail-American Jenny Evans
slammed a crosscourt putaway
and then aced the Cardinal.
UCLA led 4-2 before Stanford
could settle down.
The Cardinal tried to pick away
at the Bruin lead but could do lit
tle better than match side-outs.
Stanford hit .118 in the game
while the Bruins attacked at a
.302 clip.
Stanford coach Shaw did every
thing he could to stop the melee.
He called timeouts down 4-7 and
4-12 and tried player substitu
tions like using sophomore Kristi
Paaso.
The one thing Shaw couldn't
do was take UCLA's Natalie
Williams off the court. That made
all the difference. Williams was
McPeak's terminator option. She
managed a kill in almost every
opportunity she had. After each of
Williams six game kills, her fans
in the stands showed their appre
ciation by bowing to her.
Cooper halted the streak tem
porarily with a quick attack for a
sideout. After a mini sideout-war,
the Cardinal lofted up an overpass
for UCLA's Marissa Hatchett.
She hammered away at the gift as
her Bruins finished Stanford off
in 22 minutes.
"We did not pass the ball very
well toinight," Klein said. "It is
hard to hit effectively when the
defense knows where it's going. It
is hard to hit high sets."
Game three devolved into a
slugfest. Both teams unleashed its
big guns as Oden and Williams
teed away. Williams missed long in
her first swing of the game and
the Cardinal built a 2-0 lead.
UCLA Ail-American Jenny
Evans slammed a kill to charge
the Bruin offense. Williams then
tomahawked four more kills and
