# Collegiate Baseball puts Card nine at top
## 
### 
Collegiate Baseball has ranked Stanford No. 1 in a
preseason poll of coaches, putting the Cardinal atop
a list that includes Oklahoma State at No. 2, Arizona
State at No. 3 and Georgia Tech and Louisiana State
at Nos. 4 and 5.
Stanford returns six starters from last year's
record-shattering team, which finished third at the
College World Series after losing to eventual champi
on Georgia in the semifinals. The 1990 Cardinal,
which finished 59-12 and won the Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division with a 24-6 record, set
school records for wins, home runs, doubles, total
bases, fielding percentage, strikeouts and wins by a
pitcher.
Six starters back from one of the best (if not the
best) teams in school history sounds like a great deal,
but consider who the Cardinal has to replace: Four
year starter Paul Carey (.333 and 16 homers last
year, holds the school and Pac-10 record with 56
career homers); third baseman Tim Griffin (21
homers, 75 RBI in 1990); and second baseman Troy
Paulsen (.345, 108 hits last year). All three were all-
Pac-10 selections. The Cardinal also lost starting
pitchers Mike Mussina (14-5, 3.30 ERA) and Stan
Spencer (14-1, 2.84), who share the school record for
wins by a pitcher.
Not that there isn't a lot a talent left: Center field
er Jeff Hammonds, last year's national Freshman of
the Year, returns. All Hammonds did last year was
set school records for steals and runs while hitting in
a Pac-10-record 37 straight games. Left fielder Ryan
Turner (.347) is also back, as are first baseman David
McCarty (.346, 12 homers, 62 RBI), shortstop Roger
Burnett (.274), catcher Troy Tallman (.285, 10
homers) and designated hitter David Holbrook
(.276).
On the hill, senior John Reid (7-1) and sophomore
Brian Sackinsky (10-1), both of whom had their best
performances of the season at the College World
Series, are ready to pick up where they left off.

Coach Mark Marquess has had quite a few teams ranked No. 1 through the years, including rankings at the begin
ning, middle and end of various seasons. This year Marquess and the top-ranked Cardinal will try to continue the
unprecedented success of last year's team and improve upon their 1990 finish by proving the prognosticators true
this spring In Omaha, Neb.
