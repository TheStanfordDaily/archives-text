# New IDs for 1991
## 
### Cecilia Tom Editorial staff 
Stanford has decided to give its
students a new number and a new
identity to greet the new year.
The University changed the
last digit on students' identifica
tion numbers — the "check" digit
— on winter quarter identifica
tion cards. According to Acting
Registrar Jack Farrell, the num
ber is altered to fit standardized
computer algorithms for data
entry.
The check digit is determined
by the first six digits of the stu
dent ID, which constitute the real
identification number. When the
number is entered into a system,
the last digit serves as a check
against errors in the entering pro
cess.
In the past, the University has
employed computer programs
specifically designed for Stanford,
said Eileen Smith, an analyst at
the University's Network for Stu
dent Information. Now the Uni
versity has decided to "go with
industry standards" so that pro
grams can be purchased off the
shelf, she said.
Farrell characterized the
change as "absolutely insignifi
cant" and said the altered digit
should have "no discernible
effects at all" on students.
Smith said both the old and
new numbers will be acceptable
for at least the rest of the aca
demic year.
Faculty and staff IDs are also
being altered in the same manner.
