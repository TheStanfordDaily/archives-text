Lockers for commuters offered
The Office of Transportation Programs will
soon offer full-size lockers to bikers who commute
to campus in order to make the ride easier.
Off-campus students, faculty and staff are eli
gible to reserve the lockers for an annual fee of
$15. The office is still trying to determine where
the lockers would be best placed and is soliciting
input from bike commuters.
Last spring during hearings before the Com
mittee on Parking and Transportation, several
commuters said they would ride their bicycles to
work instead of drive if lockers were available.
