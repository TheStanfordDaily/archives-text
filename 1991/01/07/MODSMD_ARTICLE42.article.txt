## 
### Andrea Hungerford Staff writer 
Five students have been given
Dean's Service Awards for contri
butions ranging from defending
free speech to coordinating Orien
tation for international students.
The recipients for fall quarter
are Darrell Armstrong, Perry
Friedman, Janine Jones, Myriam
Perez and Gayatri Taneja.
The James W. Lyons Award for
Service, named after the former
dean of Student Affairs who
retired last year, is designed to
recognize and applaud students'
service contributions to a variety
of clubs, departments and com
munity projects that often go oth
erwise unnoticed.
Recipients are selected each
quarter based on nominations
from faculty, staff and students.
Armstrong, a senior majoring
in public policy, was honored for
serving as a liaison between stu
dents of color and the business
community and for seeking to pro
mote diversity in the American
work force. He is co-founder of
Stanford's first black church and
has spent past years working with
black foster children in Los Ange
les.

His future plans include the
pursuit of a master's degree in
divinity at Howard University.
But immediately after graduation,
he said he plans to apply for a
Gardner Fellowship, with which
he would develop a program with
the Department of Children's
Social Services in Los Angeles
County â€” an organization that
coordinates foster youth place
ment.
Friedman received his award
for participation in the Student
Conduct Legislative Committee
during last year's controversy
over a proposed revised interpre
tation of the Fundamental Stan
dard and for his role as an ASSU
critic. In addition, he is a pro
grammer for Academic Informa
tion Resources' computer facility
and a long-time member of the
Chaparral humor magazine.
Friedman, a coterminal stu
dent in computer science, has
been well-known at Stanford since
his freshman year when he forged
the number one housing draw
ticket to get his picture on the
front page of The Daily. He suc
ceeded.
"A lot of people were surprised
that I won the Dean's Award," he
said. "On this campus, I'm just

not politically correct."
A senior majoring in photogra
phy, Jones was cited for her com
mitment to the Poolaw Photogra
phy Project, designed to honor
photographer Horace Poolaw and
the Kiowa people. Jones spent
nine months working on the
Poolaw exhibit, which was on dis
play in Meyer Library last quarter.
Her interest in the project
arose, she explained, because

"Poolaw was the only Native
American photographer able to
record his own culture in transi
tion from the traditional Indian
lifestyle through the process of
adapting to American culture."
She spent last winter break in
Oklahoma with 20 other students
researching Poolaw's photographs
and helped to organize and print
almost 1,700 negatives.
Following graduation, Jones

said she plans to return to her
home in New York, where she'll
seek employment as a photogra
phy assistant.
Perez, a senior, said she was
pleased with her award. "Coming
from high school, you feel pretty
confident. Then you get to college
and it's humbling ... and a lot of
the stuff I've done is behind the
scenes and off campus, so I was
really thrilled to receive the recog
nition."
A biological sciences mcgor and
premedical student, Perez was
cited for numerous and varied ser
vice projects. She serves on Cowell
Student Health Center's Advisory,
Review and Evaluation committee
and is a member of the Stanford
Soviet Exchange Project.
In addition, she worked on a
substance abuse prevention pro
gram in Los Angeles and was a
counselor at Camp Ronald
McDonald. She also coordinates
programs for the Special Services
Unit at the Stanford Police
Department.
Her future plans include prac
ticing pediatrics. "I think it's
important in medicine that you
don't just concentrate on the clin
ical side of medical care, but on
the entire well-being of the per

son," she said.
Taneja, a senior, came to Stan
ford as an international student
from India. "My freshman year
was the first year they had an Ori
entation for international stu
dents, and we had a great pro
gram. ... I was so obliged to the
Orientation Volunteers, I just
wanted to give something back by
helping new international stu
dents."
The award was presented to
Taneja for her long-term commit
ment to helping international stu
dents adjust to life at Stanford,
serving first as an Orientation
Volunteer and then as an Orienta
tion Coordinator.
Taneja said she is unsure what
she will do with her human biol
ogy mcyor or whether she'll return
to India. "I'm really interested in
special education and teaching
and psychology," she said, "and
I'd love to teach in India."
A ceremony and dinner was
held Dec. 7 for the award recipi
ents, their friends and nominators
at the home of Norm Robinson,
acting dean of Student Affairs.
Each recipient will be presented
with a bronze medallion and cer
tificate. More than 200 students
have received the award.
