# ASSU may limit focus to Stanford
## Bill up for vote at next meeting 
### David Bianco Editorial staff 
The ASSU Senate will vote
Thursday on a bill that would bar
the group from legislating on non-
Stanford issues such as the Per
sian Gulf crisis.
Proposed at last quarter's final
meeting, the bill was referred to
the senate's Administration and
Rules Committee, which was split
3-3 on the bill at its Dec. 3 meet
ing, according to senior David
Brown, a senator who serves on
the committee. Brown, a former
Council of Presidents member,
opposes the bill.
Brown said that despite his
suggestion that the ASSU conduct
a dorm poll to assess student opin
ion on the bill, the committee
chose to submit the bill to the full
senate at the first meeting of win
ter quarter. He said he might work
with other senators and dorm rep
resentatives to tiy to poll students
independently from the ASSU
early this quarter.
The bill was introduced by
graduate senator John Overdeck
in response to student objections
over a senate bill passed Nov. 15
opposing an unprovoked U.S. mil
itary offensive in the Persian Gulf.
The new bill resolves "that the
senate shall confine its bills and
resolutions to University-related
matters of an academic, adminis
trative, fiscal and social nature."
Overdeck said he did not expect
the bill to pass, but both he and
Brown said they looked forward to
hearing open debate on the sen
ate's role.
In the past, the senate has
passed non-Stanford-related bills
supporting Chinese students
protesting for democracy, the Wat
sonville earthquake rebuilding
effort and the United Farm Work
ers grape boycott and condemning
the murder of Central American
Jesuit priests last year.
