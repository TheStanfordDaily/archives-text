# ASSU examines new business options
## 
### David Bianco Editorial staff 
Think the ASSU does nothing for you?
What if it found you a date for the Viennese
Ball?
It's not so far fetched. The ASSU may go
into matchmaking if one of two proposals for
an ASSU dating service is selected as the new
ASSU business project to replace the now
defunct ASSU dry-cleaning service.
The two dating-service proposals, one of
which would establish a video-dating service,
are among 16 ideas submitted for the ASSU's
business project contest which offers a $500
prize. According to ASSU Financial manager
Torrence Boone, a senior, a committee will
meet to evaluate the proposals and select some
as finalists.
"We're going to pick the ones we think are
implementable,"' Boone said, citing a Chinese
cafe as a project that is "impossible to imple
ment."

Boone has received pro
posals ranging from a
video store to a loan ser
vice to a poster shop.

Several of the proposals emphasize bringing
down the costs of various student-oriented
goods and services, Boone said. Some of the
students submitting proposals have been
involved in entrepreneurial activities on cam
pus, he added.
Some other ideas Boone received include:
• Two proposals for a video rental store,
• An "ASSU Loan Service" which would
provide short-term loans for students needing
such items as stereos, television sets, bicycles
or car repairs,
• A "Friday Classic Flicks" that would show

classic movies on Fridays in Cubberley
Auditorium,
• A used compact disc store/artist's gallery,
• A service that would buy books for stu
dents, relieving them of the need to stand in
line at the Bookstore,
• A store that would buy and sell used stu
dent clothing,
• A store specializing in environmentally
sound goods,
• A poster shop, and
• An office to create ASSU Study Guides,
which would be student-written, expanded lec
ture notes including solved problem sets and
answer keys.
The former dry-cleaning office is the pro
posed site for many of the projects.
Boone said the finalists will be asked for a
detailed business plan. He said he hopes the
final selection will be made by the middle of
winter quarter, leaving enough time for the
ASSU Senate to approve the business by the
end of winter quarter.
