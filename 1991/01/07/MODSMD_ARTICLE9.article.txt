# Gardner says public service necessary to create change
## 
### Larissa Thompson 
Public Service Prof. John
Gardner has been called Stan
ford's "designated source of inspi
ration and wise counsel" by Uni
versity President Donald
Kennedy. A Stanford graduate,
Gardner served as President
Johnson's Secretary of Health,
Education and Welfare and
founded the organizations Com
mon Cause, the Independent Sec
tor and the National Urban Coali
tion. He has authored six books on
the subjects of leadership and edu
cation. In 1964, Gardner received
one of the highest civilian awards
in the United States, the Presi
dential Medal of Freedom.
What do you feel is the most
effective way for a person to
bring about change in society
or change in government pol
icy?
I think the most effective path
is to select an area, a manageable
area, in which you can become
thoroughly informed and then
stay with it. Stay with it after the
initial frustrations — and the
defeats and the annoyances —
until you discover how you can
really have some impact on peo
ple. You can't bring about social
change if you have a low frustra
tion level.
I think people make contribu
tions depending on their gifts.
Rachel Carson wrote a book called
"Silent Spring" which had as big
an impact on the environmental
movement as any of the organiza
tional leaders. She was a writer.
That was her contribution. She
was, in her way, a leader.
Other people have great orga
nizational skills, and they can
form a movement and bring about
change. And other people are
skilled at serving in political
office, and they can bring about
change through that route. But
they all involve a long-term con
ception of what change is and how
it comes about. It takes time.
What qualities make a good
leader?
Well, the first thing you have to
say is that all the research on the
traits of leadership suggest that
the important traits depend on
the situation.
I would put first, I think, num

ber one, what I call judgment in
action, which is a little bit differ
ent from judgment in editing a
term paper or writing a book,
which heaven knows takes a lot of
judgment.
But judgment in action means
judgment that brings you to the
right outcomes when the data is
insufficient for a decision, but you
have to make a decision, a judg
ment made when people are
yelling at you and the time is too
short. So that it takes not just
judgment, but a certain calmness
in action.
The second, I have to say, is
probably physical stamina. There
are very few leaders that don't
have a pretty good supply of phys
ical energy. I spend a lot of time
working with leaders in the ghetto
and in unions and in work situa
tions. They're the ones who can
put in a fuU day's work and still go
to the union meeting at night, or
the meeting for their ethnic
group, or whatever it is, and spend
three hours being a leader. Every
body else is exhausted, but they
still have the supply of energy.
I would certainly list persis
tence. Persistence of purpose, pur
posefulness. Not forgetting what
your goal is.
There are lots of other things,
such as courage. It does take a cer
tain amount of courage, because a
lot of people don't want to do what
you're trying to talk them into.
You make enemies.
How would you like to see
public service at Stanford
grow over the next few years?
I would love to see a public ser
vice requirement for graduation
much in the mode of the old phys
ical education requirement as it
was when I went to Stanford. And
I recognize that a lot of people
wouldn't go into this with very
much of a spirit of public service,
. .. but a great many would be
reminded of the fact that they owe
something to their society.
Also, I believe that there's
always a hazard that students in
an institution such as this drift
steadily away from the main
stream of American life. They
don't intend to, but from the day
of high school graduation and
even before they have been sepa
rated ... on the basis of their
capacity to manipulate verbal and

numerical symbols.
And they become a more and
more select group, more and more
apart from the police officer on
the beat and the worker on the
production line. Much less speak
ing a common language, less con
scious of the mainstream of Amer
ica.
You once said, "An over
dose of pluralism divides
rather than unites," and
"Society should be wary of
pluralism that reflects no
commitment to the common
good." What do you think of
Stanford's emphasis of multi
culturalism?
I think what we really need is
summed up in the phrase "whole
ness incorporating diversity." And
what you need is a circumstance
in which a community allows and
encourages each sub-group to
have its own identity, to find its
own roots, to have its own self
respect, to be an honored member
of the community.
But then every sub-group has
to reach back and say, "What can
we do to make it a better total
community?" That's why I use
the phrase "wholeness incorporat
ing diversity." And we have drifted
very much in the nation as a
whole towards pluralism without
a feeling of the whole enterprise.
Everybody goes off on their own
path.
As an undergraduate, what
were your career plans?
I was going to write the great
American novel. Capital letters:
GREAT AMERICAN NOVEL. I
had intended to since I was in high
school. And I worked very hard at
it, but concluded fairly early that I
was not the next Hemingway or F.
Scott Fitzgerald.
First, it looked to me like a very
long path if I were to achieve what
I really wanted to achieve, and I
had very high standards, very

high goals.
Second, I had met the young
woman that I wanted to marry. I
felt that I had better address
myself to the question of earning
a living.
So I turned to psychology. I did
my entire psychology major in my
senior year, introductory courses
and advanced courses and every
thing.
You graduated from Stan
ford in 1935 and received your
master's degree in 1936. What
do you feel has been the most
significant change at Stan
ford since that time?
Well, the most significant
change is its emergence as an

absolutely first-rate world institu
tion. Stanford, when I attended it,
would have ranked perhaps in the
second 10 of American universi
ties, and that was a long way back
in our history. Now we rank in the
top one or two or three consis
tently.
It's hard to describe how far
reaching that change is. It means
utterly first-class people in many
departments. The other change is
size. We were wonderfully small in
the old days. But you can't do
what Stanford has to do without
growing.
One change that is very rarely
commented on is that we did a
heroic amount of loafing in the old
days. Really. There was time.
There was time to talk endlessly
and to engage in all kinds of diver
sions, and outings, and sports and
so on. The young people today are
under vastly greater pressure.
Who is your favorite leader
and why?
Well, I guess my favorite leader
is Jean Monet. He had the idea
and developed the design for what

is now the European community.
After World War I, Jean Monet
had this vision of the united
Europe, and most people thought
he was just crazy.
Little by little, they built that
community. But over the years,
and it's quite a few years now, it
gained and gained and gained
strength and stability — all from
the vision of Jean Monet, the man
who realized that there were
diverse purposes but possibly
more important common pur
poses. And I admire him.
I think once in his life he held a
significant position. Mostly he
just worked outside the structure,
building through other people,
claiming no credit for himself. It's
admirable.
What was your most memo
rable experience as Secretary
of Health, Education and Wel
fare?
Oh, I think without any ques
tion, enforcing the Civil Rights
Act. That was the most dramatic,
