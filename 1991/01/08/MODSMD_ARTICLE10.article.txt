# U.S., NATO insist on Jan. 15 deadline
## Six Iraqi pilots said to have defected from Hussein's military machine 
### 
(AP) — The United States, Britain and
NATO insisted yesterday that Iraq must
heed the Jan. 15 deadline to withdraw from
Kuwait. President Saddam Hussein again
urged his nation to be ready for war, but
pilots manning six Iraqi helicopters were
reported to have defected.
The U.S. military command in Saudi
Arabia said four of the airmen flew their
craft to a base at KhaQi, just south of
Kuwait, and two others landed safely in the
Saudi desert in the first mqjor defections of
the gulf crisis from Saddam's military
machine.
Iraq quickly denied any defections. The
Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Nicosia,
quoted Information Minister Latif Nusayif
Jassim as saying, "What assures that this is
untrue is that there were no Iraqi (air)
exercises at all today."
An Arab diplomat in Baghdad said Sad
dam and PLO chairman Yasser Arafat had
asked a French lawmaker to help persuade
the United Nations to reconsider its resolu
tion authorizing the use of force to make
Iraq leave Kuwait after the deadline.
But in New York, U.N. spokesman Fran
cois Giuliani said the United Nations is con
sidering evacuating the families of U.N.
staff and non-essential U.N. personnel from
the Middle East under contingency plan
ning.
Arafat gave a speech last night in Bagh
dad saying Palestinians would fight with
Iraq if it came to war.
Oil prices rose nearly $3 per barrel to
$28 yesterday, and gold jumped $9.20 an
ounce to $394.60 as commodity traders
decided war was growing more likely and
began buying crude and gold as secure
investments.
Tariq Aziz, the Iraqi foreign minister,
said in an interview with CBS-TV on the
eve of his upcoming meeting with Secretary
of State James Baker 111 that Iraq would
not be out of Kuwait by Jan. 15.
"Now, the American administration is
threatening to go to war," he said in the
interview broadcast last night. "And this
means that our two nations are going to

fight each other. Our boys will kill each
other."
He urged Baker to come to their meeting
tomorrow in Geneva with some flexibility.
Baker, after meeting in London with
British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd,
rejected any extension of the deadline for
Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait.
"We should not talk about postponing
deadlines. This deadline is real. The only
real chanoe that we have for peace ... is if
Saddam Hussein begins to understand that
the deadline is real and that we are seri
ous," Baker said.
Asked to assess those chances, Baker
said "I am less optimistic that we might
achieve a peaceful solution than I was
before Christmas."
But, he said, "We are still going to work
toward that end."
Hurd said his two-hour session with
Baker confirmed that Britain and the
United States held "identical positions" on
demanding that Iraq withdraw from the
Persian Gulf emirate.
He said Saddam must realize "one
nation-state does not trample and wipe out
another nation-state."
"They must withdraw totally and com
pletely from Kuwait or they will be forced
out," Baker said of the Iraqis.
North Atlantic Treaty Organization sec
retary-general Manfred Woerner met with
Baker later yesterday and told reporters,
"Our member-countries remain in com
plete solidarity" in insisting on the libera
tion of Kuwait.
"There is not the slightest drift," said
Woerner.
Saddam, in a speech to senior military
aides yesterday that was broadcast to the
Iraqi people, warned there could be an all
out war if fighting breaks out between Iraq
and the U.S.-led multinational forces.
"The aggressors plan to make Iraq the
theater of operations, but when the battle is
launched Iraq will not be the only theater,"
Saddam said.
Saddam said Iraq was battling to liberate
Palestine.
