# Icy rain and snow wreak havoc around nation
## 
### 
(AP) â€” Freezing rain iced roadways
and closed schools in at least seven
states, while flooding left as many as
200 families homeless in Mississippi
and threatened communities in Ken
tucky and Indiana.
Snow, ice and fog shut roadways
and delayed transportation at airports
and train stations nationwide. A slick
road was blamed for an auto crash that
killed a 91-year-old woman near Port
land, Ore.
Treacherous travel conditions
caused numerous fender-benders and
closed schools in some parts of Wash
ington state, Illinois, Missouri, Missis

sippi, Maryland, Delaware and New
Jersey.
"We've got so many accidents we lit
erally can't keep track of them," Port
land police dispatcher Jan Strickland
said.
Hospitals across the country
treated scores of people for ii\juries
suffered in falls while trying to walk on
icy pavements. It got so bad in parts of
St. Louis that postal service to homes
and businesses was delayed several
days.
"Yes, we say neither rain nor snow
nor gloom of night will stop us, but no
one ever said anything about ice," said

postal service spokesman Richard
Watkins. "When you can't deliver the
mail without the aid of golf shoes then
you know it's treacherous."
In Spokane, Ore., parks and recre
ation officials closed and graveled a
popular sledding hill after paramedics
were called three times to treat injured
children.
"There were some spots where it
was just a sheet of ice," said Tom Hig
gins, a department maintenance fore
man. "They couldn't control their
sleds."
By mid-afternoon yesterday, the
storm that began Sunday night had

produced as much as 10 inches of snow
over parts of Maryland, and 6 inches
over areas of West Virginia and Vir
ginia.
Freezing snow and rain was scat
tered over much of the rest of the con
tinent. Morning temperatures dipped
to 36 below zero in Crane Lake, Ely
and International Falls, Minn.
In Philadelphia, commuter trains
and some flights to and from the Inter
national Airport were delayed.
The Baltimore-Washington Inter
national Airport was closed briefly
while runways and taxiways were
cleared of snow.
