# Cheney cancels A-12 plane

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Defense Secre
tary Dick Cheney announced yesterday
that he had canceled the Navy's A-12
stealth attack plane because of the contrac
tors' failure to meet requirements.
"The Navy action, terminating the con
tract for default, is based on the inability of
the contractors to design, develop, fabri
cate, assemble and test A-12 aircraft within
the contract schedule and to deliver an air
craft that meets contract requirements,"
the Pentagon said in a statement.
The planned 620 planes had been pro
jected to cost about $52 billion, with deploy
ment planned for 1995.

"This program cannot be sustained
unless I ask Congress for more money and
bail the contractors out. But I have made
the decision that I will not do that. No one
can tell me exactly how much more it will
cost to keep this program going. And I do
not believe a bailout is in the national inter
est," Cheney said in the statement.
The Pentagon said it will be considering
alternatives to the A-12 program but no
decisions have been made.
The contract with McDonnell Douglas
Corp. and General Dynamics Corp., signed
in January 1988, called for eight prototype
planes at a cost of no more than $4.8 billion.
