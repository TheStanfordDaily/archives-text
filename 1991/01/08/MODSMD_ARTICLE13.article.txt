# Soviets send paratroopers to Baltics

MOSCOW (AP) - The Defense
Ministry yesterday ordered thousands
of paratroopers into seven secessionist
republics to enforce conscription and
round up draft dodgers and deserters.
It said national security was at stake.
Latvia and Lithuania reacted
immediately by saying draft-age youth
would be encouraged to go into hiding.
Latvia said it was given until Friday to
comply with Soviet draft laws or face
military action. The third Baltic
republic, Estonia, said it had until

Sunday.
The seven republics targeted have
been among the most aggressive in
demanding autonomy, although all 15
republics say they want less control by
the Kremlin. Only Latvia and Estonia
mentioned being given specific dead
lines.
"Both (President Mikhail) Gor
bachev and the army are interested in
saving the empire," Estonian Prime
Minister Edgar Savisaar told the inde
pendent news agency Baltfax.

Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia have
expressed fear the Kremlin may use
force to repress their independence
drives. Lithuania declared indepen
dence March 11. All three states
enacted laws to let their young men do
alternative service, such as hospital or
social work, to serving in the national
military. The Kremlin rejects this.
Baltic officials said earlier at least
two divisions were expected in their
regions, and that a division normally
has 10,000 soldiers.
