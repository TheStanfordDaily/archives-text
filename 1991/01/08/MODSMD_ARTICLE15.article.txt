## Toward a modern ID 
### 
Finally, we are a big
STEP closer toward an iden
tification card of which
Stanford students can be proud.
A self-laminating student ID
card that boldly displays our school
colors and that will not rub off in
wallets is now in our possession —
thanks to the folks at the
Registrar's Office and elsewhere
involved in making the change.
So what's the big deal?
Well, in the evolutionary history
of ID cards, Stanford's was recent
ly still in the Stone Age. The paper
card in service until the end of last
quarter could not survive the
weathering of rain and wind, and
was, sadly, also easily reproduced
by Macintosh pros.
While it is still not up to par with
the plastic computerized ID cards
at other universities, the Stanford
ID card is moving in the right

direction toward one that can also
serve as a meal card, library card
and perhaps credit card at The
Bookstore.
From now on, the bar code on
the front of the new card will allow
us to check out books at the library
without having to fill out a slip for
every single book. The card's effi
ciency will make life much simpler.
Perhaps the University should
consider issuing only one ID card
per year instead of three. It will
save a lot of money in this season of
budget crunching, and is certainly
feasible — witness the meal cards
that all students on food service
possess, with pictures they all hate
but can't get rid of unless they lose
the cards on purpose.
Hopefully, the evolution toward
a universal picture ID card will
soon be completed.
