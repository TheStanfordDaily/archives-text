# Keeping Rush dry
## 
### 
An alcohol-free rush,
adopted by the Interfrater
nity Council for this spring,
is a great idea; it will remain little
more than that unless it is
embraced by the fraternities indi
vidually.
Making Rush dry improves the
way students choose fraternities
and the way fraternities choose
students.
It allows students to get to know
each other in parties which are
centered around activities other
than drinking.
Dry rush gives way to better
interaction among students,
removing a barrier that excludes
students who choose not to drink.
It makes drinking a non-issue in
the selection process.
The resolution brings Rush pol
icy in line with Stanford's alcohol
policy, since the great majority of
students rushing fraternities are

under 21.
The move also sends a positive
message to the University that the
IFC is committed to self-regulation
â€” an authority to direct and police
fraternal affairs.
In the words of IFC president
Eric Jorgensen, "We're showing
the University that we're taking
matters into our own hands, rather
than waiting until they step in."
Still, many are skeptical. Dry
rush, which has been the policy of
several Stanford fraternities in
recent years, has generally proved
to be at best humid, often moist,
and occasionally dripping, soaking
wet.
Whether Stanford's Greek sys
tem will have a dry Rush, or merely
a dry Rush polity, remains to be
seen. But an enthusiastic compli
ance by the fraternities would
speak volumes for the Greek sys
tem's integrity and intent.
