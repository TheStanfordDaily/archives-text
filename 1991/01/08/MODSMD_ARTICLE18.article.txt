# Jason Lewis
## The 						tell-tale omission 
### 
The following is a speech
given at the ASSU's State of the
Association last winter. Hopefully
you will forgive me for presenting a dated
document, but as I'm far, far away from
Stanford at the moment, it will have to
suffice.
More to the point, though some of the
incidents mentioned are a year old, the
themes guiding the speech, that multicul
turalism, though on its way, is still not a
reality on this campus, and that the
ASSU under the previous and current
Council of Presidents is a positive force
for the continued realization of such
change, remain current.
Hello, my name is Jason Lewis, and I
am the co-chair of the Stanford American
Indian Organization. To begin our part of
this State of the Association address, I
would like to commend the People Plat
form's Council of Presidents for the sim-
Ele, but very meaningful fact that I am
ere, as a representative of SAIO.
It reflects the commitment of the Peo
ple's Platform to inclusion, and their abil
ity to recognize that that is the essence of
multiculturalism. Their invitation was no
mere symbolism, but a concrete state
ment of dedication.
Thinking about the satisfaction we felt
at receiving the invitation to come speak,
we at SAIO were reminded of just this
last fall, when our people were excluded,
in a critical way, from the Stanford com
munity.
When the University Committee on
Minority Issues' Report on Staff was
released in November, Native American
staffers were left out. Though it was later

reissued, with those responses included,
that omission has left an indelible mark
on our minds.
It showed us that, sometimes, people,
even well-intentioned people, forget that
multiculturalism is not a question of
mere numbers, but a question of people.
We wish to remind them that it is lives
which are affected when alienation is
experienced in the classroom and the
workplace; it is not just another percent
age point dip in satisfaction. It is the abil
ity to function well, and thus feel satis
fled, which is impaired; it is not just a
drop in the performance curve that mat
ters.
This momentary blindness on the part
of the UCMI provided SAIO members
with a reminder to keep our eyes open to
the fact that the dream of multicultural
ism, while crystallizing around the edges,
still requires much more work.
To that end, in the next year, and the
ones following that, we will begin the pro
ject of bringing a tenure-track, Native
American scholar to this university as the
seed for an eventual Program in Native
American Studies.
We will work to continue the increase
in the number of offered classes dealing
with Native American history and cul
ture.
We will strive, through dorm outreach
and cultural programming such as the
Stanford Pow Wow, to further the student
body's knowledge of and interest in our
people.
And we will be wary of all tendencies to
reduce our successes, and our failures, to
mere numbers in a report.
To help us with all this, we will look to

the ASSU and the Council of Presidents.
Your support, as in the Senate Resolution
which supported our request that the
UCMI Staff Report be reissued with our
people's data included, has shown that
your vision of a multicultural Stanford
coincides with ours.
In closing, I would like to tell you
about a comment recently made by one of
our frosh, when asked about his Stanford
experience so far.
He said, "Well, to tell the truth, I'm
disappointed. | came to Stanford expect
ing that it would have a Native American
Studies program, seeing as how it was
such an important university and all. But
now that I'm here, and I see that it
doesn't, and I see that few people under
stand me and my culture, I can guarantee
that if things stay the same, I won't be
applying here for graduate school."
Our wish at SAIO is that he will be
applying here, and we believe that with
the continued, and intensified, help of the
COP and the ASSU and the staff and fac
ulty of this University, we can ensure that
he will do so — and that he won't become
just another dip in the curve.

Jason Lewis is amazed by the fact that the
Full Moon flames fully all over the world.
