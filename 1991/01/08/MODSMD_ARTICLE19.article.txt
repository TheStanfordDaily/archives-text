## We must question our own views before resorting to violence 
### 
I READ WITH INTEREST THE letter
by John Manning, and I welcome his
comment, "Simply ignoring factors
which undermine our arguments will not
make them go away. We all must sit back
and criticize and analyze our own views
before we act as individuals and as a
nation."
But our views are conditioned by the
prevailing culture and propaganda of the
experts and prevent us from objectively
examining issues such as war. The Gulf
crisis is only an instance of this phe
nomenon.
Let us examine human thinking that
is fundamentally the same throughout
the world. The culture in which we are
bom passes on to us its beliefs, its values
and a view of the world in which war is
accepted and conveniently and proudly
justified in the name of tribe, religion or
nationality.
Our self-centered minds think to pos
sess, exploit, achieve and divide. We iden
tify with our tribes, which give us secu
rity even at the expense of division and
chaos. We avoid the fundamental issues
and idealize equality and peace.
But peace amid chaos remains for
mankind to this day the most elusive
goal. Our goals and ideals contradict the
reality and create in our minds confusion

and conflict: At one end is superiority (as
a race or nation) and the other is equal
ity, brotherhood and sisterhood (the
ideal).
Then we invent the notion of hope
and optimism to fight conflict. Most of
us are told that in time we shall
approach our ideals; millennia has
elapsed, we as humans have still not
found a way to exist in peace.
Most of us accept all the turmoil as
part of our unchangeable existence; we
have given up and called it the human
nature; we have handed the matters to
the experts; we have devised every form
of sophistry to avoid facing our problems
and have gotten lost in our personal
pleasures and fantasies.
Some of us with strong beliefs know
everything already; we need not inquire
and ask any further questions. Some of
us cynically react and rally but yet
remain caught up in the pattern of
thought which is still grounded in "us
and them" feeling. So in all our
responses, we seek immediate and patch
work solutions without understanding
our biases and conditioned thinking.
War is an attempt at immediate solu
tion. A tribe may seem to win, but we as
humans always get defeated. Tethered to
the security of our tribe and too afraid to

love, we have created the most powerful
mechanisms of self-destruction.
If we truly loved ourselves as humans
not just as individuals, we would not
allow any human being to die in a war.
Though we have progressed technologi
cally, we remain primitive psychologi
cally. So, our progress is no progress at
all.
War does not stop or change the
enemy, whose thinking is like ours —
divisive and therefore violent. A mightier
force may temporarily subjugate a
weaker one, just as a stronger tusker
(fighter elephant) scares away a feebler
one, but a tusker remains a tusker.
There is no intelligence in it.
Society encourages comparison, suc
cess and aggression. The most aggressive
among us rise to become dictators. And
remember that dictator to one tribe is a
hero to another. A dictator may be killed
in a war, but that does not change the
nature of man — there are new dictators
with new visages waiting on the horizon
to seize their chance.
Manning comments that Iraq may
develop nuclear capability at a later time.
Can we stop all dictators from acquiring
nuclear arsenals? How many do we have
to stop before achieving peace? Keeping
in mind that we were the first to use the

nuclear bomb, what gives us the right to
decide who is authorized to own such
technology and who is not?
War creates further animosities which
last through generations. Killing is no
solution. We have had enough of it. The
diplomats have failed; the leaders have
failed to provide rational solutions.
All the ideals of the globe put together
have not been able to solve the human
crisis. There will be no solutions as long
as we are afraid to look, without the
shelter of our banal ideals, at ourselves
the way we actually are: selfish, greedy,
fearful and violent.
We observe the facts. We don't run
away from the facts. We observe all
facets of our thought. We must allow a
new thinking to emerge.
New thinking is needed lest history
will repeat itself and our globe shall
remain a perpetual battle ground.
There are no short-term solutions to
long-term human problems. Concerned
individuals must dispassionately ques
tion the dead past and discover for them
selves the new, with a flame of not mere
hope but that of intelligence and under
standing in their hearts. Small fires can
become blazes.
