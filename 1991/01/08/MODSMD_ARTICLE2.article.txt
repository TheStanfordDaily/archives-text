# No easy solutions to funding cuts
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
University budget planners
have yet to decide how they'll
respond to the latest blow dealt to
Stanford's finances by the contin
uing controversy over its indirect
cost policies.
Late last month, as part of an
effort to restore a working rela
tionship between Stanford and
the Navy, negotiating teams from
the two parties agreed to knock
Stanford's indirect cost rate down
two more points — to 72 percent
— for this fiscal year. The agree
ment will cost the University
another $2.5 million in lost rev
enue this year.
While more cuts to this year's
operating budget havg not been
ruled out, such talk is "prema
ture," University budget director
Tim Warner said yesterday.
Provost James Rosse and Warner
will tackle the issue in a meeting
later this week, and they hope to
reach a decision by the end of the
month, Warner said.
Of the $2.5 million in lost rev
enue, about $1.5 million will show
up as a shortfall in the Univer
sity's operating budget; the
remainder affects the Medical
School, the finances of which are
managed separately from Stan
ford's operating budget.

When Stanford officials ini
tially put together this year's
operating budget, they assumed
the University would have an
indirect cost rate of 78 percent.
That would mean that for every
dollar researchers here receive in
federal grants, the government
would reimburse Stanford an
additional 78 cents for indirect
costs of research. Indirect costs
are those costs of doing research,
such as electricity, maintenance
and administrative overhead, that
are not easily attributable to a
specific project.
But the Navy imposed a provi
sional rate of 74 percent on the
University when it began its
investigation of Stanford's indi
rect cost policies in the fall. Each
percentage-point drop costs the
University as a whole about $1.25
million and results in an operat
ing budget shortfall of $750,000.
In late November, Rosse
announced that the University
would speed up its "repositioning"
process and make some one-time
reductions in this year's operating
budget to compensate for an $8
million shortfall — part of which
had been caused by the drop from
78 percent to 74 percent.
Knocking the indirect cost rate
down to 72 percent will make it
even more difficult for the Univer
sity to avoid a deficit at year's end.
