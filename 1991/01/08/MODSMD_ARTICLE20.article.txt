# MEChA extends support to new student group
## 
### 
Throughout the 20-year history of
MEChA, Movimiento Estudiantil
Chicano de Aztldn, our organization has
strived to include the broadest majority
of Raza students on campuses across the
nation.

As originally stated in the organiza
tion's guidelines, Stanford MEChA con
tinues . .to support the betterment of
La Raza in its quest for self-determina
tion and equality, educationally, political
ly and culturally..."
By working with El Centro to rein
state the Stanford Literacy Improvement
Project, by campaigning to elect a Latino
to the East Palo Alto School Board and
by cooperating to produce El Dia de los
Muertos and La Gran Posada, Stanford
MEChA demonstrates the ongoing com
mitment of La Raza to accomplish these

goals.
In the tradition of actively working for
unity and progressive change in the
Latino community, we as a Latino stu
dent organization express our support
for the newly formed Latino Student
Association.
As an experienced Stanford student
organization, we feel that the LSA is a
reaffirmation of the commitment of Raza
everywhere to actively pursue cultural,
social, political and community issues.
We see this as an opportunity to collec-

tively express pride in our cultural her
itage and confront the issues that face La
Raza today.
We, as Stanford MEChA, look forward
to the prospect of unity and the pursuit
of a stronger Latino community on the
Stanford campus.
Strength in unity!
