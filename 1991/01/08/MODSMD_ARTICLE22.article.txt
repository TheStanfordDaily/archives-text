## Alexander Rawls U.S. should go to war to rid the Middle East of a brutal dictatorship 
### 
The reasons we should go
to war with Iraq have little to do
with our national interests. The
primary strategic interest at stake is an
uninterrupted flow of cheap oil, but we
could guarantee ourselves this by doing
what it is our moral duty to do in any
case: impose steep taxes on gas and oil so
that market prices will account the full
social costs of fossil fuel consumption.
The energy conservation and
decreased demand for gas and oil induced
by these taxes would leave OPEC in per
manent disarray World (i.e. pre-tax) oil
prices would fall to pittance a barrel for
ever.
If the tax revenues were given back to
the American people in other tax cuts,
then on average no one's purchasing
power would be reduced. (Any such
scheme should return tax revenues to the
same income groups that paid them, so
that the tax structure would not become
more regressive.)
The alternative is ever-increasing
demand for oil and ever-higher oil prices,
only instead of the revenue from these

higher prices being returned to us in
other tax cuts, the revenue will be going
to Arabia and to George Bush's friends in
Texas.
This is the black hole that Bush wants
to fight for. He has variously described
the reasons for war with Iraq as fighting
for U.S. jobs and for our "way of life".
Now comes the holiday report from the
Energy Department that the White
House has gutted all energy taxes and
other conservation measures from the
department's proposed new national
energy plan.
(We at Stanford can be proud that our
own Michael Boskin, the nation's chief
economic advisor, was high on the list of
so-called "conservatives" behind this lat
est subversion of the public interest. I
would like to know what these people
think they are conserving.)
But it does not matter how perverse
Bush's reasons for going to war are. So
long as we fight to destroy Saddam Hus
sein and the Iraqi military (instead of to
simply to force Iraq out of Kuwait) the
right reasons for going to war will

inevitably be served. In the aftermath of a
military victory, the only possible resolu
tion will be a demilitarized, internation
ally administered constitutional democ
racy.
The biggest beneficiaries would be the
Iraqis, who have been living under one of
the most brutal and arbitrary dictators
the world has seen. There are many rea
sons we do not want to go waging war
against every dictator. It is too expensive
in lives and money, and our history of per
verted motives opposes us.
But when a dictator forces the world to
deal with him, as Hussein has done by
invading Kuwait, we should glad for the
opportunity to rid one more region from
the scourge of dictatorship. Lives will be
lost, but many less now than later, and
there is a good chance we can do this
thing efficiently.
The Iraqi people would be fighting
against democratic control of their own
country. Chop off the dictatorial head,
offer the Iraqis their country back, and it
is hard to imagine what they would keep
fighting for. Kuwait?

We should glad for the
opportunity to rid one
more region from the
scourge of dictator
ship. Lives will be lost,
but many less now than
later.

Of course, if we keep insisting that we
are fighting for the vital interests of the
West then any war will become a war of
Arab pride. If such a war gets prolonged,
it might become messy indeed, but we
don't have to be that stupid.
After we are done with Iraq we might
even take up take up Hussein's sugges
tion and settle the Palestinian question at
the same time, and according to the same
principles: by creating demilitarized,

internationally administered constitu
tional democracies on the Left Bank and
the Gaza Strip.
Imagine, democracy in the Arab world,
with full political rights and separated
powers. I am sure Egypt would appreciate
the company. It is the allied dictatorships
that would be snookered; Syria and Saudi
Arabia in particular.
They would probably nix the whole
thing right now if they saw what it must
lead to. Already Syria is adamant that it
will not participate in more than pushing
Iraq from Kuwait. Let's turn this sucker
into a fait accompli before Hussein
smartens up and backs down.
Not to sound like a warmonger, but it
will also be a travesty if we don't take a
few thousand troops this week and finally
squash this Duvalierist bug in Haiti. On
Sunday the sickest bunch of neighbor
hood criminals in the western hemisphere
kicked democracy in the spine for the nth
time in that poor beaten little purgatory.
