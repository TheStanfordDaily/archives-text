It promised to be the ultimate
road trip.
In 1964, novelist Ken Kesey
set off from La Honda, California
in a Day-Glo-painted 1939 Har
vester school bus with his band
of Merry Pranksters, gallons of
acid-spiked Kool-Aid, and
enough film equipment to record
the whole journey.
The final destination was the
New York's World Fair, but
Kesey and his gang were preoc
cupied more with the act of trip
ping than with the time they
made on the road. At the steering
wheel sat Neal Cassady — the
model for Dean Moriarty in Jack
Kerouac's "On the Road" and a
personal bridge between Beat
and hippie generations.
The presence of Cassady and
Kesey lent the trip its historic
overtones: these wayfarers were
not simply a bunch of overgrown
adolescents. Kesey had recently
been feted by the intelligentsia
for "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest" and promised to be a lead
ing voice of the country's youth.
So what was this established
writer doing, with his jugs of
electric Kool-Aid and his Day-Glo
bus? And why did he masquerade
as a revolutionary soldier, wear
ing an American flag and playing
a flute from the turret of the
bus?
By the end of the '60s, Kesey's
hippy-drippy clowning would be
pass 6. But in 1964 his bus-trip
set an early precedent for the
free-wheeling attitudes of the
counterculture. His band of
clean-cut youngsters — many of
them loosely affiliated with Stan
ford University — were probing
their minds when the Beatles
were singing about holding
hands.
Even so, their energies were
not directed against the Estab
lishment per se. They were inter
ested in consciousness-raising,
not draft-resisting. Kesey may
have worn a flag on top of his
head, but he didn't burn it.
In Paul Perry's "On the Bus"
and Kesey's own "The Further
Inquiry," the legacy of the bus
trip is reassessed with a forgiving
eye. The two books are packaged
luxuriously, with hundreds of
photographs that scrupulously
document the wanderings of
Kesey's gang across the States.
Both Perry and Kesey focus
on the figure of Cassady, whose

motor-mouth and explosive
antics reflected the spirit of the
bus.
In Kesey's book, a screenplay
written in 1978 that was fortu
nately never produced, Cassady's
ghost is put on trial and held
accountable for the grievances of
the Establishment (with a capi
tal 'E'). As Merry Pranksters and
innumerable stooges are brought
before the court, a projector re
screens the adventures of the
road-trip.
Kesey's Christmas package
fails on almost every conceivable
level: the dialogue is stilted, the
plot is unwieldy, the characters
are carelessly sketched. Even
Kesey's trademark style —
sinewy but delicate, athletic but
graceful — often descends
unknowingly into camp.
Worst of all, for a book that
promises mind-expansion, "The
Further Inquiry" is horribly pre
dictable. Figures of the Estab
lishment — the doctor who
warns of the possibility of acid
burn-out, the stocky lawyer who
prosecutes Cassady — are straw
men who are propped up only so
they can be ripped to pieces.
"On the Bus" is the more
even-handed and insightful of
the two, although its mouthful

of-a-subtitle gives away its bias:
"The Complete Guide to the Leg
endary Trip of Ken Kesey and
the Merry Pranksters and the
Birth of the Counterculture."
Along with running commen
tary by Ken Babbs, the Merry
Prankster whose wanderlust
earned him the nickname "The
Intrepid Traveler," Perry chroni
cles the rise of the countercul
ture in terms of the diffusion of
LSD. His historical method, as
such, is ragged around the edges:
the widespread use of LSD may
have invigorated the youth
movement, but it was not its sole
cause or effect.
"On the Bus" is saved by its
reliance on oral histories deliv
ered by figures such as Kesey,
poet Allen Ginsberg, and drug
guru Timothy Leary. Perry's
book allows these intrepid travel
ers to talk freely about their
experiences — and to disagree
among themselves.
Often, the results are embar
rassing to the speakers. Here
Babbs soliloquizes on the nature
of America: "Anybody can do this
stuff, you just have to have the
freedom to do it however you
want. America really represents
freedom."
Has Babbs forgotten that the

bus-trip was completely funded
by Kesey's book royalties, or that
the Pranksters dressed cleanly
and cut their hair to avoid upset
ting people? Or that the
Pranksters were booted from the
premises of a segregated beach in
the South?
All roads may have seemed
open to the Merry Pranksters, a
group of clean-cut, white, col
lege-educated, middle-class
youths. But sooner or later the
Pranksters had to address a
larger audience — and for these
less-privileged souls, Kesey's
message rang hollow. The
Pranksters prided themselves on
their saturation of the senses:
more colors, more drugs, more
music. But for a family taking
shelter in a dilapidated lean-to,
the Day-Glo bus could only seem
extravagant.
Twenty-five years after the
bus-trip, in the fall-out of the
Reagan era, "The Further
Inquiry" and "On the Bus"
strike a naive pose: "What more
could you want, with plenty of
acid and plenty of friends?"
Both books preach to the con
verted in nostalgic, trance-like
tones. The '60s become the
source of modern myth, with the
bus as a souped-up stagecoach

and with Neal Cassady as its
inspired driver.
At least "On the Bus" con
cludes on an ambivalent note,
with a postscript that investi
gates the death of Cassady.
Kesey once eulogized him as
'the father of us all', but Cassady
was not the sort of dad who cra
dled his child in his arms. He
died as he lived —drunk,
exhausted, not far from the rail
road tracks. In Mexico in 1968,
he was walking to a friend's
house when he decided to rest
awhile in the bushes beside the
tracks. He never got up.
If Cassady's spirit deserves
further inquiry, as Kesey sug
gests, then he should be remem
bered faithfully: as an absent
father who lived and died on the
road. He was not an unadulter
ated hero, though he was cer
tainly an American type. Unfor
tunately, his name is still being
bandied around by American
story-tellers like Kesey and
Perry, who confuse myth-making
with truth-telling, yarn-spinning
with the matter of fact.
