Grad school. Face it. You may
want to, or even have to go there
some day. Even though Stanford
is one hell of a country club, it still
only has four years of member
ship. And one way to recover its
hefty cover charge would be to
qualify yourself with a graduate
school degree.
The guide to law school looks at
56 of the premier law programs in
the nation, while the business
school guide covers 57 of the best
MBA programs.
The authors have given each
university a report card, based on
several criteria, each of which in
turn takes into account a few fac
tors.
The Admissions section has the
number of applicants, the number
accepted, and the mean GPA and
test scores. The other criterion
are academics, physical environ
ment, student enrollment, place
ment, finances, student life and
prominent alumnae.
The report card has a rating
system for admissions (selectiv
ity), placement (reputation) as
well as student life. These provide
an objective basis for comparison.
There are also more detailed
accounts about the physical envi
ronment, finances, academics stu
dent life and placement. The
application process for each uni
versity is also described, as well as
including some tips about under
graduate education that would
improve your chances for admis
sion.
For example, for Harvard Law
School, it is suggested that stu
dents balance out their curricu
lum, and that hard science mcgors
take some social science classes.
There is also an Insider Infor
mation section that could contain
just about anything, from the
dynamism of a particular admis
sions officer, to first-hand
accounts of an amazingly diverse
student body.
The two books were compiled
after interviews with over 1,000
students, professors, admissions
officers and recruiters, and these
accounts help provide useful
information about the various
programs.
