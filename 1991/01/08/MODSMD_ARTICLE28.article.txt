## Spikers begin season They face Cal 
### Tyson Vaughan Editorial staff 
Just when you thought
you could sneak into Burn
ham Pavilion without run
ning the risk of being
blasted by a Kristin Klein
spike, her brother Jimmy
nearly takes your head off.
Yes, the women have
passed the baton to the
men, and coach Ruben
Nieves will get the first
view of his troops in action
tonight at 7:30 p.m. in
Burnham against Califor
nia.
The Golden Bears are an
appropriate opponent for a
season opening match.-
They have been one of the
top two or three club teams
in the nation for the past
several years.

'Klein really
adds something
to our team that
we need.'
— Ruben Nieves

So, although Stanford ib
expected to handle them,
they should provide enough
competition to bring out
the Cardinal's strengths
and weaknesses.
"This is our first match
without (Ail-American mid
dle blocker) Dan Hanan,
(middle blocker) Craig
Forsythe and (All-Pac-10
setter) Parker Blackman,"
said Nieves.
"They played a lot of vol
leyball for us through the
years. ... This gives us a
chance to look at our new
team and get a match under
our belt against a very good
opponent."
Nieves, who took over
from head coach Fred
Sturm when Sturm took a
leave of absence to become
the U.S. Olympic head
coach, will face the difficult
task of replacing three key
starters.
Difficult because the
team is so laden with talent.
At setter, sophomore
Jimmy Blackman and
freshman Canyon Ceman
are expected to battle it out
for the starting spot.
Ceman, incidentally, was
a top setting recruit from
Mira Costa liigh, just like
freshman Piper Hahn of
the women's team.
But senior and longtime
reserve Ryan O'Hara has
the most collegiate experi
ence and has been steady
and effective in the past.
Stanford's three top
middle blockers will be
Mike Lowe, John Bezmali
novic and John Hribar. All
three have the talent to
start.
Later in the season,
these gentlemen will be
joined by basketball star
Adam Keefe, who many
have said could be the best
player volleyball has ever
seen if he would just stick
to it.
The Cardinal's outside
hitters are the only area
where the starters are
pretty much set.
Bob Hillman, Dave Goss
and Duncan Blackman
(brother of Parker, no rela
tion to Jimmy) will anchor
Stanford's offense. Goss
may not play tonight, how
ever, due to a minor injury.
If Goss does not play
tonight, he will probably be
replaced by Jimmy Klein,
who is also a safety on the
football team.
"Klein has done a real
good job," said Nieves.
"He's a hard worker and
very aggressive. I think he
really adds something to
our team that we need, with
his spirited and aggressive
attitude."
You can tell that Nieves
has probably been pelted by
one or two of Klein's spikes
in practice.
