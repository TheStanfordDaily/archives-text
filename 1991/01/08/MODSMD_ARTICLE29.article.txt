# Two wrestlers capture titles over break
## 
### 
Despite what the major net
works might have you believe,
winter break is not just a time for
football and basketball. Just ask
any member of Stanford's
wrestling team, which competed
in two mtgor tournaments within
the last couple of weeks. Even an
assistant coach got into the
action.
Eight grapplers were sent to
the Sunshine Open in 1991's
Superbowl City, Tampa Bay, Fla.
on Dec. 29-30. The squad placed
fifth out of 36 teams and captured
one individual title. On Jan. 4-5, a
group of 16 traveled to the Doc
Petersen Open at Chico State,
which scored individuals only, and
one of those 16 claimed a title.
At the Sunshine Open, there
were about 60 entrants per weight
class. Several Cardinal wrestlers
placed near the top of their class,
most notably team leader Steve
Buddie in the 167-pound division.
Buddie won six consecutive bouts,
including an 8-7 decision over
Bryan Flint of UT-Chatanooga in
the championship.
Senior Steve Yarbrough (177
pounds) looked like he might
duplicate his teammate's perfor
mance, but he fell short in the
finals after winning five in a row.
UT-Chatanooga's Brett Gustafson
defeated him 10-5.
James Dinette placed sixth in
the 142-pound division. Lance
Johnson (134 pounds) missed the

top-six rankng by one bout.
While these folks were sweat
ing it out in the mats of Tampa,
asst. coach David Lee, who gradu
ated from Stanford last year, was
exerting some of his own energy
at Northwestern University's
"Midlands" tournament.
Lee's career in cardinal and
white was an illustrious one. Two
time Pacific 10 Conference cham
pion. Three-time All-American.
1989 NCAA Champion.
At the Midlands, he defeated
collegiate rival Dan St. John (a
former Sun Devil), 5-2, to win the
tournament's 167-pound title. St.
John had defeated Buddie in last
year's NCAA tournament.
At the Doc Petersen Open,
Yarbrough this time managed to
bring home a tournament title.
He beat Dave Myers of Wyoming,
4-2, to take his sixth victory and
the tourney championship.
Buddie was predicted to repeat
his winning ways, having been
seeded No. 1, but an elbow injury
forced him to withdraw after two
victorious matches.
Dinette placed third and John
son captured sixth in their respec
tive weight classes. Mark Graham
had to settle for fourth in the 190-
pound division after coming up on
the short end of a 10-9 decision in
the semi-finals.
Tomorrow the wrestlers will
face Oregon at 7:30 p.m. in Burn
ham Pavilion.
