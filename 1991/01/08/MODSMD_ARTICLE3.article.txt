# '20/20' eyes Stanford indirect-cost dispute
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
The indirect cost controversy at Stanford
has caught the eye of "20/20."
Bill Willson, a producer from the ABC
weekly TV news magazine, said yesterday that
a segment on Stanford's indirect cost policies,
which are the subject of three ongoing federal
investigations, would likely air sometime late
next month.
Willson, who is based in New York, made an
initial visit to Stanford in mid-November to
talk with administrators here. Upon leaving,
he indicated that he had not yet decided
whether to proceed with the story.
But yesterday Willson said "20/20" was
"committed to the story" and had assigned cor
respondent Stone Phillips to the piece.
A "20/20" production team spent several
days on campus late last month shooting
footage of Stanford and of researcher's labs.
Willson said he had hoped to interview Stan
ford administrators during the same trip. But
Stanford officials refused, saying they had not
been given enough advance notice, and offered
to make a spokesman available for an inter
view later this month.
The two parties are currently trying to
agree on a date and who the Stan
ford spokesman will be. Willson
said "20/20" would like to inter
view both University President
Donald Kennedy and Controller
Frank Riddle on camera.
Stanford has not yet decided
who it will make available as a
spokesman, according to Rich
Kurovsky, director of University
relations. The University has not
ruled out granting "20/20" an

interview with Kennedy,
Kurovsky added.
If an interview is granted, it
will probably be filmed during the
week of Jan. 22, both parties said
yesterday.
"20/20" has also requested
interviews with Adm. William
Miller, the chief of naval research,
and Paul Biddle, the campus rep
resentative from the Office of
Naval Research. The ONR is the
federal agency that represents the
government in negotiations on
Stanford's indirect cost rate. Alle
gations made by Biddle have
prompted the federal investiga

tions.
The "20/20" segment may also
include an interview with Rep.
John Dingell, D-Mich., who is the
chair of the House Subcommittee
on Oversight and Investigations
— one of the federal agencies
investigating Stanford. An aide to
Dingell declined to comment on
whether or not Dingell had
accepted an invitation for an
interview.
Dingell'B subcommittee is
expected to hold hearings on
Stanford's indirect cost policies in
late February or early March.
