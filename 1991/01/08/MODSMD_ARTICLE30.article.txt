# The 						true national champion is revealed
## 
### 
When you live in a town with a popu
lation of 2736 (including dogs, cats
and assorted farm animals) and the
nightlife consists of watching the town's
only stoplight change colors, you learn
pretty quickly that excitement comes about
once a year. Maybe.
Since there usually isn't a heck of a lot
going on, you have to look anywhere you
can for entertainment. There's the occa
sional day-long Nintendo-fest, hockey
games when the lake freezes over (or when
a parking lot gets really slick), high school
hoops games and long, drawn-out, winner
is-the-last-one-breathing snowball fights.
And there's always stoplight-watching, but
even that gets predictable after a few hours.
Every now and then, though, the
extraordinary happens. It's usually nothing
more than the occasional car smashing into
the occasional Amish horse-and-buggy, but
at least it's a change. Real, revolutionary
change, however, comes to town only once
every 25 years or so. A few decades ago the
town got that stoplight. In the '70s we got a
new elementary school.
And last summer — after years of wait
ing, hoping and dreaming — we got cable.
Say what you will, cable TV is the only
invention that has the power to take nor
mally intelligent young adults and turn
them into sacks of useless protoplasm, and
that has to be worth something. It's also an
excuse to spend three straight weeks lying
on the couch, but you have to be careful: If
you stay there too long you may need to be
surgically removed from the couch. It's
happened. Trust me.
You may think three weeks in a TV
induced coma is a waste of time, but it

really isn't. After all, the couch was a great
vantage point for watching all the sports
goings-on during break. There were bowl
games galore (some of them not completely
worthless or boring), non-conference bas
ketball games between powerhouses and
creampuffs (wheee!) and, needless to say, a
two-headed mythical national football
champion instead of the normal brainless,
oops, I mean one-headed one.
Shoot, it was almost too much for all us
folks to handle.
First, there were all those bowl games.
In case New Year's Day seemed like a
blur to you, I did a little counting:
There were 26 games (give or take) on Jan.
1. The average score of each was approxi
mately 274-1. And, just to show how intelli
gent college football polls are, the No. 4
team in the country (Miami) beat the No. 3
team (Texas) by 43 points. (That's the real
number, by the way.) Should that happen?
Probably not, but ridiculous things just
seem to pop up every now and then in col
lege football. Take the Copper Bowl, for
example. The bowl, held in Tucson, Ariz.,
took a lot of heat because of the Arizona
vote against a Martin Luther King, Jr. holi
day. Bowl officials tried to control the dam
age by saying that they really were progres
sive — after all, the city of Tucson does
indeed honor King's birthday. The right
wing problem wasn't theirs, the officials
insisted. It was the rest of the state that was
conservative/backward.
Fine. The Copper Bowl was run by lib
eral, freedom-loving progressive men and
women. So who did they run out and get to
be the bowl's sponsor?

Domino's.
Now, I'm no political genius — I voted
for E.T. for President — but it seems to me
that if you're trying to shed a conservative
image, the last thing you'd want to do is
take a bunch of cash from a company that
actively supports right-to-life groups. (Call
me crazy.) What's next? The Jesse Helms
Bowl?
A nyway, that was way down the ridicu
/\ lous meter compared to what hap-
JL JLpened with the national shampi
onship. One poll says Colorado is No. 1. The
other says Georgia Tech, which played
exactly zero of the teams ranked in the top
15 at the end of the year. Based on that
alone, it seems like Colorado should have
been the clear choice, except for one minor
problem: The Associated Press poll, which
picked Colorado, is voted on by
sports writers.
Does this seem just a little like kinder
garteners voting for President?
What we're left witi. is one champion
picked by semi-adolescents and another
that didn't play a single good team all year.
Yeah, sure, Tech beat Virginia when the

Cavaliers were ranked No. 1, but Virginia
turned out to be so good they lost four of
their last five.
And Nebraska, which got shredded by
Tech on New Year's Day? The Huskers had
a schedule that would have embarrassed
Chico State. And they lost to the three half
decent teams they played (Tech, Colorado
and Oklahoma) by an average of 25 points.
Some choice. And besides, who says only
the AP and UPI polls matter? CNN has a
poll of its own. The New York Times lets its
computer do the talking. So, since no one
can seem to figure out who's No. 1, I've
decided to institute the Macky poll: Stan
ford's No. 1. In everything.
Our football team played a schedule that
was infinitely tougher than Tech's, and we
beat Notre Dame by more than Colorado
did. The Buffaloes did beat Stanford in the
first week of the season, but hey: home
field advantage. On a neutral field, the Car
dinal wins.
A lot of people have said a split national
championship is great because it stirs a lot
of debate. Swell. If adults in this country
don't have anything a little more pressing
to argue about, we're in deeeeeeep trouble.
There is one msyor question brought up
by all this, of course:
Who the hell cares? It's basketball sea
son.

Cameron "Air" Macky got a pair of glasses
and a book titled "How to Shoot a Basket
ball" for Christmas, but you probably still
wouldn't want him at the free-throw line in
the closing seconds (or any of the other sec
onds) of a game.

When you live in a town with a popu
lation of 2736 (including dogs, cats
and assorted farm animals) and the
nightlife consists of watching the town's
only stoplight change colors, you learn
pretty quickly that excitement comes about
once a year. Maybe.
Since there usually isn't a heck of a lot
going on, you have to look anywhere you
can for entertainment. There's the occa
sional day-long Nintendo-fest, hockey
games when the lake freezes over (or when
a parking lot gets really slick), high school
hoops games and long, drawn-out, winner
is-the-last-one-breathing snowball fights.
And there's always stoplight-watching, but
even that gets predictable after a few hours.
Every now and then, though, the
extraordinary happens. It's usually nothing
more than the occasional car smashing into
the occasional Amish horse-and-buggy, but
at least it's a change. Real, revolutionary
change, however, comes to town only once
every 25 years or so. A few decades ago the
town got that stoplight. In the '70s we got a
new elementary school.
And last summer — after years of wait
ing, hoping and dreaming — we got cable.
Say what you will, cable TV is the only
invention that has the power to take nor
mally intelligent young adults and turn
them into sacks of useless protoplasm, and
that has to be worth something. It's also an
excuse to spend three straight weeks lying
on the couch, but you have to be careful: If
you stay there too long you may need to be
surgically removed from the couch. It's
happened. Trust me.
You may think three weeks in a TV
induced coma is a waste of time, but it

really isn't. After all, the couch was a great
vantage point for watching all the sports
goings-on during break. There were bowl
games galore (some of them not completely
worthless or boring), non-conference bas
ketball games between powerhouses and
creampuffs (wheee!) and, needless to say, a
two-headed mythical national football
champion instead of the normal brainless,
oops, I mean one-headed one.
Shoot, it was almost too much for all us
folks to handle.
First, there were all those bowl games.
In case New Year's Day seemed like a
blur to you, I did a little counting:
There were 26 games (give or take) on Jan.
1. The average score of each was approxi
mately 274-1. And, just to show how intelli
gent college football polls are, the No. 4
team in the country (Miami) beat the No. 3
team (Texas) by 43 points. (That's the real
number, by the way.) Should that happen?
Probably not, but ridiculous things just
seem to pop up every now and then in col
lege football. Take the Copper Bowl, for
example. The bowl, held in Tucson, Ariz.,
took a lot of heat because of the Arizona
vote against a Martin Luther King, Jr. holi
day. Bowl officials tried to control the dam
age by saying that they really were progres
sive — after all, the city of Tucson does
indeed honor King's birthday. The right
wing problem wasn't theirs, the officials
insisted. It was the rest of the state that was
conservative/backward.
Fine. The Copper Bowl was run by lib
eral, freedom-loving progressive men and
women. So who did they run out and get to
be the bowl's sponsor?

Domino's.
Now, I'm no political genius — I voted
for E.T. for President — but it seems to me
that if you're trying to shed a conservative
image, the last thing you'd want to do is
take a bunch of cash from a company that
actively supports right-to-life groups. (Call
me crazy.) What's next? The Jesse Helms
Bowl?
A nyway, that was way down the ridicu
/\ lous meter compared to what hap-
JL JLpened with the national shampi
onship. One poll says Colorado is No. 1. The
other says Georgia Tech, which played
exactly zero of the teams ranked in the top
15 at the end of the year. Based on that
alone, it seems like Colorado should have
been the clear choice, except for one minor
problem: The Associated Press poll, which
picked Colorado, is voted on by
sports writers.
Does this seem just a little like kinder
garteners voting for President?
What we're left witi. is one champion
picked by semi-adolescents and another
that didn't play a single good team all year.
Yeah, sure, Tech beat Virginia when the

Cavaliers were ranked No. 1, but Virginia
turned out to be so good they lost four of
their last five.
And Nebraska, which got shredded by
Tech on New Year's Day? The Huskers had
a schedule that would have embarrassed
Chico State. And they lost to the three half
decent teams they played (Tech, Colorado
and Oklahoma) by an average of 25 points.
Some choice. And besides, who says only
the AP and UPI polls matter? CNN has a
poll of its own. The New York Times lets its
computer do the talking. So, since no one
can seem to figure out who's No. 1, I've
decided to institute the Macky poll: Stan
ford's No. 1. In everything.
Our football team played a schedule that
was infinitely tougher than Tech's, and we
beat Notre Dame by more than Colorado
did. The Buffaloes did beat Stanford in the
first week of the season, but hey: home
field advantage. On a neutral field, the Car
dinal wins.
A lot of people have said a split national
championship is great because it stirs a lot
of debate. Swell. If adults in this country
don't have anything a little more pressing
to argue about, we're in deeeeeeep trouble.
There is one msyor question brought up
by all this, of course:
Who the hell cares? It's basketball sea
son.

Cameron "Air" Macky got a pair of glasses
and a book titled "How to Shoot a Basket
ball" for Christmas, but you probably still
wouldn't want him at the free-throw line in
the closing seconds (or any of the other sec
onds) of a game.
