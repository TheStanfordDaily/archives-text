# Lack of competition disappoints junior netter
## O'Brien dominates Fiesta Bowl opponents 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
Perhaps the ghost of Martin
Luther King decided that Arizona
would be the site of lopsided ath
letics this holiday season. Like
Louisville after him, Alex O'Brien
had little trouble in this year's
Fiesta Bowl. The junior from
Texas took the championship of
the smaller bowl with a convinc
ing 6-1, 6-0 romp over Kip Brady
in the finals.
The football game is better
known, but local organizers also
use the famous moniker to bring
in tennis talent to the area for a
pre-New Year's tournament. This
year the people in charge followed
their namesake too closely and
also managed to produce an un
exciting contest. For both the Car
dinals and a certain Cardinal All-
American, the competition was
far from intense.
"I liked Arizona, but it was a
pretty boring tournament,"
O'Brien said. "I'd like to say
something interesting, but I can't
think of anything to make it
sound exciting."
At least he got a nice vacation.
Played at the Princess Resort in
Scottsdale, the Fiesta Bowl brings
in a draw of 128 players that con
sists of juniors, college players,
and teaching professionals.
O'Brien had played in the more
competitive Cotton Bowl for the
last two years, but his family con
templated a trip to Arizona after

Christmas, and the Fiesta Bowl fit
nicely into the plans.
"It was part of a family trip,"
O'Brien said. "I had a fun time (on
the trip), but the tournament was
kind of a let-down."
The structure of the tourna
ment had the players playing 12-
game "pro-sets." Because of two
days of rain, O'Brien was forced to
play three such matches in one
day. The last proved to be his clos
est call of the trip. At 4-4 with
ASU's Danny Marting, O'Brien
was down 15-40, but managed to
rally back for the game and the
match, 12-6.
"I was able to swing the
momentum," O'Brien said. "The
next game I broke his serve and
took control of the match."
From there things only got eas
ier. The semi-finals saw the Amar
illo native winning 12-7, and the
final's only real excitement came
when Brady was able to break
serve in the first game.
"I was a little worried because I
had served really well and he was
hitting good returns," O'Brien
said. "He got frustrated later, and
that's when I took over."
The competition may not have
been that fierce, but the trip
proved to be both fun and useful.
"It was good just to play some
matches," O'Brien said. "There
are not many people to play with
in Amarillo."
This year's Fiesta Bowl proved
that Scottsdale isn't much of a
test either.

Alex O'Brien, an experienced tournament winner, did not encounter too much opposition on the way to
his latest victory. But that's okay; he was on a family vacation in Arizona while rolling to an easy title in
the Fiesta Bowl tourney.
