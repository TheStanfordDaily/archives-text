State supreme court
to review drug testing
The California Supreme Court decided
last month to hear an appeal by the NCAA of
a lower court ruling that its drug testing pro
gram violated Stanford students' rights to
privacy.
Until the Supreme Court hears the case,
the lower court ruling will stand and drug
testing will not be required of Stanford ath
letes.
The lower court's ruling was upheld in
September by the State Court of Appeals.
The appellate justices held that "the evi
dence does not support the NCAA's claim
that there is significant drug use among stu
dent-athletes" and that "the evidence
showed that the test program was too broad,
and its accuracy doubtful."

Three Stanford athletes brought the suit
against the NCAA in 1987. The University
joined the suit when the NCAA insisted that
it enforce the drug-testing program despite
the lower court ruling.
No date has been set for the hearing on
the case.
Pease to face charges
James Pease, arrested for several break
ins at campus residences last spring and
summer, will face a preliminary hearing Jan.
16 before the Palo Alto Municipal Court.
Pease, the son of Electrical Engineering
Prof. R. Fabian Pease, will be tried on three
counts of first-degree burglary and one
count each of resisting arrest and possession
of stolen property.
The suspect, 21, was chased Aug. 6 by a
Palo Alto police officer and arrested for three

burglaries that night and early morning.
Teller wins peace prize
Edward Teller, a senior research fellow at
the Hoover Institution, has been awarded
the first Sicilian Regional Science Peace
Prize from Italy's Centro di Cultura Scien
tifica Ettore Majorana.
Teller will share the prize with Victor
Weiskopf, a Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology physicist, and will receive $300,000.
He received the peace award for his "out
standing contributions to promote science
without secrecy."
Teller has been dubbed the "father of the
hydrogen bomb" for his work on the H-bomh
project in the 1950s and served as the
director of the Lawrence Livermore Labora
tory before joining Hoover.
