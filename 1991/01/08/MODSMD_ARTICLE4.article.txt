# Student Resources faces restructuring
## 
### Cecilia Tom Editorial staff 
The Office of Student Resources may
soon undergo a mcyor structural overhaul
intended to smooth working relationships
among different student services.
The proposal, which Acting Vice Presi
dent Sally Mahoney is currently finalizing,
would eliminate the Office of Residential
Affairs and move the Office of Residential
Education, now under the jurisdiction of
the-Dean of Student Affairs, to another net
work of offices collectively called "academic
services."
The Housing Center, currently under
Residential Affairs, would be run by an
administrative unit within Mahoney's
office. She said this change would not alter
the center's functions significantly; the
center merely executes the policies set forth
by Res Ed.
Mahoney is also proposing the grouping
of Undergraduate Advising Center, the
Career Planning and Placement Center and
Res Ed, which would tentatively be
renamed Undergraduate Residential Pro
grams.
Mahoney said the new group — "educa
tional services" — would create smoother
working relationships among these offices,
replacing cumbersome committee meetings
with staff meetings.
Students may find the change helpful,
she said, citing undergraduate orientation
as an example. Since freshmen advising is
dorm-based, student planners could easily
organize programs by consulting people
within a single organization.
Robin Hensley, acting director of Res Ed,
said she approves of the proposal because it
presents an opportunity "to improve our
relationships with different areas." How
ever, she declined to comment on the possi
bility of layoffs in her office resulting from
reorganization.
In addition, under the proposed changes,
Cowell Student Health Center would report
directly to the vice president rather than to
Student Affairs. Acting Director Harvey
Weinstein said he welcomes the change,
adding that Cowell would continue to work
with other student services.

"It's very important for Cowell to have
input at the vice president level" because
health is a campus and national con
cern, he said.
With these changes, the role of the dean
of Student Affairs would have to be rede
fined, Mahoney said. Norm Robinson is
currently the acting dean, having assumed
James Lyons' position after he retired last
June. Mahoney said faculty and students
will have opportunities for input in the
search for the new dean.
Robinson said the rationale behind the
reorganization, which would reduce the
scope of authority of Student Affairs, is to
"provide the most effective range of ser
vices possible in the most efficient way."
Michael Jackson, associate dean of Stu
dent Affairs and head of Campus Affairs,
declined to speculate on his position in the
proposed organization but welcomed the
prospect of "new possibilities."
With the reorganization, Campus Affairs
would also oversee religious affairs. How
ever, Dean of the Chapel Robert Gregg
would still report directly to the president,
because Memorial Church has a much
larger constituency than just students,
Malioney explained.
She added that the move is important
because religion, like minority affairs, is
part of the diversity at Stanford and
deserves a voice in Campus Affairs.
The Bechtel International Center came
under the auspices of Campus Affairs this
fall for the same reason, Mahoney said.
Center director John Pearson said it is now
easier to deal with diversity than in the
past, when he reported to the dean of Grad
uate Studies.
Jackson "has been very supportive and
challenges us to look at multiculturalism,"
he added.
Besides redefining Student Affairs,
Mahoney proposes to consolidate the
administration of financial aid, graduate
financial awards and the Bursar's Office
into one collective entity called "financial
services," which would report to her.
The Bursar's Office currently reports to
the Controller's Office.
Graduate awards used to be adminis
tered by Graduate Administrative Services,
but Mahoney said she plans to fully decen
tralize both this function and graduate
admissions, allowing the different graduate
schools to develop their own programs.
Since the beginning of fall quarter, the
School of Education has already assumed
these functions, and a similar pilot pro
gram is being tried in the School of Engi
neering, Mahoney said.
Financial services would only assume
the functions of graduate awards that
require centralized coordination, she
added. Mahoney expects the decentraliza
tion efforts to be completed in all schools by
the 1991-92 admissions cycle, she said.
Mahoney said a single office for financial
services would prevent students from being
treated like yo-yos, sent back and forth
between the Financial Aids Office and the
Bursar's Office to have their problems
solved.
Bursar Jon Erickson, however, is uncon
vinced about the advantages of Mahoney's
plan. He said the proposal, which is mod
eled after the financial services at the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania, would not neces
sarily provide "net increases" in student
services.
Erickson said that although consolida
tion of offices may improve coordination,
"coordination does not depend on organiza
tion." He said his office and the Financial
Aids Office are currently maintaining
active communication.
He added that a single office may seem
to provide "one-stop" shopping for stu
dents, but those with complicated problems
would still be referred to the appropriate
departments.
"My personal feeling is we are providing
every bit as good and comprehensive a ser-

and the Bursar's Office

vice as the University of Pennsylvania"
without having to suffer from "organiza
tional turmoil," additional costs and dis
ruption of services, Erickson said.
Another major concern is the need to
separate accounting duties to the satisfac
tion of University and other auditors.
Erickson explained that for legal reasons,
an organization cannot at the same time
authorize and disburse loans, functions
currently performed by the Financial Aids
Office and the Bursar's Office respectively.
Mahoney said if auditing control impted
iments mean the two offices must be sepa
rated, they would be. Her main concern,
she added, is for students to have easy
access to necessary information.
Erickson said there are also spatial and
computer programming needs for a reorga
nized office which may not be met because
of the budget crunch.
Mahoney said Student Resources will
operate within "post-repositioning" alloca
tions — that the new organization will "live
within the constraints" of budget cuts.
After a 15 percent cut, the budget of
Student Resources this year is about $25
million.
