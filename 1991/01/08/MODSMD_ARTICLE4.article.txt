# Student Resources faces restructuring
## 
### Cecilia Tom Editorial staff 
The Office of Student Resources may
soon undergo a mcyor structural overhaul
intended to smooth working relationships
among different student services.
The proposal, which Acting Vice Presi
dent Sally Mahoney is currently finalizing,
would eliminate the Office of Residential
Affairs and move the Office of Residential
Education, now under the jurisdiction of
the-Dean of Student Affairs, to another net
work of offices collectively called "academic
services."
The Housing Center, currently under
Residential Affairs, would be run by an
administrative unit within Mahoney's
office. She said this change would not alter
the center's functions significantly; the
center merely executes the policies set forth
by Res Ed.
Mahoney is also proposing the grouping
of Undergraduate Advising Center, the
Career Planning and Placement Center and
Res Ed, which would tentatively be
renamed Undergraduate Residential Pro
grams.
Mahoney said the new group — "educa
tional services" — would create smoother
working relationships among these offices,
replacing cumbersome committee meetings
with staff meetings.
Students may find the change helpful,
she said, citing undergraduate orientation
as an example. Since freshmen advising is
dorm-based, student planners could easily
organize programs by consulting people
within a single organization.
Robin Hensley, acting director of Res Ed,
said she approves of the proposal because it
presents an opportunity "to improve our
relationships with different areas." How
ever, she declined to comment on the possi
bility of layoffs in her office resulting from
reorganization.
In addition, under the proposed changes,
Cowell Student Health Center would report
directly to the vice president rather than to
Student Affairs. Acting Director Harvey
Weinstein said he welcomes the change,
adding that Cowell would continue to work
with other student services.

"It's very important for Cowell to have
input at the vice president level" because
health is a campus and national con
cern, he said.
With these changes, the role of the dean
of Student Affairs would have to be rede
fined, Mahoney said. Norm Robinson is
currently the acting dean, having assumed
James Lyons' position after he retired last
June. Mahoney said faculty and students
will have opportunities for input in the
search for the new dean.
Robinson said the rationale behind the
reorganization, which would reduce the
scope of authority of Student Affairs, is to
"provide the most effective range of ser
vices possible in the most efficient way."
Michael Jackson, associate dean of Stu
dent Affairs and head of Campus Affairs,
declined to speculate on his position in the
proposed organization but welcomed the
prospect of "new possibilities."
With the reorganization, Campus Affairs
would also oversee religious affairs. How
ever, Dean of the Chapel Robert Gregg
would still report directly to the president,
because Memorial Church has a much
larger constituency than just students,
Malioney explained.
She added that the move is important
because religion, like minority affairs, is
part of the diversity at Stanford and
deserves a voice in Campus Affairs.
The Bechtel International Center came
under the auspices of Campus Affairs this
fall for the same reason, Mahoney said.
Center director John Pearson said it is now
easier to deal with diversity than in the
past, when he reported to the dean of Grad
uate Studies.
Jackson "has been very supportive and
challenges us to look at multiculturalism,"
he added.
Besides redefining Student Affairs,
Mahoney proposes to consolidate the
administration of financial aid, graduate
financial awards and the Bursar's Office
into one collective entity called "financial
services," which would report to her.
The Bursar's Office currently reports to
the Controller's Office.
