# Vandals deface gay symbol
## 
### Howard Libit Staff writer 
Vandals targeted the "Gay Liberation"
sculpture twice during winter break in the
latest of a series of defacings in its seven
year history.
In the two most recent incidents, which
were reported to Stanford police Dec. 11
and Jan. 4, paint pellets were fired at the
George Segal sculpture. A similar incident
occurred Nov. 11.
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer
said, "The [recent] vandalism was probably
done by random juveniles playing war
games."
"However, they intended to deface this
specific sculpture because there were no
other locations that were hit by paint pel

lets," Niemeyet* noted.
Located next to the Quad in Lomita
Mall, "Gay Liberation" has been a contro
versial symbol for the gay movement. Stan
ford received the sculpture after numerous
cities, including San Francisco, refused to
display it permanently.
The bronze sculpture depicts four life
size, white figures frozen in motion. Two
women sit on a bench, with one lightly
touching the other's knee. Two men are
standing nearby, and one man is resting his
arm on the other's shoulder.
"Gay Liberation" was first vandalized
when someone smashed the sculpture over
40 times with a ball-peen hammer within
one month after it was unveiled. After
national media covered the inci
dent, "Gay Liberation" was
recast.
The sculpture was removed in
August 1987 after someone
spray-painted "AIDS" on one
male figure. It remained in the
basement of the Stanford
Museum for 20 months before
being returned in May 1989.
Police have no suspects in the
recent vandalism incident,
Niemeyer said.
Vandals also shot a sign at the
Old Firehouse — which houses
the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual
Community Center — with paint
pellets Dec. 11.

Besides the vandalism, winter
break was relatively quiet in
terms of crime, Niemeyer said.
On New Year's Day, several
people reported that rocks were
thrown at their cars near Sand
Hill Road. Police apprehended
four minors in the area but did
hot have sufficient witnesses or
evidence to press charges.
The number of automobile and
bicycle thefts was no higher than
usual, Niemeyer said. Police have
not yet compiled data on the num
ber of thefts from dorm rooms,
most of which could not be
reported until Sunday or yester
day.
Police are continuing their
investigation into the Robinson
Hall sexual assault case, which
occurred just before Dead Week.
They said they have no suspects
and would not discuss details.
