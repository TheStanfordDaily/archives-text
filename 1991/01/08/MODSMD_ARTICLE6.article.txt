# Fellow: 'Why celebrate diversity?'
## 
### Susan Jackson 
Margo Hendricks revels in
defying myths about race and gen
der.
"There's a notion that you
can't teach something because
you're different," says the Stan
ford Humanities Center fellow.
"That I can't teach white Renais
sance literature because I'm a
black woman, that a white male
can't teach Toni Morrison."
She says she believes "celebrat
ing one culture by definition
negates another."
"What is respect for diversity?
What does that have to do with
me?" asks Hendricks. "I read the
same books, write the same lan
guage, drive the same kind of car
and eat the same food as everyone
else."
"Why celebrate difference
when we have so much in com
mon? Diversity is just another
name for gender, race, class and
sex and their ideologies. They
don't need to be celebrated."
One of eight Humanities Cen
ter fellows selected from a pool of

more than 300, Hendricks is
spending her year here working
on a manuscript about patronage,
colonialism and the emergence of
the woman playwright in the 17th
century.
Hendricks will also teach "Lit
erary Patronage and Women in
17th-Century England" this quar
ter.
But Hendricks also tries to
bring the 20th century into her
classes, teaching "Star Wars"
alongside "Paradise Lost." And
she grapples with present day
issues — such as the future of
feminism — as well as those of the
17th century. In November, Hen
dricks presented a paper on "Fem
inism in the Academic Environ
ment" at a conference of the
Philological Association of the
Pacific Coast.
Participants were asked where
feminism is going. Hendricks,
who says she is both an optimist
and a cynic, responded that femi
nism is changing; she does not
foresee a retrenchment.
"There's a generation of
women arising who don't know

yet that their desires are going to
be incredibly frustrated," Hen
dricks says. But she adds,
"Because [these women] firmly
believe that they can do anything,
they probably will."
One of the bases for her opti
mism is that young women of
today "have more control over
their reproductive systems" —
more control, at any rate, than
women of her day had, she says.
"We had three choices: the pill, to
have a baby and diaphragms.
Abortions were illegal when I was
in high school."
Now, "access to birth control
has empowered women," she says.
"Women can choose." However,
Hendricks notes, "In America,
there's no respect for a woman's
body. In Europe, birth control is
considered both the man's and the
woman's responsibility.
"Behind the mask of liberty
and freedom is a looming fascist
state, and it starts with women's
bodies," she says of the United
States.

In her classes, visiting Humanities Center fellow Margo Hendricks explores age-old controversies In the
context of 20th century Ideas, teaching "Paradise Lost" alongside "Star Wars." This quarter, she is
teaching "Literary Patronage and Women In 17th-century England."
For her own part, Hendricks,
who is remarried, has chosen not
to have children. "It's my prag
matic side. I helped raise my sis
ter's two boys. But why would I
want to have a child? What end
would it serve?"
Hendricks began her college
education at age 28, after she had
a tubal ligation. "Going to college
was never a question in my mind,"
says the Southern California
native. "I just didn't want to go at
18. I wanted to be an adult first.
Then I found out that wasn't as
fun as it was set up to be."
Originally, Hendricks planned
to be a lawyer. "I worked for a
bank and realized I was smarter
than most of the men I worked
for," many of whom were lawyers,
she says.
A class on Renaissance litera
ture that Hendricks took at Cali
fornia State University-San
Bernardino changed her plans.
"The professor ended up talking
to me about getting a Ph.D." and
adding that Hendricks could
always go back to law school when
she finished it.
Hendricks, 42, attended UC-
Riverside for her doctoral work.
Midway through it, she took a job
at Stockton State College in New
Jersey. There, she "hit a wall" and

decided to become a professor, a
"commodity." Since 1988, she has
taught at San Jose State Univer
sity and UC-Santa Cruz.
Hendricks says her job offers
have been due, at least in part, to
being a woman of color. Despite
her "long-range plans to move
gender, race and class from the
discourse," she says she believes
Affirmative Action is necessary.
"As a society we have the responsi
bility for addressing historical
problems," she says.
Terry O'Neal, a former student
of Hendricks at San Jose State,
says, "There are many professors
here who haven't dusted off their
Ph. D.sin a long time, but Margo's
open to change and criticism."
O'Neal, who went back to school
at age 38 to earn a second bache
lor's degree, says he "knew from
the first time I went into the class
that I liked her."
Hendricks says, "My courses
are always overcrowded and no
one drops them because of the
way I teach. 'Star Wars' and 'Par
adise Lost' cover the same ground
— myth, heroic figure, epic."
This cross-pollination of sub
jects helped Hendricks win her
Humanities Center fellowship.
Charles Junkerman, associate
director of the center, explains,
"Feminist theory is of interest to
people in literature, but also to
anthropologists and philosophers.
... Margo's thinking is very use
ful."

According to Hendricks, many
people of color earn doctorates
from the most prestigious institu
tions, yet still cannot get hired.
Women encounter a similar
predicament. "A woman doesn't
have a choice about her bodj', a
Ph.D. doesn't have a choice about
getting a position. You have no
rights — that's discriminatory,"
says Hendricks, adding that his
torical patterns of discrimination
can be verified.
Much of Hendrick's research
about the 17th century has
attempted to do just that. "There
were a whole slew of racialized
plays until the beginning of the
18th century," then they disap
peared. "What happened?" she
asks, "The English were coming
in contact with other people at
that time — there were 10,000
Africans in England at the end of
the 16th century. But that doesn't
come out in the literature."
Hendricks asserts that the con
cept of race was introduced in the
18th century "as a way of articu
lating social relations" — specifi
cally to justify slavery.
To remedy this injustice, Hen
dricks says, "We have to trans
form our history. We are our own
historical agents." By removing
race, class and gender from the
discourse, she believes, such a
transformation is possible.
"I don't want to live and die a
black woman. Underneath it all,
I'm Margo."

and a cynic, responded that femi
nism is changing; she does not
foresee a retrenchment.
"There's a generation of
women arising who don't know

yet that their desires are going to
be incredibly frustrated," Hen
dricks says. But she adds,
"Because [these women] firmly
believe that they can do anything,
they probably will."
One of the bases for her opti
mism is that young women of
today "have more control over
their reproductive systems" —
more control, at any rate, than
women of her day had, she says.
"We had three choices: the pill, to
have a baby and diaphragms.
Abortions were illegal when I was
in high school."
Now, "access to birth control
has empowered women," she says.
"Women can choose." However,
Hendricks notes, "In America,
there's no respect for a woman's
body. In Europe, birth control is
considered both the man's and the
woman's responsibility.
"Behind the mask of liberty
and freedom is a looming fascist
state, and it starts with women's
bodies," she says of the United
States.

In her classes, visiting Humanities Center fellow Margo Hendricks explores age-old controversies In the
context of 20th century Ideas, teaching "Paradise Lost" alongside "Star Wars." This quarter, she is
teaching "Literary Patronage and Women In 17th-century England."
For her own part, Hendricks,
who is remarried, has chosen not
to have children. "It's my prag
matic side. I helped raise my sis
ter's two boys. But why would I
want to have a child? What end
would it serve?"
Hendricks began her college
education at age 28, after she had
a tubal ligation. "Going to college
was never a question in my mind,"
says the Southern California
native. "I just didn't want to go at
18. I wanted to be an adult first.
Then I found out that wasn't as
fun as it was set up to be."
Originally, Hendricks planned
to be a lawyer. "I worked for a
bank and realized I was smarter
than most of the men I worked
for," many of whom were lawyers,
she says.
A class on Renaissance litera
ture that Hendricks took at Cali
fornia State University-San
Bernardino changed her plans.
"The professor ended up talking
to me about getting a Ph.D." and
adding that Hendricks could
always go back to law school when
she finished it.
Hendricks, 42, attended UC-
Riverside for her doctoral work.
Midway through it, she took a job
at Stockton State College in New
Jersey. There, she "hit a wall" and

decided to become a professor, a
"commodity." Since 1988, she has
taught at San Jose State Univer
sity and UC-Santa Cruz.
Hendricks says her job offers
have been due, at least in part, to
being a woman of color. Despite
her "long-range plans to move
gender, race and class from the
discourse," she says she believes
Affirmative Action is necessary.
"As a society we have the responsi
bility for addressing historical
problems," she says.
Terry O'Neal, a former student
of Hendricks at San Jose State,
says, "There are many professors
here who haven't dusted off their
Ph. D.sin a long time, but Margo's
open to change and criticism."
O'Neal, who went back to school
at age 38 to earn a second bache
lor's degree, says he "knew from
the first time I went into the class
that I liked her."
Hendricks says, "My courses
are always overcrowded and no
one drops them because of the
way I teach. 'Star Wars' and 'Par
adise Lost' cover the same ground
— myth, heroic figure, epic."
This cross-pollination of sub
jects helped Hendricks win her
Humanities Center fellowship.
Charles Junkerman, associate
director of the center, explains,
"Feminist theory is of interest to
people in literature, but also to
anthropologists and philosophers.
... Margo's thinking is very use
ful."

According to Hendricks, many
people of color earn doctorates
from the most prestigious institu
tions, yet still cannot get hired.
Women encounter a similar
predicament. "A woman doesn't
have a choice about her bodj', a
Ph.D. doesn't have a choice about
getting a position. You have no
rights — that's discriminatory,"
says Hendricks, adding that his
torical patterns of discrimination
can be verified.
Much of Hendrick's research
about the 17th century has
attempted to do just that. "There
were a whole slew of racialized
plays until the beginning of the
18th century," then they disap
peared. "What happened?" she
asks, "The English were coming
in contact with other people at
that time — there were 10,000
Africans in England at the end of
the 16th century. But that doesn't
come out in the literature."
Hendricks asserts that the con
cept of race was introduced in the
18th century "as a way of articu
lating social relations" — specifi
cally to justify slavery.
To remedy this injustice, Hen
dricks says, "We have to trans
form our history. We are our own
historical agents." By removing
race, class and gender from the
discourse, she believes, such a
transformation is possible.
"I don't want to live and die a
black woman. Underneath it all,
I'm Margo."
Margo Hendricks revels in
defying myths about race and gen
der.
"There's a notion that you
can't teach something because
you're different," says the Stan
ford Humanities Center fellow.
"That I can't teach white Renais
sance literature because I'm a
black woman, that a white male
can't teach Toni Morrison."
She says she believes "celebrat
ing one culture by definition
negates another."
"What is respect for diversity?
What does that have to do with
me?" asks Hendricks. "I read the
same books, write the same lan
guage, drive the same kind of car
and eat the same food as everyone
else."
"Why celebrate difference
when we have so much in com
mon? Diversity is just another
name for gender, race, class and
sex and their ideologies. They
don't need to be celebrated."
One of eight Humanities Cen
ter fellows selected from a pool of

more than 300, Hendricks is
spending her year here working
on a manuscript about patronage,
colonialism and the emergence of
the woman playwright in the 17th
century.
Hendricks will also teach "Lit
erary Patronage and Women in
17th-Century England" this quar
ter.
But Hendricks also tries to
bring the 20th century into her
classes, teaching "Star Wars"
alongside "Paradise Lost." And
she grapples with present day
issues — such as the future of
feminism — as well as those of the
17th century. In November, Hen
dricks presented a paper on "Fem
inism in the Academic Environ
ment" at a conference of the
Philological Association of the
Pacific Coast.
Participants were asked where
feminism is going. Hendricks,
who says she is both an optimist
and a cynic, responded that femi
nism is changing; she does not
foresee a retrenchment.
