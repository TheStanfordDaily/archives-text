# Fellow: 'Why celebrate diversity?'
## 
### Susan Jackson 
Margo Hendricks revels in
defying myths about race and gen
der.
"There's a notion that you
can't teach something because
you're different," says the Stan
ford Humanities Center fellow.
"That I can't teach white Renais
sance literature because I'm a
black woman, that a white male
can't teach Toni Morrison."
She says she believes "celebrat
ing one culture by definition
negates another."
"What is respect for diversity?
What does that have to do with
me?" asks Hendricks. "I read the
same books, write the same lan
guage, drive the same kind of car
and eat the same food as everyone
else."
"Why celebrate difference
when we have so much in com
mon? Diversity is just another
name for gender, race, class and
sex and their ideologies. They
don't need to be celebrated."
One of eight Humanities Cen
ter fellows selected from a pool of

more than 300, Hendricks is
spending her year here working
on a manuscript about patronage,
colonialism and the emergence of
the woman playwright in the 17th
century.
Hendricks will also teach "Lit
erary Patronage and Women in
17th-Century England" this quar
ter.
But Hendricks also tries to
bring the 20th century into her
classes, teaching "Star Wars"
alongside "Paradise Lost." And
she grapples with present day
issues — such as the future of
feminism — as well as those of the
17th century. In November, Hen
dricks presented a paper on "Fem
inism in the Academic Environ
ment" at a conference of the
Philological Association of the
Pacific Coast.
Participants were asked where
feminism is going. Hendricks,
who says she is both an optimist
and a cynic, responded that femi
nism is changing; she does not
foresee a retrenchment.
"There's a generation of
women arising who don't know

yet that their desires are going to
be incredibly frustrated," Hen
dricks says. But she adds,
"Because [these women] firmly
believe that they can do anything,
they probably will."
One of the bases for her opti
mism is that young women of
today "have more control over
their reproductive systems" —
more control, at any rate, than
women of her day had, she says.
"We had three choices: the pill, to
have a baby and diaphragms.
Abortions were illegal when I was
in high school."
Now, "access to birth control
has empowered women," she says.
"Women can choose." However,
Hendricks notes, "In America,
there's no respect for a woman's
body. In Europe, birth control is
considered both the man's and the
woman's responsibility.
"Behind the mask of liberty
and freedom is a looming fascist
state, and it starts with women's
bodies," she says of the United
States.
