Haitian troops stop coup attempt
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - Loyalist
troops yesterday crushed a coup attempt by an
associate of former dictator Jean-Claude
Duvalier that left at least 37 people dead,
including seven by lynching. The uprising
threatened the transition of power to Haiti's
first freely elected president.
Coup leader Roger Lafontant, reputed head
of the dreaded Tonton Macoute private militia,
was captured by troops who stormed the
National Palace where Lafontant held the
caretaker president, Ertha Pascal-Trouillot.
She was released unharmed after 10 hours as a
hostage.
The aborted coup in one of the world's poor
est countries came one month before the
scheduled swearing-in of a populist priest, The
Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, in this Caribbean
nation of 6 million residents.
Thousands of jubilant Haitians poured into
the streets of Port-au-Prince, the capital and
largest city, to celebrate the capture of
Lafontant. A plan to send him into exile was
reportedly halted when mobs surrounded the
airport to bar his departure.
Rose finishes prison sentence
CINCINNATI (AP) â€” Pete Rose, who was
banned from baseball for gambling in 1989,
completed a five-month prison term yesterday
and checked into a Cincinnati halfway house to
fulfill the second phase of his sentence for tax
evasion.
About a dozen children chanting "Welcome
Home Pete" briefly surrounded the former
Cincinnati Reds star when he stepped out of a
car and walked quickly into the private Talbert
House, where he will spend the next three
months.
Rose must do 1,000 hours of community
service teaching physical education at inner
city elementary schools and at a community
center for children in a poor neighborhood
while living at the halfway house, which is
home to 45 men.
PBS offers news show in Spanish
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Corporation
for Public Broadcasting, saying that the
nation's Hispanics are being shut off from
most television news programming,
announced yesterday it will offer a Spanish
version of the MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour.
On Jan. 14, the Public Broadcasting System
program will become the first msyor national
American news program to carry a simultane
ous Spanish translation, said CPB President
Don Led wig.
The Spanish version, called News Hour en
Espanol, will be available in 36 cities, including
Washington and New York, under a corpora
tion grant of $290,000 to cover a year's costs.
A Spanish version was tested in 25 selected
cities for two weeks in September, and the
response was generally positive, Ledwig said.
"Spanish is the second most predominant
language used in the country, and U.S. Census
Bureau figures show that the Hispanic popula
tion is growing five times faster than the pop
ulation as a whole," he added.
