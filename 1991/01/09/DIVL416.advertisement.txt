Package you can be a finance major in
no time.
Here's lesson number one: Apply for a
Visa or Mastercard along with a checking
account and the rate on the card will
drop a whole percentage point. We'll
rebate the first year's membership fee
and make applying relatively painless.
Lesson two: You'll have unlimited
ATM usage with no service charge on
the checking account when you main
tain at least a $1(H).(H) balance* This balance require
ment drops down to $1.00 during the summer.
So you can keep stocked up on suntan oil without
having to close your account and reopen it when
it's time for school.
And if you feel like getting a little extra credit
in communications, use the free phone we're
throwing in to spice up that drab dorm room.
You'll also be getting a surprise free gift that'll
help you organize your finances.
So come open your checking account tixlay. After
all, at Security Pacific all majors get A+ treatment
