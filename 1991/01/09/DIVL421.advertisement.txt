You're never too young
to change the world.
We're attracted to college students for
what they haven t learned: limitations.
Systems to applications, multimedia to
networking, you won't find any limitations at
Microsoft. What you will find are small teams
and immediate responsibility for important
projects.
We're out to revolutionize the world with
our vision of personal computing. And we're
looking for the brightest technical minds to do
it. Many of them already work here as
Software Design Engineers and Program
Managers—learn how you can join them.
