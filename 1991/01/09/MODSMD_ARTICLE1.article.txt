# Big bill for pipe damage
## 
### Michael Friedly Editorial staff 
Pipes across campus burst dur
ing the holiday vacation due to an
arctic front that hit Stanford,
causing hundreds of thousands of
dollars in damage.
The front brought tempera
tures well below the freezing
point, dipping into the low 20s in
much of Northern California.
More than 50 buildings were
affected by burst pipes, which
caused extensive damage from
flooding and dropped ceilings.
Operations and Maintenance
Assoc. Director Bruce Wiggins
said the total costs of the damage
will not be tabulated until next
week but said yesterday his
department has already spent
over $70,000 in labor costs alone,
totaling more than 1,500 work
hours.
Pipes burst in most dormito
ries, forcing plumbers, electri
cians and carpenters to labor
through Christmas to clean up the
damages.
Stanford is covered by a $1 mil
lion self-insurance program,
which will cover most of the cost
of the damage.
The Mitchell Earth Sciences
Building was the worst hit,
flooded by five chilled-water coils
that burst. The broken coils set
off fire alarms, bringing in a fire
truck from the Palo Alto Fire
Department.
In all, 18 chilled water coils
burst, as well as an additional 31
at the Medical Center. Each water
coil will cost up to $10,000 to
replace, although most will be cov
ered by insurance.
Twelve stores at the Stanford
Shopping Center amassed up to
$35,000 in damages because of
burst pipes, although all managed
to stay open over the break.
"We have already taken steps to
prevent this from happening
again," according to operations
manager David Kaye of Opera-
