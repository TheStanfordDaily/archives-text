# Big bill for pipe damage
## 
### Michael Friedly Editorial staff 
Pipes across campus burst dur
ing the holiday vacation due to an
arctic front that hit Stanford,
causing hundreds of thousands of
dollars in damage.
The front brought tempera
tures well below the freezing
point, dipping into the low 20s in
much of Northern California.
More than 50 buildings were
affected by burst pipes, which
caused extensive damage from
flooding and dropped ceilings.
Operations and Maintenance
Assoc. Director Bruce Wiggins
said the total costs of the damage
will not be tabulated until next
week but said yesterday his
department has already spent
over $70,000 in labor costs alone,
totaling more than 1,500 work
hours.
Pipes burst in most dormito
ries, forcing plumbers, electri
cians and carpenters to labor
through Christmas to clean up the
damages.
Stanford is covered by a $1 mil
lion self-insurance program,
which will cover most of the cost
of the damage.
The Mitchell Earth Sciences
Building was the worst hit,
flooded by five chilled-water coils
that burst. The broken coils set
off fire alarms, bringing in a fire
truck from the Palo Alto Fire
Department.
In all, 18 chilled water coils
burst, as well as an additional 31
at the Medical Center. Each water
coil will cost up to $10,000 to
replace, although most will be cov
ered by insurance.
Twelve stores at the Stanford
Shopping Center amassed up to
$35,000 in damages because of
burst pipes, although all managed
to stay open over the break.
"We have already taken steps to
prevent this from happening
again," according to operations
manager David Kaye of Opera-
tions and Maintenance. He said
his staff has been installing insu
lation around water pipes to pre
vent them from freezing.
"I didn't have a very good vaca
tion, but it wasn't as bad as some
of the people here," Kaye said. He
praised the Operation and Main
tenance staff for "an excellent job.
I was really proud of them."
In many dorms, sprinkler sys
tems froze and burst, causing an
additional hazard in case there
was a fire. "The danger would
have been property and not loss of
life," Kaye said.
Some students in Burbank
were forced to sleep in other
dorms or in the lounge before new
carpets were installed yesterday.
The old carpets were destroyed by
the flooding and were not replaced
until two weeks after the damage,
causing a rancid mildew smell.
"People were a little unsettled
to come back and find out they
couldn't unpack," according to
Burbank resident assistant
Michelle Latvala. In addition, the
water seeped through the ceilings
into several residents' closets.
"Some people had to do several
loads of laundry," she said.
A burst pipe over the Nitery
theater in Old Union damaged the
floor of the theater, threatening
the Winter One Act Plays 1991,
which were scheduled to open
next Tuesday. The organizers are
currently looking for other places
for the rehearsals.
In addition, future plays in the
theater could be in danger if the
floor is not replaced soon. "This is
a large crisis for a great number of
people," according to Elaine
Romanelli, a sophomore involved
in next week's production.
The Cardinal Cogeneration
Plant was also victim to burst
pipes, causing heating systems
across campus to fail for two days.
The Academic Information
Resources computer center at
Tresidder was flooded by a burst
pipe, but computers were turned
off and should suffer no perma
nent damage.
The Stanford Linear Accelera
tor Center also reported heavy
damage. However, the accelerator
was already shut down for three
months, so replacement of equip
ment damaged by the cold should
not affect the research there.
