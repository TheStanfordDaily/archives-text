'Death* songs found near body
SEATTLE (AP) — A cassette tape of songa
by a rock group called Death was found near the
body of a man who was beaten to death with a
tree branch and a large rock, prosecutors say.
A prosecutor's affidavit filed Monday in
King County Superior Court said one of two
teen-agers charged with second-degree murder
in the case admitted owning the tape. Prosecu
tors said they don't know if the tape was left
purposely.
The Medical Examiner's Office identified
the victim Monday as Gary Andrew Burgess,
29. His body was found on New Year's Day.
The cassette was titled "Leprosy" and
included the songs "Left for Dead," "Born
Dead," "Pull the Plug" and "Open Casket."
Death is a Florida-based heavy metal group.
Population management proposed
SACRAMENTO (AP) — The state Senate's
leader suggested yesterday that Congress look
at ways to lure population growth away from
California because of the state's increasingly
serious water problems.
"We can't manage our population. That's
the province of the federal government," said
Senate President Pro Tem David Roberti, D-
Los Angeles.
"Maybe our congressional delegation
should look into the issue and maybe there
should be incentives for immigration to other
areas until we do something about water.
"We have a serious problem, not being able
to accommodate all of the people of this state
with the water resources we have, and nobody
talks about it. When we have permanent water
rationing then maybe we will know that it is
serious."
California's population jumped 26 percent
during the 1980s, reaching 30 million last
September. The stupendous growth in the last
part of the decade coincided with a drought
that experts fear could stretch into a fifth year.
Chrysler feeling out two-strokes
DETROIT (AP) — Chrysler Corp. has given
the go-ahead to develop a more efficient two
stroke engine, but it won't be ready for testing
for about five years, a company executive said
yesterday.
Engineering Vice President Francios Cas
taing said Chrysler still must solve critical pol
lution and consumer-acceptance problems
before it can put the engine into even limited
production in a test fleet. That probably won't
happen before the late part of this decade.
Nevertheless, the company is showing off
on the auto show circuit this year its Dodge
Neon concept car, a subcompact powered by a
1.1-liter, two-cycle engine producing about 100
horsepower. The engine is designed to give
greater fuel efficiency with no loss of power.
Automakers have been working with two
stroke engines for years. The engines are being
used in some small cars built in Eastern
Europe, along with motorcycles, boats, lawn
mowers and snow blowers.
White House condemns Soviets
WASHINGTON (AP) - The United States
yesterday rebuked the Soviet Union for its
decision to send troops into the Baltics to
enforce the national draft and called on the
Kremlin to halt its "attempts at intimidation."
In an abrupt about-face after months of
offering encouragement and support to Presi
dent Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the White House
charged the Soviet plan to use the military to
track down draft dodgers and deserters in the
breakaway republics was "provocative and
counterproductive.''
"This action represents a serious step
toward escalation of tension within the USSR
and makes the peaceful evolution of relations
among the people of the Soviet Union more dif
ficult," Press Secretary Marlin Fitz water said
in a statement.
"There's a lot of turmoil right now in the
Soviet Union and we're just watching the situ
ation very closely," said the official, who asked
not to be identified.
