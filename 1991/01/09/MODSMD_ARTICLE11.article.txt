GENEVA (AP) — Secretary of State James,A.
Baker 111 and Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz
arrived yesterday night for their fateful meeting on
the Persian Gulf crisis, talking of peace but holding
firmly to sharply conflicting U.S. and Iraqi positions.
Baker, who spent most of the day trying to cement
the anti-Iraq alliance in France, Germany and Italy,
said during a stop in Bonn that he would welcome
from Aziz "anything that would result in a peaceful
and political solution to this crisis."
But he also said there must be "no walking back
in any way from the United Nations Security Coun
cil resolutions" calling for Iraq to quit Kuwait by
next Tuesday or risk war.
Aziz said he was prepared for a useful meeting
with Baker today if he found a "genuine, sincere
interest in making peace through the whole Middle
East."
But he said if Baker tried to restrict the discus
sion to Iraq's hold on Kuwait, "we are going to give
the proper answer."
Turning around President Bush's frequent decla
ration that the question of whether there will be war
is up to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, Aziz said,
"The decision of war is the decision of Mr. Bush, not
our decision."
Vice President Dan Quayle yesterday said con
gressional support of President Bush's threat of
force against Iraq stands as possibly the last hope of
averting war in the Persian Gulf.
Saying the world's patience with Iraq has worn
perilously thin, Quayle warned that further delay
could hurt America and its allies and play into the

hands of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
"If Congress supports the president, we may at
this 11th hour be able to convince Saddam Hussein
that the threat of force is not an idle one," Quayle
said. "...If he does understand, I think he will with
draw his forces from Kuwait before Jan. 15."
Quayle's speech before the Los Angeles World
Affairs Council contributed to an intensified White
House lobbying effort to persuade Congress to pass a
resolution supporting Bush's war threat if Iraq fails
to withdraw from Kuwait by the Jan. 15 United
Nations deadline.
Iraq has tried from the outset to tie outside dis
cussion of its annexation of Kuwait to broader talks
on Palestinian claims against Israel. But the Bush
administration has brushed that idea aside, declar
ing Iraqi President Saddam Hussein did not "rape"
his oil-rich neighbor for the sake of the Palestinians.
Baker traveled to Paris, Bonn and Milan earlier
yesterday, preaching unity as the best way to force
Iraq to quit Kuwait, but France seemed poised to
strike out on its own in the event of a deadlock and
to send another emissary to Baghdad.
The French, backed by Germany and Italy, have
proposed dangling the prospect of a Middle East
peace conference to entice Saddam to reverse his
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
The Baker-Aziz meeting will come only six days
before a deadline set by the U.N. Security Council for
Saddam to pull his 500,000 troops from Kuwait or
run the risk of war.
Iraq warned last week that if Baker only intends
to deliver a letter from Bush demanding full with
drawal by Jan. 15, the meeting could be over in five
minutes.
Baker, speaking in Milan after a brief meeting
with Italian Foreign Minister Gianni de Michelis of
Italy, said:
"We welcome any and all efforts to resolve this
matter peacefully and politically, providing that
there is no mixing of the message and provided that
we stay unified."
He said, referring to Iraq's seizure of Kuwait, that
"larger and more powerful states cannot be permit
ted to absorb their smaller neighbors, and, in effect,
wipe them off the map."
Bush, without mentioning any specific instance,
said yesterday in Washington,"I know that pres
sures are now building to provide Saddam some
means of saving face, or to accept a withdrawal that
is less than unconditional. The danger in this course
should be clear to all."
Bolstered by new assertions of allied support —
including those Monday in London from British For
eign Secretary Douglas Hurd and NATO Secretary-
General Manfred Woerner — Baker ruled out any
extension of the Jan. 15 deadline.
Asked for an assessment, he said as the meeting
with Aziz approached, "I am less optimitic that we
might achieve a peaceful solution than I was before
Christmas." But, he said, "we are still going to work
toward that end."
Baker will travel to Turkey from Geneva and then
to the Middle East and the gulf. He plans talks in
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and
Syria, then will stop in Canada on the way home
Sunday.

"We welcome any and all efforts to resolve this
matter peacefully and politically, providing that
there is no mixing of the message and provided that
we stay unified."
He said, referring to Iraq's seizure of Kuwait, that
"larger and more powerful states cannot be permit
ted to absorb their smaller neighbors, and, in effect,
wipe them off the map."
Bush, without mentioning any specific instance,
said yesterday in Washington,"I know that pres
sures are now building to provide Saddam some
means of saving face, or to accept a withdrawal that
is less than unconditional. The danger in this course
should be clear to all."
Bolstered by new assertions of allied support —
including those Monday in London from British For
eign Secretary Douglas Hurd and NATO Secretary-
General Manfred Woerner — Baker ruled out any
extension of the Jan. 15 deadline.
Asked for an assessment, he said as the meeting
with Aziz approached, "I am less optimitic that we
might achieve a peaceful solution than I was before
Christmas." But, he said, "we are still going to work
toward that end."
Baker will travel to Turkey from Geneva and then
to the Middle East and the gulf. He plans talks in
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and
Syria, then will stop in Canada on the way home
Sunday.
