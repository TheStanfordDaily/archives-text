# U.S. Supreme Court checks out nude dancing
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Supreme Court was urged yesterday to
let states ban barroom-style nude
dancing and strike a blow for "tradi
tional notions of what constitutes pub
lic decency."
But a lawyer for two adult estab
lishments and three erotic dancers
countered, "It is not the business of
the state to determine what is trash
and what is of value."
Indiana Deputy Attorney General
Wayne Uhl said his state's ban on such
nude dancing, thrown out by a federal
appeals court, should be revived.
"Public nudity as a common law
crime existed long before the First
Amendment was adopted," Uhl said,
referring to pre-modem standards of
"traditional notions" of conduct
deemed acceptable for public places.
The Constitution's First Amend
ment guarantees freedom of speech.
Bruce Ennis, a Washington lawyer
representing two South Bend, Ind.,

businesses — the Kit Kat Lounge and
the Chippewa Club — as well as the
dancers, said the state cannot ban
nude dancing while it concedes such
performances are not legally obscene.
During a lively, 60-minute argu
ment session in which eight of the
court's nine justices shot questions at
the two lawyers, Uhl first suggested
that nudity in some forms — as part of
an opera, for example — would not be
banned under the state's invalidated
public decency law.
But later he said Indiana was press
ing for a "blanket ban" on public
nudity, not just barroom-style nude
dancing. Such a ban presumably would
include nudity in plays and opera pro
ductions as well.
In a 1981 decision, the Supreme
Court said, "Nude dancing is not with
out its First Amendment protections
from official regulations." But that
ruling did not specify the precise scope
of those protections.

The court's decision in this Indiana
case, expected by July, may provide
such specifics.
Uhl confronted vigorous question
ing, especially from Justices Anthony
M. Kennedy and Sandra Day O'Con
nor.
When Uhl contended that the kind
of nude dancing performed at the
South Bend establishments does not
amount to expressive activity, or what
lawyers call speech, Kennedy asked
whether that was because the dancers
were not good enough.
Uhl responded, "Go-go dancing
could be good or bad but in neither
case is it speech."
Even if such dancing is expressive,
Uhl said, "The message can be con
veyed almost as effectively with pasties
and G-strings."
If any of the justices wants to see
exactly what dances are at issue, video
tapes of past performances have been
submitted as part of the trial court's

official record.
Those videos feature several women
performing individually. Their dance
routines vary, but complete nudity is
the one similarity.
At one point in yesterday's argu
ment, Kennedy asked Uhl about deter
mining what forms of dancing are con
stitutionally protected. "Who's to do
this?" he said. "Is the legislature to do
this. Are we to do this?"
Uhl again relied on American tradi
tion, citing it for the proposition that
"certain body parts be covered in pub
lic."
O'Connor, saying Indiana's law
appears to be aimed at censoring only
some types of dance, asked Uhl
whether the state could ban all rock
music.
The deputy attorney general cited a
1989 high court ruling in answering
that rock music is constitutionally pro
tected, but added, "Not all dance con
veys an artistic message."
