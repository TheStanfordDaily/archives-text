# Gun lobby criticizes rifle registration
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO (AP) - The
gun lobby suggested yestersday
that last year's law requiring the
registration of "assault weapons"
isn't working, and is asking the
Legislature for another year to
find "a solution that makes more
sense."
The request is in a bill intro
duced by state Sen. Don Rogers,
R-Bakersfield, to extend the dead
line for registrations from last
Jan. 1 to the same date next year.
Carrying an urgency clause, it
would require a two-thirds vote of
both houses and go into effect on
the governor's signature.
Rogers told a news conference
that the law allows a judge to
prosecute as a felon anyone who
failed to register by Jan. 1 a
firearm on the list of about 50
"assault weapons." He said about
18,000 such weapons have been
registered with local law enforce
ment agencies, leaving perhaps
280,000 unregistered — and each
owner a potential felon.
"I don't think that's what we
want to do with this many people
in the State of California," Rogers
said.
But a co-author of the law, Sen
ate President Pro Tem David
Roberti, D-Los Angeles, issued a
statement saying he would oppose
extending the deadline.

"I can think of no other legisla
tion that I have dealt with that
has been so widely publicized."
A co-signer of the bill, Tom
McClintock, R-Thousand Oaks,
said the law has had no impact on
the criminal use of firearms. He
said the public remembers gener
ally that the list includes the Uzi
and the AK47, but doesn't know
that an $8,000 target rifle is also
on it.
"We've created over a quarter
of a million potential felons out of
decent law-abiding citizens,"
McClintock said.
A total "assault rifle" ban has
been in effect in the city of Los
Angeles since March of 1989.
Though the city ordinance was
passed to curb gang violence, this
past year saw a record number of
gang-related murders in the city.
New York City is currently consid
ering a similar ban.
Asked why the owners didn't
meet the registration deadline,
Rogers introduced assault rifle
owner Ken Kodak of Quincy,
Plumas County in northeast Cali
fornia, who said he tried three
times to register it but couldn't
for lack of forms or other reasons.
He now stores it outside the state.
Rogers said, "There are liter
ally thousands of Catch 22s all
over this state" that resulted in

significant impact on
the criminal use of
firearms.

non-registration. These include
ignorance of the list and firearm
model specifications, and dis
agreement among law enforce
ment officers about which firearm
is what.
Rogers said the owners of the
unregistered firearms fear that if
they try to register them now,
after the deadline, they will be
charged with felonies or at least
have their firearms confiscated.
Another co-signer, Assembly
man Richard Mountjoy, R-Arca
dia, said he doubted if any police
station could say exactly what is
on the list. He said he hoped the
new state attorney general would
let gun owners know what is on it.
Rogers, asked about the
chances of his bill passing, said, "I
think they are pretty good. ... I
think the proponents [of the law]
will realize that it is not working."
