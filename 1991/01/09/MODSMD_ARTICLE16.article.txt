ONCE AGAIN, STANFORD
University has shown that
budget streamlining can be
an absolute pain in that nether
region. The lines to pick up grades
this quarter were easily the longest
and least organized of recent years.
Understandably, the University
is streamlining in this time of eco
nomic uncertainty. Valuable
stamps to mail out grades may be
low on the "repositioning" totem
pole, but that's hardly an excuse
for a lack of common sense.
Why doesn't the Registrar's
Office take a walk on the wild side,
and set up four tables in the court
yard outside Old Union, instead of
cramming two lines into the over
crowded Old Union lobby?
Would it cost that much more to
have two more people handing out

pieces of paper? Zany as it may
seem, why not hire some low-cost,
off-duty OVs? They're probably
done with orientation by now, and
they're dang perky.
If that fails, why not offer t
shirts to volunteers who know
their alphabet? Stanford prides
itself on a student body full of peo
ple who will volunteer for almost
anything if they get a t-shirt.
Hanes Beefy-T, of course.
At the very least, the Registrar's
Office could've put out signs indi
cating which part of the alphabet
corresponded to which line as they
snaked out into White Plaza. At
only a few cents for a piece of paper,
it's a virtual steal to help avert an
organizational nightmare.
Hopefully, this sort of confusion
won't happen in the future.
