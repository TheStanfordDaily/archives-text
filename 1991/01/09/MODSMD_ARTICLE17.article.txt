# At home at Hoover

CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR
George Deukmejian's public
records come as a welcome
addition to the Hoover Institution.
Several years ago, Stanford went
through a lengthy and heated
debate over whether or not to
accept Ronald Reagan's presiden
tial library.
At the time, the University was
torn between its desire for a fantas
tic educational and research tool,
and its dissatisfaction with the
President's conservative policies.
In the end, dissatisfaction won out,
allowing the library to be donated
instead to southern California's
Eureka College.

The conditions surrounding
George Deukmejian's papers pre
sented a similar situation, but a dif
ferent response. Much of the Stan
ford community may be unhappy
with Deukmejian's polices on pub
lic education or the environment.
However, it still understands the
importance of any influential
politician's records.
Hopefully, we are avoiding the
regrets that many people feel now
over the loss of the Reagan library.
While current issues are very
important, we need to see past the
immediate politics and understand
the long-term values of any
resource.
