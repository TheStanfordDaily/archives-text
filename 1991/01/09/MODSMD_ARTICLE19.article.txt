## Eggnog and wanderlust 
### 
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW, I
spent my holiday break shivering on
that icecap fondly known as Min
nesota. No, I didn't do it to be closer to
Prince, though I did make a stop at his
new nightclub "Glam Slam." No, not to
be closer to Garrison Keillor either. He
moved to the Big Apple a few years ago,
though he is reportedly homesick.
I went simply because I have family
there. Even so, before leaving, I tried to
pull a Tom Sawyer routine on my room
mate from Florida: as he was packing his
bathing suit and shades, I expanded upon
the infinite joys of a White Christmas
that he would be missing again this year .
.. unless, that is, he wanted to trade
places and be my stand-in in St. Paul.
But, alas, there was no escaping it. I
would be making my annual pilgrimage to
the 40-below windchill of Minnesota, and
deep down I was glad. My mother's side of
the family arrived there from Norway
sometime last century and never left.
Minnesotans in general are like that.
They don't leave.
I have met dozens of Minnesotans my
age who have never traveled farther than
Wisconsin. While sipping eggnog at
Christmas parties, I learned that many of
my mother's old friends have made it
across the border for vacation but would
never — Heavens to Betsy! — consider
living anywhere else.
Even those who had moved away were
unimpressed by the outside world and
returned. I'm talking about reasonably
affluent people for whom pocketbook lim
itations are not decisive. They speak the
language not of limited opportunity, but

of contentment.
The last time I heard that language
was many years ago when I worked in
Switzerland. Many of my Swiss acquain
tances politely declined invitations to visit
the United States. When pressed, they
said they had everything they needed
right where they were and suggested
instead that I return to their mountain
idyll to join them for more hiking and ski
ing. I was struck by their deficiency of
curiosity, but impressed nonetheless by
their steady contentment.
The sources of contentment in Min
nesota are less evident to the naked eye,
but very real. There the extended family
still exists. After high school, people go to
college in-state. (They call the University
of Minnesota simply "The U," as if fur
ther elaboration would be redundant.)
Then they move to a house that is often
within several blocks of their parents'
home, where they grew up. As a result,
their own children will live within walk
ing distance of their grandparents and see
them frequently. It is this type of interwo
ven social fabric that is becofhing ever
more rare in individualistic, anonymous,
highly mobile America.
And friendships are more durable.
Minnesotans gather for Irish Coffees
around warm fires with friends they first
met over crayons in kindergarten. Rela
tionships there have the depth and conti
nuity that come with knowing that every
one's around for the long haul, that there
will be no abrupt departures for another
city or another country.
By contrast, most of my friends and I
are transients: we've lived in many differ

ent places and repeatedly started from
scratch in forging a whole new set of
friendships. We've traveled throughout
the world and tend to intellectualize the
choice of where we'd like to live in the
future: "Yes, such-and-such does have a
nice climate, but crime has gotten bad,
blah, blah, blah ..."
On top of the unprecedented choices
already confronting my generation, many
of us also spend time thinking about
where to live next rather than taking this
for granted as Minnesotans do. Paradoxi
cally, choice can bring limitations as well
as opportunities by leading us to cut our
selves off from family, friends and com
munities.
Can a life of breadth, in which one con
tinually tries to satiate curiosity about
the unknown, be reconciled with a life of
depth, where relationships have an
unquestioned, indeed almost a predes
tined, permanence? If, as I suspect, they
cannot, my wanderlust will probably lead
me to continue choosing the former. But I
will still try to return each year around
the holiday to reconnect momentarily and
tap into the Minnesota warmth as best I
can.
