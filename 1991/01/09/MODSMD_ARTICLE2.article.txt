# Police make sign bust at fraternity
## 
### Howard Libit Staff writer 
At least five Stanford police
officers raided the Theta Delta
Chi House at 8:40 a.m. yesterday
in search of stolen signs, recover
ing about 14.
The signs, which show various
street names, speed limits and the
name of the Oak Creek apartment
complex, belong to the University,
the city of Palo Alto and others.
"In my years here at Stanford,
I cannot remember ever seeing
this many signs at one time from
one location," said Police Sgt.
John McMullen, who was in
charge of the raid.
Police also found a stretcher
which appears to be from a first
aid station at the football stadium,
McMullen said.
The signs were discovered dur
ing the holiday break when

nearby residents reported seeing a
light inside the Theta Delt house.
Thinking that a burglary might be
in progress, officers responded
and checked on the lights. In the
process, they discovered numer
ous signs covering the walls of the
kitchen and the bar room.
"We do not make it a habit of
searching residences for stolen
signs," McMullen said. "However,
when we do find stolen signs we
must recover them and take care
of the situation."
Police will continue their inves
tigation and decide whether to
press charges against those sus
pected of taking the signs. Police
acknowledge that it will be diffi
cult to begin a criminal process
without knowing who actually
stole the signs and when.
"I think that any efforts [to

find a suspect] would be pretty
futile," fylcMullen said.
"Many of the signs have been
in [the Theta Delt house] for some
time. Some have apparently been
stolen in the last year or two,"
said Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
Members of the fraternity dis
agree, claiming that the signs
have been in the house for many
years.
"Some of the signs have been
here throughout the history of the
house. Many were found in junk
yards," said senior Mureithi
Davis. "As far as we know, they

were not stolen."
"Almost all of the signs have
been in the house for many years.
I haven't noticed any new signs
since I began working here," said
Nancy Hopkins, the cook at the
fraternity for the past four years.
Police will probably refer the
case to Michael Ramsey-Perez,
program and fraternal affairs
advisor, Niemeyer said.
"I will ask the Interfraternity
Council to look into it," said Ram
sey-Perez. "One of the problems is
that it will be hard to determine
who did it."
Ramsey-Perez said Theta Delt
is not the only group to have
stolen signs.
"I have a hunch that other
organizations, not just fraterni

ties, have signs that belong to oth
ers," he said.
Ramsey-Perez had not yet spo
ken to Theta Delt members but
said he planned to very shortly.
"One of the things that con
cerns me is that [the stolen signs]
were in a common room," Ram
sey-Perez said. Having stolen
property "is something that the
fraternity should address."
The fraternity members were
most upset by the number of
police officers who removed the
signs.
"The biggest complaint we
have is how [the police] handled
the situation," Davis said. "There
was no need for so much man
power for something this small."
