## A
						dozen reasons against war in the Middle East 
### 
BUSH HAS DEMANDED that Iraq
evacuate Kuwait by January 15. If
Iraq refuses to remove its troops by
then, the United States will go to war.
Here are literally a dozen reasons why it
shouldn't:
• 10,000 to 50,000 American soldiers
killed, many more wounded and countless
others at home who would grieve these
losses. Both the social and economic costs
of such a war would be enormous.
• Those who would die or be wounded
are not the same as those ordering them
into battle. The victims, as with all wars,
would include a disproportionate number
of young people, poor people and people of
color.
• There would be 100,000 to 2 million
Kuwaitis and Iraqis killed, many more
wounded and numerous others to grieve.
Many of these would be totally innocent
civilians, including the elderly, the sick,
women and children. Like our young sol
diers, they would be innocent victims of
geopolitics and should not have to die.
• In spite of claims to the contrary,
such a war would be viewed as a religious
war (Christians and Jews vs. Moslems), a
racial war (whites vs. people of color) and
a class war (rich against poor). It is never

There would be 100,000 to 2 million Kuwaitis
and Iraqis killed, many more wounded and
numerous others to grieve. Many of these would
be totally innocent civilians ...

productive to fan the flames of bigotry.
• There are legitimate grievances
which Iraq has against Kuwait. From
1756 until 1899, Kuwait was part of
Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq). The
British ruled this region between 1899
and 1922, and after fighting Iraqis in the
1920-1921 war of independence, Britain
drew borders that created the country of
Kuwait in order to deny Iraq access to the
sea. After oil was discovered in Kuwait in
1945, the Kuwaitis used "slant-drilling"
to take an estimated $2.4 billion in oil
which rightfully belonged to Iraq.
• The United States is backing nations
which are opposed to the principles of
democracy and human rights. At the time
of its overthrow last August, Kuwait was
a monarchy in which the majority of its
people were non-citizens who could not

vote or share in its wealth. Saudi Arabia
is a kingdom in which there is no freedom
of religion and women are considered to
be inferior.
• There is no United Nations force at
work here. The "allies" are dominated by
the U.S. military, supplemented only by
token numbers of soldiers from a handful
of other countries. Neither is this a
United Nations-sanctioned enterprise.
The U.N. Security Council is dominated
by "empire states," and it does not reflect
the many diverse peoples of the planet,
such as those found in the U.N. General
Assembly.
• Saddam Hussein has indicated that
he would be amenable to a settlement,
particularly if his country were allowed a
port in the Persian Gulf. The U.S. insis

tence on "no compromise" stands as an
obstacle to peace, and is counter to basic
principles of conflict resolution.
• The United States and its allies
might not "win" such a war. Its enormous
firepower may (as in Vietnam) be offset
by the grim determination of Iraqis to
defend their homes, their people and their
religion against a foreign aggressor.
• If the United States and its allies do
"win" this war, the long-term negative
implications may prove to be stronger
than the immediate gains. A cry for
vengeance by Arabs and others, particu
larly if supported by nuclear weapons,
could lead to an even larger and more
deadly war.
• "Thou shalt not Kill" (Exodus
20:13). "Blessed are the Peacemakers"
(Matthew 5:9). Our Judeo-Christian her
itage is clear in its message about
whether or not to start a war.
• Planet Earth cannot sustain the
human race if we continue to choose war
as a means of settling disputes. With the
advancement and proliferation of
"doomsday" weapons, the policy of using
only non-military solutions must be
implemented now.
