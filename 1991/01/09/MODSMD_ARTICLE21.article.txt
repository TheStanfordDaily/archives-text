# President using media for personal political goals
## 
### 
I am a 59-year-old man who has never
been involved in politics or causes.
However, I have a 20-year-old son. I do
not want him defending my country for
oil interests.
Furthermore, I have lost respect for
President Bush. My conclusion is that he
is a political opportunist whose actions

are based upon political polls, sound
bites and photo opportunities.
I resent his calling our troops "kids,"
and I found his orchestrated trip to the
desert to be obscene. "Chowing down"
with our forces in the desert and acting
as just one of the boys was a repulsive
and vulgar play for support.
President Bush's actions are based
upon the dangerous standards of political
expediency: "What can I do to help me
politically,"
I am sorry that our president's stan
dards are so cynically motivated.
