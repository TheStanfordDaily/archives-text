## Arteries that 'learn' cause heart failure 
### Chris Patil Staff writer 
Each year, 10,000 Americans suffer from
heart attacks after undergoing successful
bypass surgery or balloon angioplasty. Accord
ing to Stanford researchers, coronary arteries
that "learn" may be responsible for many of
these heart attacks — a discovery that may
have life-saving ramifications for bypass
patients.
In bypass surgery, doctors use artery grafts
to allow blood to bypass a section of artery that
is clogged with deposits of fatty plaque.
In balloon angioplasty, a relatively recent
alternative to the more risky bypass operation,
a surgeon inserts a flexible tube called a
catheter into the blocked artery. A tiny balloon
at the end of the catheter is then inflated to
flatten the plaque and open the vessel.
When blood flow through the vessel
increases after surges, the artery needs time
to relearn what constitutes normal blood pres

severely occluded says, 'This new (normal)

tion to decrease the pressure and protect the
heart muscle that I'm serving,' " said cardiolo
gist Tim Fischell, assistant professor of
medicine.
In the process of constriction, the newly
unclogged artery may restrict blood flow
enough to initiate a heart attack, he explained.
Fischell's study began with a bypass patient
who had received two grafts — one in an
almost occluded vessel and one in an artery
with only 50 percent narrowing. The patient
had experienced a msyor heart attack after
surgery, and examination of the grafts showed
no surgical errors.

However, the artery distal to, or down
stream of, the severely blocked vessel was com
pletely blocked, while the section distal to the
partial occlusion was unconstricted.
"My idea was that something about arteries
that are severely blocked and chronically
exposed to low pressuie might make them mis
interpret normal pressure," Fischell said.
Subsequent study of 20 balloon angioplasty
patients validated his hypothesis.
"The results were striking," he said. "The
amount of constriction in the distal vessel was
almost precisely correlated with what we pre
dicted. Vessels with the critical occlusion were
subject to the worst constrictions, while mod
erately blocked vessels showed virtually no
constriction after balloon angioplasty."
As a precaution, Fischell recommends rela
tively high doses of intravenous nitroglycerine
after angioplasty and bypass surgery, particu
larly in cases of total or severe occlusion.
Nitroglycerine relaxes and dilates blood ves
sels.
He cautions, however, that additional study
is necessapr. "This is an important observa
tion, but it has not yet been generalized to
large numbers of patients to look at the clini
cal effects," he warned.
