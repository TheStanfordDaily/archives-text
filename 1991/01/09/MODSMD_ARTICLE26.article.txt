# Eating well: A quick fix for fast food habits
## 
### June Cohen Editorial staff 
It's 10 at night and your 5 p.m.
Food Service dinner has just worn
off.
Your stomach growls. You and
your roommate exchange know
ing glances. Simultaneously, the
two of you jump up, grab your
keys and head to college students'
eatery of choice: the fast food
restaurant.
Maybe tonight it will be
McDonalds; or Jack-in-the-Box;
or, for a touch of cultural cuisine,
perhaps Taco Bell.
And you aren't alone; fast food
is a quickly growing trend in
America. Fourty percent of U.S.
restaurant revenues now go to
fast food establishments, and U.S.
consumers spend an average of
$200/ year on fast food.
Now you're an educated per
son; you know the food is bad for
you. In fact, you might even eiyoy
it for that very reason.
Indeed, the health implications
of the American fast food diet are
disturbing, as the menus are filled
with high-calorie, high-fat, high
sodium foods.
In fact, the health reasons for
avoiding fast food restaurants are
plentiful — for instance, sodium
intake is linked with high blood
pressure, and fat intake is linked
with heart disease and certain
forms of cancer.
However, the restaurants are
convenient, and the food is appeal
ing to many people — so the rav
ings of Daily health columnists
aren't likely to stop the trend.
But with a little foresight, and
a few tips, you can convert a
potentially health-threatening

fast food diet into one with ade
quate nutritional value.
While occasionally eating at a
fast food restaurant will by no
means have a marked effect on
your health, frequent or regular
visits can — and usually do —
result in a diet high in saturated
fat, cholesterol, sodium and sugar,
while inadequate in fiber and
many essential vitamins and min
erals.
In an average fast food meal,
40-60 percent of the calories come
from fat — mainly saturated fat
— which is linked to heart disease.
And while fat is an essential part
of a balanced diet, fat intake is not
recommended to exceed 30 per
cent of an individual's diet.
Women are recommended to
maintain a dietary intake of
approximately 1,500-1,800 calo
ries, with approximately 270-540
calories coming from fat. Men,
while consuming a recommended
2,400-2,800 calories per day, are
urged to keep fat calories within
300 and 800 per day.
Sodium intake is not recom
mended to exceed 3,000 mil
ligrams, and 1,000 mg per 1,000
calories ingested is a good guide
line to follow.
An average fast food meal of a
cheeseburger, fries and a choco
late shake at McDonald's, how
ever, tallies in at 1,125 calories, 52

grams (468 calories) of fat and
1,500 mg of sodium. A McDLT
alone packs a whopping 674 calo
ries, with 378 of them coming
from fat.
The ingredients, as well as the
method of preparation employed
by fast food establishments, are
largely to blame for the high-fat
meals they offer.
In addition to using a great deal
of cheese and mayonnaise, most of
these restaurants deep-fry foods,
often using highly saturated beef
fat, which contains high levels of
cholesterol.
However, your selections can
shape the caloric and fat content
of your meal, and you can concoct
a relatively healthy meal at most
restaurants.
When trying to order health
fully, your first impulse may be to
order chicken or fish — "white"
meats that are traditionally lower
in fat and calories than red meat.
However, these meats, when
served in a fast food restaurant,
are usually prepared in a coat of
batter, which soaks up the oil it is
fried in, causing the fat content to
soar, often well above the amount
in a comparable hamburger or
roast beef sandwich.
If fried chicken or fish is your
only option, such as at Kentucky
Fried Chicken or Long John Sil
ver's, your best bet is to order reg
ular, instead of extra crispy vari
eties, as crispy choices are fried
longer, and soak up more fat.
Also — if you can bring your
self to violate a social norm — peel
off the fried skin and you'll
remove most of the fat.
When available, a roast chicken

sandwich is usually your healthi
est option at such restaurants,
and choosing mashed potatoes
(often available at chicken and
fish restaurants) over french fries
will cut about 200 calories and 9
grams (54 calories) of fat.
If fast food restaurants are syn
onymous with burgers for you,
your best bet, health-wise, is to
opt for single hamburgers (even if
you order several of them) over
double cheeseburgers or 'special'
burgers like Big Macs, which are
heavy on mayo, special sauce and
cheese.
Cheese adds 100 calories —
mostly fat — to the sandwich and
holding the mayo will save you
about 150 calories in fat.
One of your best choices in fast
food, healthwise, is restaurants
serving Mexican food. Bean burri
tos and soft tacos are good low-fat,
high-fiber choices.
A bean burrito at Taco Bell, for
instance, has 359 calories, with 99
calories derived from fat, and a
soft taco averages 228 calories
with 108 calories from fat.
The truth is, you're probably
better off avoiding fast food alto
gether, but if you're addicted, or
forced by circumstance to eat at
these restaurants, following these
rules of thumb should help sal
vage your health.
By the way, there are also a
host of environmental reasons to
avoid fast food — however, that is
a story for another day.

you. In fact, you might even eiyoy
it for that very reason.
Indeed, the health implications
of the American fast food diet are
disturbing, as the menus are filled
with high-calorie, high-fat, high
sodium foods.
In fact, the health reasons for
avoiding fast food restaurants are
plentiful — for instance, sodium
intake is linked with high blood
pressure, and fat intake is linked
with heart disease and certain
forms of cancer.
However, the restaurants are
convenient, and the food is appeal
ing to many people — so the rav
ings of Daily health columnists
aren't likely to stop the trend.
But with a little foresight, and
a few tips, you can convert a
potentially health-threatening

fast food diet into one with ade
quate nutritional value.
While occasionally eating at a
fast food restaurant will by no
means have a marked effect on
your health, frequent or regular
visits can — and usually do —
result in a diet high in saturated
fat, cholesterol, sodium and sugar,
while inadequate in fiber and
many essential vitamins and min
erals.
In an average fast food meal,
40-60 percent of the calories come
from fat — mainly saturated fat
— which is linked to heart disease.
And while fat is an essential part
of a balanced diet, fat intake is not
recommended to exceed 30 per
cent of an individual's diet.
Women are recommended to
maintain a dietary intake of
approximately 1,500-1,800 calo
ries, with approximately 270-540
calories coming from fat. Men,
while consuming a recommended
2,400-2,800 calories per day, are
urged to keep fat calories within
300 and 800 per day.
Sodium intake is not recom
mended to exceed 3,000 mil
ligrams, and 1,000 mg per 1,000
calories ingested is a good guide
line to follow.
An average fast food meal of a
cheeseburger, fries and a choco
late shake at McDonald's, how
ever, tallies in at 1,125 calories, 52

grams (468 calories) of fat and
1,500 mg of sodium. A McDLT
alone packs a whopping 674 calo
ries, with 378 of them coming
from fat.
The ingredients, as well as the
method of preparation employed
by fast food establishments, are
largely to blame for the high-fat
meals they offer.
In addition to using a great deal
of cheese and mayonnaise, most of
these restaurants deep-fry foods,
often using highly saturated beef
fat, which contains high levels of
cholesterol.
However, your selections can
shape the caloric and fat content
of your meal, and you can concoct
a relatively healthy meal at most
restaurants.
When trying to order health
fully, your first impulse may be to
order chicken or fish — "white"
meats that are traditionally lower
in fat and calories than red meat.
However, these meats, when
served in a fast food restaurant,
are usually prepared in a coat of
batter, which soaks up the oil it is
fried in, causing the fat content to
soar, often well above the amount
in a comparable hamburger or
roast beef sandwich.
If fried chicken or fish is your
only option, such as at Kentucky
Fried Chicken or Long John Sil
ver's, your best bet is to order reg
ular, instead of extra crispy vari
eties, as crispy choices are fried
longer, and soak up more fat.
Also — if you can bring your
self to violate a social norm — peel
off the fried skin and you'll
remove most of the fat.
When available, a roast chicken

sandwich is usually your healthi
est option at such restaurants,
and choosing mashed potatoes
(often available at chicken and
fish restaurants) over french fries
will cut about 200 calories and 9
grams (54 calories) of fat.
If fast food restaurants are syn
onymous with burgers for you,
your best bet, health-wise, is to
opt for single hamburgers (even if
you order several of them) over
double cheeseburgers or 'special'
burgers like Big Macs, which are
heavy on mayo, special sauce and
cheese.
Cheese adds 100 calories —
mostly fat — to the sandwich and
holding the mayo will save you
about 150 calories in fat.
One of your best choices in fast
food, healthwise, is restaurants
serving Mexican food. Bean burri
tos and soft tacos are good low-fat,
high-fiber choices.
A bean burrito at Taco Bell, for
instance, has 359 calories, with 99
calories derived from fat, and a
soft taco averages 228 calories
with 108 calories from fat.
The truth is, you're probably
better off avoiding fast food alto
gether, but if you're addicted, or
forced by circumstance to eat at
these restaurants, following these
rules of thumb should help sal
vage your health.
By the way, there are also a
host of environmental reasons to
avoid fast food — however, that is
a story for another day.

It's 10 at night and your 5 p.m.
Food Service dinner has just worn
off.
Your stomach growls. You and
your roommate exchange know
ing glances. Simultaneously, the
two of you jump up, grab your
keys and head to college students'
eatery of choice: the fast food
restaurant.
Maybe tonight it will be
McDonalds; or Jack-in-the-Box;
or, for a touch of cultural cuisine,
perhaps Taco Bell.
And you aren't alone; fast food
is a quickly growing trend in
America. Fourty percent of U.S.
restaurant revenues now go to
fast food establishments, and U.S.
consumers spend an average of
$200/ year on fast food.
