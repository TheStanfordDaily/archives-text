# New process helps identify disease-causing bacteria
## 
### Chris Patil Staff writer 
A new technique for identi
fying elusive bacteria has been
used to characterize the organ
ism responsible for bacillary
angiomatosis, an illness that
attacks patients with immune
deficiencies like AIDS.
Bacillary angiomatosis most
commonly causes red, nodular
lesions on the skin, but it may
also affect the lymph nodes,
spleen, liver or bone marrow.
The bacterium responsible
has never before been identi
fied, but it is closely related to
Rochalimaea Quintana, an
organism which caused the dis
ease known as "trench fever"
in World Wars I and 11.
Knowledge of the organ
ism's genetic similarity to
another bacterium gives
researchers clues about how it
actually causes the disease —
and how to combat it when it
does.
"Knowing that the bac
terium is related to R. Quin
tana allows us to predict what
kinds of antibiotics will be use
ful in treating this disease,"
said Stanford postdoctoral fel
low David Relman, lead author
of the study. "Already a couple
of effective antibiotics have
been found by empirical meth
ods, and they are antibiotics we
would have predicted to be use
ful because R. Quintana is sen
sitive to them."
Now that a gene sequence is
known for the bacterium that
causes angiomatosis, research
ers may be able to develop a
diagnostic test for the disease.
Such a test would be especially
useful because the skin lesions
accompanying the disease can
be mistaken for those caused
by Kaposi's sarcoma, another
opportunistic infection that
affects AIDS patients.
A genetic diagnostic test
would work even in those cases
where there are no externally
visible symptoms, and could

eliminate the confusion some
times present in clinical diag
nosis of the disease.
When attempting to charac
terize a new bacterium, scien
tists focus on the genes respon
sible for producing ribosomes,
cellular organelles whose func
tions differ greatly between dif
ferent species.

Knowledge of the
organism's genetic
similarity to another
bacterium gives
researchers clues
about how it actual
ly causes the dis
ease — and how to
combat it when it
does.

Previously, researchers try
ing to perform such genetic
classification needed to isolate
the bacteria and grow them in
culture in order to provide
enough DNA for analysis.
Because scientists have been
unable to culture the angio
matosis bacteria, traditional
means of characterization have
proven unworkable.
The new procedure, how
ever, can amplify bacterial ribo
somal DNA without first isolat
ing the disease-causing
organisms.
Scientists can use enzymes
to extract the DNA from a sam
ple of infected human tissue,
and then apply a technique
called PCR (polymerase chain
reaction) to amplify greatly the
bacterial ribosomal DNA.
Researchers can subse
quently use the large amounts
of ribosomal DNA produced —
PCR can amplify segments of
DNA by as much as a trillion
times — to identify and charac
terize the organism.
