# Mac lovers flock to San Francisco
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
If the Macintosh aficionados in your dorm
or office appear to be foaming at the mouth or
champing at the bit this week, don't worry.
Their overactive endocrine systems are
charged up because the annual Macworld
Exposition begins tomorrow at the Moscone
Center in San Francisco. From the time the
doors open at 3 p.m. until Sunday afternoon,
the mecca for Mac maniacs will be Moscone.
Virtually every major developer of hardware
and software will be in attendance to show off
their latest and greatest.
News from the rumor mill suggests there
won't be many major announcements this
time around; i.e. no new CPUs from Apple,
nothing as revolutionary as the laser printer.
But the evolutionary changes promise to inter
est and intrigue those with special needs that
aren't currently being met.
As always, Apple Computer itself will be the
biggest exhibitor in this event sponsored by
Macworld magazine. The company will show
off the low-cost trio of the Classic, LC and Ilsi,
all of which are exceeding sales expectations by
a wide margin. In the face of a potentially dev
astating recession, the kids from Cupertino are

sitting pretty
with the cheap
est Macs ever.
On the tech
nology front,
rumors are that
Apple will an
nounce, if not
actually release,
a new line of
inexpensive Eth-

ernet products.
High-speed networking will now be available
for the rest of us because, simply through
showing up, Apple will force other vendors to
cut a hefty slice off their prices.
Most visitors, though, will attend simply to
window-shop. Perhaps they'll find a piece of
software they didn't know existed which fills a
need perfectly. Better still, seek out a vendor
whose product you own but are finding it
doesn't perform the way you expected. Mac
world gives you that rare opportunity to talk
face to face with a company rep.
Oftentimes, I've been able to get those
"unanswerable" questions answered, those
"unsolvable" problems solved at Macworld. If
something is giving you major trouble, it
might be worth the $25 price of admission to

give the show a look-see.

One of the big surprises of the Christmas
season was that Apple shipped the LC. Origi
nal estimates had the LC shipping no sooner
than late this month — or perhaps even in
March.
Instead, 100 showed up at the Bookstore
during finals week and several local dealers got
a bunch in. Unfortunately, as with the Classic,
they don't yet know when the next shipment is
due.(The Ilsi, incidentally, is shipping in vol
ume.)
My reaction upon seeing the LC pretty
much mirrors what I said when it was
announced. Power users will stay away in
droves because it lacks the 68030 chip neces
sary for speed and full exploitation of the still
unreleased System 7.0. Everyone else will love
it for its tiny size, minuscule weight, Mac II
power and color capability.
For under two grand you can walk off with
an LC and the imperfect-but-still-beautiful 12-
inch Apple color monitor. An excellent deal.

Mark Rogowsky is The Daily's computer sys
tems manager. His friend Saul still wants him
to send some software to Brooklyn.
