Safe sex?
What? No one has sex at
Stanford?
Well, surely some people
must â€” and since those who do
are intelligent and informed
individuals, they certainly
must be having safe sex.
But for those consenting
individuals who are selecting a
form of contraception to use,
new research may play into
their decision-making process.
The use of diaphragms or
condoms with spermicide has
been shown to correlate
strongly with the development
of severe urinary tract infec
tions in women.
According to research per
formed by Dr. Thomas Hooten
of the Department of Medicine
at the University of Washing
ton-Harborview Medical Cen
ter in Seattle, the prevalence of
E. Coli bacteria increased dra
matically after intercourse in
women using both foam and a
condom or a diaphragm and
spermicide; a slight increase
was observed in individuals
using oral contraception.
This bacterial colonization
may lead to urinary tract infec
tions, and it has been esti
mated that diaphragm-spermi
cide use may contribute to the
causation of one-third of the
more than five million episodes
of acute infections that occur

annually in this country.
But remember oral contra
ception cannot prevent you
from contracting AIDS.
And only you can prevent
forest fires.
Higher highs?
If your means of avoiding a
hangover involves taking
aspirin before drinking, you
may be surprised by an unex
pected side effect. New
research indicates that aspirin,
when taken on a full stomach,
can make you more drunk.
While this may be a happy
coincidence for those who are
seeking such an effect, the
increase in intoxication can be
deadly serious for those who
plan on drinking moderately
and then driving, as it can
cause greater reaction impair
ment than one would expect
from the amount of alcohol
consumed.
In a test performed on men,
the intake of aspirin before
alcohol boosted their peak level
of Blood Alcohol Content
(BAC) by approximately 34
percent.
Also, after aspirin, the BAC
rose more rapidly and
remained elevated longer after
the aspirin dose.
The effects of aspirin and
EANABS has yet to be deter
mined.
