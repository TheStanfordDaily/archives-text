# Cowell opens pharmacy to meet drug demand
## 
### Kaarin Michaelson Staff writer 
Numerous student requests for
a convenient place to fill prescrip
tions have prompted Cowell Stu
dent Health Center to establish its
own pharmacy.
The pharmacy, located on the
first floor of Cowell, officially
opened during the first week of
December and will be "available
both to fill prescriptions and to
provide drug and health informa
tion to students," according to
John Hanley, director of phar
macy services at Cowell.
Most medications prescribed by
the physicians at Cowell can be
obtained directly from the phar
macy, but due to a limited formu
lary of 120 drugs, not all prescrip
tions can be filled at Cowell. Pre
scriptions from physicians outside
Cowell will also be honored, pro
vided the drug required is in
stock, Hanley said.
The prices of medications are
"competitive with the prices at
other pharmacies outside Stan
ford, like Long's and Walgreen's,"

said Hanley. Prescriptions at Cow
ell can be filled in about 20 min
utes and can also be called in to be
picked up at a later time.
The new pharmacy will also be
taking over the sale and distribu
tion of all contraceptives, a job
previously handled by Cowell
staff
"The original impetus to create
a pharmacy at Cowell came from
the surveys that students have
filled out over the past two years.
The results showed that a phar
macy was the most requested ser
vice that we didn't already offer,"
said Jane Meier, associate director
of student health services.
According to Meier, there are
no plans to expand the phar
macy's size so that it could serve
the larger Stanford community.
Meier said the money the phar
macy takes in will be used to pay
for the costs of running it.
The pharmacy "has been very
well utilized since it opened. Stu
dents have been finding it fast and
convenient to use, and that's what
we were hoping for when we
planned it," Meier said.
