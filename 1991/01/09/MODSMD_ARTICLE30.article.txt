In a tune-up for their regular season
opener, the Stanford men's volleyball
team impressively defeated a club squad
from California last night at Burnham
Pavilion.
The Cardinal dominated the match
from the outset, sweeping three games
from the Bears with scores of 15-4,15-5,
and 15-7.

The game did not count toward Stan
ford's regular season record, as Califor
nia is only a club team, not sanctioned
by the NCAA.
Coach Ruben Nieves, taking over this
year for Fred Sturm, who left to coach
the U.S. National Team, said he didn't
expect his team to have such an easy
time with California. The Bears are the
two-time defending national club cham
pions and last year gave the Cardinal a
scare, taking the match to five games.
Setter Canyon Ceman, a 6-foot-4
freshman from Pacific Palisades,
sparkled in his Stanford debut. His pin
point setting and quick-hit winners in
the first set led the team to an early 8-4
lead. The Cardinal then finished ofT the
set with seven unanswered points.
In the second set, California opened
much stronger and trailed only 7-5 early
on. But Stanford capitalized on a multi
tude of Bear service errors and the out
side hitting of Jimmy Klein to pull away
for a 15-5 victory.
Substitutes roamed the floor for both
squads in the third game, and the Cardi
nal subs jumped to an early lead with
eight unanswered points. The Bears, on
the strength of blocking by 6-foot-5
freshman Chris Betters, closed to
within three points at 10-7.
But Stanford witheld California's
late challenge and closed out the match
with five straight points behind the
thunderous hitting of Duncan Black
man, who led the team with a .600 hit
ting percentage.

In many ways, this weekend's tournament
could be a microcosm of the Cardinal's sea
son. Aside from the fact that most of the
teams involved will be doing a lot of experi
mentation and self-examination, the mere
concentration of such high-caliber teams
resembles painfully Stanford's own schedule.

Klein, who led the team with 15 kills,
and John Bezmalinovic (.429 hitting)
contributed to the Cardinal's efficient
night at the net. Mike Lowe and Bob
Hillman added to the attack with .375
and .308 hitting percentages respec
tively.
Nieves said that after tonight's game
it was difficult to judge his team's play.
All that will change this weekend, how
ever, when Stanford will travel to Santa
Barbara for the UCSB Collegiate Clas
sic.
The sixth-ranked Cardinal will open
its season by playing eight matches in
two days against the nation's top
schools. The country's four highest
ranked teams — USC, UCLA, Long
Beach State, and Cal-State Northridge,
respectively — will be in action in Santa
Barbara, as will Calgary and British
Columbia, two of the top Canadian
teams.
Obviously, Nieves said, his team will
get an excellent idea of where they stand
after facing top-line competition in the
tournament.
He also looks to the tournament as
an opportunity for the Cardinal to
showcase one of its greatest strenghts,
its depth. "We are fortunate in the
respect that our talent really doesn't
drop off after the starting six," Nieves
said.
"We have a lot of depth at all three
positions — setter, middle blocker, and
outside swinger," he added. Nieves said
he was looking forward to using that

depth in Friday and Saturday's strenu
ous eight-game schedule.
In many ways, this weekend's tour
nament could be a microcosm of the
Cardinal's season. Aside from the fact
that most of the teams involved will be
doing a lot of experimentation and self
examination, the mere concentration of
such high-caliber teams painfully
resembles Stanford's own schedule.
The Cardinal plays in the WIVA, far
and away the most powerful volleyball
conference in the country. So powerful
that last year when UC-Irvine was 1-11,
the Anteaters were ranked No. 17 in the
country.
So powerful that a certain preseason
No. 1 team finished out of the top five.
The fact is, there is no such thing as
a sure victory in the WTVA. The teams
are simply too strong. Stanford will
have to play top-notch, mistake-free vol
leyball in virtually every match.
One minor fault Nieves saw in his
team's play against California was a
slight lack of communication, an under
standble problem at the outset of the
season. But he expects the Collegiate
Classic to help remedy the situation.
"Playing so many games in such a
short period of time is inevitably going
to lead to our playing more 'together as
a team.' We should be able to anticipate
each other's actions a lot better," he
said.
After the Classic, the Cardinal will
return home to face Loyola Marymount
on January 19.
