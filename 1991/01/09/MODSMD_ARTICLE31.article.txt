# Who needs playoffs?
## 
### 
Oh, no! We've got two national
champions, the first indecisive
championship since 1978! Both
Colorado and Georgia Tech can claim to
be Number One. Whatever is marketing
going to do with all those T-shirts they
printed up? Add "co" to champions? Sell
them anyway?

Those stupid coaches and sportswrit
ere. Can't even come up with a unani
mous champion. Figures. And what
right do they have to vote anyway?
They're only the ones who conceive
game plans, watch every move of every
player, follow teams around the country,
and eat, breathe and sleep college foot
ball for four months. These are not the
people who should have such almighty
power to decree two national champions.
Let the players decide. They'll be fair,
of course. They're the ones who play all
those blasted games. Of course, any
team in a bowl game will vote for itself,
so it'll be up to players from Northwest
ern and Rice to decide who's the best of
the best.
Or better yet, institute a play-off sys
tem. That'll definitely come up with a
decisive winner. Just like the Final Four.
It'll be tlj|e top, oh say 16, battling it out
for that coveted trophy (and all the side
benefits that accompany it). So everyone
make their plane reservations. It's off to
the Super Dome to watch seven games of
college football. Whee!
Or not.
Maybe playoffs is the way to go with
basketball, but it would be a total disas
ter for college football.
Let's say the playoff was limited to 16
teams (or the championship game would
collide with the College World Series).
How do you pick football's top 16? By
their win-loss records? Most teams only
play 11 games, not the 28 played by col
lege hoops teams. By their schedules? Bv
their names? What's to say the 17th
team isn't actuallv the best, but had a
couple of bad breaks in a few games?
You can't do it by giving one seed to
each conference winner. There are too
many conferences with too deep a lineup
(does the good ol' Pac-10 come to mind?)
and others with no one deserving. The
biggies, like Notre Dame, Miami and
Penn State would probably end up with
"automatic" berths, no matter their
records, leaving 98 teams to battle for
the eight or so remaining spots.

And even if this so-called national
championship was limited to only the 16
"best" teams, it would still drag on for
ever. Games aren't done until the first
week in December, then the schools
would need a couple of weeks off to sew
together limbs and perhaps allow the
guys to study (or sleep). Then we're
looking at four weeks of games (it's not
like basketball where you can play every
other day, you know). By this time it's
the middle of January and almost time
for the Super Bowl. And you can't con
flict with the Super Bowl\
Of course, letting the players study
for finals the second or third weeks in
December would be shot. I know we're
talking about the revenue-producing
sport, but aren't these college students
toiling on the gridiron? Aren't we sup
posed to be at least pretending they're at
school to get an education?
Keep the bowl system. Okay, so 19
bowl games (eight on New Year's
Day alone) is getting out of hand.
But what isn't in the world of American
Sports? Twenty-five million dollar base
ball contracts? Scalpers getting 1,000
dollars for a Final Four ticket?
And it's not like the NCAA hoops
tourney, upon which the football format
would be based, is fair to begin with. An
East Coast-biased selection committee
invites teams to compete — only selected
conference champions are given auto
matic berths — and teams the big shots
want for TV money are shoo-ins no mat
ter what their record.
Then the god-like group divides the
teams into four divisions of 16 — East,
Southeast, Midwest, and West. But the
squads in each division have nothing to
do with the monniker — teams are
seeded around the country depending on
how badly the committee wants it to get
to the finals. In 1985 three Big East
schools wound up in the Final Four —
Georgetown, Villanova and St. John's.
So what's with the farce of equality?
The bowl system doesn't try to be
equal — it only promises to give a fair
number of teams a chance for postsea
son play, and a shot at the national title.
Even Colorado coach Bill McCartney
told reporters after defeating Notre
Dame that he was "hoping" the voters
would see their way. There are no guar
antees, but 38 teams have a moment of
glory.
In defeating Wyoming on Dec. 31, Cal
won its first bowl game in 53 years. The
team was on top of the world. It didn't
matter that they had just won the Cop
per Bowl, not the national champi
onship. A postseason win is a postseason
win — and there are 19 victors, not just
one. Stanford will be more than happy to


Debbie
Spander
accept any invitation that comes
its way next year, even if there are
no roses attached.
And at least the current sys
tem carries a semblance of tradi
tion. That's what college football
is all about, right? You can get all
the playoff games you'd ever want
to see, and more, via the NFL and
its new, improved play-off system
that allows two more teams to
make the January cut (and the
league to bring in more bucks
from the expanded television
time). College football is autumn
Saturdays, school spirit and bowl
games. And controversy.
So what if there are two
national champions? It gives col
lege football lovers something to
debate until August.

Debbie Spander was the football
beat writer. She's bummed Stan
ford didn't get to take part in the
New Year's football tradition this
year but she'll be more than
happy to attend any bowl game
Stanford is invited to next season.
