# Sailors upset powerhouse teams
##

Amidst excellent competition this winter break,
the Cardinal sailing team finished in the top of the
fleets at both the Sugar Bowl and Rose Bowl regat
tas.
Stanford battled seven out of the top seventeen
nationally ranked teams at the 1990 Sugar Bowl
Intersectional, hosted by sixth-ranked Tulane Uni
versity.
Following Connecticut College's strong hold on
first, Stanford finished second, edging out the U.S.
Naval Academy by two points and even Tulane at
their home waters. Impressed with the second place
ranking, coach Blake Middleton said that he was
"especially excited to beat three of the top six (Navy,
Tulane and Charleston)."
Clinching second for Stanford were seniors Dave
Dowd and Paula Gani with fourth in A division, and
sophomore Brady Sih and senior Matt Dunbar in B
division. Sih and Dunbar powered to second in B,
despite the loss of a first-place tie.
Middleton beamed, calling it "Stanford's best per
formance in an out-of-district regatta in many
years."
The Stanford women's team garnered an equally
impressive second at the women's Sugar Bowl, tak
ing second to a powerhouse Navy. In A division,
Haley King, sailing with both Marina Kimball and
Jen Yeh, finished second. B division partners Cather
ine Ivey and Amy Lightner took a second place as
well.
The women expected Navy's domination, as head
ing into this regatta Navy's women were the only
two ranked teams.
Held at the site of this year's nationals, the Sugar
Bowl was a great opportunity for practice for both
the Stanford coed and women's teams.
In January the Cardinal headed to the 1991 Rose
Bowl Intersectional in Alomitos Bay, Calif., hosted
by both USC and UC-Irvine. The regatta was clearly
dominated by three top teams — UC-Irvine, Stan
ford and Navy.
At home, Irvine cruised past the fleet, leaving
Navy and Stanford to battle for second and third.
Unfortunately, unlike the Sugar Bowl, Stanford
struggled but finished following Navy's second place
by three points overall.
Stanford seniors Rick Rosen and Rebecca Bryson
dominated Navy's skipper in A division. In B, Sih
and Dunbar sailed strongly to third, but with the
Navy skipper clearly ahead.

The Cardinal sailing team traveled south to the Crescent City, where
they beat, among others, No. 6 Tulane — on the Green Wave's own
waters.
