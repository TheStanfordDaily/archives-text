PERTH, Australia (AP) — Janet
Evans and Matt Biondi, America's stars
of the 1986 Olympics and now hoping to
spark a U.S. comeback in the World
Swimming Championships, eased into
the finals Wednesday of events in which
they are world rcord-holders.
With the pre-tournament favorite
American team holding just one gold
medal after two days in the pool, Evans
qualified for Wednesday night's

women's 400-meter freestyle in 4 min
utes, 14.64 seconds.
The triple-gold-medalist at Seoul was
the second-fastest in heats, behind Aus
tralia's teen-age star Hayley Lewis, who
was timed in 4:13.16. Lewis beat Evans
for the gold medal in the 200 freestyle
Tuesday night, depriving the U.S. team
of an expected victory.
Evans beat Lewis by five seconds in
the 400 in last summer's Goodwill
Games. She set the world record of
4:03.85 at Seoul.
The second American in the 400 field,

Katv Arris, failed to qualify at 4:18.51,
as did Julie McDonald, the Australian
team captain ranked third in the world
behind Evans and Lewis. She was timed
in 4:18.37.
Biondi, winner of five Olympic golds
at Seoul, dominated the heats in the
men's 100 freestyle just as he has the
event for the last five years.
He was the only swimmer in seven
heats to crack the 60-second barrier,
going 49.59 in the last group and pulling
Stephan Caron, a relative
unknown from France, to the sec
ond-fastest time, 50.34. Biondi's
world record is 48.42, and he won
the world title in 1986 with a
meet-record 48.94.
Tommy Werner of Sweden, sec
ond to Biondi in the world rank
ings, qualified third with Shaun
Jordan of the United States fifth,
at 50.48.
The United States also got two
qualifiers in the women's 100
backstroke, although they won't
be favorites when the final comes
around.
Kristina Egerszegi, one of the
youngest members of a powerful
Hungarian team that has pro
duced the first two world records
of the championships, topped
qualifiers in 1:01.92. Teammate
Tunde Szabo was next at 1:02.54.
Janie Wagstaff (1:03.05) and
Jodi Wilson (1:03.91), swimming
side by side in Heat 3, qualified
fourth and eighth in an event that
lost its top-ranked swimmer when
American Betsy Mitchell retired
to become a college coach late last
year.
Jeff Rouse, the top American
men's backstroker who will be
among the favorites when the 100
is contested, qualified a distant
seventh for the 200 back. His
2:02.61 was almost two seconds
behind qualifying leader Martin
Lopez Zubro of Spain, at 2:00.73.
The second American in the
event, James Sharp, was elimi

nated at 2:03.90.
Germany, which won the
women's 800 freestyle relay on
Monday when the United States
was disqualified for an early start,
qualified fastest for the 400 relay,
at 3:46.15.
The U.S. quartet of Jenny
Thompson, Lynn Kohl, Ashley
Tappin and Whitney Hedgepeth
was second-fastest, .34 seconds
ofT the pace. Nicole Haislett, the
100 freestyle gold medalist who
drew the disqualification in the
800 relay, and Julie Cooper are
expected to replace Kohl and
Hedgepeth in the final.
If these have not been Amer
ica's championships, they cer
tainly have been good so far for
the Hungarians and the host Aus
tralians.
Tuesday's program was a case
in point. On a cool, windy night at
the Superdrome, Hungary got its
second world-record performance
in as many days, this one from
Tamas Darnyi in the men's 400
individual medley, and the wave
performing home crowd got to yell
itself hoarse for the first Aus
tralian gold medalist, Lewis.
Darnyi, who has held the world
record in the men's 400 individual
medley since August 1987,
knocked an amazing 2.39 seconds
off the mark, lowering it to
4:12.36.
"If the conditions had been
better, I could have gone one to
one and a half seconds faster," he
said.
Instead of the expected two or
even three golds, the United
States was shut out, with only sil
ver medals from Evans and the

mens' 800 freestyle relay team.
"Our best days are yet to
come," Evans said. "We had a few
disappointments [Monday] night
but we know we swam really farit
in the [women's] 800 relay. We're
doing OK."
At this point in the last world
championships four years ago, the
United States also had just one
gold medal in swimming — Pablo
Morales in the men's 100 butter
fly then, Haislett in the women's
100 freestyle now. The Americans
went on to win seven golds and
retain the men's team title.
But the '86 team was relatively
weak; this edition was supposed
to be a superteam. It's looked any
thing but that so far, but it could
get a boost today when Evans will
be favored in the women's 400
freestyle and Matt Biondi will be
the prohibitive pick in the men's
100 freestyle.
Eric Namesnik followed Darnyi
home in American-record time of
4:15.21, .36 seconds better than
the mark he already had lowered
twice this season.
"It's good enough," said
Namesnik, who trailed Darnyi
through the final three strokes
and never had a chance once the
final freestyle leg started. "I tried
to catch him but he was too far
ahead."
Dave Wharton, who lost the
world record to Darnyi but had
been rated an outside shot at vic
tory, was sixth in 4:20.19.
Haislett, the 17-year-old
Floridian who cost the U.S.
women's relay team victory when
she left to a soon the night before,
was the favorite in the women's

200 freestyle. But Lewis, a year
J ounger and the swimming star of
ast year's Commonwealth
Games, came through in an out
side lane to win in 2:00.48, with
Haislett fourth..
"I could really hear the crowd
in the last 15 meters, when I
turned my head to breathe," she
said. "Then I just put my head
down and went for it."
Lewis said she considered not
racing the final after turning in
the slowest qualifying time but
changed her mind when her
coaches told her she could win.
Biondi, the star of the U.S.
Olympic swim team in Seoul, had
a rematch with Olympic con
queror Anthony Nesty in the 100-
butterfly, a race the American said
he had been aiming for. It turned
out to be an Olympic battle, all
right, but not between those.
Nesty beat 1984 Olympic
champion Michael Gross by the
length of a wrist, 53.29-53.31,
with a late charge as Biondi came
in sixth at 53.97. Mark Henderson
of the United States was fourth,
at 53.88.
"Whether it's .01 or .02, I'll
take what I can get," Nesty, from
Surinam, said. "I would see Gross
out of the corner of my eye, but I
wasn't aware of Biondi at all."
Gross then completed the big
zero in the U.S. win column.
He took a lead of .88 seconds
from teammate Stefan Pfleffer
into the final leg of the men's 800
freestyle relay. America's Doug
Gjertsen, with a personal best of
1:47.97 for 200 meters, was to his

right, and the United States had a
final shot at victory.
But Gross had been beaten
twice in this event, by the United
States in the 1984 Olympics and
the East Germans at the '86 world
champions, and he would not set
tle for a third runner-up medal.
He charged through the final
laps in 1:46.86, the fifth-fastest
200 relay split ever, outgunning
Gjertsen's personal-best effort of
1:47.35 for his fourth world
championship gold medal in a
meet-record 7:13.50, 1.37 second
ahead of the Americans.
"It is fantastic to be world
champion in the 800 meters,"
said Gross, who swims the 200
butterfly on Saturday. "I have
been aiming for that since 1984."
The only race the United
States entered that night with no
hopes of winning was the
women's 200 breaststroke. Elena
Volkova, the Goodwill Games
champion from the Soviet Union,
won in 2:29.58.
Both American entries, Mary
Ellen Blanchard and Jill Johnson,
were eliminated in morning heats.
The United States got its sec
ond gold medal of the champi
onships when twins Karen and
Sarah Josephson won the syn
chronized swimming duet with a
world-best score of 199.762
points.
Olympic silver medalist Tan
Liangde led qualifying for the
men's 3-meter springboard div
ing. Americans Kent Ferguson
and Mark Bradshwa also reached
Wednesday's final.
