### David Bianco Editorial staff 
With only five months left in the ASSU electoral
year, deputy senate chair George McKinney
announced Monday that he will resign, effective Jan.
24.
Citing "personal and financial changes in my
life," McKinney wrote in a letter to his fellow sena
tors that he could not longer fulfill his responsibili
ties.
McKinney, a sophomore, said he plans to continue
his work as a regular senator, and that readjusting
his responsibilities would allow him to spend more
time with his senatorial tasks, particularly with the
dorm representatives program.
McKinney's fellow student leaders expressed
regret at his resignation."He worked incredibly
hard, and I'm really sad that he has to resign," said
Council of Presidents member Jamie Green, a
senior.
The deputy senate chair position draws a $2,000 a
year salary, which McKinney estimated at about
$4.50 an hour. The responsibilities include prepara
tion of agenda packets for senate meetings, main
taining files and conducting training sessions for the
senators. "I do whatever is internal to the operations

Fellow senator Naomi Onaga said
replacing McKinney would be dif
ficult. 'He did a really good job.
He was very responsible. I think it
will be hard to find someone to
replace him because everybody's
really busy.'

of the senate," McKinney said.
The newly created vacancy will probably be filled
at the second senate meeting of the quarter on Jan.
24, he said.
But fellow senator Naomi Onaga, a senior who
had originally planned to run for the position last
May, said replacing McKinney would be difficult.
"He did a really good job. He was very responsible. I
think it will be hard to find someone to replace him
because everybody's really busy."
Onaga also said she thought the salary for the
position was too low to attract people to put in the
necessary hours.
