# Substance over Style
## Sher defies the political stereotypes â€” and voters elect him over and over 
### Alison Russell 
Integrity in politicians may be an old-fashioned
concept, but it's why voters keep returning to
office state Assembly member Byron Sher, D-Palo
Alto, according to his colleagues and friends.
Even those on the opposite side of the political
aisle agree that one of Sher's most important
qualities is his trustworthiness. Chuck Quacken
bush, Republican assemblyman from District 22
in San Jose, says that although he and Sher have
different political backgrounds, "when Byron says
something I can trust him. That's the most
important attribute in Sacramento."
In his office at Stanford Law School, where he
teaches each fall during the Assembly recess, Sher
resembles a comfortable cross between lawyer
and professor, with his graying hair, beard and
dark suit, worn with a blue chambray shirt and
boldly patterned tie.
Sher was returned to the District 21 seat for a
sixth term this fall in an election marked by a
nationwide tide of feeling against incumbents. He
won an easy victory over his challenger, Eric Gar
ris, a libertarian running on the Republican
ticket.
Sher is reluctant to take credit for his popular
ity, saying only that the race didn't generate a lot
of interest, and that his opponent lacked visibility.
Also, he says,"the public s not ready for the legis
lation of drugs," one of the main points of Gams'
Slatform. Happy his constituents returned him to
acramento, Sher "is hoping they weren't too dis-

satisfied" with his record.
Such self-effacing comments
have contributed to recent media
portrayals of Sher as a humble do
gooder who hates the grime of pol
itics. "That is not accurate," Sher
says."I love politics. 1 don't think
you can be effective if you're not
interested in it."
"He's not humble," says
English Prof. Nancy Packer, a
friend of Sher and his wife of 32
years. "He knows he has a lot to
offer," she adds.
"He's a political animal,"
according to Gene Webb, professor
at the Graduate School of Busi
ness, who has known Sher for 15
years. Sher is "the antithesis of
the glib, facile, bullshitty kind of
politician," Webb says. "He's sort
of shy. He doesn't fit any stereo
type."
His quiet popularity in a pro
fession built on high profile
imagery comes partly from shared
interests with his constituents.
"Byron is incredibly successful in
maintaining his base among the
voters," Packer says.
He muses about his entry into
politics and public service. "I first
ran for president of my high
school class and came in third out
of four candidates," he remem
bers. "I've always enjoyed the
political fray."
A freeway proposal that "would
have cut Palo Alto in half' drew
Sher into the city's politics in the
19605. He had a personal interest,
he says, because the proposed
freeway would have run through
Cowper Street, where he lived at
the time.
A compromise was reached
with the construction of the Ore
gon Expressway which, Sher
wryly notes, still managed to
divide the city.
But Sher was hooked. Two
years later, in 1965, the group he
had been working with against
the freeway urged him to run for
Palo Alto City Council. Thus
began a long career in local poli
tics, with two terms as council
member and two terms as mayor,
ending in 1979.
"Those were quite turbulent
times, as a matter of fact," he
says. The population of Palo Alto
was "in transition," Sher
explains, with "residentialists"
fighting the pro-growth "estab

lishment" for control of the city's
future.
When Sher came onto the
council,"it had been a long time
since University people had run
for office and been elected," he
says. Development at Stanford
created "a lot of hostility in the
60s. I was met by some suspicion
because of my University connec
tion," Sher says.
After the Stanford Shopping
Center was built, the University
"put in writing that further devel
opment would be in terms of fur
thering programs," which helped
smooth relations with the city,
according to Sher.

He "kind of gravitated towards
environmental issues" through
his work on the City Council.
Rapid development pushed the
environment to the forefront as
Palo Alto's baylands and foothills
became targets for growth. Sher
received increasing attention as
he fought to preserve the city's
limited natural habitats.
First elected to the state
Assembly in 1980, Sher quickly
became known as "Mr. Environ
ment" in Sacramento because of
his deep commitment to conserva
tion. "Byron Sher is one of the
most important leaders in Califor
nia for protecting the environ
ment," says Cory Brown of the
Sacramento-based Planning and
Conservation League. As chair of
the Assembly Committee on Nat
ural Resources, Sher has "consis
tently defeated attempts to
weaken California's existing laws
protecting the environment," as
well as drafting some of the
toughest pro-environment legisla
tion in the country, says Brown.

Topping the list of Sher's
accomplishments are a 1983 act
cleaning up leaking underground
tanks, enactment of the 1988 Cal
ifornia Clean Air Act, a bill in
1989 establishing stringent limits
on the amount of toxins in drink
ing water and a 1989 act mandat
ing that cities and counties reduce
or recycle one-half of their solid
waste by the year 2000.
Sher has had to learn to deal
with competing interests and has
a recognized knack for mediation
and compromise. Responding to
criticism of Sher for being too
open to negotiation, Brown says,
"He sees what can be done and

works to achieve what can be
accomplished."
Packer agrees. "Politics is the
art of the possible," she says,"and
as a politician he has to find the
possible. He's a practical person."
Characterizing Sher as "very pro
fessional," Quackenbush says,
"it's easy for someone to be a left
wing radical voting 'yes' on every
liberal bill, or a right-wing nut
voting 'no' on everything, but the
work is done in the middle."
Passage in November of Propo
sition 140, the California term
limits initiative, means that Sher
will have to leave his present
office in six years. "One of the
most unfortunate aspects of
Proposition 140," says Brown, "is
that the really good people like
Byron are subjected to a law that
doesn't work. Byron is a good
example of why legislative experi
ence is important in protecting
the public's interest."
Does the law allow for Sher to
seek other elected office? "Abso
lutely!" Sher says. "State Senate,

Congress, anything else." While
he says he'll put off thinking
about it "until next year," Sher
adds, "The truthful answer to
that is that every person in elected
office will be thinking about how
it fits into their career plans."
Future environmental legisla
tion may fare better with Gover
nor-elect Pete Wilson than it has
with outgoing Governor George
Deukmejian, according to Sher.
"Pete Wilson has a pretty good
environmental record. When he
was in the Assembly he carried
legislation to protect the coast,"
Sher says. Deukmejian, on the
other hand, "was not a friend of
the Coastal Commission. He tried
to starve it fiscally," says Sher.
Deukmejian also vetoed the
one bill of Sher's that critics hold
up as an embarrassment: the
banana slug bill of 1987. A Red
wood City Campfire Girls group
asked Sher to introduce the bill,
which would have made the bright
yellow creature "state mollusk."
Sher says he's "not ashamed"
of the bill, which he thinks had at
least as much merit as Assembly
member Quentin Kopp's legisla
tion making western swing the
state "official dance." Besides, he
says, following the slug bill gave
hundreds of schoolchildren a look
at "how ideas can get turned into
law, and how ideas can get
vetoed."
Sher and his wife, Linda,
divide their lives between Sacra
mento and Palo Alto, where they
moved from their Cowper Street
house to a condominium in 1983.
The Shers sold the house to a
young family after their own
three children had grown up.
Adrienne is an actress and mother
of a one-year-old daughter in
Sacramento; Benjamin is a
"writer and adventurer" now liv
ing in Africa; and Kate is a psy
chologist in San Francisco.
A social man, Sher is described
by Packer as "kind, human, funny
and very, very smart." To Webb,
Sher is "just a consistently lovable
person."
Sher is not a workaholic,
despite his deep commitment to
conserving California's environ
ment. He enjoys being outdoors,
swimming, tennis and going out
to restaurants and the theater
when he has the time. He loves
spending time with his grand
daughter.
But when asked what he thinks
is most fun, Sher has a single
answer: "Politics!"


Sher, often portrayed
as a humble do-good
er who hates the
grime of politics, says
that Is inaccurate. 'I
love politics. I don't
think you can be
effective if you're not
interested in it.'

ran for president of my high
school class and came in third out
of four candidates," he remem
bers. "I've always enjoyed the
political fray."
A freeway proposal that "would
have cut Palo Alto in half' drew
Sher into the city's politics in the
19605. He had a personal interest,
he says, because the proposed
freeway would have run through
Cowper Street, where he lived at
the time.
A compromise was reached
with the construction of the Ore
gon Expressway which, Sher
wryly notes, still managed to
divide the city.
But Sher was hooked. Two
years later, in 1965, the group he
had been working with against
the freeway urged him to run for
Palo Alto City Council. Thus
began a long career in local poli
tics, with two terms as council
member and two terms as mayor,
ending in 1979.
"Those were quite turbulent
times, as a matter of fact," he
says. The population of Palo Alto
was "in transition," Sher
explains, with "residentialists"
fighting the pro-growth "estab

lishment" for control of the city's
future.
When Sher came onto the
council,"it had been a long time
since University people had run
for office and been elected," he
says. Development at Stanford
created "a lot of hostility in the
60s. I was met by some suspicion
because of my University connec
tion," Sher says.
After the Stanford Shopping
Center was built, the University
"put in writing that further devel
opment would be in terms of fur
thering programs," which helped
smooth relations with the city,
according to Sher.

He "kind of gravitated towards
environmental issues" through
his work on the City Council.
Rapid development pushed the
environment to the forefront as
Palo Alto's baylands and foothills
became targets for growth. Sher
received increasing attention as
he fought to preserve the city's
limited natural habitats.
First elected to the state
Assembly in 1980, Sher quickly
became known as "Mr. Environ
ment" in Sacramento because of
his deep commitment to conserva
tion. "Byron Sher is one of the
most important leaders in Califor
nia for protecting the environ
ment," says Cory Brown of the
Sacramento-based Planning and
Conservation League. As chair of
the Assembly Committee on Nat
ural Resources, Sher has "consis
tently defeated attempts to
weaken California's existing laws
protecting the environment," as
well as drafting some of the
toughest pro-environment legisla
tion in the country, says Brown.

Topping the list of Sher's
accomplishments are a 1983 act
cleaning up leaking underground
tanks, enactment of the 1988 Cal
ifornia Clean Air Act, a bill in
1989 establishing stringent limits
on the amount of toxins in drink
ing water and a 1989 act mandat
ing that cities and counties reduce
or recycle one-half of their solid
waste by the year 2000.
Sher has had to learn to deal
with competing interests and has
a recognized knack for mediation
and compromise. Responding to
criticism of Sher for being too
open to negotiation, Brown says,
"He sees what can be done and

works to achieve what can be
accomplished."
Packer agrees. "Politics is the
art of the possible," she says,"and
as a politician he has to find the
possible. He's a practical person."
Characterizing Sher as "very pro
fessional," Quackenbush says,
"it's easy for someone to be a left
wing radical voting 'yes' on every
liberal bill, or a right-wing nut
voting 'no' on everything, but the
work is done in the middle."
Passage in November of Propo
sition 140, the California term
limits initiative, means that Sher
will have to leave his present
office in six years. "One of the
most unfortunate aspects of
Proposition 140," says Brown, "is
that the really good people like
Byron are subjected to a law that
doesn't work. Byron is a good
example of why legislative experi
ence is important in protecting
the public's interest."
Does the law allow for Sher to
seek other elected office? "Abso
lutely!" Sher says. "State Senate,

Congress, anything else." While
he says he'll put off thinking
about it "until next year," Sher
adds, "The truthful answer to
that is that every person in elected
office will be thinking about how
it fits into their career plans."
Future environmental legisla
tion may fare better with Gover
nor-elect Pete Wilson than it has
with outgoing Governor George
Deukmejian, according to Sher.
"Pete Wilson has a pretty good
environmental record. When he
was in the Assembly he carried
legislation to protect the coast,"
Sher says. Deukmejian, on the
other hand, "was not a friend of
the Coastal Commission. He tried
to starve it fiscally," says Sher.
Deukmejian also vetoed the
one bill of Sher's that critics hold
up as an embarrassment: the
banana slug bill of 1987. A Red
wood City Campfire Girls group
asked Sher to introduce the bill,
which would have made the bright
yellow creature "state mollusk."
Sher says he's "not ashamed"
of the bill, which he thinks had at
least as much merit as Assembly
member Quentin Kopp's legisla
tion making western swing the
state "official dance." Besides, he
says, following the slug bill gave
hundreds of schoolchildren a look
at "how ideas can get turned into
law, and how ideas can get
vetoed."
Sher and his wife, Linda,
divide their lives between Sacra
mento and Palo Alto, where they
moved from their Cowper Street
house to a condominium in 1983.
The Shers sold the house to a
young family after their own
three children had grown up.
Adrienne is an actress and mother
of a one-year-old daughter in
Sacramento; Benjamin is a
"writer and adventurer" now liv
ing in Africa; and Kate is a psy
chologist in San Francisco.
A social man, Sher is described
by Packer as "kind, human, funny
and very, very smart." To Webb,
Sher is "just a consistently lovable
person."
Sher is not a workaholic,
despite his deep commitment to
conserving California's environ
ment. He enjoys being outdoors,
swimming, tennis and going out
to restaurants and the theater
when he has the time. He loves
spending time with his grand
daughter.
But when asked what he thinks
is most fun, Sher has a single
answer: "Politics!"


Sher, often portrayed
as a humble do-good
er who hates the
grime of politics, says
that Is inaccurate. 'I
love politics. I don't
think you can be
effective if you're not
interested in it.'
Integrity in politicians may be an old-fashioned
concept, but it's why voters keep returning to
office state Assembly member Byron Sher, D-Palo
Alto, according to his colleagues and friends.
Even those on the opposite side of the political
aisle agree that one of Sher's most important
qualities is his trustworthiness. Chuck Quacken
bush, Republican assemblyman from District 22
in San Jose, says that although he and Sher have
different political backgrounds, "when Byron says
something I can trust him. That's the most
important attribute in Sacramento."
In his office at Stanford Law School, where he
teaches each fall during the Assembly recess, Sher
resembles a comfortable cross between lawyer
and professor, with his graying hair, beard and
dark suit, worn with a blue chambray shirt and
boldly patterned tie.
Sher was returned to the District 21 seat for a
sixth term this fall in an election marked by a
nationwide tide of feeling against incumbents. He
won an easy victory over his challenger, Eric Gar
ris, a libertarian running on the Republican
ticket.
Sher is reluctant to take credit for his popular
ity, saying only that the race didn't generate a lot
of interest, and that his opponent lacked visibility.
Also, he says,"the public s not ready for the legis
lation of drugs," one of the main points of Gams'
Slatform. Happy his constituents returned him to
acramento, Sher "is hoping they weren't too dis-

Such self-effacing comments
have contributed to recent media
portrayals of Sher as a humble do
gooder who hates the grime of pol
itics. "That is not accurate," Sher
says."I love politics. 1 don't think
you can be effective if you're not
interested in it."
"He's not humble," says
English Prof. Nancy Packer, a
friend of Sher and his wife of 32
years. "He knows he has a lot to
offer," she adds.
"He's a political animal,"
according to Gene Webb, professor
at the Graduate School of Busi
ness, who has known Sher for 15
years. Sher is "the antithesis of
the glib, facile, bullshitty kind of
politician," Webb says. "He's sort
of shy. He doesn't fit any stereo
type."
His quiet popularity in a pro
fession built on high profile
imagery comes partly from shared
interests with his constituents.
"Byron is incredibly successful in
maintaining his base among the
voters," Packer says.

tanks, enactment of the 1988 Cal
ifornia Clean Air Act, a bill in
1989 establishing stringent limits
on the amount of toxins in drink
ing water and a 1989 act mandat
ing that cities and counties reduce
or recycle one-half of their solid
waste by the year 2000.
Sher has had to learn to deal
with competing interests and has
a recognized knack for mediation
and compromise. Responding to
criticism of Sher for being too
open to negotiation, Brown says,
"He sees what can be done and

works to achieve what can be
accomplished."
Packer agrees. "Politics is the
art of the possible," she says,"and
as a politician he has to find the
possible. He's a practical person."
Characterizing Sher as "very pro
fessional," Quackenbush says,
"it's easy for someone to be a left
wing radical voting 'yes' on every
liberal bill, or a right-wing nut
voting 'no' on everything, but the
work is done in the middle."
Passage in November of Propo
sition 140, the California term
limits initiative, means that Sher
will have to leave his present
office in six years. "One of the
most unfortunate aspects of
Proposition 140," says Brown, "is
that the really good people like
Byron are subjected to a law that
doesn't work. Byron is a good
example of why legislative experi
ence is important in protecting
the public's interest."
Does the law allow for Sher to
seek other elected office? "Abso
lutely!" Sher says. "State Senate,

Congress, anything else." While
he says he'll put off thinking
about it "until next year," Sher
adds, "The truthful answer to
that is that every person in elected
office will be thinking about how
it fits into their career plans."
Future environmental legisla
tion may fare better with Gover
nor-elect Pete Wilson than it has
with outgoing Governor George
Deukmejian, according to Sher.
"Pete Wilson has a pretty good
environmental record. When he
was in the Assembly he carried
legislation to protect the coast,"
Sher says. Deukmejian, on the
other hand, "was not a friend of
the Coastal Commission. He tried
to starve it fiscally," says Sher.
Deukmejian also vetoed the
one bill of Sher's that critics hold
up as an embarrassment: the
banana slug bill of 1987. A Red
wood City Campfire Girls group
asked Sher to introduce the bill,
which would have made the bright
yellow creature "state mollusk."
Sher says he's "not ashamed"
of the bill, which he thinks had at
least as much merit as Assembly
member Quentin Kopp's legisla
tion making western swing the
state "official dance." Besides, he
says, following the slug bill gave
hundreds of schoolchildren a look
at "how ideas can get turned into
law, and how ideas can get
vetoed."
Sher and his wife, Linda,
divide their lives between Sacra
mento and Palo Alto, where they
moved from their Cowper Street
house to a condominium in 1983.
The Shers sold the house to a
young family after their own
three children had grown up.
Adrienne is an actress and mother
of a one-year-old daughter in
Sacramento; Benjamin is a
"writer and adventurer" now liv
ing in Africa; and Kate is a psy
chologist in San Francisco.
A social man, Sher is described
by Packer as "kind, human, funny
and very, very smart." To Webb,
Sher is "just a consistently lovable
person."
Sher is not a workaholic,
despite his deep commitment to
conserving California's environ
ment. He enjoys being outdoors,
swimming, tennis and going out
to restaurants and the theater
when he has the time. He loves
spending time with his grand
daughter.
But when asked what he thinks
is most fun, Sher has a single
answer: "Politics!"


Sher, often portrayed
as a humble do-good
er who hates the
grime of politics, says
that Is inaccurate. 'I
love politics. I don't
think you can be
effective if you're not
interested in it.'
