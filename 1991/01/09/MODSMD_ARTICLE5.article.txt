# With campus deserted, Stanford escapes December water penalty
## 
### Kathy Ardalan 
After paying thousands of dollars in
fines since last August, Stanford finally
used less than its limit of San Francisco
water in December because of the absence
of students, faculty and staff during winter
break.
According to Dan Champeau from the
San Francisco Water Management Depart
ment, Stanford consumed well below its 4.4
million gallon allotment for December.
David Kaye, operations manager at
Operations and Maintenance, attributed
this decrease not only to the holiday vaca
tions but also to the "virtual cessation of
irrigation around campus."
Kaye said he also does not anticipate any
fine for January.
In 1987 San Francisco mandated that
water consumption in both residences and
institutions decrease dramatically. Stan
ford now can use only 75 percent of the

water it consumed in 1987.
Penalties for exceeding this limit began
last August, and the University has paid
more than $400,000 in fines so far.
The University receives its water from
two sources: Hetch Hetchy Reservoir near
Yosemite National Park, which is controlled
by San Francisco, and its own wells. In
order to prevent future fines, Kaye wants to
maximize the use of Stanford's wells.
He said he does not anticipate the con
struction of additional wells and added that
the current wells are enough to sustain the
campus' needs.
Kaye said the cloudiness of the water
found in several dorms is merely the result
of the presence of oxygen in the well water.
Each week a water sample is inspected by a
private laboratory to ensure its safety, he
added.
Finally, he said he wants the community
to remain aware of the water shortage and
to use water sparingly.
