# Severe shortage hits blood bank
## 
### Michael Friedly Editorial staff 
The Stanford Blood Bank faced a severe
shortage of donors over the holiday break,
and staff members are currently calling all
past donors in an attempt to increase their
supplies.
"Last week the shortage was very criti
cal," according to Doreen Leith, supervisor
of donor recruitment. "We were almost to
the point to where we were going to call it
an emergency," she said.
The Blood Bank is particularly short in
its supplies of type O blood, and supplies of
O negative "are really in bad shape at this

time," Leith said.
Leith attributed the drop in blood sup
plies to the holiday season, when few people
give blood. "It is this time of year. Over the
holiday time, people just don't want to
donate blood," she said. "In general, people
are just really busy," she said.
She added that since many companies in
the area are closed, the Blood Bank is
unable to recruit blood donors in drives at
those companies. In addition, students,
staff and faculty are not around during
break to contribute, adding to the shortage.
Leith said the Stanford Blood Bank has
less need for blood than many of
the other blood banks in the area.
"There is no one we can buy
[blood] from, because [other cen
ters] all need it too."
In addition, Leith attributed
the shortage to the low blood sup

plies the Blood Bank keeps on
hand. "We never have a lot on
hand. We have just what we need.
But when suddenly, we are not
able to collect as much as usual,
we really need some help," she
said.
The Blood Bank has been call
ing all eligible donors of type O
blood in order to increase donors.
The next blood drive is scheduled
for tomorrow on the fourth floor
of the Durand Building.
