# Periodicals to be slashed at Meyer
## 
### Cecilia Tom Editorial staff 
Beginning next fall, students
will find the periodicals section of
Meyer Library greatly reduced in
size and scope.
The second floor of the library,
currently home to 340 periodical
titles, may undergo a reconfigura
tion because of earthquake reloca
tion, and a reading room may be
created to house the 55 periodicals
left after cuts are made, according
to Michael Miller, acting chief
librarian at Meyer.
Miller said terminating certain
subscriptions will release $32,000
that will be used for three priori
tized purposes: adding to the
library's ethnic holdings in sup
port of the Cultures, Ideas and
Values curriculum and related
courses; meeting the increasing
demands of the Media Center; and
acquiring better electronic refer
ence tools.
Miller said he identified the
periodicals section as a duplicated
service that can be cut, as all titles
can be found in other campus
libraries.
The titles that will be cut are
mostly research-oriented, and
although students will still be able

to still conduct periodical searches
in Meyer, they will have to go to
Green Library or other science
libraries to retrieve the materials,
Miller said.
Green currently holds about
5,200 periodical titles, according
to library specialist Michael Bal
lard. He said the number of titles
in Green have actually increased
during budget cuts, and only a
half-time position has been cut in
the periodical section.
Miller said the 55 titles that
will remain in Meyer will become
a miniaturized collection for the
purpose of intellectual stimula
tion. Selection will be based on
frequency of usage and whether
the periodicals contribute to a
well-rounded representation of
ideas, he said.
The most popular newspapers,
such as The New York Times and
The Wall Street Journal, will be
retained, as well as the more intel
lectual publications like The Jour
nal of Ethnic Studies and The
Harvard Business Review, Miller
said.
He said students will likely
notice the change next fall. Meyer
will continue to subscribe to all its
titles through this year since they
have already been paid for and
cannot be canceled, Miller said.
