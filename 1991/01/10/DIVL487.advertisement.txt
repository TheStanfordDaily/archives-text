RESEARCH
Thinking About Continuing
Your Education?
"My first case at Cornerstone Research was a multi-million dollar insider trading
case. Since then, I have worked on antitrust cases, securities class action suits, and
most recently, a patent infringement case that placed me in the middle of a trial in
federal district court. Because each case is unique, the process of learning and
developing never ends."
— Matt Schuster, Senior Analyst
