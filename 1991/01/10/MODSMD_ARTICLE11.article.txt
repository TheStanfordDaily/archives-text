## 
### Peter Cousins Staff writer 
Jeremy Warren, former man
ager of Employment and Human
Resources Development, has been
appointed acting director of
Human Resources Services,
becoming the department's third
head in the past seven months.
In the move, which took effect
Jan. 1, Warren replaced former
acting director Sally Clevenger,
who resigned effective Dec. 31.
As head of Human Resources,
Warren oversees the department's
various functions, including
employee relations, management
development and employee bene
fits. Warren will keep the office
until the new position of vice pres
ident of Human Resources, which
was created as part of the depart
ment's reorganization, is filled.
Vice President for Administra
tive Resources Su Schaffer said
Clevenger resigned to "return to
Southern California and some
professional pursuits." Schaffer
added that Clevenger fulfilled her
responsibilities as acting director
— to maintain Human Resources
and to "keep it rolling" during the
restructuring and decentraliza
tion taking place.

Warren said he hopes
to 'move things along'
in the department.

Clevenger came to Stanford in
October 1989 as manager of
Employee Relations. Six months
ago Schaffer and Provost James
Rosse appointed Clevenger acting
director of Human Resources
upon the departure of the previ
ous director, Mary Moore.
Schaffer praised the staff of
Human Resources for their
efforts during the restructuring.
"Overall, I think the [Human
Resources] group has done quite
well considering they have had so
much leadership change," she
said, adding that the staiT has
"really knuckled down" over the
last six to eight months.
Both Warren and Schaffer said
they hope a vice president for
Human Resources will be on the
job by March. "We're doing some
interviewing this week," Schaffer
noted.
The new vice president will
make decisions on what, if any,
reorganization will take place

within Human Resources. Schaf
fer said there are no finalized
plans for reorganization right
now, but suggestions have been
made for across-the-board
changes.
Scnaffer did note one change
within Human Resources which
she described as a "pilot program
for regional [Human Resources]
programs" within the University.
This system will assign experts
from within Human Resources
Services to individual depart
ments in which they have specific
expertise.
Warren said he hopes to "main
tain what we have and move
things along" in the department.
He said he is working with Rosse
to develop goals for Human
Resources.
Before he became the acting
director, Warren served as the
manager of Human Resources
Development for the last two
years and assumed the additional
responsibility of manager of
employment for the last year. He
will return to his previous posi
tion once a vice president for
Human Resources is appointed.
Warren said he would "renego
tiate with Provost Rosse" if asked
to stay longer in the position.
