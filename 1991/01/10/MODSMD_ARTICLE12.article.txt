# Long wait for student grades
## Budget cuts, rain, poor planning lengthen lines 
### Michelle Campos Staff writer 
The beginning of a new quarter inevitably
involves standing in line for everything from paying
bills to buying books, but the longest lines this week
have been at the Office of the Registrar.
Because of budget cuts, bad weather and poor
planning, grades were distributed this week from
two windows in the lobby in Old Union, making some
students wait in line for up to an hour.
Budget restrictions have eliminated the procedure
of mailing grades to students each quarter, and an
experiment a few years ago also showed that mailing
grades presented more problems than distributing
them on campus.
"We would like to have enough funding to avoid
this inconvenience, but we are not at a level of fund
ing which allows us that consideration," Acting

Registrar Jack Farrell said.
Farrell said the distribution system will save
approximately $2,500-$3,000 per quarter, and next
month's expected postal rate increase will add to the
savings. The costs of distributing grades on campus
include wages for temporary help and staff time.
Farrell said the rainy weather this week eliminat
ed the Old Union courtyard as an alternative distri
bution site, but by the time the problem became evi
dent at Monday morning's staff meeting, it was too
late to find another location.
"We know the cramped quarters of the Old Union
lobby are a problem and cause traffic problems not
only with students but with other administrators in
Old Union," Farrell said. "We're working to find a
solution."
The courtyard is a possible location for grade dis
tribution next quarter.
