Soviets retreat from Lithuania
MOSCOW (AP) — Hundreds of Lithuanian
demonstrators, some singing songs and wav
ing nationalist banners, guarded the Baltic
republic's parliament yesterday after Kremlin
troops made a show of force and then with
drew, an official said.
Rita Dapkus, a parliament spokeswoman,
said the armed troops left after dusk. She said
Kremlin soldiers also withdrew without inci
dent from the republic's television station.
Also yesterday, troops in armored personnel
carriers and buses rolled through the neigh
boring Baltic republic of Latvia. The republic's
government said it was told the troops were on
high alert and would start unspecified military
action Thursday.
The developments came two days after the
Defense Ministry ordered army paratroopers
to help round up draft resisters in Lithuania,
Latvia, Estonia, Armenia, Georgia, Moldavia
and the Ukraine.
Judge rules against NEA pledge
LOS ANGELES (AP) - A federal judge
ruled yesterday that the National Endowment
for the Arts' mandatory obscenity pledge was
unconstitutional.
The pledge, which prohibited NEA grant
recipients from making obscene works, vio
lated the artists' free-speech rights, U.S. Dis
trict Judge John Davies ruled.
The 28-page written decision was prompted
by a lawsuit filed by the Bella Lewitzky Dance
Company and the Newport Harbor Art
Museum.
When it approved a $174 million budget for
the arts endowment this year, Congress
repealed the obscenity ban and substituted a
requirement that NEA take "general stan
dards of decency" into account when awarding
grant money.
In his ruling, Davies said the initial ban was
"unconstitutionally vague because it leaves
the determination of obscenity in the hands of
the NEA."
