# Baker-Aziz talks fail to defuse crisis

GENEVA (AP) — Secretary of State
James Baker and Iraqi Foreign Minister
Tariq Aziz met for six hours yesterday but
failed to defuse the Persian Gulf crisis that
threatens war in the Middle East. "The
time for talk is running out," Baker said.
President Bush, in Washington, accused
the Iraqis of "a total stiff-arm, a total
rebuff," and refused to rule out launching
the first attack if Iraq doesn't withdraw
from Kuwait by next Tuesday's deadline set
by the United Nations.
Aziz blamed the United States for the
crisis and said, "We will not yield to
threats" demanding Iraqi withdrawal from
Kuwait.
Baker said the United States and its
allies possess the "power and the will" to
evict Iraqi forces, and some members of
Congress said the outcome of the talks
would make it easier for Bush to win con
gressional backing for such action.
The Baker-Aziz talks were the first high
level discussions between the two nations
in the five months since Iraq invaded
Kuwait. The two men sat across a blue
draped hotel conference table, with the
world eagerly awaiting the outcome of their
conversations.
Oil prices fell sharply in early trading as
word spread that the talks had not broken
apart abruptly, then soared within
moments of Baker's pessimistic report of
his session.
In the Saudi Arabian desert, across the
border from Iraq's occupying army, the
massive American military force went
about its business. Bush has ordered more
than 400,000 troops into the region, backed
by sophisticated aircraft, a huge armada
and hundreds of tanks.
Aziz, whose nation invaded Kuwait last
summer, pledged it would not attack first in
the current crisis. But, in the event of a war,
he said Iraq would "absolutely yes" attack
Israel.
Bush, asked if he would make the same
commitment, answered curtly, "No."
"It's not too late" to resolve the crisis
short of war, he said, but added that he was

discouraged by the day's events.
Baker told reporters his meetings with
Aziz were diplomatically polite — no table
pounding or yelling. Yet he said Aziz
refused to carry back to Baghdad a letter
from Bush to Saddam. American diplomats
will be leaving the Iraqi capital on Saturday,
he added, three days before the deadline for
possible attack.
Aziz said the letter contained language
inappropriate for an exchange between
heads of state. Asked about that, Bush said
the letter was "not rude" but direct, an
attempt to make sure Saddam clearly
understands the U.S. position.
Baker told reporters, "Regrettably, I
heard nothing today that suggested to me
any Iraqi flexibility" on a withdrawal from
Kuwait. Aziz did not once bring up the sub
ject of Kuwait during his news conference,
outlining instead Iraq's call for a confer
ence to address the rights of Palestinians.
Each side said it was up to the other to
prevent war.
"Let us all hope that the (Iraqi) leader
ship will have the wisdom to choose peace,"
said Baker.
Said Aziz: "That's up to the American
administration to decide."
In the meantime, the five-month war of
nerves was unabated.
Said Saddam Hussein in Iraq: Ameri
cans will "swim in their own blood" if war
breaks out.
The president issued an executive order
giving the government authority to get pri
ority delivery of any needed food or indus
trial material, and stepped up his campaign
for a divided House and Senate to grant
him unfettered authority to wage war.
Some lawmakers said the outcome of the
talks made it more likely that Bush would
win the support he's seeking.
"It might change some minds," said
Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa.
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said he
was weighing whether to seek presidential
authority for calling up to one million
reservists to active duty for as much as two
years.
