Bush preps U.S. industries for war
WASHINGTON (AP) - President Bush, girding
for possible war in the Persian Gulf, issued an exec
utive order yesterday allowing the government to
compel civilian manufacturers to fill the military's
needs first.
"The United States must have the capability to
rapidly mobilize its resources in the interest of
national security," Bush said in his executive order.
The Defense Production Act has given the presi
dent the authority since the Korean War to direct
important industries to put weapons and equipment
production ahead of commercial orders.
Britain, France restrict press in Gulf
LONDON (AP) — Britain and France have
released rules for Persian Gulf war coverage that are
similar to U.S. Defense Department guidelines in

restricting journalists' access to information and the
reporting of allied casualties.
Philip Knightley, an author who has written
extensively on the role of the war correspondent,
said yesterday that the new rules could lead to cen
sorship on an unprecedented scale in the West.
Under rules issued Monday by the British Min
istry of Defense, selected reporters will work in
pools, called Media Response Teams, under constant
military escort. The escort must be obeyed and has
the authority to examine copy on the spot.
Iraqis show no sign of withdrawal
KUWAIT (AP) — Iraqi troops, backed by tanks
and anti-aircraft guns, moved around Kuwait city
yesterday and civilians attended to business as
usual, seemingly unconcerned about the U.N. dead
line for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait only five days
away.

There was no sign that the Iraqi troops were
preparing to move out of the emirate, which Bagh
dad now calls Iraq's 19th province following its Aug.
2 takeover of Kuwait. Instead, the army appeared
geared to face a possible military attack.
Baghdad-based reporters were taken to Kuwait
on a government-organized trip to show that life
there was normal and discount reports of human
rights violations.
Schools were open and life appeared normal.
Israel hopes to remain uninvolved
JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel said yesterday it
hopes to remain uninvolved in the fighting if war
breaks out in the Persian Gulf, but it swore to defend
itself against any Iraqi attack.
Israelis watched the talks between Baker and Aziz
with special attention in view of Iraqi President Sad
dam Hussein's threat to attack Israel should his

nation come under assault from the U.S.-dominated
coalition in the gulf.
It is unclear whether Eyypt, Syria and other Arab
allies in that coalition would stand firm if Saddam
attacked Israel. For its part, Israel has tried to main
tain a low profile to avoid antagonizing the anti-Iraqi
Arab nations.
U.N. chief heads to Baghdad
UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar will go to Baghdad on a last
minute peace mission before the Jan. 15 deadline for
Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait, U.N. officials said
yesterday.
The U.N. chief scheduled separate meetings at
short notice late yesterday with the Iraqi and Kuwait
ambassadors. U.N. officials said privately that an
announcement of his departure for Iraq today might
follow.
