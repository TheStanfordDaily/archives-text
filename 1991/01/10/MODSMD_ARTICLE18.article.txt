## Dangerous vandals 
### 
Harmless vandalism
by friends of the Golden
Bears before Big Game each
year is inane but understandable
— they have to find some ways to
annoy us since they can't beat us.
However, when vandals set up
booby traps or deliberately deface
landmarks that hold special mean
ing for certain people, vandalism
becomes dangerous and inexcus
able.
The George Segal sculpture on
Lomita Mall, a symbol of gay liber
ation, has been defaced three times
by paint pellets in the past two
months. It costs money to main
tain these statues and looks posi
tively ugly when they are defaced
— so whoever you are, and no mat
ter whether you are anti-gay or

not, please do not do it again.
Vandalism as a means to settle
personal differences in beliefs and
opinions is immature, insensitive
and destructive. Stanford is a place
for open debate, and there are
plenty of ways to express yourself:
Put a sign up in White Plaza, hold
a town meeting, and, of course,
write to your local newspaper.
Booby-trap setters are different.
They are not merely intolerant;
they move into the realm of the
psychopathic. A neck-high wire
hung near the Graduate School of
Business last November could have
easily beheaded some fast biker.
Hopefully, Stanford students
know better than the perpetrators
of these foolish acts. Respect this
beautiful campus, each other, and,
most importantly, yourselves.
