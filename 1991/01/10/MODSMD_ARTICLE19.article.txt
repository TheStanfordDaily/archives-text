IN CLASSIC ASSU STYLE, the
ASSU Senate will debate a bill
soon on whether or not it can
debate bills.
At issue is whether the ASSU
Senate should consider bills of
national and international signifi
cance that have no direct bearing
on the Stanford community.
The bill, if passed, will limit the
senate to "University-related mat
ters of an academic, administra
tive, fiscal and social nature." The
controversy results from the pas
sage of a bill last quarter that
opposed a U.S.-led military offen
sive in the Persian Gulf.
In the past, the senate has
passed bills that have condemned
the murder of seven priests by the
El Salvador military, deplored the
use of force against Chinese
protesters for democracy in
Tiananmen Square and supported
the efforts of Cesar Chavez in his
grape boycott.

ASSU senators were elected on
platforms that reflected their spe
cific plans for change at Stanford,
not for their views on American
foreign or domestic policy. Their
views are not representative of the
students in general and should not
be viewed as a representative
cross-section of student opinion.
Furthermore, their hours spent
in debates over international
issues are hours of wasted time.
Their bills cannot change the fate
of the Salvadoran priests or Chi
nese students, nor do they influ
ence Stanford student opinion.
They only serve to destroy the
credibility of a student government
whose credibility is already low.
The senate can better spend its
time by trying to represent the stu
dents and passing bills that have
some direct relevance to the Stan
ford community, instead of wasting
their time on international issues.
