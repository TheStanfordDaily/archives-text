# Fetter resigns undergraduate admissions post
## 
### Cecilia Tom Editorial staff 
Next fall's incoming freshmen will prob
ably be the last to have "Bravo!" or
"Great!" scribbled on their acceptance let
ters, as Dean of Undergraduate Admissions
Jean Fetter yesterday announced her resig
nation, effective Aug. 31.
Fetter's announcement came as a total
surprise to her staff. Bill Tingley, associate
dean of undergraduate admissions, said he
and his colleagues are "stunned" and "very
emotional about [Fetter's decision]."
Fatter said she is taking a sabbatical next
year, during which she will reflect and write
about her experiences at Stanford and also
serve as a lecturer at the School of Educa
tion.
The Education School is the department
"most closely aligned" with her work in

undergraduate admissions, Fetter
explained. She added that it is "always good
to have colleagues around" when trying to
think and write.
Fetter attributed her resignation to the
realization that everyone's abilities are
finite. "I think all offices and individuals
can benefit from change and the infusion of
new ideas," she said.
A native of Wales, Fetter attended
Oxford University as a physics major. She
came to Stanford in 1975 as associate direc
tor of the Center for Teaching and Learning
and the Lilly Program for Faculty Renewal.
From 1977 to 1980, she served as assistant
to then-University President Richard
Lyman.
Fetter was appointed to her present posi
tion — her fourth at Stanford — in 1984
after serving four years as associate dean of
Undergraduate Studies and Research.

"I love the job," Fetter said, adding that
she would like to continue working at Stan
ford in some way after her sabbatical. How
ever, she stressed that she has no definite
plans yet. "I'll have a lot in common with
graduating seniors," Fetter said, adding,
"With repositioning, who knows?"
Provost James Rosse said he is going to
make sure that after her sabbatical, Fet
ter's "new assignment is at Stanford." He
added it will be difficult to replace a person
who has brought Stanford's admissions to
"extraordinarily high levels of both quality
and integrity."
During her seven years with the Office of
Undergraduate Admissions, Fetter has
acquired the affectionate title of "Dean
Jean" and is one of the most popular per
sonalities on campus. She regularly dines
with students at dormitories, and is
renowned for her ability to remember stu

dents' names and home towns.
"I think she will be profoundly missed,
but I'm glad she's still staying at Stanford,"
remarked Council of Presidents member
Goodwin Liu. "She has this surrogate con
nection with all undergraduates," he added.
"I think Dean Jean embodied very well
some of the aggressiveness and positive
outlooks which reflect Stanford," Liu said.
Under Fetter, Stanford has markedly
increased the diversity of its student body.
The percentage of students of color in Stan
ford's entering freshmen classes grew from
27 percent in 1984 to the present figure of
41.3 percent.
Liu said he is not concerned about the
impact of Fetter's departure on preserving
multiculturalism at Stanford, as the search
for Fetter's replacement will no doubt take


Joan Fetter
the issue into account.
Sally Mahoney, acting vice
president for Student Resources,
said she would consult with Eco
nomics Prof. John Pencavel, who
chairs the Committee on Under
graduate Admissions and Finan
cial Aid, to determine the needs of
the admissions office and a plan
for finding Fetter's successor.
Mahoney called Fetter a "ter
rific colleague" whose commit
ment to excellence is "at once
exhilarating and demanding."
University President Donald
Kennedy echoed her sentiments
in a written statement. Fetter's
"ability to carry out her duties
with fairness, style and wit served
Stanford well over the last seven
years," he said.
Fetter ascribed her success to
her staff housed on the second
floor of Old Union. "They are the
unsung heroines and heroes,
because it's all behind-the-scenes
work. I get to put my name on the
admit letters, but not without
their support," she said.
Tingley praised Fetter for
being a strong and humane leader
and an "effective spokesperson"
supporting minority enrollment
and outreach programs.
He added that under the lead
ership of Fetter, the Admissions
Office became more democratic
because of her willingness to dele
gate responsibilities. "We have a
very lean staff known for working
very hard.... Whoever succeeds
her will find a dedicated staff,"
Tingley said.
He disagreed that recent fresh
men classes are more academi
cally-oriented or "nerdy," as some
have alleged, stressing that Fetter
has maintained high standards
for both academic and personal
achievements.
