ASSU must address issues beyond Campus Dr.

SOON, THE ASSU SENATE WILL
vote on a bill which proposes to ban
the ASSU from dealing with non-
University issues.
We, the undersigned senators and
Council of Presidents members oppose
this bill because we believe that student
government is elected to serve student
interests, and student interests expand
beyond Campus Drive.
The majority of Stanford students care
about issues beyond Stanford as is indi
cated by their involvement in public ser
vice, community empowerment and
activism on political and social issues on
and off campus. We believe that student
government must reflect this involve
ment and do what it can to support stu
dent initiative.
If students want us to take stands on
national or international issues, we
should do so, as we did to support Earth
Day and students fighting for basic demo
cratic rights in China.
In the past and currently, students
have demonstrated concern with the
environment, federal financial aid, civil
rights and reproductive choice. More
recently, a great deal of students have
shown concern for the current crisis in
the Gulf, and the ASSU responded
accordingly.
Noting an abundance of letters to The
Daily, a rally of more than 1,000 students
during midterms and numerous conver
sations in which students expressed con
cern about the prospect of war in the
Gulf, the ASSU passed a bill in favor of a
peaceful resolution. Those who voted for
the bill believed that the prospect or war
in the Gulf is a student issue.
The question of whether or not the
ASSU should take stands on national
issues was also an issue in last year's elec
tion. The majority seemed to believe that
the ASSU should — they voted a majority
of senators who are willing to take stands
on national issues into the senate. More
specifically, 70 percent voted in support of

When an issue is complex or controversial, student
representatives must take leadership in defining the
issue and taking a stand. Those who voted for them
obviously entrusted them with making such judgment
calls. It is irresponsible to a senator's constituency to
avoid an issue just because it is complex.

an actively pro-choice ASSU. This
national issue was obviously of great
importance to them, and they wanted
other campuses and the rest of the nation
to know where Stanford students stand.
Some say, "But unforeseen issues of
national importance come up after sena
tors have already been elected, and the
voters could not have possibly known how
a senator would vote on such an issue."
This is true of all elected representatives
in any democratic system.
It is also true that campus issues come
up that were unforeseen at the time of the
election, but senators still must do their
best to vote as their constituencies would
want them to vote. Senators should gauge
student opinion on national issues in the
following ways:
• Talk with one's constituencies as well as
with a cross-section of students and with
dorm reps to get a sense of where the stu
dents "are at";
• Conduct a student poll when feasible;
• Note the proliferation of rallies, letters
to The Daily, or group statements around
a specific issue;
When an issue is complex or controver
sial, student representatives must show
leadership in defining the issue and tak
ing a stand. Those who voted for them
obviously entrusted them with making
such judgment calls. It is irresponsible to
a senator's constituency to avoid an issue
just because it is complex.
After recognizing that non-University

issues are student issues nonetheless, we
must not underestimate the impact stu
dents can have on state and national pol
ity if we have a strong student voice.
From the civil rights and anti-war strug
gles of the 19605, to the fight against
investment in South Africa, to the strug
gle for women's reproductive rights, stu
dents have demonstrated a proud history
in shaping and changing society.
Across the nation student govern
ments are looked to as the sole official
representatives of a school's student
body. The student voice is weakened, if
not completely eliminated at the state
and national levels, if student govern
ment cannot take stands on issues about
which the majority of students care.
We have delineated some of the rea
sons for opposing this bill that would con
fine the ASSU to dealing only with Uni
versity issues. The ASSU constitution
itself reflects our stance, and to pass the
bill would be unconstitutional.
Article I, Section 3 of the ASSU Con
stitution clearly states that "The Associa
tion shall be the sole representative of the
entire Stanford student body," in both
"any dealings with other elements of the
University" AND "non-university
affairs."
Article 11, section 1 states that the
"final representative authority of the
Association is vested in the Senate qf the
Association."

The constitution clearly indicates that
the ASSU Senate is to represent students
not only in University matters, but in
non-university matters. We agree with
the intent of the constitution.

the Gulf, and the ASSU responded
accordingly.
Noting an abundance of letters to The
Daily, a rally of more than 1,000 students
during midterms and numerous conver
sations in which students expressed con
cern about the prospect of war in the
Gulf, the ASSU passed a bill in favor of a
peaceful resolution. Those who voted for
the bill believed that the prospect or war
in the Gulf is a student issue.
The question of whether or not the
ASSU should take stands on national
issues was also an issue in last year's elec
tion. The majority seemed to believe that
the ASSU should — they voted a majority
of senators who are willing to take stands
on national issues into the senate. More
specifically, 70 percent voted in support of

When an issue is complex or controversial, student
representatives must take leadership in defining the
issue and taking a stand. Those who voted for them
obviously entrusted them with making such judgment
calls. It is irresponsible to a senator's constituency to
avoid an issue just because it is complex.

an actively pro-choice ASSU. This
national issue was obviously of great
importance to them, and they wanted
other campuses and the rest of the nation
to know where Stanford students stand.
Some say, "But unforeseen issues of
national importance come up after sena
tors have already been elected, and the
voters could not have possibly known how
a senator would vote on such an issue."
This is true of all elected representatives
in any democratic system.
It is also true that campus issues come
up that were unforeseen at the time of the
election, but senators still must do their
best to vote as their constituencies would
want them to vote. Senators should gauge
student opinion on national issues in the
following ways:
• Talk with one's constituencies as well as
with a cross-section of students and with
dorm reps to get a sense of where the stu
dents "are at";
• Conduct a student poll when feasible;
• Note the proliferation of rallies, letters
to The Daily, or group statements around
a specific issue;
When an issue is complex or controver
sial, student representatives must show
leadership in defining the issue and tak
ing a stand. Those who voted for them
obviously entrusted them with making
such judgment calls. It is irresponsible to
a senator's constituency to avoid an issue
just because it is complex.
After recognizing that non-University

issues are student issues nonetheless, we
must not underestimate the impact stu
dents can have on state and national pol
ity if we have a strong student voice.
From the civil rights and anti-war strug
gles of the 19605, to the fight against
investment in South Africa, to the strug
gle for women's reproductive rights, stu
dents have demonstrated a proud history
in shaping and changing society.
Across the nation student govern
ments are looked to as the sole official
representatives of a school's student
body. The student voice is weakened, if
not completely eliminated at the state
and national levels, if student govern
ment cannot take stands on issues about
which the majority of students care.
We have delineated some of the rea
sons for opposing this bill that would con
fine the ASSU to dealing only with Uni
versity issues. The ASSU constitution
itself reflects our stance, and to pass the
bill would be unconstitutional.
Article I, Section 3 of the ASSU Con
stitution clearly states that "The Associa
tion shall be the sole representative of the
entire Stanford student body," in both
"any dealings with other elements of the
University" AND "non-university
affairs."
Article 11, section 1 states that the
"final representative authority of the
Association is vested in the Senate qf the
Association."

The constitution clearly indicates that
the ASSU Senate is to represent students
not only in University matters, but in
non-university matters. We agree with
the intent of the constitution.
