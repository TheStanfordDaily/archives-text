## A 						guest in her old home 
### 
HOME JUST ISN'T HOME any
more. But as I walked up to the
front door, I didn't see anything
that was different.
The same potted plants sat half-frozen
in the frosty weather, and the same worn
out rocking chairs squeaked as the wind
gently rocked them back and forth.
And my little brother, in his traditional
altruistic holiday fashion, had once again
put little Christmas lights on the house
that spelled out: "Give the fat guy a pre
sent too."
Yeah ... this is home all right. Wel
come back, I thought, to the craziness,
and the difficulties and the love.
I stepped inside. Nothing in here
looked any different than when I left in
September either. The furniture was
arranged the same way, the pictures
hadn't changed, and the traditional
Johnny Mathis Christmas music greeted
me at the door.
Maybe there was nothing wrong with
home. Maybe there was something wrong
with me. No one else in the house seemed
to notice the difference.
No, that wasn't it. I could sense that
there was a difference — even without
seeing it — even without knowing exactly
what that difference was.
I hugged my mom. "It's so good to see
you again," she said. "Aren't you glad to
be back home?"

I only spent a week at home this time.
It was time enough to visit the regular
hang-out spots and regular friends.
I was happy to see everybody, but we
could have sleepwalked through our ritu

alized conversations. "How's school?
How's the love life? How's the weather
down there? Okay, see you next year."
I mean, what do you say to someone
you haven't seen in a year? How do you
sum up 12 months of your life to someone
who barely knows you anymore?
It's hard to do so you just give them
the facts — nothing too deep or personal.
But it's also a shame that you have to
talk to one of your closest friends that
way. Too bad you couldn't have kept in
touch a little better before, because it cost
you a friend.

Usually if I stay at home for a long
time, we all get upset with each other at
some point. I play the I'm-In-College-
And-Can-Do-Whatever-I-Want role,
which of course forces my mom to play
the Not-In-My-House role, which of
course leads t0... well, you know what
I'm talking about: lots of loud talking,
door-banging, and yelling things you wish
you could take back again.
But none of that happened this time.
Maybe it won't happen again. I had free
rein of the house, and the car and my
time.
I think my mom's starting to come to
terms with the fact that I've grown up. Or
maybe it's just that I'm finally giving her
reason to believe it.
But there's definitely something dif
ferent about our relationship now. In fact,
everybody seems to talk to me a little dif
ferently now. I mean, they were nice to
me! Too nice!
My little brother let me borrow his
television. My older brother let me bor

row his car. My mom cooked all my
favorite things. They treated me like a
guest or a kid with a terminal disease.
It was great, though. I was living like a
king in my own home.
But at the same time it was kind of
scary. They were treating me like that so
I would feel at home again. But because
they were trying so hard to make me feel
comfortable and at home, I knew that I
definitely wasn't part of the family.
After being at home this time I realized
that I really was an outsider now. A really
nice outsider, and a really loved outsider,
but an outsider nonetheless.

I was happy to be back in my Stanford
room again on Sunday. It was nice to be
back where I felt comfortable — with all
my things and my friends.
I felt like I was at home again.
I think that's why home — my real
home — didn't seem the same. Stanford
is my home now. It's where I work, and
study and play. It's where I live my life
and where I want to be.
But I know in the end, even the home
I've found here will be gone once my four
years are done. Then what?
