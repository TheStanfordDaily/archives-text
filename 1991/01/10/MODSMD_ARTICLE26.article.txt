## Wildcats once again look like the leaders of the Pac 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
If the first weekend of the
Pacific 10 Conference basketball
season was any indication, you
can count on some wild and crazy
times on the hardwood in the next
two months.
After only two games, a whole
mess of preseason "conventional
wisdom" has been thrown out the
window, leaving what looks like a
mad scramble for the top spots in
the league. For, while Arizona and
UCLA are the consensus picks to
finish 1-2 in the conference, the
race for the third and fourth spots
— and, most likely, NCAA tourna
ment bids — is wide open, with at
least six teams looking like they
could make a move toward the
top.
Consider what happened in
just the first weekend of play:
•Arizona, the hands-down con
ference favorite, spent the presea
son looking like they might
become the first team since 1978
to go through the league unde
feated. Then, after winning 10 of
their 11 non-conference games,
the Wildcats promptly got crushed
at Washington, 70-56, in their
league opener. Washington, 11-17
last year, was picked to finish
ninth in a preseason poll of Pac-10
coaches.
•Stanford and California,
picked third and fourth in the
coaches poll, each started out con
ference play by dropping two
games on the road to Oregon and
Oregon State, the latter of whom
was picked to finish no better
than seventh in any preseason
poll.
•Washington State, the near
unanimous pick to sleep in the
Pac-10's basement suite, opened
its league schedule by thumping
Arizona State at home. The Sun
Devils, of course, then turned
around to knock Washington off
Cloud 9, 68-60.
There are two mtyor themes in
all this: (1) The preseason polls
are worth almost (but not quite)
as much as the paper they're
printed on; and (2) In the Pac-10,
home is heaven: Seven of the
weekend's nine games were won

by the home team.
Here's a look at Stanford's nine
Pac-10 opponents, in the order
they appeared in the now-worth
less preseason poll:
Arizona (11-2,1-1)
This is a team that has it all:
Six of the top seven scorers from
last season's 25-7 team are back,
including a monstrous frontcourt
and quick guards who can shoot
from anywhere (except, appar
ently, at Washington). In addition,
transfer Chris Mills, who can play
four different positions (all of
them extremely well), joins the
team. Right now he's playing
small forward and is leading the
team at 14.6 ppg.
The Tucson Skyline of 6-foot
-11 Sean Rooks (14.4 ppg, 6.5 rpg),
6-11 Brian Williams (12.5 ppg, 8.4
rpg) and 7-foot sub Ed Stokes (7.1
ppg, 4.8 rpg) is probably the best
(and certainly the heftiest) front
line in the league.
UCLA (12-1, 1-0)
The Bruins have four starters
back from an extremely talented
team that somehow managed to
finish fourth in 1990, losing five
games in a row at one point.
UCLA came around to win two
games in the NCAA tournament,
but still has to get over its image
as an underachieving team.
Junior all-Pac-10 forward Don
Mac Lean is leading the team in
scoring (for the third year in a
row) at 24.2 ppg (along with 7.6
rpg), and sophomore center/for
ward Tracy Murray comes in at
19.4 ppg and 6.5 rpg.
UCLA has gone with a three
guard offense all season, with
juniors Darrick Martin (13.3 ppg,
tops in the league at 6.8 assists
per game) and Gerald Madkins
(9.0 ppg), both starting for the
second straight year, joined by
Mitchell Butler (9.6 ppg).
California (4-7, 0-2)
If the Bears' erratic preseason
is any indication, they won't even
come close to finishing in the first
division. Right now they're 2-1 at
home and a horrid 1-6 on the
road. Cal did manage to stay close
against both Oregon schools last

week, but lost by six to Oregon
and four to OSU.
There aren't a lot of solid expla
nations for the Bears' start. All-
Pac-10 sophomore Brian Hen
drick has improved on his 1990
season, averaging 16 points and
9.3 rebounds. Forward Roy Fisher
comes in at 14.5 ppg and 6.2 rpg.
Billy Dreher leads the league in
three-point percentage at 56.3.
Oregon (7-5, 2-0)
The Ducks were picked to fin
ish dead last in 1990, but some
how came in fifth. Now, with four
starters back and a solid start
(including Sunday's comeback
from a 17-point deficit against
Stanford), Oregon may be a team
to watch. Point guard Terrell
Brandon is leading the Pac-10 at
25.9 ppg,
Arizona State (10-2, 1-1)
Three starters are gone from
coach Bill Frieder's 15-16 NIT
squad, but he's more than made
up for the loss with a recruiting
class ranked as high as second in
the nation. One of those frosh,
Jamal Faulkner, is third on the

team at 14.3 ppg. Forward Isaac
Austin leads the way at 16.8 ppg
and 9.3 rpg.
Oregon State (7-4, 2-0)
After a magical year which saw
the Beavers finish tied with Ari
zona for the league crown, OSU
was expected to take a year (or
two) to rebuild: Seven of that
team's top nine players are gone.
With two wins last week over
teams that (at least on paper)
were supposed to be better than
them, the Beavers may not be as
bad as anyone thought. Teo
Alibegovic (say it fast three times)
leads the team with 16.7 points
per game.
USC (8-2, 0-1)
With supersoph Harold Miner
(25.5 ppg) back at shooting guard,
the Trojans are one of the "on any
given night" teams that could give
people fits. The Trojans' 12-16
record last year was their best
since 1985, and they appear to be
on their way up.
Washington (9-2, 1-1)

Washington didn't play the
world's hardest preseason sched
ule, but their solid thumping of
Arizona gives them instant credi
bility: A team that can beat Ari
zona can beat just about anyone.
Two freshmen start for the
Huskies, who have the league's

tightest defense at 63.7 ppg.
Washington St. (8-3, 1-1)
The Cougars won only one
league game last season, and lost
their last 18 games. So, needless
to say, they beat ASU in their
opener.


Tracy Allen — Daily file
Senior guard John Patrick has been Stanford's top outside scoring
threat this season. He is currently making 48 percent, good for third
in the Pac-10.

ninth in a preseason poll of Pac-10
coaches.
•Stanford and California,
picked third and fourth in the
coaches poll, each started out con
ference play by dropping two
games on the road to Oregon and
Oregon State, the latter of whom
was picked to finish no better
than seventh in any preseason
poll.
•Washington State, the near
unanimous pick to sleep in the
Pac-10's basement suite, opened
its league schedule by thumping
Arizona State at home. The Sun
Devils, of course, then turned
around to knock Washington off
Cloud 9, 68-60.
There are two mtyor themes in
all this: (1) The preseason polls
are worth almost (but not quite)
as much as the paper they're
printed on; and (2) In the Pac-10,
home is heaven: Seven of the
weekend's nine games were won

by the home team.
Here's a look at Stanford's nine
Pac-10 opponents, in the order
they appeared in the now-worth
less preseason poll:
Arizona (11-2,1-1)
This is a team that has it all:
Six of the top seven scorers from
last season's 25-7 team are back,
including a monstrous frontcourt
and quick guards who can shoot
from anywhere (except, appar
ently, at Washington). In addition,
transfer Chris Mills, who can play
four different positions (all of
them extremely well), joins the
team. Right now he's playing
small forward and is leading the
team at 14.6 ppg.
The Tucson Skyline of 6-foot
-11 Sean Rooks (14.4 ppg, 6.5 rpg),
6-11 Brian Williams (12.5 ppg, 8.4
rpg) and 7-foot sub Ed Stokes (7.1
ppg, 4.8 rpg) is probably the best
(and certainly the heftiest) front
line in the league.
UCLA (12-1, 1-0)
The Bruins have four starters
back from an extremely talented
team that somehow managed to
finish fourth in 1990, losing five
games in a row at one point.
UCLA came around to win two
games in the NCAA tournament,
but still has to get over its image
as an underachieving team.
Junior all-Pac-10 forward Don
Mac Lean is leading the team in
scoring (for the third year in a
row) at 24.2 ppg (along with 7.6
rpg), and sophomore center/for
ward Tracy Murray comes in at
19.4 ppg and 6.5 rpg.
UCLA has gone with a three
guard offense all season, with
juniors Darrick Martin (13.3 ppg,
tops in the league at 6.8 assists
per game) and Gerald Madkins
(9.0 ppg), both starting for the
second straight year, joined by
Mitchell Butler (9.6 ppg).
California (4-7, 0-2)
If the Bears' erratic preseason
is any indication, they won't even
come close to finishing in the first
division. Right now they're 2-1 at
home and a horrid 1-6 on the
road. Cal did manage to stay close
against both Oregon schools last

week, but lost by six to Oregon
and four to OSU.
There aren't a lot of solid expla
nations for the Bears' start. All-
Pac-10 sophomore Brian Hen
drick has improved on his 1990
season, averaging 16 points and
9.3 rebounds. Forward Roy Fisher
comes in at 14.5 ppg and 6.2 rpg.
Billy Dreher leads the league in
three-point percentage at 56.3.
Oregon (7-5, 2-0)
The Ducks were picked to fin
ish dead last in 1990, but some
how came in fifth. Now, with four
starters back and a solid start
(including Sunday's comeback
from a 17-point deficit against
Stanford), Oregon may be a team
to watch. Point guard Terrell
Brandon is leading the Pac-10 at
25.9 ppg,
Arizona State (10-2, 1-1)
Three starters are gone from
coach Bill Frieder's 15-16 NIT
squad, but he's more than made
up for the loss with a recruiting
class ranked as high as second in
the nation. One of those frosh,
Jamal Faulkner, is third on the

team at 14.3 ppg. Forward Isaac
Austin leads the way at 16.8 ppg
and 9.3 rpg.
Oregon State (7-4, 2-0)
After a magical year which saw
the Beavers finish tied with Ari
zona for the league crown, OSU
was expected to take a year (or
two) to rebuild: Seven of that
team's top nine players are gone.
With two wins last week over
teams that (at least on paper)
were supposed to be better than
them, the Beavers may not be as
bad as anyone thought. Teo
Alibegovic (say it fast three times)
leads the team with 16.7 points
per game.
USC (8-2, 0-1)
With supersoph Harold Miner
(25.5 ppg) back at shooting guard,
the Trojans are one of the "on any
given night" teams that could give
people fits. The Trojans' 12-16
record last year was their best
since 1985, and they appear to be
on their way up.
Washington (9-2, 1-1)

Washington didn't play the
world's hardest preseason sched
ule, but their solid thumping of
Arizona gives them instant credi
bility: A team that can beat Ari
zona can beat just about anyone.
Two freshmen start for the
Huskies, who have the league's

tightest defense at 63.7 ppg.
Washington St. (8-3, 1-1)
The Cougars won only one
league game last season, and lost
their last 18 games. So, needless
to say, they beat ASU in their
opener.


Tracy Allen — Daily file
Senior guard John Patrick has been Stanford's top outside scoring
threat this season. He is currently making 48 percent, good for third
in the Pac-10.
If the first weekend of the
Pacific 10 Conference basketball
season was any indication, you
can count on some wild and crazy
times on the hardwood in the next
two months.
After only two games, a whole
mess of preseason "conventional
wisdom" has been thrown out the
window, leaving what looks like a
mad scramble for the top spots in
the league. For, while Arizona and
UCLA are the consensus picks to
finish 1-2 in the conference, the
race for the third and fourth spots
— and, most likely, NCAA tourna
ment bids — is wide open, with at
least six teams looking like they
could make a move toward the
top.
Consider what happened in
just the first weekend of play:
•Arizona, the hands-down con
ference favorite, spent the presea
son looking like they might
become the first team since 1978
to go through the league unde
feated. Then, after winning 10 of
their 11 non-conference games,
the Wildcats promptly got crushed
at Washington, 70-56, in their
league opener. Washington, 11-17
last year, was picked to finish
ninth in a preseason poll of Pac-10
coaches.
•Stanford and California,
picked third and fourth in the
coaches poll, each started out con
ference play by dropping two
