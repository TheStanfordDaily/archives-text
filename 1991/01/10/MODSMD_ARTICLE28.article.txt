# Pro wrestling is a dangerous fantasy
## 
### 
Forgive me for saying so, but
it's a pretty boring time in
the world of sports right
now. So rather than write about
sports, I'm going to talk about
something quite unathletic: pro
fessional wrestling.
"But Dave," you may be saying
to me, "wrestling is a sport."
Quite true, I concede the point.
And with apologies to my friend
Steve Buddie, I admit that ama
teur wrestling at all levels
requires tremendous condition
ing, strength and discipline. Ama
teur wrestling is sport in every
sense of the word.
But I'm talking about profes
sional wrestling. You know, Sun
day morning's answer to Saturday
cartoons - a theatrical pitting of
good against evil in which some
body gets pummeled and someone
does the pummeling. Except with
wrestling, the characters aren't
animated. They're closer to brain
dead, actually.
It's pure theater staged for our
entertainment. The grapplers
don't belong to a wreslter's union,
they are members of the screen
actor's guild. To prove my point:
• Captain Lou Albano, the rub
ber-bands-in-the-nose manager of
several of the World Wrestling
Federation's best actors - err,
wrestlers - played the role of Cindi
Lauper's father in one of her
videos.
• Hulk Hogan, the behemoth
champion of the WWF, battled
Slyvester Stallone to a draw in a
unique boxing/wrestling match in
Rocky 111.
Now, I have to admit that I was
once a fan of the wonderful world

of histrionics. Every Sunday
morning as a youngster my
friends and I would drag ourselves
out of bed, usually after staying
up to watch "The Creature from
the Black Lagoon" which always
seemed to be on TV, to listen to
Mean Gene Okerlund, the master
ful diplomat/host of the American
Wrestling Association, tell us
about the latest vendetta of one of
the Superdestroyers.
Then Superdestroyer 111 would
get in the ring with an eager-look
ing young lad named something
like "Brett Valiant." An Irish whip
and a suplex later, Valiant was
unconcious as Superdestroyer
taunted the crowd. And before
you could say "commercial
break," Baron Von Raske was
doing the same thing to some
other sap.
That was back when pro
wrestling was just simple enter
tainment. Then came the World
Wrestling Federation, battles
royale, cage matches and the
many installments of "Wrestlema
nia." Big John Studd was beating
up on Hulk Hogan, Andre the
Giant was switching camps (from
"evil" to "good" and back again),
and the Junkyard Dog was wear

ing a leash when he came into the
ring. Wrestling became the the
ater of the absurd.
The next thing I know a friend
of mine who wrestled for my high
school, Quentin, started going
around calling himself "Junk Yard
Quentin" and barking like a dog.
On the mat he would do the Bru
tus Beefcake strut after defeating
an opponent. These characters
became Quentin's idols, as I'm
sure they did for many kids.
But the WWF has finally out
done itself. Today I read that for
mer G.I. Joe supergood guy
Sergeant Slaughter, after being
"booted out of the army for abus
ing his recruits," has joined the
enemy and hired an Iraqi general
to be his manager. This "General
Adnan" brought the traitorous
Slaughter a gift from none other
than Saddam Hussein for his loy
alty: a new pair of combat boots.
But how did Saddam know
Slaughter's shoe size?
My friend Clarke Hillarbecca
often tells me that "theater is
nothing more than a social mir
ror." If that's true, and if you
accept my premise about pro
wrestling being more theatrical
than sporting, then what does the
World Wrestling Federation tell
you about our society?
The old days of pro wrestling,
when for the most part good
would triumph over evil and occa
sionally vice versa, simply played
off of everyone's innate sense of
right and wrong. It was fine
because in those days the enter
tainment relied on fictional vil
lains and antagonisms that
amounted to little more than a

Except with wrestling,
the characters aren't
animated. They're
closer to brain-dead.

Hatfield-and-McCoy type dispute.
Even if it was brainless and taste
less, it was relatively harmless.
But when pro wrestling starts
exploiting international tensions
while promoting derogatory racial
stereotypes, then the entertain
ment has ceased to be harmless.
The WWF's General Adnan isn't
the first character who has repre
sented an American enemy. Niko
lai Volkov beat up on the WWF's
good guys for many cold war
years. Then with Perestroika,
Volkov mysteriously became a
good guy.
The WWF is dangerous for this
reason: it promotes racial and eth
nic antagonisms to people who,
due to the nature of the event,
don't think critically about the
spectacle unfolding on the mat.
What about the kids at home who
watch the hated Iraqi beat up
their beloved hero? Would we tol
erate kids watching cartoons in
which a Russian or an Arab beat
up an American or vice versa?
I think not. And hopefully
there are parents and maybe even
WWF administrators who realize
that their craft is no longer enter
tainment. It's becoming cynical
and dangerous propoganda.

Forgive me for saying so, but
it's a pretty boring time in
the world of sports right
now. So rather than write about
sports, I'm going to talk about
something quite unathletic: pro
fessional wrestling.
"But Dave," you may be saying
to me, "wrestling is a sport."
Quite true, I concede the point.
And with apologies to my friend
Steve Buddie, I admit that ama
teur wrestling at all levels
requires tremendous condition
ing, strength and discipline. Ama
teur wrestling is sport in every
sense of the word.
But I'm talking about profes
sional wrestling. You know, Sun
day morning's answer to Saturday
cartoons - a theatrical pitting of
good against evil in which some
body gets pummeled and someone
does the pummeling. Except with
wrestling, the characters aren't
animated. They're closer to brain
dead, actually.
It's pure theater staged for our
entertainment. The grapplers
don't belong to a wreslter's union,
they are members of the screen
actor's guild. To prove my point:
• Captain Lou Albano, the rub
ber-bands-in-the-nose manager of
several of the World Wrestling
Federation's best actors - err,
wrestlers - played the role of Cindi
Lauper's father in one of her
videos.
• Hulk Hogan, the behemoth
champion of the WWF, battled
Slyvester Stallone to a draw in a
unique boxing/wrestling match in
Rocky 111.
Now, I have to admit that I was
once a fan of the wonderful world

of histrionics. Every Sunday
morning as a youngster my
friends and I would drag ourselves
out of bed, usually after staying
up to watch "The Creature from
the Black Lagoon" which always
seemed to be on TV, to listen to
Mean Gene Okerlund, the master
ful diplomat/host of the American
Wrestling Association, tell us
about the latest vendetta of one of
the Superdestroyers.
Then Superdestroyer 111 would
get in the ring with an eager-look
ing young lad named something
like "Brett Valiant." An Irish whip
and a suplex later, Valiant was
unconcious as Superdestroyer
taunted the crowd. And before
you could say "commercial
break," Baron Von Raske was
doing the same thing to some
other sap.
That was back when pro
wrestling was just simple enter
tainment. Then came the World
Wrestling Federation, battles
royale, cage matches and the
many installments of "Wrestlema
nia." Big John Studd was beating
up on Hulk Hogan, Andre the
Giant was switching camps (from
"evil" to "good" and back again),
and the Junkyard Dog was wear

ing a leash when he came into the
ring. Wrestling became the the
ater of the absurd.
The next thing I know a friend
of mine who wrestled for my high
school, Quentin, started going
around calling himself "Junk Yard
Quentin" and barking like a dog.
On the mat he would do the Bru
tus Beefcake strut after defeating
an opponent. These characters
became Quentin's idols, as I'm
sure they did for many kids.
But the WWF has finally out
done itself. Today I read that for
mer G.I. Joe supergood guy
Sergeant Slaughter, after being
"booted out of the army for abus
ing his recruits," has joined the
enemy and hired an Iraqi general
to be his manager. This "General
Adnan" brought the traitorous
Slaughter a gift from none other
than Saddam Hussein for his loy
alty: a new pair of combat boots.
But how did Saddam know
Slaughter's shoe size?
