After a tough week of illness
and injury, the Cardinal
wrestling team limped into last
night's match against Oregon.
"Coming in, we all knew we
were in trouble," said coach
Chris Horpel. "We were just
hoping to sneak in a victory or
two." With five starters on the
sidelines, Stanford was virtu
ally helpless, losing to the 21st
ranked Ducks by a tally of 40-3.
The trouble began for the
squad with the opening 118-
pound match. Sophomore Phil
Nowick was pitted against Ore
gon's Dan Vidlak, ranked sec
ond nationally. Vidlak con
trolled the contest, recording
eight takedowns.
Jesse Lindow, a freshman,
was overmatched in the 126-
pound event. Lindow narrowly
avoided a pin in the second
period before losing by a tech
nical fall, 15-0.
Jay Jackson, another fresh
man, replaced sophomore
Lance Johnson at 134 pounds.
Jackson, normally a 126-
pounder, was overwhelmed by
his more experienced Duck
opponent, losing 9-0.
Cardinal senior James
Dinette, fresh off a third-place
finish at last weekend's Doc
Petersen Open, faced seventh
ranked Scott Glenn at 142.
Glenn dominated the match,
but Dinette avoided a pin and
lost by the respectable score of

10-4.
In the 150-pound event,
Dave Sacks stayed close for
most of the match. Down by
only four points late in the sec
ond period, the junior tired
from that point, losing by the
final score of 12-2.
Bob Becker was impressive
at 158. Forced into action
because of an injury to senior
Matt Topham, Becker recorded
Stanford's first non-escape
points with a reversal at 2:20 of
the first period. Although the
sophomore eventually lost, 10-
5, Horpel was pleased, saying
that "Becker wrestled very well
for someone with so little expe
rience."
Stanford forfeited the 167-
pound event, due to an injury
to All-American Steve Buddie.
The senior, ranked first nation
ally in preseason polls, is out
indefinitely with bursitis in his
elbows.
Senior Steve Yarborough
recorded the Cardinal's lone
victory at 177, defeating his
opponent by the score of 8-5.
Yarborough, coming off a first
place victory in the Petersen
tournament, was decisive in
recording Stanford's only two
takedowns on the night.
Chris Carlsten replaced
injured junior Mark Graham in
the 190-pound match. Carl
sten was overpowered by Ore
gon senior Curt Strahm.
Tonight, the Cardinal faces
Oregon State at Burnham
Pavilion.
