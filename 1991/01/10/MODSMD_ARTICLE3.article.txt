# NCAA votes for scholarship cuts
## Practice limits won't affect Olympians 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer With AP wire reports 
A series of sweeping reforms
enacted yesterday promises to
change the face of college sports
dramatically, as the NCAA voted
to reduce the number of athletic
scholarships schools can award by
10 percent.
Reform-minded administra
tors, led by the 44-member Presi
dents Commission, have been able
to get virtually all of their legisla
tion passed at the annual NCAA
convention that began Monday in
Nashville, Tenn. Typically a ho
hum event, this year's affair has
probably seen more significant
change than any since the organi
zation voted to sanction women's
sports a decade ago.
Other votes resulted in a reduc
tion in the size of coaching staffs
and several minor recruiting rules

changes. Olympic-caliber athletes
like Janet Evans and Summer
Sanders feared that a proposal
limiting practice time might have
compelled them to leave school in
order to train adequately for their
sports. Though the plan was
passed overwhelmingly, Associate
Athletic Director Cheryl Levick
said she feels it was amended suf
ficiently to "allow Olympians to
train and stay at Stanford."
The University, while not
opposed to reform, found itself
casting its ballot against nearly all
the proposals. "We were a minor
ity vote on many issues," said act
ing Athletic Director Alan Cum
mings.
Stanford currently offers 255
full-ride-equivalent scholarships
spread among 335 athletes. A full
ride-equivalent scholarship costs
the Athletics Department $20,613
