# NCAA votes for scholarship cuts
## Practice limits won't affect Olympians 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer With AP wire reports 
A series of sweeping reforms
enacted yesterday promises to
change the face of college sports
dramatically, as the NCAA voted
to reduce the number of athletic
scholarships schools can award by
10 percent.
Reform-minded administra
tors, led by the 44-member Presi
dents Commission, have been able
to get virtually all of their legisla
tion passed at the annual NCAA
convention that began Monday in
Nashville, Tenn. Typically a ho
hum event, this year's affair has
probably seen more significant
change than any since the organi
zation voted to sanction women's
sports a decade ago.
Other votes resulted in a reduc
tion in the size of coaching staffs
and several minor recruiting rules

changes. Olympic-caliber athletes
like Janet Evans and Summer
Sanders feared that a proposal
limiting practice time might have
compelled them to leave school in
order to train adequately for their
sports. Though the plan was
passed overwhelmingly, Associate
Athletic Director Cheryl Levick
said she feels it was amended suf
ficiently to "allow Olympians to
train and stay at Stanford."
The University, while not
opposed to reform, found itself
casting its ballot against nearly all
the proposals. "We were a minor
ity vote on many issues," said act
ing Athletic Director Alan Cum
mings.
Stanford currently offers 255
full-ride-equivalent scholarships
spread among 335 athletes. A full
ride-equivalent scholarship costs
the Athletics Department $20,613
for the 1990-91 school year,
according to figures provided by
Sue Lemmon, assistant to the ath
letic director. As a result of the
restrictions, at least 20 full-ride
equivalent scholarships — and
perhaps as many as 25 — will be
eliminated by 1994.
Though the measure could
save the financially troubled
department more than $500,000,
the program's top administrators
attending the convention were
distressed by the legislation.
"Our general belief is we're not
in favor of reducing opportunities
for student-athletes," Cummings
said of the new limits on numbers

of scholarships.
Levick echoed a similar senti
ment. "We would've voted for
reduction in budgets (for sports)
or in the number of contests.
[Scholarship cuts are] the last
thing we would've voted for.
"We'd rather save [money] else
where," Levick added. Both did
agree, however, that the budget
relief was welcome. Former Ath
letic Director Andy Geiger said on
several occasions last year that
the department faced a $1 million
deficit in 1989-90.
In all, Cummings tried to look
positively upon the new rules.
"It's clear that the NCAA mem
bership is in favor of cost reduc
tion and reform.... We applaud

those efforts," he said. "Many of
these changes, when fine tuned
and adjusted — and I think
there'll be lots of that — will see
significant and positive improve
ments."
Regardless, he added, Stanford
is "still committed to a broad
based program and will still be
able to offer a healthy and vital
[one]."
Under present rules, schools
can offer up to 95 scholarships in
football. That total will be reduced
to 85 under the new rules. Simi
larly, both men's and women's
basketball will see their maxmi
mums sliced from 15 to 13.
At Stanford, a number of other
sports are funded to the highest

level the NCAA allows and face
cutbacks. According to Lemmon,
golf, gymnastics, swimming, ten
nis and volleyball are at this level
on both the men's and women's
side, as are water polo and base
ball on the men's side. All will be
affected by the cuts.
Track and field and men's soc
cer offer some scholarships but
are well below NCAA limits.
The coaching staff cuts could
be repealed at next year's conven
tion if those arguing against lay
offs can generate sufficent sympa
thy among delegates. Assuming
they stand, though, football coach
Denny Green and basketball
coaches Mike Montgomery and
Tara VanDerveer will each lose

one assistant beginning with the
1992-93 school year.
Mark Marquess may lose two
members of his staff as a result of
coaching cuts in baseball. Cum
mings said Stanford lobbied hard
for less draconian cuts in the sport
but was unable to get the plan
amended.
The time restrictions limit ath
letes to a total of 20 hours of prac
tice and play per week while their
sports are in season and eight
hours in the offseason. When the
plan was first introduced, Evans
threatened to sue the NCAA if it
was enacted. Sanders had stated
her intention to drop out of school
if the rules were changed.
Evans and Sanders are cur

rently in Perth, Australia compet
ing in the World Swimming
Championships and could not be
reached for comment. Levick said
she felt the new rules "allowed
enough flexibility that I think
we'll be OK." A prohibition
against allowing athletes to train
wun their college coach over the
summer was lifted. And, those
choosing to train voluntarily
beyond the 20-hour limit can do
so.
In sports with a safety factor —
swimming, diving, gymnastics
and water polo — coaches can be
present at the voluntary workouts
and even provide skill instruction,
Levick said.

for less draconian cuts in the sport
but was unable to get the plan
amended.
The time restrictions limit ath
letes to a total of 20 hours of prac
tice and play per week while their
sports are in season and eight
hours in the offseason. When the
plan was first introduced, Evans
threatened to sue the NCAA if it
was enacted. Sanders had stated
her intention to drop out of school
if the rules were changed.
Evans and Sanders are cur

rently in Perth, Australia compet
ing in the World Swimming
Championships and could not be
reached for comment. Levick said
she felt the new rules "allowed
enough flexibility that I think
we'll be OK." A prohibition
against allowing athletes to train
wun their college coach over the
summer was lifted. And, those
choosing to train voluntarily
beyond the 20-hour limit can do
so.
In sports with a safety factor —
swimming, diving, gymnastics
and water polo — coaches can be
present at the voluntary workouts
and even provide skill instruction,
Levick said.
A series of sweeping reforms
enacted yesterday promises to
change the face of college sports
dramatically, as the NCAA voted
to reduce the number of athletic
scholarships schools can award by
10 percent.
Reform-minded administra
tors, led by the 44-member Presi
dents Commission, have been able
to get virtually all of their legisla
tion passed at the annual NCAA
convention that began Monday in
Nashville, Tenn. Typically a ho
hum event, this year's affair has
probably seen more significant
change than any since the organi
zation voted to sanction women's
sports a decade ago.
Other votes resulted in a reduc
tion in the size of coaching staffs
and several minor recruiting rules

changes. Olympic-caliber athletes
like Janet Evans and Summer
Sanders feared that a proposal
limiting practice time might have
compelled them to leave school in
order to train adequately for their
sports. Though the plan was
passed overwhelmingly, Associate
Athletic Director Cheryl Levick
said she feels it was amended suf
ficiently to "allow Olympians to
train and stay at Stanford."
The University, while not
opposed to reform, found itself
casting its ballot against nearly all
the proposals. "We were a minor
ity vote on many issues," said act
ing Athletic Director Alan Cum
mings.
Stanford currently offers 255
full-ride-equivalent scholarships
spread among 335 athletes. A full
ride-equivalent scholarship costs
the Athletics Department $20,613
for the 1990-91 school year,
according to figures provided by
Sue Lemmon, assistant to the ath
letic director. As a result of the
restrictions, at least 20 full-ride
equivalent scholarships — and
perhaps as many as 25 — will be
eliminated by 1994.
Though the measure could
save the financially troubled
department more than $500,000,
the program's top administrators
attending the convention were
distressed by the legislation.
"Our general belief is we're not
in favor of reducing opportunities
for student-athletes," Cummings
said of the new limits on numbers

of scholarships.
Levick echoed a similar senti
ment. "We would've voted for
reduction in budgets (for sports)
or in the number of contests.
[Scholarship cuts are] the last
thing we would've voted for.
"We'd rather save [money] else
where," Levick added. Both did
agree, however, that the budget
relief was welcome. Former Ath
letic Director Andy Geiger said on
several occasions last year that
the department faced a $1 million
deficit in 1989-90.
In all, Cummings tried to look
positively upon the new rules.
"It's clear that the NCAA mem
bership is in favor of cost reduc
tion and reform.... We applaud

those efforts," he said. "Many of
these changes, when fine tuned
and adjusted — and I think
there'll be lots of that — will see
significant and positive improve
ments."
Regardless, he added, Stanford
is "still committed to a broad
based program and will still be
able to offer a healthy and vital
[one]."
Under present rules, schools
can offer up to 95 scholarships in
football. That total will be reduced
to 85 under the new rules. Simi
larly, both men's and women's
basketball will see their maxmi
mums sliced from 15 to 13.
At Stanford, a number of other
sports are funded to the highest

level the NCAA allows and face
cutbacks. According to Lemmon,
golf, gymnastics, swimming, ten
nis and volleyball are at this level
on both the men's and women's
side, as are water polo and base
ball on the men's side. All will be
affected by the cuts.
Track and field and men's soc
cer offer some scholarships but
are well below NCAA limits.
The coaching staff cuts could
be repealed at next year's conven
tion if those arguing against lay
offs can generate sufficent sympa
thy among delegates. Assuming
they stand, though, football coach
Denny Green and basketball
coaches Mike Montgomery and
Tara VanDerveer will each lose

one assistant beginning with the
1992-93 school year.
Mark Marquess may lose two
members of his staff as a result of
coaching cuts in baseball. Cum
mings said Stanford lobbied hard
for less draconian cuts in the sport
but was unable to get the plan
amended.
