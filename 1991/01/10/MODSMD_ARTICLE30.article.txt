# INTERMISSION
## THE 						STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINING WEEKLY Stop! Hammer My Milli Vanilli Ice The 						year in music goes from Skinhead O'Connor to the Bartman 
### Tim Marklein Editorial staff 
Blame it on Letterman.
Now is the time of year for every
entertainment reviewer to indulge in
forcing his Top 10 lists down the
throats of his readers. It's a danger
ous exercise since there is inevitable
disagreement, but it's a vital rite of
passage into the New Year; without it
the previous year would not really be
over.
When it comes to music, it's all

but impossible to come up with a Top 10 of best
albums, especially since no class-attending critic
could listen to every release of the past year.
Instead, Intermission will review the year in music
— what was hip, what was hot and what was happen
ing. As you will realize, most of the action was occur
ring off the field anyway.
The "Can't Touch Him Award": M.C. Hammer,
who survived a scathing and petty Rolling Stone
attack to top the Billboard charts. He's not the best
rapper, but he sure can move.
Most offensive thing in Madonna's "Justify My
Love" video: The psychedelic dancer who constantly
appeared waving its arms in a blurry haze — only to
annoy. Oh wait, maybe it's Vogue-ing!
Most unlikely duet pair that worked: Iggy Pop and
the B-52's Kate Pierson, who made the year's sweetest
"Candy."
Most unlikely duct pair that failed: Frank Sinatra
and New Kids on the Block, who ruined the holidays
with their Christmas gift of song.
Best song revived from 1989's dead: Chris Isaak's
"Wicked Game," which the ever-weird David Lynch
graciously picked for his ever-weird flick, "Wild at
Heart."
Biggest bandwagon for critics to jump on, one
album too late (tie): Sinead O'Connor and World
Party, both of whom had brilliant debut albums that

bested their over-hyped follow-ups.
The "Piltdown Man Award" for most successful
hoax of the year: Milli Vanilli and their producers,
who somehow fooled the voters into giving them the
Grammy in the first place.
The "We're Bigger Suckers Than I Thought
Award": The success of Luther Campbell and 2 Live
Crew, who followed up their double-platinum, but
still unrcdeeming "Nasty As They Wanna Be" with
"Banned in the U.S.A."
Most comical trial of the year; Judas Priest, the
headbangers on trial for subliminally suggesting sui
cide on an album listened to by a Reno teenager before
he took his life. The pair kept their wits about them
and showed what a joke America's court system can
be. Only in Reno.
The "Mountain Out of a Molehill Award" for
blowing a story way out of proportion: The national
media, which made a flap over Vanilla Ice's fudged
background. Who really cares? The World Wrestling
Federation has been making up people's pasts forever.
The "Will Somebody Please Yank That Thing
Out of Her Nose Award": Jane Child, who comple
mented her knee-length Bo Derek hair, spiked on top,
with a chain linking ner nose to her ear.
Best idea that will never happen: Ban the Box, an
environmental push to eliminate the bulky CD pack
aging, only to be continuously rejected by record
stores that would have to completely remake their
storage bins.
Most pervasive trend of the year: The unstoppable
flow of greatest hits albums and the two new forms of
rehashing old material: box sets and remix albums. As
if we didn't hear enough of Milli Vanilli the first time.
(Actually, we didn't hear any of Milli Vanilli the first
time.)
Most pervasive trend that makes up for the previ
ous one: The growing market of CD-singles, which
usually contain those two new songs from greatest
hits albums that faithful fans want to have for less


than $16.99.
Best group of 1990 that didn't
even release an album: New Edi
tion, who are much more welcome
in my 'hood than the New Kids on
the Block. Bobby Brown started it
in 1989; Bell Biv Devoe, Johnny
Gill and Ralph TYesvant finished it
in 1990, just increasing the antici
pation level for the impending
New Edition reunion.
Most appealing new kids on
the block: Mariah Carey, Alannah
Myles, Wilson Phillips, Kristen
Vigard, The Sundays, Lisa Stans
field, Digital Underground, Dee-
Lite, Monie Love, Queen Latifah.
They just keep on coming.
Best song ever about another
pop singer: Mojo Nixon's "Don
Henley Must Die" is the obvious
choice.
Best revival by a previously
washed up group: The drug-free
Aerosmith, who seem to be better
than ever with "Janie's Got a Gun"
and other "Pump" hits.
The "Nation Mourns" Award:
Stevie Ray Vaughan, whose death
cut short a brilliant career.
Best use of a hit song by a
Stanford sports team: The
women's basketball national
champions for their use of Ham
mer's "U Can't Touch This."
Scariest prediction for 1991:
Milli Vanilli's second album (or
should I say first?) goes triple plat
inum.
