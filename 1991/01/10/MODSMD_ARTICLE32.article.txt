# Gangland warfare tops '90 movie list
## 
### J.T.S. Moore Editorial staff 
Usually when a
critic writes a top
ten list he prefaces
his choices by
whining that it is
an inexact science
but he tried to be
fair; it is hard to
say if one film is
actually two
notches better

than another, and other weak
kneed, blathering cop outs. I say —
SO WHAT!
This is my top ten list of the
best films of the year. If you don't
agree with me, more power to you!
Top ten lists are written to be criti
cized. If it really matters, send your
own version to me at "The Daily."
I probably forgot something, but
here it is:
10. "Young Guns II" — As
hard as it may be to believe, this
was actually a good western. It had
none of the Brat-Pack-in-cowboy
boots elements of the first "Young

Guns." In fact, the producers
should have given this well-crafted,
well-acted film a totally different
title. By the way, I didn't hear any
Bon Jovi songs until the credits at
the end.
9. "Ghost" — Patrick Swayze,
Demi Moore and Whoopi Gold
berg turned out to be a lot better
together on the screen than they
have been individually in recent
years. The story tried to incorpo
rate a lot of different elements: the
supernatural, romance, suspense
and comedy, and succeeded in pro
ducing a stylish, crowd-pleasing
film. Footnote: "Ghost" was the
number one film at the box office
this year, earning over $200 mil
lion dollars.
8. "Edward Scissorhands" —
This is supposed to be Tim Bur

ton's most personal film to date
and it shows. The visual design is
really wigged-out, but the neigh
borhood looks remarkably similar
to those in San Bruno. The scene
between Edward and Kim when
she asks him to hold her and he
responds "I can't" is one of the best
moments in film this year. But
Wynona, blond hair does not work
on you.
7. "Presumed Innocent" —
This was one of the few intelligent
suspense/dramas of the year Harri
son Ford and his supporting cast
were in fine form. The ending was
both shocking and palatable.
6. "Tremors" — Greg, Kelly,
Chris: I'm not the only critic who
thought this was a good film. Some
guy in Denver said the same thing
on live TV. A cleverly, well-done
send up on '50s horror films,
"Tremors" also presents a moving
portrayal of man versus nature and
an artificially imposed class struc
ture.
5. "Internal Affairs" — Though
it occasionally slips into the tradi
tional police-thriller mode, "Inter
nal Affairs" is a absorbing study in
paranoia and corruption. Stylishly
made and intensely acted, this film
depicts the story of a cop who
investigates other cops. Richard
Gere is evil incarnate and enjoys
every minute of it. Andy Garcia's
excellent performance gives a
sneak preview of his acting tour de
force in"The Godfather, Part III."
4. "Dances With Wolves" —
Kevin Costner took a big risk by
both directing and starring in a
film which favored Native Ameri
cans and ran three hours with sub
titles. Generally speaking, he suc
ceeded beautifully. The scenery is
stunning. The acting is very good.
The buffalo hunt has to be seen to
believed. One problem, though,
was that Costner seemed to be try
ing too hard to make a "Politically
Correct" film.
3. "Postcards From The Edge"
— Meryl Streep deserves a medal
for singing at the end of the film.
She let her hair down for this film
and turned in an incredible comic
performance. Streep may be 41
years old, but she is convincing as
jaded actress in her twenties.
2. "Good Fellas" — I know that
virtually every critics' association
in Los Angeles and New York has
named this the best picture of the
year, but not I. Every element in
Martin Scorsese's film is almost
perfect.
1. Tie: "State of Qrace" and
"The Godfather, Part III"— Like
my number two pick, both of these
films are about organized crime.
"State of Grace" depicts the peas
ant class of crime, the Irish gangs
in New York's Hell's Kitchen,
while "The Godfather, Part III" fol
lows the royalty of the Mob. For
me, v/hat set these two films above
"Good Fellas" were their stunning
climaxes and their overall emo
tional resonance.

supernatural, romance, suspense
and comedy, and succeeded in pro
ducing a stylish, crowd-pleasing
film. Footnote: "Ghost" was the
number one film at the box office
this year, earning over $200 mil
lion dollars.
8. "Edward Scissorhands" —
This is supposed to be Tim Bur

ton's most personal film to date
and it shows. The visual design is
really wigged-out, but the neigh
borhood looks remarkably similar
to those in San Bruno. The scene
between Edward and Kim when
she asks him to hold her and he
responds "I can't" is one of the best
moments in film this year. But
Wynona, blond hair does not work
on you.
7. "Presumed Innocent" —
This was one of the few intelligent
suspense/dramas of the year Harri
son Ford and his supporting cast
were in fine form. The ending was
both shocking and palatable.
6. "Tremors" — Greg, Kelly,
Chris: I'm not the only critic who
thought this was a good film. Some
guy in Denver said the same thing
on live TV. A cleverly, well-done
send up on '50s horror films,
"Tremors" also presents a moving
portrayal of man versus nature and
an artificially imposed class struc
ture.
5. "Internal Affairs" — Though
it occasionally slips into the tradi
tional police-thriller mode, "Inter
nal Affairs" is a absorbing study in
paranoia and corruption. Stylishly
made and intensely acted, this film
depicts the story of a cop who
investigates other cops. Richard
Gere is evil incarnate and enjoys
every minute of it. Andy Garcia's
excellent performance gives a
sneak preview of his acting tour de
force in"The Godfather, Part III."
4. "Dances With Wolves" —
Kevin Costner took a big risk by
both directing and starring in a
film which favored Native Ameri
cans and ran three hours with sub
titles. Generally speaking, he suc
ceeded beautifully. The scenery is
stunning. The acting is very good.
The buffalo hunt has to be seen to
believed. One problem, though,
was that Costner seemed to be try
ing too hard to make a "Politically
Correct" film.
3. "Postcards From The Edge"
— Meryl Streep deserves a medal
for singing at the end of the film.
She let her hair down for this film
and turned in an incredible comic
performance. Streep may be 41
years old, but she is convincing as
jaded actress in her twenties.
2. "Good Fellas" — I know that
virtually every critics' association
in Los Angeles and New York has
named this the best picture of the
year, but not I. Every element in
Martin Scorsese's film is almost
perfect.
1. Tie: "State of Qrace" and
"The Godfather, Part III"— Like
my number two pick, both of these
films are about organized crime.
"State of Grace" depicts the peas
ant class of crime, the Irish gangs
in New York's Hell's Kitchen,
while "The Godfather, Part III" fol
lows the royalty of the Mob. For
me, v/hat set these two films above
"Good Fellas" were their stunning
climaxes and their overall emo
tional resonance.
