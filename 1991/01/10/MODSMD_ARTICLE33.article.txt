# State of the arts at the end of '90: Under fire
## 
### Tim Marklein Editorial staff 
The arts were indeed under attack this year
— in public debate, in the media, in the courts
and in Congress.
Robert Mapplethorpe faced the wrath of
North Carolina's Sen. Jesse Helms — the
keeper of the conservative, Bible Belt flame —
for his explicit, "homoerotic" photography.
A Cincinnati art museum faced a court bat
tle for having an exhibit of "obscenity," also
known as Mapplethorpe's work.
The National Endowment for the Arts faced
stiff criticism for funding explicit and offensive
art, leading to congressional mandate of a non
obscenity pledge for receiving NEA funding. (A
federal judge yesterday declared the law uncon
stitutional — see the World & Nation section.)
On the music front, 2 Live Crew faced
obscenity charges for their album "As Nasty As
They Wanna Be" and for their Florida perfor
mances. They beat the Florida rap, but now face
trial in other states.
A record store owner unsuccessfully faced
"pandering obscenity" charges for selling the
"Nasty" album and now faces prison for doing
what thousands of other stores did without inci
dent.
Judas Priest faced prosecution for hiding sub
liminal messages in their music to induce a
Reno, Nevada teen to commit suicide.
And toward the end of the year, Geffen
Records reneged on a deal to produce an album
by the Geto Boys, while MTV rejected
Madonna's racy "Justify My Love" video.
It was an eventful year for constitutional
scholars, but all too often the issues got con
fused in a search to find a balance between

COMMENTARY

decency and free discourse.
In some of the cases, hints of homophobia
and racism obscured the speech questions
raised. While Mapplethorpe's art could raise
legitimate questions of community subsidiza
tion of offensive material, Helms' attack
seemed to focus mostly on the "homoerotic"
nature of the material. Similarly, the "homo
eroticism" exhibited in Madonna's video proba
bly made MTV overly sensitive about public
reaction to the flick.
Before this year, I don't even recall ever hear
ing the term "homoeroticism."
The decision to prosecute 2 Live Crew, as
opposed to several other artists who have pro
duced similarly offensive material, also had
undertones of racism. But when it comes down
to it, the Crew was the first to really obliterate
existing standards of decency.
In court, the Crew's defense attorneys
claimed the music was "cultural expression"
that could not be understood or judged by the
dominant white culture. The jury bought it, but
the arguments just created more confusion over
the issue.
The lewd, crude and rude language used by 2
Live Crew is not "cultural expression"; it's the
language of sick minds who are banking on the
notoriety they could achieve with such a dis
gusting effort.
I sound like Tipper Gore, but art supposedly
has redeeming qualities, something which is
impossible to see in the Crew's "music." The
display of sexual objectification and hatred
toward women continues with a new song by
the Crew collaborating with another smut

group: "Fake-Hair Wearin' Bitch."
Public Enemy, Ice T, Ice Cube and others can
legitimately claim "cultural expression") 2 Live
Crew can only claim sexual repression.
So, what's to be done about such offensive
speech? Nothing that the courts or the
Congress should worry about. When debates
about the decency of expression move into
those realms, it becomes a debate over freedom
of speech — and free speech will usually bear
itself out.
Furthermore, the justified media attention to
such court battles only serves to increase the
support for — and the profit made by — the
expression. Not that many people supported 2
Live Crew's music, but most in the rock music
world came to the side of an oppressed cohort.
Instead, the debate — and the political
maneuvering — should stay in the community
as a community effort. Most importantly, the
entertainment industry should accept its
responsibility to maintain general standards of
decency.
That's not to say record companies should
force rappers/community spokesmen like Ice T
to take the "F-word" out of his songs, but it does
mean record companies should not bankroll the
purveyors of nothing-but-smut in the hopes of
future profits.
Geffen Records took an important first step
by cutting its deal with the Geto Boys, another
crew that intended only to offend. MTV's move
is also an acceptable attempt to preserve the
decency of its programming.
In the end, the individuals in the community
must work to enforce their own codes of
decency; the courts and Congress cannot, and
should not, play that role.
