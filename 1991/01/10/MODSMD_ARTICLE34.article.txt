CHiPs comic at Dink
When Ponch and John returned from the dangerous field of duty
on the hit show "CHiPs," Artie Grossman would always be there
with a quip to brighten their days. Playing Grossman is actor Paul
Linke's claim to fame, but he's now playing a more serious role.
Linke lost his 37-year-old wife, Francesca, to cancer in 1986, but he
translates that loss into a celebration of life in his one-man perfor
mance Time Flies When You're Alive, being presented at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium Friday at 8 p.m.
Lively weekend o' Arts
Besides the Linke performance, the Lively Arts will play host this
weekend to Soviet pianist Vladimir Feltsman and the Buswell-
Parnas-Luvisi Trio. A graduate of the Moscow Conservatory,
Feltsman left the Soviet Union in 1987 after being denied perfor
mance venues because of his family's 1979 application to emigrate
to Israel. His subsequent debuts at Carnegie Hall and the Kennedy
Center for the Performing Arts led to a busy international concert
schedule and many rave reviews. His performance at Dinkelspiel
Auditorium Saturday at 8 p.m. will include pieces from Bach,
Mozart and Schumann. The Trio performs in the same auditorium
at 2:30 p.m. Sunday, playing pieces by Schubert, Dawson and
Dvorak.
Perlman solos in City
The man truly needs no introduction. Internationally renowned
violinist Itzhak Perlman has played with every major orchestra in
the world, and he'll join the San Francisco Symphony Tuesday for a
recital with pianist Janet Goodman Guggenheim at 8:30 p.m. in
Davies Symphony Hall. The program includes Mozart, Prokofiev,
Grieg and others. Information and tickets are available by calling
431-5400.
