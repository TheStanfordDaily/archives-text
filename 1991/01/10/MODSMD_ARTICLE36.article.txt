The television networks start their so-called second season this
week, full of new shows and revived shows and lacking many oth
ers that fell to the fall ratings ax. The following list summarizes the
new shows beginning in the coming weeks.
Sunday Best (NBC, Sunday 7 p.m.): Starting Feb. 3, this show
will review the best that NBC had to offer the previous week. So, if
you miss your favorite sitcom, you might just catch the best parts of
it Sunday night. If it was good. I thought this is why we all got
VCRs. I give this one three, maybe four weeks at most.
Blossom (NBC, Monday 8:30 p.m.): No one seems to have a
definitive description of this show other than "situation comedy."
Davis Rules (ABC, Tuesday 8:30 p.m.): Beginning Jan. 29,
Randy Quaid and Jonathan Winters star as a high school principal
and his father. Brought to you from the creators of "Roseanne" and
"The Cosby Show," perhaps the worst and best family shows on
television.
Seinfeld (NBC, Wednesday 9:30 p.m.): Beginning Jan. 16, Jerry
Seinfeld delivers to us a refreshing mix of sitcom and stand-up, one
better than Tracy Ullman. A professional comedian, Seinfeld brings
his live acts to the screen, interspersed with related — and humor
ous — sitcom "vignettes."
Equal Justice (ABC, Wednesday 10 p.m.): This show had an ini
tial run last year this time, but didn't quite catch on. Starring Sarah
Jessica Parker, Jon Tenney and Joe Morton, this series focuses on a
group of young district attorneys — kind of an L.A. Law before they
made it big. Rumor has it that last year's flaws were nicely ironed
out, for the most part, and what's left is a lot of promise.
Guns of Paradise (CBS, Friday 8 p.m.): Look out "Gunsmoke"
and "Bonanza," the western is making a comeback. I presume this
will have horses and saloons and gunfights and all. Although, this
being the '90s, it may have an environmental twist. ("Well, I reck
on we could walk to that them bar over thar insteada ridin' our hors
es.") Maybe this is what Reagan's up to now.
Dark Shadows (NBC, Friday 9 p.m.): Beginning Jan. 18, the
gothic soap opera that my parents used to talk about as one of the
"truly great" television series is back. Now, they are my folks, but
they do have some sense of taste.
Under Cover (ABC, Saturday 9 p.m.): Starting Jan. 12, Linda
Purl and John Denison are a suburban couple with three kids, living
a normal happy life. Except for the fact that they're secret agents.
— Tim and Mara, together
