# No 'Food and Shelter'
## ACT's play explores plight of 'new homeless' 
### Anita Schneider Staff writer 
The homeless crisis makes it to
the stage with American Conserva
tory Theater's performance of
"Food and Shelter" Written by Los
Altos-born Jane Anderson, the play
sends a jolt of reality to those of us
who are recovering from our holi
days of excess.
"Food and Shelter" focuses on
one family's plight — Earl, his wife
Lois and their five-year-old daugh
ter Chrissie — as they struggle to
put food in their stomachs and a
roof over their heads at night.
The three — like many other
homeless people in the United
States these days — migrate to Cal
ifornia in search of some kind of
opportunity. Their particular
odyssey begins with a day in Dis
neyland.
Though it is never made clear
why they are willing to spend their
few remaining dollars on Disney
land's high entrance fee, a telling
contrast is set up between the rich
who can afford the price of a hot
dog, and the poor who rummage
through garbage cans for their
meals.
After Disneyland closes, the
family spends the night there, and
Earl and Lois sneak into the Swiss
Family Robinson's bed to take
advantage of a rare moment of pri
vacy. But it's not long before they
hear Chrissie's cries of hunger.
As Earl attempts to break into

an ice cream cart to feed her, he
accidentally knocks her down and
causes her to bump her head. Lois
lashes out at Earl and rushes to her
daughter Aware of his growing lack
of control, Earl tells his wife and
daughter that he must leave them
to avoid hurting them, and agrees
to write to them at a post office box
once he's found a job.
Through most of the second act,
Lois and Chrissie are on their own,
living out of their car, hoping
they'll get another welfare check.
They struggle to make payments
on the post office box as they wait
for Earl's letter to arrive.
"Food and Shelter" is unique in
its perception of the vicious circle
the homeless are faced with. It
exposes clearly the fear, frustration
and hopelessness that leads to
abuse and neglect within such
families.
Ed Hodson as Earl and Cathy
Thomas-Grant as Lois delicately
act out the shades of difference that
might be associated with a couple
who have lost,their home and are
out on the streets — versus people
who have lived there all of their
lives. And Jennifer Lorch is a fine
young performer who is completely
natural on stage as Chrissie.

Performances of "Food and Shel
ter" will run through January 27 at
the Stage Door Theater, 420
Mason Street, San Francisco. For
tickets, call 749-2 ACT or 392-
