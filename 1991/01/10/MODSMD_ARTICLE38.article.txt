# Buffett's 'Frenzy' a Parrothead's paradise; Palmer's power play works

Feeding Frenzy
Grade: A
First, the confessions: I've never been to
a Jimmy Buffett concert, I never really had
a great desire to go, and I really didn't
know his material outside of "Marga
ritaville."
Let's just say I have seen the light.
The Parrotheads — as Buffett calls his
devotees who often adorn various cos
tumes to attend his concerts — already
knew it, but it will come as a pleasant sur
prise to others that this guy can really
throw a party.
From the opening chorus of "You'll
Never Work in Dis Bidness Again" through
the anthemic "Cheeseburger in Paradise"
to the rousing eruption of "Volcano," the
energy level of Buffett and his multi-tal
ented support crew never wanes. There's
no groundbreaking music or knock-you

dead displays of musicianship, but Buffett
makes sure there's plenty of good, old
fashioned musical fun.
Showmanship takes center stage, as
Buffett intersperses humorous anecdotes
and sketches between songs — and works
the crowd like a master. After 25 years of
satisfying his fans, Buffett knows what
works.
The ringleader views himself as a
troubadour or court jester, and sees his
concerts as a "tribal celebration" and a "rite
of summer passage." This is one rite I
won't pass up any longer.
Robert Palmer
Don't Explain
Grade: B
My lasting image of Robert Palmer is
this: on stage for an encore during his last
concert tour, dressed in his traditionally
slick business suit, Palmer belts out the

lyrics to an old Scorpions tune called "Eat
the Rich."
The man thrives on defying description.
For almost two decaaes, Palmer has
been producing music that fits no category
and is often well ahead of its time. For
those who missed out, Palmer brought
them up to date with last year's greatest
hits album, "Addictions."
Now that the times seem to have
caught up with him, Palmer goes back to
the basics: biting guitars, electric rhythms
and smooth crooning. The first half of the
album features more of the former, the sec
ond half more of the latter.
Only Palmer could pull off such a mix,
and usually he does on "Don't Explain."
Less programmed and more energetic than
his last studio effort, "Bossa Nova," this
album scores with sure-fire hits like "Your
Amazing," "You're Mother Should Have
Told Ya" and "You Can't Get Tbo Much of
a Good Thing."

"Top 40" proves Palmer can still have
plenty of fun with his popular success:
"When I make my Tbp 40, smash hit, rock
'n' roll record everything is gonna be just
fine/When I make my Top 40, smash hit,
rock 'n' roll disc I'll be the record com
pany's valentine/No more philosophic
melancholia/Eight hundred pounds of
electric genitalia."
If anything, "Don't Explain" suffers
from a little lack of selectivity. With 18
titles, Palmer's grab bag of songs could
have been pared down to preserve only the
best. Although there's plenty to please,
some of the weaker ballads near the end
will no doubt be left out by those with pro
grammable CD players.
Palmer definitely has an image to live
up to, and his singles and videos play the
part. But there are many more facets of his
character exposed to the fans who faith
fully buy his albums.

Grade: B+
The New Edition solo barrage has come
full circle, with the last of the group releas
ing a debut that again proves the New Kids
predecessors were loaded with talent.
The lead member from the beginning of
the group, Tresvant shines with more than
just his first hit single "Sensitivity."
Mixing the energy of Bobby Brown and
the silkiness of Johnny Gill, "fresvant
finds a comfortable niche between rap and
R&B. Traversing smoothly between the
two styles, TVesvant hits the jackpot with
winners like "Stone Cold Gentleman" and
"Public Figure (Ordinary Guy)."
Don't place your bets on New Kids hav
ing the same solo success.
