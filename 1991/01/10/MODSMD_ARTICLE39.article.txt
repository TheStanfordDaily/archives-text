## 'Godfather III' the least of three, but still the most of movies 
### 
The Godfather, Part 111
Al Pacino. Andy Garcia
Grade: A
Unfortunately for "The Godfather, Part
III" it is not an individual film, but the
final act in the saga of Michael Corleone
(Al Pacino). Since it is unavoidable to judge
it by that standard, I must admit that the
film is not the equal of its predecessors,
but only by the slimmest of margins.
I will forever think that "Part III" is one
sequel that should not have been made.
Not because of the film itself, but because
of the nature of the films that came before
it. The original film depicted Michael's
reluctant re-entry into the family business.
"Part II" completed the evolution.
Michael became what he had wanted to
avoid: a soulless, lonely man. The final
shot, of what was presumed for 16 years to

be the conclusion of the Corleone saga,
showed Michael sitting alone, tired and
pensive. In the background, the wind rus
tled the dead, autumn leaves.
Set in 1979, "Part III" opens with the
camera gliding through the now aban
doned lake house from the earlier film.
Near the end of this brief scene, the cam
era dollies past a pair of windows. In the
frame of the windows are iron silhouettes
of a spider and its web. The story that fol
lows concerns Michael's final attempt to
totally legitimize the Corleone family. In
the process, he is drawn once again into
the violence and deception that he seeks to
escape.
The premise of Francis Ford Coppola's
film proves interesting, but is, at times,
convoluted. Michael attempts to go "legit"
by wrapping the Corleone family in the
Catholic church. The result is a great deal

of Vatican politics and intrigue. The ulti
mate purpose, though, seems to be to force
Michael to seek redemption. If Coppola
had dealt more with this rather than with
the various financial subplots that domi
nate the film he definitely would have been
better off.
At times there seems to be too much
plot, and believe me, I usually like a lot of
it. However, this time around I wanted to
study the characters as they rushed toward
their tragic fates. I wanted to really know
what the Corleone family was about. Cop
pola does a fine job of this, but it's such a
fine job that I wanted to see even more.
Though "Part III" is considerably
shorter than its predecessors, it still weighs
in at a hefty two hours and forty-one min
utes. The middle section set in Sicily tends
to sag compared to the opening and end.
However, it is the ending that erases any

doubt about the quality of "Part III."
The last forty minutes involve an elab
orate, metaphorical opera attended by the
entire Corleone clan. Spliced in with the
action on the stage are tiie multiple assas
sination plots happening simultaneously.
Critics have complained that the assassin
in the opera is too similar to Alfred Hitch
cock's "The Man Who Knew Tbo Much."
Though it would have been refreshing if
Coppola had devised something more orig
inal, the end result still works beautifully.
The last three or four minutes of tne
film are unforgettable, a perfect climax to
the saga. The last scenes confirm my belief
that if Coppola had been given the time,
the entire film would have easily equaled
the others.
Lack of time for crafting the script and
editing the film prove to be the primary
problems. Coppola wanted six months to

write the script; Paramount Studios gave
him six weeks.
The other problems concern the cast.
Robert Duvall's absence is noticeable. He
wanted more money. Sofia Coppola's pres
ence as Mary Corleone is unfortunate. She
was cast literally at the last minute. She
looks the part and gives it her best. How
ever, her inexperience is glaring because
virtually all of her scenes are with two
incredible actors: Pacino and Andy Garcia.
Basically, she was caught in the unenviable
position of doing a favor for her father.
Both Pacino and Andy Garcia, as Vin
cent, deserve Oscar nominations at the
very least.
After seeing "The Godfather, Part III"
twice and thinking about it for two weeks
there is no question in my mind that it is
one of the very best films of the year.
