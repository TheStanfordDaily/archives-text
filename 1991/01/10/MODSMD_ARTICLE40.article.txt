Bonfire of the Vanities
Melanle Griffith, Tom Hanks, Bruce
Willis
Grade: D+
One word about "The Bonfire of the
Vanities" — don't. Don't even consider it.
Unless you have zero previous knowledge
of the Tbm Wolfe classic this film is loosely
— and I mean LOOSELY — based upon,
don't go.
If you've seen the commercials, and
that's all you know, well, that's another
story. "Bonfire" will then prove to be only a
mediocre film instead of a charred disaster.
Visually, director Brian DePalma keeps it
interesting. The acting is okay. Geraldo
Rivera makes a great cameo.
The courtroom ending, with it's
preachy sermon, stinks like burning hair.

Cyrano de Bergerac
Gerard Depardleu
Grade: A-
French actor Gerard Depardieu —
whom "Newsweek" claims is France's
answer to Robert De Niro — portrays the
title character in this sumptuous produc
tion that captures the swashbuckling,

CINEMASCOPE

poetic spirit of Edmond Rostand's original
work.
Depardieu's performance stops at noth
ing short of wonderful, and his rendition of
Cyrano's final speech is particularly mov
ing. Actress Anne Brochet, who plays Rox
anne, is equally impressive. Anthony
Burgess' subtitled translation is eloquent,
while the visual imagery is stunning.
"Cyrano" is definitely one of the finest
films of the year

Edward Sclssorhands
Johnny Depp, Winona Ryder
Grade: A-
Tim Burton ("Beetlejuice" and "Bat
man") directed this bittersweet, enchant
ing adaptation of "Frankenstein" that has a
lot to say about social ostracization.
Johnny Depp plays Edward, a young
man with scissors instead of hands. He is
the creation of an aged inventor (Vincent
Price), who dies before he can endow
Edward with a normal pair of hands, and
Edward remains alone in the inventor's
gothic castle until Avon lady Dianne Wiest

shows up and decides to introduce Edward
to her surbuban world of polyester leisure
suits and pastel colored tract housing.
The off-the-wall premise is refreshingly
and the cinematography beautiful.
Hats off especially to Johnny Depp, who
manages to shed his pretty boy "21 Jump
Street" image in his winsome portrayal of
the befuddled Edward.
-K.P.
Editor's note: The title of this film should
be "Edward Scissorfingers" or "Edward
Scissorshands" since Edward has one full
pair of scissors for each of his fingers.
Intermission feels this needs to be pointed
out.
Havana
Lena Olln, Robert Redford
Grade: D
Robert Redford and Sydney Pollock's
latest collaboration comes off like a wet
Cuban cigar. "Havana" has so much
potential the thought of it makes you sali
vate, but the filmmakers never light any
fires.
The film takes place at the time of the
overthrow of the Batista regime, but the
film conveys none of the excitement or
anxiety of a revolution. It has no impact.

The Cuban revolution is a great event to
be exploited by capitalist Hollywood
moguls. It's too bad that multi-million
aires Redford ind Pollock could not pull it
off.

Look Who's Talking, Too
Klrstie Alley, John Travolta, with the
voices of Bruce Willis and Roseanne
Barr
Grade: D-
This stupid sequel to last year's stupid
— and unexpected — hit movie about a
talking baby is completely unnecessary.
"Look Who's Talking, Too" is a basic
rehash of the original film, although Mikey
the talking baby with Bruce Willis' voice
now has an infant sister, with Roseanne
Barr's voice. . . . This should have been a
horror movie. A big mistake.
— Alex Kostich
Kindergarten Cop
Arnold Schwarzenegger, Penelope
Ann Miller
Grade: A-
I don't like Arnold Schwarzenegger
because he can't act and his name is too
hard to spell. I don't like kids because I

babysat for six years. However, I really
liked this movie. Arnold plays a rough,
tough police detective who bullies people
into testifying for him. (I'm sure you're
shocked by this apparent typecasting.) In
an effort to catch a slimy drug dealer that
he's been hunting for years, Arnie goes
undercover as a kindergarten teacher.
The plot is very straightforward and
predictable, but is full of humorous situa
tions.
A formula film, but one worth watch
ing.

Mermaids
Cher. Winona Ryder
Grade: B
"Mermaids" centers around a divorced
woman and her two daughters (from differ
ent men). It's about . . . well, . . . I'm not
really sure.
The first half of the film was a sweet,
funny glimpse into the life of the Flaxes —
Charlotte in particular. But then, suddenly,
the plot shifted as though someone real
ized they were making a film without any
significant statement. So they tried to rem
edy it in the last 45 minutes.
Which was a mistake.
