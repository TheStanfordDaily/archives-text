Awakenings
Robert DeNlro, Robin Williams
Grade: B
In recent years, the best picture Oscar has
been awarded to films that fall into one of
two categories: either they are liberal-minded
social commentaries, such as "Driving Miss
Daisy," or serious-minded tear-jerkers such
as "Rain Man." Rarely, as L.A. Times critic
Jack Mathews pointed out, are these films
actually the best picture of the year.
And so it goes in 1990; if "Dances With
Wolves" doesn't win the humanistic social
issue vote, then Penny Marshall's "Awaken
ings" is a shoo-in for the weepy melodra
matic choice.
"Awakenings" is so carefully constructed
to tug at your heartstrings that it becomes
predictable after 15 minutes. This emo
tional roller coaster goes from soaring
heights to depressing depths with such cal
culated precision that you can get your han
kie right in time for the upcoming tear-jerker
scene.
The film is based on Dr. Oliver Sacks'
book of the same name, the story of his work
with a group of post-encephalitic patients in
1969. Encephalitis was a "sleeping sickness"
epidemic which swept the world during the
19205. People stricken with the disease
became catatonic, remaining immobile and
seemingly unconscious for decades.
Sacks urged hospital officials to allow him
to treat the patients with a new experimental
drug, L-DOPA. The administration was hes
itant, but eventually he was allowed to
administer the drug. The comatose patients,
who were regarded as the "living dead,"
slowly awakened to find themselves func

tioning in a changed world.
Robin Williams portrays Dr. Sacks,
named Malcolm Sayer here, while Robert
DeNiro plays one of his primary patients.
Williams, who has never played a charac
ter this serious and demure, is outstanding.
His Dr. Sayer is socially inept and reclusive,
having no external interests outside of treat
ing his patients. A false move on Williams'
part could have easily collapsed his character
into ultimate geekaom> instead, Williams
makes him endearing, respectable and mod
estly heroic.
DeNiro, as patient Leonard Lowe, is
equally remarkable. His initial awakening
and inevitable relapse are performed with
such physical dexterity that his involuntary
shaking and crumpled posture seem eerily
natural.
As Leonard's muscles slowly turn to
stone and his body deteriorates, DeNiro's
eyes indicate desperation at his loss of dig
nity and personal freedom. Such scenes are
truly heartbreaking.
Yet other sequences fall flat. When
DeNiro's character 112 irst wakes up from his
catatonic state, he crosses a room to hug his
mother. While the scene is filled with tri
umph and joy (not to mention a powerful
score), it is staged no differently than a Hall
mark commercial — sweet, yes, but also
unrealistic and a trifle manipulative. DeNiro
occasionally seems to be parodying Dustin
Hoffman in "Rain Man," such as in the
scene in which he turns unpredictably vio
lent — remember the airport scene in "Rain
Man"?
Director Penny Marshall showed a flair
for sentimental comedy with her directorial
debut in "Big." It is not surprising, then, that

"Awakenings" works best when it goes for
feel-good laughs rather than heart-wrench
ing drama. Marshall smartly avoids elevat
ing the patients to saintly heroes — often,
she finds humor in them. For example, one
patient can only "wake up" when a Led Zep
pelin guitar riff is played.
To tackle such an ambitious project is
commendable on Marshall's part, but she
takes a paint-by-numbers approach that is

endemic to TV disease movies. "Awaken
ings" is certainly a worthy film, but it is in
no way outstanding or memorable. It is a
rather routine hospital-ward tear-jerker that
takes all the expected emotional dips and
turns. For this reason alone it will charm
the pants off of Oscar voters and all those
people who loved "Beaches." But will it stand
the test of time as a weepy classic?
