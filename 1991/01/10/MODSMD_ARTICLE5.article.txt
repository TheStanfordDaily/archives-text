# Kennedy visits D.C. seeking cost policy support

### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
In an apparent effort to garner fed
eral support for Stanford's indirect cost
policies, University President Donald
Kennedy has spent the past two days in
Washington, D.C.
Stanford public affairs officials have
been tight-lipped about the trip's
itinerary, offering only that Kennedy
was in the nation's capital conducting
"University business." In an interview
earlier this week, Assoc. Vice President
for Public Affairs Larpr Horton said
some of the "business" is related to the
controversy that has arisen over Stan
ford's indirect cost policies. Horton, who
accompanied Kennedy on the trip,
refused to discuss the issue any further.

Kennedy had been scheduled to
attend the annual NCAA convention in
Nashville, Tenn., this week, but the
Washington trip "took precedence,"
according to Bob Hamrdla, an assistant
to Kennedy.
Stanford's indirect cost policies are
the subject of three current federal
investigations â€” by the House Subcom
mittee on Oversight and Investigations,
the General Accounting Office and the
Inspector General of the Office of Naval
Research. The investigations were
prompted by allegations of impropriety
made by Paul Biddle, ONR's campus
representative.
The House subcommittee, chaired by
Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., is expected
to hold hearings on the issue in late
February or early March.

Earlier this week, sources close to the
investigation speculated that Kennedy
might meet with Dingell or his staff on
this trip. However, both Horton and an
aide to Dingell said no such meeting was
scheduled.
In preparation for the hearings, the
University has hired Washington attor
ney Thomas Ryan of Wunder, Ryan &
Cannon and D.C. lawyer-lobbyist James
Fitzpatrick of Arnold & Porter.
Both Ryan and Fitzpatrick were
included on a list published last spring
by "Legal Times" of seven lawyers and
lobbyists who specialize in representing
clients before Dingell's subcommittee.
"Legal Times" is a trade publication for
lawyers.
Fitzpatrick was hired a year
ago by Pfizer Inc. to smooth over
relations with Dingell after the
company had come under fire for
selling defective heart valves and
faced hearings by Dingell's sub

committee.
Indirect costs are those costs of
research, such as electricity,
maintenance and administrative
overhead, that are not easily
attributable to a specific project.
The government reimburses
Stanford for both the direct and
indirect costs incurred by work on
federally sponsored research.
