# Biddle lowers estimate of alleged overbiling

### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
It won't make life much easier for Stanford,
but Paul Biddle, the Navy representative who
cried foul over the University's indirect cost
policies, has lowered his estimate of how much
the alleged wrongdoing will cost Stanford.
In a 15-page letter Biddle sent to University
President Donald Kennedy in mid-December,
Biddle estimates that the government over-
reimbursed Stanford by $69-$ 175
million during the 1980s. A copy
of the letter was obtained by The
Daily.
Earlier this fall, reports sur
faced that Stanford had overbilled
the government by more than
$200 million. Some press reports
said the figure was as high as
$300 million.
The figures were leaked to the
press by members of the House
Subcommittee on Oversight and
Investigations, one of three fed
eral agencies investigating Stan
ford's indirect cost policies. Bid
die is widely believed to be the
source of the subcommittee's
information.
In his letter to Kennedy, how
ever, Biddle wrote, "It is regret
table that a figure bandied about

in the papers of $300 million of
questioned cost occurred. This
amount is one I could not charac
terize as likely."
Biddle is the campus represen
tative of the Office of Naval
Research, the federal agency
responsible for negotiating
research costs with Stanford. The
Inspector General of ONR is con
ducting one of the three ongoing
investigations.
Biddle indicated to Kennedy
that he had passed the estimate of
$69-$175 million along to the
Inspector General. The Navy's
report, which has been delayed
for several months, is expected to
be released later this month,
according to ONR public affairs
officials.
Last month, the Chief of Naval
Research established a five-per
son panel to address concerns
raised by Biddle. The panel's next
meeting with Stanford officials is
Jan. 15.
