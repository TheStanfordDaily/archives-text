## 
### David Bianco Editorial staff 
While the ASSU Senate is still
considering a proposal to limit its
focus to Stanford-related issues,
the debate will no longer be set
tled at tonight's meeting.
Senate chair Solina Kwan post
poned the vote on Senate Bill XXI
AR-8 until the Jan. 24 senate
meeting at the request of the bill's
author, graduate senator John
Overdeck. The bill would limit
senate bills and resolutions to
"University-related matters of an
academic, administrative, fiscal
and social nature."
Overdeck, who does not expect
the bill to pass, nonetheless said
he feels the senate is not ready to
vote on it. "There's been no
debate on the issue." He would
like to debate the issue in a public
"show" with fellow senator David
Brown, a senior who opposes the
bill.
The bill was originally intro
duced in response to student
objections over a senate bill
passed Nov. 15 opposing an unpro
voked, non-U.N.-sponsored U.S.
militaiy offensive in the Persian
Gulf. Last year, the senate also
passed bills on issues ranging
from the United Farm Workers
grape boycott to the murder of
Central American Jesuit priests.
Overdeck said he feared that if
the bill were debated tonight, dis
cussion would revolve around U.S.
Gulf policy, which he called "philo
sophically separate" from his bill.
To ensure that the vote will not
happen at tonight's meeting,
Overdeck asked senate chair
Solina Kwan last night to remove
it from the agenda.
Kwan, a junior, agreed and
called Overdeck's decision a "wise
move."
