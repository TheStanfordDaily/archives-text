# Fee refund drop benefits groups

The ASSU Speakers Bureau saved close to
$5,500. The Black Student Union gained almost
$2,500. For KZSU, the windfall was over $7,000.
A new fund-raising technique for student organi
zations? Hardly. The ASSU's revamped fee refund
system has seen more than 1,000 fewer students
request fee refunds than under the previous system.
For most organizations, the change amounts to over
all refunds that are thousands of dollars less than
they were last fall quarter.
And student leaders couldn't be happier.
"I think it's really great that people are taking
less money back," said Maria Peters, co-chair of
MEChA, a Chicano/Latino student group. Only
2,422 students requested refunds of the 80-cent
MEChA fees for a total refund of $1,937.60, whereas
last fall quarter 4,304 students did so. Last fall, with

a one dollar fee, refunds were $4,304.
In all, approximately 2,700 students requested fee
refunds, as compared to well over 4,000 during fall
quarter last year. ASSU Financial Manager Torrence
Boone attributes much of the drop to confusion over
the new, computerized refund request system he
implemented.
Under the old system, students requesting fee
refunds would typically have to wait in long lines to
be given cash refunds. The new system requires stu
dents to fill out a computerized form and return to
the ASSU offices to pick up a check.
According to Boone, any fee refund system must
strike a balance between the ease of access and the
number of people requesting refunds. "You can't dis
courage [fee refunds]," he said. "But you can't make
it so easy for students that everyone would request a
fee refund."

Because of confusion about the ASSU's new computerized fee refund system, total refunds fall quarter
for many organizations were several thousand dollars less than last fall.
