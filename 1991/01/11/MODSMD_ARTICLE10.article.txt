WASHINGTON (AP) — A somber Congress yes
terday sped toward its starkest war-and-peace deci
sion since World War 11, and leaders in both parties
predicted President Bush would get what he wants:
authority to take the nation to war in the Persian
Gulf.
Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., said it would be
"unthinkable" for Congress to undercut Bush after
the United States had led the international coalition
against Saddam Hussein, and he contended it had
become clear economic sanctions would not force
Iraq out of Kuwait.
"The captain cannot abandon the ship," Dan
forth said. "It is not an option of the U.S. Congress
to disapprove what we for months have asked others
to support."
Supporters and opponents of the president intro
duced competing resolutions — one giving authority
for war, the other asserting that sanctions and diplo
macy must be given more time to work — as Tues
day's United Nations deadline for Iraqi withdrawal
bore down.
The weight of the decision facing lawmakers was
apparent as the debate unfolded in both chambers.
"There is a real understanding that this is a moment
of profound decision" that will affect "the whole
planet," said Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga.
Democratic leaders pressed for the go-slow
approach.
"The only debate here in Congress is over
whether we slowly strangle Saddam with sanctions
or immediately pursue a military solution," sai<J
House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.

"We say we can win without war, and the evidence is
on our side."
But both House Speaker Thomas Foley and Sen
ate Republican Leader Bob Dole have said the force
authorizing version had votes to spare in both
houses. Numerous lawmakers said the failure of the
U.S.-Iraq talks in Geneva on Wednesday would help
Bush's case.
Both chambers convened yesterday to begin con
sidering the war-and-peace issue, with decisive votes
expected this weekend.
The margin for Bush seemed most comfortable in
the House, less so in the Senate, where the outcome
hinged on the decisions of half a dozen or so conser
vative Democrats. A bipartisan group, including the
key senators, met at the White House with Bush yes
terday afternoon.
Bush's backers said their resolution was tanta
mount to a declaration of war.
It cites Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, Bagh
dad's nuclear and chemical weapons programs and
the international consensus against Saddam Hus
sein, concluding that Bush should be authorized to
use military force.
"At this late hour in the crisis," said sponsor
Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., "the last, best hope for a
peaceful resolution (is to) leave no doubt in the mind
of Saddam Hussein that the United States is
united."
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, who
introduced that version in the Senate, said going to
war now would leave forever unanswered the ques
tion of whether young Americans died needlessly.
