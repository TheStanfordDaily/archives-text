Firms restrict employee travel outside U.S.
NEW YORK (AP) — Numerous large U.S. corporations said
yesterday they have banned or sharply restricted employee travel
outside the United States amid heightened fears of war in the
Middle East.
The sweeping restrictions, ranging from one week to indefinite
durations, were meant to protect workers from terrorist attacks
or other Middle East-related violence.
Safety fears intensified after Wednesday's collapse of U.S.-Iraq
diplomatic talks, which broke down a week before the U.N.'s Jan.
15 deadline for Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait.
Restrictions imposed by Ford Motor Co., Chrysler Corp.,
Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing Co. and other corpo
rations could deal yet another blow to the troubled airline indus
try.
In addition to restricting new trips, 3M said it was ordering all
employees currently traveling in foreign countries to return home
immediately, including U.S.-based employees in Europe and
European employees in the United States.
A Ford spokesman said starting Monday, one day before the
Jan. 15 deadline, its 150,000 U.S. employees would be barred
from traveling to any countries except Canada and Mexico. The
ban was to last at least one week.
Chrysler Corp. pulled the plug on international travel except to
Canada and Mexico effective Wednesday, said Alan Miller, a
spokesman for the Highland Park, Mich.-based company.
Politicians join gays to charge police brutality
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Gay activists and four city supervi
sors on yesterday charged Sacramento sheriffs deputies with
brutalizing protesters arrested during Gov. Wilson's inaugural
and with shouting anti-homosexual slogans at them.
Four supervisors flanked activists who said they were
slammed against jail house walls, subjected to obscenities and
called 'faggots" by sheriffs officers, while being booked at
Sacramento County Jail on Monday.
"We don't expect high-class etiquette when we are arrested,
but we don't expect to be slammed against the wall repeatedly ...
or to be called a 'homo' or a 'fag,' " said Jonathan Katz, a protest
organizer at Wilson's inaugural Monday in the Sacramento
Convention Center.
"These people were offered citations in the field by police and
refused to accept them. They came into the jail with a confronta
tional attitude and attempted to elicit confrontations with our
officers," said Deputy Ed Close, spokesman for the Sheriff's
Department.
