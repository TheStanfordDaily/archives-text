# U.N. chief to propose phased withdrawal
## Eleventh-hour diplomatic effort offers glimmer of hope for peace 
### 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) - Secretary-
General Javier Perez de Cuellar is expected to
propose the phased withdrawal of Iraqi and
U.S.-led multinational forces supervised by
U.N. peacekeepers, diplomats said yesterday.
The U.N. chief was setting off for Europe
and the Middle East on Thursday night on a
peacekeeping mission.
His flight plan was changed at the last
minute to have him arrive Friday morning in
Paris, rather than Geneva, due to unspecified
"security reasons," spokeswoman Nadia
Younes said. She would not elaborate.
French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas
will meet Perez de Cuellar in Paris, and the
two will travel to Geneva together to meet
with the other EC foreign ministers, the
French UN. Mission announced.
Neither they nor the U.N. press department
could confirm whether French President
Francois Mitterrand would also meet the U.N.
chief, but diplomats said they would not be

surprised if the two met briefly.
Diplomats and U.N. officials, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the United
Nations has worked out possible plans to have
U.N. peacekeepers monitor the withdrawal of
the Iraqis from Kuwait and the multinational
force from Saudi Arabia.
"Of course, if there is a withdrawal of the
Iraqi forces, there will be a role for the United
Nations peacekeeping forces," Perez de Cuel
lar told reporters at U.N. headquarters.
U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani said
later that "I think that will be probably dis
cussed, possibly, in Baghdad, although we
don't know.
"At the moment there is no such intention
to have this specific proposal," he added.
"Depending on how the talks go, it certainly
could be mentioned."
The peacekeeping proposal is an idea that
the Nordic countries, led by Norway, discussed
on Monday with Perez de Cuellar. One of the

Nordic ambassadors said afterward that the
U.N. chief had his aides working on the con
cept.
Under the plan, a U.N. force would monitor
the Iraqi withdrawal and establish a buffer
zone between the Iraqi and U.S.-led multina
tional forces.
The withdrawal of the entrenched Iraqi
troops would take weeks, perhaps months,
diplomats said.
After the Iraqi withdrawal, the U.S.-led
forces could complete their pullout, and the
Kuwaiti government would be restored, fulfill
ing the Security Council's demands contained
in resolutions passed since the Aug. 2 inva
sion.
Kuwaiti diplomats have privately con
firmed that their government would resume
the negotiations with Baghdad that broke off
when the invasion began. The two key points
of dispute were oil revenues and access to the
Persian Gulf.
