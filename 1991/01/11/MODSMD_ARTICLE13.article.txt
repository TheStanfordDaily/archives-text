# Moscow threatens Lithuania with direct rule
## 
### 
VILNIUS, U.S.S.R (AP) -
President Mikhail Gorbachev yes
terday demanded that Lithuania
suspend its drive for indepen
dence or risk direct rule by the
Kremlin.
Leaders of the restive Baltic
republic rejected his threat and
appealed for Western support.
Gorbachev was reinforcing the
hard line he took Monday when he
ordered paratroopers into seven
secessionist republics, including
Lithuania, to help round up draft
dodgers and deserters.
About 5,000 Lithuanians
massed outside the parliament in
Vilnius to support the drive for
independence after hearing of
Gorbachev's action on radio and
TV. About 500 others were

reported gathered at the repub
lic's television tower.
They feared takeover attempts
by the paratroopers.
The crowd outside parliament
later thinned out, but about 1,000
said they would spend the night.
Uniformed nationalists, some
with truncheons, stood guard
inside and outside parliament.
Residents brought them food and
cigarettes.
Thousands of pro-Kremlin
protesters held counter-demon
strations and planned strikes to
back up demands that presiden
tial rule be imposed in Lithuania
and that the Soviet constitution
be re-adopted.
Lithuanian lawmakers work
ing into the night replaced Prime

Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene
with Albertas Simenas, a 40-year
old economist who was nominated
by Lithuanian President Vytautas
Landsbergis. Prunskiene resigned
Tuesday in a dispute with her leg
islature over price increases.
Thousands of paratroopers
were reported mobilized the last
few days. But Gorbachev has been
taking the harshest measures
against Lithuania, the republic
most advanced and radical in its
independence drive.
A deputy Soviet defense minis
ter, Gen. V Achalov, said in an
interview published yesterday
that 1,000 paratroopers were sent
to Lithuania to search for more
than 13,000 draft dodgers and
Red Army deserters.

Some radical hard-line politi
cians have urged Gorbachev to
impose direct rule over ethnic
hotspots, saying independence
movements by all 15 republics is
the greatest threat to the country.
In the statement to the Lithua
nian parliament released by the
state news agency Tass, Gor
bachev accused the republic's law
makers of violating the Soviet
constitution, infringing on citi
zens' rights and ignoring his
decrees.
Gorbachev said citizens, social
and political organizations and
others demanded "restoration of
constitutional order, reliable guar
antees of the security and normal
conditions of life.... They demand
introduction of presidential rule."
