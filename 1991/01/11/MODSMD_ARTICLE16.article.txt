Where U.S. diplomacy
failed, European, U.N.
efforts might succeed

IT IS TOO EARLY to say that
negotiation has failed in the
Middle East. Arguably, negotia
tion has not even been attempted.
Wednesday's talks between Sec
retary of State James Baker and
Iraqi foreign minister Tariq Aziz
showed only how little the present
straight-arm diplomacy can accom
plish.
President Bush has insisted
upon Iraq's immediate and uncon
ditional withdrawal from Kuwait,
an option he knows Saddam Hus
sein cannot accept. The United
States has therefore offered Sad
dam Hussein a choice between
humiliation and war.
Despite worldwide hopes for
meaningful discussion with Sad
dam Hussein, both the White
House and Iraq turned Wednes
day's talks in Geneva into another
round of this international game of
chicken.
The idea that the United States
is "sending a message" by punish
ing aggression is ludicrous. The
United States, like any nation,
tends to find aggression punish
ably obnoxious when its own inter
ests are threatened â€” and to look
upon the aggression of its allies
with indulgence, as it did when
Iraq invaded Iran in 1980.
Few of the world's players doubt
that the United States is acting in
its own interest, on its own behalf.
And those players are becoming
increasingly disillusioned with the
anti-Iraq alliance as the White
House's refusal to negotiate brings
them to the brink of war. France,
one of the United Nations Security

Council's five permanent mem
bers, is even now pressing for a
diplomatic solution. Other mem
bers of the European community
have sought to negotiate directly
with Saddam.
A majority of our allies support
the offer of a Palestinian peace con
ference as a small concession that
might avert the bloodshed of a war
with Iraq. Many believe that Sad
dam may be looking for exactly
such a way out of a war with the
United States, if only he is offered
a creditable alternative.
Israel and its supporters under
standably fear that such a confer
ence would focus attention on Arab
grievances against Israel and
would accomplish little toward
solving the problems plaguing the
Middle East. But the prospect of a
peace conference in one of the
world's most troubled regions
should earn at least the considera
tion of any President for whom it
might be the way to avoid a bloody
war.
Such a concession, if extended,
might not avoid a war with Sad
dam Hussein. But it would rally
the world around the reasonable
position of a United States
earnestly interested in peace.
We should not feel compelled to
resort to force next Tuesday. Jan.
15 is not a deadline for diplomacy;
it is an arbitrary date chosen by the
United Nations Security Council
as the day when force becomes an
option.
The United States must attempt
to negotiate, and to negotiate
meaningfully, at every turn in the
weeks that follow.
The Iraq crisis presents few cer
tainties.
One thing, however, is clear: if
President Bush continues to pre
sent a proud and aggressive dicta
tor with the choice between humil
iation and violence, the United
States will be going to war.
