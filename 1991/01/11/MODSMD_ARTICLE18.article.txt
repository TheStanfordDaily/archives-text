## Mistah Kurtz — he dead

UP UNTIL THEN, MY QUARTER
had gone pretty well. Social life,
classes — I even had extra points
at Ricker. I was having a pretty good time.
But there I was, my first night home
for break, in my car at four in the morn
ing with the girl I went out with in high
school. And she's crying on my lap, telling
me that she still cares for me. That she
wishes we could still be close. That she no
longer knows who I am. Or how I feel.
So I calm her down, and talk to her
rationally, and hold her in my arms. But
the thing is, I didn't really feel it. I knew
what to do, and I did it. It was almost like
watching a movie. And the worst part is, I
know that I care about her. Only I
couldn't make myself feel it.
Before you stop reading, understand
that I'm not trying to write a cynical epi
logue to the "Sweet Valley High" series.
It's more than that.
The week before I came back to school,
a good friend of mine lost one of his
grandparents. So I spent a lot of time
talking to him. I knew the right things to
say and the right looks to give. But I
couldn't feel it. Even while I was talking
to him, half of my mind was thinking
about something else.
I feel like I can't feel.
Over break my family went to a ther
apy session, and the counselor kept say
ing things like, "Well, how does that make
you feel?", and the only thing that went
through my mind was this nagging suspi
cion that she had undergone RA training.
So I don't know what to do. I thought
about going to the Bridge, but I figured
that if I can't feel for my friends and fam

ily, the last people I'm going to open up to
are the guys who came to our dorm for
those "massage workshops." I didn't even
trust the oil they gave us.
Besides, if I'm depressed, I don't want
to go to a place called "The Bridge". How
about "The Noose" or "The Loaded
Revolver?" Hello, McFly?
So I figured I'd try to make myself a
more sensitive person. I kept listening to
Chicago 17. I started watching Donahue.
But none of it worked, and I just didn't
have the time for one of those "Wild Man"
weekends.
Actually, I knew what had to be done. I
once heard that you can't love until
you've experienced real pain. If I wanted
to feel, I had to give up some of the com
fort.
You see, I'd gotten pretty good at hav
ing a pretty good time. I couldn't remem
ber the last big emotional shift I went
through. I had even built a deep-rooted
hatred for the kind of people who group
hug every time that Wilson Phillips song
comes on the radio.
For years now, every time my parents
ask me what I want for my birthday, I tell
them that I don't want anything. (Except
to have Downtown Julie Brown deported.
And my parents just don't have that kind
of pull.) And I'm not even trying to be the
nice guy. When I was eight, I wanted to be
an actor, then someone told me how silly
that was. Since then, I can't recall ever
really wanting anything.
My life has been going really smoothly
for some time now. It's been comfortable.
It's hard to see that something is
wrong with your life when you're content.

I was so good at being content that I
expected everyone else to be content as
well. So it came as quite a shock when I
found someone crying on my lap.
I grew up in a nice, suburban, three
car, Interplak-using family, where I didn't
have to worry about being hungry or
lonely. My whole path was set from the
very beginning. I would never have to be
dependent upon anyone, not even myself.
So I opted for safety. Safety and selfish
ness.
What I really opted for was anesthesia.
And now I want someone to tear down the
careful wall of CDs and casual friends
which I had spent so long building. I can't
remember ever putting myself on the
line, and now I want someone to chal
lenge all of it, even if it means I might
bleed a little.
But I don't really. It's too scary to
chance the comfort of my Magic Kingdom
roller coaster, with its safe, controlled
dips and thrills, for a world in which I
might one day find myself crying on
someone's lap at four in the morning.
"It is all poverty and dirt and a miser
able ease."
Hey, what did you expect — penis
jokes? Wake up, it's winter quarter.

more sensitive person. I kept listening to
Chicago 17. I started watching Donahue.
But none of it worked, and I just didn't
have the time for one of those "Wild Man"
weekends.
Actually, I knew what had to be done. I
once heard that you can't love until
you've experienced real pain. If I wanted
to feel, I had to give up some of the com
fort.
You see, I'd gotten pretty good at hav
ing a pretty good time. I couldn't remem
ber the last big emotional shift I went
through. I had even built a deep-rooted
hatred for the kind of people who group
hug every time that Wilson Phillips song
comes on the radio.
For years now, every time my parents
ask me what I want for my birthday, I tell
them that I don't want anything. (Except
to have Downtown Julie Brown deported.
And my parents just don't have that kind
of pull.) And I'm not even trying to be the
nice guy. When I was eight, I wanted to be
an actor, then someone told me how silly
that was. Since then, I can't recall ever
really wanting anything.
My life has been going really smoothly
for some time now. It's been comfortable.
It's hard to see that something is
wrong with your life when you're content.

I was so good at being content that I
expected everyone else to be content as
well. So it came as quite a shock when I
found someone crying on my lap.
I grew up in a nice, suburban, three
car, Interplak-using family, where I didn't
have to worry about being hungry or
lonely. My whole path was set from the
very beginning. I would never have to be
dependent upon anyone, not even myself.
So I opted for safety. Safety and selfish
ness.
What I really opted for was anesthesia.
And now I want someone to tear down the
careful wall of CDs and casual friends
which I had spent so long building. I can't
remember ever putting myself on the
line, and now I want someone to chal
lenge all of it, even if it means I might
bleed a little.
But I don't really. It's too scary to
chance the comfort of my Magic Kingdom
roller coaster, with its safe, controlled
dips and thrills, for a world in which I
might one day find myself crying on
someone's lap at four in the morning.
"It is all poverty and dirt and a miser
able ease."
Hey, what did you expect — penis
jokes? Wake up, it's winter quarter.
