# Bush sends letter to college papers
## President tries to communicate directly with students about Gulf crisis 
### Michael Friedly Editorial staff 
President George Bush sent an open
letter to university newspapers across
the country trying to persuade college
students of the correctness of his poli
cies in the Persian Gulf conflict.
The letter was sent to 460 university
newspapers in all parts of the country.
Earlier in the week, the White House
released a small number of copies to
selected newspapers, but waited until
today to release the remainder.
White House Press Secretary Marlin
Fitzwater addressed Bush's letter at a
daily briefing to reporters yesterday at
the White House. "We have tried to com
municate with any number of audi
ences. We have had the radio address

and television address
to allied countries, and
we think students rep
resent an important
segment of the popula
tion.
"Certainly many of
their friends and peers
are in the Saudi Ara
bian desert, are directly
involved in this effort.

And the President felt it was important
to communicate with them directly," he
said.
The letter is printed in its entirety in
the Opinions section of today's Daily.
The letter was phrased in strong
rhetoric condemning Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein's invasion of neighbor
ing Kuwait. Bush said the issue was

"black and white. The facts are clear.
The choice unambiguous. Right versus
wrong."
Fitzwater said yesterday that it was
not Bush's intention to discuss the pos
sibility of a military draft in the letter,
nor was it an attempt to imply that a
draft would be instituted.
Many college newspapers across the
country have decided to run the letter as
an opinions piece, while others are writ
ing stories on Bush's overture, accord
ing to Andrew Rosenthal of The New
York Times.
The University of Washington news
paper, The Daily, has included an edito
rial cartoon that depicts Bush spouting
off the rhetoric in the letter with the
