# Bug looks at mail and male
## 
### Amy Gillett Staff writer 
Dear Bug,
My mother was here last year
for her 25th Stanford reunion,
and on a whim she decided to try
to open her old P.O. box. More
amazing than the fact that she
remembered her combination was
the fact that it still worked. Does
the post office rotate combinations
on a 25-year schedule, or do they
just trust alumni not to steal our
mail?

Dear OOZA,
NO, the post office does not
trust alums not to steal our mail.
We all know that Stanford alums
are often strapped for letters,
magazines and free offers.
That filched copy of Rolling
Stone, that Vacation Home Pub
lisher's Clearinghouse Sweep
stakes offer, that letter from
someone else's grandmother — all
can be just the thing to lift them
out of their rut.
In order not to tempt the
alums into dipping their aging
hands into our boxes, the post
office changes the combination
each time someone rents a box.
At least that's the official post
office line. When I told the phone
receptionist of the post office your
story (which I have taken the lib
erty of entitling "Mom and Her
Sick and Unnatural Attachment
to her College P.O. Box"), he
"refused to comment on the inci
dent "without knowing all of the
facts."
How hard did your mother pull
the box open? What sharp instru
ments did she have in hand when
the post office box miraculously
"popped open?" When was the last
time she had her teeth sharpened?
How many cars has your mother
successfully broken into? Does
your mother practice white
magic?
As you can imagine, the num
ber of possible explanations for
why the box opened are limitless.
Of course, the combination could
not have remained the same. And

the chances that it was changed
back into the same combination it
was one quarter century ago are
even more remote.
Is your mother wandering
around campus with her old room
keys by any chance?
Dear Bug,
I have been told that all men
want the same thing and that I
should always be on guard
against them; a good girl can
never be too careful. I think this is
good advice and, 1 have been fol
lowing it scrupulously, but I have
a question for you which has been
bothering me for quite some time.

What would be so bad about
giving in to their demands and
actually proofreading their
papers ? All my male friends have
asked me to do this but I don't
know if it's okay or not.
—Editorially Frustrated
Dear E.F.,
The general therapeutic wis
dom of the '90s is that if two con
senting adults agree to engage in
an activity, neither of them is
harmed by it, and it does not vio
late the Stanford policy on the
treatment of stray campus cats, it
is okay. Recreational proofreading
is no exception.
However, if the document in
question is to be submitted as
homework, editorial assistance
becomes a moral issue rather than
a social one.
Is it moral to rewrite a friend's
paper if the price is right, or, in
your case, if you can get a date out
of it? I wasn't sure, so I checked
with the Honor Code.

As it turns out, this is NOT
considered "honorable academic
work." It is in the same Honor
Code Deadly Sins category as
LUST of someone else's writing
(otherwise known as "plagia
rism").
You may proofread for spelling
and grammatical errors. Just be
sure not too give too much away
— you don't want to jeopardize
those lovely scruples.
Dear Bug,
I've heard of Harvardians and
Yalies, but what do you call a
Stanford student? Stanfordite?
Stanforder? Stan ford fair lane?
— Stanfordite?
Dear Identity Crisis Sufferer,
Although your question sounds
so stupid that it is hard to imagine
anyone would want to debate it, it
has miraculously stirred quite a
controversy.
People from the Slavic Depart
ment seems to think the term
should be either "Stanfordists" or
Leland Stanford Juniorists," in
the tradition of Marxists, Lenin
ists and Titoists.
Representatives of the French
Department claim the term is
"Stanfordeur" for men and "Stan
fordette" for women.
If you want to find an uncon
troversial title for yourself, you
may want to transfer to UC-
Berkeley, where students are
unequivocally known as "Wee
nies."
You may simply want to move
into a dormitory where students
derive their titles from the name
of their residence. For example,
move into Soto, and you can call
yourself a "Soton." Opt for Man
zanita and be a "Manzanitate." Or
move into the Suites and call
yourself an "Antisocialite."
If you would like to support one
of these titles, or cast your vote for
another, please write the Bug c/o
"I Have an Identity!", PO. Box
6597, Stanford 94309.
Send those packages, peace
offerings, stale Christmas cookies
and nutcakes to the Bug! Or write
the Bug a note at b.bug@macbeth.
