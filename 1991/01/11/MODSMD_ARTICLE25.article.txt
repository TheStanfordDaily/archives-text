# Mosely condemns aristocratic education

Alfred Mosely, a pioneer in the
British educational system, spoke
here today. He concentrated mainly on
the fact that, unlike England, the
United States provides a free educa
tion to everyone from kindergarten to
high school. He condemned England's
system because "university education
is for the aristocracy, not the masses,"
and praised the U.S. system.
Mosely also took time to examine
the legal field, saying in the next 10
years, he believed that lawyers would
become "peacemakers" instead of
troublemakers, and not be out to "get
the best of the other man." He also
condemned the United States for not
yet producing a great composer, say
ing, "If you do not, it will be bad for
you."
1 wonder what Al would think of
the American university today. With
the cost of attending four years here
approaching the minimum salary of a
baseball player, it seems as if a new
aristocracy class is forming in the
United States.
Luckily, we're all part of it so we
don't have to worry, but what about

our friends and family? Soon we
won't be able to associate with them in
public, except when they give us
money for school.
Big Al was dead right on lawyers,
huh? Wouldn't you say that lawyers
today are associated with peace on
earth and good will towards men ? By
the way, did you notice that as soon as
Copland and Bernstein died, Vanilla
Ice became popular, just as Mosely
warned?

The Stanford Daily
A survey was taken of Stanford

women to determine their attitudes
toward sororities. The results showed
that almost everyone who lived in a
dorm was satisfied, as were those in
sororities. Many felt there was little
difference between Greeks and non-
Greeks.
"Sorority life is living in a house
with a bunch of women your own age.
... You study with them, play with
them, borrow their fingernail polish
and go on double dates with them; you
have a swell time," said one female.
She also commented on life in
dorms. M You go on dates and borrow
fingernail polish there, too."
/ have to admit, 1 did have a stereo
type in my mind of what a sorority
woman was like, and, I must say, it
was not exactly positive. But after
reading the description of sorority life
above, all my misconceptions were
blown away.
I had no idea that fingernail pol
ish-swapping was going on. What a
beautifully humanitarian gesture.
But, even more impressively, the same
thing is happening in dorms, as you
read this. I personally am going to go
over to my next-door neighbor's room
and borrow some aftershave lotion.
Maybe we'll even bond.
