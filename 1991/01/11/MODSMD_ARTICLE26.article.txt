# Trying to get through the flu
## 
### Ken Wharton Staff writer 
I've been suffering from the flu for
about three days now, along with a lot of
other people who got sick over break and
then decided to come back to school to
infect everybody else.
If you're one of these people, then you
know my nose is about as dense as the
bagel that's been on my shelf since Novem
ber and my throat feels as if I've been gar
gling rubber cement. Except, of course,
rubber cement tastes a whole lot better
Another symptom is that I haven't been
eating very much, due to the huge amount
of effort it would take to actually chew
food. I'd have to stop and rest in the middle
of each mouthful, and the partially chewed
food particles would form chemical bonds
with my tongue.
But despite my careful diet, I still
haven't shown any signs of recovery. People
keep telling me about these "wonder cures"
that they know, such as gargling warm salt
water or inhaling White Plaza sewer
fumes, but I think they're just testing me
to see how gullible I am.
The one cure that does sound promising,
however, is cooking myself a hot bowl of
chicken soup and injecting it directly into
my veins.
So until I get better, I'm basically lying
around, avoiding all work and making ill
ness-induced noises. Now, I realize all of
you are probably wondering, "How exactly
would you spell a phlegm rattle?" Well,

here's my best effort: "HAYYKYYAYCK
CYHT"(spit).
Actually, I think that we should have a
National Phlegm Awareness Week to rem
edy the lack of publicity that this common
household substance receives. We'd show
phlegm horror flicks ("The Phlegm that ate
New Jersey") and could even hold a faculty
debate; "Phlegm: National Crisis, or the
Solution to World Hunger?"
Sure, this is disgusting, but when you
have a cold, this is what you spend your
time thinking about.
Other flu-related topics that I've been
pondering include mucus formation, the
amount of used tissues it would take to fill
my room, and how to best kill the fool who
gave me this cold in the first place.
Some of my "friends" tried to convince
me to go to the Cowell "Free Advil" Center,
but I know they'd probably end up giving
me crutches and instructing me to super
glue my face to a White Plaza sewer grate.
But even if I did want to go to Cowell, I'd
have to get out of bed first.
I'm the kind of person who doesn't wake
up easily when I'm healthy, let alone when
my head feels as if it's been used in an
intensive game of Sumo Rugby. My room
mate's normal tactics for getting me out of
bed — such as kicking me in the face or
threatening to use the yell leaders as my
alarm clock — are no longer effective.
In fact, the only reason I haven't lapsed
into a coma is the fear that my phlegm and
the bagel will join forces and try to take
over my bed. I'll keep you posted.
