## Cardinal hoopsters manhandle hapless Huskies 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
There's an acute case of
schizophrenia running wild in the
Pacific 10 Conference, and last
night the Washington men's bas
ketball team became the latest vic
tim.
Exactly one week after a con
vincing 70-56 win against No. 4
Arizona, the Huskies came to
Maples Pavilion last night expect
ing a tight, physical, low-scoring
battle with the Cardinal. After
proving they could beat just about
anyone, Washington looked like
another tough test for Stanford,
which lost twice last week in Ore
gon.
Whoops.
Someone apparently forgot to
tell Stanford that the game was
supposed to be tight, because the
Cardinal shook, rattled and rolled
over the hapless Huskies 87-55 in
a game that was close for almost a
whole four minutes. In front of a
rowdy crowd of 5,485, the Cardi
nal flew to a 28-8 lead 10 minutes
into the game, upped the damage
to 48-20 at the half and got the
lead up to 40 at one point. The
Huskies made only nine of their
25 first-half shots, while the Stan
ford was on fire on both ends of
the court.
"Needless to say, that's a
relief," said Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery, whose team
improved to 8-5,1-2 in the Pac-10.
"Coming in against a team that
we considered to be pretty good,
we were a little worried.
"That was probably the best
half of basketball we've played
this year," Montgomery added.
"We were aggressive defensively
and did a great job moving the ball
offensively. We moved the ball bet
ter than we had all year."
"There's not much to say," said
Washington coach Lynn Nance,
whose Huskies are now 9-3, 1-2.
"Stanford just played a great
game.... I've never been through
this before as a coach, but that can
happen in this league. We didn't
come in unprepared, we were just
stunned early."

tie stunned as well. "There's no
way anybody on either team
expected a win as big as this," said
Stanford center Adam Keefe, who
had 26 points (twenty-two in the
first half) and 10 rebounds. "We
played so well at the start they got
off-track, and then things just
crumbled. They're not that bad,
obviously."
Washington was so off-track
the final 32-point victory margin
was the best ever for Stanford
against the Huskies (surpassing a
97-75 win in 1968). And it would
have been much, much worse if
Montgomery hadn't pulled all his
starters for good with 12 minutes
left in the game.
"I don't know if we can play a
whole lot better," Montgomery
said. "You can make every shot, I
guess." Stanford came close in the
first half: Keefe made eight of his
10 shots (including a sweet fast
break no-look reverse thunder
dunk, thanks to a fantastic Mar
cus Lollie pass — "It just kind of
happened," Keefe said), Andrew
Vlahov made all four of his, and

Adam Keefe takes Todd Lautenbach to school for two of his 26
points In last night's thrashing of Washington. Keefe had 22 points
and seven rebounds at halftime and the Cardinal coasted to an
87-55 win.
