The Cardinal men's basketball
team spelled relief "H-U-S-K-I-E-S"
last night in Maples Pavilion as
the frustration of two close losses
on the road ended with a 32-point
destruction of Washington.
"Needless to say that's a
relief," Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery said after the game.
"The first half was probably the
best half of basketball we've
played this year."
During practices this week, the
Cardinal methodically and work
horse-like ground through the
things that it had to correct. As
forward Deshon Wingate said the
teams goal was, "just to work
hard."
"It was 'We gotta have this one
coming up,'" Wingate said. "It
was a no-nonsense feeling like:
'We have to win.'"
"(Practice) was really kind of a
forced march . . . boot camp,"
Montgomery said.
Starting power forward
Andrew Vlahov sat out of prac
tices this week, nursing a sore
ankle. The rest of the veterans
pulled together and took up the
burden of leadership, center
Adam Keefe said.
"There's no question that some
of our key veteran players were
fired up," Montgomery said.
For the players, coming off the
losses to Oregon State and Oregon
was difficult because they didn't
feel that they had played all that
badly. They just wanted to play
again.
"For me personally, it was just
being able to play," Keefe said. "I
was so bitter after the Oregon
game.... I was sick of people talk
ing about it. We played fine, we
just didn't finish the games."
Wingate agreed, saying that
the team was eager to get back on
the court and win a game.
"I was very anxious to play and
to win," Wingate said. "I had a
stone face at halftime just because

'The first half was
probably the best half
of basketball we've
played this year.'

I wanted to finish the game. It's a
big relief to me and to the team."
Washington coach Lynn Nance
praised the ability of Stanford to
rebound from a loss, citing the
team's experience as a determin
ing factor.
"Stanford responded like four
seniors and an experienced junior
would," Nance said. "They came
back from a game they should
have won at Oregon."
Montgomery gave credit to his
starters, the veterans who he said
"have always been pretty good at
bouncing back."
"Going through a number of
years in this league, you try to
come out the next night and just
play," Wingate said. "You can't
think about the past. We're defi
nitely good at rebounding [from a
loss]"
The players have the impres
sion that the team will still live up
to the preseason predictions of
around a third-place finish in the
final Pacific 10 Conference stand
ings.
"I think that we're pretty
good," Keefe commented. "I still
think we have the capability to
finish high in the conference.
Even though we played that well,
we can play better."
Overall, team confidence is
high after the blow out.
"Rebounding picks you up a
little bit," Wingate said. "If we
would have lost, it would have
been ugly."
Montgomery described the
game as a "much needed win," but
expressed the need to keep sharp
for the rest of the season. The Pac
-10 is a tough conference, and you
have to expect a close game every
night.
