# Senate votes to enact major bylaw reforms
## 
### David Bianco Editorial staff 
The ASSU closed the final chapter of last
spring's election controversy at its meeting
last night, as it unanimously enacted
dozens of bylaw reforms on elections and
other issues.
"It vindicates the ruling I made last
spring," said former ASSU Elections Com
missioner Steve Krauss, who had ruled that
write-in votes for fictitious slates would not
be counted in the election for the Council of
Presidents. His ruling precluded a runoff
election between the victorious Four Our
Future slate and the defeated A Clean
Slate, prompting a recall election that
nearly succeeded in removing the present
COP
"I think the thing that I'm happiest
about is the change with respect to count
ing COP write-in votes, because that's what
caused the conflict last year," Krauss said.

The new bylaws instruct the elections com
missioner to count "only write-in votes
attributable to a single, write-in candidate
or slate" or a "vote that consists of the
names of four members of the Association."
That provision, and others prohibiting
campaign material in the Quad; requiring
random rotation of names of slates, candi
dates, special fee requests and other ballot
measures on each ASSU ballot; and remov
ing the business projects from COP control
emerged from a multipartisan constitu
tion/bylaw reform task force that was open
to all students.
COP member Ingrid Nava, who ran on
the disputed slate, applauded the senate's
vote. "It's a needed clarification, and I'm
glad that it has been made," she said.
The senate also agreed to postpone grad
uate senator John Overdeck's bill which
would limit the scope of senate action to
University-related issues. The
bill, which was in response to a
Nov. 14 bill opposing an unpro
voked, non-U.N.-sponsored mili
tary offensive in the Persian Gulf,
will be debated at the next senate
meeting Jan. 24.
The bill was discussed inter
mittently last night, however, as
senators commented on it indi
rectly during other senate busi
ness. The bill was also discussed
explicitly during the senate's
open forum, during which four
students registered their opposi
tion to the bill.
One of those students was
senior Julie Vanneman, chair of
the Pro-Choice Alliance. Vanne
man reminded the senate that
more than 70 percent of voters in
last spring's election favored an

initiative to put the ASSU on
record supporting reproductive
choice.
She urged the senate to con
tinue to speak out on issues such
as abortion that are not specifi
cally Stanford-related but still
affect students, adding that sev
eral students each year have to
make abortion-related decisions.
Senator David Brown, a senior,
asked Vanneman if she thought
the ASSU had lived up to last
year's resolutions and requested
specific suggestions on how to act
as "a pro-choice ASSU." Vanne
man said she planned to come
back to the Jan. 24 meeting with
a list of suggestions.
Also during the meeting, rep
resentatives from the United
States Student Association, who
are in the Bay Area for their
board meeting, spoke about their
organization, of which the ASSU
is a member. Tajel Shah, a senior

at Rutgers University who is vice
president of that organization,
said several other schools had
passed Persian Gulf bills similar
to the Nov. 14 ASSU bill.
In other business, the senate
heard a report from Nominations
Commissioner Valerie Mih, who
discussed the process for nomi
nating students to University
committees.
Bob Hamrdla, assistant to Uni
versity President Donald
Kennedy, praised the work Mih
has done in organizing the Nomi
nations Commissions and sug
gested ways in which the Univer
sity and the ASSU can work
together to effectively appoint
students to committees.
