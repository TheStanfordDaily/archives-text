# Cagers go north to battle arch-rival Washington, WSU
## 
### David Hirning Senior staff writer 
The women's basketball pro
grams at Stanford and Washing
ton have many similarities. Both
are successful, both run clean pro
grams, and both have a large
regional following. But there is
one significant difference:
•The Huskies get mad. The Car
dinal get even.
Last year, a 40-point shellack

ing in Maples Pavilion made
Washington and coach Chris Gob
recht mad. So mad that Gobrecht
admitted afterward that her team
had gotten caught up in "hating
Stanford," a remark which caused
a minor furor. A few weeks later,
the Huskies played inspired bas
ketball and knocked off the Cardi
nal 81-78 on ESPN.
Tonight in Seattle, in the
renewal of a rivalry that is start
ing to approach Stanford-Califor

nia in magnitude, the No. 9 Cardi
nal (8-3) will attempt to get even.
Indeed, a win tonight against the
10-1, 13th-ranked Huskies would
even up the overall series between
the two teams at six-all. It would
also do a lot towards guaranteeing
Stanford a Pacific 10 Conference
title and a possible undefeated
conference season.
If the Cardinal does win the
conference, it would tie the
Huskies for most Pac-10 titles,
with three. For at least the past
three seasons, Stanford and
Washington are the Pac-10.
The Huskies were the only
team to beat Stanford last season.
The Cardinal won 12 straight fol
lowing that loss, and took the
NCAA title with a 32-1 mark. But
both teams ended up 17-1 in the
conference and thus shared the
Pac-10 title.
To remind them of this, Wash
ington reportedly sent the Cardi
nal team shirts at the end of last
year. The logo was simple: "32-1"
with emphasis on the one.
Although this year's game is
not on television and both teams
have lost key starters, it promises
to be just as tough a dogfight.
Washington anticipates a sellout,
and the Husky crowd is, well, very
vocal.
"It's a special rivalry," Stanford
coach Tara VanDerveer said.
"They'll have a big crowd up
there."
Stanford has only beaten the
Huskies once in five tries in Seat
tle. That four-point victory two
years ago paved the way for the
Cardinal's 18-0 conference sea
son, the first in the history of the
Pac-10.
That team, however, failed to
win it all in March, as last year's
team did. The loss to the Huskies
last year may have been a catalyst
for that championship season.
"When we lost, our whole team
was disappointed," VanDerveer
said. "We realized that we had to
play well (every game), that we
were vulnerable."
This year, a win would loom
large in either program's season,
while a loss could be devastating
in the Pac-10 race. The Huskies
are 10-1, but a lackluster schedule
is highlighted only by a wire-to
wire win over then-No. 13 lowa, a
team that has now lost 4 games.
Stanford has more losses, but
its schedule could rightfully be
called the toughest in the nation.
The Cardinal have played five
teams in the top 20 (winning
three) and four in the top ten
(winning two). Stanford beat

'It's a special rival
ry. They'll have a
big crowd up
there.'

then-undefeated and No. 3-
ranked Georgia in the finals of the
Cardinal Classic Dec. 22.
VanDerveer approaches the
Washington game as just one in a
series of conference games in the
rapidly improving Pac-10. Stan
ford's program, like its schedule,
in national in scope.
The Huskies, and controversial
coach Chris Gobrecht, approach
the rivalry differently. A very emo
tional, intense individual, Gob
recht is highly respected in the
coaching fraternity and is known
for getting a lot out of her players.
But ever since Stanford went
undefeated in the Pac-10, wrest
ing the conference title from
Washington, Gobrecht and the
Huskies seem almost to have nar
rowed the schedule down to a one
game season: Beat Stanford.
Tonight, they get their chance.
Also tonight, the Cardinal have
the chance to get even.
Card notes
For her prolific efforts with the
roundball against the Oregon schools
last weekend, Julie Zeilstra was
named the Sports Illustrated women's
college basketball Player of the Week.
The forward scored 60 points in two
Stanford wins, setting a new personal
high, and averaged 9.5 rebounds in
the games.
Continuing in the Honors Depart
ment, Cardinal guard Sonja Henning
was named Pac-10 Player of the Week
last week for the fourth time in her
career. The senior had 26 points
against Oregon State Jan. 3, and had
10 points and 10 assists versus Ore

10 points and 10 assists versus Ore
gon on Jan. 5.


Julie Zellstra scored 60 points and tallied 19 rebounds in two
games last week to earn Sports Illustrated Player-of-the-Week
honors. She and her teammates will face their sternest Pac-10 test
to date in Seattle tonight.
The women's basketball pro
grams at Stanford and Washing
ton have many similarities. Both
are successful, both run clean pro
grams, and both have a large
regional following. But there is
one significant difference:
•The Huskies get mad. The Car
dinal get even.
Last year, a 40-point shellack

ing in Maples Pavilion made
Washington and coach Chris Gob
recht mad. So mad that Gobrecht
admitted afterward that her team
had gotten caught up in "hating
Stanford," a remark which caused
a minor furor. A few weeks later,
the Huskies played inspired bas
ketball and knocked off the Cardi
nal 81-78 on ESPN.
Tonight in Seattle, in the
renewal of a rivalry that is start
ing to approach Stanford-Califor

nia in magnitude, the No. 9 Cardi
nal (8-3) will attempt to get even.
Indeed, a win tonight against the
10-1, 13th-ranked Huskies would
even up the overall series between
the two teams at six-all. It would
also do a lot towards guaranteeing
Stanford a Pacific 10 Conference
title and a possible undefeated
conference season.
If the Cardinal does win the
conference, it would tie the
Huskies for most Pac-10 titles,
with three. For at least the past
three seasons, Stanford and
Washington are the Pac-10.
The Huskies were the only
team to beat Stanford last season.
The Cardinal won 12 straight fol
lowing that loss, and took the
NCAA title with a 32-1 mark. But
both teams ended up 17-1 in the
conference and thus shared the
Pac-10 title.
To remind them of this, Wash
ington reportedly sent the Cardi
nal team shirts at the end of last
year. The logo was simple: "32-1"
with emphasis on the one.
Although this year's game is
not on television and both teams
have lost key starters, it promises
to be just as tough a dogfight.
Washington anticipates a sellout,
and the Husky crowd is, well, very
vocal.
"It's a special rivalry," Stanford
coach Tara VanDerveer said.
"They'll have a big crowd up
there."
Stanford has only beaten the
Huskies once in five tries in Seat
tle. That four-point victory two
years ago paved the way for the
Cardinal's 18-0 conference sea
son, the first in the history of the
Pac-10.
That team, however, failed to
win it all in March, as last year's
team did. The loss to the Huskies
last year may have been a catalyst
for that championship season.
"When we lost, our whole team
was disappointed," VanDerveer
said. "We realized that we had to
play well (every game), that we
were vulnerable."
This year, a win would loom
large in either program's season,
while a loss could be devastating
in the Pac-10 race. The Huskies
are 10-1, but a lackluster schedule
is highlighted only by a wire-to
wire win over then-No. 13 lowa, a
team that has now lost 4 games.
Stanford has more losses, but
its schedule could rightfully be
called the toughest in the nation.
The Cardinal have played five
teams in the top 20 (winning
three) and four in the top ten
(winning two). Stanford beat

'It's a special rival
ry. They'll have a
big crowd up
there.'

then-undefeated and No. 3-
ranked Georgia in the finals of the
Cardinal Classic Dec. 22.
VanDerveer approaches the
Washington game as just one in a
series of conference games in the
rapidly improving Pac-10. Stan
ford's program, like its schedule,
in national in scope.
The Huskies, and controversial
coach Chris Gobrecht, approach
the rivalry differently. A very emo
tional, intense individual, Gob
recht is highly respected in the
coaching fraternity and is known
for getting a lot out of her players.
But ever since Stanford went
undefeated in the Pac-10, wrest
ing the conference title from
Washington, Gobrecht and the
Huskies seem almost to have nar
rowed the schedule down to a one
game season: Beat Stanford.
Tonight, they get their chance.
Also tonight, the Cardinal have
the chance to get even.
