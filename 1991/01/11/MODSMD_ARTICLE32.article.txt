# She works for the other side now

### David Hirning Senior staff writer 
The Cardinal women's team
that won the NCAA title last
year said goodbye to three
seniors when it was all over.
Player of the Year Jennifer
Azzi, after a delay, went off to
wow the Italians in a pro
league. Katy Steding signed a
contract to play in Japan before
injuring her knee.
Whatever happened to Stacy
Parson?
Not to worry. Parson is alive
and well, and in fact will be pre
sent tonight when the Cardinal
take on conference rival Wash
ington in an important Pacific
10 Conference showdown (see
accompanying article). But the
Stanford fans might be sur
prised to find her there — on
the opposing bench.
Parson, like former Stan
ford guard Charli Turner
before her, is serving a two
year stint as a graduate assis
tant in Seattle for the Huskies
and Coach Chris Gobrecht.
Apparently, the same woman
who once said that she "hated"
Stanford has no problems with
drafting Cardinal players over
to her side when they hang up
the sneakers.
Although admitting that it
is slightly odd and that the
Huskies aren't above giving
the resident Cardinal-turned-
a little teas
ing, Parson is enjoying her time
in Seattle so far. She is actually
there to pick up a master's in
business administration spe
cializing in human resources,
and basketball is sort of a
means to an end.
"I'm not interested in coach
ing just for the sake of coach
ing," Paroon said in a phone
interview from Seattle. "I'm
really interested in human
resources and organizational
behavior as it relates to produc
tivity, and a lot of what goes on
in team sports goes on in the
workplace It's a warmup
to working on my interper
sonal skills."
But Parson, a psychology
mcyor on the Farm, isn't just
using the Huskies as an alter
native laboratory. She works
with the guards and the wings,
and her office duties include

helping with recruiting, video
tape exchange, and summer
camp preparation.
"It's kind of hard going to
school and being at the office —
kind of similar to playing," Par
son said. "It's a little different
because in addition to the prac
tices I have to spend two hours
a day in the office."

Gobrecht re
cruited Parson
out of high
school, and Wash
ington was actu
ally her third
choice, behind
Stanford and
Colorado. This
gave Parson a
chance to get to

know Gobrecht before some of
the recent controversy between
the two programs, and she has
nothing but praise for the coach.
"A lot of people think of her
as this evil woman, but I find
her very easy to work with,"
Parson said. "Most good
coaches are intense."
Parson doesn't see the
sometimes volatile rivalry
between the two schools as a
factor in her job. "The transi
tion has been easier than I
thought it was going to be," she
said. "I thought the seniors
would be the toughest to gain
respect from, but they (actu
ally) made the transition eas
• _ M
ier.
Graduate assistant is a
rather invisible job, but Parson
excels at it, much as she
excelled as an off-the-court
leader at Stanford. Despite
rarely starting in her four
years, her college coach saw
Parson as an important key to
Stanford's success.
"Stacy was really the
unsung hero of our champi
onship team," Stanford Coach
Tara VanDerveer. "She's very
unselfish and is able to give up
a lot of things for the good of
the team."
The question remains, how
ever: where will Parson's loyal
ties lie in tonight's showdown.
"I have a loyalty to these
guys (Washington), and I want
to see them win," she said, "but
I also have a lot of friends on
the Stanford side. I win either
way, but I lose too."
