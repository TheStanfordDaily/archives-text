## 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
For the second consecutive
night, the battered Stanford
wrestling team was overwhelmed
by a strong Pacific 10 Conference
opponent.

On Wednesday night, the Car
dinal was crushed by the Oregon
Ducks by a score of 40-3. Last
night, with six starters out for the
second straight match, Stanford
lost to a strong Oregon State
team, 36-2.
In the opening 118-pound

event, sophomore Phil Nowick
was dominated by his aggressive
Beaver opponent, losing by a final
score of 14-6. Nowick (1-3 in dual
meets, 5-8 overall), on the defen
sive from the start, was hampered
by eye pokes in the second and
third periods.

At 126, Stanford freshman Jay
Jackson, wrestling against Babak
Mohammadi, OSU's most suc
cessful grappler at 18-3, managed
to stay close for much of the first
two periods. Tiring in the third,
Jackson (1-3, 6-7) lost by a final
tally of 13-7.
Jesse Lindow started slowly for
the Cardinal in the 134-pound
bout. Bob Henry of Oregon State
led by almost two minutes in rid
ing time by the end of the first
period. Lindow (0-2, 1-3), nor
mally a 126-pounder, fought back
in the third period, but lost, 13-0.
Senior James Dinette scored
Stanford's first takedown of the
night at 0:56 of the first period of
the 142-pound match. However,
Beaver Neil Russo used quickness
to keep Dinette (2-2, 9-8) on one
foot for most of the night, edging
him out by a score of 7-4.
In the 150-pound bout, junior
Dave Sacks was unable to over
come two first period takedowns,
losing 7-5. Sacks (2-2, 6-7) came
close with a near takedown at the
end of period three, but was
unable to pick up advantage
points before the final whistle.
Bob Becker looked impressive
for the second consecutive night.
The sophomore, once again start
ing for injured junior Matt
Topham, scored Stanford's only
points on the night in battling to a
3-3 draw at 158. Becker (0-1-1, 0-
4-1), called by head coach Chris
Horpel "the outstanding [Stan
ford] wrestler of the meet," came
within an eyelash of his first vic
tory, giving up a takedown with 12

Without All-American Steve
Buddie available for the 167-
pound match, Stanford sopho
more Greg Green was placed in
last night's lineup. Green (0-1, 0-
3), normally a 158-pounder, was
outmanned, losing by a technical
fall, 21-6.
An ailing Steve Yarbrough
fought gamely at 177 before losing
by a final of 4-2. Yarbrough (3-1,
17-3), a senior tri-captain, was
definitely not at full strength,
hampered by illness.
Chris Carlsten finished up for
the Cardinal with a 6-1 loss in the
190-pound event. Carlsten (0-3, 2-
5), wrestled 13 pounds over his
normal weight for the second con
secutive night.
Stanford, still searching for a
heavyweight, forfeited the class to
close the night.
Horpel summed up the state of
the team. "I'm just really discour
aged. At this point, I really don't
know what's going to happen with
us." Oregon State improved its
record to 5-0 in dual meets, while
the Cardinal dropped to 1-3 on the
year.
