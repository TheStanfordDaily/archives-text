# Women host No. 6 Michigan
## Second-ranked Card swimmers open home schedule 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
When the Stanford women's
swim team hits the water in its
home opener tomorrow, the squad
will be without its head coach, last
year's NCAA Swimmer of the
Year, and the brightest new star in
American swimming.
And the Cardinal is still a
heavy favorite to defeat Michigan,
the No. 6 team in the nation. But
that's nothing out of the ordinary
for a Cardinal squad that has not
been seriously tested in a dual
meet in two years.
After posting a not-as-close-as
the-score-indicated 85-40 victory
at UC-Santa Barbara last week
end, the Cardinal will be at home
for one of only three times this
year. The meet begins at high
noon tomorrow at deGuerre Pool.
Stanford, ranked second
nationally behind Texas, will be
short-handed for the second week
in a row as coach Richard Quick,
sophomore Janet Evans and
freshman Summer Sanders are
competing at the World Champi
onships in Perth, Australia. But
the team still should have more
than enough firepower to battle
the Wolverines.
"We only have two home meet
weekends so I think the team will
be excited to swim in our own
pool," assistant coach Mike Chas
son said. "We're coming off a lot of
hard training. We swam off events

at Santa Barbara last week so this
will be our first time swimming
our best events."
Leading the way for Stanford
last weekend was freshman Pam
Minthorn, who was one of the few
Cardinal competitors to swim
some of her best events. She won
the 200-yard butterfly and the
400 individual medley against the
Gauchos. Her time in the 200 but
terfly last week would have placed
her fifth at last year's NCAA
meet. "Pam Minthorn swam an
awesome time in the 200 fly,"
Chasson said.
"I was really happy with [the
time]," Minthorn said. "I didn't
know what to expect going into
the meet."
Unfortunately for her, she has
been feeling under the weather
this week and doesn't know if
she'll be at full strength tomor
row. But she is taking the setback
in stride and is optimistic for the
remainder of the season. "Overall
this season I think I've trained
better than I have before," she
said. "I'm really happy with the
way it's going, until this week that
is."
Stanford will be especially
strong in the butterfly, even
though Sanders, ranked No. 1 in
the world in the 200-meter butter
fly, is in Australia. In addition to
Minthorn, sophomore Janel Jor
gensen is the defending NCAA
champ in both the 100 and 200
butterflies, senior Michelle

Griglione was the NCAA runner
up in the 200 in 1989 and senior
Suzy Buckovich is a three-time
All-American in the 100 butterfly.
In addition to Minthorn,
Griglione (100 backstroke and 100
freestyle) and freshman Sionainn
Marcoux (500 and 1000
freestyles) won twice at UCSB.
Susan Johnson, Karen Kraemer,
Jody Smith, Dede Trimble and
Buckovich also posted victories
for the Cardinal.
Michigan, which placed sev
enth at NCAAs last year, suffered
some big graduation losses last
year. Their top returnees are
sprinters Kathy Deibler and Jen
nifer Love, butterflier Mindy
Gehrs and distance freestyler
Katherine Creighton. All earned
All-America honors at the NCAA
meet last March.
Stanford is coming off an
exhausting period of training so
the swimmers will not be at their
sharpest, but will likely turn in
several good performances.
"Christmas training went
really well," Cardinal co-captain
Jody Smith said. "The team is
closer together than it has ever
been. Now it's time to turn our
good training into good swim
ming. This will be a good tost."
Card notes
In results from this morning's
(yes, this morning's!) qualifying in
Perth, Evans posted the fastest time
in the 800-meter freestyle.
