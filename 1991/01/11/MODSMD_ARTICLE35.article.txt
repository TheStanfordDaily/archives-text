# Men face huge meet in Texas
## 
### Amy Wusterbarth Staff writer 
Over break many Stanford
students were at home sleeping
in and watching MTV But for
almost two weeks the No. 3-
ranked men's swimming team
stayed on campus to work out
for hours every day. This week
end will show the results of
their efforts when the team
travels to No. 1-ranked Texas
for the first dual meet of the
season.
"We're fired up," said sopho
more Erik Maurer. "This is the
first real meet of the year so
we're pretty excited."
The days of intense winter
workout should help the team.
"Aerobically, we'll never be in
better condition," said fresh
man Tyler Mayfield.
Senior tri-captain Matt
Rodgers noted that the team
"may be a little tired but so will
Texas — everyone is at the same
point in training."
The Cardinal squad will also
be affected by the absence of
powerhouse swimmers Jeff
Rouse and Eddie Parenti who
are at the World Championships
in Australia.
Texas, however, is also miss
ing their strongest swimmer,
sprinter Shaun Jordan. Stan
ford assistant coach Ted Knapp
said, "Having their freestyler
gone is equal to Eddie and Jeff

being gone because of the events
that each man swims."
The Cardinal only has 17
swimmers going to Austin, six
of whom are freshman. "I think
the freshmen are going to do
well," said Knapp, "We have a
more talented and more experi
enced freshman class than
Texas."
"They have great team cam
raderie with the upperclassmen
so there should be no problems
with this being their first dual
meet," said Knapp.
The freshmen are all very
accomplished and should put
many points on the board this
weekend. Derek Weatherford
has times which already put
him among the top four return
ing Stanford swimmers in six
events.
Mayfield's incoming time in
the 100-yard breaststroke
would have been second all-time
in Cardinal history. "Speaking
for the freshmen, this meet will
be different because it is one on
one, every point counts," said
Mayfield.
Junior Alex Kostich should
also be a key performer for the
Stanford squad. He swims
freestyle and the individual
medley.
"If we get big swims from
Derek, Tyler and Alex and also
win both relays we can win this
meet," said Knapp, "Everyone

needs to do well, every point
counts.
"We are going into this with
confidence and good training.
We want as many seasonal best
times as possible and also better
times than we had last year at
this point in the season. We can
lose to Texas and still have
swum well and be confident that
we'll be tough competition at
the end of the season."
Mayfield, a breaststroker,
said, "Hopefully we can sweep
the breaststroke and also try to
get closer to NCAA qualifying
times."
Texas also has an NCAA
finalist diver who should add
points for the Longhorns.
"These are two great teams
with a great rivalry," said sopho
more swimmer Chas Morton,
"With the big guns at Worlds
things are pretty even on both
sides."
This is the first of many chal
lenging meets for the Cardinal
this season. Stanford will have
dual meets against seven other
top-10 squads. They will have
more top-10 dual meets than
any other school in the nation.
The Cardinal has won the
Pacific 10 Conference for the
past nine years. A big win over
Texas this weekend could set
them in the right direction for a
record 10th year conference vic
tory.
