### Minal Hajratwala Staff writer 
A Board of Trustees committee has
been formed to review concerns over
Stanford's landmark domestic partners
policy and will report its findings next
month, according to Director of Graduate
Residences Jean Kim.
The board appointed a six-member
committee after its December meeting to
review Stanford housing policies, includ
ing a three-month-old policy that allows

unmarried heterosexual, gay and lesbian
couples to live in.marital housing.
The committee has until Feb. 11 to
complete its report, according to Bob
Hamrdla, assistant to the president. "The
impetus (for forming the committee) was
clearly domestic partners," Hamrdla said.
The board has received numerous let
ters from alumni and students criticizing
the policy, according to Kim, who esti
mated that 60 percent of Escondido Vil
lage residents favor the policy and 40 per
cent do not.

The committee will "take a look and
see what the appropriate response is" to
student and alumni concerns, she said.
Some married students have expressed
concern that allowing unmarried couples
to live in couples housing will result in a
housing shortage.
Kim said it is unlikely that couples'
housing will become scarce, but added
that "we will not know for sure until the
spring housing lottery" in May.
Others said homosexuality was against
their religion and that they did not wish

to live in the same neighborhood as gay
and lesbian couples.
Some residents with children
expressed concern at three open forums
held at the end of last quarter that prox
imity to gay and lesbian couples would be
detrimental to their children.
"We are trying to develop programs to
address issues in parenting, such as how
to explain [domestic partners! to chil
dren," Kim said. "We realized there is a
broader need for student families to learn

parenting skills on this and other issues."
Workshops on parenting and conflict
resolution programs will be held in
Escondido Village this quarter and early
spring quarter, according to Kim.
The trustees' committee will explore
other possible responses to alumni and
student concerns, Kim said.
The committee was formed at the
December Board of Trustees meeting and
has not yet met, according to Trustee
John Freidenrich, committee vice-chair.
