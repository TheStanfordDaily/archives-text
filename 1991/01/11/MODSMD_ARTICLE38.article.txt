### Howard Libit Staff writer 
Stanford police took a man into cus
tody for psychiatric evaluation Tuesday
morning in front of Wilbur Hall after he
allegedly caused a disturbance.
The man, 35, lives on campus, but
police would only say he is neither a stu
dent nor a faculty member.
He is being held for a 72-hour psychi
atric evaluation at Valley Medical Center
under the Welfare and Institutions Act,

according to Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer.
"The man started flipping out due to
personal problems, apparently over a
failing business," Niemeyer said.
The man locked himself in his bath
room at home and jumped out the win
dow when his family tried to talk to him.
He then went to Wilbur, where he
grabbed a female student food service
worker, Niemeyer said.
"He really scared a lot of people (at
Wilbur)," Niemeyer added.
