### Cecilia Tom Editorial staff 
The future of student telephone ser
vices at Stanford may be decided once
and for all by a Public Utilities Commis
sion hearing starting next Wednesday.
Marybeth Rice, a graduate student, is
joining forces with graduate students
Michael Murray, William Behram and
Gerald LeTendre in contending that
Stanford should not have a monopoly of
phone service on campus, after a similar
attempt of the three students failed this
summer.
The commission granted the rehear
ing on Nov. 9, when it decided that the
students' appeal to the summer hearing

merits consideration. The commission
initially ruled that Stanford is not a
"shared tenant service" provider, and
therefore does not have to allow compe
tition on campus.
According to a 1987 commission deci
sion, a landlord is a shared tenant ser
vice provider when tenants pay for tele
phone service for commercial use.
This definition does not directly
address the issue of residential phone
service at universities.
Rice complained to the commission
on Dec. 6 that Pacific Bell is "unlawfully
violating its obligation to the public" by
not providing phone service to her
apartment in Escondido Village, and
said the University system is

"immoral."
Rice is now represented by third-year
law student Jotham Stein, who is also
representing Murray's group.
In addition, the commission will also
consider the status of the transaction
between Pacific Bell and Stanford. The
phone company has sold its cables to the
University, but because it did not file an
application in accordance with the Pub
lic Utilities Code, the commission
declared the sale void.
Stein said a prehearing conference
will be held on Wednesday, when all par
ties and the commission judge will
determine the procedure of the hearing
and whether further evidentiary hear
ings are necessary.
