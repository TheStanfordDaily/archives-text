A Centennial Culture Fest initiated by
the Council of Presidents is in the works for
spring quarter. If approved by the Centen
nial Year Office, the event will take place in
the Quad during "Pro Fro" Week.
COP member Jamie Green said the festi
val, scheduled for April 21, will be "a way
for all students to get involved in the Cen
tennial Celebration."
The event will be "a celebration in diver
sity," Green said, with an informal and pic
nic-like atmosphere. Musical performances,
dance and poetry will be performed and
food booths representing different cultures
will be set up in the Inner Quad.
Various campus communities, including
dormitories, ethnic centers and academic
departments, will be asked to participate.
Many theme houses, such as Ujamaa,
Okada, Haus Mitteleuropa and La Maison
Francaise will be asked to join the event.
Green stressed that the Culture Fest is
not a replacement for "The Fire Within," a
cultural event that has been organized by
the four main student of color organiza
tions in past years but may or may not
occur this year.
The Council of Presidents came up with

the idea of the Culture Fest at the end of
fall quarter. It has not been officially
endorsed as part of the Centennial Celebra
tion yet, but according to Green, the Cen
tennial organizers "seemed enthusiastic."
Stephen Peeps, director of the Centen
nial Year Office and associate vice president
of public affairs, was not available for com
ment.
No Centennial event so far has brought
all components of the University together
simultaneously, according to COP member
Goodwin Liu.
"The Centennial Celebration has been
going on for four years, yet some students
have not found a way to be part of it," Liu
said. "This celebration will be unique
because it will be put together by the stu
dents, for the students.... It will be a
chance for them to show their stuff."
The Culture Fest would take place dur
ing Prospective Freshman week to "give
Pro Fros a look at one of the aspects of
Stanford," Liu said.
The COP is also looking for more organi
zations and dorms that are interested in
participating. "The more support the pro
posal has," Liu said, "the more likely it will
be endorsed."
