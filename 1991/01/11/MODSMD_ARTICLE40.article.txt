# To bunt or not to bunt
## Math course looks at the sport of statistics 
### Sonya Martinez 
Have you ever wondered what are
the precise odds of a football team with
a half-time lead going on to win the
game? What is the relationship
between body weight and the ability to
lift weights? How quickly are the
records of sports teams improving?
If so, the Mathematical and Compu
tational Science department has cre
ated an innovative new course just for
you this quarter, "Mathematics of
Sports." The new class will be taught
jointly by Statistics Prof. Thomas
Cover and Mathematics Prof. Joseph
Keller and will focus on the mathemat
ical analysis of various sports ques
tions.
According to the course description,
"Mathematics in Sports" seeks "a
mathematical analysis of the physical
and biological aspects of human per
formance." In practice, this means
exploring a wide variety of questions,
which include strategy, probability and

biology.
Among the questions explored by
the course are the following: In base
ball, is bunting a good idea or a bad
one? What is the effect of being right
handed or left-handed in baseball?
How do variations in technique and
equipment affect performance?
As an example, Keller explained
that the class will look at data on the
success rates of bunting under various
conditions in the past and will find
that under some conditions, bunting is
more favorable than "playing it
straight," while under others, bunting
is a disadvantage.
The class will also look at problems
such as the effect of air resistance on
flying disks and of the shifting of gears
in bike racing. It will examine tradi
tional sports statistics and the develop
ment of new statistics, and it will cover
game theory, a field which applies
mathematics to the problem of creat
ing optimal strategies in sports.
According to Mathematics Prof.

This may be the first
class in the nation to
analyze athletic per
formance through
mathematics.

Bradley Efron, chair of the Mathemat
ical and Computational Science pro
gram, this may be the first such class
in the nation, and"I can guarantee
you it's the best, because these guys
are the best."
According to Efron, the two profes
sors are among the most distinguished
applied mathematicians in the coun
try. Both teach in the Mathematical
and Computational Science program,
in addition to their own departments.
They also both happen to be inter
ested in sports, and as a result, they

are naturally interested in applying
mathematics to the kinds of questions
which come up in sports. "I wish I
were a better performer, but maybe I
can make up for it by figuring out what
to do, if I can't [play sports]," Keller
said.
"Mathematics of Sports" was
designed primarily to give Mathemati
cal and Computational Science majors
an elective which would prove to be
more fun than most of their other
required classes, according to Efron.
However, all interested students are
encouraged to take the class.
The course utilizes two textbooks,
and lectures will draw largely on other
reference books. Mathematics 43 is a
prerequisite for the class, and Statis
tics 116 is a co-requisite.
The course, cross-listed as Mathe
matics 100 or as Mathematical and
Computational Science 100, meets on
Tuesdays and Thursdays from 2:45 to
4:00 in Building 380 and is offered for
three units.
