Harvard University President
Derek Bok will return to Stanford
next September, 40 years after his
graduation from the Farm.
Bok will be a fellow at the Cen
ter for Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences, an indepen
dent research facility nestled in
the foothills near the Stanford
Golf Course.
Philip Converse, director of the
center started by the Ford Foun
dation in 1952, said he was
"delighted" to have Bok.
Bok became eligible for a one
year fellowship and received his
invitation nearly 20 years ago, so
Converse said, "I'm sure that
didn't affect the timing of his
stopping."
Prospective fellows often need
some time to "spring themselves
loose from wherever they are," he
added.
The center sponsors 48 fellows
per year, drawn mostly from uni
versities. Bok is not the only uni
versity president to be a fellow of
the center, but others have usu
ally been fellows before being pro
moted to presidents, Converse
said.
Last spring Bok, at age 60,
announced his plans to step down
from what the New York Times
called "perhaps the most presti
gious post in American higher
education." Harvard has not yet
appointed Bok's replacement.
Bok cited the need for a presi

dent who could lead Harvard's
fledgling $2 billion fund-raising
drive over the next few years and
his own lengthy tenure as reasons
for his resignation. "I've always
thought 20 years was a good
round number," he told the New
York Times.
After obtaining a bachelor's
degree in political science from
Stanford and graduate degrees
from Harvard and George Wash
ington Universities, Bok taught
and served as dean of Harvard's
Law School. He was appointed
president in 1971.
"He's been extraordinary â€”
what a wonderful tour Derek
had," University President Don
ald Kennedy told the New York
Times.
One of the longest-serving
presidents of any American uni
versity, Bok was appointed during
the Vietnam War, when student
demonstrations put the campus in
an uproar. More recently, students
criticized Bok for refusing to
divest Harvard's holdings in
South Africa.
In 1982, Bok wrote "Beyond
the Ivory Tower," a book about
the social responsibilities of a uni
versity. This fall, Bok will occupy
his own small ivory tower at the
center, a one-room study with no
telephone, so he will not be dis
turbed.
Fellows have access to Univer
sity libraries in addition to the
center's support staff and facili
