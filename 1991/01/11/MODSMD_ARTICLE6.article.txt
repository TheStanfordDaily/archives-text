The Jackson Libraiy of the
Graduate School of Business is
now open for the first time since
the Loma Prieta earthquake,
after almost 15 months of refur
bishing and restoration costing
nearly $2.5 million dollars.
"No library in the history of
mankind has ever been as devas
tated by earthquake damage as
the Business School's Jackson
Library," commented a relieved
Bela Gallo, the library's director.
The effects of the damage on
Business School students have
been significant.
Students have had to study
and research at temporary and
satellite libraries in other Busi
ness School facilities due to the
collapse of internal walls and all
its bookshelves. In addition, the
library faced a book-threatening
flood, Gallo said.
Many students felt deprived
of the full research-oriented ser
vices normally provided by Jack
son Library, according to Busi
ness School Dean of Administra
tion Paul Johnson.
"Many voiced their dis
gruntlement in the Business
School newspaper and through
direct complaint," according to
Gallo.
Although the library will not
be in perfect working order until
the summer, Gallo said Business
School students can now find
the materials they need in one
place and should no longer have
difficulties pursuing research or

study.
"The library has made heroic
efforts to retrieve essential
materials and to provide stu
dents with the full service they
need as quickly as possible,"
Johnson said.
Both Gallo and Johnson said
the reconstruction and loss of
temporary library services will,
in the long run, prove to be a

positive development for Busi
ness School students.
"Before starting the recon
struction, we ran a series of
focus groups asking students
and faculty what improvements
to prior library service we could
make," Johnson said.
The recommendations were
then integrated into the refur
bishing process, and Johnson

feels the library is now more ser
viceable to students than before
the earthquake.
"Certain organizational
advantages were lost, but we
gained others," Gallo said. "We
are confident that when the
pluses and minuses are added we
will come away with a more
dynamic and effective library for
Business School research."
