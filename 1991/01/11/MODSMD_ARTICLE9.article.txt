# EPA administrator speaks on environmental issues

William Reilly, administrator
of the U.S. Environmental Pro
tection Agency, spoke at the
Graduate School of Business yes
terday, inviting the audience to
"come join the revolution."
His talk on the cost of envi
ronmental protection drew an

unexpectedly large crowd that
filled Bishop Auditorium to
capacity and required a closed
circuit overflow room.
Reilly expressed encourage
ment at the world's increasing
concern for the environment,
outlined top priority pollution
threats and congratulated Stan
ford for its "extraordinary sensi

tivity to public problems and
social issues."
The approach to environmen
tal policy has become more scien
tific and cost-conscious over the
past 15 years, Reilly noted. Pub
lic expectations not only in the
United States but worldwide are
higher, making his job "a terrifi
cally moving and exciting chal

lenge," he said.
Air toxics, pesticide residues,
climatic change, water-born
debris and the depletion of the
ozone layer are the most serious
forms of pollution, Reilly said,
stressing that "invisible sources"
as well as large industrial pol
luters make up the problem.
The EPA has asked industrial
polluters to voluntarily comply
with toxic omissions standards,
but Reilly emphasized that every
"little guy" must also contribute.
In the face of a growing popu
lation, the increased use of auto
mobiles and a higher gross
national product, results so far
are laudable: noxious gases in
the air are down, recycling
efforts have tripled, and there
are fish in the San Francisco Bay.
Next month, the EPA will
release a study on the costs of a
clean environment. Reilly
explained that in making poli
cies, the agency seeks to find
incentives for conservation and
prevention that are productive to
both the environment and the
economy.
The Clean Air Act, passed last
year by President George Bush
and Congress, was a triumph for
environmentalists across the
world, although progress since
then has been delayed as
national attention shifted
toward the Persian Gulf crisis.
But Reilly maintained that
"environmental policy is the sin
gle most successful field in public
policy in the history of the
United States."
Despite the fact that the
United States recycles at a rate

'Environmental poli
cy is the single most
successful field in
public policy in the
history of the United
States.'

only one-third that of Japan and
some other countries, it contin
ues to lead the world in environ
mental research and policy
development, Reilly said.
In addition, the amount of
funds the United States devotes
to "cleaning up" is considerable,
and Reilly is confident that it will
increase.
Reilly held five environment
related positions before becom
ing the seventh EPA administra
tor, including serving as presi
dent of the World Wildlife Fund
and president of the Conserva
tion Foundation. His education
includes a bachelor's degree
from Yale University, a law
degree from Harvard University
and a master's degree in urban
planning from Columbia Univer
sity.
Reilly's talk was the second
annual von Gugelberg Memorial
Lecture on the Environment.
Conradin von Gugelberg, an
alumnus of the Business School
who died shortly after graduat
ing, was known for his commit
ment to environmental protec
tion, particularly conservation
and recycling aluminum yogurt
covers.
