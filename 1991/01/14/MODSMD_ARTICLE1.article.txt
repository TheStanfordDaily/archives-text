# Students torn on Gulf war threat
## 
### Geoff Goldman Editorial staff 
Saturday's congressional
resolutions authorizing the use
of force in the Persian Gulf
brought the possibility of war a
step closer to home — for Stan
ford students as well as the rest
of the world.
Emotions among students
here are mixed and uncertain,
ranging from outright support
for an immediate invasion of
Iraq to belief that a war in the
Gulf should not be fought
under any circumstances to
fear of being drafted.
But while most students are
concerned, the congressional
resolutions, along with Presi
dent Bush's open letter to col
lege students and Saturday's
peace march in Palo Alto, still
have not totally permeated
everyday life at Stanford. Many
students on both sides of the
issue said they have not fully
accepted the possibility of war.
Sophomore Malika Dalai
said she believes we should not
use military force, but added,
"I don't worry about it now; I
have more pressing things to
worry about, like school and
stuff — but if I gave myself a
moment, I probably would
worry about it."
Keith Harrison, a sopho
more who said he would be
willing to fight if drafted, said
the possibility of war is "obvi
ously an issue on everyone's
mind, but I don't stay up at
night and worry about it."
As the January 15 United
Nations deadline approaches,
strong voices on both sides of
the issue are beginning to be
heard, along with an even
larger number of people who
seem to be caught in the mid
dle.
Many students appear torn
between two contrasting views
