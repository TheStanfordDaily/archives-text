# Students torn on Gulf war threat
## 
### Geoff Goldman Editorial staff 
Saturday's congressional
resolutions authorizing the use
of force in the Persian Gulf
brought the possibility of war a
step closer to home — for Stan
ford students as well as the rest
of the world.
Emotions among students
here are mixed and uncertain,
ranging from outright support
for an immediate invasion of
Iraq to belief that a war in the
Gulf should not be fought
under any circumstances to
fear of being drafted.
But while most students are
concerned, the congressional
resolutions, along with Presi
dent Bush's open letter to col
lege students and Saturday's
peace march in Palo Alto, still
have not totally permeated
everyday life at Stanford. Many
students on both sides of the
issue said they have not fully
accepted the possibility of war.
Sophomore Malika Dalai
said she believes we should not
use military force, but added,
"I don't worry about it now; I
have more pressing things to
worry about, like school and
stuff — but if I gave myself a
moment, I probably would
worry about it."
Keith Harrison, a sopho
more who said he would be
willing to fight if drafted, said
the possibility of war is "obvi
ously an issue on everyone's
mind, but I don't stay up at
night and worry about it."
As the January 15 United
Nations deadline approaches,
strong voices on both sides of
the issue are beginning to be
heard, along with an even
larger number of people who
seem to be caught in the mid
dle.
Many students appear torn
between two contrasting views
of the situation in the Gulf. They
understand the global, political
nature of the conflict and the jus
tifications government leaders
give for standing up to Saddam
Hussein.
But college-aged students also
share a very different perspective
on the conflict — the realization
that if a war begins, their lives
and the lives of their friends could
be at stake.
Some students said they would
support the congressional resolu
tions and would serve if a draft
were instituted. "I am inclined to
believe that [the members of
Congress] did not have a choice,"
said senior Joey Feldman. "It
would not have been good for the
U.S. if [the Congress and the pres
ident] had been split in such a
fundamental way. It would have
undermined everything Bush had
done."
Jaime Punis, a sophomore,
echoed Feldman's sentiments. He
said he is "kind of pleased with
the vote. . . . It's important for
Congress and the president to be
on the same track. Congressional
dissent would undermine the
strength of U.S. foreign policy."
However, other students
oppose the congressional resolu
tion and believe the U.S. should
not use military force now.
"I'm basically against
[Congress' decision]," said Nick
Gleason, a senior. "I'm not totally
against war, but this is not the
right time or way to go about it. .
.. Personally, I won't accept any
violence until negotiations have
really progressed."
Pericles Lewis, a graduate stu
dent in comparative literature,
took an even more dismal view of

U.S. policy. "There clearly is not
real consensus in this country in
favor of war; half the senators
voted against [the resolution]....
The whole thing is a cynical ploy
on Bush's part — there has been
no real attempt at peace talks."
For many, however, the issue is
not so clearly defined. Some stu
dents said they feel Saddam must
be made to leave Kuwait and
Congress' decision was inevitable.
However, many had reservations
about actually going to war and
particularly about the possibility
of a draft.
"Yes, I support the war, but I
wouldn't go if drafted," said
Sonny Singhania, a freshman.
"War is the right thing, in my
opinion, to d 0.... A possible war
is not as much a personal concern
now, but it will be if the U.S. actu
ally declares war."
Freshman Leslie Arai said,
"It's so easy to support the war if
you are. not directly involved. But
if I think about my little brother, I
wouldn't want him to go to war."
"Although I'm in favor of
Bush's newly acquired power to
declare war, he must exercise it in
order to peacefully drive Hussein
out of Kuwait, said lan Hochman,
a freshman. "If not, thousands of
innocent lives will be lost to a
senseless war."
"I believe that the vote was a
necessary move, but its necessity
does not make it any less fright
ening," said Matt Scelza, a fresh
man, adding that he is personally
opposed to the draft."
