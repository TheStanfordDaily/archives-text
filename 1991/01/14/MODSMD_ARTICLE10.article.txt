The meyor renovations at the
Stanford Bookstore have been fin
ished, leaving only minor details
to be attended to, according to
retail services manager Ken
Shark.
The Bookstore has been under
construction since this summer.
Minor details such as installing
and additional bookcases remain.
As part of the renovations tak
ing place at the Bookstore, a sin
gle-line system of paying for books
has been installed to increase effi
ciency, Shark said.
The single-line system was
installed over the holiday break.
Aside from the line being more
efficient, students perceive they
are spending less time in line
because they are kept moving,
according to Shark.
"[Buying books] was my worst
nightmare until now," said senior
Jeff Fox. "I feel much better about
buying books knowing that I
won't have to wait in line forever."
In addition, increased space
will allow the Bookstore to carry
more titles than any other campus
bookstore in the country, Shark
said. The new basement level has
already allowed for more book
space.
"I like the extra space," said
freshman Triz Chantrill. "It
makes it easier to find what I'm
looking for."
A new twist to the store will be
the presence of a cafe on the top
floor, where students will be able
to relax over a cup of coffee while
taking a break from the rigors of
shopping.
Sophomore Andy Cittadine
expressed enthusiasm over the
new cafe, saying, "I would come
here with a date for some coffee
and a book."
