# U.N. chief says only God knows if there will be war
## But PLO leader Yasser Arafat thinks there won't, while Saddam and Bush continue to talk tough 
### 
The U.N. secretary-general met with Saddam
Hussein for more than two hours yesterday in a bid
to avoid military conflict in the Persian Gulf, and
said later that "only God knows" if there will be war.
In an earlier radio address, the Iraqi leader reiter
ated that his country is ready to fight to keep con
quered Kuwait.
"That doesn't surprise me, but they're making a
tremendous mistake," Bush shot back, speaking to
reporters in Washington.
Javier Perez de Cuellar, the U.N. chief, left Bagh
dad immediately after his 2 1/2-hour meeting with
Saddam. The talks took place two days before the
Jan. 15 U.N. deadline for Iraq to withdraw from
Kuwait or face possible attack.
"I have always said that I am neither optimistic
or pessimistic but always hopeful. I could not have
been a secretary-general if I was not hopeful," Perez
de Cuellar told reporters before leaving for Paris,
where he was to meet wich President Francois Mit
terrand.
He said whether there will be war "is a question,
if you believe in God, only God knows.
"If you don't believe in God, who knows?" he
added.
Perez de Cuellar said he could not give details of
the talks but would inform the U.N. Security Council
of the Iraqi position when he meets with the council
in New York today.
"I can say that I have a very good idea of their
position and I represented some ideas of my own, all
in the sense of finding a peaceful solution to this
problem," he said.
Perez de Cuellar had said Saturday he carried no
specific proposals to Saddam.
French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said in a
television interview in Paris that the world was "a
hairsbreadth" from war. He said he might travel to
Baghdad depending on what Perez de Cuellar said.
"We will see what we can do in the 48 hours
before time runs out," he said, although Saddam has
not responded "to a single initiative, to a single out
stretched hand" aimed at a peaceful solution.

Secretary of State James Baker met with officials
in Ankara, Turkey, yesterday and reportedly dis
cussed use of an air base near the Iraqi border in case
of war.
He later flew to a British air base north of Lon
don, where he met British Prime Minister John
Major. Baker said he was "troubled" by Soviet mili
tary action in Lithuania but that it would not affect
military action in the gulf.
"It is desirable to move sooner rather than later,"
he added.
Iraq has said that if attacked by the U.S.-domi
nated multinational force, it would strike first at
Israel. Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens said
yesterday that Israel would respond to any Iraqi
attack, despite reported U.S. appeals for it to exercise
restraint.
Washington has reportedly urged Israel to keep
out of the conflict because it wants to keep together
the alliance against Iraq, which invaded Kuwait on
Aug. 2. Arab states such as Saudi Arabia, Syria and
Egypt are part of that alliance.
There were appeals yesterday for Saddam to leave
the occupied emirate from the pope, Saudi King
Fahd and Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi. On
Saturday, Syrian leader Hafez Assad urged Saddam
to withdraw and thereby spare Arabs a destructive
war.
Earlier yesterday, Perez de Cuellar met with PLO
leader Yasser Arafat and explained the proposals he
would make to Saddam, according to Arab diplo
mats.
After the meeting, Arafat told a news conference
he did not believe war would break out on Jan. 15.
"I don't believe the war will break out," Arafat
said. "Jan. 15 is only a date like all other dates."
He said, however, the U.S. Congress' endorsement
Saturday of military action could be damaging to
Perez de Cuellar's peace efforts.
In a message read yesterday over state Baghdad
radio, the Iraqi leader rejected the appeal from
Syria's Assad.
"Our 19th province has become a battlefield for
the showdown in which the (Arab) nation will be tri

umphant," Saddam said in the broadcast.
He urged Syria, which has committed nearly
20,000 troops to the 600,000-strong allied force, to
switch sides and join with Iraq.
"It will be an event which will be recorded in his
tory if President Hafez Assad joins the group of the
faithful and reacts with them so that the group will
be more powerful," he said.
Syria and Iraq are ruled by rival wings of the Arab
Baath Socialist Party and Assad and Saddam are

sworn enemies.
Saddam has summoned the National Assembly to
an emergency session today. The reason for the ses
sion was not disclosed, but Saddam has used the par
liament in the past to validate concessions during
the crisis.
Israel's warning yesterday was accompanied by a
show of its air power at a northern Israeli base. In
less than three minutes, technicians loaded camou
flage-painted jets with missiles, bombs and extra
fuel.
"If we are attacked, we will respond," Arens told
reporters. "We are prepared to defend ourselves and
will give a good account of ourselves."
Still, many foreigners in Israel weren't taking any
chances. At least five flights by Israel's El A 1
national airlines and Trans World Airlines left Tel
Aviv for the United States yesterday, including three
special flights.
Pope John Paul 11, in an unusually blunt appeal,
said yesterday that world leaders should not give up
on a peaceful solution to the gulf crisis and pressed
for an international conference to discuss all Middle
East problems.
"It is an appeal that I direct to Iraq so that it
makes a gesture of peace that would only do it honor
before history. It is an appeal that I direct to all inter
ested nations so that they organize, on their part, a
peace conference that contributes to resolving all the
problems of peaceful coexistence in the Middle
East," the pope said.
And Saudi King Fahd again urged Saddam to let
"wisdom and reason" prevail and order his forces to
withdraw, the Saudi Press Agency reported yester
day.
"Saudi Arabia does not wish to see a war at a 11...
and it is in the Iraqi leader's hands to spare the blood
of Iraqis and non-Iraqis," Fahd said.
Libya's Gadhafi endorsed Assad's appeal, saying
the Syrian leader's remarks "receive every apprecia
tion from us and are considered an unmistakable
pan-Arab commitment."
