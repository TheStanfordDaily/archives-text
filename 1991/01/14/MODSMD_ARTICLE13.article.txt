WASHINGTON (AP) -
Barbara Bush broke a bone in her
left leg yesterday when she hit a
tree while sledding at Camp
David, the White House said.
The mishap occurred on an icy
hill while the first lady was in a
sledding party with President
Bush, several grandchildren, actor
Arnold Schwarzenegger and other
guests.
The 65-year-old Mrs. Bush was
taken by ambulance to a hospital
in Hagerstown, Md., where X-rays
revealed "a non-displaced fracture
of the left fibula bone," said her
press secretary, Anna Perez.
The injury did not require a
cast, but Mrs. Bush was ordered
to stay off the leg for three days
and use crutches to walk after
that. She returned to the White
House in a wheelchair.

Doctors said the minor fracture
would take five to six weeks to
heal, Perez said, adding that Mrs.
Bush was experiencing some pain
but did not require medication.
Schwarzenegger, the former
Mr. Universe who is head of the
President's Council on Physical
Fitness, was a weekend guest at
Camp David with his wife, jour
nalist Maria Shriver, and their
baby daughter.
Mrs. Bush was looking some
what embarrassed and chagrined
as her husband walked beside her
wheelchair on their return to the
White House.
Asked if the leg hurt, Mrs.
Bush shook her head no, while the
president said, "Smarts a little."
"Easy for him to say," snapped
the first lady.
