Lithuania continued as the army

few and named a military com

assaulted broadcast facilities in

In addition, a delegation from

ganda campaign that competes
with the Stalinist period."

(who) gave the order to fire at
unarmed civilians."
The Belgian foreign minister,

Soviet government to halt mili
tary action immediately and
refrain from further threats
against other Baltic states.

Parliament, would compel us to
review with our European part
ners the support we are giving the
Soviet Union individually and col
lectively," Mtgor said in a state
ment.
NATO's political committee

Prize back!"
Gorbachev won the 1990 Nobel
Peace Prize.
Lithuania, a Soviet republic of
3.7 million, has been actively seek
