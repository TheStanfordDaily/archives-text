WASHINGTON (AP) - The rate of
attempted rapes of women in the United
States decreased by nearly a third from
1973 to 1987, according to a study released
yesterday by the Justice Department.
In 1973, attempted rapes and rapes
occurred at a rate of 1.9 per 1,000 women
12 and older. By 1987, the combined rate
had fallen to 1.3 per 1,000, the agency said
in its study.
The rate of attempted rapes declined
from 1.3 per 1,000 women in 1973 to 0.7 per
1,000 in 1987. The rate of completed rapes
was unchanged at 0.6 per 1,000, said
Caroline Harlow, who wrote the Bureau of
Justice Statistics study.
Criminologist Alfred Blumstein theo
rized that the decline could be attributable
to heightened male sensitivity to concerns
raised by women in the last 20 years.
But Blumstein, dean of the school of

urban and public affairs at Pittsburgh's
Carnegie-Mellon University, said he could
only guess at the reasons because many
women are still reluctant to report the
crime, making statistics unreliable.
Only 53 percent of rapes or attempted
rapes are reported to police, the study said.
But the survey estimated there were
137,509 rapes and attempted rapes in 1987,
down from 159,890 14 years earlier.
Women were more likely to call police if
raped by a stranger than by someone they
knew. Among women who were raped in or
near their home, 48 percent said the attack
er was someone they know, the study
found.
Rape accounted for 3 percent of all vio
lent crimes measured by the survey, accord
ing to the report, "Female Victims of
Violent Crime."
