## A
						skeptical response to presidential mail 
### 
Letter full of sloppy,
condescending logic
instead of explanations
Dear president bush:
It seems such a simple thing;
a "right-vs.-wrong" decision,
if you will.
If you want to convince college
students of the rightness of an
action, you don't resort to the kind
of good-vs.-evil argument you
would make to a small child, espe
cially on the issue of war.
Yet that is exactly what you did.
Your letter, written exclusively
for students at 460 colleges and
universities across the United
States, attempts to explain Ameri
can actions in the Persian Gulf as a
function of moral obligation.
Frankly, you have insulted our
intelligence.
If the Gulf crisis is so cut and
dried, if the choice is so "unam
biguous," how is it that, in autho
rizing the use of force in the Gulf,
the Senate did so by a vote of only
52 to 47? If the issues involved in
the crisis were truly "black and
white," wouldn't you expect just a
few more senators to agree with
you?
In your letter, you draw cm anal
ogy between armed men taking
over an American house and Sad
dam Hussein's having taken over
Kuwait. The connection is ridicu
lous. Like you said, Kuwait is
"halfway around the world." It is
not an American house. Indeed, for
us to consider Kuwait our house is
every bit as wrong as Iraq's consid
ering it its house.
No one doubts the ruthlessness
and cruelty with which the Kuwaiti
people have been treated, as
Amnesty International has docu
mented. But it simply does not fol
low that the United States should
embark upon its current course of
action to relieve the Kuwaiti people
of Iraq's oppression.
After all, one of the "atrocities"
which Amnesty International doc
uments, "imposition of the death
penalty," can be found right here at
home.
You also state that you are
"determined to do absolutely
everything possible in the search
for a peaceful resolution to this cri
sis." Yet later you say that we must
look Saddam Hussein in the eye
and "proclaim for now and for the
future: no compromises."
How can you hope to avoid a mil
itary confrontation if you rule out
any and all compromises? Clearly,
we should not reward Iraq's
aggression. But if we are commit
ted to a peaceful solution, as you
say we are, then we must be open
to negotiations.
Which is it?
AS COLLEGE STUDENTS,
we make up a large part of
three very important groups.
First, if the United States goes to
war and if that war should last
longer than expected and require
troop replenishments, we will be
the first to be drafted.
Second, when November 1992
rolls around, we will all be in a
position to vote for or against your
efforts for re-election. You can bet
we will be thinking about the Gulf
when we go to the polls.
And third, we are the leaders of
the next generation. Our education
trains us to analyze issues with a
critical mind. Quite honestly, it's
frightening to think that the leader
of our nation could approach such
crucial decisions as those which
you will make in the coming days

and see them as simply good vs.
evil.
There may or may not be paral
lels between a war with Iraq and
other wars into which the United
States has ventured in recent
decades. But, among other things,
we have learned that wars take
longer than expected; more lives
are lost than anticipated. And what
seems black and white going in
(remember the Senate's over
whelming support of the Gulf of
Tonkin resolution?) comes out
awfully gray.
Good-vs.-evil thinking only
works in fairy tales and comic
books. And even if good always did
win out over evil, who appointed
the United States lord protector?
In your penultimate paragraph,
you say that the United States and
its allies in the Gulf can "assure
that ... the principles on which
this nation and the rest of the civi
lized world are founded are pre
served." With all of your experi
ence in diplomacy, you know as
well as we do that American princi
ples are not universal.
Indeed, to assume so is danger
ous. We learned that when we tried
to create a South Vietnam under
the rule of Ngo Dinh Diem.
What if you had leveled with us
and given us a real explication of
American policy?
There are moments in
your letter when you allude
to some key factors in the cri
sis, but they are few and far
between.
You point out that "a Saddam
Hussein armed with weapons of
mass destruction" poses a grave
threat. Mind you, this threat was
not an issue until after Iraq
invaded Kuwait. Until then, Sad
dam Hussein was our buddy. When
he attacked Iran, we had no com
plaints.
In fact, Hussein's arsenal of
weapons and his continuing
progress in building a nuclear
weapon is terrifying, for the
nations around Iraq and for the
rest of the world. Hussein has
shown no qualms about using
whatever weapons he has when
ever he feels like it.
But if you want to attack Iraq in
order to destroy his biological and
chemical weapons or to set back his
nuclear weapons program a
decade, then say so! Don't tell us
we may be drafted to fight for the
freedom of the Kuwaiti people.
Or maybe your main concern is
economic; we need to wrest
Kuwait's oil from Hussein's grip.
Already, this is a much less com
pelling reason than the concern
over Hussein's arsenal; but if
that's the reason, don't just drop
one sentence in your letter about
the world's oil supply.
Give us the truth.
If it is your goal to reassert the
United States' power and influence
in a changing world, then say it. If
your hope is that by defeating Iraq
in a surgical military maneuver the
United States can announce to
other would-be threats to Ameri
can allies and interests that they
had better think twice, say that.
Don't give us a lesson in moral
ity. American foreign policy is not
based on morality.
MR. PRESIDENT, WE re
ceived your letter with
high expectations. We
earnestly hoped we would find an
intelligent account of the current
Gulf crisis, an account that would
answer many, if not all, of our
questions about the path upon
which the nation has embarked.
You failed our expectations.
