# Peace march protests Bush policy in Iraq
## 
### Peter Robison Staff writer 
More than 1,000 protesters, many of them Stan
ford students and faculty, staged a peace march
Saturday against President Bush's Middle East
policy, an event that organizer Paul George called
"the largest rally ever held in Palo Alto."
At 11 a.m., a crowd that police estimated at
1,200 gathered in front of Palo Alto's City Hall,
waving banners bearing the words, "Impeach the
Imperial President" and "No Oil War For King
George." One placard read: "Kuwait — it's Arabic
for Panama."
After a chorus of "Give Peace a Chance," John
Lennon's Vietnam-era peace anthem, the demon
strators marched down University Avenue at noon
chanting, "No war, no way, U.S. out of the Gulf
today."
Ironically, the march was staged during the vote
in Congress that authorized President Bush to use

force in the Gulf.
George, the director of the Peninsula Peace Cen
ter in Palo Alto, estimated the crowd at "3,000 at
its peak" and said the rally was "effective, because
it is part of a continuing process of building protest
to this war policy." He noted that only 50 people
turned out for a similar rally at the same site in
August.
Steve Pich6, a graduate student who marched in
an Uncle Sam costume, was also pleased by the
event's turnout. "This is Palo Alto, California, and
look at the number of people on the streets," he
said. "To get people out in the streets about some
thing takes a lot."
The rally's featured speaker, Robert McAfee
Brown, a former Stanford chaplain, drew the loud
est cheers of the day when he said, "Let us remind
Mr. Bush that if he starts a war, we will start work
ing to remove him from office, along with those

who support him."
"Five and a half months is not
long enough to write off sanc
tions, and five and a half hours in
Geneva is not long enough to
write off negotiations," he said.
Other speakers included a
Vietnam war veteran, a represen
tative of the National Organiza
tion for Women, and senior Aim6e
Allison, a former member of the
Council of Presidents.
"I cannot set aside my values
of right and wrong in order to fol
low orders," said Allison, a mem
ber of the Army National Guard
in Sunnyvale who has filed for
conscientious-objector status. "I
want to carry on the proud tradi
tion of Martin Luther King,
which is non-violence."
Allison said her experience at
Stanford has challenged her to
develop her own personal philoso
phy, one that has changed since
she entered the ROTC program
when she was 17. "My attempt to
attain conscientious objector sta
tus is the least my conscience will
allow," she said.
Another student, Ken Hoff
man, helped distribute draft
information at the rally. Hoff
man, a sophomore, is a Peace
Center volunteer.
"I'm for the peaceful means,
the sanctions," he said. "The
American public doesn't really
know how well the sanctions are
working."
Senior Linguistics lecturer
Khalil Barhoum blasted the
"hypocrisy" of U.S. policy.
He concluded, "No war for oil,
no war for feudal powers and no
war for a continued Israeli occu
pation of Palestine that we refuse
to address."
