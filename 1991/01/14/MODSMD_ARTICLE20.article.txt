## The
						Sound of Music??? 
### 
FOR A LONG TIME I BELIEVED in
that cliched adage, "You can do any
thing if you try." After all, what
more comforting, more egalitarian con
cept could exist than this one asserting
the limitless abilities of each and every
human being?
But this idea eventually went the way
all illusions inevitably go-down the toilet.
I discovered the art of singing and the
challenge of controlling the human voice
â€” at least controlling my voice. Though
to be honest, my singing resembles the
squawks of a hoarse chicken more than
anything human.
This is not to say, by any means, that I
had mastered all other conceivable tal
ents up to this point. To be sure, I had
met with difficulty and distress in count
less other endeavors, but this was the
first instance I experienced pure, unadul
terated failure.
With other undertakings, my efforts
had always been rewarded with some sort
of accomplishment, however minute. I
had been able to muster at least the low
est level of proficiency in other skills, but
I got absolutely nowhere with singing.
Before I enrolled in the choral class in
high school, I was under the impression
that singing was relatively easy to learn. I
even dared to hope that I possessed some
heretofore hidden talent that would
miraculously manifest itself the first day
I opened my mouth in class.
After all, I thought I sounded pretty
good whenever I sang in the shower. And
I believed that I could learn to improve
the sound of my voice.
I used to wonder what the big deal was.

So what if professional singers could hold
notes for a really long time? So what if
they could fill a gigantic room with beau
tiful sound?
Then I tried it myself. What a laugh. I
sound as awful today as I did before I took
singing class.
I forgot that the voice I hear in my
head when I use my vocal chords is very
different from the sound everyone else
hears. I forgot that I hated tape recorders
and answering machines because the
sound of my voice always makes me
cringe.
I discovered that I couldn't even hit
half the notes, much less hold them for
any length of time without making it
sound like I'm going to expire on the spot.
At least this failure has instilled in me
a new appreciation for the talent of opera
singers, or of any singers for that matter.
I've even come to appreciate the likes
of, say, Debbie Gibson, along with other
pop singers. Her lyrics may be insipid and
her music trite, but at least she's in tune
most of the time.
There are plenty of things I can't do,
but I wish singing wasn't one of them. It's
actually a lot of fun, even if I am lousy at
it. I had a good time singing in chorale. I
guess all the other voices drowning mine
out made me forget how horrible I was.
Maybe part of the appeal of singing lies
in certain silly romantic notions I have
attached to it. For instance, I imagine
how sweet it would be to lull a baby to
sleep by singing to it. With my voice,
though, the infant would probably start
to wail uncontrollably at the first note
that issued from my mouth.

Or I imagine what fun it would be to go
caroling during Christmas time, or to ser
enade somebody.
Maybe I've just watched too many
musicals in which everyone bursts into
song at just the appropriate moving
moments.
I've generally gotten over my inability
to sing and accepted the fact that I am
simply not blessed with melodious vocal
chords. Various singing groups on campus
have recently been looking for new mem
bers, however, and I can't help feeling
wistful about not having the talent to
audition.
When I'm in a really optimistic mood, I
sometimes delude myself into thinking
that maybe my singing isn't so bad, that
maybe if I took voice lessons I could learn
to sing at least decently.
I suppose I still have difficulty accept
ing the idea that anyone can accomplish
anything simply by trying.
But fortunately I always come back to
reality. It's for the best, I guess. I save
myself a lot of embarrassment and keep
the environment free from at least one
form of noise pollution:
