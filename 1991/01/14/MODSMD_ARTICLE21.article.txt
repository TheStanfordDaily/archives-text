## Home-based learning well worth more consideration 
### 
WE CHOSE TO HAVE OUR two
daughters learn at home full-time
this year, thereby joining the
growing numbers of home-schooling fam
ilies.
This decision was initially motivated
by our desire to prepare them for their
transition into Australian schools, and
this experience has proved most reward
ing; better than we had hoped, so much so
that now on our return to Australia, we
will think very long and hard before
choosing to send our girls to school.
We find more positives all the time.
The biggest plus is that learning has
become a more natural part of our lives
and we feel even closer as a family.
Our experience has led us to wonder
what might happen if home-based learn
ing was to become the norm. Instead of
schools, each community could have edu
cation centers providing extensive
resources and guidance to all the mem
bers of the community.
Teachers could visit individual chil
dren and their families when they need
extra attention in specific areas. They
could also be involved in education
research and formulating curriculums.
Those families who cannot or choose not
to teach their own children would benefit
from much smaller classes for their chil
dren.
The education funding would be allo
cated very differently. There would be
fewer teachers' salaries to be paid, but
teachers could be offered salaries befit
ting their abilities, and there would be
more money for books and other
resources and there may well be room for
a monetary allotment to help the parent
at home.
Home-based learning might also foster
home-based businesses. This would help
the family financially, and children would
learn from first-hand experience. When

children learn in family-sized groups,
children and adults alike can cover basic
skills more thoroughly and efficiently,
enabling more unstructured time to be
involved in their community. To this end,
the education centers could also be infor
mation centers for home-based busi
nesses and community volunteer work.
The potential benefits of home-based
education seem well worthy of serious
consideration for families who have their
children's long-term interests at heart.
The lack of basic skills like literacy would
be easily detected and would get prompt
attention.
Best of all, children would grow with
family and community pride. Tneir natu
ral love of learning would be free to soar
because each student's work could be as
individual as the child.
The new generation would have
choices and opportunities we never had
with greatly increased family involve
ment. Then, we might sincerely join with
Dr. Seuss when he tells the newest gener
ation, "Oh, the places you'll go."
