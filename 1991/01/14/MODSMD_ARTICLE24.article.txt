## Aimée Allison Conscience of Stanford reservist leads her to reject all war 
### 
I AM A COMBAT MEDIC IN the Army
Reserve*. In early December, I applied
for a discharge aa a conscientious
objector. I believe that it is my moral and
religious duty to work to improve the
human condition, not to destroy life.
Like many in the black community, I
was heavily influenced by the church in
my formative years through attendance,
youth group and teaching Sunday School.
I adopted the Biblical ethic "Thou shalt
not kill" and applied it and other rules as
the Christian method of peacefully resolv
ing difTerences.
Planning on attending Stanford, I was
attracted to the Army by the ads that
promised to aid in the cost of college.
At 17,1 did not know much about the
military, the realities of war, the world or
myself. I did not vet have an opportunity
to be challenged by my university educa
tion and experiences and to shape my
moral philosophy.
A mcyor factor in the development of
my consciousness was my military train
ing. In boot camp bayonet training, we

were required to yell in response to
"What's the spirit of the bayonet? — To
kill, to kill, to kill with no mercy!"
Another common cadence was "Kill the
people, burn the village!"
As a combat medic, I was taught to
triage — establishing priorities for evacu
ating patients by ranking last those
"causalities who will probably not sur
vive," such as massive brain destructions
and 3rd degree burns over 85 percent of
the body area. These people are the last to
receive help, if any. One of my military
instructors told me that even though it is
unpleasant, it is my duty to make the sol
dier as comfortable as possible, and let
him die.
At the Palo Alto Veterans Administra
tion, I was exposed to the destructive
mental and physical long-term effects of
war. I cared for a Korean war veteran who
lost his legs and several Vietnam vets who
were paralyzed in battle.
Just as bad as the physical destruction
were the psychological effects of war.
Before I was issued my white uniform, I

was not allowed on to the wards because
the sight of battle dress fatigues induces
flashbacks to wartime.
War has caused these men to lose a
part of themselves, and I feel deep regret
that their ability to contribute to society
was impeded because of war. I could no
more "kill the people and burn the vil
lage" than I could patch up wounded sol
diers to continue to kill people or burn vil
lages — and end up in a veterans hospital
20 years later, hopeless and helpless.
My academic study and extracurricu
lar activity at Stanford has greatly influ
enced my thoughts on war. In my Ameri
can and African history classes, I learned
that violent force was, in many ways,
responsible for the current status of black
America. At the same time, there is a
great tradition in the black community of
non-violent struggle against oppression. I
began to view myself as a beneficiary of
this legacy.
When I came to college, I thought the
Cold War was justified because we were
fighting the so-called evil empire. At

Stanford, however, my view of our great
enemy changed. As Student Body Presi
dent, I had the privilege of greeting Pres
ident Gorbachev during his visit to Stan
ford.
I was able to view him as a real person,
and a leader with a great desire for peace.
His trip to the United States signaled the
end of the Cold War, and I had new-found
hope that not only communities but coun
tries could find non-violent ways to
resolve differences in a new world order
based on peace and cooperation.
From my struggle to improve Stan
ford's curriculum and tutoring in East
Palo Alto to lobbying in the state legisla
ture and registering voters in Alabama, I
have worked non-violently to affect
change. I view education as my area of
advocacy and have dedicated myself to
this cause. I hope to do this as a teacher
working with inner city children.
Over the past few years, I have learned
much about the world and myself. Dr.
King taught me:
"There is a powerful motivation when

a suppressed people enlist in an army that
marches under the banner of non-vio
lence. Non-violent soldiers are called
upon to examine and burnish their great
est weapons — their heart, their con
science, their courage, and their sense of
justice."
Since I left the sheltered provinciality
of Antioch, I have learned that there is
more than enough violence and hate in
the world. It is here in my own backyard,
East Palo Alto, where gang warfare, vio
lent crime, and police brutality, make life
cheap.
Rather than force myself to comply
with this cycle of death and destruction, I
want to carry on the proud non-violent
tradition I have inherited from my prede
cessors — Martin Luther King, Ida B.
Wells, W.E.B. Dußois and Rosa Parks.
Like them, I truly believe that there is a
more powerful way to resolve the con
flicts and inequities in today's world —
non-violent moral force.

instructors told me that even though it is
unpleasant, it is my duty to make the sol
dier as comfortable as possible, and let
him die.
At the Palo Alto Veterans Administra
tion, I was exposed to the destructive
mental and physical long-term effects of
war. I cared for a Korean war veteran who
lost his legs and several Vietnam vets who
were paralyzed in battle.
Just as bad as the physical destruction
were the psychological effects of war.
Before I was issued my white uniform, I

was not allowed on to the wards because
the sight of battle dress fatigues induces
flashbacks to wartime.
War has caused these men to lose a
part of themselves, and I feel deep regret
that their ability to contribute to society
was impeded because of war. I could no
more "kill the people and burn the vil
lage" than I could patch up wounded sol
diers to continue to kill people or burn vil
lages — and end up in a veterans hospital
20 years later, hopeless and helpless.
My academic study and extracurricu
lar activity at Stanford has greatly influ
enced my thoughts on war. In my Ameri
can and African history classes, I learned
that violent force was, in many ways,
responsible for the current status of black
America. At the same time, there is a
great tradition in the black community of
non-violent struggle against oppression. I
began to view myself as a beneficiary of
this legacy.
When I came to college, I thought the
Cold War was justified because we were
fighting the so-called evil empire. At

Stanford, however, my view of our great
enemy changed. As Student Body Presi
dent, I had the privilege of greeting Pres
ident Gorbachev during his visit to Stan
ford.
I was able to view him as a real person,
and a leader with a great desire for peace.
His trip to the United States signaled the
end of the Cold War, and I had new-found
hope that not only communities but coun
tries could find non-violent ways to
resolve differences in a new world order
based on peace and cooperation.
From my struggle to improve Stan
ford's curriculum and tutoring in East
Palo Alto to lobbying in the state legisla
ture and registering voters in Alabama, I
have worked non-violently to affect
change. I view education as my area of
advocacy and have dedicated myself to
this cause. I hope to do this as a teacher
working with inner city children.
Over the past few years, I have learned
much about the world and myself. Dr.
King taught me:
"There is a powerful motivation when

a suppressed people enlist in an army that
marches under the banner of non-vio
lence. Non-violent soldiers are called
upon to examine and burnish their great
est weapons — their heart, their con
science, their courage, and their sense of
justice."
Since I left the sheltered provinciality
of Antioch, I have learned that there is
more than enough violence and hate in
the world. It is here in my own backyard,
East Palo Alto, where gang warfare, vio
lent crime, and police brutality, make life
cheap.
Rather than force myself to comply
with this cycle of death and destruction, I
want to carry on the proud non-violent
tradition I have inherited from my prede
cessors — Martin Luther King, Ida B.
Wells, W.E.B. Dußois and Rosa Parks.
Like them, I truly believe that there is a
more powerful way to resolve the con
flicts and inequities in today's world —
non-violent moral force.
