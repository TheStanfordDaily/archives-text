## Resurgent Cardinal slams Washington State 94-63 Red-hot offense burns Cougars 
### Robert Pardington Senior staff writer 
â€¢ On a weekend when the San
Francisco 49ers were continuing
their machine-like destruction of
other NFL teams with a win over
the Washington Redskins, Stan
ford's men's basketball team was
showing ofT some explosive offen
sive machinery of its own, with
their second consecutive 30-point
victory. This time it was a 94-63
blow-out of Washington State (not
the city).
The Cougars were coming off a
very close loss to Arizona at home
and a win over California Thurs
day night. The match-up with the
Cardinal was sure to be close,
right?
Well, WSU was hampered by
the disciplining of two starters by
coach Kelvin Sampson, but their
main problem was dealing with
Stanford's suddenly very potent
offense.
"It's hard when you come into
the game knowing that their obvi
ous strength is your obvious
weakness," Sampson said after
the game. "They don't have any
weaknesses in their front line."
The Cardinal recognized it
would have a significant advan
tage over the Cougars down low,
and coach Mike Montgomery sent
the ball into center Adam Keefe
and power forward Andrew Vla
hov right away.
Vlahov in particular was
unstoppable, and he went 4 for 4
in the first half. On the game,
Vlahov missed only one of his
seven shots, finishing with 12
points and seven assists.
Inexplicably, the Cougars went
with a man-to-man defense for
most of the game, a defensive for
mation that Keefe and Vlahov like
to see, but rarely do.
"I prefer (man-to-man), but we
don't see it very often," Vlahov
said. "If we can get one-on-one on
the post, then Keefe is licking his
chops."
Keefe didn't really get
iintracked until the second half.
When the ball finally started com
ing to him, though, Keefe was
undeniable. He scored 19 of his
26 points in the second half, most
on layups and dunks inside, and
two on a fancy reverse dunk off of
a breakaway steal.
"In the second half we had
much better ball movement,"

Adam Keefe throws down two of his 26 points in a 94-63 victory over Washington State Saturday at
Maples Pavilion. Keefe had three monster slams to lead the Cardinal to its second consecutive
30-polnt win.
Keefe said. "When we move the
ball around, we're a very good ball
team."
Stanford scored 53 of its points
after halftime, and everyone got
into the act. All of the starters
scored in double figures.
Sophomore point guard Mar
cus Lollie came off the bench to
throw in eight points and give out
eight assists.
"We got some fast breaks
tonight," Montgomery said. "Mar
cus came in and really did a good
job of moving the ba11.... With
the fast break, we're playing posi
tively, up on our heels."
Montgomery was of course
pleased by his team's newfound
offensive potential and excellent
all-around play. But he empha
sized that a big win like this one
doesn't count for any more in the
standings.
"Margin of victory has nothing
to do with it whatsoever," Mont
gomery said. "I wish I could save
these 30 points and use them
later."
The points themselves can't be
saved, but the confidence and
sense of potential should carry
over from these two big homes
wins to games with UCLA and
USC in Los Angeles this weekend.
