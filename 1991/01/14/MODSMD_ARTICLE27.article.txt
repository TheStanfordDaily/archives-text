# Stanford sneaks by Washington, WSU

### David Hirning Senior staff writer 
SEATTLE — When the Stanford women's
basketball team plays against the Washington
Huskies in Seattle, it doesn't just play the
Huskies. It also must play The Crowd, seven
thousand screaming hoops maniacs who love
to hate their visitors from the south.
"Their crowd is worth, between 10 and 20
points," said Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer
after the game.

1 Cardinal 75, Huskies 71
Cardinal 80, Cougars 74 |

Last year, a confident, undefeated Cardinal
squad sucuumbed to The Crowd and lost its
only game of the year by three points. This
year, a battle-tested Stanford team shook off
the environs and a late Washington rally to
down the No. 13-ranked Huskies on Friday,
75-71.
"The crowd did their part, we just didn't do
ours," said a chagrined Washington coach
Chris Gobrecht.
The "big win" may have lulled Stanford to
sleep for the second game of the trip against
Washington State. After leading by only one at
half, the Cardinal managed to hold on and
escape with a six-point victory over the
Cougars, 80-74.
Along with yesterday's win, the triumph
over the Huskies puts the 10-3 Cardinal in
command of the Pacific 10 Conference race.
Stanford is now all alone at the top of the
standings at 4-0, and chief rival Washington
must visit Maples Pavilion Feb. 9.
"This hurts a lot (in the conference)," Gob
recht said. "It puts an awful lot of pressure on
UB."
While there's no disputing that the win
over the Huskies was important in the confer
ence race, it may have been more important to
Stanford emotionally.
The team has taken a few knocks this sea
son after a near-perfect championship cam
paign last year. Three early losses (two more
than all of last year) and rebounding trouble
have led to some questions, as has a fluctuat
ing lineup. The Cardinal dropped out of the
top 10 for the first time since the 1988-89 sea
son.
Add this to last year's loss and the already
present rivalry with the Huskies, and Stanford
entered the game with a mission. "We wanted

it bad," said leading scorer Julie Zeilstra. "We
wanted to come back here and beat 'em. I per
sonally was not going to let our team lose."
The team and VanDerveer were quick to
mention the Cardinal's difficult schedule as a
key to their big victory. "We've played an
incredibly tough schedule, and that schedule
helped us get ready for tonight," VanDerveer
said. "Georgia, Long Beach, Texas, and Ten
nessee are all stronger teams (than Washing
ton)."
Although the final margin was close, the
much-anticipated game with the Huskies was
dominated by the Cardinal for much of the
contest. After trailing early on, Stanford went
on a 26-8 run that staked the Cardinal to 17-
point lead with 1:56 left in the first half.
Senior center Trisha Stevens keyed the
Stanford streak with 15 first-half points on an
impeccable 7 of 7 from the field. Time and
again, the Cardinal isolated Stevens one-on
one with Washington's only true post player, 6-
foot-4 Karen Deden. Once Stevens had the
ball, Deden was unable to stop the Stanford
All-American, who finished with 21 to lead all
scorers.
"She kept getting the ball," said a some
what philosophical Deden, who led the
Huskies with 19 points. "Trisha's gonna get
the ball, because that's your offense. That's
the way it's supposed to be. If I had Trisha on
my team, she would get the ball too."
The Crowd and the Huskies didn't fold,
however, and rallied to trail by just 11 at the
half. Four-and-a-half minutes into the second
half, a Sorya Henning three-pointer staked the
Cardinal to its biggest lead of the night, 51-33.
Then, slowly, the Huskies fought their way
back.
"They came out there with a press, and
made some actyustments that got them back in
it," VanDerveer said.
Tara Davis and Laura Moore answered with
three-pointers of their own. Fourteen. Three
minutes later, a six-footer by Deden makes the
deficit 10. Five straight misses at the free
throw line, four by Sor\ja Henning, and it was
nine. With four-and-a-half left, Stanford was
on top, 72-59. It would not score again until
just 24 seconds remained.
With the crowd in a frenzy, the Cardinal
seemed to realize, finally, that it could lose. A
rash of turnovers and missed free throws fol
lowed, and suddenly it seemed like last year all
over again.
Zeilstra and Henning both missed the
front-ends of one-and-ones. Washington
canned a three-pointer. The 30-second clock
runs out on the Cardinal. Husky forward

Dianne Williams made an eight-footer in the
lane. It's a four-point ballgame. Offensive foul
on Zeilstra.
Turnabout is fair play, and the Huskies
miss a free throw. Martha Richards throws up
an airball, but turns around to tie-up the ball
on the other end. Possession — Stanford. With
30 seconds left, Washington must foul, and
they go for Henning. But, in a call that is rare
except in break-away situations, the foul is
ruled intentional, giving Henning two shots
and the ball. The call is questionable — Hen
ning may have tripped.
She makes one. She is fouled again, and
this time converts one and the bonus. Game,
Stanford. A Deden three-pointer at the buzzer
meant nothing.
"We were full of rookie mistakes in the first
half, and we solved the mysteries at halftime,"
said Gobrecht. "We were getting poor shots
and hanging our heads on defense. In the sec
ond half we stopped doing that and chipped
away If we'd have done that in the first half,
we would have won the game."
The Cardinal started its big lineup, with
Stevens, Zelistra, and Val Whiting, and kept
the inside pressure on the Huskies. The result
was a 38-37 rebounding edge, which may have
been the difference in the game. Stanford is 4-
0 in games in which it outrebounds the opposi
tion. Whiting led the way with nine boards to
go with her 14 points.
Stevens played 25 minutes, despite her nag
ging tendinitis, and again paced the Cardinal
in a big game. "The thing I like about Trisha is
that she has no excuses," VanDerveer said.
"She's a clutch, big-time player, and she's a pil
lar of this program."
Last year, Stanford's loss to Washington
taught it a lesson that led eventually to a
national championship diploma. This year, it is
Washington who hopes to learn from the
game. "We became a much better team in one
basketball game, and we just have to make
sure we don't lose again. We don't want to go
down there (to Stanford) and have a repeat of
last year's [40-point loss]."
Card notes
In Pullman, the Cardinal were figured to romp
over the Cougars, who have never beaten Stanford
in 10 tries. Washington State is also missing star
player Angie Miller, 12th in the conference in scor
ing at 15.7 points per game, who injured her knee
against Arizona State.
But, as VanDerveer reiterates, the Pac-10 is
much improved, and the Cougars showed it by

It was the Golden Bears' lowest point
total of the season. WSU entered the
game with Stanford at 9-3, and 2-1 in
the conference. The Cougars almpst
made it 3-1 with a huge upset, which
Stanford narrowly averted.

squad sucuumbed to The Crowd and lost its
only game of the year by three points. This
year, a battle-tested Stanford team shook off
the environs and a late Washington rally to
down the No. 13-ranked Huskies on Friday,
75-71.
"The crowd did their part, we just didn't do
ours," said a chagrined Washington coach
Chris Gobrecht.
The "big win" may have lulled Stanford to
sleep for the second game of the trip against
Washington State. After leading by only one at
half, the Cardinal managed to hold on and
escape with a six-point victory over the
Cougars, 80-74.
Along with yesterday's win, the triumph
over the Huskies puts the 10-3 Cardinal in
command of the Pacific 10 Conference race.
Stanford is now all alone at the top of the
standings at 4-0, and chief rival Washington
must visit Maples Pavilion Feb. 9.
"This hurts a lot (in the conference)," Gob
recht said. "It puts an awful lot of pressure on
UB."
While there's no disputing that the win
over the Huskies was important in the confer
ence race, it may have been more important to
Stanford emotionally.
The team has taken a few knocks this sea
son after a near-perfect championship cam
paign last year. Three early losses (two more
than all of last year) and rebounding trouble
have led to some questions, as has a fluctuat
ing lineup. The Cardinal dropped out of the
top 10 for the first time since the 1988-89 sea
son.
Add this to last year's loss and the already
present rivalry with the Huskies, and Stanford
entered the game with a mission. "We wanted

it bad," said leading scorer Julie Zeilstra. "We
wanted to come back here and beat 'em. I per
sonally was not going to let our team lose."
The team and VanDerveer were quick to
mention the Cardinal's difficult schedule as a
key to their big victory. "We've played an
incredibly tough schedule, and that schedule
helped us get ready for tonight," VanDerveer
said. "Georgia, Long Beach, Texas, and Ten
nessee are all stronger teams (than Washing
ton)."
Although the final margin was close, the
much-anticipated game with the Huskies was
dominated by the Cardinal for much of the
contest. After trailing early on, Stanford went
on a 26-8 run that staked the Cardinal to 17-
point lead with 1:56 left in the first half.
Senior center Trisha Stevens keyed the
Stanford streak with 15 first-half points on an
impeccable 7 of 7 from the field. Time and
again, the Cardinal isolated Stevens one-on
one with Washington's only true post player, 6-
foot-4 Karen Deden. Once Stevens had the
ball, Deden was unable to stop the Stanford
All-American, who finished with 21 to lead all
scorers.
"She kept getting the ball," said a some
what philosophical Deden, who led the
Huskies with 19 points. "Trisha's gonna get
the ball, because that's your offense. That's
the way it's supposed to be. If I had Trisha on
my team, she would get the ball too."
The Crowd and the Huskies didn't fold,
however, and rallied to trail by just 11 at the
half. Four-and-a-half minutes into the second
half, a Sorya Henning three-pointer staked the
Cardinal to its biggest lead of the night, 51-33.
Then, slowly, the Huskies fought their way
back.
"They came out there with a press, and
made some actyustments that got them back in
it," VanDerveer said.
Tara Davis and Laura Moore answered with
three-pointers of their own. Fourteen. Three
minutes later, a six-footer by Deden makes the
deficit 10. Five straight misses at the free
throw line, four by Sor\ja Henning, and it was
nine. With four-and-a-half left, Stanford was
on top, 72-59. It would not score again until
just 24 seconds remained.
With the crowd in a frenzy, the Cardinal
seemed to realize, finally, that it could lose. A
rash of turnovers and missed free throws fol
lowed, and suddenly it seemed like last year all
over again.
Zeilstra and Henning both missed the
front-ends of one-and-ones. Washington
canned a three-pointer. The 30-second clock
runs out on the Cardinal. Husky forward

Dianne Williams made an eight-footer in the
lane. It's a four-point ballgame. Offensive foul
on Zeilstra.
Turnabout is fair play, and the Huskies
miss a free throw. Martha Richards throws up
an airball, but turns around to tie-up the ball
on the other end. Possession — Stanford. With
30 seconds left, Washington must foul, and
they go for Henning. But, in a call that is rare
except in break-away situations, the foul is
ruled intentional, giving Henning two shots
and the ball. The call is questionable — Hen
ning may have tripped.
She makes one. She is fouled again, and
this time converts one and the bonus. Game,
Stanford. A Deden three-pointer at the buzzer
meant nothing.
"We were full of rookie mistakes in the first
half, and we solved the mysteries at halftime,"
said Gobrecht. "We were getting poor shots
and hanging our heads on defense. In the sec
ond half we stopped doing that and chipped
away If we'd have done that in the first half,
we would have won the game."
The Cardinal started its big lineup, with
Stevens, Zelistra, and Val Whiting, and kept
the inside pressure on the Huskies. The result
was a 38-37 rebounding edge, which may have
been the difference in the game. Stanford is 4-
0 in games in which it outrebounds the opposi
tion. Whiting led the way with nine boards to
go with her 14 points.
Stevens played 25 minutes, despite her nag
ging tendinitis, and again paced the Cardinal
in a big game. "The thing I like about Trisha is
that she has no excuses," VanDerveer said.
"She's a clutch, big-time player, and she's a pil
lar of this program."
Last year, Stanford's loss to Washington
taught it a lesson that led eventually to a
national championship diploma. This year, it is
Washington who hopes to learn from the
game. "We became a much better team in one
basketball game, and we just have to make
sure we don't lose again. We don't want to go
down there (to Stanford) and have a repeat of
last year's [40-point loss]."
Card notes
In Pullman, the Cardinal were figured to romp
over the Cougars, who have never beaten Stanford
in 10 tries. Washington State is also missing star
player Angie Miller, 12th in the conference in scor
ing at 15.7 points per game, who injured her knee
against Arizona State.

Stanford narrowly averted.

SEATTLE — When the Stanford women's
basketball team plays against the Washington
Huskies in Seattle, it doesn't just play the
Huskies. It also must play The Crowd, seven
thousand screaming hoops maniacs who love
to hate their visitors from the south.
"Their crowd is worth, between 10 and 20
points," said Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer
after the game.

half, the Cardinal managed to hold on and
escape with a six-point victory over the
Cougars, 80-74.
Along with yesterday's win, the triumph
over the Huskies puts the 10-3 Cardinal in
command of the Pacific 10 Conference race.
Stanford is now all alone at the top of the
standings at 4-0, and chief rival Washington
must visit Maples Pavilion Feb. 9.
"This hurts a lot (in the conference)," Gob
recht said. "It puts an awful lot of pressure on
UB."
While there's no disputing that the win
over the Huskies was important in the confer
ence race, it may have been more important to
Stanford emotionally.
The team has taken a few knocks this sea
son after a near-perfect championship cam
paign last year. Three early losses (two more
than all of last year) and rebounding trouble
have led to some questions, as has a fluctuat
ing lineup. The Cardinal dropped out of the
top 10 for the first time since the 1988-89 sea
son.
Add this to last year's loss and the already
present rivalry with the Huskies, and Stanford
entered the game with a mission. "We wanted

it bad," said leading scorer Julie Zeilstra. "We
wanted to come back here and beat 'em. I per
sonally was not going to let our team lose."
The team and VanDerveer were quick to
mention the Cardinal's difficult schedule as a
key to their big victory. "We've played an
incredibly tough schedule, and that schedule
helped us get ready for tonight," VanDerveer
said. "Georgia, Long Beach, Texas, and Ten
nessee are all stronger teams (than Washing
ton)."
Although the final margin was close, the
much-anticipated game with the Huskies was
dominated by the Cardinal for much of the
contest. After trailing early on, Stanford went
on a 26-8 run that staked the Cardinal to 17-
point lead with 1:56 left in the first half.
Senior center Trisha Stevens keyed the
Stanford streak with 15 first-half points on an
impeccable 7 of 7 from the field. Time and
again, the Cardinal isolated Stevens one-on
one with Washington's only true post player, 6-
foot-4 Karen Deden. Once Stevens had the
ball, Deden was unable to stop the Stanford
All-American, who finished with 21 to lead all
scorers.
"She kept getting the ball," said a some
what philosophical Deden, who led the
Huskies with 19 points. "Trisha's gonna get
the ball, because that's your offense. That's
the way it's supposed to be. If I had Trisha on
my team, she would get the ball too."
The Crowd and the Huskies didn't fold,
however, and rallied to trail by just 11 at the
half. Four-and-a-half minutes into the second
half, a Sorya Henning three-pointer staked the
Cardinal to its biggest lead of the night, 51-33.
Then, slowly, the Huskies fought their way
back.
"They came out there with a press, and
made some actyustments that got them back in
it," VanDerveer said.
Tara Davis and Laura Moore answered with
three-pointers of their own. Fourteen. Three
minutes later, a six-footer by Deden makes the
deficit 10. Five straight misses at the free
throw line, four by Sor\ja Henning, and it was
nine. With four-and-a-half left, Stanford was
on top, 72-59. It would not score again until
just 24 seconds remained.
With the crowd in a frenzy, the Cardinal
seemed to realize, finally, that it could lose. A
rash of turnovers and missed free throws fol
lowed, and suddenly it seemed like last year all
over again.
Zeilstra and Henning both missed the
front-ends of one-and-ones. Washington
canned a three-pointer. The 30-second clock
runs out on the Cardinal. Husky forward

Dianne Williams made an eight-footer in the
lane. It's a four-point ballgame. Offensive foul
on Zeilstra.
Turnabout is fair play, and the Huskies
miss a free throw. Martha Richards throws up
an airball, but turns around to tie-up the ball
on the other end. Possession — Stanford. With
30 seconds left, Washington must foul, and
they go for Henning. But, in a call that is rare
except in break-away situations, the foul is
ruled intentional, giving Henning two shots
and the ball. The call is questionable — Hen
ning may have tripped.
She makes one. She is fouled again, and
this time converts one and the bonus. Game,
Stanford. A Deden three-pointer at the buzzer
meant nothing.
"We were full of rookie mistakes in the first
half, and we solved the mysteries at halftime,"
said Gobrecht. "We were getting poor shots
and hanging our heads on defense. In the sec
ond half we stopped doing that and chipped
away If we'd have done that in the first half,
we would have won the game."
The Cardinal started its big lineup, with
Stevens, Zelistra, and Val Whiting, and kept
the inside pressure on the Huskies. The result
was a 38-37 rebounding edge, which may have
been the difference in the game. Stanford is 4-
0 in games in which it outrebounds the opposi
tion. Whiting led the way with nine boards to
go with her 14 points.
Stevens played 25 minutes, despite her nag
ging tendinitis, and again paced the Cardinal
in a big game. "The thing I like about Trisha is
that she has no excuses," VanDerveer said.
"She's a clutch, big-time player, and she's a pil
lar of this program."
Last year, Stanford's loss to Washington
taught it a lesson that led eventually to a
national championship diploma. This year, it is
Washington who hopes to learn from the
game. "We became a much better team in one
basketball game, and we just have to make
sure we don't lose again. We don't want to go
down there (to Stanford) and have a repeat of
last year's [40-point loss]."
Card notes
In Pullman, the Cardinal were figured to romp
over the Cougars, who have never beaten Stanford
in 10 tries. Washington State is also missing star
player Angie Miller, 12th in the conference in scor

against Arizona State.

SEATTLE — When the Stanford women's
basketball team plays against the Washington
Huskies in Seattle, it doesn't just play the
Huskies. It also must play The Crowd, seven
thousand screaming hoops maniacs who love
to hate their visitors from the south.
"Their crowd is worth, between 10 and 20
points," said Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer
after the game.

1 Cardinal 75, Huskies 71
Cardinal 80, Cougars 74 |

Last year, a confident, undefeated Cardinal
squad sucuumbed to The Crowd and lost its
only game of the year by three points. This
year, a battle-tested Stanford team shook off
the environs and a late Washington rally to
down the No. 13-ranked Huskies on Friday,
75-71.
"The crowd did their part, we just didn't do
ours," said a chagrined Washington coach
Chris Gobrecht.
The "big win" may have lulled Stanford to
sleep for the second game of the trip against
Washington State. After leading by only one at
half, the Cardinal managed to hold on and
escape with a six-point victory over the
Cougars, 80-74.

over the Huskies puts the 10-3 Cardinal in

While there's no disputing that the win
over the Huskies was important in the confer
ence race, it may have been more important to
Stanford emotionally.
The team has taken a few knocks this sea
son after a near-perfect championship cam
paign last year. Three early losses (two more
than all of last year) and rebounding trouble
have led to some questions, as has a fluctuat
ing lineup. The Cardinal dropped out of the
top 10 for the first time since the 1988-89 sea
son.
Add this to last year's loss and the already
present rivalry with the Huskies, and Stanford
entered the game with a mission. "We wanted

it bad," said leading scorer Julie Zeilstra. "We
wanted to come back here and beat 'em. I per
sonally was not going to let our team lose."
The team and VanDerveer were quick to
mention the Cardinal's difficult schedule as a
key to their big victory. "We've played an
incredibly tough schedule, and that schedule
helped us get ready for tonight," VanDerveer
said. "Georgia, Long Beach, Texas, and Ten
nessee are all stronger teams (than Washing
ton)."
Although the final margin was close, the
much-anticipated game with the Huskies was
dominated by the Cardinal for much of the
contest. After trailing early on, Stanford went
on a 26-8 run that staked the Cardinal to 17-
point lead with 1:56 left in the first half.
Senior center Trisha Stevens keyed the
Stanford streak with 15 first-half points on an
impeccable 7 of 7 from the field. Time and
again, the Cardinal isolated Stevens one-on
one with Washington's only true post player, 6-
foot-4 Karen Deden. Once Stevens had the
ball, Deden was unable to stop the Stanford
All-American, who finished with 21 to lead all
scorers.
"She kept getting the ball," said a some
what philosophical Deden, who led the
Huskies with 19 points. "Trisha's gonna get
the ball, because that's your offense. That's
the way it's supposed to be. If I had Trisha on
my team, she would get the ball too."
The Crowd and the Huskies didn't fold,
however, and rallied to trail by just 11 at the
half. Four-and-a-half minutes into the second
half, a Sorya Henning three-pointer staked the
Cardinal to its biggest lead of the night, 51-33.
Then, slowly, the Huskies fought their way
back.
"They came out there with a press, and
made some actyustments that got them back in
it," VanDerveer said.
Tara Davis and Laura Moore answered with
three-pointers of their own. Fourteen. Three
minutes later, a six-footer by Deden makes the
deficit 10. Five straight misses at the free
throw line, four by Sor\ja Henning, and it was
nine. With four-and-a-half left, Stanford was
on top, 72-59. It would not score again until
just 24 seconds remained.
With the crowd in a frenzy, the Cardinal
seemed to realize, finally, that it could lose. A
rash of turnovers and missed free throws fol
lowed, and suddenly it seemed like last year all
over again.
Zeilstra and Henning both missed the
front-ends of one-and-ones. Washington
canned a three-pointer. The 30-second clock
runs out on the Cardinal. Husky forward

Dianne Williams made an eight-footer in the
lane. It's a four-point ballgame. Offensive foul
on Zeilstra.
Turnabout is fair play, and the Huskies
miss a free throw. Martha Richards throws up
an airball, but turns around to tie-up the ball
on the other end. Possession — Stanford. With
30 seconds left, Washington must foul, and
they go for Henning. But, in a call that is rare
except in break-away situations, the foul is
ruled intentional, giving Henning two shots
and the ball. The call is questionable — Hen
ning may have tripped.
She makes one. She is fouled again, and
this time converts one and the bonus. Game,
Stanford. A Deden three-pointer at the buzzer
meant nothing.
"We were full of rookie mistakes in the first
half, and we solved the mysteries at halftime,"
said Gobrecht. "We were getting poor shots
and hanging our heads on defense. In the sec
ond half we stopped doing that and chipped
away If we'd have done that in the first half,
we would have won the game."
The Cardinal started its big lineup, with
Stevens, Zelistra, and Val Whiting, and kept
the inside pressure on the Huskies. The result
was a 38-37 rebounding edge, which may have
been the difference in the game. Stanford is 4-
0 in games in which it outrebounds the opposi
tion. Whiting led the way with nine boards to
go with her 14 points.
Stevens played 25 minutes, despite her nag
ging tendinitis, and again paced the Cardinal
in a big game. "The thing I like about Trisha is
that she has no excuses," VanDerveer said.
"She's a clutch, big-time player, and she's a pil
lar of this program."
Last year, Stanford's loss to Washington
taught it a lesson that led eventually to a
national championship diploma. This year, it is
Washington who hopes to learn from the
game. "We became a much better team in one
basketball game, and we just have to make
sure we don't lose again. We don't want to go
down there (to Stanford) and have a repeat of
last year's [40-point loss]."
Card notes
In Pullman, the Cardinal were figured to romp
over the Cougars, who have never beaten Stanford
in 10 tries. Washington State is also missing star
player Angie Miller, 12th in the conference in scor
ing at 15.7 points per game, who injured her knee
against Arizona State.
But, as VanDerveer reiterates, the Pac-10 is
much improved, and the Cougars showed it by
