If you happened to miss Satur
day afternoon's Stanford-Wash
ington State men's basketball
game (and, judging from the
crowd, you probably did), you
missed a spectacular second-half
dunk-fest put on by the Stanford
Cardinal.

Men's Basketball

Cardinal 94
Cougars 63

There were two-handed break
away reverse dunks. One-handed,
in-your-face, cradle-it-and-throw
it-down slams. Lobs that were
jammed home with authority.
Bounce passes that got stuffed
through before the Cougars knew
where the ball was.
And, when it was all over, the
Cougars themselves had been
thoroughly slammed by the Cardi
nal, 94-63.
Stanford shot a sizzling 68 per
cent in the second half of the wipe
out (it's kind of hard to miss the
hoop when you're shooting from
six inches away), and the fire
works were more than enough to
pull away from the pesky
Cougars. Washington State was
down by only nine at the half and
14 with eight minutes to go, but
then the Cardinal went on 20-3
run to put the game away.
"When you go into a game like
this, where their strength is our
obvious weakness, it's tough to
prepare," said WSU coach Kelvin
Sampson, whose team is now 9-4,
2-2 in the Pacific 10 Conference.
"They just don't have any weak
ness inside."
The Cardinal (9-5, 2-2)
pounded away in the paint for
most of the game, as Adam Keefe
(26 points, 12 of 13 at the line),
Andrew Vlahov (12 points, a
career-high-tying 7 assists) and
Deshon Wingate (10 points, five
boards) manhandled the Cougar
frontcourt. The sore-ankled Vla
hov, whose family was visiting
from Perth, Australia, had eight
of Stanford's first 15 point* and
made pass after beautiful pass
throughout the game.
"I hope [the media] appreciates
what Vlahov means to this team,"
Stanford coach Mike Montgomary
said afterward. "He did such a
great job defensively, going after
loose balls, getting on the floor. ...
It's just incredible. He makes such
a difference for us."
Vlahov & Co.'s banging kept
the Cougars in foul trouble for

most of the second half: WSU cen
ter Brian Paine fouled out trying
to guard Keefe, and forwards Ken
Critton and Rob Corkrum each
ended up with four personals.
Swingman Terrence Lewis also
fouled out.
The Cougar hacking (what else
could they do?) put Stanford on
the foul line about once every
other minute, where the Cardinal
converted a nearly unheard-of 28
of 33 shots. The Cougars were
only 7 for 10 (a paltry 1 for 2 after
intermission).
Regular WSU starters Neil
Derrick (17.9 ppg) and Bennie
Seltzer (12.4 ppg) began the game
on the bench for violating a team
rule, and Vlahov hit three layups
and a short jumper to put the Car
dinal ahead 15-6 after seven min
utes. Derrick and Seltzer then
made their entrance, but it didn't
make much of a difference:
Seltzer had three turnovers in
only five first-half minutes, and
Stanford's John Patrick and
Kenny Ammann handcuffed Der
rick before the half, holding him
to just four points. (He ended up
with 13, most of them in garbage
time.)
"On defense, our guards did a
great job on theirs," Keefe said.
They were fine on offense as well,
as Patrick's 10 first-half points
(including two threes on feeds
from Marcus Lollie) led all scor
ers. Lollie racked up a career-high
eight assists and kept the Cougar
point guards completely silent.
"I thought the thing that set
the tone, again, was our defensive
effort," Montgomery said. "Their
wing players can shoot and they
have a lot of quickness out there.
It was our defense that keyed it
for us."
Even with the Cougar guards
not doing anything worthwhile —
Wingate had Lewis completely
shut down throughout the game
— the Cardinal was only up nine
at the half. Stanford ate WSU's
man-to-man for lunch at the start,
going up 21-8, but then the
Cougars shifted to a "sometimes
it's a 2-3, sometimes it's not"
zone, and the two teams played
even for the rest of the half.
"In the first half, it seemed like
we were looking, looking, looking
before making a pass," said Keefe,
who was 1 for 4 in the first. "Then
in the second we found the first
open man and made the quick
pass."
That might have been because
the Cougars, after getting crushed
playing man and then staying
even with the zone, went back (of
