Chalk it up for experience.
That's what the men's swimming
team did this weekend in Austin
after losing to No. 1-ranked
Texas, 129-107. Racing against
the defending national champion
in the first in-season dual meet
showed Cardinal coaches and
swimmers what they need to do to
have a successful season.
M We need to be a lot more
intense in dual meets," said coacl
Skip Kenney, "The guys need to
work hard AND swim fast. The
talent is there but the guys are
only as good as the way they swim
in races."
From the beginning the team
was down 26-7 because two of the
three divers were injured. Brad
Wightman was the only Cardinal
diver competing against three
Texas divers, one of whom was an
NCAA finalist last year.
Although Stanford won several
races, they didn't get enough
points on the board in the end.
The Cardinal won the 200-yard
medley relay while Tyler Mayfield
and Matt Rodgers took first and
second place in the 200 breast
stroke.
Mayfleld and the other fresh
men made a great debut at their
first dual competition. Derek
Weatherford won the 200 back
stroke with a time that made him
the meet's only qualifyer for the
NCAA Championships. He also
placed second in the 200 individ
ual medley.
"I swam fairly well, I was really
happy about the backstroke but a
bit frustrated with the individual
medley," said Weatherford. "As a
freshman class we were really
anxious to see how we would fend
up against the No. 1 team in the
nation."
Kenney noted the medley relay
and 200 backstroke as being high
lights with many mediocre races
in between. "We're just not as
good as Texas," said Kenney. "The
intensity needs to improve _ we've
trained well but now the season

has started and we need to turn it
up a notch.
"If we're going to stand around
until NCAAs, it just won't hap
pen. The guys have to make up
their minds to be world champion
athletes, to come to the pool, work
hard and race hard."
Kenney wasn't overly
impressed with the Longhorn's
performance. "I didn't see any
thing at Texas that was scary or
exciting. They had a pretty good
meet. We didn't match up with
them, I guess that's why they're
No. 1 and we're No. 3."
The Cardinal will have a
chance to regain some momentum
Friday when they host No. 4-
ranked Michigan. The Cardinal is
0-4 in dual meets with the Ann
Arbor powerhouse but has
defeated them at the NCAA meet.
"We'll definitely need to race at
a higher level against Michigan,"
said Kenney. Three Wolverine
swimmers, including Mike Bar
rowman, a world record-holder in
breaststroke and, Eric Namesnik,
a national record-holder in the
IM, are down in Australia at the
World Championships but will be
back in time to challenge the
Stanford squad.
Luckily, the Cardinal will have
its own hot shots back too. This
weekend, Jeff Rouse won the 100-
meter backstroke and was the
first leg on the winning 400-meter
medley relay for the United
States at that meet. His absence,
along with that of teammate
Eddie Parenti, may have made a
difference in Stanford's dual meet
at Texas.
"We were really affected in
freestyle where Eddie would have
helped," said Rodgers. "They did
well in freestyle and we didn't."
However, Kenney said, "Two
guys wouldn't have made the dif
ference; we just didn't turn it up a
notch."
"We have a young team with a
lot of potential," said Weather
ford. "We're going to keep training
hard and then give everyone a run
for their money."
