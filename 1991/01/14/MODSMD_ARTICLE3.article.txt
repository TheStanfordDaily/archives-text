## Scholars discuss role of oil, Palestinian linkage

Opinions among Stanford scholars on U.S. objec
tives in the Persian Gulf reflect a variety of views,
but there is agreement on other issues such as the
role of Congress and linkage between the crisis and
the Palestinian issue.

Bueno de Mesquita said he had expected the vote to

polled Congress before asking for a vote, and, confi

of Saudi petroleum had been "much exaggerated,"
according to Williamson Evers, a visiting scholar at
the Hoover Institution.
"Saddam cannot dictate the price of oil over the

Henderson, a scholar at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate
School in Monterey, which claims that Saddam's
control of a significant portion of Middle East oil
would boost the price by at most 24 cents a gallon
over a long period of time.
Oil itself may not be worth defending with Amer

relies to heat homes, fuel farm equipment and run
factories, maintaining a stable price and steady sup
