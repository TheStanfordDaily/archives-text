## Scholars discuss role of oil, Palestinian linkage 
### Jason Bloomstein Senior staff writer 
Opinions among Stanford scholars on U.S. objec
tives in the Persian Gulf reflect a variety of views,
but there is agreement on other issues such as the
role of Congress and linkage between the crisis and
the Palestinian issue.
Congress' Saturday vote to support the use of
force was perhaps one of the least disputed issues in
the Iraqi crisis because many had anticipated it for a
long time. Hoover Institution senior fellow Bruce
Bueno de Mesquita said he had expected the vote to
pass in both houses of Congress. The President
polled Congress before asking for a vote, and, confi
dent his resolution would pass, called for a vote last
weekend to shore up declining public support, Bueno
de Mesquita said.
Though Bush won a thin victory in the Senate,
the president will probably consider the 52-47 vote
as a mandate for war, said History Assoc. Prof. Joel
Beinin. "But once the hostilities begin and if they are
not over quickly, Congress belatedly and ineffectively

reflects the possibility of a strong opposition move
ment," he said.
While the goal of preventing Saddam Hussein
from manipulating the price of oil has been a leading
concern of administration officials, the potential
effect of Hussein's control of Kuwaiti and potentially
of Saudi petroleum had been "much exaggerated,"
according to Williamson Evers, a visiting scholar at
the Hoover Institution.
"Saddam cannot dictate the price of oil over the
long run,"he said, citing a recent study by David
Henderson, a scholar at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate
School in Monterey, which claims that Saddam's
control of a significant portion of Middle East oil
would boost the price by at most 24 cents a gallon
over a long period of time.
Oil itself may not be worth defending with Amer
ican lives, but as a commodity on which the world
relies to heat homes, fuel farm equipment and run
factories, maintaining a stable price and steady sup
ply directly preserves the livelihood of "millions and
billions of people," Bueno de
Mesquita argued.
Even if Henderson's theory
proves correct and the price of oil
climbs 24 cents a gallon, Bueno de
Mesquita calculated that when
multiplied by the number of gal
lons used per year all over the
world, the world economy would
lose $500 to $600 billion that
could otherwise be used to allevi
ate poverty and starvation.
The United States may have
other ulterior motives for pre
venting Saddam's control of a
large share of Middle Eastern
petroleum, according to Beinin,
who specializes in Middle Eastern
history. He argued that those who
control the price of oil are less
important to the United States
than those who decide where the
profits are invested.
Currently, the Saudis and
Kuwaitis return much of their oil
profits to Western markets in the
form of investments, but Saddam
may infuse his newly acquired
wealth back into the economies of
the Middle East, a process Beinin
says is bound to occur in the
future anyway.
Beinin also argued that the
U.S. military buildup in the Per
sian Gulf does not further the
cause of the two main images of
America's global role. The geo
economic strategy, in which the
United States is involved in
recapturing lost markets after the
Cold War, is hampered by a build
up in the military-industrial com
plex, which hinders economic
growth, he said.
President Bush's geostrategic
strategy — under which the
United States still needs massive
military capability to quell hostil
ities among regional powers — is

flawed because "America cannot
be number one," he said. "The
United States doesn't have the
capacity to restrain regional pow
ers, nor is it in its real interest."
Suggestions by Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein that there be a
linkage between the Iraqi-
Kuwaiti crisis and other regional
disputes — mainly the Israeli-
Palestinian controversy — have
been opposed by the President.
However, there is a consensus
among these Stanford scholars
that the United States, by the
nature of its widespread influence
in the Middle East and involve
ment in the crisis with Iraq, in
itself provides a link among the
various disputes in the region.
"I don't necessarily favor U.S.
attempts to try and solve the
problems, some of which go back
for centuries," Evers said, "but
linkage is caused by American
policy trying to influence all sorts
of different controversies."
Bueno de Mesquita's sug
gested solution to the linkage of
the Iraqi-Kuwaiti and Israeli-
Palestinian disputes would be to
introduce a third issue, such as an
agreement of inspections of Iraqi
nuclear facilities in exchange for a
Middle East peace conference.
This would allow Saddam to save
face by achieving a conference
and allowing Bush to avoid direct
linkage between Kuwait and the
Palestinians.

Saddam Hussein that there be a
linkage between the Iraqi-
Kuwaiti crisis and other regional
disputes — mainly the Israeli-
Palestinian controversy — have
been opposed by the President.
However, there is a consensus
among these Stanford scholars
that the United States, by the
nature of its widespread influence
in the Middle East and involve
ment in the crisis with Iraq, in
itself provides a link among the
various disputes in the region.
"I don't necessarily favor U.S.
attempts to try and solve the
problems, some of which go back
for centuries," Evers said, "but
linkage is caused by American
policy trying to influence all sorts
of different controversies."
Bueno de Mesquita's sug
gested solution to the linkage of
the Iraqi-Kuwaiti and Israeli-
Palestinian disputes would be to
introduce a third issue, such as an
agreement of inspections of Iraqi
nuclear facilities in exchange for a
Middle East peace conference.
This would allow Saddam to save
face by achieving a conference
and allowing Bush to avoid direct
linkage between Kuwait and the
Palestinians.
