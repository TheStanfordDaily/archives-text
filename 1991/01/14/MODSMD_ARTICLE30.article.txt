# Women sink Michigan at deGuerre
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
While Janet Evans and Sum
mer Sanders were winning gold
medals at the World Champi
onships, their teammates on the
Stanford women's swimming
squad were putting on quite a
show themselves.
The second-ranked Cardinal
had its first home meet of the
season Saturday at deGuerre
Ftool and improved its record to
3-0 with a 222-78 victory over
No. 6 Michigan.
In Perth, Australia, Evans
won the 800-meter freestyle Sat
urday for her third medal, and
second gold of the World Cham
pionships. Sanders completed
her collection by adding a gold in
the 200-meter butterfly to the
silver and bronze medals she had
won earlier.
Stanford won 16 of 16 events
and Ave different athletes
notched a pair of victories each
to give the Cardinal the victory.
"I think we had really good
swims considering we're coming
off Christmas training," senior
co-captain Suzy Buckovich said.
"I think people swam faster than
they thought they would."
The Cardinal 200-yard med
ley relay team of Dede Trimble,
Lori Heisick, Janel Jorgensen
and Michelle Griglione opened
the meet with a three-second
victory before the Wolverines'
Karen Barnes edged Stanford
freshman Sionainn Marcoux in
the 1,650 freestyle. But that
would be Michigan's sole victory.
Pam Minthorn, Karen Krae
mer and Barb Metz swept the
next event, the 200 freestyle,
and Stanford didn't look back.
Minthorn, a freshman from
Darnestown, Md., also won the
500 freestyle and posted NCAA
qualifying times in both events.
Minthorn qualified in the 200
butterfly with the top time in
the nation in a meet last week.

Stanford recorded three other
qualifying times for the national
meet when Griglione and Jor
gensen took the top two spots in
the 200 butterfly and Jorgensen
edged Buckovich in the 100 but
terfly.
The NCAA qualifying times
were especially sweet for Jor
gensen, who probably would
have made the World Champi
onships team but for a bout with
mononucleosis this past sum
mer. "I was pretty happy with
how it went," she said. "It's
always nice to have the cuts out
of the way It takes the pressure

off the rest of the season."
Jorgensen was a triple NCAA
champion as a freshman last
year and, despite the fact that
it's taken several months to get
her strength completely back,
she hopes to fare as well this
year.
"At the begining of the season
I came to realize that I couldn't
train the way I did last season,"
she said. "I decided to do what I
could and make the best of it. If
the team did 8,000 yards, maybe
I'd do 4,000. I concentrated on
the little things more. I think
that will help me in the future."

Griglione also won the 200
individual medley, Buckovich
took the 60 and 100 freestlyes
and Heisick captured the 100
and 200 breaststrokes to join
Minthorn as double winners in
the pool. Junior diver Melisa
Kuller also had a very successful
afternoon, winning both the
one- and three-meter competi
tions. Classmate Kristin Jensen
placed second on one-meter and
third on three-meter despite the
fact that Michigan has a reputa-

tion as being a diving power.
"I was pretty happy with it,"
Kuller said. "I was pretty pleased
with today. I think I'm farther
along this year (than last year)."
Jody Smith, Minthorn, Krae
mer and Buckovich closed the
meet with an easy win in the 400
freestyle relay. Before that, Smith
triumphed in the 100 backstroke
and Trimble won the 200 back
stroke. Stanford is now 17-0 in
dual meets during the two-plus
years that Richard Quick has
been the coach.
Quick, though, wasn't present
Saturday as he is the U.S. coach at
the World Championships. But
assistant coach Mike Chasson
took over the reigns and had the
Cardinal ready to go. "Since
Richard's been gone, he's really
taken over the leadership of our
team as a head coach," Buckovich
said. "He does a lot for this team."
Chasson has been most
involved with coaching the
breaststrokers, and they excelled.
In addition to the pair of wins by
Heisick, freshman Laurie Gan
drud, like Heisick a Minnesota
native, placed second in both.
Susan Johnson and J.T. Toton
completed the Stanford sweeps in
the 100 and 200, respectively.

silver and bronze medals she had
won earlier.
Stanford won 16 of 16 events
and Ave different athletes
notched a pair of victories each
to give the Cardinal the victory.
"I think we had really good
swims considering we're coming
off Christmas training," senior
co-captain Suzy Buckovich said.
"I think people swam faster than
they thought they would."
The Cardinal 200-yard med
ley relay team of Dede Trimble,
Lori Heisick, Janel Jorgensen
and Michelle Griglione opened
the meet with a three-second
victory before the Wolverines'
Karen Barnes edged Stanford
freshman Sionainn Marcoux in
the 1,650 freestyle. But that
would be Michigan's sole victory.
Pam Minthorn, Karen Krae
mer and Barb Metz swept the
next event, the 200 freestyle,
and Stanford didn't look back.
Minthorn, a freshman from
Darnestown, Md., also won the
500 freestyle and posted NCAA
qualifying times in both events.
Minthorn qualified in the 200
butterfly with the top time in
the nation in a meet last week.

Stanford recorded three other
qualifying times for the national
meet when Griglione and Jor
gensen took the top two spots in
the 200 butterfly and Jorgensen
edged Buckovich in the 100 but
terfly.
The NCAA qualifying times
were especially sweet for Jor
gensen, who probably would
have made the World Champi
onships team but for a bout with
mononucleosis this past sum
mer. "I was pretty happy with
how it went," she said. "It's
always nice to have the cuts out
of the way It takes the pressure

off the rest of the season."
Jorgensen was a triple NCAA
champion as a freshman last
year and, despite the fact that
it's taken several months to get
her strength completely back,
she hopes to fare as well this
year.
"At the begining of the season
I came to realize that I couldn't
train the way I did last season,"
she said. "I decided to do what I
could and make the best of it. If
the team did 8,000 yards, maybe
I'd do 4,000. I concentrated on
the little things more. I think
that will help me in the future."

Griglione also won the 200
individual medley, Buckovich
took the 60 and 100 freestlyes
and Heisick captured the 100
and 200 breaststrokes to join
Minthorn as double winners in
the pool. Junior diver Melisa
Kuller also had a very successful
afternoon, winning both the

"I was pretty happy with it,"
Kuller said. "I was pretty pleased
with today. I think I'm farther
along this year (than last year)."
Jody Smith, Minthorn, Krae
mer and Buckovich closed the
meet with an easy win in the 400
freestyle relay. Before that, Smith
triumphed in the 100 backstroke
and Trimble won the 200 back
stroke. Stanford is now 17-0 in
dual meets during the two-plus
years that Richard Quick has
been the coach.
Quick, though, wasn't present
Saturday as he is the U.S. coach at
the World Championships. But
assistant coach Mike Chasson
took over the reigns and had the
Cardinal ready to go. "Since
Richard's been gone, he's really
taken over the leadership of our
team as a head coach," Buckovich
said. "He does a lot for this team."
Chasson has been most
involved with coaching the
breaststrokers, and they excelled.
In addition to the pair of wins by
Heisick, freshman Laurie Gan
drud, like Heisick a Minnesota
native, placed second in both.
Susan Johnson and J.T. Toton
completed the Stanford sweeps in
the 100 and 200, respectively.
