# Card spikers take second
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Going into the UC-Santa
Barbara/Michelob Light Invita
tional last week, the Stanford
men's volleyball team was
looked at as a team in transi
tion. After losing three starters
to graduation, a rebuilding year
was expected and the squad was
ranked only sixth nationally.
But after playing eight
matches in about 35 hours, and
winning six, the Cardinal's
opponents have discovered that
tomorrow has come and that
the rebuilding has happened.
Stanford posted wins over
seventh-ranked UCSB and
third-ranked Long Beach State
to reach the final of the tourna
ment before bowing to consen
sus No. 1 USC. In his first mqjor
competition, first-year coach
Ruben Nieves juggled the start
ing lineup constantly to try out
various combinations, but
almost everything worked both
Friday and Saturday in Santa
Barbara.
"They played great," said
assistant coach John Kosty of
the Cardinal. "They played con
sistent and steady all tourna

ment long. It was a strong tour
nament for the program. We
gained a lot of confidence
throught the tournament with
our playing and the consistency
of our playing."
Stanford opened play Friday
with wins over Cal Poly-Pomona
(15-6, 15-6), UC-Santa Cruz
(15-9, 15-1) and British
Columbia (15-7, 15-10).
Later Friday the Cardinal
topped York 15-10,15-8 and No.
7 UC-Santa Barbara 15-8, 16-
14. Saturday the Cardinal was
upset by Brigham Young 11-15,
15-7, 16-14 but rebounded to
beat third-ranked Long Beach
State 15-12, 8-15, 15-12.
The Cardinal advanced to
play defending NCAA champ
USC in the championship
match. Against the tourna
ment's only undefeated team,
Stanford fell 15-4, 15-3, 15-3.
The Trojans returned every
player from the team that won
the national crown last year.
"I think [the score is] more of
a reflection on how good SC was
on Saturday night," middle
blocker John Bezmalinovic said.
"We didn't play a poor match;
just no one on our team had an
incredible match, which you

have to have against a team like
that."
The Trojans out-hit Stanford
.545-.205 and out-dug the Car
dinal 35-17. Four of the five
USC hitters had between 10 and
15 kills and the fifth, freshman
Pat Ivie, had nine and an .818
hitting percentage. Pat's older
brother, Bryan, had 15 kills for
USC and was named the tour
nament's MVP
Dave Goss led the Cardinal
with 14 kills while Bezmalinovic
and Mike Lowe had six kills and
three blocks each. Stanford
junior Duncan Blackman was
named to the all-tournament
team.
Despite the abrupt ending,
the tournament gave the play
ers and coaches a lot of confi
dence going into the league
opener Friday night against
Loyola Maiymount at Burnham
Pavilion. "One of my personal
goals for the team for this tour
nament was to prove that we are
a force to be reckoned with,"
Bezmalinovic said. "Not that
we're a young team, not that
we'll be good in two years, but
that we'll beat some teams. I
think we showed that to a lot of
teams."
