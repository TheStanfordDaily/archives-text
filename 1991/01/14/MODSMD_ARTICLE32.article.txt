# Yarbrough wins tournament
## 
### Michelle Ghert Staff writer 
Suffering from a long list of
injuries, the Cardinal wrestling
team took eighth place at the
Aggie Invitational Tournament
held at UC-Davis Saturday.
Despite the disappointing finish,
Stanford posted some impressive
individual performances.
The 12-team tournament was
won by the Air Force Academy
this year, but has been dominated
by Stanford in the past. The Car
dinal has taken home the champi
onship three out the the past four
years. This weekend, Stanford
sent a partial team composed of
senior Steve Yarbrough and fresh
man Jay Jackson, as well as six
second-teamers.
In the 177-pound class,
Yarbrough claimed his second
tournament title in a row by win
ning three straight matches and
defeating Robert Downey of the
Air Force Academy 9-2 in the
finals. Jackson took fourth in the
126-pound class.
"I felt pretty good at the tour
nament," Yarbrough said. "Last
week's loss to Oregon State was
very disappointing and it was nice
to do well coming off that loss."
"I'm pleased that our two
starters did well," coach Chris
Horpel said. "The other six ath

letes were the few that were still
healthy and they entered the tour
nament mainly for collegiate expe
rience."
Four out of the six second
teamera came within one victory
of placing in the top four. New
team member Scott Whitt, who is
a redshirt freshman on the foot
ball team, wrestled in the heavy
weight division and finished 2-2
on the day. The other Cardinal
wrestlers registering wins but
missing a top-four placing were
senior Jerome Farmer in the 160-
pound class, sophomore Bob
Becker in thelsB-pound class and
sophomore Chris Carlsten in the
177-pound class.
"It was nice for them to get a
chance to see collegiate competi
tion," Yarbrough said. "The expe
rience will help them to con
tribute to the team next year."
Despite the low team placing,
Horpel is confident that Stan
ford's first team could have won
the tournament. Yarbrough
agrees.
"It's unfortunate that we
didn't have our strongest team,"
Yarbrough said. "We could have
beaten them (the Air Force
Academy)."
The injury-laden lineup
includes starters Steve Buddie
who is suffering from bersitis in
one elbow, junior Mark Graham

who has been out of competition
due to a sprained ankle, junior
Dave Sacks who is resting a pulled
sternum, freshman Lance John
son who has a pinched nerve in his
neck, and junior Matt Topham
who is suffering from an injured
rotator cuff in nis shoulder. Hor
pel attributes the onslaught of
injuries to the team's intense
competition schedule.
"We've had a very difficult com
petiton schedule so far this sea
son," Horpel said. "We've had too
many matches too close together
and didn't have enough time to
recouperate between tourna
ments."
Following a very intense tour
nament at Florida Dec. 29-30 in
which the wrestlers competed in
five to six matches per day, the
Cardinal squad had only a few
days of practice before an equally
large tournament at Chico State.
Fatigue set in and injuries
resulted.
The Stanford team hopes to
have all its starters back in action
for this week's dual meets against
Fresno State on Wednesday (at
Burnham 7:30 p.m.), and UC-
Davis on Saturday.
"Fresno is a tough team in the
top 20," Horpel said. "If our team
is healthy, it should be a good
meet."
