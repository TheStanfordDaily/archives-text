# National student group opposes war initiative
## 
### David Bianco Editorial staff 
For weeks, student leaders
have been debating whether the
ASSU Senate should have the
right to pass a bill opposing U.S.
policy in the Persian Gulf.
Now, on a Bay Area visit, the
board of the United States Stu
dent Association — an organiza
tion of student governments to
which the ASSU belongs — has
passed a resolution even stronger
than the Nov. 14 ASSU bill oppos
ing an unprovoked non-U. N.-
sponsored Gulf military offensive.
Meeting in San Francisco for
their quarterly board meeting, the
association voted 19-8 Saturday
night to "condemn the actions of
the United States government."
According to George McKinney,
one of three Stanford students
who attended the meeting, the
resolution took a "student's per
spective" on Persian Gulfpolicy.
The United States Student
Association is a Washington-based
student lobbying organization
that represents more than 300
student associations nationwide
comprising at least 3 million stu
dents.
McKinney, a sophomore who

recently resigned as deputy chair
of the ASSU Senate, said the bill
mentioned the fact that students
are already serving in the Gulf,
that the expected loss of life in a
war is greater than that of the
Vietnam War and that money for
education is constantly being cut.
The resolution goes on to
denounce the U.S. government
"for its offensive position" and to
demand that "President Bush
reconsider his stance on this most
explosive issue."
The bill also decries the letter
Bush wrote last week to college
students asking for their support.
The President's letter ran Friday
in The Daily.
Finally, the bill condemns "the
use of the draft, which over
whelmingly negatively impacts
upon lower economic classes."
According to Valerie Mih, a
junior who attended the meeting
as an observer, the board was
unanimously opposed to a Gulf
war. "I think that everyone
wanted to pass a resolution," she
said. "I don't think anyone was in
favor of war."
McKinney said the resolution
was originally even stronger. "We
had to tone it down," he said,
adding that some of those who

voted against the bill thought it
had been toned down too much
during the hour-long debate.
The resolution was sent to
Bush, Secretary of State James
Baker, Secretary General of the
United Nations Javier Perez de
Cuellar and every member of
Congress.
"Because of the status of [the
national students' association], I
think a lot of people will take note,
especially [the members of
Congress] we've been working
with," McKinney said.
But some students are skepti
cal about the association and its
ability to accurately reflect stu
dent opinion.
John Overdeck, an ASSU grad
uate senator, objected to the asso
ciation's resolution, particularly
to the wording concerning the
effect of a draft upon students
from lower economic classes.
"I don't understand how the
draft affects people in lower
socioeconomic groups," he said.
"It seems that the new draft,
which doesn't have student defer
ments, doesn't do that. I think
that if there is a student issue,
then the student issue involved is
deferment for students. And here
they are opposed to that.

"It sounds to me like they are
not taking a student position, but
they are representing their own
personal agendas."
Overdeck said that association
members are selected in an
undemocratic fashion, by current
members choosing their succes
sors. He said the association does
not have "a democratic mandate."
He also said many graduate
students he has spoken to have
"very pro-war sentiments," and
charged: "If the government is lis
tening to the [students' associa
tion], it sounds like that's a mis
take. I don't think we have any
basis to take the [association] as
representative of national student
opinion."
Andrew Zimmerman, another
graduate senator, objected to the
association taking a stand at all.
"I personally feel that the [organi
zation] should not be getting
involved in that issue," he said.
"Personally I feel that all of these
student organizations should
leave each student to his or her
individual opinion on the matter."
Along with McKinney and Mih,
ASSU senator Naomi Onaga, a
senior, attended the meeting and
joined McKinney in voting for the
resolution.
