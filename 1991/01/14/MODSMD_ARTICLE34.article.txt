## 
### Tom Cramer 
Can there really be peace in the
Middle East? The answer is yes, if
a two-day international simula
tion by residents of Madera was
realistic.
The mock peace conference,
which took place this weekend,
was designed to stimulate discus
sion about the issue in an innova
tive way Students played the
roles of delegates from the United
States, Europe, Israel, Iraq and
other Arab nations in order to.
search for a peaceful compromise
to the current crisis.
The summit was presided over
by senior Joey Feldman and grad
uate student Ira Lit, the two
Madera resident assistants who
organized the meeting.
The delegates assumed names
typical of the countries they rep
resented, donned appropriate
clothing, adopted the positions of
their nations and convened in the

"Great Lounge of Compromise" of
the "Madera Peace Summit," fit
tingly situated in Madera,
Switzerland.
In three different one-hour ses
sions spread over two days, the 17
participants met, discussed and
often shouted before an audience
which ranged from nine to 15, all
in the name of role play
"We wanted [Madera residents]
to sit down and think seriously
about what they felt about these
issues, and we wanted to do it in a
way other than just sitting every
body down in a big circle and talk
ing about it," said Lit, who played
"Javier de Litwinsky, General Sec
retary"
Feldman, who presided over
the meeting and played the role of
"Mahatma Feldman, Peace Seeker
at Large," said, "[Lit] had done
some crisis scenarios before, and
we thought this would be the way
of making it most accessible to
everyone."

One highlight of the conference
came when the three Israeli dele
gates walked out, refusing to dis
cuss Palestine.
The original Iraqi six-point res
olution included issues ranging
from withdrawal from Kuwait to
U.N.-mediated talks over oil fields
and reparations to immediate
talks over the Palestinian ques
tion.
After much debate, and with
only ten minutes left before the
end of the conference, the resolu
tion was put to vote and failed.
Then Iraq made two further con
cessions, striking the Palestinian
question from the proposal and
submitting ownership of an oil

field to U.N. mediation.
The resolution passed in the
closing minutes of the final ses
sion.
Lit admitted that the summit
was "out of the bounds of reality."
John "Helmut" Girard, a
freshman, was one of the repre
sentatives of the European Com
munity. He echoed Feldman, say
ing, "It really seemed like we were
involved in something big. And
even today when everybody voted
"yes" on the final peace proposal
there really was an exciting feel
ing about that, as if we accom
plished something."
Still, Girard admitted the ficti
tiousness of their scenario.
