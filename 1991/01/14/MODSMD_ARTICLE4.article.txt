## 
### Miranda Doyle Staff writer 
Despite efforts by members of
local groups to change his mind,
Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Stanford,
voted Saturday to allow the Presi
dent to use American armed
forces against Iraq if its troops do
not leave Kuwait by tomorrow
"We had about 50 people at
Campbell's office in Sunnyvale
Friday," said Paul George, direc
tor of the Peninsula Peace Center
in Palo Alto. "They got him on the
phone and about 12 people gave
him reasons against voting for
war."

Those who talked to Campbell
represented Stanford Students for
Peace, the San Jose Peace Center,
a San Francisco State student
group and other organizations
from the area.
However, Campbell told them
he had decided to vote for the res
olution authorizing force, which
passed in both the House of Rep
resentatives and the Senate Sat
urday. He also voted against the
resolution to give sanctions time
to work.
"Obviously, we are very disap
pointed," said George. "It was a
very serious mistake on the part
of the U.S. Congress. This points

to a need to redouble our efforts."
Graduate student Kate Morris
spoke to Campbell on behalf of the
Stanford Students for Peace. "I
said that most students want
peace and we are part of his con
stituency," she said.
The Peninsula Peace Center
also held a large anti-war march
Saturday in Palo Alto. "That's at
least 2,000 people who will
remember this vote come election
day," George said.
In a written statement to the
press, Campbell said the decision
to vote for the authorization of
force was the most difficult he has
ever had to make. However, he
said he feels it was the correct
choice.
"For me, the most compelling
aspect of the Gulf crisis has been
Saddam Hussein's possession of
chemical and biological weapons,"
Campbell wrote. "And, even more
chilling, experts estimate Iraq will
have nuclear weapons in one to
five years."
Campbell cited an Amnesty
International report documenting
Iraq's human rights abuses in
Kuwait as one reason for his vote.
George said experts have esti
mated that civilian casualties
would reach 100,000 if the United
States launched an air strike
against Iraq. "That is 100,000
human rights abuses," he said.
Campbell said he did not feel
the international coalition oppos
ing Iraq can hold together long
enough for sanctions to work. He
also said waiting would not elimi
nate Saddam's weapons. "He
must be stopped, now, by the civi
lized world," he added.
Republican John Seymour, Cal
ifornia's new senator, also voted
for the resolution to allow force.
Senator Alan Cranston, a Demo
crat, is undergoing cancer treat
ment and was not present for the
vote.
