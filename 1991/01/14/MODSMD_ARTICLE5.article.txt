# University may retreat on costs
## Kennedy: Charging embarrassing items not worth public confusion 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
When revelations surfaced in
the press last month that the Uni
versity had been billing flower
arrangements to the federal gov
ernment as an indirect cost of
research, Stanford officials were
embarrassed but contended the
practice was perfectly legal under
government rules.
They still do, but they are now
giving serious thought to elimi
nating such controversial low-cost
items from Stanford's cost-recov
ery claims, University President
Donald Kennedy said in an hour
long interview Friday.
"If there are expenses that are
easily subject to public misunder
standing, I'd rather get rid of
them than take the risk that we'll
lose some of the public support
that we so badly need to func
tion," Kennedy said, striking a
more conciliatory chord than in
past discussions on the issue.
Kennedy declined to specify
which costs the University might
eliminate, but said "anything that
smacks of entertainment" would
be examined "especially care
fully."
Stanford's indirect cost recov
ery practices are currently under
investigation by three federal
agencies — the Office of Naval
Research, the General Accounting
Office, and the House Subcom
mittee on Oversight and Investi
gations. The subcommittee,
chaired by Rep. John Dingell, D-
Mich.,«is expected to hold hearingß
on Stanford's indirect eo«t recov
ery practices in late February or
early March.
If the University begins elimi
nating some expenses from its
cost-recovery claims, the move is

likely to be
viewed by many
as a concession to
congressional in
vestigators, who
have been relent
less in their eff
orts to embarrass
the University in
the last few
months.

During finals week last quar
ter, both the Los Angeles Times
and the San Jose Mercury News
reported that Stanford had billed
the government $3,000 for a
cedar-lined chest, $2,500 to refur
bish a piano and up to $2,000 a
month for flower arrangements at
the Lou Henry Hoover House, the
residence of Kennedy and his fam
ily.
The revelations, leaked by
staffers on the Dingell subcom
mittee, followed closely on the
heels of another embarrassing dis
closure — for several years Stan
ford had billed the government for
depreciation on the Victoria, a 72-
foot yacht owned by Stanford, as
an indirect cost of research.
While the depreciation on the
yacht was clearly a violation of
government rules, the same can
not be said of the chest, piano and
flowers in Hoover House. Because
the president's residence also
serves as the site of several
research-related conferences and
briefings, the government allows
Stanford to claim a fraction —
about one-fifth — of Hoover
House's operating costs as an
indirect cost of doing research.
Both the revelation about the
yacht and those about Hoover
House have offered valuable
lessons to the University,
