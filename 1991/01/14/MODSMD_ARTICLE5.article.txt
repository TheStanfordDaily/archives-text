# University may retreat on costs
## Kennedy: Charging embarrassing items not worth public confusion 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
When revelations surfaced in
the press last month that the Uni
versity had been billing flower
arrangements to the federal gov
ernment as an indirect cost of
research, Stanford officials were
embarrassed but contended the
practice was perfectly legal under
government rules.
They still do, but they are now
giving serious thought to elimi
nating such controversial low-cost
items from Stanford's cost-recov
ery claims, University President
Donald Kennedy said in an hour
long interview Friday.
"If there are expenses that are
easily subject to public misunder
standing, I'd rather get rid of
them than take the risk that we'll
lose some of the public support
that we so badly need to func
tion," Kennedy said, striking a
more conciliatory chord than in
past discussions on the issue.
Kennedy declined to specify
which costs the University might
eliminate, but said "anything that
smacks of entertainment" would
be examined "especially care
fully."
Stanford's indirect cost recov
ery practices are currently under
investigation by three federal
agencies — the Office of Naval
Research, the General Accounting
Office, and the House Subcom
mittee on Oversight and Investi
gations. The subcommittee,
chaired by Rep. John Dingell, D-
Mich.,«is expected to hold hearingß
on Stanford's indirect eo«t recov
ery practices in late February or
early March.
If the University begins elimi
nating some expenses from its
cost-recovery claims, the move is

likely to be
viewed by many
as a concession to
congressional in
vestigators, who
have been relent
less in their eff
orts to embarrass
the University in
the last few
months.

During finals week last quar
ter, both the Los Angeles Times
and the San Jose Mercury News
reported that Stanford had billed
the government $3,000 for a
cedar-lined chest, $2,500 to refur
bish a piano and up to $2,000 a
month for flower arrangements at
the Lou Henry Hoover House, the
residence of Kennedy and his fam
ily.
The revelations, leaked by
staffers on the Dingell subcom
mittee, followed closely on the
heels of another embarrassing dis
closure — for several years Stan
ford had billed the government for
depreciation on the Victoria, a 72-
foot yacht owned by Stanford, as
an indirect cost of research.
While the depreciation on the
yacht was clearly a violation of
government rules, the same can
not be said of the chest, piano and
flowers in Hoover House. Because
the president's residence also
serves as the site of several
research-related conferences and
briefings, the government allows
Stanford to claim a fraction —
about one-fifth — of Hoover
House's operating costs as an
indirect cost of doing research.
Both the revelation about the
yacht and those about Hoover
House have offered valuable
lessons to the University,

Kennedy
Kennedy said Friday. "We're seri
ous about trying to learn from
what is happening to us," he said.
The oversight on the yacht has
forced University officials to take
a closer look at their accounting
system, Kennedy said. "We need
to examine our system to see
whether it makes us too prone to
errors of that kind," he said.
"The presence of an army of
auditors and our own extraordi
narily energetic efforts to satisfy
them have taught us some things
— not a dramatic number, but
some things — about fallibilities
in our system that we didn't know
about," Kennedy said.
The revelation about the yacht
prompted a stinging letter in early
December from Dingell to govern
ment auditors. "Clearly at this
time Stanford does not even know
what is being charged to the gov
ernment until the government
identifies the mischarge on an
item-by-item basis," Dingell
wrote.
"I'm afraid he has us there on
the yacht," Kennedy said Friday.
"If there were lots and lots and
lots of yachts, then unfortunately
that statement is truer than we'd
like it to be. We do not have any
reason to believe at the moment
that the error has been widely
repeated.
"But what I think Chairman
Dingell is getting at is that there is
a lack of transaction-by-transac
tion review in parts of our system.
I think he will come down fairly
hard on us in the hearing about
that. It is something we have to
look at."
Research universities have
invested more in research labora
tories than central accounting
systems over the years, Kennedy
said. By way of contrast, he said,
"defense contractors in the profit
sector are required to have
accounting systems that really
review individual expenditures
one by one."
Stanford's system is "some

'Given adequate
time, I can per
suade most people
what we do is rea
sonable. I cannot
do it in a 30-sec
ond sound bite,
and that is all we're
ever likely to get.'

what more horse-and-buggy,"
Kennedy said. "We don't have the
land of accounting system that
Lockheed has. If it is decided that
we have to have the kind of sys
tem that the best profit-sector
defense contractors have, it will
cost us significantly more than we
are spending now."
The lesson Stanford officials
have learned as a result of the
Hoover House disclosures is quite
different: Explaining the arcane
rules of indirect cost recovery may
be more trouble than it's worth,
Kennedy said.
"We're re-examining various
categories of cost to see whether
some pruning isn't in order,"
Kennedy explained. "We certainly
ought to prune anything that isn't
legally allowable — there isn't any
doubt about that. But we're
extending that examination to
things that, although we believe
are perfectly allowable, don't
strike people as reasonable."
Nevertheless, Kennedy still
staunchly defends the validity of
charging a fraction of Hoover
House operating costs to the gov
ernment. "I don't care whether
it's flowers, or dinners and recep
tions, or whether it's washing the
table linen after it's been used, or
buying an antique here or there,
or reflnishing a piano when its fin
ish gets crappy, or repairing a
closet and reflnishing it — all
those are investments in a Uni
versity facility that serves a whole
array of functions."
And, Kennedy said, under fed

eral rules, the University is
allowed to charge one-fifth of
those operating costs to the gov
ernment since Hoover House is
used for various research-related
receptions.
A dinner reception held Satur
day night at Hoover House for
those attending this weekend's
Centennial Symposia on the
Human Genome Project offers a
case in point, Kennedy said.
"You can't tell me (the dinner
reception) isn't very directly in
support of research," he said. "As
a matter of fact, I wouldn't be
embarrassed about saying that
every damn flower in the house
ought to be an indirect cost
against research."
On the other hand, he contin
ued, there are some functions of
the house which have nothing at
all to do with research. The sys
tem is set up to take both situa
tions into account, Kennedy
explained, by allocating a fair por
tion of the house's operating costs
to research.
"As I look at the use of Hoover
House over the 10 and a half years
I've been in it, I think 20 percent
to sponsored research seems
about right from my rough-cut
recollection," he said.
Ever since the revelations
about Hoover House costs hit the
media, Kennedy has been offering
explanations of this averaging
principle to people who are "rea
sonably thoughtful, reasonably
sympathetic and reasonably intel
ligent," he said.
"Given adequate time, I can
persuade most people what we do
is reasonable. I cannot do it in a
30-second sound-bite, and that is
all we're ever likely to get."
Consequently, the University is
now considering eliminating some
of the more easily misunderstood
items from its cost claims,
Kennedy said. The dollar-effect of
doing so would likely be "very
small," he said, but the University
has not ruled out eliminating
more costly items.
"We wouldn't hesitate to get rid
of an item that was significant if
we thought it was really likely to
be perceived as unreasonable," he

said. "Certainly the things we've
looked at so far ... do not add
numerically to a large amount of
money."
Kennedy stressed that no deci
sion had been made "as to what or
whether to cut." Nor has there
been any decision as to when any
cuts would be made. The timing of
the upcoming subcommittee hear
ings will affect all those decisions,
he said.
"Obviously, by the time of any
hearing we hope to have a good
understanding of where things
are," Kennedy said, "so that we
will be able to say with some speci
ficity what we propose to do to
avoid the recurrence of the things
that have troubled the subcom

mittee."
Kennedy said he is aware that
any reform initiatives taken by
the University are likely to be
seen as a capitulation to Dingell's
subcommittee.
"In this day and age," he said,
"people often convert a message of
reform into a message of self
incrimination. . . If I say to Mr.
Dingell, 'Mr. Chairman, we are
troubled about these things as you
are, and we think there are some
areas in which we can do better,
and here's how we're going to try
to do it,' some people will say,
'Aha! You got caught!' But there
are worse things in American life
than to say you screwed up and
you're going to fix it."

bish a piano and up to $2,000 a
month for flower arrangements at
the Lou Henry Hoover House, the
residence of Kennedy and his fam
ily.
The revelations, leaked by
staffers on the Dingell subcom
mittee, followed closely on the
heels of another embarrassing dis
closure — for several years Stan
ford had billed the government for
depreciation on the Victoria, a 72-
foot yacht owned by Stanford, as
an indirect cost of research.
While the depreciation on the
yacht was clearly a violation of
government rules, the same can
not be said of the chest, piano and
flowers in Hoover House. Because
the president's residence also
serves as the site of several
research-related conferences and
briefings, the government allows
Stanford to claim a fraction —
about one-fifth — of Hoover
House's operating costs as an
indirect cost of doing research.
Both the revelation about the
yacht and those about Hoover
House have offered valuable
lessons to the University,


km m i
Kennedy
Kennedy said Friday. "We're seri
ous about trying to learn from
what is happening to us," he said.
The oversight on the yacht has
forced University officials to take
a closer look at their accounting
system, Kennedy said. "We need
to examine our system to see
whether it makes us too prone to
errors of that kind," he said.
"The presence of an army of
auditors and our own extraordi
narily energetic efforts to satisfy
them have taught us some things
— not a dramatic number, but
some things — about fallibilities
in our system that we didn't know
about," Kennedy said.
The revelation about the yacht
prompted a stinging letter in early
December from Dingell to govern
ment auditors. "Clearly at this
time Stanford does not even know
what is being charged to the gov
ernment until the government
identifies the mischarge on an
item-by-item basis," Dingell
wrote.
"I'm afraid he has us there on
the yacht," Kennedy said Friday.
"If there were lots and lots and
lots of yachts, then unfortunately
that statement is truer than we'd
like it to be. We do not have any
reason to believe at the moment
that the error has been widely
repeated.
"But what I think Chairman
Dingell is getting at is that there is
a lack of transaction-by-transac
tion review in parts of our system.
I think he will come down fairly
hard on us in the hearing about
that. It is something we have to
look at."
Research universities have
invested more in research labora
tories than central accounting
systems over the years, Kennedy
said. By way of contrast, he said,
"defense contractors in the profit
sector are required to have
accounting systems that really
review individual expenditures
one by one."
Stanford's system is "some

'Given adequate
time, I can per
suade most people
what we do is rea
sonable. I cannot
do it in a 30-sec
ond sound bite,
and that is all we're
ever likely to get.'

what more horse-and-buggy,"
Kennedy said. "We don't have the
land of accounting system that
Lockheed has. If it is decided that
we have to have the kind of sys
tem that the best profit-sector
defense contractors have, it will
cost us significantly more than we
are spending now."
The lesson Stanford officials
have learned as a result of the
Hoover House disclosures is quite
different: Explaining the arcane
rules of indirect cost recovery may
be more trouble than it's worth,
Kennedy said.
"We're re-examining various
categories of cost to see whether
some pruning isn't in order,"
Kennedy explained. "We certainly
ought to prune anything that isn't
legally allowable — there isn't any
doubt about that. But we're
extending that examination to
things that, although we believe
are perfectly allowable, don't
strike people as reasonable."
Nevertheless, Kennedy still
staunchly defends the validity of
charging a fraction of Hoover
House operating costs to the gov
ernment. "I don't care whether
it's flowers, or dinners and recep
tions, or whether it's washing the
table linen after it's been used, or
buying an antique here or there,
or reflnishing a piano when its fin
ish gets crappy, or repairing a
closet and reflnishing it — all
those are investments in a Uni
versity facility that serves a whole
array of functions."
And, Kennedy said, under fed

eral rules, the University is
allowed to charge one-fifth of
those operating costs to the gov
ernment since Hoover House is
used for various research-related
receptions.
A dinner reception held Satur
day night at Hoover House for
those attending this weekend's
Centennial Symposia on the
Human Genome Project offers a
case in point, Kennedy said.
"You can't tell me (the dinner
reception) isn't very directly in
support of research," he said. "As
a matter of fact, I wouldn't be
embarrassed about saying that
every damn flower in the house
ought to be an indirect cost
against research."
On the other hand, he contin
ued, there are some functions of
the house which have nothing at
all to do with research. The sys
tem is set up to take both situa
tions into account, Kennedy
explained, by allocating a fair por
tion of the house's operating costs
to research.
"As I look at the use of Hoover
House over the 10 and a half years
I've been in it, I think 20 percent
to sponsored research seems
about right from my rough-cut
recollection," he said.
Ever since the revelations
about Hoover House costs hit the
media, Kennedy has been offering
explanations of this averaging
principle to people who are "rea
sonably thoughtful, reasonably
sympathetic and reasonably intel
ligent," he said.
"Given adequate time, I can
persuade most people what we do
is reasonable. I cannot do it in a
30-second sound-bite, and that is
all we're ever likely to get."
Consequently, the University is
now considering eliminating some
of the more easily misunderstood
items from its cost claims,
Kennedy said. The dollar-effect of
doing so would likely be "very
small," he said, but the University
has not ruled out eliminating
more costly items.
"We wouldn't hesitate to get rid
of an item that was significant if
we thought it was really likely to
be perceived as unreasonable," he

said. "Certainly the things we've
looked at so far ... do not add
numerically to a large amount of
money."
Kennedy stressed that no deci
sion had been made "as to what or
whether to cut." Nor has there
been any decision as to when any
cuts would be made. The timing of
the upcoming subcommittee hear
ings will affect all those decisions,
he said.
"Obviously, by the time of any
hearing we hope to have a good
understanding of where things
are," Kennedy said, "so that we
will be able to say with some speci
ficity what we propose to do to
avoid the recurrence of the things
that have troubled the subcom

mittee."
Kennedy said he is aware that
any reform initiatives taken by
the University are likely to be
seen as a capitulation to Dingell's
subcommittee.
"In this day and age," he said,
"people often convert a message of
reform into a message of self
incrimination. . . If I say to Mr.
Dingell, 'Mr. Chairman, we are
troubled about these things as you
are, and we think there are some
areas in which we can do better,
and here's how we're going to try
to do it,' some people will say,
'Aha! You got caught!' But there
are worse things in American life
than to say you screwed up and
you're going to fix it."
When revelations surfaced in
the press last month that the Uni
versity had been billing flower
arrangements to the federal gov
ernment as an indirect cost of
research, Stanford officials were
embarrassed but contended the
practice was perfectly legal under
government rules.
They still do, but they are now
giving serious thought to elimi
nating such controversial low-cost
items from Stanford's cost-recov
ery claims, University President
Donald Kennedy said in an hour
long interview Friday.
"If there are expenses that are
easily subject to public misunder
standing, I'd rather get rid of
them than take the risk that we'll
lose some of the public support
that we so badly need to func
tion," Kennedy said, striking a
more conciliatory chord than in
past discussions on the issue.
Kennedy declined to specify
which costs the University might
eliminate, but said "anything that
smacks of entertainment" would
be examined "especially care
fully."
Stanford's indirect cost recov
ery practices are currently under
investigation by three federal
agencies — the Office of Naval
Research, the General Accounting
Office, and the House Subcom
mittee on Oversight and Investi
gations. The subcommittee,
chaired by Rep. John Dingell, D-
Mich.,«is expected to hold hearingß
on Stanford's indirect eo«t recov
ery practices in late February or
early March.
If the University begins elimi
nating some expenses from its
cost-recovery claims, the move is

likely to be
viewed by many
as a concession to
congressional in
vestigators, who
have been relent
less in their eff
orts to embarrass
the University in
the last few
months.

During finals week last quar

"I'm afraid he has us there on
the yacht," Kennedy said Friday.
"If there were lots and lots and
lots of yachts, then unfortunately
that statement is truer than we'd
like it to be. We do not have any
reason to believe at the moment
that the error has been widely
repeated.
"But what I think Chairman
Dingell is getting at is that there is
a lack of transaction-by-transac
tion review in parts of our system.
I think he will come down fairly
hard on us in the hearing about
that. It is something we have to
look at."
Research universities have
invested more in research labora
tories than central accounting
systems over the years, Kennedy
said. By way of contrast, he said,
"defense contractors in the profit
sector are required to have
accounting systems that really
review individual expenditures
one by one."
Stanford's system is "some

'Given adequate
time, I can per
suade most people

sonable. I cannot
do it in a 30-sec
ond sound bite,
and that is all we're
ever likely to get.'

what more horse-and-buggy,"
Kennedy said. "We don't have the
land of accounting system that
Lockheed has. If it is decided that
we have to have the kind of sys
tem that the best profit-sector
defense contractors have, it will
cost us significantly more than we
are spending now."
The lesson Stanford officials
have learned as a result of the
Hoover House disclosures is quite
different: Explaining the arcane
rules of indirect cost recovery may
be more trouble than it's worth,
Kennedy said.
"We're re-examining various
categories of cost to see whether
some pruning isn't in order,"
Kennedy explained. "We certainly
ought to prune anything that isn't
legally allowable — there isn't any
doubt about that. But we're
extending that examination to
things that, although we believe
are perfectly allowable, don't
strike people as reasonable."
Nevertheless, Kennedy still
staunchly defends the validity of
charging a fraction of Hoover
House operating costs to the gov
ernment. "I don't care whether
it's flowers, or dinners and recep
tions, or whether it's washing the
table linen after it's been used, or
buying an antique here or there,
or reflnishing a piano when its fin
ish gets crappy, or repairing a
closet and reflnishing it — all
those are investments in a Uni
versity facility that serves a whole
array of functions."
And, Kennedy said, under fed

eral rules, the University is
allowed to charge one-fifth of
those operating costs to the gov
ernment since Hoover House is
used for various research-related
receptions.
A dinner reception held Satur
day night at Hoover House for
those attending this weekend's
Centennial Symposia on the
Human Genome Project offers a
case in point, Kennedy said.
"You can't tell me (the dinner
reception) isn't very directly in
support of research," he said. "As
a matter of fact, I wouldn't be
embarrassed about saying that
every damn flower in the house
ought to be an indirect cost
against research."
On the other hand, he contin
ued, there are some functions of
the house which have nothing at
all to do with research. The sys
tem is set up to take both situa
tions into account, Kennedy
explained, by allocating a fair por
tion of the house's operating costs
to research.
"As I look at the use of Hoover
House over the 10 and a half years
I've been in it, I think 20 percent
to sponsored research seems
about right from my rough-cut
recollection," he said.
Ever since the revelations
about Hoover House costs hit the
media, Kennedy has been offering
explanations of this averaging
principle to people who are "rea
sonably thoughtful, reasonably
sympathetic and reasonably intel
ligent," he said.
"Given adequate time, I can
persuade most people what we do
is reasonable. I cannot do it in a
30-second sound-bite, and that is
all we're ever likely to get."
Consequently, the University is
now considering eliminating some
of the more easily misunderstood
items from its cost claims,
Kennedy said. The dollar-effect of
doing so would likely be "very
small," he said, but the University
has not ruled out eliminating
more costly items.
"We wouldn't hesitate to get rid
of an item that was significant if
we thought it was really likely to
be perceived as unreasonable," he

said. "Certainly the things we've
looked at so far ... do not add
numerically to a large amount of
money."
Kennedy stressed that no deci
sion had been made "as to what or
whether to cut." Nor has there
been any decision as to when any
cuts would be made. The timing of
the upcoming subcommittee hear
ings will affect all those decisions,
he said.
"Obviously, by the time of any
hearing we hope to have a good
understanding of where things
are," Kennedy said, "so that we
will be able to say with some speci
ficity what we propose to do to
avoid the recurrence of the things
that have troubled the subcom

mittee."
Kennedy said he is aware that
any reform initiatives taken by
the University are likely to be
seen as a capitulation to Dingell's
subcommittee.
"In this day and age," he said,
"people often convert a message of
reform into a message of self
incrimination. . . If I say to Mr.
Dingell, 'Mr. Chairman, we are
troubled about these things as you
are, and we think there are some
areas in which we can do better,
and here's how we're going to try
to do it,' some people will say,
'Aha! You got caught!' But there
are worse things in American life
than to say you screwed up and
you're going to fix it."
