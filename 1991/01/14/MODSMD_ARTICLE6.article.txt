# Lectures examine genome research

### Alex Cronin 
The Human Genome Project,
the scientific community's largest
quest for understanding DNA and
gene sequencing, was spotlighted
before packed audiences this
weekend at a symposium in
Memorial Auditorium.
The symposium, the second in
a series of three celebrating the
Stanford Centennial, was a show
case of the extensive progress
made in genome research and the
new directions being taken in the
field of genetics.
Some of the possibilities raised
by the project include early detec
tion of Alzheimer's or Hunting
ton's diseases and the elimination
of a genetic tendency to develop
cancer.
The Human Genome Project is
a mammoth multi-billion dollar
undertaking launched by the U.S.
government which aims to under
stand and map the human
genome — the genetic informa
tion representative of the human
species, which is contained on the
23 pairs of chromosonjes found in
every cell of every genetically nor
mal human.
Stanford is one of six mcgor
centers receiving grants for
research on the genome project,
along with the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
Researchers want to sequence
every element of human DNA,
develop a physical map of the bil
lion base pairs in human chromo
somes and identify the mecha
nisms by which every gene can
affect health.
This search is similar in scale
to finding a wallet lost somewhere
between New York and San Fran
cisco, Genetics Prof. David Bot
stein said Friday. The project also
intends to find out the same infor
mation for other model organisms
such as mice, and yeast.
The lectures began with vivid
biological explanations of the pro
ject from Botstein and Biochem
istry Prof. Paul Berg, dean of the
Medical School and organizer of
the event. UC-Berkeley Professor
Mary-Claire King began a section
on societal implications with
heartbreaking stories describing
the role of genetics in reuniting
families after political kidnap
pings in Argentina.
Later, Law Assoc. Prof. Henry
Greely raised hypothetical eco
nomic situations to teach about
how health insurance in America
might change given new develop
ments in human genetic research.
The speakers concluded the three
days of talks with a forum debat
ing the ethics of different situa
tions related to the genome pro
ject.
The project falls in the category
of "big science" because it
requires a lot of work and money.
A three-billion-dollar budget pro
posal, as large as that of the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center, is
involved.
With such a large project, some
scientists question whether the
results will ever be that meaning-

and San Francisco.

fill, because only 10 to 20 percent
of the human genome actually
encodes genetic information. Bot
sein said the project might be crit
icized in the future because new
technologies will make the under
taking easier and cheaper.
Both biologists and sociologists
question the ethics behind genetic
research on humans. The project
raises questions about the stigma
and the rights of privacy involved
in knowing one has a genetic dis
ease. Because genetic vulnerabil
ity is not a matter of choice or of
environment, identifying human
genes raises new questions about
social justice and discrimination.
Some applications are univer
sally considered worthy, and
encourage more research. For
instance, gene therapy may be
able to cure cancer in the future.
Understanding the mechanisms
by which genes function is the key
to predicting how much a specific
individual is at risk.
Yet some applications or
spinoffs of this type of research
remain controversial. As an
extreme case, Prof. Daniel Kelves
of Caltech noted, Nazi-esque
human breeding relies on genetic
knowledge.
Prof. Eric Lander of the Mas
sachusetts Institute of Technol
ogy explained that genes cannot
be classified as good or bad. A gene
that causes blood cells to break
down quickly may aggravate
sickle cell anemia, yet this same
function may help guard against
malaria. There is often not a sim
ple correlation between genes and
functions or traits. Most genes are
part of complex biological mecha
nisms that are not yet understood.
