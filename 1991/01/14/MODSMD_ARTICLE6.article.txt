# Lectures examine genome research

The Human Genome Project,
the scientific community's largest
quest for understanding DNA and
gene sequencing, was spotlighted
before packed audiences this
weekend at a symposium in
Memorial Auditorium.
The symposium, the second in
a series of three celebrating the
Stanford Centennial, was a show
case of the extensive progress
made in genome research and the
new directions being taken in the
field of genetics.
Some of the possibilities raised
by the project include early detec
tion of Alzheimer's or Hunting
ton's diseases and the elimination
of a genetic tendency to develop
cancer.
The Human Genome Project is
a mammoth multi-billion dollar
undertaking launched by the U.S.
government which aims to under
stand and map the human
genome â€” the genetic informa
tion representative of the human
species, which is contained on the
23 pairs of chromosonjes found in
every cell of every genetically nor
mal human.
Stanford is one of six mcgor
