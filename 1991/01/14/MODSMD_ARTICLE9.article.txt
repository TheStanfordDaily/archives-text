# Kennedy to go on '20/20'
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
University President Don
ald Kennedy has agreed "in
principle" to be interviewed on
camera by "20/20" for a seg
ment on the indirect cost con
troversy at Stanford.
A production team from the
ABC News weekly television
magazine will return to cam
pus the week of Jan. 27 to
interview Kennedy and com
plete other work on the piece.
The segment is expected to air
in late February.
Representatives from
"20/20" spent several days on
campus late last month shoot
ing footage of Stanford and of
researcher's labs. Stanford
engineering professors William
Reynolds and William Spicer
were also interviewed at that
time.
Bill Willson, the producer of
the segment, had hoped to
interview Stanford administra
tors during the same trip. But
officials refused, saying they
had not been given enough
advance notice, and offered to
make a spokesperson available
for an interview later this

month.
Late last week, Stanford
indicated Kennedy would be
willing to appear on the show.
Several details related to the
timing and conditions of the
interview have yet to be
worked out.
"I don't think any good pur
pose is served by ducking,"
Kennedy said in a Friday inter
view with The Daily.
"And you know what they do
when you duck," he said, shift
ing into his impersonation of a
sensationalist television inves
tigative reporter. "They say,
'We attempted to interview
President Donald Kennedy.'
Then they show a shot of you
scurrying into your office with
your hand over your face.
"It's a loser not to appear.
You look worse, like you have
something to hide. You look
less than candid and forthcom
ing. And since other material
on this particular show is being
carefully selected for its nega
tive impact, you give up any
chance you would have had to
counter it."
