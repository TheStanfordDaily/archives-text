# Helicopter lands in Roble field
## 
### Steve Mitzenmacher Staff writer 
Because of malfunctioning
facilities at Stanford Hospital last
night, an "air ambulance" heli
copter could not land there and
was forced to discharge its passen
ger in Roble field.
The patient was transported
from there to the hospital by
ambulance.
According to Timothy Tatman,

the helicopter pilot and flight
operations director of California
Shock/Trauma Air Rescue, "The
elevator which connects the
rooftop helipad to the rest of the
hospital was rendered inoperable,
which necessitated a landing in a
large area somewhere nearby the
hospital grounds. [Roble] field
provided the obvious alternative."
The helicopter was met by a
University ambulance which
transported two nurses and the

passenger — who Tatman said
was a victim of a car crash in the
Santa Cruz mountains — to the
hospital.
A hospital spokesperson could
not be reached for comment about
the elevator malfunction.
Stanford Medical Center's on
call nursing supervisor said the
injured passenger was a 16-year
old female named Stephanie
Hagan. A condition was not yet
available.
