# USW condemns Gulf offensive
## 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
United Stanford Workers rep
resentatives, echoing the senti
ments of unions throughout the
nation, yesterday said they
deplore the transformation of
"Desert Shield" into "Desert
Sword." 1
USW President Debbie Britt
said the USW will soon follow the
lead of other unions across the

country that have issued state
ments opposing a U.S.-led military
offensive in the Persian Gulf. The
AFL-CIO Central Labor Council
for Santa Clara and San Benito
Counties passed a resolution yes
terday opposing the initiation of
military action in the Gulf.
"Not only do working people
tend to be the ones who die, there
will also be an economic impact,"
Britt said. "The cost will be borne
by the workers."

"We are gravely concerned
about the prospect of war in the
Persian Gulf," said Richard
Sawyer, business manager for the
labor council, in a written state
ment yesterday. "Because it is
working people who make up a
disproportionate amount of U.S.
military forces, it is our members
and their sons and daughters who
stand to lose their lives in the
event activity is escalated in the
Mideast."
Sawyer's statement also said
the local labor council's resolution
is similar to or identical to resolu
tions passed in AFL-CIO councils
around the country.
Britt said the USW will vote on
a similar resolution at its Jan. 24
meeting. Former steward Linda
Crouse, now a USW volunteer,
said virtually all Bay Area chap
ters of the Service Employees
International Union — of which
the USW is a member — are
opposed to a U.S. attack.
Calling the situation unfair to
workers, she said, "Wealthy peo
ple don't have to go into the
Marines to get a decent education
and a decent job."
A union members
are military reservists, Britt and
Crouse said, but they did not have
a list of names.
The local labor council, along
with the Santa Clara County
Council of Churches, will host a
labor community forum at San
Jose's Labor Temple Jan. 24 to
discuss the Mideast crisis.
