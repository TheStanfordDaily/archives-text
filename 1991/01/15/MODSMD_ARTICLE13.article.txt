# Last-minute peace efforts multiply as midnight comes
## 
### 
(AP) â€” France offered a last-minute proposal yes
terday to avert war in the gulf, but the United States
appeared to reject the plan because it called for talks
on the Palestinian question in exchange for Iraq's
pullout from Kuwait.
With Iraq and the United States seemingly locked
on a course for war heading into the midnight U.N.
deadline for the withdrawal, last-ditch peace efforts
were multiplying.
In addition to the French plan, to be presented to
the U.N. Security Council last night, Yemen and the
Palestine Liberation Organization were floating pro
posals.
Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Abdul Amir al-Anbari,
said French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas would
go to Baghdad, presumably to discuss the proposal.
U.N. diplomats said the visit might occur tonight.
Around the world, anti-war protesters took to the
streets, and Israel called up more reservists amid
reports on state-owned radio that Iraq might make a
surprise first strike on the Jewish state within two
days.
New York stocks fell sharply before a late rally,
bonds tumbled while oil prices soared on world mar
kets.
France's six-point plan calls for U.N. peacekeep
ing forces to replace the multinational force cur
rently in the Persian Gulf, and non-aggression guar
antees for Iraq, once it pulls its troops from Kuwait.
The most controversial aspect is a call for a peace
conference on Palestine, "at an appropriate time"
and "with the appropriate structure," after Iraq's
withdrawal from Kuwait.
U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering appeared to
reject the proposal, saying, "We do not believe the

creation of linkage ... is a contribution. Any effort
should come from Saddam Hussein."
Alone among leading Western nations, France has
suggested the Palestinian issue might be part of a
peaceful resolution of the gulf crisis. Iraq has said it
would only consider leaving Kuwait if Israel left the
occupied territories.
With Israel flatly rejecting such a possibility, the
United States and its other EC allies oppose any
linkage of Kuwait to Palestine.
The Yemeni plan was similar to the French one. It
differed in calling for the multinational forces in the
region to be withdrawn "as soon as Iraq accepts the
principle of withdrawal"; asking the Security Coun
cil to implement all resolutions on the Arab-Israeli
conflict; and ending the U.N.-decreed embargo on
Iraq.
A high-level Yemeni delegation met Saddam yes
terday, and President Ali Abdullah Saleh said in
San'a, Yemen, that "the Americans have accepted
the proposal." But that could not immediately be
confirmed.
Secretary of State James Baker 111 said in Ottawa
he was aware of Yemen's proposal. But in Washing
ton, an administration official said it was "not a
going proposal" because it contained the unaccept
able call for a Middle East peace conference.
The flurry of proposals came after U.N. Secretary-
General Javier Perez de Cuellar returned to New
York, via Paris, from Baghdad, saying he had lost
hope for peace after meeting with the Iraqi president
on Sunday.
Iraq's parliament yesterday once again declared
that a Palestinian homeland, not Kuwait, was at
issue in the gulf crisis.
