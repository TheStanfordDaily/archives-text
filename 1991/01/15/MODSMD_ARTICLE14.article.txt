WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House said
yesteray that Iraq will be living on "borrowed
time" after tonight's deadline for withdrawal

rate of about 5,000 a day and that 450,000 would
be on station by the end of the deployment.
President Bush, meanwhile, signed the resolu
tion approved by Congress authorizing force
against Iraq. He said the measure sends "the
clearest possible message to Saddam Hussein
that he must withdraw from Kuwait without con
dition or delay."
He also said he was pleased that Congress and
the White House were were "uniting in a com
mon objective" despite differences on the presi
dent's war-making authority.
There was no sign that Iraq would pull back.
United Nations Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar, who met in Baghdad with Saddam
Hussein, said, "I don't see any reason to have real
hope."
