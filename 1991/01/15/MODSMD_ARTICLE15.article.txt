# Arms summit 'up in air'
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The White
House said yesterday the Moscow arms
summit is "up in the air" in the aftermath
of the Soviet army crackdown on Lithuania,
and that President Bush is reconsidering
his economic help for the ailing Soviet econ
omy.
White House press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater said the Soviets had assured the
United States that President Mikhail Gor
bachev is still seeking a peaceful solution to
the strife in the Baltics.
But Fitzwater said "we don't really
know" whether Gorbachev was in the dark
about the decision to storm a Vilnius televi
sion station and tower with tanks and para
troopers. Fourteen people were killed and
scores injured.
Gorbachev said in Moscow yesterday
that a local military commander made the
decision on Sunday's raid and Gorbachev
himself only learned in"the early morning
when they got me up."
"Clearly the trip to Moscow is up in the
air. I think there's a general skepticism that
we would go," Fitzwater told a news brief
ing. He said a final decision "will not be
made for some time."
Richard Boucher, deputy spokesman at
the State Department, said "the world is
waiting to get a full explanation" from the
Soviets about the tragedy.
But a senior U.S. official, speaking on
condition he not be identified, said no
explanation can justify the actions. "If
(Gorbachev) ordered it, he shouldn't have.
If he didn't order it, he should stop it,"the
official said.
Lithuanian-American leaders have com
plained that Bush responded too weakly to

earlier threats from the Kremlin to get
tough with the Baltics. Just last week Gor
bachev warned the rebellious republics that
might be subject to direct presidential rule.
Fitzwater pointed to recent trade conces
sions and an emergency $1 billion food
credit package for the Soviets as "the obvi
ous tools" the United States could use to
back up its demand that the Kremlin stop
the strong-arm tactics on the Baltics.
Fitzwater said the Soviets have already
tapped all but $200 million of the agricul
tural loans that Bush extended last month
to help Gorbachev avert food shortages and
get his ailing economy through the winter.
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-
Kan., called for suspending the grain cred
its, saying "the United States must not be a
party to oppression and blackmail."
Dole said the prime minister of Moldavia
told him last week that Gorbachev was
threatening to withhold grain from
republics that refused to sign a union
treaty. "Unless Gorbachev puts an immedi
ate end to the threats, blackmail and
aggression, the United States should not
deal with him in a 'business as usual' man
ner," said the Kansas senator.
Bush talked about Lithuania during a
meeting with congressional leaders, and
Dole said the president spoke of "the need
for the Soviets to get the message."
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, on the Senate floor said, "This
killing simply cannot be justified, any more
than the Chinese government's slaughter
of innocents in Tiananmen Square."
The State Department urged Americans
to put off all non-essential travel to the
Baltic states.
