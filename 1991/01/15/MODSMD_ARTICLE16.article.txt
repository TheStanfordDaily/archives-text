# Anti-war rallies take on edge of desperation
## 
### 
(AP) — Anti-war rallies took on
a desperate edge yesterday when
demonstrators burned an Ameri
can flag in Minneapolis, blocked a
downtown intersection in Chicago
and disrupted traffic on the
Golden Gate Bridge in San Fran
cisco.
With the deadline for a peaceful
solution to the Persian Gulf crisis
just one day away, there was an
added sense of urgency to peace
rallies. Demonstrators also turned
out for rallies to support Ameri
can soldiers.
Police arrested more than 100
people in Chicago during the
morning rush hour when an esti
mated 3,000 protesters, many
shouting "No blood for oil,"
blocked streets in the downtown
Loop district and marched into
the building housing Amoco Corp.
headquarters.
Some motorists honked their
horns and flashed peace signs,
although others appeared angered
by the disruption. Some workers
dropped paper from windows of
office buildings and applauded the
crowd.
In Washington, D.C., activist
Dick Gregory and homeless advo
cate Carol Fennelly were arrested
for demonstrating in a restricted
area in front of the White House,
U.S. Park Police said. Earlier yes
terday, Gregory, in the 54th day of
a hunger fast, had taken a letter
to the Iraqi Embassy calling for
peace.
Across the street from the
White House, a group of Ojibway
Indians from Minnesota set up a
"peace drum" and began pound
ing on it. Bea Swanson, an Ojib
way from the White Earth Reser
vation, said the four Ojibways and
five supporters will remain at
Lafayette Park through Thursday.
Two people were arrested in
Minneapolis, where an estimated
800 to 1,000 people blocked

entrances to a federal office build
ing, which houses military
recruiting offices.
Police Lt. Joey Winslow said
one arrest was for assaulting a
police officer; the other was for
burning an American flag.
Protesters had burned the flag in
a garbage bin and rolled the bin
down the street.
Protesters chanted "No blood
for oil," "Shut it down" and "We
won't kill for Texaco."
But hopes that protest could
forestall a war appeared to be fad
ing. "Death is coming. The die is
cast," said one demonstrator,

Jackie Heinie, who wore a mask of
a skull over her face.
In a New York demonstration,
about 500 young people, most
from high schools, gathered in
front of recruiting office in Times
Square to chant for peace.
"I'm angry," 11-year-old
Erlind Kelly said. "My uncle's
probably going to die. For oil. Who
cares about oil?"
The crowd grew to 1,000 by the
time protesters marched about 28
blocks, disrupting traffic along
the way.
At least 19 people were
arrested and seven police officers

suffered injuries, including one
who was pushed off his motorcy
cle, said Detective Joseph
McConville. It wasn't immedi
ately known if any of the injuries
were serious.
Several hundred protesters dis
rupted the morning rush hour on
the Golden Gate Bridge, which
links San Francisco with its
northern suburbs.
In Santa Rosa, Calif., demon
strators burned a wooden effigy of
President Bush in a city intersec
tion and several students staged a
"die-in" by lying in intersections
and blocking traffic.
