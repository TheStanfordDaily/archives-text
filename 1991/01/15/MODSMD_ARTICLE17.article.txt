Bodyguard kills PLO officials
NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — A renegade bodyguard assassinated
PLO leader Yasser Arafat's two top aides and a security officer
last night, then took hostage the family of one of the victims, a
senior Palestinian commander said.
The gunman was demanding a plane to fly him out of Tunis
after killing Salah Khalaf, Arafat's second-in-command; Hayel
Abdel-Hamid, the PLO's security chief; and Abu Mohammed Al-
Omari, Khalaf s bodyguard, said several sources reached in Tunis
by telephone.
The senior Palestinian official said Abdel-Hamid's wife and
teenage daughter were being held by the gunman, whom he iden
tified only as "Hamza," inside their house in the Tunis suburb of
Marsa where the shooting occurred.
The death of Khalaf left Arafat as the sole survivor among the
three original founders of Fatah, the first PLO group and its
largest faction.
Africa's impoverishment deepens
NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Africa suffered its 12th consecutive
year of deepening impoverishment in 1990 and will need immedi
ate help to ease the impact of the Persian Gulf crisis, a U.N. spe
cialist said yesterday.
But even without the higher costs of oil caused by Iraq's inva
sion of Kuwait, a shaky world economy points to a "dim prospect"
for Africa's growth in 1991, said Adebayo Adedeji.
The number of people born in 1990 continued to outpace the
continent's economic growth, and Africa's foreign debt burden
grew to nearly $272 billion, said Adedeji, head of the U.N. Eco
nomic Commission for Africa.
So while Africa's earnings as measured by the continent's
overall gross domestic product rose 3 percent, they were offset by
the high population growth rate and effectively fell by 0.2 percent,
Adedeji said in his year-end report.
The continent also continues to suffer severe food shortages
that have been aggravated by wars in Sudan, Ethiopia, Mozam
bique and Liberia, said Adedeji.
Serrano takes office in Guatemala
GUATEMALA CITY (AP) — President Jorge Serrano yester
day became the first democratically elected Guatemalan civilian
to succeed another, and promised to fight the country's economic
crisis and to end its long guerrilla war.
Serrano, a 45-year-old engineer and businessman, easily
defeated newspaper publisher Jorge Carpio Nicolle in a runoff
election Jan. 6. The constitution prohibited outgoing President
Vinicio Cerezo from seeking a second 5-year term.
More than 100,000 people have been killed in fighting and
related political violence in Guatemale the past three decades.
