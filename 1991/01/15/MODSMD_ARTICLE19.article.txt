## Embracing reform 
### 
The long-needed assu
bylaw reform, unanimously
enacted by the ASSU Senate
last week, clarifies much, though it
vindicates nothing.
By spelling out explicitly what
the rules governing elections are,
the bylaw reform will avoid the
debacle of last year's spring elec
tion, when a dubiously elected
Council of Presidents was nearly
recalled by the student body.
However, the fact that the new
procedures count "only write-in
votes attributable to a single,
write-in candidate or slate" does
not vindicate the questionable
decision made under the old rules,
nor does it add legitimacy to a COP
that took office months ago.
Reasonably, the bylaws now pre
vent the election of fictional slates
that various groups of people can

claim to represent. But it is impor
tant that students still be able to
express dissatisfaction by means of
the write-in process.
Students should be given the
opportunity to make a "none of the
above" vote, voicing their dissatis
faction with the candidates or the
process in a legitimate way that is
counted by the ASSU.
The ASSU must also provide, on
the ballot, a clear explanation of
the write-in process and how votes
are counted.
Finally, the ASSU must do
everything it can to comply with
the bylaws in this spring's election
and throughout the year.
The bylaws must be imple
mented, not ignored; otherwise,
last week's long-needed reform
will be no more than senatorial hot
air.
