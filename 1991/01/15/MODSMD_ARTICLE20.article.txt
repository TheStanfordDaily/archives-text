# Splendid, Jean!

Everyone has to admit
it: Jean Fetter has left a
tremendous mark on Uni
versity life over the past seven
years. And now that she's leaving
the Admissions Office on sabbati
cal, it's time to give her the thanks
she so richly deserves.
Unlike her counterparts at
many other schools, Dean Jean
served as an accessible mother fig
ure in a world filled with "reposi
tioned" administrators. She would
frequently drop by dorms for din
ner or make standing in line at the
Bursar's Office more palatable
when she happened by.
From writing personal notes to
all admitted students to having a
cameo role each year in Gaieties,
she was our first Stanford contact
and played a prominent part in the
whole undergraduate experience.
Probably Dean Jean's greatest
accomplishment has been increas

ing both the diversity and intellec
tual curiosity of the student body.
By drawing students from all
ethnic and racial backgrounds, she
has helped Stanford and its resi
dents to prepare for an increas
ingly multicultural America.
By recruiting more academi
cally-oriented people, Dean Jean
helped counteract the image of
Stanford as an anti-intellectual
country club.
The only problem with Dean
Jean's legacy is that it will be diffi
cult to find an adequate replace
ment for her — one who would
make as much of an effort to reach
out to students (and preferably,
one with a similar accent).
In the meantime, we wish Dean
Jean well as she begins work on
her book. We hope that she contin
ues to contribute as much to Stan
ford's atmosphere as she has in the
past.
