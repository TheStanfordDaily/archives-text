Persian Gulf war would not answer problems at home

DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: Please
don't do it. You have pointed the
nation's guns and resources in the
wrong direction. No longer do we have to
go out of our own borders to seek out a
common evil that will unify our country.
War in the Persian Gulf is not the
answer to the many problems here at
home — not even for the one which to
me is the most pressing: the one where
being an American means that one is a
pariah, a throw-away person when in
fact one is a casualty of an undeclared
war.
Let me explain.
A while ago I went to visit my friend
Peter. His appearance was alarming. He
looked like a Holocaust victim, unkempt
and forlorn, but what alarmed me most
was his sense of despair and helpless
ness; yet I could detect in his weakened
voice and his steely eyes a strong desire
to continue to live.
We spoke about many personal things
including his plans for the future. He
invited me for Thanksgiving dinner at
his house and mentioned that his par
ents would be out to see him during
Christmas, adding each time that he did
not know in what conditions he might be

for either holiday — meaning very ill, or,
the momentary silence that followed
each time I interpreted as saying,
"dead."
He told me that his brothers didn't
quite know what to do about him, that
they felt "helpless." Earlier that day, I
had heard that very description from
another friend who was commenting on
the massive military buildup in Saudi
Arabia. We agreed that a real tragedy
was about to happen and we somehow
felt disconnected from it and quite help
less to effect any influence in anyway.
Yesterday, amid the many news
reports on the rhetoric of war and debate
on the military options and consent of
action by Congress, I saw and heard a
young foot soldier patrolling the Saudi
Desert say on the evening news some
thing like "If we're gonna go, let's go. If
we're not, let's go home." He seemed
helpless too, but not without a vision
and purpose.
Mr. President, I needn't give you a
history lesson to argue against another
war for principle or commodity. History
will do that in the long run. I would,
however, like to appeal to your sense of
specifically that concept: history.

Would you like to go down in history
as a president who brought our nation
into another costly war and a recession
that at best threatens to sink our coun
try into deeper recesses of despair and
helplessness and ultimately stagnation,
or, would you rather become the presi
dent who thought out the problems and
enacted long-term solutions as well as
short-term responses to our most press
ing ordeals here at home. Or, are you too
helpless, Mr. President?
Ought you, perhaps seek the advice of
foot soldiers instead of high-ranking
executives and generals in the formula
tion of your policies? Vision and purpose
is what we most lack and need in our
nation today. It is only logical to look at
the enemy square in the eye and resolve
to either fight him/her or run away. Mr.
President, it appears that helplessness
and disconnectedness from a rapidly
changing world and helpless to adjust to
those changes.
Again, I needn't provide examples but
even, our most dreaded and hated post-
WW II enemy is now our friend and
again our ally. Negotiation, political as
well as the use of common sense, ulti
mately persevered.

Can we learn from that hindsight and
provide a vision for the future? Can we
move from the era of macho grandstand
ing and recapture our sense of purpose
as a people? Can we purposely attempt to
address the real cancers that plague our
society and resolve to leave something
other than our problems to the next gen
eration?
Vision, purpose, morale are the cen
tral concepts that defy our current for
eign policy because as my friend Peter
said about his brothers, we all feel help
less and don't quite know what to do.
The worst thing is to do nothing and
if something be done, please let it not be
a step backwards. War is not the answer,
statemanship, vision and purpose is. My
friend Peter, who is himself ravaged by
another war — AIDS — thinks so too,
and I, who also fight in the same
trenches with him, ask you and the
nation to reason and rethink our
options. Let us not look outside for our
enemies. Let us first look within. The
enemy might turn out to be us and our
own sense of helplessness.
