# Bush using human rights violations as political tool
## 
### 
i It is true that "widespread abuses of
!human rights" have occurred since the
; Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. Pres
ident Bush is legitimately outraged at
these abuses, as are we at Amnesty
' International at Stanford.
! Without trivializing the atrocities per
petrated over the past months, however,
we feel the need to clarify that these

human rights violations are entirely con
sistent with abuses known to have been
committed in Iraq over many years.
Bush's use of these violations as a jus
tification for waging war is opportunistic
at best, hypocritical at worst. When Sad
dam Hussein gassed thousands of inno
cent Iraqi civilians during war with Iran,
our government did not take the position
that "there is no horror that could make
this a more obvious conflict of good vs.
evil," as President Bush wrote regarding
abuses perpetrated by Iraqi forces in
Kuwait. Rather, we continued to support
the Iraqi government financially and
militarily.
Since the invasion of Kuwait,

Moral outrage over human
rights violations must
shape United States policy.

Amnesty International has released
reports of detention and torture of gov
ernment opponents in Egypt, extrajudi
cial executions by Syrian forces in
Lebanon, "disappearances" in Morocco
and arrest, detention and torture of
Yemenis in Saudi Arabia.
President Bush's position appears to
be that human rights violations will be
ignored when committed by our allies

and exploited politically against our ene
mies.
Amnesty International takes no posi
tion on the dispute over Kuwait or mea
sures being taken to resolve it. We
believe that respect for human rights
should be a guiding principle of govern
ment policy, and we applaud Bush's
newly demonstrated concern.
However, moral outrage over human
rights violations must shape United
States policy continually and consis
tently, not merely when it is politically
expedient.
