## The 						fall of the war hammer 
### 
IT'S THE MORNING OF JANUARY
14th as I write this. By my editor's
standards, these words are already
late; by my feelings, they're necessarily
premature.
This close to the expiration of the
United Nations deadline for Iraq's with
drawal from Kuwait, this close to having
the hammer fall, this close to having one
of the Defense Department's 40,000 body
bags return home with the corpse of a
friend or a relative ... being this close
makes writing any words seem to be
merely a way of counting down the time.
The arguments for and against the
action have been exhausted, and nobody
with any power to do anything, i.e. Sad
dam Hussein or George Bush, seems to
have listened to much of any of them;
those with family members in the Saudi
sands have said their prayers, and they
also seem to have had little attention paid
to them.
People have hit the streets in large
numbers, both here and around the
world, to protest the actions of our gov
ernment, but people power has proven
impotent. There's not much more to do in
the remaining hours but wait and see.
The mood of the people around me has
spiraled into depression, as they realize
that, in this democracy of ours, the deci
sion between preserving lives by pursuing
peace and losing even more lives by pur
suing war — the decision between life and
death — comes down to the judgment of
one man.
And it doesn't help the mood when
that man seems to see the world in infan
tile shades of black and white, good and

evil, who seems to be willfully ignoring
the complexity of the situation in order to
posture as the biggest, baddest good guy
in the world. If Reagan was playing out
the script for a Western, Bush seems
determined to adhere to the storyline of a
J.R.R. Tolkien fantasy. Unfortunately,
this is the modern world, not Middle
Earth.
It's further disillusioning to read
reports that, because of the Gulf Crisis,
the FBI, taking time out, we assume,
from hunting down 'sexual deviants,' is
readying plans to photograph, fingerprint
and register all Iraqis in the United
States.
Hard to believe that it was only two
years ago that Congress made an official
apology concerning the internment of
Japanese-Americans during World War
11. I suppose I should take solace in the
consistency of the administration's
actions — they're obviously committed to
repeating all the mistakes of the past.
What makes this all the more difficult
to accept is that I spent the last month in
a country, Indonesia, where there was vir
tually no news of the Gulf Crisis, and cer
tainly no talk of it. Coming back to the
fear, the anxiety, the depression, the
anger, the bewilderment that the crisis
has engendered was to step off the plane
and smack straight into a solid wall of
negative emotion.
The impact, and the contrast it high
lights, has left an impression. People feel
this coming; it's not just a case for the
intellectual masturbation of detached
debate.
Ironically, the bullying tactics used by

the Indonesian government to keep its
diverse populace in line seem to be almost
benign in comparison to what this coun
try is about to embark upon. Well, maybe
not benign. But at least they're honest
about it and don't cloak their actions in
oozy, hypocritical rhetoric about moral
obligations and capital 'G' good vs. capital
'E' evil.
I have no idea how the troops out in
the field think, nor do I wish to equate my
fear with theirs. But sitting here, momen
tarily safe and secure in my little ivory
haven, it all makes me want to vomit.
And it all makes me believe that, if
George Bush needs to release some pent
up resentment for being considered
wimpish, if he needs to assert America's
manhood to the rest of the world, if he
must take the irrational (but definitely
macho) stand of 'no compromises', if he
wants to go out and 'kick some ass,' we
should give him some combat boots and
desert fatigues and send him over where
he can put his own ass on the line.
If this were a just world, the fighting
would last just long enough for him to get
it shot off.
