In"The Secret Pilgrim," his 12th novel,
acclaimed British writer John le Carr6 follows up on
"The Russia House," his 1989 glasnost thriller. In
that book, which became a critical and commercial
success, le Carr6 (the pseudonym for former British
civil servant David Cornwell) constructed a serious
tale of espionage set in Gorbachev's reforming Soviet
Union.
"The Russia House" was a brilliant demonstra
tion of the perennial relevance of intrigue, at all lev
els of its existence. Although "The Secret Pilgrim" in
some ways serves as an extension of themes from
many of his previous works, le Carry's newest effort
is both unconvincing and unfulfilling.
The book is built as a series of episodes contained
within a larger framework and revolves around two
characters. George Smiley, the brilliant and canny
spymaster who is perhaps le Carry's best creation,
conveniently provides the moral at the beginning of
each tale. He is lecturing the graduating class of
operatives of British Intelligence's Sarratt Nursery
at the behest of that school's superintendent, a man
named Ned.
Ned, whose first appearance in le Carry's world
was as the perceptive operation controller in"The
Russia House," provides the true substantial focus
of the book, for he narrates the entire text, and all
the stories are told of and by him.
Le Carry's purpose emerges only gradually. The
initial story is that of a young Ned who on his first
operation is barely prevented from causing an inter
national incident by the intercession of his experi
enced superior. This artlessly-related event —
indicative of many of the chapters to come — has
value only when considered in the context of the
entire book; it is the first of many intimations that to
hope to rescue the world through clandestine heroics
is simply sheer folly.
The next chapter launches an examination of love
and its association with intelligence services; this
exploration continues intermittently throughout the
book. But le Carr6 obscures the true center of this
episode — a forbidden homosexual longing — by con

centrating on the trappings of espionage. Although
♦.hi« story is more successful than some, the intrigue
is simplistic and uninteresting. Smiley's machina
tions are not edifying in any way, but merely consis
tent with the readers expectations.
The next episode is perhaps the most awkward;
after that point, however, all the tales work with
some degree of success. But unfortunately, although
Ned's character gradually evolves throughout the
book, Ned strikes the reader as false and unconvinc
ing. He clings to the memory of a wise and beautiful
woman whom he failed to love, the chronic tragedy
of his life, but she is as plastic a symbol as he is a per
son.
Fortunately, various anecdotes communicate the
author's contention — which is that the substance of
love is vastly superior to the artifice of espionage.
This, of course, reiterates the central message of
both "The Russia House," in which one man trades
his nation's secrets so he can effect the salvation of
his love, and 1986's "A Perfect Spy," in which the
central character continues a cycle of heartless
betrayal because he is familiar only with deceit.
In its unornamented, embarrassingly amateurish
writing style "The Secret Pilgrim" calls to mind
Stanislaw Lena's recent book, "Eden," or "Spy
Sinker," Len Deighton's latest offering. But while
Lem's prose was intentionally sparse, Deighton and
le Carr6 simply have no idea how to carry off the
effect they desire.
"The Secret Pilgrim" manages to surpass
Deighton's 1990 work; while Deighton revealed,
implausibly, that each and every event of his past
five novels had been manipulated — meanwhile
expecting us to gasp with astonishment at each new
revelation — le Carr6 has crafted his tale with some
more significant purpose in mind. Regrettably, this
didacticism seems to block the author's normal apti
tude for plot and style.
There are other abnormalities here that highlight
the novel's inadequacies. This book is dedicated to
Alec Guiness, "with affection and thanks." Sir Alec,
of course, is the distinguished British actor who por
trayed the writer's prominent protagonist so well in
"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy" and "Smiley's People,"
the two good but laboriously faithful British-pro
duced multi-part television adaptations of the first
and last books of "The Quest for Karla" trilogy.
The dedication is odd, however, in light of the fact

that le Carr6 has complained that Guineas robbed
him of his private vision of Smiley. Many, however
glad they may be to encounter Smiley, may fault le
Carry's decision to make use of the character. The
Smiley who lectures us is not the gentle, shrewd and
morose man of the novels. Only when I imagined Sir
Alec enunciating the flowery phrases attributed to
Smiley did the speeches nearly attain any real
authenticity — nearly.
Smiley's demeanor here is contrived, his lectures
are scripted — poorly — for another man, and his
sentiments are derived from an external source. For
it is really le Carr6, a self-described Marxist, who
says:
"I only ever cared about... man.... It was man
who ended the Cold War in case you didn't notice...
. [T]he ideologies trailed after these impossible
events like condemned prisoners, as ideologies do
when they've had their day.... And if the West
chokes on its own materialism, then the West may
still turn out to have been the loser.... It's not only
our minds we're going to have to reconstruct, either.
It's the over-mighty modern State we've built for
ourselves.... We've given up far too many freedoms

in order to be free. Now we've got to take
them back."

It is almost painful to see le Carr6
abandon his craft, as he does at sev-

eral points. It's not that the nov
elist hasn't said this before; it's
just that he's never had to
resort so artlessly to this kind of

direct appeal.
So does le Carr6 convince us
that the best way to save the
world is by acting like a good cit
izen and a decent human being,
instead of playing spy? Not
really, for Ned's character is

nearly lifeless, and his transformation merely the
product of the author's pedagogy; even the anecdotal
form of the book seems less a useful framework than
an annoying crutch. Le Carr6 was seemingly at the
peak of his form with "The Russia House;" the fact
that he followed that brilliantly-constructed thriller
with such a disappointing book is surprising.
Perhaps we should take this disappointment as a
caution against ideology (in writing, at least), or
excessive devotion. But even that modest moral

seems hollow, unearned as it is by its text. Le Carr6
has proven himself masterful at exposing how
treachery can operate at every level of human
affairs. Perhaps his next novel will bring us a better
tale, one offering a clearer vision of our forever-trou
bled souls.

Matthew Milliken is a sophomore interested in spy
fiction.
