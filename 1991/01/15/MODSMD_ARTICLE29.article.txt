Perhaps a better writer is not always a
better editor. This appears to be the case
for the latest version of "Best American
Short Stories." Although Richard Ford is
the weakest of the writers chosen to edit
the anthology over the past few years, he
has put together the strongest collection
in the past decade.
Amazing stories by Edward Allen, C.S.
Godshalk, Pam Houston, Lore Segal, and
Joy Williams stand out, but the overall
quality of the collection is even more
stunning. If there has been, as some crit
ics have suggested, a renaissance of the
short story in the past decade, "Best

American Short Stories 1990" is the
noontide of this phenomenon.
The big news when this collection first
hit the stands was the inclusion of two
stories each by Richard Bausch and Alice
Munro, an event (more than one story by
an author) unprecedented in the "Best
American Short Stories" series.
The fact that Bausch and Munro are
currently two of the most "in" writers,

coupled with Ford's decision not to judge
the stories "blind" (without knowing the
author's name or the publication in
which the stoiy appeared) seems to be the
reason that these rather mediocre stories
were included in the collection.
In perhaps his only mistake as editor,
Ford panders to current notions in the lit
erary establishment (which is busv wor
shiping Munro after years of neglecting
her) and includes these stories at the
expense of some better works listed in the
100 distinguished short stories of 1990 at
the back of the volume, for example
Sharon Dilworth's excellent "The Lady
on the Plane" or Charles Baxter's "A Fire
Story."
But the stories Ford does include
shows that he has a wonderful eye for
selecting well-crafted, poetic, emotionally
involving fiction. The best of the

lot is Paro Houston's "How to Talk to a
Hunter," which combines the lingering
emotional glow of a good poem with the
intellectual impact of discursive fiction.
Every word in the story contributes to a
strong and vital rhythm, and Houston
pulls off second person point of view with
out any of the irritating artificiality of
"Bright Lights, Big City."
Lore Segal's "The Reverse Bug," is
also brilliant, if slightly more cerebral.
The story, which also won an O. Henry
award for 1990, is the most political story
included in the anthology in the past five
years, but still manages to be honest,
gripping, and tightly crafted.
"The Wizard," by C.S. Godshalk, pre
sents a novel voice, though at times the
plot and point of view are confusing. This
story takes two reads to really appreciate,
and it is only upon close analysis that the

reader notices that Godshalk has man
aged to deftly insert snippets of "high
style" and exposition without disrupting
the working-class voice of both the Wiz
ard, and his stoiy.
As well as containing the best fiction to
be published on the continent, "Best
American Short Stories 1990" is also
valuable for its list of publications, edi
tors, and addresses. The forward to the
book is again weak this year (if only Mark
Helprin could write all the forwards and
Richard Ford choose all the stories for
this series). Ford essentially says nothing
for five or six pages. But even with its
faults, if you like quality fiction, the $9.95
you spend for the book will be your best
investment of the year.
