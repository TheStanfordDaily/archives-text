Saddam Hussein amassed 30,000 troops on his bor

southeast, Saddam may have

ening both President Bush's concept
of a new world order and the lives of
thousands of American and Iraqi

troops and civilians.
Saddam's invasion of Kuwait let loose a mael
strom of political activity, as Bush pieced together a
fragile coalition of former enemies. So strong was
the resolve against Iraq that the United States and
Syria, the nation that America branded as a primary
exporter of terrorism throughout the 1980s, were
brought together as allies.
The next step was the imposition of an economic
embargo so tight it would threaten the continued
survival of the Iraqi military.
With the coalition established and the economic
embargo secured, the President then sought to
impose a deadline for withdrawal that Saddam
would be forced to obey or confront the armies of 15
countries.
The U.N. Security Council in late November
imposed a deadline of Jan. 15, today, giving Iraq a
month and a half to leave Kuwait.
Ironically, the day set by the U.N. as the deadline
for peace is the same day as the birth of Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr. in 1929.
The irony of this date should not be lost. Born on
this day was the greatest civil rights leader in Amer
ican history, a man whose unswerving dedication to
the principles of non-violence were interrupted only

by his violent death.
He was a man who risked the
progress of the civil rights move
ment by his statements against
the last mcyor American militap'
intervention: Vietnam. Putting in
jeopardy the support from Presi
dent Johnson and Congress, King
spoke eloquently but unconvinc
ingly for a non-violent foreign pol
icy.
Whether King's vision of a
peaceful foreign policy can or
should be followed is brought
directly into question by Iraq's
invasion. Should the United
States allow Iraq to go unpun
ished for its brutal acts of aggres
sion? Is it America's place to be
the world's police force, getting
involved in every world cri
sis?
Today, America stands on the
brink of war in an attempt to
"assure that this aggression is
stopped and the principles on
which this nation and the rest of
the civilized world are founded
are preserved," Bush said in his
letter to college students last
week.
The vote in Congress last Sat
urday that authorized the use of
force, although divided, gave
Bush the latitude of military
options that he had been search
ing for and placed the pressure of
determining the course of the
confrontation squarely on his
shoulders.

American military.
Battles will be waged inside the
mind of the Jewish man, who if
sent into combat must face the
question of whether he will fight
to defend the very Arab nations
that have traditionally been so
hostile to Israel, the international
home of the Jews.
As the Jewish man must decide
his fate, so too must the gay man,
who faces the discrimination of
military exclusion, unless man
power is desperately needed as it
was in Vietnam and World War 11.
The crisis in the Persian Gulf
hits home here at Stanford in
many ways, forcing those in the
reserves to face the risk that they
volunteered to confront. The cri
sis hits hard the friends and rela
tives of soldiers in the Gulf, as
well as those international stu
dents whose families may get
caught in the crossfire.
The choice between war and
peace is not a simple one. War
could result in a swift American
victory or a bloody stalemate.
Peace could induce stability in
the Middle East or trigger further
Iraqi aggression.
The confrontation in the Gulf
is divisive in many ways, causing
strife between American and
Iraqi, Jew and Arab, liberal and
conservative, ruler and ruled. But
the entire world is united in its
desire for lasting peace.
The method of achieving that
elusive lasting peace has yet to be
determined, and in the meantime
the world must play the waiting
game, hoping that a military con
frontation can be averted.
