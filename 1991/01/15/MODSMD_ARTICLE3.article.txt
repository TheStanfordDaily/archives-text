Saddam's invasion of Kuwait let loose a mael
strom of political activity, as Bush pieced together a
fragile coalition of former enemies. So strong was
the resolve against Iraq that the United States and
Syria, the nation that America branded as a primary
exporter of terrorism throughout the 1980s, were
brought together as allies.
The next step was the imposition of an economic
embargo so tight it would threaten the continued
survival of the Iraqi military.
With the coalition established and the economic
embargo secured, the President then sought to
impose a deadline for withdrawal that Saddam
would be forced to obey or confront the armies of 15
countries.
The U.N. Security Council in late November
imposed a deadline of Jan. 15, today, giving Iraq a
month and a half to leave Kuwait.
Ironically, the day set by the U.N. as the deadline
for peace is the same day as the birth of Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr. in 1929.
The irony of this date should not be lost. Born on
this day was the greatest civil rights leader in Amer
ican history, a man whose unswerving dedication to
the principles of non-violence were interrupted only
