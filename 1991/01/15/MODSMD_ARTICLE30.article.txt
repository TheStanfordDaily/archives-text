After a relative lull this quarter, the Stanford anti
war movement will kick back into high gear today by
staging a protest in White Plaza to rally opposition to
American intervention in the Persian Gulf.
The rally will begin with speeches at noon, followed
by a march to an undisclosed location on campus where
organizers will create a mock cemetery dramatizing the
possible deaths of American soldiers.
The rally will feature Aimee Allison, a member of last
year's Council of Presidents who faces a possible deploy
ment to Saudi Arabia. Allison is currently applying for
conscientious objector status to fight the deployment.
A petition supporting Allison will be circulated at the
rally, according to graduate student Kate Morris, an
organizer of the protest.
Ujamaa resident fellow Rachel Bagby will also read
from the writings of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who
was born on this day in 1929. "We want to be able to
make that connection" between King's birthday and the
United Nations-sponsored deadline for Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein to leave Kuwait, Morris said.
Rev. Floyd Thompkins, associate dean of Memorial
Church, and Rev. Byron Bland, director of Campus Min
istries, will also speak at the rally.
"I'm pretty sure it will be our largest rally," said
junior Sherifa Edoga, one of the organizers. "It's a sig
nificant date, and it won't be too difficult to get people to
come it out for it," she said.
"It's really important to show the numbers of people
who are opposed to this," Edoga added.
Last Wednesday, organizers of today's rally consid
ered calling a boycott of classes for today, but decided
against it because "education is not the problem here,"
Morris said. In addition, organizers said they did not
want to alienate professors, whose support they are try
ing to gain. "We need to have the faculty on our side at
this point," she explained.
Morris said no demonstrations were organized for last
week because "people were still confused about what
would happen" in the Gulf crisis. But Saturday's vote in
Congress authorizing the use of force against Iraq con-
