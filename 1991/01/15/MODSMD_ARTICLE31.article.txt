# 'Some things are worth fighting for'
## ROTC students remain committed 
### Ashok Rai Staff writer 
Stanford students in the
Reserve Officer Training
Corps said they are willing to
go to war in the Middle East if
called to serve, despite their
ambivalence and fear.
Commitment to the military
and readiness to face conflict in
the Saudi Arabian desert, scat
tered reservations about U.S.
policy and a hope for a peaceful
resolution to the Gulf crisis
mark the attitudes of Stanford
ROTC students on the eve of
the United Nations-imposed
deadline.
"I have pledged to defend
the Constitution," affirmed
senior John Manning, a mem
ber of the Naval Reserve Offi
cer Training Corps, "and I
believe that, though it is not
easy to speak of giving one's
life, there are some things that
are worth fighting for and
dying for."
Amy Welch, a junior in elec
trical engineering, said she felt
it was her duty to go, if needed.
Jason Tankel, a senior in polit
ical science, admitted he
"would not be thrilled" if called
to serve, but he would definite
ly go.
"The whole question boils

down to whether we can put
our faith in the American sys
tem," said Park Guthrie, a
junior in philosophy and reli
gious studies. "I don't want to
see Americans losing their
lives, but since Congress gave
Bush their support, it appears
that is what we want to do."
Lance McDaniel, a junior in
communication, said he agreed
with the letter from President
Bush published in The Daily
last Friday. He said, "We are in
the Gulf to defend a country
that cannot defend itself."
McDaniel's brother, a for
mer Army ROTC member, is
now in field artillery training,
possibly in preparation for
duty in Saudi Arabia.
The students have mixed
feelings about the U.S. role in
the Middle East, however.
Manning said war in the region
is justifiable, though never
"clearly right." Welch said the
high percentage of U.S. sol
diers in the Gulf seems to set
the United States against Iraq,
and not the world against Iraq,
as she said it should be. She
added that she wished that the
U.S. forces acted more as a
deterrent instead of an offen
sive force.
