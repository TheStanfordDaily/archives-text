# Gulf crisis hits home
## Relatives pray for peaceful end 
### Ashok Rai Staff writer 
"I'm scared and worried," said
Nadine O'Leary, whose 22 year-old son,
Kevin, has been in Saudi Arabia since
the end of August. "My husband and I do
a lot of crying. We pray for peace and
hope that everything gets resolved and
people get home safely."
For those on campus like O'Leary, the
past few months have been tense and
tearful, and the prospect of war is all the
more horrifying.
Kevin O'Leary first found out in
August, shortly after Iraq invaded
Kuwait, that he would be going to Saudi
Arabia. Last Wednesday, he was moved
from "tent city" to take his place on the
battle line supporting the 101st Air
borne Division.
His mother is the administrative
assistant to Acting Dean of Student
Affairs Norm Robinson. She said that
since she is not a "really politically
aware" person, she cannot venture an
opinion about "what's right" in the Mid

die East. She said she wishes "in her
heart that people could just sit down at a
table and work things out."
Fear and confusion were echoed by
Patricia Welsh, a senior in Biology. Her
brother, Richard, left with his Reserve
unit for the Saudi desert on Jan. 8.
Richard Welsh is second-in-command
of the Military Police unit based in Fort
McCoy, Wis. If war breaks out, he could
be exposed to sniper fire while protecting
supply convoys going into the battlefield,
according to his sister.
At the end of last quarter, she said she
found out that "he was going to be shot
at halfway around the world."
Since "somebody I know is in the line
of fire, the situation has become very dif
ferent and very upsetting," she added.
"It is almost as if a piece of me is going
off and I do not have a choice about it."
"I felt awful," she explained, "because it
had to get to a personal level before I start
ed figuring out what was going on and
reading the news about the Middle East."
Welsh said she hopes for a
peaceful solution and said that
"Bush is putting a lot of lives at
stake by not dealing with the
Arab mentality, by not giving Sad
dam a way to save face."
Both Welsh and O'Leary said
that families left behind by the
servicemen have been facing
unusual hardship. Kevin O'Leary
is married and has an 18-month
old daughter, Welsh
remarried iast May and has two
daughters, a 6-year-old and an 8-
year-old.
Patricia Welsh recalls sadly her
brother's Christmas break depar
ture. His younger daughter,
Michelle, decided that she was
going with her father. She went
down to the basement, "found a
big hat, a large green army duffel
bag, and put on a pair of gloves
and some boots and marched up
the stairs" to her father.
Welsh and O'Leary are just two
of the several community mem
bers who have a personal stake in
the Middle East situation. Bonnie
Hale, the information editor in
the Sponsored Projects Office, is
worried that her 18-year old son,
who was flown to take up an
assignment in Frankfurt, Ger
many last week, might be sent to
the Gulf.
Graduate School of Business
student Robert Ashcroft has a
brother, a medical platoon leader,
who has been in the Gulf since
August. "His job if war breaks out
will be to remove people from the
battlefield," said Ashcroft. "I am
extremely concerned about his
safety."
Senior Noelle Clemens has a
friend from high school who is
scheduled to leave on Wednesday
for the Arabian desert. "This is a
fundamental disrespect for
human life that I can't stop," she
said.
