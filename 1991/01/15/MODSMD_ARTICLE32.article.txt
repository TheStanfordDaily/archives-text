# Gulf crisis hits home
## Relatives pray for peaceful end 
### Ashok Rai Staff writer 
"I'm scared and worried," said
Nadine O'Leary, whose 22 year-old son,
Kevin, has been in Saudi Arabia since
the end of August. "My husband and I do
a lot of crying. We pray for peace and
hope that everything gets resolved and
people get home safely."
For those on campus like O'Leary, the
past few months have been tense and
tearful, and the prospect of war is all the
more horrifying.
Kevin O'Leary first found out in
August, shortly after Iraq invaded
Kuwait, that he would be going to Saudi
Arabia. Last Wednesday, he was moved
from "tent city" to take his place on the
battle line supporting the 101st Air
borne Division.
His mother is the administrative
assistant to Acting Dean of Student
Affairs Norm Robinson. She said that
since she is not a "really politically
aware" person, she cannot venture an
opinion about "what's right" in the Mid

die East. She said she wishes "in her
heart that people could just sit down at a
table and work things out."
Fear and confusion were echoed by
Patricia Welsh, a senior in Biology. Her
brother, Richard, left with his Reserve
unit for the Saudi desert on Jan. 8.
Richard Welsh is second-in-command
of the Military Police unit based in Fort
McCoy, Wis. If war breaks out, he could
be exposed to sniper fire while protecting
supply convoys going into the battlefield,
according to his sister.
At the end of last quarter, she said she
found out that "he was going to be shot
at halfway around the world."
Since "somebody I know is in the line
of fire, the situation has become very dif
ferent and very upsetting," she added.
"It is almost as if a piece of me is going
off and I do not have a choice about it."
"I felt awful," she explained, "because it
had to get to a personal level before I start
ed figuring out what was going on and
reading the news about the Middle East."
