# Building mail relationships with 'Any Soldier'
## 
### Connie Chang 
After reading an article in Newsweek
magazine about Americans corresponding
with friends and relatives serving in Saudi
Arabia, sophomores Sherri Wolson and
Leslie Strate wrote letters of their own,
even though they didn't know any soldiers
personally.
Their letters were addressed to Any Sol
dier," but real people answered back.
Besides "trying to do something nice for
the men and women over there," Strate
said thinking about them being near her

some "basic, general stuff" about herself

Wolson wrote two short letters saying
she hoped the soldiers were doing all right
and would come home safely.
Neither students expected a response,
but each got one. "I was impressed by how
fast they got the letter and how quickly it

got back," Wolson said.
Strate received a cassette tape from her
pen-pal soldier, Edward, who is a native
Californian.
She said she had originally wondered
what the soldiers thought about being in
the Gulf, but her questions were answered
by one soldier first-hand. "I don't mind
being here for my country, but I want to be
home," the soldier said.
She said hearing Edward and his friends,
