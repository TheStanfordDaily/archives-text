# Building mail relationships with 'Any Soldier'
## 
### Connie Chang 
After reading an article in Newsweek
magazine about Americans corresponding
with friends and relatives serving in Saudi
Arabia, sophomores Sherri Wolson and
Leslie Strate wrote letters of their own,
even though they didn't know any soldiers
personally.
Their letters were addressed to Any Sol
dier," but real people answered back.
Besides "trying to do something nice for
the men and women over there," Strate
said thinking about them being near her

age made her really feel for them and want
to write to them.
Wolson said she "felt guilty being a col
lege student living in suburban San Fran
cisco" while her peers were far away in the
Persian Gulf, waiting for a possible war.
Both said they felt gtrange about writing
to people they didn't know, especially to
"Any Soldier."
"It wasn't real personal," Strate said.
Also, neither was sure what to write. "It
seemed like a good idea, but when it came to
doing it, I didn't know what to say," Wolson
said.

Strate wrote her letter on the night after
Big Game, claiming she just saw "the
biggest game of the year." She said she told
some "basic, general stuff" about herself
and explained what students at Stanford
were doing — sleep-outs and fasts — and
"what people here were thinking about
what was going on over there."
Wolson wrote two short letters saying
she hoped the soldiers were doing all right
and would come home safely.
Neither students expected a response,
but each got one. "I was impressed by how
fast they got the letter and how quickly it

got back," Wolson said.
Strate received a cassette tape from her
pen-pal soldier, Edward, who is a native
Californian.
She said she had originally wondered
what the soldiers thought about being in
the Gulf, but her questions were answered
by one soldier first-hand. "I don't mind
being here for my country, but I want to be
home," the soldier said.
She said hearing Edward and his friends,
the wind blowing and trucks going by was

scary. "It brought it close to
home," she added, especially
because the envelope was "cov
ered with dust."
Wolson had similar feelings.
Until receiving letters back, she
said the issues of the Persian Gulf
were "abstract."
The first soldier who received
her letter wrote back saying it
"seemed sexy and you seem very
sensitive," she said.
Another soldier to whom Wol
son wrote had just graduated
from the University of Santa
Clara and is working as a commu
nications technician in Saudi Ara
bia.
She said her correspondence
with him was "more what I was
looking for — telling me what he
was doing. I wasn't necessarily
looking for a boyfriend by mail."

Wolson said she wouldn't mind
continuing contact with the com
munications technician if or when
he came back. Strate has already
suggested a visit to her pen pal,
Edward. She is planning a trip to
Europe this summer, and Edward
was originally stationed in Ger
many.
Strate said the soldiers told her
that letters from Americans at
home really help because letters
"keep them, entertained, give
them something to do." She said
Edward never mentioned family
or friends, so he might not have
any contact with anyone in Amer
ica other than her.
By request, she is sending him
another letter with pictures, and
is recording her own 90-minute
tape of what her day is like, hav
ing her friends introduce them
selves as well.
She said Edward's friends
were yelling in the background of
his tape, "We're all jealous.. ..

Make your friends write!" Strate
said she suspects most of the let
ters they receive are not from 20-
year-old Stanford women.
Both students said they are
glad they are writing, calling it a
wonderful and rewarding experi
ence. Strate said she thinks the
soldiers "need something to hang
onto. [Her pen pal] sounded really
frightened, even though he was
trying to keep up his macho male
image."
Wolson encouraged people to
write to support the soldiers, even
if they "might not agree with the
president's policies." She said it
seems the soldiers have a lot of
spare time and are interested in
hearing from other students.
Letters to the Gulf can be
addressed to: Any Soldier/Air
man, Operation Desert Shield,
APO New York, NY 09848 or Any
Sailor/Marine, Operation Desert
Shield, FPO New York, NY
09866.
