# Scholar works for peace in new ways
## A 						generation after Vietnam, he trades sit-ins for speeches

As a libertarian, Hoover Insti
tution visiting fellow Williamson
Evers is somewhat of an anomaly
— both among the conservatism
of Hoover and the liberalism of
the current anti-war movement.
With his professorial gray
tweed jacket and leather briefcase,
Evers seems as if he would be ill
at-ease in a crowd of anti-war
protesters.
But Bill Evers has spent much
of his life in these circles. As an
anti-war and anti-draft activist at
Stanford at the end of the 19605,
Evers has seen his share of rallies
and sit-ins.
"I pretty much saw the entire
anti-war movement at Stanford,"
he said, from his arrival at Stan
ford in 1966 to his graduation in
1972.
Evers, now a 42-year-old with a
wife and two small children, has
again become active — this time
in a different peace movement a
generation later, giving speeches
at campus rallies and interviews
on radio and television.
"I was more of a rank-and-file
person [during the 19605] and as I
got older I was a middle-level per
son in the anti-war and anti-draft
movements," he said in an inter
view last Thursday.
Evers described his opposition
to military intervention in the

Persian Gulf as being based on his
libertarian values. "The whole lib
ertarian perspective flows out of
the value of the human individual
and respect for human liberty and
property," he said.
"I'm not a pacifist or someone
who rules out all war," he said, but
"libertarians are very concerned
about human lives."
The anti-Vietnam War move
ment, consisting primarily of lib
eral and radical activists, also
included a number of libertarians,
Evers said. The anti-draft move
ment in particular included a dis
proportionate number of libertar
ians, even if many of them agreed
with the war, he said.
The anti-draft movement of
the 1960s in particular included a
number of prominent conserva
tives and libertarians, including
then-Gov. Ronald Reagan, Ari
zona Sen Barry Goldwater and
economist Milton Friedman,
Evers said.
The movement against the
draft "was very big, so it had a
diversity of views," he said.
"Governments are able to put
people into involuntary servitude
like slavery and give it another
name, like the draft," he said.
Evers received his bachelor's
degree in political science in 1972.
He also received his master's
degree from Stanford in 1978 and

his Ph.D. here in 1987, both in
political science.
Evers wrote a column titled
"News in Review" in The Daily for
about six years, using it as his
platform for discussions on the
anti-war and anti-draft move
ments, as well as national and
international events that piqued
his interest.
"I was mainly a Stanford Daily
person," Evers said of his involve
ment in the anti-war movement.
"I was never a crowd-winning
speaker."
Evers ran for student-body
president, similar to today's
Council of Presidents, with
another libertarian in 1970, but
was defeated by a "mainstream
liberal coalition." The election
took place only days before the
U.S. military forces in Vietnam
invaded neighboring Cambodia,
provoking massive demonstra
tions across America.
"It is hard to imagine a campus
with hundreds of police in riot
gear and tear gas," he said. He
noted that The Daily had to keep
stores of gas masks to protect
reporters from the tear gas.
"The campus was polarized,"
Evers said. "If the invasion had
happened before the election, I
think we would have won."
Evers said he does not feel out
of place in a movement where he
is only one of a small number of
libertarians in a liberal crowd.
"[Libertarianism] is a minority
view in America, after all," he
noted.
Leaders of the current anti-war
movement have been receptive to
Evers' involvement in the demon
strations. "They welcome me to
participate," he said.
"[Evers and I] disagree on large
areas of policy, but we both agree
that the United States should not
be in this war," said Kate Morris,
a Stanford member of Democratic
Socialists of America and a lead
ing organizer of the Stanford anti
war movement. "I am prepared to
work with him on that basis," she
said.
"We are committed to having a
diversity of opinion provided it is
opposed to war," she added.
Evers said he disagreed with
the "overwhelming majority" of
Hoover scholars on the Persian
Gulf issue, but stressed that
"there are others at Hoover who
would agree with my position" on
the Gulf.
Hoover Director John Raisian
was not as quick as Evers to cate
gorize the viewpoints of Hoover
scholars on the crisis. "I couldn't
begin to tell you the overall senti
ments of the place," he said.
"Everyone here is hoping like
crazy that war is avoided."
Evers added that he enjoys
complete freedom of expression at
Hoover, despite being in the
minority in regard to his views of
the Gulf crisis. "I enjoy complete
freedom of academic scholarship.
No inhibition to this is expressed
either formally or informally," he
said.

"I think Hoover is academically
as free as they come, " Raisian
added. "On any issue, Hoover pro
duces people who are outspoken. .
.. We tend to have people here
who are often times mavericks in
their views."
"I think that [Evers] has clear
ideas of what he favors in this [cri
sis] and he is very vocal about
that, and I applaud him for that,"
Raisian said.
Evers has appeared at various
demonstrations against the war,
including a candlelight vigil held
in November in White Plaza. In
addition, he appears on radio
shows across the country, mainly
discussing the prospect of a draft.

But he stressed that his
involvement in the anti-war
movement is "purely extracurric
ular. ... I'm a scholar. That's how
I make my living."
He said his interest in the war
"is basically an outgrowth of a
scholarly interest in constitu
tional and political theory and its
application to public policy."
Evers painted a bleak picture of
the near future of the Middle
East. "I foresee fighting between
the two armies," he said, "with a
large number of deaths and casu
alties."
Evers also described a likely
scenario in which Iraq attacks
Israel, forcing the Israelis to retal
iate. The entrance of the Israelis
into the war would force Jordan
and Syria to reassess their role in
the conflict and possibly enter the
war on Iraq's side, he said.
Furthermore, Evers predicted
political instability in a number of
Arab nations, including a possible
overthrow of the Egyptian gov
ernment of President Hosni
Mubarak.
Evers does not, however, expect
the institution of a military draft
in response to the Gulf crisis. "I
don't think it's likely. [The Ameri
can military] has enough people in
the reserves," he said. "The
Department of Defense can pull
people out of Europe if necessary.
He said he does think a draft
could occur in the case of "several
simultaneous crises in which the
U.S. would want to intervene mil
itarily." He cited a possible war
between India and Pakistan that
forces the United States to com
mit troops to the Asian subconti
nent as a scenario in which a draft
might be instituted.
"But we don't know what's
going to happen. Maybe this will
all be over in a couple of days," he
said.
