# Scholar works for peace in new ways

						generation after Vietnam, he trades sit-ins for speeches

As a libertarian, Hoover Insti
tution visiting fellow Williamson
Evers is somewhat of an anomaly
— both among the conservatism
of Hoover and the liberalism of
the current anti-war movement.
With his professorial gray
tweed jacket and leather briefcase,
Evers seems as if he would be ill
at-ease in a crowd of anti-war
protesters.
But Bill Evers has spent much
of his life in these circles. As an
anti-war and anti-draft activist at
Stanford at the end of the 19605,
Evers has seen his share of rallies
and sit-ins.
"I pretty much saw the entire
anti-war movement at Stanford,"
he said, from his arrival at Stan
ford in 1966 to his graduation in
1972.
Evers, now a 42-year-old with a
wife and two small children, has
again become active — this time
in a different peace movement a
generation later, giving speeches
at campus rallies and interviews
on radio and television.
"I was more of a rank-and-file
person [during the 19605] and as I
got older I was a middle-level per
son in the anti-war and anti-draft
movements," he said in an inter
view last Thursday.
Evers described his opposition
to military intervention in the

Persian Gulf as being based on his
libertarian values. "The whole lib
ertarian perspective flows out of
the value of the human individual
and respect for human liberty and
property," he said.
"I'm not a pacifist or someone
who rules out all war," he said, but
"libertarians are very concerned
about human lives."
The anti-Vietnam War move
ment, consisting primarily of lib
eral and radical activists, also
included a number of libertarians,
Evers said. The anti-draft move
ment in particular included a dis
proportionate number of libertar
ians, even if many of them agreed
with the war, he said.
The anti-draft movement of
the 1960s in particular included a
number of prominent conserva
tives and libertarians, including
then-Gov. Ronald Reagan, Ari
zona Sen Barry Goldwater and
economist Milton Friedman,
Evers said.
The movement against the
draft "was very big, so it had a
diversity of views," he said.
"Governments are able to put
people into involuntary servitude
like slavery and give it another
name, like the draft," he said.
Evers received his bachelor's
degree in political science in 1972.
He also received his master's
degree from Stanford in 1978 and
