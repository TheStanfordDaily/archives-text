# What happens if the draft is reinstated
## Twenty-year-olds would get first call 
### Cynthia Benton Staff writer 
As the crisis in the Middle East
continues to escalate, fear of a
reinstated draft has cast an omi
nous shadow over the lives and
futures of many students.
Although avenues for draft
exemption still exist, recent
changes in conscription laws have
made it more difficult than in
Vietnam and other wars.
Should a draft be instituted,
20-year-old men would be con
scripted first, followed by those 21
through 25, respectively. Nineteen
and then 18-year-old men would
be called next. Because the draft
runs on the calendar year, those
who turn 20 between January 1
and December 31 this year would
considered 20 in the draft. A lot
tery of birth dates would be held
to determine the order of drafting
within the calendar year.
Because draft laws passed dur

ing the Carter administration
eliminated deferments for stu
dents, one of the only remaining
routes to avoid combat is to claim
status as a conscientious objector.
As with any other type of defer
ment or exemption, men cannot
apply for conscientious objection
until they receive an induction
order from the military. According
to draft law, after the order is
issued, exemption must be
claimed within 10 days.
Applicants must indicate their
grounds for exemption on a form
available at U.S. postal offices.
According to Donald Wilkinson, a
draft counselor at the San Jose
Peace Center, if the claim is for
conscientious objection, the
armed forces will send the appli
cant a set of written essay ques
tions. After those are completed
and returned, applicants would be

scheduled to appear before a local
draft board for review of their spe
cific cases.
Individuals classified as consci
entious objectors are assigned to
either non-combat duty or "two
years of alternative service in
some civilian agency," according
to literature from the National
Interreligious Service Board for
Conscientious Objectors.
According to Paul Greenblatt, a
draft counselor at the Peninsula
Peace Center, there are "three
essential elements" to a conscien
tious objector case. "First of all,
you must be in opposition to all
war, not just to a particular war.
This belief must have a religious,
moral or ethical basis, and you
must also prove your beliefs are
deeply and sincerely held," Green
blatt said.
Wilkinson said conscientious

objection does not necessarily
require strict pacifism. "You can
still believe in self-defense,"
Wilkinson said. "All you need to be
against is legalized killing."
"Those who plan to file as con
scientious objectors need to start
building a case now," Greenblatt
said. "They need to think about
what they believe in and how their
beliefs relate to war. They need to
do volunteer work such as helping
disadvantaged children or work
ing at a veteran's hospital and
attend peace rallies, so they will be
able to prove they live their lives
according to their beliefs."
"The questions the draft board
asks are going to be hard," he said.
"They might ask, 'If some maniac
were attacking your mother,
would you defend her?' or 'If some
maniac were attacking you, would
you defend yourself?' or 'If the
maniac was Hitler attacking the
