# Military refuses to allow gays to serve
## 
### David Bianco Editorial staff 
Most men in their early 20s
are wondering these days what
they would do in case of a draft,
but one group of men — those
who are gay — may not have
any choice.
The official policy of the
Department of Defense is that
"homosexuality is incompati
ble with military service,"
according to Army Spokesper
son Capt. Barbara Goodno. She
said the Defense Department
maintains that the presence of
gay men in the military "seri
ously impairs the accomplish
ment of the military mission"
by harming morale among
"soldiers who frequently must
live and work under close con
ditions affording minimal pri
vacy."
Several gay students said
they wouldn't mind being
exempted from the armed ser
vices. "If it's that simple, of
course I would use being gay as
a way of exempting myself,"
one 19-year-old sophomore
said. The student, who turns
20 in November, said he would
want to avoid war even if he
wasn't gay.
Goodno said the draft ques
tion is a non-issue because
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
has not asked Congress for a
reinstatement of the draft. But
Goodno did describe the proce
dure by which the army discov
ers if any of its recruits are gay.
New armed forces recruits
are checked for military suit
ability by a military examiner,
which is the same system that
would be used in a draft situa
tion. Goodno said that a gay
man who discloses his homo
sexuality at that time would
not be inducted into the ser
vice.
She also said that if accusa
tions of homosexuality were
made against a recruit, "that
requires investigation."
When a soldier enlists, "part
of the documentation [he]
signs is a statement that he is
not a homosexual." A soldier
who knows he is gay but signs
that statement is considered
fraudulent and can be dis
charged, she added.
Goodno said that on their
enlistment contract, potential
soldiers answer two questions:
"Are you a homosexual or a
bisexual?" and "Do you intend
to engage in homosexual acts?"
The form then explains that

homosexual is defined as "sex
tial desire or behavior directed
at a person (or persons) of
one's own sex. Bisexual is
defined as a person sexually
responsive to both sexes."
According to Lou Brodsky,
assistant director for public
affairs of the Selective Service
system, which conducts the
draft, the military examiner
checks to see that a recruit is
physically fit, morally fit and
mentally fit. The category of
physically unfit "could include
the homosexual determina
tion," he said. A morally unfit
recruit could be someone who
had served jail time, and a
mentally unfit individual could
be someone who failed an intel
ligence test.
A recruit or draftee who is
found "unsuitable for service"
is qualified as M 4F," which
means their service is deferred.
But a "4F has never been
inducted," Brodsky said.
However, the opinion that
the army will continue to
exempt gays from military ser
vice is not unanimous. "Keith,"
a Navy flier at MofTett Field
who has been active in Stan
ford's gay community for more
than a year, said he thought
gays would be included in a
future draft.
"I suspect that what's going
to happen is they will in fact
draft gays into the military and
the military will discharge
them when the war is over," he
said. He said self-identified
gays were overlooked in World
War II and the Vietnam War,
and that he expected a war in
the Persian Gulf to follow the
same course.
Senior Kevin Richardson,
who considers himself fully out
of the closet, said that in the
case of a draft, "I'll let them
know that I'm gay and that
according to their rules, I'm
excluded from the draft. If they
want to press the issue, I have
no problems going to court. I
can't enlist normally, so I'm
not going to enlist now."
Keith, 28, has only disclosed
his homosexuality to a dozen of
his colleagues at Moffett, half
of whom are gay or lesbian
themselves. He knows that
such disclosures are risky
because, "If I came out, I would
be separated from the service
within a week."
Although his field of exper
tise will not require him to go
to the Gulf, he said the line of rea
soning cited by the Defense
Department — that gays in the
service would hurt morale — is
"unfounded."
He added that similar charges
were made when the military
integrated blacks into the armed
forces. In fact, "If I was dis
charged today, there would be a
morale problem with those I work
with for the fact that I was dis
charged."
He said he hopes the military
does take gays into the service in
a future conflict because it would
be "one more nail in the coffin of
the armed services' discrimina
tion policy toward homosexuals."

dure by which the army discov
ers if any of its recruits are gay.
New armed forces recruits
are checked for military suit
ability by a military examiner,
which is the same system that
would be used in a draft situa
tion. Goodno said that a gay
man who discloses his homo
sexuality at that time would
not be inducted into the ser
vice.
She also said that if accusa
tions of homosexuality were
made against a recruit, "that
requires investigation."
When a soldier enlists, "part
of the documentation [he]
signs is a statement that he is
not a homosexual." A soldier
who knows he is gay but signs
that statement is considered
fraudulent and can be dis
charged, she added.
Goodno said that on their
enlistment contract, potential
soldiers answer two questions:
"Are you a homosexual or a
bisexual?" and "Do you intend
to engage in homosexual acts?"
The form then explains that

homosexual is defined as "sex
tial desire or behavior directed
at a person (or persons) of
one's own sex. Bisexual is
defined as a person sexually
responsive to both sexes."
According to Lou Brodsky,
assistant director for public
affairs of the Selective Service
system, which conducts the
draft, the military examiner
checks to see that a recruit is
physically fit, morally fit and
mentally fit. The category of
physically unfit "could include
the homosexual determina
tion," he said. A morally unfit
recruit could be someone who
had served jail time, and a
mentally unfit individual could
be someone who failed an intel
ligence test.
A recruit or draftee who is
found "unsuitable for service"
is qualified as M 4F," which
means their service is deferred.
But a "4F has never been
inducted," Brodsky said.
However, the opinion that
the army will continue to
exempt gays from military ser
vice is not unanimous. "Keith,"
a Navy flier at MofTett Field
who has been active in Stan
ford's gay community for more
than a year, said he thought
gays would be included in a
future draft.
"I suspect that what's going
to happen is they will in fact
draft gays into the military and
the military will discharge
them when the war is over," he
said. He said self-identified
gays were overlooked in World
War II and the Vietnam War,
and that he expected a war in
the Persian Gulf to follow the
same course.
Senior Kevin Richardson,
who considers himself fully out
of the closet, said that in the
case of a draft, "I'll let them
know that I'm gay and that
according to their rules, I'm
excluded from the draft. If they
want to press the issue, I have
no problems going to court. I
can't enlist normally, so I'm
not going to enlist now."
Keith, 28, has only disclosed
his homosexuality to a dozen of
his colleagues at Moffett, half
of whom are gay or lesbian
themselves. He knows that
such disclosures are risky
because, "If I came out, I would
be separated from the service
within a week."
Although his field of exper
tise will not require him to go
to the Gulf, he said the line of rea
soning cited by the Defense
Department — that gays in the
service would hurt morale — is
"unfounded."
He added that similar charges
were made when the military
integrated blacks into the armed
forces. In fact, "If I was dis
charged today, there would be a
morale problem with those I work
with for the fact that I was dis
charged."
He said he hopes the military
does take gays into the service in
a future conflict because it would
be "one more nail in the coffin of
the armed services' discrimina
tion policy toward homosexuals."
