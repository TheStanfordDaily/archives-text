# Diverse anti-war coalition united by its goal
## 
### Michael Friedly Editorial staff 
Although the current anti-war movement
may in many ways resemble the movement of
the Vietnam era, it has taken a different
approach to the crisis, reflecting the lessons
learned from the experience of the 19605.
The composition of the current movement
parallels the coalition assembled by President
Bush, bringing together traditional allies and
former enemies into a broad-based array of
support. While the movement of the 1960s was
fragmented and politically indecisive, the cur
rent movement is a coalition forged on a sin
gle, basic demand on which most groups can
agree: Bring the troops home now.
One of the main differences between the
anti-war movement of the Vietnam era and the
present movement is the absence of the sectar
ianism that hindered the work of activists in
the 19605.
"By 1969 and 1970, you have many sectar
ian socialist groups having a big role in the
anti-war movement," according to Williamson
Evers, a Hoover Institution visiting fellow who
was active in opposing the Vietnam War and
who has spoken against the current confronta
tion. He described these groups as "bitterly
antagonistic toward each other."
"A lot of the sectarian groups are weaker
now," according to Kate Morris, a leader of
Stanford Students for Peace, which has spear
headed the Stanford anti-war movement.
She said many of the more radical groups of
the 1960s are far less powerful today because
of the failure of the Eastern European govern
ments to which many of them looked for mod
els of government.
Leftist groups such as the Revolutionary
Communist Party and the Revolutionary
Workers League have very little influence in
the anti-war movement, and the League of

Revolutionary Struggle, another Marxist-
Leninist group, disbanded in September, she
said.
The radical groups that are still around
"are a lot more willing to work within the con
fines of a coalition," Morris said. "This move
ment is a lot bigger than any one of the
groups."
During the Vietnam era, anti-war leaders
had difficulty rallying the combined forces of
student protesters, the religious community,
civil rights workers and labor movements,
according to Paul George, director of the Mid-
Peninsula Peace Center, the group that orga
nized Saturday's peace rally in Palo Alto.
"The various constituencies were not will
ing to work together," he said.
"All of these groups have the experience of
working together now," which increases the
power of the movement, George said. He said
these groups have been working together
throughout the 1980s, primarily on Central
American issues.
"To me [working together! is the biggest
difference between the anti-war movements"
of the 1960s and the present, George said.
"There's a great deal more coalition-build
ing in the current movement," George said.
"The movement has matured in that it is will
ing to agree on the basic goals, and avoid polit
ical issues that may be divisive," he said.
The movement is based on "a sense of
urgency and a realization of the necessity to be
in the streets," George added.
"There are some deep political differences,
and there is also some consensus that [the dif
ferences! must be suppressed as much as pos
sible," George said.
Evers agreed that the current movement
has remained above sectarian battles. "I don't
have any sense that exclusionary politics are
being practiced," he said. "I sense a desire to
be inclusive."

He also said he did not think the current
movement would deteriorate into sectarian
ism. "I don't think it's a cycle" where sectari
anism will eventually develop, he noted.
Evers attributed some of the strength of the
current movement to a "plateau of experience"
gained through the battles of the 1960s from
which the present leaders can benefit.
"Some of the arguments and attitudes and
leaders still exist, even though that was a very
long time ago," Evers said.
Current anti-war activists said they have
benefited from the experiences of leaders of
the largest mass movement in American his
tory, learning from their mistakes and follow
ing up on their successes.
"[Student leaders from the 19605] have
stuff to learn from the students, and we have
stuff to learn from them," Morris said.
Evers said the role of the Vietnam-era lead
ers can be exaggerated. While many, such as
anti-Vietnam activist Daniel Ellsberg, speak
out against the current confrontation in the
Gulf, few take an active role in the organiza
tion of the movement.
"It's primarily the students" who are run
ning the movement, Evers said.
But George disagreed, saying, "I don't
think I'd agree that the students are leading
this. It is an incredibly broad array. I don't
think any single contingency is leading this."
Morris de-emphasized the role of Vietnam
activists, saying, "They have ideas to con
tribute, but the political culture has changed
since then" and many of their ideas and meth
ods are no longer as valid.
But Morris also stressed that the movement
is not a disjointed one that evaporated after
Vietnam. "It's been a continuous movement,"
she said, working on Central American issues
rather than American military intervention.


Students involved with the anti-war movement say that there is more
coalition-building between different factions today than there was
during the 19605.
"It hasn't been at the level that
it is now," but it has been active,
Morris said.
Evers disputed a commonly
held notion that the movement is
in its infancy and is relatively
weak. "I would say it's actually
strong," he said.
"It's bigger than what I saw in
1966 when I first came to Stan
ford," Evers said. "People are
judging the current anti-war
movement with the height of the
Vietnam movement."

The movement 'is
an incredibly broad
array. I don't think
there is any single
contingency
leading this.'

"That's an absurd compari
son," he said.
"There were several hundred
people out there (at the Nov. 14
night-time rally in White Plaza)
and there hasn't even been a shot
fired," while during Vietnam it
took a number of years during
which there was actual fighting
for such a large movement to
develop, he said.
"And I think that if a draft is
imposed, then there will be a lot
more student interest," he said.
"It's simply amazing what has
come together in five months,"
George said, citing a national
rally in San Francisco planned for
Jan. 26 at which 250,000 people
are expected to gather.
"It took five years to get to that
point during Vietnam," he said.
Another major difference in
the anti-war movements of yes
terday and today is the greater
diversity of the present group.
Whereas the upper echelons of
many anti-war groups of the
19605, most notably the Students
for a Democratic Society, were
composed almost entirely of white
males, the current movement is a
more even balance of women and
people of color.
"We've been really conscious to
do a lot more recruiting of people
of color," Morris said. "And I
think we're being a lot more bal
anced in the gender levels as
well," she said.
"We aim for [diversity] in our
speakers. We aim for it in the
issues that we talk about,"
according to Sherifa Edoga, a
junior who has taken a leading
role in Stanford Students for
Peace.
The organizers have tried to
create an environment in which
"nobody feels that there is noth
ing they can do," she said.
You've got to mobilize every
one if you are going to be success
ful," Morris said, rather than be
exclusionary. "We have got to
work together," she said.
"We all need to continue work
ing together, student and commu
nity alike, in order to bring this to
a conclusion as soon as possible,"
George said.
