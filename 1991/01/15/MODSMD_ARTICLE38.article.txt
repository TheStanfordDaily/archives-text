# 'I'm against all war'
## Senior reservist seeks objector status 
### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Staff writer 
It is January and senior Aim6e Allison's
friends and classmates are contemplating
the future — graduation, jobs, graduate
schools, life after Stanford.
But for Allison, a 21-year-old Army
reservist on alert to report to the Middle
East, the future is now. With issues of life,
death and newly emerged morality on her
mind, Allison is hoping for a discharge from
the Army as a conscientious objector.
"I am fundamentally against all war,
based on the sanctity of life, she explained.
"My objection is not political, but is moral
and religious in nature."
Allison's anti-war morality started to
emerge last August, following a period of
extensive introspection and assessment,
she said. "I started to finally realize that
the military is wrong for me."
In December, the former Council of Pres
idents member began to file the lengthy
paperwork for obtaining a military dis
charge. She submitted to army officials a
14-page letter "mapping out my entire life
ana beliefs," along with letters of recom
mendation, she said.
Now, one month later, Allison has
already interviewed with a military chap
lain — but hers is race a against time. Fur
ther military interviews remain. If she does
not break through the red tape before war
breaks out, Allison will join the other 100
members of her Sunnyvale regiment
already deployed in Saudi Arabia.
"I feel like I am racing the devil," sighed
a concerned Allison.
Allison never envisioned she would be in
her present predicament when she enlisted
in the army reserves in April 1987. The self
described "naive 17-year-old kid" from
Antioch, Calif, filled out the Army's Form
1966 — a requirement for all enlistees.
Question 26 of that form asked if the
applicant had "a firm, fixed and sincere
objection to participating in war in any
form or to the bearing of arms because of

'With the fancy ads and the
strong recruitment, the
Army was really enticing.
Going to Stanford was so
important that I was willing
to do anything to go. The
military was the only
option.'

religious belief or training."
Allison checked the box for "No".
Having worked hard in high school, she
gained acceptance to Stanford, finding her
self like many poor, black youths trying to
finance an education. "With the fancy ads
and the strong recruitment, the Army was
really enticing. Going to Stanford was so
important that I was willing to do anything
to go. The military was the only option,"
Allison recalled.
Allison said her time at Stanford marked
the beginning of the ideological, religious
and moral synthesis and transformation
that brought out her pacifist beliefs.
"Talking to my fellow students helped
me to get together my ideas and taught me
to question and really challenge my
assumption about people and things. I
learned a lot about myself in the process,"
Allison said, toying with a small cross hang
ing from a chain around her neck.
As she began her monthly training
retreats, Allison also began to question her
involvement as a non-combatant medic in
the Army reserve.
"I am trained in triage-prioritizing peo
ple for treatment in the field. Typically the
most injured are the last to receive treat
ment and we are trained to nurse the less
injured so that they can go back and fight,"
she said.


Chris Elsenberg — Daily
Senior Aimee Allison Is trying to obtain conscientious objector status in order to avoid
possible deployment to the Persian Gulf.
"The mission is not preserving
ajl life, but preserving the lives of
the fighter. Human life is not val
ued in the military, only human
life as it can advance the military
ambitions. . . . That is immoral. .
. and I do not want to contribute
to any part of this process of war,"
she said.
Ultimately, Allison's future
will be determined by the mili
tary.
But some individuals half
questioned the sincerity of her
plea. "I believe that when you
enter into an agreement that pays
for your education, you should
fulfill the terms of that obliga
tion," said one senior who asked
not to be identified.
Assoc. Dean of Memorial
Church Floyd Thompkins offered
another point of view: "People
grow, people change. The clarity
of who she was and what was
going on in Aimee's life was not
evident when she was 17. Most of
us would not want to be perma
nently judged by things we did at

17 or 18," he said.
Thompkins, who is serving as
an adviser to Allison during her
attempts to gain discharge,
admitted that her case will be dif
ficult. "All moral battles are diffi
cult and painful, but she is taking
a moral stand and that [difficulty]
is to be expected, if not wel
comed," he said.
But uncertainty of the out
come has made it difficult for Alli
son to plan for the future. A his
tory major and aspiring educator,
Allison was contemplating early
graduation, a Mellon fellowship
and entry into the Stanford
Teacher Education Program.
These days she is more concerned
about her conscientious objector
status and how she will pay her
legal bills.
"When I took the oath of the
military, I was a certain way, but I
am different now. I've learned a
lot about myself in the process.
When you begin to think criti
cally, you question things. What is
right for me? What am I doing
here? What is my role?"
But ultimately she would like
to leave the military behind her.
"For me, the answer means fight
ing for my discharge," she said.
