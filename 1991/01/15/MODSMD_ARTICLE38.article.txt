# 'I'm against all war'
## Senior reservist seeks objector status 
### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Staff writer 
It is January and senior Aim6e Allison's
friends and classmates are contemplating
the future — graduation, jobs, graduate
schools, life after Stanford.
But for Allison, a 21-year-old Army
reservist on alert to report to the Middle
East, the future is now. With issues of life,
death and newly emerged morality on her
mind, Allison is hoping for a discharge from
the Army as a conscientious objector.
"I am fundamentally against all war,
based on the sanctity of life, she explained.
"My objection is not political, but is moral
and religious in nature."
Allison's anti-war morality started to
emerge last August, following a period of
extensive introspection and assessment,
she said. "I started to finally realize that
the military is wrong for me."
In December, the former Council of Pres
idents member began to file the lengthy
paperwork for obtaining a military dis
charge. She submitted to army officials a
14-page letter "mapping out my entire life
ana beliefs," along with letters of recom
mendation, she said.
Now, one month later, Allison has
already interviewed with a military chap
lain — but hers is race a against time. Fur
ther military interviews remain. If she does
not break through the red tape before war
breaks out, Allison will join the other 100
members of her Sunnyvale regiment
already deployed in Saudi Arabia.
"I feel like I am racing the devil," sighed
a concerned Allison.
Allison never envisioned she would be in
her present predicament when she enlisted
in the army reserves in April 1987. The self
described "naive 17-year-old kid" from
Antioch, Calif, filled out the Army's Form
1966 — a requirement for all enlistees.
Question 26 of that form asked if the
applicant had "a firm, fixed and sincere
objection to participating in war in any
form or to the bearing of arms because of

'With the fancy ads and the
strong recruitment, the
Army was really enticing.
Going to Stanford was so
important that I was willing
to do anything to go. The
military was the only
option.'

religious belief or training."
Allison checked the box for "No".
Having worked hard in high school, she
gained acceptance to Stanford, finding her
self like many poor, black youths trying to
finance an education. "With the fancy ads
and the strong recruitment, the Army was
really enticing. Going to Stanford was so
important that I was willing to do anything
to go. The military was the only option,"
Allison recalled.
Allison said her time at Stanford marked
the beginning of the ideological, religious
and moral synthesis and transformation
that brought out her pacifist beliefs.
"Talking to my fellow students helped
me to get together my ideas and taught me
to question and really challenge my
assumption about people and things. I
learned a lot about myself in the process,"
Allison said, toying with a small cross hang
ing from a chain around her neck.
As she began her monthly training
retreats, Allison also began to question her
involvement as a non-combatant medic in
the Army reserve.
"I am trained in triage-prioritizing peo
ple for treatment in the field. Typically the
most injured are the last to receive treat
ment and we are trained to nurse the less
injured so that they can go back and fight,"
she said.
