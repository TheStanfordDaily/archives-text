# Muslims 'dismayed' at possibility of Gulf war
## 
### Cecilia Tom Editorial staff 
Although most Arab nations
have supported the U.S.-led inter
national coalition against Iraq,
the Muslim community at Stan
ford has reservations about U.S.
participation in the current con
flict.
Dean Mulla, a 1983 Stanford
graduate and organizer of an
Islamic Sunday school at Stan
ford, said he is "dismayed" by
Congress' authorization of the use
of force against Iraq. The Gulf cri
sis is "not a world conflict," he
explained.
Stanford Islamic Society presi
dent Abdullahi Bature said the
crisis must be dealt with by Mus
lims alone, as ordered by the
Koran.
Sura 49:9 of the Koran reads,
"If two parties among the believ
ers fall into a quarrel, make ye
peace between them. But if one of
them transgresses beyond bounds
against the other, then fight ye all
against the one that transgresses
until it complies with the com
mand of God."
Bature said he thought Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein would
never invade Saudi Arabia
because it is home to two Islamic
holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
All the Muslims in the world
would come against him if he did,
he said.
The Islamic Society, which has
about 100 members, issued a
statement last month condemn
ing "any offensive military action
by the United States against Iraq"

and expressing concern about
"double standards" the U.S. gov
ernment applies in the Middle
East.
The statement claims that
these double standards include
U.S. ties with Syrian President
Hafez al-Assad, a longtime enemy
of the United States before the
current crisis, and its support for
Israel's occupation of the West
Bank and Gaza strip.
Hossam El-Bibany, vice presi
dent of the Islamic society,
denounced Saddam's aggression
but did not articulate specific
methods to solve the crisis.
However, he stressed that a
solution must rid the region of
dictatorship and monarchy. He
also said sanctions are not ideal
because innocent people will suf
fer.
El-Bibany also criticized Presi-

we do? We pray.'

dent Bush for trying to create a
new world order based on Ameri
can values. "Who gave [the Amer
icans] the right?"
He said a Muslim solution does
not preclude Western participa
tion. The rest of the world can
help once the Muslims make a
decision, he said.
Only Saddam and his followers
should be punished, Bature said.
Because the Iraqi leader has killed
other Muslims, his life should be
taken from him, he added.
Mulla, however, said sanctions
make a "reasonable" solution and
should be given time to work.
Even though Saddam seems
uncompromising when facing
imminent war, the people will get
frustrated and overthrow him "if
they are hurting bad enough," he
said.

Hazim Ansari, a junior from
Chicago, said he is frustrated by
people who do not distinguish
between the Islamic religion and
the current crisis. He stressed
there is a difference between a
Muslim conflict and a conflict
with Muslims fighting each other.
Junior Mohamed Ali said the
current crisis is of the latter kind
— a "socio-economic-political"
conflict. "It's not a question of
uniting Muslims" against Sad
dam, he said.
"[Saddam'si past actions have
not held up to islamic principles
at all," Ansari said. "They have
indicated that he is a secular
leader."
He added that as a Muslim, he
does not have the right to address
the "political issue" of linkage of
the current crisis to the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict. "My whole
point is to depoliticize Islam."
"A lot of religions have been
victimized throughout history"
when leaders use them to justify
political issues, Ali lamented.
"It's a good point to let the
world know [Israeli is the main
problem of the Middle East. It's
kind of a continuation of World
War II," he added.
A group of Palestinian women
attending a Sunday Muslim gath
ering in Building 60 echoed simi
lar sentiments. "It's linkage 100
percent, because Israelis live in
the heart of the Arabic world" and
the United States is fighting a war
for Israel, one of them said.
The women did not wish to be

identified.
Another said reports of Iraq's
aggression have been exaggerated
because the Kuwaitis were not
forced out of the country. She
stressed that they have plenty of
money and were "driving Mer
cedes and BMWs" when they left.
She added that most Kuwaitis
were on vacation in the United
States and Europe when Iraq
attacked, and it was their servants
who stole all their wealth.
The women said they support
the Palestinian Liberation Orga
nization and would favor linking
the Israeli-Palestinian issue now
because they want their country
back. "We didn't come from
Mars," one said.
Although Bature admitted that
if Saddam attacks Israel now, it
would not be "for the sake of
God," he said Saddam could
repent and legitimately fight
against Israel.
While Mulla conceded that
many Muslims prefer linking the
issues, he said neither the United
States nor Israel should take part
in the conflict. Even if Israel is
attacked, the United States
should not get involved because
Israel has its own armed forces, he
said.
"That's what we've been pay
ing billions of dollars for."
Bature, Ansari and Mulla all
stressed that Islam is a religion of
peace and therefore they do not
wish to see war. "For us, as Mus
lims, what do we do? We pray,"
Bature said.

Hazim Ansari, a junior from
Chicago, said he is frustrated by
people who do not distinguish
between the Islamic religion and
the current crisis. He stressed
there is a difference between a
Muslim conflict and a conflict
with Muslims fighting each other.
Junior Mohamed Ali said the
current crisis is of the latter kind
— a "socio-economic-political"
conflict. "It's not a question of
uniting Muslims" against Sad
dam, he said.
"[Saddam'si past actions have
not held up to islamic principles
at all," Ansari said. "They have
indicated that he is a secular
leader."
He added that as a Muslim, he
does not have the right to address
the "political issue" of linkage of
the current crisis to the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict. "My whole
point is to depoliticize Islam."
"A lot of religions have been
victimized throughout history"
when leaders use them to justify
political issues, Ali lamented.
"It's a good point to let the
world know [Israeli is the main
problem of the Middle East. It's
kind of a continuation of World
War II," he added.
A group of Palestinian women
attending a Sunday Muslim gath
ering in Building 60 echoed simi
lar sentiments. "It's linkage 100
percent, because Israelis live in
the heart of the Arabic world" and
the United States is fighting a war
for Israel, one of them said.
The women did not wish to be

identified.
Another said reports of Iraq's
aggression have been exaggerated
because the Kuwaitis were not
forced out of the country. She
stressed that they have plenty of
money and were "driving Mer
cedes and BMWs" when they left.
She added that most Kuwaitis
were on vacation in the United
States and Europe when Iraq
attacked, and it was their servants
who stole all their wealth.
The women said they support
the Palestinian Liberation Orga
nization and would favor linking
the Israeli-Palestinian issue now
because they want their country
back. "We didn't come from
Mars," one said.
Although Bature admitted that
if Saddam attacks Israel now, it
would not be "for the sake of
God," he said Saddam could
repent and legitimately fight
against Israel.
While Mulla conceded that
many Muslims prefer linking the
issues, he said neither the United
States nor Israel should take part
in the conflict. Even if Israel is
attacked, the United States
should not get involved because
Israel has its own armed forces, he
said.
"That's what we've been pay
ing billions of dollars for."
Bature, Ansari and Mulla all
stressed that Islam is a religion of
peace and therefore they do not
wish to see war. "For us, as Mus
lims, what do we do? We pray,"
Bature said.

Although most Arab nations
have supported the U.S.-led inter
national coalition against Iraq,
the Muslim community at Stan
ford has reservations about U.S.
participation in the current con
flict.
Dean Mulla, a 1983 Stanford
graduate and organizer of an
Islamic Sunday school at Stan
ford, said he is "dismayed" by
Congress' authorization of the use
of force against Iraq. The Gulf cri
sis is "not a world conflict," he
explained.
Stanford Islamic Society presi
dent Abdullahi Bature said the
crisis must be dealt with by Mus
lims alone, as ordered by the
Koran.
Sura 49:9 of the Koran reads,
"If two parties among the believ
ers fall into a quarrel, make ye
peace between them. But if one of
them transgresses beyond bounds
against the other, then fight ye all
against the one that transgresses
until it complies with the com
mand of God."
Bature said he thought Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein would
never invade Saudi Arabia
because it is home to two Islamic
holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
All the Muslims in the world
would come against him if he did,
he said.
The Islamic Society, which has
about 100 members, issued a
statement last month condemn
ing "any offensive military action
by the United States against Iraq"

and expressing concern about
"double standards" the U.S. gov
ernment applies in the Middle
East.
The statement claims that
these double standards include
U.S. ties with Syrian President
Hafez al-Assad, a longtime enemy
of the United States before the
current crisis, and its support for
Israel's occupation of the West
Bank and Gaza strip.
Hossam El-Bibany, vice presi
dent of the Islamic society,
denounced Saddam's aggression
but did not articulate specific
methods to solve the crisis.
However, he stressed that a
solution must rid the region of
dictatorship and monarchy. He
also said sanctions are not ideal
because innocent people will suf
fer.
El-Bibany also criticized Presi-
