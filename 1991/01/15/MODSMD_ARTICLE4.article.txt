# Daily poll: Slim majority opposes U.S.-led Gulf offensive
## 
### John Louie Editorial staff 
More than half of Stanford stu
dents oppose a U.S.-led military
offensive against Iraq if Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein does
not remove his forces from
Kuwait by today's U.N.-imposed
deadline, a Daily poll has found.
In addition, 68 percent of Stan
ford students said they oppose the
institution of a military draft to
increase American forces in the
Gulf, and only about 45 percent of
Stanford male U.S. citizens said
they would report for military ser
vice as ordered if a draft were
instituted.
Today's United Nations dead
line for Iraqi troops to leave
Kuwait comes only two days after
U.N. Secretary General Javier
Perez de Cuellar left Baghdad
after peace talks failed. After
today, the Security Council has
authorized a U.S.-led multina
tional force to use force to oust
Iraq, which invaded Kuwait on
Aug. 2.
Only 35 percent of Stanford
students said they support a U.S.-

led military offensive against Iraq
if Hussein fails to comply with the
Jan. 15 deadline. While men were
almost evenly split over the issue,
almost two-thirds of the female
students polled oppose the mili
tary strike.
The Daily polled 650 students
by phone Sunday and Monday
evenings. Every 10th student in
the Stanford Directory was cho
sen to participate in the poll. The
overall margin of error was 3.9
percent.
The number of students favor
ing a Gulf offensive is lower than
the figures for the general popula
tion from nationwide polls. A
recent Los Angeles Times Poll
found Americans to be evenly
divided between giving more time
for economic sanctions to work
and attacking Iraq after the dead
line.
Fifty-four percent of 2,434
adults polled last week by The
Times said the United States
would be justified in undertaking
"a mqjor war" either to "restore
the previous Kuwaiti govern
ment" or to "destroy Iraq's
nuclear and chemical weapons."

In addition, 47 percent of those
polled by The Times unequivo
cally agreed that the United
States-* 1 should go to war" after
today's deadline.
Among both men and women

at Stanford, a majority oppose the
institution of a U.S. military draft.
Fewer than 17 percent of the stu
dents polled support conscription.
Among U.S. citizens, 72 per
cent oppose an American military

draft while only 16 percent sup
port it.
Because of changes to draft law
made during the Carter adminis
tration, a new draft resolution
would not allow student defer

ment, a marked difference from
6>licy during the Vietnam war.

Of the 344 male U.S. citizen
students polled, 156 said they
would report for military service if
ordered to comply with a draft
notice, 61 said they would apply
for status as a conscientious objec
tor, 26 said they would refuse to
report for service and 75 said they
either didn't know or had no opin

of male U.S. citizens.
Of the 650 students polled, 230

favor a United States-led strike
against Iraq, 336 oppose an offen

the situation. One hundred nine
students support a military draft
and 438 students oppose a draft.
Respondents were almost
evenly split among graduate and
undergraduate students. Sixty
nine percent were male and 79
percent were U.S. citizens.
The margin of error was 4.7 for
the male population and 7 percent

margin of error was 5.4 percent
for male students who were also
