## War may create conflicting loyalties

Does the young Jewish male have an obligation to
serve in Operation Desert Shield, one outcome of
which is the defense of Arab countries hostile to
Israel? The question is perplexing to Jewish Stan
ford students, some of whom feel serving the United
States has priority over Arab-Israeli issues.
"I'm an American first, not an Israeli, and I'll do
what my country wants me to do," said Brandon
Shaffer, a sophomore in Navy ROTC. As far as other
students are concerned, "it's an individual matter,"
he said.
"First and foremost, as an American citizen I
would be fighting to defend the interests of the
United States," said Joe Dobrin, a senior in interna
tional relations. "My second concern would be the
welfare of Israel."
While the defense of certain Arab states has often
been given as a motivation for the use of force
against Iraq, "I wouldn't envision myself as fighting
on behalf ot Kuwait or Saudi Arabia," Dobrin said.
Senior Keith Rabois sees the potential threat a
strong Iraq poses for Israel as motivation for the use
of force against Saddam Hussein. "As a Jpw, I d be

troops.
To some students, tension between being an
American and being a Jew is not as easy to resolve.
If a draft is implemented, "I don't know what I'd
do," said Daniel Lipkin, a senior in computer science.
"The army would be such a different situation."
A visiting professor from Bar-llan University in
Jerusalem, Andre Htydu, recommended to Jewish
students that they look to their Jewish experiences
to help determine their stance on Persian Gulf
issues.
"You have to understand where you are and who
you are," he said. "To be a Jew is not only to be born
Jewish."
