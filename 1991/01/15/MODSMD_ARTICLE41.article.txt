# Grad compiles poems for peace

President Bush appealed to col
lege students last week with
words about the possibility of war
Some of those students are
responding with poems about
peace.
Former Stanford student Greg
Cumberford is collecting poetry,
prose and art by Stanford stu
dents, faculty and staff on the Per
sian Gulf crisis. He will compile
this creative work into a "chroni
cle," as yet untitled, of Stanford
voices for peace.

The project is a col
lection of poetry,
prose and art by
Stanford students,
faculty and staff.

"My interest is in providing a
conduit for the creative interests
in the Stanford community," said
25-year-old Cumberford, who
works in the communications
office at Environmental Health
and Safety.
"I want diversity ... Islamic,
environmental, feminist (view
points), a perspective from some
one with a family member
involved in combat," Cumberford
explained.
But he emphasized that how
ever diverse, he will include only
voices for peace. "I'm not inter
ested in giving voice to those who
want war," he said.
The idea for the chronicle grew
out of Cumberford's own need to
express his thoughts on the crisis
and his conviction that others
must feel the same way.
His firm opposition to war
stems from his humanist beliefs.
Cumberford, who majored in envi
ronmental earth sciences, said he
also fears the impact of war on the
earth's balance. He added that he
favors "an Arab solution to this
Arab crisis."

'Our responsibility as
contemporaries of
those soldiers —
we're the same age
as they are — is to
support bringing
them home.'

Cumberford clearly stated his
own position on a possible draft.
"I would go to jail.. . rather than
fight a war I have no faith in,"he
said.
The chronicle will echo this
desire for peace. When it is fin
ished, Cumberford might sell it
and contribute the proceeds to
peace efforts by student groups at
Stanford and elsewhere.
But he said his real goal is to
send the chronicle to the troops in
the Persian Gulf, as a gesture of
solidarity with those who will suf
fer most from war.
"Our responsibility as contem
poraries of those soldiers — we're
the same age as they are — is to
support bringing them home," he
said.
So far, Cumberford has col
lected about 13 poems, short
essays and speeches dropped off
by students in a box in the ASSU
lobby. He calls these contributions
"very honest, ... nothing face
tious or rude, things coming from
people's hearts and minds."
And student reaction to the
idea seems positive, despite the
relatively few contributors. Coun
cil of Presidents member Jamie
Green, who contributed to the
chronicle, said at the moment
many students confide their feel
ings in diaries which could prove a
rich source of material for the
chronicle in future.
"This could be the start of a
very long war," Green said. "What
Greg is doing could be some docu
ment of that history, of people's
thoughts and feelings, ... some
thing really special and big."
