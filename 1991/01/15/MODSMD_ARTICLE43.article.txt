## NCAA might be helping 
### 
I hate to say this — I mean, I really hate it,
so much that I'm wondering if I can say it
and still be able to look at myself in the mir
ror — but I guess I just don't have a choice.
If I'm going to rip on people when they do
something stupid, I guess I have a moral obli
gation (who, me?) to say when I think they've
done something sort-of commendable. And so,
here we go:
The NCAA did something intelligent.
No, I can't believe it either.
Now, before you get all worked up about
this, let me just add that what the NCAA did
last week — when they finally decided to start
reining in collegiate athletic budgets — wasn't
extremely intelligent. In fact, some of the side
effects of this semi-commendable deed will
actually be disastrous for a few people. Others
may screw up a lot of minor sports. (Hey, it's
the NCAA: Something about every piece of its
legislation has to be stupid. It's one of the
bylaws.)

But, darnit, even with all the inanity
involved, I just can't help but think that what
the NCAA did at its annual convention will
actually (wow!) help college athletics instead of
screwing it up even more.
I may have to get some therapy because of
this. What the heck am I supposed to do, now
that the last great refuge for idiotic legislation
(west of Washington, D.C.) has finally done
something right?
Actually, the results of last week's conven
tion probably weren't newsworthy — I'm
pretty sure something else kind of major
has been going on — but they're still
significant as a kind of symbolic first step.
The NCAA finally proved (I think) that its
goal is to clean up the college sports world. The
problem is, some of the ways it's doing it are
going to cause more problems than they solve.
And so, toward our usual goal of providing
complete, objective, thoroughly-investigated.
information, here's a handy reference guide to
what happened, what didn't, and what should
have at last week's big bash:
Athletic Dorms: They're history. With
amazing astuteness, the NCAA realized that,
gee, athletes probably don't need to live in the
Tty Mahal in order to suffer through the day
to-day rigors of college sports. Winners: The
average students who get to move in. Athletic
budgets. Losers: Athletes (surprise). All those
Oklahoma football players who won't have
anyplace to store their machine guns.
Training table: Oh no! From now on, foot
ball players et al. will get no more than one
steak, steak and more steak meal per day at
athletic departments' expense. Winners: Ath
letic budgets. Losers: Caterers. Athletes
(again), who now have to eat with normal folk.
Scholarships: Across-the-board, 10 per
cent reductions in every sport. Football goes
from 95 scholarships to 85, basketball from 15
to 13. This seems like a great money saver, but
I've got two questions: (1) How is this going to
help clean up the cheating that goes on? and (2)
Why the heck should water polo and swimming
teams lose members just because football and
basketball budgets have gone through the
roof?
Winners: Stanford Athletics, which will save
a cool half million a year. Athletic budgets
everywhere. Losers: Athletes (yet again). The
10 guys who play fourth-string special teams.
What'd they ever do to anyone?
Coaches: Teams will have to reduce the
number of assistant coaches by at least one
(and, in the case of baseball, two). i\ha! Clearly,
everything that is wrong with college athletics
stems from the fact that, dammit, we've got too
many coaches! Winners: Athletic budgets. The
labor supply. Losers: Several hundred assistant
coaches, who are about to do wonders for the
unemployment rate. Athletes (of course) who
actually learned from their coaches. College
baseball.
Practice time: The NCAA was considering
a proposal that would have strictly limited an
athlete's time spent in practice, games and
meetings to 20 hours a week in season and
eight hours a week in the off-season (except for
spring football).
The 20-hour rule, aside from being next-to
impossible to enforce (What, are athletes going
to have to punch a timeclock?), would have led
to a mass exodus of Olympians from college
sports. Now, with a "you-can-practice-more-if
it's-voluntary" clause, the Olympians can stay
... and just about everyone (except football
players) will be able to fit through the loophole.
Can you imagine Bobby Knight telling his
players about a "voluntary" practice? Come on.
Winners: Athletes who need (or want) more
time to study. Maybe. Losers: Civil liberties.
Athletes who er\joy playing.
I guess all the legislation was well-intended,
but the NCAA might think about doing some
thing for, instead of to, all the athletes at next
year's convention. I wonder, though, what the
NCAA really cares about.
There were two academic-reform proposals
brought before the convention. One would
have required a 50 percent athlete graduation
rate for a school to stay in Division I. The other
would have required minimum GPAs for all
athletes at certain stages of their careers.
Both were defeated.

Cameron Macky still hates to say it.
