# Three spikers chosen for U.S. B Team
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
As the Stanford women's volleyball team
posted a 27-4 record and achieved a No. 3
national ranking this past season, a lot of
the credit went to three players, Amy
Cooper, Kristin Klein and Bev Oden.
The praise was justified after the season
when Oden was named the college Player of
the Year, Klein was picked as a first-team
Ail-American and Cooper joined her team
mates on the all-conference team. Now, one
month after the season ended, those three
are at it again.
They were among the 106 players
invited to Colorado Springs, Colo., to try
out for the United States National B Team
last week, and when all was said and done,
the three were on the 16-woman squad.
The team will meet for a training session
July 1 in Colorado Springs, and after about
two weeks of practice, 12 players will be
selected. That team will represent this
country first at the World University
Games in London, and then at the Pan-Am
Games in Havana.
"This whole thing is overwhelming,"
Cooper said, "and I haven't stopped smiling
all day. I can't wait to go."
The tryouts began Friday with three
practices. "It was kind of hard because
there were a lot of people there who were
not as skilled as I would have expected
them to be for a B Team tryout," Cooper
said. "It was OK, but not great."
After two sessions, the three Stanford
players and some others were exempted
from the evening practice. Then, before the
first session Saturday, the roster was
trimmed to 44 players.
"It was a much better practice Saturday
morning. We scrimmaged then — kind of
like a mini-tournament," Cooper contin
ued. "It's so much easier for me to play bet
ter when I'm playing with good players and
against good players."
The team's coach, Mike Hebert of Illi
nois, and the selection committee cut down
to 28 for the second session Saturday and
the one morning session Sunday. Then

This whole thing is over
whelming and I haven't
stopped smiling all day. I
can't wait to go.'
— Amy Cooper

Hebert, his assistants — USC's Lisa Love
and Pitt's Sue Woodstra — and others
selected the find 16 players.
"I thought they were really fair to peo
ple," Cooper said. "The team we ended up
with, I think we're the beet people. Having
Don (Shaw, the Stanford coach) there, I
think, helped us realize how fair it was. He
got to listen in on everything and he said it
was really fair."
In addition to the three Cardinal players,
five UCLA Bruins made the squad. Repre
senting the NCAA champs were Julie
Bremner, Jenny Evans, Marissa Hatchett,
Natalie Williams and Elaine Youngs.
Hawaii, with Cheri Boyer and Karrie Tri
eschman, and USC, with Megan McCallis
ter and Lonise Norfleet.
Also on the team are Tricia Bowen of
Rice, Val Novak of Nebraska, Danielle Scoot
of Long Beach State and Barb Willis of
lowa.
While they are in impressive company,
the three Cardinal players have
outstanding credentials of their own. Oden,
a sophomore from Irvine, Calif., was named
the NCAA Player of the Year last month.
She was also named a first-team Ail-Ameri
can for the second straight year.
Klein, a junior from Pacific Palisades,
Calif., was a first-team All-American last
fall. She had previously been a first-teamer
her freshman year and was a second-team
selection as a sophomore.
Cooper, of Aurora, 111., was the Pacific 10
Conference leader in hitting percentage.
Last year. She earned all-Pac-10 honors for
the second time in her three-year career.
