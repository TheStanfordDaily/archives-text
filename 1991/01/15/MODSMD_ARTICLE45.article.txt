# Men's gymnastics grabs third place in meet
## 
### Janet Feldstein Staff writer 
Less than a week after winter quar
ter began its rain over the Stanford
campus, the men's gymnastics team
swung into action with a meet at San
Jose State. The Cardinal took third in
the two-day competition on Friday and
Saturday.
The team finished at 272.40, behind
New Mexico with 274.75 and lowa
with 273.45. While coach Sadao
Hamada was pleased with the team's
overall results, he expects much higher
points in meets to come.
"This was our first competition as a
team," Hamada said. "I think we will
be able to score more than 280 or even

285 by the end of the season — which
will be enough to win NCAAs."
Freshman Chris Sey echoed his
coach's sentiments. "We don't plan on
finishing in such a position in future
meets," Sey said. "In the next few
weeks the losses won't be apparent."
Both Sey and sophomore Jair Lynch
believe the recent return from vaca
tion is partly to blame for the disap
pointing finish. Lynch said that
although it was rough to compete right
after vacation, the meet was really a
warm-up meet — not critical, but
intended to give the freshmen experi
ence.
"The meet was a hint [to the fresh
men! of what's going to happen,"
Lynch said. "They've done really well,

and they're going to show people what
they're capable of in the coming
weeks."
Hamada also said the team could
have placed better last weekend. "If 1
had prepared them to beat other
teams, we would have won," Hamada
said. "But I didn't because our long
term goals are winning the Pac-lOs
and the NCAAs."
Lynch agreed that the team's goal is
a good finish at the championships,
and thinks that the Cardinal could eas
ily place in the top six. He cited
Nebraska and UCLA as m£gor com
petitors this season.
While the overall results may have
been disappointing to some, the indi
vidual performances were excellent.

"Individually, there were very good
surprises from the athletes, especially
Marc Booth," Hamada said. "Marc's
all-around score of 56-plus is very out
standing for his first collegiate compe
tition as a freshman. Anything above
55 is good, and Marc was way beyond
56 which is just fantastic."
Booth placed second Saturday in
the all-around with 110.60. Lynch also
placed in the all-around.
"I was also pleased with the perfor
mances of Tim Wang on pommel horse
with a 9.4, Chris Sey on rings with a
9.55 and parallel bars with a 9.35, and
Jason Cohen and Lynch on highbar
(9.35 and 9.4 respectively)," Hamada
said. "All these showings were excel
lent."
