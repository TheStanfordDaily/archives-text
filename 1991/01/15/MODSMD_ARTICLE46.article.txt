## Birch-Graham forced to forfeit doubles final 
### Gretchen Atwood Staff writer 
The National Collegiate Tennis
Championships were good news
and bad news for Stanford's men's
and women's tennis teams. The
women dominated the tourna
ment while the men struggled a
bit, not placing a finalist in singles
or doubles.
Debbie Graham, the No. 2 seed,
did not lose a set while steam -
rolling the competition. She won
the women's singles title with a 6-
1, 6-2 rout of Trisha Laux from
use.
"In the first couple of rounds I
played pretty well but didn't feel
on top of my game," said Graham.
"My confidence went up after
every match."
Her closest match was against
Duke's Julie Exum in the semifi
nal. Exum stretched Graham to 7-
5 in the second set after losing the
first set 6-2.
"It was a nervous match. I
wasn't playing as well as I could. I
was thinking too far ahead about
who I'd play in the finals, Sandra
(Birch) or Trisha," said Graham.
Laux defeated Stanford's Birch in
the semifinals 6-2, 6-3.
Birch and Graham won three
matches in straight sets en route
to the doubles finals. The only
team to test them was Vickie
Paynter and Carla Cossa from
Texas. The Longhorn pair lost to
Birch and Graham 6-3, 7-6 in the
first round.
"The doubles was shaky at
first. We hadn't played matches
together since the Ail-American
tournament. We were playing like
singles, not as a team," said
Graham. "We were kind of run
ning into each other but we got
back into form."
They had to default the doubles
final to UCLA'b Kim Po and
Kirsten Dreyer because of time
constraints. Due to television
scheduling the singles semifinals,
finals, ana doubles finals were all
played Sunday.

"The last flight out of Palm
Springs was at 6:30 and if we had
played we would never have made
it," explained Graham. "Because
of budget cuts we couldn't pay for
a different flight."
The other Cardinal doubles
team, Heather Willens and Emma
Woodhouse, lost in the first round
6-4, 6-3 to Oklahoma State's
Monika Waniek and Jackie Booth.
Willens made it to the singles
quarterfinals before losing to
Exum 6-2, 1-6, 6-3.
The quarterfinals were as far
as the Stanford men got in the sin
gles draw. Alex O' Brien lost to
UCLA's David Nainken 2-6, 6-2,
6-4 after blowing away his oppo
nents in straight sets in the first
two rounds. Jared Palmer lost to
eventual champion Mark Knowles
of UCLA in the quarterfinals 7-6,
6-1.
"I played some of my best ten
nis of the season so far," Palmer
said. "He was on top of his game
and came up with big shots in the
first set."
Palmer teamed up with Glenn
Solomon to reach the doubles
semifinals along with teammates
O'Brien and Jason Yee. Nainken
and Knowles of UCLA beat
O'Brien and Yee 2-6, 6-2, 6-3.
USC's Byron Black and Brian
MacPhie defeated Palmer and
Solomon 6-4, 6-4.
"Glenn and Jared played pretty
well together considering they
hadn't played together before,"
said Cardinal coach Dick Gould.
Gould also thought Solomon
played well in singles. After losing
in the first round he won three
matches to reach the consolation
finals. UCLA's Billy Behrens had
food poisoning and defaulted the
final to Solomon, who also won
the consolation title last year.
In other singles action Yee lost
a close three-setter to
Pepperdine's Howard Joffe.
The tournament results were,
"About what you'd expect after
not practicing for about a month,"
Gould said.
