# Women gymnasts open with a loss
## Cardinal posts good score in defeat 
### Patrick Tower Staff writer 
This weekend in Fullerton,
two women's gymnastics teams
with similar looks showed that
they may be headed in opposite
directions.
Cal State-Fullerton, a
perennial powerhouse in the
sport, defeated Stanford by a
score of 184.75 to 182.65.
Afterward, however, Titan
coach Lynn Rogers told the
Cardinal's Breck Greenwood,
"This may be the last time we
beat you guys."
The reason for such an out
look is that Fullerton, compet
ing with routines which will be
used for the remainder of the
season, has limited upward
mobility. Stanford, on the other
hand, can add as much as five
points to its base score with the
return from injury of high
scoring sophomore Erin
McCann and an increase in the
difficulty of other gymnasts'
routines.
"We were basically compet
ing safe in this meet," Green
wood said. "We could increase
our score by three to four
points in difficulty alone." In
addition, the home gym can
sometimes account for more
than a point difference
between the scores.
Freshmen contributed a
large part of Stanford's scor
ing, helping the Cardinal to its
highest opening-meet point
total in recent history.
Kerri Kanuka, who hails
from Regina, Saskatchewan,
led the first-timers with an all
around score of 37.2 and a
third-place finish. Her 9.55
also landed her a tie for second
place on bars.
Senior Jennifer Bloom also
scored well, tallying 36.8 on
consistent scoring. She had
marks of 9.15 in three of the

four events after starting with
a 9.35 on bars.
Mollie Brown, Kerrie Kelley
and Laurie West also competed
in all-around in their Cardinal
debuts, joining senior special
ists Julie Dunhill (bars and
vault) and Marietta Frey
(beam). Frey made the most of
her brief appearance — her
9.35 was second-highest on the
team.
One of the outstanding per
formances of the meet was
turned in by Kelley, a product
of St. Charles, Mo. She started
her Cardinal career with a
first-place tie on beam with a
score of 9.45.
Scoring aside, the gymnasts
performed at the level which
Greenwood expected of them.
14 1 was pleased with our perfor
mance. There were no real sur
prises — we did what we've
done in practice."
Interestingly, neither team
included a junior. Stanford's
last representative of the class
of *92, Nicki Kobrine, was
forced to retire from gymnas
tics in December due to several
back ailments.
The injuries to McCann and
Kobrine are accepted as part of
the world of gymnastics, but
ir\juiy has hit the Titans even
harder, adding to their bleak
outlook.
During the offseason the
Titans lost three gymnasts to
season-ending injuries. They
were able to fill a reserve spot
with a student trainer who had
a gymnastics background, but
one more injury may threaten
to end the team's season.
Barring such an occurence,
Stanford will face the Titans
next at the Utah Invitational in
six weeks. More immediately,
the Cardinal will take on Cali
fornia at Harmon Gym this
Friday at 7:30 p.m.
