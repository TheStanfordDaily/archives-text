# Freshman Richetelli wins diving title

### Chris Crader Ace reporter 
After coming to Stanford as the
top recruit in the nation, diver
Eileen Richetelli has managed to
live up to her billing.
Last week, at the Austin Ail-
American Cup at the Texas Swim
ming Center in Austin, Texas,
Richetelli brought home the
three-meter title to lead a strong
contingent of Stanford divers.
"I felt pretty strong and I felt
pretty consistent," said the fresh
man from Milford, Conn. "Over
all, though, I think there are still
some things I have to work on.
There are just certain things on
certain dives I have to get down."
The competition began with 69
of the top divers in the nation.

After the field was narrowed
down, the top eight collegiate
divers qualified for the finals.
After qualifying sixth,
Richetelli went on to finish sec
ond, behind the University of
Houston's Linda Pesek. The next
day, in a unique twist, the top 16
divers from the previous day's
qualifying were brought together
again.
This time, they were divided in
a cup format, with four groups of
four divers and the top two
advanced. Richetelli won both her
quarterfinal and semifinal groups
and then captured the cup title by
defeating Arizona State's Janae
Lautenschlager, Brigham Young's
Amy Matheson and LSU's Kelly
Hill.
Richetelli did not fare as well in

the one-meter competition as she
did not make the final round. "I
don't know what happened," she
said. "I just had a really bad meet.
I definitely didn't dive the way I
had been diving."
Stanford's Melisa Kuller,
Kristin Jensen and Brad Wight
man also competed very well at
the meet, placing highly. Those
three did not stay for the cup por
tion of the format as Kuller and
Jensen returned to the Farm for a
dual meet against Michigan while
Wightman stayed in Austin to
compete with the Cardinal against
the Longhorns.
While the men's team is cur
rently struggling with a rash of
injuries, the Stanford women's
team is the best it has ever been.
The addition of Richetelli gives

Stanford a diver capable of win
ning an NCAA title at any time.
Meanwhile Kuller and Jensen,
both juniors, have been improving
throughtout their careers here
and both have the ability to score
highly at the NCAA champi
onships in two months.
Kuller and Jensen combined to
score 25 points in Stanford's 222-
78 won over the Wolverines Satur
day and Richetelli is waiting to get
in on the act as well. "I hope to do
well in the dual meets," she said.
"I feel pretty strong. I don't know
what to think about as far as Pac
10s and NCAAs. I just want to
keep improving."
They will next have the chance
in a week and a half, when the
Cardinal women compete at Ari
zona and Arizona State.
