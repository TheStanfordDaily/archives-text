# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
In selecting the Daily's Athletes of the
Week this time around, we went thematic,
rhyming even. The title for this week's
selectees is "Bound and Rebound." On the
women's side, Melisa Kuller jumped and
dove her way to success and on the men's
side Adam Keefe jumped and dunked the
basketball team back into contention in the

Pacific 10 Conference.
Kuller, a 5-foot-7 junior from a town best
known as the home of America's favorite col
lege football team, South Bend, Ind., won
two events in the Cardinal's dual meet
against sixth-ranked Michigan Saturday at
deGuerre Pool.
She scored a 257.60 in the one-meter
springboard to best teammate Kristin
Jensen by nearly 20 points. In the three
meter, Kuller outscored the Wolverines' Lisa
Scherer. Jensen took third in the event.
Kuller's performances helped Stanford
thrash Michigan 222-78 and allowed the
Cardinal to open the season with a bang. The
result was all the more impressive consider
ing Stanford was without a number of its top
swimmers and its top diver who were com
peting in other venues around the world.

Keefe, a 6-9 junior from Irvine, Calif., rat
tled the rims for 52 points in the Cardinal's
back-to-back dissections of Washington and
Washington State in Maples.
Thursday night, the big redhead recorded
a double-double as Stanford easily handled
the Huskies 87-55. Keefe poured in 26
points, including 22 in the first half, and
grabbed his usual 10 rebounds.
Against the Cougars, Saturday, he again
scored 26 and gathered six boards as the
Cardinal recorded a 94-63 triumph. Keefe
put together a mini-highlight reel in the sec
ond stanza with three monster jams — one of
which was a two-handed reverse after a steal.

Dominique would have been proud.
The wins pushed Stanford to 2-2 in league
play and breathed some life into a season
that was in danger after the Oregon trip two
weekends ago. The Cardinal faces No. 7
UCLA in Pauley Pavilion tomorrow night on
ESPN.
