### Judy Hsu 
The first meeting of the International
Advisory Council for Stanford's Insti
tute for International Studies will take
place next week, bringing together gov
ernment officials and prominent busi
ness leaders and academics from around
the world.
The advisory council will meet Jan. 24
and 25 to discuss current global issues
and to better interaction among the
political, corporate and academic realms.
The institute coordinates Stanford's
international activities, serves as a
resource center and maintains overseas
contacts for the University.
Among the 30 dignitaries expected to
attend are Italian Prime Minister Giulio

Andreotti, Nobel peace prize winner and
former Costa Rican President Oscar
Arias Sanchez, former President Gerald
Ford, former French President Valery
Giscard d'Estaing, British Parliament
member and former foreign secretary
Geoffrey Howe and former West German
Chancellor Helmut Schmidt.
Thomas Heller, deputy director of the
institute, said he sees the meeting as a
"unique opportunity" for Stanford.
"Stanford is a university which sees
itself as playing an important role in
shaping both education and policy in
critical areas that will affect the welfare
of all of us," Heller said.
He added that Stanford plays both a
"leadership role and a cooperative
role" in helping to solve world
problems. "It's a great opportu
nity, ... an important step in
building ... connections ana the
support overseas" for Stanford.
Former Secretary of State and
honorary Hoover fellow George
Shultz organized the council
along with former Stanford Pres
ident Richard Lyman, who directs
the institute. Shultz will chair the
council, which will act as an advi
sory board to the institute.
In addition to participating in
two days of closed meetings, sev
eral of the political leaders will
meet with students. Schmidt will
participate in a special lunch with
students in Haus Mitteleuropa,
and Andreotti will eat with stu
dents in the Italian House. A sim
ilar plan at the French House fell
through, but three French House
residents will attend a later meet
ing with one of the dignitaries.
In addition, representatives
from several student organiza
tions that have regular contact
with the institute will have lunch
on Friday with the council.
One of the themes of the con
ference will be the international
ization of the university, which
will be addressed in remarks by
Lyman and University President

Donald Kennedy. In addition, the
conference will be divided into
four main sessions focusing on
the following topics:
• Science and technology pol
icy,
• The global environment,
• International security, and
• International political econ
omy.
In these sessions, Stanford fac
ulty members will present various
viewpoints on the predetermined
topics. The council will respond to
those viewpoints and discuss the
issues further.
Shultz contacted potential
committee members last year and
established a 39-member council.
The council will meet in closed
session because M that is the
nature of any advising council
meeting," said Nancy Okimoto,
associate director of the institute.
She added that privacy was
imperative because members
"need to talk frankly." The where
abouts of members at definite
times will also be kept secret for
security reasons.
Other council participants
include former Federal Reserve
Board Chair Paul Volcker, former
Prime Minister of Singapore Lee
Kuan Yew, Sen. Bill Bradley, D-
N.J., Rep. Tom Campbell, D-Stan
ford, Special Adviser on Arms
Control to the President Paul
Nitze and University of Chicago
Prof. Emeritus Arnold Harberger.
