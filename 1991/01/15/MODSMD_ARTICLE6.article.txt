"It's hard. It's really, really hard,"
said Stanford graduate Rachel Carr. "At
Stanford, so much is based on the
upper-class child. I'm teaching children
who go to school without any food in
their stomachs. I'm teaching abused
children."
In her first year of involvement with
Teach for America, Carr, who graduated
last year, has traded the idyllic serenity
of Stanford to teach second grade in
Public School 183, a Brooklyn, N.Y. ele
mentary school with 98 percent black
and 2 percent Hispanic enrollment.
"The rules I learned in psychology are
hard to apply to a child who isn't used to
being treated nicely as a human being,"
Carr said.
Rob Held is another of the eight
Stanford graduates currently involved
in Teach for America, a two-year-old,
non-profit organization that places col
lege graduates in teaching positions in

inner-city or rural schools. The program
arranges for emergency teaching certifi
cation, which allows participants to
teach without fulfilling the normal cer
tification requirements.
For Held, who also graduated in
1990, the change in environment was
also pronounced.
Held is one of four white male teach
ers out of a total of 60 at Public School
223, an all-black elementary school in
Queens, N.Y. One of the hardest chal
lenges Held said he must face is that the
students "don't just need teaching, they
need parenting. And many of my stu
dents should be receiving counseling."
Several of Held's students have told
him of harrowing childhood experi
ences. "[Some] little kids were talking
about how angry Mom was because she
found Daddy sleeping with another
woman," Held said. "One kid even
watched his father kill his mother. So
many of my students have problems
along this line, and this can't help but
spill over into the classroom."

"On the whole," Held said, "the kids
seem to come from one of two back
grounds. Either they have very bad par
ents who are completely uninterested in
them, or they have good parents who
are too busy trying to hold onto two jobs
in order to raise enough money to feed
their kids. After coming home from two
jobs, as much as they care, these parents
are too exhausted to parent."
"Inner-city schools are hard to deal
with," said Ray Brown, assistant for
minority recruitment for Teach for
America. "Many teachers aren't inter
ested in working in such schools. These
are the schools [in whichl Teach for
America places its participants. The jobs
are full time (and) involve full pay and
full responsibilities," he said.
However, Brown said he holds great
hopes for the capabilities and motiva
tion of Stanford students and predicts
increased student awareness of and par
ticipation in Teach for America.
