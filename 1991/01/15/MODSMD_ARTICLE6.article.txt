# Recent grads Teach for America

"It's hard. It's really, really hard,"
said Stanford graduate Rachel Carr. "At
Stanford, so much is based on the
upper-class child. I'm teaching children
who go to school without any food in
their stomachs. I'm teaching abused
children."
In her first year of involvement with
Teach for America, Carr, who graduated
last year, has traded the idyllic serenity
of Stanford to teach second grade in
Public School 183, a Brooklyn, N.Y. ele
mentary school with 98 percent black
and 2 percent Hispanic enrollment.
"The rules I learned in psychology are
hard to apply to a child who isn't used to
being treated nicely as a human being,"
Carr said.
Rob Held is another of the eight
Stanford graduates currently involved
in Teach for America, a two-year-old,
non-profit organization that places col
lege graduates in teaching positions in

inner-city or rural schools. The program
arranges for emergency teaching certifi
cation, which allows participants to
teach without fulfilling the normal cer
tification requirements.
For Held, who also graduated in
1990, the change in environment was
also pronounced.
Held is one of four white male teach
ers out of a total of 60 at Public School
223, an all-black elementary school in
Queens, N.Y. One of the hardest chal
lenges Held said he must face is that the
students "don't just need teaching, they
need parenting. And many of my stu
dents should be receiving counseling."
Several of Held's students have told
him of harrowing childhood experi
ences. "[Some] little kids were talking
about how angry Mom was because she
found Daddy sleeping with another
woman," Held said. "One kid even
watched his father kill his mother. So
many of my students have problems
along this line, and this can't help but
spill over into the classroom."

"On the whole," Held said, "the kids
seem to come from one of two back
grounds. Either they have very bad par
ents who are completely uninterested in
them, or they have good parents who
are too busy trying to hold onto two jobs
in order to raise enough money to feed
their kids. After coming home from two
jobs, as much as they care, these parents
are too exhausted to parent."
"Inner-city schools are hard to deal
with," said Ray Brown, assistant for
minority recruitment for Teach for
America. "Many teachers aren't inter
ested in working in such schools. These
are the schools [in whichl Teach for
America places its participants. The jobs
are full time (and) involve full pay and
full responsibilities," he said.
However, Brown said he holds great
hopes for the capabilities and motiva
tion of Stanford students and predicts
increased student awareness of and par
ticipation in Teach for America.
"I feel that students here are
reflective enough to understand
that there are responsibilities
involved in being the recipient of
great opportunities, like attend
ing a fine university," Brown said.
"My experience here at Stanford
was so good and well-received that
I hope to expand campus recruit
ing [for the program]." Brown
hopes to establish permanent ties
with the Haas Public Service Cen
ter in the future.
Despite the challenges Teach
for America participants face, last
year there were over 2,600 stu
dents competing for the 500 two
year teaching positions. After the
two years are over, participants
have the option to stay in their
assigned schools and continue to
teach.
Teaching experience is not nec
essary, Brown noted. Still, "each
applicant should know that the
program involves being able to
accept and deal with the difficul
ties of a situation that is less than

ideal," he said.
Brown also stressed the impor
tance of adaptability in the appli
cant.
Teach for America is in dire
need of bilingual students, as well
as students from mathematical or
scientific backgrounds, Brown
added.
As teachers, both Carr and
Held face the increasingly com
mon difficulties of working in
schools with shrinking budgets.
Held's classroom doesn't have
enough chairs to accommodate
his students, but he says the fur
niture wouldn't fit in the tiny
classroom even if it were avail
able.
"The kids have to sit on the
floor, but I brought rugs in to try
and make them a little more com
fortable," Held said.
"But some aspects are a lot bet
ter than I expected," he contin
ued. "I'm getting a lot of parental
support and am finding many par
ents are very concerned about the
education system."
In her first week of teaching,
Carr said she spent the equivalent
of her first month's rent on class
room materials. However, like

Held, she continues to focus on
the positive.
"I do wonder what my six
hours a day are going to amount
to among 30 kids who have had
very difficult upbringings," Carr
said. "But I know they care and
love me. And they know that I
love them. They know it, and
they've become more responsive.
They give me little drawings and
one girl even wrote in one of her
assignments, 'I love my teacher,
Miss Carr.' It's kept me going."
Held said his public service
experience helped mentally pre
pare him for the challenges in his
current position. During his Stan
ford undergraduate years, he
tutored at Ravenswood Elemen
tary School and helped start a
chapter of Tomorrow's Teachers
Today, a program designed to help
undergraduates interested in
teaching explore available
resources.
Although he views a staggering
number of flaws in the educa
tional system, Held said he is sat
isfied that he is doing what he can
to touch the lives of the young
students.
"I can see myself in 30 years
asking, 'What have I done?' I
won't be satisfied if all I can
answer is that I've made a lot of
money. Anyone in my position,
coming from Stanford, can do
that," Held said.

students "don't just need teaching, they
need parenting. And many of my stu
dents should be receiving counseling."
Several of Held's students have told
him of harrowing childhood experi
ences. "[Some] little kids were talking
about how angry Mom was because she
found Daddy sleeping with another
woman," Held said. "One kid even
watched his father kill his mother. So
many of my students have problems
along this line, and this can't help but
spill over into the classroom."

"On the whole," Held said, "the kids
seem to come from one of two back
grounds. Either they have very bad par
ents who are completely uninterested in
them, or they have good parents who
are too busy trying to hold onto two jobs
in order to raise enough money to feed
their kids. After coming home from two
jobs, as much as they care, these parents
are too exhausted to parent."
"Inner-city schools are hard to deal
with," said Ray Brown, assistant for
minority recruitment for Teach for
America. "Many teachers aren't inter
ested in working in such schools. These
are the schools [in whichl Teach for
America places its participants. The jobs
are full time (and) involve full pay and
full responsibilities," he said.
However, Brown said he holds great
hopes for the capabilities and motiva
tion of Stanford students and predicts
increased student awareness of and par
ticipation in Teach for America.
"I feel that students here are
reflective enough to understand
that there are responsibilities
involved in being the recipient of
great opportunities, like attend
ing a fine university," Brown said.
"My experience here at Stanford
was so good and well-received that
I hope to expand campus recruit
ing [for the program]." Brown
hopes to establish permanent ties
with the Haas Public Service Cen
ter in the future.
Despite the challenges Teach
for America participants face, last
year there were over 2,600 stu
dents competing for the 500 two
year teaching positions. After the
two years are over, participants
have the option to stay in their
assigned schools and continue to
teach.
Teaching experience is not nec
essary, Brown noted. Still, "each
applicant should know that the
program involves being able to
accept and deal with the difficul
ties of a situation that is less than

ideal," he said.
Brown also stressed the impor
tance of adaptability in the appli
cant.
Teach for America is in dire
need of bilingual students, as well
as students from mathematical or
scientific backgrounds, Brown
added.
As teachers, both Carr and
Held face the increasingly com
mon difficulties of working in
schools with shrinking budgets.
Held's classroom doesn't have
enough chairs to accommodate
his students, but he says the fur
niture wouldn't fit in the tiny
classroom even if it were avail
able.
"The kids have to sit on the
floor, but I brought rugs in to try
and make them a little more com
fortable," Held said.
"But some aspects are a lot bet
ter than I expected," he contin
ued. "I'm getting a lot of parental
support and am finding many par
ents are very concerned about the
education system."
In her first week of teaching,
Carr said she spent the equivalent
of her first month's rent on class
room materials. However, like

Held, she continues to focus on
the positive.
"I do wonder what my six
hours a day are going to amount
to among 30 kids who have had
very difficult upbringings," Carr
said. "But I know they care and
love me. And they know that I
love them. They know it, and
they've become more responsive.
They give me little drawings and
one girl even wrote in one of her
assignments, 'I love my teacher,
Miss Carr.' It's kept me going."
Held said his public service
experience helped mentally pre
pare him for the challenges in his
current position. During his Stan
ford undergraduate years, he
tutored at Ravenswood Elemen
tary School and helped start a
chapter of Tomorrow's Teachers
Today, a program designed to help
undergraduates interested in
teaching explore available
resources.
Although he views a staggering
number of flaws in the educa
tional system, Held said he is sat
isfied that he is doing what he can
to touch the lives of the young
students.
"I can see myself in 30 years
asking, 'What have I done?' I
won't be satisfied if all I can
answer is that I've made a lot of
money. Anyone in my position,
coming from Stanford, can do
that," Held said.
"It's hard. It's really, really hard,"
said Stanford graduate Rachel Carr. "At
Stanford, so much is based on the
upper-class child. I'm teaching children
who go to school without any food in
their stomachs. I'm teaching abused
children."
In her first year of involvement with
Teach for America, Carr, who graduated
last year, has traded the idyllic serenity
of Stanford to teach second grade in
Public School 183, a Brooklyn, N.Y. ele
mentary school with 98 percent black
and 2 percent Hispanic enrollment.
"The rules I learned in psychology are
hard to apply to a child who isn't used to
being treated nicely as a human being,"
Carr said.
Rob Held is another of the eight
Stanford graduates currently involved
in Teach for America, a two-year-old,
non-profit organization that places col
lege graduates in teaching positions in

inner-city or rural schools. The program
arranges for emergency teaching certifi
cation, which allows participants to
teach without fulfilling the normal cer
tification requirements.
For Held, who also graduated in
1990, the change in environment was
also pronounced.
Held is one of four white male teach
ers out of a total of 60 at Public School
223, an all-black elementary school in
Queens, N.Y. One of the hardest chal
lenges Held said he must face is that the
students "don't just need teaching, they
need parenting. And many of my stu
dents should be receiving counseling."
Several of Held's students have told

ences. "[Some] little kids were talking
about how angry Mom was because she
