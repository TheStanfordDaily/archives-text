You're never too young
to change the world.
We're attracted to college students for
what they haven t learned: limitations.
Systems to applications, multimedia to
networking, you won't find any limitations at
Microsoft. What you will find are small teams
and immediate responsibility for important
projects.
We're out to revolutionize the world with
our vision of personal computing. And we're
looking for the brightest technical minds to do
it. Many of them already work here as
Software Design Engineers and Program
Managers —learn how you can join them.
On-campus
Interviews for
Full-time and
Summer positions
Jan. 22, 1991
See your Career Center
for details
If you are pursuing a BA/BS, MS or PhD
degree in Computer Science, Electrical
Engineering, Math, Physics or related
technical area, then lets talk about your
programming experience, design skills and/or
exposure to managing projects. Relocation is
available for both summer and full-time
positions. Also, see us at the Minority
Engineering Job Fair on January 19th.
We are an equal opportunity employer
and are working toward a more culturally
diverse workplace.
