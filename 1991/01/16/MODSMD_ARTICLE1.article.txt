# Kennedy sets standards for conduct of Gulf debate
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
University President Donald Kennedy
issued a statement yesterday urging that cam
pus debate on U.S. policy in the Gulf be "con
ducted on a high plane," and reminding
students that political demonstrations that
disrupt University activities are punishable
under the campus disruption code.
"Because we are an institution devoted to
the free expression of a variety of views, it is
important that the debate be conducted rigor
ously and fairly here," Kennedy said in the

statement.
"To hold rallies, vigils and marches ... is
fine," Kennedy said, so long as these activities
comply with the campus disruption code.
Developed in 1967, the code states that it is a
violation for students to disrupt University
activities, such as classes and administrative
work, or to obstruct the movement of others
around campus.
While there is no specific penalty attached
to violating the disruption code, past infrac
tions have led to penalties ranging from a let
ter of reprimand to expulsion. The 55
protesters who occupied and surrounded

Kennedy's office for eight hours in May 1989
were punished with probation and community
service hours.
In his statement, Kennedy noted that
protesters in San Francisco had successfully
blocked traffic Monday on the Golden Gate
Bridge.
"Because disruptions of that itmd have
become fairly common," he said, "some may
have come to believe that they are now all
right, and must be endured like other inconve
niences of modern life. They are not all right."

during maneuvers in the Gulf.
Stanford's disruption code, he
said, "will be strictly enforced."
Kennedy called the crisis in the
Gulf a "complex issue, with few
parallels to the struggle in Viet
nam that gave rise to such deep

division in our nation nearly a
quarter century ago."
"The conviction that armed
aggression must be countered,
and the conviction that all war is
wrong, are both morally defensi
ble positions," Kennedy said. "I
hope the debate here can be con
ducted on high plane, without
recourse to attacks on the
motives or ethics of those who
hold opposing views."
