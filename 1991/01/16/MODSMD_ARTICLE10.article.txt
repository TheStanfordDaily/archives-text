# Flier sparks concern over Muslim stereotypes
## 
### Cecilia Tom Editorial staff 
A flier reading "all moslims
must die in the desert" was posted
in Roble Hall yesterday, prompt
ing some Muslim students to call
for a more educated look at the
Islamic religion.
The flier was found in the
lounge area sometime in the
morning, and was signed "nbc."
So far nobody has figured out
what or who "nbc" stands for.
The same flier was also report
edly seen at Stanford Medical
Center.
Roble resident assistant Raphe
Beck said two residents alerted
him at 11 a.m. about the flier. The
flier was folded over "like some

body tried to rip it off," he said.
Beck said he moved the flier to
a more prominent location in the
lounge area, posted a big piece of
butcher paper with it and invited
students to make comments.
"My stepdad is a Muslim who is
a fairly ordinary person. He
teaches political science at a small
college in Chicago. Are you refer
ring to him in your flier?" one stu
dent wrote.
"What frightens me ... is that
someone took the time ... to type
it into a computer, print it up,
(xerox it?), and post it," Beck com
mented on the butcher paper.
Ann Porteus, assistant director
of Residential Education, said she
has not heard reports from other
dorms of similar incidents. But

she acknowledged that "students
turning from other students" is
something she has been worrying
about because anxiety over war
may heighten students' fears or
stereotypes of other students.
She called the flier a "low tac
tic," and said she hopes the cam
pus can stay together as a "collec
tive community" in the time of an
international conflict.
Law Prof. Thomas Grey, who
authored the Fundamental Stan
dard amendments that were
approved last spring, said the flier
is "clearly not" a violation of the
conduct code. The flier is not a
"person to person" assault and
does not contain any racial epi
thets, he explained.
Some Muslim students are con

cerned that the image of Islam
will be tainted by the political con
flict in the Middle East
Omar Siddiqui, a sophomore in
Adams House who is Muslim, said
the flier "bespeaks ignorance and
paranoia," in part a result of the
media's often militant portrayal
of Islam.
"Saddam should not be viewed
as a representative of the faith,"
he added.
Fayyaz Nurmohamed, a fresh
man, pointed out that people
often mistake Muslims for Arabs.
Muslims are scattered around the
world and only a small percentage
of them are in the Middle East, he
explained.
