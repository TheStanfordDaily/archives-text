SAN FRANCISCO (AP) â€” Police in riot gear
pulled protesters from a human chain outside a fed
eral office building and arrested more than 400 peo
ple yesterday in one of the largest of many anti-war
protests around the nation.
At one point, San Francisco police used chemical
mace and riot batons to push demonstrators out of a

downtown intersection.
Elsewhere, anti-war protesters gathered at the
White House, the United Nations, on college cam
puses and at other federal buildings in a last-ditch
effort to persuade President Bush not to attack Iraq.
"I think there should be millions of people here.
Nobody should sit home and say its OK to go to war,"

said Chuck Nevin, one of the demonstrators in San
Francisco.
The demonstration began around 6 a.m. when
people began gathering around the 20-story Federal
Building. Organizers put the crowd at 10,000 at its
peak, but journalists estimated the attendance at
about 3,000.
The U.S.-dominated 28-nation force in the Per
sian Gulf is the biggest such force assembled since
the Korean War.
As of Jan. 15, the Pentagon said, there were more
than 630,000 troops from 28 nations are arrayed
against Iraq's estimated 545,000 fighters in south
ern Iraq and Kuwait.
U.N. peace efforts collapsed yesterday and the sec
retary-general issued a final appeal to Saddam Hus
sein to pull out and avert war.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said in
a brief statement that if Iraq begins a decisive with
drawal, his forces will not be attacked and the inter
national community will focus on solving the Arab-
Israeli conflict.
Speaking in a crowded conference room, Perez de
Cuellar said: "I have every assurance once again
from the highest levels of government that with the
resolution of the present crisis, every effort will be
made to address, in a comprehensive manner, the
Arab-Israeli conflict, including the Palestinan ques
tion."
Gloomy diplomats, however, said no further Secu
rity Council action was contemplated and that war
appeared all but inevitable.
At least two-thirds of Americans favor military
action against Saddam Hussein, according to public
opinion polls taken since the talks with Iraq in
Geneva failed and Congress authorized the use of
force.
In a poll by The Washington Post and ABC News
taken Sunday night, 69 percent favored an attack by
the U.S.-led coalition in Saudi Arabia at some point,
while 26 percent were against any attack.
For months, the polls have shown substantial

numbers of Americans favoring waiting to see how
economic sanctions and diplomatic efforts work.
In an AP poll taken Jan. 4-7, 44 percent said the
United States should go to war if Saddam failed to
withdraw troops from Kuwait by the United Nations
deadline, while 50 percent favored giving economic
sanctions more time to work.
Polls on foreign policy are particularly sensitive to
the effects of question wording. The Post-ABC poll
measured support for going to war "at some point."
The AP poll showed the extent the public was
divided between the possibility of immediate war and
what could seem to be a much less painful wait-and
see alternative.
The next question for pollsters to ask was how
long Americans were willing to wait.
Thirty-seven percent of those surveyed in the
Post-ABC poll favored an immediate attack after the
midnight deadline. Add the 21 percent who said the
United States should wait less than a month, and a
total of 58 percent favored going to war within a
month.
The Defense Department issued new guidelines
for reporters covering Persian Gulf combat that will
bar unescorted reporters from accompanying com
bat units.
Another new guideline bars journalists from car
rying weapons of their own.
Several news organizations protested last week
when the Pentagon released an earlier version of the
guidelines calling for security reviews of pool reports
produced by correspondents who visit the scene of
action in small groups with official escorts.
On returning to the rear, these small groups of
reporters share or "pool" their material with corre
spondents who were unable to see the front lines for
themselves.
The revised guidelines, which keep the review
process, stressed that news organizations them
selves will decide what they report in the event of
disputes with military authorities.
