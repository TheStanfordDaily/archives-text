# U.S. Supreme Court strikes down permanent school busing
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - School dis
tricts may sometimes end forced busing
in favor of neighborhood schools even if
that means a return to schools over
whelmingly black or white, the Supreme
Court ruled yesterday.
By a 5-3 vote, the court said federal
judges should end their supervision of
previously segregated public schools if
court-ordered desegregation has elimi
nated "the vestiges of past discrimina
tion."
The decision set aside a federal appeals
fourt ruling that would have forced the

Oklahoma City school board to abandon
a neighborhood schools plan begun in
1985 for students in kindergarten
through fourth grade.
Under that plan, 33 of the city's 64 ele
mentary schools became racially segre
gated — with student populations at least
90 percent black or 90 percent white and
other minorities.
The court sent the Oklahoma City
case back to a federal trial judge for fur
ther study.
The decision likely will make it easier
for hundreds of other school districts

nationwide to escape the court-ordered
desegregation plans they now operate
under.
Requests by local school boards for an
end to court supervision will be decided
by a federal judiciary now dominated by
appointees of former President Ronald
Reagan and President Bush.
Still pending before the justices are
similar disputes from Atlanta, Denver
and Topeka, Kan. The court could send
those cases back to lower courts for fur
ther study in light of Tuesday's decision.
The Topeka school district was one of

those involved in the high court's land
mark 1954 decision in Brown vs. Board of
Education, which outlawed racially seg
regated public schools.
Civil rights lawyers had urged the jus
tices to uphold the appeals court ruling in
the Oklahoma City case, arguing that
allowing an end to court supervision in
such cases would result in resegregation
of urban schools.
But yesterday's decision, the court's
most important statement on school
desegregation in 16 years, did not appß&r
to be a total defeat for civil rights advo

cates.
"The court has struck a middle
ground," said Teree Foster, a University
of Oklahoma law professor.
Joining Rehnquist were Justices
Byron White, Sandra Day O'Connor,
Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy
Justices Thurgood Marshall, Harry
Blackmun and John Paul Stevens dis
sented.
Justice David Souter, who joined the
court after the Oklahoma City case was
argued in October, did not participate.
