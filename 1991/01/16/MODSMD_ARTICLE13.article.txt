RIGA, U.S.S.R. (AP) - Soviet
commandos stormed a Latvian
police academy and seized
weapons from cadets yesterday as
a tide of unrest surged through
the Baltics.
In Moscow, Mikhail S. Gor
bachev clashed head-on with a
hot-tempered military hard-liner
who demanded that the Soviet
president take even harsher mea
sures against the breakaway
republics.
Thousands at a Communist
Party-led rally in Riga roared for a
pro-Kremlin group to take power
in Latvia.
In Lithuania, a military heli
copter circled parliament and
workers dug a long trench behind
the building to protect it from
Soviet tanks. A government offi
cial said 80 people were missing
after Sunday's military assault on
the republic's television tower.
Fourteeen people are known to
have been killed in the attack; 230
were injured.
About 5,000 Kremlin loyalists
rallied in the Estonian capital of
Tallinn, condemning the sepa
ratist Estonian government.
Gorbachev has been striking
back at pro-independence forces
he says are violating the Soviet
Constitution. Yesterday, he made
a fiery speech to the Supreme
Soviet legislature.
The president spoke of the
need for negotiating ways of dis
arming civilians who have
amassed weapons to defend them
selves. Suddenly, Col. Nikolai
Petrushenko stood up stiffly,
pumped his right arm up and
down and shouted: "No negotia
tions! The bandits must be dis
armed tonight!"
Gorbachev, who has been

under great pressure from impa
tient hard-liners such as
Petrushenko to take tougher steps
to restore order, shot back angrily.
"Before you stands a man who
understands the full responsibil
ity and full acuteness of this prob
lem," Gorbachev said, referring to
himself and jabbing in the air with
his finger for emphasis.
Latvian Interior Minister
Aloizs Vaznis accused Soviet
"black beret" commandos of stag
ing attacks that "are designed to
provoke armed conflict to prompt
the intervention of military units,
which are combat-ready."
The commandos attacked
Latvia's only police academy at 2
a.m. and took pistols, automatic
weapons, snipers' rifles and
grenade launchers that Vaznis
said "could be used in provocative
actions" against the republic's
government.
Some commandos arrived at
the academy disguised as traffic
police, talked their way past a
night watchman and disarmed
him, Latvian radio reported.
Other commandos seized the
building, disarming the cadets
and severely beating two, the
report said. They left a short time
later.
In the Lithuanian capital of
Vilnius, workers plowed a 9-foot
deep ditch between the Neris
River and the back of the parlia
ment building to protect it from
assault. Large concrete blocks
were trucked in to serve as barri
cades.
Audrius Butkevicius, coordina
tor of a Lithuanian parliamentary
group organized to defend the
republic, said 80 people were miss
ing since the assault on the trans
mitter.
