Attorney general asks to extend gun deadline
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California's new attorney gen
eral asked lawmakers yesterday to extend the registration period
for so-called "assault weapons" in an effort to get more owners to
comply with the law.
The legislature had banned sales of the weapons and allowed
people who already owned them to keep the guns if they regis
tered them by Dec. 31.
The Department of Justice has logged 13,375 applications for
registration that were received before the deadline and has sev
eral thousand more to process, said Kati Corsaut, a spokeswoman
for the department's division of law enforcement.
That falls far short of California's estimated 200,000 to
300,000 assault weapons.
Attorney General Dan Lungren proposed reopening registra
tion for an unspecified time and holding the 2,000 or so applica
tions that were filed late, rather than turning them over to local
authorities for potential prosecution as provided in the law.
AIDS vaccine proves safe, but will it work?
PHILADELPHIA (AP) — The first AIDS vaccine tested on
humans has proved safe, scientists said yesterday. Now they have
to find out how well it works.
VaxSyn was injected into 36 healthy adult volunteers at six
hospitals in 1988, and side effects were few and slight, the
researchers reported in today's Annals of Internal Medicine, pub
lished by the American College of Physicians.
Researchers are now conducting tests to determine just how
effective VaxSyn might be in building up a person's immunity to
the AIDS virus.
Administration downplays recession
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Bush reviewed the state of
the economy yesterday with his top economic advisers and Fed
eral Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. Afterwards, the admin
istration again voiced a belief that the recession will be a short
one.
In addition to the overall health of the economy, the discussion
covered the problems facing the nation's banking system, presi
dential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
While many economists believe the economy contracted at a
sharp annual rate of around 4 percent in the final three months
of the year, Fitzwater said the administration did not expect the
contraction in the January-March quarter to be "quite as bad."
