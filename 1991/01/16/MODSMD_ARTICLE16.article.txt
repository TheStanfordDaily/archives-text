## ASSU makes good 
### 
Although the assu's
computerized fee refund sys
tem initially seemed a hassle
to students, its implementation
has proven to be worthwhile.
Administrative costs have been
saved, in the long run, which may
in the future translate into lower
annual ASSU fees for students.
The figures clearly showed that
students found the system —
which mails them a check instead
of doling out cash — inconvenient.
Last quarter, many student groups
reaped more of a windfall from
lower refund requests than ever
before.
However, students must realize
that the change was made for
administrative purposes and is not
a ploy to deprive them of instant

cash.
Refunds are set up for conscien
tious objectors, an objective well
served by the new system.
Because the computerized sys
tem takes away the "impulse-buy
ing" incentive — students won't
decide to collect their money after
sighting some delicious pizza at the
Corner Pocket — it will force stu
dents to consider carefully before
taking refunds from groups of
which they claim they disapprove.
In addition, the new system has
the advantage of saving costs from
staff training.
It also does not require having
$30,000 to $40,000 in the ASSU
safe, which is always a bad idea.
Good job, Torrence!
