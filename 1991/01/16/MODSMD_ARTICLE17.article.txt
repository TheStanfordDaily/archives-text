Last week's ncaa reforms
were a good first step toward
striking a balance between
much-needed changes in scholar
ship, recruiting and practice rules
and athletes' interests and needs.
In theory, the new limits on
practice time, under which coaches
can only require athletes to prac
tice for 20 hours per week, should
allow colleges and student athletes
to spend more time on education.
The original proposal was
amended to allow athletes to prac
tice as long as they want on their
own, so that Olympic-caliber ath
letes like Janet Evans and Summer
Sanders won't have to leave school
to train adequately.
This change was necessary to
allow athletes in sports based on
individual competition to remain
competitive.
But there is a danger that this
loophole is so large that none of the
educational benefits will be real

ized.
The reforms should also provide
the Department of Athletics with
some much-needed budget relief.
On several occasions last year,
department officials estimated a
budget deficit of about $1 million.
By cutting scholarships by 10
percent across the board and
reducing the size of coaching staff,
the University would save — if the
cuts were made all at once — about
$500,000 a year.
These cuts will cause some hard
ship for players, and they will cer
tainly reduce opportunities for ath
letes.
The University obviously must
continue to be concerned with
maintaining Stanford's athletic
program.
However, making small cuts
across the board will benefit the
overall program more than cutting
entire teams.
