## The 						atrocity of impatience 
### 
Reversing brutal aggression
is, in principle, a righteous cause.
The fact that Saddam Hussein not
only invaded a sovereign state, but also
annexed it sets his aggression apart from
the U.S. invasions of Grenada and
Panama. Yet if George Bush unleashes
the enormous violent capacity of our
armed forces today or in the near future,
he will, I believe, commit an epic blunder.
Roger Fisher of the Harvard Negotia
tion Project once said that nuclear war
had become an abstraction, that a presi
dent would be too distanced from the con
sequences of a launch to fully grasp what
he was doing. He suggested that instead
of keeping the launch codes inside the
attache case of an accompanying officer,
they be implanted in a capsule alongside
the officer's heart, and a butcher knife
placed in the case.
That way, the president would have to
kill one innocent human being before
killing millions. Bloody reality would be
brought home to his own fingertips.
Fisher's Pentagon friends objected that
this would distort the president's judg
ment and, in a sense, inadvertently rein
forced his point.
Adapting Fisher's proposal to our pre
sent predicament, I wonder if Bush would
be as ready as he appears to be to initiate
war today if he had to inaugurate it by
personally pointing a gun at the chest of
one single Iraqi child and pulling the trig
ger. Just one. Not in eight months, but
today. If you favor the use of force now,
would you be willing to pull the trigger
first? (This may not be hypothetical for
long — once we are sucked into the vortex

of war, a draft will begin to loom.)
Personalizing the killing in this way
does not imply absolute pacifism. Some
times the lesser of two evils must be cho
sen, and Hussein himself shows no hesi
tation to commit atrocities. True, we
won't aim at innocents, but we can fore
see that many will be killed if we go to
war.
Let us not shield our eyes. Thousands
upon thousands of innocents — American
and Iraqi soldiers in addition to civilians
— will die if this imminent war begins.
Thousands more will emerge with
grotesquely dismembered bodies and per
manently scarred minds, prey to a life
time of thundering nightmares.
Internalizing this reality does not
require an abdication from rational
assessment, but rather is an indispens
able prerequisite to it. It impels us to ask
whether all alternatives really have been
exhausted, to ask with all the desperate
urgency that our own bleeding soldiers
will feel as they await medics on the bat
tlefield.
The simple fact is that the alternatives
have not been exhausted. Diplomacy may
indeed be futile for the time being, but the
coercive power of the most complete sanc
tions ever imposed has not had an ade
quate chance to exert itself.
Bush adopted the faulty premise that
additional time was to the advantage of
Iraq and announced the doubling of our
troops on Nov. 8. That move foreshad
owed the setting of the Jan. 15 deadline
and rigged in advance the much-bally
hooed, and tragically delayed, congres
sional debate of the past weekend.

Yet time is still on our side. Our own
field commanders have stressed how use
ful extra time is in preparing for the
unforeseen demands of desert warfare; it
is we who are on alien terrain, not the
Iraqis. And over time, the embargo is
forecasted to seriously impair Iraq's
fighting ability.
As for the alleged difficulty of holding
the coalition together for sanctions, we're
acting as if we must throw up our hands
and hope for the best. In fact, compen
satory funds are being skillfully chan
neled to those members of the coalition
losing the most. Strangely, we are assum
ing that a war coalition will be easier to
maintain. Precisely the opposite is pw>b*
bly true, especially given the divisive
potential of the Israeli wildcard.
The lesson of the post-war era has
been patience. George Kennan urged
patient containment of the Soviet Union:
our troops sat patiently in Europe for
over 40 years, and eventually the Soviets
began to pick up and go home. We've been
hearing how impatient many of our
troops are to to get the job done and come
home. As unlikely as it appears now, Bush
owes them the patience of a wise man.
