# Ralliers protest U.S. Gulf policy
## 
### Eleni Kirkas Staff writer 
During the largest anti-war
protest at Stanford since the Per
sian Gulf crisis began, junior Jen
Pearson of Stanford Students for
Peace took a microphone and
asked the crowd, "Has [President]
Bush gone the extra mile for
peace?"
"Hell no!" came the resounding
answer-from students and other
members of the Stanford commu
nity who gathered yesterday
afternoon in White Plaza to
protest current U.S. policy in the
Middle East. Estimates of the
crowd size ranged from 700 to
1,000 students.
As the U.N.-imposed deadline
for Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait
drew closer, demonstrators voiced
opposition to U. S. military action
against Iraq and urged U.S. politi
cal leaders and citizens to take a
more active stance in finding a
peaceful resolution to the Persian
Gulf crisis.
The two-hour event — orga
nized by Stanford Students for
Peace and the Stanford Middle
East Action Committee — fea
tured speakers in White Plaza and
culminated in a march to the
Oval, where students set up the
"Stanford Memorial Cemetery for
Persian Gulf War Dead 1990-?"
Across a grassy section of the
Oval, white paper bags — some
bearing the names of soldiers
already killed during maneuvers
in Operation Desert Shield, others
inscribed with the word "peace"
or the ominous inscription "you?"
— were used to represent the
tombstones in the mock grave
yard.
Organizers also used the event
to inform people of upcoming
peace demonstrations in the area
and to offer suggestions for ways
to make their opinions known,
such as writing or calling mem

bers of Congress.
Pearson opened the rally with a
challenge to the Bush administra
tion's portrayal of the current cri
sis as a clear-cut case of right ver
sus wrong. At issue, she said, is
not primarily Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait, but "the flow of cheap
oil."
Pearson and other speakers
criticized the President's willing
ness to go to war with Iraq before
giving economic sanctions suffi
cient time to take effect and
demanded that greater effort be
directed toward a negotiated
diplomatic settlement
Aim6e Allison, a Stanford
senior in the Army reserves who is
seeking discharge from the mili
tary as a conscientious objector,
also spoke at the rally.
Echoing sentiments she
expressed in a letter published in
Monday's Daily, Allison said her
studies in American and African
history at Stanford caused her to
change her views about war and
the armed forces. Now, she said,
she considers herself a pacifist,
and wishes to follow the doctrine
of "non-violent moral force"
espoused by Dr. Martin Luther
King, Jr. and other leaders in the
black community.
Allison and other speakers
noted the irony that the birthday
celebration for King, who strongly
supported non-violence and obe
jected to the Vietnam War, coin
cided with the deadline that
legally sanctions the use of force
in the Persian Gulf.
Allison urged all people to sup
port conscientious objectors, say
ing, "We are the only people who
can stop this war — Congress
can't, Bush won't, and the mili
tary isn't able to. Take a stand on
this war that will actually be able
to make a difference."
