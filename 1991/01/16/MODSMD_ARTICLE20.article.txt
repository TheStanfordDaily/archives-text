## ASSU members ignore basic democratic principles 
### 
IN A JAN. 10 LETTER to The Daily,
several ASSU senators and Council of
Presidents members presented an
argument opposing a bill that would pre
vent the senate from passing resolutions
on non-University-related issues. It went
on to contend that "... if students want
us to take stands on national or interna
tional issues, we should do 50...."
At first glance the argument seems a
strong one, apparently based on the
democratic idea of majority rule, which
states that if most of the people want
something done, it shall be voted so.
However, many of the assumptions
that the argument makes are extremely
disturbing to me. Probably the most sig
nificant is the failure of the authors of
the letter to consider an essential ingre
dient in American democracy â€” the
parameters of power.
The political foundations of the
United States are federalist ones. That
is, there are certain delineations of
power that help lubricate the interac
tions of national, state and local govern
ment. Each of these entities has certain

powers delegated to it in accordance with
a set of understood rules that precludes
each from usurping the powers of the
others. This, the authors of the Jan. 10
letter have forgotten. Or ignored.
In this particular case, it is not a
question of what the students want, but
of what the ASSU should be able to give
them. Undoubtedly, the student body
cares about about issues external to
Stanford, and I laud each student's
efforts to further a cause beyond Stan
ford.
However, those efforts should not be
introduced into or assumed by the ASSU,
because those issues are outside the
scope of the senate's authority. Dave
Brown et al. (I use this designation for
simplicity's sake, not to single out
Brown) assert that they should be able
to pass policy on any issue they please
and even quote the article that gives
them this power.
Yet it seems to me (and to many oth
ers with whom I have spoken) that not
only the authors' argument, but also the
article itself, is flawed from the

beginning, especially in the light of the
American system of political machina
tions.
Here I shall provide two examples:
President Bush is, most likely, fairly
concerned with the welfare and local pol
itics of Kennebunkport, Maine. He
spends a great deal of time there, has
historical ties to the town, and undoubt
edly an interest in its welfare. However,
he does not introduce bills into Congress
that directly try to affect the local poli
tics or daily life of Kennebunkport. Why?
Simply because such action is outside his
realm of delegated power.
A second example: the San Jose City
Council, while undoubtedly concerned
with the welfare of the entire nation,
both domestically and internationally,
does not draft or pass bills, laws or any
kind of policy that would attempt to
change the nation's course of action. All
of its resolutions are confined to local
events and issues.
In spite of these political precedents,
the senate has in the past (and attempts

to do so in the present) usurped power to
which it has no right. It has justified its
power-grabbing by saying that the stu
dent body supports its policies. The fact
remains, however, that while the student
body has every right to make such
demands (for that is its right of free
speech), the ASSU has no right to fulfill
such demands, for it oversteps the
bounds of its responsibilities.
The bill before the senate seeks to
state what the parameters of power for
that body are: namely, "University
related matters of an academic, adminis
trative, fiscal and social nature." Its
value, it seems to me, is undeniable. The
powers of this body obviously need pre
cise definitions because there are those
such as Dave Brown et al. that would
pervert the responsibilities of the ASSU
to include issues outside its vested
domain.
I urge every student to think about
this issue, especially in the light of
American democracy as a whole.
