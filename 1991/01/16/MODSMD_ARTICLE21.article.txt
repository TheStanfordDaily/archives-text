# U.S. should go to war with Iraq to provide protection for its interests abroad
## 
### 
I find it interesting that I haven't
seen a single story supporting U.S.
involvement in the Middle East. Is this
because there is genuinely no real sup
port among the student body, or is this
just a case of editorial prerogative?
In any case, I feel it necessary to
respond to the misguided, narrow
minded and nearsighted views that have
been so prevalent in these pages.
The thing that I read first that
brought such amazement (and amuse
ment) to me was the comment that if the

United States was so terribly concerned
with the well-being of other countries
experiencing internal conflicts and/or
oppression (i.e. Lebanon), then why
haven't we engaged in direct and mas
sive military action in those cases?
The answer to that question goes
along with my response to the other bit
of silliness I have been reading. Someone
said that the only reason we are even in
Saudi Arabia right now is because of the
threat to American interests there
(implying that that threat was not suffi
cient motivation).
My response to that would be, well,
yes, of course. I think that if this country
got itself into every little conflict that
erupted, we would soon get an even
worse reputation in the world.

In the case of Kuwait, the unprovoked
invasion by Iraq has posed a direct
threat to American interests in this
region. I know some people think that
cheap gasoline is not reason enough to
spend billions of dollars and possibly
hundreds (or thousands) of lives, and
that the United States has no business
being there.
Those people should really take a look
around. In case they hadn't noticed, the
world literally runs on oil, and that oil
supply needs to be dependable, constant
and, yes, affordable.
Nobody wants to have a war; the price
is always high. But those who say we
should do more to try for a peaceful solu
tion, who say that it is an Arab problem
and the Arabs should handle it, who say

the vital interests of the United States
are not at stake, are the same people
who decried U.S. involvement in the
events that led up to World War 11. The
time to take a strong stand is now.
I'm just sorry to see that we still have
a lot of people who are letting themselves
be persuaded by ignorance and fear into
a position of appeasement that can only,
in the long run, make things worse.
Wake up and smell the coffee. The
world is not a perfect place and mis
guided idealism like that will just play
into the hands of those who would use it
for their own purposes.
