## Situation in Kuwait is direct result of United States policy 
### 
David chan, writing in the
Jan. 7 Daily, offers us an "alle
gory" in which Kuwait is perse
cuted by Iraq, the bully, and abandoned
by America, the body-builder. Let us
undertake a more extended "character"
analysis, starting with Kuwait as "vic
tim," and the "silly" argument that
Kuwait is not a democracy.
Chan asks, "Does anyone seriously
believe that Kuwaitis are better off
under Saddam Hussein than they were
under the Kuwaiti royal family?"
It depends on what you mean by
"Kuwaitis." Are we talking about only a
small portion (26 percent) of those who
inhabit the geographical space desig
nated as Kuwait, or are we also con
cerned with the other 74 percent of those
denied the political, social, economic and
religious privileges enjoyed by the 26
percent who reserve for themselves for
mal status as citizens?
Should we ignore the manifestly
unjust practice of economic and political

exclusion that is directly responsible for
poverty, disease and death in this
"migrant" and anonymous 76 percent?
Should we ignore how the 26 percent
is "better off" under the royal family
because of its irrefutable and well-estab
lished (if largely unreported) economic
and political advantages over the anony
mous msyority?
The answer to Chan's misleading
question is that there is good reason to
believe most of the human beings in
Kuwait will be better off under Hussein
than they were under the royal family. It
is difficult to see why anyone should be
obliged to assist Kuwait now that its
elite has had to forfeit the spoils of the
old despotism.
What does this say for the body
builder and his buddies in the Middle-
Eastern neighborhood? Chan says the
body-builder neglects the rest of the
world out of a "Eurocentric" disdain now
that it has nothing to fear at the end of
the Cold War, "Since the end of World

War 11, only North America and Europe
have been in peace, while wars have con
tinued to ravage the rest of the world."
The statement is unconditionally
false. If Chan means to say no military
hostilities have been carried out in the
physical space designated North Amer
ica, he is mistaken. Warfare is, and has
been, a fact for Guatemala, Nicaragua,
El Salvador, Haiti, Grenada and Panama,
among others.
I'm sure Chan does not consider the
ravages of poverty and racism a form of
warfare, and so will never concede the
war within the United States itself. Even
so, the United States has intervened
directly, with manpower, secret intelli
gence (an oxymoron) and capital, in each
of the regions just named.
If Chan means to say that North
America (read "the United States," in an
apparent "Eurocentric" slip) is not
responsible for or involved in Korea,
Vietnam, Cambodia, the Phillipines,
South Africa, Zambia and a number of

other places around the world, his state
ment is still false.
Let us recall the "genealogy" of the
body-builder and the bully. Chan failed
to mention how the body-builder invited
the bully into his gymnasium, provided
training manuals and equipment, money,
steroids and all manner of assistance.
This was undertaken to neutralize an
enemy in common (Iran).
But recall that Iran also used to be a
former training partner of the body
builder. First Iran "turned" on the body
builder so that the body-builder
befriended the bully. Now, in the same
fashion, the new bully has "turned."
Does Chan know that the United States
right now is befriending yet another for
mer "bully" (Syria) in the interests of
combating the old bully? This pattern
has been repeated by the body-builder
throughout the last century in the Mid
dle-Eastern neighborhood.
It's time the body-builder stopped his
own bullying. The time to stop is now, in

Kuwait. The body-builder doesn't own
the neighborhood; he is one neighbor
among others. It's time he put the
Rambo-bragging fantasy of the bad-assed
meat-man on ice.
More to the point, the situation in
Kuwait is a direct result of long-standing
U.S. policy in that region. Even if we
nuke Saddam into the hyper-infamy of
Hitler-hell, we have already set the stage
for exactly the same scenario in Syria,
Libya, Jordan, Beirut and the Pales
tinian detention camps. As such, the
problem is vastly more complex than the
caricature you offer.
In short, I ask Chan, a publicly pro
fessed graduate student of philosophy, to
stop writing fairy tales and to enter the
debate concerning global politics with a
little more respect for those who don't
agree with you. Let me therefore send
your closing words back home with you.
Shame on you, Chan.
