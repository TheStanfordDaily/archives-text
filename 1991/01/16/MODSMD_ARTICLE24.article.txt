# Pacifism should not prevent Allison from fulfilling her duties
## 
### 
I DON'T GET IT. Maybe it's just me,
but there seems to be a glaring non
sequitur in Aimde Allison's view
point.
Like all of us, she believes war is bad.
Like almost all of us, including George
Bush and the 127 veterans in Congress
who voted for the Solarz and
Dole/Lieberman Resolutions, she knows
the suffering war brings. Like most of
us, she believes killing, specifically an

invasion of Kuwait and Iraq, is the
wrong way to resolve disputes.
But what does this have to do with
whether or not she goes to Saudi Arabia?
She's a medic. It is her job to heal, not to
kill. If, God forbid, combat does ensue in
the Middle East, she will be called upon
to save the lives of the million U.S. and
allied troops in the area and, if we "win,"
to serve the needs of the remaining peo
ple of Kuwait.

She will be called upon to do what
hundreds of conscientious objectors,
including at least two Congressional
Medal of Honor recipients, have done in
the past â€” to care for our brothers and
sisters in combat without firing a shot.
Walt Whitman, no friend of militarism
and imperialism, served as a combat
medic. Pacifism has not and should not
prevent one from risking one's neck to
save lives.

The only argument supporting Alli
son's stance that her morals prevent her
from saving the lives of our wounded
men and women in uniform is the rather
tenuous claim that she is indirectly sup
porting the military option. In the event
of war, the lack of her medical attention
means more people will die. This extra
bloodshed may have an incremental
deterrent effect on Bush's decision to
wage war.

I doubt it. At best, Allison is deluded
by the '60s fantasy, "What if they held a
war and nobody came?" Today, of course,
enough people have shown up that Sad
dam Hussein and the United Nations
can hold a war. If there is a war, people
will die. The only real issue is whether
Allison will face up to her responsibility
to risk becoming one of them.
