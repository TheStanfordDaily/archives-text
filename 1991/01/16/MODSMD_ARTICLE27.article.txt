## Hospital bright lights may be missing link in infant deaths 
### Julie Makinen Staff writer 
A young couple lay their
healthy, happy two-month-old
baby to bed for the night, only to
wake up and find the child dead -
suddenly, unexpectedly, without
any apparent cause. Such a sce
nario represents a "typical" case
of Sudden Infant Death Syn
drome, or SIDS.
SIDS, which strikes between
7,000 and 10,000 U.S. infants per
year, usually occurs during sleep.
Its victims are primarily between
two and four months old.
The cause of SIDS is still
unknown; however, researchers at
the Stanford Medical Center's
Pediatrics Department believe
that some interaction between the
environment and the central ner
vous system may provide the
missing puzzle piece to SIDS.
Specifically, the doctors have
postulated that the constant
brightness of hospital intensive
care units and the lack of light
dark <ycles inhibits normal devel

opment of circadian rhythms in
infants, and that this in turn may
be a contributing factor to an
infant's development of SIDS.
Until recently, researchers
were trying to uncover some tell
tale cardio-respiratory defect
which characterizes SIDS victims
— most research focused on con
trol of the infants' breathing and
heartrate.
"While this extensive effort did
produce much new information
about cardio-respiratory patterns
in newborns, it failed to provide a
diagnostic 'test' for SIDS," said
Dr. Steven Glotzbach, a senior
research scientist at the Medical
Center. •
Rather than looking for a spe
cific marker for SIDS, the team
headed by Glotzbach and Dr.
Ronald Ariagno, which includes
research groups from several
departments at Stanford as well
as from other universities, is
returning to the basics of infant
development to try to unravel the
SIDS mystery.
Ariagno, a professor of pedi

atrics, said he and Glotzbach are
taking "a multidisciplinary
approach to understanding infant
development and how it relates to
SIDS."
The researchers have quite an
ambitious agenda. They plan to
investigate infant thermoregula
tion, breathing and sleep and how
these are influenced by environ
mental factors as well as infant
age.
They will also examine infant
chronobiology - the formation of
biological rhythms and the role of
home and neonatal environments
in the establishment of these
rhythms.
Finally, based on their hypothe
ses and subsequent findings, they
will recommend changes in cur
rent home-monitoring programs
as well as changes in the design of
hospital Neonatal Intensive Care
Units (NICU).
One of the most intriguing
aspects of Ariagno and
Glotzbach's program are the stud
ies which focus on chronobiology
and the intensive care environ
ment.
They have recently been
awarded a 1.2 million dollar grant
from the National Institute of
Health to explore the develop
ment of biological rhythms in
infants, how the environment of
the intensive care unit influences
this development and the rela
tionship between intensive care
exposure and long-term infant
health.
Obviously, the constantly lit,
bright, noisy, "chaotic" (as Glozt
bach calls it) environment of the
hospital is markedly different
from the snugness of the mother's
womb.
Gloztbach hypothesizes that
this radical change in environ
ment somehow disrupts, inhibits
or alters the development and
internal synchronization of nor
mally coupled physiological sys
tems.
Such a desynchronization may
explain some of the reported
learning difficulties and sleep

problems of preterm infants after
their discharge from the intensive
care unit, as well as the increased
rate of SIDS in low birth-weight
preterm infants who spend a long
time in the hospital.
It is well known that exposure
to light and dark cycles has a pro
found effect on adult circadian
rhythms and physiological sys
tems; however, little is known
about the effects of light-dark
cycles on infants.
Recently it has been reported
that infants placed in a "light
dark" nursery early in life sleep
longer and gain weight more
quickly than infants in constantly
lit nurseries.
The advantages achieved in the
light-dark nursery persist months
after the babies are discharged
from the nursery. This prelimi
nary evidence suggests that there
are long-lasting effects of early
exposure to light-dark cycles.
Ariagno points out that "sleep,
feeding, and weight gain, as well
as homeostatic functions such as
temperature regulation and respi
ration, are all partly under the
control of the hypothalamic nuclei
of the brain, including the Super
chiasmatic Nuclei (SCN), which
constitutes the body's "biological
clock."
Curiously enough, the SCN is
connected through neural path
ways to the retina of the eye.
Thus, light-dark cycles could
directly influence development of
biological rhythms which origi
nate in or are governed by the
SCN.
Glotzbach and Ariagno plan to
set up different control and exper
imental intensive care environ
ments and to monitor the effects
of light-dark cycles on the devel
opment of sleep and biological
rhythmicity.
"Problems with sleep or biolog
ical rhythmicity may destabilize
the infant in such a way so as to
increase the risk for SIDS,"
According to Gloztbach.
Ariagno and Glotzbach's
efforts will first focus on charac

terizing the fundamental pro
cesses which are involved in the
maturation of circadian rhythms
in infants.
They will try to determine the
immediate and long-term effects
of different intensive care envi
ronments on physiology and
behavior related to circadian

rhythms. Their findings may lead
to a totally new approach to
designing intensive care units, as
well as decreasing the incidence of
post-discharge illness and SIDS.
Their project comes not a
minute too soon, as many Stan
ford students of today will be the
parents of tomorrow.

Dr. Robert Arlagno and Dr. Steven Glotzbach, of the Stanford
Medical Center, are currently investigating the cause of Sudden
Infant Death Syndrome. They have hypothesized that the constant

cycles Inhibits normal development of circadian rhythms In infants,
and that this In turn may be a contributing factor to an infant's devel
opment of SIDS.
