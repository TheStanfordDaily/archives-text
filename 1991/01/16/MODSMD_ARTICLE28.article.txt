Have you ever had a rear-end
collision while driving because
you failed to estimate how hard
the driver in front of you was
braking?
If so, a group of young entre
preneurs, designers, and engi
neers at Larkin House may have
the solutidn for you.
Under the direction of Larkin
Resident Fellow Robert Harvey
and Resident Assistants Lauri
Bortscheller and James Had

REACT, which stands for Rear
End Auto Collision Time. The

of the vehicle that would indicate the
intensity of deceleration.

project is sponsored by David
Freyberg, a professor at the
school of Engineering.
As of now, a crude prototype
of the REACT system has been
made, and by the end of spring

quarter, the group plans to cre
ate a "practically marketable
prototype" that would measure
and display varying levels of
braking intensity, thus alerting
other drivers and giving them a

better idea of what to expect and
how to react.
This system would work by
connecting an inertial
accelerometer — which mea
sures how rapidly the vehicle is
accelerating or decelerating — to
the braking system.
As the accelerometer mea
sures the deceleration of the
vehicle, electric impulses are
sent to special brake lights in the
rear window of the vehicle that
would indicate the intensity of
deceleration.
The present model has three
pairs of lights arranged horizon
tally, measuring three levels of
braking efforts.
At minimal braking effort,
the two lights in the middle will
flash. The next level of braking
would also turn on the pair of
lights adjacent to the middle
two. Finally, maximum braking
level would turn on all six lights
by adding the two lights at the
ends.
Robert Harvey said that Pro
ject REACT is an "educational
program," which has "many
dimensions, including market
ing, business, and finance in
addition to the design and engi
neering."
According to Harvey, the pro
ject is "meant to develop five
technical skills," including team
work, research, argument and
persuasion, technical skills and
an understanding of the dynam
ics of society, such as the market,
advertising and finance.
One of the main purposes this
project serves, Harvey said, is to
expose freshmen to the engi
neering field in a more realistic
way than strictly classroom-type
courses. This he considers cru
cial in light of the decreasing
interest from students in this
country toward engineering.
"There's a need for leadership
in the field of engineering," Har
vey added. "Hopefully, Project
REACT will help."
