Asbestos alert
So, you're downstairs in the
basement of Stern Hall; maybe
you're about to do the laundry
that's been piling up for the past
month (you just ran out of
underwear) or maybe you're bee
lining for the studyroom, pre
pared to spend the next nine to

ten hours getting ahead in your
classes (yeah, right — good luck).
Anyway, for whatever reason,
you happen to momentarily raise
your eyes as you're walking
down the dark dismal hall, and,
to complete the picture, you see
dusty signs on the dusty pipes
that read, "WARNING:
ASBESTOS - DO NOT CRE

ATE DUST"
"Oh, great," you think, "this
is just perfect."
Well, don't fret.
Acccording to Mary
Dougherty, a health and safety
specialist and Stanford, "the
presence of asbestos-containing
materials in a home or office
isn't in itself a cause for alarm.

unless the asbestos fibers
become airborne and are
inhaled."
Chances are, the dust on the
pipes is not asbestos laden,
unless the material is deteriorat
ed or damaged (or if you have
exceedingly bad luck — hello,
draw number 2,999).
