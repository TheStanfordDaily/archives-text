# Fetter savors seven 'Super!' years as dean of admissions
## 
### Marie Bui Staff writer 
One Saturday morning in June
1984, University President Don
ald Kennedy called Jean Fetter to
his office and asked her to take
the position as dean of admis
sions. '
"Immediately after I replied
yes, I was thinking, 'Oh my gosh,
can I do this?'" Fetter recalled.
After seven years and more
than 100,000 applications, Fetter
is ready to pass on the responsibil
ity.
But more people will be
touched by Fetter's departure on
Aug. 31 than the scores of under

graduates who fondly remember
her trademark: the words
"Bravo!" or "Super!" written on
their acceptance letters. Her office
staff fnight say those same words
about her.
When she accepted the position
in 1984, Fetter said she knew it
would be difficult for anyone to
handle such a demanding job for
more than five to seven years.
In a recent interview, Fetter
said her resignation is very sensi
ble, because it protects both the
Office of Undergraduate Admis
sions and herself from settling
into routines. If the office is
headed by someone who is too
entrenched, changes cannot be

introduced easily, she said. And
Fetter said she needs a respite
from her work.
"I'm a human being, not a
machine," she said with a slight
but firm British accent.
Unlike a car, she cannot simply
have a tune-up, she added.
Sitting in her comfortable
office decorated with potted
plants, NCAA baseball trophies,
old photos of Stanford and a few
postcards of her native South
Wales, the attractive dean, who is
in her fifties, said she is beginning
to realize that she has already
lived two-thirds of her life. She
plans to make the most of the next
third.
Following her official resigna
tion, Fetter will approach one of
her favorite responsibilities,
freshman advising, with renewed
enthusiasm, she said. She still
keeps in touch with advisees from
as far back as 1978.
Fetter said students and fac
ulty who tend to be high achievers
like her can benefit from her
example. The change of work will
give her perspective about the bal
ance between her personal and
professional lives, she explained.
"It's easy to get off-kilter."
Her husband Alexander Fetter,
an associate dean of humanities
and sciences at the University, has
gotten used to falling asleep at
home at 1 a.m. with the light on
while his wife reads freshman
applicant folders at a desk in their
bedroom.
"Dean Jean," as she is affec
tionately known, resigned from a
physics teaching position 23 years
ago at San Jose State University
because she felt her work eclipsed
her family life. She admitted her
resignation this year is not exactly
analogous, because her children
Anne, 27, and Andrew, 22, have
graduated from college.
"It's not quite the same as
changing diapers," she said.
Still, Alexander Fetter expects
to see his wife more often than at
breakfast and dinnertime, as he
does now. The only problem he
foresees is "more contention over
who gets to use the computer."

Next year, while on sabbatical
at the School of Education, Jean
Fetter plans to reflect on her expe
riences in the Admissions Office
and write a personal reflection
about her career as an admissions
officer, possibly examining issues
like affirmative action and multi
culturalism.
In the office, Dean Fetter's
friendly and upbeat manner make
it a "welcoming place," explained
her secretary of six years, Mau
reen Sharon.
The receptionist, Erin Dolin,
said, "She's someone who always
has a smile and a nice word,
instead of just brushing by your
desk,"
"It's interesting that the word
that keeps coming up to describe
her is 'congenial'; it has her name
in it," said John Bunnell, who
works next door to Fetter as asso
ciate director of undergraduate
admissions.
Commenting on Fetter's habit
of riding her bicycle to work, a
habit he shares, Bunnell joked,
"When she's gone, it will be one
less parking place" that he has to
worry about.
On the first day she arrived at
the office in September 1984, Fet
ter talked to every person on the
staff, remembered Vivian Barry,
assistant dean for administration.
That kind of caring is reflected
in Fetter's management style, one
that delegates responsibility and
accountability, according to Bun
nell.
Just before Fetter took over as
dean of admissions, her predeces
sor Fred Hargadon warned 27-
year admissions veteran Bunnell
that the admissions process had to
be changed because it relied on

only a couple of people.
"If you get hit by a truck, we
won't know what to do," Har
gadon told Bunnell.
Now, responsibilities are
divided among seven assistant
and associate deans, as well as
other staff members. An eight- to
10-page document lists office
tasks and the initials of whomever
is responsible for each task.
"If we want to know something
about [Prospective Freshman
Week], we just look up that per
son" who is in charge, Bunnell
said.
At weekly staff meetings, Fet
ter consistently solicits input from
her staff, Bunnell said. She makes
people feel they can voice their
opinions without dire conse
quences, he added. Fetter said she
encourages debate by making the
staff comfortable and by hiring
very diverse people.
The system is "now built into
the culture of the office," said Jon
Reider, associate director of
admissions.
It is just one part of the legacy
Fetter leaves behind. The staff
compiled a three-page list of the
improvements that came about
during Fetter's tenure.
A concrete example of Fetter's
contributions to the office is the
addition of "power files," mam
moth containers housed on the
second floor of Old Union which
contain applicant folders.
Before the files were added,
staff members had to bend over as
many as 100 olive-drab tubs
crammed into a back room to file
away grades and letters of recom
mendation.
Fetter recognized the need for a
new system and asked staffers to

research and recommend a solu
tion. The huge new files allow fil
ers to sit down and rotate alpha
betized folders at the push of a
button.
"They're good for morale and
good for the body," said Louise
Walters, a veteran credentials
coordinator.
During Fetter's first year as
dean, the University received 17,
662 applications, the record high.
Overwhelmed, she said she would
never forget that number, but
plunged into the reading and
weeding process with surprising
skill and determination.
"Even being so completely
green, she picked it up just like
that," Bunnell said.
It is probable that memory
prompted Fetter to encourage
training and mentor programs for
all new staff.
Under Fetter, the Pro Fro pro
gram was crystallized, Bunnell
said, so that high school students
could make informed choices.
She has also left a glittering
impression on the world outside
the University, especially at high
schools, which is not an easy job,
Bunnell said.
"It's hard to make people . ..
feel good when you turn down
four out of five people."
Because she's done such a good
job, everyone in the office is sad
about her leaving, but "we'll
adapt," said Reider. "We're a pro
fessional staff. That's what she
wants us to be."
Fetter plans to keep a low pro
file next school year, so as not to
get in the way of the new dean.
She will not take part in the
search for or screening of candi
dates. But she said she hopes they

will meet with her staff.
Reider agrees.
"It wouldn't be outrageous if
someone on the staff were on the
search committee," he said.
Acting Vice President for Stu
dent Resources Sally Mahoney,
who along with Economics Prof.
John Pencavel is responsible for
organizing the search to replace
Fetter, said she wants to allow
staff to talk to candidates.
Although she has not yet met
with Pencavel, she plans to
announce the beginning of the
search in February and interview
candidates in April. Since she was
involved in the interview process
for a dean of admissions to replace
Hargadon seven years ago,
Mahoney said she is not "starting
from zero."
Candidates from inside and
outside the University will proba
bly be considered. Mahoney said
she will approach the Faculty Sen
ate Committee on Committees
and the ASSU Council of Presi
dents to find faculty and student
representatives for the search.
New candidates will have a
hard act to follow. English Prof.
Nancy Packer, who chaired the
committee that selected Fetter in
1984, said, "They won't find any
body better. Maybe they'll find
someone who'll do."
Other professors and adminis
trators pointed out the position is
one that will attract talented peo
ple.
"It's a terrible loss .. . because
we think she's done such a good
job," said Packer.
"Fetter said at the outset, 'Five
to seven years.' Time does fly
when you're having fun," said
Bunnell.

Still, Alexander Fetter expects
to see his wife more often than at
breakfast and dinnertime, as he
does now. The only problem he
foresees is "more contention over
who gets to use the computer."

Next year, while on sabbatical
at the School of Education, Jean
Fetter plans to reflect on her expe
riences in the Admissions Office
and write a personal reflection
about her career as an admissions
officer, possibly examining issues
like affirmative action and multi
culturalism.
In the office, Dean Fetter's
friendly and upbeat manner make
it a "welcoming place," explained
her secretary of six years, Mau
reen Sharon.
The receptionist, Erin Dolin,
said, "She's someone who always
has a smile and a nice word,
instead of just brushing by your
desk,"
"It's interesting that the word
that keeps coming up to describe
her is 'congenial'; it has her name
in it," said John Bunnell, who
works next door to Fetter as asso
ciate director of undergraduate
admissions.
Commenting on Fetter's habit
of riding her bicycle to work, a
habit he shares, Bunnell joked,
"When she's gone, it will be one
less parking place" that he has to
worry about.
On the first day she arrived at
the office in September 1984, Fet
ter talked to every person on the
staff, remembered Vivian Barry,
assistant dean for administration.
That kind of caring is reflected
in Fetter's management style, one
that delegates responsibility and
accountability, according to Bun
nell.
Just before Fetter took over as
dean of admissions, her predeces
sor Fred Hargadon warned 27-
year admissions veteran Bunnell
that the admissions process had to
be changed because it relied on

only a couple of people.
"If you get hit by a truck, we
won't know what to do," Har
gadon told Bunnell.
Now, responsibilities are
divided among seven assistant
and associate deans, as well as
other staff members. An eight- to
10-page document lists office
tasks and the initials of whomever
is responsible for each task.
"If we want to know something
about [Prospective Freshman
Week], we just look up that per
son" who is in charge, Bunnell
said.
At weekly staff meetings, Fet
ter consistently solicits input from
her staff, Bunnell said. She makes
people feel they can voice their
opinions without dire conse
quences, he added. Fetter said she
encourages debate by making the
staff comfortable and by hiring
very diverse people.
The system is "now built into
the culture of the office," said Jon
Reider, associate director of
admissions.
It is just one part of the legacy
Fetter leaves behind. The staff
compiled a three-page list of the
improvements that came about
during Fetter's tenure.
A concrete example of Fetter's
contributions to the office is the
addition of "power files," mam
moth containers housed on the
second floor of Old Union which
contain applicant folders.
Before the files were added,
staff members had to bend over as
many as 100 olive-drab tubs
crammed into a back room to file
away grades and letters of recom
mendation.
Fetter recognized the need for a
new system and asked staffers to

research and recommend a solu
tion. The huge new files allow fil
ers to sit down and rotate alpha
betized folders at the push of a
button.
"They're good for morale and
good for the body," said Louise
Walters, a veteran credentials
coordinator.
During Fetter's first year as
dean, the University received 17,
662 applications, the record high.
Overwhelmed, she said she would
never forget that number, but
plunged into the reading and
weeding process with surprising
skill and determination.
"Even being so completely
green, she picked it up just like
that," Bunnell said.
It is probable that memory
prompted Fetter to encourage
training and mentor programs for
all new staff.
Under Fetter, the Pro Fro pro
gram was crystallized, Bunnell
said, so that high school students
could make informed choices.
She has also left a glittering
impression on the world outside
the University, especially at high
schools, which is not an easy job,
Bunnell said.
"It's hard to make people . ..
feel good when you turn down
four out of five people."
Because she's done such a good
job, everyone in the office is sad
about her leaving, but "we'll
adapt," said Reider. "We're a pro
fessional staff. That's what she
wants us to be."
Fetter plans to keep a low pro
file next school year, so as not to
get in the way of the new dean.
She will not take part in the
search for or screening of candi
dates. But she said she hopes they

will meet with her staff.
Reider agrees.
"It wouldn't be outrageous if
someone on the staff were on the
search committee," he said.
Acting Vice President for Stu
dent Resources Sally Mahoney,
who along with Economics Prof.
John Pencavel is responsible for
organizing the search to replace
Fetter, said she wants to allow
staff to talk to candidates.
Although she has not yet met
with Pencavel, she plans to
announce the beginning of the
search in February and interview
candidates in April. Since she was
involved in the interview process
for a dean of admissions to replace
Hargadon seven years ago,
Mahoney said she is not "starting
from zero."
Candidates from inside and
outside the University will proba
bly be considered. Mahoney said
she will approach the Faculty Sen
ate Committee on Committees
and the ASSU Council of Presi
dents to find faculty and student
representatives for the search.
New candidates will have a
hard act to follow. English Prof.
Nancy Packer, who chaired the
committee that selected Fetter in
1984, said, "They won't find any
body better. Maybe they'll find
someone who'll do."
Other professors and adminis
trators pointed out the position is
one that will attract talented peo
ple.
"It's a terrible loss .. . because
we think she's done such a good
job," said Packer.
"Fetter said at the outset, 'Five
to seven years.' Time does fly
when you're having fun," said
Bunnell.
One Saturday morning in June
1984, University President Don
ald Kennedy called Jean Fetter to
his office and asked her to take
the position as dean of admis
sions. '
"Immediately after I replied
yes, I was thinking, 'Oh my gosh,
can I do this?'" Fetter recalled.
After seven years and more
than 100,000 applications, Fetter
is ready to pass on the responsibil
ity.
But more people will be
touched by Fetter's departure on
Aug. 31 than the scores of under

graduates who fondly remember
her trademark: the words
"Bravo!" or "Super!" written on
their acceptance letters. Her office
staff fnight say those same words
about her.
When she accepted the position
in 1984, Fetter said she knew it
would be difficult for anyone to
handle such a demanding job for
more than five to seven years.
In a recent interview, Fetter
said her resignation is very sensi
ble, because it protects both the
Office of Undergraduate Admis
sions and herself from settling
into routines. If the office is
headed by someone who is too
entrenched, changes cannot be

introduced easily, she said. And
Fetter said she needs a respite
from her work.
"I'm a human being, not a
machine," she said with a slight
but firm British accent.
Unlike a car, she cannot simply
have a tune-up, she added.
Sitting in her comfortable
office decorated with potted
plants, NCAA baseball trophies,
old photos of Stanford and a few
postcards of her native South
Wales, the attractive dean, who is
in her fifties, said she is beginning
to realize that she has already
lived two-thirds of her life. She
plans to make the most of the next
third.
Following her official resigna
tion, Fetter will approach one of
her favorite responsibilities,
freshman advising, with renewed
enthusiasm, she said. She still
keeps in touch with advisees from
as far back as 1978.
Fetter said students and fac
ulty who tend to be high achievers
like her can benefit from her
example. The change of work will
give her perspective about the bal
ance between her personal and
professional lives, she explained.
"It's easy to get off-kilter."
Her husband Alexander Fetter,
an associate dean of humanities
and sciences at the University, has
gotten used to falling asleep at
home at 1 a.m. with the light on
while his wife reads freshman
applicant folders at a desk in their
bedroom.
"Dean Jean," as she is affec
tionately known, resigned from a
physics teaching position 23 years
ago at San Jose State University
because she felt her work eclipsed
her family life. She admitted her
resignation this year is not exactly
analogous, because her children
Anne, 27, and Andrew, 22, have
graduated from college.
"It's not quite the same as
changing diapers," she said.
Still, Alexander Fetter expects
to see his wife more often than at
breakfast and dinnertime, as he
does now. The only problem he
foresees is "more contention over

second floor of Old Union which
contain applicant folders.
Before the files were added,
staff members had to bend over as
many as 100 olive-drab tubs
crammed into a back room to file
away grades and letters of recom
mendation.
Fetter recognized the need for a
new system and asked staffers to

research and recommend a solu
tion. The huge new files allow fil
ers to sit down and rotate alpha
betized folders at the push of a
button.
"They're good for morale and
good for the body," said Louise
Walters, a veteran credentials
coordinator.
During Fetter's first year as
dean, the University received 17,
662 applications, the record high.
Overwhelmed, she said she would
never forget that number, but
plunged into the reading and
weeding process with surprising
skill and determination.
"Even being so completely
green, she picked it up just like
that," Bunnell said.
It is probable that memory
prompted Fetter to encourage
training and mentor programs for
all new staff.
Under Fetter, the Pro Fro pro
gram was crystallized, Bunnell
said, so that high school students
could make informed choices.
She has also left a glittering
impression on the world outside
the University, especially at high
schools, which is not an easy job,
Bunnell said.
"It's hard to make people . ..
feel good when you turn down
four out of five people."
Because she's done such a good
job, everyone in the office is sad
about her leaving, but "we'll
adapt," said Reider. "We're a pro
fessional staff. That's what she
wants us to be."
Fetter plans to keep a low pro
file next school year, so as not to
get in the way of the new dean.
She will not take part in the
search for or screening of candi
dates. But she said she hopes they

will meet with her staff.
Reider agrees.
"It wouldn't be outrageous if
someone on the staff were on the
search committee," he said.
Acting Vice President for Stu
dent Resources Sally Mahoney,
who along with Economics Prof.
John Pencavel is responsible for
organizing the search to replace
Fetter, said she wants to allow
staff to talk to candidates.
Although she has not yet met
with Pencavel, she plans to
announce the beginning of the
search in February and interview
candidates in April. Since she was
involved in the interview process
for a dean of admissions to replace
Hargadon seven years ago,
Mahoney said she is not "starting
from zero."
Candidates from inside and
outside the University will proba
bly be considered. Mahoney said
she will approach the Faculty Sen
ate Committee on Committees
and the ASSU Council of Presi
dents to find faculty and student
representatives for the search.
New candidates will have a
hard act to follow. English Prof.
Nancy Packer, who chaired the
committee that selected Fetter in
1984, said, "They won't find any
body better. Maybe they'll find
someone who'll do."
Other professors and adminis
trators pointed out the position is
one that will attract talented peo
ple.
"It's a terrible loss .. . because
we think she's done such a good
job," said Packer.
"Fetter said at the outset, 'Five
to seven years.' Time does fly
when you're having fun," said
Bunnell.
