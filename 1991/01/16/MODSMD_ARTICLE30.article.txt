Q i What is ear wax? Will it
• build up indefinitely, and
wny does it taste so bad?
A .Ear wax, known in the ear
• business as "cerumen", is a
substance secreted by the seba
ceous and ceruminous glands in
the ear canal. It forms a protective
barrier against infection by molds
and fungi, and it even contains
antibiotics which are effective at
killing bacteria. Another hypo
thetical function of cerumen is to
keep insects from entering the ear
and laying eggs.

Although we Science Bugs had
a difficult time finding volunteers
for the Ear Wax Taste Test, we are
confident that as the recollections
of recent holiday feasts wane from
people's memories, we will find
some test subjects who tire of
Tresidder food.
However, since ear wax con
tains a wide variety of chemicals
such as fatty acids, lipids and even
cholesterol, its chemical composi
tion may help explain its bad
taste. (Note: we are relying on the
questioner's assessment of ear
wax's culinary properties.)
Ear wax is normally produced
at the rate of about 2 milligrams
per week and is present at about
5-10 milligrams total per ear. If
left unchecked, the wax does NOT
build up indefinitely but instead
reaches a natural level necessary
for protection against those germs
and bugs.
So the next time you ram a Q-
Tip into your ear and risk ruptur
ing the ear drum and pushing the
wax even farther back, think

about the movie "Star Trek II" —
if Chekov didn't have unnaturally
clean ears, the creature that
entered his brain would have
instead been left with a bad taste
in its mouth.
. What is the jet stream,
• where does it come from,
ana what good is it?
A .Atmospheric jet streams
• were discovered toward the
end of World War II by U.S.
bomber pilots over Japan, and by
German reconnaissance aircraft
over the Mediterranean.
The World Meteorological
Organization defines a jet stream
as a strong, narrow air current
that is concentrated along a
nearly horizontal axis in the
upper troposphere or stratosphere
(10 to 50 kilometers altitude).
The strongest winds known in
jet streams have been encoun
tered over Japan, where speeds up
to 500 kilometers per hour (close
to 300 knots, for those who refuse
to think metrically) occur.
Because of their strong winds,
jet stream,3 play an important role
in the economy of air traffic. Tail
winds speed transit and save fuel,
head winch do th-i opposite.
Where do jet streams come
from? Skipping the technical
details, which requir? a working
knowledge of differential equa
tions, fluid mechanics and some of
the stuff Newton thought about
after he was hit on the head by a
Macintosh, the jet stream comes
about by the interaction of two
global phenomena: the earth is
warm at the equator and cold at
the poles, and the equator is fur
ther from the earth's axis of rota
tion than are the poles.
This warm-cold thing sets up a
circulation where warm air rises
in the tropics, moves polewards at
high altitudes, and sinks again at
the higher latitudes, finally flow
ing near the earth's surface back
to the equator.
As an air parcel moves north
ward, the distance between it and
the axis of rotation of the earth
decreases.
To conserve angular momen
tum, the speed of this air parcel
must increase as its distance from
the axis decreases. (Picture the
spinning ice skater: arms out,
slow; arms in, fast (Bushspeak, so
sorry). Anyway, all this armwav
ing results in an increase in speed
as the air parcel moves north
ward, producing a strong east
wind commonly known as the jet
stream.
