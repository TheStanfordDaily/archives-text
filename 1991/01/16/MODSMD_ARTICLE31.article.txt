# Exploring the ethics of eugenics
## 
### Chris Patil Staff writer 
Does research on human heredity pave the
way for genetic manipulation of human
beings?
Is our species heading toward a dark future
of genetically engineered superbabies and
mandatory human breeding programs?
Not according to CalTech Histojry Professor
Daniel Kevles, who addressed these questions
Saturday at the Stanford Centennial Sympo
sium on the Human Genome Project in a
speech entitled, "The Eugenic Prospects: Is
the Past Prologue?"
The term "eugenics," coined in the late
19th century by a cousin of Charles Darwin, is
derived from Greek roots meaning "good
birth."
"The shadow of the eugenic past hangs over
any discussion of the social implications of
human genetics," Kevles began "It hangs par
ticularly over consideration of the potential
impact of the Human Genome Initiative."
However, Kevles eventually concluded that
"what bedeviled our forebears will not neces
sarily vex us," after discussing the social fac
tors preventing abuses of genetic knowledge in
this country.
Kevles introduced the issue by providing a
historical perspective on eugenic thought in
the United States.
During the first quarter of the 20th cen
tury, he explained, the eugenic movement had
a wide following among white professionals of
the upper and middle classes. Eugenic organi
zations shared the goal of "getting rid of the
so-called 'undesirables' and propagating the
so-called 'desirables.'"
Eugenicists hoped to fulfill their goal in two
ways: through "positive" eugenics, the manip
ulation of human breeding; and through "neg
ative" eugenics, which entails the elimination
of "tainted" individuals from the gene pool.

After World War 11, reports of atrocities per
petrated by the Nazi "Racial Hygiene" pro
gram stamped negative eugenics as a brutal,
racist doctrine. Only in the light of recent
advances in genetics, Kevles said, have individ
uals been willing to discuss any manipulation
of human genes.

gram stamped negative

of human genes.

"Some commentators have warned that the
Human Genome Initiative may stimulate a
movement toward a new positive eugenics —
that it will lead to attempts to engineer new
Einsteins, Mozarts and Kareem Abdul-Jab
bars.
"However, I doubt that advances in genetic
knowledge will lead to a revival of attempts to
produce a super race," Kevles said, explaining
that while the project will reveal the genes for
physical traits, it is virtually impossible to
demonstrate genetic causes for complex, envi
ronmentally influenced abilities like intelli
gence or athletic prowess.
However, most who are concerned about
the prospects of genetic abuses fear an advent
of negative eugenics, Kevles said, describing a
scenario of taxpayer rebellion against the ris

ing cost of caring for the genetically disabled.
However, he indicated the probability that
increased knowledge of genetic disease might
make taxpayers more willing to bear such
costs.
"To be sure, the more that is learned about
human genetics, the more it will be realized
that we all are prone to some genetic disease,"
he said.
Even in the presence of political pressure
for negative eugenics, he continued, "a num
ber of social factors are likely to offset a sce
nario of socially controlled reproduction, let
alone a revival of broad-based eugenics."
Kevles cited procedural checks such as the
Bill of Rights, coupled with the newfound
political empowerment of minority and dis
abled groups as the primary barrier against
such programs.
"If a Nazi-like eugenics program becomes a
threatening reality here," he noted, "we will
have a great deal more to worry about politi
cally than just eugenics."
If anything, increasing knowledge of the
genome would prevent scientists from backing
such measures.
"Geneticists today know much better than
their predecessors that ideas concerning what
is good for the gene pool are highly problem
atic," Kevles said.
Furthermore, existing attitudes about
genetic manipulation would prevent abuse of
new knowledge.
"Awareness of the barbarities and cruelties
of past eugenics has tended to make geneti
cists and even more so the public, extremely
cautious about embracing anything that
smacks of eugenics," Kevles said.
"The eugenic past is prologue only in a tem
poral sense," he concluded, "that is, only in the
sense that it preceded our own day.
"We can surely learn from the eugenic past
how to avoid repeating its mistakes, not to
mention its sins."
