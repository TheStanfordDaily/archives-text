# Genome Project may yield clues to cancer

Insight into the genetic causes
of cancer will greatly assist the
quest for new methods of diagno
sis and treatment, Dr. Harold Var
mus said Saturday at the Stanford
Centennial Symposium.
In a speech entitled "The
Genetic Basis of Cancer," Varmus
discussed the potential impacts of
the Human Genome Project on
various aspects of cancer re
search. Varmus, a professor of
microbiology at UC-San Fran
cisco, is himself an oncologist.
"Cancer is fundamentally a dis
ease that arises from a genome
that has Buffered insults," Var
mus explained. "Even 20 or 30
years ago, it was well-established
that cancer in its many forms is
mainly a genetic disease."
Most cancers are caused when
human genes come in contact
with a mutagen, a physical or
chemical agent that directly dam
ages DNA. The resultant damaged
gene, now called an "oncogene,"

triggers uncontrolled replication
of the damaged cell.
It is already known that can
cer-causing mutations fall under
two general categories. In one
case, cell growth "accelerators"
called proto-oncogenes are
enhanced by mutagenic change.
In other situations, tumor sup
pressor genes analogous to
"brakes" are weakened, allowing
for uncontrolled cell growth.
However, a great deal more
information is required before
this knowledge can play a
role in developing treatments or
cures for most cancers.
Consequently, "although some
role for nongenetic mechanisms is
not fully excluded,'Wths genetic
mutations that occur at the onset
of cancer are at the focus of cur
rent research.
"In a significant number of
tumors, it is possible to identify
the collection of mutations that
conspire to create a tumor," he
said. Using recently developed
tools of molecular biology, "any
tumor can be profiled molecularly,

but in few situations does this
improve the pathology of the dis
ease."
Because only one or two dam
aged genes, called "oncogenes,"
distinguish damaged cells from
healthy cells, it is crucial that
oncologists have a thorough
understanding of the normal
function of the entire human
genome, Varmus said. It is in pro
viding this catalog of data that the
Human Genome project is instru
mental to future developments in
cancer research, he added.
Varmus predicts that prenatal
assessment of risk for hereditary
cancers will be among the first
diagnostic tools made possible by
the ttumtni' GenmrfcrTrsJeet:
While some such testing is already
possible, he notes, new knowledge
of genetic function will help doc
tors more accurately inform par
ents of the degree to which their
potential child is predisposed
toward a particular disease.
Among the more exciting long
term ramifications of increased
genomic knowledge is the possibil

ity of treating cancer genetically,
Varmus continued. Such "gene
therapy" would function, simply
speaking, by somehow interfering
with the accelerator oncogenes or
by inserting new, healthy copies of
the brake genes into tumor cells.
Varmus warns that despite the
rapid advances in knowledge the
project will bring, gene therapy is
nonetheless a distant goal.
"The functional importance of
each mutation in each tumor may
be necessary," he emphasized,
implying that a comprehensive
knowledge of the normal genome
must precede the beginning of
gene therapy efforts.
Moreover, healthy cells might
*be damaged in the process of
inserting normal genetic material
into tumor cells. This danger
necessitates the development of
hyperaccurate gene delivery sys
tems.
"Our growing knowledge in
this area may be a cause for opti
mism," Varmus concluded, "but it
must remain a cautious optimism
at present."
