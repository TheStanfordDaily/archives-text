# Research in genetics increases knowledge, potential for misuse
## 
### Steve McCarroll 
Scientists, journalists,
activists and a theologian
debated whether the Human
Genome Project is a boon or a
bane in the culminating forum
of last weekend's Centennial
Symposium.
They agreed only that the
answer will lie in how society
responds to the tremendous
amount of information which
the project will lay at its feet
The Human Genome Pro
ject is a multi-billion dollar
undertaking by the U.S. gov
ernment that aims to map the
entire human genome — the
basic genetic make-up as dis
played by DNA on the 23 pairs
of chromosomes in normal
human cells.
"The greatest challenge of
the Human Genome Project
will not be the science itself,"
said Eric Lander, a professor of
biology at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, whose
work on genetic illnesses was
also presented at the sympo
sium.
Rather, the challenge will be
one of assimilating a new
vision of the human constitu
tion into a society that may not
be prepared to accommodate it.
David Perlman, Science Edi
tor of the San Francisco
Chronicle, predicted that by
the year 2040 "we will have
accumulated an enormous
amount of knowledge," and
"we will have the potential to
apply this knowledge."
Genetic diseases, for exam
ple, might be conquered. The
genome project may have
yielded a dramatically new
approach for designing
medicines as well.
But there will also be the
potential, nearly everyone
agrees, for tremendous misuse
of that same information.
Insurance companies, for
example, could conceivably use
the information to discrimi
nate against clients on the
basis of their genetic makeup.
Carriers of potential genetic iII
tieSSWTTM tWUII'W!" Wbqk" genes
such as a predisposition to
heart disease, would find them
selves and their families vic
timized.
Furthermore employers,
who often insure their employ
ees against illness, would be
reluctant to hire a person with
genetic weaknesses. Since

almost all large companies self
insure, 160 million Americans
might be affected.
"This is not a problem
unique to genetic illnesses,"
Stanford Law Professor Henry
Greely had pointed out Satur
day in his own address. Diabet
ics, cancer victims and people
with weight problems already
face such discrimination.
"All the Human Genome
Project will do is expand the
number of things which insur
ance companies might discrim
inate on the basis of," Greely
said.
Rather than being an evil in
itself, what the Human
Genome Project does, accord
ing to Greely, is highlight a flaw
already existing in society.
"The problem we have is that
our health insurance system
stinks," said Greely, to thun
derous applause.
Whether or not the others
shared Greely's conclusion, the
underlying principle — that
the genome project functions
less as a new and imposing
threat than as a litmus test
that exposes some of our soci
ety's most profound weak
nesses — characterized the
reflections of almost all the
panelists.
That, if anything, was the
consensus reached by Sunday's
panelists.
It was also the central
theme in their discussion of
another implication of the
genome project — the possibil
ity of abortion of fetuses with
genetic defects.
Genetic screening of fetuses
will enable doctors to identify
defective genes in unborn
babies. Some of these genes
may indicate painful and immi
nently fatal genetic disease.
Others, like the genes for
Huntington's disease, may
indicate the potential for a dis
ease that will occur only after
40 years of productive life.
Other genes may indicate only
qualities undesired by the par
ents, such as congenital birth

Lander pointed out that the
issue of abortion is by no
means a result of the genome
project itself. The problem, he
claimed, lies in a society that
has still not come to terms with
the process of abortion. The
genome project only underlines
an already existing division.
