## Aussie hero Vlahov stifles opponents' offenses 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
All basketball players, at least
once in their careers, spend
a night in Hoops Heaven:
every shot falls; rebounds race to
their hands; absolutely everything
goes right.
Five months ago this week,
Stanford forward Andrew Vlahov
got to spend his night in Heaven.
Actually, Vlahov was in
Argentina, getting ready to play
for his native Australia in the
World Basketball Championships.
The game on that August night
would pit Australia against Brazil
in a game the Aussies had to win
in order to advance to the eight
team playoff. And, in this crucial
game, Vlahov would be playing
probably the most crucial role on
the team:
He had to guard Oscar
Schmidt.
You remember Oscar: he scored
46 points in a 120-115 win over
the U.S. at the Pan Am games in

1987 — the only time in history
the Americans didn't win the Pan
Am gold. He led the Italian pro
league in scoring five years in a
row. He averaged 35 points a game
in the 1990 Goodwill Games — 42
against Australia in a five-point
Brazil win.
If you're Vlahov, a 21-year-old
baby by international standards
(Schmidt is 32), you don't just go
out and try to guard Brazil's
international star — he's so big all
you have to do is say "Oscar," and
Brazilians know exactly who you
mean — with the weight of your
own country's hopes pounding
you on the back.
First, you throw up.
Then — only if you happen to
be Vlahov — you go out on the
floor and play the most perfect
game of your life: You hold
Schmidt to 18 points, score 25 of
your own, draw three charges and
foul him out with three minutes
left in the game.... and hit a 15-
foot bank shot with 35 seconds
left to give your team a one-point

win.
It's all true. Well, he didn't
really throw up before the game,
but he was still pretty nervous.
"There was all kinds of pressure,"
Vlahov says. "If we'd lost we
would've [finished] ninth through
16th, and going back to Australia
like that just wouldn't be on.
You'd rather not go back home —
we'd get all sorts of media flak
from that. We had a fairly reason
able team."
Apparently so. And what did
Vlahov think of his performance?
"I had a good game," he smiles.
We should all have games that
good.
The Brazilians got their
revenge several days later, in the
fifth-place contest — two His
panic officials whistled Vlahov for
four nonexistent fouls in the first
minute and a half of play — but
that certainly wasn't going to tar
nish his memoiy of that one beau
tiful game.
"I'd scored lots more points in
other games," Vlahov says, "but
as far as meaningful games, that
is definitely the best game I've
ever played. And probably will
ever play."
— —lahov has, of course, had
\ / more than a few good games
V at Stanford, where he's been
starting at power forward/defen
sive banger for most of the last
three seasons.
In fact, Vlahov is one of the
major reasons that the Cardinal is
taking a one-game winning streak
into Pauley Pavilion tonight to
face No. 7 UCLA. Stanford was
oh-for-24 in Pauley before last
year, when Vlahov scored 20
points and grabbed eight
rebounds to help end the jinx, 70-
69. It was the fourth straight
Stanford win over the Bruins.
"Beating UCLA twice last year
has got to be a highlight (of my
career), because we were such an
underrated team," Vlahov says.
"That was an especially sweet vic
tory down there."
The 20 points were (and still
are) a career high, but Vlahov
really couldn't care less. "Scoring
points, well, I don't really get too
hung up about it,"he says. "Doing
other things and just winning in
general is more important than
any numbers you put up. (What
matters is) we beat them down
there for the first time, and that
was a great feeling."
It's also a great feeling just to
be able to play — and that's some
thing Vlahov has become
painfully aware of in the last few
weeks.
A few days before the Cardi
nal's home game against Florida
on Dec. 21, Vlahov was practicing

at Maples Pavilion when he
jammed his right foot and aggra
vated a spur in his talus (ankle)
bone. He's been hobbling ever
since — so much that, even
though he hasn't missed a start
yet, Vlahov hasn't practiced at all
in over three weeks.
"There's a pain level that it
doesn't ever go below," Vlahov
says. "Then [the pain] goes up
when I play or work out on it, and
then I try to bring it back down to
that low level between games.
That's why I don't practice,
because then it would be too
painful for the games."
Not having to practice may
sound like a great deal, but Vlahov
isn't very happy with the example
he's setting. While the other play
ers bust their tails on the court,
he's on the sideline — shooting,
watching and fuming.
"I don't like the special treat
ment I'm getting — not practic
ing, but still getting to play, Vla
hov says. "That doesn't sit right
with me.
"I understand that that's the
way it's got to be at the moment
and I'm really happy, and thank
ful, that the guys realize that as
well, that I'm not trying to cheat
the system and not practice but
still play," he continues. "It's not
like that. I'd rather practice."
Stanford coach Mike Mont
gomery would also rather have
the senior forward practice, but
until that happens he'll take what
he can get.
"There's really no point in not
starting him, as long as he can
go," Montgomery said. "This has
been hard on him — he's really
shown a lot of courage. . . . It's
tough on the other guys as well,
because they're in there practic
ing while someone else gets to
start, but I'm sure they under
stand."
Montgomery probably doesn't
mind Vlahov not practicing,
because — this is where it gets
screwy — Vlahov started playing
some of the best basketball of his
Stanford career after the injury.
In his last four games, Vlahov
— whose career shooting percent
age before this year was .408 —
has made 21 of 28 shots (.750) to
raise his season mark to .529. At
Oregon two Sundays ago he
scored a season-high 18 points,
grabbed 11 rebounds and had five
assists while playing all forty-five
minutes of the overtime game. For
the season, Vlahov is averaging
11.1 points and 5.9 rebounds per
game.
"I hope [the media] realizes
what Vlahov means to this team,"
Montgomery said after Vlahov
shot 6-for-7 in Saturday's demoli
tion of Washington St."He did

such a great job defensively, going
after loose balls, getting on the
floor. . . . It's just incredible. He
makes such a difference for us."
But what the heck happened to
practice makes perfect? "F—, I
don't know," Vlahov laughs. "It's
probably always been coming.
One thing is, I think I'm shooting
the ball a lot better now because I
don't practice. All I do on the side
is just shoot. I've had a great
rhythm the last couple weeks."
And hey, if it ain't broke. . . .
Another laugh. "I'm not going to
f— the system now!" he says.
Needless to say, that's a joke —
which may be the best way for
Vlahov to deal with the situation.
The injury is severe enough to
require surgery; the only question
is when. "Right now I'm just buy
ing time until then," Vlahov says.
"I had a cortisone shot before the
Oregon games (two weeks ago),
and that calmed it down a lot. If I
didn't have that there's no way I'd
be able to play."
There won't be any more corti
sone in the future — "It'd be crazy
for me to do that, to put my health
in jeopardy," he says — so if the
pain becomes unbearable, Vla
hov's season is over. He obviously
isn't too thrilled with the thought,
and the only things that comfort
him are knowing that sometimes
the pain isn't so tfa'd — and that
he can still joke about it.
"It felt the worst it ever felt
after the Washington game, but
then [against WSUI it felt the best
it had in a game," Vlahov says."I
wish I knew why."
Stanford center Adam Keefe
has his own hypothesis, which he
used to needle Vlahov at the press
conference after the WSU game.
"A little tendency I've noticed,"
Keefe says, "is that it's interesting
how it really hurts a lot around

practice time."
"Yeah," Vlahov nods, "around
one o'clock in the afternoon, it's
really bad."
Keefe makes another crack a
few minutes later, which elicits a
wry reply.
"You know," Vlahov smiles, "I
really hope Adam makes the NBA,
'cause he'll never make it as a
comedian."
Vlahov won't be heading for
the NBA after he graduates in
June (with a degree in quantita
tive economics), because he'll be
going home to Australia to play in
the 14-team Aussie professional
league.
"It's getting more and more
popular," he says. "Crowds are
starting to pack 10,000 seat are
nas now, there's more money, bet
ter players are coming out, better
coaches, and the standards are
becoming much better. It's really
on the upswing."
It also provides a chance to
make a decent living playing at
home. "[The pay's] not as good as
the NBA, but in the NBA you play
82 games, and in Australia you
only play 30," Vlahov says."I
think it may go up to as much as
50, but right now it's cake."
Vlahov will also most likely
continue to play on the national
team for several more years — he
was the youngest player on the
squad from 1987 until this sum
mer — and that means in 1992, at
the Barcelona Olympics, he may
find himself facing the Brazilian
team — and its national hero —
once again.
And maybe, just maybe, the
Brazilian Big O will look down the
floor before the game. . . . and
remember the 21-year-old kid
who took him to school one night
in 1990.


Al Green — Dally file
Power forward Andrew Vlahov, a product of Perth, Australia, was
given the unenviable task of stopping Brazilian Oscar Schmidt in the
1990 World Basketball Championships. Schmidt entered the game
averaging over 30 ppg. He left the contest with a grand total of 18
points.
