# O spectators, where the heck art thou, spectators?

Okay, so I wasn't there either. At
least I have an excuse. I was one of
the two million or so (actually only
65,000) at the 49ers—Redskins game.
(Having grown up in the Bay Area, I actu
ally like the team most Stanford students
despise because it wins all the time, has
too much coverage, wears red, or what
ever).
But it's a disgrace that only 1,945
"fans" made it to the Stanford-Washing
ton State hoops showdown Saturday
afternoon. It really is.
The smallest Pacific 10 Conference
crowd in Stanford history watched Adam
Keefe and the Cardinal maul the
Cougars. If Keefe wasn't stuffing it in the
overwhelmed Cougars' faces, Andrew
Vlahov was muscling his way inside,
Kenny Ammann was executing perfect
bounce passes through the bewildered
WSU defense, and John Patrick was hit
ting three pointers.
The talent-laden though sometimes
schizophrenic Cardinal completely domi
nated its guests from Pullman 94-63.
And no one was there to cheer.
What's the matter with this school?
Two days earlier Stanford celebrated
its conference home opener by manhan
dling Washington 87-55 — in a half-filled
Maples Pavilion. The Cardinal was so
dominant that all five of its starters sat
out almost the entire second half — and
Keefe still tallied 26. There was a vocal

crowd lining the floor, harassing the
Huskies' every move and loving every
minute of the show, but you could almost
hear the echoes reverberating upstairs.
What's the deal?
"Wow!" you say. "So we creamed Wash
ington and Washington State. So what?
We're supposed to roll over them. Nei
ther is supposed to be any good."
The preseason prognosticators may
not have thought either of the great
Northwest's teams would challenge for
the conference title, but Washington did
kill Arizona 70-56 the week before. As in
fourth-ranked, one-previous-loss Ari
zona. The Huskies completely shut down
the Wildcats' potent inside game, making
them a team to watch out for. Until they
came to the Farm, that is.
So stop reading the Pac-10 preview and
get out to Maples. Besides, Stanford was
picked to finish third in the conference,
behind Arizona and UCLA, and compete
for an NCAA tournament berth in those
very same preseason reports. So what are
you waiting for?
Okay, the Cardinal did drop its first
two league games when it was the
favorite going into both contests, leading
some students to groan, "I didn't think
the basketball season would be over when
I got back from vacation!" It's not.
So Stanford had a little trouble during
the last two weeks of winter break, falling
to Colorado and both Oregon teams on

the road. But it did give then-No. 7 North
Carolina a scare, keeping the game close
until the buzzer. And it did cream Florida
and Central Florida. And it is now 9-5, 2-
2 in the Pac-10.
Records aside, Stanford is an excit
ing, make-things-happen team.
Keefe, who had three dunks last
Saturday, is merely the best big man in
the West, and one of the most talented in
the country. Vlahov, always a monster on
defense, has become an inside threat as
well (and even if he never gets to the bas
ket he lets you know he's there!)
Deshon Wingate has developed into a
skilled front-court player — and he is
making his presence felt when there's a
loose board. Patrick has become a solid
court leader in the point-guard spot, not
to mention a true threat from three-point
territory. Ammann's third year on the
Farm is his best yet. And coming off the
bench, guards Marcus Lollie and Kenny
Hicks are talented and exciting — if still
developing.
So stop doing those calc problem sets,
take a break from the library, and find
your way to Maples Thursday nights and
Saturday afternoons.
The fact that the Cardinal is most
likely on its way to a fourth straight post
season appearance should only be more
motivation. Even if it doesn't make the
sweet-64 (and it's going to have to have a

very impressive second half of the season
to do so), the squad is a shoo-in for the
NIT — and there's nothing shabby about
the NIT.
So for all of you bandwagoners, Stan
ford is considered successful by the rest of
the country. Why not by its own fans?
Arizona students sleep out to be able
to buy tickets. UCLA's Pauley Pavilion
has been sold out for 25 consecutive
years. Even Oregon sells out all of its
games — and it was picked to finish near
the bottom of the Pac. So why are its
stands still jam-packed with screaming
fans, while you can have any, and every,
seat in the house at Maples?
And Stanford students aren't just apa
thetic for basketball games. They seem to
have a very short memory (or just too
much work to do) when it comes to foot
ball as well. Students met the buses at
midnight when the victorious Cardinal
came back from Notre Dame, and held a
rally in White Plaza the following day.

But when Stanford took a downturn?
Fans didn't even bother to show up for
the last home game of the year against
Washington State, whom by the way,
Stanford dominated in running up a 31-
13 tally. You could have heard a pin drop
in the endzone stands. You could have
played a full court basketball game
between the fans who actually made it
out of bed and into the student section.
The players were jubilant at halting
their losing streak, especially in such a
domineering fashion. But almost every
Cardinal competitor mentioned his disap
pointment at not having any fan support.
The terms home court and home field
advantage came into being because play
ing in one's own stadium is supposed to
be a benefit, mostly because of the noisy
support given to the home team, and the
hell given to the visitors. This advantage
has almost ceased to exist on the Farm.
And it's our fault.
We want winning teams, victorious
programs, but we refuse to support what
we have, and help build for the future.
Stanford athletic teams want, and need,
your support. Their success depends on
it.

Debbie Spander is sick of hearing fellow
students complain about how other
schools' teams are so good, and why can't
ours be that way too, and then not even
bothering to go to games.
