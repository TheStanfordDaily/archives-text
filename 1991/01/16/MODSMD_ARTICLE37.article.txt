# Wrestlers look for redemption tonight after dismal start
## 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
After a long week of ii\juries
and disappointment, the Stanford
wrestling team looks to return to
respectability tonight, facing
Fresno State at 7:30 in Burnham
Pavilion.
The Cardinal season has, to
this point, been almost disastrous.
Forced to field a lineup of second
teamers and wrestlers filling in at
slots above their normal weight
classes, Stanford heads into

tonight with a 1-3-0 dual meet
record, having lost its last two by
an average of 35 points.
In addition, the team finished
eighth in last weekend's Aggie
Invitational at UC-Davis, a tour
nament that Stanford had won
three of the previous four years.
"It's been real frustrating not
wrestling our best team," said co
captain Steve Yarbrough.
"Tonight, we should finally be
able to put out our true first
team."
Indeed, the long list of return

'It's been real frus
trating not
wrestling our best
team.'

ing injured wrestlers is promising,
and is led by senior Steve Buddie.
A pre-season All-America selec
tion, the 167-pounder (2-0 in dual
meets, 15-2 overall) has been out

for ten days with bursitis in his
elbows. Buddie will return to
action tonight.
Yarbrough himself has been
fighting the flu. After struggling
in his two bouts last week, the
senior (3-1, 21-4) appeared to be
at full strength over the weekend,
going 4-0 and capturing the 177-
pound title at Davis.
Other starters who should be
back include 134-pound freshman
Lance Johnson (0-0, 9-4), 150-
pound junior Dave Sacks (2-2,6-7)
158-pound junior Matt Topham

(1-1, 2-4) and 190-pound junior
Mark Graham (2-0, 7-4).
The absence of the five injured
wrestlers has been rather
poignantly felt. Last week, their
replacements struggled to a 0-9-1
record in matches against Oregon
and Oregon State.
Another development that
bodes well for the Cardinal is the
emergence of heavyweight Scott
Whitt. A redshirt offensive line
man for the football team this fall,
he was 2-2 in the Aggie Tourna
ment, his first action of the sea

son. At 260 pounds, the freshman
is the squad's only true heavy
weight, and is expected to compete
in his first dual meet tonight.
Stanford needs every one of
these men back if it expects to
compete with Fresno State. The
Bulldogs are nationally ranked
this season, coming in undefeated
in dual meet competition.
Coach Chris Horpel is cau
tiously optimistic. "Fresno is a
tough team, but if our team is
healthy, it should be a good
match."
