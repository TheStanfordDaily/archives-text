# CAPS forced to move to Cowell
## Home of counseling service deemed seismically unsafe 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
Over a year after the Loma Pri
eta earthquake shook the Bay
Area, the Huston House, home to
Counseling and Psychological Ser
vices, has been closed due to dam
age from the temblor.
The counseling service moved
to the second floor of Cowell Stu
dent Health Center last Thursday
after its former facilities at the
Huston House were declared seis
mically unsafe.
CAPS Director Alejandro Mar
tinez said a study was commis
sioned in November to examine
the house's safety. The study
found that "the house's founda
tion could sustain up and down
movement but not lateral move
ment," a condition that makes it
unsafe, Martinez said.

Valerie Veronin, assistant vice
president for Facilities Planning
Management, said it took a year
before Huston House was
declared unsafe because other
buildings were left in worse condi
tion and were dealt with first.
She said damage to buildings in
the Quad, along the Row and in
the Stanford Museum all took pri
ority over Huston House. Univer
sity officials directed repair efforts
at several student residences
before Huston House, which is
located close to Cowell on Campus
Drive.
Houses, like Huston, which
seemed to have sustained no more
than superficial cracks were
checked in a cursory manner,
Veronin said. When CAPS decided
to have the cracks in the building
fixed last summer, a more detailed
examination was undertaken and

found damage to the foundation.
"We tried to be as careful as possi
ble when examining the buildings
for damage," Veronin said, "but
Huston House sustained damage
that was bigger than expected."
Veronin said the study of the
house is continuing and will prob
ably be completed in mid- to late
February. She estimated that
there is a 50 percent chance that
the house is repairable, and said
even if it could be fixed, the costs
would be high.
Veronin said the foundation
was already in bad condition when
the 7.1 earthquake struck. The
earthquake damage worsened the
foundation, as well as cracked
plaster and twisted the chimney
shaft, she said.
