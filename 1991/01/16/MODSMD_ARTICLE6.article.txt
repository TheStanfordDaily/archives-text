# Where did the 500 1b. statue go?
## 
### Howard Libit Staff writer 
Residents of Crothers Hall last
week reported to police the disap
pearance of a $25,000 statue
which may have been missing for
the past six months.
Crothers residents were
unsure exactly when they first
noticed that the statue was gone,
according to Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer, but it may have
been taken "sometime in mid
-1990."
"Typically, people get used to
seeing something, and then some
one notices it is missing. They ask
questions, wondering if it has
been moved but nobody knows
anything about it," Niemeyer
said. "Finally, they notify the
police about its disappearance."
The unnamed statue depicts
Bacchus, the Greek god of wine,
straddling a barrel. Wearing a
crown, gloves and high boots, he
hoists a wine mug in his right
hand with his left hand on his hip.
The statue is about three feet
high and two feet wide and weighs
about 500 pounds. Police were
unsure how such a large statue
was taken.
The statue's donor, Marvin
Kratter, estimated that it is worth
$25,000, Niemeyer said. However,
it has never been formally
appraised.
The statue used to adorn the
Jacob Ruppert Knickerbocker
Brewery in New York City. Krat
ter donated the statue to Stanford
on Dec. 12, 1969, and a plaque on
the statue bears Kratter's name.
Before notifying police,
Crothers residents listed the
statue as missing in the fall 1990

Stanford Lawyer magazine, ask
ing for its return with no ques
tions asked.
Although that offer is still
open, Niemeyer warns if the police
find the statue first, the thief will
be charged with possession of
stolen property.
