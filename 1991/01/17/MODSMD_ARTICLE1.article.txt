## Massive U.S., allied air strike pounds Iraq

CENTRAL SAUDI ARABIA
(AP) — The United States and its
allies pounded Iraq with waves of
air strikes today in a furious bid to
drive Saddam Hussein's armies
from Kuwait. "We will not fail," a
somber President Bush told the
nation.
Saddam apparently survived a
night of fire that rained down on
his capital. As the misty, smoke
shrouded day dawned in Baghdad,
he spat defiance at the allied
armies in a radio message.
"The mother of all battles is
under way!" the Iraqi president
proclaimed.
The first strike came before
dawn and a second wave followed
within hours, a Western military
official and Saudi radio said.
There was no immediate word on
any allied casualties.
Iraq claimed it shot down 14
attacking warplanes; there was no
immediate response from Wash
ington or its allies.
U.S. military officials said the
targets were strategic sites, but an
Iraqi communique said densely
populated residential areas had
been hit.
U.S. television correspondents
in the city said there was little
sign of damage in some sections of
downtown Baghdad this morning.
There was light traffic, and even
the trash collectors made their
rounds, they said.
Amid reports the raids were
successful and drew little Iraqi
resistance, oil prices fell back to
$25 a barrel in London after spik
ing up to $33 a barrel shortly after
war broke out. The price of gold
plummeted in London, opening
down nearly $20 from Wednes
day's close, and Tokyo stock prices
surged nearly 4.5 percent.
Bush ordered the release of
crude oil from U.S. strategic

petroleum reserves to try to keep
prices stable.
The United States seized the
first opportunity for a nighttime
attack after time ran out on a
United Nations deadline for Iraq
to relinquish Kuwait or face war.
The deadline expired at midnight
Tuesday EST — Wednesday
morning in Baghdad.
Saddam, whose armies overran
Kuwait in a lighting strike five
and a half months ago, had defied
diplomatic appeals, economic
sanctions and threats of force,
declaring the oil-rich emirate to be
irrevocably part of Iraq.
"Our goal is not the conquest
of Iraq," Bush said in an address
broadcast nationwide Wednesday
night, hours after allied war
planes thundered into the sky to
seek out their targets. "It is the
liberation of Kuwait."
In the Iraqi capital, air raid
sirens wailed as wave after wave
of warplanes filled the starlit sky,
and red-and-green tracer fire
erupted. "This feels like we're in
the center of hell," said CNN's
Bernard Shaw in Baghdad.
Television carried sound
reports from Iraq via satellite, but
telephone service was cut. Ameri
can Telephone & Telegraph Co.
said it had lost communication
with Iraq.
At the United Nations, U.S.
Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering
promised that Iraq could avoid
further punishment by beginning
a complete, unconditioned with
drawal from Kuwait. The pledge
came in a private meeting with
the Security Council, according to
a text of his statement obtained
early today by The Associated
Press.
