# WAR IN THE GULF
## Massive U.S., allied air strike pounds Iraq 
### 
CENTRAL SAUDI ARABIA
(AP) — The United States and its
allies pounded Iraq with waves of
air strikes today in a furious bid to
drive Saddam Hussein's armies
from Kuwait. "We will not fail," a
somber President Bush told the
nation.
Saddam apparently survived a
night of fire that rained down on
his capital. As the misty, smoke
shrouded day dawned in Baghdad,
he spat defiance at the allied
armies in a radio message.
"The mother of all battles is
under way!" the Iraqi president
proclaimed.
The first strike came before
dawn and a second wave followed
within hours, a Western military
official and Saudi radio said.
There was no immediate word on
any allied casualties.
Iraq claimed it shot down 14
attacking warplanes; there was no
immediate response from Wash
ington or its allies.
U.S. military officials said the
targets were strategic sites, but an
Iraqi communique said densely
populated residential areas had
been hit.
U.S. television correspondents
in the city said there was little
sign of damage in some sections of
downtown Baghdad this morning.
There was light traffic, and even
the trash collectors made their
rounds, they said.
Amid reports the raids were
successful and drew little Iraqi
resistance, oil prices fell back to
$25 a barrel in London after spik
ing up to $33 a barrel shortly after
war broke out. The price of gold
plummeted in London, opening
down nearly $20 from Wednes
day's close, and Tokyo stock prices
surged nearly 4.5 percent.
Bush ordered the release of
crude oil from U.S. strategic

petroleum reserves to try to keep
prices stable.
The United States seized the
first opportunity for a nighttime
attack after time ran out on a
United Nations deadline for Iraq
to relinquish Kuwait or face war.
The deadline expired at midnight
Tuesday EST — Wednesday
morning in Baghdad.
Saddam, whose armies overran
Kuwait in a lighting strike five
and a half months ago, had defied
diplomatic appeals, economic
sanctions and threats of force,
declaring the oil-rich emirate to be
irrevocably part of Iraq.
"Our goal is not the conquest
of Iraq," Bush said in an address
broadcast nationwide Wednesday
night, hours after allied war
planes thundered into the sky to
seek out their targets. "It is the
liberation of Kuwait."
In the Iraqi capital, air raid
sirens wailed as wave after wave
of warplanes filled the starlit sky,
and red-and-green tracer fire
erupted. "This feels like we're in
the center of hell," said CNN's
Bernard Shaw in Baghdad.
Television carried sound
reports from Iraq via satellite, but
telephone service was cut. Ameri
can Telephone & Telegraph Co.
said it had lost communication
with Iraq.
At the United Nations, U.S.
Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering
promised that Iraq could avoid
further punishment by beginning
a complete, unconditioned with
drawal from Kuwait. The pledge
came in a private meeting with
the Security Council, according to
a text of his statement obtained
early today by The Associated
Press.

An estimated 750 protesters rallied at the Palo Alto City Hall and marched through the city's streets last night, Just hours after the Unit
ed States and its allies launched a military assault on Iraq.
word of war spread, people gath
ered in living rooms and taverns,
shopping malls and street corners,
expressing shock but not real sur
prise.
"I was expecting it. I knew it
was coming," said Sandra Hippen
of Sioux Falls, S.D. "But there's
no way to prepare for war ... for
the fear."
Anti-war protests, which had
grown in intensity in the days
leading up to the fighting, redou
bled in numbers and passion with
the outbreak of war. In Washing
ton, club-swinging police dis
persed hundreds of demonstra
tors near the White House.
Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney, briefing reporters in
Washington, would provide no

casualty reports from the initial
attack. But he said the operation
"appears to have gone vciy, very
well."
Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the
allied offensive met "no air resis
tance" from Iraq's air force.
Powell and Cheney declined to
discuss specifics of the operation
— even to confirm the types of air
craft involved. But Powell said
Iraqi command and control cen
ters were prime targets of the first
wave of aircraft.
Only the United States,
Britain, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait
participated in the initial attacks,
Cheney said, although 28 nations
are part of the multinational force
confronting Iraq. French military
forces did not take part in the ini
tial assault, but they were ordered

into battle later today, French
sources said.
In Brussels, envoys of the 16
NATO nations met in emergency
session today and said they hoped
hostilities could end "as soon as
possible." But they again warned
Iraq that an attack against
Turkey — the only member of the
Atlantic alliance that borders Iraq
— is an attack against the entire
16-nation alliance.
Turkey's prime minister
announced early today that the
government would ask Parlia
ment for war powers and permis
sion for U.S. use of bases in this
country, the semi-official Anatolia
news agency reported.
The Palestine Liberation Orga
nization called on Muslims and
Third World countries to rally to
Iraq's support. It denounced the

allied attack as "boldfaced and
treacherous aggression."
As the United States launched
its awesome array of air power
against Iraq, American lawmak
ers expressed hopes the conflict
would end rapidly. House Speaker
Thomas Foley said the nation
"must now pray for a conflict that
ends quickly, decisively, and with a
minimum loss of life."
In Israel — which Saddam had
vowed to make a target if war
broke out — an army officer, Brig.
Gen. Zeev Livne, said missiles in
western Iraq that could have
threatened Israel were hit in the
U.S.-led offensive.
Nevertheless, the Israeli army
today ordered most citizens to
stay at home and keep their gas
masks ready for a feared chemical
attack.

Jordan, sandwiched between
Iraq and Israel, closed its airspace
today. The Amman government
has voiced fears of being dragged
into the gulf conflict if Saddam
attacks Israel.
The allied air offensive, aimed
at troops and other strategic sites
in both Iraq and Kuwait, included
hundreds of U.S. Air Force planes,
British Tornado fighter-bombers,
Saudi Arabian F-15s and Torna
dos, and aircraft of Kuwait's
exiled military, military officials
said.
By unleashing an overnight
aerial bombardment, the allies
sought to take advantage of the
darkness of a new moon — and of
overwhelming U.S. air superiority.
Iraq's strength rested in day
fighting by ground forces. More
than 1 million troops have been

massed on opposite sides, 425,000
of them Americans, since Iraq
invaded Kuwait Aug. 2 in a dis
pute over oil, land and money.
The second-wave attack scored
direct hits on the Defense Min
istry building in Baghdad, accord
ing to Bob Simpson of the British
Broadcasting Corporation.
About two hours after the first
Iraqi anti-aircraft fire, Baghdad
Radio reported "wave after wave"
of warplanes moving over the city
of about 4 million people in the
pre-dawn darkness.
But apparently because of their
high altitude, they came silently,
and it was not until the bombs hit
and ordnance lighted the night
that Iraq knew it was under
attack.
Most of the damage apparently
was on the outskirts of the city.
