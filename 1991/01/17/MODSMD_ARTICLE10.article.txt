# From sadness to outrage, the world reacts to Gulf offensive
## 
### 
(AP) — The outbreak of war in the Persian Gulf
brought promises of support for the United States
from its allies, prayers for peace and angry calls for
anti-war demonstrations. Trading on world markets
was fast-paced but not panicky, with stock prices
soaring in Tokyo.
The feeling of sad resignation expressed by
United Nations Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar, who had engaged in 11th hour efforts to
avert war, reflected the feelings of many.
"After all my efforts, after all the efforts of so
many countries, so many different personalities,
how can I tell you, dear friends, that we are now fac
ing a war?" he said.
The NATO allies, after an emergency meeting,
said they hoped hostilities could end "as soon as pos
sible." They warned Iraq that an attack against
Turkey — the only NATO member that borders Iraq
— would be an attack against the entire 16-nation
alliance.
Opponents of the invasion began their protests.
In Islamabad, Pakistan, hundreds of baton-wielding
police in riot gear scattered Muslim militants march
ing toward the U.S. Embassy shortly after dawn.
Longtime U.S. foes such as North Korea and Cuba
reacted with outrage.
"At the outset there was a bet on war, not peace,"
Cuban President Fidel Castro said. "War won that
bet."
Pope John Paul II began to pray shortly after
being informed of the U.S.-led attack, the Italian
News Agency AGI reported.

Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, spiri
tual leader of the world's 70 million Anglicans, said
from Britain: "My first prayers are for our service
men and women in the Gulf and their families. They
deserve our support."
In Tokyo, the first stock market to open as
the attack was launched, share prices jumped 747.93
points to 23,190.63 by early afternoon as mfyor
investors bought heavily after months of waiting for
the Gulf war to begin.
Market participants reported no panic. They also
said initial reports of a successful attack buoyed sen
timents that a war could be brief.
Israel's military command ordered its citizens to
stay indoors and prepare their gas mask kits, but
there were no immediate signs of a threatened Iraqi
attack.
In Bahrain, Kuwaiti exiles rushed out of their
apartments in excitement at the news.
"Where is your voire o Saddam 0 " said Kuwait
radio, broadcast from a secret location, believed to be
Saudi Arabia. "Drink of the chalice you gave Kuwait.
You have ended, but Kuwait lives, Kuwait the state,
Kuwait the Emir, Kuwait the Government, Kuwait
the nation.
Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani, whose
country fought an eight-year war with Iraq but
opposes the U.S.-led force against Baghdad, said he
"deeply regrets" the outbreak of war.
China, which abstained from the vote, expressed
"deep anxiety and worry" over a war "people don't
like to see."
