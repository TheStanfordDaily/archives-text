U.S. braces for potential oil shock
NEW YORK (AP) — Oil prices soared from $32 to
about $40 per barrel as war with Iraq began last
night, but crude fell back, the government
announced the opening of a reserve and several oil
companies froze prices.
Late last night, the White House announced it
would open the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve,
which contains about 590 million barrels of crude oil
in salt caverns in Texas and Louisiana. The govern
ment plans to ofTer 1.12 million barrels of crude each
day for the next 30 days.
The infusion of government crude into the mar
ket should hold oil futures prices back, traders said,
but an earlier effort to calm energy markets through
a test of the SPR failed to stop rising prices during
the fall.
In early Tokyo trading, some oil prices were even
50 cents lower than they had been at the close of
trading Wednesday on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
Traders who had panicked and quickly bid up
prices in private cash deals were apparently calmed
as reports indicated the war could be short,

Blakeslee said.
Earlier, as television news reports were broadcast
ing the sounds of bombs and gunfire in the Iraqi cap
ital of Baghdad, crude oil prices took their biggest
jump of the past five months in private cash trading
in New Orleans and Houston.
Even as crude prices were trading higher, several
major U.S. oil companies announced they were freez
ing the wholesale price of gasoline in an attempt to
lessen the impact on consumers. The big companies
cannot, however, set pump prices at independent gas
stations.
Companies freezing prices included Chevron,
Mobil Corp., Conoco Inc. and Atlantic Richfield Co.
Thousands protest across nation
(AP) — With songs, silence, chants and prayer,
thousands of Americans gathered last night in small
towns and large cities as word spread that the nation
was at war with Iraq.
They marched side-by-side, flooded federal build
ings, parks and thoroughfares in peaceful protests
from Portland, Ore. to the nation's capital to the
banks of the Mississippi River.

In perhaps the most unruly demonstration,
protesters burned a highway patrol car, smashed
store windows and lighted fires in downtown San
Francisco trash cans. Rowdy anti-war activists wres
tled with police in Honolulu.
"Everybody was upset. We have some families
with two children over there," said Connie Landry of
Donaldsville, La., where 500 people gathered in a
vigil after the U.S.-led forces attacked Baghdad. "We
started off with a prayer."
Tamsie Ringler, a student at the University of
Texas in Austin, said she came out on a winter night
to wave a banner in protest, even if "Bush won't
hear the screams." A stuffed figure labeled "Rambo
Bush" was burned in effigy on the steps of the state
Capitol.
About 200 chanting students marched against
traffic on Commonwealth Avenue in Boston as part
of a peace demonstration that began at Harvard Uni
versity. Police cars accompanied the marchers, who
were cheered by some motorists passing by in rush
hour traffic.
In Washington, across Pennsylvania Avenue from
the White House, hundreds of protesters demon
strated in a park before marching through down

town. "Don't Bag Our Boys" one sign read.
Similar protests and candlelight vigils quickly
formed in Harrisburg, Pa.; Des Moines; St. Louis;
Providence, R. 1.; and New York City.
Lawmakers hope for brief conflict
WASHINGTON (AP) - As the United States
unleashed its air power against Iraq yesterday, law
makers said they hoped the conflict would end
quickly with few American casualties.
On Capitol Hill, House Speaker Thomas Foley
said the nation "must now pray for a conflict that
ends quickly, decisively, and with a minimum loss of
life. We must now stand united in support of our
armed forces in the gulf who have embraced the duty
and burden of conducting the war."
Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I. and chairman of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he was
praying "for all those in danger tonight, our coura
geous servicemen and women, and innocent civilians
in Kuwait and Iraq."
"We can only hope ... Saddam Hussein will be
wiped from the face of the Earth," Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato, R-N.Y., said.
