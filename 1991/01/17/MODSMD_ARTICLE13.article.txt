In the midst of war,
Stanford must shift out
of ordinary thinking

A TALE OF WAR IS being told
by warplanes and tanks at
the other end of the world,
and nobody knows what the ending
will be.
As an institution dedicated to
creating the next generation of
leaders, Stanford must watch
closely and prepare.
For a little more than a dozen
hours yesterday, the Stanford com
munity breathed a little easier; the
United Nations deadline for Iraq to
withdraw its forces from Kuwait
had passed without incident. The
possibility of a negotiated peace,
though remote, was still very real.
At 12:50 a.m. Baghdad time, or
1:50 p.m. PST, the United States
and its allies launched a
airstrike at targets inside Iraq.
American forces destroyed much of
Iraq's air force and its Revolution
ary Guard while suffering virtually
no casualties, according to early
reports.
"The liberation of Kuwait has
begun," President Bush would
later announce. Meanwhile, Stan
ford has become a captive audience
to the latest Gulf developments.
With the beginning of hostili
ties, emotions among students will
no doubt soar high.
As a recent Daily poll indicated,
the Stanford student body is
sharply divided, with a slim 51.7
percent majority opposing the use
of force.
Now that the U.S. military has
engaged Iraq, Stanford will be a
forum for protests, debate and,
inevitably, some confusion.
The following are just some of
the numerous questions that will

be close to the hearts and minds of
many Americans:
Why didn't the White House
allow more time for sanctions
against Iraq to take effect? Was the
United States morally justified in
its attack? How long will the fight
ing last and at what cost?
Will a draft be reinstated? Is
aerial supremacy enough to win
battles in this modern age of war
fare? Will the attack spur either an
attack on Israel or worldwide ter
rorism against American interests?
Will the United States ultimately
be victorious?
And perhaps most importantly,
what does the conflict in the Gulf
mean for the so-called "new world
order" or the prospects for a last
ing peace in the Middle East?
Fortunately, Stanford has many
of the necessary resources to at
least partly answer these queries,
from Hoover Institution experts to
an excellent library system.
The ASSU should work to edu
cate students about the central
issues by organizing dorm-based
discussions and arranging campus
wide debates.
As for campus-wide protests,
University President Donald
Kennedy rightfully reminded stu
dents of the campus disruption pol
icy. After all, civil disobedience
must always remain civil.
Just as students must realize
the problems with disrupting the
campus, so too must administra
tors and faculty take into account
the war's effect on students.
Beyond the intellectual debate
will be intense turmoil. Many stu
dents have loved ones in the Gulf,
while others may be called to serve.
For some, the very fact of war will
be unsettling.
The University must remain
compassionate and flexible as
events unfold, making whatever
accommodations necessary for stu
dents having difficulty dealing
with the enormity of the crisis.
