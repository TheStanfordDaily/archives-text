## Chilling draft prospects 
### 
ONLY IN THE HUSHED CORNERS
of the dining halls and of their
rooms will you hear the truth.
As college-age men watch the head
lines and newsbreaks flash bits of news
about the Persian Gulf conflict — about
our impending war — they loudly debate
whether or not the United States has a
"right" to be over there.
Some agree with the president's hard
line, saying Saddam Hussein is an aggres
sive madman who needs to be put in his
place. Others heatedly argue to give eco
nomic sanctions a chance to work — to
give peace a chance.
But behind all of the disagreement and
away from the eyes of others they quietly
agree on one thing: If war does break out
in the Middle East, they will be scared for
their lives.
They are the ones who will be sent if
the draft is reinstated. Whether or not
they agree with the president's policy,
they are the ones who may die.
So these men experience the news a lit
tle differently than I do as a woman. That
became clear over the weekend when I
read Sunday's headline announcing that
both the House and Senate had approved
the use of force at the president's discre
tion.
As I talked to a male friend of mine
about the vote, he became suddenly irate.
"What do you care about all of this? I'm
the one they're going to want. They're
not going to send you over there to be
killed."
He's right. They won't send me, and I
won't lose my life in some forsaken desert
in the Middle East. But I do care.

I don't want our country to lose
another generation of young men. I don't
want to lose my friends and I do not want
to lose my 19-year-old brother.
Of course, there is no draft right now,
so we all may be needlessly worrying. But
the situation does make me look at my life
and the lives of my male friends and
brother differently as well.
It seems that we all think of ourselves
as individuals —individuals who may be
part of a family or a school or a commu
nity organization. We feel that we have a
certain amount of power over our own
lives and power to choose who we want to
be.
But now college-age young men must
face the fact that they are not just part of
a family or a school or a church, but also
part of a nation. And because they are
part of this nation, they can be sent to a
foreign land to kill and to be kill*
They never chose to be American and
they don't have a choice about whether or
not our country will wage war. And yet
they may have to risk their lives.
It is an unnerving thought that the
government has more power over a young
man's destiny than he has or his family
has or his God has.
So right now rumors spread quickly in
this community of men. "I hear the 21-
year-olds will be the first to go," one
friend says. "You know, they're going to
take guys from 20 through 25 if they rein
state the draft. At least that's what I've
heard," says another. \
It seems that they are all trying to
grapple with the fact that their lives may
soon not be their own. The dreams to

become successful lawyers, bankers,
politicians, engineers, actors and writers
— all those dreams can be torn away from
them by presidential decree.
Apparently, life doesn't progress natu
rally from high school to college to career.
Not in this war-hungry wond. Not in this
world where a young man's life dream
can easily be replaced by wartime night
mares.
Does this scare you? It should.
War is not a Hollywood construction
for movies like "Platoon," "Full Metal
Jacket" and the like. It is real and it is
imminent and a million times more horri
fying. What will you do to stop it? What
will you do to help?
March and demonstrate and pray.
Pray that our friends and relatives
who are already over there will be okay.
Hope that the draft is not reinstated
because of the Persian Gulf conflict.
And if we finally hear the news we
never wanted to hear — that troops are
coming home in bags — pray that we can
be too numb to feel the pain of our loss.
