Isolationalist Gulf editorial ignored vital issues

MOST PEOPLE ARE absolutely
overwhelmed by the plethora of
bad arguments both for and
against military action in the Middle
East. The Daily does not seem immune
to this plague.
In an editorial attempt to criticize the
•quality of President Bush's letter to col
lege students on the issue, The Daily's
argument was irrational and disappoint
ing at best.
Anyone reading Monday's editorial
might have accurately labeled The
Daily's view as isolationist and irrespon
sible. Specifically, the implication that
the geographical distance of Kuwait from
the United States makes the atrocities
occurring there less important is unac
ceptable as a rational argument against
action. The Daily seems to suggest that
unjustified and blatant aggression
becomes more ui\just the closer it occurs
to the United States.
Clearly, in a world that is environmen
tally, economically, socially and politically
interdependent, militaristic adventurism
in one corner of the world has a somber
implication for the rest of the planet.
We must all ask ourselves whether we
can allow Iraq to set a positive example
for regional aggressors. A tacit accep
tance of the status quo in Kuwait would

give a green light to adventuresome
despots everywhere. As a result, world
order and peace would surely prove
increasingly elusive.
In addition, we must consider the
future of the United Nations if the allied
forces do not respond to Iraqi aggression.
We must recall that many of the world's
citizens see the United Nations as the
last best hope for world peace. Small
nations see the body as a forum in which
it can seek justice and restitution.
Subsequently, large powers, such as
the United States, must use their power
to uphold these values and maintain
faith in the United Nations and peace.
We cannot run away from our commit
ment to world order, not on a national
level nor on an individual level.
Considering that mqjor diplomatic
efforts to find a peaceful resolution to
the crisis have been continually initiated
by the United States and the United
Nations, it is very difficult to accept The
Daily's claim that President Bush has
not earnestly tried to pursue diplomatic
channels. If there is anyone to blame for
the failure of talks, it is Saddam Hus
sein, not George Bush.
More specifically, the Bush adminis
tration, along with the good offices of the
U.N. Secretary-General, have made

remarkable efforts to find a peaceful res
olution to this crisis.
As President Bush and others have
made clear, the administration offered in
December to send Secretary of State
Baker to Baghdad in order to open com
munication between the United States
and Iraq. Saddam Hussein refused to
receive him until Jan. 12; apparently he
just could not fit the secretary of state
into his busy schedule.
More recently, Baker and Iraqi foreign
minister Tariq Aziz met in Geneva.
Again proving their unwillingness to
negotiate, the Iraqis arrived without a
reasonable proposal and apparently
without any plans to find a peaceful solu
tion to the crisis.
It seems that Saddam Hussein had
made up his mind before Geneva.
Finally, after U.N. Secretary-General
Perez de Cuellar's failed attempt to
negotiate with the Iraqis, it is now per
fectly clear that Saddam Hussein does
not want to negotiate seriously, nor does
he ever plan to withdraw from what he
euphemistically calls "Iraq's 19th
province."
Perhaps most upsetting about The
Daily's editorial was its conclusions on
morality in world affairs. If we begin to
believe that world affairs and American

foreign policy should never be analyzed
in the contest of a moral hierarchy, the
future of our planet looks very bleak.
Instead of accepting this cynicism, we
should listen to what President Bush has
said and not reject it just because it
might be out of style or politically incor
rect. Let us not build our future world
on a moral vacuum; instead, we should
take this opportunity to reestablish a
moral hierarchy of values in world
affairs.
The number of reasons why this is a
situation of right vs. wrong are numer
ous, and the president was absolutely
correct in his view that we have a moral
imperative to do what is right: free
Kuwait.
What is at stake is more than just a
small desert nation. It is more than oil.
It is more than the long-term security of
our friends in the region. What we are
risking is long-term peace based on jus
tice.
Moreover, if we fail the United
Nations at this critical juncture, we will
be sacrificing a historical opportunity to
make it a credible instrument for creat
ing a world where the weak do not have
to accept what they must accept.

imperative to do what is right: free
Kuwait.
What is at stake is more than just a
small desert nation. It is more than oil.
It is more than the long-term security of
our friends in the region. What we are
risking is long-term peace based on jus
tice.
Moreover, if we fail the United
Nations at this critical juncture, we will
be sacrificing a historical opportunity to
make it a credible instrument for creat
ing a world where the weak do not have
to accept what they must accept.
