# Don't clutter minds with talk of issues unrelated to Stanford
## 
### 
Your Jan. 10 editorial "Empty Chat
ter," stating that the ASSU Senate
should not consider bills of national and
international significance, really made
me think.
You are completely right; students
have no business thinking about issues

outside of the ivory tower. As students of
the '90s, we need only think about the
happy hour tonight or our corporate jobs
of tomorrow.
However, The Daily needs to be con
sistent. I noticed that in the Jan. 11
paper, your editorial board felt that it
was appropriate for The Daily, unlike the
ASSU, to think about world issues. You
wrote a whole policy editorial on the
Middle East, "Go that extra mile."
Absent was any editorial about impor
tant issues such as last night's senior
happy hour at Cheers.

I implore you to not clutter our
minds, and the pages of The Daily, with
complicated debates about non-univer
sity-related issues. Stop considering
world issues on your editorial pages.
In fact, the whole World & Nation
section should be permanently removed
and replaced with "Gossip from the Cof
fee House." Until Iraq bombs Stanford,
we shouldn't have any part of this whole
stinky issue. 'NufT said?
