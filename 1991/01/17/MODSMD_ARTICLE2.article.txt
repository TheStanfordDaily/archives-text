# 'You could see faces drop'
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
Last night, as scheduled, freshmen ate
dinner with their advisers in their dorms.
But there was little talk about winter quar
ter courses. Instead, discussion centered on
students' concerns and anxieties about the
afternoon's sudden air strike in the Persian
Gulf.
In Madera, students ate quickly and kept
an eye on the clock, making sure they were
back in the dorm lounge to watch President
Bush's address to the nation. Those who
hadn't finished eating brought their trays
with them.
The room fell silent as Bush began to
speak. "You could see faces drop, emotions
change and tensions build in a second," said
freshman Lisa Soto.
The scene was the same in almost every
dormitory on campus last night, as students
huddled around TVs, trying to sort out their
feelings about the hostilities in the Gulf. Ini
tial disbelief upon learning of the United
States' bombings was quickly displaced by
feelings of confusion, fear, alienation — and
the hope that whatever the outcome, war
would be over soon.
"I'm torn," said freshman A 1 Burnce,
"between my beliefs that the U.S. does not
need to be involved in that region of the

world and that Saddam Hussein cannot be
left alone."
Such ambivalence was common. Many
students vocalized their disgust with U.S.
policy, attending anti-war rallies in Palo Alto
and San Francisco. Others staunchly
defended Bush's actions, arguing that Sad
dam's naked aggression had to be checked.
But yesterday's outbreak of hostilities
seemed to leave most students feeling uncer
tain and numb.
"It's hard to develop any particular emo
tion," said Tim Beerling, a graduate student
in electrical engineering. "It's just so over
whelming."
Junior Heidi Hoffman and her roommate
spent the afternoon and evening glued to the
television. "We're totally flustered," Hoff
man said. "We were laughing nervously and
totally shaking.... We're just praying for
the best."
The mood was solemn at a hastily
arranged vigil last night in White Plaza as
400 community members prayed for the end

of hostilities.
Student leaders and University President
Donald Kennedy met yesterday afternoon
and emerged with two common goals: to cre
ate support networks for students in this
time of crisis and to do all they can to keep
polarized views on the use of force from frac
turing the Stanford community.
"I think it's basically a time to come
together," said Council of Presidents mem
ber Goodwin Liu. "Now more than ever, this
is when we need to be a community."
That task is likely to prove difficult. The
chasm between student views is wide.
Like many others, Saman Amarsinghe, a
graduate student from Sri Lanka, has raised
questions about American motives for enter
ing the Gulf war. "This war is not about lib
erating Kuwait from Iraq," he said. "It is
about asserting a new world order, one in
which the United States has the power to
annihilate anyone acting against its. inter
ests."
But Tony Shih, a freshman in Paloma,
forcefully defended the United States' inter
vention. "Iraq plundered Kuwait," he said,
"essentially raping Kuwaiti citizens and
murdering babies. We had an obligation to go
in and we did go in."
The hostilities that erupted
yesterday shattered the idealism
of many Stanford students who
thought they would never witness
such large-scale military involve
ment of the United States.
"I'm incredulous," said fresh
man Cita Torres. "I can't believe
that in my lifetime we declared
war and brutally attacked
another country."
Junior Michael Burton struck
a similar chord. "It may be
naive," he said, "but I never
thought we'd see a war."
For many students last night,
the reality of yesterday's events
had yet to sink in. "It's difficult
for me to deal with it because it is
so far away," said senior Joey
Feldman ; a resident assistant in
Madera. "It's unreal."
Firouzeh Lari, a freshman in
Feldman's dorm, lived in Iran
until her family moved to the
United States in 1983. She was
was 10 years old at the time. "I
don't know that the U.S. knows

what it is getting into," she said
yesterday. "For people here, it is
like watching a baseball game. . ..
It is so distant."
Taz Rahi, a junior whose
father is an Arab and works in
Saudi Arabia, has found that
what's taught in the classroom
about international relations
doesn't always ring true. "In
[Political Science] 35, you hold up
a theory (to explain wars)," she
said, "but everything Bush has
been saying is not like the theo
ries we've been taught. It seems
irrational. We as college students
seem to know more about why we
should go to war than politicians
in Washington."

'This war is not about liberating Kuwait
from Iraq, it is about asserting a new
world order, one in which the United
States has the power to annihilate any
one acting against its interests.'

Many students fear they will
be preoccupied with the events in
the Gulf during the coming
weeks, detracting from their
studies. "I think I'll be going
through the motions of school,
but my heart is not in the work,"
said freshman Lisa Goldman.
"Every book and paper seem so
trivial."

of hostilities.
Student leaders and University President
Donald Kennedy met yesterday afternoon
and emerged with two common goals: to cre
ate support networks for students in this
time of crisis and to do all they can to keep
polarized views on the use of force from frac
turing the Stanford community.
"I think it's basically a time to come
together," said Council of Presidents mem
ber Goodwin Liu. "Now more than ever, this
is when we need to be a community."
That task is likely to prove difficult. The
chasm between student views is wide.
Like many others, Saman Amarsinghe, a
graduate student from Sri Lanka, has raised
questions about American motives for enter
ing the Gulf war. "This war is not about lib
erating Kuwait from Iraq," he said. "It is
about asserting a new world order, one in
which the United States has the power to
annihilate anyone acting against its. inter
ests."
But Tony Shih, a freshman in Paloma,
forcefully defended the United States' inter
vention. "Iraq plundered Kuwait," he said,
"essentially raping Kuwaiti citizens and
murdering babies. We had an obligation to go
in and we did go in."
The hostilities that erupted
yesterday shattered the idealism
of many Stanford students who
thought they would never witness
such large-scale military involve
ment of the United States.
"I'm incredulous," said fresh
man Cita Torres. "I can't believe
that in my lifetime we declared
war and brutally attacked
another country."
Junior Michael Burton struck
a similar chord. "It may be
naive," he said, "but I never
thought we'd see a war."
For many students last night,
the reality of yesterday's events
had yet to sink in. "It's difficult
for me to deal with it because it is
so far away," said senior Joey
Feldman ; a resident assistant in
Madera. "It's unreal."
Firouzeh Lari, a freshman in
Feldman's dorm, lived in Iran
until her family moved to the
United States in 1983. She was
was 10 years old at the time. "I
don't know that the U.S. knows

what it is getting into," she said
yesterday. "For people here, it is
like watching a baseball game. . ..
It is so distant."
Taz Rahi, a junior whose
father is an Arab and works in
Saudi Arabia, has found that
what's taught in the classroom
about international relations
doesn't always ring true. "In
[Political Science] 35, you hold up
a theory (to explain wars)," she
said, "but everything Bush has
been saying is not like the theo
ries we've been taught. It seems
irrational. We as college students
seem to know more about why we
should go to war than politicians
in Washington."

'This war is not about liberating Kuwait
from Iraq, it is about asserting a new
world order, one in which the United
States has the power to annihilate any
one acting against its interests.'

Many students fear they will
be preoccupied with the events in
the Gulf during the coming
weeks, detracting from their
studies. "I think I'll be going
through the motions of school,
but my heart is not in the work,"
said freshman Lisa Goldman.
"Every book and paper seem so
trivial."

Last night, as scheduled, freshmen ate
dinner with their advisers in their dorms.
But there was little talk about winter quar
ter courses. Instead, discussion centered on
students' concerns and anxieties about the
afternoon's sudden air strike in the Persian
Gulf.
In Madera, students ate quickly and kept
an eye on the clock, making sure they were
back in the dorm lounge to watch President
Bush's address to the nation. Those who
hadn't finished eating brought their trays
with them.
The room fell silent as Bush began to
speak. "You could see faces drop, emotions
change and tensions build in a second," said
freshman Lisa Soto.
The scene was the same in almost every
dormitory on campus last night, as students
huddled around TVs, trying to sort out their
feelings about the hostilities in the Gulf. Ini
tial disbelief upon learning of the United
States' bombings was quickly displaced by
feelings of confusion, fear, alienation — and
the hope that whatever the outcome, war
would be over soon.
"I'm torn," said freshman A 1 Burnce,
"between my beliefs that the U.S. does not
need to be involved in that region of the

world and that Saddam Hussein cannot be
left alone."
Such ambivalence was common. Many
students vocalized their disgust with U.S.
policy, attending anti-war rallies in Palo Alto
and San Francisco. Others staunchly
defended Bush's actions, arguing that Sad
dam's naked aggression had to be checked.
But yesterday's outbreak of hostilities
seemed to leave most students feeling uncer
tain and numb.
"It's hard to develop any particular emo
tion," said Tim Beerling, a graduate student
in electrical engineering. "It's just so over
whelming."
Junior Heidi Hoffman and her roommate
spent the afternoon and evening glued to the
television. "We're totally flustered," Hoff
man said. "We were laughing nervously and
totally shaking.... We're just praying for
the best."
The mood was solemn at a hastily
arranged vigil last night in White Plaza as
400 community members prayed for the end

of hostilities.
