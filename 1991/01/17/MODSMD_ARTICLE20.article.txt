Daily coverage of the ASSU selective, inaccurate and biased

THE DAILY TAKES PLEASURE in
attacking the ASSU as ineffective
or inactive. In our view, The
Daily's coverage itself may be a large
part of the problem, or the problem
itself. As graduate senators, we believe
The Daily's coverage is often incomplete
at best and slanted at worst.
The Jan. 10 senate meeting provides
an example. First, The Daily inaccu
rately reported the status of the motion
to restrict senate bills to "University
related issues," stating that the senate
was not even going to consider the issue
when, in fact, it might have. Any student
interested in the debate was misled.
Second, we feel that The Daily's cov
erage of the most important parts of the
actual meeting was selectively sparse.
Let us present these claims in more
detail.
What is responsible journalism? The
Daily titled a front page article, "Senate
puts off bill vote." Even we, as first-year

senators with allergic reactions to parlia
mentary rulebooks, know that one sena
tor, or even the chair, cannot unilaterally
decide to table motions without a vote of
the full senate.
Without understanding the correct
procedure for putting off a vote, The
Daily left students with the impression
that the bill would not be voted on.
Had the facts been as The Daily
reported them, the decision to delay the
vote would have required a majority vote
of all senators.
As it was, a great deal of confusion
reigned, due to the inability of the
Administration and Rules Committee to
agree on what it had decided on. The
chair, unlike many members of the com
mittee, believed that although the com
mittee had voted on whether to recom
mend the bill (which was a 3-3 tie), the
committee had forgotten to send the bill
to the full senate.
This mere technicality could have

been easily rectified. If The Daily had
not tied our hands, the senate could have
"moved into the committee as a whole"
to bring the bill up for a vote. Given that
The Daily took a formal stand on the
issue itself, we are left wondering to
what extent The Daily's own feelings
influenced its reporting.
Furthermore, the coverage of the
meeting itself was lacking. In its Jan. 11
issue, The Daily reported that USSA and
the chair of the Pro-Choice Alliance
spoke to the senate and that Sen.
Overdeck's bill would be debated at the
next senate meeting on Jan. 24.
In fact, the bill was hotly debated dur
ing open forum. Students raised several
interesting points about the relevance to
Stanford students of bills that would not
fit Overdeck's conception of "University
related."
One graduate student teaching assis
tant spoke movingly of undergraduates
raising to him concerns that their wor-

ries about war and a possible draft could
affect their academic performance. (Note
that the Selective Service has indicated if
there is a draft this time there will not
be student deferments.)
Another speaker spoke to the short
sightedness of the bill, noting that the
senate offers a civil environment in
which both sides of any politically hot
issue may come together. At the very
least, the senate could provide a forum
to spark these debates, which are proba
bly more interesting and educational for
the Stanford community than the
drudgery of ASSU daily business.
Finally, he remarked that when the
senate felt ready to expand its vision, it
could simply overturn this bill. Some
senators, including the author of the bill,
challenged the speaker; not only were
their questions more than adequately
answered, but for the first time, the sen
ate was silenced after open forum.
Perhaps The Daily neglected to report

on these points because they refuted The
Daily's position.
In the past, the ASSU has been criti
cized for voting on useless bills when its
obligations should have rested in educat
ing the campus about the issues. One of
the benefits of controversial bills is to
provoke debate and to educate students
in the process.
Now that the ASSU has created a
forum for debate, The Daily inaccurately
reports that the "Senate puts off bill
vote" and, in turn, decides not to report
on the debate that occurred.
It is becoming more apparent that by
selective reporting, and perhaps partisan
journalism, The Daily is the limiting fac
tor, and not the ASSU senate, to educat
ing students.
