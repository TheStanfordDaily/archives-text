# Perhaps U.S. should stand behind Bush and against Hussein
## 
### 
It's finally January 15.1 perfunctorily
take to the morning routine. What T
shirt should I wear? Dare I wear my
Stanford College Republican garb?
I'm writing this letter in response to
the garbage that has been pervading The
Daily. It's a tough call: Should we go to
war now or obviate the need for body

bags by retreating and allowing Iraq to
accrue a nuclear weaponry arsenal,
enabling them instantaneously to vapor
ize a hundred thousand Americans with
plutonium?
"The decision between life and death"
does come "down to the judgment of one
man." But don't think this man is
George Bush. It is indeed Saddam Hus
sein. Perhaps all the recent pleas to
Washington should be redirected to
Baghdad. Hussein is the aggressor; Bush
is not.
I want peace as much as anyone else. I
also realize the hard truth that we must

go to war if peace is to be achieved. The
only way a war can be avoided in the
Middle East would be for Saddam Hus
sein unconditionally to forfeit his unjust
acquisition, the likelihood of which
appears to be null.
It's a shame that it is the United
States that has to end Iraq's military
resurrection this time. A decade ago,
Israel did the dirty deed.
But we do have an alternative. Let's
wait until every narcissistic, brother
murdering dictator in the world wields
the nuclear sword. Then we can finally
resolve the issue in one massive, global

conflagration. This way we could avoid
any petty skirmishes and we could
appease all.
Who can possibly think that George
Bush is taking these measures to shake a
"wimpish" attitude toward him? George
Bush asserted his "manhood" and wore
his "combat boots" while he was still a
teenager. His "ass" has already been on
the line. History will verify his virility in
World War 11. Now who are the wimps?
I've given much thought to the possi
bility of a draft. Despite my inward,
moral opposition to any conscription, I
have resolved to go if I am called upon.

It's not a question of oil. It's a ques
tion of realizing the opportunities this
incredible country has given me and feel
ing a need to reciprocate.
Has it occurred to anyone that maybe
we should follow George Bush? Call me
unselfish, but I would rather sacrifice
my time and possibly my life than jeop
ardize the future of the United States. I
just wish more people could see it this
way and support their country.
By the way, I did decide to wear my
Stanford Republicans T-shirt.
