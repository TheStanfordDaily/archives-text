# Stanford scholars forsee a long war

### Mike Laris Staff writer 
Members of Stanford's academic commu
nity reacted to the allied air assault on Iraq
yesterday with anxiety, skepticism of early
government and press reports, and warnings
against overly optimistic appraisals of the
war's future.
History Prof. Barton Bernstein said he
would probably lecture on the war today in his
modern history course "Twentieth Century
America." And Prof. David Kennedy, chair of
the Histoiy Department, said it was likely the
department would "organize some sort of a
teach-in or public forum on the issues at stake
here."
Response to news of the air attack was var
ied.
"I am unalterably opposed to President
Bush initiating war with methods that seem
inappropriate and for reasons that seem
morally uryust," Bernstein said last night.
He said the war in the Persian Gulf is in the
same mold as U.S. conflicts in Vietnam, Korea,
Grenada and Panama. He said the war is "con
ceived for oil, for a particular ideological con
ception of law and order, and in arrogance."
Kennedy, however, said the current situa
tion bears a "greater resemblance to 1917 and
1941," referring to the years the United States
entered World Wars I and 11.
He said last Saturday's divided vote in
Congress authorizing force reflected that
"there has been at least a semblance of a
meaningful debate. We seem to have come to a
majority opinion on this thing."
Although he said he found it plausible that
the "U.N. allies mav get it over with in a
hurry," history is replete with examples of mis
led optimism. He added that many combatants
in the American Civil War and World War I
thought the conflicts would be over swiftly
"They were quickly disillusioned," he said.
Even if U.S. and allied militaiy victory did

occur quickly, Kennedy said "the long-run
political consequences in the Arab region are
not pretty to contemplate." He suggested that
Arab enmity was inevitable and that there
would be a dangerous political vacuum caused
by a weakened Iraq.
Hoover Institution senior fellow Bruce
Bueno de Mesquita asserted, "War has not
begun until Iraq retaliates. It takes two to
make a war."
Bueno de Mesquita said that Iraqi Presi
dent Saddam Hussein would only fight back if
he knew he could win, predicting that Saddam
will take the initial blow and not make the
"mistake" of retaliating. He described Sad
dam's refusal to pull out of Kuwait as a ratio
nal gamble that the U.S. and allied forces
would not attack. Now that the uncertainty is
gone, he said he thinks the Iraqi president will
capitulate almost immediately.
If his interpretation is wrong, Bueno de
Mesquita said, a ground war should still be
undertaken. "Sometimes justice is served by
peace. Sometime justice is not served by
peace," he said.
But pulling out now "would be the best
thing for Saddam Hussein to do. He keeps his
ground army intact, which is the basis for his
political power," he said.
However, Political Science Prof. Scott
Sagan said, "A reasonable and fully informed
Saddam Hussein probably should have capitu
lated before the air strike. We shouldn't
assume he is rational or informed."
Sagan suggested that Hussein may have
been the victim of "wildly optimistic" interpre
tations of U.S. intentions by advisers who were
terrified to tell him the truth.
Although Iraq was apparently unsuccessful
at launching its SCUD missiles and getting
much of its air force off the ground, "we
should not think the war will be over quickly."
Although "we clearly have done much bet

ter in round one, the air war, than anyone
anticipated," Sagan said, "round two," the.
ground assault, would mark the greatest U.S.;
and allied sacrifices.
"The key question, if Saddam is still alive, is
whether he will decide if enough is enough," ;
he said.
Hoover Visiting Scholar Williamson Evers
predicted that a ground war is imminent.
"Despite the reported air success, I think this
will become a land war. The logic of the land
war will lead to a U.S. occupation of Iraq with
all the ensuing complications."
Evers called for a reversal of U.S. policy. "I
don't favor a foreign policy of global interven
tion by the U.S."
Donald Abenheim, a former Pentagon offi
cial who is now a visiting fellow at the Hoover
Institution, said liberating Kuwait is "no small
task," pointing to Gen. Colin Powell's state
ment that "this campaign is only the begin
ning." But Abenheim said it was his "gut feel
ing that we can win."
Many of the scholars agreed that early
reports of the war should be viewed cautiously.
"Leaders of great powers can, in the early
stages of conflict, often dominate popular
understanding. It is hard to believe the war
has been conducted with as few casualties as
has been suggested," Bernstein said.
Evers cautioned that, "In war, one should
suspect the earliest reports."
And Kennedy said students should be
aware that "there is the fog of war and such a
thing as propaganda."
But he added that there are sometimes rea
sons to fight, although he still has not made a
judgment about this case. "Look at the situa
tion in all its complexity and don't assume
reflexive positions," he advised.
