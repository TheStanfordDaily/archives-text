## 
### Michelle Campos Staff writer 
Anti-war demonstrations that swept college
campuses nationwide this week hit a frenzied
peak last night as news of the allied bombing
of Iraq and Kuwait reached the United States.
Students at UC-Santa Barbara assembled
yesterday evening before President Bush's
televised address to the nation. More than 300
students held a vigil through the night in the
Plaza, the center of campus.
The Students Against War coalition, which
has organized the anti-war rallies, will make
an announcement at noon today whether
there will be a boycott of classes. According to
Jeff Solomon of the Daily Nexus, UC-Santa
Barbara's student newspaper, University
Chancellor Barbara Uehling said the
University did not condone the boycotting of
classes and would not cancel them.
Earlier this week, 198 anti-war activists
were arrested in what the Daily Nexus called
"the largest demonstration at UC-Santa Bar
bara since the Vietnam era."
The protesters, consisting of students from
several University of California campuses,
military veterans and UC-Santa Barbara staff,
were arrested Tuesday night after occupying
an administration building on campus. The
sit-in was the culmination of day-long demon
strations opposing U.S. policy in the Persian
Gulf.

The Daily Nexus reported that more than
500 protesters stormea Cheadle Hall at 2:30
p.m. Tuesday, and 500 more demonstrators
staged a sit-in outside. Police began arresting
the activists for trespassing at 6:15 p.m., but
did not finish until after midnight.
UC-Santa Cruz students have declared a
two-day voluntary boycott of classes beginning
today. Students were urged to participate in
the boycott by the campus group Students for
Social Responsibility, which is endorsed by the
Coalition Against War, an organization of
more than 20 student groups from different
campuses.
The UC-Santa Cruz anti-war group polled
more than 4,000 students at UC-Santa Cruz
last quarter, determining that 78 percent of
the respondents were in favor of a voluntary
boycott of classes in response to the Persian
Gulf crisis, according to the University's stu
dent newspaper, City on a Hill.
University Chancellor Robert Stevens
released a letter Tuesday which neither con
demned nor condoned the boycott, according
to the newspaper. The letter also asked faculty
members to be lenient toward students who
opted not to attend class.
Last night an estimated 8,000 to 10,000
students and Santa Cruz residents marched
through the city to Highway 17, where they
blockaded an exit ramp. Several anti-war
speakers addressed the protesters. A similar
march through town was held Sunday, in

which 4,000 to 5,000 students participated.
Immediately after news of the air attack on
Iraq was announced, 200 Harvard University
students and other anti-war demonstrators
broke out into a spontaneous march in Har
vard Square. Although it was pouring rain last
night in Cambridge, the activists marched into
Boston.
This morning, protesters at the Boston Fed
eral Building were scheduled to march down
Massachusetts Avenue into Cambridge, where
students are expected to join the demonstra
tion.
Harvard students held two vigils in Har
vard Square Tuesday, while 300 Cambridge
high school students staged a demonstration
march that same day.
Although winter semester has not yet
started at UC-Berkeley, students and otner
protesters gathered yesterday evening at the
Berkeley Bay Area Rapid Transit station to
oppose the latest developments in the Middle
East, according to The Daily Californian, the
UC-Berkeley student newspaper.
Approximately 1,200 Berkeley high school
and junior high school students gathered
Tuesday in a peaceful march to Martin Luther
King, Jr. Park. According to the UC-Berkeley
Public Information Office, the students sat in
the street singing from noon until 1 p.m.
Although the students blocked traffic on a
busy street next to the campus, the protesters
were neither injured nor arrested.
