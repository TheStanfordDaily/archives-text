# ROTC students maintain resolve

### Ashok Rai Staff writer 
Many Stanford students in ROTC and the
reserves reacted with shock and concern to the U.S.-
led aerial attack on Baghdad yesterday but remained
firm in their commitment and obligation to the U.S.
military.
U I was surprised that it had happened so soon
after the actual deadline," said Bunmi Folayan, a
junior in civil engineering and member of the Marine
Core Reserves.
Folayan left last night on a previously scheduled
trip to San Diego, where for the next three months
he will complete his training before joining his bat
talion, which is currently stationed in Okinawa,
Japan.
But Folayan said he is unsure about whether he
would be called upon to serve in the Saudi desert. He
said he thinks his unit might be rotated in from
Japan to the Gulf.
Stanford students in ROTC echoed Folayan's
shock at the suddenness of the U.S. attack. "My
brain kind of cramped up," said John Manning, a
senior in history, "and I felt sad that a peaceful solu
tion had not been found."
"I had expected that it would happen," said Lance
McDaniel, a junior in political science and member of
Navy ROTC, "and the quicker it gets over the better
for everybody."
Speaking of the U.S. pilots engaged in the aerial
attack, Manning said, "My heart goes out to them ..
. and I can imagine how frightening and difficult it
must be."
Students in ROTC and the reserves expressed a
willingness to fight if called upon. "I have never

wanted to go to war," said Folayan, "but when I
made a decision to join the Marine reserves I knew .
.. that I might be in combat."
McDaniel also said he would "definitely be more
than willing to go to war" if ever called upon, and
added that ne knew this was "part of the package
when he signed up for ROTC.
However, all the students in ROTC interviewed by
The Daily said they thought that their chances of
ending up in the Arabian desert were small unless
the war carries on for a very long time.
Jim Richards, a senior in symbolic systems and a
member of Navy ROTC, said he felt that President
Bush's address to the nation last night was "a little
simplistic."
McDaniel agreed that the speech seemed patron
izing but added that "a little bit of propaganda is not
unexpected at the beginning of a war."
The students said they supported the peace rallies
taking place on campus and in San Francisco, but
some had reservations about the effects they might
have.
"People have the right to go out to rally for
peace," said McDaniel, "and one of the reasons for
being in the military is to defend these rights." How
ever, he contended that in campus peace rallies
"facts are often obscured by emotions."
"What we in the military are doing is a job for the
[United States]," said Folayan. "I am a peace-loving
person. I don't have a problem with [the peace move
ment] as long as it isn't anti-military and as long as
it doesn't send the wrong signals to the people who
are actually doing the fighting."
"Now that we are committed," he added, "I feel it
is the duty of every U.S. citizen to be 100 percent
behind the military."
