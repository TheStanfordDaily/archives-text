# King's dream applied to current Gulf crisis
## 
### Denise M. Morris Staff writer 
Set against the backdrop of
the Persian Gulf War, a speech
last night commemorating the
birthday of Dr. Martin Luther
King, Jr. reflected on the past
and future of black Americans.
Rev. Floyd Thompkins, asso
ciate dean of Memorial Church,
and Silas Muhammad, leader
of the Lost-Found Nation of
Islam, spoke in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium to a crowd of over
400 people.
In his speech, Thompkins
applied King's ideals to the pre
sent. Describing events like the
end of the Cold War and elec
tions in El Salvador, and new
movements like environmental
awareness, Thompkins mused
that the world had come so
close to non-violent change.
"We expected 'a kinder, gen
tler nation' ... [but] we are
again at the brink of annihila

tion," said Thompkins.
Thompkina urged the mem
bers of the audience not to
resign themselves to the
inevitability of war.
While Thompkins directly
addressed current events,
Muhammad talked about the
salvation of black people as a
nation. He began by addressing
the "so-called African-Ameri
can" in the auditorium.
Muhammad spoke out against
the definition of a people by
another people and urged the
black community to develop its
own identity.
"Can you go to the United
Nations to ask for justice in the
name African-American?"
asked Muhammed. "What
country do you know of that
bears the name African-Ameri
can?"
"We stand without our orig
inal names, culture or lan
guage," one of Muhammad's
aides declared.
