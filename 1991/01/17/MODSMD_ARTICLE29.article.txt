## Cardinal stuns No. 7 UCLA in Pauley Pavilion 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES — You might
as well take all those preseason
Pacific 10 Conference basketball
predictions, the Assciated Press
poll and 25 years of UCLA tradi
tion, wrap them up and toss them
in the garbage, because absolutely
nothing is coming off as planned
this season in the Pac-10.

Men's Basketball

Cardinal 89
Bruins 82

The Stanford men's basketball
team made yet another contribu
tion to that chaos at Pauley Pavil
ion last night, handing the No. 7
UCLA Bruins their first home loss
of the season in an 89-82 thriller.
The win, which raises Stan
ford's season record to 10-5 (3-2 in
the Pac-10), certainly wasn't
important at all in light of the
serious developments in the Mid
dle East, but it still had its
significant points for the Cardi
nal.
"Any time you come down here
and win it's a great, great win,"
said Stanford center Adam Keefe,
whose season-high 30 points and
nine rebounds Ted both teams.
Tracy Murray led the Bruins with
24 points (6-for-9 behind the
three-point line) and seven
rebounds.
Stanford may have to get used
to coming down to Pauley and
winning: After 24 long years of
frustration, the Cardinal has a

modest (and unprecedented) two
game winning streak in the Bru
ins' gym. Stanford has now beaten
UCLA the last five times the
teams have played.
"We just didn't have it
tonight," said UCLA coach Jim
Harrick, whose lost his second
straight game to fall to 13-3 (2-2).
"Stanford came in and played a
great game.... They're a good
team. When they play the way
they can, they're very good."
Of course, Harrick didn't
expect the Cardinal to be good
enough to hold his Bruins (who
were averaging 99.6 points per
game before last night) to just 82
points. UCLA was up 24-22 with
seven minutes left in the first half
but never led again, as Stanford's
man-to-man defense shut the
Bruins out for over four minutes
and the Cardinal went on a 15-0
tear.
UCLA shot a horrid 13-for-35
(.371) in the first half, which is
largely why Stanford was up 44-
36 at the break. The pathetic per
formance was led(?) by forward
Don (23.8 ppg) Mac Lean's 3-for
-10 effort. The Bruins turned it up
a notch in the second half, but still
finished the game shooting a less
than-spectacular 44 percent.
"Defense won this game, no
doubt about it," Keefe said. A
large part of that defense was pro
vided by forward Andrew Vlahov,
who harassed Mac Lean into an 8-
for-20 finish. "(Defensively) I
wasn't as good as I could've been:
He has a really quick release and
caught me by surprise a few
times," said Vlahov. "He was
pretty physical, and I think I
matched him pretty well at that."

'Any time you
come down here
and win it's a great,
great win.'
— Adam Keefe

Harrick agreed. "Vlahov did a
good job on Don," he said. "He
always does. He's very physical,
and Don missed a few shots he
normally would have made."
While he was keeping Mac Lean
under wraps at one end (as well as
exchanging the occasional elbow
pleasantries), Vlahov was contin
uing his recent out-of-his-mind
shooting performance at the
other. Vlahov made all four of his
shots from the floor in the first
half and finished with 12 points
and nine rebounds.
The Cardinal as a whole was on
fire at the offensive end: 15-for-25
(.600) in the first half, 29-for-50
for the game.
The most critical of those 29
hoops came after a timeout with
3:57 left in the game and the Car
dinal up 75-71. UCLA had gone on
an 8-1 run to get the lead down to
four, but after the timeout John
Patrick nailed a three (he and
Kenny Ammann hit five of their
nine downtowners) to get it to 78-
71.
A minute later, after Mac Lean
threw the ball out of bounds, Vla
hov tried to inbound — and saw
absolutely no one guarding Keefe,

who took off down the floor,
hauled in Vlahov's long bomb,
missed the layup, but then
grabbed the rebound and put the
ball in. Eighty to seventy-one.
After a Darrick Martin layup
and a timeout, the Bruins came
out in their press for the
umpteenth time. Stanford had
had problems with the press —
the Cardinal finished with 19
turnovers — but this time it was
broken perfectly: The ball got to
Keefe just beyond halfcourt, and
he sent a beautiful bounce pass to
Deshon Wingate, who took a step
and jammed it home for his 13th
and 14th points. Eighty-two to
seventy-three, 1:42 left.
The Cardinal bench went nuts
(as did all 15 Stanford fans in the
gym), Bruin fans started to take
off, and the Cardinal wrapped it
up — sort of — by making only 7
of 14 free throws in the last 100
seconds.
"No one knew how topsy-turvy
the Pac-10 was going to be this
year," Vlahov said. "We'll see in
the next few weeks who the men
and the boys are."
