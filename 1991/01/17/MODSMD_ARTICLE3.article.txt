SAN FRANCISCO — Violence erupted
last night as a spontaneous peace rally
degenerated into a free-for-all in downtown
San Francisco last night.
While the march started as a peaceful
protest against yesterday's U.S.-led attack
on Iraq, it soon became clear that the ral

the demonstration and a smaller camp
which seemed bent on destruction.
The protesters, whose numbers have
been estimated as ranging from 5,000 to
20,000, started gathering at the Civic Cen

the war was on.
Demonstrators then began a march
through San Francisco's downtown streets
intending to close the San Francisco-Oak
land Bay Bridge through non-violent resis

But the resistance was not entirely

peaceful, as demonstrators vandalized store
fronts and set a police car and scores of
garbage cans aflame.
Not everyone in the crowd knew exactly
what they felt should be done in the Gulf;
however, the overwhelming feeling was one
of fear and anger.
"The main reason I'm here is because
I'm really angry and I need to
do something about it," said Julie Rold, a
San Francisco resident who described her
self as a "concerned, angry citizen."
And while few ralliers believed that
President Bush was listening to the public
outcry against the war, a few remained opti
mistic about their ability to make a differ
ence.
"If enough people come out, some people
in government will listen," said Stanford
junior Patrick Hebert.
"You can't fight a good war without pop
ular support, and I think Bush knows he
doesn't have it," said Joe Schmitz, a Palo
Alto resident.
"Don't throw anything. Be peaceful, not
