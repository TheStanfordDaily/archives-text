# Marching for peace, S.F. protesters turn violent
## 
### June Cohen Editorial staff With AP wire reports 
SAN FRANCISCO — Violence erupted
last night as a spontaneous peace rally
degenerated into a free-for-all in downtown
San Francisco last night.
While the march started as a peaceful
protest against yesterday's U.S.-led attack
on Iraq, it soon became clear that the ral
liers were divided between those who vehe
mently protested the use of any violence in
the demonstration and a smaller camp
which seemed bent on destruction.
The protesters, whose numbers have
been estimated as ranging from 5,000 to
20,000, started gathering at the Civic Cen
ter around 5 p.m. after word spread that
the war was on.
Demonstrators then began a march
through San Francisco's downtown streets
intending to close the San Francisco-Oak
land Bay Bridge through non-violent resis
tance.
But the resistance was not entirely

peaceful, as demonstrators vandalized store
fronts and set a police car and scores of
garbage cans aflame.
Not everyone in the crowd knew exactly
what they felt should be done in the Gulf;
however, the overwhelming feeling was one
of fear and anger.
"The main reason I'm here is because
I'm really angry and I need to
do something about it," said Julie Rold, a
San Francisco resident who described her
self as a "concerned, angry citizen."
And while few ralliers believed that
President Bush was listening to the public
outcry against the war, a few remained opti
mistic about their ability to make a differ
ence.
"If enough people come out, some people
in government will listen," said Stanford
junior Patrick Hebert.
"You can't fight a good war without pop
ular support, and I think Bush knows he
doesn't have it," said Joe Schmitz, a Palo
Alto resident.
"Don't throw anything. Be peaceful, not

violent," Matthew Kaybbash entreated the
crowd at the entrance to the Bay Bridge.
The University of Hartford student said he
had seen a group of demonstrators smash
windows at Macy's with their torches, and
he said he feels this sort of vandalism gives
the whole movement a bad name.
Statues and buildings along the route
bore spray paint messages saying "Resist
the war" and "No blood for corporate
greed."
Protesters reached the bridge about 9:30
p.m. and proceeded to close it — the third
time demonstrators blocked traffic on the
span in two days. The bridge was reopened
in both directions at 10:49 p.m.
About 30 people sat in the bridge road
way until police in riot gear moved in and
forced them back into a larger group of
hundreds massed on an on-ramp.
Many protesters were outraged at the
brutality they said they experienced on the
bridge. Two UC-Berkeley students said
they were struck with billy clubs even
though they were doing their best to com
ply with police orders.
"Women were screaming, 'Please don't
hurt me.' We told them we were not here to
fight and they said, 'Well learn to fight,'"
claimed Allie Williams, a junior at Berkeley.
As people came streaming off the bridge,
the crowd began closing in on a squad car
that had been set aflame near the bridge
entry. A deafening noise shook the crowd as
the car, which had been burning for about
an hour, exploded. One woman was seri
ously injured and others visibly shaken as
people moved quickly away from the burnt
remains of the car, still smoldering in the
road.
Comparing the chaotic scene around him
with the rally in Palo Alto he attended only
hours earlier, Schmitz said, "In Palo Alto,
people just drive by and politely honk their
horns to show support."
As the flames from the burning squad
car rose higher and thick black smoke bil
lowed out over the bridge, an older man
turned his back on the scene and limped
away, leaning heavily on his cane and mut
tering, "This ain't what it's all about. Sav
ing kids is what it's all about. I got two kids
over there, and this ain't helping them."
Watching a police car burn, Ivana War
ren said she hates the violence that hap
pened during the march. Warren, a student
at San Francisco State University, said she
had been asking people to keep the demon
stration peaceful. "This is not a war
between the police and the protesters," she
added.
Vietnam veteran Russell Holman, an
outreach staff worker for the Coalition on
Homelessness in San Francisco, agreed
that harming property and people was
wrong. "This demonstration is about peace,
not violence," he said.
Disappointed with the low turnout of
Stanford students at the rally, Hebert said,
"We need to take this activism back to Stan
ford with us."

"Peqple need to develop a sense of prior
ities," Hebert added. "What relevance does
a political science test have when people are
dying in Iraq?"
"I wouldn't feel right if I sat home while
people are dying in the Middle East," said
Stanford junior Peter Prekourt.
"We committed the ultimate act of ter
rorism today," Prekourt said. "The only dif
ference between us and Iraqi civilians is
where we were born, and we had nothing to
do with that."
But Schmitz, who "skipped his aerobics
class" to attend the rally, was encouraged
by the number of young people participat
ing.
"This is the first political action I've
attended where people under 30 were the
foundation of supporters," Schmitz said.
After the bridge closure, the crowd
headed back to the Federal Building, where
police in riot gear declared the assembly
unlawful, allowing them to make arrests.
In front of the Civic Center, Bill Hack
well, one of the organizers, spoke to
protesters. "The people of Iraq are our sis
ters and brothers. We are instrumental in
ending this war.... We have had a tremen
dous march here tonight," he said.
During his speech, many in the crowd
screamed that the march was "not over"
and that they would "tear the city apart."
"What is key is people are furious,"
Hackwell said. "Our organization does not
tell them to trash things, but they are
mad."
Some protesters threw rocks to break
the windows at the Armed Forces Recruit
ing Center before police forced them to
stop. The police officers threatened to
arrest anyone who did not move away from
the center.
The marchers moved on, toward the
Federal Building. There, a few threw rocks
at the officers on guard and tipped over
newsstands. Onlooker Anthony Robinson
said the atmosphere of the march seemed
like a wild celebration. "The violence is
undermining what they are trying to do,"
he said.
To the East in Berkeley, about 100
protesters ran onto Highway 80, playing a
cat-and-mouse game with highway patrol
officers. The protesters would be chased off
to the side, but quickly return to the road
way.
Earlier, high school students in Oakland
forced the closure of several city streets.
And in Alameda, police raised a drawbridge
to halt another band of student protesters.
In Chico, more than 100 anti-war
protesters gathered outside closed military
recruitment offices to participate in a can
dlelight vigil after war broke out.
Within hours of the first U.S. air strike
on Baghdad, thousands of protesters
marched through Santa Cruz, crying out
against military force and asking motorists
to "honk if you hate war."
The protesters, estimated by police at
3,500, interrupted traffic throughout the
downtown area and closed Highway 17 for
about one hour. No incidents of violence
were reported and no arrests made.

SAN FRANCISCO — Violence erupted
last night as a spontaneous peace rally
degenerated into a free-for-all in downtown
San Francisco last night.
While the march started as a peaceful
protest against yesterday's U.S.-led attack
on Iraq, it soon became clear that the ral
liers were divided between those who vehe
mently protested the use of any violence in
the demonstration and a smaller camp
which seemed bent on destruction.
The protesters, whose numbers have
been estimated as ranging from 5,000 to
20,000, started gathering at the Civic Cen
ter around 5 p.m. after word spread that
the war was on.
Demonstrators then began a march
through San Francisco's downtown streets
intending to close the San Francisco-Oak
land Bay Bridge through non-violent resis
tance.
But the resistance was not entirely

peaceful, as demonstrators vandalized store
fronts and set a police car and scores of
garbage cans aflame.
Not everyone in the crowd knew exactly
what they felt should be done in the Gulf;
however, the overwhelming feeling was one
of fear and anger.
"The main reason I'm here is because
I'm really angry and I need to
do something about it," said Julie Rold, a
San Francisco resident who described her
self as a "concerned, angry citizen."
And while few ralliers believed that
President Bush was listening to the public
outcry against the war, a few remained opti
mistic about their ability to make a differ
ence.
"If enough people come out, some people
in government will listen," said Stanford
junior Patrick Hebert.
"You can't fight a good war without pop
ular support, and I think Bush knows he
doesn't have it," said Joe Schmitz, a Palo
Alto resident.
"Don't throw anything. Be peaceful, not

A protest attended by thousands In San Francisco turned violent last night when protesters lit a police car on fire. The rally
was the largest of many held In Northern California.
violent," Matthew Kaybbash entreated the
crowd at the entrance to the Bay Bridge.
The University of Hartford student said he
had seen a group of demonstrators smash
windows at Macy's with their torches, and
he said he feels this sort of vandalism gives
the whole movement a bad name.
Statues and buildings along the route
bore spray paint messages saying "Resist
the war" and "No blood for corporate
greed."
Protesters reached the bridge about 9:30
p.m. and proceeded to close it — the third
time demonstrators blocked traffic on the
span in two days. The bridge was reopened
in both directions at 10:49 p.m.
About 30 people sat in the bridge road
way until police in riot gear moved in and
forced them back into a larger group of
hundreds massed on an on-ramp.
Many protesters were outraged at the
brutality they said they experienced on the
bridge. Two UC-Berkeley students said
they were struck with billy clubs even
though they were doing their best to com
ply with police orders.
"Women were screaming, 'Please don't
hurt me.' We told them we were not here to
fight and they said, 'Well learn to fight,'"
claimed Allie Williams, a junior at Berkeley.
As people came streaming off the bridge,
the crowd began closing in on a squad car
that had been set aflame near the bridge
entry. A deafening noise shook the crowd as
the car, which had been burning for about
an hour, exploded. One woman was seri
ously injured and others visibly shaken as
people moved quickly away from the burnt
remains of the car, still smoldering in the
road.
Comparing the chaotic scene around him
with the rally in Palo Alto he attended only
hours earlier, Schmitz said, "In Palo Alto,
people just drive by and politely honk their
horns to show support."
As the flames from the burning squad
car rose higher and thick black smoke bil
lowed out over the bridge, an older man
turned his back on the scene and limped
away, leaning heavily on his cane and mut
tering, "This ain't what it's all about. Sav
ing kids is what it's all about. I got two kids
over there, and this ain't helping them."
Watching a police car burn, Ivana War
ren said she hates the violence that hap
pened during the march. Warren, a student
at San Francisco State University, said she
had been asking people to keep the demon
stration peaceful. "This is not a war
between the police and the protesters," she
added.
Vietnam veteran Russell Holman, an
outreach staff worker for the Coalition on
Homelessness in San Francisco, agreed
that harming property and people was
wrong. "This demonstration is about peace,
not violence," he said.
Disappointed with the low turnout of
Stanford students at the rally, Hebert said,
"We need to take this activism back to Stan
ford with us."

"Peqple need to develop a sense of prior
ities," Hebert added. "What relevance does
a political science test have when people are
dying in Iraq?"
"I wouldn't feel right if I sat home while
people are dying in the Middle East," said
Stanford junior Peter Prekourt.
"We committed the ultimate act of ter
rorism today," Prekourt said. "The only dif
ference between us and Iraqi civilians is
where we were born, and we had nothing to
do with that."
But Schmitz, who "skipped his aerobics
class" to attend the rally, was encouraged
by the number of young people participat
ing.
"This is the first political action I've
attended where people under 30 were the
foundation of supporters," Schmitz said.
After the bridge closure, the crowd
headed back to the Federal Building, where
police in riot gear declared the assembly
unlawful, allowing them to make arrests.
In front of the Civic Center, Bill Hack
well, one of the organizers, spoke to
protesters. "The people of Iraq are our sis
ters and brothers. We are instrumental in
ending this war.... We have had a tremen
dous march here tonight," he said.
During his speech, many in the crowd
screamed that the march was "not over"
and that they would "tear the city apart."
"What is key is people are furious,"
Hackwell said. "Our organization does not
tell them to trash things, but they are
mad."
Some protesters threw rocks to break
the windows at the Armed Forces Recruit
ing Center before police forced them to
stop. The police officers threatened to
arrest anyone who did not move away from
the center.
The marchers moved on, toward the
Federal Building. There, a few threw rocks
at the officers on guard and tipped over
newsstands. Onlooker Anthony Robinson
said the atmosphere of the march seemed
like a wild celebration. "The violence is
undermining what they are trying to do,"
he said.
To the East in Berkeley, about 100
protesters ran onto Highway 80, playing a
cat-and-mouse game with highway patrol
officers. The protesters would be chased off
to the side, but quickly return to the road
way.
Earlier, high school students in Oakland
forced the closure of several city streets.
And in Alameda, police raised a drawbridge
to halt another band of student protesters.
In Chico, more than 100 anti-war
protesters gathered outside closed military
recruitment offices to participate in a can
dlelight vigil after war broke out.
Within hours of the first U.S. air strike
on Baghdad, thousands of protesters
marched through Santa Cruz, crying out
against military force and asking motorists
to "honk if you hate war."
The protesters, estimated by police at
3,500, interrupted traffic throughout the
downtown area and closed Highway 17 for
about one hour. No incidents of violence
were reported and no arrests made.
