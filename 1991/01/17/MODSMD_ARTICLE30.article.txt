# Lemieux who? Wayne Gretzky is still the Great One
## 
### 
Starting next November, the Bay
Area will be become a truly great
metropolis once again. High culture
returns to Northern California when, in
the great tradition of the California
Golden Seals, the San Jose Sharks take to
the ice for the first time. Professional
hockey has returned, and all of us from
the less balmy areas of the country can
finally count our blessings. The National
Hockey League has finally become truly
national.
And in celebration of this event, I'm
going to present to all of you, and answer,
the greatest hockey debate ever.
Who's the better hockey player?
Wayne Gretzky or that guy from Pitts
burgh who always has an injured back?
And, no, this is not an unbiased discus
sion. This is pure unabashed fan adula
tion. Mario Lemieux n'est pas le mieux.
Le mieux, c'est le Great Gretzky.
Lemieux is in the hospital. Gretzky is
in the all-star game in spite of playing for
the Los Angeles Kings. Gretzky is once
again leading the league in scoring with
87 points, 13 points ahead of the second

leading scorer.
The Great One broke Gordie Howe's
career scoring record last season in his
10th year in the NHL. Howe played 26
seasons. Gretzky holds the single-season
records for goals, assists, total points and
who knows what else. He won three Stan
ley Cups with the Edmonton Oilers and
once received the Conn Smythe trophy
for most valuable player in the playoffs.
Gretzky has positioned the Kings as
the midseason leader of the Smythe Divi
sion in his third season in L.A. This was
the L.A. team that was decimated by
owner Bruce McNair's three-player, $21-
million deal with the Oilers that brought

the Great One to Southern California.
In the 1983-84 season, the only year
for which I could find hockey statistics,
the Great One lead the league in the scor
ing statistics with 87 points and 118
assists for 205 points. He lead the league
in power-play goals, short-handed goals
and was second in game-winning goals.
He topped the league in shooting percent
age. I'm not kidding.
And that was just his fourth season in
the league. It was his second-best season.
His best was the next year, in which he
scored 92 goals.
But Gretzky is so much more than a
scoring machine. He's played in all
45 of the Kings' games this season
but has only six penalty minutes. That's
three minor penalties in 45 games.
He's the ambassador of the game. In
the Smythe Division finals of the 1986
Stanley Cup playoffs defenseman team
mate Steve Smith took a loose puck
behind the Edmonton net, passed it
across the mouth of the goal and bounced
it off goalkeeper Grant Fuhr's skate into

his own net. That third-period, seventh
game own-goal was the winner for the
Calgary Flames, who went on to the Cup
finals. As Smith sobbed on the Edmonton
bench after the game, Gretzky sat and
comforted him.
Gretzky requested to be traded in the
summer of 1988 after he learned that
Oiler owner Peter Bocklington was shop
ping him around without his consent.
Though he felt betrayed, as did all of
Canada, Gretzky graciously wiped away
the tears and talked about how he would
miss his best friend, linemate Mark
Messier. He spoke no words of anger.
The Great One is poetry on ice. In the
1985 Stanley Cup finals against the
Philadelphia Flyers, Gretzky raced into
the zone as a lone teammate took a slap
shot from the right point. As Gretzky
skated on goal from the left, Flyer
defenseman Dave Brown stood between
the net and Gretzky and executed a text
book hip check on the Great One to push
him harmlessly to the left of the goal. As
Brown followed through, Gretzky started
spinning and losing his balance as the

shot ricocheted off the pipe and into the
air.
As Gretzky spun to the ice, maybe 15
feet to the extreme left of goalkeeper Ron
Hextall, he raised his stick to shoulder
level and swated the puck on goal. The
shot struck the stunned Hextall smack in
the stomach and trickled harmlessly to
his right. It didn't go into the net. But it
was, in my opinion, the greatest hockey
shot ever taken. No one else could have
taken that shot.
So what if Lemieux is bigger and
stronger. A lot of good that does him in .a
hospital bed.
You see (or you will see when the Kings
come to the Bay Area next season), Gret
zky is not just a player. He is the embodi
ment of modern hockey. He is not the
biggest player or the fastest player in the
league. He is not the flashiest.
But no one combines all the elements
of hockey as well as Gretzky does. He's
the ideal hybrid of speed, strength, touch,
balance, finesse and, most of all, determi
nation. It is for this reason that he has
revolutionized the modern game.
