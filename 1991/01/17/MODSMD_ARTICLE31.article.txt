# Taylor working her way into Stanford lineup

### David Hirning Senior staff writer 
There are a lot of ways to describe
sophomore Angela Taylor of the Cardi
nal women's basketball team, but one
thing that seems to stand out is her
flair for the dramatic.
How else can you capture a player
who turned down basketball offers
from two other Pacific 10 Conference
schools to walk-on at Stanford, the
defending conference champion and
No. 2-ranked team in the country?
Someone who, after making the team,
launched a three-pointer in her first
collegiate field goal attempt — and
made it?
Taylor is a little unique, from her
background in Mountain Home,

Idaho, right down to her shoes, which
are a flashy black hue. In a way, Taylor
has to be flashy to get noticed.
Not a lot of college basketball
recruiters make Mountain Home a
regular stop in their travels. Taylor,
who averaged almost 20 points a game
her senior year, was the only player on
her high school team who had aspira
tions to play in college. When Oregon
State and USC showed some interest,
most people would have jumped at the
opportunity.
But the 5-foot-6 guard had bigger
ideas. Older brother Gary had come to
Stanford on a football scholarship, and
the youngest Taylor came away from a
campus visit sold. "I knew I wanted to
come here, so I figured I'd just walk on
and give it my best shot," Taylor said.

"She wasn't someone we saw (in
high school)," Stanford coach Tara
VanDerveer said. "We have several
people try out each year, but she just
set herself apart in conditioning. She
made up her mind she was going to
make the team."
Four days into fall practice, Taylor
did make a Cardinal squad that was
already loaded with talent at guard. At
first Taylor thought she wouldn't even
travel as the 13th player, but two
weeks later forwards Celeste Lavoie
and Tammy Svoboda quit the team.
Although her playing time was min
imal, Taylor impressed in practice and
by mid-December had earned a schol
arship. She has been a crowd favorite
ever since.
"I don't think of her in walk-on
terms," VanDerveer said. "She's an
important part of our team. The more
I see her play, the more confidence I
have in her. She goes after the ball,
goes on the floor, takes the charge —
we need everyone to play like that."
Limited to mop-up time last year,
Taylor's role has become more visible
this season, and she was one of the
first subs to enter the big game against
Washington last week. "I learned a lot
sitting on the bendh (last season)," ahe
said, "and I worked out with Jennifer
(Azzi) all summer.
"My job is to come in and play good
'D,' to give Sor\ja (Henning) a break,
and to try to help on offense."
But give her the chance, and Taylor
will show what she can do. Against
Washington, she provided perhaps the
most exciting moment, when she drove
the lane and then dished to Julie Zeil
stra for an easy lay-up.
VanDerveer didn't speculate on
Taylor's future role, but it is apparent
that she will be seeing more playing
time in the coming games. "Before I
would tell her, 'Just play defense,' but
now I say, 'Take your shot,'" the coach
said. "She's in good condition, and
plays through injuries — she has an
excellent attitude."
Although she could be playing more

elsewhere, Taylor sees things opening
up for her and is happy with the choice
she made. "On another team, I might
not have improved as much," she said.
"I play against Sor\ja in practice, and
she's the best point guard in the coun
try. Last year I didn't try to create (in
practice), but this year they're looking
at me more."
Reflecting on how far she has come,
Taylor admits that "it's pretty amaz
ing. I wasn't even sure I'd make the
team." Now that she is contributing
and has a championship ring, she looks
forward to the next two-and-a-half
years, and notes that she "wouldn't
mind" a chance to play in this year's
Final Four. Taylor didn't make it into
either game there last year.
Can you think of a better place for
someone with a flair for the dramatic
to be?
