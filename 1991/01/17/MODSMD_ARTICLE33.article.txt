The Stanford wrestling team, at full
strength for the first time in nearly three
weeks, returned to its position in the top half
of the Pacific 10 Conference last night, tying a
strong Fresno State club, 17-17, at Burnham
Pavilion.
According to coach Chris Horpel, the
turnaround couldn't have come at a better
time.
"Now that's more like it," Horpel exclaimed
after the match. "It really makes a great differ
ence to have our starters back."
He wasn't exaggerating. The five first
stringers that returned to the lineup tallied a
total of four victories and 14 points. More
importantly, they instilled a level of enthusi
asm that had seemed to be lacking for the past
two weeks.
"We had the kind of intensity and effort that
I always hope for," said Horpel. "We really had
them on the ropes."
Stanford's Lance Johnson was impressive
in returning to action last night at 134 pounds.
In his first bout since being sidelined with a
pinched nerve in his neck, Johnson found him
self down by two points midway through the
third period. The freshman scored an escape
point with two seconds left, earning a hard
fought 8-7 victory.
Matt Topham, coming ofT a painful rotator
cuff shoulder problem, showed no signs of his
iryury in the 158-pound event. The junior
scored three takedowns in registering an 8-4
win.
The return of Steve Buddie was perhaps the
most encouraging sign of all for the Cardinal.
The senior Ail-American, wrestling with a
bulky brace on his elbow, was simply dominat
ing in scoring an 18-2 technical fall at 0:16 of
the second period. The 167-pounder improved
his record to 16-2.
At 190, Mark Graham scored a convincing
10-5 win. The junior, nursing a sprained
ankle, physically controlled his opponent, scor
ing three takedowns.
Saturday, Stanford faces UC-Davis in Davis.
Horpel seemed upbeat about the squad's
chances. "As long as we stay healthy, we should
have no real problems with the Aggies."
