# More than 300 pray for peace
## Candlelight vigil participants hope for quick resolution 
### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Staff writer 
More than 300 people gathered in White Plaza
last night for a candlelight vigil to object to the start
of war in the Persian Gulf and to express hope for a
quick resolution of the conflict.
The vigil, organized by various campus peace
groups, began with a moment of silence at 11:15 pm.
Somber-faced protesters huddled in the crisp
night air to listen to anti-war songs and speeches,
share anger and provide mutual comfort from the
shock of yesterday's military strike on Iraq by U.S.
forces.
Amid enthusiastic crowd chants of "What do We
Want? Peace! When do We Want It? Now!" and
"Peace Now! War, No!" individuals expressed their
views on the war.
"I am numb, paralyzed," said Frank Lester, a
1988 Stanford graduate. "There is a part of you that
hoped [war] would not happen. Now that it has, I am
holding out faith that it will end soon," he said.
"I feel strongly that war is not the solution,"
explained protester Steve Levitsky, a fifth-year
senior, as he listened to radio reports on the fighting
in Iraq and Kuwait. "Like the rest of the people here
at the vigil, I will be resisting this show of military
force."
Sitting or standing, the candle-holding protesters

— current students, recent graduates and local resi
dents — formed a sea of flickering "lights of hope,"
as some in the crowd called them.
Junior Sherifa Edoga encouraged listeners to fol
low their consciences. "We can sit around here and
be silent or we can sit and think about the lives we
could work to save," she said to cheers from the
crowd.
Molly Cummings, who graduated last year,
echoed a similar theme. She said she "was mad as
hell" over the war. "We have to turn our negative
energy into positive energy. Wake up, Stanford," she
shouted.
For sophomore Lisa King, who heard about the
start of war while at work at the Bookstore, the news
has created some tension in her life. "I'm starting to
get edgy. My [friends] and I started to bite at one
another," she said, sitting in a circle at the vigil with
two companions. "And we haven't gotten any school
work done. It is hard to concentrate," King added.
"It is just hard to know how to react to it all,"
chimed in King's friend Victor Barclay, a sophomore.
"You ask yourself, 'What should I be doing?' "
Assoc. Dean of Memorial Church Floyd
Thompkins was also at the vigil. When asked to com
ment on yesterday's ceremony, he pointed out the
lyrics of a folk song a guitarist was singing to the
crowd: "All we are saying is give peace a chance."
