## THE 						STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINING WEEKLY NORTH VS. Head North for slopes, South for slots SOUTH 
### Tim Marklein Editorial staff 
So it's not really a burning
issue. But recognizing the compar
ative merits of skiing in North vs.
South Lake Ikhoe can make it eas
ier to tailor your ski weekend plans
for your particular tastes.
When it comes right down to it,
the distinction is fairly simple. Bet
ter skiers claim that North Ikhoe
boasts the best skiing in the area,
while South Tahoe has the benefits
— or unwanted distractions — of a
more exciting nightlife.
Basically, the choice is between
slopes and slots.
North Tahoe definitely has
more ski areas to choose from,
with the ever-popular Squaw Valley
(site of the 1976 Winter Olympics)
and less-crowded Alpine Meadows
and Northstar leading the pack.
Squaw and Alpine are the
favorites of Stanford ski team co

captain Pete Blitz, who said he
prefers the "very accessible back
country skiing" on Granite Chief
chair at Squaw. A close second are
the numerous chutes and cliffs
that make Alpine's Scott Chair a
challenge.
Smaller crowds and shorter lift
lines make Alpine and Northstar a
more appealing option than facing
the crowds at Squaw.
For the South Lake, Blitz charac
terizes the skiing as "almost
entirely intermediate," noting that
the southern resorts don't cater to
better skiers. Thie, Heavenly Val
ley's greatest claim to fame is its
view, as some have called it"the
most beautiful place in the world"
— or so their brochures say.
On the other hand, Blitz notes,
"The views are incredible any
where on the lake."
What the South Lake does offer
are several attractions absent from
the North, most notably Harrah's
and Harvey's casinos. For those
trip-takers who want to skip the
slopes for a day, or want to make a
little tuition money for spring
quarter, the southside is the place
to visit.
But for the true-blue skier,
blackjack tables won't highlight
the weekend as much as sipping

hot chocolate in a large, wooden
cabin after a hard day of skiing.
For those taking advantage of
the upcoming three-day weekend,
the skiing may not be as heavenly
as normal. Most reports show
lower-than-normal snow bases
with rougher surfaces and fewer
open runs.
"They lost a lot of snow last
week because of the rain," Blitz
said, explaining that the warm
temperatures allowed some of the
accumulated base to turn to slush.
For the time being, then, the
best places to ski are the resorts
that can make their own snow. The
water shortage and some burst

pipes have made it difficult, but
Alpine, Heavenly and Boreal have
had the best results with the artifi
cial white stuff.
While fewer runs may be open,
most of the beginning and interme
diate slopes on the lower parts of
mountains have adequate snow —
and there's always the chance for a
new blast. Cross your fingers.
If you're at Tahoe this Monday
and another day of skiing doesn't
grab you, the Stanford ski team and
Squaw Valley will host 120 skiers
from colleges throughout Northern
California and Nevada in their
Invitational Ski Meet. "Some of the
top skiers in the nation are going to

be there," Blitz said

For those who have forgotten how
much a lift ticket costs nowadays,
you only have to remember this:
Take a lot of money. Although a
little searching could lead to
cheaper tickets or occasional deals,
lift rates usually fall between the
$30 and $40 range. BASS ticket
outlets now offer discount lift tick
ets for Squaw Valley at a cost of
$35 apiece, including service
charge — still $3 less than the
resort's price. Tickets can be pur
chased oy calling 762-BASS or vis
iting the Tresidder Ticket Office.
