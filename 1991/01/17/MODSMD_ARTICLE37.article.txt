# Just when you thought you were safe: A Year in TV top ten list
## 
### Matthew T. Dresden 
Well, it's that time of the year again,
when you've read just about as many
reviews of the year as you can stand. It's
almost the middle of January, so you prob
ably think that you're in the clear until
next December. But you're wrong. You can
stand another. So here goes — the top 10
television shows of 1990.
Now, I'm sure some of you will be con
fused by this list, so let me preface it with
a few comments. This is a list of the top 10
television shows of the year just Dast. Not
the top 10 of the school yeai; or of this tele
vision season, but of the year That means
that shows from last season can and will
be mentioned. Why? Because it is possible,
through the magic of television, for two
seasons to be contained in one year. And
you see, the year 1990 is what has run its
course. Got it? Okay.
1. "Parker Lewis Can't Lose"
No, the above line is not a misprint.
Yeah, I can hear you know-nothings com
plaining now. ("What? Who watches that
show?") Let me just tell you that if you
don't watch "Parker," too bad, because you
are missing out on the most creative show
on television. Not only is it consistently
funny, but it also has great writing, great
characters and is always trying out new
catch-phrases, sound effects and camera
angles — all of which combine to make
this the most enjoyable show on televi
sion.
2. "Twin Peaks"
Some people at Stanford have told me

that "TWin Peaks" is dumb. That it's bor
ing. "What?" I think. "These people can't
be serious." Of course, the reason they say
these things is that they haven't ever
watched the show. "Oh, I've seen part of a
show," they say. "It was lame." These are
the same kind of people who would have
thought that Picasso was an untalented
doodler. They have no means for appreciat
ing something that isn't like what they
already know.
"TWin Peaks" is exciting, amusing, hor
rifying and just plain weirdL I read that one
critic called it a "major motion picture
every week." I might not go that far, but a
great many of the episodes compare favor
ably with last year's movies.
So for all you nay-sayers out there: find
someone who has the two-hour pilot on
tape and watch it. Then, and only then,
can you possibly say something like "I've
seen 'TWin Peaks' and I didn't like it."
You'll be wrong, of course, but at least your
statement will have some grounding in
rationality.
3. "The Simpsons"
Yes, it's a bigger fad than Pet Rocks.
Every dork and his mother has some item
of Simpsons paraphernalia. I admit that I
cringe every time I see someone wearing a
Simpsons t-shirt, especially when it's me
wearing last year's Sena dorm shirt. But
the fact of the matter is that "The Simp
sons" is still a good show. It is innovative,
imaginative, and truly funny. The episode
a few weeks ago where Marge campaigned
against television violence was hilarious
and topical, and with all that, still man

aged to poke fun at itself at the same time.
4. "LA. Law"
The players in "L.A. Law" may be aging,
but they're aging gracefully. The writing
has rarely been better than it was last sea
son, and although it has dropped off a bit
this season, I'm still liking the addition of
John Spencer and babe-ticious Amanda
Donohoe "Lair of the White Worm" to the
cast.
Plot-wise, things look good too. Last
season's intrigue with firm-wrecker Diana
Muldaur (Rosalind Shays) kept me on the
edge of my seat waiting for every week's
episode, and it looks like Rosalind's back
for more mayhem this year.
5. "The Flash"
Good writing, good acting and great spe
cial effects (not to mention theme music
by Danny Elfman) make "The Flash" my
sleeper pick of the season. This show really
shouldn't be overlooked, because it's a lot
of fun. And it's got Amanda Pays (a.k.a.
Mrs. Corbin Bernsen) of "Max Headroom"
fame to boot. The only problem is that it's
an hour long and scheduled on Thursday
nights at 8:30, which means that it over
laps ...
6. "Cheers"
It's not the same as it was a few years
ago, but I'm not sure if that's all bad. The
cast is clearly having a great time making
the shows, and the shows themselves are
often very funny. If the characters weren't
so perfect, I would say the show was in
danger of stagnating. Tne only thing that is
keeping "Cheers" from the top five is sim
ply that it's not as consistently funny as it

used to be.
7. Late Night with David Letterman
TVo words for those of you who don't
ever stay up to watch "Letterman." Tape it.
Because Dave is in rare form these days —
he is skewering his guests left and right,
and he doesn't seem to care. I love it.
8. (tie) "Quantum Leap" and "Star Trek:
The Next Generation"
Both of these shows regularly exhibit
imagination, creativity and compassion far
beyond most shows. The only problem
with these shows is one of execution.
"Quantum Leap'"s Scott Bakula is a tal
ented actor, and Dean Stockwell ("Blue
Velvet") is always amazing. The premise of
the show, that Bakula as Dr. Sam Becket
(get it?) is always "jumping" through time
and assuming someone else's identity, is a
great one, and thus far it hasn't been
played for camp or cheap laughs. However,
the writers often try to do too much in one
episode. But despite its flaws, "Leap"
receives an 'A' for effort.
The problem with "Star TYek:The Next
Generation" is a different one. Sometimes
its shows are, for lack of a better word, bor
ing. But when the show is on, it's on. Last
season's cliffhanger with the Bore was one
of the best hours of television of the year.
In fact, that episode alone is enough to put
it on this list. And as far as future episodes
are concerned, "Next Generation" watch
ers everywhere are rejoicing because Wil
Wheaton (Wesley Crusher), the bane of
good episodes, is gone — and the word I
heard was "indefinitely."
9. (tie) "In Living Color" and "Saturday

Night Live"
Last season, "In Living Color" was top
ical, creative and seriously funny. This sea
son, it sucks. I have no idea what hap
pened, because the writing and acting
corps is unchanged. All I can say is that
Keenen Ivory Wayans better get his butt in
gear.
"Saturday Night Live" is sometimes the
longest hour-and-a- half on television,
because there are weeks when the writing
is truly awful. But Mike Meyers is the fun
niest person on television right now, and
just one 3-minute segment of him on
"Wayne's World" or "Sprockets" can sup
ply amusement for weeks.
10. "The A-Team"
"What? you say. "I thought that went oft
the air."
Well, yes and no. You see, through the
magic of television, reruns appear on TV
-20 every day at 6 p.m. And after a hard day
of school, there's nothing quite like com
ing home to Hannibal, Face Man,
doch and B.A. Baracus — and on any day
of the week that I want, too. How, I ask,
how can you beat that? Answer: you can't.
Close ... But No Cigar (a.k.a. Best of the
Rest)
"The Wonder Years," "Seinfeld," "Mur
phy Brown," "thirtysomething," "North
ern Exposure."
I know I'm going to get some grief on
this from the girl down the hall who is a
Murphymaniac. Okay, I'll admit that
"Murphy Brown" is well-acted most of the
time, fcut it just isn't that funny. Sorry.
Ditto for "thirtysomething."
