Dancing in nature's patterns

Astronomy and geometry are unique sources of inspiration for
choreographer Laura Dean, who uses nature's own patterns to cre
ate new performance pieces for her Laura Dean Dancers and
Musicians. The 11-member troupe and accompanying 4-member
musical ensemble will perform Tuesday at 8 p.m. in Memorial
Auditorium. The Lively Arts at Stanford presentation includes the
West Coast premiere of "Infinity," along with "Equator" and
"Tympani." Tickets are available at the Tresidder Ticket Office
(725-ARTS). The group will also conduct a special Master Class at
Roble Gym Monday from 2:15 p.m. to 4:15 p.m. Information is
available at 723-2551.

Winter One of 1991

Some of the most traditionally innovative dramatic perfor
mances that occur at Stanford are back â€” the Winter One Acts run
through Sunday with three dramatic presentations by Stanford stu
dents. The triad consists of Karen Zacarias' "Blue Buick in My
Driveway/' Adam Tobin's "Home is Man's Castle," and Charan
Devereaux's "The Appointment." Performances run through
Saturday at 8 p.m. with a 2 p.m. Sunday matinee, all at Ricker
Dining Center in Governor's Corner. The usual Nitery location was
unavailable because of burst water pipes. Tickets are available from
Ram's Head in White Plaza from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m daily.

Mozart and Muddy Waters

Mixing elements of classical music and urban blues into an
innovative, yet accessible sound, Corky Siegel's Chamber Blues has
received accolades from reviewers across the country, "as if blending
Mozart and Muddy Waters was the most logical thing in the world."
(South Bend Tribune) The quartet will appear at Dinkelspiel
Auditorium at 8 p.m. Friday in a Lively Arts performance.
