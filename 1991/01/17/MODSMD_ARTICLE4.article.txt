# Leaders organize campus response
## 
### Eric Young Senior staff writer 
Just minutes after hearing the
first reports of the Persian Gulf
War yesterday, a somber group of
University administrators and
students discussed how to deal
with the emotional and adminis
trative stresses the Mideast con
flict may cause at Stanford.
Organized yesterday morning
in a flurry of phone calls, the
meeting served as the first brain
storming and organizing session
for 35 representatives of organiza
tions such as the ASSU Council of
Presidents, the Office of Student
Affairs, Counseling and Psycho
logical Services and the Office of
Residential Education. The meet
ing had been planned before
reports of the bombings reached
campus.
On a personal level, the meet
ing, held in a small room attached

to Memorial Church, was a time
for some to express how they felt
upon hearing the first reports of
battle in the Middle East. Admin
istrators and students, reflecting
the grim mood of the campus as
news of the war spread, filed qui
etly into the meeting room and
discussed in whispers the news
reports they had heard.
Although some participants
said they thought it would be
appropriate to cancel classes or
close the University, classes and
other University-sponsored
events will continue as scheduled
today.
Led by Assoc. Dean of Student
Affairs Michael Jackson, a hand
ful of participants began organiz
ing a gathering of the Stanford
community scheduled for 3 p.m.
today in the Quad.
