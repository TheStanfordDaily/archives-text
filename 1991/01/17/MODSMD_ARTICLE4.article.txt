# Leaders organize campus response
## 
### Eric Young Senior staff writer 
Just minutes after hearing the
first reports of the Persian Gulf
War yesterday, a somber group of
University administrators and
students discussed how to deal
with the emotional and adminis
trative stresses the Mideast con
flict may cause at Stanford.
Organized yesterday morning
in a flurry of phone calls, the
meeting served as the first brain
storming and organizing session
for 35 representatives of organiza
tions such as the ASSU Council of
Presidents, the Office of Student
Affairs, Counseling and Psycho
logical Services and the Office of
Residential Education. The meet
ing had been planned before
reports of the bombings reached
campus.
On a personal level, the meet
ing, held in a small room attached

to Memorial Church, was a time
for some to express how they felt
upon hearing the first reports of
battle in the Middle East. Admin
istrators and students, reflecting
the grim mood of the campus as
news of the war spread, filed qui
etly into the meeting room and
discussed in whispers the news
reports they had heard.
Although some participants
said they thought it would be
appropriate to cancel classes or
close the University, classes and
other University-sponsored
events will continue as scheduled
today.
Led by Assoc. Dean of Student
Affairs Michael Jackson, a hand
ful of participants began organiz
ing a gathering of the Stanford
community scheduled for 3 p.m.
today in the Quad.
Organizers stressed the need
for people at Stanford to accept
divergent opinions about the war
and looked to today's gathering —
intended to be free of political
overtones — as a way for students
to begin that process.
The gathering will serve as a
"way for people to come together,"
said Greg Ricks, multicultural
educator for Res Ed.
COP member Goodwin Liu
said he expects the turnout for the
gathering to be in the thousands.
Liu added that he hoped the
event, expected to last about a half
hour, would show that the Univer
sity does not think this is "busi
ness as usual; this is war."
University President Donald
Kennedy and a student represen
tative are scheduled to speak, Liu
said.
Following the Memorial
Church meeting, the COP
announced that beginning today
their main phone line — 725-
ASSU — will contain recorded
messages with information about

counseling services, relief efforts
or programs concerning the
Mideast war.
The group will meet again
today at 1 p.m. to continue plan
ning.
While administrators and stu
dents discussed ways for the Stan
ford community to deal with the
war, Kennedy said he hoped cam
pus leaders would not let differing
views on the war stymie their
efforts. "We need to recognize the
legitimacy of the different views
here," he said at the Memorial
Church meeting.
Kennedy also gave his view on
whether the University should
make a statement about the war
by shutting down or by canceling
classes. During such a stressful
time, Kennedy said, "it seems
almost illegitimate to continue
with activities. But we all have
people relying on us, and we need
to respect the order of business.
There is a lot of room for individ
ual decisions."
Kennedy pledged he would get
Provost James Rosse and the
department deans acting quickly
to help facilitate administrators'
efforts to deal with student and

faculty needs.
Ann Porteus, assistant director
of Res Ed, promoted the establish
ment of an informational nerve
center on campus. She suggested
that a room in Tresidder Union
with a television tuned to a news
channel might help anxious peo
ple as they struggle to keep up
with breaking events.
Along with trying to provide
news of what is happening in the
Gulf and on campus, administra
tors and students at the meeting
said they will gear up for the emo
tional toll that the war will take.
"People are going to be full of
grief, loss, anger and in some cases
denial," said Alejandro Martinez,
CAPS director. "Probably the
most salient need now is to deal
with emotional reactions."
Martinez said CAPS had
planned to begin a support group
Monday for people with friends or
family in the Gulf. The group may
begin today or tomorrow, he said.
Prayer services that began this
week in the Clubhouse will con
tinue, said Bob Gregg, dean of the
Memorial Church chapel. He said
he expects the services, which
begin at 5 p.m. Monday through

Friday, to continue for at least
three weeks.
Several administrators and
students called for teach-ins on
the Persian Gulf. While the idea is
still being developed, Kennedy
stressed that "balance is awfully
important." An easy way for a
teach-in to lose legitimacy, he
warned, is if the event seems to be
slanted toward a particular view.
While administrators and stu
dents covered many bases during
their early evening meeting, much
organizing was taking place out
side the meeting. For example,
Assoc. Dean of Residential Affairs
Diana Conklin, who attended the
meeting briefly, said she was busy
with security matters on campus.
Conklin had her staff contact
University police to discuss what
ways they and the community
might deal with terrorist attacks
on campus. While she did not out
line any specific concerns, Conklin
said Residential Affairs was trying
to get information available to
students and faculty regarding
ways to prevent and deal with a
terrorist threat.
Involved in organizational
activities since 8:30 a.m. yester
day, Liu said last night that he
thought the "timing was right"
for such meetings with adminis
trators to take place. "We are
meeting immediate needs and
doing the best we can," he said.
