## 'Blossom' tries hard but isn't quite a rose 
### 
Any mid-season replacement
show faces an uphill climb.
By starting in January, a new
program must contend with real
barriers to network longevity:
established competition, lack of
publicity and executive pressure
for an instant hit.
The creators of "Blossom"
(NBC, Mondays at 8:30 p.m.)
nave made their quest for fall
renewal all the more difficult bv
hampering a likable show witn
excessively moralistic attempts
at addressing current issues.
While NBC continued its
five-year reign as ratings cham
pion in the November sweeps,
programmers were not "proud
as a peacock" about the net
work's poor showing on Mon
day nights. CBS's popular situa
tion comedies, anchored by
Nielsen winner "Murphy
Brown," consistently captured
the majority of those not watch
ing their rowdy friends Al, Dan
and the Giff with NFL games on
ABC.
NBC axed the ill-conceived
and largely ignored "Ferris
Bueller," and has opted for the
time-honored television
approach to filling its Monday
void: center a sitcom on a cute
kid.
Enter "Blossom."
Mayim Bialik, who shined as
the young Bette Midler in
"Beaches," stars in the title role
as a sharp-witted adolescent
who faces the challenges of
growing up in the '90s.
Wally and the Beaver would
surely be lost in Blossom's
world. Her parents have split up
and she lives with her father
(Joel Lawrence)
and two brothers. In passing, we
learn that Blossom's eldest
teenage brother has received
treatment for alcoholism.
The producers of "Blossom"
deserve credit for their ambi
tious try at setting their show in
a typical modern American
household. The program accu
rately reflects the situations

that many viewers experience.
Yet this attempt at realism,
while admirable, is largely
unconvincing because of melo
dramatic dialogue.
Monday's episode saw Blos
som squaring off against her
father's new girlfriend. Assum
ing her dad's romantic interest
would develop into an evil step
mother, Blossom saw her
domestic world threatened.
The premise of the show
smoothly incorporated the diffi
cult issue of how divorce affects
children with witty banter and
solid comedic writing. However,
the balance between humor and
emotion was destroyed by a
scene between Blossom and her
brother, in which they exchange
pop psychology explanations of
why their mom left them with
dad.
In such clumsily arranged
interludes, the writers of "Blos
som" seem to be striving to be
more sensitive and socially
attuned than they need to be.
Instead of pushing a moral on
their audience, "Blossom"
should accentuate the interplay
of its solid characters in its con
text of reality.
Bialik has shown real charm
and comedic timing in the
show's first two episodes. Her
conversations with her sex
crazed 15-year-old brother Joey
capture the frivolity of teenage
life. (In one moment of insight,
he assures Blossom that
"Chicks dig a rippled stomach.")
NBC has tried to help "Blos
som" blossom by stocking the
show with a cavalcade of guest
stars. Phylicia Rashad and Rhea
Perlman have appeared the last
two weeks in attempts to solid
ify this new entry.
But the best approach to
ensure that "Blossom" makes it
to the fall is for the producers to
work less at being socially
important and focus more on
the character assets that provide
the show's strengths.
