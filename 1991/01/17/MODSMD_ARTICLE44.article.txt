HURRAH FOR BUSH! I just turned 20,
and gosh, I was worried that there would
be nothing for me when I got there. Tbo
old to be a teenager, too young to drink (legally).
Tbo old to think driving, voting and NC-17
movies are cool, too young to drink (legally).
Tbo old to be young, too young to be old.
Being 20 with no ID to prove otherwise
promised to be a gloomy, pointless way station
between two of life's greatest experiences, much
like "The Empire Strikes Back."
But now, now (oh, hurrah for Bush!) we 20-
year-olds may soon have something to call our
very own. Something we can cling to and love
and kiss and squeeze and hug and cherish
always, something to always remind us and
never let us forget (ever) how gosh-darned
important we 20-year-olds really are.
. . . Anyone feel a draft?
For a while there, it seemed that the post-
Cold War world might truly be one big happy
Coca-Cola commercial. We stood proud and
saw laid out before us a kinder, gentler exploita
tive Northern Hemisphere, united at last by
world peace and harmony. A McDonald's on
every corner A Chiapet in every window sill.
And those amazing Sports Illustrated Sneaker
phones everywhere.
Alas, our visions proved short-lived. World
peace is making a fast break into world pieces.
Harmony has been torn by economic strife,
ripped apart by civil wars, bastardized by Wilson
Phillips. And Sports Illustrated replaced the
Sneakerphone with a football equivalent that
doesn't look nearly as cool.
Even at Stanford, signs of the impending war
are unmistakable. Chalk outlines make White
Plaza look like a SCAAN demonstration gone
awry. Hoover Tbwer quivers at night with the
sound of lips smacking inside. Sorority women
across campus comfort their bawling sisters
who, hearing of terrorist threats, are afraid they
may not get to go to Florence now.
How did this all happen? Let's go back, back
in time to when it all began. (Insert "Wayne's
World" dream-sequence sound effects.)
It all started back in August, when Hussein
tried to snag a little beachfront property when
no one was looking, and got caught with his
hand in the Kuwaiti jar. At first Bush, who was
on vacation, tried the mosquito-bite approach
to the problem: "Just ignore it, and maybe it'll
go away." But we all knew this method was
doomed to failure. It didn't work with the yell
leaders; it still hasn't worked with Andy Rooney.
More needed to be done.
So we consulted our new bedfellow, Soviet
Foreign Minister Shevardnadze (and when Bush
comes to Shev, anything can happen). Andy
Rooney was beyond help, he told us, but per
haps Iraq was worth some coercion. Tbgetner,
then, we tried the peaceful, UNified approach:
UN sanctions, UN resolutions, UN treaties, all
adding up to a mess of UN effective measures.
Since then, its been a slow, slim slide toward
war. Talks have broken down to the point where

nobody give Saddam Husseing what anymore.
Our troops, stuck as they are between Iraq and
a hot place, are preparing to send Bush's thou
sand points of light over enemy airspace. And
back home, the war debate rages on, between
those unßealist dreamers like me who want
peace with Iraq ("peaceniks"), and people like
Bush who want to beat Iraq (beatniks).
In the meantime, propaganda is making a
bigger comeback from the 70s than Osmond,
TVavolta and Cassidy (Cassidy?) combined.
"Propaganda" being, of course, a perfectly
silly name; the stuff is entirely impropa, and I
hardly ever care to take a ganda at it.

'... propaganda is mak
ing a bigger comeback
from the '70s than
Osmond, Travolta and
Cassidy (Cassidy?) com
bined.'

Take, for example, Bush's snippet that Hus
sein is "worse than Hitler." Hitler You remem
ber, the paranoid little German with the Chap
lin moustache who killed over 6(?) million Jews
and left all of Europe in ruins. Why the harsh
language, George? "I don't think Hitler ever vio
lated the sanctity of international embassies."
Oh, embassies. Gosh, that is worse. Glad to see
we have our values in line.
Bush comparing Hussein to Hitler may even
be a case of the putz calling the kettle black.
Imagine. Hitler prepared his troops for invading
countries; Bush prepares his troops for biologi
cal warfare. German Occupation, Germ Inocu
lation ... same difference.
Of course, the most recent piece of rhetoric
was his letter to — well, shucks — us college
students, an impressive list of variations on the
"U.S.A. . .. good, Saddam ... baad" theme.
(Fortunately, Bush has broken out of his Satur
day Night Live "noun-adjective noun-adjective"
style of speaking. Just in time to avoid the
"Tarzan goes to Washington" jabs.)
He began by describing the approaching con
flict as "black and white" and Iraq as a "dark
evil," undoubtedly drumming up oodles of sup
port from the BSU.
He continued with a poignant, touching let
ter from a man he's about to order into combat,
and stuck in a plug for his own vision of a "new
world order" That was probably his fatal mis
take. The second I hear New Order, I tune out.
Should we follow Bush and support "our
boys," or rally against their deployment?
Morale, or morality? We never had these tough
questions during tne anesthetic eighties. What
we need now is another Reagan, another

celebrity President to lead us blindly onward,
and somehow keep us unscathed. Who, among
the entertainment world today, could save us
from this threat of war and restore peace?
Not Kevin Costner. When it came to choos
ing between the hawk or dove methods for
resolving the crisis, he would undoubtedly "feel
dove dreams." Build-up, and he will go! I
wouldn't trust anyone who Dances with Wolves
to keep us out of a fight for long.
Perhaps Madonna is the better choice. Sure,
there's always the chance that she would "keep
on pushin' our troops . . . over the borderline."
But more likely, I think, she would realize just
how much the anti-war sentiment is in
"Vogue." Strike oppose!
Then again, maybe we don't even need a new
leader. Just a new perspective. Most of the deep
troubles that the nation confronts actually do
have simple solutions:
• Worried that our invasion won't be quick,
aggressive and spirited! Just have KZSU
announce Viennese Ball tickets are being sold in
Baghdad Square.
• Afraid our supply of oil is in jeopardy(
Wring out a slice of TYesidder's pepperoni pizza,
and fuel your scooter for a week.
• Concerned that throngs of protesters may
block up traffic, make people late for work, and
thus contribute to the declining performance
of our economy I Relax! No one was that upset
when Sports Illustrated made the switch.
But alas, these obvious answers are often dif
ficult to see from underneath the rocks and
underbrush that most of our politicians come
from — that's why a little Bush-whacking
always helps to clear the air.
Until that perfect solution is found, however,
we remain poised on the edge our seats, count
ing down the minutes until kickoff time. Wel
come, my friends, to 'Nam for the Nineties, and
let's hear it for the principal (ah, were it only
principle!) actors: Bush, even now condemning
the Soviet Union for killing 14 (count 'em, 14!)
civilians; Saddam, ever living up to his name
spelled backwards; Andy Rooney, still very
much alive and 'djevernoticing.
And the rest of us, the supporting cast who
can only sit tight, hope for peace, and pray that
a very large and dense meteor falls on top of
Hussein's very large and dense head very soon.
No doubt the CIA is working on the prob
lem.
