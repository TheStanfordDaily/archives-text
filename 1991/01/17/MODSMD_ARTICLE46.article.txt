# Paris puts Panther's prowl to music

### 
Paris
Devil Made Me Do It
Grade: A
The Black Panthers have a voice for
the '90s. Paris is his name, and "Devil
Made Me Do It" is his platform.
The 23-year-old rapper from San Fran
cisco, whose real name is Oscar Jackson,
Jr., scored last summer with his debut
single "Break the Grip of Shame" — a
politically charged, bass-heavy battle cry
that accumulated hours of Bay Area air
play without the benefit of an album.
In October, a second single was
released and found similar success
throughout the Bay — still without an
album.
Finally in November, an album
appeared and those in the know rushed
to their music stores to possess the
debut. Over 150,000 copies sold in just
three weeks.
Finally getting some attention beyond
the Bay, Paris is prepared to pounce on
the national listening public with his
musical version of Panther power. More
militant and more angry than even Pub
lic Enemy, Paris is sure to get plenty of
media attention — but the music merits
as much praise as the message does
press.
"Break the Grip of Shame" and the
title hit proved Paris' production talents,
in association with his DJ Mad Mike.
Frequently mixing police sirens, Panther
prowls and marching drums with rap's
usual scratching and sampling, Paris cre
ates an appropriately militaristic mood to
supplement his nard-hitting lyrical
theme.
Ironically, this most militant rap
album to date was recorded at Tbluride
Studios in Palo Alto, proving you don't
have to be from New York or L.A. to feel
the nation's racion tension. As he says in
the title song, "Keep stompin' on, I keep
stompin'/Attitude but I ain't from Comp

ton."
The 1990 graduate of UC-Davis
founded Scarface Records in 1987 with
no intention of rapping on his own. Real
izing rap's strong impact on black youth,
he started writing songs about black
empowerment for release on hi 3 own
label — until he met a rep from Tbmmy
Boy Records, who called him back a week
later to sign a recording contract.
Tbmmy Boy, the recording company
for Digital Underground and Information
Society, took a chance on Paris that has
and should continue to pay off hand
somely.

"Intro" sets the stage with
a Jaws-like bass track laid
behind news reports of the
Yuseff Hawkins killing, fol
lowed by statements of a
black activist calling for
"maximum retaliation
against all forms of racist
attack."
What follows is a total
verbal assault on:
• The racist national
power structure ("Then spit
on your flag and govern
ment/ Cuz Help the black
was a concept never meant/
Nigger please food stamps
and free cheese/ can't be the
cure for a sick disease");
• The rash of drugs pollut
ing the black community
("Young brothers just don't
realize/ cocaine's the plan
the devil derived");
• Black musicians who
candy-coat the black experi
ence, ("So flip on your Young
MC/ or Jazzy Jeff or whatever
the case be/ mindless music
for the masses makes you /
think less of the one that
hates you"); and
• The Panthers' favorite

target, the police.
A particularly poignant example
appears in "Wretched/' which attacks
those who he sees ignoring their African-
American background: "So what's your
next move black/ go to school and maybe
join a frat/ still you seem lost the mind is
brainwashed/ it can't be good cause your
mind's the course."

Paris raps that his music is "a call and
plea for unity." However you characterize
it, Paris gets his message across loud and
clear.
