# "The Hate That Hate Made"
## 
### 
June 6 and the time was 6 o'clock
Hot summer night in the city of hard knocks
Two black brothers took a walk in a south side
Could have been any brother looking for a dope ride
Seeing a white girl wasn't in the plan
But the plan had plans of its own for a brother-man
A bad case of the right place at the right time
Makes you just ask, "Why?"
I guess you suppose you laiow what a nigger do
To a'female that was meant for you
Jealous cause your girlfriend's screwing a black man
So you bust caps on an innocent bystander
But I guess we all look the same
A goddamn shame you don't know my name
Must have just been two blacks on the payback
Fit the ID for someone like me
But you see I don't think like you do
I come much sicker with the retribute
Rollin' 25 b-troop down in the parking lot
Ready, move and steady when I bust your spot
You dumb mother f—ers just don't know me
You don't control me, so leave me lonely
Step and be prone to a cap to the dome
I don't quit, I start tearing up s—
This is a Scarface set, no snakes allowed
Keep the pace, ready, set brothers rollin' out
Packing a mack-10 strapped to captain
Now who's to blame for the hate that hate made?
