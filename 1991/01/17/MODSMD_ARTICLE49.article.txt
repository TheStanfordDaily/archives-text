### 
Come See the Paradise
Dennis Quald, Elizabeth Gilliam
Grade: C+

Alan Parker's "Come See the Paradise" suffers from
the same problem that plagues Penny Marshall's
"Awakenings;" it is a drama based on historical fact
that doesn't at all ring true. Like Marshall, Parker suc
cumbs to Hollywoqtf standards and subsequently
eviscerates his story of its grit and realism.
"Paradise" tells the story of Jack McGurn (Dennis
Quaid), a militant New York union organizer who
escapes to Los Angeles in 1936 after unintentionally
setting fire to a crowded movie house. There, he falls
in love with Lily, a Japanese-American.
And tensions arise. Lily's family balks at her liai
son with the American. California state law forbids
intermarriage. Then the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor,
making matters even worse for the love-struck couple.
But "Come See the Paradise" is not just a love story.
After the 1941 bombing, thousands of Japanese-
Americans were interned in prison camps in the
United States — so the film takes a drastic turn mid
way and becomes a prison movie, complete with obli
gatory scenes of degradation and humiliation. Jack
and Lily are separated, and while Lily and her family
go to the camps, Jack becomes a political activist striv
ing for his in-laws' right to democracy as American
citizens.
Interesting points are raised but never quite
explored. For example, the fact that the Japanese-
Americans had their American rights taken away. And
the fact that they were torn between both countries as
far as their loyalties were concerned. These controver
sial issues are skirted in favor of prison camp melo
drama.
Tamlyn Tbmita is gorgeous as Lily, but her stilted
delivery of lines makes her one of the worst choices for
a leading lady. Her voice-over, which threads through
the film and ties it together, lacks any emotional reso
nance — she seems to be reading from a phone book.
Dennis Quaid has a smaller role even though he
gets star billing, but he plays Jack wholeheartedly with
his trademark swagger Tbgether, these two actors lack
the chemistry needed for an against-all-odds romance.
In fact, it is never clear why they are attracted to each

other in the first place.
Director Alan ( "Mississippi Burning") Parker
makes the dreadful mistake of inserting several early
scenes of Japanese-American girls giggling about sex.
Presumably, he uses these scenes to contradict any
previous film stereotype of Asians being shy and asex
ual. But the scenes themselves are so irrelevant and
self-consciously patronizing that they end up being
insulting. Does Parker really think he is abolishing a
stereotype by presenting a new image of Japanese-

Americans as horny peeping Toms?
Like "Awakenings," "Paradise" takes a by-the-book
approach that mimics rather than invents new ways
of telling a familiar tale. Steven Spielberg's "Empire of
the Sun" was a prison camp film filled with emotion,
great acting and powerful storytelling. "Paradise" is
almost a parody of that; the soundtrack swells in all
the right moments, the brutality of the camps is
underlined too often, and the love story is predictable.
