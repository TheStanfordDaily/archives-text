# Counselors expect rise in requests for support
## 
### Jonathan Eisenberg Editorial staff 
Campus counselors are
preparing for increased
requests for support because of
the outbreak of war yesterday.
Counseling and Psychologi
cal Services plans to initiate in
residence discussion sessions
for students today as well as
provide support for University
staff to try to educate the com
munity about the emotional
effects of the war. A special Per
sian Gulf Crisis support group
for students who have loved
ones in the Gulf may also begin
meeting today or tomorrow.
The Bridge held a special
training meeting last night for
its peer counselors, said senior
Dan Rosenberg, a live-in coun
selor. In general, counselors
will treat calls about the war
like other calls.
Both CAPS and the Bridge
have 24-hour crisis hot lines

for the Stanford community
and anticipate an increase in
phone calls. The groups
encourage people to seek sup
port from whomever makes
them feel safe and comfortable.
CAPS director Alejandro
Martinez stressed that a "wide
range" of emotional reactions
will arise over the Persian Gulf
war — and that all these reac
tions should be accepted and
expressed. Some possible reac
tions include:
• Confusion over the com
plexity of issues surrounding
the war and pressure to make
sense of them all. Martinez
said a war increases people's
struggles over their personal
views and values because it has
such life-and-death conse
quences. He reminded people
to "be accepting of their confu
sion."
• Grief over the destruction
