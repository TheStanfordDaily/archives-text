# Counselors expect rise in requests for support
## 
### Jonathan Eisenberg Editorial staff 
Campus counselors are
preparing for increased
requests for support because of
the outbreak of war yesterday.
Counseling and Psychologi
cal Services plans to initiate in
residence discussion sessions
for students today as well as
provide support for University
staff to try to educate the com
munity about the emotional
effects of the war. A special Per
sian Gulf Crisis support group
for students who have loved
ones in the Gulf may also begin
meeting today or tomorrow.
The Bridge held a special
training meeting last night for
its peer counselors, said senior
Dan Rosenberg, a live-in coun
selor. In general, counselors
will treat calls about the war
like other calls.
Both CAPS and the Bridge
have 24-hour crisis hot lines

for the Stanford community
and anticipate an increase in
phone calls. The groups
encourage people to seek sup
port from whomever makes
them feel safe and comfortable.
CAPS director Alejandro
Martinez stressed that a "wide
range" of emotional reactions
will arise over the Persian Gulf
war — and that all these reac
tions should be accepted and
expressed. Some possible reac
tions include:
• Confusion over the com
plexity of issues surrounding
the war and pressure to make
sense of them all. Martinez
said a war increases people's
struggles over their personal
views and values because it has
such life-and-death conse
quences. He reminded people
to "be accepting of their confu
sion."
• Grief over the destruction
and loss of life. Regardless of peo
ple's political opinions and intel
lectual reactions to the war, grief
affects everyone, Martinez said.
• Vulnerability about their own
future, a strange feeling for stu
dents at a time in their lives when
they feel invincible. The possibil
ity of a draft would exacerbate
related feelings of helplessness,
according to CAPS staff psychia
trist Gail Nelligan. Also, some
people may fear becoming victims
of terrorism.
• "Survivor guilt," another
common reaction among civil
ians. Students may feel guilty
"looking at the young, youthful
faces that are there, yet we are
here," Nelligan said.
Certain groups of people may
feel certain emotions more
acutely than others. According to
Nelligan, people of color — who
may have more friends and rela
tives in the Persian Gulf — may
feel more anger over the war and
correspondingly express it more.
CAPS suggests that people
gather more information on the
Persian Gulf situation in order to
have a "sense of efficacy," Mar
tinez said. "Information is
empowering," added Nelligan.
Unfortunately, the debate over
war cannot be postponed, so peo
ple will have to make some imme
diate decisions about their views
and values, Nelligan said. Of
course, "feelings aren't debat
able," she added.
For students, most of whom
have not lived through a war,

Psychological
effects students
may experience
because of the war
include confusion,
grief, vulnerability
and survivor guilt,
according to CAPS
staff.

dealing with these important and
often conflicting feelings is an
important step in their psycholog
ical development.
Martinez said that among peo
ple who have suffered traumas
such as assault and molestation,
feelings about the war may trig
ger feelings about past experi
ences.
Many people who have sought
counseling at CAPS over the past
few weeks have expressed feelings
about the war even though it was
not the original intent of their vis
its, he said.
Many members of the Stanford
community lived through the
1989 Bay Area earthquake, which
exacted a psychological toll. Some
similar emotional reactions —
such as denial and sadness — may
occur, Martinez said.
On the other hand, people may
react differently to the war than
to the quake because the war is
only being experienced "through
television" and may not seem as
real as the earthquake, Nelligan
said.
