# 'Alice' — a Woody Allen neurosis
## 
### 
Alice
Mia Farrow, William Hurt
Grade: A-
Woody Allen doesn't actually
appear in "Alice," but he may as
well have.
The title character of his lat
est movie is Woody Allen, or
what he would be anyway, were
he a Catholic woman.
Mia Farrow, in a departure
from her usual role as Woody's
sidekick, plays Alice, a mousy
but kind-hearted housewife in
search of herself. That is, the self
she used to be before she married
her husband — a handsome,
wealthy asshole deftly played by
William Hurt.
Plagued by nagging back pain
and numerous other
Woodyesque neuroses, Alice
decides to follow the advice of
several friends and visit an
acupuncturist practicing in New
York City's Chinatown. Hesi
tant by nature, Alice is particu
larly concerned about the "natu
ral herbs" (use your imagination
— no I mean really use your

imagination) that the doctor lib
erally prescribes.
Then the fun begins.
Alice, who is plagued more by
unfulfillment and guilt over her
lavish, useless lifestyle (in
response to the question "What
are you doing today?" Alice
reflected deeply and replied,
"Well, I'm going shopping . ..
then ... I'm picking the lads up
at school... no, no, I guess the
babysitter's doing that ... ")
than her back injuries, sets out
to fix her life by pursuing an
affair with the father of a child at
her kids' preschool — or at least
attempting to.
Oh, stop kvetching, I haven't
revealed anything about the plot
that you wouldn't have found
out in the first seven minutes of
the movie — and I don't intend
to.
And besides, it's not the plot
of Woody Allen's movies that
make him a cult hero, it's the
genius behind his characters.
And "Alice" is full of charac
ters. Besides the alarmingly cred
ible main characters, the film

boasts cameo appearances by
Cybill Shepard as Alice's cool,
businesslike and, well, bitchy
"friend," Alec Baldwin as a for
mer lover and Bernadette Peters
as, well vou'll have to find this
one out for yourself.
Do I recommend it? Abso
lutely. But as a fan of all things
Woody, this is not surprising.
In fact, I would recommend
you see it exactly the same way I
did, but since you aren't going to
find a New York crowd in the Bay
Area, and you sure ain't gonna
find a dinner that even vaguely
resembles the pastrami on iye
from Wolf's deli I greedily
inhaled while standing on (yes,
ON] line before the flick, you'll
just have to find some West
Coast substitute.
But if you too decide to eat a
sandwich before the movie —
please, please, out of deference to
the movie's New York heritage
— leave the sprouts off.
