# 'Sheltering Sky' falls on screen
## Bowles' haunting novel translates poorly to film 
### 
The Sheltering Sky
John Malkovlch, Debra Winger
Grade: B-
What do you do if your 10-year
marriage is crumbling from total
apathy and stagnation?
Paul Bowles' 1949 novel "The
Sheltering Sky" suggested that you
travel through the Sahara with
your spouse in hopes of escaping
the dull monotony of such a list
less union. You also engage in
casual infidelities with exotic
Third World people and eventually
plummet into madness or die.
Bernardo Bertolucci's adapta
tion of Bowles' novel is a gorgeous,
haunting odyssey that will either
profoundly affect you or put you to
sleep. At 133 minutes and contain
ing a highly unconventional plot,
"The Sheltering Sky" may seem
unbearably dull to some. But it is
nonetheless visually compelling,
thanks to cinematographer Vitto
rio Storaro, and often terrifying.
As the Moresbys trek through
the primitive wasteland of North
Africa in search of sexual liberation
(with each other as well as from

each other), they encounter
cultures and people both horrifying
and exotic. The Sahara itself is a
metaphor for the "glacial dead
ness" that has overtaken the minds
of Port and Kit.
As they move farther away from
civilization, they drift apart as a
couple and even lose their identi
ties as human beings, "Kit had no
reactions at all; her entire personal
ity withdrew from sight . .. Port
had long since come to deny all
purpose to the phenomenon of
existence."
This is heavy material, and
often it does not translate well to
the screen. Where Bowles had the
advantage of the written word to
describe the twisted torment of his
characters' minds, Bertolucci is
limited by the film medium itself.
John Malkovich and Debra Winger
are adept in their tricky, subtle
roles, but how do you describe the
psychological despair and impend
ing insanity of this couple on the
screen?
With no way to express their
thoughts, Bertolucci does his best
by creating an equally insane exte

rior world. He films the natives as
if they were otherworldly menaces,
both threatening and dangerously
erotic. The soundtrack is peppered
with piercing tribal screams and
uneven rhythms. All this con
tributes to the wild unpredictabil
ity imminent in the Sahara as well
as in the Moresby's minds. The
last 45 minutes of the film are like
"Henry & June meet the Wizard of
Oz."
Bernardo Bertolucci has tackled
erotic territory before, most
notably with "Last Tkngo in Paris."
He has also directed "The Last
Emperor," one of the most beauti
ful epics ever made. So why does he
fail, albeit admirably, with this
erotically charged existential epic?
Because Bowles' novel is virtually
impossible to convey.
A story about the inner work
ings of the mind can only be
described in words — and while
Bertolucci comes closer than anv
one else could have, he should
have foreseen the impossibilities of
lifting "The Sheltering Sky" off the
page.
