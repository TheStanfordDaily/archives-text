•Gre«n Card
Andle MacDowell, Gerard Depardleu
Grade: B-
My first and foremost reaction to "Green
Card" was, "I could have written that."
There is nothing to writer/director/pro
ducer Peter Weir's script. The only thing that
smacks of any originality is the ending,
which at least proves Weir was not com
pletely asleep at the keyboard.
So the question is, then, "Why didn't he
try a little harder on the rest of the script?"
Maybe he's been watching too much day
time TV.
But enough of the sniping. I only have a
limited space to express my ambivalence
towards Tbuchstone's latest cookie cutter
film.
Wall Street Journal-type columnists have
worried that the Japanese buyouts of
Columbia and Universal Studios will stifle
American creativity. If they saw a couple of
Tbuchstone films, they would realize that
Tbuchstone has already succeeded in pro
ducing the cinematic equivalents of Hondas
— bland, predictable entertainment with all
of the sharp edges rounded off.
Once again the plot concerns some
uptight, upper class snob falling in love with
a crude but likable, down-on-his-luck indi
vidual. This time around the snob is Bronte
(Andie MacDowell), a college-educated gar
dener who is into being a condescending,
pseudo-urban Peace Corps worker. The lov
able oaf is George (Gerard Depardieu), a
streetwise, erstwhile French composer.
George and Bronte, though they are total
strangers, marry each other. George does so
to get a green card; Bronte needs the
respectability of marriage to get a Manhattan
co-op with a built-in greenhouse. The real

fireworks begin when the "federates," a.k.a.
the Immigration and Naturalization Ser
vices, decide to investigate.
Haven't I seen this on "Love Boat" before?
Appearing in his first American film,
Depardieu has a bear-like presence. His act
ing comes off as friendly but appropriately
arrogant.
This is certainly not the case with Mac-
Dowell. Throughout the film I kept trying to
like her, but it was useless.
I realize that most of the time she is sup

posed to show disdain for Depardieu's char
acter, but she goes overboard. There never
seems to be any chemistry between the two.
On the other end of the spectrum, Bebe
Neuwirth, a.k.a. Lilith on "Cheers," is defi
nitely more appealing as Bronte's offbeat
friend Lauren.
"Green Card" is essentially "Pretty
Woman" with a French accent, a slightly
irregular ending and no sex.
