# 'Liberty' shines with dismal look at future
## 
### John Louie Editorial staff 
Five years ago, when Frank Miller
and Dave Gibbons created "Watch
men," their apocalyptic view of the
future described territorial disputes
which brought continual instability
to the entire world. In short, life was
pretty depressing.
The creative team's newest
comic book project, Dark Horse
Comics' "Give Me Liberty," focuses
on the future of America rather than
addressing international conflicts.
Unfortunately, although each page
of "Give Me Liberty" shines, Miller
and Gibbons' prophecv of future life
hasn't gotten any brighter
The scariest part of "Give Me
Liberty," a four-part prestige-format
miniseries, is its stark realism. All
of the problems which Miller and
Gibbons predict the United States
will face in 2011 are strikingly
believable, sadly enough.
Global warming has melted so
many icebergs that Manhattan is
submerged under water The Ama
zon rain forest is so severely
depleted that U.S. peace forces are
sent to defend it. America's space
program is threatened by the "Aryan
Thrust," a group of Neo-Nazi
rebels. And Apache Indians have
been confined by the federal govern

ment.
While President Nissen seeks
refuge in the bottom of his liquor
bottles, hordes of citizens disobey
martial law and march on the White
House. And one corrupt military
general plots a coup of his own. If
world events are depressing in 1991,
2011 looks much bleaker.
The story itself follows the
growth and maturity of Martha
Washington, a young black girl who
leaves the slums to join Pax~ the
nation's peace force. As Wasning
ton's adventures promote her
through the military hierarchy, she
witnesses atrocities from govern
mental corruption to environmen
tal pillaging.
Miller's tale is especially chilling
with Gibbons' crisp and definite
drawings. Gibbons' attention for
detail is reflected in panoramic pan
els as well as character shots, and
the layout of each book holds a cre
ative edge over "Watchmen."
"Give Me Liberty" is an intellec
tually enjoyable comic worth read
ing. Miller and Gibbons rely on real
ism to make their tale truly scary,
and once again, the creative pair
succeeds. If the books' view of
future American life is indeed a
prophecy, however, one hopes that
Miller and Gibbons will be far less
successful.
