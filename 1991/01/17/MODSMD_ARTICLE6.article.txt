With cars honking, drums beating and tears
streaming down faces amidst cries for peace, a
rally in front of Palo Alto City Hall Plaza last
night gave a resounding "No" to war.
The rally, organized by the Peninsula Peace
Center in Palo Alto, began at 5:30 p.m. as a
response to the opening of hostilities in the
Middle East and broke up about 10:30 p.m.
after the crowd marched through the streets
of Palo Alto.
Police had to block side streets off of El
Camino Real when protesters took to Page
Mill Road, where they sat in the intersection
for about 20 minutes, blocking traffic in all
directions. After placing candles on the ground
in the shape of a peace symbol, the crowd
began shouting, "To 101," and headed east
toward the freeway.
In sharp contrast to the violent demonstra
tions in San Francisco, the protesters in Palo
Alto were calm. One marcher stopped to put
up a fallen construction sign, and some
thanked the police for lining the streets and
keeping the rally peaceful.
Planners said they had hoped the rally
would not be necessary, but as war is now a
reality, they vowed to do all they can to press
for peace.
In all, the rally drew about 750 people from

Palo Alto and the surrounding areas. Emo
tions ran high during speeches and songs
about peace, and people were quiet only for a
few minutes when Robert Brown from a Pres
byterian Church in Palo Alto led a peace
prayer.
"Give us ... wisdom to stay the course and
not falter ... so that we can make peace not a
dream but a reality," he prayed.
Brown later said his church tries to help
conscientious objectors avoid military service.
He said he met with Stanford senior Aim6e
Allison, a member of the reserves who recently
declared herself a conscientious objector, to
offer her sanctuary.
Regardless of charges that Allison is trying
to evade the service she committed herself to,
Brown said his church is willing to assist peo
ple like her. "We want to honor the con
science," he said.
The crowd seemed resolute that violence in
the Gulf is not the best solution to the crisis.
"One, two, three, four, we don't want a desert
war. Five, six, seven, eight, why don't we nego
tiate?" the crowd chanted in unison.
Dana Davis from Menlo Park said she went
to the rally to show the U.S. government that
not all American people are behind Bush's
policies.
Jeffrey Rengifo, a 10-year-old from Palo
Alto, said he is worried about his Jewish
neighbor who is currently in the Gulf region.
He said he is "hoping for peace."

History Prof. Joel Beinin, an outspoken
critic of American intervention in the Gulf,
spoke at the rally, urging people not to stand
for "this kind of craving barbarism."
Beinin criticized the "utter bankruptcy" of
the two party system, condemning the admin
istration for committing the nation to war and
the Democrats for the "craving opportunism"
demonstrated by their inability to speak up
against the president.
The rally reached its emotional climax as
Vietnam veteran Donald Ludwig took the
microphone. "I am out here with pneumonia.
I'm willing to die with water in the lungs," he
shouted, looking considerably shaken.
"Stop this goddamn war," he kept yelling.
Junior Sherifa Edoga, a member of Stan
ford Students for Peace in the Middle East,
had tears in her eyes when she spoke to the
crowd of Martin Luther King, Jr. "He left us
the wisdom that we can never have peace
through war," she said.
Senior linguistics lecturer Khalil Barhoum
called Operation Desert Storm "the war to
protect the dirty Arab regime in the Gulf." He
condemned alleged FBI searches of homes of
Arab-Americans, saying that the war of civil
liberties has to be fought at home, not in the
Middle East.
