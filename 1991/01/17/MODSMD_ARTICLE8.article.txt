Gorbachev proposes control over media
MOSCOW (AP) — Stung by an article accusing him of leading
a "criminal regime," President Mikhail Gorbachev yesterday
tried to stifle glasnost by putting the Soviet press under legisla
tive control.
But after howls of protest from lawmakers who cited
Gorbachev's glasnost, or openness, as one of his greatest achieve
ments, the Supreme Soviet legislature agreed to a modified ver
sion of his proposal. They authorized a committee and legislative
leaders to take unspecified measures to "ensure objectivity."
Gorbachev proposed suspending the Soviet Union's press free
dom law, which curtailed state censorship and guaranteed inde
pendent newspapers and radio and television stations. His sug
gestion represented another bid by Gorbachev to shift the nation
to the right.
The press law, which took effect last year, has fostered the
growth of independent newspapers of all political viewpoints,
although central radio and television remains under state control.
The military assault in Lithuania has thrust the debate over
objectivity in the media — especially television — into the open.
Boris Yeltsin, the president of the Russian republic and
Gorbachev's main political rival, said Monday that independent
newspapers and television producers who have tried to provide
honest coverage of the Baltics "are simply being shut down."
Device Jielps prevent strokes in kids
SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) — A machine that measures the dan
gerous narrowing of arteries in the brain could help prevent crip
pling strokes in children who suffer from sickle cell anemia, the
device's developer said.
The machine, a new kind of ultrasound imager, identifies those
most at risk for a stroke, said Dr. Robert Adams of the Medical
College of Georgia in Augusta. Once doctors identify high-risk
patients, they can work to keep them healthy, he said.
Until now, he said, doctors have had no way of identifying
ahead of time the estimated 7 percent of children with sickle cell
anemia who are at risk for paralyzing strokes. Sickle cell anemia
is one of the most serious inherited diseases among black
Americans. It occurs in about one in 400 black infants, Adams
said.
