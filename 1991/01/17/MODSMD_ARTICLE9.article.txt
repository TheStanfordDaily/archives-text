WASHINGTON (AP) - U.S.
air assaults on Iraq marked the
start of what Pentagon officials
said would be a long series of
American and allied bombard
ments designed to break the back
of Iraq's military machine and its
will to fight.
"We're not stopping; this is
continuing," one military official
said.
Indeed, U.S.-led forces
launched a second wave of air
attacks on Iraq this morning from
bases around the Persian Gulf
region, said a Western military
officer in Manama, Bahrain.
The officer, who spoke on con
dition of anonymity, said jets from
the U.S. Air Force and the British
Royal Air Force left air bases after
8 a.m. local time (midnight
Wednesday EST).
Some officials privately
expressed surprise that Iraq posed
little or no initial resistance to the
bombardments of Baghdad and
targets elsewhere in Iraq and
Kuwait.
One source, who like most
other Pentagon officials would
speak today only on condition of
anonymity, said Iraq apparently
had not launched any of its Soviet
made Scud ballistic missiles,
which may be armed with chemi
cal warheads.
One source said the comman
ders of Operation Desert Storm
planned to step up the pace of
aerial bombardments unless Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein sud
denly ended his refusal to with
draw from Kuwait as demanded

by the United Nations Security
Council.
Pentagon officials said at least
1,300 American sorties would be
flown in the first 24 hours of the
war, which Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney said began at 7 p.m.

EST Wednesday (3 a.m. Thursday,
Baghdad time) with a massive,
U.S.-coordinated aerial strike.
Television newscasts showed fir
ing from Iraqi antiaircraft batter
ies at about 6:35 p.m.
Bush said initial reports from

the commander of American
forces in the region, Army Gen. H.
Norman Schwarzkopf, were that
the assault was going according to
plan. The president said targets
included Iraqi chemical and
nuclear weapons facilities.
