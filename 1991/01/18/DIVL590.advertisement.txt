Architecture:
The Summer Studio
at Columbia University
New York
A summer program giving university credit which intro
duces the student to all aspects of the design, history, theo
ry, and practice of architecture The program is intended
both for those without previous academic experience in
design who are interested in architecture as a potential
career, and for those with previous experience in architec
tural design who would like to develop studio design skills,
perhaps in preparation for application to graduate school.
Studio, seminar, and lectures present a comprehensive
introduction to every aspect of architecture as it is
practiced today. In addition, through field-trips and
tours, the student learns from extraordinary examples
of architectural and urban design in New York City, the
world's preeminent center for architecture and culture.
