# IRAQ ATTACKS ISRAEL

CENTRAL SAUDI ARABIA
(AP) — Iraq struck back early Fri
day against a non-stop hammer
ing by American warplanes the
way it said it would — by lobbing
missiles into Israel and Saudi Ara
bia.
The early-morning attack on
the Jewish state left at least 10
people with minor injuries,
according to Israeli officials, and
threatened to turn the Persian
Gulf war into a wider Mideast
conflict.
Israeli Chief of Staff Dan
Shomron said the bombing was
"very serious," and it "obliges a
response." But there was no
immediate word of any Israeli
retaliation. President Bush
expressed outrage at the attack.
At least eight missiles were
aimed at Israel and five landed
near Tel Aviv and elsewhere at
about 2 a.m. Friday, all of them
Scuds launched from western
Iraq, Israeli and U.S. officials said.
The Scud is Iraq's deadliest
ground-to-ground missile; it can
carry chemical warheads, but
none of those that hit Israel was
so armed, according to the Israeli
army.
Another Scud was fired at
Dhahran, site of a msgor military
air base in eastern Saudi Arabia,

Pentagon officials said in Wash
ington.
According to an official Saudi
statement, the missile did not
bear a chemical warhead. It was
fired from the southern Iraqi city
of Basra, was monitored by allied
military and destroyed at 17,000
feet by a U.S. Patriot interceptor
missile.
Iraqi radio did not make any
report of the missile firings.
The Baghdad government had
said it would strike Israel if Iraq
was attacked, as it was early
Thursday, by the U.S.-led coalition
massed in Saudi Arabia. Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein's
strategy: to draw Israel into the
war and possibly drive Syria and
other Arab states out of the U.S.
alliance.
The U.S. command, after long
hours of bombardment of Iraqi
targets, expressed satisfaction
with the air offensive by American

and allied planes. But the war
planes were running into
inevitable problems.
Bad weather frustrated some
strikes, and pilots said anti-air
craft fire was intense. "The
kitchen sink was coming up
through the clouds," said one
American flyer.
The U.S. warplanes' failure to
knock out mobile Scud launchers
made the missile attack on Israel
possible, said Sen. Sam Nunn, D-
Ga. "We knew we hadn't hit
those," the Senate Armed Ser
vices Committee chairman said.
On the ground, allied tanks and
troops were reported rumbling
north toward the Kuwait border
and a possible desert showdown
with the dug-in Iraqi forces in the
occupied emirate.
