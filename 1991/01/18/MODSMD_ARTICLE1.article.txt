# IRAQ ATTACKS ISRAEL
## 
### 
CENTRAL SAUDI ARABIA
(AP) — Iraq struck back early Fri
day against a non-stop hammer
ing by American warplanes the
way it said it would — by lobbing
missiles into Israel and Saudi Ara
bia.
The early-morning attack on
the Jewish state left at least 10
people with minor injuries,
according to Israeli officials, and
threatened to turn the Persian
Gulf war into a wider Mideast
conflict.
Israeli Chief of Staff Dan
Shomron said the bombing was
"very serious," and it "obliges a
response." But there was no
immediate word of any Israeli
retaliation. President Bush
expressed outrage at the attack.
At least eight missiles were
aimed at Israel and five landed
near Tel Aviv and elsewhere at
about 2 a.m. Friday, all of them
Scuds launched from western
Iraq, Israeli and U.S. officials said.
The Scud is Iraq's deadliest
ground-to-ground missile; it can
carry chemical warheads, but
none of those that hit Israel was
so armed, according to the Israeli
army.
Another Scud was fired at
Dhahran, site of a msgor military
air base in eastern Saudi Arabia,

Pentagon officials said in Wash
ington.
According to an official Saudi
statement, the missile did not
bear a chemical warhead. It was
fired from the southern Iraqi city
of Basra, was monitored by allied
military and destroyed at 17,000
feet by a U.S. Patriot interceptor
missile.
Iraqi radio did not make any
report of the missile firings.
The Baghdad government had
said it would strike Israel if Iraq
was attacked, as it was early
Thursday, by the U.S.-led coalition
massed in Saudi Arabia. Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein's
strategy: to draw Israel into the
war and possibly drive Syria and
other Arab states out of the U.S.
alliance.
The U.S. command, after long
hours of bombardment of Iraqi
targets, expressed satisfaction
with the air offensive by American

and allied planes. But the war
planes were running into
inevitable problems.
Bad weather frustrated some
strikes, and pilots said anti-air
craft fire was intense. "The
kitchen sink was coming up
through the clouds," said one
American flyer.
The U.S. warplanes' failure to
knock out mobile Scud launchers
made the missile attack on Israel
possible, said Sen. Sam Nunn, D-
Ga. "We knew we hadn't hit
those," the Senate Armed Ser
vices Committee chairman said.
On the ground, allied tanks and
troops were reported rumbling
north toward the Kuwait border
and a possible desert showdown
with the dug-in Iraqi forces in the
occupied emirate.

mation about ground operations,
and no news reports were coming
in from the front lines.
But Gen. Colin Powell, joint
chiefs chairman, emphasized that
the air offensive would be "just
one part of the total campaign."
The Air Force's mighty B-62Gs
were reported carpet-bombing
Kuwait to soften up Iraqi army
positions. One top military source
told The Associated Press that
Bush was in no rush to start a
ground offensive.
Saddam sounded unafraid of
an American armor-infantry
assault.

"If you believe that the (Iraqi)
ground forces can be neutralized,
then you are deluding yourself,"
the Iraqi president declared in a
statement directed at Bush and
read on state radio.
In the first Iraqi radio report
on casualties, a military
spokesman said 23 civilians were
killed and 66 wounded through
out Iraq in the early air attacks of
"Operation Desert Storm." There
was no report on military casual
ties.
In the Iraqi capital of Baghdad,
CNN reporters said air raid sirens
were wailing anew late Thursday
afternoon. Their reports were
then cut off by Iraqi authorities

but allowed to resume early Fri
day.
Iraq claimed the air strikes hit
densely populated districts of the
ancient riverside city of 4 million
people. Reporters said they found
little such damage in central
Baghdad, but a British broadcast
correspondent reported seeing a
civilian building whose top two
floors had been destroyed.
A Canadian Press correspon
dent said the Iraqi Defense Min
istry was a "smoking pile of rub
ble" and the main communica
tions tower outside Baghdad was
"decapitated." Another corre
spondent said missiles hit the area
of Saddam's presidential palace

Thursday night.
Two loyalist Kuwaiti doctors
still in the emirate got word out
that a 500-bed hospital there was
overwhelmed with Iraqi casual
ties, said an exiled Kuwaiti state
minister, Abdul Rahman al-
Awadi.
American and allied officials
said one U.S., two British and one
Kuwaiti plane were downed in the
air assaults. Various Iraqi claims
said as many as 76 attacking war
planes were shot down, but U.S.
officials dismissed that as
wartime exaggeration.
The pilot of the U.S. plane, the
first reported American casualty
in the Persian Gulf war, was Lt.

Cmdr. Michael S. Speicher, 33,
stationed at Mayport, Fla., the
Pentagon said Thursday.
Speicher's FA18 fighter
bomber, based on the carrier USS
Saratoga, was downed by an Iraqi
surface-to-air missile over Iraqi
territory. Officials said he was
killed.
Early Friday, CBS, ABC and
CNN reported that a second
American plane had been shot
down. Defense Department and
Navy spokesmen said they had no
information on the report.
In the United States, anti-war
demonstrations flared again
Thursday coast- to-coast.

Activists massed at federal build
ings and scuffled with police as
they protested President Bush's
decision to wage war.
In Germany, Italy and India,
authorities reported bombings or
other attacks on facilities linked
to the U.S. government or U.S.
companies.
In the Arabian desert, wave
after thundering wave of U.S. Air
Force jets streaked north all day
to deal systematic punishment to
Iraqi troops, command centers
and other strategic sites in Kuwait
and Iraq.
But Powell warned that Iraq's
air force "is still out there."

American and allied officials
said one U.S., two British and one
Kuwaiti plane were downed in the
air assaults. Various Iraqi claims
said as many as 76 attacking war
planes were shot down, but U.S.
officials dismissed that as
wartime exaggeration.
The pilot of the U.S. plane, the
first reported American casualty
in the Persian Gulf war, was Lt.

Cmdr. Michael S. Speicher, 33,
stationed at Mayport, Fla., the
Pentagon said Thursday.
Speicher's FA18 fighter
bomber, based on the carrier USS
Saratoga, was downed by an Iraqi
surface-to-air missile over Iraqi
territory. Officials said he was
killed.
Early Friday, CBS, ABC and
CNN reported that a second
American plane had been shot
down. Defense Department and
Navy spokesmen said they had no
information on the report.
In the United States, anti-war
demonstrations flared again
Thursday coast- to-coast.

In Germany, Italy and India,
authorities reported bombings or
other attacks on facilities linked
to the U.S. government or U.S.
companies.
In the Arabian desert, wave

CENTRAL SAUDI ARABIA
(AP) — Iraq struck back early Fri
day against a non-stop hammer
ing by American warplanes the
way it said it would — by lobbing
missiles into Israel and Saudi Ara
bia.
The early-morning attack on
the Jewish state left at least 10
people with minor injuries,
according to Israeli officials, and
threatened to turn the Persian
Gulf war into a wider Mideast
conflict.
Israeli Chief of Staff Dan
Shomron said the bombing was
"very serious," and it "obliges a
response." But there was no
immediate word of any Israeli
retaliation. President Bush
expressed outrage at the attack.
At least eight missiles were
aimed at Israel and five landed
near Tel Aviv and elsewhere at
about 2 a.m. Friday, all of them
Scuds launched from western
Iraq, Israeli and U.S. officials said.
The Scud is Iraq's deadliest
ground-to-ground missile; it can
carry chemical warheads, but
none of those that hit Israel was
so armed, according to the Israeli
army.
Another Scud was fired at
Dhahran, site of a msgor military
air base in eastern Saudi Arabia,

Pentagon officials said in Wash
ington.
According to an official Saudi
statement, the missile did not
bear a chemical warhead. It was
fired from the southern Iraqi city
of Basra, was monitored by allied
military and destroyed at 17,000
feet by a U.S. Patriot interceptor
missile.
Iraqi radio did not make any
report of the missile firings.
The Baghdad government had
said it would strike Israel if Iraq
was attacked, as it was early
Thursday, by the U.S.-led coalition
massed in Saudi Arabia. Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein's
strategy: to draw Israel into the
war and possibly drive Syria and
other Arab states out of the U.S.
alliance.
The U.S. command, after long
hours of bombardment of Iraqi
targets, expressed satisfaction
with the air offensive by American

and allied planes. But the war
planes were running into
inevitable problems.
Bad weather frustrated some
strikes, and pilots said anti-air
craft fire was intense. "The
kitchen sink was coming up
through the clouds," said one
American flyer.
The U.S. warplanes' failure to
knock out mobile Scud launchers
made the missile attack on Israel
possible, said Sen. Sam Nunn, D-
Ga. "We knew we hadn't hit
those," the Senate Armed Ser
vices Committee chairman said.
On the ground, allied tanks and
troops were reported rumbling
north toward the Kuwait border
and a possible desert showdown
with the dug-in Iraqi forces in the
occupied emirate.

and no news reports were coming
in from the front lines.
But Gen. Colin Powell, joint
chiefs chairman, emphasized that
the air offensive would be "just
one part of the total campaign."
The Air Force's mighty B-62Gs
were reported carpet-bombing
Kuwait to soften up Iraqi army
positions. One top military source
told The Associated Press that
Bush was in no rush to start a
ground offensive.
Saddam sounded unafraid of
an American armor-infantry
assault.

"If you believe that the (Iraqi)
ground forces can be neutralized,
then you are deluding yourself,"
the Iraqi president declared in a
statement directed at Bush and
read on state radio.
In the first Iraqi radio report
on casualties, a military
spokesman said 23 civilians were
killed and 66 wounded through
out Iraq in the early air attacks of
"Operation Desert Storm." There
was no report on military casual
ties.
In the Iraqi capital of Baghdad,
CNN reporters said air raid sirens
were wailing anew late Thursday
afternoon. Their reports were
then cut off by Iraqi authorities

but allowed to resume early Fri
day.
Iraq claimed the air strikes hit
densely populated districts of the
ancient riverside city of 4 million
people. Reporters said they found
little such damage in central
Baghdad, but a British broadcast
correspondent reported seeing a
civilian building whose top two
floors had been destroyed.
A Canadian Press correspon
dent said the Iraqi Defense Min
istry was a "smoking pile of rub
ble" and the main communica
tions tower outside Baghdad was
"decapitated." Another corre
spondent said missiles hit the area
of Saddam's presidential palace

Thursday night.
Two loyalist Kuwaiti doctors
still in the emirate got word out
that a 500-bed hospital there was
overwhelmed with Iraqi casual
ties, said an exiled Kuwaiti state
minister, Abdul Rahman al-
