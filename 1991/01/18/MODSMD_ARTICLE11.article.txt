# Missiles and media warfare:
## Once around the battlefield 
### 
The war against Iraq is witnessing the success of
technology manifested in weapons, but not all is
optimistic as reports of terrorism reach the homes of
Americans, and violent protests begin to break out
throughout the country.
Also on the home front is another war being
waged — a media war for the best coverage of the
ongoing crisis. As this is being played out, Saddam's
son bids his father farewell and goes off to war.
Interception!
An Iraqi Scud short-range missile was fired at
Dhahran in eastern Saudi Arabia and was knocked
down by a U.S. Army Patriot surface-to-air missile,
the Pentagon said yesterday.
It was the first time a Patriot missile has been
fired in combat.
Pete Williams, spokesperson for Defense Secre
tary Dick Cheney, said a single Iraqi Scud was inter
cepted by the Patriot before it reached the ground.
He provided no other details.
The Patriot is a 17-foot, 2,100-pound missile that
homes in on a radar beam to reach its targets.
It took 15 years to develop the Patriot after work
was begun in 1965, but since 1980 the Army has
deployed thousands of it to protect airfields and
other important points against an enemy's tactical
missiles.
Terrorist activities reported
Authorities reported yesterday attacks on facili
ties in Germany, India and Italy following the bomb
ing of Iraq. The U.S. military closed its schools in
Germany and intense security measures were in
force at airports and other places thought likely tar
gets of Iraq-inspired reprisals.
In the northern German city of Kiel, attackers
yesterday smashed the windows of the "Kennedy-
Haus" American culture center.
Police in Bonn said they suspected arsonists were
behind a large blaze in a U.S.-owned Woolworth
store. Two other fires of suspicious origin broke out
last night in suburban Bonn's diplomatic commu
nity, police said.
In New Delhi, police said a bomb exploded in a
travel office that had an American Airlines sign
attached outside. The attack on the office, which was
closed, occurredl4 hours after the United States and
its allies launched attacks on Iraqi targets.
In Washington, Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah said ter
rorists had made at least four attacks on American
installations abroad since the bombing began.
No iryuries were reported.
Saddam's son off to war
Saddam Hussein's eldest son said in a letter writ
ten to his father before leaving for the front that like
Saddam, he would not hesitate to make any sacrifice
for his homeland, Iraqi radio said yesterday.
The radio, monitored in London and Nicosia, said
Odai Hussein, 27, wrote the letter on Jan. 15, the
U.N. deadline day for Iraq to leave Kuwait.
"I am writing to you as I leave for southern Iraq,
where the lions and brave men of Iraq are stationed
to counter the tyrants," Odai reportedly wrote in the
letter. "I would like to have seen or met you before
leaving. However, I hope that I will return and see
you in perfect health.
"Since my childhood, I have seen you as the lofty
mountain and the ever glittering banner. I will be
there, where I will endeavor to obtain God's blessing,
repay the homeland's debt and seek competition and
cooperation among brave men."
Odai was jailed by his father in October 1988 on
charges of killing one of Saddam's presidential body
guards, Kamel Hana Gego, in a quarrel. Saddam said
his son hit the guard with a wooden bat when the
guard refused to stop firing a gun in the air during a
party.
Saddam said at the time his son tried to commit
suicide after he learned of the guard's death and
twice more in jail before he was released in February
1990. Sources in Nicosia described Odai, an engineer
by training, as a playboy who drove a Porsche sports
car and frequented Baghdad nightclubs and dis-

cotheques.
"Like father like son," Odai reportedly wrote.
"This is a family that does not hesitate to make any
sacrifices for the land, even their children and souls.
"My sincerest regards to you, my father. I pray
that God will preserve you for us as a family and for
our people in general."
The radio said the letter ended with quotations
from the Koran.
Bush's speech makes TV history
President Bush's nationally televised speech
announcing war with Iraq was watched by more
Americans than any broadcast in TV history, with
the exception of John F. Kennedy's 1963 funeral,
preliminary ratings showed yesterday.
The president's Wednesday 9 p.m. EST address
was watched in 78.8 percent of U.S. television
homes, according to 25-city overnight ratings
released by the A.C. Nielsen Co. The figures repre
sent about half the nation's 93.1 million television
households.
The full national ratings, available today, were
expected to exceed the preliminary estimates and
probably make Bush's speech the most-watched
event ever broadcast on television, said CBS ratings
expert David Poltrack.
About 80 percent of U.S. television homes tuned
in to the Kennedy funeral broadcasts, Poltrack said.
The figures don't include independent television
stations across the country that also carried the
president's wartime remarks, Poltrack said.
"We don't really know how many people were
watching," he said.
Of the three broadcast networks' continuous war
coverage, ABC was by far No. 1, with a 19.5 average
rating in prime-time Wednesday. NBC was second
with a 15.1, and CBS third with an 11.3.
CNN, whose correspondents in Baghdad provided
the last live reports from that city before Iraqi offi
cials cut their phone link, beat its own prime-time
ratings record.

ABC scores video coup
Just as things seemed momentarily calm, U.S.
viewers saw a high-voltage jolt of war coverage last
night with reports of the missile attack in Israel.
Three hours later, ABC scored a video coup by
showing the first footage of the spectacular barrage
of Iraqi anti-aircraft fire aimed at the first U.S.-led
warplane attack on Baghdad.
ABC spokesman Arnot Walker said the footage,
shot with a night vision device that painted the sky
and city in a luminous green, was taken by a camera
man with Britain's Independent Television Net
work, with which ABC has an agreement.
The pictures showed tracer bullets that looked
like streams of deadly green pearls streaking up into
the pre-dawn sky.
