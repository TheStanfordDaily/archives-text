# With help, war jargon not hard to digest
## 
### 
Here are some of the exotic military and geo
graphic terms, code names and slang words being
used in reports from the Persian Gulf:
• AW ACS — Airborne warning and control sys
tem. A jet that monitors air space with its big exter
nal radar dome and guides fighters and bombers to
their targets. It can stay in the air for more than 11
hours.
• Collateral Damage — Military jargon for civilian
losses.
• Chaf — Metal foil dispensed by warplanes to
confuse enemy radar.
• Frogfoot — Iraq has about 60 of these SU-25
attack planes (range 470-780 miles) similar to the at
least 100 American A-10 Thunderbolts deployed by
the Allies.
• Fur Ball — Military pilot slang for the hectic
tangle of air-to-air dogfights.
• Golden BB — Soviet doctrine the Iraqis are said
to be emulating in their air defense efforts: if enough
bullets and other projectiles fill the sky during an air
raid, at least a few are bound to hit the target.
• LANTIRN — Low altitude navigation and tar
geting infrared night. One model of the F-16 fighter,
called the "Night Falcon" for its advanced night-fly
ing capability, has "pods" underneath which hold
LANTIRN systems.
• Mort themselves out — Jet fighter pilot slang for
planes shooting one another accidentally. The term
fratricide is also used.
• Scud — Soviet-made surface to surface ballistic
missile. There are three Iraqi versions that can carry
explosive or chemical warheads to targets 360 to
1,200 miles away.
• Sebkha — An Arab word for underground river.
Sebkhas that turn the ground into quagmires impos
sible to cross with tanks lie near the Saudi border
and south of Kuwait City.
• Sortie — One mission by a single military plane.
• Tomahawk — Unmanned, rocket-launched, jet
propelled (also termed "air breathing") cruise mis
sile fired from ships or submarines. The cruise mis
sile can also be launched from B-52 bombers. It can
hug the ground and is guided to a preprogrammed
target 500 miles away by an onboard computer.
• TOW — Acronym for tube-launched, optically
tracked, wire-guided missile.
• Wadi — An Arab word for dry ravine or valley. A
wadi runs all along the Kuwait border, and Iraqis
have set up a defense line behind it.
• Wild Weasel — The F-4G fighter whose main
mission is electronic countermeasures that can
knock out or suppress enemy radar installations.
The allies have two dozen of these jets.
