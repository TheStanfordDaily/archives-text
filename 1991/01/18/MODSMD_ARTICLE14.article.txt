VILNIUS, U.S.S.R. (AP) - The Kremlin
promised yesterday not to seize the Lithuanian
parliament building, but wary Baltic residents
said they feared a crackdown while the world
watches the Persian Gulf war.
In Paris, the European Community threat
ened to cut off all Soviet aid, including emer
gency food supplies, if Moscow continues its
hard-line tactics with the Baltic republics.
Both Lithuania's Baltic neighbors, Latvia
and Estonia, were reported calm yesterday.
The official Tass news agency said the Soviet
military and Estonian officials had reached
agreement on the contentious issue of con
scripting Estonian youths into military ser
vice.
The Baltic republics were independent
states between the two world wars, but the
Soviets forceably annexed them in 1940. They
are now seeking independence, though
Lithuania has been far bolder than Estonia or

Latvia.
The Kremlin has used an economic embar
go, as well as seizure of key buildings, in
attempt to bring Lithuania under control.
Mty. Gen. Yuri Nauman, a representative of
the Soviet Defense Ministry, said at a news
conference yesterday in Vilnius that soldiers
would not try to take over the Lithuanian par
liament building, headquarters of the govern
ment that declared independence in March.
A military attack on the republic's broad
casting center early Sunday left 14 people
dead. Since the attack, Lithuanians have built

concrete barricades around parliament and
dug an anti-tank trench behind it.
"I think the Supreme Soviet of Lithuania
has put up such fences and trenches that we
simply have no desire to appear there,"
Nauman said. "Such an action will not be
taken. It's simply not needed by the militaiy."
He said the legislature could function "as
long as the Lithuanian people consider it nec
essary."
Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis
also met with envoy Georgy Tarazevich, sent
by President Mikhail Gorbachev, for about 2
1/2 hours.
"It seems that Mr. Tarazevich understands
the situation in Lithuania, and he promises his
assistance in trying to communicate with the
military," Landsbergis said in comments dis
tributed by the legislature's Bureau of
Information.
