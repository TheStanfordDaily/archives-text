## The 						waiting ends 
### 
IT HAS BEEN A WEEK of
extraordinary emotion; a week
of flowing tears, angry chants,
silent prayers and sorrowful reflec
tions.
When the waiting ended and
war began Wednesday afternoon,
few were caught by surprise. The
failed efforts of world diplomats,
the unflinching rhetoric of George
Bush and Saddam Hussein, the
"countdown to confrontation" on
the nightly news all thoroughly
prepared us for such a turn of
events.
Or, nearly thoroughly.
We weren't, it seems, so pre
pared that we knew just how to
react when war came. True, some
people went out into the streets to
protest. But for most of us, the ini
tial reaction was one of uncer
tainty, of feeling on the edge of
both a momentous world event and
a great tragedy in the making.
We wore grim faces and won
dered what would happen next. We
tried to feel something, but found
that we were faced with something
perhaps a little too unreal, a little
too overwhelming.
The war these past two days has
been particularly stressful because
reliable information about events
in the Gulf has often been slow in
coming — and the breathless spec
ulation of reporters has often
proven wrong.
In addition, the war is "live" —
on television, in our homes, in
front of our faces. Ironically, it is
television, that normally numbing
medium, that has helped us to feel
more than nearly anything else .
For many of us at The Daily, per
haps no moment was more
wrenching than watching the Iraqi
missile attack on Israel unfold on
television yesterday afternoon.
Watching reporters groping in the
dark to put on gas masks as air
raid sirens wailed in the distance.
Watching a live shot of a deserted

marketplace in Tel Aviv, waiting
for the missiles to, horribly, appear
out of the dark and destroy the
scene.
At home, some events are
almost equally distressing. The
Wednesday night "peace" march in
San Francisco was marred by van
dalism and destruction, including
the torching of a police car the
explosion of which caused a serious
injury. The marchers, if anyone,
surely know that our world is being
scarred by too much violence
already.
At Stanford, the approach has
been more appropriate. Yesterday's
gathering in the Quad achieved the
right blend of unity and solemnity,
and campus leaders have moved
quickly to organize support ser
vices without introducing divisive
issues of "why we're in the Gulf"
vs. "why we should get out."
The days ahead promise to be
full of more wrenching emotion, of
more uncertainty, for people
around the world and here in the
Stanford community.
For the duration, The Daily will
continue to fulfill its basic mission
of reporting the news to its read
ers. All of us at The Daily have our
own beliefs about what courses of
action are right and wrong in the
Middle East, and we all have our
own inherent biases about the role
the United States should play in
solving international conflicts.
At the same time, however, we
hold the belief that accurate, fairly
presented news is the most valu
able contribution we can make to
our community; the belief that, in
a time of uncertainty and fear, the
best remedy is understanding.
So, two days into the Gulf war,
that is our pledge to the Stanford
community — a community that,
despite its disparate elements and
polarized beliefs about the war, is
ultimately united by the hope that
peace will soon be restored in that
troubled part of our world.
