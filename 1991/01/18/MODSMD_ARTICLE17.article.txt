Recent arguments against U.S. intervention are invalid

IN THE LAST THREE DAYS, The
Daily has carried an enormous
amount of sophistry, and numerous
half-truths and distortion. To its credit,
little of this emanates from The Daily
itself. Columnists and letter writers are
mostly to blame.
For example, Allan King argues that
the situation in Kuwait is the direct
result of U.S. policy (Daily, Jan. 16). No
kidding. However, he gets mainly worked
up over the claims in a previous letter
that surely the Kuwaitis are worse off
under Saddam than before.
King correctly points out that a mcyor
ity of the inhabitants of old Kuwait were
not Kuwaiti citizens and did not have all
the privileges and benefits of what King
calls the "elite." And so King says that
there is "good reason to believe" that
most of the inhabitants of Kuwait will be
better off under Saddam than under the
old Kuwaiti leadership.
What an obscene joke. Most of the
inhabitants of Kuwait were foreign
nationals, largely from South Asia, who
were there on multi-year work contracts.
While they by no means lived the luxu
rious lives of Kuwaiti citizens, their pay
and living conditions were far better than
they could have otherwise expected.

Of course, since they were not citizens,
the contract workers had no political
rights within Kuwait. Neither do non-cit
izens in any other country.
So what happened to these people
when Saddam invaded? First they lost
their savings when Saddam looted the
Kuwaiti banks. Then they lost their jobs,
since Saddam needs jobs for his own peo
ple. Then they damn near starved waiting
to be evacuated, since Iraq regarded their
basic needs as very low priority items.
Finally, as they embarked upon the
ships and planes to the Indian subconti
nent, the Iraqis systematically stripped
them of everything of worth, such as cur
rency, watches and radios, leaving them
with little more than the clothes on their
backs.
Now they are mostly back home, both
them and their countries far poorer for
the experience. Boy, I guess that invasion
was a real bonus for the mtgority of the
inhabitants of Kuwait.
Let us move on to Jason Lewis's col
umn of Jan. 15. Lewis thinks so little of
the current Bush policy that he compares
it unfavorably with that of the current
Indonesian regime. I yield to no one in my
distrust of our president, but Lewis is
way over the top.

The current Indonesian leadership got
there after a 1960s coup that resulted in
the deaths of hundreds of thousands of
ethnic Chinese within Indonesia. Of
course, many of these were communist
guerrillas bent on taking over the country
themselves.
But that doesn't change the fact that
Bush isn't even within the same league as
the Indonesian generals, who continue
their bloody ways in Timor, Aceh, and
against the primitive and defenseless
stone-age peoples of Iryan Jaya.
Furthermore, Lewis compares the reg
istration of Iraqi citizens within the
United States with the internment of
American citizens of Japanese descent
during World War II. Keeping tabs on the
citizens of a hostile nation within our
country is nothing but simple prudence.
Persecuting American citizens of Iraqi
descent, on the other hand, would be a
clear violation of civil rights, but that has
not happened.
Then there is the little statement that
Bush's "macho" stand of no compromises
is "irrational." On the contrary, it is one
of the very few things that George Bush
got right.
Suppose for a moment that someone
kicked Lewis out of his house, beat him

up, drained his bank accounts and for
good measure, raped his close female rel
atives and maybe Lewis himself. Then
this person wanted to "compromise" with
Lewis.
Would Lewis want to compromise?
Like hell he would. At the very least he
would want his house back, plus he'd
want the perpetrator to be severely pun
ished. What is more, a fair fraction of the
rest of us (myself included) would be very
insistent that Lewis get his justice.
What is there to compromise over? A
small inoffensive country is brutally
invaded, utterly without provocation, by
one of the nastiest dictators since World
War II.
It is indeed unfortunate that we are
the only party in the world (it seems) with
the resources and the resolve to set this
situation right. But we can either deal
with Saddam now or with a substantially
stronger Saddam later.
As you might expect, I would really like
to see a piece that argued in good and sen
sible terms for the withdrawal of Ameri
can forces from the Middle East. So far all
I see is cant. As the bombs drop on Bagh
dad we need a lot better than that.

Then there is the little statement that
Bush's "macho" stand of no compromises
is "irrational." On the contrary, it is one
of the very few things that George Bush
got right.
Suppose for a moment that someone
kicked Lewis out of his house, beat him

up, drained his bank accounts and for
good measure, raped his close female rel
atives and maybe Lewis himself. Then
this person wanted to "compromise" with
Lewis.
Would Lewis want to compromise?
Like hell he would. At the very least he
would want his house back, plus he'd
want the perpetrator to be severely pun
ished. What is more, a fair fraction of the
rest of us (myself included) would be very
insistent that Lewis get his justice.
What is there to compromise over? A
small inoffensive country is brutally
invaded, utterly without provocation, by
one of the nastiest dictators since World
War II.
It is indeed unfortunate that we are
the only party in the world (it seems) with
the resources and the resolve to set this
situation right. But we can either deal
with Saddam now or with a substantially
stronger Saddam later.
As you might expect, I would really like
to see a piece that argued in good and sen
sible terms for the withdrawal of Ameri
can forces from the Middle East. So far all
I see is cant. As the bombs drop on Bagh
dad we need a lot better than that.
