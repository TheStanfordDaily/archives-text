# ASSU reading of constitution harms students' rights
## 
### 
We would like to respond to the letter
from the Council of Presidents and cer
tain members of the ASSU Senate who
oppose a bill which would restrict them
to legislating solely on campus issues
(Daily, Jan. 10).
The letter claims that our student
representatives were "obviously entrust-

ed" with making "judgment calls" on
complex and controversial issues on and
off campus.
We're afraid that much of the student
body, especially those who vote regularly
for local, state and national representa
tives, will find this claim surprising at
best, irresponsible at worst.
The letter asserts that the ASSU
Constitution, in giving the Association
the status of "sole representative of the
sntiie dtudent body" and "final represen
tative authority," gives the Association
that authority without discretion over
every aspect of eveiy student's individual
political life.

We're afraid that many will And this
assertion belittling at best, totalitarian al
worst. The letter implies that whereas
the U.S. Constitution reserves all rights
not delegated to state and national
authorities to the people, the ASSU
Constitution reserves (or usurps) the
right of representative speech to itself to
the detriment of its people.
We're afraid we find this implication
confused at best, frightening at worst. A
true academic body, as the Stanford stu
dent body is, knows that complex and
conflicting voices are indispensable to
generating solutions to problems.
We find it a true shame, a shame in

the most essential sense of the word,
it that these ASSU senators are more
interested in defending their own words
and actions than in listening to the voic
es of the people.
They are more interested in blind
"leadership" and dictated "truth" than
i in finding collective solutions to the
world's problems. To put it succinctly,
we're afraid.
