# Students gather around olive tree, seeking unity

In a broad circle around a seven-foot
olive tree in the Oval, students and faculty
sat in silence yesterday, clasping hands in a
gathering intended to promote campus
unity as the war in the Middle East heated
up.
In a six-minute address, University
President Donald Kennedy issued his first
public statement to the community regard
ing the war, urging acceptance of different
views during a potentially divisive period.
Organizers decided to use an olive tree at
the 3 p.m. event because it is "a symbol we
can all use to show our hope for peace,"
explained senior Susannah Miller during a
brief speech.
Although organizers said they hoped
Kennedy's address would not be the central
focus of the event, many who attended, like
English graduate student Elizabeth
McHenry, said they "came out to hear what
Kennedy had to say."
He urged students to remember those in
the Persian Gulf, not only the soldiers on
both sides of the conflict, but also the fami
lies and friends of Stanford students from
the Middle East.
Trying to strike a chord of unity,
Kennedy said, "The first thing we need to
address is one another's feelings."
"There are many beliefs and convictions
in this community, but very different
beliefs and convictions can lead to very sim
ilar feelings," Kennedy said. "And the first
question to ask your fellows is not 'What do
you think,' but 'How do you feel.'"
Kennedy's words drew strong and mixed
reactions.
Some students said they were dissatis
fied with Kennedy's remarks. "There needs
to be some thinking about what causes a
war and not just what a war feels like," said
senior Erin Clune.

There are many beliefs
and convictions in this
community, but very dif
ferent beliefs and con
victions can lead to very
similar feelings.'

But Council of President member Good
win Liu called the speech "eloquent." He
said, "I thought it was appropriate. ... It
was not alienating for anyone."
Freshman Alex Kunczynski said it was
encouraging to "hear the University is con
cerned" about divisiveness.
The gathering reached its most poignant
moment when an estimated 700 students
and faculty observed three minutes of con
templative silence. Many of those seated in
concentric circles around the olive tree
clasped their neighbors' hands and bowed
their heads. Small knots of students stood
clustered on the edges of the circle whisper
ing quietly among themselves.
Kennedy broke the silence, saying,
"What do we share? We share in the first
instance a sense of mourning, for a war
always represents the failure of reason, and
that is cause to mourn."
Junior Raphe Beck said he was glad
there was an immediate response from the
University to the war in the Middle East.
Some criticized the gathering as inap
propriate. Education graduate student Pia
Moriarty said she was "appalled by this

rally because it is structured to
silence people and that is not
right at this time."
Moriarty, who was an under
graduate at Stanford during the
Vietnam War, said she preferred
Tuesday's anti-war protest in
White Plaza because it "reflected
the kind of maturity and diversity
that Stanford is supposed to
stand for."
As the 40-minute event came
to a close, Kennedy was sur
rounded by a group of about 25
students before he returned to his
office in Building 10.
The vocal group tossed ques
tions at Kennedy, trying to elicit
an official opinion about the Uni
versity's position on the war.
"We want the University to call
[on] students to be political
thinking, critical people, the way
uftiversities should be," shouted
one woman in the crowd.
Kennedy declined to make a
statement on behalf of the Uni
versity.
