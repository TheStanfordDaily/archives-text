## And I Feel Fine... 
### 
OVER BREAK, I HAD A FRIEND
visit me. She lives in Oregon. In
Oregon, they don't have Jews. In
fact, she was so nervous about visiting my
little Semitic town of Edison, N.J., that
she went to her local Klamath Falls
library and took out their one small book
entitled "The Jews of Oregon."
So I rented "Manhattan" and "The
Front," took her to the 2nd Avenue Deli,
showed her my bar mitzvah pictures, and
tried to describe what borscht is without
actually making her taste it.
My family, however was, from her soci
ological perspective, disappointingly lack
ing in "Jewishness."
That is, until my parents started to
talk about Israel.
If I remember correctly, Heather
(that's her name) started the conversa
tion, eager to utilize her new-found
knowledge about Golda Meir and the
more obscure contents of Gefllte Fish.
"So," she began, "have either of you ever
been to Israel?"
My mother began as one would expect
a Northeastern Jew to ... "I never really
felt Jewish until I went to Israel" and pro
ceeded to tell us about the unique, per
sonal, somewhat mystical, self-identity
revelation every American Jew seems to
have when they hear their tour guide
drone his memorized spiel about the won
derous history of the Wailing Wall.
When my Mom had finished, Heather
looked toward my Dad. He then said what
were probably the only two non-comedic
words he directed toward her the whole
week.
"Israel is."

WHEN THIS WAR STARTED, it
didn't seem serious. I knew as
much about war as I did about
the Mafia; through history books and
Scorcese movies.
I knew the correct things to feel. I was
angry at Bush for starting it, I was sad
that people were going to die, and I was
scared that I might be forced to.
The overall feeling, however, was
detached. And the first day only encour
aged this detachment. This was just
another '80s-like post-Vietnam drill.
Another Grenada. Another Panama.
Sure, some Iraqis would die, but I
guess that's the price we have to pay to
keep our insecure American egos intact
from the Falling Roman Empire picture
painted by our Japanese-fearing
economists.
But last night,, Israel was attacked.
People, looked their doors, stuffed toilet
paper in their key holes, and pulled out
their gas mask kits like some warped, no
longer-so-campy 1950's government film.
Tom Brokaw, who I previously remem
bered best for telling me that he couldn't
get me Letterman tickets, was talking
about nuclear weapons.
000
I WAS AT THE DAILY when I found all
this out, and the first thing that
struck my mind was fear. Fear and
anger. But two minutes later I was won
dering if I'd have time to rewrite my col
umn. And a minute after that I was
thinking about where I could grab some
thing to eat.

I SAW A CLIP OF the announcer at the
Citadel basketball game Wednesday,
telling the fans that we had attacked
Baghdad. And they cheered.
On the news I heard an overly excited
commander who had returned from a
"hit" tell a reporter that he was "proud as
punch."
And our President promised to "kick
some ass."
At least I'm not alone in my Risk-like,
Operation: Thunderbolt mentality.
000
Today I'm sure I'll just go to
class and worry about papers and
whether to rent a movie tonight or
watch old episodes of Cop Rock instead.
Even if things get more serious, as
they're likely to, I don't think I'll have
any sense of the reality.
After all, I have all this stuff to do this
weekend. I have to get a haircut, and fill
out this new eyeglass prescription, and
there's that Giants game to watch.
Maybe that's how we got into this
trouble in the first place.
