Conscientious objector should fulfill her obligations to the U.S. Army

SINCE WE RAN Aim6e
Allison's Jan. 14 Viewpoint,
we ve received about a dozen
letters criticizing the Army
reservist for filing for conscientious
objector status.
Many questioned why Allison, a
former member of the Council of
Presidents, had not acted on her
pacifist impulses earlier.
"While it's possible Allison is sin
cere in her objections, the timing of
her new-found moral objections to
the military makes that proposition
doubtful," suggested one reader.
Others stressed that Allison had
a contractual obligation to the
Army and to U.S. taxpayers, like it
or not.
As one reader put it,"I do not
criticize Allison for her views....
What I do object to is the belief by
Allison and others of her ilk that it
is okay to take advantage of the sys
tem and then reject it when it asks
for something in return."
The following are some samples
of the mail we have received in
response to Allison's Viewpoint.

I AM APPALLED AT YOU, Aim6e Alii
son. Behind the facade of a young,
intelligent, aspiring college senior, I
see an irresponsible young child. Do you
think you can have your cake and eat it,
too? At the expense of the United States?
Meanwhile, you have also let down
hundreds of thousands of servicemen and
women who may be counting on your
skilled support, should the time come.
I would doubt you considered leaving
the service years ago when you first
started taking on pacifist beliefs . .. not
with all the tuition bills ahead of you.
It's time to grow up and fulfill the legal
agreement you thoughtfully entered four
years ago.
I don't believe in war, but I do believe
in living up to promises. I hope you do the
right thing, Aim6e Allison.

I FOUND AIMfiE ALLISON'S column
on conscientious objection very dis
turbing. I hope it was some kind of
joke, because if it wasn't, it demonstrated
her to be absurdly selfish and presumptu
ous.
Allison joined the military as a volun

teer; she was not forced to do so. Before
she signed up she should have thought
about what she was doing. Even though
she hadn't yet shaped her "moral philoso
phy," she committed herself to a contrac
tual obligation.
Didn't she realize the armed forces are
armed for a reason? Didn't she know that
when she joined she was agreeing to
defend her nation and its interests?
If Allison's discharge is granted, she
will be guilty of a breach of contract, and
I certainly hope she intends to pay back
the government both for her scholarship
and for the costs of training and equip
ping her.
We taxpayers didn't intend to give Alli
son a free ride; when she volunteered to
join the army, we expected to get our
money's worth.

THE BIGGEST PROBLEM with
Allison's piece is its selfishness and
hypocrisy. It is selfish because it
shows an unwillingness to assist the
group she says she is most concerned
about — America's black underclass.
It is hypocritical because she's willing

Allison does not have to violate her personal code of
non-violent behavior in fulfilling her military obligation.
Last time I checked, medics did not attack the enemy
with bayonets.

to take Uncle Sam's money for her per
sonal needs, but not to pay it back in the
form of national service. If her dedication
to "black America" were great, she would
be concerned about the welfare of the
infantrymen in the Gulf, a disproportion
ate number of whom are black, and might
risk her personal safety to save their lives.
Since she is a combat medic, she has
the greatest of all positions for the Chris

But self-sacrifice does not appear to be

providing front-line medical care for
injured soldiers is immoral, and that

therefore no valid claim can be made
upon her to fulfill her obligation to this

I would not be the one to claim that her
recently discovered moral stand, which
fortuitously occurred during the Decem
ber military buildup in the Gulf, is any
thing more than a coincidence. Nor would
I expect her to pay back the amount of her
education grant plus interest, since she is
reneging on her agreement with the mili
tary.
But I would like to see more compas
sion and courage on her part for her not
so-privileged peers in Antioch who are
unable to evade military service due to
fashionable book-learning. "For one is
approved if, mindful of God, he endures

American military action will help weaker nations, save lives in Gulf

I HAVE WRITTEN PREVIOUSLY IN
The Daily calling for the United
States to help its defenseless friends
who are victims of aggression. I know
that although three in four Americans
polled support Bush's decision to start
militapr action to liberate Kuwait, the
mfyority of Stanford students take an
anti-war stance.
However, I feel it is time to let them
know that there are many people in the
world who live in small countries who
are thankful that Saddam Hussein is
being taught that aggression will not be
accepted by the world community.
War is a terrible thing, but the fact is
that we live in an imperfect world with

despots like Saddam Hussein who cannot
be restrained without the use of force.
Now that war between Iraq and the
Allies has begun, there are still quite a
few things to be grateful for:
• Thousands of Israeli and Pales
tinian lives spared from Iraqi missiles
which were destroyed by allied bombing.
• Thousands of civilian lives spared
from chemical attacks after destruction
of much of Iraq's chemical weapons.
• Tens of thousands of lives spared
from nuclear attack in a future war with
an Iraq that will have developed nuclear
capability.
• Hope for an early end to the war,
saving the lives of tens of thousands of

soldiers on both sides.
• Freedom from Iraqi occupation and
repression for the Kuwaiti people.
• Possible overthrow of Saddam Hus
sein by his own people, leading to their
liberation from a brutal dictatorship.
• A strengthened United Nations,
able to resolve conflicts in other regions
of the world.
• Increased security for smaller
nations, who no longer need to spend so
much money on their own defense
forces, with a dividend for combating
poverty and disease.
• More democracy in the world, as
dictators no longer have the option of
diverting their people's attention

War is a terrible thing, but

Hussein.

through foreign adventurism.
For all of the above, we have to thank
the servicemen from all the countries
that have sent troops to aid in the allied
war effort. But above all, the United
States gets the credit for it would all
have been impossible without the Ameri
can commitment to implement United

Nations resolutions.
I know it is unfair that the American
people have to shoulder such responsibil
ity for maintaining international secu
rity. One day, the United Nations will
have its own international police force.
But at present, nobody can do the job
without help from the United States.
So, from someone from a little coun
try in the Third World, thanks to the
American people. One day, there will be a
memorial in Washington to those who
gave their lives in this hopefully brief
war. I will go there to lay a wreath. But I
know they have not died in vain.

Conscientious objector should fulfill her obligations to the U.S. Army

SINCE WE RAN Aim6e
Allison's Jan. 14 Viewpoint,
we ve received about a dozen
letters criticizing the Army
reservist for filing for conscientious
objector status.
Many questioned why Allison, a
former member of the Council of
Presidents, had not acted on her
pacifist impulses earlier.
"While it's possible Allison is sin
cere in her objections, the timing of
her new-found moral objections to
the military makes that proposition
doubtful," suggested one reader.
Others stressed that Allison had
a contractual obligation to the
Army and to U.S. taxpayers, like it
or not.
As one reader put it,"I do not
criticize Allison for her views....
What I do object to is the belief by
Allison and others of her ilk that it
is okay to take advantage of the sys
tem and then reject it when it asks
for something in return."
The following are some samples
of the mail we have received in
response to Allison's Viewpoint.

I AM APPALLED AT YOU, Aim6e Alii
son. Behind the facade of a young,
intelligent, aspiring college senior, I
see an irresponsible young child. Do you
think you can have your cake and eat it,
too? At the expense of the United States?
Meanwhile, you have also let down
hundreds of thousands of servicemen and
women who may be counting on your
skilled support, should the time come.
I would doubt you considered leaving
the service years ago when you first
started taking on pacifist beliefs . .. not
with all the tuition bills ahead of you.
It's time to grow up and fulfill the legal
agreement you thoughtfully entered four
years ago.
I don't believe in war, but I do believe
in living up to promises. I hope you do the
right thing, Aim6e Allison.

I FOUND AIMfiE ALLISON'S column
on conscientious objection very dis
turbing. I hope it was some kind of
joke, because if it wasn't, it demonstrated
her to be absurdly selfish and presumptu
ous.
Allison joined the military as a volun

teer; she was not forced to do so. Before
she signed up she should have thought
about what she was doing. Even though
she hadn't yet shaped her "moral philoso
phy," she committed herself to a contrac
tual obligation.
Didn't she realize the armed forces are
armed for a reason? Didn't she know that
when she joined she was agreeing to
defend her nation and its interests?
If Allison's discharge is granted, she
will be guilty of a breach of contract, and
I certainly hope she intends to pay back
the government both for her scholarship
and for the costs of training and equip
ping her.
We taxpayers didn't intend to give Alli
son a free ride; when she volunteered to
join the army, we expected to get our
money's worth.

THE BIGGEST PROBLEM with
Allison's piece is its selfishness and
hypocrisy. It is selfish because it
shows an unwillingness to assist the
group she says she is most concerned
about — America's black underclass.
It is hypocritical because she's willing

Allison does not have to violate her personal code of
non-violent behavior in fulfilling her military obligation.
Last time I checked, medics did not attack the enemy
with bayonets.

to take Uncle Sam's money for her per
sonal needs, but not to pay it back in the
form of national service. If her dedication
to "black America" were great, she would
be concerned about the welfare of the
infantrymen in the Gulf, a disproportion
ate number of whom are black, and might
risk her personal safety to save their lives.
Since she is a combat medic, she has
the greatest of all positions for the Chris
tian. She may make a personal sacrifice to
help others under "the banner of moral
non-violence."
She does not have to violate her per

filling her military obligation. Last time I

But self-sacrifice does not appear to be

providing front-line medical care for
injured soldiers is immoral, and that

therefore no valid claim can be made
upon her to fulfill her obligation to this
country.
I would not be the one to claim that her
recently discovered moral stand, which
fortuitously occurred during the Decem
ber military buildup in the Gulf, is any
thing more than a coincidence. Nor would
I expect her to pay back the amount of her
education grant plus interest, since she is
reneging on her agreement with the mili
tary.
But I would like to see more compas
sion and courage on her part for her not
so-privileged peers in Antioch who are
unable to evade military service due to
fashionable book-learning. "For one is
approved if, mindful of God, he endures
pain while suffering unjustly" (1 Peter
2:19).

American military action will help weaker nations, save lives in Gulf

I HAVE WRITTEN PREVIOUSLY IN
The Daily calling for the United
States to help its defenseless friends
who are victims of aggression. I know
that although three in four Americans
polled support Bush's decision to start
militapr action to liberate Kuwait, the
mfyority of Stanford students take an
anti-war stance.
However, I feel it is time to let them
know that there are many people in the
world who live in small countries who
are thankful that Saddam Hussein is
being taught that aggression will not be
accepted by the world community.
War is a terrible thing, but the fact is
that we live in an imperfect world with

despots like Saddam Hussein who cannot
be restrained without the use of force.
Now that war between Iraq and the
Allies has begun, there are still quite a
few things to be grateful for:
• Thousands of Israeli and Pales
tinian lives spared from Iraqi missiles
which were destroyed by allied bombing.
• Thousands of civilian lives spared
from chemical attacks after destruction
of much of Iraq's chemical weapons.
• Tens of thousands of lives spared
from nuclear attack in a future war with
an Iraq that will have developed nuclear
capability.
• Hope for an early end to the war,
saving the lives of tens of thousands of

soldiers on both sides.
• Freedom from Iraqi occupation and
repression for the Kuwaiti people.
• Possible overthrow of Saddam Hus
sein by his own people, leading to their
liberation from a brutal dictatorship.
• A strengthened United Nations,
able to resolve conflicts in other regions
of the world.
• Increased security for smaller
nations, who no longer need to spend so
much money on their own defense
forces, with a dividend for combating
poverty and disease.
• More democracy in the world, as
dictators no longer have the option of
diverting their people's attention

War is a terrible thing, but

Hussein.

through foreign adventurism.
For all of the above, we have to thank
the servicemen from all the countries
that have sent troops to aid in the allied
war effort. But above all, the United
States gets the credit for it would all
have been impossible without the Ameri
can commitment to implement United

Nations resolutions.
I know it is unfair that the American
people have to shoulder such responsibil
ity for maintaining international secu
rity. One day, the United Nations will
have its own international police force.
But at present, nobody can do the job
without help from the United States.
So, from someone from a little coun
try in the Third World, thanks to the
American people. One day, there will be a
memorial in Washington to those who
gave their lives in this hopefully brief
war. I will go there to lay a wreath. But I
