## Cagers roll over UCLA, Stephens 
### David Hirning Senior staff writer 
Despite its efforts, the Cardinal
women's basketball team couldn't
hold UCLA's scoring machine
Rahema Stephens under her con
ference-leading average of 27
points per game. Unfortunately
for the Bruins, however, No. 9-
ranked Stanford has too many
weapons to be overcome by one
player, and the home team never
struggled in an easy 17-point win.
Although the Pacific 10 Confer
ence is not the Cakewalk it was a
few years ago, Stanford's 91-74
victory over the Bruins proved
that, especially at home, it is still
head-and-shoulders above the
megority of Pac-10 teams.
"You know Stanford's an expe
rienced team," said UCLA coach
Billie Moore. "We made a couple
runs on them, but, as an experi
enced team will do, they came
down and capitalized on our mis
takes and hit the big basket."
All five of the Cardinal's
starters scored in double figures
as Stanford (11-3) won its fifth in
a row and remains undefeated in
the Pac-10 (5-0). It was the team's
38th straight win in Maples Pavil
ion. The Bruins fell to .500 in both
categories, 7-7 overall and 2-2 in
the conference.
The athletic Stephens had an
"average" game, scoring exactly
27 points, but only by her own
prolific standards. However, the
normally accurate long-range
bombing by the junior guard was
thrown off by the defense of Car
dinal Christy Hedgpeth, and
Stephens was shut out from
three-point range (0-for-2).
"She might have had [271, but

it was [271 quiet ones," Stanford
coach Tara VanDerveer said. "I
thought Christy did a really good
job on Rahema. Last year against
us she had 20 points at halftime.
This time, she had a lot at the
end."
Hedgpeth had a solid game in
her fifth consecutive start and is
beginning to put a hammerlock on
the starting off-guard position.
The freshman, who averages
nearly six points per game, had 14
last night on 6-of-8 shooting in
addition to her defensive work.
"Christy's kind of arrived,"
said VanDerveer. "I see great
things on the way from her."
The other explosive Bruin
weapons, redshirt freshman
Natalie Williams and sophomore

Nicole Anderson, never got firing.
Williams, the "Adam Keefe in
reverse" of women's basketball,
came into the game averaging 14
points and 10 rebounds a game
and had everyone a little wary of
UCLA's latest acquisition.
Williams joined the Bruins just
in time for the Pac-10 schedule,
after leading the UCLA women's
volleyball team to the NCAA title
in December. A sophomore aca
demically, the 6-foot-1 standout
did not play or practice for
Moore's team last season and
played in only her fifth game last
night.
"It's basically her first time
touching a basketball since her
senior year of high school," said
Moore, of the two-sport high
school Ail-American. Williams
recently missed a conference game
with Arizona State to try out for
the U.S. National team.
But although Williams proved
to be Stanford's undoing on the
volleyball court, pounding 29 kills

for a .512 hitting percentage in
the Bruins' Western Regional vic
tory over the Cardinal, it would
not be the same story this
evening. She picked up her third
foul with more than 10 minutes
left in the first half and entered
the break without attempting a

shot. Williams finished with eight
points and eight rebounds.
"Williams got in foul trouble early,
and she is a big part of what we are try
ing to do offensively," Moore said.
"Without her, Stanford was able to con
centrate on stopping Stephens. She's
still young, and I think it takes a lot of
maturity to learn how to play in foul
trouble."
Without Williams, the Bruins lacked
any inside muscle to cope with the start
ing Cardinal front line of Julie Zeilstra,
Val Whiting, and Trisha Stevens. The
trio combined for 48 points and 22
rebounds against the overmatched
UCLA post players.
Stevens led Stanford with 19, and
Zeilstra had 18. Stephens's 27 and Amy
Jalewalia's 20 paced the Bruin attack.
Anderson was clearly flustered play
ing against Sonja Henning, whom many
consider the premier point guard in the
country. The lightning-quick Anderson
was a frigid 0-for-8 from the field and
committed five turnovers. Henning had
15 points on 6-of-ll shooting from the
field.
The Cardinal again lost the battle of
the boards (the 10th time it has done so
in 14 games), but many of UCLA's
rebounds came on its own missed shots.
On the defensive end, Stanford held a
37-30 rebound edge. Whiting chipped in
her usual 11 boards to lead Stanford.

ing against Sonja Henning, whom many
consider the premier point guard in the
country. The lightning-quick Anderson
was a frigid 0-for-8 from the field and
committed five turnovers. Henning had
15 points on 6-of-ll shooting from the
field.
The Cardinal again lost the battle of
the boards (the 10th time it has done so
in 14 games), but many of UCLA's
rebounds came on its own missed shots.
On the defensive end, Stanford held a
37-30 rebound edge. Whiting chipped in
her usual 11 boards to lead Stanford.
Despite its efforts, the Cardinal
women's basketball team couldn't
hold UCLA's scoring machine
Rahema Stephens under her con
ference-leading average of 27
points per game. Unfortunately
for the Bruins, however, No. 9-
ranked Stanford has too many
weapons to be overcome by one
player, and the home team never
struggled in an easy 17-point win.
Although the Pacific 10 Confer
ence is not the Cakewalk it was a
few years ago, Stanford's 91-74
victory over the Bruins proved
that, especially at home, it is still
head-and-shoulders above the
megority of Pac-10 teams.
"You know Stanford's an expe
rienced team," said UCLA coach
Billie Moore. "We made a couple
runs on them, but, as an experi
enced team will do, they came
down and capitalized on our mis
takes and hit the big basket."
All five of the Cardinal's
starters scored in double figures
as Stanford (11-3) won its fifth in
a row and remains undefeated in
the Pac-10 (5-0). It was the team's
38th straight win in Maples Pavil
ion. The Bruins fell to .500 in both
categories, 7-7 overall and 2-2 in
the conference.
The athletic Stephens had an
"average" game, scoring exactly
27 points, but only by her own
prolific standards. However, the
normally accurate long-range
bombing by the junior guard was
thrown off by the defense of Car
dinal Christy Hedgpeth, and
Stephens was shut out from
three-point range (0-for-2).
"She might have had [271, but

it was [271 quiet ones," Stanford
coach Tara VanDerveer said. "I
thought Christy did a really good
job on Rahema. Last year against
us she had 20 points at halftime.
This time, she had a lot at the
end."
Hedgpeth had a solid game in
her fifth consecutive start and is
beginning to put a hammerlock on
the starting off-guard position.
The freshman, who averages
nearly six points per game, had 14
last night on 6-of-8 shooting in
addition to her defensive work.
"Christy's kind of arrived,"
said VanDerveer. "I see great
things on the way from her."
The other explosive Bruin
weapons, redshirt freshman
Natalie Williams and sophomore

Nicole Anderson, never got firing.
Williams, the "Adam Keefe in
reverse" of women's basketball,
came into the game averaging 14
points and 10 rebounds a game
and had everyone a little wary of
UCLA's latest acquisition.
Williams joined the Bruins just
in time for the Pac-10 schedule,
after leading the UCLA women's
volleyball team to the NCAA title
in December. A sophomore aca
demically, the 6-foot-1 standout
did not play or practice for
Moore's team last season and
played in only her fifth game last
night.
"It's basically her first time
touching a basketball since her
senior year of high school," said
Moore, of the two-sport high
school Ail-American. Williams
recently missed a conference game
with Arizona State to try out for
the U.S. National team.
But although Williams proved
to be Stanford's undoing on the
volleyball court, pounding 29 kills

for a .512 hitting percentage in
the Bruins' Western Regional vic
tory over the Cardinal, it would
not be the same story this
evening. She picked up her third
foul with more than 10 minutes
left in the first half and entered
the break without attempting a

shot. Williams finished with eight
points and eight rebounds.
"Williams got in foul trouble early,
and she is a big part of what we are try
ing to do offensively," Moore said.
"Without her, Stanford was able to con
centrate on stopping Stephens. She's
still young, and I think it takes a lot of
maturity to learn how to play in foul
trouble."
Without Williams, the Bruins lacked
any inside muscle to cope with the start
ing Cardinal front line of Julie Zeilstra,
Val Whiting, and Trisha Stevens. The
trio combined for 48 points and 22
rebounds against the overmatched
UCLA post players.
Stevens led Stanford with 19, and
Zeilstra had 18. Stephens's 27 and Amy
Jalewalia's 20 paced the Bruin attack.
Anderson was clearly flustered play
ing against Sonja Henning, whom many
consider the premier point guard in the
country. The lightning-quick Anderson
was a frigid 0-for-8 from the field and
committed five turnovers. Henning had
15 points on 6-of-ll shooting from the
field.
