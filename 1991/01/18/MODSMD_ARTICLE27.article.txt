# Women's Basketball vs. USC
## 
### 
TOMORROW NIGHT — 7:30 p.m. lipoff in Maples Pavilion. Televison: PSN
(Primeticket). Radio: KZSU (90.1 FM) with the down-home Yellowjacket
Brett Battles and a color commentator to be named later.
RECORDS - Stanford (11-3, 5-0 and Ist in the Pac-10), USC (9-5, 3-1).
CARDINAL UPDATE — Stanford goes for its 39th consecutive home win,
dating back to 1987-88 (when it lost to UCLA). Stanford is led by forward
Julie Zellstra's 19 points a game. The Cardinal has won five in a row,
all in conference, and is attempting to go undefeated in the Pac-10 for
the second time in three years. A win against USC would be the Cardinal's
sixth straight over the Trojans.
TROJAN UPDATE USC is led emphatically by superfrosh Lisa Leslie.
You've heard of Leslie, the Wilt Chamberlain of women's college bas
ketball. She once scored 100 points in a game in high school. Actually,
she did Chamberlain one better: she did it in a half. So far, the 6-5
Leslie is averaging 20 points and 13 rebounds a game (entering last
week). She couldn't help them against California last night, however, as
the Bears handed the Trojans their first Pac-10 loss, 92-66.
