# Hoopsters can make history with a victory

### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES — Try and guess
how long it's been since the Stanford
men's basketball team swept UCLA and
USC on the road in the same season.
Wrong. Try again.
Nope.
Give up? Fine. The answer isn't 15
years, not 25, not 35, not even 45. The
last time Stanford swept the L.A. schools
was . . .nineteen forty-two, which was
also the year the Cardinal won its first
(and only) NCAA title.
Most of those years of frustration
have been caused by UCLA, which
before last season hadn't lost to the Car
dinal at home since 1952. Now, however,
after Wednesday night's 89-82 Stanford
win at Pauley Pavilion, the Cardinal has
a two-game winning streak on the Bru
ins' home floor — and a chance, tomor
row afternoon at USC, to do something
that apparently happens once every 49
(or more) years.
"I think [the UCLA winj loosens up
the guys and makes us a little more
relaxed," senior Andrew Vlahov said.
"There's also a feeling, I think, in the
back of everyone's heads that even if we
do lose we've got a split, and a split on
the road is really something. That's the
way the Pac-10 is this year."
An attitude like that might also lead
to a letdown tomorrow afternoon —
which is exactly what Stanford wants to
avoid.
"We'll talk about it, I'm sure," Vlahov
said. "It's happened in the past too many
times, unfortunately." In the last five
years, Stanford has swept only two Pac
-10 road trips — both of them during the
1988-89 season.
"In the Pac-10 there aren't too many
chances to sweep on the road," John
Patrick said. "If we could do it, we might
have a leg up on everybody, and maybe
make up for what happened in Oregon."
"We just talked about it," Stanford
coach Mike Montgomery said after last
night's practice, "and we'll talk about it
some more. ... It's tough, because you
get up to come here and play two really
good teams. Then you beat UCLA, so it's
something to worry about."
There are, of course, other matters
for the Cardinal (and everyone else) to
worry about. Yesterday's practice at
Pauley was quick, businesslike and
maybe even a little restrained, because
while they've been trying to think about
tomorrow's game, everyone on the team

has spent much of the last 36 hours con
centrating on events several thousand
miles away — events much, much more
important than a basketball game.
"I think it actually helped us in the
game last night," Vlahov said. "We post
poned leaving the hotel for 15 minutes to
watch the presidential address, and then
we talked about it on the bus on the way
over.
"Once we got here, though, we just
said there was really nothing we could do
for everyone over there, and that made
us come together as a group and got us
ready mentally for the game."
"It is a distraction, but it's a distrac
tion for everybody," Montgomery said.
"The kids have all been watching the
news as much as I have."
Tomorrow afternoon they'll be watch
ing the Trojans, with a chance to make a
little history. "I think we'll win," Vlahov
said, "but only if we do the right things
and don't get cocky, thinking we're bet
ter than we really are."
