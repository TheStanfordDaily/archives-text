# Overseas students keep low profile
## 
### Mike Laris Staff writer 
As their nervous parents con
tinue to call the University, stu
dents at Stanford'8 overseas cam
puses are keeping a low profile
and taking other measures to
increase their security after the
onset of war in the Middle East.
Iraq's longstanding threat of
terrorist reprisals has prompted a
heightened state of alert on the
campuses.
But, "we are continuing to
operate," said Corbin Smith,
deputy director of Stanford Over
seas Studies. "We will continue to
do so unless we have a direct
threat to students or centers, or
until the State Department indi
cates otherwise."
Smith said the State Depart
ment released an advisory for U.S.
citizens in Western Europe
shortly before war began, stating
that the U.S. government antici
pates an increased risk of terrorist
activities against Americans and
U.S. interests. The statement
emphasized that there were no
specific threats, but rather a gen
eral "increased security threat."
All students at Stanford's over
seas programs have been given
telephone cards to use in case of
an emergency. The cards list the
home phone number of the cam
pus directors, local police and
medical numbers, and a toll-free
hot line to call Stanford in case
other sources of help are unavail
able.
He said students at each cam
pus are also part of a telephone
tree to speed the dissemination of
important information.
Students at all of the overseas
centers are taking extra safety
precautions.
At Stanford's Oxford center, a
security guard has been hired for
the protection of a Stanford stu
dent dormitory at Oxford during
sleeping hours, Smith said.
He said students at the Stan
ford Program in Florence, Italy,
met yesterday and decided they
would suspend classes today with
the idea that they would "stick
around their homes," although he
suspected some might take the
opportunity to travel.
Sharra Smith, a junior at the
Stanford Program in Berlin, said,
"We are not very concerned we are
going to be targets of terrorism."
She noted that an hour of classes
was canceled yesterday so stu
dents in the program could watch
the news, although classes are
now back on schedule.
"We'll probably have meetings

(about security) once a week," she
said. "Other than that, things are
going on pretty much normal."
According to Roberto Giori,
also a junior at the Berlin center,
"In general, there are some people
who are pretty nervous. Terror
ism is the one aspect of the war
that is most on the minds of the
people over here."
He said students were briefed
on terrorism. They were told to lie
low, look for anything suspicious
and not to go to American hang
outs. Along the same lines,
Sharra Smith said students were
told not to go to the Burger King
on a local U.S. Army base.
Both Smith and Giori said
there were demonstrations in
Berlin against the U.S.-led mili
tary assault.
"The country here is very
much against what America is
doing," she said.
"There are a lot of protests
over here," according to Giori.
People chanted, "USA â€” Interna
tional Thugs" and blockaded a
U.S. military base, he said. He
added that students were not wor
ried about the protests as long as
they were not directed personally
against them.
Two students in the Stanford
Program in Paris who live in a
segment of an international stu
dent dormitory named after the
United States felt conspicuous,
said Corbin Smith. "They felt this

created for them a greater visibil
ity as a target than they were com
fortable with," he said. Additional
security was added, Smith said.
Approximately 60 parents
called Overseas Studies over the
last week to inquire about safety
of Stanford students abroad, said
Smith. About 20 of those came
after war began on Jan. 16.
Smith said most calls have
come from parents of students
about to enter the Intercollegiate
Center for Classical Studies in
Rome or students already attend
ing the Stanford Program in Flo
rence. Inquiries have also made
about the programs in Tours,
Berlin and Oxford.
He said he tells parents that
programs will remain open unless
there are direct threats or new
information, that security precau
tions have been taken and that
University administrators are in
close communication with the
campuses by phone, fax and elec
tronic mail.
He also mentioned that several
parents called yesterday about
false rumors that the Harvard
program in Florence had been
bombed.
"The rumors are not fair to
parents," he said.
Some US. universities have
decided not to open or have actu
ally closed some of their European
campuses. Both Trinity College in
Connecticut and Duke University
have canceled overseas programs

in Italv because many students
decided not to attend.
Georgetown University closed
its program in Florence for this
semester. Smith said the move
was purely precautionary and
does not mean that Georgetown
had access to special information.
Georgetown officials may be
especially sensitive to the danger
of terrorism because their Flo
rence campus received a threaten
ing letter in November from a
group claiming to be terrorists.
The letter was later classified by
the State Department as a hoax.
Some Stanford students and
their families are weighing the
risks of studying abroad in
wartime. One student, Noeleen
Walder, canceled plans to stay at
the Stanford Program in Florence
through winter quarter. She
returned to the U.S. the day
before war began because her
family feared for her safety.
"Some parents were a little
concerned. Some parents were not
concerned at all," she said. "Out
of all the people, I had the most
extreme situation. . . [They]
eventually just said, 'No more
waiting. It's time to come home.'"
Walder left a close Italian
friend in Florence and said she
would have stayed had her par
ents not insisted she come home.
"But that doesn't mean I
thought it was completely safe,"
she said.
