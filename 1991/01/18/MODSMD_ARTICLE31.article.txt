NEW YORK (AP) - NBC and CBS are
moving ahead with plans to televise the
NFL's conference championship games
Sunday, while advertisers wonder whether
"the mood of the country is right for foot
ball."
On Thursday, Col. John Myers, director
of advertising for the U.S. Army recruiting
command at Fort Sheridan, 111., confirmed

the Army was withdrawing all of its TV
advertising for at least two weeks.
The Army had bought one 30-second
commercial each on NBC's telecast of the
AFC championship game at Buffalo and
CBS's NFC championship at San Fran
cisco, Myers said. Also affected will be com
mercials on some college basketball games..
One source, who spoke only on the con-"
dition of anonymity, said the networks
"anticipated this," and understood the
Army's position that ads to "be all that you
can be" might be inapproriate now.
