Long ago, there lived an eighth-grader of exraor
dinary athletic ability named Canyon Ceman. He
faced the arduous decision of an inevitably success
ful high school career which centered around either
tepnis or volleyball. <
He chose volleyball. About all we can say now,
Canyon, is this:
Smart choice. Very smart.
In his first year at Stanford, the 6-foot-4 setter is
still just beginning to reap the benefits of that deci
sion, and in the process is living up to his billing as
last year's top high school player.
"Canyon came to us as one of the top recruits in
the country, and from what I've seen he belongs in
that class," said coach Ruben Nieves. "At the tourna
ment (last weekend in Santa Barbara), Canyon set
five matches for us. I didn't see another freshman
play such a large role."
Being highly sought by virtually all of the top vol
leyball schools in the country made Canyon's deci
sion to come to Stanford a difficult one.
He narrowed his choices between Southern Cali
fornia (currently the nation's top-ranked team) and
Stanford. He chose the Cardinal because "I wanted
to have a solid education to fall back on after volley
ball was over, and because I felt I would fit in a lot
better with the people at Stanford," Ceman said.
One of those persons was junior outside hitter
Duncan Blackman. Ceman played alongside Black
man and Stanford's two-sport star Adam Keefe on
last summer's National "B" Team, which traveled to
Argentina. Ceman and Blackman quickly forged a
close friendship which carried over to the collegiate
season.
"This year Duncan's given me a taste of the colle
giate game," Ceman said. "He's really helped me
with how to act and what to say on a competitive col
legiate court."
The pressure of being perhaps the game's most
highly-touted freshman hasn't had an impact on
Ceman, at least "not from the outside," he said.
"I place a lot of pressure on myself internally. I've
always had a very competitive nature; I want to be
the best, win the starting job. Sure, people expect
me to perform, but I expect a lot more from myself,"
Ceman said.
Nieves sees Ceman's on-court presence as one of
his greatest assets. "Canyon's been popular with his
teammates in both a competitive and social atmo
sphere. It's difficult as a freshman to be in the 'quar
terback' (setter) position, but I think he's handling it
well," Nieves said.
Ceman said his four years of experience setting in
high school have helped him fulfill the role. Still, the
starting job is something that he said "will be up in
the air all year long. We have two other excellent set-
