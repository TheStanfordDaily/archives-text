# Men hope to finally beat Michigan
## 
### Amy Wusterbarth Staff writer 
Broad depth versus concentrated
quality will be the name of the game this
afternoon as the men's swimming team
takes on the powerful Michigan Wolver
ines at deGuerre pool. Three Wolverine
swimmers participated in the World
Championships last week and they will,
no doubt, make up the core of the Michi
gan squad.
The Cardinal is 0-4 against the
Wolverines in dual meets but has beaten
Michigan at NCAA's for the last four
years. Stanford coach Skip Kenney
attributes this to a few outstanding
swimmers.
"Michigan has a small group of qual

ity. They will cover most dual meet
events but at NCAA's its not enough.
We have more depth in our team, we
only had two guys at World's and Eddie
[Parenti] was just in a relay."
Michigan's Mike Barrowman is the
world record holder in the 200 meter
breaststroke while Eric Wunderlich is a
top contender in the 100 meter breast
stroke. These two along with Eric
Namesnik have world-class times in the
Individual Medley events as well.
"We may have some pool records set
here that won't be touched for a long
time," said Kenney.
Cardinal swimmer Derek Weather
ford will be swimming against several
top competitors. "I'm most worried
about Eric Namesnik; he's one of the

top IM-ers in the country. I'm just going
to take it one race at a time."
Having the big names back from Aus
tralia doesn't necessarily mean they will
be a tremendous help. Although they
are rested and shaved they may also be
suffering from fatigue. The three
Wolverines may be at a disadvantage,
having travelled from Australia to
Michigan and now to California.
"We'd hate to win a meet that way,"
said Kenney, "but I'll be really curious
to see how fast the World Championship
guys will go."
In addition, Michigan has been in
training while the Cardinal has been
competing. Kenney sees this as an asset.
"You need to compete to get race-sharp,
so that should be to our advantage."
On the flip Bide, Michigan's schedule
doesn't have as many dual meets with
Top 10 schools so they can prepare for
the important ones.
The Wolverines also boast one of the
top diving programs in the nation which
will give them an edge over Stanford.
"We'd really like to beat Michigan,"
said Kenney, "but more important than
winning we need to swim well and have
faster times.
"We weren't very good at Texas, we
didn't have the type of intensity you'd
expect to have when swimming the No.
1 team in the nation. You can't turn it
on and off. It's up to us; if we swim like
we did against Texas we won't win. We
have to have a new-founded intensity
level."
Coming off of last week's defeat in
Austin, the men seem ready to take
charge. "Overall we have a positive atti
tude," said Matt Rodgers, "We're look
ing to improve on some things we lacked
at Texas."
