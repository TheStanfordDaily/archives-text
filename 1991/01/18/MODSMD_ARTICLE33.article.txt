# Men hope to finally beat Michigan

Broad depth versus concentrated
quality will be the name of the game this
afternoon as the men's swimming team
takes on the powerful Michigan Wolver
ines at deGuerre pool. Three Wolverine
swimmers participated in the World
Championships last week and they will,
no doubt, make up the core of the Michi
gan squad.
The Cardinal is 0-4 against the
Wolverines in dual meets but has beaten
Michigan at NCAA's for the last four
years. Stanford coach Skip Kenney
attributes this to a few outstanding
swimmers.
"Michigan has a small group of qual

ity. They will cover most dual meet
events but at NCAA's its not enough.
We have more depth in our team, we
only had two guys at World's and Eddie
[Parenti] was just in a relay."
Michigan's Mike Barrowman is the
world record holder in the 200 meter
breaststroke while Eric Wunderlich is a
top contender in the 100 meter breast
stroke. These two along with Eric
Namesnik have world-class times in the
Individual Medley events as well.
"We may have some pool records set
here that won't be touched for a long
time," said Kenney.
Cardinal swimmer Derek Weather
ford will be swimming against several
top competitors. "I'm most worried
about Eric Namesnik; he's one of the

top IM-ers in the country. I'm just going
to take it one race at a time."
Having the big names back from Aus
tralia doesn't necessarily mean they will
be a tremendous help. Although they
are rested and shaved they may also be
suffering from fatigue. The three
Wolverines may be at a disadvantage,
having travelled from Australia to
Michigan and now to California.
"We'd hate to win a meet that way,"
said Kenney, "but I'll be really curious
to see how fast the World Championship
guys will go."
In addition, Michigan has been in
training while the Cardinal has been
competing. Kenney sees this as an asset.
