# Netters to tune up for season in Pac-10 indoor tourney
## 
### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
After Buffering through its worst snow
storm in history, Seattle is praying for a lit
tle heat. The blistering serve of Jared
Palmer, the scorching groundstrokes of
Alex O'Brien and the "hot" games of Stan
ford's three newest superstars, Chris Coco
tus, Vimal Patel and Michael Flanagan,
should help fire things up a little, at the
University of Washington tennis courts, at
least.
The Pacific 10 Conference Indoor Indi
vidual Tennis Championships open today at
Washington's new indoor tennis facility in
Seattle. The premier men's tennis teams in
the Pac-10 — in the nation for that matter
— will compete over the next three days,
including No. 1 Stanford, No. 2 UCLA, No.
5 USC, No. 7 California, No. 17 Arizona,
Arizona State, Washington State, Oregon
and, of course, Washington.
"The Pac-10 is the strongest it has been
in years," Stanford Coach Dick Gould said.
"The competition is excellent."
Gould has been especially impressed
with UCLA. Mark Knowles, a finalist in
last weekend's National College Classic in
Palm Springs, has suddenly become a force
in college tennis, and Jason Netter, a final
ist in last year's NCAA singles champi
onships, and freshman David Nainken
round out what is probably the most
improved team in college tennis.
USC, with last year's No. 1 Byron Black
returning, and highly recruited freshman
Brian McPhie playing well, also looks to
give Stanford all it can handle.
Still, Stanford wiU be the team to beat

foot injury, the Cardinal will not be lacking

Stanford will be the team to
beat thlB weekend. Deaplte
the abBence of No. 1
Jonathan Stark, who is
sidelined with a foot Injury,
the Cardinal will not be
lacking firepower.

firepower.
Palmer, O'Brien and Jason Yee, three
returning All-Americans, will highlight an
impressive lineup, which includes three of
the most highly recruited freshmen in the
country, in addition to doubles specialist
Dan Turbow and senior stalwart Glenn
Solomon.
Solomon, arguably the most consistent
member on the Stanford team, just won the
consolation bracket of the College Classic in
Palm Springs for the second year in a row
last weekend, leaving notice that he plans
to contribute in the same fashion as he did
at last year'B NCAA Championships, where
he raised his game to another level and did
not lose a single match.
In this weekend's tournament, all eight
players will play both singles and doubles.
The event will have players competing in
four different brackets.
"[The way the tournament is set up] will
give us a good chance to see how we mea
sure up against the competition and against
ourselves," Gould said.
"If you can win against this level of com
petition, it's a good indicator for how you're
going to do [later in the year]," O'Brien
added.


Benjamin Tong — Daily file
On a team dominated by freshmen and sophomores, senior Glenn Solomon provides solid leadership. Solomon is
renowned for his steady play and his ability to wear out opponents by returning balls as consistently and relentlessly as
a wall. As a result, he often competes in, and wins, matches of epic lengths. Me will be among the three-time defending
national champiopn Cardinal players competing in Seattle this weekend.
