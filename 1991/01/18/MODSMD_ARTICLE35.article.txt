# Grapplers take on Aggies
## 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
It has been, by all accounts, a tough season for
Stanford wrestling.
The Cardinal, picked to finish as high as sec
ond in the Pacific 10 Conference, has been
plagued by a series of injuries and misfortunes,
struggling to a 1-3-1 dual meet record to date.
Last week, the team lost consecutive matches
against Oregon and Oregon State by a total of 71
points, winning only one event in the process. In
addition, Stanford placed eighth in the Aggie
Invitational, a meet which the club had won three
of the previous four seasons.
All letdowns showed signs of recovery Wednes
day night. Fielding a full card of starters for the
first time in nearly three weeks, the Cardinal tied
a perenially strong Fresno State team, 17-17.
Tomorrow night, the team seeks to continue
its turnaround, as it faces UC-Davis in Davis.
According to Chris Horpel, the match should be a
much-needed easy win for Stanford.
"As long as no injuries occur between now and
then, I anticipate having no problems with the
Aggies," said the coach.
For Stanford, the idea of an ii\jury-free team
has been unheard of in 1990-91. Although no
first-teamers are currently on the sidelines, half
of the team's starters have been out for signifi
cant parts of the schedule.
Leading the list of newly-healed wrestlers is

167-pounder Steve Buddie. The senior, an All-
American last vear, has been bothered by bursitis
in his elbow for the better part of two weeks.
Wednesday night he was in old form, despite
sporting an elbow brace. Controlling his opponent
from the top position most of the match, he
scored an 18-2 technical fall, and improved his
record on the year to 16-2.
Other starters back in action include 134-
pound freshman Lance Johnson (10-4 on the sea
son), 158-pound junior Matt Topham (3-4), and
190-pouna junior Mark Graham (8-4). All three
were victorious in their returns Wednesday night.
Another encouraging development for Stan
ford concerns the emergence of a legitimate
heavyweight in freshman Scott Whitt. Whitt, nor
mally a football offensive lineman, was pressed
into action by a Cardinal club which had no true
heavyweights on its roster.
Facing the former California state high school
heavyweight champion, Whitt lost his first dual
meet on Wednesday. However, Horpel was pleased
with his wrestling.
"Whitt just doesn't know enough right now
about the sport," the coach said. "As long as that's
the case, I'm happy, because he will continue to
improve in practice."
The Aggies, 3-9-0 in dual meets, are led by Blu
Taylor. The 150-pounder won the Aggie Invita
tional, and is 19-8 on the year. Match time is 7:30
p.m.
