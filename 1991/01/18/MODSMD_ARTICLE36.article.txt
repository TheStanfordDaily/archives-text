# Gymnasts compete tonight

Tonight, the Stanford women's
gymnastics team will face off
against California for their second
meet of the new season.
Despite last weekend's loss to
Cal State-Fullerton, coach Breck
Greenwood feels relatively confi
dent about the meet. "Last week,
even though it was a loss, was
exciting," he said. "Cal State-
Fullerton is a perennial power
house, and we are really closing
the gap between us and some of
the top teams."
The Stanford women only lost
by a few points this year, a definite
improvement from last season's
matchup between the two teams.
Tonight's meet, at California's
Harmon Gym at 7:30 p.m.,
includes the Stanford women, as
well as California and the Univer
sity of New Hampshire, two very
strong opponents. With only
seven Stanford women competing,
Greenwood looks to each of them
to perform well.
"We hope to win, athough that
is hard to do at their gym," Green
wood said. "We think that we are
as good as, if not better than [the
other teamsj. It's going to be a
battle to see who comes out on

top."
Leading the Cardinal will be
freshman sensation Kerri
Kanuka, hailing from Retina,
Saskatchewan, who led the Stan
ford all-arounders with a third
place finish at last week's meet.
"We hope that Kerri will continue
the trend and be one of our top all
arounders all year," said Green
wood.
The Cardinal will also look to
freshman Kerrie Kelley to lead in
the balance beam, coming off an
explosive performance last week
which tied her for first place in the
event. Senior Jennifer Bloom and
Erin McCann are also expected to
help lead the Cardinal.
The Stanford gymnasts also
hope to score a few points higher
tonight than they did in their
debut against Cal State-Fullerton,
for two reasons: "We put a little
more difficulty in some routines.
Also, the Northern California
judges are known to be a little less
tight [with points! than those
from Southern California," said
Greenwood.
In general, the Stanford team
seems very optimistic about
tonight's battle, despite their loss
to Cal State-Fullerton. "I was
pretty pleased with the way that

we did last week. We felt and
looked like a team, which is a big
switch from last year," Kanuka
said.
In terms of improvement, there
are some areas which the team
feels that they need to tackle. "We
have to get control of some
injuries that we have. We had had
a couple of tough breaks with
some of the girls getting hurt,"
Kanuka said. "Hopefully, we can
also eliminate the falls that we
had last weekend and score well."
Greenwood also agrees with
the sentiments of his team. "We
had an excellent first meet. The
girls did what they do in practice,
which is what we expected. It's
like practice with a crowd,"
Greenwood said.
According to Kanuka, "If we
can pull together, I think that we
have got it made. We have great
potential to do well this year."
While the Stanford women are
waging war in the North, the
Stanford men's gymnastics team
will be at home fighting for a win
as well. The Cardinal men, one of
the top teams in the Pac-10 if not
the country, will be hosting UC-
Santa Barbara tonight at Burham
Pavillion at 7:30 p.m.
