The Stanford baseball team lost the
heart of last year's lineup to the profes
sional ranks, but when it takes the field
tomorrow to open the 1991 campaign,
the Cardinal will be far from comatose.
Stanford is ranked No. 1 again in Col
legiate Baseball's preseason poll,
although coach Mark Marquess is wary
of predictions. The season starts with an
alumni doubleheader at Sunken Dia
mond.
An old-timers game will start the
action at noon, with an alumni game to
follow. The Cardinal begins the intercol
legiate season next Friday, hosting Santa
Clara at 2 p.m.
"We're really looking forward to get
ting out on the field," said sophomore
center fielder Jeffrey Hammonds, last
year's Collegiate Baseball Freshman of
the Year and a preseason All-American.
"The alumni game should be a lot of
fun."
Stanford went 59-12 last season and
finished the regular season ranked No. 1
before losing to Georgia in the College
World Series semifinal. But Hammonds
and the Cardinal are eager to show what
they can do this year.
"We have a different nucleus this
yean We're younger compared to last

year and we have a different attitude,"
Hammonds said.
"A poll doesn't mean anything until
you have the ring on your finger," he
continued. "You can't rely on what the
newspaper says."
Stanford returns seven players who
started in 1990, including headliner
Hammonds. First baseman David
McCarty, shortstop Roger Burnett and
catcher Troy Tallman played for the
United States national team in the off
season and will anchor the club. Ryan
Turner and Steve Solomon also return
in the outfield, along with junior David
Holbrook at third base.
Stanford still has holes to fill at sec
ond base and designated hitter, but the
biggest question mark is the pitching
staff. The Cardinal lost workhorses Stan
Spencer and Mike Mussina to the pro
ranks, but a deep staff of young pitchers
looks forward to filling the void.
"We're not the number one team in
the nation," warned Marquess, pointing
out that the Cardinal lost 280 innings
and 28 wins of pitching in Spencer and
Mussina. "You just can't replace that."
But with seniors John Reid and Scott
Weiss and sophomore Brian Sackinsky
stepping to the rubber, Stanford will be
in safe hands. The Cardinal should have
a deep pitching staff and continued good
defense.
