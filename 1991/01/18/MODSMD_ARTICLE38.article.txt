# Police prepared if protests get unruly
## 
### Howard Libit Staff writer 
While protests on campus
against the war in the Middle East
have been relatively calm, Stan
ford Police said they are prepared
to respond if demonstrations
become more violent.
"The protesters have been
peaceful and cooperative. There
has been no damage reported,"
said Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer. No arrests have been
made in demonstrations during
the past few days.
Police said they have moni
tored all rallies, assessing each sit
uation and reacting accordingly.
"We are kind of like firemen. If
a fire occurs, we will put it out,"
Niemeyer said. Protesters have
not notified police in advance of
any of their rallies.
The University normally does
not request any additional secu
rity from Stanford Police and has
not done so in the current situa
tion.
Niemeyer said, "The Univer
sity leaves the task (of security)
up to us. We assess the needs of
the community and monitor the
situation at all times."
Police are ready to respond if
war protesters change their tac
tics, Niemeyer said. As with other
police departments, Stanford
Police have riot plans, and officers
are standing by for emergencies,
he added.

Despite the possibility of cam
pus disruption and terrorist
attacks, police have not put any
extra officers on duty, but people
in many sectors of the University
said they have become more care
ftil.
"We have stepped up security,"
said Robert Planting, office assis
tant at the Hoover Institution.
"Everyone is paying more atten
tion to anything that may pose a
threat to the security of the schol
ars or the public safety."
No one at Hoover would com
ment further on increased secu
rity or the possibility of attacks by
terrorists or war protesters.
In case of a building takeover,
police would first attempt to per
suade protesters to leave volun
tarily. Depending upon the situa
tion and the location, police could
then arrest protesters to clear the
building.
Police cannot act if protesters
occupy a building while it is open
unless they prevent people from
entering and exiting.
"We have handled these inci
dents in the past and know what
we are doing," Niemeyer said.
A large, violent crowd of 500 or
more would be beyond the control
of Stanford police, forcing them to
notify the Santa Clara County
Sheriff's department and call for
aid from other police agencies,
Niemeyer said.
