# ASSU group hopes to check aid cutback
## 
### Anna Rabinowicz Staff writer 
A small group of students gath
ered last night at the ASSU offices
to form a committee to combat a
possible reduction of federal
financial aid as Congress re-evalu
ates the Higher Education Act
this year.
The act, originally passed in
1965, is the foundation of student
financial assistance and is re
examined every five years. The
improvement and existence of Pell
Grants, Stafford Loans and other
federal educational assistance
depend on its renewal.
Naomi Onaga, the ASSU sena
tor organizing the student com
mittee, said it will plan a regional
conference in April to lobby for
federal financial aid before a panel
of California senators, U.S. Repre
sentatives and Gov. Pete Wilson.
This conference will probably be
at Stanford and will include par
ticipants from UC-Davis, UC-
Berkeley, UCLA and the 107-
member Community Colleges
Association, Onaga said.
"Everyone's clawing for all this
federal funding. If students aren't
going to lobby, how are we going to
get money for education?" Onaga
asked.
Because of the reduction of Pell
Grants in 1986, when the act was
last evaluated, 70 percent of stu
dents who need grants are not
receiving them and have to take

out loans, according to Tfoel Shah,
vice president of the United States
Student Association. His student
run grassroots organization rep
resents over 300 campuses and
lobbies in Washington D.C. Shah
attended last night's meeting.
The Stanford committee will
also lobby for simplification of
financial aid applications, an
increase of grants, the continua
tion of work-study programs and
minority scholarships.
Onaga said the purpose of the
committee is to raise awareness
on campus about the decline of
federal aid as well as utilize Stan
ford as a lobby base for writing let
ters and telephoning members of
Congress.
The national student associa
tion will hold a conference March
15-18 in Washington, D.C. At that
time, students will testify before
two congressional committees on
higher education in an attempt to
influence Congress' vote on the
act. In past years, Stanford has
sent four representatives to this
conference, which Onaga said she
hopes will happen this year.
The Congressional vote will
occur in November or December,
Shah said.
Onaga attributed the meeting's
low turnout of only six students to
President Bush's 6 p.m. address
on the Persian Gulf situation,
which kept many glued to their
television sets.
