# Academic secretary Arthur Coladarci dies at age 73
## 
### 
Prof. Arthur Coladarci, academic secre
tary to the University and former dean of
the School of Education, died Wednesday
during heart valve replacement surgery at
Stanford Hospital. Coladarci was 73.
Of the many roles he served during his
39 years at Stanford — teacher, researcher,
psychologist and administrator —
Coladarci was perhaps best known as the
academic secretary, who coordinates the
meetings of the Faculty Senate. After
assuming this position in 1988, Coladarci
developed a large following of avid readers
for his comical style of writing the senate's
minutes.
In recent minutes, for example,
Coladarci noted, "President Donald

Kennedy, being absent, had nothing to
report; for the same reason, he did not
invite and answer questions."
While Coladarci served at the School of
Education, his similar hallway postings of
faculty meeting minutes would attract
crowds of readers.
Senate chair Charles Kruger, professor
of mechanical engineering, described
Coladarci's amusingly written minutes as
"enlightening and entertaining."
"[He was] a marvelous person and a
delightful colleague who brought the Sen
ate and the University a rare combination
of wisdom and humor," Kruger said.
Though he assumed the position of aca
demic secretary at the age of 70, Coladarci

embraced the job with vigor. "I have the
opportunity to do minutes in a humorous
style," he said. "I eryoy it because I can
spend a lot of time talking to people and
find out what they mean. I've never heard
any complaints with my minutes."
Provost James Rosse called Coladarci's
death "a great loss. His friends will miss the
great wisdom and wit that he brought to all
of his activities," Rosse said. "We will all
miss him as a good and stalwart friend."
Before coming to Stanford in 1952,
Coladarci was deeply involved with educa
tional research. He later headed the Stan
ford International Development Education
Center. He became associate dean of the
School of Education in 1967, acting dean in

1970 and was appointed dean in 1971.
When Coladarci left his deanship in 1979
to return to teaching, the School of Educa
tion was ranked "preeminent" in its field in
a national survey of scholars.
He was the author of "Educational Psy
chology" and the first volume of the
"Japanese Handbook of Educational Psy
chology."
After graduating from Western Con
necticut State College in 1940, he attended
Yale University, where received his mas
ter's in 1947 and his doctorate in 1950. He
also did graduate work at New York Univer
sity and Johns Hopkins University.
Coladarci is survived by his wife and two
children.
