# Several profs, propose canceling classes
## 
### Michael Friedly Editorial staff 
A group of professors presented Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy with
a letter yesterday proposing the cancel
lation of classes next Tuesday and
Wednesday in response the Persian Gulf
war.
Instead of holding classes, the profes
sors have planned meetings in which
various issues related to the war will be
presented and discussed.
The letter was drafted by Feminist
Studies Assoc. Prof. Sylvia Yanagisako
and presented to Kennedy before his
appearance at the 3:00 p.m. gathering in
the Quad.
The professors planning the event
include Yanagisako, History Assoc. Prof.
Joel Beinin, Anthropology Asst. Prof.
Carol Delaney, English Assoc. Prof. San
dra Drake, History Prof. Estelle Freed
man, English Assoc. Prof. Regenia Gag
nier, Anthropology Asst. Prof. Akhil
Gupta and English Prof. Diane Middle
brook.
The planned activities would not be a
boycott of classes, Middlebrook said.
Instead, they would be an attempt to

"redirect the educational energies" of
students. " 'Boycott' is not a word that I
wanted to use because [the teach-in] is
not a punitive measure. 'Redirection' is
the word we're using." she said.
Many professors in a number of fields
could contribute to the discussion meet
ings, according to Delaney. English pro
fessors could analyze the language of
war, she said.
For example, while Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein speaks of spilling blood
in the Middle East, the United States
talks of surgical airstrikes, thereby
increasing the detachment of Americans
from the realities of war, Delaney said.
"I would very much like to know
more about the culture that we are both
defending and attacking," Middlebrook
said. She added that community mem
bers have "questions and fears that
need to be addressed" and that the
teach-in is "a vital first step in meeting
these needs."
Delaney said she thinks the daily rou
tine of students needs to be interrupted
so that they can begin to deal with the
issues surrounding the war. "I think
that business as usual is simply not
appropriate. This is clearly not business

as usual. People are being killed," she
said.
The History Department is already
planning to hold a teach-in Tuesday
afternoon in t>he basement of the His
tory building. Middle Eastern history as
it relates to the Gulf crisis will be dis
cussed.
At a meeting last night, members of
Stanford Students for Peace in the Mid
dle East drafted a letter to be presented
to Kennedy today proposing a teach-in
along the same lines as that of the fac
ulty request.
The student proposal includes a
number of possible workshops on topics
related to the war, including the history
of the Middle East, media coverage of
the events in the Gulf, the economics of
war, the draft and anti-Arab racism.
Both students and faculty said they
expect Kennedy to be receptive to the
idea of a teach-in. Student leaders,
including Council of Presidents member
Goodwin Liu and Students for Peace
member Kate Morris will meet with
Kennedy later this afternoon,
Morris said students will conduct the
teach-in regardless of University
approval.
