# Campbell seeks to cut off aid to Soviets
## 
### Miranda Doyle Staff writer 
Responding to the recent Soviet mili
tary crackdown in Lithuania, Rep. Tom
Campbell, R-Stanford, introduced legis
lation Tuesday to cut off proposed aid to
the Soviet Union as long as the Soviet
military maintains its presence there.
Campbell's bill, the Baltic Freedom
Act of 1991, would suspend the exten
sion of U.S. agricultural credits to the
Soviet Union until the Soviet military
presence in the three republics is
reduced to its Jan. 1 level.

"We must let the Soviet Union know
that a step backward in human rights
and political freedom in the Baltics will
mean a step backward in the economic
assistance it can expect from the United
States," Campbell wrote in a statement.
Sunday, the Soviet military took over
the television station in the indepen
dence-minded Lithuania. Fourteen peo
ple are known dead and 230 were
injured in the fighting.
The legislation is also intended to
pressure the Soviet Union to refrain
from similar crackdowns in the other
two Baltic republics, Estonia and
Latvia.

Soviet commandos stormed a Latvian
police academy Tuesday, seizing guns
and grenade launchers. Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev has repeatedly spo
ken out against the pro-independence
forces, saying they are violating the
Soviet Constitution.
"The people of the Soviet Union will
know their food lines are a little longer
because of what their leaders have done
in Lithuania," wrote Campbell. "And
they will know that similar brutality in
Estonia or Latvia will dash hopes of the
United States helping to shorten those
lines in the near future."
