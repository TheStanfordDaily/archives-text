# Jewish community here concerned about relatives

Claw around 10 p.m. last night to talk
about their feelings.
"Had there been greater casualties, or
[an Israeli] retaliation, we'd have some
very pressing issues to discuss," he said.
Cartun said Jewish students need to
talk to other Jews. The attack on Israel
"sets the Jewish student apart," he said.
Beginning at noon today, he will hold dis
cussions in Hillel's center in Old Union
every Friday for anyone who wants to
discuss the war.
"We would welcome non-Jews step
ping forward to understand and commis
erate [with us]," he said.
"I'm worried for my people," said
sophomore Candace Rosen. But she and
other students said that feeling was not
limited to Jewish people.
"I don't think you have to be Jewish
to share the suffering of civilians,"
Dobrin said.
Kennedy agreed, saying that aside
from her concern for relatives in Israel,
she did not find being Jewish lent any
slant to her feelings about the situation.
Speaking about what he called Iraq's
unprovoked attack on a non-aggressive
country, Cartun said he would like to see
other countries besides the United
States and Britain condemn the raid.
Several Jewish students said they felt
the attack was "definitely" an effort to
prod Israel into the war with Iraq. Rosen
hypothesized that if Israel retaliates,
other Arab nations will be hesitant to
side with the United States and Israel.
Dobrin agreed the region might
become unstable if Israel retaliates, but
was confident about cooperation
between Israel and the United States.
"The fact that the Israelis didn't take
any preemptive action against Iraq ...
speaks well for the Israeli commitment
to the [United States]," he said.

As they gathered around television
sets last night, many members of Stan
ford's Jewish community felt a special
anxiety as they listened to reports of
Iraq's missile attack on Israeli cities.
Rabbi Ari Cartun of the Stanford
chapter of Hillel, the Jewish student
organization, said people in the Jewish
community share a concern for relatives
and friends in Israel and a sense that the
"historical insane wrath of Jew-haters"
has struck again.
Assoc. University Counsel Robin
Kennedy has a cousin living in a suburb
northeast of Tel Aviv. "Until we knew
there hadn't been any deaths there, I
was scared to death," she said.
Even with reports of minimal injuries
in Israel, "one can't relax," said the wife
of University President Donald
Kennedy. She said she plans to remain
glued to her television as long as she can
stay awake.
Senior Joe Dobrin said his first reac
tion to last night's attack was to worry
"about the danger presented to the pop
ulation there." He was particularly anx
ious about the safety of friends he had
made at Tel Aviv University during the
quarter he spent in Israel in the fall of
1989.
Junior David Silver, who is active in
Hillel and other Jewish community
groups said he and other Jewish stu
dents, because of their attachment to
Israel through friends and relatives,
were more emotional about the news
than non-Jewish students.
"There was a lot of relief when we
found out the casualties were light," he
said.
Silver and a few other Jewish stu
dents decided to meet informally at the
