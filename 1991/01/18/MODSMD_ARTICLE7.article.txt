# Discussion of war dominates classes
## 
### Sarah Morisseau Staff Writer 
Thoughts and concerns about
the outbreak of war in the Middle
East were carried over into the
classroom yesterday as many pro
fessors scrapped their usual les
son plans in favor of discussing
Wednesday night's events.
In his America Since 1945
class, History Prof. Barton Bern
stein lectured on the Truman
Doctrine, law and order, the
United States as a dominant actor
in the United Nations, the role of
oil, the emphasis on God and the
army as a road of social mobility
for poor people.
The events of the coming week
end will "determine whether we
return to the normal lecture on
Tuesday," he said. "Undoubtedly,
I'll spend the last day or two of the
quarter on the war.
Psychology Prof. Felicia Pratto
canceled the planned lecture in
Introduction to Social Psychology

to give students a place to discuss
their feelings about the events in
the Middle East.
"Students volunteered their
own reactions, and I tried to pro
vide some framework on how psy
chologists viewed this," she said.
Because part of the course cov
ers inter-group conflict, Pratto
said she will discuss the war in
that context. "[The war] just came
a little earlier than my syllabus
was ready for," she said.
Freshman Emily McChesney
said her Arabic class hasn't
learned much grammar lately,
spending more time on the war. It
has especially helped her under
stand the Arab point of view, she
said.
"We haven't been doing much
Arabic — we've been talking
about the Gulf crisis. [Prof. Khalil
Barhoum] has relatives in Jordan,
and I think there are a lot of Iraqis
and Muslims in the class."
