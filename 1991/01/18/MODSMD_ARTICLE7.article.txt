# Discussion of war dominates classes
## 
### Sarah Morisseau Staff Writer 
Thoughts and concerns about
the outbreak of war in the Middle
East were carried over into the
classroom yesterday as many pro
fessors scrapped their usual les
son plans in favor of discussing
Wednesday night's events.
In his America Since 1945
class, History Prof. Barton Bern
stein lectured on the Truman
Doctrine, law and order, the
United States as a dominant actor
in the United Nations, the role of
oil, the emphasis on God and the
army as a road of social mobility
for poor people.
The events of the coming week
end will "determine whether we
return to the normal lecture on
Tuesday," he said. "Undoubtedly,
I'll spend the last day or two of the
quarter on the war.
Psychology Prof. Felicia Pratto
canceled the planned lecture in
Introduction to Social Psychology

to give students a place to discuss
their feelings about the events in
the Middle East.
"Students volunteered their
own reactions, and I tried to pro
vide some framework on how psy
chologists viewed this," she said.
Because part of the course cov
ers inter-group conflict, Pratto
said she will discuss the war in
that context. "[The war] just came
a little earlier than my syllabus
was ready for," she said.
Freshman Emily McChesney
said her Arabic class hasn't
learned much grammar lately,
spending more time on the war. It
has especially helped her under
stand the Arab point of view, she
said.
"We haven't been doing much
Arabic — we've been talking
about the Gulf crisis. [Prof. Khalil
Barhoum] has relatives in Jordan,
and I think there are a lot of Iraqis
and Muslims in the class."

Following his address In the Quad, University President Donald Kennedy was confronted by anti-war
protestors on his walk back to Building 10.
Erin Clune, a senior in the
same course, said, "It was very
silent today in class. We all tried to
concentrate on the work to keep
our minds off the war."
Clime, who spent the past year
in Israel, said she feels the war is a
"very real concern for people in
the class."
"Everyone is really worried
about the collapse of nations over
there and the fact that America
doesn't realize that this upset will
probably occur," McChesney said.
McChesney works for a woman
who has relatives fighting in the
Gulf. "I'm getting the entire war
from her perspective ... and the
Arabic class has taught me a lot of
the issues involved on the other
side," she said.
Freshman Stephanie Huie is in
a Spanish class that related the
"Games and Diversions" chapter
in the textbook to the Middle East
situation.
"We had to make up rules,

decide who were the players, what
our aims were and what kind of
things we would need," she said.
Glynnh Young, a section leader
for the Philosophy Cultures, Ideas
and Values track, said she allotted
time in her sections to talk about
the conflict. "We talked about
whether we should be there or
not, when it is justified to use
force. I tried to integrate philo
sophical issues with current
events," she explained.
Edward Frueh, a section
leader for in the Great Works CIV
track, plans on integrating the
war into his discussion section
today. "We have been studying the
Koran and 'The Conference of the
Birds,' both Islamic texts. Consid
ering we're doing Islam, I think
we nave to talk about these
issues," he said. Frueh said he
also plans to discuss the issue of
the draft.
Freshman Michelle Dicks said
the first hour and a half of her
Wednesday afternoon Values,
Technology, Science and Society
section was related to the situa
tion in the Middle East. "It's

Many students said
their classes were let
out early or canceled
altogether.

really ironic that everything said
was a 'what if and at that very
moment we were bombing Iraq.
We had no idea what was going
on," she said.
Dicks also said her VTSS lec
ture was opened up as a forum for
discussing Gulf issues.
The influence of war was not
limited to lectures and discus
sions. Many students said their
classes were let out early or can
celed altogether.
"In my CIV section Wednesday
night, we discussed the war and
then we left early because we all
wanted to watch" the news, said
freshman Debby Wells.
"My CIV section was right by
(yesterday's) gathering in the
Quad, and most people never
made it to section, so it was can

celed," said freshman Eileen Tse.
"None of my classes have been
let out early, but my calculus pro
fessor (Richard Sommer) did say if
we wanted to come late or leave
early for rallies, that's okay," said
sophomore Jesse Dorogusker.
"The main thing I was saying
there was that I support any stu
dent who takes part in any
demonstration of any kind," Som
mer said. He added that his office
hours could be used to explain lec
tures missed in order to attend
rallies and vigils.
Dorogusker also added that
another of his professors said he
had considered canceling class,
but decided it would not do any
good.
Freshman Todd Mensing said
his Great Works section leader
"sets aside a lot of time to talk
about the war. She lets us out
early to attend rallies and vigils. I
think she's very sensitive to the
war."
"I think the whole Great Works
staff has lessened our reading load
so we can read materials on the
war," he added.

track, plans on integrating the
war into his discussion section
today. "We have been studying the
Koran and 'The Conference of the
Birds,' both Islamic texts. Consid
ering we're doing Islam, I think
we nave to talk about these
issues," he said. Frueh said he
also plans to discuss the issue of
the draft.
Freshman Michelle Dicks said
the first hour and a half of her
Wednesday afternoon Values,
Technology, Science and Society
section was related to the situa

really ironic that everything said
was a 'what if and at that very
moment we were bombing Iraq.
We had no idea what was going
on," she said.
Dicks also said her VTSS lec
ture was opened up as a forum for
discussing Gulf issues.
The influence of war was not
limited to lectures and discus
sions. Many students said their
classes were let out early or can
celed altogether.
"In my CIV section Wednesday
night, we discussed the war and
then we left early because we all
wanted to watch" the news, said
freshman Debby Wells.
"My CIV section was right by
(yesterday's) gathering in the
Quad, and most people never
made it to section, so it was can

celed," said freshman Eileen Tse.
"None of my classes have been
let out early, but my calculus pro
fessor (Richard Sommer) did say if
we wanted to come late or leave
early for rallies, that's okay," said
sophomore Jesse Dorogusker.
"The main thing I was saying
there was that I support any stu
dent who takes part in any
demonstration of any kind," Som
mer said. He added that his office
hours could be used to explain lec
tures missed in order to attend
rallies and vigils.
Dorogusker also added that
another of his professors said he
had considered canceling class,
but decided it would not do any
good.
Freshman Todd Mensing said
his Great Works section leader
"sets aside a lot of time to talk
about the war. She lets us out
early to attend rallies and vigils. I
think she's very sensitive to the
war."
"I think the whole Great Works
staff has lessened our reading load
so we can read materials on the
war," he added.
Thoughts and concerns about
the outbreak of war in the Middle
East were carried over into the
classroom yesterday as many pro
fessors scrapped their usual les
son plans in favor of discussing
Wednesday night's events.
In his America Since 1945
class, History Prof. Barton Bern
stein lectured on the Truman
Doctrine, law and order, the
United States as a dominant actor
in the United Nations, the role of
oil, the emphasis on God and the
army as a road of social mobility
for poor people.
The events of the coming week
end will "determine whether we
return to the normal lecture on
Tuesday," he said. "Undoubtedly,
I'll spend the last day or two of the
quarter on the war.
Psychology Prof. Felicia Pratto
canceled the planned lecture in
Introduction to Social Psychology

to give students a place to discuss
their feelings about the events in
the Middle East.
"Students volunteered their
own reactions, and I tried to pro
vide some framework on how psy
chologists viewed this," she said.
Because part of the course cov
ers inter-group conflict, Pratto
said she will discuss the war in
that context. "[The war] just came
a little earlier than my syllabus
was ready for," she said.
Freshman Emily McChesney
said her Arabic class hasn't
learned much grammar lately,
spending more time on the war. It
has especially helped her under
stand the Arab point of view, she
said.
"We haven't been doing much
Arabic — we've been talking
about the Gulf crisis. [Prof. Khalil
Barhoum] has relatives in Jordan,
and I think there are a lot of Iraqis
and Muslims in the class."


Chris Elsenberg — Daily
Following his address In the Quad, University President Donald Kennedy was confronted by anti-war
protestors on his walk back to Building 10.
Erin Clune, a senior in the
same course, said, "It was very
silent today in class. We all tried to
concentrate on the work to keep
our minds off the war."
Clime, who spent the past year
in Israel, said she feels the war is a
"very real concern for people in
the class."
"Everyone is really worried
about the collapse of nations over
there and the fact that America
doesn't realize that this upset will
probably occur," McChesney said.
McChesney works for a woman
who has relatives fighting in the
Gulf. "I'm getting the entire war
from her perspective ... and the
Arabic class has taught me a lot of
the issues involved on the other
side," she said.
Freshman Stephanie Huie is in
a Spanish class that related the
"Games and Diversions" chapter
in the textbook to the Middle East
situation.
"We had to make up rules,

decide who were the players, what
our aims were and what kind of
things we would need," she said.
Glynnh Young, a section leader
for the Philosophy Cultures, Ideas
and Values track, said she allotted
time in her sections to talk about
the conflict. "We talked about
whether we should be there or
not, when it is justified to use
force. I tried to integrate philo
sophical issues with current
events," she explained.
Edward Frueh, a section
leader for in the Great Works CIV
track, plans on integrating the
war into his discussion section
today. "We have been studying the
Koran and 'The Conference of the
