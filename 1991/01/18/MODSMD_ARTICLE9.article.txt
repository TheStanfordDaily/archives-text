# Students stage White Plaza 'die-in'
## 
### Marie Bui Staff writer 
Clint McClintic, a 62-year Palo Alto
resident, pedaled five miles from his
house on Dana Avenue to the Stanford
campus to join yesterday's noontime
rally. But he never got as far as White
Plaza.
He stopped at the bodies of five stu
dents, spattered and dripping with red
syrup.
The "die-in," staged at 11:30 a.m. in
three locations near White Plaza, was
conceived by a group of students who
attended a midnight meeting Wednes
day in Tresidder Union to discuss
responses to the war.
Inviting passers-by to join them,
organizers aimed to "reduce the dis
tance between us here at this utopic,
sunny campus and people who are suf
fering," said Lisa Whitmore, a first-year
graduate student.
"We're not trying to be sensationalis
ts," she continued, "but to make people
think about something that is so distant
from us."
By noon, 14 students, some dressed

in olive green fatigues or camouflage
pants, were lying on the pavement of
three busy intersections â€” near the
clock tower, the Bookstore and Old
Union. Occasionally, one of the bodies
would raise an arm and ask people to
join in and "die," too. Most bystanders
bicycled around or stepped between the
sticky bodies.
Senior Pamela Huberman, who was
handing out fliers by the Bookstore, said
there was enough room for the "dead"
students to be visible among the pedes
trians walking by. She said the symbolic
gesture, although gruesome and dis
turbing, was less disruptive and more
effective than Tuesday's protests that
closed bridges in San Francisco.
But freshman David Raymond criti
cized the gesture. "When people over
there see this, they're gonna think their
country doesn't support them any
more." Two of Raymond's friends are
currently serving in Saudi Arabia.
Senior Erica Webber, who partici
pated in the "die-in," disagreed.
"I don't see why, when we're lying
there with fatigues and blood, they
think we don't support the soldiers,"

she said.
She said the participants represented
soldiers and civilians of many nationali
ties.
Senior Jason Palm said it was diffi
cult to feel any emotion for the "dead"
students.
"I know it's fake, but if it were real,
I'd probably throw up."
A campus tour guide flippantly
remarked there were more casualties
than usual in White Plaza. Spotting a
student lying by the Claw, one visitor
asked, "Is he protesting or suntan
ning?"
A group of sixth graders from a local
elementary school shuffled around the
bodies. They're protesting lives spent
for oil, "young lives," said 11-year-old
Alicia Van Housen. Her classmate Erika
Smooker said the demonstrators were
showing "too many people get killed.
How can you win a war if you're dead?"
At the clock tower, McClintic beat a
somber death-knell on a drum he made
himself. An artist, he said images like
the "dead" students are needed.
He said that television coverage
"makes this look like a video game "
