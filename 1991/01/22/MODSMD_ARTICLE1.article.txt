# WAR IN THE GULF
## More Scuds are deflected; long campaign seen 
### 
DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) — The mil
lion-dollar Patriot missile flashed into action
again early today, blasting at least two Iraqi
Scuds out of the Saudi skies. The allies pressed
their air advantage amid predictions it will be
weeks before the ground campaign begins.
U.S. officials warned that Iraq's military
machine — the fourth-largest army in the
world, with 545,000 troops entrenched across
southern Iraq and Kuwait — is far from bro
ken despite a punishing pounding by allied
bombers.
Patriots were used to deflect today's early
morning attack on the Saudi capital of Riyadh
and the eastern port city of Dhahran. Debris
from missiles crashed near the Dhahran Inter
national Hotel and onto a street in Riyadh, 270
miles to the southwest. No casualties were
reported.
The barrage was the latest in a series of
Iraqi missile attacks. It fired 10 Scud missiles
into Saudi Arabia late Sunday and early Mon
day. U.S. Patriot air defense missiles destroyed
nine and one fell harmlessly into the gulf,
according to U.S. officials.
U.S. fliers were heartened by the daring res
cue of a downed pilot from Iraqi territory yes
terday. An Air Force search-and-rescue heli
copter picked up the A-6 Intruder pilot, who
bailed out into a featureless expanse of desert
after being hit by ground fire.
During the nerve-rattling rescue, an Iraqi
army truck headed toward the stranded air
man, but the ground support bombers raked it
with fire.
"It is really exciting — the fact that you
think the guy is going to get rescued," said
Capt. Randy Goff, 26, of Jackson, Ohio, who
participated in the rescue. "My mind was just
rushing."
The Pentagon, however, refused to discuss
the incident.

The withering air strikes
against Iraq are the only tirst
stage of a battle that could
later lead to a bloody ground
war.
Military analysts say air
attacks must be aimed at
roads, supply depots, commu
nications links, and missile and
antiaircraft sites before a land
war can be waged with minimal
losses.
However, bad weather has
hampered the air assault.
Today, thick fog enveloped
Dhahran, an eastern port city
that is the site of a huge air
base. Cloud cover over Iraq has
been a continuing problem.
The Pentagon also says Iraq
has been using decoys to foil
attacks on modified Scud mis
sile launchers, a prime target.
So far, 16 allied warplanes
have been lost in combat,
including nine U.S. aircraft.
Twenty-two allied fliers are
missing in action, including 13
Americans, the Pentagon says.
President Bush responded
with cold fury to Iraq's
announcement Monday that it
would scatter captured allied
pilots at potential target sites
in a bid to stem the allied air
assault.
"This is not going to make a
difference in the prosecution of
the war" against Iraqi Presi
dent Saddam Hussein, he said.
For U.S. pilots, word that
their captured comrades were
being paraded on Iraqi televi

sion and coerced into making
anti-U.S. statements struck
close to home.
"We will hit 'em harder and
make him pay for every viola
tion of decency," said Air Force
A-10 pilot Capt. Mike O'Dowd
of Bergen field, N.J.
Defense Department
spokesman Pete Williams said
Monday the Pentagon will
delay announcements about
American planes being
downed. By divulging that, he
said, the military could be
informing the Iraqis of some
thing they might not have
known for sure, possibly pre
venting the downed crew's
escape.
The Pentagon has also
refused to give specific damage
estimates in the fighting so far,
citing intelligence secrets or
weather problems in the Per
sian Gulf.
"You've got to remember
that we're in a war," Army Lt.
Gen. Thomas Kelly told a Pen
tagon briefing yesterday.
"You've got to remember there
is another side in this war."
The military also said it
would no longer release per
sonal information or reveal the
hometowns of missing service
personnel. The Defense
Department will give out only
the names, ranks, ages and
branch of service of anyone
who might be a prisoner of war
in Iraq, said Maj. Kathy White,
a spokeswoman for the Tactical
Air Command headquarters.
"Because of our experience
in Vietnam, we found that this
is stuff (captors) can use
against them," Ms. White said.
