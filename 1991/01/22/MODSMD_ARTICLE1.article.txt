# WAR IN THE GULF
## More Scuds are deflected; long campaign seen 
### 
DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) — The mil
lion-dollar Patriot missile flashed into action
again early today, blasting at least two Iraqi
Scuds out of the Saudi skies. The allies pressed
their air advantage amid predictions it will be
weeks before the ground campaign begins.
U.S. officials warned that Iraq's military
machine — the fourth-largest army in the
world, with 545,000 troops entrenched across
southern Iraq and Kuwait — is far from bro
ken despite a punishing pounding by allied
bombers.
Patriots were used to deflect today's early
morning attack on the Saudi capital of Riyadh
and the eastern port city of Dhahran. Debris
from missiles crashed near the Dhahran Inter
national Hotel and onto a street in Riyadh, 270
miles to the southwest. No casualties were
reported.
The barrage was the latest in a series of
Iraqi missile attacks. It fired 10 Scud missiles
into Saudi Arabia late Sunday and early Mon
day. U.S. Patriot air defense missiles destroyed
nine and one fell harmlessly into the gulf,
according to U.S. officials.
U.S. fliers were heartened by the daring res
cue of a downed pilot from Iraqi territory yes
terday. An Air Force search-and-rescue heli
copter picked up the A-6 Intruder pilot, who
bailed out into a featureless expanse of desert
after being hit by ground fire.
During the nerve-rattling rescue, an Iraqi
army truck headed toward the stranded air
man, but the ground support bombers raked it
with fire.
"It is really exciting — the fact that you
think the guy is going to get rescued," said
Capt. Randy Goff, 26, of Jackson, Ohio, who
participated in the rescue. "My mind was just
rushing."
The Pentagon, however, refused to discuss
the incident.
