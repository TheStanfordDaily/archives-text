# WAR IN THE GULF
## Airport tightens its security SFO increases police patrols, X-ray scrutiny 
### Mike Laris Staff writer 
While fear of increased terrorism due to the war
in the Persian Gulf has led San Francisco Interna
tional Airport officials to increase security, many Bay
Area passengers say flying in wartime doesn't worry
them.
"I feel confident. We're on the other side of the
world. If there would be any trouble, it would be over
the Atlantic," said Liz Smith, who was traveling to
Hawaii yesterday.
Wayne Spinner, whose parents were arriving from
St. Louis, said, "As soon as they heard about the
additional security, they were a little bit leery. In
fact, they talked about canceling," he said. "But I
said, 'Aye. No need.'"
To guard against possible terrorist attacks, air
port officials have canceled curb-side baggage check
in, barred persons without tickets from going to the
gates, increased police patrols and X-ray scrutiny of
baggage and removed all post office boxes from the
airport to deter mail-bomb attacks.
Loud-speakers also periodically warn, "This is a
security advisory. Please maintain possession of your
belongings at all times. Unattended property will be
confiscated and destroyed."
The threat of terrorism also has bomb-sniffing
dogs patrolling with greater frequency, according to

Airport officials have canceled
curb-side baggage check-in and
barred persons without tickets
from going to the gates.

checks suspicious or unattended cars and packages
with his canine, Marko.
"Normally, I don't get but one or two calls a day.
Last night, I got eight," he said.
"We have technicians that will remove the item if
it is real," he said. He added that precautions were
taken against a similar threat after the United
States bombed Libya, but there were no incidents at
that time.
Bob Herrschaft of Pan American World Airways'
baggage office said, "We feel good about having the
dogs around."
Stephen Tam, who was seeing relatives off to
Hong Kong and New Orleans, said, "If I tell you
there are no concerns, it would be a lie."
But, according to Spinner, who was still waiting
for his parents near the ticketing desks, "It seems
like any other day." Except, he said, "There are no
chairs for waiting out here."
