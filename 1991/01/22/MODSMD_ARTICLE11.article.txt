While some of the more out
spoken groups on campus in
recent days stand against the
war in the Middle East, many
students support President
Bush's actions and the Ameri
can troops fighting there.
"I have to support them
because they are defending me
and the American way. How
can you not support them?"
asked junior Alex Accetta. "It
makes me mad because people
don't understand that just
because I support Bush doesn't
mean I don't want peace."
"I want peace, not war," said

sophomore Keith Harrison,
"but it's a necessary evil in this
case."
Sophomore Matt Heine said
he was sad about the war but
still backed the President's
actions. "It's always sad to see
my own peers at war, but they
are fighting for our country,"
he said. "Bush took the right
action at the right time; he did
the right thing."
The recent parading of
American prisoners of war
shown on Iraqi television has,
according to Heine, "escalated
the war from the Allies trying
to get [Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein] out of Kuwait into a per
sonal war between the Allies and
Iraq that oould lead to the com
plete destruction of Iraq."
Senior Mahir Shah believed
the display of prisoners was a
"pure [public relations] ploy"
aimed at scaring people in the
Allied nations.
Shah said he fully supports the
American action in the Middle
East. "The American force in
Saudi Arabia is justified in the
fact that it is trying to liberate a
sovereign state," he said. "The
American public is so wishy
washy. It's going to be a long haul,
but it has to be finished off."
Senior Keith Rabois, former
president of the Stanford College
Republicans, expressed strong
support for Bush. "I'm very
excited that President Bush took
the action that he did. I believe
that America had to do something

to neutralize Hussein. It's better
to (Jo this now while his weapons
are not yet well developed," he
said.
Rabois also said he believes
that Israel should defend itself
from further attack. "Personally,
I think that Israel should retali
ate because they would do a bet
ter job since their country is more
at risk and that makes them more
motivated."
"Also, in the future, Israeli
retaliation would scare away ene
mies of Israel and cause Arab
leaders to hesitate before attack
ing Israel again," he added.
Junior Kevin Warsh has differ
ent feelings about what Israel
should do. "It would be best if
Israel put itself under the Ameri
can umbrella," he said. "The
damage done by Iraqi missiles
was slight; Israel should wait
until Iraq does something worse.
By staying under American lead
ership, the international coalition
against Iraq would be main
tained."
