# Residential Affairs responds to war concerns
## 
### Howard Libit Staff writer 
Administrators in the Office of Residential
Affairs met Friday morning to address con
cerns about the Persian Gulf war, ranging
from the possibility of terrorism to the diffi
culty of handling the war emotionally.
"The main purpose of this meeting was to
share information among ourselves," said
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Diana Conklin.
Officials reviewed plans in case of a bomb
threat, reminding themselves that the proper
response is to call police and evacuate the
building, Conklin said.
"(Stanford Police) Chief Marvin Herring
ton's advice was to use your head and rely
upon common sense," Conklin said. "We
would rather err on the side of caution."
Police emphasized that a bomb threat
against a student residence is extremely
unlikely, she added.
Counseling services available to students
were also discussed at the meeting. Cowell
Student Health Center, Counseling and Psy
chological Services, Memorial Church and

other offices plan to offer psychological assis
tance to students.
Residential Affairs will place an advertise
ment in The Daily this week listing available
services, Conklin said.
• The Office of Student Affairs will serve as
the central point for collecting information.
Conklin said the main information sources for
students in upcoming weeks will be The Daily,
KZSU and electronic mail.
Residential Affairs also wants to create a
drop-in center for students to serve as a cen
tral meeting place during the Persian Gulf
war, Conklin said.
Resident assistants and resident fellows
were encouraged to review the campus disrup
tion policy in the Student Handbook in case
students have questions.
Officials also discussed concerns about the
effects of a war on student emotions.
"There is a possibility of increased student
to-student hostilities. We do not want to see
students turn on each other," Conklin said.
"We will help students wherever we can in
whatever ways possible to express their emo
tions."

'There is a possibility of
increased student-to-stu
dent hostilities. We do not
want to see students turn
on each other,'

The mtgority of the meeting was devoted to
allowing people to express their own feelings
about the situation.
"We discussed how to handle feelings and
find ways to express them. We also considered
how to help all students, regardless of their
feelings on the crisis," Conklin said.
A "real productive" conversation produced
many "concrete" suggestions, Conklin said.
The group — consisting of residence deans
and other administrators from the Office of
Residential Education, the Housing Center
and the Graduate Housing office — usually
meets once per quarter. Last Friday's meeting
was a special meeting called in response to the
Persian Gulf war.
