# Military searches 'big time' for Scuds

WASHINGTON (AP) - Iraq is
using decoys to thwart allied
efforts to wipe out Scud missile
launchers, Pentagon officials said
yesterday, while congressional
sources said the campaign was
being hampered by persistent hos
tile fire as well.
"They do use decoys and they
use them well," Lt. Gen. Thomas
Kelly told reporters at a Pentagon
briefing. He said allied warplanes
are working "big time" to take
out the remaining launch sites,
which Iraq has used to fire rockets
into Israel and Saudi Arabia.
He cited bad weather as ham
pering the operation, and said the
Iraqis' use of decoys was "some
what of a problem. I can't quan
tify it."
Navy Rear Adm. John
McConnell said that despite the
massive air operation — 8,100
sorties in the five-day war — Sad
dam Hussein and the military
command are "still in control of
military activity in the country."
Even so, Pentagon spokesman
Pete Williams said Operation
Desert Storm is "going more or
less according to plan," and Kelly
said he believed that a protracted
ground war could still be avoided
as the allies press their campaign
to evict Iraqi forces from Kuwait.
Kelly disclosed that Iraq had
fired one additional Scud missile
toward Saudi Arabia a short while
earlier, but said it landed harm
lessly in the Persian Gulf.
Later, witnesses in Riyadh, the
Saudi capital, reported seeing
what appeared to be another Scud
interception by a Patriot missile
high over the city. There was no
immediate confirmation by mili

tary authorities.
The military has said earlier
that nine out of 10 previous Scud
missiles firings into Saudi Arabia
before yesterday were shot down
by American-made Patriot mis
siles. The other one also landed in
the water.
In other news from Saudi Ara
bia, pilots of A-10 "Warthog" Air
Force ground attack planes
reported escorting a helicopter in
an eight-hour operation that
ended with the successful rescue
of the pilot of a Navy A-6 bomber
after an A-10 destroyed a truck
headed for the downed pilot's
location.
Kelly continued to provide an
upbeat assessments of the war,
but he repeatedly refused to give
specific damage estimates or pro
vide answers to other types of
questions. Sometimes he cited
weather constraints on intelli
gence gathering, and sometimes
he didn't. At one point, he said:
"You've got to remember that
we're in a war. You've got to
remember there is another side in
this war."
Kelly said that once pilots get
close to Scud targets, they gener
ally can tell which ones are decoys.
A knowledgeable Pentagon officer
said Saddam has been known to
use wooden decoys that mock the
silhouette of the mobile and fixed
Scud missile launchers.
Kelly disclosed that the num
ber of American forces in Opera
tion Desert Storm had swelled to
472,000, an increase of 7,000 over
the weekend. He said nine Ameri
can warplanes had been lost, and
14 American troops were listed as
missing in action.

now on station in Israel and Saudi Arabia to protect against incom
