# Yeltsin blasts Gorbachev for crackdown
## 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) â€” Russia's presi
dent, Boris Yeltsin, accused Mikhail
Gorbachev yesterday of abandoning
democracy and called for an investiga
tion of the defense and interior minis
ters for the military crackdown in the
Baltic republics.
Yeltsin, a frequent Gorbachev critic,
told the Supreme Soviet legislature of
his Russian federation that the Kremlin
had veered from its peaceful course in
favor of "violence and pressure."
Gorbachev has amassed so much
power, he said, "you can't speak about
any democracy."
Yeltsin spoke one day after partici
pants opposing Gorbachev chanted
"resign" in the largest political rally in

Moscow in at least one year. Many
accused Gorbachev, the 1990 Nobel
Peace Prize winner, of responsibility for
the army attack in Lithuania on Jan. 13
in which 14 people died.
Gorbachev meanwhile confirmed he
will deliver the traditional Nobel Peace
Prize lecture in Oslo sometime in May,
Geir Lundestad, a member of the
awards panel, said yesterday.
Gorbachev did not attend the Dec. 10
peace prize ceremony because of eco
nomic, social and political problems in
the Soviet Union. Since then, some com
mittee members have expressed regret
that Gorbachev has allowed the Soviet
military to crack down on the indepen
dence-minded Baltic republics.

More deaths occurred Sunday night
in Riga, capital of neighboring Latvia,
when elite Soviet interior ministry
troops attacked the republic's Interior
Ministry building, killing five people
and wounding 10.
Yeltsin and Gorbachev have clashed
frequently on economic issues, but in
recent days the Russian leader has
expanded his criticism to include the
Kremlin's policy on ethnic conflicts.
A draft resolution on the Baltics pre
sented to the Russian Supreme Soviet
yesterday accuses Gorbachev of violat
ing the constitution by not guaranteeing
human rights or protecting a republic's
sovereignty.
