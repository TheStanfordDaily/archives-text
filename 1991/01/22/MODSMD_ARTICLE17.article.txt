Utah committee OKs anti-abortion bill
SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — A legislative committee with
stood the shouts of pro-choice advocates yesterday to
endorse and send to the state Senate a measure that would
make Utah the first state this year to outlaw most elective
abortions.
Abortion rights activists warned that the state could be
hit by a tourism boycott if the measure passed. Supporters
of the bill offered to defend it in court against any chal
lenges if it becomes law.
There was little doubt the Legislature would approve the
bill and send it to Gov. Norm Bangerter since 90 percent of
the state's 104 lawmakers are members of the Mormon
Church. The church teaches that abortion is a serious
transgression except in dire medical circumstances.
Supporters said the legislation could pass the Senate and
House as early as tomorrowday. The Senate Health Com
mittee endorsed it on a 4-1 vote, sending it to the Senate

floor for debate scheduled today, the 18th anniversary of
the U.S. Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing
abortion.
Pilot rescued from Iraqi desert
D HAH RAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) — In a daring dash into
enemy territory, a U.S. Air Force rescue mission plucked a
downed Navy pilot from the Iraqi desert yesterday and flew
him back to safety, military officials said.
An Air Force search-and-rescue helicopter picked up the
A-6 "Intruder" pilot shortly after two A-10 ground support
bombers strafed an Iraqi army truck headed straight
toward the airman, Air Force officers said.
"We could not allow him (the truck) to be there," said
Capt. Randy Goff, one of the A-10 "Warthog" pilots. "We
couldn't take the risk."
Military officials did not release the identity of the res
cued fiver.
