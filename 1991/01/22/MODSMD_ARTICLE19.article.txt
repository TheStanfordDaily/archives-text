## Showing concern 
### 
A balanced teach-in
is the right forum
to discuss war views

Today and tomorrow,
various concerned groups
plan to hold a teach-in deal
ing with the crisis in the Persian
Gulf. University President Donald
Kennedy has approved of the idea
of such an event, citing that the
war in the Persian Gulf is an
important issue about which stu
dents should be concerned, if they
aren't already.
That really isn't the question.
Everyone agrees that we should be
concerned when our government
commits resources and lives to a
war with a foreign country.
The more important question is
how we can best go about showing
our concern. More specifically, it is
important to agree on the ground
rules for conducting such a teach
in.
Some faculty members and stu
dents have pressed the University
to call off classes during the days of
the teach-in, arguing that this is an
issue of such importance that nor
mal University learning should be
interrupted.
While we agree that students
should learn more about the war in
the Gulf and the conflicting opin
ions regarding its soundness, we
don't believe that students have to
skip all their classes on Tuesday
and Wednesday to do so.
Many may interpret a cancella
tion of classes as a signal of a Uni
versity anti-war sentiment. Know
ing that the University is not ready
to take a stand either way on its
approval or disapproval of the Gulf
War, Kennedy has not canceled
classes for the teach-in.
However, he has appropriately

urged professors to be lenient
toward students who miss class to
attend the teach-in. He has also
urged professors to address the
war if students so choose wherever
appropriate in class.
Given the situation, Kennedy's
stand is an admirable one. In addi
tion to protecting the University's
unformed opinion on the war, his
choice protects the opinions of stu
dents who have differing views on
the relative importance of the war
and the need to learn more.
Hopefully, the organizers and
participants in the teach-in will be
as fair. For the best possible out
come, the teach-in needs to be
level-headed and balanced. An
anti-war rally disguised in the form
of a teach-in stands to further
alienate protesters from the people
they are most fervently trying to
convince.
Even having both pro-war and
anti-war factions present at the
teach-in, the organizers need to
carefully control the discussion so
that it truly is an intelligent
debate. This is the sort of event the
University is sanctioning, and the
only type which can truly be pro
ductive.
If the teach-in degenerates into
two separate rallies simply yelling
at each other, then its purpose will
have been defeated. Booing and
heckling will not promote under
standing.
A previous teach-in held Oct. 8
failed to give a balanced presenta
tion of viewpoints and to attract
the number of people that should
be expected for such an important
event.
The organizers and participants
in this teach-in have another
chance to properly educate the
Stanford community on the Per
sian Gulf War. Now they will have a
larger audience and the experience
of the earlier teach-in, which was
less than successful.
