# War discussion in streets, classrooms
## Peaceful march moves through City 
### June Cohen Editorial staff 
SAN FRANCISCO - Tens of
thousands of protesters gathered
peacefully here this weekend, pro
viding a stark contrast and a calm
conclusion to a week of bridge
closings and violent, disruptive
demonstrations.
"Violence will never stop vio
lence — act in peace," read one of
the thousands of signs held by
anti-war protesters at Saturday's
rally.
And the demonstrators — tens
of thousands of them — followed
the advice while peacefully walk
ing the two mile route through
downtown San Francisco.
Slipping on the wet grass in
Dolores Park, the protesters —
including a sizable Stanford con
tingent — gathered at 11 a.m. to
assemble their banners before
marching to a 1 p.m. rally at the
Civic Center.
The signs ranged in content
from lewd suggestions that Presi
dent Bush should "pull out of
Kuwait" to "Bo knows peace";
from "Confused Jews for Peace"
to "No blood for Israel"; from"I
thought Bush was pro-life" to
"Protest is patriotism," but all
were alike in their anti-war senti
ment.
The ralliers themselves were as
disparate as the signs, but all were
unified in their commitment to
the idea of peace in the Middle
East.
"It's important for each side
not to get mired in slogans," said
Stanford senior Erin Clune. "I
feel like I'm looking at the situa

tion rationally, not just as a
peacenik. Pursuing war in the
Middle East has never been effec
tive."
"The Middle East was perched
on the edge of protracted high
intensity conflict, and it was just
pushed over by this irreparable
conflict," Clune added.
Stanford senior Jason Palm
said, "Bush talks about naked
aggression, but we are the aggres
sors."
"We're the ones who started
this war," Palm continued. "When
we bombed Iraq, we knew this
would mean Saddam would attack
Israel, and we knew Israel would
retaliate and we knew Jordan
would come in. We had a choice of
whether to start this."
And while the protesters
seemed determined to be heard,
few believed President Bush was
listening.
"I don't think President Bush
is in touch with the people," said
Stanford freshman Angela Jones.
"He's too focused on putting his
machine into action. Nothing will
stop him," she added.
"I don't think he'll hear us,"
said Stanford junior Liz Cook,
"but the Congress will hear us as
voters."
"I feel really powerless for the
first time," said Clune. "Some
times you feel like screaming so
loud it will get all the way to

Washington."
Many students at the rally
expressed similar frustration with
the response of the Stanford
administration, particularly for
not canceling classes for Wednes
day's teach-in.
"It seems like as an educational
institution we should be against
the war, but apparently the
administration is not," said junior
Alan Haynie.
Another student commented
that "the administration doesn't
have to take a stance on war, but
they should foster discussion."
"We need to educate our
selves," said senior Steve Levit
sky. "The administration's unwill
ingness to cancel classes for a day
is really ridiculous. Regardless of
a person's position or politics, war
is disruptive. People can't concen
trate. A teach-in would be a cam
pus-wide opportunity to discuss
war — not just for the peace side,"
he added.
"At this point, it's clear that
we're not going to pull out the
troops — what we're doing here is
not try to stop the war as much as
analyze the mentality our nation
has fallen into," Clune said.
After reaching the Civic Center,
many people dispersed around the
park, eating and listening to
music in an almost festival-like
atmosphere.
But others maintained their
activist fervor, gathering to hear
speakers, including Stanford stu
dent Aim6e Allison and several
other conscientious objectors, as
well as representatives from vari

ous advocacy groups and veter
ans' organizations.
The speeches were given over
the background noise of heli
copters circling overhead and a
single plane with a banner strung
behind it reading, "We support
our troops."
But some peace protesters also
said they support the troops.
Combat veteran Michael Joe, who
spoke at the rally, said, "We sup
ports our troops in Saudi Arabia,
(but) we do not support the war in
the Gulf."
Joe, who represents the United
Bay Veterans Against the War in
the Middle East, also said, "It is
the peace movement which sees
that our veterans get help when
they come home," while the U.S.
government does very little.
Linda Harvey of the Berkeley
Homeless Union said the battles
we should be fighting are right
here in America and that we
should be "waging a war on
poverty."
"There will be no war for oil
profits or armament profits," she
said. "We came here with determi
nation to carry forward the dream
of Martin Luther King, Jr. — to
continue the struggle against
racism and poverty."
With a thick accent, and over
thunderous applause, the
National Director of the Pales
tinian Women's Association said,
"Tell President Bush we live in a
democracy and we have the right
to express our opinions. Our posi
tion is to stop the war in the
Gulf."

"We are sick of George Bush's
double talk, double standards and
outright lies," she continued.
"Since when has Bush been con
cerned with human rights and
freedoms? For the past 23 years,
Palestine has been occupied by
Israel. Where was George?"
Few pro-war activists were visi
ble at the march. "This is a just

war," one yelled to the protesters.
"No wars are good, but this is a
just one." Although his view was
rejected, even scorned by the
passers-by, no violence occurred.
College-aged individuals made
up the bulk of the crowd, but a
wide range of other ages was rep
resented at the rally, from a three
year-old girl in ponytails and over

alls carrying a tiny peace sign to
conservatively dressed older cou
ples leaning heavily on canes.
Many protesters were encour
aged by the rally.
"As the war drags on and
becomes more unpopular, more
people will speak out about
it,"said Stanford senior Katie
Pehl.
