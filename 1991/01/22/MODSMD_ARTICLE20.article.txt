Administration supports teach-in, not cancellation of classes

I HAVE RECEIVED communications
from several faculty colleagues and
from a group of students, asking that
the University endorse activities
designed to increase knowledge about
the background and impact of the crisis
in the Middle East.
The current proposals ask that the
University sanction a teach-in to be held
all day on Wednesday, Jan. 23.
The provost and I have discussed the
request. We are impressed by the initia
tive and the thoughtful way in which it
has been presented.
It is our hope that deans and depart
ment chairs can respond in a flexible and
supportive way to requests from faculty
members to schedule special classes and
events; and we encourage our staff col-

issues, at Stanford and elsewhere, have been

replace the latter.

leagues to give assistance wherever pos
sible with respect to room scheduling,
facilities needs and the like.
There is everything to be gained from
balanced, thoughtful presentations and
discussions of this complex and troubling
situation.

As a part of the request, we were also
asked to suspend regular classes on the
day of the teach-in. That, we believe, is
neither necessary or desirable.

dents and faculty of last-minute, admin
istration-mandated losses in class time
would be substantial.
Finally — and most importantly — we
think members of this community
should be able to make choices rather
than having them forced upon them.
Because we want those choices to be
as free as possible, we do urge faculty
members and others to be understanding
if students choose, to concentrate on the
issues raised by the conflict instead of
their regular academic obligations.
