# Rabbi overlooked fear shared by all of humanity
## 
### 
I was shocked by Rabbi Ari Cartun's
statement quoted in the Jan. 18 Daily
that Iraq's bombing attack on Israel
"sets the Jewish student apart."
Cartun is evidently suggesting that
because of the attack on Israel, Jews at
Stanford have a greater psychological
burden to bear than others when it
comes to the war in the Persian Gulf.
But there are undoubtedly many on this
campus, Jews and non-Jews alike, whose
relatives, friends or fellow citizens are at
serious risk in this war.
All of thfise people share a common
fear, regardless of their religion or
nationality, and all of them deserve our
compassion. I hope also that we will feel
at least equal compassion for the untold
numbers of Iraqi citizens who are cur
rently being incinerated in the most

massive and relentless bombing assault
in history
For these helpless victims of Saddam
Hussein and George Bush we must not
only mourn but demand that the slaugh
ter come to a halt. The Judaism I was
taught said that we are all members of a
common humanity and that our obliga
tion is to preserve life, not destroy it.
