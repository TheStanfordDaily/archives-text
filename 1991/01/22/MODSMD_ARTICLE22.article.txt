# Teach-in and class cancellation would address war horrors
## 
### 
Like many others, I was deeply disap
pointed by President Kennedy's speech
in the Quad on Thursday Here was a
large gathering of students and faculty,
sitting in their concentric circles with
remarkable patience, quietly waiting for
the head of our university to say some
thing substantial.

We heard some beautiful music, we
availed ourselves of the opportunity to
meditate upon the suffering, present and
future, resulting from the outbreak of
this war, and when at last the president
spoke, he was listened to with great
attention.
But all we were given was a form of
whai I have heard referred to as "aca
demic psychobabble."
We were advised to be sensitive and
tolerant to each others' feelings, to be
mutually "supportive."
That is all very well, but it is not
enough. Feelings of outrage were not
mentioned. Implicit in the talk was the
idea that our feelings would include sad
ness, apprehension, worry — but out
rage? No.
Yet in fact fury and indignation at the
way in which Bush and his administra
tion have rushed to the attack regardless
of the loss of human life, risking swift
escalation to a regional and then a global
war of unprecedented horror, is what a
growing number of people feel.
It is a mockery of that appropriate
response to attempt to diffuse it. "Busi

ness as usual" under these circum
stances should not be a part of Stanford
education.
A major Teach-in is called for, not at
some vague future time but now. Presi
dent Kennedy would gain a great deal
more respect from the Stanford commu
nity if he announced his support for such
an event, during which classes would be
suspended so that all could attend, than
by merely trying not to alienate anyone.
