## Reading the Rectal Right 
### 
I FINALLY FIGURED OUT what
exactly bothered me about the Rectal
Right, the batch of conservatives who
pound the pulpit in favor of "traditional
values," the Western intellectual canon,
the "equitable" distribution of wealth
generated by a free-market economy,
America-first foreign policy, etc., etc.
It's not just that I disagree with them;
most of my friends disagree with me on
one point of principle or another, but I
still manage to respect them as human
beings. It's not just their unrealistic
obsession with preserving the status quo
in face of changing times and changing
demographics; after five years here at
Stanford, I've learned to accept dreamers
and fools.
It's not their reductionist attacks on
the progressive agenda; I don't expect
them to really grasp any political thought
that has more than any level of analysis
beyond the economic.
No, the critical point for me is their
selective attention to tradition. How "tra
ditional values" includes the nuclear fam
ily, but conveniently doesn't include the
"my house is my kingdom; you are my
subjects" ethos of the nuclear male.
How Western thought has brought us
the ideas of democracy, but not how West
ern thought found many intricate ways in
which to justify slavery, racial injustice
and sexual subjugation. How the (almost)
free-market economy in this country has
led to our present situation, where the
wealthiest 20 percent have more money
than the other 80 percent put together —
and the ratio is steadily increasing.
The cause of this realization is some

what obtuse. Last November, I went to
see "Dances with Wolves" and was incred
ibly pleased with what I saw. Finally, I
thought, a mainstream historical drama
which depicts an Indian people as people,
not as animalistic savages, not as value
less enemy-others. (And, wonders of won
ders, it was decently, though not totally,
accurate in the details.)
It was heartening to think that thou
sands of people had seen this movie and
would come away with a modified, more
realistic concept of Native America, and a
more critical historical consciousness of
how this country was established, a
knowledge of how, from sea to bloody sea,
people had their land and sovereignty
stolen from them.
And, I thought, maybe people will
make the connection between that her
itage and the struggle of Indian people
today for recognition, retribution and the
right of tribal autonomy. But then I burst
my optimistic bubble by talking to a cou
ple of people who proudly voice their sup
port for the Rectal Right (and who are
acquaintances, though they're not too
happy about the term "Rectal Right").
Their reaction to the movie was,
"What a shame that happened, and that
that's the way it was."
When I pointed out to them that that
is the way it is to a large extent, it became
clear that they saw the events of the
movie as totally seperated from the condi
tions of the present. Though they agreed
that the persecution of native people on
this continent was a tragedy, they still
looked at the traditions out of which that
persecution grew with a fond gleam in

their eyes.
Instead of seeing the slaughter as part
of their history, they persisted in seeing it
as an aberration, as if, for all those years,
all those settlers and cavalrymen jumped
out of their "civilized tradition" for a few
moments, murdered and pillaged, then
jumped back into being fine examples of
Western man.
For people to whom tradition seems so
valuable, they have a truly one-dimen
sional view of history, which allows them
to see only those events that are deemed
just as connected to where they now
stand. All that other uryust stuff wasn't
really meant to happen; just a few bad
apples taking advantage of the inherent
goodness of the system.
I don't know. Maybe it's just a given
that the victim's memory is longer than
that of the victimizer. Maybe we're more
concerned with the presence of history
because it's often been something that's
happened to us instead of something
we've determined. Maybe it's because we
simply want the system to live up to its
promise and stop wallowing in hypocrisy.
Maybe it's just difficult to swallow the
historical blindness that issues forth from
the mouths of the Rectal Right. The gag
reflex is a hard one to Fight.
