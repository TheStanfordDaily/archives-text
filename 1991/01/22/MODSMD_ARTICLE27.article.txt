## Byron Bland Moral conscience must take precedence over contract obligations 
### 
THE RIGHT TO ACT according to
our individual consciences is the
substance of freedom. It is the
bedrock of our great political and reli
gious traditions and must be honored
even, no particularly when it is difficult
to do so. Only then is it really freedom.
1 he reaction to Aim6e Allison's deci
sion to apply for a conscientious objection
discharge from military service has been
both good and troubling.
I hope that you have been pressed to
question your position. Whether you
agree or disagree with Allison is less
important than your struggle to define
your stand and discover your responsibil
ity. It is not only your right but your duty
as a free citizen.
A good response is one that causes you
to think for yourself. But remember that
your thoughts can only be as good as the
facts that you use. Correct information is
crucial, and three areas are especially
important for this issue.
The first is the definition of conscien
tious objection. A conscientious objector
is one who cannot participate in war for
reasons of conscience. Her/his opposition
must be first, to all wars, second, based on
a religious, moral or ethical principle and
third, sincerely held and deeply felt.
If you can adequately demonstrate
these three criteria, you can be dis

charged from military service. (Local
Selective Service Boards are responsible
for interrogating draftees who believe
themselves to be conscientious objectors.)
These criteria are rigorously applied,
and your beliefs are comprehensively
tested. You must face some difficult and
nuanced questioning. The process is any
thing but easy. {If you think you are an
conscientious objector, pleasf see a c.o.
counselor.)
Secondly, people in military service are
required to indicate that they were not
conscientious objectors when they
enlisted. To receive a conscientious objec
tor discharge, a person in the military
must prove that a change in conscience
has occurred. Since no one really wants to
fight in a war, the sincerity of this change
is often questionable.
I have heard some of you doubt Alli
son's sincerity. I can promise you that the
military is also suspicious and will subject
her to a strenuous test. If she is dis
charged, it will be because she convinced
a skeptical examiner that she is being
truthful.
The larger question is the authenticity
of any fundamental change. Throughout
the ages, religious traditions have pointed
to a phenomenon called conversion. In
conversion, a person comes to a new
understanding of her/himself.

People change in ways they cannot anticipate in
response to events that they cannot foresee.
Religious traditions celebrate this fact, and the
military acknowledges its validity.

After conversion, a person under
stands his or her situation differently and
sees his or her responsibilities in a new
light. People change in ways they cannot
anticipate in response to events that they
cannot foresee. Religious traditions cele
brate this fact, and the military acknowl
edges its validity.
Lastly, I have heard it said that people
in the military have signed a contract and
should be expected to honor it. I agree.
But we should look more closely at that
contract.
Allison and other military personnel
agreed to abide by military regulations
and the Uniform Code of Military Justice.
These regulations provide that should
one's conscience regarding participation
in war change, one may apply to be dis
charged. These were the terms of the con
tract.
Allison didn't sign herself into slavery

when she joined the militaiy. She didn't
give away her conscience, agree to live by
the moral dictates of a superior, abandon
moral development or suspend personal
growth. She is exercising the rights given
her by Department of Defense Directive
1300.6.
A larger ethical question looms. What
must a person do when moral conscience
and contractual or legal obligation con
flict?
It is a difficult and serious situation.
However, moral conscience must win out.
A person can usually expect to experience
severe sanctions or harsh punishment.
Still, one must shoulder the responsibili
ties and suffer the costs. A free society
can have it no other way.
I have seen some mean-spirited and
morally shortsighted reactions to Alli
son's stand of conscience. It is ironic to
watch those who most support military

action to defend freedom depreciate it at
home.
It is tragic to see a commitment to free
dom subvert the practice of freedom.
Political freedom is historically grounded
in freedom of conscience. They go
together; to dishonor one is to degrade
the other.
I want to end with a story. The church
was a center of the struggle for political
freedom in East Germany. One of the first
confrontations the church had with the
East German government was over the
right to conscientious objection.
The church managed to defend the
right of conscience in opposition to the
government's policy of universal military
service. In doing this, the church estab
lished a place for the integrity of con
science within the society.
Close to 30 years later, two Protestant
clergy and a Catholic priest were asked to
form an interim government. The stu
dent minister for East Berlin was given
the job of dismantling the secret police.
Think about it.
