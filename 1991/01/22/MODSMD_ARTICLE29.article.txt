It all began with "Psycho." At least,
that is what Mordden claims. Cinema was
turned on its head over the course of that
tumultuous decade, yet another victim of
social upheaval.
Mordden examines the cinema of the
period in a broad perspective, analyzing
its effect on a metamorphosising society.
So in a way, it was not just a victim, but
sometimes a willing accomplice, if not a
perpetrator of the change.
After the studio-dominated era of '50s
cinema, the next generation sought to
break away from the constrictions that
producers and moguls applied, restric
tions which threatened the vitality of

medium that was potentially extremely
powerful. Hollywood took its cue from the
more mature foreign industries, and
began making definite progress as an
artistic medium.
The decade that ended with Woodstock
provided quite a few shocks to the system
before it even got that far. Good and evil
had been thoroughly mixed up, some
times even reversed, in cinema. We see
how the intelligentsia that had by now
proliferated the industry demanded

broader horizons of its audience — Stan
ley Kubrick providing both sheer bril
liance and dread with some of his offer
ings — sexual norms flagrantly violated
in "Lolita," and lapsing alternately
between hysteria and horror when our
entire sense of humanity was questioned
and undermined in "Dr. Strangelove."
The contribution of Roger Corman
(who graduated from Stanford) to the
movement seems vital to Mordden. As the
undisputed king of the B-flick, Corman's

movies provided a viable alternative to
the glamor portrayed in mainstream
films. Corman played out the seedier side
of the street in his creations, usually shot
in just a few days. And what a crew he put
together. Jack Nicholson was frequently
in front of the camera, and among those
pitching in behind were Peter Bog
danovich, Francis Ford Coppola, Robert
Towne and Martin Scorsese.
Mordden looks at the contributions of
several of the key artists, directors and

actors who made a difference.
Mordden demands a lot from his read
ers - the prose is dense at every stage,
demanding, concentrated. In a way, the
form of the book is a reflection of Mord
den's analysis of the film movement of
that period — not necessarily appealing
and comfortable at every stage, because
he doesn't want it to be that way. The
reader has to extract, just as audiences of
the '60s did, meaning out of his offering.
This only serves to enhance the experi
ence.
