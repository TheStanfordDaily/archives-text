# Teach-ins to be held today, Wednesday
## 
### June Cohen Editorial staff 
Stanford students and faculty
will hold teach-ins today and
tomorrow to discuss different
aspects of the war in the Persian
Gulf, from its historical context to
the roles of technology and reli
gion.
Although the administration
did not cancel classes, University
President Donald Kennedy issued
a statement Friday supporting the
teach-in and urging faculty mem
bers "to be understanding if stu
dents choose to concentrate on the
issues raised by the conflict
instead of their regular academic
obligations."
The teach-in events are a com
pilation of the efforts of several
groups. The primary day reserved
for the teach-in is Wednesday, but
several events will take place
today, including a History Depart
ment forum from 3 to 5 p.m. and
dorm workshops in the evening
organized by anthropology gradu
ate students.
In addition, the School of Edu
cation is sponsoring its own forum
on educational issues Thursday at
2:30 p.m., and a teach-in
undertaken by graduate students
in education and open to the
entire community will be held all
day Friday.
Organized mainly by under
graduates with the support of
some faculty and administrators,
the teach-in is designed to educate
the campus community and spark
discussion on the Persian Gulf
war.
"The idea of a teach-in grew
out of a meeting that took place
after the candlelight vigil (in
White Plaza) the night hostilities
broke out," said Graham Boyd,
one of the event's organizers.
Students have put in hundreds
of hours of work since the war
began, trying to ensure that the
teach-in is a "educational experi
ence and not an activist protest,"
Boyd said. Organizers want to
provide a balanced point of view
and a wide range of discussion,"
he added.
"All we're trying to do right
now is inform people, not preach
to them," said senior Erin Clune.
"We felt it was important that
as a University we take some edu
cational role in the whole crisis,"
said senior Joanna Davidson. "We
need to draw on our resources as
an educational institution to pro
vide information so that people
can make up their own minds."
Organizers said part of the

inspiration behind the teach-in
was students' dissatisfaction with
the initial response on campus to
the war.
"I think I'm frustrated because
it seems the campus in general
just hasn't been thinking," said
senior Michael Myers. "I'd rather
see anyone with any political opin
ion express it rather than sit and
do nothing."
"I'd be happier to see 2,000
people showing support for the
war than 2,000 people sitting
home and doing nothing.... I'm
upset with 'business as usual.'
And I feel the University has con
tributed to that by not voluntarily
closing down for a day,"he added.
Student organizers said they
appreciate the support they have
received from the faculty and the
administration, but most of them
expressed regret that classes were
not canceled for Wednesday's
teach-in.
"Kennedy gave us useful ideas
and offered help," said Davidson.
"We had hoped that classes would

be canceled, and it would have
been nice to have some statement
from the administration saying
that business was not going on as
usual, but we're trying to work
with it and the teach-in will go on
as planned."
Kennedy, however, asserted in
his statement that suspending
classes was "neither necessary nor
desirable," because "the cost to
many students and faculty of last
minute, administration-mandated
losses in class time would be sub
stantial."
"We think members of this
community should be able to
make choices rather than having
them forced upon them,"
Kennedy wrote.
This sentiment was echoed by
Marshall Smith, dean of the
School of Education, who said
that although the school supports
the teach-in," he does not think
classes should be canceled because
"this is not an institution where
you lightly tell faculty what to
do."

Smith added that he "would be
very surprised if students were
penalized" for not attending class
during the teach-in.
Organizers said they have tried
to include the entire Stanford
community in the teach-in by
scheduling nighttime lectures and
workshops and by trying to secure
a policy allowing staff to attend
educational events during work
ing hours, Davidson said.
Although Davidson hadn't
received any confirmation on a
leave policy for staff, Smith said,
"There is no question that staff
will not be penalized" within the
Education School.
Davidson also said there will be
note takers at each workshop and
forum and that all notes will be
available in White Plaza.
All of the locations and times
are subject to change, but two
information tables — one in front
of White Plaza and one in front of
Cubberley — will have updated
information on events throughout
the week.
