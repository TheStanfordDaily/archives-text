# Teach-ins to be held today, Wednesday
## 
### June Cohen Editorial staff 
Stanford students and faculty
will hold teach-ins today and
tomorrow to discuss different
aspects of the war in the Persian
Gulf, from its historical context to
the roles of technology and reli
gion.
Although the administration
did not cancel classes, University
President Donald Kennedy issued
a statement Friday supporting the
teach-in and urging faculty mem
bers "to be understanding if stu
dents choose to concentrate on the
issues raised by the conflict
instead of their regular academic
obligations."
The teach-in events are a com
pilation of the efforts of several
groups. The primary day reserved
for the teach-in is Wednesday, but
several events will take place
today, including a History Depart
ment forum from 3 to 5 p.m. and
dorm workshops in the evening
organized by anthropology gradu
ate students.
In addition, the School of Edu
cation is sponsoring its own forum
on educational issues Thursday at
2:30 p.m., and a teach-in
undertaken by graduate students
in education and open to the
entire community will be held all
day Friday.
Organized mainly by under
graduates with the support of
some faculty and administrators,
the teach-in is designed to educate
the campus community and spark
discussion on the Persian Gulf
war.
"The idea of a teach-in grew
out of a meeting that took place
