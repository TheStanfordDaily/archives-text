### Gretzky: An Autobiography By Wayne Gretzky with 
Reviewed by Michael D.C. Drout
Even if you are not a hockey
fan, you probably know who
Wayne Gretzky is. If you are a
hockey fan, you need not read the
rest of this review: this book is
indispensible, buy it and read it
for yourself.
Those readers not devotees of
the Canadian game might have
second thoughts about the book,
but the chance to read the
thoughts of an individual almost
universally acclaimed to be the
greatest ever to play his sport may
still have their interest.
Covering ground from his
backdoor rink in Brantford,
Ontario, to his new home in Bev
erly Hills, with stops in Edmon
ton, Gretzky's book is a pleasantly
understated account of the "Cana
dian Dream."
Gretzky's embarrassment at
having to talk about his own
accomplishments is charmingly
obvious. At one point, he talks for
more than two pages about Dave
Semenko — Gretzky's "body
guard," and never known for his
skill at playing hockey — while
giving his own accomplishments,
including the Hart Trophy
(hockey's MVP award) and the
Stanley Cup only two paragraphs.
The most touching part of the
book is the Great One's descrip
tion of his childhood and its sud
den end when he broke all Cana
dian youth scoring records. Gret
zky never finished high school,
never went to a prom, moved
away from home while only 14 so

as to get away from publicity, and
it is obvious that he wonders what
he missed.
But the great love Gretzky has
for the game of hockey is evident
on every page. Rarely does he
complain, and then only about
specific individuals (Edmonton
Oilers owner Peter Pocklington)
or facets of the game (fighting).
Too much space is devoted to
listing the merits of Gretzky's
wife, actress Janet Jones. But this
is to be expected, as in some
aspects the book is an' answer to
the critics who charged Jones with
motivating "The Trade," when
Gretzky was traded to the Los
Angeles Kings to the horror of
Canadian hockey fans.
Gretzky places the blame for
the trade squarely on the shoul
ders of Peter Pocklington, and
illustrates the owner's miserliness
in several anecdotes, charging
that Pocklington, when buying
Stanley Cup rings for the team,
based the size of the diamond in
the ring on the player's perceived
contribution to the team. Coaches
and trainers, says Gretzky,
received fake diamonds.
There are several fast-paced
chapters detailing the Oilers' first
run to the Stanley Cup, as well as
a section on the Great One's sug
gestions for improving the game
of hockey (no fighting, tougher
penalties for stick infractions).
And for trivia fans, Wayne dis
cusses his lucky garter belt and
the real reason that fans of the
New Jersey Devils sing the Mickey
Mouse Club anthem when Gret
zky plays at the Meadowlands.
