### Peter Ostwald 
Vaslav Nijinsky: A Leap
Into Madness

Lyle Stuart, $19.95, 358 pages
(Illustrated)
Reviewed by Leah Edwards
In his biography of Vaslav Nijinsky,
Peter Ostwald quotes music scholar
Alfred Einstein: "Posterity is entitled to
know everything about the life of its
great ones — even the most intimate
details. If they are truly great, they must
be able to survive it." Ostwald's admira
tion of the artistic genius and his sympa
thy for the man make it clear he believes
Nijinsky's reputation as the "God of the
Dance" will withstand the information
he relates.
However, the story that Ostwald tells
is not a pretty one.
After attending the Imperial Ballet
School in St. Petersburg, becoming the
star dancer and choreographer of
Diaghilev's Ballets Russes and mixing
with the artistic elite in Paris, the world
famous dancer spent the last 30 years of
his life prisoner to a debilitating mental
illness before dying in 1950.
Ostwald, a psychiatrist who directs
the Health Center for Performing
Artists at U.C. San Francisco where he
also teaches, has researched these little
understood years — presenting and
interpreting information from previ
ously unpublished" medical files from
Nijinsky's frequent psychiatric diag
noses and stays in mental hospitals. As
much a history of psychiatry as dance
history, Nijinsky's case traces the devel
opment of psychoanalysis in Europe dur
ing the early part of the century.
Included in the great volume of writ
ings devoted to Nijinsky and the Ballet

Russes (which Dr. Ostwald acknowl
edges and quotes liberally from) are sev
eral theories as to what caused this "leap
into madness." However, Ostwald pro
vides the first comprehensive account of
Nijinsky's illness — his violent mood
swings, his depression, his sexual obses
sions and his narcissism.
One reason that dance lovers and his
torians have been so intrigued about
what happened to Nyinsky is that his
personal tragedy was such a great loss to
the dance world. He created both the
role of a male dance star as well as mod
ern ballet— both of which we take for
granted today but which were extraordi
nary at the time.
Nijinsky has also been of great inter
est because of his eccentricity. His
actions both on and off the stage shocked
many. Before his marriage, he was the
lover of the Ballet impresario, Serge
Diaghilev, and one of his ballets, "The
Rite of Spring," was so controversial
fights actually broke out between audi
ence members during the performance.
Nijinsky's reputation and influence
are all the more impressive given the
brevity of his career. The superstar's rise
to fame and crash into madness lasted
only a decade, and just three of his
choreographed works ever made it to the
stage.
Nijinsky said, "People like eccentrics
and they will therefore leave me alone,
saying that I am a 4 mad clown."' How
ever, we will not leave him alone. We
want to know more, and Dr. Ostwald
provides compelling reading.

The author will speak and sign books at
a benefit sponsored by the San Francisco
Mental Health Association Tuesday
evening, January 23rd. Call 921-4401
