The Book of Sequels

Random House, $16.95, 144 pages
The immediate question this work begs is when
will its sequel be out? The book is based on America's
unquenchable thirst for the repeat (the three-peat
will have to wait, S.F.) and no-one is spared here.
From movie ideas like "I was a Teenage Beowulf"
and "2000: A Space Iliad" to literary concepts such
as "Judaism and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance"
and Marquez's follow-up "Solitude: The Next One
Hundred Years (The Fall of the Patriarch)" featuring
one Manuel Noriega, the book sparkles from cover to
cover.
Loving the Earth: A Sacred Landscape Book
for Children
By Fredric Lehrman
Celestial Arts, $17.95, 47 pages (Illustrated)
The book is aimed at teaching children about the
earth, and why and how to take care of it. The book
has been illustrated by Lisa Tune, and there are also
several beautiful photographs of landscapes and
nature.
The book ends with a glossary of relevant terms,
including acid rain, deforestation, the greenhouse
effect, oil spills, and pollution. Those are negative
terms, but it probably helps to give kids some kind of
reality check.
The Overnight Resume
By Donald Asher
Ten Speed, $6.95, 105 pages
Summer is looming ahead, inching closer, and
with it is temporary or (for soon-to-graduate
seniors) permanent unemployment. To help breach
that relaxed, leisurely void a job of some sort might
help. This book is quite a helpful stepping stone. It
includes some helpful hints and tricks that can
smooth over embarrassments in your past career.
Asher takes you through all the steps needed to
get a resume together. It can help for a summer job,
or for getting a career in gear.
