## Trojans trounce hapless hoopsters 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES - The
Stanford men's basketball
team spent two days last week
worried about a possible let
down against USC. Saturday
afternoon, they showed why.
Just three days after per
haps its best game of the sea
son — an upset win at UCLA —
Stanford crashed painfully to
earth against the Trojans, who
outshot, outran, outre
bounded, outhustled and out
played the Cardinal, 85-67.

Men's Basketball

Trojans 85

Cardinal 67

The loss made complete and
perfect sense in this Year of
Insanity in the Pacific 10 Con
ference, because the Trojans
had the worst record in the
league (0-4) before Saturday's
game. They'd also lost four
straight, including a 69-66 loss
to California — a team that has
impressed exactly zero people
all year.
"I was thinking, as I sat on
the bench with about a minute
to go, that coaching is a lot like
raising children: completely
unpredictable," said USC coach
George Raveling, whose team
is now 9-5, 1-4 in the Pac-10.
"How does one explain a lack
luster effort against Cal, and
then a tremendous effort like
today?"
The tremendous effort
might have had something to
do with the Cardinal's perfor
mance, which was (to put it
kindly) unspectacular. "As good
as we were Wednesday night (at
UCLA), we were that bad
today," Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery said.
The Cardinal fell to 10-6 (3-
3). "USC was clearly the
aggressor: They were hungry,
going after it, and we just
weren't into it. We didn't have
a single individual performance
that was good."
Stanford did get 24 points
from Adam Keefe, but half of
those points came long after
the game was over. Keefe spent
most of the game crashing into
a trio of Trojans — Keith Gree
ley, Mark Boyd and Calvin
Banks — and the banging took
its toll.
"It reminded me a lot of Ari
zona," Keefe said. "They
rotated those big guys in there
and told them 'Do whatever
you have to to make sure he
doesn't catch the ball.' It was
hell trying to catch the ball."
It was also hell trying to
rebound. The smaller Trojans
swarmed the paint and brought
down 45 rebounds, compared
to 37 for Stanford. USC's Ron
nie Coleman had 12 rebounds,
seven at the offensive end.
(Stanford had exactly one
offensive board in the first
half.) It was only the second
time all year the Cardinal has
lost the battle of the boards.
It was also hell trying to

shoot. With USC tackling
Keefe inside, Stanford's out
side game had to come alive,
and, needless to say, it didn't:
The Cardinal's shooting went
from torrid (29-for-50) at
UCLA to horrid (27-for-65,
.415) at USC. Only five of Stan
ford's 17 three-pointers hit
home.
It was also hell at the line.
Stanford normally makes 70.6
percent of its free throws. On
Saturday? Eight hits, 10
misses. Forty-four percent.
Keefe alone was three-for-nine.
"It was really frustrating,"
said Keefe, who normally hits
at a 78-percent clip. "I was
really fatigued at practice [Fri
day] and today I just didn't
have my legs. That's why the
free throws were particularly
brutal, and that's why I missed
some shots that are normally
100 percent."
It was also hell on defense.
Trojan guards Harold Miner
and Robert Pack scored 25 and
20 points, respectively, and for
ward Ronnie Coleman added
17. Deshon Wingate and Brent
Williams teamed to hold Miner
to 9-for-21 shooting, but no one
did much of anything against
Pack, who spent most of the
game slicing through two or
three players to get to the hoop.
"You know Miner is going to
get his points; we felt if we held
him below his average (25.7)
we'd be okay," Montgomery
said. "Pack really hurt us."
Let's face it, it was hell
everywhere. "They outhustled
us and outrebounded us,"
Montgomery said. "We didn't
have anything to hang our hat
on, because we did nothing
right."
Nothing? "Nope," said John
Patrick. "That was one of the
most frustrating games ever."
Actually, there were two
good things about the game.
The first was that Stanford was
somehow only down by six at
the half despite missing five of
its 10 free throws and grabbing
that one measly offensive
rebound.
That all changed in the first
five minutes of the second half,
as the Cardinal threw the ball
out of bounds, missed three
foot shots and layups and (lit
erally) watched the Troans
blow by them to take a 50-36
lead with 15 minutes to go.
The run — as well as the
game — was punctuated when
Wingate dropped a pass and
Miner picked it up and fed
Duane Cooper, who took two
dribbles and got the ball right
back to Miner. Patrick was
standing right under the hoop,
but there wasn't a heck of a lot
he could do: Miner flew up
until his chin was almost at the
rim, cradled the ball and toma
hawked it down so hard it
almost put a dent in the
cement-like Sports Arena floor.
The Cardinal got no closer than
12 the rest of the way.
The other good thing about
this game?
Nobody got hurt.
