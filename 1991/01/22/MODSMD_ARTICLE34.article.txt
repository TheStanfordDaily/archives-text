# Lisa who? Card is still the boss
## 
### David Hirning Senior staff writer 
The word is out, and it's sending shivers up and
down the spines of collegiate women's basketball
coaches everywhere: USC is back.
The once-dominant Southern California program
which, led by Cheryl Miller, won two national titles
in the early 1980s, has found a new star and some of
its old mystique with 6-foot-5 freshman Lisa Leslie.
The Trojans nearly took a huge step back into promi
nence Saturday night in Maples Pavilion, leading
defending national champion Stanford well into the
second half before falling, 77-69.

Women's Basketball

Cardinal 77

Women of Troy 69

The Cardinal (12-3) weathered a poor shooting
performance (27-of-69, .391) and a season-low eight
points from leading scorer Julie Zeilstra to post its
sixth consecutive win and remain unbeaten in the
Pacific 10 Conference at 6-0. The Trojans fell to 9-6,
3-2 in the conference.
Leslie, the phenom who once scored 101 points in
a half in high school and who averages a double-dou
ble (22.1 ppg,<J.2.B rpg), was the main reason why the
game drew a women's regular season-record 5,455
spectators (breaking the mark set last year against
Tennessee). Was she really as good as everyone says?
Is she possibly the next Miller?
Leslie did not disappoint, though perhaps not
quite living up to her mythic expectations and failing
to dunk the ball. Despite scoring only six points in
the first half, the forward still finished with 24
points and 20 rebounds, her 10th double-double of
the season. It was the third time she has reached 20
in both categories in one game.
She was also a large factor on defense. "Lisa
Leslie really changes things in there," Stanford
coach Tara VanDerveer said. "She's a force inside. I
don't know how many blocks she had [3], but we
played away from her the whole night.
"You're talking about an exceptional player who is
very young and is coming into her own."
Stanford responded with the 6-3 tandem of Val
Whiting and Trisha Stevens, and the two experi
enced players carried Stanford to the victory. Whit
ing shut Leslie down in the first half before running
into foul trouble, and went on to post a double-dou
ble of her own with 13 points and a team-leading 14
rebounds.
Stevens, as she seems to do in every important
game this year, took charge offensively. While the
other four Cardinal starters shot a ragged 14-of-48
(.292), the senior took advantage of a mismatch and

equaled Leslie with 24 points on
12-of-17 shooting while playing
more than usual (31 minutes) on
her injured knees.
"Trisha Stevens, Trisha
Stevens, Trisha Stevens," Van-
Derveer mumbled after the game.
"What am I going to do next
year?... She scores, she delivers."
Until Stevens took over, it
appeared that she and classmate
Sonja Henning would possibly
lose only their second game ever
in Maples Pavilion. When Trojan
point guard Tammy Story scored
the last of her six straight points
with 13:33 left in the game, USC
held a 49-41 advantage.
But after the squads traded
baskets and a media timeout,
Stevens reeled off six straight of
her own to cut the margin to
three. Then she fed Henning for a
three-pointer to tie, and the Car
dinal would never trail again. Six
more points by Stevens and four
free throws by Henning in the
last minute and the two seniors
had locked up consecutive home
victory No. 39.
"Sonja and Trisha have a fifth
gear," VanDerveer said. "You're
talking about players who have
won a national championship,
and they've lost just one game on
this court. They have a lot of
pride."
Story, a 5-foot-8 junior who
converted to point guard last sea
son, led the Trojans to a three
point halftime lead with 11 points
on 5-of-8 shooting. She and Hen
ning had a memorable point

future of the Pac-10.'

guard battle all game, with
Story's 21 points besting Hen
ning's 15 while the latter took the
assist edge, eight to three. Story
also gave up six turnovers, while
the exacting Henning had just
one.
Both teams had trouble find
ing the hoop in the first half, with
Stanford winning the quest for
futility with 31-percent shooting.
USC made just 39.5 percent from
the field in the opening 20 min
utes.
The close game forced Van-
Derveer to use her starters almost
exclusively. All five players saw
more than 30 minutes of action,
while the Cardinal bench played
just 26 minutes total (six in the
second half) and contributed only
three points.
In defeat, the talented USC
team served notice that the Pac
-10 will no longer be a two-horse
race between the Cardinal and
Washington. Trojan coach Mari
anne Stanley's team gave Stan
ford a tougher game on its home
floor than the Huskies did on the
road, and the young squad can
only improve in the coming weeks
and years.
"You're looking at the future of
the Pac-10," VanDerveer said.
"They played in front of a great
crowd that could have rattled a lot
of other young teams, but I
thought they kept their poise real
well.
"They have a fabulous tradi
tion . . . and definitely they're
back."

Card notes
One can only wonder what hap
pened to the Trojans in Berkeley laat
Thursday, where they were handed
their first Pac-10 loss of the year by a
whopping 92-66 score.... The Cardi
nal's streak of 39 consecutive wins at
home is the second-longest in the
nation, but it's a distant second.
Auburn, who lost to Stanford in laat
year's NCAA title game, has won 60
straight in its friendly confines. The
Lady Tigers beat Card-killer and
then-No. 2 Tennessee over the week
end, 70-65.

to dunk the ball. Despite scoring only six points in
the first half, the forward still finished with 24
points and 20 rebounds, her 10th double-double of
the season. It was the third time she has reached 20
in both categories in one game.
She was also a large factor on defense. "Lisa
Leslie really changes things in there," Stanford
coach Tara VanDerveer said. "She's a force inside. I
don't know how many blocks she had [3], but we
played away from her the whole night.
"You're talking about an exceptional player who is
very young and is coming into her own."
Stanford responded with the 6-3 tandem of Val
Whiting and Trisha Stevens, and the two experi
enced players carried Stanford to the victory. Whit
ing shut Leslie down in the first half before running
into foul trouble, and went on to post a double-dou
ble of her own with 13 points and a team-leading 14
rebounds.
Stevens, as she seems to do in every important
game this year, took charge offensively. While the
other four Cardinal starters shot a ragged 14-of-48
(.292), the senior took advantage of a mismatch and

equaled Leslie with 24 points on
12-of-17 shooting while playing
more than usual (31 minutes) on
her injured knees.
"Trisha Stevens, Trisha
Stevens, Trisha Stevens," Van-
Derveer mumbled after the game.
"What am I going to do next
year?... She scores, she delivers."
Until Stevens took over, it
appeared that she and classmate
Sonja Henning would possibly
lose only their second game ever
in Maples Pavilion. When Trojan
point guard Tammy Story scored
the last of her six straight points
with 13:33 left in the game, USC
held a 49-41 advantage.
But after the squads traded
baskets and a media timeout,
Stevens reeled off six straight of
her own to cut the margin to
three. Then she fed Henning for a
three-pointer to tie, and the Car
dinal would never trail again. Six
more points by Stevens and four
free throws by Henning in the
last minute and the two seniors
had locked up consecutive home
victory No. 39.
"Sonja and Trisha have a fifth
gear," VanDerveer said. "You're
talking about players who have
won a national championship,
and they've lost just one game on
this court. They have a lot of
pride."
Story, a 5-foot-8 junior who
converted to point guard last sea
son, led the Trojans to a three
point halftime lead with 11 points
on 5-of-8 shooting. She and Hen
ning had a memorable point

guard battle all game, with
Story's 21 points besting Hen
ning's 15 while the latter took the
assist edge, eight to three. Story
also gave up six turnovers, while
the exacting Henning had just
one.
Both teams had trouble find
ing the hoop in the first half, with
Stanford winning the quest for
futility with 31-percent shooting.
USC made just 39.5 percent from
the field in the opening 20 min
utes.
The close game forced Van-
Derveer to use her starters almost
exclusively. All five players saw
more than 30 minutes of action,
while the Cardinal bench played
just 26 minutes total (six in the
second half) and contributed only
three points.
In defeat, the talented USC
team served notice that the Pac
-10 will no longer be a two-horse
race between the Cardinal and
Washington. Trojan coach Mari
anne Stanley's team gave Stan
ford a tougher game on its home
floor than the Huskies did on the
road, and the young squad can
only improve in the coming weeks
and years.
"You're looking at the future of
the Pac-10," VanDerveer said.
"They played in front of a great
crowd that could have rattled a lot
of other young teams, but I
thought they kept their poise real
well.
"They have a fabulous tradi
tion . . . and definitely they're
back."

Card notes
One can only wonder what hap
pened to the Trojans in Berkeley laat
Thursday, where they were handed
their first Pac-10 loss of the year by a
whopping 92-66 score.... The Cardi
nal's streak of 39 consecutive wins at
home is the second-longest in the
nation, but it's a distant second.
Auburn, who lost to Stanford in laat
year's NCAA title game, has won 60
straight in its friendly confines. The
Lady Tigers beat Card-killer and
then-No. 2 Tennessee over the week
end, 70-65.

The once-dominant Southern California program

Cardinal 77

The Cardinal (12-3) weathered a poor shooting
performance (27-of-69, .391) and a season-low eight
points from leading scorer Julie Zeilstra to post its
sixth consecutive win and remain unbeaten in the
Pacific 10 Conference at 6-0. The Trojans fell to 9-6,
3-2 in the conference.
Leslie, the phenom who once scored 101 points in
a half in high school and who averages a double-dou
ble (22.1 ppg,<J.2.B rpg), was the main reason why the
game drew a women's regular season-record 5,455
spectators (breaking the mark set last year against
Tennessee). Was she really as good as everyone says?

more than usual (31 minutes) on
her injured knees.
"Trisha Stevens, Trisha
Stevens, Trisha Stevens," Van-
Derveer mumbled after the game.
"What am I going to do next
year?... She scores, she delivers."
Until Stevens took over, it
appeared that she and classmate
Sonja Henning would possibly
lose only their second game ever
in Maples Pavilion. When Trojan
point guard Tammy Story scored
the last of her six straight points
with 13:33 left in the game, USC
held a 49-41 advantage.
But after the squads traded
baskets and a media timeout,
Stevens reeled off six straight of
her own to cut the margin to
three. Then she fed Henning for a
three-pointer to tie, and the Car
dinal would never trail again. Six
more points by Stevens and four
free throws by Henning in the
last minute and the two seniors
had locked up consecutive home
victory No. 39.
"Sonja and Trisha have a fifth
gear," VanDerveer said. "You're
talking about players who have
won a national championship,
and they've lost just one game on
this court. They have a lot of
pride."
Story, a 5-foot-8 junior who
converted to point guard last sea
son, led the Trojans to a three
point halftime lead with 11 points
on 5-of-8 shooting. She and Hen
ning had a memorable point

'You're looking at the
future of the Pac-10.'

guard battle all game, with
Story's 21 points besting Hen
ning's 15 while the latter took the
assist edge, eight to three. Story
also gave up six turnovers, while
the exacting Henning had just
one.
Both teams had trouble find
ing the hoop in the first half, with
Stanford winning the quest for
futility with 31-percent shooting.
USC made just 39.5 percent from
the field in the opening 20 min
utes.
The close game forced Van-
Derveer to use her starters almost
exclusively. All five players saw
more than 30 minutes of action,
while the Cardinal bench played
just 26 minutes total (six in the
second half) and contributed only
three points.
In defeat, the talented USC
team served notice that the Pac
-10 will no longer be a two-horse
race between the Cardinal and
Washington. Trojan coach Mari
anne Stanley's team gave Stan
ford a tougher game on its home
floor than the Huskies did on the
road, and the young squad can
only improve in the coming weeks
and years.
"You're looking at the future of
the Pac-10," VanDerveer said.
"They played in front of a great
crowd that could have rattled a lot
of other young teams, but I
thought they kept their poise real
well.
"They have a fabulous tradi
tion . . . and definitely they're
back."

Card notes
One can only wonder what hap
pened to the Trojans in Berkeley laat
Thursday, where they were handed
their first Pac-10 loss of the year by a
whopping 92-66 score.... The Cardi
nal's streak of 39 consecutive wins at
home is the second-longest in the
nation, but it's a distant second.
Auburn, who lost to Stanford in laat
year's NCAA title game, has won 60
straight in its friendly confines. The
Lady Tigers beat Card-killer and
then-No. 2 Tennessee over the week
end, 70-65.
