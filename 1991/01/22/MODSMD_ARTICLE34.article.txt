# Lisa who? Card is still the boss

The word is out, and it's sending shivers up and
down the spines of collegiate women's basketball
coaches everywhere: USC is back.
The once-dominant Southern California program
which, led by Cheryl Miller, won two national titles
in the early 1980s, has found a new star and some of
its old mystique with 6-foot-5 freshman Lisa Leslie.
The Trojans nearly took a huge step back into promi
nence Saturday night in Maples Pavilion, leading
defending national champion Stanford well into the
second half before falling, 77-69.

Cardinal 77

Women of Troy 69

The Cardinal (12-3) weathered a poor shooting
performance (27-of-69, .391) and a season-low eight
points from leading scorer Julie Zeilstra to post its
sixth consecutive win and remain unbeaten in the
Pacific 10 Conference at 6-0. The Trojans fell to 9-6,
3-2 in the conference.
Leslie, the phenom who once scored 101 points in
a half in high school and who averages a double-dou
ble (22.1 ppg,<J.2.B rpg), was the main reason why the
game drew a women's regular season-record 5,455
spectators (breaking the mark set last year against
Tennessee). Was she really as good as everyone says?
Is she possibly the next Miller?
Leslie did not disappoint, though perhaps not
quite living up to her mythic expectations and failing
to dunk the ball. Despite scoring only six points in
the first half, the forward still finished with 24
points and 20 rebounds, her 10th double-double of
the season. It was the third time she has reached 20
in both categories in one game.
She was also a large factor on defense. "Lisa
Leslie really changes things in there," Stanford
coach Tara VanDerveer said. "She's a force inside. I
don't know how many blocks she had [3], but we
played away from her the whole night.
"You're talking about an exceptional player who is
very young and is coming into her own."
Stanford responded with the 6-3 tandem of Val
Whiting and Trisha Stevens, and the two experi
enced players carried Stanford to the victory. Whit
ing shut Leslie down in the first half before running
into foul trouble, and went on to post a double-dou
ble of her own with 13 points and a team-leading 14
rebounds.
Stevens, as she seems to do in every important
game this year, took charge offensively. While the
other four Cardinal starters shot a ragged 14-of-48
(.292), the senior took advantage of a mismatch and

The record regular season crowd in Maples on Saturday witnessed the first of what are
sure to become legendary battles between last year's Pac-10 Freshman of the Year Val
Whiting and (JSC's superfrosh Lisa Leslie.
