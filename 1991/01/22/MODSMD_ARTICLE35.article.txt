The Pacific 10 Conference is a
scary place if you're a men's ten
nis player this year. "The Pac-10 is
by far the strongest I've ever seen
it," said Stanford coach Dick
Gould, a 25-year veteran of the
Pac-10. "There are so many out
standing players, so many great
team 8."
Despite the strength of the con
ference, three-time defending
national champion Stanford left
notice that it is still the team to
beat as Cardinal players captured
several titles at the inaugural
Gatorade/Pac-10 Indoor Tennis
Tournament this past weekend in
Seattle, Wash.
Junior Alex O'Brien high
lighted Stanford's performance
with a 7-5, 6-4 win over California
senior Bent-Ove Pedersen in the
finals of the Flight No. 1 singles
tournment.
"Alex is playing as well as any
one in college tennis right now,"
Gould said. "He showed that with

his win over No. 11 Donny Isaak
in the semis and then in the finals
[over Pedersen]."
O'Brien is presently ranked
No. 21 in the country but will
undoubtedly move up as a result
of this weekend's performance. "I
thought I played really well this
weekend," O'Brien said. "In the
finals, I was attacking a lot more
than [Pedersenl was. I was com
ing up on everything. I tried to
step into every ball. That was the
difference."
"He played smart tennis (in the
finals). He did exactly what he
needed to do," asst. coach John
Whitlinger said of O'Brien, who
has now beaten Pedersen the last
four times the two have played.
"Alex is not just relying on his
groundstrokes anymore. He is not
waiting for his opponent to make
the mistake everytime. He knows
when to attack, and he's doing it."
O'Brien gave much of the
credit for his win to the Stanford
coaches, Gould and Whitlinger.
"They were out there everyday
from 7 a.m. until 12:30 at night,"

O'Brien said. "It made a big dif
ference, especially for me."
But O'Brien wasn't the only
success story. Sophomore Jared
Palmer advanced to the the semi
finals of Flight No. 1 before bow
ing out to Pedersen, 6-2, 6-3. In
the quarterfinals, Palmer downed
one of the nation's top players,
USC's No. 1 Byron Black, 6-2, 6-3.
"He just needs to get a little
more consistent from day to day,"
Whitlinger said. "He was defi
nitely capable of winning that
tournament. Then again, there
were a lot of guys who could have
won it."
Palmer teamed with senior
Dan Turbow to win the Flight No.
2 doubles tournament, coming
back from a set down to beat Ari
zona State's Ross Matheson and
Dan Marting 6-7, 6-3, 6-1.
"[Palmer and Turbowl played
exceptionally well. They comple
ment each other," Gould said.
"Jared was moving well at the net,
and Dan was returning well the
whole tournament."
Stanford freshmen Vimal Patel

and Michael Flannagan showed
why they were two of the top
recruits in the nation. Flannagan
reached the quarterfinals of the
Flight No. 3 singles tournament.
Patel won the Flight No. 4 singles
tournament with a 6-3, 7-5 victory
over UCLA's Robbie Wendell.
"Vimal played well. He beat
some good experienced players,"
Gould said. "We are still trying to
get him to be a little more aggres
sive. We want him to try to serve
and volleyÂ»a bit more."
Chris Cocotos, another of Stan
ford's top recruits, was forced to
default because of the flu.
Senior Glenn Solomon, who
was playing in Flight No. 2, also
made it to the quarterfinals, los
ing in one of the tournment's
tightest matches 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 to
USC's Andras Lanyi. Senior
Jason Yee competed in Flight No.
2 as well but lost both his first
round match and his first-round
consolation duel.
Turbow made it to the semifi-
