# Spikers cruise over LMU

### Kevin Jeffery Staff writer 
After a promising preseason, the Cardi
nal men's volleyball team opened 1991
Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Associa
tion play with a commanding 15-9, 15-13,
15-7 victory over Loyola Marymount Satur
day at Burnham Pavilion.
Saturday's win gave Stanford a 1-0
record in the WIVA's Harry Wilson divi
sion, and a 1-1 overall record. That loss
came at the hands of defending national
champion and top-ranked USC in the finals
of the preseason UC-Santa Barbara Classic.
The Cardinal's six wins and one other loss
in the tournament do not count on the
team's record, as they came in best-of-three
matches.
Stanford was able to control the match
throughout by dominating the net against
the Lions. They totaled 17 team blocks, a
high number for a three-set match, behind
senior middle blocker Mike Lowe and junior
outside hitter Dave Goss, who had eight
and six blocks, respectively.
"This was one of our better blocking
matches in quite a while," said coach Ruben
Nieves.
"Their star Sio Saipaia is a great outside
hitter who, if he gets it going, can really
take over a match. But Dave Goss stuffed
him with a few blocks early and took him
out of his game," he said.
Goss also had a great game offensively,
leading the Cardinal with 15 kills. He was
followed by junior outside hitter Duncan

Blackman, who added 11 kills.
Nieves was satisfied to come away with a
victory in the league opener. "Even though
Loyola Marymount isn't usually at the top
of the league, they've always been a tough
opponent for us," he said.
This Friday and Saturday the Cardinal
travel to Provo, Utah where they will play
two matches against Brigham Young, the
first of which will be a WIVA league match.
The Cougars were the only team other
than USC to down Stanford at the Santa
Barbara Classic, and that was at a neutral
site. Playing on their home floor, BYU
should give the Cardinal its first real chal
lenge of the WIVA season.
Those challenges will be neither few nor
far between as Stanford tries to improve on
last season's 12-4 record and second place
finish in the rigorous Harry Wilson division
of the WIVA.
The Cardinal will play home and away
against each team in the Wilson division,
which includes No. 1 USC, No. 3 Long
Beach State, No. 9 Hawaii, San Diego State,
and Loyola Marymount. They also face the
members of the Burt DeGroot division once
this season in league play, including three
of the nation's five top ranked teams:
UCLA, Cal State-Northridge, and
Pepperdine.
USC, which returns 1990
Player of the Year Brian Ivje at
outside hitter and all five other
starters, is picked bv WIVA
coaches to claim the Wilson divi
sion crown. Canyon Ceman, the
Cardinal's freshman setter, has
said that USC is playing "head
and shoulders above everyone
else at this point in the season."
The Trojans may have proved
that fact with their three-set
thrashing of Stanford last week.
Long Beach State returns four
starters from a team that finished
runner-up to USC last year after
beating them three times during
the regular season. The 49ers are
picked to finish second in the Wil
son, just ahead of the Cardinal,
who are currently ranked sixth
nationally.
Hawaii, San Diego State, and
Loyola Marymount round out the
coaches' Wilson division choices.
In the DeGroot, UCLA is the
unanimous selection to repeat as
division champion. The Bruins
have what is by far the tallest
team in WTVA history with eleven
players 6-foot-5 or taller, and
return three starters from a team
that finished the 1990 season
ranked third in the country. They
expect to be challenged by Cal
State-Norhtridge, Pepperdine,
and UCSB, but only Northridge
finished last season above .500,
with a 13-12 record. Brigham
Young and UC-Irvine are picked
by the coaches to finish fifth and
sixth, respectively.
The WIVA will place two teams
in the NCAA Final Four in May.
The winner of a playoff between
Wilson and DeGroot division win
ners will then decide the West
region berth. The loser of the
playoff will enter a tournament
with six other WIVA teams for the
Final Four at-large spot.
