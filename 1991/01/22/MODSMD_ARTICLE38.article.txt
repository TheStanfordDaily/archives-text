You could have lit a small town with the
energy of the Cardinal at Harmon Gym this
weekend. The Stanford women's gymnastics
team was in Berkeley to wallop the host
Golden Bears as well as the University of New
Hampshire Wildcats and the UC-Davis Mus
tangs.

Cardinal 185.4

Golden Bears 183.6

Building on the energy of competing well
against perennial power Cal State-Fullerton in
the season opener a week ago, Stanford
increased on its score by almost three points to
tally a 185.4. California took second with a
score of 183.6, followed by New Hampshire
(182.25) and UC-Davis (179.5).
Some of the energy of the team might be
chalked up to youthful enthusiasm, since half
of the team consists of freshmen. They cer
tainly contributed their share to the effort,
taking four of the top six places in all-around
competition.
Kerri Kanuka, also known as Nuke, cap
tured first place in the all-around with a score
of 37.3. This was largely on the strength of a
winning score of 9.55 on bars and a runner-up
score of 9.6 on floor exercise.
"I was really impressed with Nuke's floor,"
said teammate Kerrie Kelley, also a freshman.
"She had never done the whole routine in
practice."
In addition to adding a front flip to one
tumbling pass, Kanuka moved a double-back
flip from her first to her third pass. This adds
the element of fatigue to the already-challeng

ing trick.
Not to be outdone by the newcomers, senior
Jennifer Bloom finished a strong second with
a score of 37.15. She continued to show the
consistency she demonstrated in the first
meet. Bloom's lowest score of the evening was
a 9.1 on bars for a routine which, but for a con
troversial deduction, could have been scored
higher.
The deduction occured for an element
which one judge said was not performed cor
rectly. Coach Breck Greenwood, after consult
ing the illustrated rule book, observed that the
diagram "could have been drawn from Jen
doing the trick." Luckily however, the ruling
did not affect the outcome, so no one was ter
ribly upset by it.
Kelley took third place in the all-around.
Balance beam was her strong event, as she
duplicated her Fullerton performace by finish
ing in a tie for first place in the event.
Yet another freshman, Mollie Brown, took
fifth in the all-around behind California's
Kristen Smythe. Brown joined Bloom as the
meet's only gymnasts to score above nine
points in all four events.
Brown's best showing of the night was on
balance beam, where her lead-off score of 9.55
received praise from Greenwood: "Mollie did a
great job. She really got us rolling on beam."
In fact, all six Stanford competitors avoided
falls on beam, a feat which the team accom
plished only twice all last season. The team
total of 47.35 was also the second-highest in
team history.
Displaying one of the biggest smiles of the
meet on floor exercise, freshman Laurie West
rounded out the top six in all-around.
Sophomore Erin McCann made her season
debut for the Cardinal, competing on bars
despite injuries to both ankles which forced
her to omit her dismount.
McCann should be back at full strength
soon, and if all goes well for the Cardinal gym

nasts, they could have their best season ever,
including a possible trip to nationals as one of
the top twelve teams.
"To qualify for nationals, we need a few
things to happen," Greenwood said. "We need
to stay healthy, have a great regional, and have
good scores before that. I think we're capable
of that."

Cardinal 276.6

Gauchos 257.95

Greenwood feels that a regional score of 188
could qualify for nationals, and — assuming
everything else stays constant — Stanford can
add 1.8 points to its bar score in added diffi
culty, leaving it within a point of the goal.
The next step along the way will be the Car
dinal's home opener Saturday at 7:30 p.m. at
Burnham Pavilion.
Meanwhile, back at the Farm, in its first
home meet of the season, the Cardinal's men's
gymnastics team impressively defeated the
visiting UC-Santa Barbara Gauchos 276.60 to
257.95. With each rotation, the team built its
lead, as Stanford's team totals exceeded UCSB
on every apparatus.
Cardinal gymnasts placed first in each
event except rings, and swept the top 33 places
in four of the six events.
Stanford sophomore Jair Lynch won the
all-around with a score of 56.90, and his team
mate, freshman Marc Booth, placed second,
two points behind. Lynch was the top scorer
on pommel horse and parallel bars, while
Booth won both the vault and high bar.
Freshman Jason Cohen, who placed fourth
in the all-around, placed first on floor exercise
with a 9.8.
