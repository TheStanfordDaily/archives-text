The team, 2-3-1 on the season, was led
by co-captains Steve Buddie and Steve
Yarbrough, who both recorded falls.
Yarbrough and Buddie have excellent
shots at becoming Stanford's first indi
vidual Pacific 10 Conference champions
since 1986.
Buddie, a 167-pound senior, scored
his seventh pin of the season at the 3:52
mark in the match. The Ail-American is
ranked sixth nationally in his weight
class, and improved to 17-2-0. Since
returning to action after suffering from
elbow problems, Buddie has been simply
dominating.
Yarbrough pinned his man 2:10 into
the bout. The 177-pounder picked up his
team-leading 22nd win on the season,
and is currently ranked sixth in the
nation.
Several other wrestlers scored

impressive decisions. At 118, sophomore
Phil Nowick scored five takedowns, win
ning by a tally of 15-6. Freshman Jay
Jackson won his tenth match of the year
with a convincing 14-0 victory in the
126-pound division.
James Dinette also picked up win
number ten. The senior won his 142-
pound bout by a final of 10-2. Dave
Sacks, a junior, had no problems in scor
ing a 9-3 win in the 150-pound class.
Mark Graham, a 190-pounder, came
away with his second consecutive victo
ry, bringing his record to 9-4-0. The
junior was dominant in scoring a 16-0
technical fall, recording six near falls.
More importantly, Graham showed no
signs of being hampered by a painful
knee injury that had sidelined him for
the first two weeks of January.
The Cardinal had been plagued by a
series of early-season injuries. Wrestling
at almost full strength, the team has
returned to its place near the top of the
Pac-10 standings, looking very strong in
its last two dual meets.
Coach Chris Horpel was pleased with
the progress of his squad. "With only one
starter [158-pounder Matt Topham] on
the sidelines, our team is performing as
strong as we thought we would be at the
start of the season."
The Aggies fell to 3-10-0 on the year.
On. Friday, Stanford faces perennial
rival Humboldt State in Burnham
Pavilion. Match time is 7:30 p.m.
