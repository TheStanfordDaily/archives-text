# Weekend conference to focus on health care dilemmas
## 
### Marli Marinelli Staff writer 
Although the United States spends
more money on health care than on
defense, each year more than 37 million
Americans do not receive adequate health
treatment.
This problem and other dilemmas fac
ing medical care in the future will be
among the issues addressed at this year's
You Can Make a Difference Conference,
"Health Care and the Underserved,"
which will be held Saturday.

"At Stanford, most students' parents
have health insurance," said third-year
medical student Ron Park, one of the
annual conference's four student direc
tors. "No one here is likely to walk into a
hospital with a major injury and be
turned away. That's something we don't
see here, and that's why some people
don't realize the enormity of the issue."
The day-long conference will begin at 8
a.m. in Kresge Auditorium. The opening
speaker will be Woodrow Myers, New
York City Commissioner of Health. Myers
will address the nation's medical care

problems them
selves. "[Myers] has
a nationwide per-
spective because he's
seen health care on
both coasts, as well
as the Midwest,"
Park said.

University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy will give keynote
remarks at 8:45 a.m. The event's work
shops, larger sessions and debates will
discuss such topics as access to health
care for people of color and the homeless,

third-world health care and prenatal
medical care. More than 100 speakers will
participate in this year's conference.
The conference will also feature Sen.
John Rockefeller, R-W.Va., who chaired
the Pepper Commission on Comprehen
sive Health Care in the United States last
year. Rockefeller will discuss various ini
tiatives for improving health care from a
national perspective.
The closing speaker will be U.S. Sur
geon General Antonia Novello, who will
discuss ways in which non-physicians can
make a difference in health care.

"A misconception is that this
conference is limited to doctors and
physicians," Park said. "This is a confer
ence for everybody, and non-physicians
can help. It's like educating people about
AIDS; it doesn't require special knowl
edge or medical orientation. It's some
thing that the individual can do."
Park, senior Waseem Noor, second
year business school student Laura Ryder
and senior Glenn Solomon have been
hard at work since April planning the
conference along with more than
125 student volunteers. They pre
dict a turnout of more than 700
people, noting that registration
forms have been coming in from
around the state and nation.
Unlike previous conferences,
this year's will be held in one day
instead of over a weekend. "We
didn't want to stretch our
resources," Park explained.
Another difference is that
organizers have been trying to
make this year's conference more
"interactive," Ryder said. The
conference includes an "Opportu
nities Fair," at which 40 Bay Area
organizations will recruit stu
dents for volunteer health care
programs.
In addition, a "Hands on
Health" program will offer
cholesterol testing and blood
screening as well as general
health tips. Both events will take
place at the Center for Educa
tional Research at Stanford.
The directors said they hope
the war in the Persian Gulf will
not affect the conference,
although they fear that some of
the speakers may cancel. How
ever, they said they do not expect
attendance to suffer.
