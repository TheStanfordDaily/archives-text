Wolverines 132

Cardinal 111

In a meet where Erics won five of the
nine individual swimming events, the
team with two Erics beat the team with
one. For the fifth consecutive year,
Michigan defeated Stanford in a dual
meet, this time by a relatively close
score of 132-111.
The last four times this has hap
pened, however, Stanford has gone on to
place higher at NCAAs, largely because
of the different scoring method which

favors the deeper Cardinal team. Coach
Skip Kenney hopes that history will
repeat itself again come springtime.
He didn't want it to repeat on Friday,
but despite the splendiferous efforts of
Stanford's Eric Maurer and Jeff Rouse,
the normally fickle Fates seemed to be
stuck in a proverbial rut.
Maurer, the Cardinal's representa
tive in the Eric Triumvirate, was the
only home-crowd swimmer to win two
events on the day. He captured the 50-
meter freestyle in 21.05 seconds and the
100-meter freestyle ih 45.57 seconds.
He also anchored Stanford's winning
400-meter medley relay team, which
posted a time of 3:21.01.
Rouse led off that effort with the only
pool record-setting swim of the day, a
48.02-second performance in the 100-
meter backstroke. He also won an indi
vidual event — the 200-meter back
stroke, with a time of 1:48.65. In that
race he was victorious over Michigan's

Eric Namesnik.
Both Rouse and Namesnik had
returned recently from the World
Championships, where Rouse won the
200-meter backstroke. Two other
Wolverines had competed in the Worlds,
Mike Barrowman and Eric Wunderlich.
Barrowman and the two Erics killed
the Cardinal. Namesnik won the 1000-
meter freestyle and the 200 individual
medley. Barrowman made the 200 IM a
1-2 Michigan sweep, and then he won
the 200 breaststroke with Wunderlich
behind him for another 1-2 sweep. Wun
derlich also won the 200-meter
freestyle.
Meanwhile, the Wolverines' vaunted
diving corps did its expected damage,
taking the top two spots in both diving
events. As it turned out, those 26 points
made the difference for Michigan.
But they wouldn't have gotten there
without the exploits of the fabled Eric
Duo.
