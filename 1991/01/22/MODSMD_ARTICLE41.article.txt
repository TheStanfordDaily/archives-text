# Baseball comes back to beat alums

### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
If Stanford reaches the College World
Series in June, the Cardinal won't be
looking back to Saturday's 10-9 exhibi
tion win as the turning point to the sea
son.
But for several Stanford freshman,
the come-from-behind victory over a
star-studded alumni squad was an excit
ing start to their collegiate baseball
careers. The Cardinal, ranked No. 1 in
some preseason polls, launched its 1991
season with a spring training slugfest
against former Stanford greats. The
regular season begins Friday at 2 p.m.
against Santa Clara at Sunken Dia
mond.
Freshman Matt Bokemeier, who is
jockeying for playing time at second
base, slammed three hits and drove in
four runs to fuel the comeback from a 9-
2 deficit. Bokemeier tripled and scored
in the sixth and drove in the winning
run with a two-run single in the eighth,
scoring fellow freshmen Jeff DesJardins
and Rod Meyer.

Meyer, a freshman outfielder from
Eureka, Calif., slammed a two-run
homerun in his first Sunken Diamond
at bat and added a double in the eighth
inning.
"It was fun to play against guys who
are in the bigs and guys who are going to
be there soon, like (Mike) Mussina,"
said Meyer, who connected on a 2-0 fast
ball from former Cleveland Indian Steve
Dunning.
"I was really surprised at the turnout
and it was great weather too," contin
ued Meyer. "What more could you ask
for?"
In the early innings, Marquess might
have been asking for some pitching.
Behind seniors John Reid and Scott
Weiss and sophomore Brian Sackinsky,
Stanford has a number of talented
young pitchers who will need to con
tribute for Stanford to be successful this
year.
Sophomore Jamie Sepeda, 3-0 last
year with a 4.73 earned run average,
started and went two innings, surren
dering two runs on two walks and two
wild pitches. He was replaced by sopho

more Greg Mix, who was touched for
seven runs in his two innings of work.
First baseman Ron Witmeyer, who
helped Stanford to national titles in
1987 and 1988, powered the alumni to
an early 9-2 advantage. Witmeyer drove
in two runs with a bases loaded single in
the third and added a sacrifice fly in the
fourth.
But after Mix, Stanford's pitching
improved. Sophomore pitcher-out
fielder-quarterback John Lynch threw
two innings of shutout relief, striking
out three. Sophomores Scott Alvarez
and Chris Holcombe and junior Jeff
McArthur split up the final three
innings to preserve the win.
McArthur, a converted outfielder
making his first Sunken Diamond pitch
ing appearance, notched the save in the
ninth on a long fly-ball out by Witmeyer
after Mike Aldrete singled and Paul
Carey walked.
Jeff Ballard, a 1985 graduate who
plays for the Baltimore Orioles, started
for the alumni, surrendering a two-run
double to junior catcher Troy Tallman.
