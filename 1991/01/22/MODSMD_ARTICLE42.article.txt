# SLAC, 'becoming complacent,' to examine safety practices
## 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
The Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter began a self-assessment of its health
and safety practices last week in prepara
tion for a visit in July by a team of inves
tigators from the Department of Energy.
SLAC directors said that even though
some conditions at the laboratory could
be improved by greater attention to safety
details, the visit is routine because the
DOE is sending its "tiger teams" to all its
labs.
"We're going to be subjected to some
careful scrutiny, but not because we're
not in good shape," said Mike Allen, direc
tor of SLAC's new environmental, health
and safety division.

Although Stanford operates SLAC, it is
completely funded by the Energy Depart
ment.
SLAC managers said they will try to
raise awareness among employees in the
coming months and will use the self
assessment to uncover potential health
and safety violations.
Newly appointed U.S. Secretary of
Energy James Watkins wrote in a letter to
SLAC director Burton Richter that the
laboratory will not be allowed to operate
if the federal teams uncover serious
health and safety violations.
In addition, if the self-assessment
uncovers any life-threatening problems,
the affected department will be shut
down until violations are immediately
addressed, Allen said.

He mentioned some questions the
SLAC team should ask: "Are all the pas
sageways clear? Are exit signs lit? Are
workers wearing safety glasses? Do we
have proper earthquake restraints? Do
we dispose of radioactive materials prop
erly?"
Allen, Richter and Martin Blume,
director of the Brookhaven National Lab
oratory in Upton, N.Y., where a similar
investigation occurred last year, earlier
this month held informational meetings
on the investigation ior SLAC's 1,300
employees.
At the first meeting, Richter acknowl
edged much needs to be done to improve
some health and safety conditions.
"The DOE means it. And the DOE is
right," he said, adding that some of the

laboratory's safety procedures have
become obsolete.
"We've been careless in following our
own rules," he told the employees. "We're
becoming complacent."
To eliminate this complacence in DOE
laboratories, Watkins authorized the
inspection of all federal labs nationwide.
Allen said Watkins "has set about his task
with a vengeance."
Fixing some hypothetical problems —
such as rewiring parts of the lab — could
require a large amount of time and
money, Allen said. Analyzing environ
mental, health and safety procedures has
already cost the lab about $2 million.
At the employee meeting, Blume also
warned that the visit's cost to the Univer
sity could be high. During the teams' visit

to Brookhaven, the investigators uncov
ered 273 violations that cost $70 million
in repairs. Part of the lab had to be closed
because of radiation leakage.
The 50-member "tiger teams" will
arrive some time after July 1 and could
spend up to four weeks investigating the
laboratory.
Allen appointed a task force of six
senior SLAC department heads to begin
the self-assessment. He said he expects it
to uncover only minor problems.
Allen said the main objective of self
assessment teams will be raising
employee consciousness and paying closer
attention to detail. "We've got to give
equal concern to what the workers are
doing and to environmentally sound ways
of working," he said.
