# Cranston receives new cancer treatment at Stanford
## 
### Amy McConnell 
Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., underwent
a Stanford-developed treatment for
prostate cancer at Stanford Hospital yester
day and was listed in excellent condition.
According to Dr. Malcolm Bagshaw, head
of Stanford's Department of Radiation
Oncology, Cranston "stands an excellent
chance of returning to his robust, healthy
lifestyle" within months after the opera
tion. The senator will probably remain hos
pitalized another five to seven days,

Bagshaw said.
The treatment Cranston received, called
interstitial hyperthermia, combines heat
therapy with radiation. While the treat
ment is not experimental, it is only per
formed in a few U.S. hospitals.
Bagshaw said the new treatment was
used because Cranston's condition was too
advanced for radiation treatment alone.
Standard radiation involves mutation of
the malignant tumor. In the hyperthermia
treatment, extremely high temperatures
are applied to the tumor to prevent it from
repairing itself. Hyperthermia "doubles the

efficacy of radiation," said Bagshaw.
He said Cranston stands a 70 percent
chance of avoiding death by prostate cancer
in the 10 years following his operation.
However, he said he recommended that
Cranston refrain from official duties for at
least a month after leaving the hospital.
Stanford Hospital has the most
advanced system for hyperthermia treat
ment in the United States, Bagshaw said.
As for the future of interstitial hyper
thermia, Bagshaw is uncertain. "We don't
yet know its long-term effects," he said.
Over the past decades, however, hyper

thermia has proven successful in making
cancer cells more susceptible to radiation,
Bagshaw noted.
When Cranston's illness was first diag
nosed by a Senate physician in October, the
senator issued a public statement saying, "I
must concentrate on defeating this thing. I
will not seek re-election ... to the Senate in
1992. ... I look forward to two years in the
Senate free of the burdens and the perils of
campaigning and fund raising."
