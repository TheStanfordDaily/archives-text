# Peace and love: King remembered in birthday tribute
## 
### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Staff writer 
In a speech suffused with mes
sages of peace and love, the direc
tor of a national women's health
organization celebrated Sunday
the birth and life of another peace
messenger — Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr.
Byllye Avery, head of the Black
Women's Health Project, spoke in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium as part of
a service sponsored by Memorial
Church to commemorate King's
birthday.
Although his birthday fell on
Jan. 15, the national holiday for
the late civil rights leader was
observed yesterday.
Avery spoke after worshipers
sang the spiritual "We Shall Over
come." She said, "We know Dr.
King was one of the greatest peo
ple to walk on the face of the
earth. We should draw on his
spirit, energy and soul to guide us.
"Do what King did. Use the
leadership part of you, the activist
part of you, to help others, to
influence others," she added.
The 53-year-old project direc
tor was herself influenced by
King's commencement speech to
her graduating class at Florida's
Talladega University. "He spoke
of love: erotic love, platonic love,

redemptive love. That's how he
influenced my life," Avery
recalled.
Today Avery's philosophy of
love, wedded with a strong respect
for people, is a driving force
behind her Atlanta-based health
project. The organization
addresses women's health issues
such as domestic violence and
infant health, as well as practices
that "make women feel powerless
and erode their self-esteem,"
Avery said.
She encouraged listeners to fol
low the course of unselfish love in
dealing with others in their lives.
"Give those who are less fortunate
a push," she said. "We are all
hooked together. What you do
affects others and what others do
affects you. So we have to learn to
live and work and play together —
all of us."
But Avery also said that touch
ing the lives of others first begins
with oneself. "You have to have
pride in your race [Then] my
challenge to you is to confront
your fear. Your greatest fear is
your greatest source of power,"
she explained.
Although Avery admitted that
challenges will at times make life
difficult, she said success ulti
mately hinges on possessing an
inner strength, like King's.
