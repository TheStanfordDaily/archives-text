# Dignitaries may skip Stanford forum due to terrorist threat

### Howard Libit Staff writer 
Despite the threat of terrorism from the
Persian Gulf crisis, security will not be
increased for this week's first meeting of a
new Stanford advisory council on global
issues.
However, organizers of the International
Advisory Council for the Institute for Inter
national Studies here expect that some for
eign dignitaries will decide not to attend
because of the terrorist threat.
"Since there were already a substantial

number of people whose positions required
it, security arrangements were already in
place," said Thomas Heller, deputy director
of the institute.
"Security is a matter of great concern,"
he added.
Heller refused to comment further on
any of the security measures planned for
the Thursday and Friday conference in
which government officials, business lead
ers and academics will discuss current
global issues.
Among those expected to
attend are Italian Prime Minister
Giulio Andreotti, British Parlia
ment member and former Foreign
Secretary Geoffrey Howe, former
West German Chancellor Helmut
Schmidt, Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J.
and Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Stan
ford.
Although there have not been
any cancellations due to the war
in the Middle East, Heller said he
expects that some may occur in
the next two days.
Although some members of the
council plan to meet with stu
dents, the conference meetings
will remain closed.
