Despite the threat of terrorism from the
Persian Gulf crisis, security will not be
increased for this week's first meeting of a
new Stanford advisory council on global
issues.
However, organizers of the International
Advisory Council for the Institute for Inter
national Studies here expect that some for
eign dignitaries will decide not to attend
because of the terrorist threat.
"Since there were already a substantial

number of people whose positions required
it, security arrangements were already in
place," said Thomas Heller, deputy director
of the institute.
"Security is a matter of great concern,"
he added.
Heller refused to comment further on
any of the security measures planned for
the Thursday and Friday conference in
which government officials, business lead
ers and academics will discuss current
global issues.
