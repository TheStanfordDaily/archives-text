# Outside Campbell's house, pro-war ralliers outnumber peace activists

### Howard Libit Staff writer 
Student pro-war demonstrators con
fronted and, for the first time here, out
numbered anti-war activists in a short and
peaceful rally Friday night outside the
home of Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Stanford.
Braving the rain, both groups exchanged
chants and songs in hopes of gaining the
attention of Campbell, who voted in favor
of a Jan. 12 resolution authorizing the use
of force in the Persian Gulf. However,

Campbell was not at home.
About 25 peace protesters began a can
dlelight march from White Plaza to Camp
bell's house on Alvarado Street in Palo Alto.
Several nearby residents also joined the
peace demonstration.
The pro-war march from 558 Mayfield
was organized by the Stanford College
Republicans to "show our support for Tom
Campbell," said senior Eric Krock. The
demonstrators, two of whom carried Amer-
ican flags, numbered about 50.
Krock called the 2-1 ratio of
war to peace protesters a "historic
moment in Stanford history."
Peace activists, however, down
played the larger number of
Campbell supporters.
"This was not one of our main
events. If we wanted 500 people
here tonight, we would have had
500 people," said Steve Piche, an
electrical engineering graduate
student.
"We are always going to do

more. We will show up first, or
last longer than they will," Piche
added.
Instead of participating in the
rally at Campbell's house, about
25 peace activists attended a five
hour non-violence training ses
sion in El Centro Chicano Friday
night, Piche said. Others were not
there because they planned to go
to the peace protests in San Fran
cisco Saturday.
Protesters from both sides
remained on the sidewalk in front
of Campbell's house during the
rally.
The groups arrived about 8:15
p.m., and the pro-Campbell
demonstrators left about 30 min

utes later. Anti-war activists
planned to demonstrate in front
of Campbell's house most of Fri
day night, but left about 10:30
p.m.
Although there were no lights
on in Campbell's house, peace
activists said they hoped he would
hear their message.
"I think that [going to his
house] is a really legitimate way
to protest. It is the point of
democracy because he is supposed
to support our views," said junior
Jenny Cohen.
"I am here because I am per
sonally disgusted by death," said
senior Mark Kolb. "The act of war
sickens me."

The pro-war demonstrators
said they wanted Campbell to
know that peace activists do not
represent all of public opinion.
"I am here to support my con
gressman Tom Campbell, who is
my congressman both at home
and at school, and to support the
troops in Saudi Arabia," said
freshman Nancy Verlot, a College
Republican.
"I do not think that people
should march to the congress
man's house. It is out of order,"
said sophomore Jaime Punis,
another College Republican, on
his way to Campbell's home.
Not all of the pro-war demon
strators were College Republi

cans. Freshman Steve Brown, a
Democrat, said, "I am here
because I support the action in
the Gulf and support the Presi
dent's policy."
Both groups claimed that the
other side did not offer any solu
tions.
"I am disturbed that some of
the war protests do not seem to be
aimed at the policy and do not
provide any alternative," said
sophomore John Snyder, a pro
war demonstrator. "I hope that
the protests do not get misdi
rected toward the great men and
women serving in the Gulf."
Senior Doug Murphy, an anti
war protester, said, "I am here

because I believe in a world order
in which peaceful exchange can
solve all crises. I realize that the
division between the West and the
Arab world is deep, but war will
only bring a short-term solution."
Peace activists said they were
impressed that the Stanford pro
war demonstrators were finally
making a statement.
Murphy said, "I am glad that
the pro-war movement is out and
saying things. A dialogue can
begin."
About 1,000 people — both
supporters and protesters —
attended Campbell's town meet
ing Sunday.
