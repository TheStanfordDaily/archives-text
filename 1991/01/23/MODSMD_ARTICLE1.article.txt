# IRAQI MISSILE HITS TEL AVIV; 70 HURT
## World & Nation 
### 
TEL AViy Israel (AP) — An Iraqi
Scud missile eluded the U.S. Patriot mis
sile defense system and struck Israel's
biggest city yesterday, wounding at least
70 people, the army said. Three people
died of heart attacks in the raid.
The missile directly hit one apartment
building and damaged about 20 others,
officials said.
It was the most serious attack on
Israel since the Persian Gulf war began,
and the first instance in which a Scud
missile slipped past the Patriots and
caused significant damage.
Brig. Gen. Nachman Shai, the army
spokesman, said the sophisticated Patriot
system that has proved successful in

Saudi Arabia failed to stop any incoming
Iraqi Scuds.
"They did not hit . .. let no one have
any doubt, they did not hit. They were
fired, they did not hit. They will hit the
next time I hope, if there is [one]," he told
Israel radio.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir called
a meeting of key Cabinet ministers this
morning to discuss the latest attack. In
Washington, White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater condemned the attack
as a "brutal act of terrorism" and com
mended Israel for its restraint.
The radio and Israel television said
only one missile was fired, but Col.
Raanan Gissin, the deputy army

spokesman, said it was unclear how many
were involved. He said the army was
investigating.
The Patriot interceptor missiles did
their job against Scuds falling toward
Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, site of a major
Operation Desert Storm base.
The four incoming Scuds, the fourth
missile attack in 24 hours on Saudi Ara
bia, were intercepted and destroyed by
Patriot defense missiles just after night

fall yesterday, witnesses said.
Israel had warned earlier that it would
retaliate if it were attacked again. It
absorbed two earlier missile attacks Fri
day and Saturday, but acceded to U.S.
wishes that it stay out of the war. Twenty
nine people were hurt in those attacks, in
Tel Aviv and Haifa.
Officials said the wounded yesterday
included three people in serious condi
tion, including an infant with a head
injury. Five were reported in moderate
condition, and 62 lightly wounded.
Hospital officials said 10 of the
wounded were children under 12 years
old. The three people who died were all
elderly people who were in buildings that

were not directly hit by the missile,
authorities said.
"We are at war here," Shai said in the
national broadcast. "Missiles are being
fired at us for the third time. There are
hits in residential areas."
Dozens of ambulances and police and
army vehicles rushed to the neighbor
hood where the missile struck. It hit an
area of densely packed, three- and four
story apartment buildings, flattening
one, badly damaging two others and shat
tering windows and shutters for dozens of
yards around.

were heard about three hours
after the missile hit, but Shai
later said they were pulled out.
Bulldozers, cranes and diesel
shovels tore through the rubble.
Hundreds of people gathered
on the other side of the normally
busy boulevard to watch.
A young man ran up, shrieking
in anguish, apparently believing a
friend or relative was in a dam
aged building. Rescue workers,
some still wearing their anti
chemical warfare masks open
around their necks, tried to calm
him.
The missile struck after sirens
sounded throughout Israel at
8:30 p.m. warning of a missile
attack.
No chemicals were detected,
Shai said. Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein has threatened to use
chemical warheads, but so far all
of the Iraqi Scuds have appar
ently been armed with conven
tional explosives.
Robert Cowdrey, a resident of
the damaged area who is origi

nally from Huntington Beach,
Calif., said he had gone into a
sealed room as protection against
chemical attack when the blast
struck.
"It was no more than a minute
after I went in that I heard the
boom and the concussion," he
said. "I was sealing the door with
tape. The concusssion blew the
door open and threw me against a
wall."
Israelis in greater Tel Aviv, an
area of about 1.6 million people,
were allowed to go back to their
jobs yesterday after four days of
being ordered to remain in their
homes with their gas masks ready
for a possible attack.
When the sirens went off,
many were caught outside.
Motorists and bus drivers drove
their vehicles with gas masks on,
and other Israelis donned the
masks in coffee shops and stores.
It was the first attack on Israel
since the United States airlifted
Patriot missiles to the Jewish
state on Saturday, along with 150
U.S. Army technicians to operate
them. They were operational on

Sunday. n
Israel had reportedly agreed to
withhold its retaliation against
Iraq so as to check the effective*
ness of the Patriots.
After the attack, Defense Min
istry spokesman Dan Naveh
warned of retaliation but gave no
hint of when it might come.
"I only want to repeat, Israel
will respond," Naveh said. "We
will decide about the timing. The
United States understands this,

and we shall defend our citizens."

and the first instance in which a Scud
missile slipped past the Patriots and
caused significant damage.
Brig. Gen. Nachman Shai, the army
spokesman, said the sophisticated Patriot
system that has proved successful in

Saudi Arabia failed to stop any incoming
Iraqi Scuds.
"They did not hit . .. let no one have
any doubt, they did not hit. They were
fired, they did not hit. They will hit the
next time I hope, if there is [one]," he told
Israel radio.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir called
a meeting of key Cabinet ministers this
morning to discuss the latest attack. In
Washington, White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater condemned the attack
as a "brutal act of terrorism" and com
mended Israel for its restraint.
The radio and Israel television said
only one missile was fired, but Col.
Raanan Gissin, the deputy army

spokesman, said it was unclear how many
were involved. He said the army was
investigating.
The Patriot interceptor missiles did
their job against Scuds falling toward
Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, site of a major
Operation Desert Storm base.
The four incoming Scuds, the fourth
missile attack in 24 hours on Saudi Ara
bia, were intercepted and destroyed by
Patriot defense missiles just after night

fall yesterday, witnesses said.
Israel had warned earlier that it would
retaliate if it were attacked again. It
absorbed two earlier missile attacks Fri
day and Saturday, but acceded to U.S.
wishes that it stay out of the war. Twenty
nine people were hurt in those attacks, in
Tel Aviv and Haifa.
Officials said the wounded yesterday
included three people in serious condi
tion, including an infant with a head
injury. Five were reported in moderate
condition, and 62 lightly wounded.
Hospital officials said 10 of the
wounded were children under 12 years
old. The three people who died were all
elderly people who were in buildings that

were not directly hit by the missile,
authorities said.
"We are at war here," Shai said in the
national broadcast. "Missiles are being
fired at us for the third time. There are
hits in residential areas."
Dozens of ambulances and police and
army vehicles rushed to the neighbor
hood where the missile struck. It hit an
area of densely packed, three- and four
story apartment buildings, flattening
one, badly damaging two others and shat
tering windows and shutters for dozens of
yards around.

were heard about three hours
after the missile hit, but Shai
later said they were pulled out.
Bulldozers, cranes and diesel
shovels tore through the rubble.
Hundreds of people gathered
on the other side of the normally
busy boulevard to watch.
A young man ran up, shrieking
in anguish, apparently believing a
friend or relative was in a dam
aged building. Rescue workers,
some still wearing their anti
chemical warfare masks open
around their necks, tried to calm
him.
The missile struck after sirens
sounded throughout Israel at
8:30 p.m. warning of a missile
attack.
No chemicals were detected,
Shai said. Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein has threatened to use
chemical warheads, but so far all
of the Iraqi Scuds have appar
ently been armed with conven
tional explosives.
Robert Cowdrey, a resident of
the damaged area who is origi

nally from Huntington Beach,
Calif., said he had gone into a
sealed room as protection against
chemical attack when the blast
struck.
"It was no more than a minute
after I went in that I heard the
boom and the concussion," he
said. "I was sealing the door with
tape. The concusssion blew the
door open and threw me against a
wall."
Israelis in greater Tel Aviv, an
area of about 1.6 million people,
were allowed to go back to their
jobs yesterday after four days of
being ordered to remain in their
homes with their gas masks ready
for a possible attack.
When the sirens went off,
many were caught outside.
Motorists and bus drivers drove
their vehicles with gas masks on,
and other Israelis donned the
masks in coffee shops and stores.
It was the first attack on Israel
since the United States airlifted
Patriot missiles to the Jewish
state on Saturday, along with 150
U.S. Army technicians to operate
them. They were operational on

Sunday. n
Israel had reportedly agreed to
withhold its retaliation against
Iraq so as to check the effective*
ness of the Patriots.
After the attack, Defense Min
istry spokesman Dan Naveh
warned of retaliation but gave no
hint of when it might come.
"I only want to repeat, Israel
will respond," Naveh said. "We
will decide about the timing. The
United States understands this,
too. We are a sovereign country,
and we shall defend our citizens."
Israel's Ambassador to th«
United States, Zalman ShoVal*,
said in Washington that an Israeli
response "will not necessarily
have the character of retribu
tion."
"It's not a matter of an eye for
an eye, it's a matter of how to act
the best way to defend our popu
lation and in order to prevent fur
ther attacks in the future," he
said.

The Israeli censor ordered signif
icant deletions from this report.

TEL AViy Israel (AP) — An Iraqi
Scud missile eluded the U.S. Patriot mis
sile defense system and struck Israel's
biggest city yesterday, wounding at least
70 people, the army said. Three people
died of heart attacks in the raid.

building and damaged about 20 others,
