TEL AViy Israel (AP) â€” An Iraqi
Scud missile eluded the U.S. Patriot mis
sile defense system and struck Israel's
biggest city yesterday, wounding at least
70 people, the army said. Three people
died of heart attacks in the raid.
The missile directly hit one apartment
building and damaged about 20 others,
officials said.
It was the most serious attack on
Israel since the Persian Gulf war began,
and the first instance in which a Scud
missile slipped past the Patriots and
caused significant damage.
Brig. Gen. Nachman Shai, the army
spokesman, said the sophisticated Patriot
system that has proved successful in

Saudi Arabia failed to stop any incoming
Iraqi Scuds.
"They did not hit . .. let no one have
any doubt, they did not hit. They were
fired, they did not hit. They will hit the
next time I hope, if there is [one]," he told
Israel radio.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir called
a meeting of key Cabinet ministers this
morning to discuss the latest attack. In
Washington, White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater condemned the attack
as a "brutal act of terrorism" and com
mended Israel for its restraint.
The radio and Israel television said
only one missile was fired, but Col.
Raanan Gissin, the deputy army

spokesman, said it was unclear how many
were involved. He said the army was
investigating.
The Patriot interceptor missiles did
their job against Scuds falling toward
Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, site of a major
Operation Desert Storm base.
The four incoming Scuds, the fourth
missile attack in 24 hours on Saudi Ara
bia, were intercepted and destroyed by
Patriot defense missiles just after night

fall yesterday, witnesses said.
Israel had warned earlier that it would
retaliate if it were attacked again. It
absorbed two earlier missile attacks Fri
day and Saturday, but acceded to U.S.
wishes that it stay out of the war. Twenty
nine people were hurt in those attacks, in
Tel Aviv and Haifa.
Officials said the wounded yesterday
included three people in serious condi
tion, including an infant with a head
injury. Five were reported in moderate
condition, and 62 lightly wounded.
Hospital officials said 10 of the
wounded were children under 12 years
old. The three people who died were all
elderly people who were in buildings that

were not directly hit by the missile,
authorities said.
"We are at war here," Shai said in the
national broadcast. "Missiles are being
fired at us for the third time. There are
hits in residential areas."
Dozens of ambulances and police and
army vehicles rushed to the neighbor
hood where the missile struck. It hit an
area of densely packed, three- and four
story apartment buildings, flattening
one, badly damaging two others and shat
tering windows and shutters for dozens of
yards around.
