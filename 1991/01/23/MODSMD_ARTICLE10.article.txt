# Iraqis begin torching Kuwaiti oil fields

MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) â€”
Fires roared yesterday at an oil
field in Kuwait, and the U.S. mili
tary blamed Iraq for attacking the
lifeline of the emirate it con
quered.
Oil executives in Bahrain said
blazes raged at two other oil
installations, including one of the
world's most advanced refineries.
The reports sparked an oil
price rise and highlighted fears
that an environmental disaster
could be touched off by the war in
the Persian Gulf.
The U.S. military command in
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, released
aerial photographs which it said
showed Iraq had blown up parts of
the Al-Wafra oil field on Kuwait's

border with Saudi Arabia.
The oil field is managed by the
American oil giant Texaco. Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait share the
crude.
A Texaco spokesman, David
Dixon, said the Al-Wafra field pro
duced 135,000 barrels of oil a day
prior to the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait Aug. 2, adding that this
was an "insignificant amount of
worldwide Texaco operations."
Due to the U.N. trade embargo
on Iraq, no oil has been exported
by Iraq or Kuwait since the inva
sion.
"Earlier today, [the oil field]
was still on fire," U.S. Army Lt.
Col. Greg Pepin said in a briefing
for reporters in Riyadh, the Saudi

capital.
The field, known for its numer
ous bobbing "donkey-pump" oil
rigs, is 50 miles east of the Saudi
border town of Khafji, near where
allied forces are facing off with
Iraqi troops.
Oil industry executives in
touch with their Kuwaiti counter
parts said that storage tanks at
the oil refineries in Shuaiba and
Mina Abdullah, both 50-60 miles
north of Khafji, were also ablaze.
Pepin later confirmed the blazes.
The refinery at Mina Abdullah
is one of the most advanced in the
world and was only fully opened
several years ago.
The oil executives quoted their
Kuwaiti contacts as saying Iraq

blew up the installations because
they are close to the front and the
Iraqis are apparently anticipating
a ground assault by the allied
forces.
"The Kuwaitis assume the
Iraqis are doing it because they do
not want the U.S.-led forces to
make use of the fuel," said one of
the sources, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
But a spokesman for the
Kuwaiti Embassy in Bahrain said
he believed the development sig
naled the Iraqis were preparing to
leave Kuwait.
Some analysts have said Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein plans
to torch the source of Kuwait's
vast wealth before retreating.
