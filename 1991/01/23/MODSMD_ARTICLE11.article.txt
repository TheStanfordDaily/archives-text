NEW YORK (AP) - Chanting
AIDS protesters disrupted the
start of CBS' "Evening News"
and PBS* "MacNeil-Lehrer News
Hour" yesterday before they were
removed and placed in police cus
tody, officials said.
At the PBS broadcast, seven
protesters from ACT UFJ an AIDS
activist group, broke into the sta
tion. "Three of them chained
themselves to the desk. One
attempted to chain himself to
Robin MacNeil," said spokes
woman Susan Assadi.
The protesters carried a sign
which said, "Act up, fight back,
fight AIDS, not Iraq," she said.
Washington-based anchor James
Lehrer told viewers there was a
demonstration in progress and cut
to a news report.
At CBS, viewers saw only one
protester of three protesters
shouting shortly after the broad
cast began. He was quickly pulled
off-camera while Rather directed
a break to a commercial.
The protesters chanted, "Fight
AIDS, not Arabs."
Four protesters also tried to
enter NBC's studios during the
evening newscast, but were
stopped and detained by NBC
security, a network spokesman
said. The four were turned over to
police and left the building in
handcuffs.
There was no demonstration
reported at ABC, which also origi
nates its evening news shows live
from New York City.
The three protesters at CBS
were charged with criminal tres
passing and were given desk sum
monses, which release them on

their own recognizance provided
they give proper identification.
There were no charges filed
immediately against the pro
testers arrested at NBC and the
PBS studios, but Officer Frend
Weiner, a police spokesman, said
they likely would face similar
charges.
Rather referred to the protest
later in the newscast: "I want to
apologize to you for the way the
program started. There were
some rude people in the studio but
they were ejected."
MacNeil told PBS viewers the
disrupters were "a group of people
who call themselves non-violent
demonstrators" from the AIDS
activist group ACT UP
They "complain that we in the
media are spending too much time
and attention on the war in the
Middle East, which they claim will
never kill as many people as are
dying of AIDS," MacNeil said.
"And I told them this program
has spent a lot of time on the
AIDS matter and will continue to
be interested in it and we will be
covering it more in the future," he
said.
Laurie Kotter, a spokeswoman
for ACT UFJ said the CBS disrup
tion was "secretly planned" by
some members of the New York
organization.
She said the organization did
not officially endorse the action,
but "We support what they've
done. We feel that's the only way
AIDS gets in the news."
A statement handed out by the
protesters at NBC said the disrup
tion set the stage for the group's
day-long, citywide protest "today.
