# Crackdown in Baltics jeopardizing relations
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Sec
retary of State James Baker met
with the leaders of Latvia,
Lithuania and Estonia yesters
day amid strong signs of deterio
ration in U.S.-Soviet relations
because of the Kremlin's crack
down on the three republics.
A subdued Baker, posing for
photographers with the Baltic
leaders, said the events of the
past 10 days could jeopardize
the "tremendous progress"
between the superpowers. There
were also expressions of alarm
on Capitol Hill.
After the State Department
meeting, Lithuanian Vice Presi
dent Bronius Kuzmickas said
that Baker indicated that the
United States may take action
against Moscow, but that the
U.S. diplomat was not specific
on that score. Kuzmickas com
plained about the "indecisive
nesa" of the United States and
other Western countries in deal
ing with the issue.
On Capitol Hill, lawmakers
were pushing resolutions aimed
at punishing Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev for the
crackdown.
The House is scheduled to
vote today on a resolution
chastising Gorbachev for the
movement against the indepen
dence movement in Lithuania.
Across the Capitol, Sen. John
Heinz, R-Pa., introduced on
Tuesday a resolution calling on
President Bush to terminate
economic aid, such as trade
credits, to the Soviet Union and

a second binding resolution end
ing Export-Import Bank credits
to Moscow.
"I believe this is the mini
mum that we can do to put the
Soviets on notice that the poli
cies of the past are unaccept
able," Heinz said. "The 'New
world order' we are seeking
requires respect for political and
human rights, not just by mad
men like Saddam Hussein, but
by the world powers as well."
Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell, D-Maine, said
in a floor speech that "force can
not permanently suppress the
desire for independence."
Senate Minority Leader
Robert Dole, R-Kan., told col
leagues: "I think it goes without
saying, this is not a partisan
issue. We want independence
and freedom for the Baltic
states. You [Gorbachev] can't
get the Nobel Peace prize and
then start killing people in the
streets in Lithuania and
Latvia."
At least 19 persons have died
in separate attacks over the past
week by Soviet forces at key
installations in Lithuania and
Latvia. In addition, there were
nighttime explosions at two
hotbeds of pro-independence
sentiment in Estonia.
Also yesterday, the European
Community yesterday delayed
consideration of $1 billion in
food aid to the Soviet Union. A
$540 million technical assis
tance program to that country
may also be reconsidered.
