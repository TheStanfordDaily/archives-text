It is clear that this will
not be a short war; we
should act intelligently

The events of this
weekend have revealed that
this will not be the clean,
short war which Americans, as
could be seen in their buoyant con
fidence of last week, may have
expected.
Whatever confusion might have
existed about the character of the
Iraqi regime and the nature of the
Iraqi threat is being rapidly cleared
up by Saddam Hussein himself.
Hussein has directed the Iraqi
military threat almost entirely at
civilians in the neighboring coun
tries of Israel and Saudi Arabia.
Hussein's treatment of allied
prisoners of war, parading them
before the Iraqi populace and
extorting pro-Iraq statements
from the downed pilots, reveal him
to be the man his enemies have
described.
His claim that Iraq is following
the accords of the Geneva Conven
tion, when it is so obviously not
doing so, and that it is the allies,
not the Iraqis, who are targeting
civilians, reveal him to be a hyp
ocrite as well.
The allied hope that Hussein
had been made prostrate by initial
strikes has been vividly and dra
matically disappointed.
Eight thousand sorties and hun
dreds of missiles have failed to dis
arm the Iraqi military. Analysts
seem unanimously agreed that an
even more difficult ground war will
have to follow.
Clearly, we are in for a long and
protracted struggle against a ruth
less and still potent enemy.
This realization, and the vivid
ness of what is transpiring in the

Gulf, understandably provoke
strongly held opinions on the part
of students.
Peaceful demonstrations of
these sentiments are a welcome
display of students' opinions.
Teach-ins are even better;
unlike demonstrations, which tend
to shed more heat than light,
teach-ins provide a valuable oppor
tunity to educate the campus com
munity.
However, protesters must in all
situations respect students' rights
to their own opinions, their rights
to come to terms with the events of
the world in whatever way they
choose.
Violent protests like those in
San Francisco last week are
deplorable and cannot be tolerated
on this campus.
Nor is disruption of the Univer
sity an acceptable outlet for stu
dents' frustrations. Such media
seeking events inflict the views of
one group upon the campus as a
whole.
Many recent demonstrations on
the Stanford campus have been led
by outsiders to the Stanford com
munity, political advocates who are
the veterans of demonstration
after demonstration.
These seem to be the people
most likely to incite a disruption of
the University, an attention-seek
ing event which is not in the inter
est of Stanford students as a
whole.
Such disruptions are likely to
alienate the very people they
should be attempting to persuade
â€” the great number of Stanford
students whose opinions have not
yet congealed into rigidity, whose
minds remain open to argument.
A crisis like the war in the Per
sian Gulf presents challenges to all
of us, as students and as citizens.
Responding to those challenges in
an open and constructive way will
be a victory for all sides. *
