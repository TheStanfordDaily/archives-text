## Don't let truth die too

A KINDER, GENTLER AMERICA.
Yes it was a vague promise, but who
would have believed it could encom
pass so much war? George Bush has been
in office for two years and taken us to war
two times. It is a frightening rhythm.
Assuming its continuation, and his
reelection, we may be due for six more
wars.
When I heard an American pilot say
last Thursday that Baghdad had been "all
lit up like a Christmas tree" by tlje allied
bombing, it seemed to me not only that
the simile was shockingly inappropriate,
but also that a tragic new meaning had
been given to "a thousand points of
light." Journalists on the scene likened
what they saw to a backyard of sparklers
or a spectacular July fourth fireworks dis
play.
The initial euphoria over the war
stemmed from not only the exaggerated
reports of success, but also these images
of glory. When the footage was eventually
shown, it was like watching our national
anthem acted out: "And the rockets red
glare, the bombs bursting in air ..."
We had been conditioned to see such
displays as a celebration of victory, rather
than the inauguration of a grisly specta
cle of death and destruction. And as
Bush's approval rating and the stock
market soared, the nation appeared to be
responding in true Pavlovian fashion.
The first daylight pictures of residen
tial Baghdad, showing no damage, did
nothing to dampen the euphoria. Tech
nology seemed to have performed another
miracle. The "surgical strike" would
usher in a new world order in which we

could defeat entire villainous nations
without suffering casualties or killing
anybody.
But as U.S. Senator Hiram Johnson
said in 1917, "The first casualty when
war comes is truth." This war is no excep
tion. In the name of military necessity,
reports of casualties and damage are
being tightly controlled by the Pentagon.
The doctrine of overwhelming force
was designed in response to the incre
mentalism of the Vietnam War, in which
public opposition gradually undermined
the military's ability to fight to victory.
The massive ongoing bombing raids of
Desert Storm appear intended, by their
very ceaselessness, to overwhelm not only
Iraqi resistance but also our own media's
ability to assimilate and report them.
Through media manipulation, costs
and failures are likely to be hidden from
us or, when this is impossible, down
played. In an apparent attempt to mini
mize public awareness, U.S. soldiers
killed in action will not receive honors
ceremonies when their bodies are
returned to the military's main East
Coast mortuary at Dover Air Force Base
in Delaware, according to a base
spokesman there.
If our doctrine leads us to move precip
itously to a ground war, rather than to cut
supply lines and patiently starve the Iraqi
troops into submission, it may bring on
rapid American casualties and provoke
the public opposition it was intended to
avoid.
Our ability to assess accurately the
costs of the war (and their proportionality
to our goals) will likely be constrained by

our restricted access not only to informa
tion on American setbacks, but also on
those of the Iraqis. An early Bush admin
istration intelligence report, leaked to the
San Jose Mercury News and reported on
Jan. 17, indicated that on the first day of
the war an estimated 150,000 soldiers of
the Iraqi Republican Guard may have
been caught in a single staging area and
killed or wounded — a scale of casualties
comparable to Hiroshima, though in this
case limited to combatants.
A bombing authority said, "The main
thing you're going to see here that will be
so gory and so bloody will be arms and
legs — pieces of people will be every
where — sort of thinly scattered
around." A Pentagon official admitted
concern that these images, if publicized,
could undermine public support for the
war. Of course, it is the growing reports of
civilian casualties that are more likely to
stir protest.
The truth or falsity of many reports
remains unclear. But as a university com
munity, we have a responsibility to be
united in our relentless demand for accu
rate information so that, whatever our
positions on the ongoing war, they are
grounded in reality, not sparklers.
