## Violent protests in the name of peace are hypocritical 
### 
The war in the Persian gulf
has created many different reac
tions from people around the
nation. It is unquestionable that war, by
its very definition, is something that
should be avoided in every possible man
ner.
Before any bombs were dropped in
Iraq, there were those who supported
war and those who fought for peace.
Unfortunately, now that war is a reality,
those fighting for peace are doing so lit
erally and destructively.
Although I am sure there are many
different opinions regarding Bush's poli
cies and actions, I am urging everyone to
support the troops in the Gulf. Quite
clearly, all sides of the issue desire the
least amount of casualties to occur as
possible, and now we all must join
together and show our support for the
thousands of men and women in service.
Here at Stanford, candlelight vigils
and peace rallies have been successful in
creating a sense of camaraderie and hope
for a quick resolution of the conflict.
On a greater scale, however, in San
Francisco, what were peaceful marches
only a few days ago have turned into vio-

It is difficult for me to fathom how those who
supposedly support and truly desire peace in
the Middle East can set police cars on fire,
break windows, loot businesses and physically
harm one another in the streets of our own
cities.

lent protests. It is difficult for me to
fathom how those who supposedly sup
port and truly desire peace in the Middle
East can set police cars on fire, break
windows, loot businesses and physically
harm one another in the streets of our
own cities. All of this, of course, is done
in the name of peace.
It was disturbing to me to see on tele
vision the activities that went-on in San
Francisco, and other cities, last Wednes
day night. I could not understand how
those who were chanting "peace not
war," were also throwing Molotov cock
tails and breaking into stores.

One resident in my dorm went to
these protests, and, upon her return,
explained how actions that started with
chants like "police for peace" turned into
bashing police cars. Another group of
people urinated from a bridge onto the
police. My resident also explained how
some protesters were drunk and seemed
to be using the war as an excuse "to go
wild" and run around in the streets.
Unfortunately, not all Stanford stu
dents dislike this violent and counter
productive form of protest. It is very
hypocritical to proclaim peace, or even to
claim to be a conscientious objector,

while participating in or supporting such
behavior. These actions were defended as
a way to gain attention and show how
much people are against a war.
However, this is like protesting racial
inequalities while slandering all African-
Americans and therefore loses all credi
bility and compassion.
As the war continues to progress, the
number of deaths will surely increase.
Although no one likes this fact, it seems
strange that some choose to harm or
potentially kill people here in the United
States in the name of peace. It is time to
stop this nonsense. Violent and destruc
tive protests must be stopped.
I urge everyone to help fight for peace
by attending candlelight vigils and other
peaceful gatherings, not violent ones.
American troops are counting on our
support and backing, and I hope that
when the soldiers return they come
home to a population of people who did
not do more damage to the United States
than was done in Iraq.
