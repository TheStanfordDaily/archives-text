# Letters against Aimee Allison's position were based in ignorance
## 
### 
When I read the letters criticizing
Aim6e Allison's position, I was appalled.
The basis of some of these criticisms lies
in ignorance and on an ultra-harsh,
uncompromising stance.
First, two people in Friday's Opinions
section complained about Allison's lack
of fulfillment to her contractual agree
ment. I ask them, if they were in the
same situation, would they try to get out

of their contracts?
Maybe not, but faced with the diverse
forms of death in the Gulf, I would be
trying as hard as I could to stay out of
the desert.
In the real world, a contract is bind
ing, yes; however, it is not an absolute
deal with the devil. If the two parties
involved can arrive at a mutually satis
factory agreement to nullify that con
tract, it can be done.
If Allison, as a conscientious objector,
can come to terms with the military, and
if she can repay th«n for tuition and for
training services rendered, the agree
ment she signed can be effectively
erased.

The other problem I had with most of
the anti-Allison criticism is that people
don't seem to be paying much attention
to her actual views. One main argument
brought against her is that as a combat
medic, "... she may make a personal
sacrifice to help others under 'the ban
ner of moral non-violence.'"
Allison's argument clearly stated that,
as a medic, she would prioritize wounded
in the order of least wounded first, to get
them back to the front. This would be
letting more seriously wounded soldiers
die through inaction. While this may or
may not be true, please get the facts
straight before you address any of Alli
son's opinions in the future.

Personally, although I support Alli
son's right to settle out of her contract,
the timeliness of her pacifistic stance
leads me to believe that the arguments
she is using to convince the military to
let her go are not really her main reasons
for trying to stay out of the Gulf.
I also dislike the fact that she has
asked us to help bear her burden by
soliciting our donations. She should be
given the option to make her peace with
the armed forces, but primary responsi
bility for monetaiy compensation should
lie solely with her, the only person that
has directly benefited from her deal.
