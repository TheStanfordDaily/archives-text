# Teach-in: Learning about the Gulf War
## 
### Peter Cousins, Cecilia Tom David Toy 
Discussions on the military, cultural and his
torical aspects of the Persian Gulf War high
lighted the first day of a teach-in organized to give
students and community members a better
understanding of the current crisis.
Nearly 500 people crowded the seats, aisles
and stage of Cubberley Auditorium to hear six
professors — most of whom were critical of past
U.S. policies on the Middle East — comment on
the Persian Gulf War. The most well-attended
event of the day, the 3 p.m. presentation was
sponsored by the History Department.
The forum began with History Prof. Carl
Degler, who said he agrees with the U.S. involve
ment so far. In response to parallels drawn
between Saddam and Hitler, he compared the cur
rent crisis to World War 11. "Many Americans
continued to insist, .. . even after the invasion of
France, that Hitler posed no threat to them," he
said.
On an opposing note, History Prof. Barton
Bernstein rejected the notion that Saddam is
another Hitler, saying, "It was not Hitler that
went to war. It was Germany with Hitler at the
helm."
Bernstein said calling Saddam "a menace to
the world is giving him too much credit." He
questioned Iraq's stamina after the trying Iran-
Iraq war and pointed out that achieving a nuclear
capability would require not simply the will, but
also scientists, plants and technology as back-up.
History Assoc. Prof. Joel Beinin stressed his
belief that "the war is being fought to preserve an
existing order." He cited the Nixon Doctrine of
the early 1970's — to control parts of the Third
World through "regional surrogates," local
nations allied in practice with the United States.
Beinin said the doctrine led to an $8.3 billion
arms sale to Iran in the 1970s and warned that
the current war may easily turn into a "case for a
permanent U.S. military presence in the Gulf."
Metaphors for the American intervention were
the chief subject of Anthropology Asst. Prof.
Carol Delaney's address. She pointed out the
widespread reference to war as a sport, a surgical
operation and even a sexual conquest by the gov
ernment and media.
She cited the "penetration" and "withdrawal"
of troops, examples that drew laughter from the
crowd. "The metaphors that U.S. officials use dis
tance and anesthetize us to the situation," she
added.

While Guity Nashat of the University of Chicago
called Saddam a despot, she also questioned Bush's
justification of intervention in the Gulf — to pro
tect American values.
"Where were these values when one-and-a-half
million Iraqis were being killed with chemical
weapons?" she asked.
Jack Rakove, a history professor, ended the
forum with a prediction for the future. "The aims
of the U.S. will end up, at least in part, with the
deposition of Saddam Hussein," he said.
Earlier in the day, three computer science
experts kicked off the two-day teach-in with a dis
cussion in Kresge Auditorium titled "The Hi-Tech

Chris Elsenberg - Daily
Battlefield." The speakers
addressed current military estab
lishments and their grip on uni
versities and research facilities
like Stanford.
Computer Science Prof. Terry
Winograd pointed out that the
success of the computer industry
— of "silicon over steel" or "Palo
Alto over Pittsburgh" — has
direct influence on students who
work in Silicon Valley and faculty
members who consult there.
Because of the military's close
ties with industry, Winograd
warned, researchers may become
cheerleaders for the military.
Winograd also criticized Stan
ford's dependency on sponsored
research.
Eric Roberts, associate profes

sor of computer science, directed
the discussion away from Stan
ford to the military's electronic
systems, criticizing their failures.
He cited as an example a 1959
incident in which a ballistic mis
sile's early-warning system
sounded an alert due to radar
echoes from the rising moon.
"In many battlefield situations,
it is not good enough to get it right
the second time," Roberts said,
suggesting that the military
"modify [its] ambitions and scale
them back" even though in real
ity, the success versus failure ratio
of weapons systems is very high.
Along the same line, Gary
Chapman, a Ph.D. student in
political science who served in
Vietnam, argued that although
modern guided missiles will tend
to lower civilian casualties, the
possibility of errors and judgmen
tal failures have to be taken into
account when deploying lethal

weapons.
He said the highly-sensitive
sensor systems now being used in
Operation Desert Storm led to
"tremendous bombing" and "hor
rendous overkill" in Vietnam.
Chapman added he is an advocate
of disarmament for all nations, to
the point of only maintaining
establishments like the Coast
Guard.
Chapman seemed fearful of the
implications of a successful U.S.
military operation against Iraq,
which would make it inconceiv
able for less well-armed nations to
fight the United States in the
future. They would therefore
resort to other forms of warfare
such as terrorism and clandestine
weapons, he said.
Chapman ended his delivery
with a call to end the "mad arm
ing" of the world so that people
can truly think about peace.
The teach-in continued with an

afternoon forum exploring Jewish
cultural identity and the dilem
mas faced by the Stanford Jewish
community.
Rabbi Ari Cartun, who works
with the Hillel Foundation, set
the mood of the discussion, titled
"Being Jewish and Facing the
War," by writing on a blackboard,
"There was another Scud attack
on Tel Aviv 11:00 PST."
He emphasized in the same
message, however, that there was
"no gas" involved in the latest
Iraqi assault on Israel.
The presentation centered on
whether Israel should defend
itself in light of current Iraqi
aggression against the Jewish
state, and Cartun wasted no time
in affirming this position.
He emphasized that he doesn't
like war, but challenged his audi
ence to think of themselves as
Israelis. "What if you had only
four minutes to put gas masks on

all your children and you didn't
know where they were?" he asked.
Cartun pointed out that the
organized Jewish community in
the United States has taken no
official stance on the war. "The
Jewish community is split right
down the middle on whether or
not there should be a war,"
although the community is united
by a common concern for Israel,
he said.
Howard Eilberg-Schwartz, pro
fessor in religious studies, echoed
Kartun's assessment of a rift in
the Jewish community, but identi
fied himself as falling "on the
other side of the split." He said
the Iraqi missile attack on Israel
does not change his anti-war atti
tude.
Eilberg-Schwartz said he con
demns Iraq's missile attacks, but
added, "We need to focus on the
fact that, Israel is both an aggres

sor and a victim."
However, a student said the
missile attacks did change his
mind on the subject. He said he
now supports the idea of an Israeli
retaliation. "War is always the last
resort; it's just that we have dif
ferent ideas of what a last resort
is," he said.
Other students took a strong
anti-war stance and questioned
whether the bloodshed of war
could possibly have any positive
results and whether the people in
the Middle East "are going to feel
any better with the new order we
put in."
One student described the
United States as a "coercive
force" in the Middle East which
"got Israel into a position where it
couldn't defend itself."
The teach-in will continue
throughout today.

However, a student said the
missile attacks did change his
mind on the subject. He said he
now supports the idea of an Israeli
retaliation. "War is always the last
resort; it's just that we have dif
ferent ideas of what a last resort
is," he said.
Other students took a strong
anti-war stance and questioned
whether the bloodshed of war
could possibly have any positive
results and whether the people in
the Middle East "are going to feel
any better with the new order we
put in."
One student described the
United States as a "coercive
force" in the Middle East which
"got Israel into a position where it
couldn't defend itself."
The teach-in will continue
throughout today.
Discussions on the military, cultural and his
torical aspects of the Persian Gulf War high
lighted the first day of a teach-in organized to give
students and community members a better
understanding of the current crisis.
Nearly 500 people crowded the seats, aisles
and stage of Cubberley Auditorium to hear six
professors — most of whom were critical of past
U.S. policies on the Middle East — comment on
the Persian Gulf War. The most well-attended
event of the day, the 3 p.m. presentation was
sponsored by the History Department.
The forum began with History Prof. Carl
Degler, who said he agrees with the U.S. involve
ment so far. In response to parallels drawn
between Saddam and Hitler, he compared the cur
rent crisis to World War 11. "Many Americans
continued to insist, .. . even after the invasion of
France, that Hitler posed no threat to them," he
said.
On an opposing note, History Prof. Barton
Bernstein rejected the notion that Saddam is
another Hitler, saying, "It was not Hitler that
went to war. It was Germany with Hitler at the
helm."
Bernstein said calling Saddam "a menace to
the world is giving him too much credit." He
questioned Iraq's stamina after the trying Iran-
Iraq war and pointed out that achieving a nuclear
capability would require not simply the will, but
also scientists, plants and technology as back-up.
History Assoc. Prof. Joel Beinin stressed his
belief that "the war is being fought to preserve an
existing order." He cited the Nixon Doctrine of
the early 1970's — to control parts of the Third
World through "regional surrogates," local
nations allied in practice with the United States.
Beinin said the doctrine led to an $8.3 billion
arms sale to Iran in the 1970s and warned that
the current war may easily turn into a "case for a
permanent U.S. military presence in the Gulf."
Metaphors for the American intervention were
the chief subject of Anthropology Asst. Prof.
Carol Delaney's address. She pointed out the
widespread reference to war as a sport, a surgical
operation and even a sexual conquest by the gov
ernment and media.
She cited the "penetration" and "withdrawal"
of troops, examples that drew laughter from the
crowd. "The metaphors that U.S. officials use dis
tance and anesthetize us to the situation," she
added.

While Guity Nashat of the University of Chicago
called Saddam a despot, she also questioned Bush's
justification of intervention in the Gulf — to pro
tect American values.
"Where were these values when one-and-a-half
million Iraqis were being killed with chemical
weapons?" she asked.
Jack Rakove, a history professor, ended the
forum with a prediction for the future. "The aims
of the U.S. will end up, at least in part, with the
deposition of Saddam Hussein," he said.
Earlier in the day, three computer science
experts kicked off the two-day teach-in with a dis
cussion in Kresge Auditorium titled "The Hi-Tech

tary presence In the Gulf." Two students, right,

History Corner before the forum was moved to
accommodate the overflowing audience.


Chris Elsenberg - Daily
Battlefield." The speakers
addressed current military estab
lishments and their grip on uni
versities and research facilities
like Stanford.
Computer Science Prof. Terry
Winograd pointed out that the
success of the computer industry
— of "silicon over steel" or "Palo
Alto over Pittsburgh" — has
direct influence on students who
work in Silicon Valley and faculty
members who consult there.
Because of the military's close
ties with industry, Winograd
warned, researchers may become
cheerleaders for the military.
Winograd also criticized Stan
ford's dependency on sponsored
research.
Eric Roberts, associate profes

sor of computer science, directed
the discussion away from Stan
ford to the military's electronic
systems, criticizing their failures.
He cited as an example a 1959
incident in which a ballistic mis
sile's early-warning system
sounded an alert due to radar
echoes from the rising moon.
"In many battlefield situations,
it is not good enough to get it right
the second time," Roberts said,
suggesting that the military
"modify [its] ambitions and scale
them back" even though in real
ity, the success versus failure ratio
of weapons systems is very high.
Along the same line, Gary
Chapman, a Ph.D. student in
political science who served in
Vietnam, argued that although
modern guided missiles will tend
to lower civilian casualties, the
possibility of errors and judgmen
tal failures have to be taken into
account when deploying lethal

weapons.
He said the highly-sensitive
sensor systems now being used in
Operation Desert Storm led to
"tremendous bombing" and "hor
rendous overkill" in Vietnam.
Chapman added he is an advocate
of disarmament for all nations, to
the point of only maintaining
establishments like the Coast
Guard.
Chapman seemed fearful of the
implications of a successful U.S.
military operation against Iraq,
which would make it inconceiv
able for less well-armed nations to
fight the United States in the
future. They would therefore
resort to other forms of warfare
such as terrorism and clandestine
weapons, he said.
Chapman ended his delivery
with a call to end the "mad arm
ing" of the world so that people
can truly think about peace.
The teach-in continued with an

afternoon forum exploring Jewish
cultural identity and the dilem
mas faced by the Stanford Jewish
community.
Rabbi Ari Cartun, who works
with the Hillel Foundation, set
the mood of the discussion, titled
"Being Jewish and Facing the
War," by writing on a blackboard,
"There was another Scud attack
on Tel Aviv 11:00 PST."
He emphasized in the same
message, however, that there was
"no gas" involved in the latest
Iraqi assault on Israel.
The presentation centered on
whether Israel should defend
itself in light of current Iraqi
aggression against the Jewish
state, and Cartun wasted no time
in affirming this position.
He emphasized that he doesn't
like war, but challenged his audi
ence to think of themselves as
Israelis. "What if you had only
four minutes to put gas masks on

all your children and you didn't
know where they were?" he asked.
Cartun pointed out that the
organized Jewish community in
the United States has taken no
official stance on the war. "The
Jewish community is split right
down the middle on whether or
not there should be a war,"
although the community is united
by a common concern for Israel,
he said.
Howard Eilberg-Schwartz, pro
fessor in religious studies, echoed
Kartun's assessment of a rift in
the Jewish community, but identi
fied himself as falling "on the
other side of the split." He said
the Iraqi missile attack on Israel
does not change his anti-war atti
tude.
Eilberg-Schwartz said he con
demns Iraq's missile attacks, but
added, "We need to focus on the
fact that, Israel is both an aggres

sor and a victim."
However, a student said the
