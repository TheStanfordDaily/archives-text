# Teach-in: Learning about the Gulf War
## 
### Peter Cousins, Cecilia Tom David Toy 
Discussions on the military, cultural and his
torical aspects of the Persian Gulf War high
lighted the first day of a teach-in organized to give
students and community members a better
understanding of the current crisis.
Nearly 500 people crowded the seats, aisles
and stage of Cubberley Auditorium to hear six
professors — most of whom were critical of past
U.S. policies on the Middle East — comment on
the Persian Gulf War. The most well-attended
event of the day, the 3 p.m. presentation was
sponsored by the History Department.
The forum began with History Prof. Carl
Degler, who said he agrees with the U.S. involve
ment so far. In response to parallels drawn
between Saddam and Hitler, he compared the cur
rent crisis to World War 11. "Many Americans
continued to insist, .. . even after the invasion of
France, that Hitler posed no threat to them," he
said.
On an opposing note, History Prof. Barton
Bernstein rejected the notion that Saddam is
another Hitler, saying, "It was not Hitler that
went to war. It was Germany with Hitler at the
helm."
Bernstein said calling Saddam "a menace to
the world is giving him too much credit." He
questioned Iraq's stamina after the trying Iran-
Iraq war and pointed out that achieving a nuclear
capability would require not simply the will, but
also scientists, plants and technology as back-up.
History Assoc. Prof. Joel Beinin stressed his
belief that "the war is being fought to preserve an
existing order." He cited the Nixon Doctrine of
the early 1970's — to control parts of the Third
World through "regional surrogates," local
nations allied in practice with the United States.
Beinin said the doctrine led to an $8.3 billion
arms sale to Iran in the 1970s and warned that
the current war may easily turn into a "case for a
permanent U.S. military presence in the Gulf."
Metaphors for the American intervention were
the chief subject of Anthropology Asst. Prof.
Carol Delaney's address. She pointed out the
widespread reference to war as a sport, a surgical
operation and even a sexual conquest by the gov
ernment and media.
She cited the "penetration" and "withdrawal"
of troops, examples that drew laughter from the
crowd. "The metaphors that U.S. officials use dis
tance and anesthetize us to the situation," she
added.

While Guity Nashat of the University of Chicago
called Saddam a despot, she also questioned Bush's
justification of intervention in the Gulf — to pro
tect American values.
"Where were these values when one-and-a-half
million Iraqis were being killed with chemical
weapons?" she asked.
Jack Rakove, a history professor, ended the
forum with a prediction for the future. "The aims
of the U.S. will end up, at least in part, with the
deposition of Saddam Hussein," he said.
Earlier in the day, three computer science
experts kicked off the two-day teach-in with a dis
cussion in Kresge Auditorium titled "The Hi-Tech
