## New method allows sorting of live cells 
### Chris Patil Staff writer 
A new technique for selec
tively removing cells from fruit
fly embryos may enhance sci
entists' understanding of the
earliest stages of animal devel
opment, according to Stanford
researchers.
The procedure, called whole
animal cell sorting, enables an
embryologist to physically sep
arate live embryonic cells that
differ only in the expression
status of a particular gene.
Because the method does
not rely on appearance to cate
gorize cells, it is especially use
ful in the study of developmen
tal phases that occur before
cells have undergone visible
differentiation.
"We have developed a new
method that allows us to purify
cells based not on what they
look like, but on what genes are
active in those cells," explained
Dr. Mark Krasnow, assistant
professor of biochemistry and
lead author of the study.
"Since almost all types of
cells have unique patterns of
genes that are active, we can
take advantage of that to iso
late most types of cells for anal
ysis," Krasnow said.
The ability to study isolated
cultures of cells is important to
embryologists for two primary
reasons: first, they are much
easier to manipulate than cells
that remain in the embryo.
Second, the cultures are sepa
rated from other cells and from
the complex structural changes
that occur during early devel
opment.
"We're actually trying to
sort out certain cell types dur
ing the very beginning of
embryogenesis so that we can
see how those cells talk to other
cells during the stages when

the embryo's organization is
being decided," says Susan
Cumberledge, a postdoctoral
fellow working in Krasnow's
lab.
"We're trying to understand
those interactions, to recon
struct some of those develop
mental events in the test tube
so we can really begin to dis
cover what's happening bio
chemically," she explained.
Whole animal cell sorting
owes itself in part to the avail
ability of thousands of fruit fly
strains whose genomes contain
different expression patterns of
a certain bacterial gene. The
gene, which encodes an enzyme
called beta-galactosidase, has
been recombined with fruit fly
genomes by several labs across
the country.
The beta-galactosidase gene
can be expressed in many types
of cells — for example, in cells
that will become the nervous
system, the gut or other inter
nal organs. Thus, Krasnow's
group is able to choose a strain
of fruit fly that contains the
gene marker in the cells of a
system they want to study, and
then remove from an embryo of
that strain only those cells that
contain the marker.
The removal of desired cells
utilizes a special fluorescent
dye that appears in cells
expressing the beta-galactosi
dase gene, but doesn't affect
other cells.
After embryonic cells are
stained with this dye, they are
processed by a fluorescence
activated cell sorter, a machine
that performs the physical sep
aration of fluorescing from
non-fluorescing cells.
Because cells are not killed
by the technique, scientists can
then allow them to continue
developing in the laboratory.
In the Krasnow study,
researchers chose to examine the
early stages of cells that form the
nervous system. They discovered
that embryonic nerve cells iso
lated by the cell sorter continue
dividing in vitro to form mature
nerve cells and a very primitive
type of nervous system.
The success of whole-animal
cell sorting opens the door to an
increased understanding of the
way embryonic cells communicate
during early phases of differentia
tion. Research in this area has
already begun.
"We've been extending these
studies to other types of cells and

thought to interact with each

other during development," Kras
now said.
The researchers expect the
whole-animal cell sorting to be
useful in embryology of other ani
mals, including worms and mice.
Such further application of the
procedure awaits the insertion of
appropriate genetic markers into
the genomes of other species.
