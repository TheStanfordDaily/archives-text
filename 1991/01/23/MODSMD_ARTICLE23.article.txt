# Scaredycats, ailurophobics: living with fear
## 
### Nancy Volkers Staff writer 
You are rooted to the pave
ment, your heart throbbing like a
drummer working overtime. The
world swims around you like a
damp watercolor; a sourness fills
the back of your throat. You want
to escape. You must escape, but
you cannot move.
The cat finishes crossing your
path and disappears through the
trees. Gradually your heart slows,
and the world comes back into
focus. You have just experienced
ailurophobia, the fear of cats.
But you shouldn't feel alone;
Napoleon Bonaparte was also
afraid of cats, as were Julius Cae
sar and Alexander the Great.
Alfred Hitchcock was afraid of
policemen; Ray Bradbury, of fly
ing.
Over 25 million Americans
have some type of phobia. Dr.
Robert Decker, a Palo Alto psy
chologist, expanded on this figure.
"Almost everyone has at least one
phobia — it's perfectly normal."
A phobia is not just a fear; it is
an exaggerated fear involving the
perception of a high degree of risk
in a situation that is relatively
safe.
Phobics recognize, when not in
a phobic situation, that their fear
is irrational, but this realization
does not quell the symptoms.
Some situations may actually
contain elements of danger; a fly
ing phobia, for example, is not
entirely unfounded. But the closer
the phobic is to the situation, the
greater the danger seems.
Sigmund Freud believed that a
phobia was the displacement of
fear from something the person
felt uncomfortable fearing to a
more emotionally acceptable fear.
This theory is seen as widely over
simplified and unrealistic.
Today, there are two main the
ories on the cause of phobias,
according to Dr. Susan Nolen-
Hoeksema, assistant professor of
psychology at Stanford. "One is
biological theory. This is basically
a guess."

Dr. Marty Seligman, a psychol
ogist at the University of Pennsyl
vania, has researched the biologi
cal theory of phobias, and hypoth
esized that humans are geneti
cally "wired" to fear certain evolu
tionarily dangerous things, such
as heights or certain animals.
The other theory is the more
widely accepted behavioral theory,
in which a person experiences
anxiety in a certain situation and

thus becomes phobic of that situa
tion because she does not want to
re-experience the anxiety.
"For example," said Nolen-
Hoeksema, "they were out on a
bridge during an earthquake, so
now they're afraid of bridges —
they avoid the situation because
they don't want to feel the fear
they felt once."
The anxiety experienced during
a situation produces a state of

high alertness and stress. When
the same situation arises later, the
anxiety reappears.
The only way the individual
can reduce the anxiety is to escape
from the situation or avoid it alto
gether. Phobic anxiety can be com
pared to pain; if you burn your
hand on a hot stove, you are likely
not to touch the stove again.
"Every person on Earth experi
ences anxiety — if you didn't,
you'd be dead," Wheeler said. But
can anyone become phobic? The
answer seems to be no, but the
reasons are still in the making.
Certain groups may be more
vulnerable to phobias. Wheeler
stated that people from alcoholic
homes and victims of mental and
physical abuse are more prone to
phobias. Decker explained that
many of his female patients have
also been victims of sexual or
physical abuse. These experiences
lower the self-esteem and provide
a forum for phobias.
For example, if, while speaking
to a group, a phobic makes a mis
take, he may become focused on
the audience's reaction and visu
alize permanent harm to his repu
tation. This will most likely cause
him to commit further error,
because he has lost concentration.
Public speaking is known as a
"social phobia." These phobias
involve being exposed to public
scrutiny and perhaps doing some
thing humiliating or embarrass
ing.
This hardly seems like a pho
bia; certainly everyone is afraid of
making a fool of himself in public.
But a phobia goes beyond being
afraid to being terrified out of pro
portion to the scope of the actual
danger or consequences involved.
Unfortunately, once this pho
bia rears its head, the phobic
enters a vicious cycle. An irra
tional fear of humiliation while
giving a speech may cause the per
son to perform substandardly or
to commit errors, causing embar
rassment which may lead to fur
ther errors.
