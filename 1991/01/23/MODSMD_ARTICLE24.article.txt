# Recycling: what goes where
## 
### Jessica Hirst Staff writer 
Stanford community members may be filled with
well-intentioned zeal for recycling, but that doesn't
necessarily mean people know how to recycle cor
rectly, as any Recycling Center employee will tell
you.
The process is quite simple, but since there have
been a few changes since last school year you may
want to cut out the chart on the left and post it above
the recycling bins in your residence or office.
By doing our part to sort recyclables correctly, we
will enable Recycling Center employees to spend
their time expanding recycling at Stanford rather
than digging through barrels.
Where does it go?
You may wonder what happens to all your paper,
cardboard, glass and cans after you leave them in the
green barrels.
The barrels are taken to the Stanford Recycling
Center on Pampas Lane, where the materials are
further sorted and packed into bales and larger
metal bins. These, in turn, are sold and shipped off
to be processed into new materials, often packaging.
Unfortunately, the market for recycled materials
has been falling recently, due to several related fac
tors.
First, the economic recession in the United States
has reduced consumer demand for products, which

in turn has led to a decrease in the demand for pack
aging. . ,
Although Barb Voss, Program Manager of the
Stanford Recycling Center, thinks reduced consump
tion is a positive step overall, the decrease "does
lower demand for recycled fibers, especially since not
all paper is made from recycled fibers," she said.
Second, the consumer economies of South East
Asia, which comprise the main importers of recycled
goods from the United States, have been slowing
down their orders for recycled materials.
Third, increased clearcutting in the northwestern
United States has depressed the virgin pulp market
because of oversupply. That, in turn, increases com
petition and forces down the prices on the recycled
market.
Furthermore, the government subsidizes virgin
pulp by constructing access roads into national
forests and charging lumber companies unrealisti
cally low prices for cutting rights; factors \tfiich also
lead to reduced virgin pulp prices.
The state of California has recognized the need to
reduce its solid waste stream, and a recent law man
dates a 25 percent decrease in solid waste by the year
1995, and a 50 percent decrease by the year 2000.
Alter the due date, jurisdictions in violation of the
law will be fined $10,000 on a daily basis until they
comply.
Stanford generates more than 16,000 tons of
garbage a year, and only 20 percent of that garbage is
currently being recycled.
