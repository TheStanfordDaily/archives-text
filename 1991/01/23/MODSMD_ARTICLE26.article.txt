# Bugs' cut-and-dry guide to dry-cleaners

f~\ .What's so dry about dry
x!y •cleaners? And what is
"Martinizing" anyway?
A, Dry cleaners aren't really
• dry; they're just not wet —
with water anyway.
The secret ingredient used
nowadays in dry cleaning is per
chloroethylene, an organic solvent
that also has, on occasion, been
used by veterinarians to treat
worms in poor, unfortunate ani
mals. (We know its tempting, but
please don't take your room
mate's cat downtown for
overnight service — it will really
mess up the pressing machine.)
But, before "your favorite suit"
actually gets the perch lor treat

ment in what looks like a giant
washing machine, it's tagged, the
pockets are checked for items
such as not-your-wife's earrings,
and then the garment goes to the
spotters, to try to remove not
your-wife's lipstick.
A vast arsenal of thoroughly
effective spot cleaners can be
deployed at will to remove just
about anything, including buttons
and sequins. (Only kidding!)
Garments go into the cleaning
machine dry, get all wet with sol
vent, tumble around, and then
come out of the machine dry, (yet
another reason to call dry-clean
ing dry)
Perchloroethylene is nasty
stuff, so cleaning is done in a
closed system to minimize the
exposure to workers. After the
clsar.ing, the garments are

pressed, bagged and hung on what
is for us the best part of the dry
cleaners — that conveyor belt
hanger mover thing that goes
around twice before it stops at
"your favorite suit."
So, now for the best part, what
is "Martinizing?" I hope you're
not as disappointed as I was to
hear this, but it's the same as reg
ular dry cleaning, only warped
through the process in one short
hour.
Another mystery of the uni
verse solved.
