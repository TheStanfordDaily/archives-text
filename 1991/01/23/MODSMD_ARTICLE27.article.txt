# Shelter manager cares for all creatures, great and small
## Nature-lover Amy Izzo-Olander keeps Palo Alto Wildlife Rescue running smoothly 
### Nancy Volkers 
As soon as Amy Izzo-Olander
entered her new hometown of
Fremont, California, she was
given a speeding ticket.
Seven hours later, she experi
enced the 7.1 Loma Prieta earth
quake of October 17, 1989.
"Needless to say, I didn't feel
very welcome," she said. "In fact,
I was in a restaurant [at the time
of the quake] and I just wanted to
crawl underneath the bar and
never come out."
Izzo-Olander and her husband
came to California to work: Lars
with the Federal Aviation Admin
istration as an air-traffic con
troller in San Carlos, and Amy as
shelter manager of Palo Alto's
Wildlife Rescue, where she has
overseen the care of over 3,000
birds and mammals since she
began the job.
Izzo-Olander has been taking
care of animals since her child
hood on Long Island, where she
was born in 1962.
"I was always running around
in the woods with my cousin.
We'd bring home all kinds of crit
ters. When my mom and my aunt
would take us out someplace
fancy, I'd want to put on my boots
and go out and play in the woods,"
she said.
She mtgored in environmental
science at the State University of
New York at Binghamton, consid
ered to be the state's finest
"SUNY school." Her post-gradu
ate jobs dealt mainly with envi
ronmental education; she worked
for the Audubon Society, the Sci
ence Museum of Long Island, and
the Department of Community
Services in Sierra Vista, Ariz. —
"a little four-mile-long town"
where Lars was stationed with the
Army after their 1984 marriage.
After three years in Arizona,
her husband became employed by
the Federal Aviation Administra
tion and was sent to San Carlos.
Izzo-Olander found the
Wildlife Rescue position in the
classifieds. "There was just this
tiny ad: 'Shelter manager want
ed,' and a phone number. I called,
I interviewed, I got the job."
The job is a demanding one;

she oversees the running and
maintenance of the shelter, han
dles administrative duties,
smooths over differences, and
gives advice whenever needed.
And she always finds time for edu
cation.

'Maybe Big Green
was just too big.
There's all this
stuff in the booklet
they give you, and
it's almost to the
point of 'oh, yeah,
and you're not
allowed to sneeze
on Tuesdays.'
People might have
gotten fed up with
it ail.'

Izzo-Olander hopes to make
Wildlife Rescue as much an educa
tional center as an animal shelter.
"People need to understand ani
mals," she said.
"When we were looking for our
puppy" — a year-old beagle-bor
der collie mix named Bernie —
"we saw all these older dogs at the
[Palo Alto] shelter that people had
given up when they moved. That's
such a lame excuse — it's like
leaving your children behind."
Izzo-Olander's strong views on
animals coupled with her low-key
personality provide someone vol
unteers can both open up to and
look up to.
"I call her Amy Amiable," said
volunteer Maryann Fazzio. "She's
never angry or flustered. She's
outgoing in an unassuming way.
Amy has an excellent sense of
humor, but looking at her you
wouldn't know it — she's so
quiet."
"Amy is your basic nice per
son," offered volunteer Lorna
Wadsworth, who talked while

soothing an injured duck, her rub
ber-gloved hands smoothing its
oily feathers.
"'Nice' has such a bad connota
tion these days, but for her it's
true. She gets the job done, with
out a lot of fuss," Wadsworth said
and then paused; "She's also
doing it for not a lot of money, so
she must like it."
Izzo-Olander likes it enough to
give some of her limited spare
time to the San Francisco Bay
Wildlife Refuge as an educator
and volunteer. She spends many
of her remaining free hours with
Lars and Bernie (who was named
for Bernoulli's Theorem, which
explains why airplanes fly).
She also tries to spend time
outdoors, and California has more
than enough to offer her. "It has a

lot of parks, bike trails, hiking
paths; it's very geared toward
hanging out and recreating," she
said.
She wonders, however, about
the state's dilemma with the envi
ronment. On one hand, "I think
people are more aware [here] of
recycling and cleaning. My par
ents' recycling program on Long
Island is ridiculous; they have to
separate all their glass by color,
and tie their newspapers together
in sized bundles."
On the other hand, when asked
if she thought California was
ahead of the rest of the nation on
environmental issues, she
laughed somewhat bitterly. "If
you'd asked me that [on Election
Day], I would've said yes. Now. ..
"Maybe Big Green (Proposition

128) was just too big. There's all
this stuff in the booklet they give
you, and it's almost to the point of
'Oh, yeah, and you're not allowed
to sneeze on Tuesdays.' People
might have gotten fed up with it
all."
The problem, said Izzo-Olan
der, is that "we tend to think in
the short term, when we should be
thinking in the long term. In 50
years, there may be no wood, but
no one gets elected for the long
term, so we don't really care."
Being involved with the envi
ronment for her entire life has
branded her, in a way. "When I go
home, I get blamed for everything.
I was blamed for the spotted owl. I
was blamed for the barge that
drove around spilling garbage
everywhere. It's all my fault."

Amy Izzo-Olander poses with one of her fine feathered friends at the Palo Alto Wildlife Rescue. As shel
ter manager, Izzo-Olander has overseen the care of over 3,000 birds and mammals since she began the
job three years ago.
As soon as Amy Izzo-Olander
entered her new hometown of
Fremont, California, she was
given a speeding ticket.
Seven hours later, she experi
enced the 7.1 Loma Prieta earth
quake of October 17, 1989.
"Needless to say, I didn't feel
very welcome," she said. "In fact,
I was in a restaurant [at the time
of the quake] and I just wanted to
crawl underneath the bar and
never come out."
Izzo-Olander and her husband
came to California to work: Lars
with the Federal Aviation Admin
istration as an air-traffic con
troller in San Carlos, and Amy as
shelter manager of Palo Alto's
Wildlife Rescue, where she has
overseen the care of over 3,000
birds and mammals since she
began the job.
Izzo-Olander has been taking
care of animals since her child
hood on Long Island, where she
was born in 1962.
"I was always running around
in the woods with my cousin.
We'd bring home all kinds of crit
ters. When my mom and my aunt
would take us out someplace
fancy, I'd want to put on my boots
and go out and play in the woods,"
she said.
She mtgored in environmental
science at the State University of
New York at Binghamton, consid
ered to be the state's finest
"SUNY school." Her post-gradu
ate jobs dealt mainly with envi
ronmental education; she worked
for the Audubon Society, the Sci
ence Museum of Long Island, and
the Department of Community
Services in Sierra Vista, Ariz. —
"a little four-mile-long town"
where Lars was stationed with the
Army after their 1984 marriage.
After three years in Arizona,
her husband became employed by
the Federal Aviation Administra
tion and was sent to San Carlos.
Izzo-Olander found the
Wildlife Rescue position in the
classifieds. "There was just this
tiny ad: 'Shelter manager want
ed,' and a phone number. I called,
I interviewed, I got the job."
The job is a demanding one;

she oversees the running and
maintenance of the shelter, han
dles administrative duties,
smooths over differences, and
gives advice whenever needed.
And she always finds time for edu
cation.

'Maybe Big Green
was just too big.
There's all this
stuff in the booklet
they give you, and
it's almost to the
point of 'oh, yeah,
and you're not
allowed to sneeze
on Tuesdays.'
People might have
gotten fed up with
it ail.'

Izzo-Olander hopes to make
Wildlife Rescue as much an educa
tional center as an animal shelter.
"People need to understand ani
mals," she said.
"When we were looking for our
puppy" — a year-old beagle-bor
der collie mix named Bernie —
"we saw all these older dogs at the
[Palo Alto] shelter that people had
given up when they moved. That's
such a lame excuse — it's like
leaving your children behind."
Izzo-Olander's strong views on
animals coupled with her low-key
personality provide someone vol
unteers can both open up to and
look up to.
"I call her Amy Amiable," said
volunteer Maryann Fazzio. "She's
never angry or flustered. She's
outgoing in an unassuming way.
Amy has an excellent sense of
humor, but looking at her you
wouldn't know it — she's so
quiet."
"Amy is your basic nice per
son," offered volunteer Lorna
Wadsworth, who talked while

soothing an injured duck, her rub
ber-gloved hands smoothing its
oily feathers.
"'Nice' has such a bad connota
tion these days, but for her it's
true. She gets the job done, with
out a lot of fuss," Wadsworth said
and then paused; "She's also
doing it for not a lot of money, so
she must like it."
Izzo-Olander likes it enough to
give some of her limited spare
time to the San Francisco Bay
Wildlife Refuge as an educator
and volunteer. She spends many
of her remaining free hours with
Lars and Bernie (who was named
for Bernoulli's Theorem, which
explains why airplanes fly).
She also tries to spend time
outdoors, and California has more
than enough to offer her. "It has a

lot of parks, bike trails, hiking
paths; it's very geared toward
hanging out and recreating," she
said.
She wonders, however, about
the state's dilemma with the envi
ronment. On one hand, "I think
people are more aware [here] of
recycling and cleaning. My par
ents' recycling program on Long
Island is ridiculous; they have to
separate all their glass by color,
and tie their newspapers together
in sized bundles."
On the other hand, when asked
if she thought California was
ahead of the rest of the nation on
environmental issues, she
laughed somewhat bitterly. "If
you'd asked me that [on Election
Day], I would've said yes. Now. ..
"Maybe Big Green (Proposition

128) was just too big. There's all
this stuff in the booklet they give
you, and it's almost to the point of
'Oh, yeah, and you're not allowed
to sneeze on Tuesdays.' People
might have gotten fed up with it
all."
The problem, said Izzo-Olan
der, is that "we tend to think in
the short term, when we should be
thinking in the long term. In 50
years, there may be no wood, but
no one gets elected for the long
term, so we don't really care."
Being involved with the envi
ronment for her entire life has
branded her, in a way. "When I go
home, I get blamed for everything.
I was blamed for the spotted owl. I
was blamed for the barge that
drove around spilling garbage
everywhere. It's all my fault."
