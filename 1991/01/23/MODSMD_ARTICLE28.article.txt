## Super Bowl XXV leaves something to be desired 
### 
Great. Just what everybody wanted.
A Super Bowl between two New
York teams. The Eastern Seaboard
thinks it's the center of the universe as it
is. To them nothing outside of the Boston,
New York or DC areas matter. They dis
covered that the Golden Gate is not the
only bridge connecting San Francisco
with the Bay Area when they got to watch
that other bridge collapse during the
World Series; I mean, Loma Prieta earth
quake.
Now we all get to watch six days of pre
game hype about the New York City Arro
gants versus the New York Country
Bumpkins. Thrilling. Like anyone west of
the Mississippi gives a hoot about either
the Giants or the Bills.
Poor ABC. I have a wild guess that
they were pulling for at least one, if not
both, of the Niners or Raiders to make it.
National exposure a good Super Bowl
makes (at least to the networks). Buffalo
just isn't a household word yet.
At least Madison Avenue is excited.
Eight million obnoxious New York City
inhabitants will be glued to their TV sets,
and hopefully running out and buying all
those wonderful products advertised at
$800,000 per 30-second spot. And don't

worry; the agencies will definitely be aim
ing their messages at the inhabitants of
the Rotting Apple and environs.
The good news is that, finally, there is
a new face competing in the American
sports event. Denver has been there one
too many times, especially considering its
record on Super Sunday, not to mention
its average losing spread. It would have
been nice to see the Raiders make a
return, even though they're still the
Traitors to me. Buffalo, however, is one of
the nine teams never ever to have stepped
on the golden field of a Super Bowl sta
dium. Maybe parity is finally coming the
way of the NFL.
Speaking of Buffalo, look for the AFC
to finally pull one out. Not that I hold a
grudge against the Giants — the Niners

didn't deserve to win Sunday — but the
Bills simply looked awesome while chew
ing up and spitting out the hapless
Raiders, who previously looked like a
pretty decent team themselves. It doesn't
look like anyone is stopping Jim Kelly and
his Bills this January.
The war, however, has put a damper on
all sports, and especially on the quickly
approaching 25th Super Sunday. Aside
from the threat of terrorist attack —
canine bomb squads have already combed
Tampa's stadium, every car trunk will be
searched when it enters stadium parking
lots, and no portable radios or TV's are
allowed — the celebratory atmosphere
usually surrounding the playoffs and The
Game has been subdued by the conflict in
the Gulf.
Unfortunately, it takes a time of crisis
to make this happen, but Americans have
actually realized the place of sports in the
Big Scheme of Things. Behind a war, at
least. Look for fewer people to watch the
game (besides the fact that it's a regional
conflict) and lots of news bulletins to
interrupt the game broadcast.
The Super Bowl organizing committee
has given in to the somber mood as well.
The Commissioner's Party — the event of

the year in football circles — has been
canceled, as have a number of other pre
and post-game festivities. The immediate
beneficiaries are grumbling, but overall
it's a good move.
I'm the last to criticize the place of
sports in American culture, but some
times athletic competitions just don't
matter, and now is one of those occasions.
Participants of Saturday's Shriners
East-West Football Classic have
taken advantage of the hesitant
atmosphere surrounding sports to flake
on the game, but withdrawals from com
petition have nothing to do with Amer
ica's armed conflict. The charity game,
supposedly a showcase for collegiate foot
ball's best and brightest 74 seniors, is
becoming a find-enough-bodies-to-com
pete classic.
There are always injuries forcing
selectees to cancel in this final collegiate
gridiron hurrah, but it's getting a little
out of control. Fourteen out of the East's
37 invitees have already pulled out, and
three more from the West squad have
cried sick.
Sure, by the end of January guys are
allowed to be beat up, but 20 percent of

the team? Replacements are even falling
right and left, to real or imaginary
injuries, that is. Virginia QB Shawn
Moore, Illinois' Moe Gardner and Nevada
DB Bernard Ellison are among the well
known AWOL's.
Credit goes to Stanford's wide reciever
Ed McCaffrey and cornerback Kevin
Scott, who are not only holding up on
their commitments, but are making the
rounds to the charity events as well. Hav
ing the event at their back door, and home
stadium, is probably more than a little
incentive.
But why should players need incentive
to play in an all-star showcase? Sure, it's
late in the game, so to speak, but it's for a
good cause. Besides, why not take a little
risk to be checked out by a few more NFL
scouts. It usually can't hurt, especially
with with The Draft only three months
and counting.
Well, this is it. The last weekend of
competitive football for seven months.
Ei\joy. And bring on baseball!

Debbie Spander will be studying or doing
something else as exciting rather than
waste her time watching the Super Bowl
this Sunday.

risk to be checked out by a few more NFL
scouts. It usually can't hurt, especially
with with The Draft only three months
and counting.
Well, this is it. The last weekend of
competitive football for seven months.
Ei\joy. And bring on baseball!

Debbie Spander will be studying or doing
something else as exciting rather than
waste her time watching the Super Bowl
this Sunday.

Great. Just what everybody wanted.
A Super Bowl between two New
York teams. The Eastern Seaboard
thinks it's the center of the universe as it
is. To them nothing outside of the Boston,
New York or DC areas matter. They dis
covered that the Golden Gate is not the
only bridge connecting San Francisco
with the Bay Area when they got to watch
that other bridge collapse during the
World Series; I mean, Loma Prieta earth
quake.
Now we all get to watch six days of pre
game hype about the New York City Arro
gants versus the New York Country
Bumpkins. Thrilling. Like anyone west of
the Mississippi gives a hoot about either
the Giants or the Bills.
Poor ABC. I have a wild guess that
they were pulling for at least one, if not
both, of the Niners or Raiders to make it.
National exposure a good Super Bowl
makes (at least to the networks). Buffalo
just isn't a household word yet.
At least Madison Avenue is excited.
Eight million obnoxious New York City
inhabitants will be glued to their TV sets,
and hopefully running out and buying all
those wonderful products advertised at
$800,000 per 30-second spot. And don't

worry; the agencies will definitely be aim
ing their messages at the inhabitants of
the Rotting Apple and environs.
The good news is that, finally, there is
a new face competing in the American
sports event. Denver has been there one
too many times, especially considering its
record on Super Sunday, not to mention
its average losing spread. It would have
been nice to see the Raiders make a
return, even though they're still the
Traitors to me. Buffalo, however, is one of
the nine teams never ever to have stepped
on the golden field of a Super Bowl sta
dium. Maybe parity is finally coming the
way of the NFL.
Speaking of Buffalo, look for the AFC
to finally pull one out. Not that I hold a
grudge against the Giants — the Niners

didn't deserve to win Sunday — but the
Bills simply looked awesome while chew
ing up and spitting out the hapless
Raiders, who previously looked like a
pretty decent team themselves. It doesn't
look like anyone is stopping Jim Kelly and
his Bills this January.
The war, however, has put a damper on
all sports, and especially on the quickly
approaching 25th Super Sunday. Aside
from the threat of terrorist attack —
canine bomb squads have already combed
Tampa's stadium, every car trunk will be
searched when it enters stadium parking
lots, and no portable radios or TV's are
allowed — the celebratory atmosphere
usually surrounding the playoffs and The
Game has been subdued by the conflict in
the Gulf.
Unfortunately, it takes a time of crisis
to make this happen, but Americans have
actually realized the place of sports in the
Big Scheme of Things. Behind a war, at
least. Look for fewer people to watch the
game (besides the fact that it's a regional
conflict) and lots of news bulletins to
interrupt the game broadcast.
The Super Bowl organizing committee
has given in to the somber mood as well.
The Commissioner's Party — the event of

the year in football circles — has been
canceled, as have a number of other pre
and post-game festivities. The immediate
beneficiaries are grumbling, but overall
it's a good move.
I'm the last to criticize the place of
sports in American culture, but some
times athletic competitions just don't
matter, and now is one of those occasions.
Participants of Saturday's Shriners
East-West Football Classic have
taken advantage of the hesitant
atmosphere surrounding sports to flake
on the game, but withdrawals from com
petition have nothing to do with Amer
ica's armed conflict. The charity game,
supposedly a showcase for collegiate foot
ball's best and brightest 74 seniors, is
becoming a find-enough-bodies-to-com
pete classic.
There are always injuries forcing
selectees to cancel in this final collegiate
gridiron hurrah, but it's getting a little
out of control. Fourteen out of the East's
37 invitees have already pulled out, and
three more from the West squad have
cried sick.
Sure, by the end of January guys are
allowed to be beat up, but 20 percent of

the team? Replacements are even falling
right and left, to real or imaginary
injuries, that is. Virginia QB Shawn
Moore, Illinois' Moe Gardner and Nevada
DB Bernard Ellison are among the well
known AWOL's.
Credit goes to Stanford's wide reciever
Ed McCaffrey and cornerback Kevin
Scott, who are not only holding up on
their commitments, but are making the
rounds to the charity events as well. Hav
ing the event at their back door, and home
stadium, is probably more than a little
incentive.
But why should players need incentive
to play in an all-star showcase? Sure, it's
late in the game, so to speak, but it's for a
good cause. Besides, why not take a little
risk to be checked out by a few more NFL
scouts. It usually can't hurt, especially
with with The Draft only three months
and counting.
Well, this is it. The last weekend of
competitive football for seven months.
