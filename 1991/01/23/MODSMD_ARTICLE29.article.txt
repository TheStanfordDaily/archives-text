# The
						Bills are clearly the favorites to win

TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — It won't
be 51-3. Not even close to that.
It probably won't be 17-13,
either, although it likely will be
respectable for the Giants.
Still, the Buffalo Bills, in their
first Super Bowl, will win their
first Super Bowl.
Why, particularly since history
tells us that few teams appearing
in their first Super Bowl beat a
club that already has been there?
Let's start with the fact the
Bills simply are the NFL's most
talented team. Offensively, they
have been overwhelming, particu
larly in the playoffs. Defensively,
they have the right weapons to
shut down the Giants, who don't
exactly scare anyone with their
attack.
Also, despite being in their first
NFL championship game, the
Bills are well-tested. They've over
come self-created adversity stem
ming from internal feuds that
earned them the tag "Bickering
Bills." Often, erasing dissension is
tougher than any on-field oppo
nent.
Plus, the Bills beat the Giants
17-13 at the Meadowlands, hand
ing the NFC champions their only
home loss. They did it with Jim
Kelly playing less than half the
game before hurting his knee.
And Kelly wasn't nearly as effi
cient guiding the no-huddle attack
then as he is now.
The lack of a one-week break
also helps Buffalo. The Giants
don't have extra time to come up
with defensive schemes to shut
down Thurman Thomas, the
NFL's total offense leader; or
Andre Reed, the AFC's most dan
gerous receiver; or James Lofton,
the veteran receiver who always
has done well against the Giants.
New York's strength is its

linebacking and secondary. It will
be severely tested.
Coming out of the backfield,
Thomas could not be handled by
the Raiders' linebackers, sparking
the 51-3 rout in the AFC title
game. The Giants have Lawrence
Taylor and Pepper Johnson, who
have the mobility to guard
Thomas. But that will take away
from the pass rush, which is noth
ing special, anyway.
Buffalo's offensive line is play
ing at peak efficiency. If Taylor or
Johnson — or both — are in cov
erage, and Kelly recognizes that,
the Bills will find room to run. If
they rush him, Kelly will get the
ball to Thomas or tight end Keith
McKeller. Often.
The Giants don't figure to pile
up a lot of points, although they
can score if Buffalo doesn't pro
duce a better pass rush than it has
in the playoffs. The Bills need that
rush because the secondary is
decent, but vulnerable.
Buffalo has not been bothered
by mobile quarterbacks because it
has Bruce Smith, Darryl Talley
and Cornelius Bennett on the out
side. Keeping Jeff Hostetler in the
pocket but harried is a priority.
As it does every week, New
York will seek to run, run and run
some more early in the game. The
best way to get the Giants out of
that mode is to build a quick lead,
and no offense is better equipped
to do so than the Bills'.
An edge in special teams goes
to New York. That, however, was
true with the Raiders as well, and
Buffalo outplayed Los Angeles in
that area, too.
The Bills will win because —
and isn't this rare from the AFC?
— they simply are the better
team. Sure, the AFC is due, but
these Bills also would do the NFC
proud as a representative.
Prediction: Bills 27, Giants
17.
