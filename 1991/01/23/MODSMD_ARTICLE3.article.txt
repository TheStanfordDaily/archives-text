A Winnebago pulls up in front of a homeless shel
ter on Flagg Street in Hayward. The vehicle repre

of the underserved, the hundreds of homeless in
Alameda County.
Homeless men and women can walk up to the

van, receive vitamins or decon

and most importantly, get refer
rals for free care at a county
hospital.
Three years ago, the mobile
medical unit from Fairmont
Hospital of San Leandro began
making rounds to several shel

gets some funding from the county and makes up the
rest from federal grants, according to Unit Supervi

Mettelmann is scheduled to speak at a workshop
called "Strategies Linking Health Care to the Bay
Area Homeless" during this weekend's You Can

"Health and the Underserved."
The goal of the one-day conference is to examine
issues of public policy which are societal decisions,
not purely medical ones.

"We go through the shelter and see who needs
help," said Jeff Karon, a physician who works for the
unit. "We give them antibiotics for their infections
and medicine for their colds," he said.
He said he sometimes encounters more serious
cases, though. "We sometimes receive asthmatics,
HIV positives, people with high or low blood sugar
because they have no access to medications."
Karon said a lot of the medical problems the
homeless face are derived from their situation. "The
most common ailments are fungus, foot infections,
skin infections and head lice," he said. "There's also
a lot of colds and flu," which spread in the cramped
quarters of shelters, Karon said.
In addition, many of the homeless that are treated
