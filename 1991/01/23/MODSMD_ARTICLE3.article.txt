# Medical care on wheels provides aid for homeless
## 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
A Winnebago pulls up in front of a homeless shel
ter on Flagg Street in Hayward. The vehicle repre
sents all the primary health care for a large section
of the underserved, the hundreds of homeless in
Alameda County.
Homeless men and women can walk up to the

van, receive vitamins or decon
gestant for their frequent colds
and most importantly, get refer
rals for free care at a county
hospital.
Three years ago, the mobile
medical unit from Fairmont
Hospital of San Leandro began
making rounds to several shel
ters around the area. The unit

gets some funding from the county and makes up the
rest from federal grants, according to Unit Supervi
sor Ruth Mettelmann.
Mettelmann is scheduled to speak at a workshop
called "Strategies Linking Health Care to the Bay
Area Homeless" during this weekend's You Can
Make a Difference conference, which will focus on
"Health and the Underserved."
The goal of the one-day conference is to examine
issues of public policy which are societal decisions,
not purely medical ones.
The conference organizers, like those who work
with the homeless, said solutions lie not in treating
the individual ailments themselves, but in integrat
ing the underserved into society.
"We go through the shelter and see who needs
help," said Jeff Karon, a physician who works for the
unit. "We give them antibiotics for their infections
and medicine for their colds," he said.
He said he sometimes encounters more serious
cases, though. "We sometimes receive asthmatics,
HIV positives, people with high or low blood sugar
because they have no access to medications."
Karon said a lot of the medical problems the
homeless face are derived from their situation. "The
most common ailments are fungus, foot infections,
skin infections and head lice," he said. "There's also
a lot of colds and flu," which spread in the cramped
quarters of shelters, Karon said.
In addition, many of the homeless that are treated

are depressed, and Karon said
that a large percentage of them
are addicted to drugs or alcohol.
"I'd say about a third of the peo
ple I see have emotional prob
lems," he said.
Dr. Karon cannot treat the
addictions or the mental problems
from his van. Social workers ride
with the doctors and nurses to
help counsel the homeless with
these difficulties, as well as give
them advice on how to obtain ben
efits. Perhaps most important to
the health of the homeless, the
social workers give them referrals
which let them get free health
care at county hospitals.
The referrals are important
because single homeless people
are not covered by MediCal, which
gives state medical grants to the
needy, according to Carol Kenner,
a community health worker. She
said the only benefits single
homeless people receive is $340
per month in a government assis
tance grant, which is not enough
to treat serious illnesses.
The referrals are the only way
a lot of homeless can easily obtain

adequate hospital care, Kenner
said. In effect, the mobile unit,
through its referrals, acts as a
type of health insurance for the
homeless.
One homeless man, "Mark,"
said he has been a resident of the
Human Outreach shelter in Hay
ward for one-and-a-half weeks. He
recently broke his elbow and con
sequently lost his job. Eventually,
he was treated at Hyland County
Hospital through a referral.
While the van provides aid for
some problems, Kenner admits
that the van's doctors and social
workers can only take care of so
many homeless people. "We do the
best we can," she said. "Some peo
ple don't go to the shelters, or
there's not enough space avail
able."
Medical clerk and van driver
Sylvie Widger estimated that
about 20 percent of the patients
seen each month are repeat cus
tomers, and the number of people
treated "is not slowing down."
Despite Mark's physical recov
ery, he still suffers from other
problems.
"I'm going to wait until my
arm heals and get going again," he
said, "I don't have too many
plans." Mark wants to find
another job, but he said a history

of homelessness has a stigma
attached to it that many employ
ers dislike.
Mark, who was homeless
before, said some employers will
hire homeless people only to fire
them later when immediate jobs
are completed.
He said the worst part of home
lessness is the effect having to
receive aid has on self-esteem. "I
don't like to always be eating a
free meal, but you've got to hide
the pride in you and fight it,"he
said. "Most of us are not proud of
having to do this, but all people
want to do now is hire for
minimum wage."
Mark's lack of prospects is
apparently a widespread problem
among the homeless. Human
Outreach Executive Director
Salome Phillips said a portion of
society will remain permanently
homeless under the present sys
tem. "We have people in our soci

ety going from shelter to shelter,"
she said. "It's a hell of a safety
net."
Phillips said the answer lies in
innovative programs that take the
focus away from emergency shel
ters like Human Outreach and
toward fostering permanent
housing.
And permanent housing is a
definite possibility for Mark, who
has skills and is willing to work
hard. He said he is a trained
plumber and used to make good
money at it. Yet the stigma of
homelessness, together with a
slowing economy, continue to pre
vent him from reaching his poten
tial, he claims.
"You can't know what it's like
until you walk a mile in my moc
casins," he said. "You try getting a
voucher just to get into a shelter. .
.. Once, I had to wait a month
before I could get emergency food
stamps from welfare. How was I
supposed to eat until then?"
