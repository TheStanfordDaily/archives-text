# The 						Giants will pull off the super victory
## 
### Dave Goldberg AP sports writer 
TAMPA, FIa.(AP) — Joe Mon
tana staggered off the field. Stag
gered, not walked, which is the
way he has left the last two playoff
games the San Francisco 49ers
have played against the New York
Giants.
NFC football leaves quarter
backs in that state.
NFC football wins Super
Bowls, the last six to be exact.
OK, so Buffalo isn't Denver, to
the relief of the NFL, ABC and
everyone who watches Super
Bowls everywhere.
OK, so Buffalo averaged 47.5
points in its two playoff wins.
OK, so the Bills beat the Giants
17-13 at Giants Stadium on Dec.
15 and scored the first two times
they had the ball.
OK, so Jeff Hostetler will be at
quarterback for the Giants
instead of Phil Simms, who was
only 22 of 25 the last time New
York was in the Super Bowl.
However...
Jeff Hostetler has a career
record of 6-0 as a starter, some
thing neither Simms nor Jim
Kelly (nor even Frank Reich) can
claim. He has also shown the abil
ity to keep his cool in the waning
minutes of close games, which are
the only kind the Giants play.
That first game is deceptive.
It meant little to the Bills. It
meant less to the Giants, who
were in the midst of a run during
which they lost three of four —
the only three games they lost this
season.
Moreover, the Giants actually
outplayed the Bills but were done
in by penalties, misplays and ref
eree calls and non-calls. More
importantly, New York rushed for
157 yards in that game, although

105 came from Rodney Hampton,
whose broken left leg will keep
him out Sunday.
The combination of Ottis
Anderson, Dave Meggett and
Lewis Tillman, plus an offensive
line bolstered by the return of
Jumbo Elliott, should be able to
come close again. That means
Kelly and his perpetual motion
offense may not have the ball long
enough to run up anything close
to 47.5 points.
A couple of other things.
The Giants (or at least 22 of
them) have been to the Super
Bowl before.
The only guy on the Bills who
comes close is kicker Scott Nor
wood, who once played in a USFL
title game.
Now these guys aren't always
silent, particularly Bruce Smith,
who took it upon himself before
the last Giants game to proclaim
himself the best defensive player
ever. A couple of years ago, they
took the first Monday night game
they had had in several years and
acted like it was a Super Bowl.
Buffalo gets one break.
They only c H one week to
absorb the hype.
But it's not easy to spend half a
day to learn a game plan, practice
and talk to the media. That's
mandatory and the media sessions
are a mob scene very different
than the intimate gatherings dur
ing the regular season in Buffalo,
where the locker room is open
only for an hour on Wednesday.
The Giants have experience
with the Super Bowl media circus.
In fact, they endure something
like it on a weekly basis.
One more thing.
Jeff Hostetler is not Jay
Schroeder...
Prediction: Giants 24, Bills
21.
