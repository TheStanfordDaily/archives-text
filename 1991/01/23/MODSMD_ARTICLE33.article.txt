# Admissions office reports record number of international applicants

### Komail Thaver 
The Office of Undergraduate Admis
sions this year received the greatest num
ber ever of applications from interna
tional students, breaking last year's
record.
Although official figures for this year
have not yet been released, the total is sig
nificantly higher than last year's 1,182
international applications, according to
Jonathan Reider, associate director of
undergraduate admissions.
Ironically, this increase comes with a
drop in the number of domestic appli
cants. Domestic applications last year
were down by over 13 percent compared
to 1989 because of a decrease in the over
all number of high school seniors.
Stanford now boasts one of the largest
international communities in the aca
demic world — this year's freshman class
has 73 international students from 53 dif
ferent countries, according to the Admis
sions Office.
Many international students said they
come here for the cross-cultural experi
ence; others are attracted by Stanford's
diverse curriculum and strong science
and engineering programs.
Reviewing approximately 1,000 inter
national applications provides a special

challenge for the Office of Undergraduate
Admissions.
"Academic excellence is definitely the
primary criterion for admission," Reider
said. "Selection is indeed very rigorous —
only 10 percent of applicants are offered
admission."
Applications are first read by "area
specialists," who usually have a good
knowledge of a particular region's educa
tional system. Vincent Cuseo, associate
director of undergraduate admissions,
has been reading applications from India
for the last five years. Asst. Director Gre
gory Smith, who holds a doctorate in Rus
sian, is now handling East European
applications, which have increased dra
matically this year.
After the applications are examined by
area specialists, they are read by another
member of the admissions staff and then
passed on to the dean of Undergraduate
Admissions, who usually makes the final
decisions.
Differences between international and
U.S. schools mean that the Admissions
Office puts an increased emphasis on aca
demic performance and essays for inter
nrtional students who don't have access
to such a broad range of extracurricular
activities, Reider said.
Stanford therefore looks for people

who display an all-around intellectual
enthusiasm and have something uniquely
cultural to offer to the Stanford commu
nity, he said.
But the most difficult task for admis
sions officers is to assess academic perfor
mance in radically different school sys
tems. "For example, Russian and Argen
tinean schools have just 10 grades," Rei
der said. "Very often, a country might
have two totally different schooling sys
tems. .. . This makes reading applica
tions a very technical research job" he
said.
The Scholastic Aptitude Test is
required of all applicants, and the verbal
score is often used to judge an applicant's
English skills.
But this means that students from cer
tain parts of the world where the SAT is
not offered, like the Soviet Union or
China, are not considered for admission.
The Admissions Office also expects all
international students to be fluent in
English, and allowances are rarely made
for students with poor English skills.
Some American schools admit non-
English-speaking students who take
intensive English conversation and writ
ing courses in the United States before
enrolling.
Stanford's strict guidelines often bar

definitely the primary crite
rion for admission.'

the Admissions Office from exploiting
certain opportunities. For example, Chi
nese student leaders exiled after the Chi
nese government's 1989 crackdown in
Tiananmen Square were instantly offered
admission and scholarships by several
East Coast schools, including Wellesley,
Harvard, Brandeis and Boston Univer
sity. Reider said the Admissions Office
had not heard about these offers to Chi
nese students.
The limited amount of available fund
ing resulting from cutbacks in foreign
student financial aid is also a big concern
for Reider. He declined to specify the
exact amount of financial aid now avail
able for international students, but said
that it stood at "several hundred thou
sand dollars."
"This means that for every interna
tional student accepted and offered aid,
two or three equally qualified [interna

tional] students have to be rejected"
because of lack of funding, Reider
explained.
Offers of admissions to foreign stu
dents are not need-blind, according to a
booklet senfout to international students
who request an application from Stan
ford. But after admission, the needs of all
international students are met, the book
let says,
But despite its stringent standards and
requirements, Stanford does make an
effort to attract applicants from many dif
ferent parts of the world. For example,
the Admissions Office regularly sends
brochures and other information to vari
ous American embassies worldwide.
Reider praised the International Edu
cation Institute, a United Nations organi
zation which offers special scholarships
enabling underprivileged international
students to spend time at American pri
vate secondary schools before moving on
to American universities.
Recently, the Admissions Office has
also started using its international
alumni network to supply information
and answer questions for applicants. Rei
der mentioned Stanford's Singapore
Alumni Club, whose efforts in schools
nearly doubled the number of applicants
from Singapore.
