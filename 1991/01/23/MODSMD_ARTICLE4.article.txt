# Former British leader speaks on European Community's future
## 
### Albert Wat 
Former British Foreign Minis
ter Geoffrey Howe addressed a
crowd of about 150 people last
night in Kresge Auditorium on
Britain's role in the European
Community.
Howe served for 10 years in the
cabinet of former Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher. His resigna
tion last fall was seen as the final
blow to Thatcher's credibility, and
his departure triggered a series of
events that led to her fall as prime
minister last November.
Last night, Howe described the
organizational problems of the
European Community as
"formidable." The community,
Howe said, "is a unique organiza
tion. ... Its creation is a process
and not an event. ... It is
designed to bring about the ever
closer union of the European peo
ple."
The nations under the Euro
pean Community are not coerced
into being one entity, but are
bonded by joint policies, Howe
said.
He said with economic strength
and political coherence among

Howe said the
European Community
must have a stronger
presence in world
events.

European nations brought on by
the community, they will be capa
ble of defending themselves.
However, Howe said despite the
community's greater indepen
dence in the future, "the United
States should not be tempted to be
disengaged from Europe." At the
same time, he urged the European
Community to take a stronger
presence in world events.
During his presentation, Howe
enumerated seven steps that
would contribute to the strength
of the community in the future:
• The Unites States and
Europe must remain cohesive;
• The United States and
Britain must continue their mili
tary presence, including nuclear
facilities, to ensure the security of
Europe;
• The Conference on Security

and Cooperation in Europe must
"reassure the security of Eastern
European countries;"
• The European Community,
Howe said, must continue to pro
mote a single economy, civil lib
erty and human rights;
• A European monetary system
must promote "a free trade
world;"
• Britain will be "better able
and more willing ... to see to the
needs of Europe;" and
• Europe should continue to
contribute to world events. Howe
used the war with Iraq as an
example, saying that most Ameri
cans believe there is a dispropor
tionate number of U.S. troops in
the war.
Howe is at Stanford for the
inaugural meeting of the Interna
tional Advisory Council to the
University's Institute for Interna
tional Studies. Other dignitaries
who will attend the event include
former German Prime Minister
Helmut Schmidt, former Presi
dent Gerald Ford, Nobel Prize
winner and former Costa Rican
President Oscar Arias Sanchez
and former French President
Valery Giscard d'Estaing.
