# Committee recommends ways to improve the role of athletics
## 
### Peter Cousins Staff writer 
Stanford should make the Department
of Athletics a more integral part of the
University community, according to a
recent report studying the role of athlet
ics at Stanford.
The report, titled "The Future of Ath
letics at Stanford," was released last week
by the University Ad Hoc Committee on
Athletics at Stanford.
Among other things, it recommends
that a sport should not be funded unless
it can be provided with "the necessary
tools" required to achieve excellence,
such as personnel, scholarships and facil
ities. "Cuts must not be made that pre
vent individual sports from being compet

itive," the report said.
The committee also stressed that the
current policy of admitting only academi
cally qualified athletes must be contin
ued.
University President Donald Kennedy
appointed the committee last fall follow
ing the resignation of former Athletic
Director Ferdinand "Andy" Geiger. The
committee consisted of representatives
from many parts of the Stanford commu
nity, including alumni and stall from out
side the Athletics Department.
Vice President for Public Affairs
Robert Freelen chaired the committee,
which also included Acting Athletic Direc
tor Alan Cummings. The views of Stan
ford student-athletes were represented by
football player Cory Booker, tennis player

Sandra Birch and basketball player Sonja
Henning, all seniors.
The committee made numerous rec
ommendations intended to benefit both
the Athletics Department and the Univer
sity as a whole. In response to the prob
lem of declining sports revenue, the com
mittee said the University should
"increase its priority for [Athletics
Department] fund raising" in the post-
Centennial fund raising campaign.
However, the committee recognized
that program reduction might be neces
sary in some areas in order to save money.
Coaches and other staff should partici
pate in those decisions, the report states.
The committee lauded the overall
breadth of Stanford's athletics program.
Stanford supports 29 sports with some

degree of funding. Because Stanford com
petes in NCAA Division I, it is required to
support at least seven men's and
women's teams.
In addition to intercollegiate sports,
Stanford offers many other athletic activ
ities. The committee report noted the
wide variety of such programs, which
range from "arm wrestling to ultimate
frisbee, along with 35 other intramural
spurts, 24 club sports [and] 100 Physical
Education classes each quarter."
The new athletic director should be
committed to the many aspects of the ath
letics program and should be "as familiar
with activities at Roble Gym as at Maples
Pavilion," the committee wrote.
Freelen said that the search for a new

athletic director will start "right away."
He said a permanent director would be
required to put into effect the "more sub
stantive changes" that the committee
recommended.
Freelen reported that the committee
went to great lengths to gather input on
athletics at Stanford, meeting with
employees, organized groups, interested
non-employees and many others.
He said the committee worked very
well together in what can be a "very con
tentious area."
Booker, a senior, said the report was a
"good sampling of Athletics Department
views." It expressed all the viewpoints of
the various members of the committee
and was not at all biased, he added.
