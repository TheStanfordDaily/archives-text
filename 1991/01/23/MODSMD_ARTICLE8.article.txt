# Stanford Muslim students criticize U.S. intervention in the Gulf
## 
### Morgan Slain Staff writer 
Although the University's
largest group of Islamic students
does not yet have an official
response to the broadening war in
the Persian Gulf, individual Mus
lim students this week criticized
U.S. policy, arguing that the Gulf
war is unnecessary.
Several members of the Stan
ford Islamic Society will meet
with University President Donald
Kennedy by early next week,
according to Society President
Abdullahi Bature. The meeting
was prompted by an invitation
sent by Kennedy, Bature said.

He said he would issue no com
ments on behalf of the group until
after the meeting. Bature added
he was unsure how many stu
dents he would select to meet with
Kennedy. "We wouldn't want to
make President Kennedy uncom
fortable," he said. The society has
about 100 members.
Speaking only for himself,
Bature called the announcement
of American and allied air raids
against Iraq "shocking and terri
bly bad."
Other Muslim students spoke
more openly about their views on
the Gulf conflict. Hazim Ansari, a
junior majoring in Chemical Engi
neering, said many Islamic stu

dents were disheartened by the
war.
The Muslim community is
"united on the fact that we believe
[the Gulf war] should have been
solved as a regional conflict
between regional powers," Ansari
said. "Violence should have been
the last resort."
Ansari participated in a Gulf
War discussion in Roble Hall on
Friday night. Ansari said his pri
mary goal in presenting an
Islamic view was to detach the
religion of Islam from the politics
of the Middle East. "Do not talk
about Islam as a provocateur of
war," he said. "It is in many ways
a victim."

The dehumanization of the
enemy that often occurs in
wartime also concerns Ansari.
"U.S. people do not realize that an
Iraqi death is a human death â€”
not a military asset," he said.
Ansari said he knew of no orga
nized Islamic student reaction to
the conflict other than planned
participation in yesterday's and
today's teach-in.
Mohamad Ali, a junior from
Guyana, also said he was disap
pointed with U.S. policy. "I didn't
see the war as inevitable," he said.
"Alternative methods of solving
the problem could have been
probably negotiated."
But Ali said being Muslim has

no effect on his opinion about
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
"Saddam Hussein has no religious
basis for waging this war," he
said.
"I don't see this as a religious
issue, but as an economic issue
between the haves and the have
nots in the Arab world," Ali said,
"and [Saddam] is using this issue
to his advantage."
Ali added he was "personally
proud, very proud that Israel
refrained from retaliating" after
repeated missile attacks by the
Iraqis against Tel Aviv.
Mehran Sahami, a junior from
San Diego, also said he opposed
U.S. involvement in the Gulf.

Under the "pretense of trying to
liberate Kuwait," Sahami said,
the United States is trying to
"establish a foothold in the
region."
Sahami was born in Iran and
no longer practices the Islamic
religion. He said he finds deep
contradictions in U.S. foreign pol
icy, adding that the United States
uses buzzwords like "human
rights" to cloak an attempt to
expand U.S. power.
"In a time when we should be
remembering non-violence and
Martin Luther King Jr., we resort
to methods barbaric and archaic
to fight what President Bush calls
aggression," Ansari said.
