# Bombing raids devastating civilians

BONN, Germany (AP) â€” U.S. bombing
raids on Iraq have killed or wounded thou
sands of civilians and there are not enough
doctors, electricity or running water to care for
the injured, a European Parliament member
said yesterday.
Dieter Schinzel, a specialist on the Middle
East, said two Iraqis who fled to Jordan from
Baghdad had telephoned him with details of
the situation. He belongs to the opposition
Social Demcratic Party, which opposes the war.
Spokesmen for the German government
and the Defense Ministry said they had no
information on Schinzel's claims.
Neither the Iraqis nor the Americans have
spoken of such high casualties.
Schinzel accused both the United States
and Iraq of playing a "computer game" by dis
cussing only the number of sorties and jets
downed, and not speaking of human casual
ties.
He said in a telephone interview that the

United States' motive was to maintain support
for the war, and Iraq's was to keep morale
from plummeting.
The two Iraqis called him because relatives
knew him from his many trips to Iraq,
Schinzel said. They told him, he said, that the
damage to downtown Baghdad was not great
but outlying regions of the country had been
devastated and "several thousand" civilians
were dead or wounded.
That was as specific as his informants could
be about casualties, he said.
Later yesterday, Schinzel met with the Iraqi
ambassador to Bonn for an hour. He said after
ward he had no new information on casualties
and that there was no change in Iraq's posi
tion.
Schinzel said the men who telephoned him
lived in southern Iraq but traveled to Baghdad
on Sunday en route to Jordan.
"They told me that in the center of Bagh
dad there are some buildings destroyed ... but

in the regions, the areas, of Baghdad there are
many, many problems," he said. "Many build
ings, not only strategic buildings, are
destroyed. Also those where people are living."
This is because B-52 bombers "are not able
to aim only at a certain strategic point, so
they're bombing in the area," he said. "So
they have many, many deaths of civilians and
people who are iiyured."
"There's problems with the infrastruc
ture," Schinzel said. "They told me that they
think the infrastructure has also been
destroyed for helping the people."
"They can't get doctors to the areas. They
have problems with transport and they have
problems ... with obtaining the necessary med
ical equipment," Schinzel said from his office
in Aachen, near the Dutch border.
"They also have no water and no electric
ity," and telephones, when working, can only
make short-range calls, he said.
