THE NAVY HAS A 2-YEAR
SCHOLARSHIP TO INVEST
IN YOUR FUTURE
If you have everything it takes to go to college
except the cash, here's good news.
A Navy two-year NROTC scholarship can provide
over $30,000 for your college education. This program
pays for tuition, fees and books at over 60 colleges and
universities across the nation, and provides a tax-free
allowance of $ 100 a month for up to 20 months.
After graduation, you'll become an important part
of the Navy adventure as a commissioned officer. You
are then eligible for advanced training in todfay's most
important career fields: systems management,
accounting, nuclear engineering, aviation or other
specialities that can put your degree to work with new
kinds of challenges and rewards.
To see if you can qualify for an NROTC 2-year
scholarship, call your Navy representative.
