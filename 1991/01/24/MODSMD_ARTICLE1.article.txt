# WAR IN THE GULF
## Allied, Iraqi ground forces clash in desert

DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) - U.S.
armored cavalrymen skirmished with Iraqis in
the first flrefight along the border, where fleets
of tanks maneuvered and dug in on the desert
floor yesterday for the land war just over the
horizon.
The Americans captured six Iraqis and suf
fered two slight casualties, the U.S. command
said. It denied a Baghdad claim that the Iraqis
also seized prisoners.
For a second night running, Iraq fired off a
double-barreled volley of Scud missiles at
Saudi Arabia and Israel. No casualties were
reported immediately.
One Scud descended on northern Israel
about 10 p.m. and was intercepted by U.S.-sup
plied Patriot defense missiles, the Israeli mili
tary said. At the same time, five Scuds appar
ently were intercepted by Patriots over the
Saudi cities of Dhahran, Riyadh, and Hafr al
Batin, Saudi sources and witnesses reported.
If confirmed, it would be the first time the
Hafr al Batin area had been targeted. The
northern desert city is where Arab members of
the anti-Iraq coalition have military encamp
ments.
Each Scud launch against Israel pushes the
Jewish state closer to striking back at Iraq. At
U.S. urging, the Israeli leadership was holding
its fire yesterday, despite a Tuesday night Scud
attack that caused dozens of injuries, including
three fatal heart attacks.
Yesterday's first report of a ground action
came from the Iranian news media, which said
Iraq reported its forces had attacked enemy
troops in Saudi territory and captured allied
prisoners.
Later, apparently reporting on the same
flrefight, the U.S. command reported that 3rd
Armored Cavalry troopers were manning an
observation post near the Saudi-Iraqi border
late Tuesday when they came under small
arms fire from an Iraqi patrol and returned
fire.
A ground offensive is not expected until
February at the earliest.
The cloudy skies over Iraq began to clear
yesterday, and allied air commanders pressed
their mission-a-minute campaign in the sev
enth day of Operation Desert Storm, the U.S.-
led offensive to reverse Iraq's six-month-old
military occupation of Kuwait.
Bombing raids have demolished half of
Iraq's oil-refining capacity, allied commanders
said. Iraq announced it was suspending gaso
line sales.
Allied officers also say bombing runs have
