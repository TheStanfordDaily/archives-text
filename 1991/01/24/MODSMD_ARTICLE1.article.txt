# WAR IN THE GULF
## Allied, Iraqi ground forces clash in desert 
### 
DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) - U.S.
armored cavalrymen skirmished with Iraqis in
the first flrefight along the border, where fleets
of tanks maneuvered and dug in on the desert
floor yesterday for the land war just over the
horizon.
The Americans captured six Iraqis and suf
fered two slight casualties, the U.S. command
said. It denied a Baghdad claim that the Iraqis
also seized prisoners.
For a second night running, Iraq fired off a
double-barreled volley of Scud missiles at
Saudi Arabia and Israel. No casualties were
reported immediately.
One Scud descended on northern Israel
about 10 p.m. and was intercepted by U.S.-sup
plied Patriot defense missiles, the Israeli mili
tary said. At the same time, five Scuds appar
ently were intercepted by Patriots over the
Saudi cities of Dhahran, Riyadh, and Hafr al
Batin, Saudi sources and witnesses reported.
If confirmed, it would be the first time the
Hafr al Batin area had been targeted. The
northern desert city is where Arab members of
the anti-Iraq coalition have military encamp
ments.
Each Scud launch against Israel pushes the
Jewish state closer to striking back at Iraq. At
U.S. urging, the Israeli leadership was holding
its fire yesterday, despite a Tuesday night Scud
attack that caused dozens of injuries, including
three fatal heart attacks.
Yesterday's first report of a ground action
came from the Iranian news media, which said
Iraq reported its forces had attacked enemy
troops in Saudi territory and captured allied
prisoners.
Later, apparently reporting on the same
flrefight, the U.S. command reported that 3rd
Armored Cavalry troopers were manning an
observation post near the Saudi-Iraqi border
late Tuesday when they came under small
arms fire from an Iraqi patrol and returned
fire.
A ground offensive is not expected until
February at the earliest.
The cloudy skies over Iraq began to clear
yesterday, and allied air commanders pressed
their mission-a-minute campaign in the sev
enth day of Operation Desert Storm, the U.S.-
led offensive to reverse Iraq's six-month-old
military occupation of Kuwait.
Bombing raids have demolished half of
Iraq's oil-refining capacity, allied commanders
said. Iraq announced it was suspending gaso
line sales.
Allied officers also say bombing runs have

wrecked much of Iraq's chemi
cal-weapons and nuclear instal
lations. Many analysts believed
Iraq to be near achieving the
ability to produce nuclear
weapons.
In a televised address in
Washington, President Bush
said the air war had put Iraq
"out of the nuclear bomb
building business for a long
time to come." He was both
upbeat and cautious in his
overall assessment of the war's
progress, saying Iraq could still
pull some surprises.
In Baghdad, more and more
people were emerging from
their shelters, CNN's Peter
Arnett reported from the Iraqi
capital. Commerce seemed to
be resuming, Baghdadis were
shopping at the central mar
ket, and water trucks were
making their rounds, said
Arnett, one of the few foreign
journalists in Baghdad.
The shops still offered dry
food, canned goods, soft drinks
and bottled water, Canadian
Press correspondent Leila
Deeb said in a Tuesday dis
patch reaching Jordan yester
day. She also said the air raids
remained intensive Tuesday.
Arnett said Iraqi authorities
were reviewing Western news
reports but had censored little.
Beyond northern Saudi Ara
bia's remote desert frontier,
more than a half-million Iraqi
troops are in position in
Kuwait and southern Iraq, fac
ing a growing army of hun
dreds of thousands of Ameri

can, Saudi, British and other
allied tankers and infantry
men.
The allies have almost 3,000
tanks at or converging on the
front lines, facing off against
some 4,200 Iraqi tanks in
Kuwait and southern Iraq.
The allied army is deployed
along the 130-mile Saudi-
Kuwaiti border and farther
west, along the Iraqi-Saudi
border, where tanks of the
desert-trained 3rd Armored
Cavalry Regiment — from Fort
Bliss, Texas — are believed to
be conducting reconnaissance
and guarding the allied force's
western flank.
American armored units
continued maneuvering into
place along the frontier yester
day after days of rain and driz
zle that turned desert-dry
areas into small lakes and cre
ated sinkholes — "sabkhas" —
that can bog down a tank.
Commanders have begun to
slow the pace of combat exer
cises at the front lines so sol
diers can be rested and equip
ment put in good shape for
what could be a long ground
battle.
American tank officers, like
Marine Capt. Rob Philon,
know the ground offensive
won't be a rollover. Philon's M
-60 tanks will have to go up
against Iraq's Soviet-made T
-725, whose laser-equipped guns
have a longer range than his.
"We'll have to outmaneuver
them and not let them get the
drop on us," Philon said.
For now the allied troops are
content to let U.S. and allied
airpower "soften up" Iraqi
positions.
