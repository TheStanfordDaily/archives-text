# Addicted vets find shelter

"I don't know how this war's gonna turn out,"
said a Vietnam veteran, "but I hope this country
and the VA system can support the vets that'll
come out of this."
He spoke while sitting in a group of 40 veterans
in the lounge of their Veterans Affairs-run resi
dence the day after the U.S. began bombing raids
over Iraq.
Half of the veterans were in Vietnam. About 90
percent of them are addicted to drugs or alcohol.
All of them have sought help to turn their lives
around after having been homeless.
Randy, another veteran, said, "I know we have
a war going on outside, but we're fighting one
here as well, and I know in 60 days I'm gonna
make it." In 60 days, Randy will leave an innova
tive rehabilitation program for homeless veter
ans, located in Menlo Park, and live on his own.
In opeiation for three years, the Homeless Vet
erans' Rehabilitation Program is run through the
federally-funded Department of Veterans Affairs.
Christine Kondo, one of the directors of the
rehabilitation program, will speak during a work
shop at Saturday's You Can Make a Difference
Conference. The workshop is called, "Strategies
Linking the Bay Area Homeless to Health Care."
The one-day conference will focus on "Health
and the Underserved" and will involve work
shops, larger lectures and debates on such topics
as access to health care for people of color and the
homeless.
The rehabilitation program is one of 20 such
centers in the country. But the one in Menlo Park
has been touted as a model program on which the
others are based. Program directors said it is
more than a 30-day emergency shelter.
Research and training coordinator Andrea Sei
dner, a clinical psychologist, said most of the 54
residents stay for six to eight months before suc

cessfully completing the program.
The focus of the program is to train the veter
ans to develop coping strategies which will help
them avoid becoming homeless again. The resi
dents call these skills their "tools." The problem
with most of the veterans who come into the pro
gram is that they often can't solve their problems
in a constructive way, Seidner said.
These "tools" are designed to let them assert
themselves constructively, recognize when they
are thinking irrationally and resolve conflicts on
their own, Seidner explained..
"Some of them come in here saying, 'All I need
is a job,' and we ask them, 'Is that all you really
need?'" she said. "Many of them have had jobs but
can't keep them because of their poor problem
solving skills," a problem which may lead them to
drug abuse, she added.
Dennis is a Vietnam veteran who used drug√ü
during the war. Taking drugs was his way of cop
ing during the war, he said, and it carried over
when he returned home.
Seidner said about 30 percent of the residents
have been in combat and about 10 to 15 percent of
the veterans have mild to moderate cases of Post
Traumatic Stress Disorder, a delayed form of shell
shock which makes it difficult to adjust to society.
She said the program screens its residents to
see if they have a chance for successfully changing
their attitudes. "We'll take any vet who was hon
orably discharged and [is] willing to work on [his]
problem," she said.
Since the residence has only 54 beds, there is
typically a waiting list of about three weeks for
qualified applicants, Seidner said. The program
runs a referral service for those who do not qual
ify, she added.
The program's success rate is high compared to
other forms of rehabilitation, Seidner said. She
cited one study showing that 65 percent of the
