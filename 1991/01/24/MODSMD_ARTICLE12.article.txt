# Campbell shocks audience
## Says he wouldn't rule out using nuclear weapons 
### Miranda Doyle Staff writer 
Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Stan
ford, shocked the audience at his
most recent town meeting in Palo
Alto by saying he would not rule
out the use of tactical nuclear
weapons in the Middle East "if it
came down to saving lives of
Americans."
While Campbell said at the
meeting Sunday that it is
extremely unlikely he would ever
support the use of nuclear
weapons in the war against Iraq,
he might do so in order to spare
Americans.
In clarifying his remarks,
Campbell aides said he made the

statement only after saying it is
unlikely that tactical nuclear
weapons would be used and
extremely unlikely that he would
approve of their use, according to
a statement from Campbell's
Washington office.
The statement also said that
Campbell told the audience that
the use of nuclear weapons lowers
the threshold for their use again.
David Bernstein, assistant to
the directors at the Center for
International Security and Arms
Control at Stanford, called the
remark "ill-advised."
"I think it was both an irre
sponsible and vcrry unfortunate
statement," he said.
Bernstein said the use of tacti

cal nuclear weapons would "cross
the line of morality." He added he
believes the weapons would give
the allies no advantage because
thev already have complete con
trol of the air over Iraq.
"Nothing would turn the Arabs
against us faster," Bernstein said.
"It would do irreparable harm to
our reputation in the world." He
noted the dangers of nuclear
weapons, including the harmful
side effects of radiation.
Campbell had previously
angered local peace activists by
voting Jan. 12 in favor of a resolu
tion authorizing the use of force
against Iraq if it did not withdraw
from Kuwait by the Jan. 15 dead
line.
