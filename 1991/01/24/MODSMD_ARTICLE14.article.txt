# Bush: No pause in war against Iraq
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi
dent Bush said last night the war
against Saddam Hussein was
"right on schedule," undercutting
Iraq's ability to fight back. "There
can be no pause now that Saddam
has forcea the world into war,"
Bush said.
Bush delivered an upbeat
assessment of the first week of

war but echoed military planners
who cautioned against overconfi
dence. Bush warned there will be
"setbacks and sacrifices."
The instructions to war plan
ners, Bush said, are to "get it done
quickly and with as little loss of
life as possible."
Military leaders said allied
bombing had destroyed Iraq's two

nuclear research reactors and
seriously damaged factories
believed to produce chemical and
biological weapons.
Saddam "doesn't know how
badly he's been hit," Defense Sec
retary Dick Cheney said, pointing
to disruption of Iraq's communi
cation systems.
The Pentagon warned, how

ever, that Iraq's military machine
remains strong despite intense
allied attacks. "We're dealing with
an enemy that is resourceful, an
enemy that knows how to work
around problems, an enemy that
is ingenious," said Gen. Colin
Powell, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff.
Cheney said Saddam "cannot
change the basic course" of the
war. "He will be defeated."
Bush told an audience of
retired military officers that the
allied superiority in the skies
would "systematically deprive
Saddam of his ability to wage war
effectively."
"I am pleased to report that
Operation Desert Storm is right
on schedule," he said.
"There can be no doubt: Oper
ation Desert Storm is working.
There can be no pause now that
Saddam has forced the world into
war. We will stay the course — and
we will succeed all the way," he
said.
Bush added: "No one should
weep for this tyrant when he is
brought to justice. No one, any
where in the world."
Bush reminded Americans that
war carries a price.
"There will be problems. There
will be setbacks and sacrifices.
But let me say I have every reason
to be very pleased with our
progress to date."
He said Saddam "has sickened
the world" by firing Scud missiles
at civilian targets both in Israel
and Saudi Arabia.
"These weapons are nothing
more than tools of terror, and they
do nothing but strengthen our
resolve to act against a dictator
unmoved by human decency."
