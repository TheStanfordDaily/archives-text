Woman wins $1 million AIDS claim
WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) - A woman believed to be
one of the first patients to be infected with AIDS by a health-care
worker has won a $1 million settlement against her dentist's
insurer.
The settlement by CNA Insurance Co. Tuesday followed a
report by the federal Centers for Disease Control last week that
confirmed Kimberly Bergalis as well as two other patients proba
bly contracted the AIDS virus while being treated by Dr. David
Acer of Stuart.
The CDC said genetic tests show Bergalis, 23, probably was
infected by Acer while he removed her wisdom teeth in December
1987, either through blood-to-blood contact or because dental
tools were contaminated.
The Fort Pierce woman's attorney, Bob Montgomery, alleged
that CNA should have known Acer had AIDS and barred him
from doing surgery before issuing him the $1 million dental mal
practice insurance policy.
Acer was a bisexual who treated an estimated 1,700 patients
after contracting the virus and came down with full-blown AIDS
months before operating on Bergalis, Montgomery said.
He never told his patients he had the disease, and died in
September of AIDS-related cancer. Days later, Bergalis decided to
make her case public to prevent others from sharing her fate.
Montgomery said the $1 million settlement was a small price
to pay compared with the cost of Acer's carelessness. Bergalis said
when they filed the suit last October that she wasn't seeking the
money for herself.
"It's not going to buy me a cure," Bergalis said.
Utah Senate approves anti-abortion bill
SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — The Utah Senate yesterday passed
a tough anti-abortion bill that the governor promises to sign
despite a legal battle promised by abortion rights advocates.
The Senate voted 23-5 in favor of the bill, which would outlaw
most abortions in Utah. Th 6 legislation goes to the House Health
Committee today and the full House probably by Friday.
The bill was expected to win House passage. Seventy percent of
Utah residents and 90 percent of the 104 state lawmakers belong
to the Mormon Church, which considers abortion a grievous sin
except in the most dire medical circumstances.
Gov. Norm Bangerter confirmed in a letter to Republican
sponsor Leßay McAllister, who was absent for yesterday's vote,
that he will sign the bill immediately.
Susanne Millsaps, executive director of the National Abortion
Rights Action League's Utah chapter, said the bill's quick passage
was "distressing but not surprising." Kate Michelman, the
league's director, said in a statement from Washington the bill
"that moved with lightning speed through the Utah Senate today
sends an ominous signal to all American women that their right
to choose is in danger."
The league and other pro-choice groups plan a rally Saturday
at the Capitol.
