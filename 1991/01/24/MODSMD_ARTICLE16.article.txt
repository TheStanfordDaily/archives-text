# Fed may lower rates

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Fed
eral Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan, confronted by angry
senators and new evidence on the
severity of the recession, said yes
terday the central bank was con
sidering a further reduction in
interest rates, among other
options, to combat the downturn.
Greenspan's acknowledgement
of possible new rate reductions
came as the central bank released
a natiowide survey showing the
country beset by job layoffs and
widespread weakness in manufac
turing, housing and retail sales.
The survey, based on informa
tion supplied by the Fed's 12
regional banks, found that the
energy sector was the only bright
spot in an otherwise lackluster
economy as the year began.
Greenspan underwent some

sharp questioning from Senate
Banking Committee members
who wanted to know why the Fed
had not been more aggressive in
lowering interest rates to ward off
the recession.
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.,
charged that the Fed's recent
credit easing moves were "too lit
tle, too late" and said the central
bank was still overly concerned
about inflation.
"People are going to starve out
there and you are going to be wor
ried about inflation," D'Amato
told Greenspan.
In addition to possible further
moves to reduce interest rates,
Greenspan said the Fed was look
ing at "possible other strategies"
to promote increased bank lend
ing.
