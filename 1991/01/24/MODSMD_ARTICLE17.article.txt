# China tries leader of democracy protest
## 
### 
BEIJING (AP) — A Chinese people's court
yesterday put on trial Wang Dan, the most
wanted student leader of the 1989 pro-democ
racy movement that was crushed by Commu
nist authorities.
Wang is at least the 25th activist to be tried
or sentenced this month as the government
seeks to wrap up such cases while the world is
preoccupied with war in the Persian Gulf.
Wang, 23, has been jailed 19 months.
His name topped a police list of the 21 most
wanted student leaders after the democracy
movement was put down in an army assault
across Beijing on June 4, 1989. Hundreds of
people were killed.
Wang was arrested the next month while
meeting with a Taiwanese reporter to ask for
help in fleeing China.
A small notice announcing Wang's trial was
posted outside the Beying Intermediate Peo
ple's Court. It said he was charged with
"counter-revolutionary propaganda and
incitement," the charge most freqently used

against political prisoners.
Court officials refused to say if Wang's fam
ily was allowed to attend the trial, which was
closed to the public. Six Hong Kong university
students who arrived Monday in Beijing in
hopes of observing political trials visited a
court office but were turned away.
The trial recessed later yesterday without
any verdict being announced.
Wang, a history student at Beijing Univer
sity, had organized campus discussions on
political reform even before the democracy
movement began. Inspired by Soviet glasnost,
he wrote an article advocating China take the
same path.
In April 1989, when college students put up
posters to mourn the death of former Commu
nist Party leader Hu Yaobang, Wang was
among the first to urge they channel their
grief into efforts to change the system. He was
one of a small circle of student leaders who
began organizing marches to Tiananmen
Square in Beijing.

Short and slight, with a shock of hair that
fell over his glasses, Wang was often seen with
a megaphone at the front of rallies.
As the protesters' numbers swelled into the
hundreds of thousands, including many from
off campus, quarrels developed over leader
ship. Wang returned to campus, and he was
not at Tiananmen Square the night the army
moved in.
Thousands of people were arrested after the
army attack. Most are believed to have been
sent to labor camps, sentenced to prison or
released. However, the government delayed
putting the leaders on trial as it pondered how
to handle the sensitive cases and avoid inter
national criticism.
Chinese sources say the government has
drawn up a list of 20 protest leaders, including
students and older intellectuals, whose trials
are being carefully orchestrated. Top judges
and prosecutors were selected to handle these
trials, and their statements are pre-scripted.
