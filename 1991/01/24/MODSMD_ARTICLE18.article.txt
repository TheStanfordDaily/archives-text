# Gorbachev deems large ruble notes worthless
## Kremlin attempts to slash inflation by reducing one-third of monetary supply 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) — Soviets have
grumbled for years that shortages
and inflation have made their
rubles nearly worthless.
Their complaints became real
ity late Tuesday when President
Mikhail Gorbachev announced he
was pulling out of circulation the
green 50-ruble and tan 100-ruble
notes — the mainstay of the
underground economy.
By dawn yesterday, long lines
had formed at banks in Moscow,
Leningrad and other cities with
Soviets anxious to cash in their
high-denomination ruble notes so
that they are not left with worth
less pieces of paper.
"My friend called last night,
and her 90-year-old mother was in
tears," said a woman who stopped
by a bank near the Kiev railroad
station.
"She saved 2,000 rubles
($3,224) — you know how grand
mothers save — in an envelope for
her own funeral," said the
woman.
Under government decree, any
large-denomination bills not
turned in by Saturday are worth
less. Anybody who tries to turn in
more than his monthly salary is to
be questioned about where the
money came from.
For millions of Soviets, it will
be impossible to produce written
records of legal transactions in
new small businesses, or the
source of a lifetime's savings.
Prime Minister Valentin Pavlov
has said as much as one-third of
the cash is in the form of big bills.
The government's move appar
ently was intended slash inflation
by cutting the excess supply of
rubles.
Professional black marketeers
long ago switched from dealing in
rubles to convertible currencies,
such as dollars, and are unlikely
to be affected by the change.
But people temporarily holding
large amounts of cash earned
from selling or buying cars, video

recorders and other such con
sumer items faced financial disas
ter.
Meanwhile, the government
restricted withdrawals from bank
accounts to 500 rubles ($806)
monthly. That is almost twice the
average monthly salary of 267
rubles ($430), but only slightly
more than it costs to buy a pair of
fashionable sneakers at inflated
prices in the unofficial economy.
The government said it would
replace the bills with new ones
later. But much about the pro
gram was unclear, and appeared
unlikely to be cleared up before
the deadline to turn in the old
money.
"Some may challenge the social
justice of the president's decree,
but they cannot say that the
Soviet leadership remains idle
while the country stands on the
brink of total economic collapse,"
said Tass news agency analyst
Andrei Orlov.
Ivan Silayev, prime minister of
Boris Yeltsin's Russian republic,
said parliament there would dis
cuss the reform today. But despite
Yeltsin's disagreements with Gor
bachev on economic issues, Rus
sia's position "will not be an
explosive stand," said Silayev.
Galina Mors, an elderly woman
who came to a downtown bank in
hopes of changing in her large
bills, complained that bank
employees were unprepared and
didn't know what to do.
"There are only older people
here," she said as she waited in
midafternoon. "They've been
here since morning, and they
haven't been able to find out any
thing."
Bank employees were quoted
by Tass as saying they were
caught completely unaware by the
government move.
Some economists noted the
inflation-fighting plan could
undermine the Soviet's fledgling
private enterprise system.
