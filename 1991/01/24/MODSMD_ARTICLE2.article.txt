# Fall quarter to start week early
## 
### Steve Barrera 
Because of University budget
cuts, classes next fall will begin
one week earlier than planned, on
Sept. 25, before the Finale Week
end of the yearlong Centennial
Celebration.
The Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement had
scheduled classes to start Oct. 2,
coinciding with the University's
first day of instruction 100 years
ago. In addition, the committee
had proposed the later starting
date to allow arriving students,
staff and faculty to participate in

Stanford's Centennial Celebra
tion without disrupting class
schedules.
Instead, classes will be sus
pended Monday, Sept. 30 and
Tuesday, Oct. 1 to allow students,
faculty and staff to take part in
the Centennial Finale events
scheduled for that weekend.
The original plan had to be
scrapped because of the Univer
sity's budget reduction, according
to Acting Registrar Jack Farrell.
Since students would have
returned before the start of
classes, the University intended to
pick up room and board costs.

Stanford would have ended up
subsidizing an additional
$200,000 in room and board costs,
Farrell said. In addition, he said
the University could not charge
for room and board to make up
the difference because that would
have required the University to
give additional financial aid.
Farrell said Stanford had hoped
to absorb these costs, but noted
that "the financial environment
has changed considerably since
then."
Although the committee had
wanted to avoid starting and stop
ping classes, Farrell said he did
not think the interruption would
affect students greatly. Even with
the long weekend, Farrell noted,
there still will be more instruc
tional days in fall quarter than in
either winter or spring quarters.
Farrell said, "This only hap
pens once in a hundred years. It's
a very historic time for Stanford."
He added that he thought the
Centennial Finale will be "very
good for the whole community."
Steven Peeps, executive direc

tor of the Centennial Celebration,
said that among the events
planned for Sept. 30 and Oct. 1
are large-scale convocations for
faculty, staff and alumni, panels
and colloquia to be headed by yet
unspecified "world leaders" and
an opportunity for alumni to
"return to the classroom" for
afternoon lectures.
Peeps said the Centennial
Finale will be partially modeled on
similar celebrations at other uni
versities. "Since we are a rela
tively young university, we had to
study the efforts of other universi
ties in making our plans."
However, recent anniversary
celebrations at the University of

'This only happens
once in a hundred
years.'

Pennsylvania and at Harvard Uni
versity were held before or after
the school year, when students
were largely absent, Peeps noted.
"Ours is rather unique, involving
students, faculty and staff more,"
he said.
He added he hopes the Centen
nial Finale will be an intergenera
tional event that allows alumni,
students and faculty to get
together and see how the Univer
sity has changed in recent years.
