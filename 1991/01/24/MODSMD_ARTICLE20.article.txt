## Soviet struggles 
### 
United States must
decide whether, or how,
to react to Baltic unrest

SO YOU WANT TO BE THE
president. You have the
answers to the mess in the
Middle East. You even have a plan
for the United States' economic
revival. Now try the Soviet Union.
As if war and recession weren't
enough, Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev has given President
Bush one more thing to worry
about â€” the future of Gorbachev's
country.
The news out of the Soviet
Union announces more than the
killing of at least 14 Lithuanians
by the Soviet army. The news is
that "Gorbachev" is no longer a
nine-letter word for God.
For the better part of five years,
the world outside the Soviet Union
has applauded Gorbachev's efforts
at reshaping and restructuring the
Soviet Union. Now it is time to rec
ognize the ramifications of Gor
bachev's reforms.
One wonders if Gorbachev knew
what he was getting into. Granted
the opportunity, European coun
tries shed the coverage of the Iron
Curtain at the rate of almost one
per month. Then the fever spread,
and Lithuania, one of the semi
autonomous Baltic states, declared
its independence from the Soviet
Union. Echoes of that declaration
were heard in Latvia and Estonia,
and then even in Great Russia
itself.
Today, the Soviet Union is still
in a state of economic disaster,
Gorbachev's perestroika notwith
standing. Glasnost is vanishing,
the press once again censored.
Nobel laureate Gorbachev has gar
nered dictatorial license, and the

Soviet military, apparently still fol
lowing his orders, is "pacifying"
unrest in the Baltics.
Now, Gorbachev is struggling
desperately to stev alive, figura
tively and perhaps literally, in the
face of opposition from radicals
and reactionaries alike.
The United States is thus faced
with the dilemma of deciding how
to deal with Gorbachev. He has
increasingly become an ally;
indeed, without his support, the
current coalition opposing Iraq
probably would never have formed.
Yet he is allowing, if not directing,
the Soviet army to kill those seek
ing independence in the Baltics.
Ultimately, there is one question
which begs an answer so that the
United States can develop a plan:
Is a breakup of the Soviet Union
inevitable and imminent?
If so, it behooves the United
States to position itself to befriend
the leaders who would emerge as
heads of state in the various
republics that would result.
If not, then the United States
should be able to squeeze Moscow
into favorable arrangements in
return for economic assistance.
Indeed, breakup or no, the
resulting nation or nations will
need American support.
Significantly, the United States
is not in a position to, nor should it
attempt to, influence the longevity
of the Soviet Union.
One current option facing the
United States is launching a fact
finding mission to ascertain as
quickly as possible the likelihood of
the Soviet Union crumbling.
Gorbachev has become a cult fig
ure, ironically far more popular
abroad than at home. But the goal
of American policy can no longer
simply be to keep him in power.
Regional stability and strong rela
tions with the power brokers of the
future, not just Gorbachev, must
become our top priorities.
