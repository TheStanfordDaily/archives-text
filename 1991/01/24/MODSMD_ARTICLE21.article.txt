By setting Jan. 15 deadline, Bush insulted King's legacy

AS BLACK STUDENTS, WE con
sider it a slap in the face that the
deadline set by President Bush and
the United Nations Security Council
sanctioning the beginning of offensive
actions against Iraq was the birthdate of
civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.
As we celebrate the birth of a leader
who dedicated his life to ideas of peaceful
resistance and diplomacy, we feel a sting
of humiliation as Bush commands our
troops to serve by killing not just Iraqi
soldiers, but innocent civilians and fami
lies, in a plea that links sovereignty for
the nation of Kuwait to U.S. economic
gain.
The United States has moved quickly
to protect Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and
Israel from ruler Saddam Hussein. Pres
ident Bush has been to the media count
less times, trying to convince the Ameri
can people that the military crisis in the
Persian Gulf is an unambiguous struggle
of right and wrong.
He has stated that first and foremost it
is a struggle for democracy, for the people
of Kuwait to regain their homeland, but
also in trying to create stronger reasons
for the deployment of almost 400,000
troops he has appealed to the American
pocket, adding to his argument the issue
of Middle East petroleum.
As black students, we are unable to
swallow these statements as clear justifi
cations for the endangerment of U.S. mil
itary soldiers and their families.
Bush's actions in the Persian Gulf

have again demonstrated American
hypocrisy. He advocates a strong military
stance against Iraq, a stance that will
result in many allied soldiers and Iraqi
and Kuwaiti civilians being killed. Is the
United States willing to set this precedent
and use military forces to fight the demo
cratic struggles against all acts defined as
"undemocratic"?
If Bush is willing to send U.S. troops
8,000 miles from home to defend the peo
ple of Kuwait who are being beaten,
robbed and tortured by Hussein, then
U.S. troops should also be fighting for the
people of South Africa, who are dying
every day in the struggle against
apartheid. They should be battling for the
people of Lithuania, who are the subject
of the Soviet Union's military hold, and
the people Uf Palestine, who have been
struggling for hundreds of years for
sovereignty.
Bush has chosen to forget King's
legacy, but we cannot. The struggle for
human rights on U.S. soil is far from over.
Bush supports a quick, forceful, unyield
ing attack against "unjust" Iraq, yet the
injustices that must be addressed in this
nation are continuously ignored and left
to the slow wheels of bureaucracy.
Bush comments in reference to the
beginning of the war that "these are the
times that try men's souls." People of
color, people of low-income communities,
women, the homeless, the starving, the
sick and dying in this country have been
trapped in times that could crush the

soul, yet their problems go unresolved.
Just six months ago, Bush vetoed the
Civil Rights Bill of 1990, a bill that would
have brought a little bit of justice to the
lives of minorities and women living not
8,000 miles away on Middle Eastern sand,
but right here at home on American soil.
Legislation to establish better housing
and health care policies for the thousands
that sleep on our city streets continues to
be pushed to the side by Congress.
Every day, the population of the home
less in America increases. Every day, a
child dies of small pox because there was
no affordable health care. If we believe
that America is a nation "by the people,
for the people," the federal government
has committed a great injustice to the
American citizens.
The alternative to hunger, poverty illit
eracy for many is the military, and many
of the soldiers that are fighting in the
Gulf accepted the alternative. Attracted
by the propaganda of "Be all you can be,"
and the benefits of college funding, many
people recognize the military as a way to
attend schools that they could not nor
mally afford and, in extreme cases, a
chance to escape a life of gang violence,
poverty, drugs and many other day-to-day
struggles that plague many minority
communities.
We are disgusted that there are dispro
portionate numbers of people of low
income and minorities being sent to the
front lines of Operation Desert Storm.
The combat-ready forces of the front lines

who await the next phase of the war are
overwhelmingly minorities.
King lived and died for human rights
and equality, and Bush claims the same
conviction in the war against Iraq. If
Bush is truly dedicated to "democracy,"
he will remember the lives that many of
the soldiers on the front lines give.
The federal government has commit
ted time and money to the offensive
attack against Saddam Hussein, an
attack that is not limited to a set of inan
imate airplanes and missiles, but an
attack that has already taken human
lives.
As our loved ones are ordered to com
bat, we are frustrated by the inconsis
tency and hypocrisy that the United
States is advocating. In this week of
remembrance and celebration of King, we
are angered by the clear disregard and
steamrolling tactics that the United
States has played in the Persian Gulf. We
are hesitant to accept the justifications
that the federal government is us.
Now we are left to do all we can from
this end of the world to make sure that
the federal government hears our cry for
peaceful resolution. We pray for the safe
return of our family and friends.

By setting Jan. 15 deadline, Bush insulted King's legacy

AS BLACK STUDENTS, WE con
sider it a slap in the face that the
deadline set by President Bush and
the United Nations Security Council
sanctioning the beginning of offensive
actions against Iraq was the birthdate of
civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.
As we celebrate the birth of a leader
who dedicated his life to ideas of peaceful
resistance and diplomacy, we feel a sting
of humiliation as Bush commands our
troops to serve by killing not just Iraqi
soldiers, but innocent civilians and fami
lies, in a plea that links sovereignty for
the nation of Kuwait to U.S. economic
gain.
The United States has moved quickly
to protect Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and
Israel from ruler Saddam Hussein. Pres
ident Bush has been to the media count
less times, trying to convince the Ameri
can people that the military crisis in the
Persian Gulf is an unambiguous struggle
of right and wrong.
He has stated that first and foremost it
is a struggle for democracy, for the people
of Kuwait to regain their homeland, but
also in trying to create stronger reasons
for the deployment of almost 400,000
troops he has appealed to the American
pocket, adding to his argument the issue
of Middle East petroleum.
As black students, we are unable to
swallow these statements as clear justifi
cations for the endangerment of U.S. mil
itary soldiers and their families.
Bush's actions in the Persian Gulf

have again demonstrated American
hypocrisy. He advocates a strong military
stance against Iraq, a stance that will
result in many allied soldiers and Iraqi
and Kuwaiti civilians being killed. Is the
United States willing to set this precedent
and use military forces to fight the demo
cratic struggles against all acts defined as
"undemocratic"?
If Bush is willing to send U.S. troops
8,000 miles from home to defend the peo
ple of Kuwait who are being beaten,
robbed and tortured by Hussein, then
U.S. troops should also be fighting for the
people of South Africa, who are dying
every day in the struggle against
apartheid. They should be battling for the
people of Lithuania, who are the subject
of the Soviet Union's military hold, and
the people Uf Palestine, who have been
struggling for hundreds of years for
sovereignty.
Bush has chosen to forget King's
legacy, but we cannot. The struggle for
human rights on U.S. soil is far from over.
Bush supports a quick, forceful, unyield
ing attack against "unjust" Iraq, yet the
injustices that must be addressed in this
nation are continuously ignored and left
to the slow wheels of bureaucracy.
Bush comments in reference to the
beginning of the war that "these are the
times that try men's souls." People of
color, people of low-income communities,
women, the homeless, the starving, the
sick and dying in this country have been
trapped in times that could crush the

soul, yet their problems go unresolved.
Just six months ago, Bush vetoed the
Civil Rights Bill of 1990, a bill that would
have brought a little bit of justice to the
lives of minorities and women living not
8,000 miles away on Middle Eastern sand,
but right here at home on American soil.
Legislation to establish better housing
and health care policies for the thousands
that sleep on our city streets continues to
be pushed to the side by Congress.
Every day, the population of the home
less in America increases. Every day, a
child dies of small pox because there was
no affordable health care. If we believe
that America is a nation "by the people,
for the people," the federal government
has committed a great injustice to the
American citizens.
The alternative to hunger, poverty illit
eracy for many is the military, and many
of the soldiers that are fighting in the
Gulf accepted the alternative. Attracted
by the propaganda of "Be all you can be,"
and the benefits of college funding, many
people recognize the military as a way to
attend schools that they could not nor
mally afford and, in extreme cases, a
chance to escape a life of gang violence,
poverty, drugs and many other day-to-day
struggles that plague many minority
communities.
We are disgusted that there are dispro
portionate numbers of people of low
income and minorities being sent to the
front lines of Operation Desert Storm.
The combat-ready forces of the front lines

who await the next phase of the war are
