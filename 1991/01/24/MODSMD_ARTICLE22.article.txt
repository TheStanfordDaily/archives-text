# Stanford's politics definitely incorrect
## 
### 
I am restricting myself to talking
about the tip of the iceberg when it
comes to grave problems with Stanford
University politics. Let this letter be a
window into the larger world of the pro

hibitive and often hostile demagoguery I
have been subjected to.
I will not make reference to the
League of Revolutionary Struggle.
I will not make reference to the
changing of Western Culture to
Cultures, Ideas and Values.
I especially will not make reference to
Residential Education, which sees fit to
hammer down my throat experiences

and ideas, while I have lived enough of
an unsheltered life to be experienced and
exposed on my own.
I will mention, however, the war
protest in White Plaza on Thursday
afternoon. I attended the gathering wait
ing to listen to rational arguments
against military action, but I discovered
after the first few minutes that the
protest would serve as yet another

pedestal for "Politically Correct" view
points on issues totally unrelated to the
Gulf crisis (i.e. racial problems).
If this is such a liberal school, why is
the atmosphere so restrictive when it
comes to expressing viewpoints other
than those of the vocal minority?
