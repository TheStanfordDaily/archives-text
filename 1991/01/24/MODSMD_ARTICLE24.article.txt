## A 						real-life ratings war 
### 
Any war that lasts longer
than a Thursday night sitcom is
bound to lose its viewers because
Americans just don't have a very long
attention span.
They're used to seeing both conflict
and resolution occur within a simple half
hour (minus a few minutes of commer
cials, a.k.a. bathroom breaks).
So can you blame them for losing inter
est in the Persian Gulf War already? I
mean, if Marge Simpson can save the
nation's children from stagnating in front
of televisions and rid cartoons of violence
in a matter of 30 minutes, why can't Pres
ident Bush take out that loony toon in
Iraq in a few days?
Besides, Bush promised this thing
would be short — he'd better deliver this
time and not wimp out like on that "no
new tax" thing. 'Cause, man, we want
our football games and our soap operas
back on the air. So come on, Mr. Presi
dent, let's hurry up and finish this dang
war! If you can't do it, maybe we should
just send that blue-haired animated babe
over to take care of that Iraqi maniac
instead!
So after (count 'em) seven whole days
of war, people have turned their channels
as far away from CNN as they possibly
can. We don't want to hear from Bernard
Shaw anymore, they shout. We don't
want to hear another Middle East
"expert" trying to guess what will happen
tomorrow, they cry.
'Cause geez! Even when the damn lit
tle special reports aren't blaring about
(yes, yet another) missile attack, every
body's talking about The War.

Oprah and Donahue have swapped
their usual circus freak guests (i.e. the
man who was a woman who wanted to be
a man with breasts) and their pop-psych
Freudian therapists for audiences
crowded with our ever-loving ignorant
citizens.
Everybody's got an opinion on this
thing, it seems: from the "military
experts" on NBC to the 27-year-old
mechanic who swears if we don't stop
that Iraqi Hitler then communists will
take over the world. (Yeah, he's a bit con
fused, but who isn't?)
Even Mister Rogers broke out with a
little bit about the Persian Gulf crisis.
The little tiger puppet in the magical
kingdom tried to reassure little kids that
even during war somebody would always
love them.
You see, that's the problem with war;
they say, no matter what you do, you just
can't get it off your mind. The war is
everywhere.
So how can you er\joy yourself when
there's a war going on? What do you do
during a war, anyway?
Actually, I don't understand this impa
tience with the war. It seems that people
should actually love this kind of stuff.
I mean, this war is truly American. It's
a real-life movie. It's Sylvester Stallone
and Arnold Schwarzenegger fantasies in
real life. It's US against THEM and
we're kickin' some butt, as they say.
It's also got all the drama of football.
As one military official said on television,
"The troops are ready to kill some Iraqis
and go home." Ah, all in a day's work at
the stadium or in the Saudi Arabian

desert for these guys.
And besides, this war can definitely
satiate the public's re-run hunger. No
more "Leave it To Beaver" or "Gilligan's
Island" for us, no sir. The news is full of
stuff that has happened every day since
the war began.
NEWSFLASH: Today the Iraqis
launched a missile attack on . . . etcetera,
etcetera. You know the story.
But hey, maybe that's why these patri
ots have lost interest. Too much of the
same old stuff — one bomb for another.
No excitement. No gas. And Hussein can
hardly hit anything with his sorry mis
siles.
So why should they care? No one's get
ting hurt over there, for the most part,
and gas prices are down. That's all that
really matters for a lot of folks.
I think these guys want something
new. They want blood. Send in the troops.
Let's mix this up a bit.
Now that might spice up the news
some — create a new outrage, make us
care again. People would definitely be
more willing to give up their Thursday
nights with Cosby for a newsbreak with a
body count. That's America for you.
