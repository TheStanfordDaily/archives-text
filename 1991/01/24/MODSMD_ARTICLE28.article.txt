## Stanford, Arizona go at it again tonight in Maples 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
It only comes around a few times a
year. When it suddenly appears, its
power is devastating. Then, after doing
its damage, it disappears just as quickly.
It's called Maples Mania.
It's back . .. and this time, it's ticked
off.
Maples Pavilion has been a hell away
from home for the Arizona men's bas
ketball team during the last six years:
after winning the 1984 contest in Ari
zona, coach Lute Olson's first game
here, the Wildcats went five seasons
without another win on the Cardinal's
home floor.
That changed last Feb. 23, when Ari
zona charged into Maples, faced down a
sellout crowd and walked away with a
surprisingly easy 80-61 win. After the
Miracle of Maples I in 1988 — an 82-74
Stanford triumph over the then-No. 1
Wildcats — and the Miracle of Maples II
in 1989 — an 83-78 win in which Stan
ford came back from a 21-4 deficit —
last year's game was, to say the least,
anticlimactic.
"I definitely want to start a new
streak against them before I leave," said
forward Deshon Wingate, who was a
redshirt freshman during the first Mira
cle. "We beat them when they were No.
1, and we can do it again. It's really
important to me."
This time around, the Wildcats are
No. 5 in the country, but they have one
significant advantage over previous Ari
zona teams: That darned monkey is
finally off their backs.
"It was a problem mentally as much
as a problem physically," Olson said in
an interview yesterday. "But it wasn't a
case of us playing poorly, because Stan
ford always played extremely well.
"Most every one of those games was a
battle to the end. Until you actually end
up on top, though, you have a mental
block — and that block isn't there any
more."
The huge crowd, however, will still be
there. "It'll be a big lift," senior guard
John Patrick said. "If the crowd gets
into the game, it's like having an extra
player on the f100r.... It'd be great if
people got rowdy."
"Mentally, you try to get up to play
hard every night," Wingate said, "but a
huge crowd still helps a whole lot."
The only problem with all the excite

ment surrounding tonight's game is
that everyone tends to forget there are
two games this weekend — and that's
something that concerns Stanford coach
Mike Montgomery.
"We all do the same thing," Mont
gomery said. "Arizona comes in, and
everyone's excited, and then we have to
get up again for Arizona State (on Sun
day). If Arizona State's the best team in
the conference that's no big deal,
because everyone's going to lose to
them. But they're not the best team:
They're one of the schools we're com
peting with for a top spot in the league.
"In many ways, that game is more
important than Arizona," Montgomery
said. "In our minds there can't be a dif
ference, because they may be as hard to
beat as Arizona."
And — obviously — beating Arizona
isn't exactly going to be easy, crowd or
no crowd. The Cardinal is going to need
all the help it can get against the Wild
cats, who are leading the Pacific 10 Con
ference with a 4-1 record (15-2 overall).
The loss came at Washington three
weeks ago, and each of the four wins has
been close. That's caused some specula
tion, as in 1990, that Arizona might not
be as good as expected.
Right. "I remind people that a year
ago, everyone was saying Arizona isn't

the dominant team they were the previ
ous year, after Cal took us to overtime
down here," Olson said. The Wildcats
(who beat Cal 71-70 in that game) then
took that criticism and rammed it down
a few people's throats, going 14-1 in the
league the rest of the way.
The same pattern may well hold in
1991, but it's going to be a lot tougher.
The Pac-10's overall strength is "far and
away the best since I've been here, said
Olson, and that means there are proba
bly a few more close games in store for
his team. „
"There's great parity in the league,
Olson said. "It used to be that in the top
half you'd see a few upsets on the road,
but now it doesn't matter: It doesn t
make a difference who's playing or
whether they're at home or on the road,
because anyone can win."
Among other things, that means
there aren't a whole lot of friendly
places to play in the Pac-10 these days.
"I can think of a number of places I
don't like," Olson said. "Cal is not a
cakewalk; (UCLA's) Pauley Pavilion is
not among my favorite places; it's
always tough at the Oregon schools with
the crowds they get; and just last week
we were at Arizona State and they d

there. And we got beat at Wash
ington, so that's not a very happy
place either."
There's still one place, how
ever, that heads the list. "In the

last eight years, we've had more
problems winning at Maples than
anywhere else, Olson said.
"Pauley is usually the place where
no one can play, but we've had
more success there than at Stan
ford."

to keep that pattern going — and

be even more crucial.

Stanford triumph over the then-No. 1
Wildcats — and the Miracle of Maples II
in 1989 — an 83-78 win in which Stan
ford came back from a 21-4 deficit —
last year's game was, to say the least,
anticlimactic.
"I definitely want to start a new
streak against them before I leave," said
forward Deshon Wingate, who was a
redshirt freshman during the first Mira
cle. "We beat them when they were No.
1, and we can do it again. It's really
important to me."
This time around, the Wildcats are
No. 5 in the country, but they have one
significant advantage over previous Ari
zona teams: That darned monkey is
finally off their backs.
"It was a problem mentally as much
as a problem physically," Olson said in
an interview yesterday. "But it wasn't a
case of us playing poorly, because Stan
ford always played extremely well.
"Most every one of those games was a
battle to the end. Until you actually end
up on top, though, you have a mental
block — and that block isn't there any
more."
The huge crowd, however, will still be
there. "It'll be a big lift," senior guard
John Patrick said. "If the crowd gets
into the game, it's like having an extra
player on the f100r.... It'd be great if
people got rowdy."
"Mentally, you try to get up to play
hard every night," Wingate said, "but a
huge crowd still helps a whole lot."
The only problem with all the excite

ment surrounding tonight's game is
that everyone tends to forget there are
two games this weekend — and that's
something that concerns Stanford coach
Mike Montgomery.
"We all do the same thing," Mont
gomery said. "Arizona comes in, and
everyone's excited, and then we have to
get up again for Arizona State (on Sun
day). If Arizona State's the best team in
the conference that's no big deal,
because everyone's going to lose to
them. But they're not the best team:
They're one of the schools we're com
peting with for a top spot in the league.
"In many ways, that game is more
important than Arizona," Montgomery
said. "In our minds there can't be a dif
ference, because they may be as hard to
beat as Arizona."
And — obviously — beating Arizona
isn't exactly going to be easy, crowd or
no crowd. The Cardinal is going to need
all the help it can get against the Wild
cats, who are leading the Pacific 10 Con
ference with a 4-1 record (15-2 overall).
The loss came at Washington three
weeks ago, and each of the four wins has
been close. That's caused some specula
tion, as in 1990, that Arizona might not
be as good as expected.
Right. "I remind people that a year
ago, everyone was saying Arizona isn't

the dominant team they were the previ
ous year, after Cal took us to overtime
down here," Olson said. The Wildcats
(who beat Cal 71-70 in that game) then
took that criticism and rammed it down
a few people's throats, going 14-1 in the
league the rest of the way.
The same pattern may well hold in
1991, but it's going to be a lot tougher.
The Pac-10's overall strength is "far and
away the best since I've been here, said
Olson, and that means there are proba
bly a few more close games in store for
his team. „
"There's great parity in the league,
Olson said. "It used to be that in the top
half you'd see a few upsets on the road,
but now it doesn't matter: It doesn t
make a difference who's playing or
whether they're at home or on the road,
because anyone can win."
Among other things, that means
there aren't a whole lot of friendly
places to play in the Pac-10 these days.
"I can think of a number of places I
don't like," Olson said. "Cal is not a
cakewalk; (UCLA's) Pauley Pavilion is
not among my favorite places; it's
always tough at the Oregon schools with
the crowds they get; and just last week
we were at Arizona State and they d

last season.
sold the place out, so it's the same
there. And we got beat at Wash
ington, so that's not a very happy
place either."
There's still one place, how
ever, that heads the list. "In the

last eight years, we've had more
problems winning at Maples than
anywhere else, Olson said.
"Pauley is usually the place where
no one can play, but we've had
more success there than at Stan
ford."
Tonight, the Cardinal will try
to keep that pattern going — and
then, on Sunday, try to get ready
for a game that (ironically) might
be even more crucial.
It only comes around a few times a
year. When it suddenly appears, its
power is devastating. Then, after doing
its damage, it disappears just as quickly.
It's called Maples Mania.
It's back . .. and this time, it's ticked
off.
Maples Pavilion has been a hell away
from home for the Arizona men's bas
ketball team during the last six years:
after winning the 1984 contest in Ari
zona, coach Lute Olson's first game
here, the Wildcats went five seasons
without another win on the Cardinal's
home floor.
That changed last Feb. 23, when Ari
zona charged into Maples, faced down a
sellout crowd and walked away with a
surprisingly easy 80-61 win. After the
Miracle of Maples I in 1988 — an 82-74
Stanford triumph over the then-No. 1
Wildcats — and the Miracle of Maples II
in 1989 — an 83-78 win in which Stan
ford came back from a 21-4 deficit —
