# War keeps dignitaries at home

### Peter Robison Staff writer 
War in the Middle East will prevent several for
eign dignitaries from attending today's first meeting
of a new Stanford advisory council on global issues.
"Several cancellations were made because of the
situation in the Persian Gulf," said Nancy Okimoto,
associate director of the Institute for International
Studies, which is holding the meeting. "Many mem
bers are heads of state who cannot be out of their
countries at this time."
At the two-day conference of the International
Advisory Council, government officials, business
leaders and academics will discuss current global
issues.
Dignitaries who will not attend the council's first
meeting include Italian Prime Minister Giulio

Andreotti, newly appointed Soviet Foreign Minister
Alexander Bessmertnykh, Australian Prime Minis
ter Bob Hawke, African Academy of Sciences Chair
Thomas Odhiambo, former Special Adviser on Arms
Control to the President Paul Nitze, Egyptian For
eign Minister Ahmed Esmat Abdel Meguid and
spokesman of Deutsche Bank's board of managing
directors Hilmar Kopper.
Okimoto said a few officials — such as Canadian
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney — canceled as early
as November, when the United Nations announced a
Jan. 15 deadline for Iraqi forces to leave Kuwait.
"Clearly, you cannot expect someone who is a head of
state to be out of his own country at a time like this,"
Okimoto said.
While some administrators had previously been
concerned about the possibility of
terrorism, Okimoto said the deci
sions of some leaders not to
attend "had nothing to do with
fears of terrorism.''
Odhiambo's aides advised him
not to attend, Okimoto said,
because "his flight path required

him to change planes in Cairo, fly
ing directly over the Persian Gulf.
It was prudent for him not to fly."
She said other cancellations
were due to "normal attrition,
including health reasons."
Okimoto noted that a meeting
of the heads of state of British
Commonwealth nations was also
canceled last week because of the
war in the Middle East.
Members of the advisory coun

cil who will attend today's meet
ing include former President Ger
ald Ford, Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J.,
former Federal Reserve Board
Chair Paul Volcker, former Costa
Rican President and Nobel laure
ate Oscar Arias Sanchez, former
French President Valery Giscard
d'Estaing and former West Ger
man Chancellor Helmut Schmidt.
The conference meetings will
be closed to the public.
