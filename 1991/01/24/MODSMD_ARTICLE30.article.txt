# Athletes are not experts on war
## 
### 
If you have been living in a
remote Andean village for
the last month, you are
likely unaware that the world
is undergoing a period of mon
umental transition. Just last
year it seemed that good had
finally triumphed in this world
and evil had been eradicated.
And then tragedy struck.

The 49ers are not going to
the Super Bowl. What a
tragedy. Oh, by the way. You
may also be interested to know
that there's a war going on in
the Middle East.
Yes, the Super Bowl find the
Middle East are battling for
supremacy in the news this
week. Of course, you may feel
that since the beloved 49ers are
retiring early this season
there's no reason to follow the
Super Bowl. You'd just rather
keep up to date on the bloody
carnage in the Gulf.
Well, you're in luck. It seems
that the news coverage of these
two monumental events is not
necessarily mutually exclusive.
The Super Bowl, you see, and
the war in the Gulf, are inextri
cably linked. That's what the
National Football League
would have you believe, as
would the National Basketball
Association and the National
Hockey League.
Apparently the world of pro
fessional sports believes that
it's inappropriate for their boys
to be playing their grown-up
games while our boys and girls
are playing in the sand. So each
league in turn has considered
cancelling or postponing some
of its events until the war ends
and everyone comes home.
The NHL thought about
cancelling its All-Star Game,
which it played last weekend.
The NBA considered taking the
day off last Wednesday, the first
day of hostilities. And most

recently, rumors surfaced that
the NFL felt it necessary to
indefinitely postpone that
sacred American institution,
the Super Bowl.
Of course, cooler heads pre
vailed and none of the festivi
ties were cancelled. It seem"
that war is war and sports are
sports and everyone agrees
that there's little point in link
ing the two.
Well, there was one casualty
this week. The NFL cancelled
its annual Super Bowl party for
the above-stated reason. Par
ties and wars just don't mix.
But the NFL has yet to put
an end to all the festivities. It
seems that two nights ago in
Tampa, Buffalo quarterback
Jim Kelly and New York
linebacker Lawrence Taylor
were the guest judges at a local
nightclub's amateur topless
contest. So much for respectful
homage for our fighting men
and women.
Don't get me wrong.
Things must go on in
spite of the war. I'm no
political scientist, but if I'm not
mistaken, cancelling sports
events will not end the war any
sooner. They're just not con
nected.
And to the NFL's credit, the
Super Bowl will be played at its
appointed hour and will be pro
ceeded by an obscene amount
of news coverage. Even more
obscene will be the pomp, fan
fare and halftime show that are
the staples of this altogether
tactless event.
The players are still celebri
ties. And Lawrence Taylor and
Jim Kelly are carousing with
half-naked women at a local
nightclub.
So why cancel one lousy
party? Is there a point?
Okay. I grant you that I'm
getting hung up on a pretty
minor point. But why must
these two events be covered in
the same news reports?
The players from the Giants
and the Bills have been asked
about their feelings about the
war. They wear American flags
on their helmets. Journalists


David
Earnest
tell us that everyone in Tampa
has their mind on issues more
important than the Super Bowl.
After all, we're told, it's only a
game.
Well, I agree. It is only a game.
So let's treat it as such. Let's not
talk about the war. Let's not wear
flags on our helmets. Let's cele
brate at any occasion, revelling in
the sheer absurdity of this media
hyped event. Let's hear about
every stupid comment that Bruce
Smith or Marv Levy or Leonard
Marshall has to say.
But, at all costs, let us not
think that by some token expres
sion of our concern about the war
that we are magically absolved of
our moral responsibility to
address this difficult issue as
thoughtful, critical and concerned
human beings. Token measures
such as cancelled parties and flags
on the players' helmets are a poor
substitute for a responsible politi
cal expression of support of or

If I'm not mistaken
cancelling sports
events will not end
the war any sooner.

opposition to the events in the
Middle East.
The NFL's token measures do
little to promote such positive
thought. In fact, the message that
such efforts may send, that unre
lated symbolic gestures in some
substantial way contribute to
solving the problem of the war,
not only is symptomatic of an apa
thetic country but reinforces such
nonparticipation.
With such an influential media
beast like the NFL promoting
such trivial useless gestures, it
leaves little hope that the people
of this country will make an effort
to participate in the making of
America's policy at a time when
such input is critical.
After all, we'd just rather pas
sively watch a football game.

If you have been living in a
remote Andean village for
the last month, you are
likely unaware that the world
is undergoing a period of mon
umental transition. Just last
year it seemed that good had
finally triumphed in this world
and evil had been eradicated.
And then tragedy struck.

The 49ers are not going to
the Super Bowl. What a
tragedy. Oh, by the way. You
may also be interested to know
that there's a war going on in
the Middle East.
Yes, the Super Bowl find the
Middle East are battling for
supremacy in the news this
week. Of course, you may feel
that since the beloved 49ers are
retiring early this season
there's no reason to follow the
Super Bowl. You'd just rather
keep up to date on the bloody
carnage in the Gulf.
Well, you're in luck. It seems
that the news coverage of these
two monumental events is not
necessarily mutually exclusive.
The Super Bowl, you see, and
the war in the Gulf, are inextri
cably linked. That's what the
National Football League
would have you believe, as
would the National Basketball
Association and the National
Hockey League.
Apparently the world of pro
fessional sports believes that
it's inappropriate for their boys
to be playing their grown-up
games while our boys and girls
are playing in the sand. So each
league in turn has considered
cancelling or postponing some
of its events until the war ends
and everyone comes home.
The NHL thought about
cancelling its All-Star Game,
which it played last weekend.
The NBA considered taking the
day off last Wednesday, the first
day of hostilities. And most

recently, rumors surfaced that
the NFL felt it necessary to
indefinitely postpone that
sacred American institution,
the Super Bowl.
Of course, cooler heads pre
vailed and none of the festivi
ties were cancelled. It seem"
that war is war and sports are
sports and everyone agrees
that there's little point in link
ing the two.
Well, there was one casualty
this week. The NFL cancelled
its annual Super Bowl party for
the above-stated reason. Par
ties and wars just don't mix.
But the NFL has yet to put
an end to all the festivities. It
seems that two nights ago in
Tampa, Buffalo quarterback
Jim Kelly and New York
linebacker Lawrence Taylor
were the guest judges at a local
nightclub's amateur topless
contest. So much for respectful
homage for our fighting men
and women.
Don't get me wrong.
Things must go on in
spite of the war. I'm no
political scientist, but if I'm not
mistaken, cancelling sports
events will not end the war any
sooner. They're just not con
nected.
And to the NFL's credit, the
Super Bowl will be played at its
appointed hour and will be pro
ceeded by an obscene amount
of news coverage. Even more
obscene will be the pomp, fan
fare and halftime show that are
the staples of this altogether
tactless event.
The players are still celebri
ties. And Lawrence Taylor and
Jim Kelly are carousing with
half-naked women at a local
nightclub.
So why cancel one lousy
party? Is there a point?
Okay. I grant you that I'm
getting hung up on a pretty
minor point. But why must
these two events be covered in
the same news reports?
The players from the Giants
and the Bills have been asked
about their feelings about the
war. They wear American flags
on their helmets. Journalists


David
Earnest
tell us that everyone in Tampa
has their mind on issues more
important than the Super Bowl.
After all, we're told, it's only a
game.
Well, I agree. It is only a game.
So let's treat it as such. Let's not
talk about the war. Let's not wear
flags on our helmets. Let's cele
brate at any occasion, revelling in
the sheer absurdity of this media
hyped event. Let's hear about
every stupid comment that Bruce
Smith or Marv Levy or Leonard
Marshall has to say.
But, at all costs, let us not
think that by some token expres
sion of our concern about the war
that we are magically absolved of
our moral responsibility to
address this difficult issue as
thoughtful, critical and concerned
human beings. Token measures
such as cancelled parties and flags
on the players' helmets are a poor
substitute for a responsible politi
cal expression of support of or
