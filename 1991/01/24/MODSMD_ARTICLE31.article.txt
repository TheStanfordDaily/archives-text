# Goodenbour steps into the limelight
## 
### David Schwartz Staff writer 
As the buzzer sounds for sub
stitutions and number 15 enters
the game from the scorer's table
at center court, cheers and chants
of "Moll-y, Moll-y!" erupt from the
Stanford Band. When Stanford
women's basketball coach Tara
VanDerveer looks to the bench,
sophomore guard Molly Gooden
bour is often one of the first play

ers called.
Last season, as a freshman,
Goodenbour appeared in 26 of 33
games, serving as a backup to
National Player of the Year Jen
nifer Azzi. Although she averaged
just 2.7 points per game last year,
Goodenbour shot 45.5 percent
from three-point range while play
ing eight minutes a game.
Goodenbour honed her game
playing for the West Team at the
U.S. Olympic Festival in Min

neapolis this past summer, and
returned to the Farm poised to
challenge for the team's off-guard
spot.
With the graduation of Azzi
and backup Stacy Parson, the
Waterloo, lowa, native appeared
to have the inside track. Indeed,
Goodenbour started eight of the
Cardinal's first nine games. How
ever, the emergence of freshman
guard Christy Hedgpeth
prompted VanDerveer to relegate
Goodenbour to a reserve role.
"I don't really think I've played
up to my capabilities yet," Good
enbour said, "but we're winning,
and if that's what it takes to be'
successful, I'm happy."
Goodenbour's versatility and
athletic ability makes coming off
the bench easier, according to Van-
Derveer. "I think that she's really
helped our team in a lot of differ
ent situations," VanDerveer said.
"She's a very well-conditioned
athlete and she runs the floor very
well, and I think that her condi
tioning could really help us to play
defense, push the ball on the
break, and make good decisions
with the ball."
In this backup role,
Goodenbour has appeared in all
15 of Stanford's games. She is
averaging 5.9 points per game and
1.7 assists per game while playing
an average of 18 minutes.
Goodenbour is most noted by
fans for her three-point shooting
ability. She leads the team in
three-point shot attempts, and
has converted 34.4 percent of her
"treys." At 5-foot-6, Goodenbour
would almost rather launch from
long distance than drive into traf
fic.
"It seems to be the one (shot)
that I get most often," Gooden
bour said. "I think my height has
a lot to do with that. It's easier to
stand up there and take the three
than drive in and [face] somebody
6-7."
However, even though Gooden
bour is a strong three-point
shooter, she is aiso comfortable
running the offense. Her size and
her abilities make her natural role
point guard.
"I think really her true position
is a point guard, so she's really
playing behind an Ail-American
point guard in Soi\ja Henning,"
commented VanDerveer. "Molly's
5-5 and Christy's 5-10, and I think
that Christy is coming on really
strong, but I think that there is
plenty of playing time and oppor
tunity for Molly and Christy and
Soi\ja."
In this way, Goodenbour
embodies the spirit of a team

player. Even though she did not
play in the Final Four last year,
she still enjoyed the experience
from the bench.
"The whole team was so
involved last year . . . that it really
didn't matter," she said. "We were
all so into it, [and we were] a real
cohesive unit. It (was] just a great
feeling to be part of a team that
won."
Goodenbour is no stranger to
success on the basketball court,
however, and was the focal point
of her team in high school. As a
senior at Waterloo West High
School, she averaged 18 points,
seven assists, five rebounds, and
five steals per game.
Her skills were duly recog
nized. Goodenbour was named an
All-America by Street & Smith's,
Women'B Basketball News Service
and Parade Magazine. She was
also named the Gatorade Midwest
Regional High School Player of
the Year, and the State of lowa's
"Miss Basketball."
Despite her past success, Good
enbour is still waiting for her
chance to shine. VanDerveer real
izes that Goodenbour would
rather be starting than coming off
the bench, but with a team as tal
ented as the Cardinal, cracking
the lineup is extremely tough.
"Early on I thought she was
doing real well," VanDerveer said.
"Molly just has to stay intense,
keep working hard, and not be dis
couraged. She can really help our
team a lot."

Sophomore Molly Qoodenbour has done a good job for the Cardinal
at the off guard spot this year. She Is one of the best pure shooters
on the team and has made a fashion statement as well, sporting
nifty black shoes.
As the buzzer sounds for sub
stitutions and number 15 enters
the game from the scorer's table
at center court, cheers and chants
of "Moll-y, Moll-y!" erupt from the
Stanford Band. When Stanford
women's basketball coach Tara
VanDerveer looks to the bench,
sophomore guard Molly Gooden
bour is often one of the first play

ers called.
Last season, as a freshman,
Goodenbour appeared in 26 of 33
games, serving as a backup to
National Player of the Year Jen
nifer Azzi. Although she averaged
just 2.7 points per game last year,
Goodenbour shot 45.5 percent
from three-point range while play
ing eight minutes a game.
Goodenbour honed her game
playing for the West Team at the
U.S. Olympic Festival in Min

neapolis this past summer, and
returned to the Farm poised to
challenge for the team's off-guard
spot.
With the graduation of Azzi
and backup Stacy Parson, the
Waterloo, lowa, native appeared
to have the inside track. Indeed,
Goodenbour started eight of the
Cardinal's first nine games. How
ever, the emergence of freshman
guard Christy Hedgpeth
prompted VanDerveer to relegate
Goodenbour to a reserve role.
"I don't really think I've played
up to my capabilities yet," Good
enbour said, "but we're winning,
and if that's what it takes to be'
successful, I'm happy."
Goodenbour's versatility and
athletic ability makes coming off
the bench easier, according to Van-
Derveer. "I think that she's really
helped our team in a lot of differ
ent situations," VanDerveer said.
"She's a very well-conditioned
athlete and she runs the floor very
well, and I think that her condi
tioning could really help us to play
defense, push the ball on the
break, and make good decisions
with the ball."
In this backup role,
Goodenbour has appeared in all
15 of Stanford's games. She is
averaging 5.9 points per game and
1.7 assists per game while playing
an average of 18 minutes.
Goodenbour is most noted by
fans for her three-point shooting
ability. She leads the team in
three-point shot attempts, and
has converted 34.4 percent of her
"treys." At 5-foot-6, Goodenbour
would almost rather launch from
long distance than drive into traf
fic.
"It seems to be the one (shot)
that I get most often," Gooden
bour said. "I think my height has
a lot to do with that. It's easier to
stand up there and take the three
than drive in and [face] somebody
6-7."
However, even though Gooden
bour is a strong three-point
shooter, she is aiso comfortable
running the offense. Her size and
her abilities make her natural role
point guard.
"I think really her true position
is a point guard, so she's really
playing behind an Ail-American
point guard in Soi\ja Henning,"
commented VanDerveer. "Molly's
5-5 and Christy's 5-10, and I think
that Christy is coming on really
strong, but I think that there is
plenty of playing time and oppor
tunity for Molly and Christy and
Soi\ja."
In this way, Goodenbour
embodies the spirit of a team

player. Even though she did not
play in the Final Four last year,
she still enjoyed the experience
from the bench.
"The whole team was so
involved last year . . . that it really
didn't matter," she said. "We were
all so into it, [and we were] a real
cohesive unit. It (was] just a great
feeling to be part of a team that
won."
Goodenbour is no stranger to
success on the basketball court,
however, and was the focal point
of her team in high school. As a
senior at Waterloo West High
School, she averaged 18 points,
seven assists, five rebounds, and
five steals per game.
Her skills were duly recog
nized. Goodenbour was named an
All-America by Street & Smith's,
Women'B Basketball News Service
and Parade Magazine. She was
also named the Gatorade Midwest
Regional High School Player of
the Year, and the State of lowa's
"Miss Basketball."
Despite her past success, Good
enbour is still waiting for her
chance to shine. VanDerveer real
izes that Goodenbour would
rather be starting than coming off
the bench, but with a team as tal
ented as the Cardinal, cracking
the lineup is extremely tough.
"Early on I thought she was
doing real well," VanDerveer said.
"Molly just has to stay intense,
keep working hard, and not be dis
couraged. She can really help our
team a lot."
