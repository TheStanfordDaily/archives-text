# Rugby team gets off to a good start
## 
### Michelle Ghert Staff writer 
In a game that was not as
close as the 17-16 final score
suggests, the Stanford men's
rugby team defeated Humboldt
State on Cardinal home turf last
Saturday. In a strong defensive
game, Stanford held the lead
throughout with Humboldt
State scoring near the end to
shave the Cardinal lead down to
one point.
"We dominated them defen
sively," Cardinal captain Simon
Fleming-Wood said. "We really
weren't in danger of losing".
Despite the win, Stanford
coach Franck Boivert was some
what disappointed with the Car
dinal performance.
"The game was disappointing
because we couldn't get any

clean balls in the lineout for
offense," Boivert said. "We
played too long in defense and
that's why Humboldt was able to
come back at the end and leave
us with such a narrow victory."
Stanford was favored going
into Saturday's game, but with
the Lumberjacks placing only
one spot behind Stanford's third
place in the Northern California
Rugby Federation Union last
Sear, the game was expected to
e challenging.
"We expected them to be a
tough team and they were,"
Fleming-Wood said.
"We nad to replace our start
ing hooker, Matt Tripp, because
of an ankle injury," Boivert said.
"We also made some technical
mistakes that really hurt us."
Nevertheless, Stanford pulled
away with two four-point tries,

one each scored by Ed Stevens
and Glen Flores. Fleming-Wood
scored the remaining nine points
with three drop-goals.
"Glen had a tremendous
game, especially in defense,"
Boivert said. "Ed had a good
game, but he needs more experi
ence at his position."
Another notable performance
was that of junior J.J. Lasley
who made his rugby debut after
completing the football season
as the Cardinal tailback.
"J.J. had a terrific game,"
Boivert said. "He had a huge
impact both offensively and
defensively."
"Saturday was my first rugby
game ever," Lasley said. "It's a
lot different than football
because you're not wearing pads
and you have to run a lot more

without any rest.... I kept hav
ing to ask Simon if I was in the
right place."
The Cardinal is now 2-0 on
the season and hopes to remain
undefeated by beating Santa
Clara this weekend. The Cardi
nal will be traveling to Santa
Clara Saturday and Boivert
expects the game to be "a very
tough one for us."
"We're looking good and
we're optimistic," Fleming-Wood
said. "But we know we nave a
long way to go and a lot of
improving to do before we beat
some really good teams."
Along with the rest of the
team, Lasley is expecting a close
game this Saturday and hopes to
get into the offense a bit more.
"I want to score my first try
with many more to come,"
Lasley said.
