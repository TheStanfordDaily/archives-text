# CAMPUS BANDS
## All dressed up and no place to play

The times they are a changin'.
Only two years ago, the campus
was host to multiple all-campus
parties running from Wednesday
night through Saturday night, and
every other bash featured a popular
campus band.
Now, finding an open, all-cam
pus party is as difficult as finding a
mobile Scud missile launcher, and
the existing campus bands are pay
ing the price.
The new alcohol policy and the
move by fraternities toward closed
parties has noticably cut the num
ber of events available for campus
bands, and the increased popular
ity of DJ services has cut even fur
ther into the bands' market.
Surprisingly, though, the lower
demand has done little to cut the

supply of bands on campus. An
Intermission survey found no
fewer than six active bands which
spend hours playing together each
week, even if there are no gigs to be
found.
"There are more bands, they're
better and they're playing less,"
lamented Mark Geller, drummer
and business manager for The Vir
ginia Tfcai, who have been playing
in different forms for two years.
"Since we've started playing as a
band, there has definitely been a
decrease in the number of venues
to perform."
Members and managers of other
bands concur. "Dorms are having a
lot fewer parties, and fraternities
don't have as many open parties,"
said Laura Schiff, manager for
Never Been to Tbxas. Schiff added
that the groups hosting parties are
also less willing to pay the usually
higher fees of bands compared to
disc jockeys.
As Uncle Wiggly guitarist Doug
Dorst puts it, "Most folks are just
happy listening to DJs and watch
ing flashing red lights."
Geller said people opt for the
dependability of DJ services
because of bad previous experi
ences with bands, but he believes
people miss out on the excitement
of live performance. "The physical
presence of the musicians is the
total difference," he explained.

Anton Schwartz, a rare graduate
student entry on the campus band
scene, said the poor band situation
is unique to Stanford — at least
compared to his Harvard under
graduate experience.
"There's a much greater appre
ciation for live music at Harvard,"
he said. "The people here aren't
really aware that there's much dif
ference between a live band and a
good DJ."
Because of the crisis, campus
bands are occasionally playing for
free to get exposure and looking
beyond the campus for venues.
The Virginia T&ai recently played a
San Jose State party and the Palo
Alto High School homecoming,
and is now looking for possible
club dates.
Several bands are also increas
ingly playing smaller Row houses,
a non-traditional venue for campus
bands.
Geller believes several more
bands have cropped up on campus
but avoid the party scene because
it's too much work to find gigs.
"There are more bands around that
are just jamming together because

it's less work."
The pressures on campus
bands, which are already high
internally and externally, are
heightened by the lack of perfor
mances available. "There's a lot of
inertia against you," Geller noted,
including making practice time,
finding practice and storage space
and keeping all band members sat
isfied.
"It's a question of different com
mitments and how well the band
members get along together. You
can make time to play," he said.
All those pressures have con

tributed to the soap opera-like
development of campus bands,
which has seen players move
between bands quicker than Eliza
beth Taylor switches husbands.
The Virginia Tfcai is in its third
configuration; Uncle Wiggly is
made up of former Ice Weasels and
Cerebral Paisleys; and Screw's lead
singer formerly headed The Vir
ginia Tfcai when it was Marci and
the Moongods.
Despite the desire to play live,
most band members reasoned that
their primary motivations and
rewards are internal. Screw gutarist

Greg Nagler called being in a band
an opportunity to "express yourself
musically," and Geller emphasized
the thrill of playing for playing's
sake.
However, Schwarz countered
that it's impossible to recreate the
rewards of live performance. "It's
great to make people move."

These five nice young boys make up Uncle Wiggly, one of Stanford's bands. Many of the members of
the band previously performed with other campus groups — such as Cerebral Paisley and The Ice
Weasels.
