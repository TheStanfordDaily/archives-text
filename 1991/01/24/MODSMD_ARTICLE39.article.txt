## 
### Mara Winokur Editorial staff 
There are many ways to cele
brate an anniversary. Some people
throw a party. Some people go on
vacation. And some people ignore
the whole thing.
The Stanford Humanities Cen
ter, however, is putting on an opera.
Well, not exactly an opera opera,
with fat women and bearded men
and strange words that make you
think it's Italian when it's really
English. Not at all. But, to cele
brate its 10th anniversary (and
Stanford's 100 th), the Stanford
Humanities Center is putting on
an opera of sorts â€” John Gay's
263-year-old musical comedy,
"The Beggar's Opera.
"The Beggar's Opera" has been
called the world's first musical
comedy. This may or may not be
true. However, it is definitely the
forerunner of musical theater in
the English-speaking world. It was
written 50 years before Mozart,
was a smash hit in its day, and con
tinues to be a success across the
globe.
The longevity of "The Beggar's
Opera" can be explained by its
humor and charm, which tran
scend time. Though it was origi
nally written as a satire of Italian
Baroque opera and of the political

figures of 1728, the musical criti
cizes society in such a manner that
it remains endearing today. Espe
cially true to our time are the witti
cisms of lawyers, politicians, beg
gars and thieves.
The "opera" is about a dapper
criminal, Mac Heath, who is
secretly married to Polly Peachum,
whose parents, in turn, make their
living as the heads of a gang of
thieves. Mac Heath, however, is
also married to Lucy Lockit, the
daughter of a local jailer. Mr.
Peachum and Lockit have long
been supporting themselves by
turning in criminals to the govern
ment to be hanged, for which they
receive a reward. When Mr.
Peachum finds that his daughter is
married to Mac Heath, he deter
mines to have him hanged as well,
to rid himself of an unwanted son
in-law while making money as
well.
The show is being directed by
Daniel Helfgot, production man
ager and stage director for Opera
San Jose. Assisting him is Denise
Boling King, an advanced graduate
student in the Department of
Drama. King has directed many
other campus productions previ
ous to this one. Also working on
the production is Sean Sullivan, a
senior drama major and stage
manager for several Ram's Head

musicals. Sullivan is not only stage
manager and production assistant,
but is also starring in"The Beg
gar's Opera" as one of Mac Heath's
gang of thieves.

'The Beggar's Opera'
has been called the
world's first musical
comedy.

Many of the other roles are held
by Stanford graduates and under
graduates as well. Lisa Fragner, a
senior history and drama major,
plays one of Mac Heath's ladies, as
do Leslie Goddard and Cathy
Yuspa, both senior drama and
English majors. David Howell, a
junior drama major; also appears
as a gang member. Additional cast
members are actors and singers
from Bay Area companies such as
West Bay Opera, Theatre Works
and The Lamplighters.

"The Beggar's Opera" is playing at
Dinklespiel Auditorium on fan. 26
at 8 p.m., and fan. 27 at 3 p.m.
Tickets cost $8, 55 for students,
and can be purchased from the
Tresidder Ticket Office, 723-4317.
