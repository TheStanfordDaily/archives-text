# University cuts bill for indirect costs
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
The University announced yesterday that it
would remove about $500,000 from its bill to the fed
eral government for indirect costs of research
incurred during the last decade.
The move is part of a package of initiatives put
forward yesterday by Stanford, whose indirect cost
recovery practices have come under heavy fire from
several federal agencies during the last several
months.
The University has decided to withdraw all costs
claimed since 1981 for the operation of three Univer
sity-owned residences, including Hoover House,
home of University President Donald Kennedy. Last
month, revelations surfaced in the press that the
University had billed the government $3,000 for a
cedar-lined chest, $2,500 to refurbish a piano and up
to $2,000 a month for flower arrangements there.
While the University contends that a fraction of
such operating expenses can be legally charged to the
government under federal rules, administrators said
yesterday that continuing to charge the government
for these items was not worth the public confusion
that has resulted from the recent disclosures.
In addition to withdrawing these controversial
costs, the University said it had hired an outside
accounting firm, Arthur Andersen and Co., to evalu
ate its accounting system and had appointed an out
side panel to advise Kennedy on indirect cost issues.
University administrators said the actions taken
yesterday were an effort to tackle
head-on many of the concerns
that have been raised about the
University's policies. "We expect
this initiative to put us on the
swiftest path toward resolution of
the questions that have been
raisea about accountability for
indirect federal research costs at
Stanford," Kennedy said in a pre
pared statement.
Staff members of the House
Subcommittee on Oversight and
Investigations, one of the three
federal agencies scrutinizing
Stanford's practices, responded to
the announcement with guarded
optimism.
"It appears as if they're trying
to make a good faith effort to
make up for past problems," said
one congressional investigator.
"But it's unfortunate these issues
are being addressed in hindsight.
These are problems Stanford
should have been on top of."
The $500,000 in charges that
Stanford has decided to withdraw
represents only a small fraction of
the $554 million in indirect cost
recovery Stanford received from
the government during the last
decade. Paul Biddle, a federal reg
ulator based at Stanford, has said
that the University may have
overcharged the government by
as much as $175 million during
this period.
Most of the amount Biddle is
contesting concerns "memoranda
of understanding" signed by Stan
ford and the Office of Naval
Research, the federal agency
responsible for monitoring Stan
ford's research practices. Stan
ford and the Navy have begun a
review of these agreements,
scheduled to be completed this
spring.
Kennedy said in an interview
yesterday that he believed most of

the agreements were "quite
solid."
Yesterday's announcement by
the University will not have a sig
nificant effect on Stanford's indi
rect cost rate, which is now 72
percent.
That means that for every
$10,000 of federally-sponsored
research conducted at Stanford,
researchers must obtain an addi
tional $7,200 to cover the indirect
costs of the project. Indirect costs
are those expenditures not easily
attributable to a specific research
project and include such costs as
electricity, maintenance and
administrative overhead.
In addition to costs incurred at
Hoover House, Stanford has with
drawn charges from Lake House,
the residence of Vice President for
Public Affairs Robert Freelen,
and Hanna House, the home of
Provost James Rosse. All three
residences are owned by the Uni
versity.
Because some research-related
activities are held at these facili
ties, the University is allowed to
charge the government for a frac
tion of the operating expenses of
the residences.
The subcommittee has ques
tioned the validity of individual
items that are part of residences'
operating costs, saying such items

as flowers and pianos have little to
do with federal research and
should not be charged to the gov
ernment.
Larry Horton, associate vice
president for public affairs, said
yesterday that he hopes by elimi
nating these costs, the parties can
focus their attention on more
important issues, such as the
extent to which the government
should support the indirect costs
of research. "The debate is not
well-served by focusing on these
individual items," he said.
Members of the outside panel
that will advise Kennedy include
retired Navy Adm. Bobby Inman,
former director of the National
Security Agency and former
deputy director of the Central
Intelligence Agency; Rev. Timothy
Healy, former president of
Georgetown University and cur
rent president of the New York
Public Library; and Joseph Con
ner, chair of Price Waterhouse
World Firm Ltd.
In an interview, Kennedy said
Inman is "really one of the
smartest people I know." Kennedy
said he hopes Inman and other
panel members will offer candid
advice about ways to improve the
University's indirect cost policies.
