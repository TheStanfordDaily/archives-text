## RESTAURANT REVIEW Set your sights on Pasta Moon 
### Marni Rager 
If Frankie, Johnnie and Luigi is your definition
of an Italian restaurant, you must try Pasta Moon.
This cozy establishment is authentically ethnic in
all aspects.
The food is sensational and the atmosphere is
lovely. And it's the perfect place whatever the occa
sion — a quiet evening or a special event, a night
out with friends or dinner with your relatives. And
its Half Moon Bay location makes Pasta Moon all
the more appealing.
The only drawback of Pasta Moon is its menu
— there's too much to choose from! There were so
many dishes, I couldn't decide. But I had a job to
do. So, for appetizers, I tried the Involtini di Melan
zane — grilled eggplant, stuffed with ricotta and
mascarpone cheese and baked with a light tomato
sauce.
Thily amazing.
My absolute favorite appetizer, though, was the
Mozzarella di Bufala — fresh tomatoes, imported
buffalo mozzarella cheese and fresh basil. Don't
miss it.
As much as I liked the appetizers, I needed to
move on. And pasta seemed like the way to head.
It's made daily and you can taste it. And no matter
if you like Tagliatelle Con Quattro Formaggi or just
plain old spaghetti and meatballs, you'll be able to
find something. Or, more accurately, somethings.
For seafood lovers, the Linguine con Frutta di
Mare is loaded with fresh fish, jumbo prawns,
mussels and Manila clams. Words do not do it jus
tice. If you're not a fish lover, however, don't panic.
Tty the Lasagne Imbotitte — baked pasta, layered
with ricotta, mozzarella and parmesan cheeses and
Sicilian sausage. Both of these dishes were superb.
On the oft chance that you don't like pasta
(doesn't everyone?), Pasta Moon does offer other
dishes. The specials change daily and are always
unique. The night I dined there, it was a double
free range chicken breast sauteed with mush
rooms, prosciutto, dry vermouth and topped with
imported fontina cheese.
Pasta Moon is a well-kept secret, and because of
this, it is very personal. The waiters and chef are
more than willing to honor requests, or even take
time out just to talk to you. They want to please
you as much as you want to be pleased.
And they do a wonderful job.
