# Bookstore tips: Bag the books and buy the bard
## 
### 
As a public service to Stanford
shoppers, we went undercover
last week to determine what
books were worth your money.
We were shocked to discover that the
Bookstore, unlike Safeway, did not
include price per pound data for any of
its merchandise. We needed to rectify
this grave oversight. Thus, our first
order of business was to procure a scale.
We could have possibly scored one off
the Physics Department, but we were
afraid we'd get a rinky-dink one with lit
tle square sliding things on it. Tbo time
consuming.
No, after a fair amount of searching,
we decided that the scale in the candy
store was perfect. It was completely dig
ital, and it was accurate to two decimal
places (a crude round-off, to be sure, but
flexibility is essential when working in
the field). By convincing the young
women in the candy store that we were
covertly funded maverick quality-con
trol experts, we gained access to the
apparatus.
The long journey down to the text
book underworld dampened our enthu
siasm for toting all the books up to our
new HQ in the candy store. At once, we
agreed that price per cubic inch was also
a meaningful, even necessary, bench
mark for any book's value. In a single,
fluid motion, one of us (not sure which)
produced a tape measure and barked
out the dimensions of the first book.
Except for the persistent badgering of
a woman who wore a hat that looked
like a dog, we were not disturbed during
our survey. Bookstore employees were
exceedingly accommodating and, for
once, they were eager to assist us. As
well they should have been. We were
two official-looking men with a tape
measure and a clipboard.
Here are just a few of the many con
clusions we drew from our five-page
table of raw data:
• Students should avoid buying
books that have the suffix, "-scopy" in
their names. The Murder of Charles the
Good, an English book, was about
eighty-nine cents cheaper per cubic inch
than Artifacts in Biological Electron
Microscopy, a book of equivalent vol
ume. Admittedly, the pictures in the -
scopy books were splendid, but we fig
ure for the $41.50 we'd save, we could
buy a nice bowl of fruit and use up an
entire roll of film on it.
• Observe the Law of the Long Name
when selecting books. As a general rule,
books with long names cost much more
than books with more spartan titles. Of

course, the title need not have a dozen
words to satisfy this law. All it takes is
one ridiculously overblown word in a
title to catapult a reasonable price per
cubic inch into the realm of the insane.
Consider two books: Land of Hope and
Design of Geosynchronous Spacecraft.
Both have roughly the same volume,
but the mere presence of a windbag
word like "geosynchronous" makes the
second book wouth 84 cents more per
cubic inch.

We left the Book
store, mulling over
the reams of data we
had accumulated.
We felt an indescrib
able sense of uncer
tainty, a feeling that
all our work left us no
better off than
before.

• If possible, use law books in all of
your classes. They may appear daunt
ingly big and expensive, and they often
have nasty, threatening, multi-word
titles, but they are actually some of the
best values in the store. This is true
even though electrical engineers (for
example) may snicker at law students
hauling twice their body-weight in text
books up the stairs. But the joke is on
the engineers (for example). They will
pay $64.20/lb for Introduction to
Fourier Optics, while Western Euro
pean and Latin American Legal Sys
tems costs a trifling $5.50/lb.
But something was wrong with the
whole picture. A shopping cart full of
Tang was less costly than even the
finest bookly bargain. We discovered
that all of our conclusions were simply
manifestations of a single, fundamental
precept: no matter what books you
buys, books isn't the best buys for your
bucks. No matter how you slice it, a
generous portion of printed paper
wedged between two thick slabs of card
board is, at an average of $32.60/lb.,
certainly not chopped liver. Further
more, a wooden wafer of the same

weight provides an equal amount of
calories when ignited. So, unless you've
got money to burn, books are a very
inefficient flse of your limited dollars.
But if one does not buy books, what
is a more prudent investment? Years of
practice have trained us to flock like
buzzards to the textbook section, dish
ing out scads of cash for items that
aren't worth it. It will certainly not be
easy to shed ourselves of this habit.
In order to help Stanford students
move in the right direction, we under
took an investigation to locate items
which provide more bang for your reces
sion buck.
Weaving through a host of freshmen
gathered around the Great Works sec
tion, we made our way toward the
stairs. As we ascended out of the Great
Pit, we looked back at the hapless stu
dents, scurrying from shelf to shelf,
loading their baskets with expensive
combustibles. "Lemmings," we sighed
in unison. (We do everything in unison.
No we don't. Yes we do.) It became evi
dent that our task involved more than
simply reducing the average monetary
flux through the average Stanford stu
dent's wallet. Ours was a mission of
discovery — an epic quest to seek out a
new and better lifestyle for Stanford
kind, or at least to find some cheap
stuff.
We returned to the upper deck of the
four-level Stanford Department Store
which offers students (and whomever
they need to buy quick, stupid gifts for)
a cornucopia of items to fulfill their
every need. We immediately seized one
such item — a ceramic bust of Shake
speare (with removable head) — and
sought to weigh it and determine its
actual value.
Of course, we again needed the ser
vices of the precision candy-scale. This
time, unfortunately, the candy-woman
was somewhat reluctant to let us utilize
that instrument's two decimal-points of
accuracy to measure a ceramic bust of
Shakespeare (with removable head).
Thinking quickly, we distracted her by
tying her up, planting earphones on her
head, and leaving her in the language
lab. Our ploy worked surprisingly well
— she never quite noticed our clandes
tine use of her scale. In fact, if you'd like
to visit her, she's still in Meyer learning
Quecha.
Losing no time, we slipped Shake
onto the scale. At $30.00, he weighed in
at 1/43 lbs., yielding a price per pound
of $21.00. What a bargain! Now, we
thought, we're getting somewhere. After
conferring briefly with a guy named

Larry who we met hanging out at the
candy counter apparently waiting for
something, we began an investigation
of Stanford logo items.
We procured two keychains. The
first was a bona-fide, authorized Stan
ford model emblazoned with the pithy
witticism "I'm Rich." The second was a
generic model bearing the heartfelt
credo "I Like Boys." Both fine items —
but which was the better deal? A few
complicated computations yielded a
price per pound of $350.00 for the Stan
ford "I'm Rich" keychain, compared to
$250.00 per pound of generic "I Like
Boys" keychains. Clearly, both items far
exceed the average book's price per
pound, so they should be avoided in
favor of ceramic busts of Shakespeare
(with removable heads). But even
though both keychains were expensive,
the Stanford one was easily the costlier
of the two; Stanford is charging its stu
dents $100 per pound for use of its
name.
The top floor of the Bookstore proved
to be a treasure trove full of inexpensive
little goodies. We were sorely tempted to
purchase a Stanford Ail-American Foot
ball Helmet Snack Bowl ($15.90/lb.!!)
We left the bookstore, mulling over
the reams of data we had accumulated.
We felt an indescribable sense of uncer
tainty, a feeling that all our work left us
no better off than before. Everything in
the Bookstore is expensive, and that
didn't help us.
We headed off to Safeway, where we
knew we could get an honest deal.
Afterwards, as we wheeled our cartload
of Tang to the car, we smiled in unison.
We had ourselves a real bargain.
