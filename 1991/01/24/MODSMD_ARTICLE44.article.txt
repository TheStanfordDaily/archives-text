Pop Will Eat Itself
Cure for Sanity
Grade: D+
Tb begin their newest album,
"Cure For Sanity/' Pop Will Eat
Itself starts with a sampling of tel
evangelist Jimmy Swaggart's voice.
"What is the truth about rock
music?" Swaggart asks. "Music is
a powerful and perhaps the most
powerful medium in the world."
Swaggart concludes by deciding
that rock music is Satan's way of
corrupting the minds of future
generations. Swaggart's religious
tirade is obviously wrong; "Cure
For Sanity" is hardly Satanic.
However, his words are still
poignant; the album is plain bad.
Far from the cutting edge of alter
native music, Pop Will Eat Itself is
nothing more than shoddy college
radio fodder
Pop Will Eat Itself should know
better on their third album. Exten
sive sampling hastily mumbled
lyrics and an overwhelming drum
beat cannot support an entire
album. Each song of the foursome
seems to drag on much too long,
such as "Dance of the Mad Bas
tards," which loses its momentum
quicldy, despite the fact that it's
the first song.

Pop Will Eat Itself is
nothing more than
shoddy college
radio fodder.

And the rest of the album never
picks up speed. Unlike Pet Shop
Boys or Information Society, Pop
Will Eat Itself seems quite content
to scream incoherent lyrics rather
than make any attempt at vocal
variation. (Sure, the Pet Shop Boys
and Information Society can't
really sing, but at least they try.)
This band even pales in the
shadow of Big Audio Dynamite.
"Cure For Sanity" quickly
degenerates into pure synthesized
noise, lacking musical variety and
lyrical substance. Only "X Y &
Zee" is strong enough to carry its
quick-paced beat to the end. When
Pop Will Eat Itself says "A musical
nasty/Fast as it has to be/A catas
trophe," they couldn't be more
right. But "Cure For Sanity"
couldn't be more wrong.
