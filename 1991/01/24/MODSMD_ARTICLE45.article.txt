with a controversial drug, l-DOPA.
Encephalitis is a sleeping disease; those

mary patients Is Leonard towe (DeNlro). A
tearjerker. This year's "Rain Man.* Almost

The Russia House
Sean Cannery, Michelle Pfelffer,
Roy Schelder
Buoyed by terrific performances, this
story of International Intrigue begins when
an anonymous Soviet citizen named Dante
sends a book to British publisher Barley Blair
(Connery) — a book exposing the short
comings of the Soviet military system. Blair
gets pulled unwittingly Into a maze of
Soviet, American and British espionage,
and wittingly Into a relationship with
Dante's girlfriend Katya (Pfelffer). Brilliant
performances by Pfelffer, Connery and
Scheider as an American Intelligence direc
tor make up for an occasionally confusing
plot that provides several clues after they
would be helpful — much like the great
"Chinatown."
Dances With Wolves
Kevin Costner, Mary McDonnell

You still haven't seen It? What's wrong
with you?
Kindergarten Cop 4
Arnold Schwarzenegger,
Penelope Ann Miller
II It's an obvious gimmick. Arnold goes
* undercover as a knldergarten teacher to
catch a drug dealer. His ferret helps. That
may not be self-explanatory. Well* go see
the movie and you'll understand. You won't
be sorry.
THE FLICKS FIX
Wild at Heart
Nicholas Cage, Laura Dern
Sunday night. David lynch. That says it
all.
