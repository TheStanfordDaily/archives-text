Hamlet
Mel Gibson, Glenn Close
Grade: A-
There is more truth spoken in Shakespeare's
"Hamlet" than in possibly any other play ever
written. Luckily for modern moviegoers, direc
tor Franco Zeffirelli's film adaptation remains
true to the spirit and richness of the bard's orig
inal script.
Sure, some of Hamlet's soliloquies are cut
short and the supporting cast's roles mini
mized (the full script is estimated to take four
hours to perform), but Zeffirelli's screenplay
focuses on the heart of the play without
stretching the patience of modern movie audi
ences.
The plot and dialogue are obviously
untouchable, and few doubted Zeffirelli's abili
ties. With past successes like "Taming of the
Shrew" and "Romeo and Juliet/' Zeffirelli has
proven himself as a top Shakespearean movie
director.
That leaves the big question: How does Gib
son fare in his most serious role to date? Well,
don't let "Lethal Weapon" or "Mad Max" fool
you.
Although he makes the ultimate tragic hero
less bookish than the usual portrayal, Gibson's
Hamlet features the traditional character ele
ments — contemplative and cynical as ever,

with an appealing streak of melancholy and
madness weaving its way in and out of his
character
In the movie's most brilliant scene, the
madcap Prince of Denmark torments Queen
Gertrude, King Claudius and Ophelia in a
whirlwind of action. Slouching in his throne
with a sinister stare, jumpy with excited antic
ipation, Gibson bounces between his mother
and uncle with jabs about their quick marriage
— and finishes the scene off by planting an
impassionate kiss on the confused Ophelia,
right after telling her to "get thee to a nunnery."
Close doesn't get much early screen time as
Queen Gertrude, but her later interactions with
Hamlet instill the part with a strong sense of
motherly love. Helena Bonham-Carter submits
a brilliant performance as a strong but con
fused Ophelia, as does lan Holm as a rambling,
philosophical Polonius.
The most troubling aspect of the film is the
trumped-up sexual tension between Hamlet
and his mother, which Zeffirelli plays up in a
simulated sexual encounter in the Queen's
chamber, as well as several overly affectionate
kisses between a mother and son.
Despite its minor shortcomings, "Hamlet"
should successfully inspire uninitiated modern
film audiences to experience Shakespeare,
without ruining the perceptions of modern-day
Elizabethans. — Tim Marklein

Mel Gibson stars in Franco Zeffirelli's screen adaptation of
Shakespeare's "Hamlet." It's a far cry from Gibson's previous
roles, but he handles it with finesse. Even the old bard himself
would be proud.
