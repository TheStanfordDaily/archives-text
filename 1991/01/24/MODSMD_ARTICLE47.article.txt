Hidden Agenda
Francis McDormand, Brian Cox
Grade: A-

A squad of soldiers armed with com
bat rifles march through a cold concrete
apartment building. They approach a
door and pound on it. A split second
passes — no reply. The soldiers charge
through the door and find a young
mother and her child. Mom is arrested
and dragged away; the child is left alone.
This is the setting for the film "Hid
den Agenda." This is Northern Ireland.

When director Jim Loach concerns
himself with "the troubles" in Northern
Ireland, his film is very good. Yet, the
ultimate direction of the film leads into
an incredible conspiracy plot that is as
unnecessary as it is fascinating.
The story opens with two American
civil liberties activists investigating acts
of torture by British forces. On the
morning that Paul Sullivan (Brad Dou
rif) and Ingrid Jessner (McDormand)
are to fly home, Sullivan suddenly
decides to meet with an Irish Republi
can Army (IRA) sympathizer Sullivan

and his contact are gunned down by
undercover Royal Ulster Constabulary
(RUC) officers.
The killing catches the eye of the
press. To silence the claims of cover-up,
the British send in their top investigator,
Sergeant Kerrigan (Cox).
Stark realism is the strong suit of the
film and is an effective choice. The
images are not overtly stylized; the vio
lence is not glamorized. When some
thing happens, it happens suddenly and
brutally.
Loach successfully forgoes the tradi

tional techniques for building suspense.
He obviously wants to depict reality, not
"surreality/' and that he does.
And as long as the investigation per
tains to events relating to Northern Ire
land, it succeeds in conveying suspense
and paranoia. However, the script by
Jim Allen insists instead to focus on a
very intriguing conspiracy, one that Ker
rigan uncovers. By the time it was fully
explained I could not help but ask,
"What does this have to do with any
thing?"
