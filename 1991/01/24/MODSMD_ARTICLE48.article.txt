White Fang
Ethan Hawke, Klaus Maria Brandauer
Grade: B
If you miss the excitement and innocence
of a live-action Disney movie, then go see
"White Fang," a family film based on the
popular Jack London novel.
With its vast Alaskan setting and the tra
ditional Disney motif of a boy and his dog,
"White Fang" is a gorgeous and spirited
adventure that is not necessarily for the
under-eight crowd.
Ethan Hawke ("Dead Poets Society") plays
Jack Conroy, a 19-year-old from San Fran
cisco who arrives in Alaska during the Gold
Rush of 1897.
In search of a mining claim staked out by
his late father, Jack meets up with a Klondike
gaide who reluctantly agrees to take Jack to
is destination. The guide, played by the fine
German actor Klaus Maria Brandauer, even
tually becomes a father figure for Jack.
More essential to the plot, however, is a
half-wolf, half-dog named White Fang whom
Jack befriends on his travels.
The story takes several exciting turns, as
both the boy and his dog encounter life
threatening situations in the wild, such as a
spectacular sequence with a giant grizzly
bear.

Excuse the comparison, but "White Fang"
is a lot like "Pretty Woman" with a wolf-dog
in Julia Robert's role: the two main charac
ters are thrust together through a series of
misfortunes, and at first they don't like one
another.
Then they learn to love each other, but
through another series of misfortunes they
are suddenly torn apart. Finally, they wind up
together again because love has a funny way
of overcoming anything in the movies.
Hawke and Brandauer are good enough to
keep "White Fang" afloat even in the scenes
where no animal is present.
As the cold guide, Brandauer is just gritty
enough to make his character three-dimen
sional and convincing. When the wolf does
appear on screen, the live actors hold their
own and manage to be almost as interesting
as their canine counterpart.
Although "White Fang" is not as com
pelling or moving as last year's nature
odyssey "The Bear," it is nonetheless a great
matinee adventure with the distinguished
Disney stamp.
Its breathtaking scenery of the Alaskan
wilderness propels the slightly predictable
story, making it more enjoyable for the par
ents who take their kids.
