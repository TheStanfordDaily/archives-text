Eve of Destruction

Grade: Incredible Isn't a strong
enough word for It.
OK, so I saw the press release
for this movie and thought, "How
bad could it be?"
It was worse. Much worse.
lb start off, Gregory Hines plays
Jim McQuade, an expert in anti
terrorist operations. Now I'm all
for overcoming typecasting, but as
my friend said, "What's he going to
do? Ibp dance all over the enemy's
face?"
I'm surprised the writers didn't
think of it.
Next, we've got this top secret
government project that involves
creating robots that look and feel
exactly like humans. Except for the
nuclear weapon that are embedded
in their insides. Small detail.
Ignore it until later.
Dr. Eve Simmons (Soutendijk)
is the master mind behind these
"surveillance devices." (Remember,
you're ignoring the nuclear weapon
for now. Even though it can take
out 20 to 30 city blocks, it doesn't
matter. SURVEILLANCE DE
VICES. Keep it in mind.)
Dr. Simmons is also the model

for Eve VIII, the most advanced
robot to date. What does this
mean? This means that Eve VIII
not only looks like Dr. Simmons;
she is programmed with her
thoughts, feelings and memories.
All of them.
So when Eve VIII goes haywire
on a test run, due to the fact that a
bank robber shot her in the stom
ach, and runs across the country
killing people, Dr. Simmons knows
why she's doing it.
And I'm sure that comforted a
lot of people.
Or would have, if they had
known about it. Which they didn't
because the whole thing was top
secret. Until the end, when they
blame it on — I'm not kidding here
— Iraq. No joke.
OK, let's bring in that nuclear
weapon now. It gets activated.
(Admit it, you're surprised. I was.)
So McQuade and Simmons have to
track down this bitch and kill her.
No easy task.
Of course, they do. (Did I give
too much away?) But in the pro
cess, we get to learn some of Sim
mons' most private fantasies and
McQuade's favorite curse words.
Don't miss it. It has to be seen
to be believed.
