# Dry cleaning a cost of research?
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
Just hours after Stanford
announced it would no longer
charge the government for such
controversial items as flowers
at Hoover House, congressional
investigators revealed a host of
other items that seemingly have
little to do with research.
During the late 1980s, Stan
ford included thousands of dol
lars of antiques, linens, wine,
dry cleaning bills and catering
bills in its indirect cost recovery
claims, a congressional source
said.
Except for the wine, the
items were all included in the
operating expenses of Lou
Henry Hoover House, the resi
dence of University President
Donald Kennedy.
Under federal rules, a frac
tion of the operating expenses
of Hoover House can be billed to
the government as an indirect

cost of research since the facil
ity also serves as the site of sev
eral research conferences and
receptions. The congressional
investigators, however, are
questioning some of these costs .
because they "have nothing to
do with research," said a staff
member of the House Subcom
mittee on Oversight and Inves

tigations.
University administrators
downplayed the significance of
the new revelations. "They've
already been taken off the
table," said University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy, referring
to the announcement earlier in
the day to withdraw costs related
to several University-owned resi
dences from Stanford's indirect
cost claims.
Kennedy said he had concluded
that charging such controversial
items was not worth the public
conftision that has been gener
ated.
Among yesterday's revelations
were "thousands of dollars of
liquor, including dozens of $70
bottles of wine" purchased in
1986 for consumption at Lake
House, the University-owned res
idence of Vice President for Pub
lic Affairs Robert Freelen, a con
gressional investigator said.
In an interview, Freelen said
such costs were legal under gov
ernment rules, but added that "to
the best of my knowledge, we've
never bought a $70 bottle of
wine."
Freelen said wine for recep
tions at his house is purchased in
bulk at the beginning of the
school year. The charge in ques
tion is likely $70 per case of wine,
he said.
One of the more amusing find
ings, the congressional source
said, was a $4,000 bill in 1988 for
"edible art."
"Edible Art," Kennedy ex
plained yesterday afternoon, is a
catering firm. "Catering firms
have cute names," Kennedy said.
"I can't help it."
The congressional investigator
said they had found several cater
ing bills from Hoover House in
excess of $10,000.
Hoover House hosts about 75
University functions each year,
according to Stanford officials.
About 23 percent of the operat
ing expenses of Hoover House
and Lake House are charged to
the government as indirect costs
of research.
