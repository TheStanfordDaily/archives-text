## 'De Donde' takes a look at the problem of Mexican immigration 
### Anita Schneider Staff writer 
A well-crafted production of
low-key intensity, the Theatre-
Works presentation of the contem
porary docudrama "De Donde?"
derives its name from the first
question Immigration and Natu
ralization Service agents ask His
panics whom they suspect are ille
gal aliens.
The story, written by California
born Mary Gallagher, begins when
La Extrana, a Central American
refugee, secretly crosses the border
with two Mexican farm laborers
and is caught and harassed by two
border patrolmen. These same
agents later turn to the audience
and question it in a confronta
tional tone.
But this is not a play centered
around racism, or possible racism.
While the question of whether to
open the border to all of the
oppressed who live south of the
United States, or continue to

By going off on so many tangents, it's
hard to empathize with the main char
acter. Perhaps it's the playwright's
intent that the main character not be a
person, but the idea of America's limit
ed freedom.

impose tough laws on them is
explored, the focus is on a more
general issue.
The play favors more liberal
American laws, but it's the method
in which the laws are enforced that
is criticized. A fascinating web of
subplots help bring to light the var
ied opinions of lawyers, judges,
legal immigrants and illegal aliens
on this complex issue.
One prominent subplot
involves Felicia (Alisa Becerra), a
Mexican-American who harbors
illegal aliens, and her boyfriend

Tfeto (Gary Castillo), a devoted bor
der patrol agent. When Tfeto discov
ers Felicia's secret activities, he
becomes angry and defensive but
admires her fighting spirit. This
scene reveals the complex and
opposing views held by Mexican-
Americans themselves.
However, the story eventually
becomes an intellectual exercise,
and would be more powerful if it
focused specifically on La
Extrana's personal nightmare. By
going off on so many tangents, it's

hard to empathize with the main
character. Perhaps it's the play
wright's intent that the main char
acter not be a person, but the idea
of America's limited freedom.
The entire ensemble, most of
whom play multiple roles, all per
form admirably. Mary Ann
Rodgers as La Extrana is appropri
ately tentative and soft spoken.
Frank Lucero as Alirio, a Sal
vadorean refugee and student
activist accused of running guns to
the guerillas, is convincing as the
somewhat innocent young student
who's at the mercy of his dispro
portionate reputation. And Amelia
Martinez Schumacher is warm and
gracious in her duel roles of Nydia
and Luz.

"De Dondel" will play through
Feb. 2 at Bp.m. Thursdays through
Saturdays and 7 p.m. Sundays.
Performances are at the Cubberley
Stage II Theater in Palo Alto. For
