# Teach-in criticizes, supports, explains war
## 
### 
The two-day teach-in on the Persian Gulf war
came to a close last night as four professors debated
the effects of U.S. policy in the Middle East before an
overflow crowd of more than 800 in Kresge Audito
rium.
The program, "U.S. Policy in the Middle East:
Diplomacy, War and Future Implications" capped off
the second day of sessions examining a wide range of
different aspects of the war, from possible outcomes
of conflict to the role of the media.
Moderator Carolyn Lougee, associate dean of
Humanities and Sciences, said in her opening
address that last night's discussion — like other
teach-in events — was designed "in an effort to
reduce our incomprehension" about the Persian
Gulf War.
The debate began with History Prof. Joel Beinin,
who said the United States' objective in the Middle
East campaign is to "create a new world order" and
"preserve the existing balance of power, which coin
cides with U.S. interests."
Beinin criticized the United States-led coalition
efforts, which he said only "create political instabil
ity" in the region.
Asst. Political Science Prof. Scott Sagan, who
described himself as a "reluctant and heavy-hearted
supporter of the war," described various scenarios
for the war's outcome. Sagan said he hopes for an
outcome in which the United States wins a limited
war that avoids the "dismemberment" of Iraq.

expressed his personal fears about
U.S. actions. "The war promises to
strengthen the sectors of the econ
omy that I personally would least
likely want to see strengthened,"
Eagen said.
Computer Science Prof. John
McCarthy echoed Ffegen's hopes for
a stronger United Nations in the
future. He cited the principal war
aim as "making the [United
Nations] a force for peace, as was
planned in 1946."
Earlier in the afternoon, four
panelists discussed the "Gulf War
and its Aftermath."
Issues covered during the ses
sion, which drew an audience of
almost 200 to Herrin Hall, ranged
from whether protesters can end
the war to what will happen when
it does end.
Mark Mancall, a history and
Jewish Studies professor, asked the
other panelists to "deal with the
real world" when they talked about
immediate U.S. withdrawal from
the Persian Gulf.
"I think the idea that we are
going to stop the war is nonsense,"
he said. "This is not Vietnam, and
this is not the 19605."
Khalil Barhoum, a senior lec
turer in linguistics, disagreed. "Do
not isolate yourself and do not
despair," he said. "You are not help
less."
An open forum at the Hoover
Memorial Building yesterday
morning discussed the viewpoint
supporting President Bush and the
war in the Persian Gulf.
Charles Hill, senior research fel
low at Hoover and a former foreign
service officer, opened the two hour
discussion entitled "Why the U.S.
Policy in the Gulf is Right." He said
he could base his remarks on just
three points because, "It's so clear.
It's not a complicated case."
Hill first noted that the 20th

century has been characterized by
political systems and ideologies
that have sought to deal with
modernity. Most of these systems
— dynasties, fascism and Marxism-
Leninism — have been "bad" sys
tems, he said.
The Gulf war is the result of
another of these bad systems — a
resurgence of nationalism and
socialism in the Gulf, he said.
Hill continued by saying that
"the line in the sand" was drawn a
long time ago by the international
community when it collectively
agreed upon "laws of war." Saddam
Hussein has violated these princi
ples, thus provoking retaliation by
the world community, he said.
The fact that the world commu
nity was in accord with the United
States, as shown by the U.N. reso
lution sanctioning the use of force,
was the third important validation
of the war, Hill said.
The role of the media in the cri
sis was addressed by two professors
and a social activist who spoke to
over 100 students in the Anthro
pology Museum during a seminar
titled, "How Do We Read the
Media?"
According to Carol Wilder, pro
fessor of Communication at San
Francisco State University, one of
the government's most effective
rhetorical techniques is paralyzing
public actibn ana keeping people
off-balance by sending alternating
messages of war and peace. "By the
time [war] came down, 82 percent
of us were paralyzed and thought
that bombing Baghdad was great. I
think Bush is brilliant," she said.
Communication Prof. Jeremy
Cohen also told the audience to be
aware of the limitations put on the
media because they are not allowed
on the front line and, for the most
part, know very little about the his
tory and culture of the Middle East.

who said the United States' objective in the Middle
East campaign is to "create a new world order" and
"preserve the existing balance of power, which coin
cides with U.S. interests."
Beinin criticized the United States-led coalition
efforts, which he said only "create political instabil
ity" in the region.
Asst. Political Science Prof. Scott Sagan, who
described himself as a "reluctant and heavy-hearted
supporter of the war," described various scenarios
for the war's outcome. Sagan said he hopes for an
outcome in which the United States wins a limited
war that avoids the "dismemberment" of Iraq.

expressed his personal fears about
U.S. actions. "The war promises to
strengthen the sectors of the econ
omy that I personally would least
likely want to see strengthened,"
Eagen said.
Computer Science Prof. John
McCarthy echoed Ffegen's hopes for
a stronger United Nations in the
future. He cited the principal war
aim as "making the [United
Nations] a force for peace, as was
planned in 1946."
Earlier in the afternoon, four
panelists discussed the "Gulf War
and its Aftermath."
Issues covered during the ses
sion, which drew an audience of
almost 200 to Herrin Hall, ranged
from whether protesters can end
the war to what will happen when
it does end.
Mark Mancall, a history and
Jewish Studies professor, asked the
other panelists to "deal with the
real world" when they talked about
immediate U.S. withdrawal from
the Persian Gulf.
"I think the idea that we are
going to stop the war is nonsense,"
he said. "This is not Vietnam, and
this is not the 19605."
Khalil Barhoum, a senior lec
turer in linguistics, disagreed. "Do
not isolate yourself and do not
despair," he said. "You are not help
less."
An open forum at the Hoover
Memorial Building yesterday
morning discussed the viewpoint
supporting President Bush and the
war in the Persian Gulf.
Charles Hill, senior research fel
low at Hoover and a former foreign
service officer, opened the two hour
discussion entitled "Why the U.S.
Policy in the Gulf is Right." He said
he could base his remarks on just
three points because, "It's so clear.
It's not a complicated case."
Hill first noted that the 20th

century has been characterized by
political systems and ideologies
that have sought to deal with
modernity. Most of these systems
— dynasties, fascism and Marxism-
Leninism — have been "bad" sys
tems, he said.
The Gulf war is the result of
another of these bad systems — a
resurgence of nationalism and
socialism in the Gulf, he said.
Hill continued by saying that
"the line in the sand" was drawn a
long time ago by the international
community when it collectively
agreed upon "laws of war." Saddam
Hussein has violated these princi
ples, thus provoking retaliation by
the world community, he said.
The fact that the world commu
nity was in accord with the United
States, as shown by the U.N. reso
lution sanctioning the use of force,
was the third important validation
of the war, Hill said.
The role of the media in the cri
sis was addressed by two professors
and a social activist who spoke to
over 100 students in the Anthro
pology Museum during a seminar
titled, "How Do We Read the
Media?"
According to Carol Wilder, pro
fessor of Communication at San
Francisco State University, one of
the government's most effective
rhetorical techniques is paralyzing
public actibn ana keeping people
off-balance by sending alternating
messages of war and peace. "By the
time [war] came down, 82 percent
of us were paralyzed and thought
that bombing Baghdad was great. I
think Bush is brilliant," she said.
Communication Prof. Jeremy
Cohen also told the audience to be
aware of the limitations put on the
media because they are not allowed
on the front line and, for the most
part, know very little about the his
tory and culture of the Middle East.
