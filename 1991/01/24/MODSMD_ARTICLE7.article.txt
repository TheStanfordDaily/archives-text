The two-day teach-in on the Persian Gulf war
came to a close last night as four professors debated
the effects of U.S. policy in the Middle East before an
overflow crowd of more than 800 in Kresge Audito
rium.
The program, "U.S. Policy in the Middle East:
Diplomacy, War and Future Implications" capped off
the second day of sessions examining a wide range of
different aspects of the war, from possible outcomes
of conflict to the role of the media.
Moderator Carolyn Lougee, associate dean of
Humanities and Sciences, said in her opening
address that last night's discussion — like other
teach-in events — was designed "in an effort to
reduce our incomprehension" about the Persian
Gulf War.
The debate began with History Prof. Joel Beinin,
who said the United States' objective in the Middle
East campaign is to "create a new world order" and
"preserve the existing balance of power, which coin
cides with U.S. interests."
Beinin criticized the United States-led coalition
efforts, which he said only "create political instabil
ity" in the region.
Asst. Political Science Prof. Scott Sagan, who
described himself as a "reluctant and heavy-hearted
supporter of the war," described various scenarios
for the war's outcome. Sagan said he hopes for an
outcome in which the United States wins a limited
war that avoids the "dismemberment" of Iraq.
