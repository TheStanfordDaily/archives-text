# WAR IN THE GULF
## Two Iraqi jets downed along Saudi coast

D HAH RAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) â€” Iraq's
elusive air force showed signs of life yesterday
and sent two warplanes along the Saudi coast
carrying the feared Exocet anti-ship missiles.
Both fighters were promptly shot down.
Military officials in Dhahran said a Saudi
pilot flying a U.S.-made F-15 shot down two
Iraqi Mirage F-l fighter jets.
"I just rolled in behind them and shot them
down," said the pilot, who was identified only
as Capt. Ayedh.
A Saudi military spokesman, Col. Ahmed al-
Robayan, described it as "an intense dogfight
over the coast" in which two Saudi F-15s tan
gled with two Iraqi F-l Mirages, and one of the
Saudi pilots shot down both Iraqi planes.
"We believe this is the first air battle of the
war to produce a double kill by a single pilot,"
he said.
Al-Robayan said the Iraqi planes, loaded
with Exocet missiles and probably bombs, were
shot down 12 miles inside Saudi territorial
waters at 12:35 p.m. The dangerous Exocets
are used against ships.
Meanwhile, Iraq mocked the allies for fail
ing to launch a ground offensive, but allied
commanders said they would stick to their
game plan and intensify the around-the-clock
air strikes on Iraq and occupied Kuwait.
U.S. officials said more than 3,000 missions
were flown yesterday, the busiest day since the
war started, and scores of warplanes took off
from a mcyor air base in clear weather early
today. There are more than 50 air bases used
by the allies in the Persian Gulf region.
The U.S. Navy scored a victory in the north
ern Persian Gulf, taking 51 Iraqis prisoner on a
tiny Kuwaiti island and sinking an Iraqi
minesweeper, American officials reported.
