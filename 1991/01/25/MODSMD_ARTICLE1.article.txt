# WAR IN THE GULF
## Two Iraqi jets downed along Saudi coast 
### 
D HAH RAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) â€” Iraq's
elusive air force showed signs of life yesterday
and sent two warplanes along the Saudi coast
carrying the feared Exocet anti-ship missiles.
Both fighters were promptly shot down.
Military officials in Dhahran said a Saudi
pilot flying a U.S.-made F-15 shot down two
Iraqi Mirage F-l fighter jets.
"I just rolled in behind them and shot them
down," said the pilot, who was identified only
as Capt. Ayedh.
A Saudi military spokesman, Col. Ahmed al-
Robayan, described it as "an intense dogfight
over the coast" in which two Saudi F-15s tan
gled with two Iraqi F-l Mirages, and one of the
Saudi pilots shot down both Iraqi planes.
"We believe this is the first air battle of the
war to produce a double kill by a single pilot,"
he said.
Al-Robayan said the Iraqi planes, loaded
with Exocet missiles and probably bombs, were
shot down 12 miles inside Saudi territorial
waters at 12:35 p.m. The dangerous Exocets
are used against ships.
Meanwhile, Iraq mocked the allies for fail
ing to launch a ground offensive, but allied
commanders said they would stick to their
game plan and intensify the around-the-clock
air strikes on Iraq and occupied Kuwait.
U.S. officials said more than 3,000 missions
were flown yesterday, the busiest day since the
war started, and scores of warplanes took off
from a mcyor air base in clear weather early
today. There are more than 50 air bases used
by the allies in the Persian Gulf region.
The U.S. Navy scored a victory in the north
ern Persian Gulf, taking 51 Iraqis prisoner on a
tiny Kuwaiti island and sinking an Iraqi
minesweeper, American officials reported.
They said a second minesweeper exploded
and sank, apparently after hitting a mine
while trying to escape.
Three Iraqis were killed on Qaruh Island
yesterday in the latest action by the U.S.
Navy along the Kuwaiti coast, where Iraqis
have been sowing mines and installing anti
aircraft weapons on oil platforms.
The United States and Britain each lost
a warplane during Wednesday night. The
American pilot was saved in a dramatic res
cue after his jet was disabled by ground fire
and he ejected over the Gulf.
The two crewmen of the British Tornado
GR-1 fighter-bomber are missing, British
sources in Riyadh said.
The losses occurred as allied forces took
advantage of clearing skies to step up their
relentless ail assault on Iraq and Kuwait.
Many of the attacks concentrated on Iraq's
elite Republican Guards, an Army
spokesman said.
The Republican Guards, the backbone of
the Iraqi armed forces, are a self-contained
military force with infantry, air defense,
tanks, artillery, intelligence, special opera
tions forces and medical and logistics sup
port.
"We are hitting them with all assets
available to us," U.S. Army Lt. Col. Greg
Pepin said. He estimated that more than
150,000 of the guards are "well dug in"in
Kuwait and southern Iraq.
The sorties are inflicting heavy damage
on the guards, U.S. pilots and military com
manders said yesterday, but neither pro
vided casualty figures.
The allied tactics call for "softening up"

the Iraqi forces from the air before trying to
eject them from Kuwait by ground.
The number of allied sorties passed
15,000 yesterday, Pepin said. Allied sources
in Dhahran said the U.S.-led coalition
wants to pick up the pace, flying more than
3,000 missions a day if the skies remain
clear as they were yesterday and early
today.
In addition, Pentagon sources said yes
terday that U.S. submarines, operating
from the depths of the Mediterranean and
Red seas, are continuing to fire Tomahawk
cruise missiles at targets inside Iraq.
Two Iraqis were reported killed Tuesday
night in a clash between an Iraqi patrol and
members of the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regi
ment in a forward area of the Army's 18th
Airborne Corps in northern Saudi Arabia.
Maj. Steven Campbell said the Iraqis
may have been trying to surrender. Six
Iraqi soldiers were captured after the fight.
Two Americans were injured.
In a Pentagon briefing yesterday, the
number of U.S. forces now in the Gulf was
put at 478,000.
Iraq has been parading its prisoners of
war in an apparent effort to boost morale at
home. Baghdad radio broadcast yesterday
interviews with men it described as two
captured American and one captured Ital
ian airmen.
Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, said Wednesday in Washing
ton that air attacks would intensify along
supply routes and lines of communications
around the Iraqi city of Basra, near the
Gulf and Kuwaiti border, in an attempt to
strangle the Iraqi army in Kuwait.
