# A 						Continuing Studies degree?
## Plan would grant master's in liberal arts 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
The Faculty Senate opened
debate yesterday on a controver
sial measure that would allow the
Continuing Studies program to
grant a master's degree in liberal
arts.
Initiated in September 1988,
the Continuing Studies program
offer* night courses taught by
Stanford faculty to adults in the
community. Currently, there are
about 500 people enrolled in the
program and between 15 and 20
courses offered each quarter.
While the program itself was
universally praised by senate
members yesterday, several fac
ulty members voiced concerns
about possible side effects of
granting a master's degree for
continuing education courses.
English Prof. Herbert Linden
berger suggested that degrees
granted by the program should
not be called "master's" degrees.
He said he was bothered by the
prospect of adults "coming in
through the back door" to obtain
what would be characterized pub
licly as a "master's degree from
Stanford."
History Prof. Carolyn Lougee
expressed reservations about the
additional obligations that would
be placed on the University if the
program began granting degrees.
Offering such a degree, she
argued, would obligate Stanford
to offer a certain number of
courses each quarter and limit the
program's flexibility.
Marsh McCall, dean of the Con
tinuing Education program,
defended the proposal, character
izing it as an opportunity for the
program's participants to receive
an "intellectual final validation"
for their studies.
After about 45 minutes of
debate, the senate voted to post
pone a decision on the matter
until its next meeting.
In other senate business, Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy

urged faculty members to be
understanding of students who
were under duress due to the war
in the Gulf.
Kennedy condemned the post
ing last week of a flier in Roble
Hall that read "all moslims must
die in the desert." According to
Law Prof. Thomas Grey, who
authored the interpretation of the
Fundamental Standard adopted
last spring, posting the flier was

not a violation of the conduct
code.
Nevertheless, Kennedy said
yesterday, it "is a deplorable state
ment in every way and is not
acceptable."
A scheduled address by Acting
Vice President for Student Affairs
Sally Mahoney was postponed due
to the lengthy discussion of earlier
agenda items.
