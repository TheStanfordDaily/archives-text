# Faculty questions Kennedy on indirect-cost practices
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
In a hour-long discussion of
the indirect cost controversy
that has enveloped Stanford,
faculty members yesterday
offered a wide assortment of
comments, ranging from con
cern for Stanford's image to
criticism of its accounting
methods.
Stanford's indirect cost poli
cies are the subject of ongoing
investigations by three federal
agencies: the Office of Naval
Research, the House Subcom
mittee on Oversight and Inves
tigations, and the General
Accounting Office.
In a stinging speech directed
at University President Donald
Kennedy, Engineering Prof.
Anthony Siegman called Stan
ford's cost allocation system
"convoluted" and "dysfunc
tional."
"It's impossible to defend
the current Stanford system,"
he said, "in part because it's
essentially impossible to
explain it and have other peo
ple either understand you or
believe you."
Siegman said Stanford
should be more explicit about
how it allocates indirect costs
to all its activities, not only
research. Only then, he said,
could it be known if the Uni
versity is charging the govern
ment a fair rate for federal
research performed here.
Kennedy countered that

'It's Impossible to
defend the current
Stanford system, In
part because it's
essentially impossi
ble to explain it.'

while Siegman's suggestion
had merit on an abstract level,
it was not practical to use an
accounting system sophisti
cated enough to measure the
indirect costs of all University
activities. t
"I think it would cost us
more than we would gain,"
Kennedy said.
Kennedy was also ques
tioned as to how great of a
financial risk the investiga
tions pose to the University.
Stanford and the U.S. Navy are
currently reviewing a set of
agreements between the two
parties called memoranda of
understanding. If all the agree
ments are declared invalid,
Kennedy said, the University
would stand to lose a "substan
tial amount," he said.
However, Kennedy was
quick to add, "we do not think
that is remotely likely."
Kennedy said the University
is continuing to cooperate with
the various inquiries and is
prepared "to 'fess up" to any
problems that are discovered.
