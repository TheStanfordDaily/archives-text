Lithuania accuses Soviets of kidnapping
VILNIUS, U.S.S.R. (AP) — Lithuania's president accused
Soviet troops of two kidnappings yesterday, and reformers in the
Russian legislature failed to muster enough votes to pass a reso
lution condemning military attacks in the Baltic republics.
Vytautas Landsbergis, president of separatist Lithuania, con
demned the overnight abduction of two draft-age students and
the military occupation of two buildings on Wednesday.
"These events can only be labelled as the continued license of
the Soviet Armed Forces (to operate) despite ... promises that
this would be discontinued," Landsbergis told Lithuania's parlia
ment. He was alluding to a statement Tuesday by Soviet Presi
dent Mikhail Gorbachev saying there would be no more military
assaults on separatist government bodies in the Baltics.
Reformers were given a setback yesterday by the continuing
Soviet military activities in the Baltic republics and the failure of
Russian federation lawmakers to pass a resolution condemning
the incidents.
Soviet foreign minister to meet with Baker
WASHINGTON (AP) — Soviet Foreign Minister Alexander
Bessmertnykh will meet with Secretary of State James Baker
tomorrow as the Bush administration nears a decision on
whether to postpone next month's summit meeting in Moscow,
officials said yesterday.
The new foreign minister, formerly Moscow's ambassador to
Washington, also was expected to meet with President Bush on
Monday during a session at the White House with Brent
Scowcroft, the President's national security adviser.
Two U.S. officials, demanding anonymity, said Bush would see
Bessmertnykh, who was expected to remain in Washington until
Tuesday or Wednesday.
The talks are certain to concentrate on the Soviet crackdowns
in Lithuania and Latvia as well as on arms-control issues and the
Persian Gulf war.
