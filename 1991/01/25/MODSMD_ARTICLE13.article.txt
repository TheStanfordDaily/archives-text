# U.N. kills cease-fire attempt
## 
### 
The U.N. Security Council
rebuffed an Arab attempt to open
a public debate on a cease-fire in
the Persian Gulf war yesterday.
Instead, the council president
urged Iraq to withdraw its troops
from Kuwait.
"Iraq's Aug. 2, 1990, aggres
sion and war against Kuwait must
be ended," said council president
Bagbeni Adeito Nzengeya, the
Zairian ambassador. "The major
ity of the members will be associ
ated with my statement."
He was asked if the council
would refuse to adopt any resolu
tion or statement on the war
unless Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein is willing to retreat.
"I think this is the mtyority
stance," he replied.
