BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP)
— The federal army and security
forces in the pro-independence
republic of Croatia were put on
battle alert yesterday and tanks
were moving near the Croatian
capital, news media reported.
A meeting set for today
between Serbia's communist
President Slobodan Milosevic and
Croatia's conservative leader,
Fraiyo Tudjman, was called off by
the Croats.
Croatian Defense Minister
Martin Spegelj »aid at an emer
gency Cabinet meeting that mili
tary units had been seen moving
on the outskirts of Zagreb, Bel
grade radio said. Spegelj said his
defense forces and federal units
were on the "highest degree of
combat readiness.''
Croatian Premier Josip Mano
lic was quoted as saying, "In the
circumstances in which [Croatia]
is threatened with a military reso
lution of the Yugoslav crisis and in
which tank and other units are
being deployed in a manner sensi
tive for the security of the republic
of Croatia, it would be nonsense"
to hold talks with Serbia.
Milosevic met yesterday with
President Milan Kucan of Slove
nia, another republic that is seek
ing independence, the official Tan
jug news agency reported.
However, in a statement from
the Slovenian capital, Ljubljana,
Kucan said that there was an

essential difference between the
two leaderships over whether
"sovereignty of peoples or of
republics should be honored."
Many ethnic Serbs live in western
Croatia, and Serbia has talked of
expanding its borders if the coun
try's political configuration
changes.
The northern republics of
Croatia and Slovenia have sought
to transform the Yugoslav federa
tion of six republics and two
provinces into a confederation of
independent states.
But Serbia, the largest repub
lic, is ruled by the Socialist Party,
which favors a strong central gov
ernment and has opposed
reforms. Some officials in Slove
nia and Croatia claim the army is
in collusion with Serbia, but
senior military officers have
repeatedly denied the claim.
Militias in Slovenia and Croatia
defied a Monday deadline set by
the eight-member federal presi
dency to disband all "illegal
paramilitary groups." Federal
leaders have said they will not
send the army to attack, but they
have threatened measures against
people who illegally possess
weapons.
On Wednesday, the army again
ordered Croatia's militia to imme
diately demobilize, claiming they
were preparing terrorist attacks
on the central government's mili
tary.
