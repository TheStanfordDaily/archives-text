## Our state of health 
### 
AS THE AMERICAN PEO
PLE prepare for a long,
costly war in the Persian
Gulf, our thoughts turn away from
domestic problems. One of the
most pressing of these problems —
which receives too little attention
even in times of peace — is access
to health care.
Some students have kept this
issue very much in their thoughts
this month and this year. They are
the 125 volunteers who have been
organizing Saturday's You Can
Make a Difference Conference on
"Health and the Underserved."
Their efforts, which began back in
April and seem to have produced
impressive results, deserve our
applause.
The conference features an out
standing selection of speakers,
including New York City Commis
sioner of Health Woodrow Myers.

In workshops, panels and
speeches, these experts will con
template the national tragedy that
37 million Americans each year do
not receive adequate health care.
They need not be the only ones
to contemplate this problem, how
ever. People without medical
degrees can get involved and make
a difference in the area of health
care. One way to do so is simply
attending the conference and
learning more about the issues.
The You Can Make a Difference
organizers have served the com
munity well by compressing the
conference into a single day, as
opposed to the entire weekend of
past years.
Hopefully, the issues and ques
tions raised at the conference will
linger in our thoughts and compel
us to further action.
