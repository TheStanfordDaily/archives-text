# The 						war backlash

### 
THE OUTBREAK OF WAR in
the Middle East has been
accompanied by a backlash
against Arab-Americans and Mus
lims here at home, and this back
lash should be condemned with all
the vehemence that an attack
against any other racial group
would deserve.
Reports of FBI investigations
against Arab-Americans are dis
tressing, bringing back memories
of the detainment of Japanese-
Americans during World War 11.
Here at Stanford, fliers were
posted in Roble Hall and the Medi
cal School saying that Muslims
should "die in the desert."
The Stanford community must
be careful in differentiating the
actions of Saddam Hussein from
the actions of Muslims and Arabs
around the world.
Americans often equate Mus
lims, whether Sunnite or Shi'ite,

with terrorists bent on killing
innocent civilians. The number of
Muslims who engage in such activ
ity, or even agree with it, is
infinitesimal, and making the
automatic connection between
Muslims and terrorists only opens
the door to discrimination against
Arabs and Muslims.
Although Saddam may invoke
the name of Islam in the war by
calling a jihad against Americans,
he is a secular leader who calls on
Islam only out of desperation with
no religious authority whatsoever.
Muslims around the world are not
blind martyrs for Saddam and
should not be feared just because
they are Muslims.
As Israel is continually bom
barded by Iraqi missiles, we should
remember that, while Jews are a
primary victim, Arabs and Mus
lims have suffered far more from
Saddam's aggression.
