# War supporters gather in Plaza
## Peace activists outnumber them 
### Miranda Doyle Staff writer 
About 20 ralliers gathered yes
terday in White Plaza to support
President Bush's decision to go to
war with Iraq, but were outnum
bered by spectators and peace
activists who carried signs
protesting U.S. involvement in the
war.
In front of a crowd of more
than 100, speakers explained why
they support Bush's decision to go
to war and why they believe it is
essential that Americans support
the troops.
The College Republicans and
the Stanford branch of a national
organization called Students for
America, who organized the rally
together, played the national
anthem at the beginning and end
of the gathering. Many spectators
waved American flags.
The peace activists and specta
tors joined the pro-Bush ralliers
in applauding the soldiers in the
Persian Gulf The activists dis
played signs with slogans such as
"I hate the war but love the
troops" and "Support the soldiers
— bring them home."
Students for America chair
Mark Weber said he appreciated
the fact that the protesters did not
interfere with the rally. "I respect
their right to disagree, and I think
it is great that we can exchange
ideas," he said.
Eric Krock of the College
Republicans agreed. He told the
peace activists, "I am glad you are
giving us the same opportunity to
express our views at this rally the
same way we have let you express

yours over the past few weeks."
But speakers were also severely
critical of the demonstrations that
have taken place since the war
began. "The time to protest the
war was before it started," said
Jim Hunt, a freshman in the Air
Force Reserve Officer Training
Corps. "I think it is imperative for
our soldiers to know we love and
support them."
Senior Mark Lotspeich said
some of the protesters are object
ing to the war because they want
to avoid the draft. He added that
some of the demonstrators in San
Francisco attend protests because
they "just like to make trouble"
and do not care about the war.
In addition to speaking in sup
port of American troops, Krock
excoriated Iraqi President Sad
dam Hussein, comparing him to
Hitler. "We can stop [Saddam]
now or we can stop him later," he
said. "I think we should stop him
now."
Freshman Carla Winston, who
lined up with the peace activists,
disagreed. "Contrary to what was
said, I do not think the chance for
diplomacy ended at a certain
time," she said. "I do believe in
supporting the troops as people
without supporting the policy that
put them (in the Gulf).
According to senior Enrique
Origgi, a member of the College
Republicans, this position is
inconsistent. "I think implicit in
the anti-U.S. policy argument is a
lack of support for troops. It
implies that what hundreds of
thousands of American troops are
risking their lives for is at best
useless," he said.
