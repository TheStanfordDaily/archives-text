## Confucius sez: LSATs baby! 
### 
I'VE BEEN HAVING THE SAME con
versation with my family for 15 years.
It starts like this:
"You've grown since I last saw you."
I say, "Thanks," as if I'd been working
at it.
"So, when's the last time you got a
haircut?"
If I went to President's barber shop
the day before they'd still ask this. So I
give them the surprised-confused/embar
rassed-hurt look that Tom Hanks gave
Donna Dixon when she figured out he'd
spent 18 months in drag just to see her
naked, and quizzically reply:
"Why? Is it long? I just got one a week
ago.
Then they shove their face in mine,
like Niedermeyer in the Twisted Sister
video, and say, "So, what are you going to
do with your life?"
Usually, I contort my jaw into a con
templative, moronic, "Captain Kirk just
realized the Tribbles aren't going to make
such cute pets after all" expression, and
shrug — "I dunno."
But if the relative is particularly
annoying, senile or stupid, I look them in
the eye and say, "A Quantum Material
Applied Mathematical Research Coordi
nator, Specializing in Non-Euclidian
Geometry." Should they squint or show
any sign of formulating a somewhat intel
ligible question, I quickly add, "But right
now, I'm finishing up a flick with Tori
Wells and Hypatia Lee."
It's the other 10 percent I have to
worry about. That's because they send
the big birthday checks.
"You're not thinking about being a

doctor, huh?"
My family has basically resigned itself
to the fact that I'm not cut out for med
school. But they still hope.
My father has even developed an angle.
His peculiar line of Borgesesque logic
works like this: You like kids. Ergo, you'd
make a great pediatrician.
My father knows what pediatricians
do. Yet, when he talks to me, he works
himself into this Bill Bixby trance and
convinces himself that all they do is play
Zim-Zam with 7-year-olds. *
When this situation occurs, I gently
remind the relative that I'm not headed
for the medical profession.
Then they sigh. It's a sad kind of sigh
filled with pity and apologies for wasted
youth.
"So what kind of law are you thinking
about?"
And for years I've laugffed this off.
Then I thought about it: If I didn't do
something soon, I'd find myself in a small
room with 200 other kids as lost as me,
taking another three-hour test, only with
an 'L' in front of it.
What could I do with my life? The
question kept flashing in front of me like
that annoying red neon sign that shines
into the third floor suite in the Glass Slip
per Inn.
In my panic, I started to think irra
tionally. I could work for the president.
I'd save him from that Jimmy
Carter/Andrew Johnson disease. I drafted
a letter to the chief of staff and included
some of my ideas:
• Recall troops from Iraq, send New
Kids instead;

• Invent story about Bush being inner
city gang member, show fake scars;
• Institute Thursday Night White
House Nar-Bight Tradition;
• Host MTV "Drug Czar For A Day"
contest;
• Remind home viewers what happens
if Bush steps down.
Happy with my new career, I headed to
Chef Chu's. Finishing my meal, I shoved
an orange in my mouth, and, in celebra
tory glee, ran around pretending I was
Carl "The Truth" Williams. Then I
opened my fortune cookie.
© You would make a good lawyer.
Until then, my fortunes had never
really been fortunes at all.
But this one was real. I didn't want to
be a lawyer. But I don't have the guts to
put my quasi-literary skills on the line
and risk abject, or even semi-abject,
poverty.
I wasn't special. Like millions of Amer
icans, I'd find the most bearable job for
the most money. And for me, it looks like
that involves the LSATs.
Unless, of course, Sununu writes back.
