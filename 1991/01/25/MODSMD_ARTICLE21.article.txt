## U.S. has not fully considered risks, hypocrisy of Gulf war 
### 
The continuous stream of
absurdity which flooded through
my eyes and ears during the past
few days has left me filled with anger
and sadness. But I shouldn't be express
ing my emotions, since I just read in this
paper that it is not the right moment to
have war feelings.
Should we have started this war? To
tell you the truth, I don't know. But here
again, I am defaulting according to some
American standards. Only losers don't
know; the others already made their way
in management consulting. Well, accept
my apologies, I have been raised to
appreciate the value of nuances.
I do have, however, a few certitudes. I
know that we would never have dared to
attack the Soviets, even when they were
sending thousands into the gulags, even
when they invaded Afghanistan. The
price to pay was just too high. But still,
patience and carefully designed sanctions
have crippled the Eastern bloc. Today,
the Soviet tanks have left Kabul. I agree,
the context was different.
War is sometimes compared to chess. I
have my doubts about the soundness of
this analogy. Grandmasters plan their
moves 30 steps ahead of time. Our lead
ers look more like amateurs at this
game. I know that I would never have
started a war leaving so many questions
unanswered.
What will happen if Israel is dragged
into the conflict? What will we do if the

Iraqis set all the Kuwaiti oil fields on
fire? Have we assessed the risks? Is it
worth taking them?
I know that while the world is united
behind the international coalition,
200,000 people marched last Thursday
in Paris against the war. About the same
number marched in Italy a week ago.
If, as it was repeatedly said, we cannot
let Saddam Hussein retain his military
power, why did we fill our wallets build
ing it in the first place? Don't we, don't
you, have enough imagination to find
other means of expanding our
economies? N
The weapon merchants will make
.money replacing the bombs dropped on
Baghdad, and they will make even more
profits when the time will come to
replace Iraq's arsenal — if not tomorrow,
in five years from now. Their swimming
pools are filled with blood.
I would not have started a war before
writing during the last five months
international regulations preventing this
cycle to continue. A 13th U.N. resolution
— who would have noticed?
Above all, I would never have waited
two days after the first bombs were
dropped to warn my friends that this
war might be long and difficult. It would
have been an insult to their intellect.
Gone also the memories of the
Panama invasion, in which a good dozen
of international laws were violated, and
sovereign embassies were searched to

remove from power someone that the
United States installed a few years ear
lier. How convenient, indeed.
To those who think that a war can be
a success, let me tell them that it never
is. It is the worst treatment to dyslexia,
whereby pen strokes are replaced forever
with holes in human flesh.
I believe, though, that certain causes
are worth fighting for. I would have
struggled to avoid living in a Nazi world.
Maybe I would or should have tried to
oppose Saddam Hussein, not just now,

but nine years ago when my father was
relentlessly telling me that Iran was
wrongly singled out as the big evil, that
the French were selling nuclear capabili
ties to a man using biological weapons on
civilians.
And today, if it is really our values
which are at stake in the Gulf, as our
leaders told us, then perhaps, and per
haps only, they are not all worth fighting
for.
