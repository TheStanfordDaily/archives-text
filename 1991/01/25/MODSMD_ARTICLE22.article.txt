# Both sides of debate on Gulf war are morally justifiable
## 
### 
I am trying to answer the question
which you posed in your Jan. 14 edito
rial: "How is it that the Senate in autho
rizing the use of force in the Gulf did so

by a vote of only 52 to 47?"
The issue was not "war or peace," it
was "war or appeasement," and essen
tially "justice or advantage." And it is an
issue of "right or wrong" or "good and
evil," but this did not make the decision
easier because we like to think that what
is "good" is also "good for us," but unfor
tunately we, and our distinguished Con
gressmen, are not quite sure what is
just, right, good, and even what is truly

advantageous and expedient.
The votes in Congress do not reflect
different concepts of right and wrong or
of advantageous and disadvantageous,
but they indicate the inability to decide
which is which. A good deal can be said
and has been said for and against every
reasonable position which has been
stated and taken, and the votes show
this clearly.
The same applies to President Bush,

who is in the unenviable position of hav
ing to make a decision even if he is
divided in his own mind like the
Congress. It would be easy if we knew
what is truly just and advantageous, but
inasmuch as we don't, please have com
passion with those who are forced to
make decisions.
