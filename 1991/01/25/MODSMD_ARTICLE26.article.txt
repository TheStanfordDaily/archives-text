# The 						Bug gets on the beat
## Why are radio stations split between K's and W's?

Dear Bug,
Why are radio stations split
between K- and W- stations by the
Mississippi River? What about
stations north of the Mississippi?
— Dazed Zappers
Dear Residents of Zap,
Once upon a time, all radio sta
tions had call letters beginning
with a K. However, around the
time of the Depression, when
things were getting rather scarce,
someone pointed out that the
country might run out of call let
ters.
Thus the "W" was introduced
for radio stations east of the Mis
sissippi. Under a similar statute,
call letters were also required to
have four letters.
I now hear the residents of
Pennsylvania clamoring, "What
about KDKA in Pittsburgh and
KYW in Philadelphia?" Well,
smart-alecky Pennsylvanians,
shut up. I am just getting to the
exception to the rule.
KDKA and KYW were allowed
to retain their letters because they
were created long before the call
letter regulation laws were
effected. KDKA, in fact, is the old
est station in the country, started
circa 1921. (Yes, Russian history
buffs — that is indeed only four
years after the Great Russian
Revolution! Coincidence or Bol
shevik machination? You decide!)
There is yet more to this fasci
nating saga. Four-letter call let
ters beginning with K could have
supplied the entire country — the

W was not truly necessary.
However, after all of the good
call letters had been exhausted,
stations would have been stuck
taking names like M KORN"
(which may, in fact, be a highly
desirable station name in lowa
but would not go over well in the
eastern portion of the country).

There are many other undesir
able titles that begin with the K
or KN-sound that can't be listed
here, but that you and your
naughty friends can think up
when you're not busy with CIV
homework.
The W opened up the possibil
ity for exciting new names, like
"WART-FM," and falls a mere two
letters short of allowing for the
ecclesiastically pleasing "WIM
PLE-FM." (For those of you who
haven't yet researched a career as
a nun, a wimple is an austere head
covering that leaves only the face
exposed.)
The "W east of the Mississippi"
rule has drawn one California rap
station to the East coast. WRAJJ
they decided, had a much better
ring to it and better concealed the
nature of their music, than did
KRAP

However, after all of
the good call letters
had been exhausted,
stations would have
been stuck taking
names like 'KORN'
(which may, in fact,
be a highly desirable
station name in lowa
but would not go over
well elsewhere).

In Canada, a small country
which lies north of the Missis
sippi, stations call letters begin
with a "C."
An "X" heads all the call letters
of the stations in Mexico. Now I
can imagine the Southern Califor
nians among you complaining,
"Bug Dude, you're so screwed up.
My raystay (radio station) at
home begins with an 'X.'"
Yes, this is true, Oh Lame One,
because some Southern Califor
nian stations have their transmit
ters licensed in Mexico. Hence the
"X."
