# Tips on keeping sane during your next ski trip

Yes, it's that time again, when we all pack
up our bags, load up our cars and head for the
hills. That's right — it looks as if they're going
to reinstate the draft.
No, seriously. It's Ski Trip season, that
happy time of year when we all pay vast sums
of money to strap our feet to weighted strips of
fiberglass and throw ourselves headlong down
icy slopes.
But despite the huge fun factor involved, no
one ever seems to want to organize the damn
thing. Well, here's my step-by-step, foolproof
method of pulling off a successful ski trip with
a death rate of less than 5 percent.
The first thing you have to do is decide
where to ski. One way to do this is to call up
the slopes, where you will probably be told that
the conditions are "excellent."
Of course, being the ski-wise person that
you are, you will immediately realize that
"excellent" refers to large stretches of bare
mountain where it is necessary to remove your
skis and portage over the rocks.
The next big step is to decide where to stay.
Many of my friends opt for the budget-ori
ented "car in the parking lot," but for larger
trips, it's usually a good idea to get a condo. As
a rule, you want to try to allot 12 square feet of
carpet per person, and at least one bathroom
for every 50 people.
Location is also important, as you want to
get a central location near the slopes, the casi
nos and a professional orthopedic surgeon.

All you have to do is gather together a few basic necessi
ties: food, toilet paper, chains, whips, Mutual of Omaha Life
Insurance and Patriot missiles (Oh my God, she's a SCUD!).

Then, after finding drivers and piling every
body into cars, trunks and Tupperware con
tainers, it's finally time to leave. The trick
here is to give everyone faulty directions so
you can get there first and snag a bed.
If the beds are already gone, I recommend
closets, as it decreases the odds that someone
will step on your face.
At last, it's time to ski. Here you want to
split the group up into the 4 different kinds of
skiers:
• Studs: The people who know exactly what
they're doing and make everyone else look like
complete fools.
• Statues: Those who are so afraid of
speeds over two miles an hour that they
remain in a permanent crouched snowplow
position for up to several days after they have
gone back home.
• Psychos: The ones who can't ski but
don't care. They zoom down the double-dia
mond runs, unable to turn, reaching speeds
comparable to Gorbachev's Bay Area tour,
until they finally crash into some poor unwit

ting soul at the bottom of the hill, whore they
lie in the snow, unable to get up, but still able
to take out other skiers by thrashing about
with their poles.
• Stiffs: People who stay in the lodge.
At this point, having already waited in line
for rentals, lift tickets and the ski lift itself,
everyone should have time for at least 20 min
utes of skiing before lunch.
So when everyone makes it back to the bot
tom of the hill, the average ski-trip group has
to wait in yet another line for food that would
be distinguishable as either pizza or a cheese
burger were it not for the crunchy purple
things growing on the bottom.
After lunch, there should be time to get in
at least one more run, during which you can
try out various ski-oriented games, such as
"Tag," "Catch the Runaway Ski," and "Unin
tentional Body Surfing."
Finally, after a fun day of skiing, when
everyone has made it back to the condo, fought
over the three gallons of hot shower water and
eaten the traditional spaghetti dinner, you can
relax in the knowledge of a job well done.
That is, assuming those guys at the hospital
were only kidding about being run over by
Marlin Perkins on a snowmobile.
