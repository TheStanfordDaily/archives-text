## Controversial call, last-second shot lift Wildcats 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
The Curse of Maples Pavilion
roared back to life late last night,
as the Stanford men's basketball
team fought No. 5 Arizona to a 76-
76 standoff for 39 minutes and 28
seconds.
With 32 seconds to go, The
Curse had given Stanford a
chance to send the Wildcats away
from Maples with a loss for the
sixth time in the last seven years.
The Cardinal had the ball. The
Cardinal had all the time in the
world to get off the winning shot.

Wildcats 78
Cardinal 76

And then, in the space of those
last 32 agonizing seconds, The
Curse struck the wrong team.
Three pivotal plays in those
last 32 seconds turned a tie game
into a Stanford loss, as a referee's
call, a puddle of sweat (yes, a pud
dle) and an offensive interference
call combined to give Arizona a
78-76 win.
It was the fifth tight game in a
row for the Wildcats, who remain
tied for first in the Pacific 10 Con
ference at 5-1 (16-2 overall). Stan
ford falls to 3-4 (10-7).
"We executed very well at the
end," said Arizona coach Lute
Olson, whose team was down 76-
72 with two minutes to go. "We've
been in so many close games we've
learned to maintain our compo
sure."
Not to take anything away
from the Wildcats' performance,
but they got quite a bit of help in
the last 32 seconds of the game. A
spectacular, diving Andrew Vla
hov steal had given the Cardinal
the ball with the score tied at 76,
and point guard John Patrick
patiently dribbled across half
court to set up one final shot.
As he approached the top of the
key, Patrick turned to his right,
stuck out his left arm to protect

the ball as he bumped into Ari
zona's Matt Othick.... and heard
a whistle blow a good 20 feet
behind him.
Charging. Arizona ball.
The call — made by referee
Rich Ballesteros — was either
heinous or just confusing, depend
ing on your point of view.
"I like to see the kids decide the
game," Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery said. "That's a no
call at best. It's a crime."
"I had my arm out to protect
the ball, and I did bump into him,
but I wasn't going anywhere,"
Patrick said. "I sure wasn't
expecting a charge call."
Who was? "I don't know,"

Olson shrugged afterward. "I'm
beyond the point of understand
ing. There were a lot of calls I
didn't understand."
(In The Daily's usual interest
of being completely, painfully
objective, the author will make no
comment whatsoever on the abso

lute, total stupidity of Ballesteros'
call.)
The Wildcats called timeout to
set up a winning shot and, after
play resumed, Othick dribbled
around at the top of the key, run
ning time off the clock. With 12
seconds left, it began: Othick
passed to Sean Rooks, got the ball
back, and then passed to Chris
Mills (who would finish with 18
points) on the left side.
The play was set up for Mills to
take the winning shot, but he
couldn't shake Deshon Wingate.
Mills looked inside, saw Adam
Keefe guarding Rooks, and
decided to take his chances with a
play closer to the hoop. Mills

passed to Rooks. . .. and Xeefe fell
to the floor.
A puddle of sweat. "I was mov
ing to go around Sean — there
was no contact," Keefe said. "I put
all my weight on one foot and I hit
a puddle. He didn't touch me."
"I set a pick, rolled and saw
Chris with the ball," Rooks said.
"I didn't see what happened to
Adam — I thought he might have
tripped."
With Keefe on the floor, Rooks
had a wide-open shot from eight
feet away. The ball kissed off the
glass, hit the inside edge of the
rim, and fell through.


Ken Beer — Daily
Adam Keefe steals the ball from Arizona center Sean Rooks. Unfortunately for Keefe and the Cardinal and most of the 7,500 fans in Maples
Pavilion last night, the Wildcats overcame a 76-72 deficit with two minutes remaining, and a shot by Rooks with one second remaining gave
the visitors a 78-76 victory.
One second to go.
The Cardinal called timeout
and set up a play of its own. Vla
hov got the ball out of bounds,
tossed it down the floor, and
watched as the fun began.
Kenny Hicks leapt high to
catch the pass out beyond the
three-point line, landed, turned
and heaved up one final shot. The
ball floated toward the hoop as the
buzzer sounded — just the right
amount of distance, maybe off to
the left a little. . . .
The Miracle of Maples III?
No one will ever know if Hicks'
shot would have been good — "It
had a chance," Hicks said, but sev
eral other players thought it was
off-line — because Wingate came
in from the left corner, grabbed
the ball and stuffed it through the

hoop.
Unfortunately for Stanford,
Wingate touched the ball while it
was still in the cylinder above the
hoop. Offensive interference. And,
even if it hadn't been interference,
Wingate touched the ball well
after the buzzer sounded.
A second too late. Maybe.
"I thought it had a chance to go
in," Hicks said. "Deshon just got a
little overzealous."
Even with the three bad breaks
in the final seconds, the fact
remains that the Cardinal was up
76-72 with just over two minutes
to go, and couldn't get the job
done after that. Three times down
the floor, Stanford didn't even get
a shot near the hoop, as a
turnover, a blocked shot and the
charging call gave Arizona the
chance to win.
"We were intense and showed a
lot of emotion," Montgomery said,
"(but) we didn't play in the last
two minutes the way we need to

play to beat a team of that cal
iber."
For the first 38 minutes, how
ever, the Cardinal did play the
way it needed to to win. Stanford
outrebounded the Wildcats by a
whopping 44-23 margin, and the
dominance on the boards — plus a
23-for-28 performance at the line
— kept Stanford in the game even
while it shot a measly 40 percent
from the floor.
Keefe alone had 15 points at
the line (and 29 total, to lead both
teams) as he spent most of the
evening keeping Rooks and Ed
Stokes in foul trouble. Keefe had
13 boards, Vlanov added 10 and
Wingate had eight as the front
line kept Stanford in the game.
Patrick also kept the Cardinal
close, as he made all three of his
second-half three-point attempts.
The last came with five minutes
left, knotted the score at 70, and

set the stage for the insanity of
the last two minutes.
"It's extremely disappointing
to play this well and this hard and
not get a win," Montgomery said.
"I can't ask them to play any bet
ter."
