# ASSU teaching award adopted
## 
### David Bianco Editorial staff 
The ASSU Senate voted last
night to institute an award for
excellence in teaching voted on by
the student body to be presented
each spring.
The award was proposed by
senators Dan Levi, a junior, and
Ryan O'Hara, a senior, who said it
would enable students to recog
nize faculty members that
affected them.
"We really think that this is a
simple thing that the ASSU can
do to have a tremendous impact
on the say that students have
toward the administration about
which teachers have had a posi
tive impact on them," Levi said.
According to the bill proposed
by Levi and O'Hara, students will
be asked during next spring's elec
tion which two Stanford faculty
members "have made outstanding
contributions to your education
through teaching."
In order to ensure that teach
ers in smaller classes are given
fair consideration, students will
be asked to include a teacher from
a class of under 30 students and
another from a class of more than
30 students.
The eight undergraduate
teachers who receive the highest
number of votes will receive
plaques, along with a message of
congratulations published as an
advertisement in The Daily.
Because of an amendment pro
posed by graduate senator Doug
Bone, the bill was expanded to
include six graduate teachers as
well.
The senate allocated nearly
$700 from its discretionary fund
to the award, and several student
leaders said they hoped it would
be included in next year's regular
budget as an ongoing award.
The senate also voted on two
bills related to the gay, lesbian and
bisexual communities. They
passed a bill condemning the
recurring defacement of George
Segal's "Gay Liberation" statue
on an undivided voice vote.
Then, on what graduate sena
tor Diane Nelson called "the other
gay bill," the senate voted to sup

port the present domestic part
ners policy, which extends mar
ried student benefits, including
housing, to domestic partners of
unmarried same-sex and opposite
sex couples.
Issues concerning complaints
about the University's phone sys
tem arose twice during last meet
ings, as the senate passed bills
supporting three students who
are appearing before the Califor
nia Public Utilities Commission
asking that Stanford "be declared
either a shared tenant service
provider of telephone service or a
local telephone utility." It also
allocated $200 of its discretionary
fund to help those students' pay
their expenses in fighting the Uni
versity phone system.
In other business, the senate
authorized the ASSU Speakers

Bureau to spend $3,000 to bring
Sarah Weddington, the lawyer
who defended "Jane Roe's" right
to an abortion in the Supreme
Court case Roe v. Wade, to speak
in the spring.
Also, ASSU Elections Commis
sioner Raul Lopez, a graduate stu
dent, gave the senate notice of
three amendments to the ASSU
Bylaws he planned to propose at
the next senate meeting Feb. 5.
These included a limitation on
campaign flyers to 500 per candi
date or slate and a ban on adver
tising "public information meet
ings" for political parties during
spring quarter.
Also, the senate unanimously
elected sophomore Beth Morgan
to fill the term of deputy senate
chair vacated by sophomore
George McKinney.
