# ASSU teaching award adopted

### David Bianco Editorial staff 
The ASSU Senate voted last
night to institute an award for
excellence in teaching voted on by
the student body to be presented
each spring.
The award was proposed by
senators Dan Levi, a junior, and
Ryan O'Hara, a senior, who said it
would enable students to recog
nize faculty members that
affected them.
"We really think that this is a
simple thing that the ASSU can
do to have a tremendous impact
on the say that students have
toward the administration about
which teachers have had a posi
tive impact on them," Levi said.
According to the bill proposed
by Levi and O'Hara, students will
be asked during next spring's elec
tion which two Stanford faculty
members "have made outstanding
contributions to your education
through teaching."
In order to ensure that teach
ers in smaller classes are given
fair consideration, students will
be asked to include a teacher from
a class of under 30 students and
another from a class of more than
30 students.
The eight undergraduate
teachers who receive the highest
number of votes will receive
plaques, along with a message of
congratulations published as an
advertisement in The Daily.
