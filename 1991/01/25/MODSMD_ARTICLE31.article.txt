# Arizona keeps cool in the end
## 
### Robert Pardington Senior staff writer 
The Arizona and Stanford bas
ketball teams played in a fifth
gear of intensity and emotion
through most of the ball game last
night. The Wildcats were able to
prevail in the end by throttling
down and hitting some clutch
shots to pull it out by two points.
All involved knew this was
going to be a tight game. Even the
pre-game warm-ups were full of
tension. Stanford students were
overflowing into two extra rows
on the Maples Pavilion floor.
The lead changed hands
repeatedly in the first half, with
Stanford coming out with a 40-40
tie despite shooting only 36 per
cent. It took a shot with one sec
ond to play to allow Arizona the
victory although Stanford shot
only 41 percent for the game. The
special ingredient was elbow
grease.
"If we played with that emotion
and intensity every game, I'd take
my chances with this team all
through the season," Stanford
coach Mike Montgomery said.
"This game had just tremen
dous intensity," Arizona coach
Lute Olson said. "People just
refused to lose. You feel very for
tunate to come out with the win in
a game like this."
Stanford was beating the taller
Wildcats on the boards all game,
and players were lunging for
steals and diving for loose balls
like madmen.
"Everybody had an intense
desire to win tonight," senior for
ward Andrew Vlahov said. "But I
think that's also part of the
game."
"It was definitely an intense
game," center Adam Keefe said. "I
try not to get caught up in the
highs and lows, but it was defi
nitely intense."
But even with all of the deter
mination, the Cardinal just
couldn't do some of the simple
things it had to do to close out the
game. Stanford's shooting, in par
ticular, suffered because of poor
decision making and a few hasty
triggers.
"We panic shot a little bit,"
Montgomery said. "We weren't as
patient as we need to be."
"We did take some bad shots,"
guard John Patrick said. "I took
some shots that I wasn't advised
to take."
"If we had made the plays we
had to at the end, we would have
won," sophomore guard Kenny
Hicks observed.
Olson admitted to getting out
hustled by Stanford, especially by
the Cardinal big men, on the
boards and, personal fouls.
"They do a great job of ham
mering it inside and getting the
fouls," he said.

But Olson saw his team win
down the stretch with some
clutch, controlled play. As Stan
ford panicked, Arizona kept its
cool.
"I didn't think we showed any
signs of panic," Olson said, "I
thought we executed well down
the stretch. We've been in so many
close ones that we've had to retain
composure."
"It's pretty bitter," Keefe said.
"We played hard, and that's one of
the worst things about it."
If it's possible to play too hard,
the Cardinal may have done just
that last night. Even on the last
shot by Hicks, Deshon Wingate
jumped up and tipped it in before
the ball had cleared the cylinder,
resulting in an offensive basket
interference call.
"I thought it had a chance to go
in," Hicks said. "Deshon was just
overzealous."
The loss was an unfortunate
one, but the game shows that
Stanford still has the ability to
play close with one of the top
squads in the country.
"We knew it would be a close
game," Patrick said. "We knew we
could play at their level."
