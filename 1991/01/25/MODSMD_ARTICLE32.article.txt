# Volleyball takes on BYU in Provo
## 
### Kevin Jeffery Staff writer 
After this weekend, the Cardi
nal men's volleyball team can look
forward to six consecutive games
against teams ranked no less than
ninth in the country. Okay, that's
a tall order, but at least this week
end they'll be playing some sec
ond-division patsy, right?
Wrong.
Second division maybe, but the
Brigham Young Cougars, who
Stanford will face in two road
matches this weekend, are the
only team besides top-ranked
USC to defeat Stanford this sea
son. The game was only a three
set tournament match, however,
and thus does not count on either
team's record.
The Cougars' 0-3 overall record
entering tonight's action is pri
marily a testament to the quality
of competition both teams will
face this in year in Western Inter
collegiate Volleyball Association
play.
The Cardinal comes into Provo,

Utah with a 2-0 overall record and
1-0 mark in WIVA play. Long
Beach State and San Diego State
are currently tied with Stanford
for the early Wilson division lead.
BYU's victory over Stanford
came by the score of 11-15, 15-7,
and 16-14 at the season-opening
UC-Santa Barbara Tournament.
Stanford went on to finish second
to USC, while the Cougars took
12th.
Tonight's game will be a WIVA
match, and will mark Stanford's
first game on an opponent's home
floor, and that has coach Ruben
Nieves concerned. "They've
already beaten us on a neutral
court, so we know that on their
home court they'll be especially
capable of playing us tough," he
said.
Saturday afternoon's game will
not count in WIVA standings, as
the teams are in separate divi
sions of the league and can offi
cially play each other only once.
Early in the season, the Cardi
nal offensive attack is being led by
senior middle blocker Mike Lowe,
and junior outside hitters Dave
Go as and Duncan Blackman.
Goss is leading the team after
two matches with 31 kills for a
.365 hitting percentage. Lowe has

14 kills and claims a team-best
.550 hitting percentage, while
Blackman stands at 14 kills for
.128. Freshman setter Canyon
Ceman has posted an impressive
12.2 assists per game average.
Brigham Young thus far has
relied on the powerful net game of
outside hitters Steve Hieta and
Scott Waddell, and middle blocker
Shawn Patchell. In the Cougars'
last two matches those three have
amassed 29, 28 and 14 kills,

respectively.
The most important thing for
the Cardinal to guard against in
Provo this weekend is looking past
Brigham Young to upcoming
games against powerhouses
Hawaii, Pepperdine, and Long
Beach State.
Considering the Cougars have
already downed Stanford earlier
this season, the desire for revenge
should remedy that problem.
