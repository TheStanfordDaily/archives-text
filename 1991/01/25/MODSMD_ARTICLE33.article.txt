Remember the good old days? You know,
when gas was $1.09 a gallon, you'd never
heard of a Scud missile, and the Stanford
women's basketball team seemingly won
every game by 30 points?

| Cardinal 94
Lady Cats 65

It was not so long ago, but times change
quickly, as some recent Cardinal scores indi
cate. Facing a brutally tough schedule and
an improved conference, the defending
national champions are three-time losers
this season and have had to squeak out sev
eral close wins.
All that changed Thursday night, as the
Cardinal took a trip down memory lane and
once again completely annihilated a confer
ence opponent. The Arizona Lady Cats were
hopelessly outmatched from the start and
fell to Stanford, 94-65.
Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer appreci
ated the change of pace. "This was a good
night to play a lot of people, to develop some

depth," she said. "It was helpful to be able to
rest Sorya Henning and Trisha Stevens."
The easy win, Stanford's seventh
straight, may be a sign that the defending
national champions are slowly returning to
last year's form. The Cardinal improved to
13-3 on the season, while Arizona fell to 5-
14.
Although Stanford won its seventh
Pacific 10 Conference game without a loss,
seldom has a victory come so easily this year.
Three of the Cardinal's last four conference
wins have come by eight points or less.
This was one, however, that was over
early. The Cardinal turned out the lights
with a 32-1 skein that turned a 9-6 game
with 17:10 left to a 41-7 laugher 10 minutes
later. Stanford held its biggest lead of the
game, 41 points, with seven seconds left in
the half. The 62 first half points were the
most ever for the Cardinal in the first 20
minutes of a game, eclipsing the old mark by
five points.
M ln the first half we ran the ball really
well," VanDerveer said. "Sor\ja really pushed
the ball up the court."
Henning paced the assault with 13 of her
eventual 19 points, while reserve forward
Chris MacMurdo dominated the boards with
seven at the half. MacMurdo, who led all
players with 26 minutes of playing time,

yanked down nine more in the second half to
finish with the absurd total of 16 rebounds.
It was the highest rebounding output by a
Cardinal in five years, since Katy Steeling
had 16 her freshman year.
"I was especially pleased with Chris Mac-
Murdo, Angela Taylor, and Kelly
Dougherty," VanDerveer said. "I was
extremely pleased with Chris's rebounding."
Stanford as a team had 60 rebounds, a
season high, while Arizona managed just 44.
The Cardinal outrebounded an opponent for
just the fifth time in 16 games — they have
won all five. Stanford also had 20 steals,
seven more than the previous season-high.
Leading 62-23, VanDerveer let up on the
Cats and played her entire bench the major
ity of the second half. No starter played more
than 23 minutes, and Stevens was limited to
just 11 minutes of time. Freshman forward
Kelly Dougherty sparkled along with Mac-
Murdo, playing 21 minutes.
Still, the 32 points and 27.5 percent
shooting that Stanford produced in the lat
ter half of the game left something to be
desired. The Cardinal also made just 5-of-26
from the three-point line, tying a record for
attempts set in the NCAA final last year
against Auburn.
"The only thing I was disap
pointed in tonight was our lack of
concentration in the second half,"
VanDerveer said.
Leading Cardinal scorer Julie
Zeilstra led all players with 22
points on incredible 9-of-10 shoot
ing, adding eight rebounds as
well. MacMurdo added 10 points
to go with her 16 boards, and
Dougherty also contributed a
career-high nine points.
Card notes
The Cardinal have now won 14
straight Pac-10 games. .. .
Stevens, who was shutout in the
first half, had her low output of
the year with four points. ... It
was MacMurdo's first double
double of her career. . . . Ann
Adkins, who recently returned to
the team after redshirting last
year and then sitting with a frac
tured tibia, played seven minutes
and missed her only shot, a three

pointer.... In the only other Pac
-10 game last night, Arizona State
beat California, 84-77.
