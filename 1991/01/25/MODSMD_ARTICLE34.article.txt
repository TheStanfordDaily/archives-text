# Women begin campaign for sixth consecutive crown
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
As winners of five NCAA titles
in a row, it might be a bit unrea
sonable to ask the Stanford
women's tennis team to top their
achievements. So who said we
were reasonable?
For starters, how about a sixth
straight national crown by way of
a third-straight undefeated sea
son. While that would be an
unprecedented achievement in
and of itself, it would carry with it
two noteworthy marks for the his
tory books.
First of all, a perfect '91
campaign would give the Cardinal
a 92-match winning streak, four
more than the 88-straight that
John Wooden's basketball teams
won at UCLA.
Secondly, the Cardinal is host
ing the NCAA Championship this
season and next. No host school
has ever won the title.
The latest edition of the Ne
Plus Ultra Netters can already
take pride in the fact that they
return three NCAA individual
champions — a college tennis
first. The last two singles titlists,
senior Sandra Birch ('B9) and
junior Debbie Graham C9O). are

joined by doubles champ Teri
Whitlinger atop a lineup that once
again promises to give opponents
nightmares.
Following closely behind are
steady sophomore Heather Wil
lens, hard-hitting Kylie Johnson
and Laxmi Poruri, who promises
to be the latest in a long list of
Stanford freshman sensations.
While the exact lineup posi
tions won't be determined until
next week — the team is still play
ing its challenge matches — it
seems likely that most any order
ing of the players would result in a
No. 1 team.
The Volvo Tennis/Collegiate

rankings agree and have tabbed
the Cardinal as preseason
favorites to win it all. So why is
Coach Frank Brennan worried?
Because that's exactly what he
gets paid for. "I have a healthy
dose of paranoia," Brennan said.
But not so much that he doesn't
give his squad a better-than-aver
age shot. "We're definitely not as
strong as last year.
"[But] are we still strong
enough to win it? I think so."
Stanford will get a good indica
tion during the regular season
when it faces what Brennan calls
"our toughest schedule of all
time." Aside from the typical tilts
with Pacific 10 Conference foes,
the Cardinal will receive visits
from two of the Southeastern
Conference's top squads: Georgia
and Florida.
If someone other than Stanford
were to win the NCAA title, the
smart money would be on the
Lady Gators or UCLA, with the
Bulldogs looming as a not-so
darkhorse.
Stanford's ability to withstand
the challenge is based on how well
the team can recover from the
