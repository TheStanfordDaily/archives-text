# Stanford batsmen start off season against Santa Clara
## 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
There are always questions on
opening day, but for Stanford
baseball coach Mark Marquess,
the queries have parameters of
greatness.
Stanford returns six starters in
the field from a 1990 team that set
a Stanford record with 59 wins
and was ranked No. 1 most of the
year. After winning the Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division
and the NCAA West I Regional,
the Cardinal eventually lost to
surging Georgia in the College
World Series and finished third,
but the team was probably Stan
ford's best ever.
Today, a "rebuilt" team opens
the 1991 season intent on a return
trip to Omaha, and there is no
question the Cardinal has enough
talent to get there again. Stanford
takes on Santa Clara in a two
game swing to open the season,
with senior John Reid taking the
Sunken Diamond hill today at 2
p.m. to get the season underway.

Stanford starts the year ranked
either No. 1 or No. 3, depending
on what baseball poll you believe.
And if you consider how much tal
ent Stanford lost to graduation,
the legendaiy team of 1990 starts
to take on King Kong proportions.
If Stanford is supposedly No. 1
now, it's hard to figure how they
ever lost a game last year.
Pitchers Mike Mussina and
Stan Spencer — the best one-two
combination in college baseball a
year ago — have moved on to the
professional ranks, leaving a Sat
urn-sized crater to fill in the Stan
ford rotation. Spencer was a first
team All-American with a school
record 145 strikeouts, while
Mussina was MVP of the West
Regional. Combined, they won 28
games and threw 290 innings.
And the offensive losses are
daunting as well. Outfielder Paul
Carey, the Pac-10's all-time lead
ing home run hitter, has gradu
ated to wooden bats in the pro
ranks, along with third baseman
Tim Griffin, who blasted 21
round-trippers last year.

Troy Paulsen, a three-year
starter at second base and a gritty
.340 hitter, was also drafted and is
working his way to the major
leagues.
Stanford loses 42 home runs
and 184 runs batted when you
combine the 1990 statistics of
Carey, Griffin and Paulsen. Look
ing at what the team lost, the pre
season No. 1 ranking is a tremen
dous compliment to the recruiting
ability of Marquess and his staff.
Marquess doesn't pay too much
attention to the No. 1 ranking,
believing conference rival Arizona
State — ranked No. 1 by Baseball
America — should be the favorite.
"Anybody that knows baseball
could tell you that," said Mar
quess. "I think we have talent, but
it all depends on pitching and how
we develop."
"The big question is our pitch
ing," continued Marquess. "You
just can't replace all that
(Mussina and Spencer)."
Marquess and pitching coach
Tom Dunton will be tinkering
with a young staff of many strong

arms, looking for three
workhorses to carry Stanford
through the Six-Pac season and
into the playoffs.
"The early start forces you to
use a lot of pitchers," Marquess
said. "Sometimes you might lose a
game, but that gives you eight or
nine guys you can look at."
Reid, 7-1 with a 3.03 earned
run average last year, matured as
a starter in the late season, post
ing critical wins in the regional
and World Series.
Burly sophomore Brian Sackin
sky (10-1, 5.09 ERA) is slated for
the second spot, but is currently
sidelined with a sore elbow. Senior
Scott Weiss (6-2, 3.54 ERA, 7
saves), who has shifted between
start and relief work, may return
to a starter's role to replace Sack
insky.
Marquess, who is setting a 70-
pitch limit per game for each
pitcher at the beginning of the
year, said sophomore Jamie
Sepeda (3-0, 4.73) and 6-foot-7
freshman Willie Adams are
expected to throw this weekend

and are in the hunt for the third
slot.
Sophomores John Lynch, Greg
Mix and Tim Moore could also
contend, along with juniors Steve
Worrell and Aaron Dorlarque,
who are both coming off injuries.
In the field, the questions don't
seem so critical. "The cupboard is
not bare offensively and defen
sively," Marquess said. "We're
really pretty set with our position
players, and that's nice; it gives us
some stability."
Senior Chris Kemper, who only
had two at-bats last year, gets the
initial nod at second base over
freshman Matt Bokemeier, while
junior outfielder David Cornell, a
transfer from Santa Clara, will
start at designated hitter and will
be the fourth outfielder.
Junior David Holbrook (.258, 3
HR, 43 RBI), a frequent desig
nated hitter last year, will usually
start at third base, but will miss
opening day with a sprained ankle
and hamstring pull. The rest of
the lineup returns from last year's
59-12 team.

Steve Solomon (.272, 1 HR, 10
RBI) will lead off and play right
field, followed by junior shortstop
Roger Burnett (.270, 8 HR, 43
RBI). Slugging first baseman
David McCarty (.336, 12 HR, 69
RBI) will bat third, with last
year's NCAA Freshman of the
Year, center fielder Jeffrey Ham
monds (.355, 7 HR, 44 RBI, 48
SB) behind him.
Marquess's biggest lineup
change is moving Hammonds, a
Rickey Henderson-type threat,
down in the lineup and Solomon
to the top of the order. Hammonds
has been hampered by a sore
knee, but is expected to start
today.
"We'll try something a little bit
different," Marquess said. "Ham
monds is strong, and he's got a lot
more power."
"Solomon doesn't have Ham
monds' speed by any stretch of the
imagination, but he can steal a
base. We'll just pick and choose
our situations," continued Mar
quess.

Marquess's biggest lineup
change is moving Hammonds, a
Rickey Henderson-type threat,
down in the lineup and Solomon
to the top of the order. Hammonds
has been hampered by a sore
knee, but is expected to start
today.
"We'll try something a little bit
different," Marquess said. "Ham
monds is strong, and he's got a lot
more power."
"Solomon doesn't have Ham
monds' speed by any stretch of the
imagination, but he can steal a
base. We'll just pick and choose
our situations," continued Mar
quess.
There are always questions on
opening day, but for Stanford
baseball coach Mark Marquess,
the queries have parameters of
greatness.
Stanford returns six starters in
the field from a 1990 team that set
a Stanford record with 59 wins
and was ranked No. 1 most of the
year. After winning the Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division
and the NCAA West I Regional,
the Cardinal eventually lost to
surging Georgia in the College
World Series and finished third,
but the team was probably Stan
ford's best ever.
Today, a "rebuilt" team opens
the 1991 season intent on a return
trip to Omaha, and there is no
question the Cardinal has enough
talent to get there again. Stanford
takes on Santa Clara in a two
game swing to open the season,
with senior John Reid taking the
Sunken Diamond hill today at 2
p.m. to get the season underway.

Stanford starts the year ranked
either No. 1 or No. 3, depending
on what baseball poll you believe.
And if you consider how much tal
ent Stanford lost to graduation,
the legendaiy team of 1990 starts
to take on King Kong proportions.
If Stanford is supposedly No. 1
now, it's hard to figure how they
ever lost a game last year.
Pitchers Mike Mussina and
Stan Spencer — the best one-two
combination in college baseball a
year ago — have moved on to the
professional ranks, leaving a Sat
urn-sized crater to fill in the Stan
ford rotation. Spencer was a first
team All-American with a school
record 145 strikeouts, while
Mussina was MVP of the West
Regional. Combined, they won 28
games and threw 290 innings.
And the offensive losses are
daunting as well. Outfielder Paul
Carey, the Pac-10's all-time lead
ing home run hitter, has gradu
ated to wooden bats in the pro
ranks, along with third baseman
Tim Griffin, who blasted 21
round-trippers last year.

Troy Paulsen, a three-year
starter at second base and a gritty
.340 hitter, was also drafted and is
working his way to the major
leagues.
Stanford loses 42 home runs
and 184 runs batted when you
combine the 1990 statistics of
Carey, Griffin and Paulsen. Look
ing at what the team lost, the pre
season No. 1 ranking is a tremen
dous compliment to the recruiting
ability of Marquess and his staff.
Marquess doesn't pay too much
attention to the No. 1 ranking,
believing conference rival Arizona
State — ranked No. 1 by Baseball
America — should be the favorite.
"Anybody that knows baseball
could tell you that," said Mar
quess. "I think we have talent, but
it all depends on pitching and how
we develop."
"The big question is our pitch
ing," continued Marquess. "You
just can't replace all that
(Mussina and Spencer)."
Marquess and pitching coach
Tom Dunton will be tinkering
with a young staff of many strong

arms, looking for three
workhorses to carry Stanford
through the Six-Pac season and
into the playoffs.
"The early start forces you to
use a lot of pitchers," Marquess
said. "Sometimes you might lose a
game, but that gives you eight or
nine guys you can look at."
Reid, 7-1 with a 3.03 earned
run average last year, matured as
a starter in the late season, post
ing critical wins in the regional
and World Series.
Burly sophomore Brian Sackin
sky (10-1, 5.09 ERA) is slated for
the second spot, but is currently
sidelined with a sore elbow. Senior
Scott Weiss (6-2, 3.54 ERA, 7
saves), who has shifted between
start and relief work, may return
to a starter's role to replace Sack
insky.
Marquess, who is setting a 70-
pitch limit per game for each
pitcher at the beginning of the
year, said sophomore Jamie
Sepeda (3-0, 4.73) and 6-foot-7
freshman Willie Adams are
expected to throw this weekend

and are in the hunt for the third
slot.
Sophomores John Lynch, Greg
Mix and Tim Moore could also
contend, along with juniors Steve
Worrell and Aaron Dorlarque,
who are both coming off injuries.
In the field, the questions don't
seem so critical. "The cupboard is
not bare offensively and defen
sively," Marquess said. "We're
really pretty set with our position
players, and that's nice; it gives us
some stability."
Senior Chris Kemper, who only
had two at-bats last year, gets the
initial nod at second base over
freshman Matt Bokemeier, while
junior outfielder David Cornell, a
transfer from Santa Clara, will
start at designated hitter and will
be the fourth outfielder.
Junior David Holbrook (.258, 3
HR, 43 RBI), a frequent desig
nated hitter last year, will usually
start at third base, but will miss
opening day with a sprained ankle
and hamstring pull. The rest of
the lineup returns from last year's
59-12 team.

Steve Solomon (.272, 1 HR, 10
RBI) will lead off and play right
field, followed by junior shortstop
Roger Burnett (.270, 8 HR, 43
RBI). Slugging first baseman
David McCarty (.336, 12 HR, 69
RBI) will bat third, with last
year's NCAA Freshman of the
Year, center fielder Jeffrey Ham
monds (.355, 7 HR, 44 RBI, 48
SB) behind him.
Marquess's biggest lineup
change is moving Hammonds, a
Rickey Henderson-type threat,
down in the lineup and Solomon
to the top of the order. Hammonds
has been hampered by a sore
knee, but is expected to start
