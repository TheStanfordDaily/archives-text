# Grapplers face Humboldt tonight, then go to All-Cals

After registering impressive
performances in its last two dual
meets, Stanford wrestling seeks to
continue its return to prominence
this weekend. Tonight at 7:30
§.m., the team faces Humboldt
tate, and on Saturday, the Cardi
nal competes in the 16-club All-
California Invitational in San
Francisco.
According to coach Chris Hor
pel, the team should win tonight's
match. "I'd say that we are
favored in about five events, while
thqy have the edge in three", he
said. "If they wrestle well, and we
suffer some kind of letdown, it
could be a tough match. Other
wise, I expect no problems."
Right now, Stanford is looking
as strong as it has at any point in
the season. Last week, the team
tied a nationally-ranked Fresno
State team, 17-17. Over this past
weekend, eight wrestlers were vic
torious in Stanford's 38-7 blowout
victory over UC-Davis.
The return of several top
starters has been crucial to the
club's recent surge, and All-Amer

ican Steve Buddie has led the
charge. The 167-pounder, who
struggled with elbow problems
early in this year's campaign, has
had no problems since his return,
recording a technical fall win
against the Bulldogs, and a fall at
Davis.
The senior, 17-2-0 on the sea
son, is currently ranked sixth in
the nation. Although he received
six stitches above his eye on
Thursday for a gash suffered in
practice, Buddie said he was at
"100 percent strength" for the
weekend's matches. He is a
favorite in the All-Cal Tourney
and should have no problems
against Humboldt's Mike Halket.
Co-Captain Steve Yarbrough, a
177-pounder, has had an out
standing season. The senior leads
Stanford in victories with 22 and
is also favored in the All-Cal.
Yarbrough is ranked sixth in the
country.
Other wrestlers who should
perform well in both events
include 126-pounder Jay Jackson
(10-9-0 on the year), 134-pounder
Lance Johnson (10-5-0), 142-
pounder James Dinette (10-9-0),
and 190-pounder Mark Graham

American Steve
Buddie has led the
charge.

(9-4-0).
The Lumbeijacks, a traditional
Stanford wrestling rival, are led
by heavyweight Luke Parkham
and 158-pounder Lonyx Landry.
Parkham placed seventh in the
44-team Las Vegas Invitational
and should give Cardinal fresh
man Scott Whitt a battle. Landry
beat Stanford junior Matt
Topham two out of the three
times the pair faced in 1989-90
and is a slight favorite tonight.
Other Humboldt stars include
Andrew Koponen at 126 and
Royce Raker at 134.
Tonight's match is at Burnham
Pavilion. Tomorrow's action will
go on all day at San Francisco
State.
