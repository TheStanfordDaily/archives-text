# New journal builds bridges
## After 18-month wait, Montage is released 
### Janine DeFao Editorial staff 
Montage, the first collaborative Soviet-Ameri
can student publication, was released last night
after 18 months of planning, anticipation, frus
tration and long-distance telephone calls.
The journal's premier issue, published at Stan
ford in Russian and English, is a compilation of
student writing and art representing a broad
range of perspectives, but focusing on the theme
"The Origins of Identity."
From "classism" at American universities to
military education at Russian ones, from African-
American cultural heritage to Lithuanian iden
tity, from intellectual freedom to sexual liberty,
the magazine attempts to bridge the cultural gaps
and misunderstandings both between the two

countries and within them.
Montage is not only the first student publica
tion to be distributed in both the Soviet Union
and the United States, but it is also the first stu
dent-run journal to be distributed nationally in
either country.
The editorial staffs in both countries worked
independently to solicit work from students
throughout their countries. The final result
includes contributors from Yale and Howard Uni
versities, the Universities of Pennsylvania and
Nebraska, the Moscow State Pedalogical Institute
and the All-State Institute of Cinematography in
Moscow, among others.
The American and Soviet counterparts began
communicating through phone, fax and electronic
