# New journal builds bridges
## After 18-month wait, Montage is released 
### Janine DeFao Editorial staff 
Montage, the first collaborative Soviet-Ameri
can student publication, was released last night
after 18 months of planning, anticipation, frus
tration and long-distance telephone calls.
The journal's premier issue, published at Stan
ford in Russian and English, is a compilation of
student writing and art representing a broad
range of perspectives, but focusing on the theme
"The Origins of Identity."
From "classism" at American universities to
military education at Russian ones, from African-
American cultural heritage to Lithuanian iden
tity, from intellectual freedom to sexual liberty,
the magazine attempts to bridge the cultural gaps
and misunderstandings both between the two

countries and within them.
Montage is not only the first student publica
tion to be distributed in both the Soviet Union
and the United States, but it is also the first stu
dent-run journal to be distributed nationally in
either country.
The editorial staffs in both countries worked
independently to solicit work from students
throughout their countries. The final result
includes contributors from Yale and Howard Uni
versities, the Universities of Pennsylvania and
Nebraska, the Moscow State Pedalogical Institute
and the All-State Institute of Cinematography in
Moscow, among others.
The American and Soviet counterparts began
communicating through phone, fax and electronic

mail long before they had even
met. The Soviets sent their con
tributions to Stanford, where
1990 graduate Eric Jones, man
aging editor and art director, and
Publisher Susan McKean, a
senior, worked on design and pub
lication of the magazine.
"It was not so difficult to be in
contact across the ocean," said
Soviet editor Andrei Voskresen
skii, regardless of $500-a-month
phone bills.
Where the problems did occur,
Jones said, was in raising funds
for a yet non-existent journal.
"All the art and photos were
done this summer. All the prob
lems were with money," he said.
"We were ready to go, but the
design and layout were pushed
back. There was a window of time
when we just raised money, or
tried to raise money."
Needing $20,000 to publish,
Montage was offered a $5,000
Challenge Grant from the Walter
and Elise Haas Fund if they could
raise the other $15,000. With that
accomplished, the magazine
started to near reality. The jour
nal was able to obtain non-profit
status under the auspices of the
ASSU.
The layout was done in six
weeks at the ASSU Type and
Design Shop, and the magazine
was printed in Michigan.
The initial goal of printing
40,000 copies was scaled back to
10,000, half to be distributed in
each country.

The American and
Soviet counterparts
began communicat
ing through phone.

"We decided it was better to
print 10,000 than to hold out
longer and do 40,000 because it
might never happen," Jones said.
The magazine will be distributed
in Moscow, Leningrad and Siberia
and throughout the United States
in bookstores at and around uni
versities.
Editors hope to publish bian
nually and aim for the end of this
academic year for the next issue.
Voskresenskii will stay on as
Soviet editor and Jones will
replace 1989 Stanford graduate
Mark Weiner as U.S. editor.
Other Stanford students
involved include translation edi
tor Heidi Hillis, a graduate stu
dent in Slavic Languages and lit
erature, and distribution man
ager Carolina Katz, a senior.
Watercolors by Irene Staple
ford, a 1990 graduate, and pho
tography by Ron Brignac, a sec
ond-year master's candidate in
photography and fine arts, are
published in Montage. Several
translators are also Stanford stu
dents.

A graphic and story in yester

band. The correct spelling is The
Virginia Sigh.
