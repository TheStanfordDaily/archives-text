# Swimmers try luck in desert

After defeating the nation's seventh-ranked team
222-78 two weeks ago, it would seem that the Stan
ford women's swim team has little room for improve
ment. But going into a pair of meets in the state of
Arizona this weekend, the team expects nothing but
that.
"I think the team's been swimming really well Lin
practicel," senior Barb Metz said. "Arizona will be
the place to prove that with fast times."
Stanford will swim against Arizona State in
Tempe this afternoon and then travel south to meet
Arizona in Tucson tomorrow at noon. The team is
off to a 3-0 start this season and is ranked second
nationally. The Wildcats are ranked 16th, and the
Sun Devils are 17th.
"The team really gelled together over Christmas
training," Metz said. "Our team seems closer than
last year's, and that says a lot because our team was
really close last year."
Coming off of that training period, Stanford ham
mered UC-Santa Barbara and then beat No. 7 Michi
gan handily two weeks ago at deGuerre Pool. And
Stanford will be even stronger this weekend.
The Cardinal competed in those first two meets
without the services of coach Richard Quick, sopho
more Janet Evans and freshman Summer Sanders.
Those three were representing their country at the

World Championships, but are back now.
The two swimmers combined to win three gold
medals, two silvers and a bronze against the best the
planet has to offer and will obviously improve the
strength of the Cardinal greatly. Quick led the U.S.
team to the overall title and has won six NCAA titles
in the past seven years.
But despite the absence of two stars and their
coach, the Cardinal fared quite while under asst.
coach Mike Chasson. "Mike did a really good job over
Christmas when Richard was gone," Metz said. "He
did a good job of having us do what we needed. We
didn't do as much distance work but did more speed
work instead, and I think it helped."
With that speed work the Cardinal swimmers will
be gunning for NCAA qualifying times as well as a
pair of victories this weekend. So far senior Michelle
Griglione, sophomore Janel Jorgensen and fresh
man Pam Minthorn have qualified for the NCAA
meet. Evans and Sanders also posted acceptable
times at the worlds meet while swimming metric dis
tances instead of yards.
A team can take up to 18 swimmers to the NCAA
Championships, and Stanford will need to reach that
limit to have a shot at beating top-ranked Texas, the
defending NCAA champs. But while it won't be easy,
beating the Lady Longhorns in March is certainly
possible.
"I think it's definitely within our reach," Metz
said. "Each person has to swim well."
