# Gymnasts await Wisconsin
## 
### Noah Blake Staff writer 
You've heard the cliche
"absence makes the heart grow
fonder"; for Stanford's men's
gymnastics team it couldn't be
more true.
For the first time since the
middle of last season, Tim Ryan,
former U.S. national champion,
will compete for the Cardinal in
their meet against Wisconsin
this weekend, held on Saturday
at 1 p.m. in Burnham Pavilion.
Ryan, who was sidelined with a
wrist injury since last spring,
will anchor the squad as it
drives toward the NCAA Cham
pionships in April.
Head Coach Sadao Hamada
is bringing Ryan back carefully
at first. "He cannot go all out in
all six events yet, but he will be
back for a few events [on Satur
day]."
That's not to say that the
team will struggle until Ryan is

once again competing in the all
around: "After the two competi
tions [this season], we are
already scoring a lot higher than
last year," said Hamada.
Hamada looks for the team to
continue raising its scores as the
season progresses. "In gymnas
tics competition, you've got to
have difficult skills and perform
flawlessly and consistently to
get high scores. But this time of
the year, you still have to
develop difficult routines, which
is what we are doing, but that
means in the competition you
don't have enough consistency.
Next week we're going to be
concentrating on consistency."
In attempting to attain this
consistency, the Cardinal will
spend much of next week prac
ticing its two weakest events,
the rings and the vault. "We are
very strong on every event right
now, except we still have to work
on the rings and vaulting. Those

two events are a little bit weak
right now, and they're coming
along ... but it's very hard to
get high scores on [theml.
In the other four events,
however, the team should excel.
"In the floor exercise, pommel
horse, parallel bars and high
bar, we've got the guys who can
[score] almost perfect 10.0's, as
good as you see in gymnastic
competitions like the Olympics.
"I feel very good about the
team this year, because we've
got great depth finally, and some
of the guys are very, very out
standing."
Not the least of whom is Tim
Ryan, who looks forward to the
opportunity to once again com
pete for Stanford: "It was disap
pointing to go halfway through
the season last year, and then be
left behind to just watch the
team. So I'm pretty happy to be
helping to support the team
score."
