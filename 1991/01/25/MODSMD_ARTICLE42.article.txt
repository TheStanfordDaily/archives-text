# 'We wake up over the same problems at night'
## 
### Janine DeFao Editorial staff 
Although separated over time and distance,
Andrei Voskresenskii and Eric Jones have
made an incredible connection — not through
electronic mail and fax machines, but through
a shared vision and a common goal.
"We've spent only two weeks (together), but
it's more like a hundred million days," said
Montage managing editor and art director
Jones of the Soviet editor and himself. "We
wake up over the same problems late at
night."
The two men have worked together for over
a year on the first Soviet-American student
journal. They met last December when Jones
and the American staff went to Moscow for the
magazine's first joint editorial meeting. Now,
the Soviet staff is visiting Stanford.
"I knew after three days in Moscow that
this was the person to work with," Jones said.
Both editors see Montage as a way to
increase understanding between people of the
United States and the Soviet Union.
"The function of Montage, I believe, is
enlightenment, distinguished from educa
tion," Voskresenskii said through Jones'
translation. "For instance, we can't write
about what's happening at each moment with
student protesters in Lithuania, because it will
show up three months later. But what we can
do is talk to each other about more important

questions, talk about each other, and learn to
understand each other in more personal, vis
ceral ways."
This exchange will help people realize that
individuals make up nations, Voskresenskii
continued. "For instance, in the Persian Gulf,
people bombing from the air are not bombing
people, but ants. If a person knows about who
they are hitting — their lives, cultures, aspira
tions — maybe he won't push the button."
Jones agreed that more and better commu
nication is a benefit of Montage. But "what I
would say, for me, is the most important func
tion we have is to set an example — for the free
press in the Soviet Union, to the Soviet gov
ernment — of a quality publication in a coun
try where there is no tradition for such,... to
encourage a marketplace for opinions, that
exchange of opinions that keeps people from
killing each other in Persian Gulf wars, that
prevents disastrous summits and Baltic crack
downs.
"As idealistic as it sounds, I think this is
where to start," he said.
Voskresenskii said he has never seen a pub
lication like Montage — a 122-page, full-color
magazine — in the Soviet Union. For that rea
son, and because there is a great interest in the
United States, the Soviet editor said he
believes there will be a very positive reaction to
Montage.
Because there was no independent press in

the Soviet Union until five years ago, indepen
dent publications are still a novelty. Since
Montage was not published under the auspices
of any state organizations, Voskresenskii said
he had no problems with censorship or even
any review at all.
"The problem is not between that which is
prohibited and that which is allowed," he said.
"The problem is the level of quality."
While Montage will introduce many Soviets
to the United States, Voskresenskii is receiv
ing his introduction now on his first trip to the
country.
"I have a lot of impressions already about
Stanford University, Stanford campus, Stan
ford libraries," said Voskresenskii, who was
wearing a Cub Scouts cap friends had brought
him as a souvenir from the United States.
"I was surprised to see there is such an eco
logical culture. I was surprised to see squirrels.
There are no squirrels in Moscow or in the
suburbs of Moscow," he said.
Voskresenskii also explained his surprise
that "people smile all the time. Even dogs
smile in this country. The only people who
don't smile are police and border guards."
Soviets do not smile often because "people
in the Soviet Union are hungry now," he said.
One of the most "amazing" things Voskre
senskii said he has seen are the "tight-knit"
communities of University co-ops.
"You are more communist than we are," he
exclaimed.
