# Infirmary closing has changed little

### Kevin Roth 
The closing of Cowell Stu
dent Health Center's overnight
infirmary due to budget cuts
has affected very few students
so far and changed little in
terms of student health care,
according to Gene Phillips,
Cowell director of primary care
services.
Until last June, Cowell oper
ated a 24-hour infirmary where
students could spend a few
nights if needed. When the
University decided last spring
to cut Cowell's budget by
nearly $200,000 for the 1990-
91 school year, the infirmary's
days were numbered.
"It was a very difficult deci
sion to close it," Phillips said.
"But in terms of dollars, there
was no other program that
could be cut to keep the infir
mary open."
The infirmary, formerly
located on the second floor of
Cowell, provided three primary
functions: overnight care for
students not sick enough for
the hospital yet not quite ready
to return home, emergency
care and telephone advice.
Yet with an average of only
1.7 students coming in each
night and a $130,000 per year
cost of operation, the infirmary
was deemed expendable.
Students who show up at
Cowell between 11 p.m. and 7
a.m., unaware that the infir
mary has closed, will find a
telephone connected to the
operator at the Palo Alto Medi
cal Clinic. They can also call
the operator directly from their
room.
A doctor on call is then con
tacted for advice. According to
John Dorman, Cowell's direc

tor of public relations and out
reach, if the students "still
need care after we've talked to
them, they go to the emergency
room [at Stanford Hospital]."
"We see the hospital as part
of our system," according to
Cowell Director Harvey Wein
stein. "They have done an
excellent job."
"Potentially," said Dorman,
"you can argue that there are
some cases where students'
care will be delayed because
they're thinking, 'If I go to the
emergency room, and I haven't
satisfied my deductible, I'm
going to have to pay for this out
of my pocket... so I'll tough it
out and wait until Cowell is
open again.'"
So far, however, this does
not seem to have been the case.
Phillips said there have been
an average of one to two calls a
night which end up directed to
the emergency room. This
number essentially equals the
1.7 who used to show up at
Cowell during the overnight
period.
Some students are not satis
fied with the closing of the
infirmary.
Marcus Grode, a graduate
student in scientific computing
and computational mathemat
ics, entered Cowell one Sunday
afternoon last quarter with
back pains.
When closing time came,
Grode said the nurse told him
he would have to go home. But
when she tried moving him
into a wheelchair, he
"screamed with pain" and was
sent to the hospital instead.
Of course, Weinstein noted,
it has only been several months
since the infirmary's closing.
"We will have a better sense by
the spring quarter," he said.
