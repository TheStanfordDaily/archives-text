# Better options available for disabled, activists say

David Rivlin was paralyzed
from the neck down and unable to
breathe on his own as a result of a
surfing accident and subsequent
surgery.
Facing the prospect of spending
his days in nursing homes, Rivlin
decided to end his life by shutting
off his ventilator.
Rivlin did not have to die,
according to disabled rights
activists who will address "The
Right to Die: Access to Care and
the Quality of Life" this Saturday
at the You Can Make a Difference
Conference on campus.
With attendant services — aid
in personal and household tasks
— Rivlin and others like him
could have independence and ful
fillment away from the nursing
homes, as shown by disabled peo
ple who have received such ser
vices.

History
Prof. Paul
Longmore
has been
active in what
is called the
independent
living move
ment. Long
more himself

is paralyzed in both arms from
polio and has a severe spinal cur
vature as a result of unforeseen
surgical complications. He hires a
live-in attendant who helps him
bathe, dress and move about.
Longmore said that in the mid
-19705, when state legislation was
passed that provided funds for
attendant services, "tens of thou
sands of people with disabilities,
who were just scraping by rather
than taking aid to enter the nurs
ing homes, came out of the wood
work." He said the overall costs to

provide aid for disabled people
may go up if more people enter the
system.
A recent article in The Disabil
ity Rag, a disabled-rights advocacy
journal, said that funding needed
for such services would be less
than the cost of placing disabled
people in nursing homes.
However, Longmore said,
"Even if it's not cheaper, we still
have to factor people's lives into
this. We need to consider their
rights to equal access to the com
munity, the right not to be kept in
institutions."
"When people are supported in
this way, they can eventually do
productive work and thus con
tribute to society," he added.
"The celebrated recent cases of
disabled people expressing a
desire to be terminated actually
represented profound cries for
help of individuals that an unfeel
ing bureaucracy had turned
away," according to Count Gibson,
professor of Health Research and
Policy.
While many agree that termi
nally ill patients should have the
right to die, the situation is not
the same for the disabled.
Terminally ill patients pose a

special problem for doctors who
must decide whether to let them
live or die. "People are not obli
gated to use every possible means
of maintaining their lives and
physicians may certainly partici
pate in the foregoing of life-sus
taining equipment," Gibson said.
Yet, doctors must be careful
when making this decision. "Peo
ple will always be tempted under
certain circumstances to end their
own lives," he said. "This is in a
majority of cases a very temporary
temptation."
Longmore said a distinction
needs to be made between termi
nally ill patients and people with
mtyor disabilities. "Non-disabled
people imagine that it must be
really horrible to be disabled with
out realizing how much of the
problem is social," he said. "It's
important that we don't minimize
the hurt and the pain, but the
social oppression is far more
important."
As a minority group, disabled
people are just starting to orga
nize for their rights, he said, and
the discrimination against them is
formidable. The Disability Rag
article said 66 percent of disabled
people were unemployed in 1980.
Longmore said that number has
since increased to over 70 percent.
Longmore himself had to battle
for years to get money from the

itation to pay his graduate school
tuition. The department initially
would not pay for his doctoral
study, even though he was eligible.
They told him, "You have a mas
ter's, isn't that enough?"
When he received his doctorate
in history, Longmore was still
asked by college hiring commit
tees whether he would be able to
teach and do research even
though he had to do these things
in order to get his degree.
Now that disabled people are
organizing themselves, there is
hope for greater autonomy, Long
more said. Society teaches the dis
abled to "stay away from other
disabled people if you want to
avoid the stigma," he added. But,
Longmore said, as a new genera
tion of disabled people pursues
political activism, there is a grow
ing sense of community.
During a presentation celebrat
ing Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s
birthday, a group of disabled stu
dents made a statement of solidar
ity. For Longmore, this presenta
tion reflected "a new way of look
ing at ourselves."
