# Student seeks 'sanctuary' designation for Stanford
## 
### Cecilia Tom Editorial staff 
Ever since hostilities began in
the Persian Gulf, the specter of a
draft has been haunting male stu
dents on campus. To alleviate
their anxiety, sophomore Patrick
Dote is trying to make Stanford
declare itself a sanctuary.
Dote stressed that such a decla
ration is a political statement and
is "not about running away from
the draft." He proposed that Stan
ford "not expend any University
resources'* to assist the U.S. mili
tary in gathering Selective Service
status or related information of
students and other affiliates.
Dote is basing his proposal on
San Francisco, which was recently

declared a sanctuary by its city
council. As a result of the council's
action, city police will not partici
pate in finding draft dodgers.
Police Chief Marvin Herring
ton said he is not sure about the
legal ramifications of declaring
Stanford a sanctuary as his
department's authority comes
from the Santa Clara County
sheriff office.
"At this point, we are responsi
ble for upholding all state, federal
and local laws," he said.
Sergeant Kahn from the sher
iff's office said it will "depend on
circumstances" whether the sher
iff decides to honor a declaration
of sanctuary. He said he needs
more information before the crite
ria for the decision could be
defined.
Dote said Stanford has political
responsibilities and should make a
commitment to peace in the Gulf.
He explained that neutrality "is
not a good idea and even impossi
ble" because people will inevitably
look to the University for guid
ance.
He said the Persian Gulf War is
"very much framed in terms of
racism" — for example, Arab-
Americans are being investigated
by the FBI — which is in contra
diction to the ideals of the Univer
sity. "Education always implies
negotiation" and not coercion, he
added.
University President Donald
Kennedy said he personally does
not support the idea of making
Stanford a sanctuary, adding that
he sees "no foreseeable possibili
ties of a draft."
He said that the University as
an academic institution should
not take a position on the Gulf
war or the issue of whether people
should avoid their civic responsi
bilities.
Dote said he is looking to the
ASSU for help because a draft

would involve half the campus
and is therefore definitely a cam
pus issue. He added, however, that
he is "philosophically in agree
ment" with the ASSU discussing
non-Stanford issues, even if he
disagrees with them.
Dote presented his proposal,
through graduate senator Diane
Nelson, before the ASSU Senate
last night. Debate on the bill will
take place at the next ASSU meet
ing.
Although the group Stanford
Students for Peace in the Middle
East is not directly involved with
Dote's effort, it is helping him cir
culate his petition, he said. The
petition urges an immediate dec
laration of sanctuary because
"safety, peace, choice and opposi
tion to a draft are supported from
the outset."
Churches traditionally have
been seen as sanctuaries for peo
ple evading religious or state per
secutions. According to Robert
Brown from the First Presbyte
rian Church in Palo Alto, his
church has been a sanctuary since
the Vietnam days, offering help
and counsel for conscientious
objectors.
The United Campus Christian
Ministry, headquartered in the
Old Union Clubhouse, declared on
Jan. 5 that the churches it repre
sents are now sanctuaries. The
ministry includes 10 churches of

four denominations.
The ministry's Board at Direc
tors made the decision shortly
before the war so that the
churches can help potential con
scientious objectors think
through their options and respon
sibilities, according to Campus
Minister Byron Bland.
Bland said the ministry will
also help objectors to specific wars
make up thdir minds about the
Gulf war.
Bland stressed that the min
istry does not encourage anyone
to leave the military or otherwise
violate military duties. He added
that if someone plans to desert the
military permanently, "the church
is not a good place to come"
because it ultimately cannot pro
vide legal protection for the peo
ple.
He said the church will at some
point advise military personnel
who are conscientious objectors to
return to their units and pay the
costs of not performing their
duties.
Bland said the ministry has
worked with Stanford senior
Aim£e Allison, a reservist who
tried to declare conscientious
objector status. Although Allison
has a contract with the military,
Bland maintained that she has the
right to change her mind
"She didn't sign herself into
slavery," Bland said.
