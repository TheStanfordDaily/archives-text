# Athletes to miss Shrine game
## Injuries, protective agents keep players away 
### Rakesh Khanna Staff writer 
Sometimes college football is a lot like the pros —
injuries and intrigue add unpredictability and grief
to the biggest games.
The East-West Shrine Game, college football's
fundraising version of the Pro Bowl, is no exception.
Some of the biggest names scheduled to play in
Saturday's game at the Stanford Stadium will be
sidelined because of injuries and other reasons.
The list of injured athletes includes six collegiate
All-Americans: Virginia quarterback Shawn Moore,
defensive backs Bernard Ellison from University of
Nevada at Reno and Jesse Campbell of North Car
olina State, defensive linemen Moe Gardner of Illi
nois and Kenny Walker of Nebraska.
While some players are recovering from injuries
they suffered during the regular season, others have
been injured while competing in various other post
season games.
Both team's coaches were forced to furiously
search for players to fill the rosters, although the
East team has been hit the hardest. According to
Shrine Game spokesman Gary Cavalli, 14 of the 37
East team players who were planning to participate
will not be playing Saturday.
And in a few cases, replacements are being
replaced because they too have been injured. Darrell

Beaver of Morehouse State was so excited to replace
a player out with the mumps that he pulled a groin
muscle while dashing through the airport to catch
his flight.
Some cynics, however, blame weaker teams not on
injuries but on agents' protectiveness and post-sea
son burnout. The game is being played a week later
this year because of the extended National Football
League playoffs.
Although game organizers did this so the match
wouldn't compete for viewers with professional play
offs, this has turned players away because they don't
want to risk injury before professional tryouts in
mid-February.
"I would have to be naive to think that agents did
not coerce a few players not to participate," Cavalli
said.
Injuries have even plagued the coaching staff. The
West's head coach Bill McCartney of Colorado suf
fered a back injury and has been replaced by Lavelle
Edwards of Brigham Young University. Although the
East's head coach Don Nehlen of West Virginia suf
fers from a strained neck, he will be coaching tomor
row.
Despite all of these injuries, 80,000 spectators are
expected to pack the stadium on Saturday to watch
74 of the nation's top players compete in their last
collegiate all-star game. The game has not been
blacked out locally and will be televised on ESPN
beginning at 1 p.m.
