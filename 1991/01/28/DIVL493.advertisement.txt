Psychological Reactions to the Persian Gulf War
Dear Students,
The war in the Persian Gulf is an uneasy reality. Opinions about its legitimacy differ among
individuals and campus communities, but the event is igniting inner turmoil and distress
ful states in the minds of most, if not all, of us.
It is natural to feel unsettled in the face of such a powerful reality. Diminished powers of
concentration, reduced desire to study, sense of horror, strong anxieties, physical tension,
anger and sadness are among emotional states appropriate at this time. Other responses
include disbelief that the war is happening, sense of confusion and helplessness, and a
tendency to spend many hours watching the news on television. There is a need to know.
The staff of Counseling and Psychological Services encourages you to express your
emotions, to cry if you feel the urge, to witness your state of mind, to talk to others about
your experiences and to be as sensitive to others reactions and emotions as you can
We want you to know that CAPS has established daily drop in groups for you and others
who want an opportunity to talk about your feelings and reactions regarding the Persian
Gulf war.
The CAPS Gulf Crisis Drop in Groups are available Monday thru Friday from 4:00 - 5:00
P.M. on the second floor of Cowell.
In addition, we want the partners of students who have been called to active military duty
to know that in this time of extraordinary circumstances we will extend crisis counseling
services to them without fee.
Sincerely,
The Staff of Counseling and Psychological Services.
