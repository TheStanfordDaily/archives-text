# Planes hit oil source; Iraqi fliers reach Iran

D HAH RAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) — From far
flung desert bases, allied bombers took wing
today on the 13th day of their stinging air
offensive. But the success of one crucial mis
sion — to stem the world's worst oil spill —
remained to be seen.
International teams were arriving in Saudi
Arabia today to assess damage from the spill,
which U.S. officials said was unleashed by Iraqi
occupation forces in Kuwait.
Over the weekend, U.S. warplanes blew up
the pipeline pinpointed as the source of the
giant slick, estimated at 300 million gallons,
more than 35 miles long and 10 miles wide.
Allied officials, meanwhile, cast a wary eye
toward officially neutral Iran, where increas
ing numbers of Iraqi aircraft have been seeking
refuge.
Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander
of coalition forces in the gulf, said yesterday
that 39 Iraqi aircraft have flown to Iran since
the war began — 23 of them in the previous 24
hours.
Iran has said it would confiscate the planes
for the duration of the war, but U.S. officials
said they had to consider the possibility that
the move was a ploy to shield Iraq's air force,
still largely unscathed by allied bombing.
"We would be absolutely not worth our salt
as military people if we ignored the fact that
those planes could fly back out of Iran after
us," Schwarzkopf told reporters yesterday.
Before dawn today, Saudi time, American
soldiers in sand-strewn camps and on ships in
the hazy Persian Gulf huddled around radios
and televisions for a Super Bowl memorable for
more than the play on the field.
Clad in protective gear, gas masks at the
ready, troops quaffed non-alcoholic beer —
alcohol is illegal in Saudi Arabia — and won
dered whether they would make it home for
next year's matchup.
"It feels weird to be watching this here,"
