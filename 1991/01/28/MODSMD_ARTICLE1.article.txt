# Planes hit oil source; Iraqi fliers reach Iran
## 
### 
D HAH RAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) — From far
flung desert bases, allied bombers took wing
today on the 13th day of their stinging air
offensive. But the success of one crucial mis
sion — to stem the world's worst oil spill —
remained to be seen.
International teams were arriving in Saudi
Arabia today to assess damage from the spill,
which U.S. officials said was unleashed by Iraqi
occupation forces in Kuwait.
Over the weekend, U.S. warplanes blew up
the pipeline pinpointed as the source of the
giant slick, estimated at 300 million gallons,
more than 35 miles long and 10 miles wide.
Allied officials, meanwhile, cast a wary eye
toward officially neutral Iran, where increas
ing numbers of Iraqi aircraft have been seeking
refuge.
Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander
of coalition forces in the gulf, said yesterday
that 39 Iraqi aircraft have flown to Iran since
the war began — 23 of them in the previous 24
hours.
Iran has said it would confiscate the planes
for the duration of the war, but U.S. officials
said they had to consider the possibility that
the move was a ploy to shield Iraq's air force,
still largely unscathed by allied bombing.
"We would be absolutely not worth our salt
as military people if we ignored the fact that
those planes could fly back out of Iran after
us," Schwarzkopf told reporters yesterday.
Before dawn today, Saudi time, American
soldiers in sand-strewn camps and on ships in
the hazy Persian Gulf huddled around radios
and televisions for a Super Bowl memorable for
more than the play on the field.
Clad in protective gear, gas masks at the
ready, troops quaffed non-alcoholic beer —
alcohol is illegal in Saudi Arabia — and won
dered whether they would make it home for
next year's matchup.
"It feels weird to be watching this here,"
said Sgt. Kevin Duclos, 26, a Buffalo Bills fan

from Rochester, N.Y., now part of
Operation Desert Storm in Saudi
Arabia. "I thought I'd be home
having chicken wings and real
beer."
The National Football League
championship, in which the New
York Giants beat the Bills 20-19,
was broadcast live by Armed
Forces Radio and Television Ser
vices.
The troops — along with mil
lions of citizens in Saudi Arabia
and Israel — had a rare respite
from the Iraqi missiles that have
rained from the sky almost
nightly. No missile launches were
reported last night or this morn
ing.
Since the war began, Iraq has
hurled a total of 51 modified Scud
missiles — 26 at Saudi Arabia and
25 at Israel, the allies said.
Mobile Scud missile launchers
have been a principal target of the
coalition bombers, who again took
advantage of clear skies today to
press relentless air strikes. Before
dawn, dozens of F-15s roared into
the skies, their afterburners send
ing streaks of multicolored flames
through the darkened sky.
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
said that although allied air
attacks against Iraq have been
successful, they alone will not
drive Iraq from Kuwait.
"We've always assumed that
we would eventually have to send
in ground forces," Cheney said
yesterday on NBC's "Meet the
Press." U.S. soldiers will be pre

pared "before the end of Febru
ary" to launch a ground offensive,
he said.
Preparations for the ground
confrontation continued around
the clock. At daybreak today, C
-130 Hercules transport planes
took off from a big air base in east
ern Saudi Arabia to ferry supplies
to ground forces inching toward
the northern Saudi border.
In the northern desert, front

line troops dug foxholes and
bunkers to protect them from
Iraq's top-line artillery. Army
engineers are working to finish
combat-related construction pro
jects including airstrips, roads,
helipads, maintenance bays and
roads.
In a sober assessment of the
potential impact of a ground war,
American commanders have
warned army doctors to expect

some frontline units to suffer
casualties of more than 10 percent
in 30 days, if current secret plans
for a ground attack are imple
mented.
Much of the allied bombing is
aimed at "softening up" the Iraqi
ground forces. Schwarzkopf said
the pilots are trying hard not to
cause civilian casualties, making
the risky business of bombing
runs even riskier.
