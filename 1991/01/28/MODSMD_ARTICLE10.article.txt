# Rhodes scholar juggles public service, academics, career goals
## Liu: 'I never lose interest because I can move to something new' 
### David Bianco Editorial staff 
He's a student body president.
He planned last year's You Can
Make a Difference Conference on
education. And he recently won
the prestigious Rhodes Scholar
ship to study at Oxford Univer
sity. Senior Goodwin Liu has
spent his four years here making
the most of Stanford's opportuni
ties for leadership, public service
and scholarship. The Daily caught
up with Liu in nis office last week.
How did you feel when you
found out that you had won a
Rhodes Scholarship?
I was ecstatic. The process is
kind of weird. (At the Western
region finals at USC), they gather
everybody up at the end of the day
into the same room, and they just
announce who got it. If your name
is announced, you don't want to
exult because the rest of the peo
ple are there and they're bummed.
So I saved the exhilaration for
when I came [back to Stanford].
And then it wasn't even easy
because I had three finals when I
came back. But it made taking
finnla that much easier because I
was totally happy.
What do you plan to do at
Oxford?
The plan right now is to pursue
the English equivalent of a Ph.D.
in immunology. Over the past cou
ple years, I have felt that my
undergraduate education has
been kind of scattered all over the
place with no real focus, so I could
use two or three years of more
focused work.
What are your career goals?
Past Oxford, I don't know. I
just hope I have a job when I come
back. In 20 years, I hope I am
someplace where I am not tied
down into some specific job like a
doctor or researcher. I think I
have enjoyed my undergraduate
life so much because what I have
is a lot of different things on my
dinner plate. I can look at this
issue, that issue; I can take a
break; I can move from place to
place. I never lose interest because

-1 can always move to something
new. And it's a wonderful position
to be in. I just wish I could always
be in that position.
If you are a university presi
dent, member of Congress or state
policy maker, there are a lot of dif
ferent things that you can turn
your attention to. And not only is
that selfishly something that
would appeal to me, but in terms
of the future of this nation and
this world, those are the types of
people that are going to make the
biggest impacts.
You want to do public pol
icy on a state or national
scale. There aren't a lot of
Asian-Americans that have
taken major leadership roles
in public policy.
I read an interesting article in
the (Los Angeles) Times about
state government in California,
and that there's a definite need
for role models. Even my parents
worry about me going into that
arena because it's not one that's
particularly secure and is subject
to the vicissitudes of politics.
But I think there is not enough
participation to represent the
numbers of Asian-Americans. In
10 or 20 years, there has got to be
more of a sense of citizenship and
participation in something larger
than someone's individual life or
their family.
If I can reach a position where I
can be a role model, then I would
like to be. At the levels right below
the top, there are a fair number of
Asian-Americans who are starting
to make it into that arena, but
there is a real need for more.
Last June, when 63 percent
of the voters voted to rccall
your COP slate, many stu
dents said you wouldn't be
able to effectively lead this

year. Has last spring's elec
tion controversy affected
your image?
During the recall and that
whole spring controversy, people
talked in such broad strokes about
People's Platform, Four Our
Future and democracy. It's okay
to talk about them, but I think the
debate was framed wrongly.
Nowhere in there was there
talk about Jamie Green, Goodwin
Liu, Ingrid Nava and Jay Tucker.
So by the time that we got to
office, we were very in tune with
having to find out what was going
on with the people who don't sup
port us. Is it because of the princi
ple about the elections process
and apathy, or is it really about
us? And I have to conclude, from
the relative ease with which we
have been able to operate this
year, that people were very dis
gruntled not particularly about
us, but about the elections pro
cess.
We have a lot of work to do, but
I think that when it comes down
to the four of us and our track
records, we are four individuals
who work very well together and
we have a good finger on the pulse
of the campus because we try to
get out there and listen. We've
taken a more moderate attack
than in past years, and it's been
productive.
In what way have you taken
a more moderate attack?
We've been very attentive to
inclusiveness, and making sure
that people on this campus aren't
just invited to events, but really
involved in the process of putting
things together.
We have tried to turn the ASSU
into not just a service organiza
tion for students; it's got to be a
two-way street. Students have to
see the ASSU as a service organi

zation through which they can do
their own service. [The ASSU] has
not been a student center in my
four years. That's got to change.
How has your experience of
Stanford's multiculturalism
changed you?
As much as people look at us,
the COR they conclude that we
are all the ones who think we are
multicultural, and that's just the
bottom line.
[This] is not really tine because
we, in our own discussions and
our own selves, question all the
time what the definition is, how
we go about enacting it, and we
grapple with the very same issues
that the campus does. In a posi
tion of leadership, that grappling
doesn't always come through and
all you see is the end product of
that grappling. But there's a
whole process of thinking that
goes into everything that we do
and it's just as tough. I do feel like
I have a better appreciation of
other cultures, coming out of
Stanford, but there are still many
issues unresolved.
If you were University pres
ident for a day, what would
you do?
I'm sure I'd have dinner on the
top of Hoover House. And I think
what I would like to see at Stan
ford is a better fusion of all these
different missions of preparing
people to be leaders, of doing pub
lic service, of teaching and
research.
I think we tend to separate
those spheres too distinctly, and
so students feel very fragmented
in their lives. They're pulled in all
these different directions which
don't have a center and don't have
the relevant links in between
them.
Oftentimes, you become very
confused as to what you should be
doing for the next 24 hours.
Should you be off in White Plaza
rallying with peace activists, going
to class or thinking about your
future? As a university president,
I think that it's possible to develop
more links, and to say whatever
you're doing is okay as long as you
follow what's in your heart and

what is your passion.
Most students aren't able
to incorporate leadership,
public service, research and
learning into their careers at
Stanford, but you certainly
have. Are you some kind of
wonder Stanford student?
I don't think so. I'm as insecure
as the next guy, I think, and it
takes constant questioning to
know if you are doing the right
thing. I think I have been persis
tent and have fit into the Stanford
mold in a way, because somewhere
along the line I've decided con
sciously that if I wanted some
thing at this University, that I
would just ask for it. That's
always what they tell you to do.

But in this office here, I have
an operating budget of $3,000 in
expenses for the whole year. I am
firmly convinced that there is
nothing that we cannot do on this
campus. Money is not the obsta
cle; it is selling people on ideas.
If you could say something
to all the Stanford students,
what would you tell them?
I would say, don't confine your
self by false limitations. Don't
march through Stanford just
thinking about your next class or
party or function. Think about
what you want to change about
Stanford and about the world, so
that in four years, you can make
sure when you leave Stanford you
leave it a better place.

have been able to operate this
year, that people were very dis
gruntled not particularly about
us, but about the elections pro
cess.
We have a lot of work to do, but
I think that when it comes down
to the four of us and our track
records, we are four individuals
who work very well together and
we have a good finger on the pulse
of the campus because we try to
get out there and listen. We've
taken a more moderate attack
than in past years, and it's been
productive.
In what way have you taken
a more moderate attack?
We've been very attentive to
inclusiveness, and making sure
that people on this campus aren't
just invited to events, but really
involved in the process of putting
things together.
We have tried to turn the ASSU
into not just a service organiza
tion for students; it's got to be a
two-way street. Students have to
see the ASSU as a service organi

zation through which they can do
their own service. [The ASSU] has
not been a student center in my
four years. That's got to change.
How has your experience of
Stanford's multiculturalism
changed you?
As much as people look at us,
the COR they conclude that we
are all the ones who think we are
multicultural, and that's just the
bottom line.
[This] is not really tine because
we, in our own discussions and
our own selves, question all the
time what the definition is, how
we go about enacting it, and we
grapple with the very same issues
that the campus does. In a posi
tion of leadership, that grappling
doesn't always come through and
all you see is the end product of
that grappling. But there's a
whole process of thinking that
goes into everything that we do
and it's just as tough. I do feel like
I have a better appreciation of
other cultures, coming out of
Stanford, but there are still many
issues unresolved.
If you were University pres
ident for a day, what would
you do?
I'm sure I'd have dinner on the
top of Hoover House. And I think
what I would like to see at Stan
ford is a better fusion of all these
different missions of preparing
people to be leaders, of doing pub
lic service, of teaching and
research.
I think we tend to separate
those spheres too distinctly, and
so students feel very fragmented
in their lives. They're pulled in all
these different directions which
don't have a center and don't have
the relevant links in between
them.
Oftentimes, you become very
confused as to what you should be
doing for the next 24 hours.
Should you be off in White Plaza
rallying with peace activists, going
to class or thinking about your
future? As a university president,
I think that it's possible to develop
more links, and to say whatever
you're doing is okay as long as you
follow what's in your heart and

what is your passion.
Most students aren't able
to incorporate leadership,
public service, research and
learning into their careers at
Stanford, but you certainly
have. Are you some kind of
wonder Stanford student?
I don't think so. I'm as insecure
as the next guy, I think, and it
takes constant questioning to
know if you are doing the right
thing. I think I have been persis
tent and have fit into the Stanford
mold in a way, because somewhere
along the line I've decided con
sciously that if I wanted some
thing at this University, that I
would just ask for it. That's
always what they tell you to do.

But in this office here, I have
an operating budget of $3,000 in
expenses for the whole year. I am
firmly convinced that there is
nothing that we cannot do on this
campus. Money is not the obsta
cle; it is selling people on ideas.
If you could say something
to all the Stanford students,
what would you tell them?
I would say, don't confine your
self by false limitations. Don't
march through Stanford just
thinking about your next class or
party or function. Think about
what you want to change about
Stanford and about the world, so
that in four years, you can make
sure when you leave Stanford you
leave it a better place.



Carolina Kalz â€” Dally
Stanford's most recent Rhodes scholar, Council of Presidents mem
ber Goodwin Liu, says he would like to see a better fusion of the Uni
versity's many different missions and more cooperation among its
members.
He's a student body president.
He planned last year's You Can
Make a Difference Conference on
education. And he recently won
the prestigious Rhodes Scholar
ship to study at Oxford Univer
sity. Senior Goodwin Liu has
spent his four years here making
the most of Stanford's opportuni
ties for leadership, public service
and scholarship. The Daily caught
up with Liu in nis office last week.
How did you feel when you
found out that you had won a
Rhodes Scholarship?
I was ecstatic. The process is
kind of weird. (At the Western
region finals at USC), they gather
everybody up at the end of the day
into the same room, and they just
announce who got it. If your name
is announced, you don't want to
exult because the rest of the peo
ple are there and they're bummed.
So I saved the exhilaration for
when I came [back to Stanford].
And then it wasn't even easy
because I had three finals when I
came back. But it made taking
finnla that much easier because I
was totally happy.
What do you plan to do at
Oxford?
The plan right now is to pursue
the English equivalent of a Ph.D.
in immunology. Over the past cou
ple years, I have felt that my
undergraduate education has
been kind of scattered all over the
place with no real focus, so I could
use two or three years of more
focused work.
What are your career goals?
Past Oxford, I don't know. I
just hope I have a job when I come
back. In 20 years, I hope I am
someplace where I am not tied
down into some specific job like a
doctor or researcher. I think I
have enjoyed my undergraduate
life so much because what I have
is a lot of different things on my
dinner plate. I can look at this
issue, that issue; I can take a
break; I can move from place to
place. I never lose interest because

-1 can always move to something
new. And it's a wonderful position
to be in. I just wish I could always
be in that position.
If you are a university presi
dent, member of Congress or state
policy maker, there are a lot of dif
ferent things that you can turn
your attention to. And not only is
that selfishly something that
would appeal to me, but in terms
of the future of this nation and
this world, those are the types of
people that are going to make the
biggest impacts.
You want to do public pol
icy on a state or national
scale. There aren't a lot of
Asian-Americans that have
taken major leadership roles
in public policy.
I read an interesting article in
the (Los Angeles) Times about
state government in California,
and that there's a definite need
for role models. Even my parents
worry about me going into that
arena because it's not one that's
particularly secure and is subject
to the vicissitudes of politics.
But I think there is not enough
participation to represent the
numbers of Asian-Americans. In
10 or 20 years, there has got to be
more of a sense of citizenship and
participation in something larger
than someone's individual life or
their family.
If I can reach a position where I
can be a role model, then I would
like to be. At the levels right below
the top, there are a fair number of
Asian-Americans who are starting
to make it into that arena, but
there is a real need for more.
Last June, when 63 percent
of the voters voted to rccall
your COP slate, many stu
dents said you wouldn't be
able to effectively lead this

year. Has last spring's elec
tion controversy affected
your image?
During the recall and that
whole spring controversy, people
talked in such broad strokes about
People's Platform, Four Our
Future and democracy. It's okay
to talk about them, but I think the
debate was framed wrongly.
Nowhere in there was there
talk about Jamie Green, Goodwin
Liu, Ingrid Nava and Jay Tucker.
So by the time that we got to
office, we were very in tune with
having to find out what was going
on with the people who don't sup
port us. Is it because of the princi
ple about the elections process
and apathy, or is it really about
us? And I have to conclude, from
the relative ease with which we
have been able to operate this
year, that people were very dis
gruntled not particularly about
us, but about the elections pro
cess.
We have a lot of work to do, but
I think that when it comes down

who work very well together and
