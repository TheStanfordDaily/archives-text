Croatia avoids all-out war
ZAGREB, Yugoslavia (AP) — Croatian President Franjo
Tubman said yesterday that Yugoslavia had gone through its
worst crisis since World War II as his pro-independence republic
faced a military clash with the federal army.
"We were on the verge of an all-out war with the military and
it is a miracle it didn't happen," Tubman said in an interview
with The Associated Press.
During a dramatic 9-hour session, Tubman and the army
early Saturday reached an agreement to avert a possible clash
between the central government army and Croatian security
forces.
Rebel right-wing politicians advance in
special French parliamentary elections
PARIS (AP) — Two rebel right-wing politicians won the first
round yesterday of special parliamentary elections they billed as a
crusade to rid France of political corruption. Turnout was light.
A third finished second in her district but will also compete in
runoff elections Feb. 3.
The three — Lyon Mayor Michel Noir, Jean-Michel Dubernard
and former health minister Michele Barzach — quit last month to
force the vote. It was seen as a challenge to Paris Mayor Jacques
Chirac, a former premier and leader of the conservative Rally for
the Republic Party.
