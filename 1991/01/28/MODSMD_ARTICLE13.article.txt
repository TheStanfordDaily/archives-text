# Israel studies ways to counter Scud attacks

### 
JERUSALEM (AP) - Stu
dents carried gas masks with their
textbooks as Israeli high schools
reopened yesterday for the first
time since the start of the Persian
Gulf War, and the foreign minister
said Israel was studying ways to
stop Iraq's missile attacks.
David Levy, the foreign minis
ter, said the government was con
sidering a number of alternatives,
but gave no details.
"When it decides, everyone will
know that the decision has been
weighed from every side . . . and
that every possible outcome has
been taken into account," he told
Israel radio.
Defense Minister Moshe Arens
told ABC television Israel could
help neutralize the Iraqi missiles
but that it would do so only in
cooperation with the forces allied
against Iraq.
"We think that we could make
a contribution in knocking out the
launchers," Arens said. "We'd
have to arrive at a level of coordi
nation and understanding with
the United States," he added.
Six missile attacks in the past
10 days have killed four people,
injured more than 200, and dam
aged more than 3,500 homes in
the greater Tel Aviv area.
Teen-agers returning to school

yesterday all had one thing in
common — a cardboard box con
taining a gas mask, slung over
their shoulders.
Iraq has repeatedly threatened
to use chemical weapons against
Israel. The missiles fired so far
have only had conventional war
heads, but Israel has not ruled out
the possibility of a chemical or bio
logical attack.
"It is logical to say that when
the man (Saddam) will be pressed
more to the wall and feels he has
less to lose, the risk of him using a
worse means ... or going up a
notch in weaponry . . . will be
higher," Defense Ministry
spokesman Dan Naveh said on
Israeli radio.
As a result, Israelis are taking
the necessary precautions.
Classroom windows and doors
were sealed with masking tape
and plastic sheeting to protect the
returning students, and those
who arrived without gas masks
were sent home, Israel radio said.
Teachers started lessons by
outlining emergency procedures if
air raid sirens sounded.
"In event of a siren, if you are
in the classroom, put on your gas
masks immediately, push the
tables together and sit under
them," one teacher told her class.
