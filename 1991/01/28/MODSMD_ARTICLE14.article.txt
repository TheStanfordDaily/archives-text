south of Mogadishu, one of the few sections of
the Horn of Africa nation of 8 million believed
still loyal to him.
Robleh said in London that his United

Somali Congress would announce an acting
committee within 48 hours to run Somalia. He
said the interim government would remain
until representatives from the main rebel
groups could meet to form a democratic gov
ernment representing the nation's various
clans.

"The information from Mogadishu is that
the fighting has finished. There is no more
shooting," said Etchejorry, who left
Mogadishu yesterday morning for Kenya and

spoke later in the day by radio telephone to
Western doctors still in Somalia.
"The rebels have announced that all of the
city is under their control."
While there was no independent confirma

communications problems, the rebels in their
claim — broadcast over the formerly govern
merit-ruii Radio Mogadishu — "smdlTiey seized
control of Mogadishu on Saturday night.
Deflpite the rebels' apparent victory,
Etchejorry said the situation in Mogadishu
was "quite anarchic."

quite incredible," he said.
The rebels, who draw their strength from
the large central Hawiye clan, have pledged to
replace Siad Barre's government with a multi
party democracy, hold free elections and allow
some form of regional autonomy.
