## Campbell's soup 
### 
By announcing in his
town meeting that he would
support the use of nuclear
weapons in the Persian Gulf given
the right circumstances, Stan
ford's representative in Congress,
Tom Campbell, has shocked and
disappointed many.
While a quick appendix to his
statement was issued the following
day, very little could repair the
damage already done by a foolish
statement.
To further claim that he would
only vote for a nuclear attack if it
were entirely necessary accom
plishes a precious nothing.
Who wouldn't vote for the use of
nuclear weapons if it were entirely
necessary? A child would do any
thing if he were told that it was the
only thing to do.
The use of nuclear weapons in
the war with Iraq is completely
intolerable for several reasons.
The United States has severely
criticized Saddam Hussein for his
use of chemical weapons, saying
they are indiscriminate weapons
that are designed to primarily kill

people, not just destroy tactical
weaponry. To use nuclear weapons
would make the United States look
extremely hypocritical.
The argument that nuclear
weapons should be used to save
American lives ultimately fails as
well.
If the safety of American lives is
suddenly the focus of this war,
maybe our people shouldn't be so
close to where all that fighting is
happening.
Maybe if troops weren't in the
Persian Gulf, soldiers wouldn't be
coming back in body bags.
Also, to use nuclear weapons,
even to end this war quickly, would
severely cripple any sort of "new
world order" that is to be sought at
the outcome of this conflict. Using
nuclear weapons for peace would
be like having sex for virginity.
Despite whatever game Tom
Campbell is playing, or whoever's
approval he is trying to gain, we
hope that he understands that
many still consider the use of
nuclear weapons unacceptable in
this war.
