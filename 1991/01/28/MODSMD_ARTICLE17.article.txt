THE ASSU SENATE'S recent
decision to sponsor its own
teaching award is a decidedly
positive move to improve under
graduate education for everyone.
By basing the award entirely on
student input, the ASSU helped to
perform one of its most important
tasks: to help direct real student
voices to the appropriate ears to
make a real impact.
This move will help to include
students who feel disenfranchised
by the seemingly meaningless
course evaluation sheets handed
out at the end of each quarter.
By actually voting for the recipi
ent of the award, students will pro
vide even more direct input and

will make a better way to gauge
good professorship.
In addition to providing a posi
tive indication of good professor
ship, the award could give a nega
tive indication of poor professor
ship.
The institution of this award
will give teaching the recognition
that it deserves. Too often, teach
ing has been underrated and listed
as inferior to research because it
doesn't bring as much money to
the University.
Hopefully, the University will
follow the senate's direction on
this case and continue its dedica
tion to the pursuit of excellence in
teaching.
