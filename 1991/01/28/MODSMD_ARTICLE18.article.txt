Stanford's losing its integrity over indirect costs issue

THE STANFORD administration is
losing much more than dollars in
the overhead fight. It is losing
integrity.
How did Stanford discover that the
government was being illegally charged
for the yacht Victoria? Remember that
Stanford's associate vice president for
public affairs, Larry Horton, most
unequivocally denied to the government
that this was the case. Bill Wilson of
"20/20" told Horton where to look.
But University President Donald
Kennedy tells us that "20/20" is out to
get us. Why then would Wilson tell Stan
ford how to correct a most serious error
rather than just nail Stanford to the
cross in front of 20 million viewers?
Wilson was testing Horton and Stan
ford for integrity. If he had had integrity,
Horton would have thanked Wilson for
clearing up this matter and a good work
ing relationship would have been possi
ble. But Horton did not thank Wilson.
The first Wilson knew was through
the press release from Public Affairs at
Stanford. Next were the flowers and

other items in the president's house.
Information was leaked to the press, and
Kennedy cried that this proved that the
government and the media could not be
trusted and were out to get Stanford.
A few years ago, the Stanford admin
istration released a decanal report on
overhead. This is part of the press pack
age given to Wilson and other media peo
ple inquiring about overhead at Stan
ford.
There was minority faculty represen
tation on the committee which drew up
that report, and these faculty were so
unhappy with the report that they wrote
an independent minority one. This the
administration has misplaced. It is not
included in the media package.
In a meeting of faculty with Wilson,
University attorney Debra Zumwalt
promised that Wilson would receive the
minority report. He has not. Other mem
bers of the media were not informed of
its existence through Public Affairs.
Note that Zumwalt was at this meeting
between Wilson and faculty at the spe-

cific request of the administration, yet
she did not follow through on such a
simple request.
When the overhead was lowered to 72
percent, Public Affairs press releases left
the impression that a million or two of
government money would not flow to
Stanford. They failed to make it clear
that there would be no change in the
amount of money coming to Stanford.
The only change is that more would go
to the faculty to support their research
and less into the overhead pool which
the administration would use as they see
fit.
Public Affairs at Stanford has spent
much effort in justifying lavish flowers
and cedar-lined closets in the president's
home as a true cost of research. They
have never described the support given
by overhead to faculty involved in
obtaining the funding from which the
overhead is taken.
I have been involved in obtaining
between $5 and $100 million in govern
ment research support. Many hours have

been spent in my office discussing this
with government officials and many
more in carrying out the research. But
when a chair breaks, I have to scrounge
in the machine shop to find the right
screw and fix it myself. When the pad
under my chair disintegrates, I carry it
to the dumpster myself and buy a new
one at Price Club â€” using my personal,
not University, funds. Public Affairs has
neglected the story of the faculty doing
research.
Public Affairs at Stanford presently
shows little integrity. Did it ever have
integrity? Yes. His name was Robert Bey
ers. He made Public Affairs at Stanford
respected and its integrity recognized
throughout this country.
However, he was forced out of his
position because he made Stanford
bureaucrats near him uncomfortable.
This often happens with integrity. Stan
ford now desperately needs a return to
integrity. It is time to bring Bob Beyers
back as head of Public Affairs.
