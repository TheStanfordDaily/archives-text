# Dorms should allow purchase of alcohol, not impose morals
## 
### 
I am a resident of Cedro, and I write
this letter in regard to my dorm's deci
sion to not allow dorm funds to be spent
on alcohol.
My family owns and operates a winery
in the Willamette Valley of Oregon. I
grew up with everyone around me drink
ing wine, and I work out in the vineyard
during the summer.
Unfortunately, when I was a kid, my
neighbors had religious problems with
alcohol and saw it as an unequivocally

bad thing. These neighbors had children
my age and, though we were friendly to
each other on the bus ride to school, we
could never play together because their
parents did not want them to associate
with my family.
I remember my parents telling me
once how sad it was that we could not
get along with our neighbors. A few
years ago they moved away.
While I am at Stanford, I sometimes
forget what the real world is like. When
we all arrive here in the fall to live in a
new place with new people, everyone is
so nice and friendly to everyone else.
Then after a few weeks the honeymoon
ends and people start to talk about other
people behind their backs and so on and
so forth.
Just like in the outside world, people
