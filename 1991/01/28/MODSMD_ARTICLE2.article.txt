Dozens of world leaders in government, business
and academia, including five former heads of state,
were on campus last Thursday and Friday to advise
Stanford on how to become a "world university."
The leaders came here under the auspices of the
Institute for International Studies, an umbrella
organization formed in 1989 to help Stanford orga
nize all international aspects of the University.
Various campus departments and centers that
deal with international issues, from the Stanford
Center for International Security and Arms Control
to the Center for Conservation Biology, are repre
sented by the institute.
In last week's meetings, council members framed
the problems facing the world in the near future —
issues involving the environment, international
security, the international political economy and sci
ence and technology policy.
In his introductory speech to the council, Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy said he was looking
for suggestions to pressure Stanford out of "immo
bility" toward becoming a "world university."
"We're inviting a push," he said. "We hope we get
one."
Participants included former U.S. president Ger
ald Ford, former West German Chancellor Helmut
Schmidt, former French President Valery Giscard
d'Estaing, former president of Costa Rica and Nobel
Peace Prize winner Oscar Arias and former Prime
Minister of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew.
According to Shultz, the chair of the council, his
previous role as a cabinet member illustrated to him
the need for interdisciplinary study in order to
understand global problems.
"The problems that come at you don't have any
label on them," Shultz said. He said a primary goal
of the meeting was to determine whether the Uni
versity could transcend lines of departments and dis
ciplines to solve problems.
The meeting sometimes had the tone of an exper
iment. At one point Shultz, who was running the
meeting, answered a question from Ford about the
format by saying, "I'm curious how this works, too."
During the first session, the council members lis
tened more than they spoke. Shultz later said, "If
you don't speak up, I'll call on you."
But by the end of the second day, Stanford experts
commissioned to introduce various topics were fre-
