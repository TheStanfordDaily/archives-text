# Making Stanford a 'world university'
## Council forges links, eyes international problems 
### Robert L. Jamieson Jr Mike Laris Staff writers 
Dozens of world leaders in government, business
and academia, including five former heads of state,
were on campus last Thursday and Friday to advise
Stanford on how to become a "world university."
The leaders came here under the auspices of the
Institute for International Studies, an umbrella
organization formed in 1989 to help Stanford orga
nize all international aspects of the University.
Various campus departments and centers that
deal with international issues, from the Stanford
Center for International Security and Arms Control
to the Center for Conservation Biology, are repre
sented by the institute.
In last week's meetings, council members framed
the problems facing the world in the near future —
issues involving the environment, international
security, the international political economy and sci
ence and technology policy.
In his introductory speech to the council, Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy said he was looking
for suggestions to pressure Stanford out of "immo
bility" toward becoming a "world university."
"We're inviting a push," he said. "We hope we get
one."
Participants included former U.S. president Ger
ald Ford, former West German Chancellor Helmut
Schmidt, former French President Valery Giscard
d'Estaing, former president of Costa Rica and Nobel
Peace Prize winner Oscar Arias and former Prime
Minister of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew.
According to Shultz, the chair of the council, his
previous role as a cabinet member illustrated to him
the need for interdisciplinary study in order to
understand global problems.
"The problems that come at you don't have any
label on them," Shultz said. He said a primary goal
of the meeting was to determine whether the Uni
versity could transcend lines of departments and dis
ciplines to solve problems.
The meeting sometimes had the tone of an exper
iment. At one point Shultz, who was running the
meeting, answered a question from Ford about the
format by saying, "I'm curious how this works, too."
During the first session, the council members lis
tened more than they spoke. Shultz later said, "If
you don't speak up, I'll call on you."
But by the end of the second day, Stanford experts
commissioned to introduce various topics were fre-

quently interrupted by debate.
Part of the reason for the meet
ing was to promote Stanford
nationally and internationally.
Biology Prof. Paul Ehrlich, in
characteristic bluntness, told the
council before his presentation on
the environment, "What I want to
do is blow Stanford's horn."
Burton Richter, director of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter, said because high energy
physics requires large and very
expensive atom smashers, much
of a scientist's ability to make dis
coveries depends on "the mother's
milk of everything, money."
Another goal of the council is
to serve as a nexus between schol
ars and scientists, and public-pol
icy and opinion makers.
One example of this was a
lively debate on the ethics of
biotechnology, with Andrew
Knight, chair of the company that
publishes The Times of London,
who called the implications
"Orwellian." Schmidt said he
feared that technology could be
used by a dictator, similar to Adolf
Hitler or Josef Stalin, to be used
for destructive purposes.
But Lucy Shapiro, professor of
Developmental Biology, said any
attempts to cap knowledge were
dangerous.
The gathering of the world pol
icy makers marked the end of
nearly a 15-month effort, spear
headed by institute director and
former University president
Richard Lyman, to forge a formal

agenda for the institute.
Since September 1989, the
institute, presently nursing a $1.5
million operating budget, has
been an administrative umbrella
for various research, foreign lan
guage and regional study pro
grams.
The council discussed ways in
which Stanford can use its
strengths as a world-class institu
tion to address international
problems.
The institute also seeks to
develop a teaching and research
program built around issues of
science and technology, the econ
omy and politics.
Lyman expressed hope that his
organization could employ an
integrative approach in order to
"come closer to the idea of a world
university concept. Our intention
is to be a stimulant and catalyst..
. . The University is becoming
increasingly internationalized,
Lyman said.
Participants at the meeting
said Stanford has already
expanded to other parts of the
world and planted the seeds of the
world university concept.
They cited Overseas Studies
programs in places such as Flo
rence and Kyoto as examples.
SLAC has also established
exchanges with scientists at labs
in Beying, China and Novosibirsk,
Soviet Union, and the University
has implemented bio-diversity

programs in Costa Rica.
"We want to build on those pro
grams in place already," said
Thomas Heller, deputy director
for the institute.
The institute will draw on vari
ous University departments, as
well as the Graduate Schools of
Engineering and Business, to
address international issues.
Heller said one principal
advantage of the council members
is their connection to leaders and
policy makers within their home
countries. "Ultimately, we want to
make a system that produces pol
icy recommendations that can be
fed into policy centers around the
world," he added.
Lyman said people are accus
tomed to looking to the govern
ment for solutions. He said uni
versities must work to inject ideas
into government.
"We are condemned to live with
ever more people on a non
expanding globe and, therefore, it
seems to me that international
contact and mutual help becomes
ever more urgent if we wish to
prevent future international con
flict," Schmidt said.
Ford added, "I think it is an
important application to problems
that in most cases have been
looked at from a national or
parochial point of view. What's
important is that we have a global
point of view."
Singapore's former Prime Min
ister Lee said competition for
placement of Stanford at the cen
ter of global attention would be
harsh.
"You may know there is a U.N.
University in Tokyo that started
some 10 years ago," he said.
