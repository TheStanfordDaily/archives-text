form themselves into groups where
everyone has the same beliefs, and often
they do not seem to question them. I
have consciously tried to not be associ
ated with a certain group or mindset.
But now some of these groups are vot
ing into dorm law their thoughts on cer
tain issues. They are legislating morality
to a smaller group. The majority should

rule, but the minority should have
rights. And taking away a four-class
dorm's prerogative whether or not to
purchase alcohol with dorm funds is a
self-righteous, prejudiced thing to do.
If my parents had operated an orange
juice farm I probably could have played
blocks with all of my neighbors. But my
family produces wine and I could not
play with the kids down the street. Why
is this so?
I know that out there many narrow
people exist with singular thoughts and
self-righteous attitudes. But at Stanford,
a somewhat more learned, open-minded
community, please do not let this mind
frame sneak in.
