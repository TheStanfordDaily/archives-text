## Thanks for the memories

WELL, I MUST SAY THAT THIS
column has been an interesting
and enlightening experience for
me. Writing it was nothing new, but the
kinds of reactions I got were certainly
revealing.
For instance, I read that there's now a
campus band named after me, although
it's actually called "The Virginia Sigh,"
not "The Virginia Tsai."
I suppose you shouldn't be surprised
that Intermission made an error. You
know how journalists are. At least you
criticize them enough to seem to know.
And my friends tell me that there's a
goldfish in Potter that also has my name.
I have not personally met this goldfish
nor heard its name uttered, but consider
ing there's a band named after me, I sup
pose this is not a completely inconceivable
notion.
Then there are the passing references
in Gaieties and the Chaparral. All in good
fun, no doubt.
Ah yes, and I mustn't forget to men
tion the drunken rugby player. There I
was minding my own business, walking
back to the dorm with my friends, when
one of those golf-cart-type vehicles almost
crashed behind us.
A group of loud, obnoxious Stanford
students reeking of alcohol rolled out of
the cart, and one such cretin lumbered
over to us. He began babbling to one of
my friends about our evening. Then he
noticed my presence.
"Hey, aren't you Virginia Tsai?" he hic
cuped. I confirmed his astute observation,
and he continued. "Well, I hate to tell you
this, but your column is the worst one

I've ever read. .
The lout then proceeded, as a sort of
aside, to commend me on my "guts" for
undertaking this journalistic endeavor as
a freshman despite the fact that I had
proven myself completely inept. How gen
erous of him.
Then, as though he hadn't said quite
enough, he launched, quite validly per
haps, into a laudatory dissertation on the
greatness of Joel Stein, the Friday colum
nist who lives down the hall from him.
My hat's off to Joel Stein for com
manding the admiration of such a pol
ished young man. I'm sorry; that was
uncalled for. I have nothing against Stein.
Besides, he can't control who or what his
readership includes any more than I can.
Perhaps I should thank the guy for
being forthright and upfront in his
attack. The rest of my critics, and there
seem to be quite a few out there, prefer
taking pot shots.
Before I began life as a Stanford stu
dent I had always heard about how
relaxed Stanford was, how people here
take very little seriously.
In view of my experiences stemming
from this column, I think I can safely say
that this stereotype, like most every other
stereotype and preconceived notion, is
largely inaccurate.
A rather large number of students
here take everything seriously, most espe
cially themselves.
What's more, they'll always be more
than happy to give you their expert anal
ysis of precisely what is wrong with you
or anything even remotely connected to
you.

No, the mcyority of Stanford students
aren't at all stingy with their criticisms.
I offer the incident with the rather typ
ical, sadly enough, drunken Stanford stu
dent as proof of this phenomenon. Even
in his inebriated state, he used what little
sense alcohol was kind enough to leave
him to tell me exactly how awful my writ
ing was.
I suppose a year or two of education at
a prestigious university like Stanford
endows one with enough knowledge to
convince oneself that one is never wrong,
can never be wrong, and will never be
wrong. Moreover, the only valid opinions
worth voicing or examining are those of
one's own.
Imagine paying $20,000 a year to
breed arrogance. At least people seem to
be getting their money's worth, and
more. Stanford: the bargain of the cen
tury.
Well, what is education, after all, with
out an ample dose of self-importance?
Think about it. Oh, excuse me. I for
got. You're a Stanford student; you
already have. In fact, you came to the con
clusion about nine paragraphs ago that
I'm wrong, as usual.
I expect I will be hearing from you
shortly.
