# Travel Journal: Eastern Europe
## Donald Klein With communism's collapse, visitors can see social change firsthand 
### 
This summer a student in
Bucharest, Romania, tried to illu
minate the communist history of
his country to myself and two fellow
Westerners. He emphasized his point to
these otherwise naive listeners with an
analogy.
The postwar changes of the last 40
years were, he thought, like an upright
wine bottle newly inverted and balanced
precariously on its cork. He reinforced
with his wry smile the image of the
"dregß" of the wine suddenly situated at
the top and in control; and only now, after
the changes of the last year, were they
finally settling to their proper place at the
bottom.
Just before this encounter we had
heard a rhetorician of the opposite per
suasion talk in almost the exact same
terms. Communist rule, he thought, had
overturned, if nothing else, the pyramid
of centuries-old hierarchical and quasi
feudal class structures that had lasted up
to the war.
Though he supported many of the
recent changes, he nonetheless feared a
return to old ways of doing business in
Romania. Conflicting perspectives such
as these almost define Eastern Europe
right now. For the traveler, few other
places on the globe over the coming year
will offer such a revealing exposure into
societies in transition. East Germany,
Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary, Roma
nia, Bulgaria — they are all witnessing
spectacular social movements. Combine
these startling political changes with the
history, the diversity of cultural tradition,
the affordability of travel, the range of

differing landscapes linked by train, and
you have a travel opportunity not avail
able anywhere else.
Here are some of the out-of-the-way
destinations my friends and I easily
included in a four week tour: the peaks of
the High Tatras in the Carpathians of
Czechoslovakia, the bend of the Danube
from Ezstergom to Budapest through
Hungary, the medieval towns of Transyl
vania, the painted monasteries and reli
gious festivals of Northern Moldavia
along the Russian border in Romania and
the cobbled Latin streets of baroque
Bucharest. If such places sound too allur
ing to resist, this spring or summer pro
vides an opportune time to go.
Much of the countryside has changed
little from the ways of life that sustained
it for centuries. No more burghers and
feudal lords, to be sure, but the methods
of farming and everyday life seem out of
an idyllic novel.
In places like Bukovino along the Rus
sian border in Romania, horse and carts
still predominate and fields are generally
worked with plows, scythes, and towering
haystacks. Occupants build their own
houses out of rough timbers, ornately
decorated plaster individually designed
for each farm, and red tiles for the roofs.
Every town has at least one Eastern
Orthodox chapel painted by local resi
dents in elaborate folklore designs.
The December conflicts have left the
people of Eastern Europe much freer to
speak and do as they please. Time and
again, when we met some students on a
train and ended up crashing on their floor
for the night or talking politics in a bar all

evening, we heard the same comment:
"We would never have thought of doing
this last year!"
Now you can mingle with people
openly and speak freely on any subject
without worrying about the consequences
for your acquaintances. The border into
East Berlin used to be so strict last Octo
ber it was forbidden to carry dirty under
wear across it. Now you can walk from
Zoogarten in the West to Alexanderplatz
in the East as easily as you would a stroll
in the park. The border around East Ger
many used to contain mines, trip-wire
triggered machine guns, watchtowers and
border guards more surly than their
attack-trained canines.
While crossing it this summer, I had
my American passport jocularly withheld
and touted in the air by one of these same
patrols. He attempted to appear as warm
hearted and as good-natured as his grim
visage could manage — a broad smile on
his face, a red nose, his official cap pushed
back above his forehead.
He ended up even doing a bit of a dance
step in the middle of our small compart
ment with my passport above his head.
My wide-eyed East German companion at
the time whispered with one hand to the
side of his mouth as they departed,
"They're a little worried about their jobs
these days, I think!"
Add this new openness to famous East
European hospitality and you can't help
but come away with memories you will
never forget. The three of us, toward the
end of our journey, accompanied a
recently befriended student home to his
grandmother's flat in central Bucharest.

We arrived, of course, unknown and
unannounced and felt we could only
importune them for the evening at most.
We not only spent the night, we ended up
staying the week, and by the end of it felt
obliged to stay even longer!
Our friend Cezar, his sister Diana, and
their family warmed us with hospitality
and guided tours through their ancient
city. Cezar's grandmother, a 70-year-old
matriarch with a prodigious enthusiasm
for cooking and serving elaborate meals,
rendered us helpless captives in her bow
ered garden of ripe grapevines and new
born kittens. We never seemed able to sat
isfy her desires to consume enough food
or eat enough grapes; invariably she
would arrive at the table during the mid
dle of one of the many courses and signify
her displeasure with the pace of our
progress.
Twirling her arm in a circle like a
Viking sea captain might spur the slaves
at the oars with a whip, she would press
us to eat on. Implacable in the face of our
pleadings, she would pull the plate from
under our upward moving forks and

spoon more food on to the pile. All we
could do was look at one another with
already bulging cheeks and rather help
less eyes. That such generosity of time
and scanty resoures could be afforded to a
group of unknown travelers made us feel,
literally, worlds away from London and
America.
Though the difference between a soon
to-be-assimilated East Germany and a
still-isolated and absolutist Romania
defies similarity, one connecting link
seems to run throughout all the cities and
towns we visited — what one might call a
"psychological revolution."
More a feeling than a political scheme,
this particular revolution has taken hold
everywhere despite whatever parties and
rulers may still linger in positions of
hegemony and influence. People are freer
now than they have been in the last 40
years to interact with whomever they
choose, and that, particularly, includes
travelers.
