## Cardinal, without Vlahov, falls to Arizona State

Wanna see a great impression
of a yo-yo? Check out the Stanford
men's basketball team.
Just three days after perhaps
their most intense, emotional per
formance of the season, the Cardi
nal flopped all over Maples Pavil
ion yesterday afternoon in a hap
hazard, disconcerting, sometimes
putrid 58-47 loss to Arizona State.

Men's Basketball

Sun Devils 58

Cardinal 47

The loss was the second crash
to-earth game in as many week
ends for Stanford, now 10-8 (3-5
and ninth in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence). Against both Arizona and
UCLA the last two weeks, the
Cardinal has been out of its mind
in intensity and performance;
against both USC and now ASU
(12-5, 3-4), Stanford has done
very little (if anything) worth
talking about.
To top it all off, iryured Stan
ford forward Andrew Vlahov
didn't play at all against the Sun
Devils, and announced afterward
that his season, and his collegiate
career, are over (see related story).
"It's not like we didn't play
hard," Stanford coach Mike Mont
gomery said. "I think we played
harder in the second half when we
realized what we were up against,
but we still had no edge.
"Anytime you look back at a
game you think, well, what'd we
do better than they did? Today we
didn't do much better."
That's putting it kindly. The
Cardinal, which came into the
game shooting .507 from the floor,
hit all of four field goals in the
first half and had exactly 14
points at intermission. Nine Stan
ford players saw action in the first
half. Two of them — Adam Keefe
and Kenny Ammann — actually
scored.

The Cardinal, as a team, was a
miserable 4 for 17 in the first half.
That's a shooting percentage of
.235, which is great if you're play
ing shortstop but not too hot if
you're playing basketball. The
score was 24-14 at the half — at
least one bet was made that the
first half of the Super Bowl would
have more scoring — and Stan
ford would never catch up.
"If you shoot 23 percent it's
going to be hard to beat anyone in
this league," Montgomery said.
"ASU had 24, so they weren't
exactly lightin' it, but we had 14."
Ammann and Keefe split that
14, and ended up with 21 and 16
points respectively, but that didn't
make up for the rest of the team's
offensive offense. The other three
starters — John Patrick, Deshon
Wingate, and first-timer Jim Mor
gan — combined for eight points.
The bench chipped in with two
more, and that was it.
If you'd asked Montgomery
what he thought about his
offense's execution, he probably
would have said it was a good idea.
"I'm not sure I've figured this
team out yet," said Keefe. "Some
times we come out, we play hard
and we're tough: We're a good
team. Other times...."
Other times, well, things fall
apart. Part of that might have
been caused by Vlahov's absence,
but that's really no excuse. "It's
not like it's all of a sudden," said
Morgan, who's been starting in
practice for the last four weeks.
The team that started yesterday's
game has been playing together
for the better part of a month, but
it sure didn't look like it.
"I think (Vlahov's absence) was
definitely a part of it," Keefe said,
"but I don't think we played a
very good game."
Most of that not-so-good game
centered around Stanford's
inability to get the ball to anybody.
"One thing we did miss (with Vla
hov out) was passing," Mont


Tracy Allen — Daiiy
Senior guard Kenny Ammann tied his career high by scoring 21
points yesterday. He and Adam Keefe combined for 37 but the
rest of the team tallied only 10 points In the Cardinal's loss to
Arizona State.
gomery said. "People were open
and we couldn't get the ball to
them. We're going to have to work
on that."
The open people were usually
Morgan and Keefe, both of whom
touched the ball less than the
Bills' offense did yesterday. Mor
gan took only one shot in each
naif, and as for Keefe. ...
"What'd I have, 11 shots?"
Keefe asked. "Two of those were
threes at the end, so you can't
really count those, and I think
three or four were from behind
the basket on fast breaks. That's
five shots.
"That's not Stanford basket
ball," Keefe said. "To have our low
post players get two and five shots
respectively — that's not our
game."
Actually, it was ASU's game, as
the Devils slowed it down every
time they touched the ball,
swarmed on defense, and never let
the Cardinal establish any real
momentum. "We had to play that
way, because of the way we've

been shooting and out of respect
for Stanford," said ASU coach Bill
"Where's my NCAA ring?"
Frieder, whose team lost at Cal
Thursday night. "That's the way
we felt we had to play to win."
"I think ASU is the best man
to-man defensive team in the
league, pure and simple," Mont
gomery said. Their offense wasn't
that bad either: 6-foot-10 center
Isaac Austin missed only one of
his eight shots on the way to 17
points, and reserve guard Stevin
Smith had 15 — 3 for 3 on his
threes.
Stanford did make a run mid
way through the second half, cut
ting a 38-25 deficit to two points
with 2:47 to go, but then ASU's
Terence Wheeler hit a 23-foot
three-pointer (with four seconds
left on the shot clock) to make it
44-39.
(The Sun Devils were 6 of 7
from three-land, which, consider
ing they usually make 35 percent
of their treys, makes perfect
sense.)
Ammann responded with a 19-
footer from the left corner (one of
five almost-threes that he hit on
the day) to cut it to 44-41, but that
was as close as the Cardinal would

get. Wheeler made five of six free
throws down the stretch, while
Stanford missed all three of its
shots from the line and couldn't
get the ball inside.
The only points the Cardinal
scored in the last two minutes
were on three-pointers by — who
else? — Keefe and Wingate. Go
figure.
"We've got our work cut out for
us," Montgomery said. "Some
one's got to step up. I don't know
who."
