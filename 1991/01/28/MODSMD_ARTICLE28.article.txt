Trisha Stevens doesn't have a
nickname, but if she did, it
would probably be "money."
Like cash, Stevens is handy to
have around in times of need.

Cardinal 79

Sun Devils 65

In last Thursday's romp
past the hapless Arizona Lady
Cats, the injury-hampered
Stevens' services were not
required, and she contributed
only four points. But against a
big, athletic Arizona State
squad two nights later, the Car
dinal again went to the Bank of
Trisha.
Once again, the funds were
there. Stevens poured in 22
points on 9-of-15 shooting in
just 25 minutes of time, as
Stanford held off the pesky
Sun Devils in Tempe, 79-65.
Her effort was all the more
remarkable in that Stevens
was forced to leave the game
with more than six minutes left
when she drew her fifth foul.
She joined teammate Chris
MacMurdo and two Sun Devils
in fouling out, on a night when
the officials made some cre
ative calls.
"We can't control the offi
cials," said Stanford coach
Tara VanDerveer, "although I
like to think I can tell them a
thing or two. They're gonna
call what they're gonna call,
and we just have to adjust to
it."
Stanford did manage to
adjust, after an ASU run had
closed an early 16-point lead to
just three at the half. The Car
dinal never allowed the Devils
to get any closer, and won going
away for its eighth consecutive
victory.
"We came out in the second
half and Sor\ja (Henning) was
running the break, and getting
the ball inside to Trisha, and
she was scoring," VanDerveer
said. The game was that sim
ple. When the Cardinal needs
points, Trisha Stevens delivers.
As she did at Washington
(led all scorers with 21 points)
two weeks ago and against
USC (24 points) last weekend,
Stevens emerged in a close
game and showed why she is an
All-America candidate Big No.
30's soft touch can be unstop

pable around the basket, as evi
denced by her .538 shooting
percentage, which is fourth in
the Pac-10.
Around the press, however,
Stevens does not stand out,
preferring to downplay her
stardom. "I think I made a lot
of stupid fouls," she said after
her performance.

'We came out in the
second half and
Sonja (Henning)
was running the
break, and getting
the ball inside to
Trisha.

Asked about her points, the
Philomath, Oregon, native
replied, "I want the team to do
really well, and if I can help
out, I'm happy."
Forward Julie Zeilstra
added 17 points, while Val
Whiting yanked down 13
rebounds to match her 13
points and pace the Cardinal in
that category. Stevens and
MacMurdo grabbed nine
boards apiece, helping Stanford
nearly match the Sun Devils in
rebounds, 52-51. Arizona State
entered the game as the confer
ence's top rebounding team,
with Stanford a somewhat mis
leading ninth.
The game was further evi
dence that Stanford's rebound
ing woes may be disappearing,
a trend that is paralleled neatly
by the emergence of MacMurdo
as a force on the boards.
Despite fouling out, Mac-
Murdo's nine rebounds Satur
day gave her a titanic total of
25 for the road trip, and gave
her coach cause to rejoice.
"I thought Chris really
helped us on the boards, and
then she got in foul trouble,"
VanDerveer said. "I'm really
happy with how Chris has been
playing ... her rebounding has
improved a lot.
VanDerveer's team improved
its record on the season to a
spiffy 14-3, and a commanding
8-0 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence. The wins, combined with
Pac-10 rival Washington's
upset loss to Oregon State last
week, gives the Cardinal a
deathgrip on the conference
lead with half the season in the
books.
"It was a good win for us,
and and a good road trip;" Van-
Derveer said.
