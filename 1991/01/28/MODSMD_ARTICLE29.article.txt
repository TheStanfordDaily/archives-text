# Injury ends senior leader's season
## 
### Robert Pardington Senior staff writer 
Both coaches seemed to down
play it, but the huge majority of
questions at the press conference
after the Arizona State game yes
terday were about the loss of
senior forward Andrew Vlahov for
the season. Surgery will be per
formed sometime this week to
remove a bone spur from his right
ankle.
"It's over," Vlahov admitted
solemnly. "The decision to have
surgery was inevitable since the
North Carolina game. I thought
maybe I could get one or two more
games in, but it has got to the
point where I can't recover in one
or two days."
"You take a risk for a while,"
Vlahov said. "Then you say, 'I've
cheated it too much.' "
Vlahov averaged 11.3 points
and 6.2 rebounds on the year, both
totals second to center Adam
Keefe. He passed out 63 assists,
second on the team to point guard
John Patrick, and lead the team in
steals, with 27.
In his final collegiate game, a
78-76 loss to Arizona Thursday
night, Vlahov nearly recorded the
first triple-double in Stanford
men's basketball history. Playing
in front of his parents, who flew in
from Perth, Australia, he had 15
points, 10 rebounds, nine assists
and three steals.
The loss to the team was appar
ent in many ways yesterday, as the
underdog Sun Devils downed the
Cardinal 58-47. Stanford could
not establish any kind of offensive
rhythm in the first half particu
larly and had scored only 14
points at halflime.
The Cardinal adjusted on
offense in the second half, but it
then became painfully obvious
that something was missing on
defense. The inside was soft, the
Sun Devils were exploiting the

paint, an area where the bulky
Australian usually takes up a lot
of room.
Stanford coach Mike Mont
gomery listed just some of the
ways in which his team misses
Vlahov's presence.
"Leadership," Montgomery
emphasized, "and having a guy on
the floor that can catch the ball,
get the rebound, take their best
man.... Andrew to me is as valu
able to our basketball team as any
player is to anyone else's basket
ball team in this league."
Dwelling on the specifics of the
loss, Montgomery cited the poor
ball movement and passing.
"The one thing that we did
miss is passing," he said. "We had
guys open.... It was just a matter
of getting some offensive
sequence, some offensive
rhythm."
"It seemed like the whole game
someone was saying, 'Oh, my
fault,' or 'Yeah, I know, I know,' "
Keefe said. "Our margin of error
is diminished without Andrew."
The bottom line, Montgomery
said, is that there was no one
shooting the ball on a lot of trips
down the floor. Vlahov had always
been one to get the tough basket,
and he was shooting nearly 57
percent on the year.
"There's no substitute for guys
shooting it in the hoop," Mont
gomery said.
Not playing will be very hard
on Vlahov, a real warrior on the
court.
"It's very frustrating," Vlahov
said, "I don't even know if I can sit
through five more games.
"One time the ball was coming
to me [while sitting on the bench]
and I almost dove for it."
More than just Vlahov's physi
cal presence, Stanford will miss
the emotional lift that the 6-foot-7
Vlahov has given them over the
years.
Montgomery noted that the
Cardinal wanted to take its inten
sity level up a notch or two during
a second-half comeback, but just
couldn't because of the absence of
Vlahov.
"We can't kick it up (emotion
ally)," Montgomery said. "We
have nothing to kick up. We don't
have Andrew."
Vlahov's teammates realize
that they will have to try to "kick
it up," for the remainder of the
season.
The greatest burden falls on
freshman Jim Morgan, who
started in place of Vlahov yester
day afternoon. Morgan made it
clear however, that the rest of the
team also has its work cut out.
"I think as a team we have to
pick it up," Morgan said. "It's not
going to fall on anyone's shoul
ders."
"We're not going to change
much," Montgomery said. "We
just have to work harder at what
we're doing."
