# Arias laments little negotiation
## 
### Mike Laris Staff writer 
Oscar Arias seemed out of
place.
Most participants at Stanford's
International Advisory Council
meeting Thursday and Friday
used the gathering for animated
discussions on global issues. But
Arias, the former president of
Costa Rica and winner of the 1987
Nobel Peace Prize, seemed to
spend much of his time mourning
war in Middle East.
During intermissions, when
the majority of other leaders and
participants clustered together for
further conversation, Arias some
times stood alone, speaking to no

one. He made no
attempt to dis
guise his visible
anguish.
Arias also gave
a somber lun
cheon speech at
the opening of the
meeting which
later elicited de
bate among vari
ous leaders.

"We were all very impressed by
Oscar Arias' sadness," according
to Andrew Knight, chair of the
British company that publishes
The Times of London. But, he
added, "The only chance for peace
in the world is a willingness to go
to war."

In an interview with The Daily,
Arias said he did not think the
decision to go to war was wrong.
Instead, he said he is profoundly
frustrated at the failure of negoti
ations and fearful of the costs of
war.
"Coming from a small country
like Costa Rica with no army, . . .
it was important to see the Secu
rity Council react so rapidly and
efficiently to the aggression of
Saddam Hussein because we pre
fer to rely on collective security
than on the might of the super
powers," he said.
"Now, having said that, ... I


Arias
can only regret that the Security
Council did not give more chance
to diplomacy, more chance to
negotiations," he added.
Arias is recognized as the driv
ing force behind negotiations to
sign the Central American Peace
Plan in 1987, and his efforts even
tually won him the Nobel Prize.
"You cannot solve a conflict so
complicated like that in the Per
sian Gulf" in such a short amount
of time, he said.
"If it took me three years to
persuade the Sandinistas to hold
free and fair elections and to com
ply with the peace plan, then you
would not have expected to per
suade Saddam Hussein in six
weeks what we wanted him to do,"
he said.
* Arias also said he is worried
that war in the Gulf, coupled with
"reactionary" moves by Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev,
could leave developing democra
cies without economic aid and in
danger of instability.
"All this could reinitiate a new
arms race so that the developing
world won't be able to benefit
from the dividend of peace," Arias
said. "With the end of the Cold
War, I'm sure that the
industrial/military complex will
again put a lot of pressure on gov
ernments to keep spending more
money on the production of
arms," he said.
"As citizens of the Third World,
the hope of yesterday seems to
fade away."
