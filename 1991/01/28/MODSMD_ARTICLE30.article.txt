"This time we had a game plan," said Stan
ford men's volleyball coach Ruben Nieves.
And this time Stanford was able to knock off
Western Intercollegiate Voleyball Association
foe Brigham Young, as they swept two
matches from the Cougars over the weekend.
The Cardinal avenged an early-season unof
ficial tournament loss by defeating the
Cougars on both FYiday and Saturday in
Provo, Utah. In Friday's WTVA match, Stan
ford fought through a strong early start by
BYU to win 15-12, 9-15, 16-14, 15-9. Satur
day's match did not count in league standings
and Stanford had an easier time defeating the
Cougars, 15-11, 15-9, 15-4.
The victories lifted Stanford's overall
record to 3-1 and left them tied with Long
Beach State and San Diego State atop WIVA's
Wilson Division with a 2-0 record. Brigham
Young dropped to 0-5 overall, and their 0-2
WIVA left them tied with UC-Irvine for last
place in the DeGroot Division.
Nieves said that this weekend's matches,
especially Friday's match, differed from the
UC-Santa Barbara tournament contest in
many ways. "This time we'd seen them play
before and knew the kinds of things they like

to do. We knew where their hitters planned to
hit out of certain formations, and when they
changed their pattern, we were able to adjust.
The biggest difference of all, though, was the
fact that we were playing a WIVA match, and
the level of intensity is always going to be a lot
higher."
The Cardinal started off slowly in Friday's
match, as the Cougars pounded some tough
early serves, most of them in the direction of
junior outside hitter Bob Hillman. After a few
passing errors to start the first game, Hillman
turned things around and Nieves said that
Hillman's consistent passing was one of the
keys to Stanford's four-set victory.
Still, BYU came back and dominated the
second game, winning 15-9. That gave Nieves
reason to go to his bench, and the move paid
off. Freshman setter Canyon Ceman came in
for starter Jimmy Blackman and the Cardinal
began to side out much better. They came
back to win the third game 16-14, and coasted
15-9 in the fourth.

"I thought our depth and ability to substi
tute gave us a big advantage. Jimmy Klein
came in and gave Dave Goss some time to
regroup after he got off to a slow start. And I
thought Canyon's play when he came in was a
turning point in the match," said Nieves.
Another key for Stanford was its ability to
shut down the Cougars leading hitter, Steve
Hieta, who had come into the weekend with 29
kills in his last two matches.
The Cardinal was more than happy to
escape Provo with another league win. "In our
league any time you go on the road it's going to
be a tough match. Their home crowd gave
them a definite advantage," said Nieves.
Saturday's match saw the again Cougars
get off to a fast early start, as they led 11-9 in
the first game. But freshman J.B. Taylor and
senior John Alstrom gave Stanford some key
serves and back-row play late in the game, as
they came back to win 15-11. The Cardinal
took control of the next two games and impres
sively finished off their two-match weekend
sweep.
This weekend Stanford opens the toughest
stretch of their schedule with two WIVA
matches against Hawaii, Friday and Saturday
in Burnham Pavilion. Over the next three
weeks the Cardinal will play six straight
league matches.
