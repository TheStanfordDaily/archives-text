# Women gymnasts romp to home victory
## 
### Brandi Shipp Staff writer 
At their first home meet of the
season, the Stanford women's
gymnastics team tumbled over
their competition, taking a first
place finish.
Burham Pavillion was packed
Saturday night as the Cardinal
faced off against Sacramento
State, UC-Davis, and a tough Cal
ifornia team. The women, backed
by an incredibly rowdy crowd, per
formed very well for their first
home meet.
"The crowd was really support
ive. It was easier to get psyched
up," freshman Kerri Kaunka said.
"Hopefully, they will continue to
support us, because we love to
have them behind us."
There was little question
through the meet as to who would
walk away with the win. The
Stanford women led the whole
way, highlighted with exceptional
performances on the balance
beam. Among the six competitors,
there was just one fall.
"Unfortunately, we had one fall
on the beam. It was really odd; it
won't happen again," asst. coach
Penney Hauschild said. "Last
week, we were six for six. I think
that if we average one fall per
meet at this point in the season,
then we are doing very well." The
Stanford women are the strongest
on the beam, proven by thier

ranking as the sixth best colle
giate team in the nation on that
apparatus.
Saturday's meet was basically a
grudge match between the top two
competing teams, Stanford and
Cal. The Stanford women had
already beaten the Golden Bears
last weekend, and had some fears
as to whether they could repeat it.
"Last week, we did well against
Cal. Tonight, we wanted to make
sure that it was real," Hauschild
said.
"They (Cal) could have had
enough to motivate the team to
come back and beat us, so we were
a little nervous," coach Breck
Greenwood said.
Stanford, however, overcame
its jitters to beat the Bears, 186.70
points to 185.30 points, chalking
up its highest point total of the
vear. "We were really psyched,
because our all-around score
keeps building and building,"
freshman Mollie Brown said after
the meet.
In fact, the score for this meet
came within five-hundreths of a
point of last year's highest score, a
great accomplishment for the
third meet of the season. The

other teams, UC-Davis and Sacra
mento State, placed far behind
with 175.65 points and 158.45
points, respectively.
The Stanford women, although
they all performed well, were led
by an incredible freshman duo of
Kanuka and Kerrie Kelley. Kelley
took home the second-place hon
ors in all-around, with a score of
37.75 points.
Kanuka, her partner in crime,
earned first place with a score of
38.30 in all-around competition.
Kelley had an incredible perfor
mance on the beam, with a score
of 9.7 points. Kanuka, Canada's
top senior gymnast, had her best
performnaces on the floor and
bars, with 9.7 on each event.
Despite the fact that she left
out some difficulty in her first
pass, Kanuka's floor performance
outshone the others when she
perfomed a double back in her
third tumbling pass. Although
many of the gymnasts struggled
with the same trick in their third
pass, she nailed it."I was very
pleased with my bars because that
was a personal best," Kanuka
said.
Despite the outstanding perfor
mance, the Cardinal still sees
room for improvement. "Vaulting
is our weakest event," Greenwood
explained. "We are working on a
couple of new vaults, but in gen
eral, we just basically need to
work on our execution and our

consistency."
The women also look to add a
few new tricks in some routines to
increase the difficulty level, which
will in turn increase their score.
"Our next goal is to score 188
points, which is what we need for
nationals," Hauschild said. The
national competition is certainly
within the reach of the gymnasts.
The top 12 teams in the nation
advance to the NCAAs, and the
Stanford women are now ranked
13th, and moving up.
Injuries have already taken
their toll on the Stanford women,
however.
"We lost some upperclassmen
to chronic injuries that forced
them to retire," Greenwood said.
Sophomore Erin McCann has not
been competing to her full ability
from the start of the season due to
a sprained ankle and a stress frac
ture. McCann competed on the
bars Saturday, earning a score of
9.0 points, without a dismount.
"Once Erin starts fully compet
ing again, she can be earning
scores from 9.6 to 9.75 on the
bars," Greenwood said. Because of
their problems with ii\juries, they
have been forced to look a lot more
to the whole team, especially the
freshman. Of the seven gymnasts,
five of them compete in all
around, while only two specialize.
Overall, the coaching staff
seemed very pleased with Satur
day night's performance.
