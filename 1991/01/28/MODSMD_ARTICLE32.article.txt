# No. 1 Card nine opens season with two wins over SCU

### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
They were still talking about
football this weekend in New
York, but at Stanford's Sunken
Diamond the topic has switched to
baseball, the early arrival of
spring and the top-ranked Cardi
nal.
While the Buffalo Bills were
taking an early lead in the Super
Bowl Sunday, Stanford was com
pleting a season-opening sweep of
peninsula rival Santa Clara. Stan-

ford blasted the Broncos 7-3 at
Sunken Diamond Friday, but had
to come from behind for a 5-4 vic
tory yesterday at Santa Clara's
Buck Shaw Stadium.
"I'm very pleased, I saw some
good things, especially the pitch
ing" said Stanford coach Mark

Marquess, who will be deciding on
his pitching rotation and bullpen
in the next two weeks.
Stanford's offense was a known
factor coming into the season —
the Cardinal returns six starters
— but the big question mark is
pitching. Senior right-hander
John Reid and sophomore right
hander Jamie Sepeda started
Stanford's first two games and
have the inside edge for two of the
three spots in the starting rota
tion. ,
Reid allowed just two hits in 6

2/3 innings to record the victory
Friday, and Sepeda allowed no
earned runs in 4 1/3 innings yes
terday.
"Sepeda pitched extremely well
and would nave had a shutout if
we made some plays behind him.
(Aaron) Dorlarque had good pop
on his fastball before he got a little
tired, and (Scott) Weiss came in
and got the job done," said Mar
quess after yesterday's win.
Without an offensive spark in
the final two innings at Santa
Clara, the good pitching would
have been for naught. Shortstop
Roger Burnett doubled home
Chris Kemper in the eighth to
break a 2-2 tie. But in the bottom
half of the eighth the Broncos ral
lied for two runs and the lead off

Dorlarque and freshman Andrew
Lorraine. Without help from
catcher Troy Tallman, who threw
out two runners on the bases, the
damage would have been much
worse.
Lorraine, a left-handed fresh
man from Valencia, Calif., pitched
well in his Sunken Diamond
debut, allowing one hit in 1 1/3
innings of relief to record the save.
Yet he was shaky in his second
appearance, allowing the go-ahead
run to score on a wild pitch in the
eighth.
With Stanford trailing 4-3, left
fielder Ryan Turner led off the
ninth by launching a home run
over the 400-foot sign in center
field. Three walks and a force-out
later, Jeff DesJardins scored the

go-ahead run on a groundout to
shortstop by Steve Solomon.
"Offensively we got the big hits
when we needed them, but we
haven't been hitting the ball all
that hard," Marquess said.
"(David) McCarty isn't hitting it
like he will, and (Jeffrey) Ham
monds and Turner will hit better."
In Friday's opener at Sunken
Diamond, sophomore Hammonds,
who stole 48 bases last year as
Stanford's leadofT man, responded
quite appropriately to his new role
as Stanford's cleanup hitter. Play
ing designated hitter to rest a sore
knee, Hammonds rocketed a 3-2
change-up over the left-field
fence. His two-run home run
broke up Santa Clara starter
David Tuttle's shutout in the
fourth inning and Stanford never
trailed.
"Last year I was a freshman
from the East Coast and I kind of
snuck up on people," said Ham
monds, the NCAA Freshman of
the Year. "This year I won't be
able to do that, the pitchers will be
ready."
"Coach has moved me to clean
up so I can come up in RBI situa
tions," Hammonds continued.
"That's what I'm in there for. But
everybody else can do that too (hit
a home run). You have to give the
credit to the whole lineup, one
through nine."
In the eighth inning, Tallman
fisted a two-run single into left
field that put the game out of
reach. The hit scored Hammonds
and Turner, who had each singled
following a leadoff walk to
McCarty.
Meanwhile, Reid retired the
first 13 batters he faced, before
Santa Clara outfielder Mark
Lewis upset the perfect game with
an infield single. Reid was 7-1 last
