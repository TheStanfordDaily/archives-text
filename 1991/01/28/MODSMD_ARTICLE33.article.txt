# Men's gymnastics batters Badgers
## 
### Noah Blake Staff writer 
In a performance not unlike
that of the New York Giants on
Super Bowl Sunday, the Wis
consin men's gymnastics team
kept thingß close throughout
most of last Saturday's dual
meet with the Cardinal at
Burham Pavilion. But unlike
their favored counterparts, the
Buffalo Bills, the Stanford
team was able to pull out the
victory, 275.90 to 270.90, in an
exciting contest.

Men's Gymnastics

Cardinal 275.90

Badgers 270.90

Although they never trailed,
the Cardinal did not enjoy a
comfortable lead until the last
rotation, when the team per
formed well on the parallel
bars while the Badgers fell
apart. Stanford swept the top
three places in that final event,
just as they had earlier done on
the high bar.
Sophomore All-American
Jair Lynch, the all-around
champion, won the high bar
and tied Cardinal freshman
Jeff Bender for first on the par

allel bars, but his most impres
sive performance by far was on
the pommel horse. There he
garnered a 9.75, with which he
beat the field by a full half
point.
Continuing to impress was
freshman Marc Booth, who fin
ished second in the all-around
for the third week in a row.
Booth won the vault with a
9.50, and in doing so bolstered
the team's performance in one
of the two events that the Car
dinal has been having diffi
culty. The other event, the
ringß, was the only event in
which Stanford did not place a
gymnast first, although fresh
man Chris Sey did finish sec
ond with a 9.40.
Junior Tim Ryan, compet
ing in his first meet for the
Cardinal since he sustained a
serious wrist injury in the mid
dle of last season, performed
only on the rings and the floor,
but was not ready for all
around competition.
After two straight dual-meet
victories at home, the team will
face New Mexico State, UC-
Santa Barbara and host Arizona
State in the Valley of the Sun
this weekend before hosting a
Bay Area affair with both Cali
fornia and San Jose State, in
addition to Kent State, Feb. 9.
