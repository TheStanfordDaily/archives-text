# Stanford sweeps Utah
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
There were no yellow ribbons
nor any tickertape parades to wel
come Kylie Johnson back to the
Stanford Tennis Stadium Friday.
Nevertheless, the Cardinal s
home opener against Utah was a
special homecoming for the Stan
ford junior.

er road back took a nasty turn
last summer when she suffered a
severe ankle injury. Three metal
rods were inserted in Johnson's
lower leg to repair two broken
bones and the initial prognosis
was that she wouldn't play tennis
again until July.
Yet there she stood Friday,
looking across the net at an old
adversary, the Utes' Susie Costa.
If she had scanned the other
courts, Johnson would have seen
a lot of faimiliar faces. She is from
Salt Lake City and played junior
tennis against many members of
the Utah team.
But sentiment was not on
Johnson's mind — winning was.
And, without a great deal of diffi
culty, she dispatched Costa 6-3, 6-
1 to help the Cardinal rout the
Utes 9-0 and up the team's record
to 2-0.
"My movement is not up to par
yet," Johnson said afterward.
"Mentally, not having played in
six months you have to re-leam
concentration and competition."
Said Stanford coach Frank
Brennan: "Kylie is not all the way
back yet. But she made a break

through today, winning the first
game and the first set." Brennan
explained that in preseason tour
naments, Johnson's big problem
had been starting slowly.
"She's just not match tough
and her ankle is still not 100 per
cent in every way," he said. But
Brennan expressed optimism
about Johnson. "She is hitting the
ball real well. She's going to make
a mqjor contribution this year.
She's back."
Said Johnson: "Last year
wasn't my best year. Maybe some
good can come out of [the time
off]. When I was forced not to play,
I realized how much 1 did enjoy it.
I see things going really well in the
future."
As should the rest of the Cardi
nal. In 18 sets of action, the Cardi
nal dropped just 35 games. Debbie
Graham headlined the Stanford
attack with a 6-4, 6-1 win over
Julie Kempin. With Sandra Birch
sitting out, Teri Whitlinger scored
a decisive 6-4, 6-0 victory in her
No. 2 match against Alison Brad
ford.
Heather Willens dissected
Ruth Ann Stevens 6-2, 6-1; Mario
Carruth handled Stephanie Ball
6-2, 6-0; and Laxmi Poruri had a
successful Cardinal debut with a
6-1, 6-3 triumph over Sharla
Barone.
The doubles went similarly to
the singles. Birch and Graham
trailed briefly but had little trou
ble mounting a victorious come
back over Bradford and Stevens,
6-4, 6-3. Poruri and Whitlinger
defeated Barone and Kempin 6-2,
6-1. And, Willens teamed with
Emma Woodhouse to knock off
Ball and Becky Huereque, 6-2, 6-
1.
Card notes
Stanford's next action is Wednes
day against the University of the
Pacific. The match begins at 1:30 p.m.
