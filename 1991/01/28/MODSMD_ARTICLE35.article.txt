# Swimmers take two
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Starting where they finished
up last season, the Cardinal
women's swim team posted a pair
of big victories against Pacific 10
Conference rivals. Stanford, the
nation's second-ranked team,
topped No. 17 Arizona State 203-
94 Friday and beat No. 16 Arizona
197-103 Saturday.
Stanford is now 5-0 on the sea
son and 2-0 against the Pac-10.
M I would describe [the meets]
as solid," junior Karen Kraemer
said. "We were really tired and
rushed from the trip. Everyone
was sharp but we were tired so the
times weren't as great."
Sophomore Janel Jorgensen
and freshman Summer Sanders
won three events each to lead
Stanford to the win Friday. Jor
gensen took the 200-yard
freestyle, the 100 freestyle and
the 100 butterfly while Sanders
took the 200 butterfly, the 200
backstroke and the 200 individual
medley.
Jorgensen and classmate Lori

Heisick posted NCAA qualifying
times in the 200 freestyle and the
200 breaststroke, respectively.
Saturday, Kraemer, Jorgensen
and Eileen Richetelli tallied two
victories apiece to pace the Cardi
nal. Kraemer won the 1000 and
500 freestyles, Jorgensen took the
200 butterfly and the 200 IM and
Richetelli won both diving events.
Heisick posted an NCAA quali
fying time in winning the 100
breaststroke Saturday. In addi
tion, Michelle Griglione and J.T.
Toton joined Heisick as double
winners for the weekend.
Stanford went easy on the
Wildcats as many Cardinal swim
mers didn't swim their best
events and world champions
Sanders and Janet Evans both
didn't swim.
But despite that handicap, and
a brutal travel schedule, Stanford
prevailed with ease. The team left
campus at 5:30 Friday morning
and after landing in Arizona, went
straight to the pool in Tempe.
Then, after a second meet 22
hours later, the team flew back
here late Saturday afternoon.
