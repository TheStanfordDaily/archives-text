### Brian Egan Staff writer 
The Stanford wrestling team,
led by a balanced overall effort,
defeated Humboldt State Friday,
and placed an encouraging third
in the All-California Invitational
Saturday.
Friday night, the Cardinal
demolished the Lumbeijacks, a
traditional wrestling rival, by
the score of 41-8.
Sophomore Phil No wick set
the tone for Stanford early in the
match. A 118-pounder, Nowick
scored two near falls and held a
riding time advantage of almost
five minutes in winning by a
score of 13-2. It was Nowick's
second consecutive decisive vic
tory, and coach Chris Horpel was
pleased. "Phil has become a
much more consistent wrestler,
and I'm beginning to expect
more and more from him."
At 134 pounds, Lance John
son scored his fourth fall on the
year with a last minute pin at
the end of the second period. In
doing so, the freshman defeated
one of Humboldt's team leaders,
Martin Cisneros (12-3 on the
year).

Cardinal defeats Lumberjacks,

takes third at tourney

onslaught for the Cardinal at
142. Tne senior picked up his
second technical fall on the year,
with an 18-2 win with 38 sec
onds left in period two.
An ailing Steve Yarbrough
was a gritty 12-2 winner in the
177-pound duel. Yarbrough,
while not at full strength, was in
control the entire match, slam
ming his opponent on the mat
several times while picking up
his team-leading 23rd victory.
Junior Mark Graham re
corded his tenth win of the year
in a 16-0 technical fall decision
at 190 pounds. Graham was in
charge from the start, scoring 14
near-fall points in less than two
periods.
Stanford improved to 3-3-1 in
dual meets, while Humboldt
dropped to 9-4-0.
On Saturday, the team wres
tled minus the services of Now
ick, Yarbrough and 158-pound
junior Matt Topham. Without
the three starters, Horpel admit

ted that "realistically, [Stan
ford's] chances of an overall
meet victory were slim."
However, several backups
were impressive. At 118, Ramy
Saad made his varsity debut for
the Cardinal. The freshman was
a 14-2 winner in his first match,
and finished the day with a 2-2
record.
Horpel was pleasantly sur
prised. "Saad looked pretty
good," said the 1975 Stanford
graduate. "He displayed a lot of
fighting spirit out there."
Loren Vigil, a 134-pounder,
returned to the mats after a two
year hiatus due to a painful knee
injury. He picked up a victory,
and according to Horpel, "dis
played the same mental tough
ness that he always had."
Steve Buddie was absolutely
dominating in winning the 167-
pound class. The senior All-
American's three victories
included two pins and a win by
the score of 19-5 over Bill Peder
sen of San Francisco State in the
finals. Buddie improved his
record to 21-2-0.
Graham won the 190-pound
tourney without any problems.
The junior is naturally a 177-
pounder, but Horpel indicated

that he had no intentions of
moving him down a weight class,
even in the absence of
Yarbrough.
"Mark has been doing really
well against the bigger weights,"
said the coach. He's really
impressed me at 100."
Graham improved to 13-4-0.
Jay Jackson wrestled well at
126. The freshman scored his
third pin of the year in his first
match, then lost a sudden death
heartbreaker in the next round.
His record stands at 13-11-0.
At 134, Johnson was the vic
tim of a tough draw, splitting his
four decisions. The freshman,
forced to face an All-American
from Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo
in the second round, brought his
record on the season to 13-7-0.
Saturday, the team faces
Chico State at Chico. Horpel
gives the Wildcats a slight edge
in the event. "They're a tough
team, and they've beaten us in
five or six classes at tourna
ments this year. If we're going to
win it, our lightweights will have
to make the difference."
The match will begin at 7:30
p.m. in Chico.
