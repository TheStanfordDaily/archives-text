# Minority administrator victim of budget crunch

### Cecilia Tom Editorial staff 
Many in the Chicano/Latino community
at Stanford are protesting the University's
decision to close the Office of Mexican-
American Affairs and lay off its director
Fernando de Necochea, effective April 1.
Raymond Bacchetti, vice provost and
acting vice president for planning and man
agement, said he made the decision to close
the office for budget reasons.
Fernando Alegria, an emeritus professor
in the humanities, called the University's
decision "an affront to the Hispanic com
munity" and a great damage to Stanford.
De Necochea, assistant provost and
adviser to University President Donald
Kennedy on Chicano affairs since 1980, is
the only Latino administrator in the
provost's office and one of very few in the
entire University.

Robert Trujillo, curator of the Mexican-
American collection at Green Library, said
it is "awfully ironic" that the most visible
office representing the Latino community
is being cut.
Many view the decision as a setback for
progress on the University Committee on
Minority Issues report that was released in
April 1989. From 1987 to 1989, De
Necochea staffed and provided administra
tive support for the UCMI committee,
which undertook an extensive review of the
status and experience of minorities at Stan
ford.
Bacchetti said one driving force of reposi
tioning is decentralization and reducing the
work done in the president's and provost's
offices. He maintained that the decision to
close the Mexican-American Affairs Office
had been "handled evenhandedly."
He added it is unfortunate that
De Necochea occupies a position
"we believe we can do without."
De Necochea and his office cost
the University $100,000 per year,
Bacchetti said.
De Necochea expressed regret
at the University's decision, say
ing his position "is needed for all
the reasons described in the
UCMI report."
But he said he hopes to stay at
Stanford in another position "to
continue working on some of
these (Latino) problems and
issues."
Kennedy called the decision a
personnel matter and declined to
comment further.
De Necochea's duties are not
limited to Mexican-American
Affairs. He managed the task
force that implemented the Cul
tures, Ideas and Values program,
staffed the president's advisory
committee on a proposed Reagan
library and helped institute the
Stanford-in-Washington program.

Many students and faculty
members praised De Necochea for
his extensive knowledge on
Latino affairs and his ability to
secure outside resources for vari
ous projects on campus.
Trujillo said De Necochea was
instrumental in obtaining a num
ber of gift collections for the
library. With De Necochea's office
closed, Trujillo is worried that
Stanford will lose its "institu
tional commitment" that attracts
donors in the first place.
Hence, he is drafting a letter to
Kennedy urging him to keep both
De Necochea and the office, Tru
jillo said.
Several Latino student leaders
have already written a letter to
Kennedy demanding an "immedi
ate reversal" of his decision.
Senior Michael Canul, who works
in De Necochea's office, said pro
grams such as the Stanford His
panic Student Leadership Project
that he heads are in "serious jeop
ardy" if the office is closed.
"Latino students will fight for
all the resources that they've
worked for and make the Univer
sity accountable for all the
promises it has made "
