# Minority administrator victim of budget crunch

Many in the Chicano/Latino community
at Stanford are protesting the University's
decision to close the Office of Mexican-
American Affairs and lay off its director
Fernando de Necochea, effective April 1.
Raymond Bacchetti, vice provost and
acting vice president for planning and man
agement, said he made the decision to close
the office for budget reasons.
Fernando Alegria, an emeritus professor
in the humanities, called the University's
decision "an affront to the Hispanic com
munity" and a great damage to Stanford.
De Necochea, assistant provost and
adviser to University President Donald
Kennedy on Chicano affairs since 1980, is
the only Latino administrator in the
provost's office and one of very few in the
entire University.

Robert Trujillo, curator of the Mexican-
American collection at Green Library, said
it is "awfully ironic" that the most visible
office representing the Latino community
is being cut.
Many view the decision as a setback for
progress on the University Committee on
Minority Issues report that was released in
April 1989. From 1987 to 1989, De
Necochea staffed and provided administra
tive support for the UCMI committee,
which undertook an extensive review of the
status and experience of minorities at Stan
ford.
Bacchetti said one driving force of reposi
tioning is decentralization and reducing the
work done in the president's and provost's
offices. He maintained that the decision to
close the Mexican-American Affairs Office
had been "handled evenhandedly."
