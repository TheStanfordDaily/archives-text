# No room for compromise in Singapore, Lee says
## 
### Mike Laris Staff writer 
When asked what his greatest
accomplishment was in over 30
years as prime minister of Singa
pore, Lee Kuan Yew replied, with
out hesitation, "That there is a
Singapore."
Lee is a member of Stanford's
International Advisory Commit
tee and was here last week for the
council's inaugural meeting.
He left his position as prime
minister last year, but still holds
the position of senior minister.
With Lee's guidance, the tiny
island city-state of Singapore has
been transformed into one of the
fastest growing economies in
South East Asia.
But Stanford scholars say Lee's
development model for Singapore
emphasizes economic growth
rather than increased political
freedoms. In October 1990, Lee
restricted the foreign press in Sin
gapore. There is only minuscule
opposition within the country's
parliament, and universities are
tightly controlled.
Singapore has developed eco
nomically under a siege mentality.
"For the last 45 years, the
threat was communism," Lee said
in an interview with The Daily.
"But there will be new problems:
minorities, dissidents, regional
and ancient feuds over scarce
resources."
Lee said Western conceptions
of democracy are inappropriate

for Singapore
because it has a
small Muslim mi
nority, as well as
a small number
of other minor
ities. Ethnic Chi
nese make up 77
percent of the
population.
Lee said there

are irreconcilable racial, linguistic
and religious divisions in his coun
try. For example, Lee said, "We
have dispatched a medical team of
30 [to the Persian Gulf to aid the
Allied forces.] I would have
thought everybody would support
that. I was wrong.
"We have 15 percent who are
Muslims in Singapore They
are pro-Iraqis. And indeed, one
political party claiming to repre
sent ... all Malay Muslims is
offering themselves as volunteers
to fight for Iraq. My approach is,
'By all means.' If that is the way
they feel about it,... good luck to
them. Can you reconcile that? Is
there ground for compromise?"
"You may say that (the minori
ties comprise) a small percentage
of the population, but if you have
a cleavage of that nature in Singa
pore, where our neighbors are
Muslim majorities, with Chinese
minorities, that is an explosive sit
uation," he said.
Lee compared the ethnic and
religious divisions in Singapore to
those in Lebanon and South
Africa.
