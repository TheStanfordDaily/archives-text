# Health experts cite insurance availability as major problem
## 
### Sarah Morisseau Staff writer 
A wide range of health experts discussed
problems and solutions for the present
state of U.S. health care at Stanford's
annual You Can Make a Difference confer
ence Saturday. The conference focused on
"Health and the Underserved."
The forum featured speeches and panels
discussing the potential for change in the
nation's health care system. The all-day
conference began with a speech from
Woodrow Meyers, commissioner of the New
York City Department of Health, and closed
with comments from U.S. Surgeon General
Antonia Novello.
According to speakers, most health pro
fessionals believe many people's inaccessi

bility to insurance is the main problem with
U.S. health care. Thirty-seven million
Americans, one-sixth of whom are Califor
nians, are without any health insurance.
Eighty percent of the uninsured are work
ing-class individuals and their families.
"That is amoral in a country called
America," said Sen. John Rockefeller, D-W.
Va., in his afternoon address.
Chair of the bipartisan Pepper Commis
sion on Health Care, a congressional group
charged with the task of examining the U.S.
health care system, Rockefeller presented a
$23 billion plan which would require indi
vidual companies to provide health insur
ance for their workers.
"We want to help people," Rockefeller
said, slamming his fist on the
podium.
"National health insurance
has appeal, but it's just a quick
fix," he said, adding that univer
sal health care coverage is finan
cially unrealistic because it
wastes billions of dollars in cost
shifting.
Dr. Charles Plows, president of
the California Medical Associa
tion, called the crisis a "cycle of
doom."
"Trauma centers and emer
gency rooms are closing," he said.
"Nurses are overworked, ambu
lances have to search for an open
emergency room. You dial 9-1-1
and there's no place to go."
"It's a tragedy and we have to
do something about it,"he added.
Maryann O'Sullivan, executive
director of Health Access, an
organization that pushes for
health insurance for all Californi
ans, echoed his comments. "The
crisis is so bad there's no way it
can get worse," she said.

She charged that insurance
companies have refused to cover
people simply because they were
15 pounds overweight, because
they once belonged to Alcoholics
Anonymous, because they'd been
through psychotherapy, had high
blood pressure or had a sexually
transmitted disease within the
last 10 years.
"They have even started refus
ing insurance for people in partic
ular occupations, she said, not
ing among them hotel and restau
rant workers, interior designers,
florists and car salesmen. "We
asked them, 'Why car salesmen?'
and they said, 'Because you just
can't trust those people,"' she
said.
U.S. Surgeon General Antonia
Novello closed the conference on a
different note, with a speech on
women, children and AIDS, focus
ing on the need for public service.
"Our goal is to grasp as much
as we can and make a difference,"
she said, encouraging students to
volunteer time and effort to vari
ous organizations.
