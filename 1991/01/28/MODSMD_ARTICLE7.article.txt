# Homes on Row to be destroyed
## 
### Dylan Tyson Staff writer 
For almost a century, the Delta
Tau Delta fraternity has been
housed on San Juan Hill, over
looking the Theta Xi house. But
the 1989 Earthquake forced the
Delts to abandon their house and
disperse throughout campus. This
year, they've lived in 553 May
field, hoping to return to the hill.
But University administrators
just sent the Delts a memoran
dum indicating that won't hap
pen.
The earthquake-damaged Row
houses, in which Synergy, Delta
Tau Delta and Phi Psi (now the
Enchanted Broccoli Forest) once
lived, will be torn down and
replaced by new faculty housing,
according to the memorandum,
which cited rising repair costs and
high maintenance for the deci
sion.
Some of the proceeds from the
sale of the new faculty houses will
be used to build new student
housing.
"It's pretty obvious that we're
disappointed," said Delt President
Rob Robbins, a senior. "There's a
lot of tradition. We've been on the
hill for about 100 years."
The University originally
intended to repair the houses and
ready them for occupancy in the
fall of 1991.
However, "the cost to repair
the houses is clearly going to be
higher than we estimated it to
be," according to Keith Guy, direc
tor of Housing and Food Service
The original estimate for the
repair of the three damaged Row
houses was $3 million. In light of
higher-than-expected repair costs
for Columbae, Theta Xi, Roth and
Durand houses, which were fixed
last year, the estimate for the
repair of the damaged Row houses
has been re-evaluated and deter
mined to be $4.5 million.
Thus, instead of repairing the
current facilities, the University
will build and sell faculty housing
on the land. The land value from
the sales will be credited to the
Housing and Food Service system

to be applied toward the cost of
new housing.
The estimate of the net worth
of the residual land value is about
$7 million, according to Guy.
The fraternity and co-ops
which resided in the damaged
Row houses will continue to exist
and be housed. The ftiture loca
tion of the groups, both short- and
long-term, is going to be reviewed
by a committee chaired by Row
Director Jack Chin and Housing
Center Director Roger Whitney,
Guy said.
These committees will include
student input from the affected
groups.
