## Saddam warns U.S. of nuclear capabilities

D HAH RAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) — Saddam
Hussein yesterday raised the specter of chemi
cal-biological warfare — and even nuclear
weapons — in Iraq's fateful confrontation with
the U.S. superpower. Meanwhile, scores more
of his air force pilots were slipping out the back
door to Iran.
CNN's Peter Arnett, who interviewed the
Iraqi president, said Saddam claimed that the
missiles his military has fired at Saudi Arabia
and Israel have chemical, biological and
nuclear capability.
Out in the Persian Gulfs blackened waters,
meanwhile, the mammoth crude-oil slick that
began pouring from Iraqi-held Kuwait early
last week now totals some 460 million gallons,
Saudi officials reported. That is almost three
times the size of the world's largest previous
spill, from a Mexican well blowout in the Gulf
of Mexico in 1979.
In New York, aided by an inflammatory let
ter from Iraq, the United States and its allies
quashed a bid by Third World nations for the
U.N. Security Council to debate a cease-fire in
the Persian Gulf war.
U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering said
a letter from Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz
to U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar was "a bombshell in the middle of the
council" that blocked discussion of peace.
The letter accused Perez de Cuellar and the
Security Council of direct responsibility for the
war on Iraq. The council set the Jan. 15 dead
line that ordered Iraq to withdraw from
Kuwait or face attack.
Last night, Iraq launched its seventh missile
attack on Israel, and parts of a Scud rocket
landed on Arab villages in the occupied West
Bank, military officials and the state radio
reported.
There were no immediate reports of
injuries, and apparently no U.S.-made Patriot
missile was fired to intercept the Scud.
It was the first reported hit in the West
