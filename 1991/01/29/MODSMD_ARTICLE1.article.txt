# WAR IN THE GULF
## Saddam warns U.S. of nuclear capabilities 
### 
D HAH RAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) — Saddam
Hussein yesterday raised the specter of chemi
cal-biological warfare — and even nuclear
weapons — in Iraq's fateful confrontation with
the U.S. superpower. Meanwhile, scores more
of his air force pilots were slipping out the back
door to Iran.
CNN's Peter Arnett, who interviewed the
Iraqi president, said Saddam claimed that the
missiles his military has fired at Saudi Arabia
and Israel have chemical, biological and
nuclear capability.
Out in the Persian Gulfs blackened waters,
meanwhile, the mammoth crude-oil slick that
began pouring from Iraqi-held Kuwait early
last week now totals some 460 million gallons,
Saudi officials reported. That is almost three
times the size of the world's largest previous
spill, from a Mexican well blowout in the Gulf
of Mexico in 1979.
In New York, aided by an inflammatory let
ter from Iraq, the United States and its allies
quashed a bid by Third World nations for the
U.N. Security Council to debate a cease-fire in
the Persian Gulf war.
U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering said
a letter from Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz
to U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar was "a bombshell in the middle of the
council" that blocked discussion of peace.
The letter accused Perez de Cuellar and the
Security Council of direct responsibility for the
war on Iraq. The council set the Jan. 15 dead
line that ordered Iraq to withdraw from
Kuwait or face attack.
Last night, Iraq launched its seventh missile
attack on Israel, and parts of a Scud rocket
landed on Arab villages in the occupied West
Bank, military officials and the state radio
reported.
There were no immediate reports of
injuries, and apparently no U.S.-made Patriot
missile was fired to intercept the Scud.
It was the first reported hit in the West
Bank, where Arabs have shown
support for Iraqi President Sad
dam Hussein. Some reportedly
have applauded his earlier missile
raids from their rooftops.
The dozens of Scuds launched
thus far have carried only conven
tional warheads. The Iraqis have
chemical and biological weapons,
but Western analysts question
whether Iraq is technically capa
ble of equipping missiles with
such warheads.
As for nuclear warheads, some
analysts believed before the Per
sian Gulf war broke out that Iraq
was a year or two from developing
a primitive atomic weapon. But
the U.S. military says its recent
air attacks eliminated the Iraqi
nuclear network.
As recounted by CNN's Arnett,
Saddam skirted the question of
whether the Iraqis would use
uncoventional weapons.
"Iraq will use weapons that
equate the weapons used against
us," Arnett quoted Saddam as
saying. "All the air superiority .. .
that has come upon us has failed.
We have maintained our balance,
using only conventional weap
ons.
But, Arnett said, the Iraqi
leader then suggested Baghdad
might be "forced" to take drastic
action.
"We pray that not a lot of blood
will be shed from any nation," he
quoted him as saying. "We pray
that we shall not be forced in tak

ing a forced measure."
Baghdad radio, meanwhile,
issued a more direct threat about
what it called "strategic weap
ons."
"What will emerge from these
days when these weapons are
used is more tragic days for the

allied forces," the broadcast said.
In another development, the
Iraqi radio also said captured
Operation Desert Storm pilots
have been injured in air attacks
staged by their comrades on "pop
ulated and civilian targets in
Iraq."

The Baghdad government now
says more than 320 civilians have
been killed in Desert Storm air
raids. Refugees fleeing Iraq said
warplanes of the anti-Iraq coali
tion had bombed civilian convoys
on the desert highway west from
Baghdad to Jordan.
