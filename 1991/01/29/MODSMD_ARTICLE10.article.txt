# U.S. military's high-tech reliance questioned
## 
### Marci Shore 
The U.S. military's reliance on high-tech
gadgetry in the Persian Gulf may inspire con
fidence in the armed forces, but it worries a
group of computer scientists dedicated to
warning people of the dangers of such a depen
dence.
The group, Computer Professionals for
Social Responsibility, formed in Palo Alto in
1981 in response to the possibility of error and
human abuse in military weapons systems.
The group is "a voice that takes a stand on
public issues with the background of profes
sional knowledge," explained member Terry
Winograd, a Stanford computer science profes
sor.
The organization is now a powerful
national organization with more than 2,600
members in the United States and around the
world, serving as a watchdog against the mili
tary's over-reliance on computer systems.
"Intrinsic in systems of that complexity is
that they will have errors," said Eric Roberts,
a Stanford associate professor of computer sci
ence and president of the organization. "Some
thing may be wrong with [a computer-con
trolled weapons system], and that may come
back to haunt you in the future."
Winograd added, "Computers in warfare
give us an unrealistic optimism. The feeling
that all these high-tech weapons (are) going to
win this war is fantasy."
The group's primary focus during its initial
years was the use of computers in nuclear
weapons systems, Roberts said.
The fighting capacity of the United States
and the Soviet Union, compounded by the
over-reliance on computers in the military,
potentially could result in an accidental launch
— particularly when tensions between the
superpowers are high, Roberts said.
Early-warning radar systems, for example,

are known for their unreliability, dramatized
in a 1959 incident in which the rising moon
was interpreted as a Soviet missile launch, he
added.
During the early- to mid-1980s, the profes
sional group devoted much of its energy
toward researching the Strategic Defense Ini
tiative and "pointing out the fallacies," Wino
grad said.
After 1986, the organization expanded its
focus into issues of privacy and civil liberties.
"What happens when the government (or) pri
vate agencies start to collect huge amounts of
information?" Roberts asked. Computer falli
bility and misuse could lead to erroneous
arrests and other unjustified invasions of pri
vacy, he said.
Currently, the group channels its energies
into three areas: risk and reliability of military
computing, civil liberties and computers in the
workplace.
Last spring, the group sponsored a confer
ence in Seattle on "participatory design," a
concept which would require computer scien
tists to work more closely with users when
designing computer systems.
Roberts attributes many failures in the
computer systems design process, and conse
quently many problems experienced by users,
to a lack of communication between designers
and workers.
Roberts said the organization is not a lobby
ing group or political action committee. As a
non-profit organization, it is prevented under
government restrictions from channeling very
much of its resource pool into lobbying efforts.
The group is "fairly academic in focus,"
Roberts said. "We don't have an activist core. .
. . We tend not to take any stand on things that
don't involve computers."
"We have power through ideas, not pres
sure," Winograd said. "Our basic goal is to cre
ate . .. public awareness," he added.

In 1988, Rep. Don Edwards, chair of the
House Subcommittee on Civil and Constitu
tional Rights, asked the group to participate in
a panel evaluating the National Crime Infor
mation Center.
This FBI database collects and makes avail
able information from local jurisdictions on
arrests, thefts and other criminal activity.
Requests for the database numbered over
500,000 daily, and the FBI saw the need to
upgrade the system. The government agency
proposed a mqjor increase in capacity, giving
the database the ability to track people from
place to place, even those not charged with a
specific crime.
But the computer professionals protested
the move, saying it would "construct a large
network over the United States that would
help find people," Roberts explained. "The
civil liberties implications are too profound,"
he said.
Largely because of strong opposition from
computer scientists, the FBI dropped the pro
posal.
Currently, the organization is opposing the
release of "Household Marketplace." This pro
gram, produced by the Lotus Corp., would con
tain "detailed personal information on Ameri
can consumers, including name, address, age,
sex, marital status and buying habits," accord
ing to a press release from the group.
"We saw this as a real invasion of privacy,"
Roberts said. "Information collected for one
purpose should not be used for a completely
separate purpose."
Winograd warns that a change in govern
ment could lead to pressure for the increased
use of computers for surveillance, a possibility
his organization is trying to prevent.
"The future is full of dangers," he predicts.
"The whole question of [George Orwell's
novel] '1984' is passed by date but is still here
as a concept."

are known for their unreliability, dramatized
in a 1959 incident in which the rising moon
was interpreted as a Soviet missile launch, he
added.
During the early- to mid-1980s, the profes
sional group devoted much of its energy
toward researching the Strategic Defense Ini
tiative and "pointing out the fallacies," Wino
grad said.
After 1986, the organization expanded its
focus into issues of privacy and civil liberties.
"What happens when the government (or) pri
vate agencies start to collect huge amounts of
information?" Roberts asked. Computer falli
bility and misuse could lead to erroneous
arrests and other unjustified invasions of pri
vacy, he said.
Currently, the group channels its energies
into three areas: risk and reliability of military
computing, civil liberties and computers in the
workplace.
Last spring, the group sponsored a confer
ence in Seattle on "participatory design," a
concept which would require computer scien
tists to work more closely with users when
designing computer systems.
Roberts attributes many failures in the
computer systems design process, and conse
quently many problems experienced by users,
to a lack of communication between designers
and workers.
Roberts said the organization is not a lobby
ing group or political action committee. As a
non-profit organization, it is prevented under
government restrictions from channeling very
much of its resource pool into lobbying efforts.
The group is "fairly academic in focus,"
Roberts said. "We don't have an activist core. .
. . We tend not to take any stand on things that
don't involve computers."
"We have power through ideas, not pres
sure," Winograd said. "Our basic goal is to cre
ate . .. public awareness," he added.

In 1988, Rep. Don Edwards, chair of the
House Subcommittee on Civil and Constitu
tional Rights, asked the group to participate in
a panel evaluating the National Crime Infor
mation Center.
This FBI database collects and makes avail
able information from local jurisdictions on
arrests, thefts and other criminal activity.
Requests for the database numbered over
500,000 daily, and the FBI saw the need to
upgrade the system. The government agency
proposed a mqjor increase in capacity, giving
the database the ability to track people from
place to place, even those not charged with a
specific crime.
But the computer professionals protested
the move, saying it would "construct a large
network over the United States that would
help find people," Roberts explained. "The
civil liberties implications are too profound,"
he said.
Largely because of strong opposition from
computer scientists, the FBI dropped the pro
posal.
Currently, the organization is opposing the
release of "Household Marketplace." This pro
gram, produced by the Lotus Corp., would con
tain "detailed personal information on Ameri
can consumers, including name, address, age,
sex, marital status and buying habits," accord
ing to a press release from the group.
"We saw this as a real invasion of privacy,"
Roberts said. "Information collected for one
purpose should not be used for a completely
separate purpose."
Winograd warns that a change in govern
ment could lead to pressure for the increased
use of computers for surveillance, a possibility
his organization is trying to prevent.
"The future is full of dangers," he predicts.
"The whole question of [George Orwell's
novel] '1984' is passed by date but is still here
as a concept."
