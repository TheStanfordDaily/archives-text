Mandela-Buthelezi talks raise hopes for peace
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) — After months of bit
ter quarreling, rivals Nelson Mandela and Mangosuthu Buthelezi
are to come together today for a meeting that has raised hopes for
reconciliation between warring supporters.
1 he meeting, however, is considered largely symbolic, and it's
unclear how much time the nation's most powerful black leaders
will spend alone together because each is traveling with a handful
of delegates.
But a friendly encounter is seen as crucial to ending years of
black faction fighting between backers of Mandela's African
National Congress and Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party.
"We do not expect miracles from today's talks, but the mere
fact these two leaders will be seen talking may cause sanity to pre
vail among their followers," said the black-oriented newspaper
City Press.
Since 1986, about 6,000 blacks have died in fighting linked to
the ANC-Inkatha feud.
Wyoming House committee kills abortion bill
CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) — A controversial bill that would
have made Wyoming's abortion law the most restrictive in the
nation was killed yesterday by a House committee.
Members of the Judiciary Committee, voting 5-4 against the
bill, agreed that the proposal was too much, too soon.
The measure, entitled the "Human Life Protection Act,"
gained quick condemnation earlier this month when it was intro
duced by Rep. Richard Honaker, D-Rock Springs.
Several days after Honaker and his co-sponsors outlined the
bill to reporters, a House faction opposed to the measure held
their own news conference to condemn the bill as contrary to indi
vidual rights.
As drafted, the bill would have outlawed abortions except in
cases where a mother's health was in jeopardy, or in cases of rape
or incest. In the latter two instances, a woman would have had to
report the crime within five days after she was able to to be eligi
ble for an abortion.
Doctors who performed abortions otherwise could be convicted
of a felony, punishable by 14 years in prison.
