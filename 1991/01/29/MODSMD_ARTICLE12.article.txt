# Moscow summit postponed
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Bush,
troubled about a long trip to Moscow in the
midst of the Persian Gulf war as well as
bogged-down talks over a strategic arms
reduction treaty, decided yesterday to put
off his scheduled Feb. 11-13 summit with
Mikhail Gorbachev.
The decision was "by mutual agree
ment" with the Kremlin, and the summit
will be rescheduled in Moscow at "a later
date in the first half of this year," according
to a joint statement of Secretary of State
James Baker 111 and Soviet Foreign Minis
ter Alexander Bessmertnykh.
Bush met with Bessmertnykh just prior
to the announcement. It was the first time
that a scheduled U.S.-Soviet summit had
been put off since the late Soviet leader
Nikita Khrushchev canceled President
Dwight D. Eisenhower's 1959 visit to
Moscow in furious objection to U.S. spy
fights over Soviet territory.
But the postponement of the Bush-Gor
bachev meeting "was a mutual decision so
there is no disappointment," Bessmert
nykh emphasized.
Standing together in a White House

driveway, Bessmertnykh first in Russian
and then Baker in English read their joint
statement.
It said: "The gulf war makes it inappro
priate for President Bush to be away from
Washington. In addition, work on the
START treaty will require some additional
time. Both presidents look forward to set
ting an exact summit date as soon as it
becomes feasible to do so."
Bush and senior administration officials
have been hinting for weeks that he would
forgo the Feb. 11-13 trip to register displea
sure with the military crackdown on the
independence movement in Latvia and
Lithuania.
But the statement did not mention the
situation in the Baltic Republics.
There was no elaboration, meanwhile,
on why it would be "inappropriate" for
Bush to be away from Washington during
the Persian Gulf war.
The President has not taken any trips —
except to his Camp David retreat in the
nearby Catoctin mountains of Maryland —
since ordering U.S. forces into action
against Iraq.
