# Women play increasing role in war

IN CENTRAL SAUDI ARABIA
(AP) — Airman Ist Class Shaun Rice
deftly screwed a small fuse into a 500-
pound bomb. Seconds later, she popped
in another. As the bombs rolled down
the assembly line, the 20-year-old pon
dered the morality of preparing
weapons of war.
God's commandment — "thou shall
not kill" — doesn't seem to apply, she
concluded.
Tech. Sgt. Hattie Monson, the crew
chief for an F-16A, lavishes loving
attention on the fighter-bomber she's
nicknamed Six, after her lucky num
ber, and agonizes every time it heads
north to pound Iraqi targets.
"We really don't think about what
our bombs are doing. We're thinking
about our airplanes and our air
crews," she said.
Though barred from flying combat
missions, women in the U.S. Air Force
are playing a bigger role than in any
past war.

From making and loading bombs to
calibrating electronic equipment,
doing combat surgery and flying cargo
runs away from the frontlines, women
have become an integral part of the air
war machine.
Some came here at great personal
sacrifice.
Staff Sgt. Pam Krolewicz-Milas left
behind her 10-month-old daughter,
two older stepchildren, and a husband
who had just been diagnosed as having
cancer to come here because she
wanted to support America.
"I'm a third generation immigrant,
and I just feel like I'm in the military,
I'm part of America, and if that's what
America wants ... I have to stand up
for it," she said.
"I'm not flying planes or out on the
flight line. But I'm still in a critical
field. You have to communicate to get
the mission completed," said the 31-
year-old South Carolina Air National
Guard reservist who is a communica

tions operator.
Monson said most of her male col
leagues in the South Carolina Guard
accept here a "a team member,"
although some still feel threatened.
She said her fighter, Six, is a prime tar
get for the men's barbs.
"Whenever she breaks, they always
say it's the wrong time of the month
for my plane. They're awful! They all
break the same," she said.
Monson never wanted to fly, but
hopes that by the next war she can
wave goodbye to the first women
fighter pilot.
Rice was repairing trailers in Ger
many before she came to Saudi Arabia
to work on bombs and missiles. She
said she has come to terms with
preparing weapons.
"God says, 'Thou shall not murder.'
I try to live my life by God's word. I feel
like I'm killing for the right of my peo
ple, my country, not for my own self
pride," she said.
