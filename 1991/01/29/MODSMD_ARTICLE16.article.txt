Stanford has wisely
retreated and hired
outside expertise

STANFORD HAS DECIDED
not to bill the federal govern
ment $500,000 for part of the
operating costs of three Univer
sity-owned residences where
research conferences and recep
tions are frequently held â€” a good
move, no doubt, because it is not
worth the confusion and explana
tion when it involves items not
immediately related to research.
It must be made clear, however,
that billing the government for
flower arrangements and caterers
is a perfectly allowable practice
under federal regulations, and
Stanford's retreat from a claim of
these expenses should not be
viewed as an acknowledgment of
wrongdoing.
Clearly, Stanford does have
some accounting problems when it
comes to indirect costs, which are
expenditures not directly
attributable to specific research
projects. The most blatant example
surfaced when it was discovered
that Stanford billed the govern
ment for the depreciation costs of
the luxury yacht Victoria.
What is important for the Uni
versity right now is to be honest
about these errors. Stanford has
admitted to the accounting prob
lem, and it should continue to open
all the books for federal auditors.
University President Donald
Kennedy has agreed to appear on
ABC's news program 20/20 to
answer some of the questions
about Stanford's indirect costs
practices.
Hopefully, he will use the oppor
tunity to clean up Stanford's
image. Although it is difficult to

explain technicalities during 30-
second soundbites, it is nonethe
less important to be up front and
as frank as possible about the
recent developments.
With the University's wise
appointment of an outside
accounting firm and a panel to
advise Kennedy on indirect cost
issues, additional controversies
will hopefully be avoided.
The panel includes distin
guished personalities Navy Adm.
Bobby Inman, former director of
the National Security Agency and
former deputy director of the Cen
tral Intelligence Agency; Rev. Tim
othy Healy, former president of
Georgetown University and cur
rent president of the New York
Public Library; and Joseph Con
ner, chair of Price Waterhouse
World Firm Ltd.
With the help of these individu
als, the University should be able
to come up with accounting proce
dures that are fair and easily verifi
able.
Of course the decision to consult
outside advisors and an indepen
dent auditing firm will be costly,
but it is money worth spending if
the University can deflect some of
the negative media attention
which it has recently received.
It is only through a clean reputa
tion that the University can hope
to secure continuous funding and
donations for its various programs
and departments.
One should avoid taking for
granted some highly sensational
ized media reports about the ongo
ing investigation here, bearing in
mind that Stanford is not the only
university under investigation for
its indirect costs practices. MIT is
in the same boat with us.
The University has made an
earnest effort to correct past mis
takes by removing certain contro
versial items from its bill to the
government. This is one step in the
right direction.
