## Coda: A dream 
### 
Hurry up please, it's time.
The fully enlightened earth radi
ates disaster triumphant.
Once we had a dream, and it went
something like this: the human race
would use its intelligence and its hands to
shape the world to its will.
Nature's dangers would be mitigated;
social inequities would be eradicated;
humanity would shake off the opiate of
religion and direct its labors towards
making this earthly existence one that
was free, happy and well-nourished. The
newly-realized powers of reason would
work to fashion a world of peace and pros
perity. A nice dream, and eminently sensi
ble.
In a relatively short span of time, this
dream kicked us from the Industrial Age
to the present Electronic/Information
Age. Along the way, though, it ran into
some problems. Along the way, some peo
ple became more free; many more didn't.
Some people became more prosperous;
many more didn't. Some people lived in
peace for extended periods of time, but
sooner or later found it to be an essen
tially transitory state; many more knew
nothing but war as the normal way of life.
In the rush for knowledge and control,
we discovered or created such neat things
as nuclear weaponry, chemicals which
corrupt the land and air which sustain us,
media which lulls us into uninterested
stupidity. Unforeseen consequences
which caught us by surprise and showed
us that all that glitters is not gold, and all
that glows is not goodness and light.
Son of man,/ You cannot say, or guess,
for you know only/A heap of broken

images, /where the sun beats,/And the
dead tree gives no shelter...
Just a short while ago, it seemed that
we had woken up to the ill effects of this
dream; times were a' changing, our bro
ken images were being refashioned into
new ones. Peace was breaking out all over,
and with the weakening of the Soviet
Union, the conflicts spawned by the
polarization of the world between two ide
ological camps seemed to be a part of his
tory.
The Iron Curtain fell, and dictators
found themselves to be an endangered
species. People began to develop a broader
consciousness, one that allowed their
nations to begin the search for common
solutions to the degradation of the envi
ronment. Rock stars, of all people, took
time out to clue everybody in to the dis
mal state of existence found in many
parts of the globe.
Yep, for a brief moment, it looked like
the dream still had something to give to
us; the future was so bright, we had to
wear shades.
But, just as we were settling back into
our lawn chairs to watch the sun go down
on the old, barbaric world in which who
was right always came in a distant second
to who had the might, along came a nasty
surprise.
HURRY UP PLEASE, IT'S TIME.
The emergent new world order got
nipped in the bud by a little big man and
big little man — mere players playing the
hand dealt to them — and we had our
selves a war. The dark side of the dream
came blithering back, the technology
wrought by our minds allowing us to kill

people even better than before.
Enlightened rationality and morality,
which seemed to be gaining the upper
hand in things, got kicked in the ass, and
we all returned to the sandlot to quibble
over who got to say where the sandcastle
would be built.
So, from where I'm standing, it looks
like we're all about as enlightened, after
300 years of effort, as a bunch of grub
worms. Our minds have made us more
efficient killers and less concerned
human beings. I guess that's an achieve
ment in some world, but not in the one I
want to be part of.
But I'm being a might dark and criti
cal, no? Perhaps the dream is still attain
able, and we are indeed progressing
towards its fulfillment — a question of
two stops forward, one step back, instead
of one step forward and two steps back.
But the feeling that we're spinning end
lessly through the same old cycle of war
reconstruction-war, trapped, dare I say, in
a world-historical rut, is hard to shake.
Is there any way out of the circle? Can
anyone spring this trap? Is there anybody
out there ?
Or, should I not ask — Is there any
body in here?
HURRY UP PLEASE, IT'S TIME.
