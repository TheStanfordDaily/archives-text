## We should always consider fresh opinions in the Gulf conflict 
### 
I AM PROUD. Proud that our nation
supports individual liberty, freedom
of expression, and equal rights under
the law. Proud that our leaders were able
to form an international coalition con
demning the invasion of Iraq, and effec
tively stopping the immediate threat to
Saudi Arabia.
And I am proud of my profession, ded
icated to the relentless process of chal
lenging conventional wisdom and hold
ing dear only those ideas which with
stand such challenge.
At times like this, we must think of
duty. To a soldier, duty seems clear-cut.
But as citizens, what is our duty? Should
we support the troops by suppressing
our independent thoughts in order to
present them with an image of unity?
Any decent person whose job it is to
kill must have faith that there is over
whelming reason to do so. Returning
home amidst belief that a war was ill
advised breeds feelings of guilt and
betrayal in those very persons who have
sacrificed so much.
But what is the best protection
against such tragedy? Our first duty is to
do what we can to make sure the soldiers
do not fight without overwhelming
cause. This cannot be accomplished
without vigorous and open debate.
Our duty as guardians of democracy is
to think through the consequences of

our actions and to examine the moral as
well as the long-term strategic implica
tions. We must reconcile emotion and
reason, knowing that we cannot be
guided by one without the other.
We must guard our most important
principles, but we must keep our minds
open to change, not by the force of popu
lar opinion, but by incorporating new
facts, feelings and thoughts.
We must resist those on both sides
who paint the whole issue as if it were
black or white, for we know what a men
tal and emotional struggle it is to sift
through the rubble of Kuwaiti women in
involuntary brothels and their husbands
tortured; parents seeing their children
depart to the Gulf, uncertain of their
return; Iraqi troops who have more to
fear from their own commanders than
from a more powerful enemy army.
But we are already at war, so it's too
late. It was and is simply a yes/no deci
sion. Or is it? Have we exhausted our
creative options for resolving the con
flict? There must be new options that
have been created in the wake of the
reduction of Iraq's fearsome military
industrial complex.
Can we let this madman save some
face without providing incentives for
others to follow his footsteps? There can
be no denying that he has already paid a
price which would give followers pause.

We know that a Middle East peace con
ference is inevitable. So why are we
afraid of linkage?
We must not leave all the decisions
from here on in the hands of the mili
tary. We cannot afford to sit by as specta
tors and watch the logical conclusion of
two inconsistent strategies pitted against
each other, resulting in the slaughter of
hundreds and thousands of precious
human lives. We hear that there will be
no "pause for peace" to let diplomacy
catch up with the pace of the war, but we
have not heard any reasoned argument
in support of such a stand.
Think about the effect that the way
we conduct the war will have on lasting
peace in the region. Does fear of our
unrestrained military power affect the
struggle between Soviet reformers who
have given us great hope and conserva
tives who would send us back to the Cold
War? Does such fear mean that world
grievances will be carried out through
terrorism rather than conventional war
fare?
It is clear that long-term thinking is
not restricted to the principle that
aggression must never be rewarded. I
don't have definitive answers to all these
questions, and no one does. But their
gravity makes the free and open
exchange of ideas more important than it
is at any other time.

There are those who argue that we
can't afford to fight with one hand tied
behind our back. But we do tie one hand
and we can't afford not to. We don't beat
prisoners of war and force them into
humiliating confessions. We don't inten
tionally hurl rockets into civilian centers,
regardless of military objectives which
might be supported.
To untie our hand would make a
mockery of the very ideals we are pre
sumably fighting for. We tie one hand
behind our back not only for moral rea
sons but also to gain the respect of the
world.
Real support of our troops, our
nation, democracy, and humanity
requires the questioning of those leaders
we have empowered to execute our val
ues.
Our view of politicians in peacetime is
that they are a self-serving lot who are
obsessed with entrenching themselves,
and in wartime they are impeccable
characters who can be blindly trusted to
carry out our most precious principles.
Both views can't be true, and neither is.
Democracy is not something to talk
about and then put on a shelf. Democ
racy is something to do. We must use it
or lose it.
