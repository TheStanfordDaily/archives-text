# Allison critics are too self-righteous and inconsiderate
## 
### 
I have been appalled by the reaction
on campus to Aim6e Allison's decision to
apply for the status of conscientious
objector. This reaction has surfaced not
only in The Daily (Jan. 18) but also in
chants at a number of rallies in support

of the war.
I have no doubt that some students
are disturbed by her actions, and I can
vouch for the strength and reality of
their feelings. What I do object to is the
ease with which they claim the moral
high ground to judge, condemn and
scapegoat a fellow student and menace
anyone who questions them. I felt physi
cally threatened by one of them.
While a number of them claim to be
Christians, they seem not to have
learned one of the most vital of all Chris
tian teachings: "He who is without sin,

let him cast the first stone at her" (John
8:7).
How many of them ever confronted
the situations that influenced her deci
sion to join as well as to leave the mili
tary? How much do they understand the
socio-political context in which such
choices are made? How much do they
understand the personal anguish that
such a stance involves?
Clearly, it is easier to dump their fears
and frustrations on another student
than it is to analyze the sources of them.
One place they might begin is an article

in the Jan. 19 New York Times: "What
the Army Ads Don't Say."
The students who accused Allison
apologize that they are not politically
correct, yet the self-righteousness they
condemn in her is exactly what shines
through most clearly in their responses
Although the nature of the alleged
'sin' is different from the Biblical case,
the gender of those who have publicly
condemned her is the same. Is this
merely a coincidence?
