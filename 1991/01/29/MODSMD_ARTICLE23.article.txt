Haroun and the Sea of Stories
By Salman Rushdie
Granta Books, 210 pp.
Reviewed by Scott Saul
At a press conference in late
December, Salman Rushdie became
Solemn Rushdie. Declaring himself a
reborn follower of Allah, Rushdie dis
avowed "The Satanic Verses," the
fanciful work he had created in his
earlier guise.
No doubt the beleaguered author
hoped for a retraction of the death
sentence levied on him by the late
Ayatollah Khomeini. But sadly, his
appeal for a truce fell on deaf ears:
the Iranian mullahs refused to revise
the pronouncement of their late
leader.
"Haroun and the Sea of Stories,"
Rushdie's latest effort, may give one
reason why those mullahs smelled a
skunk in their midst. Ostensibly a
children's story, "Haroun" is a
sophisticated political allegory and
the work of an uncompromising
artist who has chosen the flexible fic
tion over the die-hard dogma.
Rushdie's inventive fable revolves,
as expected, around the point of cen
sorship. When Rashid Kalifa — a
story-teller par excellence, the Shah
of Blah — suddenly falls silent, his
son Haroun takes the law into his
own hands.
Part vigilante, part bumbler and
part wide-eyed pubescent, Haroun

journeys to the magical moon of
Kahani, a land divided between the
gabby Gups and the silent Chup
walas. Once there, he finds himself in
the thick of a war launched by the
Gups to protect the Sea of Stories
from the polluting potions of the
Chupwalas' Cultmaster.
As an author, Rushdie makes his
allegiances clear from the start. The
Gups live on the moon's sunny side,
yammer cheerfully, possess a moder
ate temperament and hold fiction in
the highest regard.
The Chups, on the other hand, live
in a zone of shadows ("Ayatollah"
means "Shadow of God") and sup
port a Union of Zipped Lips. Under
the orders of the Cultmaster, that
Union even kidnaps the Gups'
princess with the horrid intention of
sewing up her lips.
Unlike many children stories,
however, Rushdie's fable avoids facile
moralizing. On the whole, his tone is
moderate and tolerant, not grumpy
or condescending. WTien he does
occasionally step onto a soapbox,
Rushdie sounds more like a goody
goody than an apostate.
For instance, after Haroun actu
ally enters the land of the Chups, he
discovers that he has demonized the
Gups' enemy without reason. In a
somewhat stale moment of epiphany,
he realizes that "silence had its own
grace and beauty (just as speech
could be graceless and ugly); and that
Action could be as noble as Words;

and that creatures of darkness could
be as lovely as the children of the
light."
Unfortunately, despite such high
minded intentions, Rushdie cannot
sustain the plot's momentum past
the first half of the book. His story
bursts with ingenious invention—a
fat-headed Water Genie, a boisterous
bus driver, an Eggheaded
Walrus—but ultimately, he does not
tie together the loose ends of his
fancy. His juicy plot is really only
half-baked.

Rushdie's saggy plot ruins
"Haroun" as a children's story: few
kids would be satisfied by its limp
ending and stylistic excesses.
But "Haroun" does serve as a fitting
touchstone for the recent debates on
censorship, the arts, and Rushdie
himself. It finds banality in the horri
ble specters of censorship, light
humor in the heavy heart of the
artist. Appropriately, it sounds an
ambivalent note for a writer driven
underground but beginning to see
the light.
