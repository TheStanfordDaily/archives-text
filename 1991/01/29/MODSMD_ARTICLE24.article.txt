Cuba: A Journey
By Jacobo Timerman
Alfred A. Knopf, $18.95, 125 pages
Reviewed by Kecia Albright
This fourth book by renowned
Argentine journalist Jacobo Timer
man is a forceful indictment of Cuba,
three decades after the socialist revolu
tion which brought Fidel Castro to
power. Timerman attempts in this
work, based on a 1987 visit to the
island nation, to come to grips with the
reality of the revolution which has
been idealized and used as a model of
anti-imperialism and development by
Latin American leftists.
While not discounting the achieve
ments of Castro's social reforms, such
as widespread literacy campaigns, the
author describes the limitations of
such advances when accompanied by
lack of political freedoms:
"If it is true that every Cuban
knows how to read and write, it is like
wise true that every Cuban has noth
ing to read and must be very cautious
about what he writes."
The book is written in a flowing,
conversational style that moves
quickly from one topic to the next
without any apparent structure. Most
of text is a narrative of his trip,
recounting his interactions with ordi
nary Cubans and his impressions of
their lives. He discovers among the
people a sense of resignation:
"No one in the little wooden house
in Cumanyagua expressed any desires
or dreams. Is such passivity normal?
During a long encounter, won't certain
anxieties surface, the dream of attain

ing something remote, a longing to be
elsewhere? Were we not weighted
down by a tombstone, a conclusive
event, a situation in which everything
was predetermined? Cuba seems like a
consummated situation. ..."
The tightly controlled, propagandis
ts official press (all publications,
unless clandestine, are "official") is
one target of Timerman's criticism. He
condemns the lack of access to foreign
news and literature, and the curbs
placed on individuals' freedom of
expression.
He also writes of human rights
abuses and the dangers faced by those
who actively oppose government poli
cies or protest the human rights viola
tions.
Although this work, unlike many
others about post-revolutionary Cuba,
does not focus primarily on Castro,
Timerman manages to convey both "El
Comandante's" charm and megaloma
nia simultaneously.
This sad portrait of Castro's Cuba is
poignant and believable; the book
avoids the dichotomy between rabid
anti-communist denunciations of
Cuba and propagandistic portrayals of
Cuba as a model socialist society.
Timerman, who considers himself a
socialist, writes of his original reaction
to the revolution:
"What had happened in Cuba — the
eruption — meant that everything in
the struggle toward a more just society,
as [II had conceived it, was possible:
youthful idealists doing for the people
exactly what should be done, with the
unique strength that solidarity, gen
erosity, and sacrifice provide."
Nevertheless, after 30 years Timer

man finds that the Cuban revolution
has not been able to create the ideal
society it promised. Corruption is ram
pant, human rights violations are com
monplace and not even the illusion of
freedom of expression is maintained.
This book is indeed a journey, from
lofty ideals to grim reality.
A Higher Kind of Loyalty
By Liu Binyan (translated by Zhu
Hong)
Pantheon, $22.95, 283 pages
Reviewed by Michael D.C. Drout
Liu Binyan is China's most famous
and respected journalist. Currently liv
ing in exile after the Tiananmen
Square massacre (he was in the United
States at the time), Liu was a promi
nent investigative reporter with
China's People's Daily. "A Higher Kind
of Loyalty" is a memoir detailing the
fate of a dedicated reformer in
viciously political communist China.
After exposing political corruption,
waste and nepotism, Liu was branded
a "rightist" in 1957 and spent 21 years
performing manual labor in the coun
tryside. He was finally "rehabilitated"
and regained his place as the dean of
Chinese journalists, only to be again
disgraced and expelled from the Com
munist Party after a political shake-up
in 1987.
In his periods of freedom, Liu inves
tigated injustice and waste at all levels
of government, exposing them in the
pages of the People's Daily and forcing

the Party to take notice.
"A Higher Kind of Loyalty" is a dif
ficult book. Liu is obviously a meticu
lous and hard-digging journalist, and
the pages of the book are crammed
with names, dates, and paragraph
after paragraph of exact summaries of
events. It can become oppressive, espe
cially since Liu writes each chapter as
a separate chronology. This becomes
very confusing as we are told about
events ranging from the '50s to the
present day again and again with little
attempt to tie the chapters together.
The language is also rather stilted,
and Liu assumes a more thorough
grasp of Chinese politics than the lay
person reader would possess. Names of
leaders of all levels of the Party hierar
chy are rushed past the reader with lit
tle attempt to explain who these people
are and what exactly their titles mean.
But this all serves to bring a high level
of verisimilitude to the book. And Liu
is pleasantly modest about his accom
plishments, focusing on the people he
helped rather than his role in helping
them.
This said, "A Higher Kind of Loy
alty" is still an essential book for
today's college students, especially at
Stanford. The documented abuses of
"political correctness," a phrase Liu
presciently uses, are many and dread
ful. "Thought reform," re-education
and the labeling of Liu and others as
"rightists" all have their parallels in
American universities today. The great
contribution of Liu's work is to
show the awful extremes that
intolerant (even if genuinely
heartfelt) thinking can lead to
and the relatively benign under
pinnings of such abuses.
Liu remains a dedicated com
munist. At times this can be frus
trating, as the reader can feel the
confusion of a man faced with
choking down the conflicts

between his ideology and reality.
But the main argument of the
book is not a denunciation of com
munism. Rather, it is an appeal to
truly put the power in the hands
of the masses rather than in a
Party-led dictatorship.
Liu's own words are more com
pelling than anything I can write:
"I gave up my youth for the
Communist Party in its struggle
to seize state power. And now a
handful of tyrants have betrayed
the Party, turning themselves into
the enemies of the people in the

real sense of the word. My gener
ation has thrown itself into the
struggle led by the Communist
Party in the hope that our chil
dren will lead a better life, and
now it is precisely the best and the
brightest of their generation who
have died at the butchers' hands,
or a fugitive fleeing from arrest."
But he ends his memoir on an
optimistic note. "At this moment,
the Chinese people are one step
closer to the freedom they have
dreamt of and fought for during
the last hundred years," he says.
