Frida Kahlo — The Bruoh of Anguish

As a young child, author Martha Zamora
glimpsed Frida Kahlo walking down a street in Mex
ico City. That encounter inspired a lifelong interest
in the enigmatic Mexican artist that is culminated
in this biography, which gives readers a similar mag
ical glimpse of Frida Kahlo.
The book is, first and foremost, visually stunning.
The self-portrait of Kahlo featured on the cover is an
appropriate introduction not only to the physical
and emotional suffering Kahlo endured throughout
her life, but also to the artist's remarkable ability to
channel her passion into her art.
Kahlo's art is indeed the most fascinating ele
ment of the book, and her numerous self-portraits
are among the most interesting of the reproduc
tions.
After sustaining extensive injuries in a bus acci
dent as a teenager, Kahlo was confined to her bed for
long periods throughout her life. Her mirror, there
fore, was often the only available source of artistic
inspiration.
The most intriguing of the portraits are those
painted as an emotional response to the pain and
turmoil she experienced. Although these works con
vey feelings of anger and resentment, they also
reveal Kahlo's defiant spirit and the proud determi
nation that carried her through so many tragedies.
Kahlo's other paintings further reveal her genius
as well as her boldness and eccentricity. While the
debate continues as to whether or not she was truly
a surrealist, the reproductions in Zamora's book
indeed present a profound and disturbing vision, be
it inspired by dream or reality.
Among the most notable of these works are "My
Birth" and "My Nurse and I," both illustrating the
strong ties Frida felt to women and to Mexico, and
"The Two Fridas" and "Self-Portrait with Cropped
Hair," which express her love for husband Diego
Rivera and her pain at losing him.
One of Kahlo's last paintings, "Viva la vida,"
(Long Live Life) is an extraordinary still life that
captures the intensity and vitality that so character
ized her life.
The book contains numerous photographs of
Frida that also exhibit this indomitable spirit.
Whether dressed up in a man's suit or in her famous
Tehuana costumes, lying in a hospital bed or carry
ing signs at protest marches, with Diego or in a
provocative, solitary pose, Kahlo is always alluring,
mysterious and triumphant.
Zamora adds to these powerful visuals narration
on a personal level — including her devastating bus
accident, her turbulent marriage to Rivera, her love
affairs with famous men and women (including Rus
sian leader Leon Trotsky), her travels to the United
States and Europe, and her multitude of profes
sional successes and personal failures.
Throughout the book the text is enhanced bv the
anecdotes and remembrances of many of Kanlo's'
friends as well as entries from Frida's diary. All of
these illustrate the more human side of what has
become a mythical figure, serving as a reminder that
even cultural heroes and heroines indulge in bad
habits and are plagued by insecurities.
While Zamora succeeds in portraying an image of
Frida Kahlo, in some respects the book remains no
more than a fleeting glimpse. For instance, Kahlo's
striking artwork is rarely accompanied by any inter
pretation or artistic criticism.
Some aspects of Frida's life are similarly
neglected, such as her political involvement. Her
convictions are trivialized and she is reduced to
merely a disinterested follower of her husband's
political beliefs.
Despite these minor shortcomings, Zamora's
biography does offer an introduction to a marvelous
woman and a gifted artist. And like the author's ini
tial glimpse of the mysterious figure in the street,
this book, too, is an enticing invitation to know more
about the phenomenon of Frida Kahlo.
