## Fencers do well on East Coast 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Going into Saturday's fenc
ing meet at Penn State, the
Cardinal team didn't seem to
have much to look forward to.
After traveling 2,500 miles
across the country, they were
facing 12 straight hours of
fencing against eight of the
best teams in the nation.
But after that long day of
fencing, without the services of
perhaps the top fencer in
school history, the Cardinal
came away having proven it
belongs among the nation's
elite.
"It was a very grueling, long
day," women's coach Sherry
Posthumus said. "We started at
eight in the morning and fin
ished at 8:30 at night. There
were no breaks for us."
In an all-day affair hosted by
the Nittany Lions, the defend
ing NCAA champs and the
favorites to win it again this
year. But despite the top-flight
competition, the Cardinal men
went 4-4 and the women went
6-2.
The Stanford men were
without Nick Bravin, and will
be throughout the season. He
won the NCAA foil title last
year but is redshirting this sea
son to train in Europe for the
1992 Olympics.
"If we had Nick I think Penn
State would have done us in
but that was it," Posthumus
said. "(But) Overall we were
pleased. They did a nice job."
On the men's side Stanford
defeated Northwestern 19-8,
Cornell 17-10, North Carolina
State 15-12 and Navy 16-11.
Led by junior Leonard

D'Amico, the Cardinal sabre
team went 9-0 in the win over
the Midshipmen.
Stanford lost to Penn State
22-5, Duke 14-13, Wisconsin
16-11 and North Carolina 18-9.
Posthumus was especially
happy with the performances
of D'Amico and Keith Early in
sabre, Stan Brobson in foil and
all three Cardinal performers
in epee.
On the women's side, Stan
ford bested Duke 12-4, North
western 13-3, Wisconsin 10-6,
Cornell 9-7, N.C. State 13-3
and Navy 11-5. The Cardinal
fell to Penn State 11-5 and
North Carolina 10-6.
All the Stanford women
fared very well according to
Posthumus, especially the
team's three stars, Grace
Chang, Olivia Judson and Lana
Kang.
"Overall 1 thought the team
did very well," the coach said.
"It's the way we find out how
we're going to do at NCAAs. We
should definitely be in the top
10. We were seventh last year
and I think we can do that well
again."
Stanford returns to action
Saturday morning in Roble
Gym. The Cardinal will host
West Coast rivals UC-Santa
Cruz, Long Beach State, UC-
San Diego and California. Both
Stanford's men's and women's
teams have dominated those
teamsiivn v winning the Western
Regional Championships over
the past several years.
This year's Western
Regional Championships will
be held March 2-3 at Long
Beach State. The NCAA Cham
pionships will be March 21-25
at Penn State.
