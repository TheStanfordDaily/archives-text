# Golfers in fourth after one round
## Cold weather delays start at tournament in Tucson 
### George Malone Staff writer 
Winter quarter hit the men's golf team yesterday
in Tucson, Ariz.
Everybody knows that winter quarter at Stanford
is the time that students take tougher course loads
and the weather turns bad, but who would have
expected it to be too cold to play golf in Tucson? Yet
that is exactly what happened to the Stanford men's
golf team yesterday as they tried to play the first
round of the Arizona/PING Intercollegiate Tourna
ment.
After a frost delay of one hour and 40 minutes
while the greens thawed, the golfers went on to
shake those winter quarter blues and complete their
first 18 holes with a score of 287, just four shots
behind leaders Oklahoma State, USC and UCLA.
The team shot one under par for the first round and
had completed 15 holes of the second when play was
suspended because of darkness.
Notah Begay, a freshman, led the Stanford squad
with a 3-under-par 69, which tied him with three
others for third place individually, just two shots
back of leader Greg Garbero of UCLA. He is followed
on the team by sophomore Mike Milliken's 1-under
par 71, freshman Casey Martin's 1-over-par 73 and
sophomore Dave Rutkowski's 2-over-par 74. Team
captain Christian Cevaer, a junior, finished with a
disappointing 86, but coach Wally Goodwin was
upbeat.
"I am very pleased with our team's performance,"
Goodwin said. "To come into this tournament and
play against top-ranked opponents and be four shots
back after the first round is great."
Goodwin was especially pleased with the play of
his two freshman, Begay and Martin.
"Notah's 69 is a great round as a freshman," he
said. "It comes from his constant work on the funda
mentals of golf. He is always hitting the driver, the
wedge, and the putter, and that's what wins in golf.
"Martin's 2-over-par is great for a first tourna
ment too."
The team will finish its second round this morn
ing (assuming Old Man Winter complies), take a
break while the pins are re-set on the course, and
play the third and final round today before coming
home tonight.

Sophomore Mike Milliken and his Cardinal teammates had to brave unusually cold
weather yesterday in Tucson, Ariz. Milliken made the best of it, however, firing a round
of 71 to help the Cardinal grab fourth place after one day.
