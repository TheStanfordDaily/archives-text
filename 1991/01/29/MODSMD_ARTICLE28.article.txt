# Why should it take a war to prove sports isn't everything
## 
### 
The news came just before we hit the
Grapevine, 13 very long days ago,
near the end of yet another drive
down Interstate 5. The UCLA-Stanford
basketball game was only five hours away,
but it would soon seem like forever.
And, of course, that game would soon
seem insignificant — as if a basketball
game is ever incredibly important.
One of my first reactions was that I
was always hundreds of miles away from
school anytime something major hap
pened. The Gorbachev visit? Had to go
watch the College World Series. The
Quake? Didn't feel like coming to school
that quarter. The War? Had to go see a
couple games in L.A.
Besides a random thought that maybe
I should stick around school a little more,
I reacted to the broadcast pretty much
the way I had expected: I listened quietly;
I thought about the people I knew in the
Gulf, and hoped they would come home
soon; 1 prayed it would all be over quickly.
And then I went to the basketball
game, just like I would have any other
day. I knew I wasn't doing anything vital
or important, but it was what I had come
to do.
I went, I watched, I cheered (which I
probably shouldn't have done, consider
ing I was doing a radio broadcast, but hey.
. ..), and then I went to a friend's house

and watched the news for a few hours.
A lot of people, obviously, chose to
watch the news instead of coming to
Pauley Pavilion that night — over 5,000
seats were empty during the game. It was,
after all, a game, and war is war. Every
now and then, it seems, a few people give
their priorities a nice long look and decide
something has to be changed.
During the next few days, there were
several columns from L.A. sportswriters
about how the war put sports in perspec
tive, how everything that pertains to
games was completely overshadowed by
events in the Gulf. There was a sense of
humility, and maybe a realization that
maybe sports aren't that important —
when compared to war, that is.
That was all fine with me, but I
couldn't help wondering one thing: Why
does it take a war to make some people
realize that, in the grand scheme of

,things, sports really don't count for a
whole hell of a lot?
I'm not saying sports aren't important.
They absolutely, positively have their
place, and they're extremely impor
tant to the people — athletes, coaches,
trainers — who are involved in games.
The thing that bothers me is how
important sports have become to the peo
ple who are watching, not playing. Every
sports story I read about war and perspec
tive made it sound like the authors were
making a sacrifice: Oh, there's a war.
Look how worldly-minded I am by
putting sports (and, by definition, my life)
on hold a little while to watch the news.
Wonderful. You could take two
thoughts away from each of these "Sports
no longer seem important" stories: (1)
It's good to see sportwriters admit there's
something just a little more significant
than what they do; and (2) What the f—
took them so long?
War is bigger than sports, and every
one knows it. Now, since no one seemed to
harp on this subject before the war
started, are we to assume that other prob
lems in the world are not more important
than a bunch of games? Come on.
Lemme think . .. thousands of chil
dren dying every day all over the world,
people starving to death everywhere,

homeless problems in our own country,
AIDS, crack, high school graduates who
can't read, an environment going to s— .
. . actually, I can't think of anything at all
on the planet that could possibly be more
important than sports, can you?

Why does it take a war to
make some people realize
that, in the grand scheme
of things, sports really
don't count for a whole
hell of a lot?

Welcome to reality, guys. Sports are
never more important than the world's
problems. Sports should always be
dwarfed by more serious events. That's
exactly why there's no reason to interrupt
games because of something "more seri
ous" — if we did that, no games would
ever be played.
There's always something more seri
ous; some people just don't want to admit
it.
Six months ago, not a single member
of the sports media would have
dreamed of writing that sports

really weren't that big a deal. Today it's
the thing to do — look what I'm writing
about — but only because it took several
thousand tons of explosives and lot of
dead people to wake the dummies up.
Sports Illustrated's Leigh Montville
wrote an essay last week on how his world
had been changed by the Gulf War, and he
captures the problem quite succinctly:
"I am a middle-aged man who has
spent most of his life pulling the newspa
per apart as soon as it landed on the
doorstep in the morning," Montville
writes. "I have called the front page a fine
and thoughtful wrapper to keep the
sports section dry. I have said, many
times, 'I check the front page headline,
just to see if we're at war, then go to the
only news that really counts.' "
This man is allowed to vote?
I wonder, in a few weeks, when the war
isn't really anything new, if nothing much
seems to be happening besides several
thousand bombs per day greeting Iraq, as
soon as the conflict becomes just another
one of the many problems facing all of us
. . . if Montville won't go back to reading
the only news that really counts.
