# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
We at the Athletes of the Week are often
times a sentimental bunch. We admit it. This
week is an especially emotional time for us as
we recognize the efforts of two unsung
heroes in Stanford Athletics.
While swimming with better-known
teammates like Janet Evans and Summer
Sanders, Janel Jorgensen sometimes
doesn't get the credit she deserves. But tal
ents like Jorgensen can't easily escape our

notice.
For four years, Andrew Vlahov has
given 110 percent on the court for men's bas
ketball. Last Thursday, he almost keyed
another upset of Arizona on the Maples
hardwood. SaHly, that defeat marked the end
of Vlahov's collegiate career. Surgery will
sideline him for the rest of the season.
Jorgensen, a 5-foot-9 sophomore from
Ridgefield, Conn., won five events over the
weekend as the Cardinal romped past Ari
zona State on Friday and Arizona on Satur
day.
Competing against the Sun Devils, Jor
gensen won the 200-yard freestyle in
1:48.47, breaking a pool record set by the
great Mary T. Meagher in 1985. Jorgensen
also took first in the 100 butterfly and the
100 freestyle.
A day later, she demonstrated her versa
tility by winning both the 200 butterfly and
the 200 individual medley.

Vlahov, a 6-7 senior from Perth, Aus
tralia, was a key reserve his freshman year
when Stanford defeated then-No. 1 Arizona
in the Mircale of Maples I. The next season,
he helped Stanford take down the Wildcats
again, coming back from a 21-4 deficit — the
Miracle of Maples 11.
This year has been a tough one for Vlahov
as he has battled the pain from a bone spur
in his right ankle. Still, the team's captain
excelled on the court averaging 11.3 points
and 6.2 rebounds. He dished out 63 assists,
good for second on the team, and led the

squad in steals with 27.
In what would turn out to be the final
game of his illustrious Cardinal career, Vla
hov chipped in 15 points, 10 boards and nine
assists as Stanford fell just short of victory,
78-76. If the guys at the stats table had
found the Aussie one more assist he would
have recorded the first triple-double in Stan
ford men's basketball history.
