# Elite image a liability in controversy
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
With its on-campus Saks Fifth Avenue, golf
course and Rodin sculpture garden, Stanford has
long been vulnerable to charges of elitism and privi
lege.
Students, who pay more than $20,000 a year to

attend, jokingly refer to the Univer
sity as a "country club." During
droughts, the University has opted to
pay thousands of dollars in fines for
excessive water use rather than risk

damage to its lawns.
As the fight intensifies over Stanford's indirect
cost practices, University administrators are finding
this elitist image especially difficult to combat.
Stanford's research practices are the subject of
three ongoing federal investigations. The most pun
ishing of the probes thus far has been that of the
House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investiga
tions, chaired by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich.
At a time when cutting costs is politically correct
in Washington, congressional investigators have
skillfully manipulated Stanford's elitist image to
gain the upper hand in this controversy. Through
selective leaks to the press, they have put Stanford
on the defensive, portraying the school and its presi
dent as unforgivably privileged.
During the past several weeks, staff members of
the Dingell subcommittee have disclosed to the press
that the University included thousands of dollars of
flower arrangements, antiques, linens and catering
bills from Hoover House — the residence of Univer-
sity President Donald Kennedy
and his family — in Stanford's
indirect-cost recovery claims.
The subcommitte's jabs have
inflicted severe public-relations
wounds, but more importantly,
they have softened the Univer
sity's posture as it grapples with
the government over policy issues
that have a monumental impact
on the University's long-term
financial health.
"The subcommittee has a
deserved reputation for being
tough," Kennedy says,"and
they've certainly been tough in
this instance."
When deciding if such items as
flowers at Hoover House should
be part of a university's indirect
costs of doing research, congres
sional investigators say they apply
two tests. The first has to do with
whether or not particular charges
are legal under federal rules.
Charging the government for
depreciation on a 72-foot yacht, all
parties agree, is not allowed. Early
last month, the University con
ceded it had done just that, inad
vertently including depreciation
of a University-owned "sailing
vessel" in its cost claims.
The second test, dubbed the
"Aunt-Emma-in-Iowa" standard
by one subcommittee staffer, is
not as cut and dried. Investigators
are questioning whether charging
a fraction of items such as flowers
to the government seems reason
able to the average taxpayer —
regardless of whether or not doing
so violates government rules.
With the exception of the
yacht, all the items that have sur
faced in the press thus far have
passed the first test, but failed the
second in the eyes of the subcom
mittee staff. Charging the govern
ment for a fraction of flower
arrangements at Hoover House is
not "specifically unallowable,"
one subcommittee staffer said,
but it does raise serious questions
about what taxpayers are getting
for their money.
With congressional hearings
looming on the horizon, Stan
ford's announcement last week to
voluntarily forgo the indirect-cost
recovery from Hoover House and
two other University-owned resi
dences appears to be a calculated
move to take the sting out of
future punches thrown by the
subcommittee.
Congressional and Defense
Department auditors have spent
the past several weeks combing
every corner of Hoover House,
including the bedroom and per
sonal bathroom of Kennedy and

his wife, Robin. The laundry list
of questionable charges is certain
to grow as the audits continue.
Stanford public affairs officials,
however, now have a ready-made
response to any new revelations:
"Those items have already been
taken off the table." University
administrators have decided it
isn't worth the public confusion
that has resulted to include items
that "smack of entertainment" in
Stanford's calculation of indirect
cost recovery, Kennedy says.
University officials also hope
last week's move will help restore
public trust in Stanford's stew
ardship of federal funds.
That task won't be easy. An edi
torial last month in The Arizona
Republic asserted that "taxpayers
are being hornswoggled, swindled
and defrauded" by Stanford's
indirect-cost recovery practices.
A recent Portland Oregonian
editorial struck a similar chord:
"As taxpayers endure this
year's new tax increases and new
deficit woes . . . they can take
comfort. They've been helping
keep Stanford University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's home in
fresh flowers and maintain his
university's 72-foot yacht and a
tiny armada of smaller sailboats
and racing skulls. Your tax dollars
at work."
The controversy generated by
the federal investigations here has
attracted a great deal of media
coverage, with stories routinely
appearing in Bay Area papers and,
to a lesser degree, in newspapers
in other parts of the country. The
New York Times, Boston Globe
and Washington Post have all
picked up the story. So have the
major wire services and trade pub
lications like Science magazine
and the Chronicle of Higher Edu
cation.
A production team from
"20/20," the ABC News weekly
television magazine, is on campus
this' week filming for a segment
that is likely to air late next
month.
Stanford's attempt to restore
public trust also doesn't come
cheap. The decision to withdraw
the hard-to-explain charges for
Hoover House and other Univer
sity-owned residences cost
$500,000.
A half-million dollars is a lot of
money, but if the University
escapes the whole controversy
with no additional financial
bruises, it will be considered a
major victory by administrators.
Over the past decade, the gov
ernment has reimbursed Stanford
$554 million for the indirect costs
of doing research here. Paul Bid
die, the federal regulator who
sparked the controversy, has said
Stanford may be forced to return

up to $175 million of that amount.
If that happens, $500,000 will
seem like spare change.
Biddle's claim rests largely on
his interpretations of accounting
practices and federal acquisition
rules. The potential dollar-impact
on the University is substantial,
but the substance of the dispute is
"stuff for lawyers and accoun
tants to hash out," as one Stan
ford researcher put it.
While not as widely publicized
as last week's half-million-dollar
concession, the most severe havoc
being wreaked on Stanford's oper
ating budget this year has little to
do with whether or not flowers
and refurbished pianos should be
included in the indirect cost rate.
When the investigations began
this fall, a provisional indirect cost
rate of 74 percent was imposed on
the University.
That means that for every dol
lar researchers here receive in fed
eral grants, the government reim
burses Stanford 74 cents to cover
the indirect costs of doing the
research. Indirect costs are those
expenses, such as electricity,
building depreciation and admin
istrative overhead, that are not
easily attributable to a single pro
ject.
Stanford administrators had
budgeted for an indirect cost rate
of 78 percent this year. Last
month, a negotiating team from
the Navy knocked the rate down
another two points, to 72 percent.
The six-point drop will likely

cost the University about $7.5
million in lost revenue this year,
administrators say. Depending on
the outcome of the investigations,
some of that money may be
reclaimed a few years from now,
but there are too many variables
involved to accurately assess the
likelihood of such an occurrence.
In any event, Dingell's subcom
mittee staff has added "a little
sex" to the controversy, says one
source close to the investigations.
The public is more easily aroused
by tales of yachts, flowers and
other signs of privilege than by
details of arcane accounting pro
cedures.
Dingell and his subcommittee
staff have a history of making
their points through graphic
examples.
It was Dingell's subcommittee
that in 1985 discovered the Pen
tagon had paid $640 for a toilet
seat and that General Dynamics
had billed the Pentagon for coun
try club dues and dog kennel
boarding. Dingell has likened the
controversy at Stanford to the
defense procurement scandal, but
Stanford administrators call such
a comparison unfair.
For the most part, however,
Kennedy and other administra
tors have adopted a more concilia
tory tone in recent weeks when
publicly discussrng-Dmgell and his
subcommittee — perhaps with
good reason.
First elected in 1955, Dingell is
one of the most feared, respected

and powerful members of the
House. Fred Barnes of The New
Republic calls him the "meanest
man in Congress."
U.S. News & World Report
dubbed him "the baddest overseer
on the Hill" a couple years ago,
reporting that his colleagues
"regard him as an arrogant
power-grabber who thinks noth- *
ing of treading on their turf." The
Wall Street Journal's Paul Gigot
tabbed Dingell as "Congress's
grand inquisitor."
In addition to their reputation
for playing tough, Dingell's sub
committee staffers also have a
reputation for leaking informa
tion to the press. The practice
infuriates Kennedy.
"I'm critical of leaks," Kennedy
says."I certainly won't back off
that. Any fair-minded person
ought to be disturbed about the
practice of selective leakage."
The subcommittee's disclo
sures have all but paralyzed the
University's public affairs office,

which has spent an inordinate
amount of time trying to control
damage on this issue.
"It's very, very hard," Kennedy
says. "We've had no opportunity
to tell our story first. It's always a
disadvantage to be following up
instead of leading. In that sense, I
don't think it's been possible for
us to do a very good job."
Not all observers of the contro
versy have been so gentle in their
assessments. Some researchers,
including Engineering Prof.
William Spicer, suggest that
Kennedy and other administra
tors adopted an "arrogant pos
ture" which has played right into
the hands of the subcommittee.
By adamantly claiming the Uni
versity had done nothing wrong,
the potential for embarrassment
has been much higher, he says. .
Kennedy disagrees. "If we just
try to say this is an illegitimate
inquiry, all we sound like is elitists
defending a privileged position,"
he says.

Students, who pay more than $20,000 a year to

analysis

attend, jokingly refer to the Univer
sity as a "country club." During
droughts, the University has opted to
pay thousands of dollars in fines for
excessive water use rather than risk

damage to its lawns.
As the fight intensifies over Stanford's indirect
cost practices, University administrators are finding
this elitist image especially difficult to combat.
Stanford's research practices are the subject of
three ongoing federal investigations. The most pun
ishing of the probes thus far has been that of the
House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investiga
tions, chaired by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich.
At a time when cutting costs is politically correct
in Washington, congressional investigators have
skillfully manipulated Stanford's elitist image to
gain the upper hand in this controversy. Through
selective leaks to the press, they have put Stanford
on the defensive, portraying the school and its presi
dent as unforgivably privileged.
During the past several weeks, staff members of
the Dingell subcommittee have disclosed to the press
that the University included thousands of dollars of
flower arrangements, antiques, linens and catering
bills from Hoover House — the residence of Univer-
sity President Donald Kennedy
and his family — in Stanford's
indirect-cost recovery claims.
The subcommitte's jabs have
inflicted severe public-relations
wounds, but more importantly,
they have softened the Univer
sity's posture as it grapples with
the government over policy issues
that have a monumental impact
on the University's long-term
financial health.
"The subcommittee has a
deserved reputation for being
tough," Kennedy says,"and
they've certainly been tough in
this instance."
When deciding if such items as
flowers at Hoover House should
be part of a university's indirect
costs of doing research, congres
sional investigators say they apply
two tests. The first has to do with
whether or not particular charges
are legal under federal rules.
Charging the government for
depreciation on a 72-foot yacht, all
parties agree, is not allowed. Early
last month, the University con
ceded it had done just that, inad
vertently including depreciation
of a University-owned "sailing
vessel" in its cost claims.
The second test, dubbed the
"Aunt-Emma-in-Iowa" standard
by one subcommittee staffer, is
not as cut and dried. Investigators
are questioning whether charging
a fraction of items such as flowers
to the government seems reason
able to the average taxpayer —
regardless of whether or not doing
so violates government rules.
With the exception of the
yacht, all the items that have sur
faced in the press thus far have
passed the first test, but failed the
second in the eyes of the subcom
mittee staff. Charging the govern
ment for a fraction of flower
arrangements at Hoover House is
not "specifically unallowable,"
one subcommittee staffer said,
but it does raise serious questions
about what taxpayers are getting
for their money.
With congressional hearings
looming on the horizon, Stan
ford's announcement last week to
voluntarily forgo the indirect-cost
recovery from Hoover House and
two other University-owned resi
dences appears to be a calculated
move to take the sting out of
future punches thrown by the
subcommittee.
Congressional and Defense
Department auditors have spent
the past several weeks combing
every corner of Hoover House,
including the bedroom and per
sonal bathroom of Kennedy and

his wife, Robin. The laundry list
of questionable charges is certain
to grow as the audits continue.
Stanford public affairs officials,
however, now have a ready-made
response to any new revelations:
"Those items have already been
taken off the table." University
administrators have decided it
isn't worth the public confusion
that has resulted to include items
that "smack of entertainment" in
Stanford's calculation of indirect
cost recovery, Kennedy says.
University officials also hope
last week's move will help restore
public trust in Stanford's stew
ardship of federal funds.
That task won't be easy. An edi
torial last month in The Arizona
Republic asserted that "taxpayers
are being hornswoggled, swindled
and defrauded" by Stanford's
indirect-cost recovery practices.
A recent Portland Oregonian
editorial struck a similar chord:
"As taxpayers endure this
year's new tax increases and new
deficit woes . . . they can take
comfort. They've been helping
keep Stanford University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's home in
fresh flowers and maintain his
university's 72-foot yacht and a
tiny armada of smaller sailboats
and racing skulls. Your tax dollars
at work."
The controversy generated by
the federal investigations here has
attracted a great deal of media
coverage, with stories routinely
appearing in Bay Area papers and,
to a lesser degree, in newspapers
in other parts of the country. The
New York Times, Boston Globe
and Washington Post have all
picked up the story. So have the
major wire services and trade pub
lications like Science magazine
and the Chronicle of Higher Edu
cation.
A production team from
"20/20," the ABC News weekly
television magazine, is on campus
this' week filming for a segment
that is likely to air late next
month.
Stanford's attempt to restore
public trust also doesn't come
cheap. The decision to withdraw
the hard-to-explain charges for
Hoover House and other Univer
sity-owned residences cost
$500,000.
A half-million dollars is a lot of
money, but if the University
escapes the whole controversy
with no additional financial
bruises, it will be considered a
major victory by administrators.
Over the past decade, the gov
ernment has reimbursed Stanford
$554 million for the indirect costs
of doing research here. Paul Bid
die, the federal regulator who
sparked the controversy, has said
Stanford may be forced to return

up to $175 million of that amount.
If that happens, $500,000 will
seem like spare change.
Biddle's claim rests largely on
his interpretations of accounting
practices and federal acquisition
rules. The potential dollar-impact
on the University is substantial,
but the substance of the dispute is
"stuff for lawyers and accoun
tants to hash out," as one Stan
ford researcher put it.
While not as widely publicized
as last week's half-million-dollar
concession, the most severe havoc
being wreaked on Stanford's oper
ating budget this year has little to
do with whether or not flowers
and refurbished pianos should be
included in the indirect cost rate.
When the investigations began
this fall, a provisional indirect cost
rate of 74 percent was imposed on
the University.
That means that for every dol
lar researchers here receive in fed
eral grants, the government reim
burses Stanford 74 cents to cover
the indirect costs of doing the
research. Indirect costs are those
expenses, such as electricity,
building depreciation and admin
istrative overhead, that are not
easily attributable to a single pro
ject.
Stanford administrators had
budgeted for an indirect cost rate
of 78 percent this year. Last
month, a negotiating team from
the Navy knocked the rate down
another two points, to 72 percent.
The six-point drop will likely

cost the University about $7.5
million in lost revenue this year,
administrators say. Depending on
the outcome of the investigations,
some of that money may be
reclaimed a few years from now,
but there are too many variables
involved to accurately assess the
likelihood of such an occurrence.
In any event, Dingell's subcom
mittee staff has added "a little
sex" to the controversy, says one
source close to the investigations.
The public is more easily aroused
by tales of yachts, flowers and
other signs of privilege than by
details of arcane accounting pro
cedures.
Dingell and his subcommittee
staff have a history of making
their points through graphic
examples.
It was Dingell's subcommittee
that in 1985 discovered the Pen
tagon had paid $640 for a toilet
seat and that General Dynamics
had billed the Pentagon for coun
try club dues and dog kennel
boarding. Dingell has likened the
controversy at Stanford to the
defense procurement scandal, but
Stanford administrators call such
a comparison unfair.
For the most part, however,
Kennedy and other administra
tors have adopted a more concilia
tory tone in recent weeks when
publicly discussrng-Dmgell and his
subcommittee — perhaps with
good reason.
First elected in 1955, Dingell is
one of the most feared, respected

and powerful members of the
House. Fred Barnes of The New
Republic calls him the "meanest
man in Congress."
U.S. News & World Report
dubbed him "the baddest overseer
on the Hill" a couple years ago,
reporting that his colleagues
"regard him as an arrogant
power-grabber who thinks noth- *
ing of treading on their turf." The
Wall Street Journal's Paul Gigot
tabbed Dingell as "Congress's
grand inquisitor."
In addition to their reputation
for playing tough, Dingell's sub
committee staffers also have a
reputation for leaking informa
tion to the press. The practice
infuriates Kennedy.
"I'm critical of leaks," Kennedy
says."I certainly won't back off
that. Any fair-minded person
ought to be disturbed about the
practice of selective leakage."
The subcommittee's disclo
sures have all but paralyzed the
University's public affairs office,

which has spent an inordinate
amount of time trying to control
damage on this issue.
"It's very, very hard," Kennedy
says. "We've had no opportunity
to tell our story first. It's always a
disadvantage to be following up
instead of leading. In that sense, I
don't think it's been possible for
us to do a very good job."
Not all observers of the contro
versy have been so gentle in their
assessments. Some researchers,
including Engineering Prof.
William Spicer, suggest that
Kennedy and other administra
tors adopted an "arrogant pos
ture" which has played right into
the hands of the subcommittee.

instead of leading. In that sense, I
don't think it's been possible for
us to do a very good job."
Not all observers of the contro
versy have been so gentle in their
assessments. Some researchers,
including Engineering Prof.
William Spicer, suggest that
Kennedy and other administra
tors adopted an "arrogant pos
ture" which has played right into
the hands of the subcommittee.
By adamantly claiming the Uni
versity had done nothing wrong,
the potential for embarrassment
has been much higher, he says. .
Kennedy disagrees. "If we just
try to say this is an illegitimate
inquiry, all we sound like is elitists
defending a privileged position,"
he says.
With its on-campus Saks Fifth Avenue, golf
course and Rodin sculpture garden, Stanford has
long been vulnerable to charges of elitism and privi
lege.
Students, who pay more than $20,000 a year to

News
analysis

attend, jokingly refer to the Univer
sity as a "country club." During
droughts, the University has opted to
pay thousands of dollars in fines for
excessive water use rather than risk

damage to its lawns.
As the fight intensifies over Stanford's indirect
cost practices, University administrators are finding
this elitist image especially difficult to combat.
Stanford's research practices are the subject of
three ongoing federal investigations. The most pun
ishing of the probes thus far has been that of the
House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investiga
tions, chaired by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich.
At a time when cutting costs is politically correct
in Washington, congressional investigators have
skillfully manipulated Stanford's elitist image to
gain the upper hand in this controversy. Through
selective leaks to the press, they have put Stanford
on the defensive, portraying the school and its presi
dent as unforgivably privileged.
During the past several weeks, staff members of
the Dingell subcommittee have disclosed to the press
that the University included thousands of dollars of
flower arrangements, antiques, linens and catering
bills from Hoover House — the residence of Univer-
sity President Donald Kennedy
and his family — in Stanford's
indirect-cost recovery claims.
The subcommitte's jabs have
inflicted severe public-relations
wounds, but more importantly,
they have softened the Univer
sity's posture as it grapples with
the government over policy issues
that have a monumental impact
on the University's long-term
financial health.
"The subcommittee has a
deserved reputation for being
tough," Kennedy says,"and
they've certainly been tough in
this instance."
When deciding if such items as
flowers at Hoover House should
be part of a university's indirect
costs of doing research, congres
sional investigators say they apply
two tests. The first has to do with
whether or not particular charges
are legal under federal rules.
Charging the government for
depreciation on a 72-foot yacht, all
parties agree, is not allowed. Early
last month, the University con
ceded it had done just that, inad
vertently including depreciation
of a University-owned "sailing
vessel" in its cost claims.
The second test, dubbed the
"Aunt-Emma-in-Iowa" standard
by one subcommittee staffer, is
not as cut and dried. Investigators
are questioning whether charging
a fraction of items such as flowers
to the government seems reason
able to the average taxpayer —
regardless of whether or not doing
so violates government rules.
With the exception of the
yacht, all the items that have sur
faced in the press thus far have
passed the first test, but failed the
second in the eyes of the subcom
mittee staff. Charging the govern
ment for a fraction of flower
arrangements at Hoover House is
not "specifically unallowable,"
one subcommittee staffer said,
but it does raise serious questions
about what taxpayers are getting
for their money.
With congressional hearings
looming on the horizon, Stan
ford's announcement last week to
voluntarily forgo the indirect-cost
recovery from Hoover House and
two other University-owned resi
dences appears to be a calculated
move to take the sting out of
future punches thrown by the
subcommittee.
Congressional and Defense
Department auditors have spent
the past several weeks combing
every corner of Hoover House,
including the bedroom and per
sonal bathroom of Kennedy and

his wife, Robin. The laundry list
of questionable charges is certain
to grow as the audits continue.
Stanford public affairs officials,
however, now have a ready-made
response to any new revelations:
"Those items have already been
taken off the table." University
administrators have decided it
isn't worth the public confusion
that has resulted to include items
that "smack of entertainment" in
Stanford's calculation of indirect
cost recovery, Kennedy says.
University officials also hope
last week's move will help restore
public trust in Stanford's stew
ardship of federal funds.
That task won't be easy. An edi
torial last month in The Arizona
Republic asserted that "taxpayers
are being hornswoggled, swindled
and defrauded" by Stanford's
indirect-cost recovery practices.
A recent Portland Oregonian
editorial struck a similar chord:
"As taxpayers endure this
year's new tax increases and new
deficit woes . . . they can take
comfort. They've been helping
keep Stanford University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's home in
fresh flowers and maintain his
university's 72-foot yacht and a
tiny armada of smaller sailboats
and racing skulls. Your tax dollars
at work."
The controversy generated by
the federal investigations here has
attracted a great deal of media
coverage, with stories routinely
appearing in Bay Area papers and,
to a lesser degree, in newspapers
in other parts of the country. The
New York Times, Boston Globe
and Washington Post have all
picked up the story. So have the
major wire services and trade pub
lications like Science magazine
and the Chronicle of Higher Edu
cation.
A production team from
"20/20," the ABC News weekly
television magazine, is on campus
this' week filming for a segment
that is likely to air late next
month.
Stanford's attempt to restore
public trust also doesn't come
cheap. The decision to withdraw
the hard-to-explain charges for
Hoover House and other Univer
sity-owned residences cost
$500,000.
A half-million dollars is a lot of
money, but if the University
escapes the whole controversy
with no additional financial
bruises, it will be considered a
major victory by administrators.
Over the past decade, the gov
ernment has reimbursed Stanford
$554 million for the indirect costs
of doing research here. Paul Bid
die, the federal regulator who
sparked the controversy, has said
Stanford may be forced to return

up to $175 million of that amount.
If that happens, $500,000 will
seem like spare change.
Biddle's claim rests largely on
his interpretations of accounting
practices and federal acquisition
rules. The potential dollar-impact
on the University is substantial,
but the substance of the dispute is
"stuff for lawyers and accoun
tants to hash out," as one Stan
ford researcher put it.
While not as widely publicized
as last week's half-million-dollar
concession, the most severe havoc
being wreaked on Stanford's oper
ating budget this year has little to
do with whether or not flowers
and refurbished pianos should be
included in the indirect cost rate.
When the investigations began
this fall, a provisional indirect cost
rate of 74 percent was imposed on
the University.
That means that for every dol
lar researchers here receive in fed
eral grants, the government reim
burses Stanford 74 cents to cover
the indirect costs of doing the
research. Indirect costs are those
expenses, such as electricity,
building depreciation and admin
istrative overhead, that are not
easily attributable to a single pro
ject.
Stanford administrators had
budgeted for an indirect cost rate
of 78 percent this year. Last
month, a negotiating team from
the Navy knocked the rate down
another two points, to 72 percent.
The six-point drop will likely

cost the University about $7.5
million in lost revenue this year,
administrators say. Depending on
the outcome of the investigations,
some of that money may be
reclaimed a few years from now,
but there are too many variables
involved to accurately assess the
likelihood of such an occurrence.
In any event, Dingell's subcom
mittee staff has added "a little
sex" to the controversy, says one
source close to the investigations.
The public is more easily aroused
by tales of yachts, flowers and
other signs of privilege than by
details of arcane accounting pro
cedures.
Dingell and his subcommittee
staff have a history of making
their points through graphic
examples.
It was Dingell's subcommittee
that in 1985 discovered the Pen
tagon had paid $640 for a toilet
seat and that General Dynamics
had billed the Pentagon for coun
try club dues and dog kennel
boarding. Dingell has likened the
controversy at Stanford to the
defense procurement scandal, but
Stanford administrators call such
a comparison unfair.
For the most part, however,
Kennedy and other administra
tors have adopted a more concilia
tory tone in recent weeks when
publicly discussrng-Dmgell and his
subcommittee — perhaps with
good reason.
First elected in 1955, Dingell is
one of the most feared, respected

and powerful members of the
House. Fred Barnes of The New
Republic calls him the "meanest
man in Congress."
U.S. News & World Report
dubbed him "the baddest overseer
on the Hill" a couple years ago,
reporting that his colleagues
"regard him as an arrogant
power-grabber who thinks noth- *
ing of treading on their turf." The
Wall Street Journal's Paul Gigot
tabbed Dingell as "Congress's
grand inquisitor."
In addition to their reputation
for playing tough, Dingell's sub
committee staffers also have a
reputation for leaking informa
tion to the press. The practice
infuriates Kennedy.
"I'm critical of leaks," Kennedy
says."I certainly won't back off
that. Any fair-minded person
ought to be disturbed about the
practice of selective leakage."
The subcommittee's disclo
sures have all but paralyzed the
University's public affairs office,

which has spent an inordinate
amount of time trying to control
damage on this issue.
"It's very, very hard," Kennedy
says. "We've had no opportunity
to tell our story first. It's always a
disadvantage to be following up
instead of leading. In that sense, I
don't think it's been possible for
us to do a very good job."
Not all observers of the contro
versy have been so gentle in their
assessments. Some researchers,
including Engineering Prof.
William Spicer, suggest that
Kennedy and other administra
tors adopted an "arrogant pos
ture" which has played right into
the hands of the subcommittee.
By adamantly claiming the Uni
versity had done nothing wrong,
the potential for embarrassment
has been much higher, he says. .

try to say this is an illegitimate
inquiry, all we sound like is elitists
defending a privileged position,"
he says.
