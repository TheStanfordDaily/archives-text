DENVER (AP) - Denver
Nuggets guard Todd Lichti is
expected to be sidelined for at
least six weeks after undergoing
arthroscopic surgery on his left
knee on Monday. The 1989 Stan
ford graduate is the school's all
time leading scorer and was a
four-time all-conference selection
while here.
The arthroscope revealed
Lichti had articular (joint) carti
lage damage in the knee and his
surgeon, Dr. Steven Traina,
cleaned out loose pieces of carti
lage and drilled the defect on the
bone.
Nuggets general manager
Bernie BickerstafT said the team
has not set any target date for
Lichti's return, and afler the six
week rehabilitation period his sta
tus will be day-to-day
The irjury occurred in the first
half of Denver's home game
against Houston on Jan. 10.
"While not a major injury,
Lichti has had recurring problems
with the knee," Nuggets
spokesman Jay Clark said.
The surgery also gave doctors a
chance to clean out previous scar
tissue from other injuries in
Lichti's knee, BickerstafT said.
"Basically, this is a chance for

Time and again,
he has proven his
toughness, and we
are confident he
will come back in
great shape.'

Todd to get healthy," he said. "We
want him at 100 percent. While he
is recovering from the arthro
scope, he will also have the chance
to heal his right ankle which he
has been playing on with pain.
Time and again, he has proven his
toughness, and we are confident
he will come back in great shape."
The ii\jury is the latest setback
for Lichti in a year in which he has
suffered the physical trauma of a
severely broken right foot and two
severely sprained right ankles. He
also experienced the emotional
stress of having his girlfriend,
Kirstin Gravrock, killed in the
same springtime auto accident in
which his foot was broken.
Lichti missed several games in
late December and early January
after spraining his ankle.
