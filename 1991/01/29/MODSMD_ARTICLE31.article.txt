"As taxpayers endure this year's new tax
increases and new deficit woes ... they can
take comfort. They've been helping keep
Stanford University President Donald
Kennedy's home in fresh flowers and main
tain his university's 72-foot yacht and a tiny
armada of smaller sailboats and racing
sculls. Your tax dollars at work."
— The Portland Oregonian, 1/6/91 editorial
"What is clear from the cursory look at how
Stanford is using federal research money is
that taxpayers are being hornswoggled,
swindled and defrauded."
— The Arizona Republic, 12/24/90 editorial
"It is unclear where the investigations will
lead, but it's clear that university officials are
in for some uncomfortable times. The 1980s
were a decade of greed, and Stanford was
charging what the traffic would bear. If the
1990s are turning into the decade of retribu
tion, then Stanford may have to pay the
price."
— San Jose Mercury News, 12/7/90 editorial
