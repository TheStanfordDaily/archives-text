# Duh... Fao wins Daily election
## 
### 
Janine DeFao was elected editor in
chief of Volume 199 of The Daily last
night.
DeFao, a native of Freehold, N.J.,
on the chemical-waste-laced Atlantic
shore, began working at The Daily as
a reporter two years ago and has since
served as a news editor and managing
editor.
On the Daily staff, DeFao is best
known for her unusual manner of
dress, which includes a long, woolen,
shawl-like thing that she calls a serape
but the rest of us know is a dyed camel
skin.
DeFao's first action after winning
the election last night was to call her
hometown boyfriend, with whom she
racks up sizable phone bills for hours
on end each night at The Daily.
Watchers of the campus social
scene will remember DeFao from a
particularly haunting "Love Links"
episode her freshman year in which
she responded, "Tie me to the bed" to
the first question of the show.
To win the Daily election, DeFao, a
junior, overcame a series of physical
impediments, including a tendency to
trip over inanimate objects and hook
her clothing on door frames.
A perhaps more daunting task for
DeFao was recovering from a serious
nose injury sustained last quarter
when she was, according to her own
unsubstantiated account, "kicked
out" of a "friend's" loft late one night.
