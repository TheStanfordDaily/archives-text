# German Studies grad students threaten to leave

### Elizabeth Weiss Staff writer 
Nineteen graduate students in the
German Studies Department threat
ened to withdraw from the University
late last week unless the department
replaces two professors who took
leaves of absence this year.
The 19 students, nearly all the
graduate students in the department,

met with Dean of Undergraduate
Studies Thomas Wasow Friday after
noon and placed leave-of-absence peti
tions on his desk in protest.
The petitioners claim the depar
tures of two of the eight German Stud
ies faculty members, Profs. David
Wellbery and Russell Berman, to tem
porary post* at-othac univecftitiea have
left students without necessary
courses and advisers for their doctoral

dissertations,
"More than two-thirds of the gradu
ate students in the German Studies
Department came to Stanford to study
with these people or were writing dis
sertations with them," according to
Ellen Anderson, a graduate student in
German Studies.
Without sufficient faculty support
for their work, the students said addi
tional time spent at Stanford would be

wasted. They said they would prefer to
leave the campus after this year unless
the professors return or suitable
replacements are secured.
"People are very serious about
going through with this. It is not just a
symbolic protest," said Carl Hill,
another graduate student.
Wasow said he expressed sincere
sympathy during the meeting for
the "very legitimate" concerns of
the graduate students. "But sym
pathy doesn't do much good," he
added.
Despite the openness of Fri
day's discussion, the two profes
sors may not be replaced quickly.
The University cannot begin a
search until the two absent fac
ulty members decide whether to
return or to resign.
If the University does not begin
a search and the graduate stu
dents carry out their threat to
withdraw next fall, the University
could be short a number of
instructors for elementary Ger
man language classes, Wasow
said.
But Wasow said the graduate
students' departure would not, in
fact, threaten undergraduate lan
guage learning opportunities, nor
would the lack of graduate
instructors force senior faculty to
accept additional teaching respon
sibilities. Instead, he said, suit
able instructors could probably be
located in the Bay Area.
The chances of Berman leaving
his current Columbia University
post appear "very slim," Wasow
said. Wellbery, now teaching at
Johns Hopkins University, is
likely to reach his decision by late
next month, he added.
The gaps in the German Stud
ies Department caused by the
absences of Berman and Wellbery
may also affect prospective gradu

ate students. Applications for the
graduate program have fallen
from 45 at this time last year to
only nine this year.
"Berman and Wellbery were
certainly important in luring peo
ple here," according to Rob Robin
son, chair of the department.
If the professors do not return,
Wasow said an attempt to secure
new faculty would be hindered by
University budget constraints.
"In a different financial climate
I'm sure the dean's office would
be much more responsive, but we
have to monitor finances, and
especially long-term faculty com
mitments, more carefully than we
ever have before," Wasow said.
In addition, the ideal time for
faculty recruitment has passed,
Wasow said, as most universities
have already concluded their
screening for this year and are
now making job offers.
Even if Stanford began recruit
ing immediately, the University
could not make formal offers of
employment until May, he said.
By then, he said, "All the best
people on the job market could be
taken."
Further, the University is
unwilling to recruit a tenure
track professor so quickly, Wasow
said, explaining that the process
of filling such positions typically
requires more than a single year.
One proposal which attempts
to accommodate both positions
did emerge from Friday's meet
ing. Wasow said he intends to dis
cuss with other administration
officials the possibility of hiring
an instructor on a specified-term
basis of at least two years.
