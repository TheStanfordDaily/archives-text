# Imposter conducts sex poll by phone
## 
### Howard Libit Staff writer 
Two and possibly more female
students have been the targets of
obscene phone calls involving a
phony survey about their sexual
activity, according to Stanford
Police.
Police have received only two
complaints about the survey, con
ducted over the last two weeks by
a man claiming to be from the
"U.S. Department of Health," but
they suspect he has given inter
views to other unwitting victims,
according to Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer.
"The man sounds real profes
sional and appears to be legiti
mate," Niemeyer said. "But we
checked with various health orga
nizations in the area and discov
ered that this guy is phony."
The beginning questions in the
survey are of a general nature and
gradually become more specific
about issues involving sexual con
duct, Niemeyer said. Eventually,
the man asks very personal ques
tions, such as what the woman is
wearing and her perceptions of
rape, he added.
In one instance, the man called
a woman who said she was busy
and asked him to call back later.
He did contact her later to con
duct the survey.
Niemeyer said the survey was
very clever and that, based upon
the two reports, police believe the
man is using a prepared script.
"This appears to be some sort
of sexual gratification. It is an
obscene type of phone call,"
Niemeyer said.
Police have no suspects in the
case and said there is little they
can do to catch the man.
A search warrant is required to
place taps and traces on a tele
phone line. To obtain a warrant,
police said, the target of the calls

must be more specific than the
female population at Stanford.
The suspect appears to conduct
the surveys randomly, Niemeyer
said.
The situation is further compli
cated by the two separate phone
systems in the area. Police would
have to coordinate a search war
rant with both the University
phone system and Pacific Bell.
"It would take a lot of work,"
said Niemeyer. "We do not want to
spend the resources on this type of
harassment."
Obscene phone calls to women
are not a new phenomenon here.
A 10-year survey conducted
between 1979 and 1988 revealed

254 complaints to Stanford Police
about obscene phone calls, an
average of 25 per year.
Between October 1989 and
May 1990, several female varsity
athletes received phone calls
promising sexual phone fantasies.
People who suspect they have
unwittingly participated in this
specific survey or who have
received obscene phone calls
should contact the police,
Niemeyer said.
If more women do receive a
calls from a man claiming to be
conducting a Health Department
survey on sexual issues, Niemeyer
advises them to end the conversa
tion as quickly as possible.
