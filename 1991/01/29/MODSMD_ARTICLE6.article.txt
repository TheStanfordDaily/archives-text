# Activist doesn't let disability get in her way
## 
### John Louie Editorial staff 
While hundreds of Stanford students have par
ticipated in a variety of peace rallies, one student
at the helm of the Stanford anti-war movement
usually doesn't march at all.
Sherifa Edoga, a junior majoring in modern
thought and literature, has taken a prominent
role in the Stanford movement, speaking at ral
lies, organizing events and even participating in a
workshop on civil disobedience. Though a heart
condition makes her rely on an electric wheelchair
for traveling longer distances, Edoga's activism
has not been hampered by her disability.
"It's always important to articulate your posi
tion within society," Edoga said. "My activism is
very personal. It's very much a reflection of my
interests. Part of activism, fighting for disability
rights or fighting for minority rights, is a way in
which I look out for myself."
The anti-war movement is just one outlet for
Edoga's energies. In addition to her involvement
in Stanford Students for Peace events and the
organization of last week's teach-in on the war in
the Persian Gulf, Edoga also acts in Stanford
plays, writes for Aurora magazine and is involved
in the Pro-Choice Alliance.
Although the campus anti-war movement has
not formally elected student leaders, Edoga's
involvement has placed her at the forefront of the
group. "[The anti-war movement] isn't a group
that has chosen to have leadership," she said. "We
try very hard to work on a consensus level." How
ever, her personal efforts have helped create
numerous campus rallies, marches and discus
sions involving students, faculty and community
members.
Edoga cites the large turnout at anti-war
demonstrations as evidence that the nation sup
ports the movement's beliefs. "I don't think
Americans are behind this war," she said. "I have


April Pearson - Daily
a very strong feeling that Ameri
cans are being lied to by the media
and the administration. We're
being told Saddam Hussein is a
madman — what are Americans
going to say other than, 'Go,
Bush'?"
"Rallies for peace show other
people that they are not isolated
in their feelings about this war,"
Edoga said. "It's very empower
ing to see yourself surrounded by
people who feel the same way you
do. And it gets people to do con
crete things, whether that's [writ
ing] a letter, [making] a phone call
or [receiving] draft counseling. It
gets people moving."
Edoga said her personal beliefs
about the Persian Gulf war didn't
become formulated until late fall
quarter. "I didn't get involved
until the end of November,"
Edoga said. "I was very uncertain
about the issue. Even at the first
rally, I hadn't decided how I felt."
"But I sat down with a friend
who told me a lot about the his
tory of the Middle East and

explained the United States'
involvement," Edoga said. "She
feared that her brother would be
drafted, and I started thinking
about my brother, too."
Edoga's beliefs have definitely
solidified since that first rally. "If
the kind of policies continue that
have been in place, then we will be
in real danger," she said, "if not in
this war then the next one. Look
at this administration's history.
It's a recurring theme of U.S.
imperialism that goes back for
years."
"[Chair of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff] Colin Powell says we have
to hang out a shingle that says
'superpower,'" Edoga continued.
"I don't understand why. The
destruction of other people and
other cultures ... has little to do
with me."
Edoga said her anti-war beliefs
extend beyond the Gulf war. "It's
not just this war. Unless we start
to address issues like economic
disparity, lack of funding for
scholarships and continued mili
tary spending, we will remain in
this continuum," she said.
She also said she thinks stu
dent activism will have far-reach

ing effects. "I think Stanford stu
dents have really proved them
selves on this issue," Edoga said.
"In Palo Alto, San Francisco and
on campus, [there are] large num
bers of people who are working
with Students for Peace."
"I think that people are watch
ing us," she said. "The govern
ment has an excellent idea of
who's [at the rallies], and I think
it should. If people are saying that
in 1992 we are not voting for any
one who voted for this war, I
know I would take notice."
Edoga speaks about her
activism with a bit of personal
pride. "When I went home," she
said, "my parents said, 'You can't
change the world.' They were
having fun with their radical fem
inist daughter." Edoga added that
after hearing Angela Davis speak
at last week's teach-in, she told
her friends that she, like Davis in
the 19605, wanted "to be on the
FBl's top-10 most-wanted list."
"But it's very important to me
not to grow out of activism or out
of the beliefs that are central to
me," Edoga continued. "I want to
try and hold on to that. It has a lot
to do with me."

role in the Stanford movement, speaking at ral
lies, organizing events and even participating in a
workshop on civil disobedience. Though a heart
condition makes her rely on an electric wheelchair
for traveling longer distances, Edoga's activism
has not been hampered by her disability.
"It's always important to articulate your posi
tion within society," Edoga said. "My activism is
very personal. It's very much a reflection of my
interests. Part of activism, fighting for disability
rights or fighting for minority rights, is a way in
which I look out for myself."
The anti-war movement is just one outlet for
Edoga's energies. In addition to her involvement
in Stanford Students for Peace events and the
organization of last week's teach-in on the war in
the Persian Gulf, Edoga also acts in Stanford
plays, writes for Aurora magazine and is involved
in the Pro-Choice Alliance.
Although the campus anti-war movement has
not formally elected student leaders, Edoga's
involvement has placed her at the forefront of the
group. "[The anti-war movement] isn't a group
that has chosen to have leadership," she said. "We
try very hard to work on a consensus level." How
ever, her personal efforts have helped create
numerous campus rallies, marches and discus
sions involving students, faculty and community
members.
Edoga cites the large turnout at anti-war
demonstrations as evidence that the nation sup
ports the movement's beliefs. "I don't think
Americans are behind this war," she said. "I have

a very strong feeling that Ameri
cans are being lied to by the media
and the administration. We're
being told Saddam Hussein is a
madman — what are Americans
going to say other than, 'Go,
Bush'?"
"Rallies for peace show other
people that they are not isolated
in their feelings about this war,"
Edoga said. "It's very empower
ing to see yourself surrounded by
people who feel the same way you
do. And it gets people to do con
crete things, whether that's [writ
ing] a letter, [making] a phone call
or [receiving] draft counseling. It
gets people moving."
Edoga said her personal beliefs
about the Persian Gulf war didn't
become formulated until late fall
quarter. "I didn't get involved
until the end of November,"
Edoga said. "I was very uncertain
about the issue. Even at the first
rally, I hadn't decided how I felt."
"But I sat down with a friend
who told me a lot about the his
tory of the Middle East and

explained the United States'
involvement," Edoga said. "She
feared that her brother would be
drafted, and I started thinking
about my brother, too."
Edoga's beliefs have definitely
solidified since that first rally. "If
the kind of policies continue that
have been in place, then we will be
in real danger," she said, "if not in
this war then the next one. Look
at this administration's history.
It's a recurring theme of U.S.
imperialism that goes back for
years."
"[Chair of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff] Colin Powell says we have
to hang out a shingle that says
'superpower,'" Edoga continued.
"I don't understand why. The
destruction of other people and
other cultures ... has little to do
with me."
Edoga said her anti-war beliefs
extend beyond the Gulf war. "It's
not just this war. Unless we start
to address issues like economic
disparity, lack of funding for
scholarships and continued mili
tary spending, we will remain in
this continuum," she said.
She also said she thinks stu
dent activism will have far-reach

ing effects. "I think Stanford stu
dents have really proved them
selves on this issue," Edoga said.
"In Palo Alto, San Francisco and
on campus, [there are] large num
bers of people who are working
with Students for Peace."
"I think that people are watch
ing us," she said. "The govern
ment has an excellent idea of
who's [at the rallies], and I think
it should. If people are saying that
in 1992 we are not voting for any
one who voted for this war, I
know I would take notice."
Edoga speaks about her
activism with a bit of personal
pride. "When I went home," she
said, "my parents said, 'You can't
change the world.' They were
having fun with their radical fem
inist daughter." Edoga added that
after hearing Angela Davis speak
at last week's teach-in, she told
her friends that she, like Davis in
the 19605, wanted "to be on the
FBl's top-10 most-wanted list."
"But it's very important to me
not to grow out of activism or out
of the beliefs that are central to
me," Edoga continued. "I want to
try and hold on to that. It has a lot
to do with me."
