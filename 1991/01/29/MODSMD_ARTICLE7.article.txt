# Gulf war prompts Palo Alto protests
## 
### Marie Bui Staff writer 
Palo Alto has hardly been con
sidered a hotbed of protest move
ments in the past, but that may
have changed with the beginning
of the war in the Middle East.
The rally and march through
Palo Alto in response to the start
of bombing raids on Iraq involved
more than 1,000 people, one of the
largest turnouts for an anti-war
demonstration in the city's his
tory, according to Paul George,
director of the Peninsula Peace
Center, one of the groups that
organized the rally
Larger crowds gathered in this
area to rally against the Vietnam
War in the late 1960s and early
19705. But most of those protests
— such as the one in which 4,000
students convened in Frost
Amphitheatre in May 1970 to
voice their opposition to U.S.
bombings in Cambodia —
occurred on campus and were
attended almost exclusively by
Stanford students.
At that time, little was heard
from the University's neighbors
on the other side of El Camino
Real.
The rise in activism two weeks
ago occurred despite the fact that
Palo Alto's population has become
older and wealthier in recent
years. According to census data
and projections, the number of
senior citizens living in Palo Alto
increased by a factor of 12 in the
past 20 years. Other age groups
merely doubled, and some
decreased.
Rising property values over the
past two decades forced low
income families and individuals to
move out. And average income
rose 92 percent between 1980 and
1989. At more than $61,000 per
family, Palo Alto's average income
is almost double the national aver
age.
But Palo Alto's older, richer
population did not sit back com

fortably as marchers took to the
streets, George said. He added
that he took a careful look at the
protesters on the night of Jan. 16
and found that they represented a
broad cross-section of the city's
population.
"There were families with
young children, grandparents,
high school students, Stanford
students and everybody in
between," he said.
One factor that George said
brought so many different people
together in the town of 56,000 is
the existence of the Peace Center.
The Peninsula Peace Center,
located in a back room of the All
Saints' Episcopal Church on
Waverly Street in Palo Alto, has
been organizing rallies against
U.S. action in the Persian Gulf

since August.
Founded in 1965 as part of the
anti-Vietnam War movement, the
center nearly died out in what
George called the lethargic 19705.
Revived in 1982, the center had
focused mostly on issues in South
and Central America.
But when Iraq invaded Kuwait
and U.S. intervention seemed
inevitable, the center shifted its
emphasis to the Middle East.
"Organizing demonstrations is
something that naturally falls to
the Peace Center," because of net
works with other peace groups
and interested people, George
said.
Stephie Reader, a volunteer
who raced up to San Mateo in her
tiny Toyota Tercel to pick up two
concert-sized amplifiers for the

protest the night the war began,
echoed George's beliefs.
"Having .. . the Peace Center .
.. to hold regular meetings, pro
vides the infrastructure for ade
quate articulation of community
concern," she said.
As far back as October, the vol
unteers at the center were passing
out fliers that designated several
meeting places for a rally as soon
as war broke out. The places and
times suggested then were 5:30
p.m. in front of Palo Alto's city
hall, 11 p.m. between Meyer and
Green libraries and noon in White
Plaza. When war broke out, peo
ple rallied in all of those places.
Reader said people at the Peace
Center believed President Bush
was "squashing negotiations, so
we were planning for there to be a

war and for us to react."
Volunteers were assigned vari
ous duties, from contacting police
and media to monitoring crowds
to prevent violence.
The center developed three
plans to respond to war, depend
ing upon what time of day the
news reached the United States.
"I was convinced it would be
Wednesday night," George said.
He was so sure of his predic
tion, he even packed an overnight
bag Wednesday morning.
George said good weather con
ditions in the Gulf, including a
new moon, would deteriorate
soon, making night raids difficult.
He also said pressures on Bush,
the passing of the Jan. 15 deadline
and gradual lessening of popular
support for Operation Desert

Shield led him to anticipate war
soon after the deadline passed.
And so, Wednesday afternoon,
with rumors flying in from Wash
ington about the bombings, the
Peace Center began telephoning
other peace organizations and
members.
With only one-and-a-half
hours' notice, the volunteers from
the Peace Center organized an
enormous rally. They built on
their experience from past rallies,
Reader said.
"But the last thing I want to do
is arrange demonstrations,"
George said, explaining that he
would rather see the war end.
On the wall above his desk
hangs a flier with a black silhou
ette of Vietnam and a rose. It
reads, "Vietnam Never Again."

Palo Alto has hardly been con
sidered a hotbed of protest move
ments in the past, but that may
have changed with the beginning
of the war in the Middle East.
The rally and march through
Palo Alto in response to the start
of bombing raids on Iraq involved
more than 1,000 people, one of the
largest turnouts for an anti-war
demonstration in the city's his
tory, according to Paul George,
director of the Peninsula Peace
Center, one of the groups that
organized the rally
Larger crowds gathered in this
area to rally against the Vietnam
War in the late 1960s and early
19705. But most of those protests
— such as the one in which 4,000
students convened in Frost
Amphitheatre in May 1970 to
voice their opposition to U.S.
bombings in Cambodia —
occurred on campus and were
attended almost exclusively by
Stanford students.
At that time, little was heard
from the University's neighbors
on the other side of El Camino
Real.
The rise in activism two weeks
ago occurred despite the fact that
Palo Alto's population has become
older and wealthier in recent
years. According to census data
and projections, the number of
senior citizens living in Palo Alto
increased by a factor of 12 in the
past 20 years. Other age groups
merely doubled, and some
decreased.
Rising property values over the
past two decades forced low
income families and individuals to
move out. And average income
rose 92 percent between 1980 and
1989. At more than $61,000 per
family, Palo Alto's average income
is almost double the national aver
age.
But Palo Alto's older, richer
population did not sit back com

fortably as marchers took to the
streets, George said. He added
that he took a careful look at the
protesters on the night of Jan. 16
and found that they represented a
broad cross-section of the city's
population.
"There were families with
young children, grandparents,
high school students, Stanford
students and everybody in
between," he said.
One factor that George said
brought so many different people
together in the town of 56,000 is
the existence of the Peace Center.
The Peninsula Peace Center,
located in a back room of the All
Saints' Episcopal Church on
Waverly Street in Palo Alto, has
been organizing rallies against
U.S. action in the Persian Gulf

since August.
Founded in 1965 as part of the
anti-Vietnam War movement, the
center nearly died out in what
George called the lethargic 19705.
Revived in 1982, the center had
focused mostly on issues in South
and Central America.
But when Iraq invaded Kuwait
and U.S. intervention seemed
inevitable, the center shifted its
emphasis to the Middle East.
"Organizing demonstrations is
something that naturally falls to
the Peace Center," because of net
works with other peace groups
and interested people, George
said.
Stephie Reader, a volunteer
who raced up to San Mateo in her
tiny Toyota Tercel to pick up two
concert-sized amplifiers for the

protest the night the war began,
echoed George's beliefs.
"Having .. . the Peace Center .
.. to hold regular meetings, pro
vides the infrastructure for ade
quate articulation of community
concern," she said.
As far back as October, the vol
unteers at the center were passing
out fliers that designated several
meeting places for a rally as soon
as war broke out. The places and
times suggested then were 5:30
p.m. in front of Palo Alto's city
hall, 11 p.m. between Meyer and
Green libraries and noon in White
Plaza. When war broke out, peo
ple rallied in all of those places.
Reader said people at the Peace
Center believed President Bush
was "squashing negotiations, so
we were planning for there to be a

war and for us to react."
Volunteers were assigned vari
ous duties, from contacting police
and media to monitoring crowds
to prevent violence.
The center developed three
plans to respond to war, depend
ing upon what time of day the
news reached the United States.
"I was convinced it would be
Wednesday night," George said.
He was so sure of his predic
tion, he even packed an overnight
bag Wednesday morning.
George said good weather con
ditions in the Gulf, including a
new moon, would deteriorate
soon, making night raids difficult.
He also said pressures on Bush,
the passing of the Jan. 15 deadline
and gradual lessening of popular
