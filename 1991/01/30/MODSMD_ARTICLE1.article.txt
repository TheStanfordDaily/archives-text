# Allied attack kills POW, Iraq reports
## 
### 
DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) — One of
Iraq's "human shields" — captured allied
pilots — was killed in a Baghdad air raid, the
Iraqis said yesterday. Other Desert Storm fliers
struck anew across Iraq and reported stopping
an Iraqi armored convoy dead in its desert
tracks.
But U.S. and Soviet officials held out hope of
peace. A joint statement from Secretary of
State James Baker and Soviet Foreign Minister
Alexander Bessmertnykh indicated a cease-fire
could be called if Iraq took "concrete steps" to
withdraw from Kuwait.
The statement said it "will be especially
important" to try to resolve the Arab-Israeli
conflict after the Gulf war is over. Saddam
Hussein has sought to link the Palestinian
issue with his invasion of Kuwait.
Meanwhile, on land and sea, the tempo of
the Persian Gulf war quickened.
Both sides reported clashes and claimed

small victories along the remote northern
frontier. On the Kuwaiti coast, allied heli
copters attacked and chased a flotilla of
Iraqi machine-gun boats.
Refugees fleeing to Jordan told of non
stop bombardment, "fire everywhere" and
civilian casualties in Iraq. "It is really hell,"
one woman said.
The U.S. command still seemed puzzled,
meanwhile, by the estimated 90 getaway
flights of Iraqi warplanes to Iran. But an
American general warned the Iraqis that if
they tried to return to their home bases,
"we'll get them."
Congressional sources in Washingtons
said yesterday an Iraqi transport plane had
returned to Iraq. The sources, who spoke
after receiving a military briefing on the
war, had no other details about the cargo or
who was on board.
The Iraqis, who claim to hold more than
20 downed pilots, said Jan. 21 they were
dispersing the prisoners to potential target
sites in an effort to ward off allied air
attacks.
It was a repetition of Saddam's "human
shield" tactic of late last year, when he sent
Western civilian hostages to strategic sites.

They were later released.
On Monday, Iraqi broadcasts said an
unspecified number of POWs had been
wounded in air raids. Yesterday, the official
Iraqi News Agency said one was dead.
"One of the raids hit one of the depart
ments of the Ministry of Industry, killing
one of the captured foreign pilots, who had
been evacuated to that department," the
agency report said.
Iran's news agency quoted Baghdad
Radio as saying the victim was an Ameri
can. But no Iraqi broadcasts monitored by
The Associated Press mentioned the
nationalities or identities of any of the
reported victims, and the reports were oth
erwise unconfirmed. Fifteen Americans are
listed as missing or as prisoners.
The Geneva Convention on treatment of
prisoners of war — to which Iraq is a signa
tory — prohibits placing prisoners at likely
target areas. The U.S. government has
denounced Iraq's handling of the captured
pilots, and yesterday the State Department
said it was summoning Iraq's ranking
diplomat in Washington "to raise concern"
about the pilots.
"We declare to the world public opinion
that the United States bears responsibility
for the consequences of the ugly crimes it is
committing against our people and the cap
tured pilots who are hosted by Iraq," the
news agency said.
