Tired of standing in line at the Book
store? If an ASSU "Book-Buying Ser
vice," one of four ASSU business project
start-up proposals, is implemented, you
may never have to stand in line again.
ASSU Financial Manager Torrence
Boone said last week that the committee
to select a new project had narrowed its
list of 16 proposals to four ideas: a book
buying service, ASSU Friday Classic
Flicks, a used compact disc/cassette tape
store and a video store.
The latter two ideas were proposed
independently by more than one individ
ual or group, but any party that submit
ted a one-page proposal for one of the
four ideas is now invited to submit a
detailed business plan to the committee,

Boone said. If the committee does select
a project, its originator will be awarded
$500.
Boone said the Flicks proposal and
the book-buying service will be asked to
explain how their ideas could be incorpo
rated into existing projects such as Sun
day Flicks or the ASSU's Beat the Book
store service.
The ASSU plans to do a student poll
asking students which business project
they would prefer, Boone said. He called
the results of that poll "an important
factor," but added that profitability,
space and practicality will also be consid
ered.
Boone said he hopes the project will
be selected by the end of the quarter.
The new project would replace the
ASSU dry cleaning service, which went
out of business last spring.
