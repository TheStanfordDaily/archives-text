# Workers desire better opportunities for growth

William Han is a cook at Lagunita Court
on weekdays, a bartender on weekends and
a political science mqjor at San Jose State
University in the summers.
Han, who aspires to be a lawyer, is one of
about 1,100 Stanford staff members who
seek education outside the University,
because little is offered within it. Human
Resources Services holds some training
courses for staff members but has no pro
gram to track their career developments
and promote their education.
Judith Moss, Human Resources pro
gram manager, said of the training courses,
"I don't think any of them should be viewed
as educational programs." She said tracing
staff education is difficult because the Uni
versity has no centralized figures for the
level of education among its workers.
But she added, "As we learn more about
the nature of our staff. .., we're constantly
looking at (their) needs."
Criticisms of Stanford
Stanford's staff education programs are
not as extensive as those at San Francisco
State and Santa Clara Universities. The
two other schools have full-tuition-reim

bursement programs for staff members
who take courses at the universities, while
Stanford's program is relatively limited.
Mike Tatham, a United Stanford Work
ers field representative, sees staff education
as part of career advancement, which he
said Stanford neglects. He added that
instead of preparing its own workers for
career advancement, Stanford tends to hire
supervisors from outside the University.
"Where Stanford is very lacking is that
there are no career ladders, no promotions
from within. Workers are forced to go out
side for upward mobility," he charged.
But Valerie Beeman, a development spe
cialist at Human Resources, said that the
department encourages supervisors to
think about employees' career paths. She
also pointed out that staff members are free
to audit University courses.
"The bottom line is that the individual
employee has to take the initiative," argued
Beeman, who is studying for a master's
degree in public administration at San Jose
State University "It's not that I've stopped
(my education); I'm taking a different
option, because the Stanford option isn't
available," she said.
