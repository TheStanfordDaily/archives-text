# Workers desire better opportunities for growth

William Han is a cook at Lagunita Court
on weekdays, a bartender on weekends and
a political science mqjor at San Jose State
University in the summers.
Han, who aspires to be a lawyer, is one of
about 1,100 Stanford staff members who
seek education outside the University,
because little is offered within it. Human
Resources Services holds some training
courses for staff members but has no pro
gram to track their career developments
and promote their education.
Judith Moss, Human Resources pro
gram manager, said of the training courses,
"I don't think any of them should be viewed
as educational programs." She said tracing
staff education is difficult because the Uni
versity has no centralized figures for the
level of education among its workers.
But she added, "As we learn more about
the nature of our staff. .., we're constantly
looking at (their) needs."
Criticisms of Stanford
Stanford's staff education programs are
not as extensive as those at San Francisco
State and Santa Clara Universities. The
two other schools have full-tuition-reim

bursement programs for staff members
who take courses at the universities, while
Stanford's program is relatively limited.
Mike Tatham, a United Stanford Work
ers field representative, sees staff education
as part of career advancement, which he
said Stanford neglects. He added that
instead of preparing its own workers for
career advancement, Stanford tends to hire
supervisors from outside the University.
"Where Stanford is very lacking is that
there are no career ladders, no promotions
from within. Workers are forced to go out
side for upward mobility," he charged.
But Valerie Beeman, a development spe
cialist at Human Resources, said that the
department encourages supervisors to
think about employees' career paths. She
also pointed out that staff members are free
to audit University courses.
"The bottom line is that the individual
employee has to take the initiative," argued
Beeman, who is studying for a master's
degree in public administration at San Jose
State University "It's not that I've stopped
(my education); I'm taking a different
option, because the Stanford option isn't
available," she said.
Course offerings
This quarter, Human
Resources runs courses and work
shops on topics such as manage
ment skills, English as a second
language and productivity. The
Data Center and Controller's
Office also hold courses on com
puter skills and telephone train
ing.
Moss said these courses are not
directly aimed at career advance
ment, but at teaching employees
more about how University sys
tems work. She reasoned this
might indirectly help careers,
because "as people become more
and more involved, they learn
about the possibilities in the Uni
versity."
But many employees are not
aware of these courses, according
to Frances Morales, director of El
Centro Chicano. "Does the infor
mation trickle down, especially if
employees don't have basic read
ing skills?" she asked.
Tuition reimbursement
The University also runs a
Staff Training Assistance Pro
gram, which partially reimburses
regular staff members for the cost
of university or training courses.
This program allows $140 per
quarter or $187 per semester,
which "doesn't provide an enor

mous amount," Moss acknowl
edged.
For Kathy Sunders, a mail
clerk, the reimbursement falls far
short of her fees at San Francisco
State University. Sunders pays
$90 per unit, or $270 for each 3-
unit class, apart from the cost of
books.
"I have tuition reimbursement,
but it doesn't touch what [the
courses] cost," she said.
But Beeman argued that reim
bursement is an added benefit of
employment at Stanford. "I can
understand the frustration . . .
when, for some people, (reim
bursement) pays a fraction of
what [tuition] costs. But I still feel
we're lucky to have extra benefits,
in addition to medical (care)."
Besides these programs, staff
training is decentralized. There
fore, the support a staff member
receives depends on his or her
supervisor and varies from
department to department.
"There is no centralized pro
gram for succession," said Moss.
"We have great interest in looking
at a succession program through
out the University, but no devel
opment as yet."
Effects of budget cuts
Moves to improve staff devel
opment are being limited by Uni
versity budget shortages. An
existing program, the Stanford
Literacy Project, has already been
cut.
The project helps employees
develop their English language

skills. "The project aims to match
up tutors . . . with Stanford
employees who come primarily
from Housing and Food Services
and Operations and Mainte
nance," explained co-organizer
Joanne Lin, a junior.
This summer, the University
stopped its contribution to the
project of $125 per quarter per
student because of budget cuts.
There were usually about 80 stu
dents per year.
Pedro Castenada, former direc
tor of the project, said the Univer
sity also cannot allow employees
time off to attend classes, even if
the project found funding else
where.
Because of cuts, the project's
staff of four paid employees was
laid off. It is now run by two stu
dent volunteers who enlist other
students to teach. The revived
project just started last week.
"We're still struggling for fund
ing," said Lin.
Because of repositioning,
Human Resources does not yet
know what direction staff educa
tion and advancement programs
will take in future, Moss said.
Human Resources has been
undergoing reorganization for
two years and is hiring a new vice
president.
Meanwhile, Han intends to go
back to San Jppe State this sum
mer, despite the recession.
"I have to go for it. That's why
I save my money."
