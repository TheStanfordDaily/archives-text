I.R.S. levies big fines
WASHINGTON (AP) - Dickie Ann Conn of
San Jose, Calif., knew she had some minor tax
problems because of some disputed deduc
tions, so she was expecting a bad-news letter
from the Internal Revenue Service. She got it
in spades.
Ms. Conn, part owner of a computer con
sulting business, was billed for $67,714 in back
taxes for six years — plus a penalty of more
than $646,700,000.
"I sat down and counted the digits several
times before I could bring myself to believe
what the form said," Ms. Conn said.
According to an affidavit made public yes
terday by the National Coalition of IRS
Whistleblowers, Ms. Conn called the IRS in
San Diego to have the mistake corrected and
was told by a clerk that the only recourse was
to file suit in Tax Court.
Bar to try again on client sex
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - After deadlocking
on rival proposals to regulate sexual contact
between lawyers and clients, the State Bar's
governing board plans to make another
attempt in March.
The Board of Governors on Saturday voted
down both relatively mild and strict versions of
first-in-the-nation ethical standards on
lawyer-client sex. The board also rejected an
attempted compromise, but State Bar Presi
dent Charles Vogel said Monday the associa
tion will continue its efforts.
"I want a rule adopted," Vogel said. "I don't
want to ignore the Legislature's mandate" or
risk a lawsuit.
Vogel said he would favor a compromise
that would ban sexual relations between
lawyers and clients in divorce cases and other
family law matters. In other types of cases,
sexual contact would be forbidden only if it was
coerced or interfered with legal representation.
