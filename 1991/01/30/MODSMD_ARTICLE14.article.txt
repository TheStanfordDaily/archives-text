# Bush's address speaks of the 'winds of change'
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President Bush
confidently assured Americans yesterday
night that the war against Iraq will be won
and the recession at home will end in short
order. "We stand at a defining hour," the
president said in his State of the Union
address.
"For two centuries, we've done the hard
work of freedom. And tonight, we lead the
world in facing down a threat to decency
and humanity," Bush said.
He won a long standing ovation when he
praised U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf as
"truly America's finest" and again when he
predicted "we will prevail" over Saddam
Hussein.
It was the first wartime State of the
Union address since the dark days of Viet
nam and the most potent mon .ents came
with reference to America's troops abroad.
Extraordinary security precautions
enshrouded the Capitol, a bow to the bois
terous threats of terrorism by Iraq.
Shortly before the president spoke, a
joint U.S.-Soviet statement hinted a cease
fire would be possible if Iraq took concrete
steps" to withdraw from Kuwait. The
White House said later the statement rep
resented no change in policy, and only a
"massive withdrawal" could end the hostil
ities.
The two superpowers also called for a
"meaningful peace process" to deal with
the Arab-Israeli dispute once the war was
over.
With those diplomatic developments
reverberating in the background, the presi

dent delivered his nationally broadcast
address to Congress.
"As Americans, we know there are times
when we must step forward and accept our
responsibility to lead the world away from
the dark chaos of dictators, toward the
brighter promise of a better day," Bush said
in his 48-minute speech.
The president delivered a terse assess
ment of the war to date: "I'm pleased to
report that we are on course. Iraq's capac
ity to sustain war is being destroyed.
"Time will not be Saddam's salvation."
With Americans' attention focused on
the almost half-million troops risking their
lives in the Persian Gulf, Bush devoted the
heart of his annual address to the two
week-old battle to force Saddam out of
Kuwait.
In the Congress, Democrats and Repub
licans rallied behind the president. "Now
that war has begun, we'll work to see that
it's swift and decisive, with the least possi
ble loss of life," said Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, one of
those who had preferred more diplomacy to
war.
Bush was careful to address the nation's
festering domestic concerns.
"There are reasons to be optimistic
about our economy," Bush said, citing low
inflation and record export levels by U.S.
firms.
Despite the clouds of war and recession,
Bush said, "If anyone tells you America's
best days are behind her, they're looking
the wrong way."
