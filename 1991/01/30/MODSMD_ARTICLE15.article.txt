Greece and Turkey, both NATO
members supporting the allied coali

began.

Dev Sol, a Marxist underground
organization, claimed responsibility
for the attacks on the French con
sulate in Ankara and U.S.-affiliated

organiations in the port city of Izmir.
The group said it was protesting the
"occupation of the Mideast by imperi
alist forces," an apparent reference to
the U.S.-led allied forces in Saudi Ara
bia, the semi-official Anatolia news
agency reported.
There was no immediate claim of
responsibility for the rocket attack yes
terday in Athens, but police suspect
the leftist November 17 group.
In Ankara, one passer-by was
injured from flying glass when the
bomb exploded in front of the French
consulate, the Anatolia news agency
reported. Two cars parked nearby
burned, and windows of two apart
ment buildings across the street were
shattered, it said.
Firebombs were also thrown at two
cars belonging to U.S. military person
nel near Ankara. The cars were badly

damaged, but there were no injuries,
police said.
In Istanbul, a bomb exploded near
the office of a group identified by Ana
tolia as the American Union of
Churches. The blast caused extensive
damage but no injuries.
A bomb also exploded in Istanbul in
the garden of the Italian consulate,
police said. No injuries were reported.
There were no immediate claims of
responsibility for the attacks in Istan
bul or against the U.S. soldiers.
In Izmir, about 300 miles west of
Ankara, the city's police chief, Sukru
Yetimoglu, shattered his eardrum
when a bomb that police were attempt
ing to defuse exploded at the Turkish-
U.S. cultural center, Anatolia said. His
driver and a passer-by were also
injured slightly.
Another explosion occurred a depot

operated by the U.S. military damaged
some cars and broke windows. There
were no reports of injuries.
In the past week, bombs have gone
off in Ankara, Istanbul and the south
ern city of Adana. Dev Sol claimed
responsibility for most of those
attacks.
Turkey has allowed the use of Incir
lik air base near Adana by U.S. war
planes bombing targets in Iraq.
The rocket attack at the Athens BP
office occurred a day after a similar
blast damaged the Athens branch of
American Express. No injuries were
reported.
Police attribute both explosions to
the November 17 group, named after
the day in 1973 when the right-wing
military dictatorship violently crushed
a student protest.
