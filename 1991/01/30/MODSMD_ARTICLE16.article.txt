# Devastating oil spill moves south

RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) -
Saudi Arabia has sounded an
international ecological alarm as
it moves to prevent the wholesale
death of coral reefs, turtles, birds
and other animals from history's
greatest oil spill.
With the slick already polluting
some areas of the Saudi Arabian
coastline, teams have been dis
patched to rescue wildlife and sur
vey the general impact, a leading
Saudi environmental official said
yesterday.
Abdulaziz Abuzinada, the sec
retary-general of the National
Commission for Wildlife Conser
vation and Development, said
booms were placed around the
Jena, Keram, Kereen and Jeried
islands in the Persian Gulf to pro
tect vital nesting grounds for
thousands of birds and sea turtles.
Abuzinada said his agency was
establishing links with wildlife
experts around the world, hoping
to create a task force to aid the
animals in distress or destroy
those beyond help.
U.S. and Saudi military offi
cials say the slick was deliberately
caused by Iraq opening the tap at

Kuwait's Al-Ahmadi oil tanker
station. They describe the action
as "ecological terrorism."
American warplanes bombed
two onshore piping facilities Sat
urday that were connected to an
oflshore terminal from which an
estimated 460 million gallons of
oil gushed into the gulf. On Mon
day, the U.S. military said it
believed the spill — estimated to
be 35 miles long and 10 miles wide
— had been largely stopped at the
source.
"The problem is so large that
no assurance can be given that the
available resources and expertise
will be able to prevent severe eco
logical damage," Abuzinada said.
A team of American experts
has arrived and other countries
and private citizens have offered
help. But Abuzinada stressed
there still was great need for more
international assistance.
He said it would be difficult to
protect ail ecologically important
areas along the slick's southward
Eath, and indicated priority was
eing given to warding off the
slick from water desalination and
electricity generation plants along

Saudi Arabia's gulf coast.
Oil industry experts estimated
that the slick would hit Jubail —
site of the world's largest desali
nation plant — in about three
days. U.S. officials said the spill's
leading edge was heading south at
15 miles a day but there were also
reports of speedier movement.
Industry experts warn that
high waves or heavy currents
could splash oil over booms
designed to protect against the
slick.
Even if the booms keep out the
bulk of the oil, the desalination
plants' mechanisms could be
fouled by crude that disolves and
sinks beneath the surface and is
sucked into the plants' intake
pipes.
Japanese manufacturers of the
Saudi desalination plants warned
that the facilities were not
equipped to process oil-polluted
water.
"Our plants are designed for
normal sea water. They must be
shut down if there is oil in the
water," said a spokesman for Mit
subishi Heavy Industries, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.


A Saudi Arabian government information officer, Mohammed Al-Hader, examines a dead oil-coated cor
morant yesterday at Kafji near the Kuwaiti border. The oil spill is expected to annihilate much of the
Gulf's wildlife for years.
