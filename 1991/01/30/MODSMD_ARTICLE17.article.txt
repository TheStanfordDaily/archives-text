# Deposit insurance drying up rapidly

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The govern
ment fund protecting more than $2 tril
lion in bank deposits will run dry soon
after Sept. 30, the Congressional Budget
Office told Congress yesterday.
If the recession is severe, instead of
mild as expected, that raises the
prospect of a taxpayer bailout of banks
to follow the massive bailout of savings
and loan institutions, the office said.
"If banks are unable to recapitalize
(the fund), there would appear to be lit
tle alternative to calling on the
resources of the Treasury â€” that is, the
taxpayers," said Robert Reischauer,
director of the office.
Members of the Senate Banking
Committee panel received the news
somberly, some noting the similarity
between the deterioration of the bank
fund, the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., and the earlier collapse of the
fund insuring savings and loan deposits.
"It's a rather stunning develop
ment," said Sen. Donald Riegle Jr., D-
Mich., chairman of the committee. He
warned that given the government's
history of estimating financial prob
lems, the budget office was probably

understating the need for more money.
"My guess is that bank balance
sheets are a lot worse than they appear
at the present time," he said.
"I'm concerned that with each suc
ceeding testimony and each succeeding
witness we confront, the situation wors
ens," said Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md.
"It's increasingly becoming a crisis situ
ation."
Reischauer told the committee,
"Within a year or so, the fund will be
out of cash and insolvent without some
... infusion,"
The forecast is based on the assump
tion the economy will suffer a milder
than-average recession, causing 596
bank failures between last July 1990
and December 1993.
It also assumes premiums banks pay
for deposit insurance will increase sub
stantially from 19.5 cents for every $100
in deposits to 30 cents by Jan. 1, 1993.
The fund balance "would almost dis
appear by the end of (fiscal year) 1991
on Sept. 30, Reischauer said.
The FDIC itself is less pessimistic. It
has said the fund will still nave about $4
billion on Dec. 31, down from $18.3 bil

lion three years ago.
Reischauer predicted the fund likely
will need to borrow $11 billion from the
Treasury. He recommended increasing
the FDIC's borrowing limit from the
current $5 billion to around $15 billion.
Reischauer said the fund should be
able to repay the Treasury within five
years out of premiums from banks. But,
he warned that the borrowing needs
would increase dramatically to $38 bil
lion in the event of a severe recession.
At some point, the borrowing could
grow so large that the industry would be
unable to repay it, he said.
Both Riegle and Sen. Jim Sasser, D-
Tenn., chairman of the Senate Budget
Committee, said they hoped to avoid
spending taxpayer money for banks.
"We want to do everything possible to
avoid turning the recapitalization of the
bank insurance fund into another mas
sive taxpayer expenditure," Sasser said.
The CBO's forecast follows another
pessimistic projection prepared for the
Bush administration's budget, due out
next Monday, by the Office of Manage
ment and Budget.
