The government must
give a Tree' press more
liberty during wartime

OVER THE PAST TWO
weeks, the American public
has been bombarded with a
stream of varied images of war in
the Persian Gulf, all of them hav
ing one thing in common: They
have all been slanted, approved by
the U.S. military.
The Pentagon has established a
number of press pools that herd
the reporters to locations specified
by the military so journalists can
talk to soldiers specified by the mil
itary. Always present is a public
affairs official hovering in the
background to censor "sensitive
information."
Since the military is far from an
impartial observer in this whole
affair, it is inherently wrong for it
to be the primary source of infor
mation in an international conflict
of this magnitude. The potential
for abuse is enormous.
For instance, the military origi
nally told the public after the first
few days of fighting that the bomb
ing raids had been 80 percent suc
cessful in hitting their targets.
What this actually meant, it came
out later, was that 80 percent of the
aircraft took off, dropped their pay
load and returned. Whether or not
they hit their target was not part of
the calculation.
The American military has justi
fied its censorship of the press in
the Persian Gulf on two counts.
First, the release of-classified infor
mation could hurt national secu
rity and give Saddam Hussein an
edge in the war.
Obviously, there should be some

rules about information that the
press could not release, such as
troop locations, but the simple
privilege of being able to speak to a
random soldier without a military
public affairs officer acting as Big
Brother should be granted.
The second justification for the
censorship is the physical safety of
the journalists. But if the Ameri
can journalists want to cover the
fighting on the front lines or report
from hotel rooms in Baghdad, then
they should be free to do so at their
own risk. If they want to put their
lives on the line in the interest of
their job, then by all means let
them do it.
These two justifications for the
censorship, although undoubtedly
a part of the real reason, obscure
the underlying justification for the
control of the press.
The military has to put a high
priority on avoiding the kind of
media coverage the Vietnam War
received, especially during the lat
ter phases of that conflict.
There is the lingering sense that
somehow the media, through jits
coverage of the slaughter in Viet
nam, lost that war by turning the
American public against the mili
tary.
During Vietnam, the American
public could see the devastation of
the war with only a lapse of a cou
ple of days between the event and
its broadcast on TV In this war,
Americans can see it live. The Bush
administration, in trying to make
this war seem as clean as possible,
cannot afford to have dying sol
diers shown on television, even
though that is a fact of war.
As in Vietnam, the media need
to serve as a valuable source of
objective information, confirming
the claims of the military and
countering them when they are
obviously misleading. As in Viet
nam, the army must let them.
