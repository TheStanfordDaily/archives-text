# SLAC workers expect layoffs
## 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
Almost two months later than expected, the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center will specify either
today or tomorrow which 60 or more workers will be
laid off due to a shortfall in federal funds, according
to Doug Dupen, deputy director of employee rela
tions.
Lee Lyon, director of personnel, said in a Dec. 5
interview with The Daily that the laboratory would
begin issuing layoff notices in mid-December and
that he expected the process to be completed by mid-
Februaiy at the latest.
Dupen said the delay "is not really a delay" and
that the laboratory is taking the extra time to do
"what's absolutely correct for the good of the work
ers.
"We learned more and more as the process went
on that it would take some time" to decide who
should be laid off, he said, noting that the laboratory
directors want to follow all layoff procedures closely
and review their decisions before implementation.
But United Stanford Workers field representative
Ruben Serna criticized SLAC for its delay.
"Workers are under a lot of stress," Serna said.
"They don't know if they can buy groceries or pay
next month's rent."
Serna said the laboratory has honored the USW
contract by sending the union a letter in November
about the impending layoffs. But
SLAC is not required to notify the
union about how many or which
workers will be targeted, he said.
The electronics division will be
hardest hit by the layoffs because
laboratory research has shifted
from it to the Stanford Linear Col
lider. The layoff will affect other

departments throughout the labo
ratory.
Dupen said the bulk of the lay
offs will happen now, but "that is
no signal there won't be other cuts
later."
Due to federal cuts, SLAC's
1991 budget is $140 million, $10
million less than the 1990 budget.
In a Nov. 27 memo to SLAC's
1,300 employees, director Burton
Richter said the difference will be
made up through personnel and
program reductions.
