Anti-war movement has created whirlwind of pressures

WE ARE MET TODAY BY a com
pelling challenge to maintain our
personal beliefs. For many of us
are now faced by powerful pressures that
threaten our own convictions and deny us
our liberty — the pressures to join the
anti-war movement.
Like most students, I have been follow
ing the crisis in the Gulf since Aug. 2 of
last year. Like many students, I uncov
ered my own feelings and opinions con
cerning the Gulf issue before and after
the war began.
I admire the right to protest, the right
to associate and the right to voice an indi
vidual's opinion about this issue. I respect
those individuals in the movement who
truly believe that war is never justified or
that the policy behind this particular cri
sis has been incorrect.
Yet I am frightened by the pressures
that are placed upon all of us.
I fear that there are many individuals

who have joined the movement because of
a whirlwind of intra-campus pressures.
Because of the nature of our campus,
which is partially separated from the rest
of the world, we are especially vulnerable
to the pressures that exist. These pres
sures are what scare me the most. They
manifest themselves in four forms.
First, some of us feel if we don't join
the movement, then we are doing noth
ing, and that doing something (whether it
be right or wrong) is better than doing
nothing. How can we just sit back, listen
to the news on the radio and read the
newspaper? How can we study in the
library while so many others are out there
protesting? We all want to do something.
Second, the anti-war movement of the
1960s is viewed by our generation as a
romantic and visionary time in this cen
tury. The Vietnam War, Woodstock, the
Beatles, the Who, Dylan, Joplin, the free
dom, the power, the revolt against estab

lishment, free love, the rallies, the signs.
It was a unique and special time, looked
upon still with awe and admiration. We
view that time as a glorious era that until
now only existed in our dreams.
Third, many of us feel that if we don't
jump on the bandwagon now, we will be
missing the "times of our lives." What
will we tell our grandchildren when they
ask what we did when we were in college?
That we attended biology class or that we
protested to stop the war? What sounds
more exciting?
Fourth, throughout campus there
exists a polarization based upon the ques
tion, "What do you think about the war?"
Talking to fellow students is like walking
on broken eggshells. We all want to
express our feelings about the war, yet
many of us are afraid to voice our opinion
for fear of alienating ourselves from oth
ers. It appears that the easiest way to
avoid this alienation is to be silent or to

join the anti-war movement.
Yet these four external pressures are
not valid reasons for participating in the
movement. In order to take part in the
excitement, many of us will brush aside
any thought of the pressures and will
search for appealing arguments against
the war while ignoring many legitimate
arguments on the other side.
By only gathering information we
want to hear, many of us have merely cre
ated a superficial justification for partak
ing in the excitement of the movement.
We dare not forget today that we have
been blessed with certain "unalienable"
rights among which liberty must never be
forgotten. For this reason, we must guard
against the influence of external pres
sures. Let us all, whether we agree or dis
agree with the current plight, once again
feel and think about things for ourselves.
