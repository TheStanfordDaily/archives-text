# Organization should be honest about its position on abortion
## 
### 
I am writing in response to an adver
tisement in the Jan. 23 Daily that I con
sider to be a great disservice to the Stan
ford community. An organization called
the Stanford Crisis Pregnancy Network,
claiming to be a "quiet place away from
the noise of the abortion debate," adver
tises "supportive peer counseling" and
further information ... to help you
decide."
The network does not explicitly state
that it is an anti-choice organization that
does not recognize terminating a preg
nancy as a legitimate option, much less
provide referrals on this option.
By concealing its position in its adver
tisements, the network places itself

squarely in the midst of the abortion
debate.
As a reproductive health counselor at
a medical clinic, I consider it a travesty
that this organization represents itself as
"supportive" and "non-judgmental."
A counselor's role is to support the
interests of the woman and provide
information on all options and resources,
including pre-natal care, health care cov
erage, family services, public and private
adoption agencies and abortion facilities.
I have dealt with clients who come to
my clinic by way of anti-choice organiza
tions (notably Crisis Pregnancy Cen
ters); they arrive feeling confused and
guilty, and are not equipped with medical
information.
The Stanford Crisis Pregnancy Net
work perpetuates misconceptions about
the debate on reproductive choice by
depicting a student being torn apart by
"pro-choice" and "pro-life" factions.
The network should at the very least

be honest with the Stanford community
about its orientation. Better yet, its
members should question who they are
really trying to serve: women or their
own ideology.
