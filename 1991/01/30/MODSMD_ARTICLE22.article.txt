# Forceful 'solutions' will only recreate Saddam Hussein

In "For Your Own Good," Alice Miller
wrote about the severe physical and emo
tional oppression experienced by a young
Adolf Hitler, which Hitler replicated with
horrifying accuracy in a psychodrama he
played out with the Jewish people and
the German nation.
It's no coincidence that Saddam Hus

sein, whose will apparently was broken
in a childhood of violence not unlike
Hitler's, has played out his script and
George Bush, himself an invader of small
countries, is now using violence to purge
Saddam.
We've tried force with the environ
ment, with people and with countries. It
doesn't work for very long. Sooner or
later, the people, places and things we
thought we were rid of reappear in a
more toxic form.
Until we eliminate violence we will
not truly be rid of Adolf Hitler or Sad
dam Hussein. A real victory will be the
day we decline to consider force as an
option.
Only then will we discover and perpet
uate the creativity, the love and the
understanding we all crave, and which
are necessary to live in peace and har
mony on this planet.
