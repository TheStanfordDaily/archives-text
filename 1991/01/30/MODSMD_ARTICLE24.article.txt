## Ambiguous compliance 
### 
MORAL AMBIGUITY IS oppres
sive. Its weight can immobilize
you if you let it. It can transform
you into a disinterested analyst, droning
on and on about the complexity of the war
but failing to take a stand. It can reduce
you to such heartfelt but futile gesures as
waving an American flag to support the
troops.
Reflecting the ambiguity of our
predicament, Americans were evenly
divided before Jan. 16 on whether or not
we should go to war. Now, two weeks into
it, most Americans support Bush's policy.
This shift is not surprising. Before the
war began, it was easy to agree on the
loose objective of opposing Hussein's
aggression while disagreeing on the
means. Many said going to war would
compound the wrongs he had committed
with wrongs of our own and, until sanc
tions had a chance to work, violate the
criterion of last resort.
But with war underway, even many of
those former opponents assume the
means question has been answered, fully
and irreversibly. Rightly concerned about
the impact of a perceived U.S. defeat if we
turn back now, they seem ready to defer
unquestioningly to the supremacy of mil- 11
itary logic, whatever the costs.
Yet believing Hussein should be
opposed need not imply uncritical support
for Bush's policy, even after the war
threshold has been crossed. Nor does a
willingness to challenge that policy reflect
agreement with every anti-war slogan
you hear. If you're caught in the middle,
you may just have to develop a more
refined position (but beware the slippery

slope down to the droning analyst).
The issue is no longer the advisability
of war, but rather how it will be termi
nated. Subsumed under this are the ques
tions of how much escalation we will
countenance in pursuit of U.S. objectives,
as well as how we will respond to the
ongoing expansion of those objectives
themselves.
On escalation, Congressman Tom
Campbell said he would consider the use
of nulcear weapons in this war. This may
seem too preposterous to merit a reply,
but imagine a successful chemical attack
on American soldiers, or even in a U.S.
city. Are you sure that the use of "tacti
cal" nuclear weapons would not then be
considered? Nuclear weapons aside, does
our destruction of Iraq's life-sustaining
infrastructure violate your sense of pro
portionality? Are you concerned that out
rage against American "bullying" around
the world is providing Hussein with sup
port he never had before? Do you oppose
a ground war?
On objectives, our stated goal of liber
ating Kuwait has now clearly evolved to
include the deposition of Hussein. The
rationale for not making this official is
apparently that doing so could prevent
Hussein from surrendering. But it's
unlikely he's under any illusions here. We
should not tolerate, on top of all the other
Pentagon secrecy, anything short of com
plete openness regarding our democratic
government's guiding objectives. Omi
nously, even Soviet Foreign Minister
Bessmertnykh has condemned us for
moving beyond the U.N. mandate.
The emerging contours of a possible,

though still very unlikely, world war
include: the resurgence of a Soviet mili
tary displeased with Gorbachev's supp
port for the U.S.-led war against longtime
ally Iraq; Iran's threats to enter the war if
Israel does; the increasing instability of
all moderate Arab regimes; and the pop
ular upsurge throughout the Islamic
world, including Pakistan, Algeria and
Indonesia. Given this, the demand for an
immediate cease-fire, in all its clarity, may
be a far more prudent (and patriotic) ral
lying cry than commonly believed. Cer
tainly for those fed up with U.S. global
messianism and pacifists who oppose all
war, the moral basis of such a demand is
as clear as ever.
But those grappling with ambiguity
should not exclude themselves from the
debate â€” the intermediate issues of the
limits of acceptable escalation and the
scope of our objectives demand far more
public scrutiny and action. Passivity in
these circumstances ranks much higher
on the scale of sins of apathy than failing
to vote in mid-term elections. Wherever
you stand on the war, make sure someone
else knows. And if you don't have enough
information to make an assessment, get
it.
