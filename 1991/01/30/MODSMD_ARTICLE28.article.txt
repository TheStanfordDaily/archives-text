## Environmental disasters multiply costs of Gulf war 
### June Cohen Editorial staff 
Last week's oil spill, which has already
dumped millions of gallons of crude into the
Persian Gulf, is only one of many environ
mental disasters which could occur during
the war in the Middle East.
These dangers have been overshadowed
in the media by day-to-day military strategy,
yet they have the potential to increase — by
exponential proportions — the costs of war,
in terms of human life, lost resources and
monetary expenditure.
While the oil spill is the most urgent
problem at present, perhaps even more
threatening is the potential for huge,
unchecked wildfires in Kuwait's oil fields.
Other dangers include the release of
radioactive materials from nuclear reactors
after their destruction and the contamina
tion of water supplies by chemical facilities
after being bombed.
The extent of damage caused by the oil
spill has not yet been determined, but
prospects for the Gulf, one of the world's
most fragile ecosystems, aren't encourag
ing.
Last week, the Iraqis opened the valve on
an oil-loading pipeline at an offshore termi
nal of the A 1 Ahmedi refinery about ten
miles off the Kuwaiti coast. The resulting
spill, which was at least nine miles long, is
now said to be checked, but has been Esti
mated to entail up to several million barrels
of oil, which at 42 gallons per barrel, would
be more than 125 million gallons of oil.
This dwarfs the disasterous Exxon
Valdez spill of 1989, which fouled Alaska's
Prince William Sound with 10.9 million gal
lons of oil.
And although the Persian Gulf lacks the
pristine qualities of Alaska's coastal waters,
the impact of an oil spill on this region will
be much more severe.
The Gulf waters are shallow and rela
tively enclosed, and currents carry the oil
towards shore, where miles of vulnerable
beaches and coral reefs are being despoiled
and innumerable species of marine animals
(including endangered sea turtles and dol
phins) and shore birds, such as comorants,
are dying by the hundreds.
In addition, whereas the currents and
tidal flow in the Northern Atlantic com
pletely replace the water in Prince William
Sound every 28 days, it takes fully 200 years
for the water in the Gulf to be completely
replaced.
Thus it is not merely the tremendous vol
ume of crude released, but the length of
time it will take the oil to disperse from the
small Gulf area into the ocean which has
made this a spill of disasterous proportions.
Another major complication of an oilspill
under wartime conditions is the inability of
U.S. forces or environmental groups to mit
igate the effects of the spill.
The only strategies for eliminating oil
are to burn it, which isn't feasable
due to the nature of the spill,

or to have a dispersant plane flown over the
water to release chemical dispersants which
break up the oil.
But flying such a plane over the wartorn
Gulf waters would be an impossibility.
The region's ecosystem will be severely
altered by the oil, which has formed a film
one millimeter thick over miles of Gulf
waters. The surface plankton being killed
by the oil is one of the primary sources of
energy at the bottom of the food chain.
And the fouling of the Gulf has an even
more direct effect on people in the region,
because contaminated water could force
coastal desalination plants to close. These
facilities, which remove salt from the sea
water, provide Saudi Arabia's population, as
well as the 700,000 allied troops stationed in
the region, with 90 percent of their drinking
water.
And the value of water in this parched
region, is not to be underestimated. In fact,
another concern of environmentalists is
that Saudi Arabia's already overused
aquifers, which were expected, even before
the war, to run dry in 20 years, will be emp
tied sooner, due to the arrival of hundreds of
thousands of troops which draw on them.
And even if water was plentiful in the
region, supplies could not be sufficient to
extinguish the fires that would ravage
Kuwait should its oilfields be set aflame.
Military experts believe that the Iraqis
have mined Kuwait's 360 active oilwells
with explosives, and that if they aren't set
off by allied bombing, Iraqi leaders may set
them aflame themselves.
Such fires as would result could burn
three million barrels of oil per day, creating
smog that some believe capable of inducing
what has been termed a "petroleum winter."
This effect has been described by Cornell
Professor Carl Sagan to the Los Angeles
Times as "nothing so severe as a nuclear
winter but still something extremely dan
gerous on a regional scale and possibly on a
global scale."

Sagan developed the concept of a "nucle
ar winter" — caused by airborne debris
from a nuclear explosion — several decades
ago. This concept involves debris reaching
the stratosphere and blocking sunlight,
thereby causing a drastic drop in surface
temperature.
The idea of a petroleum winter rests
on the idea that a huge cloud of
smoke would be emitted from
such oilfield fires and the par
ticles could reach the
stratosphere, blocking
sunlight and reduc
ing surface tem
peratures
earth.
This effect
has been

likened to the eruption of the Tamboro vol
cano in Indonesia in 1915.

This eruption spewed particles
into the air, creating a cloud
cover that spread worldwide,

blocking sunlight and caus
ing global temperatures to
drop two degrees Fahren
heit, triggering unseason- ,
able frosts and ruining
crops as far as America
and Europe.

Predictions of similar ,
temperature drops and
crop failures have been
made about the current
situation, especially if fires
persist into the spring. How
ever, most scientists believe
the effects will be far less
widespread.

Civil Engineering Asst. Prof. I
Lynn Hildeman said it is unlikely
that a petroleum winter will occur,
because the volume of particles emitted
by the fire simply wouldn't be great
enough to cause such an effect on any

large scale.
The particles will be dispersed by
winds once they are in the air, and
when spread out over the globe,
would comprise only a fraction
of the particles already being
emitted by industries, Hilde-

Mann said.
While
the fires
are burn
ing, how
ever, local
effects
will be
felt due
to the
con
stant
cloud
of r—rzi

soot, Hildemann said.
Many scientists have predicted
that the obscuration of sunlight down
wind of Kuwait might significantly
reduce the surface temperature locally,
which could reduce rainfall over parts
of Southeast Asia during the summer
monsoon.
Interfering with the monsoon
would adversely affect agriculture, pos
sibly destroying the crops upon which
billions of people depend for food.
Estimates of temperature decreas
es as severe as 20 degrees have been
postulated for the Middle Easern
region, although most predictions are
far less extreme.
Approximately 540,000 tons of
soot would be injected into the atmo
sphere during the first month if all
wells and refineries were set afire in
Kuwait.
In addition to its effects on climate
and agriculture, this soot would be
falling within two weeks on countries
downwind from the blaze. People
would then be breathing the fouled air
and eating livestock which has con
sumed soot-covered grassland.
Such fires would also emit tons of
greenhouse gases, such as carbon diox
ide, into the atmosphere, contributing
to global warming. And sulfur and
nitrous oxides would also be released
into the air, only to return to earth as
deadly, potent acid rain, damaging
both agriculture and marine life.
In the worst-case scenario, soot and
nitrogen oxides could, if they are car
ried high enough into the strat
osphere, destroy
it. _

Last week's oil spill, which has already
dumped millions of gallons of crude into the
Persian Gulf, is only one of many environ
mental disasters which could occur during
the war in the Middle East.
These dangers have been overshadowed
in the media by day-to-day military strategy,
yet they have the potential to increase — by
exponential proportions — the costs of war,
in terms of human life, lost resources and
monetary expenditure.
While the oil spill is the most urgent
problem at present, perhaps even more
threatening is the potential for huge,
unchecked wildfires in Kuwait's oil fields.
Other dangers include the release of
radioactive materials from nuclear reactors
after their destruction and the contamina
tion of water supplies by chemical facilities
after being bombed.
The extent of damage caused by the oil
spill has not yet been determined, but
prospects for the Gulf, one of the world's
most fragile ecosystems, aren't encourag
ing.
Last week, the Iraqis opened the valve on
an oil-loading pipeline at an offshore termi
nal of the A 1 Ahmedi refinery about ten
miles off the Kuwaiti coast. The resulting
spill, which was at least nine miles long, is
now said to be checked, but has been Esti
mated to entail up to several million barrels
of oil, which at 42 gallons per barrel, would
be more than 125 million gallons of oil.
This dwarfs the disasterous Exxon
Valdez spill of 1989, which fouled Alaska's
Prince William Sound with 10.9 million gal
lons of oil.
And although the Persian Gulf lacks the
pristine qualities of Alaska's coastal waters,
the impact of an oil spill on this region will
be much more severe.
The Gulf waters are shallow and rela
tively enclosed, and currents carry the oil
towards shore, where miles of vulnerable
beaches and coral reefs are being despoiled
and innumerable species of marine animals
(including endangered sea turtles and dol
phins) and shore birds, such as comorants,
are dying by the hundreds.
In addition, whereas the currents and
tidal flow in the Northern Atlantic com
pletely replace the water in Prince William
Sound every 28 days, it takes fully 200 years
for the water in the Gulf to be completely
replaced.
Thus it is not merely the tremendous vol
ume of crude released, but the length of
time it will take the oil to disperse from the
small Gulf area into the ocean which has
made this a spill of disasterous proportions.
Another major complication of an oilspill
under wartime conditions is the inability of
U.S. forces or environmental groups to mit
igate the effects of the spill.
The only strategies for eliminating oil
are to burn it, which isn't feasable
due to the nature of the spill,

or to have a dispersant plane flown over the
water to release chemical dispersants which
break up the oil.
But flying such a plane over the wartorn
Gulf waters would be an impossibility.
The region's ecosystem will be severely
altered by the oil, which has formed a film
one millimeter thick over miles of Gulf
waters. The surface plankton being killed
by the oil is one of the primary sources of
energy at the bottom of the food chain.
And the fouling of the Gulf has an even
more direct effect on people in the region,
because contaminated water could force
coastal desalination plants to close. These
facilities, which remove salt from the sea
water, provide Saudi Arabia's population, as
well as the 700,000 allied troops stationed in
the region, with 90 percent of their drinking
water.
And the value of water in this parched
region, is not to be underestimated. In fact,
another concern of environmentalists is
that Saudi Arabia's already overused
aquifers, which were expected, even before
the war, to run dry in 20 years, will be emp
tied sooner, due to the arrival of hundreds of
thousands of troops which draw on them.
And even if water was plentiful in the
region, supplies could not be sufficient to
extinguish the fires that would ravage
Kuwait should its oilfields be set aflame.
Military experts believe that the Iraqis
have mined Kuwait's 360 active oilwells
with explosives, and that if they aren't set
off by allied bombing, Iraqi leaders may set
them aflame themselves.
Such fires as would result could burn
three million barrels of oil per day, creating
smog that some believe capable of inducing
what has been termed a "petroleum winter."
This effect has been described by Cornell
Professor Carl Sagan to the Los Angeles
Times as "nothing so severe as a nuclear
winter but still something extremely dan
gerous on a regional scale and possibly on a
global scale."

Sagan developed the concept of a "nucle
ar winter" — caused by airborne debris
from a nuclear explosion — several decades
ago. This concept involves debris reaching
the stratosphere and blocking sunlight,
thereby causing a drastic drop in surface
temperature.
The idea of a petroleum winter rests
on the idea that a huge cloud of
smoke would be emitted from
such oilfield fires and the par
ticles could reach the
stratosphere, blocking
sunlight and reduc
ing surface tem
peratures
earth.
This effect
has been

likened to the eruption of the Tamboro vol
cano in Indonesia in 1915.

This eruption spewed particles
into the air, creating a cloud
cover that spread worldwide,

blocking sunlight and caus
ing global temperatures to
drop two degrees Fahren
heit, triggering unseason- ,
able frosts and ruining
crops as far as America
and Europe.

Predictions of similar ,
temperature drops and
crop failures have been
made about the current
situation, especially if fires
persist into the spring. How
ever, most scientists believe
the effects will be far less
widespread.

Civil Engineering Asst. Prof. I
Lynn Hildeman said it is unlikely
that a petroleum winter will occur,
because the volume of particles emitted
by the fire simply wouldn't be great
enough to cause such an effect on any

large scale.
The particles will be dispersed by
winds once they are in the air, and
when spread out over the globe,
would comprise only a fraction
of the particles already being
emitted by industries, Hilde-

Mann said.
While
the fires
are burn
ing, how
ever, local
effects
will be
felt due
to the
con
stant
cloud
of r—rzi

soot, Hildemann said.
Many scientists have predicted
that the obscuration of sunlight down
wind of Kuwait might significantly
reduce the surface temperature locally,
which could reduce rainfall over parts
of Southeast Asia during the summer
monsoon.
Interfering with the monsoon
would adversely affect agriculture, pos
sibly destroying the crops upon which
billions of people depend for food.
Estimates of temperature decreas
es as severe as 20 degrees have been
postulated for the Middle Easern
region, although most predictions are
far less extreme.
Approximately 540,000 tons of
soot would be injected into the atmo
sphere during the first month if all
wells and refineries were set afire in
Kuwait.
In addition to its effects on climate
and agriculture, this soot would be
falling within two weeks on countries
downwind from the blaze. People
would then be breathing the fouled air
and eating livestock which has con
sumed soot-covered grassland.
Such fires would also emit tons of
greenhouse gases, such as carbon diox
ide, into the atmosphere, contributing
to global warming. And sulfur and
nitrous oxides would also be released
into the air, only to return to earth as
deadly, potent acid rain, damaging
both agriculture and marine life.
