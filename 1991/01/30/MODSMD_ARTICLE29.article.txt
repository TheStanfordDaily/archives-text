# Ounce of prevention: Patients need help avoiding disease
## 
### Julie Makinen Staff writer 
Each year, Americans spend trillions of
dollars on health care — over 60 percent
of which goes toward the treatment of
preventable diseases. Yet only 0.8 percent
of the national health care budget is
devoted to the practice of preventive
'nedicine.
These astonishing figures were cited
b> Dr. John Farquhar, director of Stan
ford's Center for Research in Disease Pre
vention, during a workshop at last week
end'* You Can Make a Difference confer
ence on Health and the Underserved.
"Many people, no matter how wealthy
they may be, are being underserved by
their physicians because they simply are
not receiving any information on preven
tion," according to Dr. Mark Renneker, of
UC-San Francisco's Department of Fam
ily and Community Medicine, who also
spoke.
The workshop, entitled "A Lifestyle
Approach to Patient Care," focused on
various aspects of preventive medicine,
including behavior modification, Asian
healing arts, self-awareness, education

and "healthy lifestyles."
According to Renneker, doctors are not
prepared to deal with "what kills most
people."
A study done through the Surgeon
General's office found that 50 percent of
all deaths in the United States are related
to behaviors such as stress, nutritional
disorders, smoking, drinking and neglect
ing to use seat belts.
Twenty percent of all deaths are
related to environmental, industrial or
occupational hazards, while 10 percent
are attributable to inadequate health
care.
Doctors have little efficacy in these
areas. Only the remaining 20 percent of
all deaths are what Renneker calls "bio
logical-medical problems," or diseases,
but "this is the only area that physicians
are trained to address," he said.
After surveying recent medical school
graduates about their preparation in pre
ventive medicine, Renneker deemed the
results "quite alarming." #
"Medical students today are not taught
how to help people quit smoking or
reduce stress. They do not know how to
prescribe exercise or nutrition. . . . They

are not expected to know these things,"
said Renneker.
Since smoking is the number one pre
ventable cause of death in the United
States, "we all have reason to be con
cerned," Renneker said.
Studies have shown that many Ameri
cans lead very unhealthy lives — at least
60 percent of the population gets little or
no exercise, and as Stanford students
know well, stress is widespread. Stress
is now recognized as the primary precur
sor to the onset of illness, and exercise is
seen as the single most effective way to
improve overall health.
Despite their importance, medical pro
fessionals are not being trained in these
subjects. Renneker and Farquhar are
attempting to remedy this "short circuit"
in American medicine in several ways.
Renneker is addressing the problem in
terms of medical education and physician
behavior. He has found that during the
average 12-minute office visit, only 1.5
minutes are devoted to education — that
is, explanation of illness, treatment, pre
vention, instructions on taking medicine,
etc. He also found that patients ask zero
or one question of their doctor per visit.

"Communication is essential to estab
lishing preventative medicine," said Ren
neker. "Physicians must communicate
with patients, and patients must be
responsible enough to ask questions of
their caregivers."

Stress is now recognized
as the primary precursor
to the onset of illness.

Farquhar has been examining what
can be done within communities to
increase the practice of prevention.
Farquhar believes that educating chil
dren early in life is one of the best
approaches to preventive medicine. In his
work, he has found that when healthy
lifestyle habits such as proper diet and
exercise are incorporated into fourth,
fifth and sixth-grade curricula, these stu
dents are likely to continue practicing
healthy habits long after they leave the
playgrounds.
Farquhar and his colleague, Dr. David

Alt man, have done a great deal of work to
reduce the incidence of smoking among
youths.
They found that not only do children
and teens need to be educated about the
effects of smoking, but also that the gov
ernment must step up enforcement and
monitoring of cigarette sales to minors.
"Cigarette vending machines continue to
be a major problem," said Farquhar.
This approach to reducing smoking
among youths can serve as a model on
which to base other measures designed to
increase the practice of preventive health
care. There must be action on the part of
the individual, especially through educa
tion and awareness, and there must be
community and government action to
improve the health of the population at
large.
"Patients, physicians, educators, com
munities and schools must vocalize and
actively express their concern and sup
port for healthy lifestyles,"said Farquhar.
"If America can be taught to prevent its
medical problems, the overall health and
well-being of the nation will be improved
in an effective, long-lasting and cost-effi
cient manner."
