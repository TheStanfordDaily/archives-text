# Students debate U.S. role in war
## Pros and cons of Persian Gulf war presented at Cubberley 
### David Toy 
A student debate on America's motives and
options in the Persian Gulf war drew a vocal anti
war audience to Cubberley Auditorium last night for
an hour and a half of speeches and questions.
More than 60 people gathered to hear the discus
sion between four anti-war and four pro-Bush speak
ers. The debate featured a five-minute speech by
each panelist, followed by a short rebuttal and a
counter-rebuttal from the original speaker. Audience
questions followed.
Junior Mohamad Ali, the first of the anti-war stu
dents to speak, criticized President Bush's commit
ment to the interests of U.S. citizens, stating, "For
George Bush, this war spells political stardom. For
America, this is political suicide."
Three other anti-war speakers proceeded to ques
tion Bush's peace efforts and the war's justification.
Graduate student Jerry Rosiek conceded his confu
sion about the war. "If we are confused, it means our
government has failed to present fair and convincing
arguments for this war," he said.
Mark Weber of Students for America, a conserva
tive student group, responded to Rosiek's complaint,
denouncing Saddam Hussein, who "has shown a
willingness to use every weapon he can get his hands
on." Weber's sentiment was echoed by most of the
pro-Bush panel.
Daryl JosefTer, editor in chief of The Stanford
Review, said he takes Saddam's threat seriously. "If

anyone is admitting that Saddam Hussein is the type
of ruler who would set 1,200 oil wells on fire, they
show he is a dictator who must be stopped," he said.
While JosefTer did admit that prewar negotiations
had been less than intense, he concluded that contin
ued war was now "the only real option."
Freshman Roberta Woolley added that "moderate
governments in the Middle East would collapse and
leave those nations open for Hussein," should the
United States pull out.
Another pro-Bush panelist, junior Noel Maurer,
said, "I firmly believe that more lives and livelihoods
would be cost by ignoring the threat of Saddam Hus
sein."
Junior Sherifa Edoga, in her remarks, looked at
race and the war, citing the 60 percent minority
makeup of U.S. armed forces. Here in the United
States, she said, "it is communities of color that are
directly targeted for military recruitment."
Weber looked back at previous wars, including the
American Revolution and the Civil War, as events in
American history mandating armed action. "Our
world is far from ideal, and sometimes war is the
only means of achieving peace," he said.
Senior Erin Clune returned to prewar negotia
tions and reminded the audience that "many peace
proposals were put forward by Arabs and Europeans
and rejected by the United States before Iraq could
respond."

Daryl Joseffer and Noel Maurer of The Stanford Review share a chuckle at last night's debate on the Per
sian Gulf war.
Although Joseffer and others
agreed, ultimately none of the
students could propose a legiti
mate alternative to war.
Audience questions rounded
out the discussion, as those
against the war flooded the pro
war debaters with queries. One
audience member opposed to the
war asked why those panelists
were not in the volunteer army
themselves.
"To support the war, I don't
think you have to necessarily sign
up for the armed forces," Weber
replied.
