Norman Bates might not be
the only thing to fear in the
shower, if you're a recent surgi
cal patient. Dr. Philip Lowry, 3.
postdoctoral fellow at Stanford
Hospital, has found that
legionella endocarditis, a rare
infection of the heart valves, is
transmitted via bath water in
the intensive care unit.
Although only seven cases of
legionella endocarditis have
occurred in the past five years
at the hospital, the disease
affects 50,000 to 200,000 U.S.
patients per year.
And although the condition
can be successfully treated
with antibiotics, 15 percent of
the patients infected will die.
The bacterium that causes
legionella endocarditis is also
responsible for the more com
monly known Legionnaires'
disease.
This bacterium was identi
fied by Stanford's School of
Medicine and the Center for
Disease Control in Atlanta as
the cause for legionella endo
carditis several years ago, but

no one understood its method
of transmission.
Then, in 1989, three heart
surgery patients at Stanford
Hospital became infected by
the legionella bacteria.
Lowry's research team,
investigating the legionella
infections, has since discovered
thai the intensive care unit's
bath water transmitted the
bacterid a discovery with far
reaching implications for hos
pitals nationwide.
. By routine bathing of car
diac surgery patients with tap
water, the legionella bacteria
present in the hospital water
supply infected the three
patients.
Although the legionella bac
teria live in fresh water, they
pose no risk to the public, the
majority of hospitalized
patients or the medical person
nel. The researchers stressed
that the bacteria most com
monly infect individuals with
suppressed immune systems,
extensive tissue trauma and
the presence of foreign bodies
such as sutures and chest
tubes.
