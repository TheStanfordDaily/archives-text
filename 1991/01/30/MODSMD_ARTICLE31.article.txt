\y •watched the movie "The
Lost Boys" the other night, and
got into a rather heated discus
sion about vampire bats. Enquir
ing minds want to know.
A .Probably no species of bat
• has aroused a stronger fear
response in humans than has the
blood-eating (sanguivorous) vam
pire.
Vampire bats belong to the
mammalian order Chiroptera
(which means hand-wing). They
are thought to have evolved from
insectivorous bats which switched
their feeding preference from the
ectoparasites of large mammals to
the large mammals themselves.
Desmodus rotundus, the most
common of the three species of
vampire bats, ranges from south
ern Texas through Argentina and
Chile.
Unlike most bats, vampires are
fully capable of walking, running
and hopping, and will normally
approach their prey in this man
ner, as opposed to landing directly
on them.
Vampires are most active dur
ing the darkest periods of the
night, and during the new moon

period of the lunar cycle, probably
so they don't have to compete
with werewolves for food.
They are serious agricultural
and public health pests. In fact,
vampire-born rabies is by some
estimates the primary livestock
disease problem in Latin America.
Vampires normally weigh 30 to
35 grams (a little more than an
ounce, which is 28.4 grams) and
have a wingspan of about 30 cen
timeters (about a foot, for the

metric illiterate). Vampires do not
— we repeat, do not — suck blood
from their victim; rather, they
have a lovely specially modified
tongue that transports blood by

capillary action as the bat laps
blood from a covertly inflicted V
shaped wound. Several studies
have have demonstrated the pres
ence of anticoagulant activity in
vampire saliva.
Vampires have razor-sharp
incisors with which they remove a
small piece of flesh from their vic
tims. Their prime feeding location
are body regions rich in blood cap
illaries, typically the tips of fin

gers and toes (on humans), lips,
eyelids, and the tips of the nose
and ears on livestock.
Vampires do not — we repeat,
do not — drain their victims of
blood during feeding, (this is the
trademark of lawyers) but an
attack by many bats on a small
mammal (including human
babies) can result in death due to
continued bleeding of unclotted
wounds.
Vampires may consume up to
their body weight in blood in a sin
gle feeding. The stomach and
intestine are capable of extreme
distension, so that the bat appears
spherical and bloated after feed
ing (hence the specific epithet
rotundus). The heavy food load
often makes flight impossible.
Fortunately, the kidneys of
vampires are well adapted to such
a lifestyle. They have evolved to
allow the rapid excretion of the
large quantities of water found in
a blood meal. Thus, soon after
feeding, vampires begin to urinate
continuously until they are light
enough to fly.
Since blood is such an unbal
anced food source, vampires need
to feed nearly every night, and in
fact will be so weak after two
nights of not eating that they no
longer have the strength to seek
out prey.
But fret not.
