## Linksters finish ninth in Tucson 
### George Malone Staff writer 
The Stanford men's golf
team did not expect to be blown
away when they went south to
Tucson, Ariz. However, on the
last day of the Arizona/ PING
Intercollegiate tournament,
gale-force winds and bitterly
cold temperatures did just
that, forcing the Cardinal
squad to a disappointing score
of 310 to tie them for ninth
place overall in the tourna
ment.

Men's Golf
The weather wreaked havoc
with the entire tournament
schedule, forcing everyone to
suspend second round play
Monday night because of dark
ness and start late yesterday
due to frost on the greens.
Men's coach Wally Goodwin
said, "There was an absolute
hurricane. Even in my years as
the coach at Northwestern I
have never seen such a cold day
for college golf. It was real
tough to play."
Although Stanford slipped
from their impressive fourth
place showing in the first
round to a tie for ninth with
UTEP and Arkansas, there
were still some bright spots for
the Cardinal. Even with the
inclement weather, freshman
Notah Begay shot an impres
sive one over par 73, and had
junior Christian Cevaer not
bogeyed the last four holes, he
would have been two over for
the day.
Goodwin said, "Notah's
round was admirable, consider
ing those conditions. His score
had to be among the top rounds
of the day. Christian had a good
round until the end when he

slipped a little, but with this
weather it's understandable. I
was pleased with all the guys."
The team began the day
with four holes left in their sec
ond round, which had been
suspended last night. They fin
ished the second round with a
304, but Goodwin had expected
them to slip from their opening
score of 287.
He said, "We didn't play as
well in the second round on
Monday night, but it had been
a long day and no team
improved. As the sun was set
ting over the mountains, it
began to get really cold and
affect everyone's play."
Yesterday morning the
weather refused to cooperate at
all. Temperatures were unsea
sonably cold and the winds
were gusting up to 25 miles per
hour. The team finished its sec
ond round early and went into
the clubhouse while the pins
were changed on the course.
Unfortunately the weather
never improved and the team
was hampered all through the
final round.
Begay led the team with a
final three-round score of 221,
followed by sophomore Mike
Milliken's 226. Freshman
Casey Martin and sophomore
Dave Rutkowski shot 229.
However, Stanford's ninth
place showing can only help the
Cardinal's ranking in the
NCAA polls.
"We entered the tourna
ment ranked 31st in the nation
and sixth in our conference,
and I think we helped our
national ranking with our per
formance," Goodwin said.
The team will take off the
rest of the week to catch up on
studying, including a trip to see
the AT&T Tournament at Peb
ble Beach this weekend, and
then resume practice next
Monday in preparation for the
John Burns Intercollegiate
tournament in Hawaii in two
weeks.
