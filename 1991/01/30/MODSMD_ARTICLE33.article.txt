# Card nine hopes to cook up a win
## 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
Baseball coaching is a little like
cooking, and Stanford's Mark
Marquess — the chief chef at
Sunken Diamond — is still mixing
the ingredients.
What Marquess hopes to con
coct is a scrumptious College
World Series team, but he's not
sure yet if he has this year's epic
urean masterpiece combined in
quite the right proportions. The
head coach will sprinkle new zest
into the lineup today when Stan
ford feasts on San Francisco State
in a 2 p.m. non-conference game
at Sunken Diamond.
Marquess said he will try some
new lineup twists against the
slow-starting Gators, who Mon
day lost their season opener 14-0
to California. Meanwhile, the top
ranked Cardinal opened the sea
son by sweeping Santa Clara in
two games.
Freshman right-hander Willie
Adams will start on the mound
today and freshman Matt Boke
meier will get the starting nod at
second base, Marquess said yes
terday. Catcher-third baseman
Mark Skeels may move behind the
plate to spell Troy Tallman, and
outfielder-pitcher-quarterback
John Lynch will play as well, Mar
quess said.
"You have to find some things
out at this point in the season,"
said Marquess. "If I play Boke
meier Wednesday, then I'll play
(Chris) Kemper on Friday."
"The practices are difficult at
this point," continued Marquess,
who is preparing his team for the
Feb. 22 start of league play. "We
need a lot of repetition and work
on team concepts. That's why we
play a lot of games early. And we
can get some new people into the
lineup."
Stanford's meat and potato
players, like NCAA Freshman of
the Year Jeffrey Hammonds, slug
ging first baseman David
McCarty, and opening-day winner
John Reid, will certainly be in the
menu when Stanford opens
Pacific 10 Conference play against
Arizona State, but Marquess still
has some culinary coaching deci
sions to make about the rest of the

lineup.
Today's game against the less
talented Gators will give Mar
quess a chance to mix the lineup,
but he stresses Stanford won't
come out half-baked.
"They got clobbered by Cal, but
they are better than that," said
Marquess, whose top-ranked team
had to go to extra innings to beat
San Francisco 10-6 last year. The
Gators finished the season a sur
prising 30-21.
Adams, a 6-foot-7 intimidator
from La Mirada, Calif., will make
his first collegiate appearance
today, and will likely be followed
by Aaron Dorlarque, Andrew Lor
raine, Greg Mix, Tim Moore or
Scott Weiss.
"He has a good fastball,
change-up and curve, and he's
throwing a split-finger now too,"
said Marquess about Adams. "For
a freshman, he has a very good
repertoire of pitches and he is very
poised."
Bokemeier, who will be a back
up at shortstop and third base if

he doesn't win the second base
job, will also be making his first
collegiate start. Senior Chris
Kemper, who has been walked
three times in seven trips to the
plate, has the edge in the battle
for Troy Paulsen's old spot, but
Marquess will give Bokemeier a
starting shot today against the
Gators.
Skeels, a switch-hitter and ver
satile fielder, is challenging junior
David Holbrook at third base, but
may end up as a designated hitter.
Holbrook made two throwing
errors against Santa Clara Sun
day and is still recovering from
ankle and hamstring injuries.
Lynch, who already has Bo
Jackson-like aspirations as a
quarterback on the football team,
will most likely be a back-up out
fielder, designated hitter and
pitcher.
The rest of the lineup — Ryan
Turner in left, Hammonds in cen
ter, Steve Solomon in right, Roger
Burnett at shortstop, McCarty at

first base and Tallman behind the
plate — is ready to shake-and
bake its way back to the College
World Series.
Card notes
Right-handed pitcher Brian
Sackinsky's sore elbow was exam
ined again Monday and no major
injury was found.
