# Stanford's revenue sports have schizoid personalities
## 
### 
Dear Cardinal: You could hear the
moans across the Bay. Sighs rever
berated throughout the Quad, not
to mention Maples.
Arizona State 58, Stanford 47.
Arizona State? Aren't you supposed to
have no problem handling the Sun Devils
on the hardwood? Especially at home?
Sunday's loss, however, simply contin
ued this year's, no, the past few seasons'
trend.
How is it continually possible?
Why is it when your fans least expect
victory you pull out the great ones, but
when you are all but certain to win, disap
pointment is the result?
You too, Cardinal football.
Why do the two of you always amaze
your poor supporters, both with spectacu
lar upsets and with horrible losses? How
can both the men's hoops and the grid
iron squads persistently rise to the play
ing level of some of the best, yet sink
below that of the dredges of the Pac-10,
and even the country?
You are leaving Cardinal fans over
whelmed and confused, game after game,
season after season.

We just can't understand.
This season has been a case in point for
both of you. The entire football season fit
this scenario perfectly. First, you
unranked and unheralded football play
ers start things off by opening at top
ranked Colorado — where the entire
country expected to see you chewed up
and spit out by the mighty Buffs — and
lead the entire contest, almost pulling off
one of the biggest upsets in school history
before falling 21-17 with 12 seconds
remaining.
Then, you turn around and play a
mediocre Bruin squad, who you allow to
take the game 32-31 in the final seconds.
The rest of the year was only more of

the same. After giving fans the feeling
that you were just too young and undevel
oped to do anything, you proved you
actually belonged with some of the best
by pulling off maybe the greatest upset in
Stanford history, defeating No. 1-ranked
Notre Dame 36-31 at South Bend. How
our hopes were up. This was finally it. We
were going to a bowl game!
Crash.
You quickly wiped away the feeling of
elation. Consecutive losses to USC, Wash
ington and Oregon. Okay, USC went to its
upmteenth-straight bowl game, and
Washington was incredibly overpowering
and should have been national champion.
But not scoring a point against Oregon?
Losing 31-0? Back to ground zero.
But when all possibiliy of a winning
season was gone you turned right around
and continued the upsets. Creamed bowl
bound Arizona 23-10 in Tucson. Upset
the bowl-bound Weenies 27-25 in one of
the greatest Big Games ever played.
Why?
Why aren't you 'normal' revenue-pro
ducing squads who win the gimmes, drop
the impossibles, and pull a few upsets

here or there?
And you basketball team, you're even
worse. This season is still in full swing
and it's already been a roller coaster ride.
First you stretch top-ranked North Car
olina to its limits in a holiday classic.
"Wow, we're on our way to the NCAA
tourney," smile Cardinal boosters.
But . . . the next two supposed cruise
to-victory games, against the rebuilding
Oregon tandem, become try-to-explain
upset defeats. "I never thought I'd return
from vacation and have our season be
over already," lamented one frustrated
fan.
But that's just not your style, is it? You
had to tempt us a few more times. Had to
show us that you really do have the
potential for post-season play, only it sur
faces solely for the biggies.
So you bop on down to the City of
Angels, where you've defeated the mighty
Bruins exactly once in Pauley Pavilion,
and proceed to embarrass seventh-ranked
UCLA, and on national TV at that. Stan
ford 89, UCLA 82. No problem. "Here we
go!" the campus thinks.

Not. Three days later, in the echoing
Sports Arena, you're embarrassed by
lowly USC 85-67. As in picked-to-finish
last-in-the-conference USC. Great.
But that wasn't enough. Arizona
comes to town. You know, the team from
the desert that always goes to the Sweet
Sixteen but who somehow you always
manage to play tough at home. And what
happens? You lead with two minutes to
go, 76-72 before losing on a freak last-sec
ond play. The almost-third upset of the
Wildcats in four years. And then you turn
around and. score a grand total of 14
points in the first half against Arizona
State.
It just doesn't make sense.
Neither does the fact that both of you
were talented enough for post-season
invitations, but it appears we're heading
for oh-for-two.
Why is it that Cardinal teams can't live
up — or down — to their reputations?
Just wondering.

iron squads persistently rise to the play
ing level of some of the best, yet sink
below that of the dredges of the Pac-10,
and even the country?
You are leaving Cardinal fans over
whelmed and confused, game after game,
season after season.

We just can't understand.
This season has been a case in point for
both of you. The entire football season fit
this scenario perfectly. First, you
unranked and unheralded football play
ers start things off by opening at top
ranked Colorado — where the entire
country expected to see you chewed up
and spit out by the mighty Buffs — and
lead the entire contest, almost pulling off
one of the biggest upsets in school history
before falling 21-17 with 12 seconds
remaining.
Then, you turn around and play a
mediocre Bruin squad, who you allow to
take the game 32-31 in the final seconds.
The rest of the year was only more of

the same. After giving fans the feeling
that you were just too young and undevel
oped to do anything, you proved you
actually belonged with some of the best
by pulling off maybe the greatest upset in
Stanford history, defeating No. 1-ranked
Notre Dame 36-31 at South Bend. How
our hopes were up. This was finally it. We
were going to a bowl game!
Crash.
You quickly wiped away the feeling of
elation. Consecutive losses to USC, Wash
ington and Oregon. Okay, USC went to its
upmteenth-straight bowl game, and
Washington was incredibly overpowering
and should have been national champion.
But not scoring a point against Oregon?
Losing 31-0? Back to ground zero.
But when all possibiliy of a winning
season was gone you turned right around
and continued the upsets. Creamed bowl
bound Arizona 23-10 in Tucson. Upset
the bowl-bound Weenies 27-25 in one of
the greatest Big Games ever played.
Why?
Why aren't you 'normal' revenue-pro
ducing squads who win the gimmes, drop
the impossibles, and pull a few upsets

here or there?
And you basketball team, you're even
worse. This season is still in full swing
and it's already been a roller coaster ride.
First you stretch top-ranked North Car
olina to its limits in a holiday classic.
"Wow, we're on our way to the NCAA
tourney," smile Cardinal boosters.
But . . . the next two supposed cruise
to-victory games, against the rebuilding
Oregon tandem, become try-to-explain
upset defeats. "I never thought I'd return
from vacation and have our season be
over already," lamented one frustrated
fan.
But that's just not your style, is it? You
had to tempt us a few more times. Had to
show us that you really do have the
potential for post-season play, only it sur
faces solely for the biggies.
So you bop on down to the City of
Angels, where you've defeated the mighty
Bruins exactly once in Pauley Pavilion,
and proceed to embarrass seventh-ranked
UCLA, and on national TV at that. Stan
ford 89, UCLA 82. No problem. "Here we
go!" the campus thinks.

Not. Three days later, in the echoing
Sports Arena, you're embarrassed by
lowly USC 85-67. As in picked-to-finish
last-in-the-conference USC. Great.
But that wasn't enough. Arizona
comes to town. You know, the team from
the desert that always goes to the Sweet
Sixteen but who somehow you always
manage to play tough at home. And what
happens? You lead with two minutes to
go, 76-72 before losing on a freak last-sec
ond play. The almost-third upset of the
Wildcats in four years. And then you turn
around and. score a grand total of 14
points in the first half against Arizona
State.
It just doesn't make sense.
Neither does the fact that both of you
were talented enough for post-season
invitations, but it appears we're heading
for oh-for-two.
Why is it that Cardinal teams can't live
up — or down — to their reputations?
Just wondering.
