# Tennis looks to tame Tigers
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
The early part of the season
rarely provides too many sur
prises for the Stanford women's
tennis team. The UCLAs and
Floridas of the world don't clash
with the Cardinal until later in
the year. Instead, traditional
rivals like University of the Pacific
give Stanford a chance to tune up
and prepare for the long road to
another NCAA title.
Just to make sure nothing
unexpected happens, Coach
Frank Brennan will play six of his
top seven today against the
Tigers. Only junior Debbie Gra
ham, the defending NCAA cham
pion, will sit out.
Since a Cardinal contingent at
full strength is not likely to be
threatened, there is precious little
to say about what will take place
at the Stanford Tennis Stadium
this afternoon. In college tennis,
there is no "on any given Sunday .
.." rule.
Get the picture yet?
If not, a once over of the
Volvo/Intercollegiate Tennis
Coaches Association rankings
should fill in any details. Stanford
can boast of senior Sandra Birch
at No. 1, Graham at No. 2, senior
Ten Whitlinger at No. 7, sopho

more Heather Willens at No. 15
and freshman Laxmi Poruri at
No. 48.
All three of the Cardinal's dou
bles team are ranked as well:
Birch-Graham at No.l, Poruri-
Whitlinger at No. 4 and Willens-
Emma Woodhouse at No. 20.
UOP has no one ranked in
either singles or doubles.
Stanford completed its chal
lenge matches yesterday and
Brennan will announce the season
lineup today after conferring with
his players.
Card notes
The Cardinal's season mark stands
at 2-0 even though Friday's match
with Utah was technically the season
opener. When Stanford's football team
visited Notre Dame in South Bend, 111.
— and shocked them — last fall, the
Cardinal women played the Irish
women in tennis.
Apparently, the Intercollegiate
Tennis Coaches Association has
decided the match should count
towards official records. Therefore,
Stanford has won 67 straight
matches.
Theoretically, the NCAA could
state, at a later date, that the results
don't count but it seems unlikely
they'll do that.

Stanford plays host to this year's
national championships in May. There
are all sorts of ticket options for stu
dents and non-students depending on
whether one is interested in the team
and/or individual events. Check with
the Athletic Department for more
information.
Though the NCAA announced
across-the-board scholarship cuts of
10 percent at the recent convention,
women's tennis is one of three sports
that will not be affected. The reason
has something to due with Title IX
and equal funding for men's and
women's athletics. Women's tennis
will retain all eight scholarships it can
currently offer.
