# Agency opens criminal investigation
## Fourth probe of indirect costs begins 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
A fourth federal agency has begun
scrutinizing the University's indirect
cost policies, this time to determine
whether Stanford and government
officials engaged in any criminal
wrongdoing during the last decade.
The Naval Investigative Service is
examining the relationship between
Stanford and the Office of Naval
Research, the federal agency responsi
ble for overseeing Stanford's research

practices. If the investigators find evi
dence of impropriety, the case will be
handed to the U.S. Attorney's office for
criminal prosecution.
This latest inquiry was apparently
prompted by allegations made by Paul
Biddle, the campus representative of
the Office of Naval Research, in a 27-
page letter sent to the inspector gen
eral of that office last fall. The Naval
Investigative Service operates inde-

pendently from the Office of Naval
Research, which is conducting its own
investigation of its relationship with
Stanford.
In his letter, Biddle claims there is
"the likelihood of criminal conspiracy,
criminal acts, civil violations and
ethics infractions" that resulted from
a "cozy" relationship between Stan
ford and the Office of Naval Research
prior to his arrival in October 1988.

Larry Horton, associate vice presi
dent for Public Affairs, said yesterday
that the University was not aware of
any evidence of impropriety on Stan
ford's part. But given the nature of the
allegations made by Biddle, he said, it
seems reasonable that "someone look
into it."
Horton stressed that Biddle's alle
gations are not the same thing as evi
dence of wrongdoing. In the past, Uni
versity administrators have character-
ized Biddle as an individual mote
adept at making sensational alle
gations than at providing sub
stantiation for his claims.
Horton said the University has
requested a copy of Biddle's letter
from the Office of Naval
Research, but has not yet received
a response.
In his letter, Biddle cautions
that he is a "non-lawyer" and
notes that "in certain instances, it
is conceivable my concerns could
be without merit."
He goes on to detail numerous
actions during the past decade
which he believes violated the
Federal Acquisition Regulations,
the rules that govern how federal
agencies grant money to contrac
tors.
During the last decade, Stan
ford has received $1.7 billion in
federal research grants, including

$554 million in
indirect cost re
covery. Indirect
costs are those
costs of doing
research that are
not easily attrib
utable to a spe
cific project and
include expenses
such as electric-

ity, maintenance and administra
tive overhead.
Biddle has alleged that Stan
ford may have overcharged the
government by as much as $175
million for indirect costs.
Most of the criticism in Bid
die's 27-page letter is directed at
the Office of Naval Research for
its lax oversight of Stanford's
practices. According to Biddle,
representatives of the naval office
"made and recommended
expenditures of funds known or
believed to be in violation of U.S.
law."
Public affairs officials from the
naval office have refused to com
ment on any of Biddle's allega
tions, pending the findings of that

office's inspector general. A
report, which has been delayed
for months, is expected to be
made public by the end of the
week.
Biddle contends that his prede
cessors conspired with Stanford
to allow the University to get by
without tough audits of their cost
claims.
The Office of Naval Research,
"instead of assuring that (Stan
ford's) disclosure statements
were adequate and that costs
were in compliance with (federal
rules), thwarted the conduct of
such review by withholding infor
mation that would have been
meaningful to (federal auditors)
in the conduct of (their) review,"
Biddle writes.
In addition to the criminal
probe by the Naval Investigative
Service, Stanford's practices are
being examined by the House
Subcommittee on Oversight and
Investigations, the General
Accounting Office and the inspec
tor general of the Office of Naval
Research.
