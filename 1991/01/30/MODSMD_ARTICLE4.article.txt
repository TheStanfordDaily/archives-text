# Agency opens criminal investigation
## Fourth probe of indirect costs begins 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
A fourth federal agency has begun
scrutinizing the University's indirect
cost policies, this time to determine
whether Stanford and government
officials engaged in any criminal
wrongdoing during the last decade.
The Naval Investigative Service is
examining the relationship between
Stanford and the Office of Naval
Research, the federal agency responsi
ble for overseeing Stanford's research

practices. If the investigators find evi
dence of impropriety, the case will be
handed to the U.S. Attorney's office for
criminal prosecution.
This latest inquiry was apparently
prompted by allegations made by Paul
Biddle, the campus representative of
the Office of Naval Research, in a 27-
page letter sent to the inspector gen
eral of that office last fall. The Naval
Investigative Service operates inde-

pendently from the Office of Naval
Research, which is conducting its own
investigation of its relationship with
Stanford.
In his letter, Biddle claims there is
"the likelihood of criminal conspiracy,
criminal acts, civil violations and
ethics infractions" that resulted from
a "cozy" relationship between Stan
ford and the Office of Naval Research
prior to his arrival in October 1988.

Larry Horton, associate vice presi
dent for Public Affairs, said yesterday
that the University was not aware of
any evidence of impropriety on Stan
ford's part. But given the nature of the
allegations made by Biddle, he said, it
seems reasonable that "someone look
into it."
Horton stressed that Biddle's alle
gations are not the same thing as evi
dence of wrongdoing. In the past, Uni
versity administrators have character-
