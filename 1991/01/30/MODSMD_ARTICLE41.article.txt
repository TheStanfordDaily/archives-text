## 
### Kathy Ardalan Staff writer 
The president of the Stanford
Islamic Society gave his religious
perspective on the Gulf crisis yes
terday at noon in the Bechtel
International Center.
Graduate student Abdullahi
Bature began the program with a
prayer. He continued by stressing
that Islam is being misrepre
sented by the acts of Iraqi Presi
dent Saddam Hussein.
"Just as Muslims cannot say
Christianity is a bad religion
because of the wrongful acts of
Jim Baker Christians should not
say Islam is bad because of Sad
dam Hussein," he said.
He added Hussein is not lead
ing a holy war because he is fight
ing for his own interests and not
for the sake of Allah.
Bature also said the Koran for
bids Saddam from making war
against another Muslim nation
except in self-defense. Therefore,
because Saddam invaded Kuwait
without due provocation, he is not
acting under Islamic law, he said.
But Bature did not limit his
criticism to Iraq, saying Saudi
Arabia is violating the tenets of
the Koran by waging war with
Iraq without exhausting the pos-

sibilities for negotiation.
Bature called upon those fight
ing to "represent religion both in
theory and practice."
He also addressed a question
regarding the distribution of a
poster displayed Jan. 15 in Roble
Hall and the Medical Center
which read: "All moslirns must die
in the desert." He said this type of
anti-Muslim sentiment has
caused many Muslims at Stanford
to question their security, even
influencing one graduate student
and his wife to move back to Saudi
Arabia.
University President Donald
Kennedy condemned the content
of the flier at last week's Faculty
Senate meeting. The University,
however, does not consider the
flier a violation of the Fundamen
tal Standard because it was not
directed against an individual.
Bature said he is upset by that
response and that the University
should "at least ... find out who
did it."
He said he feels the the anti-
Muslim sentiment is a result of
"ignorance of our religion."
After he spoke, several stu
dents raised questions about
issues ranging from the role of
women in Islam to Bature's right
to speak for the entire Muslim
community.
