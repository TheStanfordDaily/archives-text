# Berlin students take new war precautions

BERLIN â€” Germany may be
several thousand miles closer to
Iraq than the United States is, but
the threat of terrorism due to the
Persian Gulf War has done little to
scare the 37 students at the Stan
ford Program in Berlin this quar
ter.
Nonetheless, most students
said they are taking extra safety
precautions.
Although local police have
received 15 or 16 threats of terror
ism around the city since the war
started, none of them has been
valid, according to Karen Kramer,
director of Stanford's Berlin pro
gram.
"One of the problems with ter
rorism is that it is so arbitrary and
irrational," making it nearly
impossible to predict a terrorist
act, Kramer said.
There is no way of knowing
when or where a terrorist will
strike, she said, but added that
the "real targets are likely to be
official American institutions,"
such as U.S. military and govern
ment buildings because of their
symbolic importance.
Nevertheless, students and
staff have taken additional secu
rity measures. Two weeks ago, a
security officer from the U.S.
Embassy in Berlin spoke about
ways to minimize the likelihood of
becoming terrorist targets, such
as avoiding American bars and
restaurants, looking out for suspi
cious activity while in public and
not wearing college sweatshirts or
other typically American clothing.
StafT members have also imple
mented security measures for
themselves and the students. For
example, they established a "tele
phone tree" to pass urgent infor
mation to all in the group should
the need arise. Students live both
at the center and with families in
Berlin.
Should a significant level of ter
rorist activity in the city be
reported or other threatening

events occur, the center has estab
lished a plan to close the Stanford
building temporarily and meet in
alternative locations for informa
tional meetings and classes.
Several students said that
while they were worried about the
threat of terrorism when the war
broke out, their fears have since
subsided.
"The day the war started I was
really scared," said Mike Shep
herd, a junior majoring in history.
"When I opened the door to the
[center], I half expected a terrorist
bomb to explode."
However, Shepherd added, "As
the war proceeds, I feel safer,
probably because I accept the war
as fact, and I don't think about it
as much. Now I'm just cautious."
Many students are consciously
trying to downplay their Ameri
can appearances by wearing fewer
sweatshirts and more dark Euro
pean clothing.
Junior Porter Erisman, a polit
ical science said he bought
a "Berlin-style drab coat" to
replace the bright-colored ski
jacket he had brought with him.
"I wanted to do something not so
obviously American," he
explained.
Shepherd said he purposely left
his sweatshirts at home in antici
pation of the war in the Persian
Gulf. "I also grew my hair out so I
wouldn't look like a U.S. service
man" because American military
personnel are one of the most
likely terrorist targets, he said.
However, not wearing a sweat
shirt is far easier than not speak
ing German with an American
accent, many students have
found. Some students said they
feel nervous about their accent
identifying them as an American.
"Every time you open your
mouth, you're wearing a sign that
you're an American," said junior
Marty Smith, a public policy
mfyor.
Erisman said when he ordered
something in German at an Arab
