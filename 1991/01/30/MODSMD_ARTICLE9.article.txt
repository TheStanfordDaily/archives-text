# Peacemonger to be revived
## Will Vietnam-era paper have new life in the '90s? 
### Michael Friedly Editorial staff 
In an attempt to draw parallels
between the Persian Gulf War and the
Vietnam War, a group of Stanford stu
dents is trying to revive Peacemonger, a
Stanford newspaper originally pub
lished in the late 19605.
The paper, will include calendars for
anti-war activity, information about
draft counseling and student opinions
on the war, according to graduate stu
dent David Porter, who is leading the
drive to restart Peacemonger. The first
issue will probably be published next
week, he said.
Porter said the new Peacemonger
would serve "as a source of inspiration
and strength" for the current anti-war
movement, although he stressed that
the views in the newspaper would not be
"an official voice of the anti-war move
ment."
He said leaders of the Stanford Stu
dents for Peace in the Middle East, the
main anti-war group on caitipus, were
not involved in the organization of
Peacemonger, but were "uniformly
enthusiastic" about its new beginning.
Porter said he feels the current anti
war movement should strengthen itself
by drawing from elements of the protest
movements of the '60s and Peacemon
ger could be one such element.
Peacemonger originally began pub
lishing in 1969 and billed itself as a
"forum for the Vietnam moratorium."
The moratorium was "an attempt by
Stanford students and faculty as part of
nationwide movement to bring a mora
torium on the Vietnam War and bring it
to a peaceful settlement," according to
Larry Diamond, a senior research fellow
at the Hoover Institution who con
tributed to the newspaper in 1969 and
1970.
What separated the Vietnam morato
rium movement from other anti-war
and anti-draft movements was that the
moratorium was a "liberal, peaceful and
law-abiding attempt" to push for a nego
tiated settlement to the war, according
to Diamond. The movement was "firmly
opposed to violence of any kind in
demonstrations, or to illegal acts, such
as shutting down buildings," he said.

'There is one very strong
parallel (between the Gulf
war and Vietnam), and
that Is that tens of thou
sands of Americans were
dying In a war in Vietnam,
thousands of miles away,
In a war that Was not
fought for the defense of
American borders.'

"It did have some impact in persuad
ing President Nixon to begin withdraw
ing from the war," Diamond said. "It
was part of a whole wide range of pres
sures that were building up in Amer

ica.
Diamond wrote a number of anti
draft articles for Peacemonger during
his freshman year at Stanford, one
under the headline "Selective Servitude
System."
"There are a lot of parallels between
the current war and the Vietnam War,"
Porter said, citing the foreign policy of
Presidents Bush and Johnson and the
presence of a strong anti-war move
ment.
"Given the parallels, I thought it
would be worth restarting the newspa
per," Porter said.
However, Diamond strongly dis
agreed that there are many parallels
between the Vietnam War and the Gulf
War and said the same conditions that
led to the original creation of Peacemon
ger do not currently exist.
Diamond, who said he supports the
current war, cited the lack of a military
draft as one difference. The draft during
the '60s was one of the most contested
issues of the Vietnam War.
He also cited the differing lengths of
the conflicts. Whereas the Vietnam War
was fought "pointlessly and in a dead
locked fashion for a number of years,"
the Gulf War "is a war that is less than
two weeks old," he said.
In addition, the Vietnam conflict

lacked the international consensus that
the Gulf War has gained, he said.
However, he added, "there is one very
strong parallel, and that is that tens of
thousands of Americans were dying in a
war in Vietnam, thousands of miles
away, in a war that was not fought for
the defense of American borders."
Although Diamond called both wars
"optional" since the United States had
the choice not to fight in either case, he
said, "The political and moral circum
stances surrounding the wars are very
different."
"Those Stanford students who see a
parallel between Vietnam and the Gulf.
.. should be aware of the fact that many
of the people who opposed the Vietnam
War think that the decision to go to war
in the Gulf, however tragic, was a neces
sary decision," Diamond said.
Peacemonger registered last week
with the Office of Student Activities as
an official organization and will now
seek funding from the ASSU Publica
tions Board, which gives money to vari
ous campus publications. Porter said
the Mid-Peninsula Peace Center has
also given the newsletter money from its
discretionary fund.
Although the original Peacemonger
was a four-page, full-size newspaper, the
re-creation will begin as an 11-inch by
17-inch newsletter.
"To overcome passivity and apathy is
the challenge of the moratorium,"
Peacemonger stated in its introductory
issue in Oct. 31, 1969.
"We have engaged in the wrong war,
in the wrong place, at the wrong time,"
the newspaper declared in another
issue.
The newspaper occasionally
employed shock tactics to make its
point. The Dec. 8,1969 cover is a collage
of photographs from the war, showing
bodies of mutilated Vietnamese, a Viet
namese woman breast-feeding her baby,
an American child with a headband say
ing "Stop the Killing" and a child with
napalm burns across her face.
Although the original newspaper was
published three times a week, Porter
said he was unsure how often the re-cre
ation would be published. "I don't
know,"he said. "I've never done this
kind of thing before."

"Given the parallels, I thought it
would be worth restarting the newspa
per," Porter said.
However, Diamond strongly dis
agreed that there are many parallels
between the Vietnam War and the Gulf
War and said the same conditions that
led to the original creation of Peacemon
ger do not currently exist.
Diamond, who said he supports the
current war, cited the lack of a military
draft as one difference. The draft during
the '60s was one of the most contested
issues of the Vietnam War.
He also cited the differing lengths of
the conflicts. Whereas the Vietnam War
was fought "pointlessly and in a dead
locked fashion for a number of years,"
the Gulf War "is a war that is less than
two weeks old," he said.
In addition, the Vietnam conflict

lacked the international consensus that
the Gulf War has gained, he said.
However, he added, "there is one very
strong parallel, and that is that tens of
thousands of Americans were dying in a
war in Vietnam, thousands of miles
away, in a war that was not fought for
the defense of American borders."
Although Diamond called both wars
"optional" since the United States had
the choice not to fight in either case, he
said, "The political and moral circum
stances surrounding the wars are very
different."
"Those Stanford students who see a
parallel between Vietnam and the Gulf.
.. should be aware of the fact that many
of the people who opposed the Vietnam
War think that the decision to go to war
in the Gulf, however tragic, was a neces
sary decision," Diamond said.
Peacemonger registered last week
with the Office of Student Activities as
an official organization and will now
seek funding from the ASSU Publica
tions Board, which gives money to vari
ous campus publications. Porter said
the Mid-Peninsula Peace Center has
also given the newsletter money from its
discretionary fund.
Although the original Peacemonger
was a four-page, full-size newspaper, the
re-creation will begin as an 11-inch by
17-inch newsletter.
"To overcome passivity and apathy is
the challenge of the moratorium,"
Peacemonger stated in its introductory
issue in Oct. 31, 1969.
"We have engaged in the wrong war,
in the wrong place, at the wrong time,"
the newspaper declared in another
issue.
The newspaper occasionally
employed shock tactics to make its
point. The Dec. 8,1969 cover is a collage
of photographs from the war, showing
bodies of mutilated Vietnamese, a Viet
namese woman breast-feeding her baby,
an American child with a headband say
ing "Stop the Killing" and a child with
napalm burns across her face.
Although the original newspaper was
published three times a week, Porter
said he was unsure how often the re-cre
ation would be published. "I don't
know,"he said. "I've never done this
kind of thing before."
In an attempt to draw parallels
between the Persian Gulf War and the
Vietnam War, a group of Stanford stu
dents is trying to revive Peacemonger, a
Stanford newspaper originally pub
lished in the late 19605.
The paper, will include calendars for
anti-war activity, information about
draft counseling and student opinions
on the war, according to graduate stu
dent David Porter, who is leading the
drive to restart Peacemonger. The first
issue will probably be published next
week, he said.
Porter said the new Peacemonger
would serve "as a source of inspiration
and strength" for the current anti-war
movement, although he stressed that
the views in the newspaper would not be
"an official voice of the anti-war move
ment."
He said leaders of the Stanford Stu
dents for Peace in the Middle East, the
main anti-war group on caitipus, were
not involved in the organization of
Peacemonger, but were "uniformly
enthusiastic" about its new beginning.
Porter said he feels the current anti
war movement should strengthen itself
by drawing from elements of the protest
movements of the '60s and Peacemon
ger could be one such element.
Peacemonger originally began pub
lishing in 1969 and billed itself as a
"forum for the Vietnam moratorium."
The moratorium was "an attempt by
Stanford students and faculty as part of
nationwide movement to bring a mora
torium on the Vietnam War and bring it
to a peaceful settlement," according to
Larry Diamond, a senior research fellow
at the Hoover Institution who con
tributed to the newspaper in 1969 and
1970.
What separated the Vietnam morato
rium movement from other anti-war
and anti-draft movements was that the
moratorium was a "liberal, peaceful and
law-abiding attempt" to push for a nego
tiated settlement to the war, according
to Diamond. The movement was "firmly
opposed to violence of any kind in
demonstrations, or to illegal acts, such
as shutting down buildings," he said.

'There is one very strong
parallel (between the Gulf
war and Vietnam), and
that Is that tens of thou
sands of Americans were
dying In a war in Vietnam,
thousands of miles away,
In a war that Was not
fought for the defense of
American borders.'

"It did have some impact in persuad
ing President Nixon to begin withdraw
ing from the war," Diamond said. "It
was part of a whole wide range of pres
sures that were building up in Amer

ica.
Diamond wrote a number of anti
draft articles for Peacemonger during
his freshman year at Stanford, one
under the headline "Selective Servitude
System."
"There are a lot of parallels between
the current war and the Vietnam War,"
Porter said, citing the foreign policy of
Presidents Bush and Johnson and the
presence of a strong anti-war move
ment.
"Given the parallels, I thought it
would be worth restarting the newspa
per," Porter said.

agreed that there are many parallels
