Fresno, Sacramento, l>os Angeles, San Diego... Amtrak's offering more of
California, forour lowest return fares ever!
Now, when Amtrak's San Joaquin gets you through the Valley, just $1 gets you
back if you return the same day. Or come back any day for $7— on any of our daily
San .Joaquins and/or San Diegans!
And that's good news with the rising cost of gas (and the increasing headaches
of driving!).
And with convenient dedicated feeder buses linking the two trains, places as
far north as Redding or as far south as the border can be yours. With on board snacks,
reclining seats, and relaxing views — without driving OR spending a fortune!
So set 1 your travel agent, or call Amtrak at 1-800-USA-RAIL.
That's not a lot to ask, is it?
