# ALLIES RETAKE IRAQI-SEIZED TOWN

DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) —
Saudi troops backed by U.S. Marines
today recaptured most of a Saudi town
seized a day earlier by Iraqi invaders. The
allied commander said despite the sur
prise Iraqi attacks, his overall battle plan
is "very much on schedule."
By mid-morning today, a small group
of Iraqi troops with about 20 armored
vehicles had been driven into one neigh
borhood of the border town of Khafji,
under siege by U.S. artillery and Saudi
soldiers assisted by Qatari tanks.
But even as the allies were beating
back the Iraqis in Khafji, Marines on the
outskirts of town said they had been told
that five or six Iraqi divisions were mass
ing just north of the Kuwaiti town of
Wafra. It was believed they were prepar
ing to launch another, bigger ground

incursion.
The seas and the skies were battle
grounds as well. British navy helicopters
apparently sank four Iraqi boats and
damaged 12 on Wednesday night, includ
ing one armed with an anti-ship Exocet
missile, said a Royal Navy spokesman in
Saudi Arabia.
Allied warplanes were in action again
today, racking up hundreds more air
strikes. The allies have flown more than
30,000 combat and support sorties so far,
and the coalition commander, Gen. H.
Norman Schwarzkopf, said Wednesday
that Iraq is now all but defenseless in the
face of the air assault.
The air attacks are systematically
destroying Iraq's military supply system,
smashing hardened shelters where Iraqi
jets had been sheltering, and continuing

to knock out troublesome Scud-type mis
sile launchers, he told reporters in Saudi
Arabia.
Allied forces had destroyed all of Iraq's
nuclear reactors, half of its biological war
fare plants, and chemical storage and pro
duction sites, Schwarzkopf said.
"By every measure, our campaign is
very much on schedule," he said.
But the commander also sounded a
note of caution: "There's no way that I'm
suggesting that the Iraqi army is close to
capitulation and going to give up." The
Iraqis, he said, "certainly have a lot of

fight left in them."
That was more than clear when Iraqi
forces — about 1,500 troops and at least
50 tanks — slammed into Saudi Arabia in
four separate advances that began Tues
day. A dozen Marines were reported killed
and two wounded — the first casualties of
the ground war.
Front-line desert troops described
nighttime fighting in freezing tempera
tures as "hellacious."
The U.S. military said much of the
Iraqi advance had been beaten back by
U.S. airpower, Marines and allied troops.
But Iraqi forces seized Khafji, an oil-and
resort town whose residents fled weeks
ago.
On Wednesday, Saudi light armored
forces reached the center of Khafji, but
the Marines pulled back under heavy

Iraqi rocket fire. "Let's get the hell out of
here!" shouted a Marine captain in a
vehicle with a TOW anti-tank missile
mounted.
When the Iraqi columns first struck
from Kuwait, some advancing T-55 tanks
had their guns facing rearward — a sign
of surrender — but the Iraqis then
opened fire, the Marines reported.
Coalition officers said Iraqi casualties
in fighting Tuesday and Wednesday were
heavy but gave no numbers. They said 21
Iraqis were taken prisoner, and about two
dozen Iraqi tanks and personnel carriers
were destroyed.
Iraqi radio said Wednesday that Sad
dam Hussein himself had planned the
ground attacks, and boasted that his
armies "are wiping out the rene
gade invaders and knocking out
the forces of infidelity, corruption,
and treason."
Despite the outbreak of fight
ing, White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater insisted the
ground war had not yet begun.
U.S. officials had said earlier
that an all-out ground war was
unlikely before February. U.S.
troop strength in the gulf region
has now passed the half-million
mark, U.S. officials said Wednes
day.
Fitzwater indicated that Presi
dent Bush would be the one to
order a ground offensive, and that
he has not given such a command.
Bush was on Capitol Hill on
Wednesday, invoking the memory
of another wartime president,
Franklin D. Roosevelt, to rally
support for Operation Desert
Storm. He told lawmakers the
goal of the Persian Gulf War is the
"triumph of the moral order."
The president made no men
tion in his brief speech of the
Marine deaths, but Fitzwater said
he was "very saddened" by them.
With the allied air fleet reign
ing the skies, Iraqi aircraft; were
fleeing to Iran in ever-growing
numbers. Schwarzkopf said
Wednesday that 89 Iraqi aircraft
had flown to Iran, which has pro
claimed its neutrality in the con
flict.
Iran has acknowledged only
that 16 Iraqi warplanes have
arrived in Iran since Saturday,
and said 11 landed successfully.
But Britain's Sky Television
news reported that as many as
200 Iraqi aircraft might be in Iran
— and that they are flying freely
back and forth between the two
countries despite Iran's assurance
to the contrary.
Iran has said the planes will be

impounded until the end of the
war, and the allies say publicly
they are taking the Tehran gov
ernment at its word.
Another Iraqi tactic keeping
the allies guessing was use of oil
as a weapon. In addition to the
giant spill that the United States
says was intentionally unleashed
by Iraq, a separate slick has been
detected in the gulf.
The latest slick emanates from

an Iraqi oil terminal,
Schwarzkopf said.
"We're watching that oil spill
and if it gets out of control we'll do
it again," he said, referring to the
precision bombing Saturday of a
Kuwaiti oil installation to staunch
the earlier slick.
Salvage experts have specu
lated that slick, estimated at 50
miles long and 12 miles wide,
would arrive off Jubail — site of

the world's largest desalination
plant — today.
Allied forces say the spill
started when Iraq intentionally
opened the valves of the offshore
Sea Island Terminal in occupied
Kuwait. It has reached 460 mil
lion gallons, the largest spill ever.
A Norwegian ship capable of
sweeping up 1,400 tons of oil an
hour has begun skimming crude
from the main slick.
