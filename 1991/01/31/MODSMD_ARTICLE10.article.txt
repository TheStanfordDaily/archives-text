# How reliable are hi-tech weapons?

### Eleni Kirkas Staff writer 
As the war in the Persian Gulf heats
up, the performance of America's high
technology weapons systems has been
credited for much of the early success in
the conflict.
But too much reliance on these sys
tems could be dangerous, warned Eric
Roberts, associate professor of com
puter science, in a program at Roble
Hall last night.
The program, which attracted a
crowd of about 40 students, centered on
a showing of "Losing Control," a 1989
film about the intricacies of command
and control systems during potential
nuclear war situations. Roberts also dis
cussed the effects of technology on the
war in the Middle East with a smaller
group of 12 students after the movie.
Roberts cautioned against becoming
too optimistic about U.S. technological
superiority in the Middle East. There is
"a big push to say technology is winning
this war," he said, citing others who

have termed the conflict "the victory of
silicon over steel."
The reliability of our systems in the
Gulf has not yet been determined, par
ticularly in battle, Roberts warned. "We
don't know what the success ratios are,"
he said. "We know that these things can
work in some cases, but we also know
that they won't work uniformly."
He also noted the possibility that the
effort to develop the Strategic Defense
Initiative weapons system — designed
to prevent incoming missiles from
reaching the United States — would be
revived because of some successes of
high-tech weaponry in the Middle East.
He cited the Patriot missiles, which
have intercepted and destroyed Iraqi
Scud missiles bound for Israel and
Saudi Arabia, as one example.
The film itself focuses on the now
diminished threat of nuclear war
between the United States arid the
Soviet Union. One aspect of its escala
tion scenario involves chemical and
nuclear warfare in the Middle East, a
situation that some consider a possibil

ity if the Gulf War expands into an Arab-
Israeli conflict.
The film also emphasizes that the
high potential for both human and tech
nological error could cause heightened
states of alert and even premature
launches of nuclear missiles.
For instance, the world nearly went
to war in 1980 when a 49-cent computer
chip failed at NORAD, the North Amer
ican Aerospace Defense Command Cen
ter in Colorado that monitors nuclear
missile activity.
In 1979, a technician mistakenly
inserted a training tape simulating a
Soviet attack into a monitoring device.
Flocks of geese and the rising moon
have also been mistaken by radar for
incoming Soviet missiles, almost caus
ing retaliatory attacks by the United
States, according to the film.
In such high-pressure situations, gov
ernment officials frequently have less
than five minutes to decide whether the
attack is real and whether to retaliate.
