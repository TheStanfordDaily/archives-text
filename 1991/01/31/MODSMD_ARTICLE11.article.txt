# The

How likely is it that an editorial entitled
"Teach the Sunny Side of the War" would
appear in The Daily?
Maybe not in 1991, but such an editorial
appeared in The Daily Palo Alto, The
Daily's predecessor, Apr. 19, 1917, shortly
after the United States entered World War
I. The editors urged the administration to
teach all students, not just ones entering
the military, how to help the troops over
seas.
They also compared Stanford women
joining in the war effort to "flowers of the
spring â€” pretty but not very useful."
While The Daily would probably not
make such a comparison today, coverage of
the war in the Middle East has been similar
to the Daily'B reporting of previous wars.
The Daily has extensively covered every
major U.S. war this century. No newspapers
were available from the time of the Span
ish-American War of 1898.
Every war except World War I was
reported using articles from United Press
International and the Associated Press as
well as those of Daily staff. In 1917 and
1918, The Daily Palo Alto relied exclusively
on original stories, only covering war news
that affected Stanford students.
While events of the World War I took
place in another hemisphere, those of the
next war were much closer to home.
After the attack on Pearl Harbor, many
Californians worried that they could be the

next Japanese target. On Dec. 11, 1941,
four days after the"day of infamy," The
Daily listed blackout instructions on the
front page in case of enemy attack, and Uni
versity President Ray Lyman Wilbur
warned everyone to be ready.
Even in the face of imminent attack,
however, The Daily ran an article on "black
out etiquette."
During the Korean War, articles about
"uhe Reds" were strictly serious. The Daily
usually ran AP stories on the conflict in
prominent positions and even printed maps
of Korea showing how far the U.N. forces
had advanced.
Only 15 years later, stopping the spread
of communism became passd, and stopping
the Vietnam War more newsworthy. As a
result, The Daily gave greater coverage to
anti-war protesters than the war in Viet
nam.
For example, when the United States
resumed bombing of North Vietnam in
early 1966, The Daily paid scant attention
and instead ran huge articles and a two
page pictorial on the student rallies. And,
unlike their predecessors 50 years earlier,
the editorial board advocated a write-in
campaign to the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee to urge members to stop the
bombing.
The anti-war stand distinguished the
Vietnam War coverage from that of all
other wars. This stridency, however, did not
reach its peak until the United States had
been at war with Vietnam for a number of
years.
