Stocks soar in response to good news
NEW YORK (AP) — The stock market surged ahead yesterday
to its highest levels since last summer, responding to reports of
success by U.S.-led forces in the first concerted ground fighting of
the war in the Persian Gulf.
Analysts said numerous stocks also benefited from growing
evidence that the domestic economy was in better shape than pre
viously believed.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 50.50 points
to 2,713.12, its highest close since it stood at 2,748.27 on Aug. 15.
Prices pushed ahead steadily as positive reports came in of the
results of ground fighting between Iraqi forces and U.S. marines
in Saudi Arabia.
Talk of a shorter, less severe slump in business activity gave a
notable lift to "cyclical" stocks in industries whose fortunes close
ly follow the ups and downs of the economy.
In the auto sector, for instance, General Motors rose 1 3/8 to 35
1/4 and Ford Motor 1 1/8 to 27 7/8.
Among basic-industry stocks, Aluminum Co. of America
gained 3 3/4 to 65; Alcan Aluminium 3/8 to 21; Dow Chemical 1
1/4 to 51 7/8, and International Paper 1 3/8 to 59 7/8.
Landsbergis warns West of Kremlin promises
VILNIUS, U.S.S.R. (AP) - Truckloads of Soviet troops left
Lithuania's capital yesterday, but republic President Vytautas
Landsbergis said many sites remained occupied and warned the
West not to be taken in by Kremlin promises.
The civilian death toll in the crackdowns in Lithuania and
Latvia rose to 19 yesterday when Jonas Tautkus, 20, died from a
gunshot wound to the head he suffered at a military checkpoint
Tuesday. One soldier also has died.
Soviet Interior Minister Boris Pugo said all paratroopers
already have left the Baltic region and two-thirds of the "black
beret" Interior Ministry troops had been withdrawn.
His statement followed an announcement by President Bush
on Tuesday that Soviet officials assured him they were reducing
the military presence in the region and planning to start talks.
Responding to Bush's announcement that Moscow had con
veyed a willingness to "move away from violence," Landsbergis
said the United States should be wary of Soviet promises.
He said a troop withdrawal could be the key to renewed nego
tiations with the Kremlin, but Soviet soldiers still were occupying
the television center and other buildings seized violently in mid-
January.
"It is regrettable that the promises of the Soviet leadership are
so often broken ... brutally," Landsbergis told journalists at his
office.
Lithuanian officials said witnsses reported seeing troops with
draw from Vilnius, but had no confirmation any had actually left
the republic.
