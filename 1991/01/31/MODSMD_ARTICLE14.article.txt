RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) — On the day of the
first mtyor ground battle of the war, Gen. H. Norman
Schwarzkopf painted a sweeping picture yesterday of
pinpoint bombings that have left Iraq virtually
defenseless from air attacks.
In an upbeat assessment dampened by the deaths

of 12 Marines in the Iraqi attack on the Saudi border
town of Khafji, Schwarzkopf said his message to
Saddam Hussein was, "The best is yet to come."
The U.S. commander of Operation Desert Storm
said the allied forces have gained "air supremacy,"
systematically destroying Iraq's military supply sys
tem with two weeks of precision air attacks on roads,
bridges and ammunition dumps.
"By every measure, our campaign plan is very
much on schedule," Schwarzkopf told reporters. He
said he did not think Iraq was close to surrendering,
but was "quite confident" that the multinational
forces' effort would lead to "the outcome we all want
to see."
Schwarzkopf shared the podium with an air force
general, who explained videotapes of bombing
attacks on Iraqi airfields, bridges and mobile Scud
missile launchers.
Brig. Gen. Buster Glosson, deputy chief of Cen
tral Command Air Forces, demonstrated how laser
guided "smart bombs" destroyed more than 70
"hardened" shelters, many with aircraft inside.
The videotapes, taken during night raids by nose
mounted gun cameras, showed the bombs arrowing
toward the targets that then exploded in white
flashes and black smoke.
"I'm now going to show you a picture of the luck
iest man in Iraq on this particular day," Schwarzkopf
said, pointing to a truck being driven across a bridge
that was in the gunner's sites.
"Look here — right through the crosshairs," the
general said as the truck rolled through the bulls eye
and out of the picture.
"And now in his rearview mirror . .
Schwarzkopf said, drawing laughter, as the black
and-white video showed the bridge exploding with
the impact of a missile.
"Quite frankly the Iraqis are running out of
places to hide," said Schwarzkopf.
