SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -
California's health chief is urging
two large pension funds and sev
eral universities to take a step tac
tically similar to the campaign
against apartheid by unloading
their tobacco company holdings.
Dr. Kenneth Kizer, director of
the state Health Services Depart
ment, has sent letters to the Uni
versity of California, Stanford
University, the University of
Southern California, the State
Teachers' Retirement System and

the Public Employees' Retirement
System, encouraging them to
divest.
The five institutions have a
total of at least $546 million in
such investments, the state health
department said.
Kizer said yesterday that it
makes no sense for state agencies
and public and private colleges to
invest in tobacco companies while
the health department conducts a
$150 million anti-smoking cam
paign, financed by a voter

approved increase in the state
tobacco tax.
"It seems so incongruous to
me. I've been mulling this over for
some time," he said.
Kizer said he hopes to provoke
a debate like the one that led the
state pension funds three years
ago to sell their stock in
companies doing business in
South Africa.
"This is analogous to South
Africa (divestiture) I think in
many ways," Kizer said.
