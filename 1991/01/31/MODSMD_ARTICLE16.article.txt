# Economic gauge offers hope

WASHINGTON (AP) - The government's
chief economic barometer rose a slight 0.1 percent
in December, the first increase in six months, and
what one analyst said was "a faint ray of light"
the recession could end by midyear.
Many economists agreed that the Commerce
Department's Index of Leading Economic Indica
tors, released yesterday, suggested that the con
traction will not deepen, though they cautioned it
was no harbinger of sudden recovery.
"It indicates only that we're through the worst
of the downturn," said economist Allen Sinai of
the Boston Co. "It does not tell us the bottom is in
sight" although "it is a faint ray of light in terms
of second-half recovery."
Six of the 11 forward-looking components of
the index had positive showings in December.
They included higher stock prices, a longer aver
age workweek and orders for new plants and
equipment.
Other positive contributors were an improve
ment in an index measuring consumer confi
dence, a decline in initial unemployment claims
and an increase in unfilled orders at factories.
Negative contributors were fewer factory
orders for consumer goods, a decline in building
permits, faster business delivery times, a drop in
prices of raw materials and a decline in the money

supply.
Economist Robert Dederick of the Northern
Trust Co. in Chicago concurred that the report
"should not be taken as an argument that the
economy is in the process of bottoming out" but
"it is further support for the mild recession sce
nario."
Government economists, both in the adminis
tration and on Capitol Hill, have said the reces
sion will be shorter and milder than the average
downturn since World War 11, ending sometime
during the second or third quarters.
President Bush said in his State of the Union
message Tuesday night that while "the largest
peacetime economic expansion in history has been
temporarily interrupted ... we will get this reces
sion behind us, and return to growth — soon."
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
greeted the leading indicators report as "encour
aging news."
Separately, an 11-member panel of bank
economists assembled by the American Bankers
Association predicted yesterday the recession
would be over by summer, if — as the group
expects — the Federal Reserve allows interest
rates to decline further and the Persian Gulf war
does not interrupt oil supplies.
