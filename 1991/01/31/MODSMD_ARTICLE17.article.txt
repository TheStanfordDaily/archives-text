# Gorbachev reportedly sharing power
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev is
no longer in complete control of
his government and is, in effect,
sharing power with the military,
according to knowledgeable Soviet
officials.
In private conversation during
Foreign Minister Alexander Bess
mertnykh's visit to Washington
this week, one source told The
Associated Press the Soviet presi
dent "can't make decisions on his
own and expect them to be carried
out."
"Gorbachev is not completely
in control," said the source, who isÂ®
well placed to observe Kremlin
decision-making.
The source said the military
high command is pressing Gor
bachev to go along with a nation
wide crackdown to restore order
in the crisis-torn country. Defense

Minister Dmitri Yazov, who is gen
erally viewed as loyal to the presi
dent and supportive of his
reforms, is "not necessarily"
among those urging the Soviet
president to get tough, this source
said.
The crackdown has ranged
from bloody assaults on separatist
government facilities in the
Baltics to giving the KGB blanket
authority to search foreign and
domestic business offices for
black-market activities.
A second Soviet official, also
speaking on condition he not be
identified, echoed the report that
Gorbachev isn't solidly in control
and said preservation of the union
has become the single highest pri
ority for the Kremlin, taking
precedence over the political, eco
nomic and foreign policy reforms
that have been the hallmark of

Gorbachev's six-year rule.
"This is the most critical
moment in the last 100 years, per
haps in the millennium of our
country'B history," the source
said, seeking to explain the grav
ity with which the government
regards the situation. He said the
union is disintegrating under
pressure from separatist forces
and a breakdown of law and order
that followed the easing of tradi
tionally harsh central control over
Soviet life.
A prominent Soviet reformer,
Deputy Moscow Mayor Sergei
Stankevich, told The Associated
Press in Moscow on Monday that
Gorbachev appears to have fallen
under the influence of Commu
nist Party hardliners and mili
tarists as his reformist colleagues
have been dropped from power or
have deserted him.
