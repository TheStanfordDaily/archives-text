# Universities plan student war efforts
## 
### Lisa Nellor Staff writer 
While working to expand pro
grams on the Persian Gulf War at
Stanford, the Council of Presi
dents is also communicating with
student leaders at other West
Coast schools about war-related
issues.
Student body presidents of the
universities in the Pacific 10 Con
ference met last week to discuss
reactions on their campuses to the
war in the Middle East and to plan
ways to respond to student issues
related to the war.
At Stanford, COP member
Goodwin Liu said the COP plans
to initiate dorm discussions about
the war. The COP is also compil
ing a resource guide for students
containing information about
such services as blood donation,
draft counseling and enlistment,
he said.
"Our responsibility is to take
care of the broadest number of
student concerns," Liu said. The
resource guide will be distributed
to resident assistants early next
week, he said.
At the meeting, the student
body presidents drafted four reso
lutions which they plan to submit
to their respective universities
next week, said COP member
Jamie Green, who attended the
conference.
Three resolutions were unani
mously signed by all Pac-10
schools. The proposals urge uni
versities:
• Not to penalize students who
are drafted and forced to with
draw,
• To make education about war
issues a priority, and
• To respect the freedom of
expression of all students, espe-
cially those who are Arab, Arab-
American and Jewish.
Four schools declined to sign a
fourth resolution which criticizes
President Bush's funding of the
large costs of the war in light of
recent cuts in funding for educa
tion. Green said Stanford's COP
supported this resolution.
Representatives from UCLA,
UC-Berkeley, Oregon State Uni
versity and the Universities of
Washington and Oregon also sup
ported the fourth resolution.
Student body presidents from
USC and Washington State Uni
versity, rejected the resolution,
and representatives from the Uni
versity of Arizona and Arizona
State University have not yet
made a decision, Green said.
A complete list of the resolu
tions will be released next week,
Green said.
In addition, she said five stu

dent-body presidents — from
Stanford, Oregon State Univer
sity, UC-Berkeley and the Univer
sities of Oregon and Washington
— plan to write a letter to newspa
pers across the country address
ing the larger issues surrounding
American military action in the
Gulf.
"It's not going to be a totally
anti-Bush letter," she said. "It will
focus on the long-term implica
tions of the war on the future of
our country." Green said she did
not know when the letter would
be released.
The COP is also trying to main
tain an open discussion of the war
on campus.
"A lot of people haven't been
attending the planned events,"
Liu said. "So we've decided to take
the events to them."
Beginning in Lagunita Court,
the COP is sponsoring dorm pro
grams on the Gulf war, Liu said.
The programs will include speak
ers and small-group discussions
and will present both sides of the
issue, he said.

"People are looking for a safe,
supportive environment to talk
about these things," said Liu.
The COP is also trying to coor
dinate the disparate efforts of
many campus groups, such as
Students for Peace and the orga
nizers of last week's teach-in, he
said.
"Our role is not to arrange all
the events ourselves," said Liu.
"Our key function is to facilitate
the actions of other students."
Their efforts have included
scheduling rooms for teach-in pro
grams and paying for the listing of
teach-in information in The Daily
last week.
In addition, Green said the
COP is attempting to broaden the
discussion to include "long-term
educational issues, like America's
energy policy and defense policy."
"We can't just focus on stop
ping the war, because when it's
over, there will still be lots of prob
lems," she said.
Green said most Pac-10 schools
had also planned teach-ins and
demonstrations.
