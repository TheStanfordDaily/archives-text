## Welcome proposals 
### 
President Bush outlined
a vague, long overdue
domestic policy agenda

WE APPLAUD PRESI
DENT BUSH for the spe
cific plans he proposed
when he addressed Congress Tues
day night. Now what we need is
more of them.
While Bush's speech was sim
plistic and idealistic, it was almost
to be expected. The majority of the
president's annual State of the
Union address predictably dealt
with America as a world power at
war.
Bush and the Congress were
correct in supporting our troops in
the Gulf, but more attention
should have been given to Amer
ica's domestic agenda.
Education, sound banks, health
care — these are all worthy issues
to address, but Bush just sounded
a little too optimistic for him to be
credible.
These have manifestly been
Bush's less successful areas, and it
would do this country a lot of good
if he establishes some priorities
and makes a firm commitment to
them.
Now is also the time to address
the issue of civil rights. Quotas are
likely going to be a hot election
topic in 1992, and it doesn't help
Bush to dodge the issue anymore.
Now is the time to define his stance
and commit himself against
"racism, bigotry and hate" and to
"strengthen the laws against
employment discrimination."
The reason is simple: what we
don't need now is for Bush to pro
pose token legislation in these
areas.

Let us hope that Bush is right in
that our recession will be short
lived and America is not in actual
decline. "The hard work of free
dom" has to be done in the next
century. Let us hope Bush can lead
the nation in this direction with
some concrete ideas.
The president's most significant
domestic proposals in his address
included a call to end all political
actipn committees.
Bush showed some courage on
his part in challenging a system in
which Congress and the adminis
tration are deeply entrenched.
Hypocritical though it may seem,
and unrealistic though it may
sound, it doesn't hurt trying to
right a wrong if the president is
assertive enough.
Bush has long championed a
reduced tax for long-term capital
gains, and its success is contingent
upon acknowledging the existing
opposition in Congress, which he
did. Hopefully, cooperation will
replace partisan bickering, so poli
cies that can truly encourage
investment — as opposed to merely
benefitting the rich — would be
devised.
With a great oil slick floating
around the Persian Gulf and a war
that many see as being fought for
oil, it's about time that Bush calls
for a "greater use of alternative
energy." Although big business has
traditionally been hostile to enviro
nental initiatives, this is the time
when Bush can safely be a conser
vation president without fear of
alienating his political supporters.
With a budget crunch, however,
his energy plan, juxtaposed with
one for a new highway nat
urally leads to the question of pri
ority. Despite the jobs that it would
create, a plan for more roads
should not be at the top of our
"must do" list.
