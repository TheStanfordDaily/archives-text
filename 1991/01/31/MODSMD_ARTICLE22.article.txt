## Heidi Durrow throws down 
### 
CAN WE JUST ADMIT IT? Virginia
Tsai got off with her final column
on Monday.
No longer the halting, apologetic
writer poised before us with an sheepish
grin — Virginia Tsai finally fought back.
The evil mail and snide remarks suddenly
seemed unfounded. The woman's writing
had some bite this week.
Maybe that's what her critics wanted
all along — and if so, they got it. Go on,
girl! You sure showed them. What the hell
did they know anyway?
Besides, after all is said and done, I
think Virginia Tsai got the last laugh any
way. Though some labeled her inept, at
least they talked about her. And isn't that
exactly what a columnist wants?
Even if you didn't like her, you cer
tainly did think about what she said. You
certainly did talk about what she said.
Just face it: Virginia Tsai was on your
mind.
So give the woman a hand — she did
what she was supposed to do.
Now, I'm not even going to try to
match Virginia Tsai's final column with
this — my final column as well . . .
because frankly I've run out of things to
say — at least things that will fill up this
space.
You see, at the beginning of my colum
nist stint I had a few more ideas, but I
just couldn't turn them into 4,100-char
acter Microsoft Word documents. Here
are a few of the things that never got to
print:
Heidi's Top 7 undeveloped column
ideas:
• Be Kind to Hashers: This was going

to be an etiquette lesson for some arro
gant Stanford students. I hash at Stern
and it just amazes me how the residents
treat hashers at times. A reminder: Even
though we wear plaid hats and aprons, we
are still students like you. Treat us with
respect.
• Casual Sex — Just Don't Do It: Now,
of course there are a million health rea
sons — ranging from AIDS to pregnancy
to curable STDs — for not letting some
thing like this become a« habit, but how
about another factor: retaining your self
respect?
I mean, how can you possibly feel good
about yourself when you indulge in after
noon flings? You know what happens
next. Either she doesn't call, or he doesn't
visit again. You feel awkward and you feel
used and you feel miserable.
Instead of indulging in a fling, you
could take lessons from Joel Stein and his
antics at the sperm bank ... which brings
me to another column idea:
• Something Funny: I tried to write
something funny; I really did. And in fact,
I tried it with this column — you probably
couldn't tell. But alas, we can't all be Joel.
• Something about White People: I
guess I may have alienated some non
black readers with such an emphasis on
all this black stuff. Apparently, people got
tired of everything being about black
folks. If I had it to do all over again, I'd
dedicate my column to a different race
each week.
Perhaps I could have written about the
oppression of the white American because
of affirmative action laws. Oh wait — I'm
not a Stanford Review columnist, am I?

• Black People Are Great: Now this
would have been the best column of all
times.
I would have exalted My People and
invoked the wisdom of our ancestors —
the mighty brown Egyptians. I would
have praised our leaders: Malcolm,
Martin and Mandela.
I would have called for the destruction
of the oppressive forces that seek to
destroy the black man, the black woman,
the black family, the black community. I
would have lifted every voice to sing of
our greatness.
I sure wish I wrote this column . ..
because isn't this what you all wanted to
hear?
• Black People Are Great, Part II: This
column would have propelled my popular
ity to dizzying heights as I praised: Black
fraternities and sororities for their public
service contributions (extra kudos to the
Alphas and Deltas, etc.); the Black theme
house; the Black House and the blackness
of black students in general.
• And last, but not least, I had planned
to write a column titled: "Power to the
Bootie!" I know it's been done before, but
you wouldn't mind reading something
like that again, would you?

Heidi Durrow's hair is really a weave,
and those are green contacts. This will be
her final column if you all are lucky.
