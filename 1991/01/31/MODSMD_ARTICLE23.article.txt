## Administrator's dismissal shows disrespect for Latinos 
### 
AS STUDENTS WHO ARE
ACTIVE leaders of Stanford's
Latino community organizations,
we are writing to express our concern
and dismay over the recent decision to
terminate the Office of Mexican-Ameri
can Affairs and its assistant provost, Fer
nando de Necochea.
The University made its decision dur
ing finals week of autumn quarter —
when students were leaving for the holi
days and could not voice their concerns
on the issue.
Worse, the University did not consult
with students or staff. In its letter of ter
mination, the University listed budget
balancing as the sole reason for dis
missal. The University did not look at
performance.
The decision is shocking and disap
pointing to those of us who value the
services that the office has provided over
the years. In the least, University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's decision has
come as a rude awakening to those of us
who believed in the University's commit
ment of institutionalizing and expanding
the presence of Latinos and other ethnic
minorities at Stanford.
It is disheartening to see the Univer
sity cut resources that have come about
through prolonged years of struggle. We
can only interpret this anti-Latino action
as a sign that the University is no longer
committed to maintaining and improving

the quality of life for Stanford Latinos,
and that it is willing to compromise its
vision of multiculturalism during reposi
tioning.
The services and resources of the
Office of Mexican-American Affairs are
vital to the sustenance and continued
prosperity of Latino community. The
office is unique in that it is the only
Latino resource that reaches out collec
tively to Latino faculty, staff and stu
dents in its efforts to initiate programs.
The office also gives Latinos a vehicle by
which to get their views heard in the
upper administrative levels and provides
access to outside community projects and
organizations. In addition, the Office of
Mexican-American Affairs was involved
in the task force that proposed the
change in the Western Cultur%program
to Cultures, Ideas and Values *nd in the
planning for the Stanford in Washington
program and the University Committee
on Minority Issues.
The termination of the Office of Mexi
can-American Affairs and the loss of de
Necochea, the only Mexican-American
member of the president and provost's
staff and one of only three senior Mexi
can-American staff in the University,
blatantly contradicts the basic goals and
intent of the UCMI report.
The report notes that there is already
"significant underrepresentation of
minorities in senior-level positions."

We can only interpret this
as a sign that the Universi
ty is no longer committed
to improving the quality of
life for Latinos.

(UCMI Report, p. 235) The report goes
on to say that "as an employer, Stanford
makes a statement — especially to stu
dents — about its values and goals by
how its treats its minority staff." (ibid, p.
209)
The University's message has come
across loud and clear: Latino staff and
resources are expendable and of low pri
ority to the University's agenda.
Furthermore, this act seems to be
part of a recurring pattern of institu
tional disenfranchisement and neglect of
Stanford Latinos. Ed Moran, formerly
the only Latino lawyer in the General
Counsel's Office, Yvette Sanchez-
Klemm, former assistant dean for
Human Resources for the School of
Humanities and Sciences, Frank Mon
talvo, former director of compensation at
Stanford Medical Center, and Juana
Guevara, former assistant to the presi
dent of Stanford Hospital, have all left
Stanford after years of service due to lay
offs or lack of career advancement.

Most recently, the University has
failed to find a replacement to fill the
position of an assistant director of
undergraduate admissions whose pri
mary task involves Latino recruitment.
The University has also succeeded in
dismantling the Stanford Literacy Pro
ject and in over-burdening Roberto Tru
jillo, curator of the Mexican-American
Research Collections, by compelling him
to attend to other collections. Mean
while, it has failed to increase the work
ing budget of El Centro Chicano.
It is ironic and embarrassing that the
University's inattentiveness should come
only two years after it vowed a commit
ment to strengthen and support diver
sity as stated in the UCMI report.
Either the University is violating its
policy of ensuring staff diversity, or it is
hypocritical in the policy it has so
proudly espoused and flaunted.
As students who have worked closely
with University administrators and staff,
we equally understand the need to
streamline the University and solve the
current fiscal crisis. However, we are
determined to fight any regression in the
University's commitment to Latino affir
mative action and cut-backs in Latino
resources.
