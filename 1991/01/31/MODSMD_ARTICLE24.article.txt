# Use of troops will make matters worse in the Soviet Union

Dear President Gorbachev:
Just over six months ago you arrived
at Stanford University in Palo Alto,
Calif., greeted by thousands of cheering

Stanford students who lauded you for
the changes you have initiated in your
country and in Eastern Europe since you
took power in 1985.
With your tacit, if not direct, approval
of the liberalization process which took
place in the now fledgling democracies of
Eastern Europe, we in the West have
viewed you as a champion of freedom â€”
a man who made a definite break with
the authoritarian rule of the past.
No doubt you felt our excitement and

sensed our approval. The Stanford com
munity saw you as a leader of integrity
committed to democratization.
However, your use of force in the
Baltic states of Lithuania and Latvia,
your desire to repeal the law on freedom
of the press and your most recent decree
granting the army and the KGB
increased power to search and seize have
greatly disappointed us.
Many of us are now questioning your
intentions and commitment to demo-

cratic reform. We understand that you
are faced with demanding and complex
problems which have no easy solutions.
Your decision to use force to resolve
them, however, is deplorable. Force will
not solve the Soviet Union's domestic
problems; it will only aggravate them.
