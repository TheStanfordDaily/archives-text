## The 						Persian Gulf War A 						peaceful solution to crisis must be found without more bloodshed 
### 
THE STANFORD AFRICAN Stu
dent Association deeply regrets the
outbreak of war in the Persian
Gulf and appeals to the humanity of all
parties to seek a peaceful solution to the
crisis and to avoid any further bloodshed
at all costs.
The organization, which is committed
to the principle of self-determination,
condemns the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait. We are of the opinion that the
Iraqi government could have sought a
peaceful solution to their differences
with the Kuwaiti government.
Being committed to the sanctity of
human life, we equally condemn the
alliance's attack on Iraq proper and the
heavy human cost of the bombing of Iraq
carried out by American and other for
eign troops in the Gulf. Throughout the
crisis, our organization has condemned
the double standards of Western govern
ments, such as the one denouncing
Iraq's occupation of Kuwait while toler
ating Israel's occupation of Palestine.
At this moment, we invite all parties
to act in a manner which encourages
peace. We hope that the leaders of the
non-aligned nations and truly neutral
organizations such as the Organization
of African Unity propose peace initiatives
that could prove fruitful.
Despite the fact that we believe that
the United Nation's neutrality in this
destructive conflict has been compro-

This crisis has already led to the large destruc
tion and loss of life in Kuwait and the waste of
billions of dollars in military expenditure on the
part of many countries.

mised, we also encourage U.N. Secretary-
General Javier Perez de Cuellar to pro
pose dialogue among the parties at stake.
Meanwhile, we call on both sides to
respect international conventions
regarding the sanctity of civilians and
the rights of prisoners of war.
This crisis has already led to the large
destruction and loss of life in Kuwait,
and the waste of billions of dollars in
military expenditure on the part of many
countries. Poorer countries, in particular
countries on the African continent and
the diaspora, are already paying a high
economic price.
We hope that despite these initial
drawbacks, the crisis, if solved peacefully,
will yet bring forth positive conse
quences: the end to all hostage taking
and attacks against the sovereignty of
nations; an international peace confer
ence examining the Palestinian and Kur
dish problems, as well as other dilem
mas; and a reexamination of a Middle

Eastern order, which has seen both large
amounts of the world's petroleum
reserves, as well as the petrodollars ema
nating from the sale of this petroleum,
entering into Western economies while
the most fundamental needs of the
masses of many Arab countries (and
poor countries in general) remain unat
tended to.
Only after such problems have been
considered in a global perspective can
one begin to talk about an authentic
"new world order".
Our belief in the sanctity of human
life drives us to hope that no more fami
lies, be they Iraqi, Israeli, Jordanian,
Egyptian, Senegalese or Syrian, Saudi or
American, have to grieve over the loss of
loved ones, military or civilian, as we
move into an era of increasing uncer
tainty.
