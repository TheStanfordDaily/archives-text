# Daily shouldn't say supporters of Gulf policy are 'pro-war'
## 
### 
With all the events going on today
from a war in the Middle East to rallies
here in the Bay Area, people turn to the
media to keep in touch with all that is
happening. More than that, people rely
on the media to provide an unbiased
view when presenting the facts. That is
why I was particularly disturbed by arti
cles in The Daily that imply supporters
of our presence in the Persian Gulf are
"pro-war."
In particular, an article in the Jan. 25
paper was entitled "War supporters
gather in White Plaza." Another article
on Jan. 19 focused on rallies that took
place in front of Tom Campbell's house
on the night of Jan. 18. From the head
line on the front page to the caption of

the picture next to it to the continuation
on page 16, the two groups involved were
referred to as "pro-war" ralliers and
"peace activists."
The connotations of those two titles
are very misleading, although they have
been thrown around loosely by reporters
and journalists around the nation.
To me, when one says, "pro-war," the
image immediately brought to mind is
that of a man in dark glasses who gets a
kick out of manipulating toy soldiers
around on his desk and blowing them up
violently.
I believe that if any of the "pro-war"
ralliers had been asked, none of them
would have replied that they wanted the
negotiations to fail so that they could
watch hundreds and thousands of lives
destroyed over a land dispute.
Moreover, I would be willing to gam
ble that each and every one of the ral
liers would love a peaceful resolution to
be found so that the troops that they so
vehemently support could be brought
home safely.

Therefore, dubbing one group the
"peace activists" and one group the "pro
war activists" is as biased as calling them
the "good guys" and the "bad guys."
Furthermore, the writer did a great
job of emphasizing the fact that the rally
was led by and well-attended by the Col
lege Republicans. The fact is that not all
of the ralliers belonged to this group, as
is mentioned casually in a small para
graph beginning: "Not all of the pro-war
demonstrators were College Republicans.
.." Surely no reader would be misled to
believe that those who support the war
effort are conservatives.
I can see two uniting views between
the two groups of ralliers: support and
concern for the soldiers and hope for
eventual peace. The fact that one group
believes the answer lies in pulling our
troops out, and the other group believes
in supporting our president and con
gresspersons' decision to force Iraq out
of Kuwait, is the issue that should be
discussed and emphasized unbiasedly by
the media.

In conclusion, I hope that in future
reports The Daily will show a little more
concern for proper journalistic etiquette
and present the news with as little bias
as possible. Whether or not the rest of
the nation chooses to do so, Stanford
should set an example, as we are suppos
edly the best and the brightest, and the
hope for our future.
