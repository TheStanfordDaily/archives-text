# Campbell: To rule nuclear arms out is against U.S. policy
## 
### 
I wish to respond to your Jan. 28 edi
torial about the possible use of nuclear
weapons in the Persian Gulf and what I
have said on the subject.
Let me repeat what I said at our town
hall meeting: I consider the use of

nuclear weapons in the Persian Gulf
extremely unlikely, and it is extremely
unlikely I would ever support their use
there. To use nuclear weapons in this
context would lower the threshold for
their use on another occasion. And their
use now would threaten our position of
moral superiority.
But the question at the town hall
meeting went further, whether I would
say "never" to the use of tactical nuclear
weapons — ever. I could not say that.
That is in keeping with unbroken U.S.
policy since the nuclear age dawned.
The reason for this policy is to main
tain a nuclear deterrent; if we adopted a
policy of saying "never," it would be
equivalent to unilateral disarmament.
We all hope and pray nuclear weapons
will never be used. I repeat, it is
extremely unlikely I could support their
use. I just would not say absolutely
never, ever — nor has any American
president, Democrat or Republican.
