## Morgan is ready for starting role against Oregon 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
Twelve months ago, Jim Mor
gan was a redshirt center. He
watched Stanford's home basket
ball games from way at the end of
the bench, wore street clothes,
and probably wished he had a bet
ter view of the action.
Six weeks ago, Jim Morgan was
a backup center. He was in uni
form now, and he'd moved up the
bench to sit right in the thick of
things, but he still couldn't see
everything that was going on.
Four days ago, Jim Morgan
started.
The view from the middle of
the paint is just fine, thank you
very much.
Not that Morgan has ever had
much trouble getting a good look
at anything — how hard can it be
for a guy who's 6-foot-ll? — but
still, it's nice to get some quality
time. The only thing that isn't so
great about Morgan starting is
how he got the job: a season-end
ing injury to senior forward
Andrew Vlahov.
The injury — an aggravated
bone spur in the right ankle —
actually happened over a month
ago. The pain was so severe that
Vlahov couldn't practice, but he
was able to grin and bear it during
games. He'd play, rest the ankle
until the next game, pound on it
again, and rest it ... until last
Saturday, when Vlahov decided he
couldn't stand it any more.
"I found out at the walk
through practice (for the Arizona
State game)," said Morgan, who's
been starting in practice for the
last five weeks. "We all had a feel
ing when we came out and Drew's
stuff was still in his locker.
"I have the greatest respect for
[Vlahov], that he was able to play
with that much pain," Morgan
said. "I didn't realize how much it
hurt until the Arizona game,

when he said it was the worst pain
he'd ever felt."
Vlahov had surgery yesterday
to remove the spur, and he'll be
fine in eight to 10 weeks. In the
meantime, however, the Cardinal
is going to have to figure out how
to replace the man who led the
team in steals (27) and was second
in scoring (11.3 ppg), rebounding
(6.2 rpg) and assists (3.7 apg).
"We're going to have an adjust
ment period, obviously," Stanford
coach Mike Montgomery said.
"We've practiced this way for
awhile, but Andrew always
showed up for the games. You
knew that against USC he'd guard
(Ronnie) Coleman, against UCLA
he'd take (Don) Mac Lean, he'd
rebound, play good defense. . . .
You knew what you were going to
do. Now, we have to change."
The most visible sign of that
change is Morgan, an understudy
who's spent the last five weeks
getting ready to go onstage. "It's a
little different now," Morgan said.
"There's more pressure in prac
tice to perform, and that involves
acting, like a starter. I can't make
the little mistakes anymore: I've
got to get the ball inside, rebound
more, play better defense. ...
"Back then (before Vlahov
called it quits) it seemed like a
normal rotation when I was on
the floor," Morgan said. "We
rotate the big men, so it was like
he was just out for a few minutes.
Now it's different."
The difference is that now the
other big men are coming in to
give Morgan, and not Vlahov, a
break. Morgan played 24 minutes
in Sunday's 58-47 loss to Arizona
State, but the results of his first
major performance were, we 11....
"I put a lot of blame on myself,"
Morgan said. "I mean, two points
and three rebounds in 24 minutes:
That's not going to get the job
done. It's a starting point, and I
have to improve, but bad days are

going to happen. At the same
time, though, we weren't going to
win that game even with Andrew,
the way we shot."
Stanford hit only four baskets
in the first half of that game,
thanks both to lousy shooting and
ASU's slowing the tempo. Morgan
took exactly two shots in the
entire game because he hardly
ever saw the ball, and Mont
gomery wasn't too thrilled about
it.
"It doesn't make much sense to
play a guy and then not give him
opportunities to perform," Mont
gomery said. "Jim's got a good
touch — I think he's got pretty
good offensive skills — but he's
got to get a chance to catch the
ball, get a feel for the game.... If
you're going to play guys, you've
got to let them have the ball."
Although Morgan's presence
on the court is the most obvious

change of the post-Vlahov Cardi
nal, there are other differences as
well: Since Vlahov played power
forward and Morgan plays center,
Adam Keefe has moved from cen
ter to forward to give Morgan
room.
And, although the move is the
best thing to happen to Keefe in
quite awhile ("My first reaction
was 'Good! Get me the hell out of
the post!' M Keefe said after Sun
day's game), it also means there
are new players in two positions
for the Cardinal. That means peo
ple have new responsibilities.
"The things we did before are
not going to work now," Mont
gomery said. "We have to find new
ways to get things done, and
that's not going to happen
quickly."
"We're not expected to win now,
so we have to go out and play
harder," Morgan said.

ing when we came out and Drew's
stuff was still in his locker.
"I have the greatest respect for
[Vlahov], that he was able to play
with that much pain," Morgan
said. "I didn't realize how much it
hurt until the Arizona game,

when he said it was the worst pain
he'd ever felt."
Vlahov had surgery yesterday
to remove the spur, and he'll be
fine in eight to 10 weeks. In the
meantime, however, the Cardinal
is going to have to figure out how
to replace the man who led the
team in steals (27) and was second
in scoring (11.3 ppg), rebounding
(6.2 rpg) and assists (3.7 apg).
"We're going to have an adjust
ment period, obviously," Stanford
coach Mike Montgomery said.
"We've practiced this way for
awhile, but Andrew always
showed up for the games. You
knew that against USC he'd guard
(Ronnie) Coleman, against UCLA
he'd take (Don) Mac Lean, he'd
rebound, play good defense. . . .
You knew what you were going to
do. Now, we have to change."
The most visible sign of that
change is Morgan, an understudy
who's spent the last five weeks
getting ready to go onstage. "It's a
little different now," Morgan said.
"There's more pressure in prac
tice to perform, and that involves
acting, like a starter. I can't make
the little mistakes anymore: I've
got to get the ball inside, rebound
more, play better defense. ...
"Back then (before Vlahov
called it quits) it seemed like a
normal rotation when I was on
the floor," Morgan said. "We
rotate the big men, so it was like
he was just out for a few minutes.
Now it's different."
The difference is that now the
other big men are coming in to
give Morgan, and not Vlahov, a
break. Morgan played 24 minutes
in Sunday's 58-47 loss to Arizona
State, but the results of his first
major performance were, we 11....
"I put a lot of blame on myself,"
Morgan said. "I mean, two points
and three rebounds in 24 minutes:
That's not going to get the job
done. It's a starting point, and I
have to improve, but bad days are

going to happen. At the same
time, though, we weren't going to
win that game even with Andrew,
the way we shot."
Stanford hit only four baskets
in the first half of that game,
thanks both to lousy shooting and
ASU's slowing the tempo. Morgan
took exactly two shots in the
entire game because he hardly
ever saw the ball, and Mont
gomery wasn't too thrilled about
it.
"It doesn't make much sense to
play a guy and then not give him
opportunities to perform," Mont
gomery said. "Jim's got a good
touch — I think he's got pretty
good offensive skills — but he's
got to get a chance to catch the
ball, get a feel for the game.... If
you're going to play guys, you've
got to let them have the ball."
Although Morgan's presence
on the court is the most obvious

change of the post-Vlahov Cardi
nal, there are other differences as
well: Since Vlahov played power
forward and Morgan plays center,
Adam Keefe has moved from cen
ter to forward to give Morgan
room.
And, although the move is the
best thing to happen to Keefe in
quite awhile ("My first reaction
was 'Good! Get me the hell out of
the post!' M Keefe said after Sun
day's game), it also means there
are new players in two positions
for the Cardinal. That means peo
ple have new responsibilities.
"The things we did before are
not going to work now," Mont
gomery said. "We have to find new
ways to get things done, and
that's not going to happen
quickly."
"We're not expected to win now,
so we have to go out and play
harder," Morgan said.

After a season of watching as a redshlrt, and half a season playing
a limited role, Jim Morgan stepped Into a starting spot Sunday.
The center will get his second career start tonight against the
Oregon Ducks.
Twelve months ago, Jim Mor
gan was a redshirt center. He
watched Stanford's home basket
ball games from way at the end of
the bench, wore street clothes,
and probably wished he had a bet
ter view of the action.
Six weeks ago, Jim Morgan was
a backup center. He was in uni
form now, and he'd moved up the
bench to sit right in the thick of
things, but he still couldn't see
everything that was going on.
Four days ago, Jim Morgan
started.
The view from the middle of
the paint is just fine, thank you
very much.
Not that Morgan has ever had
much trouble getting a good look
at anything — how hard can it be
for a guy who's 6-foot-ll? — but
still, it's nice to get some quality
time. The only thing that isn't so
great about Morgan starting is
how he got the job: a season-end
ing injury to senior forward
Andrew Vlahov.
The injury — an aggravated
bone spur in the right ankle —
actually happened over a month
ago. The pain was so severe that
Vlahov couldn't practice, but he
was able to grin and bear it during
games. He'd play, rest the ankle
until the next game, pound on it
again, and rest it ... until last
Saturday, when Vlahov decided he
couldn't stand it any more.
"I found out at the walk
through practice (for the Arizona
State game)," said Morgan, who's
been starting in practice for the
last five weeks. "We all had a feel
ing when we came out and Drew's
stuff was still in his locker.
"I have the greatest respect for
[Vlahov], that he was able to play
with that much pain," Morgan
said. "I didn't realize how much it
