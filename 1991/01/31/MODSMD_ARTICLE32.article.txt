# The
						Nostradamus of the nineties leaves his legacy
## 
### 
It's time for me to depart from our
journey through the morally confus
ing and often disturbing parts of our
world of sports. But before I leave you to
the care of more light-hearted colum
nists, I must leave you with my predic
tions of the years to come. Like the vener
able Nostradamus, I intend to be remem
bered as a guy who spewed out a bunch of
ambiguous prophecies which, if inter
preted in just the right way, will eerily
come to life.
So suspend your disbelief and join me
in a wonderful and mysterious explo
ration of the near future
• Bo Jackson will not hit .400 next
season. Okay, so that one was easy.
• The 49ers will win only one game
next year. They've got age problems.
They've got a washed-up quarterback.
They've got all sorts of personnel rifts
tearing apart the team. Players' salaries
are going to be cut.
All right, so I don't believe any of this
either. But I hate the Niners enough that
I'm going to eryoy watching this terrible

minds of the Niner fans. Not only will
they spend the whole off-season lament
ing the failure to three-peat, but they'll
have printed words which speak of their
darkest fear.
• Todd Marinovich will be drafted
by the Los Angeles Raiders. He's an
underclassman without a team, with a lot
of talent, and with a behavioral problem.
The Raiders prefer players with behav
ioral problems. Marinovich has nowhere
to go but up and the Raiders are a half
step higher than prison.
• Jose Canseco will not become
baseball's first 50/50 man. In fact, in
spite of his boasts that he'll be the first
player in history to steal 50 bases and
slam 50 homers in the same season, Jose
will only be the latest in a long line of
baseball 50/50 greats. If the rumors of
Canseco's impending divorce from wife
Esther are true, then "fifty-fifty" will
take on a whole new meaning for the
overpaid A's outfielder.
• Glyn Milburn will win the Heis
man Trophy before he graduates. I
was shocked when, during their coverage

of the Orange Bowl, the NBC broadcast
team labelled Colorado T s flanker/tailback
Mike Pritchard "the Rocket of the West."
Pritchard is a talented football player, but
he's by no stretch of the imagination bet
ter than Milburn.
Aside from being the most talented
offensive player in the Pac-10 (that is, the
most talented who is still enrolled and
hasn't been arrested for the possession of
cocaine), Milburn is also probably the
most talented collegiate player west of the
Mississippi, perhaps with the exception of
Darian Hagan. Milburn will need to play
for a high-publicity team in order to
receive the national attention that he will
need to win over the East Coast and Mid
west Heisman voters. Stanford will be
that team.
After defeating Notre Dame and win
ning their last three games of the season,
this young Cardinal team has shown it
has the heart and talent to win a lot of
games and get a bowl bid. Milburn will see
that it does both.
• The Chicago Cubs and the
Boston Red Sox will square off in a

World Series in the near future.
These two perennial World Series losers
will split the first six games when, before
they can play the deciding nine innings,
Fenway Park will burn down in a
divinely-inspired arson attempt by a
crazed Sox fan who cannot contemplate
facing another Series loss. Then, in an
even more bizarre twist, the same thing
happens at Wrigley Field.
Baseball commissioner Fay Vincent,
saying that the world title must be
decided on the field, will rule that there
will be no megor league champion that
year.
• The Denver Broncos will win the

Super Bowl. Oops. Small typo there. I
meant the Denver Broncos will never win
the Super Bowl.
• Jack El way will coach an NFL
franchise. After a succesful stint as the
head coach of the World League of Amer
ican Football champion Frankfurt team,
the venerable Elway will lead the Tampa
Bay Buccaneers to the second winless sea
son in NFL history.
I just wanted to leave you with these
few thoughts as I slide into the recesses of
your unconscious memory. Perhaps when
one of my prophesies comes true, you'll
remember that morally uptight sports
columnist on your college newspaper.
Then again, maybe you'll just remark to
yourself "What a crazy, gonzo kind of
sports world this is."
I've had fun observing it. Hopefully
you'll continue to have fun.

David Earnest is no longer The Daily's
Thursday sports columnist. He is retiring
to become the sports department's resi
dent cynic.
