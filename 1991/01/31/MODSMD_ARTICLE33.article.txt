# Top-ranked baseball blanks San Francisco State 8-0
## 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
Stanford stranded seven runners in the
first four innings, but didn't need much
offense to dominate light-hitting San Fran
cisco State yesterday at Sunken Diamond.
Powered by five innings of shutout pitch
ing from freshman Willie Adams, the top
ranked Cardinal cruised by the Gators 8-0.
It was Stanford's third win in as many
starts, while Division II San Francisco
State fell to 0-2.
Adams, Aaron Dorlarque and John
Lynch combined to blank the Gators on just
five hits, with the 6-foot-7 Adams picking
up the victory in his first collegiate start.
"It felt great," said Adams, who is in the
hunt for one of three starting spots in the
pitching rotation. "I'd prefer to start and
we have a couple of guys who are hurt right
now. But I'll contribute in any way I can."
Stanford coach Mark Marquess was
pleased with the pitching, which was the
club's biggest question mark coming into
the season. "That was great. I'm very
pleased. Adams threw the ball well and
Dorlarque and Lynch — they all did very
well."
However, Marquess was not at all
pleased with his team's offensive perfor
mance, although Jeffrey Hammonds hit his
second home run of the year and freshman
Matt Bokemeier had two hits, scored twice
and drove in a run in his first collegiate
start at second base.
Stanford left 10 men on base and had
two runners thrown out running the bases.
It wasn't until the eighth inning that the
defending Pacific 10 Conference champions
were able to pull away from the Gators,
scoring three runs on two doubles, a hit
batter and a single.
"I'm not real happy with things offen
sively," said Marauess. "We left a lot of men
on base early and haven't been hitting the

ball all that well."
While Marquess was not impressed with
the team's offensive performance, there
were some encouraging signs. Left fielder
Ryan Turner, who missed five days of prac
tice because of a death in his family,
knocked the cobwebs off his swing, deliver
ing two doubles, two walks and a single in
his five trips to the plate.
Bokemeier, a spidery second baseman
from nearby Sunnyvale also played well
both ways. In his first at bat, he advanced
runners to second and third with a sacrifice
bunt, his "first in a game since his fresh
man year of high school."
Later Bokemeier added a run-scoring
single and a double into the gap, increasing
his stock in a bid for the second base start
ing job. M He hit the ball well and made the
plays in the field," said Marquess.
Senior Chris Kemper, who started in
Stanford's first two games at second base,
has also received accolades from Marquess
for his play at second, and Marquess said
each will get more playing time before a
final decision is made.
Hammonds, making his first appearance
in center field, stole his first base and made
a sensational over-the-shoulder catch. In
the opening series against Santa Clara he
was Stanford's designated hitter to rest a
sore knee.
Stanford scored a single run in the first
inning off Gator starter Pablo Suarez, but
couldn't deliver the knock-out blow to
reach the San Francisco relief corps. Lead
off hitter Steve Solomon doubled to open

In the third inning, center fielder
Hammonds was picked off second
base with Ryan Turner on first
and David Holbrook at the plate.
Stanford finally got results in
the fourth, scoring twice on a
double by Holbrook, a run-scor

field line by first baseman David
McCarty.
In the fifth, Turner doubled,

first complete game since recover
ing from ankle and hamstring
injuries, tallied two hits and

scored a run.
Hammonds ended the seventh
inning stretch by clobbering a
Todd Gerbovaz fastball over the
trees behind the left field wall. He
collected his third hit, second run,
and second and third runs driven
in just one inning later, doubling
to the left-field corner. Then
Turner collected his third hit and
capped the scoring with a single
to right, giving Stanford a com
fortable touchdown plus two
point conversion edge.
Sophomore John Lynch
demonstrated his versatility,
pinch-hitting in the eighth and
then coming in to pitch the ninth.
Lynch allowed a lead-off single,
but retired the next three batters
in order.

Stanford stranded seven runners in the
first four innings, but didn't need much
offense to dominate light-hitting San Fran
cisco State yesterday at Sunken Diamond.
Powered by five innings of shutout pitch
ing from freshman Willie Adams, the top
ranked Cardinal cruised by the Gators 8-0.
It was Stanford's third win in as many
starts, while Division II San Francisco
State fell to 0-2.
Adams, Aaron Dorlarque and John
Lynch combined to blank the Gators on just
five hits, with the 6-foot-7 Adams picking
up the victory in his first collegiate start.
"It felt great," said Adams, who is in the
hunt for one of three starting spots in the
pitching rotation. "I'd prefer to start and
we have a couple of guys who are hurt right
now. But I'll contribute in any way I can."
Stanford coach Mark Marquess was
pleased with the pitching, which was the
club's biggest question mark coming into
the season. "That was great. I'm very
pleased. Adams threw the ball well and
Dorlarque and Lynch — they all did very
well."
However, Marquess was not at all
pleased with his team's offensive perfor
mance, although Jeffrey Hammonds hit his
second home run of the year and freshman
Matt Bokemeier had two hits, scored twice
and drove in a run in his first collegiate
start at second base.
Stanford left 10 men on base and had
two runners thrown out running the bases.
It wasn't until the eighth inning that the
defending Pacific 10 Conference champions
were able to pull away from the Gators,
scoring three runs on two doubles, a hit
batter and a single.
"I'm not real happy with things offen
sively," said Marauess. "We left a lot of men
on base early and haven't been hitting the

ball all that well."
While Marquess was not impressed with
the team's offensive performance, there
were some encouraging signs. Left fielder
Ryan Turner, who missed five days of prac
tice because of a death in his family,
knocked the cobwebs off his swing, deliver
ing two doubles, two walks and a single in
his five trips to the plate.
Bokemeier, a spidery second baseman
from nearby Sunnyvale also played well
both ways. In his first at bat, he advanced
runners to second and third with a sacrifice
bunt, his "first in a game since his fresh
man year of high school."
Later Bokemeier added a run-scoring
single and a double into the gap, increasing
his stock in a bid for the second base start
ing job. M He hit the ball well and made the
plays in the field," said Marquess.
Senior Chris Kemper, who started in
Stanford's first two games at second base,
has also received accolades from Marquess
for his play at second, and Marquess said
each will get more playing time before a
final decision is made.
Hammonds, making his first appearance
in center field, stole his first base and made
a sensational over-the-shoulder catch. In
the opening series against Santa Clara he
was Stanford's designated hitter to rest a
sore knee.
Stanford scored a single run in the first
inning off Gator starter Pablo Suarez, but
couldn't deliver the knock-out blow to
reach the San Francisco relief corps. Lead
off hitter Steve Solomon doubled to open

In the third inning, center fielder

base with Ryan Turner on first
and David Holbrook at the plate.
Stanford finally got results in
the fourth, scoring twice on a
double by Holbrook, a run-scor

McCarty.

Hammonds ended the seventh
inning stretch by clobbering a
Todd Gerbovaz fastball over the
trees behind the left field wall. He
collected his third hit, second run,
and second and third runs driven
in just one inning later, doubling
to the left-field corner. Then
Turner collected his third hit and
capped the scoring with a single
to right, giving Stanford a com
fortable touchdown plus two
point conversion edge.
Sophomore John Lynch
demonstrated his versatility,
pinch-hitting in the eighth and
then coming in to pitch the ninth.
Lynch allowed a lead-off single,
but retired the next three batters
in order.
