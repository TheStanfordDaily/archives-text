# Netters sweep Pacific 9-0
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
If the University of the Pacific figured
that Stanford — minus the services of
Meredith McGrath and Lisa Green —
would be a little bit more vulnerable this
year, they learned yesterday just how wrong
they were.
The Cardinal gave coach Frank Brennan
a nifty present for his 25th wedding
anniversary by routing the Tigers 9-0, los
ing just 12 games in the six singles matches
combined. Stanford is now 3-0 on the sea
son.
"I was impressed with our intensity
today," Brennan said. "UOP is not a bad
team. They are considered the third-best
team in the area." Somewhere ahead of
them would be California and, about a mil
lion light years in front of the Bears, one
can find the mighty Cardinal.
Consider that Debbie Graham did not
play in the match because of a shoulder
injury and then marvel at this stat: No
Stanford player lost more than three games
in her singles match.
Sophomore Heather Willens, slotted at
third singles yesterday, posted a good old
fashion double bagel, 6-0, 6-0, win over
Julie Radder to lead the rout parade.
At No. 2 singles, Teri Whitlinger took
apart Kim Chang 6-1,.6-1. "Teri played a
good match," Brennan said. "She's playing
a lot more aggressively .. . not just doing
the routine from the backcourt.
"She's coming in and trying several new
things. She obviously succeeded today," he
added.
As did everyone else. Senior Sandra

Cardinal 9 ' ,
Tigers 0

Birch beat up on the veteran Lisa Mat
sushima 6-2, 6-1. Freshman Laxmi Poruri
scored a 6-1, 6-2 victory over Lisa O'Keefe.
Junior Kylie Johnson continued her
comeback from an ankle injury with a
smart 6-0, 6-2 win against Tisha Lee. And
Mario Carruth drubbed Kalani Galalo 6-1,
6-1.
• The doubles were, as is often the case
with the Cardinal women, a mere formality.
While Stanford didn't smash the Tigers
quite as soundly as they did in singles, each
Cardinal tandem allowed their Pacific foes
just six games.
Whitlinger and Poruri bested Mat
sushima and Chang 6-4, 6-2; Willens and
Emma Woodhouse took out Lee and
O'Keefe 6-2, 6-4; and the pickup team of
Birch and Johnson recorded a 6-4, 6-2 win
over Radder and Galolo.
"Our team is probably about as ship
shape as they have ever been at this point in
the season," Brennan said in his typically
understated fashion.
Card notes
Stanford's next action is at home tomorrow
at 1:30 p.m. against Washington, a Pacific 10
Conference Northern Division opponent.
The Cardinal has won 68 straight matches
over parts of four seasons.
Graham is expected to play Friday barring
unforseen circumstances, according to Brennan.
