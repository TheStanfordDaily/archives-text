# Ski team still looking for snow
## 
### Michelle Ghert Staff writer 
Winter is the time to take
those skis out of storage and
head for the hills, right?
Wrong. Not this year, any
way. While poor snow conditions
have sent weekend skiers home
in disappointment, the Stanford
alpine ski team has found itself
facing a serious training disad
vantage due to a lack of practice
opportunities on the slopes.
Despite the setback from
Mother Nature, the Cardinal
skied to a second-place women's
overall finish and fourth-place
men's overall finish at the giant
slalom race at Heavenly Valley
this past weekend. The race,
hosted by California, featured
the California-Nevada region's
top collegiate teams, including
Sierra Nevada College and
Nevada.
"Some of the top skiers in the
whole nation were there," cap
tain Pete Blitz said. "We were
racing against skiers recruited
from the Yugoslavian national
team."
The Cardinal women's squad
was led by freshman Ali
Salomon who took eighth, fol
lowed by senior Pam Smul and
sophomore Courtney Haiyes
who took 11th and 12th, respec

tively.
"I was really pleased with
how the race went," Salomon
said. "Especially considering
that it was the first giant slalom
of the season. The race was
really fun."
In the men's competition,
sophomore Jake Doilney took
fifth, junior Brandon Lattin
took 19th and Blitz finished in
20th.
"We had a really slow day,"
Blitz said. "We (the men) should
have all placed in the top 10 or
15."
Coach Cliff Whiteley was
nevertheless pleased with the
Cardinal's performance, taking
into consideration the lack of
training opportunities.
"We're struggling with a dis
adavantage right now," White
ley said. "Our training centers
haven't been open and we
missed out on our annual
Christmas training camp. Our
training has been in sporadic
and short periods."
"We've had to compete
against schools that train every
week, during the week," Blitz
said. "We haven't been able to
train as a team."
The National Collegiate Ski
Association invites two teams
from the California-Nevada
region each year to the national

championships. Stanford has
earned a spot in the national
tournament for the last three
years and hopes to do so again
this year.
"The racing is looking fairly
competitive this year," Blitz
said. "We'll have to do really
well to make it to nationals."
The top two teams will be
chosen at the regional champi
onships that will be held in
three weeks. While the Cardinal
team is optimistic about its
chances to qualify for nationals,
individual members will also
have the opportunity to qualify.
Jake Doilney, the No. 1 Cardinal
men's seed, is considered the
top men's skier in the region.
"Jake has a good shot at qual
ifying individually," Blitz said.
"The women's team also has a
chance." Smul is the top Cardi
nal women's seed, while fresh
men Salomon and Margi Birm
ingham are second and third.
All three have had considerable
previous racing experience.
It may in fact be this type of
experience that has enabled the
Stanford alpine ski team to cope
with this year's poor skiing con
ditions and keep its hopes of
earning a spot at the national
championships alive.
"We're going to keep charg
ing away." Whiteley said.
