# Panel analyzes U.S. foreign policy

In the latest of the series of teach-ins on the war
in the Middle East, several Stanford scholars
attempted to explore a new perspective to the crisis
based on U.S. policy in Latin America.
Before a predominantly graduate student audi
ence in the Rains Houses, the Center for Latin
American Studies arranged a panel of political sci
ence professors and other scholars to link and differ
entiate the U.S. policy in Latin America with that the
war effort in the Gulf.
Political Science Prof. Robert Packenham sup
ported the position of the United States in the Gulf
crisis as "it was not a decision of one person" but
rather the result of five months of diplomacy, 12 U.N.
Security Council resolutions and the support of
Congress.
Packenham said a revolution is occurring in Latin
America in which countries are moving away from
policies of state capitalism to that of conservative
"neo-liberalism" with greater openness of trade and
investment.
"If Saddam Hussein wins, the opposing forces of
these new 'revolutionary' governments (such as
Fidel Castro) will gain strength," Packenham said.
"But if he loses .. . these trends toward a more egal
itarian, democratic, humane societies . . . will con
tinue."
Next, Political Science Prof. Terry Karl said she
acknowledged that most people believe Saddam
must be stopped, but she said the means by which
the United States seeks to halt his aggression
frighten her.
She said the United States continually attempts

to "reconcile its professed qualities of democracy and
humanity â€” myths captured by the Monroe Doc
trine" in its relations with Latin America.
Karl said policies under the Monroe Doctrine
have convinced officials and the people of the United
States that "each case is an exceptional case."
Above all, she said she fears the United States will
overestimate its capability to restore order and
adversely affect the stability of the Middle East.
She compared recent conflicts in Central America
to her fears about the Gulf. "The war against the
Sandinistas and the support of the El Salvadoran
government was in the name of democracy, restoring
economic growth and pacifying Central America,"
she said.
"But now in Central America there exists 200
times more military troops, the economies are in
ruin, and the depth of hatred and social violence is
much deeper" than 10 years ago, she said.
William Ratliff, senior resident fellow at the
Hoover Institution, attempted to nullify compar
isons of U.S. foreign policy in Latin America to that
in the Persian Gulf.
"Criticism [of U.S. foreign policy] in Latin Amer
ica has been ideological and political," Ratliff said.
"This is not true in the Persian Gulf. Both people on
the right and on the left, Arabs and non-Arabs have
crossed over" to support the fight against Saddam.
Political Science Prof. Richard Fagen culminated
the panel's discussion by saying that there exists
"dangerous analogizing" between U.S. policies in
Latin America and those in the Persian Gulf.
Fagen said, "The enemy is an unstrikingly
unattractive individual" and in that sense U.S. for
eign policy is extremely different in Latin America
than that of the Persian Gulf.
