CENTER
for the Performing Arts

The Bay Area is always chock
full of entertainment options, but
Stanford students usually have to
drive from 30 minutes to an hour
to get to them.
No longer will several gallons of
gas be needed to enjoy the Bay
Area's fine arts, as the new Moun
tain View Center for the Perform
ing Arts provides a spectacular
option just down the road apiece.
If you can't get from the Penin
sula to the City for the culture, the
Center will bring the culture from
the City to the Peninsula for you.
Scheduled to host hundreds of
performances annually on three
different stages, the Center kicks
off its inaugural season this Satur
day with a combination of opening
celebration packages featuring
seven artists and ensembles from
California.
Located at the corner of Castro
and Mercy streets, the Center is
part of Mountain View's new Civic
Center complex, part of a broader
scheme renovating Mountain
View's downtown area.
The Performing Arts Center has
three performance stages: Main-
Stage, a 625-seat proscenium
thrust theater which will serve as
the main venue; Second Stage, an
octagonally shaped flexible space
with movable seating for up to 200;
and Park Stage, an outdoor
amphitheater with lawn seating for
300.
The Center is also equipped
with a full-service ticket office, cos
tume and scene shops, and a full
complement of dressing rooms.
Mountain View Performances,

and family events for its spring sea
