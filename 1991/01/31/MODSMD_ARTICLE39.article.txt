Question: How many surrealists
doc 9 it take to screw in a light bulb?
Answer: A fish.
OK, so comedy is not in my future.
Lucky for me, 1 have a career to fall
back on. And lucky for you, you don't
have to come to me if you're looking
for some humor in your life. Instead,
you can go to The Coffee House.
"The Coffee House?" you ques

Coffee House." Well, that may have '
been true at one time, but no more.
Because for the month of February,
Tbesday night is comedy night at The
Coffee House.
"Yeah, right." you exclaim dubi

but you'll probably recognize their faces. Or their
voices.
Feldman, who will be performing on Feb 5., has
appeared on Arts & Entertainment's "Evening at
the Improv," as well as PBS' "Comedy Tonite" and
Showtime's "Comedy Club Network." And if you
want a taste of his caustic barbs before you trek

down to The Coffee House, tune in to his Feldo
Radio Reports on Live 105's morning show.
Babbitt, also a veteran of the comedy scene,
will be at The Coffee House on Feb. 12. She has
been featured on the "Tonight Show" and"The
Late Show with Arsenio Hair and has performed
