Question: How many surrealists
doc 9 it take to screw in a light bulb?
Answer: A fish.
OK, so comedy is not in my future.
Lucky for me, 1 have a career to fall
back on. And lucky for you, you don't
have to come to me if you're looking
for some humor in your life. Instead,
you can go to The Coffee House.
"The Coffee House?" you ques
tion, "I personally think an ASSU
Senate meeting is funnier than The
Coffee House." Well, that may have '
been true at one time, but no more.
Because for the month of February,
Tbesday night is comedy night at The
Coffee House.
"Yeah, right." you exclaim dubi
ously, "They're probably going to
have Gaieties writers come in and
perform 'Skits That Never Were.' Ha
ha. I'll stick to my physics problem
set, thank you very much."
Cynic. Keith Heinzerling, the
music coordinator of The Coffee
House, has lined up (with the help of
San Francisco promoter TYacy For
rester, of Ttafor Productions) two real
life comedians that have actually per
formed somewhere other than Mem
Aud. They are David Feldman and
Karin Babbitt.
And they're funny.
"Feldman and Babbitt?" you say
indignantly, "I've never even heard of
Feldman and Babbitt. How funny can
they be?" Now you're really getting on

my nerves. You may not recognize their names,
but you'll probably recognize their faces. Or their
voices.
Feldman, who will be performing on Feb 5., has
appeared on Arts & Entertainment's "Evening at
the Improv," as well as PBS' "Comedy Tonite" and
Showtime's "Comedy Club Network." And if you
want a taste of his caustic barbs before you trek

down to The Coffee House, tune in to his Feldo
Radio Reports on Live 105's morning show.
Babbitt, also a veteran of the comedy scene,
will be at The Coffee House on Feb. 12. She has
been featured on the "Tonight Show" and"The
Late Show with Arsenio Hair and has performed


her stand-up routine at the Punch
line in San Francisco.
See? These people are for real!
But. . . well. . . urn, I kind of lied.
Some of the other comedians very
well may be Gaieties writers.
Because on Feb. 19, the Certs
Comedy Competition comes to
Stanford. Again.
For the third year, Stanford stu
dents can tell all the jokes they
want (in three minutes) and possi
bly go on to regional and even
national competitions. And you
can go and heckle them. Instead of
bothering me.
The Coffee House has actually
featured big name comedians dur
ing winter quarter for the past cou
ple of years. This year, however,
Heinzerling said, "We decided to
put all of the shows into one
month to make it kind of a
'theme'."

Students interested in entering
the Certs Comedy Competition
should sign up at the Office of Stu
dent Activities on the second floor
of Tresidder.
