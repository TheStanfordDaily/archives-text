# Drought severely cuts water allocation
## 
### Miranda Doyle Staff writer 
Because of lower-than-average rain
fall this year, water rationing already in
effect at Stanford and throughout the
Bay Area may now become even more
severe.
The Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, the
main water source for the University
and much of the Bay Area, is "lower
than it has ever been before," according
to David Kaye, utilities manager for
Operations and Maintenance.
While Stanford is now mandated to
reduce the use of water from Hetch

Hetchy by an amount equal to 25 per
cent of its 1987 consumption, Kaye said
stricter rationing will probably be imple
mented soon.
"We may be asked to reduce use 35
percent or more," he said. He is now
considering various plans to deal with
the drought, including using reclaimed
water for irrigation.
The water level in the reservoir fell
from 536,408 acre-feet in 1987 to
57,900 acre-feet last year. Ann Cheng,
assistant supervisor of the San Fran
cisco Water Department's Water
Rationing Unit, said the situation is
serious.

"Unless in the coming month or two
we have a lot of snow or rain, we are in
a real shortage," she said.
Norman Hui, a public service fore
caster at the National Weather Service,
said chances are slim that there will be
significant rainfall in the Bay Area soon.
"It does not look good," Hui said.
"The forecast is for normal precipitation
or some rain over the next few months,
but it will not be enough to catch up and
alleviate the drought problem."
Cheng said area residents are cur
rently being asked to cut back water use
by 25 percent of the amount used
in 1987. "We are considering fur
ther cutbacks, but we have not
decided exactly how much yet,"
she added.
The San Francisco Water
Department regulates Stanford's
use of water from Hetch Hetchy.
The University has been fined
more than $400,000 over the past
several months for excess use. To
avoid further penalties, Stanford

is now using well water to supply
its residences, dining halls and
academic areas, Kaye said.
Cheng said her department is
supplying 243 million gallons a
day to the Bay Area, compared to
356 million in 1987. She said she
believes water rationing this year
will be severe.
In nearby Marin County,
mandatory rationing is already at
50 percent. The new rule goes
into effect March 1, replacing a 25
percent voluntary conservation
plan.
"Our storage levels are at 35
percent," said Lynn Schneider, a
public information representative

for the Marin Municipal Water
District. "We have had only five
inches of rain so far this year,
when 26 inches is normal for this
time."
Residents who exceed their
allotment of 45 to 55 gallons per
person per day will face a tiered
system of penalties.
Kaye said he believes it is
important to educate students,
faculty and staff about the
drought. "We have to make people
aware that they have to reduce
their water use," he said. "The
current situation will get worse
before it gets better."
