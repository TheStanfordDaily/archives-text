# XTV catches Stanford invasion on celluloid
##

Unless you are really good at picking qual
ity films, you have probably seen a film and
thought you could do better. Well, the folks at
XTV have tried to do just that.
Starting Feb. 4, at 8:30 — that's in the p.m.
— Stanford's very own student "it's like pirate
TV, only legal" television network will begin
airing "Invasion-Stanford: 1991 A.D."
The title invokes thoughts of swarms of
drunken USC fans or, if you are a Young
Republican, the League of Revolutionary
Struggle. However, this four part "comedy
mini-series" chooses to depict the epic adven
ture of two aliens, as in Sigourney Weaver-get
your-gun-type-aliens. Matter of fact, "Inva
sion" could use some Guns-&-Weaver, but I
will get to that later
Over a year of planning and labor went
into this epic production. The writing and
casting of the project began during fall quarter
of last year. With the final running time
approaching two and a half hours, it is safe to
say that this is no run and shoot, goof-off
effort.
The writer/director/producer, Matthew
Brockhoff, conceived of the project durine his
sophomore year. He says that he knew from
the start that he wanted to do a comedy.
"It's easier to pull comedy off with inexpe
rienced actors," says the senior, "rather than
drama."

The seed idea lor the
story came during
phone conversation
with a friend-

Though he envisioned his project as a
satire of Stanford, he "wanted an unusual
idea that no one would think of." The seed
idea for the story came during phone conver
sation with a friend from home. Brockhoff's
friend jokingly suggested that two aliens
should beam down to Stanford. With that in
mind, "Invasion" was off and running.
Actual taping began in late January 1990
and continued for almost every weekend to
the end of spring quarter, and then resumed
until the beginning of December. Even as you
read this (well, maybe not literally) the final
episode of "Invasion" is being edited.
The story concerns the misadventures of
two alien janitors, Milox and Bolux. After the
pair accidentally beam down in the center of
the Quad, they are contacted by two Flo Mo
techies, Ed (Jason Dell) and Ricn (Noel Mau
rdr). The aliens clone tne bodies of two fresh
men so they can blend-in and eventually take
over the world.
Once they take their new identities of Jake

(Rob Wheeler) and Andy (James Grove), they
find a cause to forward, becoming like every
other Stanford student (their words not
mine). Instead of something serious like mas
cot reform or free laser printing at AlRport,
they seek to rid the campus of. . .
... the road reflectors. Huh?
If you are thinking what I was thinking the
first time I read about this, then you are right.
It is dumb, but this is supposed to be a satire.
So the real question is: Is it funny?
lb be honest, I watched the first two
episodes and was amused from time to time.
However, what I found most impressive was
the professional quality of the whole produc
tion. It is obvious tnat an extraordinary
amount of effort went into every aspect of
"Invasion," except for the script.
The sound is clean and smooth. Much of
the music was composed especially for the
mini-series. The credit sequence is well
thought out, though too much like a sit-com.
As far as the acting goes, you have to give
the cast credit for sticking with the project
and taking their material seriously.
The biggest weakness of "Invasion," and
this is particularly fatal for such a long pro
duction, is that it is sloooooow. Most of the
physical action, according to the director,
occurs in one brief bicycle crash segment.
Brockhoff wanted the mini-series to be more
along the lines of a soap opera. In terms of
pacing, he achieves that hands down.
