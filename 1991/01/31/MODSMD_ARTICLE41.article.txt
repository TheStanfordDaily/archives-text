## Stanford, Berkeley theater groups exchange productions over weekend 
### Tim Marklein Editorial staff 
Rivalries tend to create a
love/hate relationship. In Stanford
and UC-Berkeley's case, it means
both schools love to hate each
other.
That doesn't mean there are no
avenues for interaction, however,
as the annual cultural exchanges
during Big Game week prove some
degree of camaraderie exists. Now
it's time for the interaction to hap
pen outside of that week's rivalry
revelry.
In that spirit, Stanford's Ram's
Head Theatrical Society and Berke
ley's Zellerbach Players will
exchange their winter productions
this weekend. Ram's Head will put
on their three Winter One Acts
pieces at Berkeley Friday, while the
Players will perform Martin
Halper's "Tbtal Recall" here
Saturday.
"This has never been done
before," said Players producer
Kevin Coster, a senior who super
vises the group that started in
1987. "There has never been any

cross-exchange between student
groups that I know of."
The Winter One Acts were pre
sented at Stanford two weeks ago
and consist of three one-act plays
written by students Charan Dev
ereaux, Adam Tbbin and Karen
Za cartas.
Berkeley's production of "Tbtal
Recall" — "no relation to the
movie," Coster said — will be
joined by three short plavs by
Tfeatro Califas, a Chicano theater
group at Berkeley that often per
forms in conjunction with the
Zellerbach Players.
"Tbtal Recall" is a two-person
show about the relationship
between a woman and a man who
memorized the entire Bible in the
original Greek, and proceeds to
write sermons for the Church.

The Zellerbach Players will per
form at Ricker Dining Center in
Sterling Quad at 8 p.m. Saturday.
Ram's Head will be at Durham
Studio Theatre at UC-Berkeley at
8 p.m. Friday. For more informa
tion, call Ram's Head at 723-0801.
