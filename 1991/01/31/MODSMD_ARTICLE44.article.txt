## Comic routine falls flat on TV 
### 
I can't remember something with as much
potential as last Wednesday's episode of "Sein
feld" falling so flat.
Other than the Bills, I mean.
Originally titled "The Seinfeld Chronicles/'
Jerry Seinfeld's half-situation comedy, half
stand-up routine television show debuted
impressively almost two years ago and had a
fine run last summer with four new episodes
under the new, and less creative, moniker.
The show returned to NBC last Wednesday
at 9:30 as a winter replacement with the same
cast and format, but from this first offering in
1991, it seems to have lost some of its zest and
humor.
In the show Seinfeld plays himself, including
the fact that he's a stand-up comedian. He's
joined by his real-life friend Julia Louise Dreyfus
who plays Elaine, and other comedian friends
who round out the cast.
Last week's show, which focused on the oft
related topics of dating and cantaloupe, cer
tainly had the classic stories and one liners I
have come to expect from a comedian of Jerry
Seinfeld's caliber
During the situation-comedy part of the
show, which makes up the bulk of the half-hour,
Seinfeld offers up witticisms as if he were still
under the hot lights of the "Late Night with
David Letterman" set.
For example, Seinfeld on keeping books you
have already read:
"You know, when you read 'Moby Dick' the
second time Ahab and the whale become
friends."
Or, on how to break up with someone when
you're afraid to face him or her:
"Do it like a Band-Aid — one motion, right
off."
Other than Seinfeld and the actor who plays
his loopy, cantaloupe-loving neighbor across the
hall, the acting and characters seem fairly weak.
The lack of character depth may be due to the
show's attempt to give Seinfeld the truly great
lines (hell, he's a co-writer) or the difficulty the
writers, directors and producers are having in
creating a sitcom that revolves around one lin
ers rather than integrating them into a larger
story frame with more developed characteriza
tion.
Although last week's debut was slow enough
to reveal some of the show's fundamental flaws,
for the most part "Seinfeld" is a quick, witty and
fun show that's worth the half-hour off from
studying your Psych 1.
I promise.
