# A
						rose by any other name would be a success

Last week, we came across some
really dismal news. A recently
published article in the Chronicle
listed the "Names Most Likely to
Belong to Successful People." Eyes shin
ing in anticipation, we skimmed the list
in search of our own magnificent
monikers. Our hopes for fame, happi
ness and, oh yeah, money were dashed
when we found that neitner "Dan" nor
"Paul" appeared on this roster.
As soon as we located our names on
the "Shoot These Morons on Sight" list,
we resolved to select new names for
ourselves. Only in this way could we
shatter the stigma our parents had pro
vided us with before we even had a
chance to argue about it.
But as fancy and elegant as "Parker"
and "Colby" might be, we wanted
something a bit more . . . unique. We
figured evep if our new names didn't
show up on the Chronicle's Hit Parade,
at least they wouldn't be on their Hit
List.
Names haven't always existed. In the
earliest days of humanity, guttural
grunts and savagely affectionate nudges
were usually enough to specify to whom
one was referring. But then there
became too many human beings to dis
tinguish one solely by grunting and
nudging. So names were developed to
aid in this distinction.
Originally, names were just one word

long because for at least another seven
hundred years after names became nec
essary, there weren't enough people to
warrant the addition of a surname.
Therefore, the first names given to
human beings on the planet were Charo
and Sting.
Almost immediately, however, the
world ran out of one-word names. Last
names were added and later middle
names. By the year 2946, every person
on earth will require eight names to be
uniquely identified. But throughout his
tory, the first name has been and will be
the most important. If you have a slick
last name like "Spencer," it really
doesn't matter if your peers can't say
"Zbigniew" or "Pansv" without dissolv
ing into riotous laughter
Tblevision has been a source of many
unusual names that have nevertheless
been very successful. The problem is
that the stupid names the characters
have are fine in fiction, but they simply
don't work outside of TV.
Imagine this nightmare scenario.
You're riding your bike down Palm
Drive. Suddenly, a facilities van
screams out of nowhere and flattens
you. You're rushed to Cowell with
numerous internal injuries and a frac
tured index finger. The doctor on call
swaggers in to cure you, and through
the hazy blur of pain, you see a kid
whose name badge reads, "Doogie."

Doesn't exactly instill confidence,
does it? But this little pipsqueak is a
successful general practitioner on tele
vision.
Another example: We would have
been severely inhibited in our childhood
development if our parents had wit
lessly named us "Chachi." But on TY
the younger cousin of a womanizing
auto mechanic (named, equally
frivolously, "Fonzie") seems perfectly
well-adjusted and has even managed to
win the heart of the darling daughter of
a local hardware store owner.
THIS WOULD NOT HAPPEN IN
REAL LIFE.
Other names on TV are equally
ridiculous. But with the rapid depletion
of normal names, the Popeye Rocke
fellers and Smurfette Vanderbilts of the
world are not far off. Don't be surprised,
either, if one day you greet Scooby
Grubb and Shaggy Kronenfeld.
Perhaps the weirdest names of all
can be found in the music industry. It is
imponderablv difficult to imagine life
with some of these beauties. Picture the
scene:
You're in a park with your newborn
child, and a nice elderly couple leans
over the stroller admiringly and asks his
name. You hoist the little feller up into
your arms and respond "Meet Vanilla."
The old couple never eats in Baskin-
Robbins again.

Vanilla Ice. Are we really supposed to
take someone named after a popular
non-dairy dessert seriously? (And "Ice
Ice Baby"? Is that also a dessert? A
maternity ward special, no doubt.) But
maybe Vanilla's onto something with
his ice-cream identifier. In anticipation
of a possible massive new trend, we've
got names picked out for our first-born
kids. Jamoca Almond Fudge Kronenfeld
and Quarterback Crunch Grubb will be
the envy of their kindergarten classes.
And, as far as we know, these great
names have the added benefit of being
gender-neutral.
But we mustn't forget that while
Vanilla Ice was still sculpting his plastic


Grubb & Kronenfeld
