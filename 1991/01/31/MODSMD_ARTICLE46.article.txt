# Captain America turns golden
## Defender of the American Dream celebrates his 50th anniversary 
### John Louie Editorial staff 
It's ironic that Marvel Comics'
character Captain America is cele
brating his 50th anniversary at a
time when our nation is at war.
There he stands, on the cover of his
anniversary issue, holding the
American flag before a golden New
York skyline, proudly representing
"Liberty, Justice and the American
dream."
But all of the fanfare and a eye
catching cover by Ron Lim and lim
Lee isn't enough to make this
triple-sized anniversary issue as
exciting as its main character
deserves. "Captain America"
#383, unfortunately, consists of
four separate stories that each
never quite get off the ground. For
all of its hype, it's an anti-climactic

end to one of Marvel's major pub
licity pushes.
What's fortunate, however, is

excellent job revitalizing the shield

This newest issue is far from
the level that the comic has, at
times, achieved, both in artwork
and plot. The first tale has Captain

sequence as he meets other legends
of American history. As implausi
ble as comic book heroes may
already be, this story takes them to
a ridiculous extreme.
The second story involves Cap-

Bucky fighting Nazis during World
War 11. The final two stories con
centrate on featuring supporting
characters, one hero (USAgent)
and one villain (Red Skull). All four
stories carry shallow plots, and
only the first tale has artwork
worth noting.
One would think that Marvel
would do a better job on Captain
America, especially after the recent
improvements in the general qual
ity of the book. Fiftieth anniver
saries deserve better than this.
