Peter Gabriel
Shaking the Tree: Sixteen Golden Greats
Grade: A-
In an age of expensive boxed-set compilation pack
ages, Peter Gabriel's "Shaking The TYee: Sixteen
Golden Greats" is one greatest hits album not to over
look. The eighty-minute album spans the entire 14-
year career of the politically-charged Gabriel, includ
ing his instrumental work on "Passion" and his joint
venture with Youssou N'Doui; as well as one new
track.
Unfortunately, though, "Shaking The Ttee" is get
ting overlooked, but on a more superficial level. Issu
ing a personal statement against the environmentally
unsound compact disc longbox, Gabriel has released
this latest album in only a shrink-wrapped jewel box.
Many record stores have refused to carry the
album, and those that have agreed are finding the lack
of packaging incompatible with their displays. As a
result, Gabriel has sacrificed some sales figures for the
environment â€” definitely a worthy trade.
For those undeterred by the smaller size, "Shaking
The Itee" is definitely a treasure worth finding. From
the opening guitars of "Solsbury Hill" to Kate Bush's
ethereal vocals on "Don't Give Up," the album is filled
with jewels. Gabriel's voice sounds equally excellent
on ballads like "Mercy Street" and "Biko" as well as
quick tracks, like "Shock The Monkey," "Games
Without Frontiers" and "Sledgehammer."
Only Gabriel's second album is unrepresented on
"Shaking The TYee." In addition, "In Your Eyes," from
Gabriel's breakthrough album "So," is conspicuously
absent. This newest compilation includes all five of
the other releases from "So," however.
"Shaking The TVee" is environmentally, musically
and lyrically sound. Good things do come in small
packages.
