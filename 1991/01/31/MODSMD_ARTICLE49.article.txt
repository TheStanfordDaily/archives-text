# Sting breaks out of 'Soul Cages'
## 
### 
The Soul Cages
Sting
Grade: A
When Sting released "... Noth
ing Like the Sun," his third solo
album, the recluse artist surprised
the music industry with a sincerely
thoughtful and deeply personal
album. Filled with powerful
imagery, literary allusions and
haunting ballads, Sting's third solo
album was an obvious change from
Sting's days of youth.
No longer was Sting just the
rambunctious singer of "Don't
Stand So Close lb Me," the
screaming lead in "Synchronicity
II" or the jazzy helmsman of "If
You Love Somebody Set Them
Free." Apparently, the death of his
mother opened the ex-Policeman
up to entirely new levels of matu
rity.
Four years later, after numerous
Amnesty International benefit
concerts, one Broadway play and a
Save-The-Rainforest campaign,
Sting shows signs of even more
maturity. With his new album
"The Soul Cages," a somber, ele
giac work, Sting successfully com
bines orchestral music and poetic
lyrics, masterfully conveying emo
tions while opening his personal
soul.
Like its predecessor; "The Soul

... The Soul Cages' reveals even more of
the accomplished artist. It's remarkable
that a musician ol his stature can continue
to open himsell up to his audiences.

Cages" again finds Sting far from
reconciled over the loss of a parent,
this time his father. But this time,
the forty-year-old artist relies on
flowing imagery rather than
accompanying liner notes to get his
point across.
And from the first song on the
album, "Island of Souls," it's obvi
ous that Sting is still grappling with
death, a recurring theme that
shows itself in"The Wild Wild
Sea" as well as "All This Time," the
album's first single.
Though infectiously happy and
melodic, "All This Time" is as
happy as "The Soul Cages" gets.
"Why Should I Cry For You" and
"When The Angels Fall" typify the
slow pace that accompanies most
of the album's nine tracks. An
instrumental piece halfway
through the album breaks the
solemn mood up, as well as spot
lighting the work of Manu Katch6,
Kenny Kirkland and Branford
Marsalis.

"Mad About You" proves to be
the album's most pipping single,
as Sting emotionally addresses a
love lost. Painting panoramic pic
tures of his soul, Sting uses power
ful imagery and abrupt pauses to
power the Dallad, each line sincere
and sensitive. "And I have never in
my life/Felt more alone than I do
now/Although I claim dominions
over all I see/It means nothing to
me."
Personal emotions are difficult
to convey in private conversations.
But "The Soul Cages" reveals even
more of the accomplished artist.
It's remarkable that a musician of
his stature can continue to open
himself up to his audiences. For
Sting, it may just be more matu
rity, but with this album, one won
ders how much farther he can go.

Cages" tour tomorrow at the
Berkeley Community Theater.
