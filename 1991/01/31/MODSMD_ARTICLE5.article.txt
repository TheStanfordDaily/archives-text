# Analysts foresee diplomatic war
## 
### Mike Laris Staff writer 
The fight for Khafji, the Saudi Arabian town that
was the center of the fiercest ground battle in the
war thus far, has prompted Stanford and Hoover
Institution analysts to try to predict Saddam Hus
sein's next move.
None thought the recent attack was a threat to
the overall military efforts of the Allied forces. Their
predictions range from a diplomatic offensive by Iraq
to missile attacks on Allied ships in the Gulf to an
Iraqi Army coup, but none of them forsees a long
ground war.
"The serious fighting will be done with diplomatic
weapons," said Angelo Codevilla, senior research fel
low at Hoover. "There George Bush does not have
the advantage."
Codevilla said he thinks Saddam has no chance of
changing the military balance in the Gulf. Although
Saddam will continue to try to draw the United
States into a ground war, his primary goal is not mil
itary victory. Codevilla predicted Saddam will allow
his army to be decimated but needs to preserve the
Republican Guard because it keeps him in power
inside Iraq.
When the Guard is in real danger, Codevilla said,
Saddam will attempt to exploit the fact that Bush
has not stated as a specific war aim the elimination
of Hussein himself. Consequently, Codevilla predicts
that the Soviet Union will pressure Bush to stop the
war when Saddam begins to withdraw from Kuwait.
"[Saddaml is figuring to go 15 rounds with the
champ and then to survive," Codevilla said.
Political Science Prof. Scott Sagan predicted other
possible military surprises.
"Tons of surprises potentially can happen," Sagan
said. "None of them is likely, [but] all of them are
possible and would make this [war] more difficult to
prosecute."
Sagan said the United States should be prepared
for the successful use of Iraq's Exocet missiles on an
Allied ship in the Gulf, a major terrorist attack some
where in Europe or the United States, the use of
chemical or nerve gas warheads on missiles, the use
of chemical agents in artillery shells, another envi
ronmental attack or the entrance of Iran into the
conflict.
Sagan said he thinks an extensive ground war can
be avoided if the United States convinces the Iraqi
armed forces to oust Saddam and pull out of Kuwait.
As an incentive, the United States could offer an end
to the war with Iraq's current
borders, he suggested.
"I think it would be very much
in everyone's interest... if there
was a change of regime in Bagh
dad," Sagan said.
Hoover Senior Fellow Bruce
Bueno de Mesquita said he pre
dicts the Iraqi Army will form a
coalition with Shiite Muslims and
the Kurdish minorities to oppose
Saddam and his elite Republican
Guard forces. He suggested the
Iraqi Army would have an incen
tive to do so because Saddam
seems to be treating it as expend

able.
"The (Iraqi) Army has an
opportunity to forge a coalition to
increase its influence at the
expense of the Republican Guard
and Saddam Hussein and his fam
ily. If I can see that, [the Iraqi
army] can see that. And therefore
I expect it to happen."
Bueno de Mesquita said he
made this prediction on the basis
of a computer model used to try to
determine how people and insti
tutions will behave under various
conditions.
The State Department has
used this "Spacial Model," among
other sources, to change its policy
toward conflict in Cambodia, he
said. He added that the model

predicted in 1988 the outcome of
the 1989 Nicaraguan election.
The U.S. government has given
the model a high accuracy rating.
"What people should be pre
pared for is that things are going
to heat up in the next couple
days," he said.
But the fighting between the
Iraqi Army coalition and the divi
sion of Republican Guard in
Baghdad could be brutal, he said.
After a coup, the Army could
begin a massive withdrawal, he
said.
He said that although the
results of a coup would be wel
comed, "That is not to say [the
battle] would happen in a nice,
friendly manner."
