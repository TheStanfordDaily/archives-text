### 
Allco
Mia Farrow, William Hurt
True Woody Allen neuroses. Farrow plays
a mousy housewife In search of her former
(pre-marrlage) self. So she goes to an
acupuncturist. And then decides to have
an affair. If you like Woody, you know It
doesn't matter what his movie Is about, It's
his characters that make It happen.
Hamlet
Me/ Gibson, Glenn Close
When you were reading It In high school,
did you picture Mel Gibson as the lead?
Probably not. But, for some reason, Franco
Zefflrelll did and so It was. Though many
orthodox Shakespeare fans are shuddering
at the sight of scenes being moved from
one act to another, the movie works well.
Hidden Agenda
Francis McDormand, Brian Cox
This film looks at the "troubles" In Northern
Ireland, namely, Its continuous state of war
fare with England. If It had been a great
film, "Hidden Agenda" would have
focused more on the general events In
Northern Ireland, and less on one particular
conspiracy. As It Is, however, the film does a
good Job of conveying the brutal violence
of the country In a realistic manner.
THE FUCKS FIX
Sat: The Hunt tor Red October
Sean Connery, Alec Baldwin
Connery Is such a stud. Even In Russian.
Sun: Ghost
Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore
If, by some slim chance, you missed it
while It played for three or four months at
the Palo Alto Square, you can catch It now.
1990's biggest box-office success.
