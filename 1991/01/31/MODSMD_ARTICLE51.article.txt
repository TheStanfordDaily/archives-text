# 'Flight of the Intruder' crashes and burns

### 
Flight of the Intruder
Brad Johnson, Danny Glover,
Wlllem Dafoe
Grade: D-
Color me reactionary, but right now I
would rather take Stats 60 again than
see a war movie.
Therefore, I think it would be an
understatement to say I have a bias
against "Flight of the Intruder." After
seeing the movie I realize that my bias
was irrelevant. The movie sucks on its
own merit.
Now, I know that the release date for
this film was set before Desert Shield
got a make-over and became Desert

Storm. So it would be brash to charge
Paramount Pictures with opportunism,
but come on, you have to admit the
timing is less than ideal.
All externals aside, "Flight of the
Intruder" is a Vietnam-era version of
"Tbp Gun" loosely based on Stephen
Coonts' bestseller: Director John Milius
tries to go for a good natured, ail-Amer
ican atmosphere. The result is cartoon
ish and hackneyed.
The almost ignored premise of the
film is an unauthorized bombing run
on downtown Hanoi. After losing his
bombardier in combat, Lt. Jake "Cool
Hand" Grafton (Brad Johnson), a pilot
of an A-6 Intruder, decides to make the
war mean something by striking at the

heart of the enemy. He is joined in his
scheme by his replacement bombardier
Lt. Commander Virgil Cole (Willem
Dafoe).
The bomb raid that eventually
occurs proves to be less than over
whelming. Almost as bad is the half
hearted court-martial scene. If the film
had been produced differently these
scenes could have been rfveting.
Instead, they are just the equivalent of
bad network television.
And the special effects are not even
as convincing.
Everything goes from bad to worse
when the movie does not realize it
should end once the court-martial con

eludes. For some unknown reason, a
daytime bombing run and subsequent
rescue scene was tacked on to the end.
It does not help.
As the lead actor, Brad Johnson
comes off better than the rest of the
cast, but that is not saying much.
Danny Glover seems like he is doing a
parody.
However, Willem Dafoe walks away
with the award. What is this? His
fourth Vietnam War related film. Some
body should give him an honorable dis
charge so he will go do something else.
I just hope he does not suddenly
develop an affinity for the desert.
