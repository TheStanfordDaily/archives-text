# Wham! Bam! Don't go see Van Damme!
## 
### 
Lionheart
Jean Claude Van Damme
Grade: C
(see explanation below)
I must admit that I'm a bit of a Jean
Claude Van Damme aficionado.
Yes, ever since the "Battling Belgian"
first blazed across the screen in his fea
ture debut, "No Retreat, No Surrender/'
I just haven't been able to get enough of
those vicious Van Damme spin kicks.
So, when ads started appearing for
his latest film, "Lionheart," I began to
get pretty excited. Granted, the
"Damme Strong! Damme Proud!
Damme Right!" promos don't have
quite the same catchy ring to them as
did the "Wham-Bam, Thank You Van
Damme!" commercials that heralded
Van Damme's last film, "Death War

rant." Still, they were enough to get my
adrenalin pumping.
My anticipation grew when, shortly
before entering the theater, the teenager
behind the popcorn counter eagerly
assured my friends and I that this was a
"kick-ass movie." Much to my disap
pointment, however, his assessement
proved to be dead wrong.
The plot itself really isn't that impor
tant (especially in light of the fact that
Van Damme himself co-wrote the
screenplay). Frankly, I really don't
remember too much of it. It had some
thing to do with secret fighting societies
and evil rich people and Van Damme
grimacing a lot.
Whatever. We're not talking "Citizen
Kane" here. Besides, you're not sup
posed to watch a Van Damme movie for
its storyline — ideally, the "plot" of any

The plot itself really isn't that important
Frankly, I really don't remember too much of it. It
had something to do with evil rich people-

Van Damme film should merely serve
as a tenuous connection between
extensive action scenes.
Unfortunately, "Lionheart" tries a
little too hard to be a real movie, and
Van Damme a little too hard to be a real
actor. Although "Lionheart" does con
tain decent fight sequences, the film
quickly gets bogged down by some
totally useless emotional(!) scenes, in
which Van Damme shows his tender
side to a widow and her young daughter.

Borrrrring.
Ultimately, then, "Lionheart" fails to
deliver, and on the specially modified
Van Damme movie rating scale, it
scores a mediocre C. For some real vin
tage Van Damme action, I recommend
the following titles available on video
cassette: "No Retreat, No Surrender"
and "Bloodsport." Other less entertain
ing Van Damme flicks include
"Cyborg," "Kickboxer," and "Deathwar
rant."
