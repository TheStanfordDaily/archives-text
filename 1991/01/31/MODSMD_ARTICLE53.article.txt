"Warlock" is a bad movie,
mediocre to poor no matter how
you look at it. Get someone else to
pay for your trip to this movie, if
you must go at all. For pointers on
how to get someone else to pay for
large aspects of your life, please see
Aim6e Allison's recent correspon
dence with this very Stanford
Daily.
Just like the ROTC scholarship,
"Warlock" sounds exciting before
you actually get into it. Julian
Sands is a powerful witch trans
ported by Satan from one of the

early American colonies into con
temporary New England suburbia.
Here he must find the pieces of an
ancient tomb and undo all of cre
ation.
Fortunately, a witch hunter is
inexplicably transported with
Julian to prevent this unfortunate
occurrence.
Just as Aim£e must have felt let
down once the war started,, I felt
extremely let down once the movie
started. Her scholarship was no
longer a free ride; similarly, Julian
the witch was simply not pure evil
as UPI had billed him. It really was
a bummer to see "Warlock" change
from a thriller about a demonic
magician into a ton of cheesiness.
It was never compelling, interest
ing or even curious.

Then again, neither is watching
a four-year free ride and two pay
checks after school turn into com
bat service.
I certainly am not as crafty as
Aim6e, however, for I could not get
out of my commitment. I had to
watch the whole movie. I saw
Sands bite a person's tongue out,
carve out someone else's eyes, and
age a Hollywood beauty twentv
years. The worst part is that all
this occurred within the first ten
minutes. The rest was a slow, pre
dictable cliche.
The bottom line, then, is that
although the cost of Aimde's ad in
The Daily was surely much greater
than the cost of my ticket to see
"Warlock," both were pretty darn
cheesy.
