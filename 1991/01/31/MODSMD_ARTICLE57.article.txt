# RESTAURANT REVIEW
## Greens is plain, but it's healthy 
### Marni Rager 
Greens is becoming quite popular. Known as
a chic gathering spot for upwardly mobile vege
tarians in and around San Francisco, Greens is
starting to attract upwardly mobile meat eaters
as well.
But after dining there, I'm not sure why.
The restaurant has two main strengths — the
atmosphere and the view. Greens is right on the
water, it's cozy and it's friendly. But the food?
Eh.
The menu at Greens changes frequently, but
the number of items offered is limited. For appe
tizers, you can have soup or salad. There is a typ
ical dinner salad with the usual ingredients, and
a typical spinach salad with the usual ingredi
ents. (Though it is topped with hot olive oil
dressing, which is a nice touch.) Greens' most
creative salad has romaine lettuce, hearts of
palm, watercress and papaya. Different, but not
that different.
Unlike most of the salads, however, the soups
at Greens are quite unique, such as artichoke
soup with hazelnuts and fresh cream. If the
other selections are anything like this one, I
would say that without a doubt, soup is Greens
forte.
The list of entrees, like that of appetizers, is
limited. However, the choices for main course
dishes are more varied than the salad selection.
The enchilada, with mushrooms, carrots, zuc
chini, cilantro and smoked and cheddar cheeses
sounds better than it tastes. A better pick would
be the grilled brochettes with mushrooms, gar
net yams, peppers, red onions and marinated
tofu, or the vegetable (obviously) pizzas.
Greens' desserts are not phenomenal, so if
you're full at the end of the meal, don't bother
attempting dessert. It's not worth it.
Greens' makes sure to point out that it sup
ports local organic farmers, and maybe this is
what is making the restaurant so popular. I n
my opinion, there isn't anything spectacular
about Greens.
