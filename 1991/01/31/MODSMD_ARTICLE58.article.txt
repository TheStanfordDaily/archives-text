# Students initiate new option for movers, shakers
## 
### Tim Marklein Editorial staff 
Business School students are always
looking for ways to make a buck. Occa
sionally, they come across a venture
that will benefit other students at the
same time.
Chuck Shorter and Kevin Han have
come up with just such a combination
â€” starting a student-run dance club to
give Stanfordians a chance to shake
their "thangs" on their own turf, so to
speak.
Actually, the club will originate at
Club Afrique tonight, and future events
will depend on student interest. "If it's a
success, we will try and run it every
week," Shorter said.

Because of the size of Club Afrique,
and Shorter and Han's desire to avoid
the club atmosphere of venues like the
Edge, Shorter said the place "is not
going to be a club-type atmosphere, but
more of a bar-type atmosphere."
Ttoo students have been hired to col
lect $5 cover charges at the door, and
professional security has been con
tracted to prevent problems.
But most importantly, at least for
those who attend, KZSU's Kevin Mon
tague has been hired to DJ the event.
Montague, a recent Stanford alumnus,
is host of Sunday night's popular Drum
show, a weekly rap and hip-nop festival
which boasts callers from San Jose to
Oakland.

"The DJ is going to have a lot to do
with setting the mood," Shorter said.
The plan for a student-run dance
option began before winter break, when
Shorter and Han discussed various
options for business ventures. "We
wanted to come up with something stu
dents needed, and something we could
provide them," Shorter explained.
Returning from break, the pair
"threw it together in three weeks," lin
ing up all the necessary prerequisites for
running a dance club. "We're not expe
rienced lounge lizards or anything like
that," Shorter explained.
Shorter and Han have arranged to
cover their costs and hopefully make
some money by collecting the $5 cover

charge, while the owner of Club Afrique
keeps all proceeds from drink sales. "It's
not really a big venture because it's on a
small scale," Han said.
Although the two hope the crowd
will consist largely of Stanford students,
they have passed out invitations to peo
ple at San Jose State, as well as several
clubs in San Jose and the Palo Alto area.
"I think the first week, it will be a lot
of Stanford students, but that probably
can't sustain it," Shorter said. "I would
be perfectly happy if Stanford students
alone could support it."
The club, located at 583 O'Connor
in East Palo Alto, opens at 10 p.m. and
will run until people leave,
