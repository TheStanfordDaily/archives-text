# Course teaches 'art of philanthropy'

### Robin Mathison 
A new course at the Graduate
School of Business this quarter is
teaching philanthropy on a practi
cal level, as students are busy dis
tributing $10,000 of donated
funds to local charities.
"Basically, it just dropped into
our lap," said Jim Thompson, a
teaching assistant in the course,
Topics in Philanthropy. He
described the class as "an offer to
allocate $10,000, however the stu
dents want to do it."
The purpose of the course is to
"give students hands-on experi
ence in philanthropy," Thompson
said, since most "will be involved
with fundraising at some time or
another."
The money is distributed after
students in the class submit pro
posals on behalf of charities of
their choice in the Bay Area. "Stu
dents act as an agent for the char
ity," Thompson said.
After examining the proposals,
the students determine the best
way to distribute the money for
maximum effect. The goal is to

create the most "bang per buck,"
said Business School Prof. Gene
Webb, who teaches the course.
Little guidance is provided in the
course, leaving room for creativ
ity, he said.
The idea for the course origi
nated with Bill Summervale, for
mer director of the Peninsula
Community Foundation, which
provides the money for the course.
Summervale said that using funds
supplied by private donors, he
seeks to increase philanthropy by
"bringing young people into the
picture."
Graduate student Ana Thomp
son signed up for the course to
"explore what I can give back,
later on, to the community."
Summervale said, "Anybody
can throw money out the window.
Investing philanthropic funds is a
real challenge." He said he advises
"giving money with an expecta
tion . . . you really want to make
an impact."
Philanthropy "should be signif
icant and fun. ... I feel no guilt
about having fun with this," Sum
mervale said.

Webb developed Summervale's
idea into a simulation-based
course three years ago, but this is
the first time that real money is
being used.
Summervale said he tried to
implement his ideas as an exercise
with 10 undergraduates several
years ago, but the students failed
to allocate the money. That group
of students lacked the self-confi
dence needed to disperse such a
large sum, Summervale said.
The curriculum focuses on the
motivations for philanthropy, tax
laws and the various means in
which charity can be given, Webb
said.
"We should not just give, obvi
ously, to just anyone who comes
around," Webb said. "There are
massive fraudulent efforts," par
ticularly involving religious orga
nizations, he added.
Thompson said he hopes the
course will create a "higher level
of awareness about philanthropy,
since people will be talking about
it."
