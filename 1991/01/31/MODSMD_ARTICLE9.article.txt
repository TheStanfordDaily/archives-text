# ASSU 'dry runs' new phone poll
## 
### David Bianco Editorial staff 
After two years of written and oral
dorm polls that met with varied suc
cess, the ASSU has switched its tactics
for gauging student opinion as it com
pletes its first random phone poll
tonight.
The poll, which is being coordi
nated by the dorm representatives
program, asks students five questions
related to whether the ASSU should
comment on issues that do not
directly affect Stanford students.
Each dorm representative has been
given several pages from the Stanford
Directory, on which every 20th stu
dent is called. The representatives
have spent three days trying to get in
touch with every person they were
assigned to ensure the accuracy of the
poll.
Nearly 800 students will be called
overall.
Twice last year and once during fall
quarter, the ASSU administered
"dorm polls" in which students either
voted as a group or filled out a survey
which was collected and tabulated by
the ASSU. But those polls came under

fire from ASSU leaders and observers
who suggested they were biased or
unfair.
According to sophomore Charles
Hokanson, one of the coordinators of
the poll, "We decided to conduct a
phone poll after discussing the issue
with various people from the Statis
tics Department. ... A phone poll
would be more statistically sound and
more representative of student opin
ion on the campus."
The phone poll will also involve
more graduate students, he added.
Senate Chair Solina Kwan, a junior,
called the poll a "dry run"and said the
ASSU plans to administer another
poll within three weeks, this one
focusing on student services.
She said this poll focused only on
the question of the scope of the ASSU

because the ASSU Senate will vote on
a bill Feb. 5 which would prohibit it
and the Council of Presidents from
speaking on state, national or interna
tional issues that do not directly affect
Stanford students.
Kwan said that although the senate
will not base its vote on that bill solely
on the results of the poll, the
responses will "give us a general sense
of where students are standing or
leaning towards."
Student leaders indicated enthusi
asm over the new phone polling sys
tem.
"I wish it'd be used more in the
future," said senator Mike Curiy, a
sophomore. "It allows the ASSU to
respond more quickly to up-and-com
ing news. Hopefully, it will make it
more like CNN."
