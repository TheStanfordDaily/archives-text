## Allies bomb massive Iraqi armored force 
### 
DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) — Allied
forces cascaded bombs on a 10-mile-long Iraqi
armored column headed into Saudi Arabia and
snatched back a Saudi town from defiant Iraqi
tank troops yesterday, military sources said.
Sporadic fighting resumed early today.
B-52 bombers rained a firestorm of explo
sives on an Iraqi column said to contain as
many as 1,000 vehicles, according to a pool
report by a British reporter with Britain's 4th
Armored Brigade near the Kuwaiti border.
Saudi Gen. Khalid Bin Sultan said his
troops, backed by U.S. Marines, had killed 200
soldiers and captured 350 in driving the Iraqis
out of the town of KhaQi, which they seized
Tuesday night.
Early this morning, fighting flared again in
the town eight miles south of the Kuwaiti bor
der, and military officers said four Iraqi
armored brigades, with several thousand men,
were on the move north of the border.
The B-52s refueled in the air as they
attacked the Iraqis, who were fighting along a
150-mile stretch of the border, the
British pool report said.
It quoted an intelligence report
that at least 100 Iraqi tanks had
been destroyed since Saddam's
forces thrust across the border
Tuesday night. The Pentagon said
a total of 77 tanks and other vehi
cles were destroyed and 167 pris
oners taken.
Reporters in Khafji early today
saw streets lined with Soviet-built
BTR-60 armored personnel carri
ers, smashed and gutted by TOW
missiles, dead Iraqi crews inside.
In Washington, Army Lt. Gen.
Thomas Kelly termed the perfor
mance of Iraqi troops as "pretty
shabby," saying the forces
"achieved nothing other than to
be mauled badly.'
Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak, in an interview in Cairo
with ABC, predicted Iraq would be
driven from Kuwait within a
month.
Iraq said its incursions at
Khafji and other border points
signaled the start of a "thunder
ous storm" on the desert floor
Eleven Marines died in the
Iraqi attacks and a U.S. Special
Operations plane with 14 aboard
was shot down behind Iraqi lines,
U.S. military officials said. Two
other Americans — including a
woman — were missing.
U.S. Marines have reported evi
dence of five or six Iraqi divisions
— at least 60,000 soldiers —
massing near the Kuwaiti town of
Wafra, near the Saudi border.
A U.S. air squadron comman
der, Lt. Col. Dick White, spoke to
pool reporters yesterday of intelli
gence reports that 800 to 1,000
Iraqi vehicles were moving toward
the border. But after returning
from a flight, he said he did not
actually see a large number of
vehicles.

While boasting a big success,
allied military officials played
down the significance of the tank
battle that raged for the better
part of two days in and around
Khafji, on the Persian Gulf coast
below the Kuwaiti border.
"About as significant as a
mosquito on an elephant,"
growled the U.S. commander, U.S.
Army Gen. H. Norman Schwarz
kopf.
There were hints, however,
that the Iraqis might try to draw
more blood from the allied ele

phant — the "evil coalition," as
Iraq terms it.
The battle at Khafji "is a first
warning from the faithful men in
Iraq to all U.S. occupiers that they
will leave with their dead in bags
and coffins," Iraqi radio warned.
An Iraqi newspaper forecast "a
thunderous storm blowing on the
Arab desert."
Iraqi Radio, monitored in Lon
don last night, said Saddam Hus
sein visited the battle front
Wednesday night and remained
there until early yesterday.

The radio said Saddam met
with Defense Minister Saadi
Tumah Abbas and assured him
self of the soundness of the mea
sures and arrangements and of
the "growing morale" of hi»
forces.
Allied aircraft dumped a
firestorm of munitions on Iraq's
top troops in Kuwait, the crack
Republican Guards. Iraq, in turn,
lofted another Scud missile into
the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
Israeli officials said there were no
casualties.
