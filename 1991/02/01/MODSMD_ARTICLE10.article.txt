# Students for America provides voice for the silent conservative
##

The Stanford branch of Students for
America, a new organization which plans
to encourage more discussion of conser
vative issues on campus, was officially
recognized by the University late last
week.
"There's a large conservative contin
gency here. It's just a matter of letting
them know it's politically correct to show
their true feelings, to be conservative,"
said group chair and founder Mark
Weber.
"It's going to be a conservative voice
on campus, one hopefully viewed in the
eyes of the liberals as less militant than
the (Stanford) Review or the (Stanford)

College Republicans," said senior Matt
Kanuck, a Students for America member.
Unlike the College Republicans,
Students for America will focus on issues
and policies and will not endorse candi
dates, organizers said.
Senior Eric Krock said the purpose of
the group is to promote diversity in cam
pus politics. Krock said he believes many
Stanford liberals force their beliefs on
others and refuse to listen to opposing
viewpoints.
But "Students for America will not
become a thought police," he said.
"We do not believe in [ignoring differ
ent perspectives], and in fact, we see our
selves as more mature than that," Krock
said. "We are not going to say one idea is
right and another wrong."

Students for America started in late
October when a representative from the
national organization came to recruit
members at a College Republicans meet
ing. Members of the College Republicans
support the new group.
According to current College Republi
cans President John Abbott, "It's too bad
Students for America wasn't around dur
ing the debates on [Cultures, Ideas and
Values], domestic partners and a feminist
studies requirement."
"A lot of the issues are really promoted
by very vocal groups, and we need a group
to counteract that," he added.
"The conservative voice is quite muted
by ... [Office of Residential Education]
programming, the administration and
the faculty," said senior Keith Rabois,

former president of the College Republi
cans.
The new organization sponsored last
Thursday's rally in White Plaza support
ing the war in the Middle East. Some
members of the group also participated in
a debate on the war Tuesday in Cubber
ley Auditorium.
Kanuck said the rally was not
intended to be political. However, he
added, "Unfortunately, it was not apoliti
cal. Our desire to say 'Let's wish the
troops well' was overshadowed by other
comments."
"We really did not mean for it to be a
protester bashing session, which unfor
tunately is what happened," he said.
In the long run, the group hopes to
foster a stronger conservative voice on

campus through rallies, speeches,
demonstrations and debates, organizers
said.
"Our main goal this year is to get the
club going. We need a serious member
ship and then we'd like to host a speaker J
from Hoover (Institution) or outside,"
Weber said.
He added that Students for America is
not an arch-conservative organization. J
"We want to encourage [people] who view J
themselves as conservative to join," said
Weber. "It's okay not to fit in with the
politically correct image of Stanford Uni
versity. It's okay to be conservative."
Kanuck agreed with Weber, but said
the group is not for "hard-core, cross
burning, hood-wearing conservatives."
