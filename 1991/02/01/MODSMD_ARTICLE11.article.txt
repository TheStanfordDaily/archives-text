# National survey provides statistics, opinions of Stanford freshmen

Stanford freshmen come from compara
ble backgrounds and hold the same views as
their counterparts in other colleges, an
annual survey conducted by the American
Council of Education has found.
Nearly 87 percent of this year's fresh
men responded to questionnaires compiled
by UCLA-based researchers who gathered
statistics about freshmen in colleges and
universities across the nation.
The study provides Stanford administra
tors and research groups answers to ques
tions often asked by parents, alumni and
people within the community, said Sally
Mahoney, acting vice president for student
resources.
"It's the one survey that continues for
many years and is national in scope," she

said.
The University was the first choice for
nine out of 10 Stanford freshmen. Seventy
five percent of them achieved A or A+ high
school averages, compared to 49.4 percent
at similar institutions.
At both Stanford and comparable uni
versities, little more than half the freshmen
come from "mostly white" neighborhoods.
The proportion of white Stanford fresh
men, at 60.5 percent, is lower, however,
than the 78.5 percent average for compara
ble schools.
Nearly one-fifth of freshmen here have
parents with incomes higher than $150,000
or more.
When compared with surveys from the
class of 1984, this year's Stanford freshmen
are not very different in terms of socio-eco
nomic status. However, views about such

issues as the environment, drugs and
health care have changed:
• In 1980, 78.6 percent of the freshmen
said they felt the government was not con
trolling pollution. Today, 92.5 percent feel
the same way;
• The number of respondents who said
marijuana should be legalized decreased
from 40.7 percent to 21.2 percent; and
• More than 65 percent of this year's
freshmen supports a national health plan
as opposed to 40.7 percent in 1980.
Popular career choices remain
unchanged — the top three choices for
Stanford freshmen are medicine, engineer
ing and law.
Over the decade, the political spectrum
has veered toward the middle, with the
number of conservatives decreasing from
27.9 percent to 17.1 percent and the num

ber of liberals staying more or less con
stant, at 38.6 percent in 1991.
The number of students here who con
sider the promotion of racial understanding
"very important" increased by 16 percent.
Nearly 38 percent more of the students
emphasized the need for community action.
The racial breakdowns of the two classes
show that the number of whites has
decreased by 18.5 percentage points since
1980. The Asian-American population has
increased by 15.9 percentage points. The
Mexican-American/Chicano population has
also increased, but the percentage of blacks
and American-Indians has not changed.
Nearly one-fifth of the class of 1984 said
that homosexual relationships should be
prohibited, compared to 12.8 percent of the
class of 1994.

• The number of whites
decreased by 18.5 percent.
The Asian-American popu
lation Increased by 15.9
percent.
• Conservatives decreased
from 27.9 percent of the
class to 17.1 percent, while
the number of liberals
stayed more or less con
stant, at 38.6 percent.
• Respondents who said
marijuc la should be legal
ized decreased from 40.7
percent to 21.2 percent.
• Over 65 percent of this year's
freshmen support a nation
al health plan as opposed
to 40.7 percent In 1980.
