Russian legislature tries to halt police patrols
MOSCOW (AP) — The Russian legislature voted yester
day to ask Mikhail Gorbachev to suspend what it called
unconstitutional and potentially destabilizing plans to
mount joint army and police patrols in Soviet cities as early
as today.
The effect of the vote was impossible to gauge in the
increasingly tense Soviet political atmosphere, but it reflect
ed anxiety among Russia's federation president and other
reformers that hard-liners were preparing to take control.
"Who knows what might happen in the next 24-hours?"
federation president Boris Yeltsin said during debate on the
resolution. The Russian legislature, on a 130-13 vote, asked
Gorbachev to suspend plans for the patrols while the issue
was reviewed by the national Constitutional Surveillance
Committee.
Natural peptide found to suppress AIDS
WASHINGTON (AP) — Glutathione, a natural molecule
that is vital to cells in the body, has been found in test tube
experiments to powerfully suppress the spread of the AIDS
virus, a researcher reported yesterday.
Dr. Alton Meister, co-author of a study to be published
Sunday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sci
ence, said that two forms of glutathione and one of its con
stituent amino acids all showed in laboratory tests that they
can block up to 90 percent of the spread of the AIDS virus.
"The reduction of virus production was proportional to
the amount of (glutathione)," said Meister, chairman of the
department of biochemistry at Cornell University Medical
College in New York. "It is essentially a straightforward
effect. The effect is dose-dependent."
