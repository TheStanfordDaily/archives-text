BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP)
— Croatian leaders warned yes
terday that escalation of its dis
pute with the federal army had
raised anew the specter of civil
war and walked out of a meeting
with regional leaders trying to
smooth out acute differences over
Yugoslavia's future.
Controversy over army med
dling in politics mounted after the
military on Wednesday ordered
the arrest within 24 hours of
Croatian Defense Minister Martin
Spegelj for allegedly plotting an
armed uprising against
Yugoslavia.
Separatist-minded Croatia,
which last week narrowly averted
clashes with the army, refused to
carry out the order.
Franjo Tudjman, president of
non-Communist Croatia, said
upon returning to the republic's
capital of Zagreb late yesterday
that his delegation left the meet
ing "because there were no condi
tions for conducting dialogue."

He told reporters that Croatia
and its pro-independence ally
Slovenia had insisted the military
clarify a document in which it
pledged to try to defend Commu
nism and a federal system in
Yugoslavia.
The Slovenian parliament
demanded the resignation of fed
eral Defense Minister Gen. Veljko
Kadijevic after authorities in the
republic released the army docu
ment.
Tudjman said the two delega
tions insisted on knowing
whether the document also repre
sented the stand of the federal
supreme commander of the armed
forces. K ,m *<»'
The meeting, convened by a
federal presidency made up of six
republic and two provincial lead
ers, was the second aimed at
resolving sharp differences
between regional leaders over the
future of the federation of 24 mil
lion residents.
