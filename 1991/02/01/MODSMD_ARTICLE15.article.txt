BLAGOEVGRAD, Bulgaria (AP) - This
city's 80,000 residents know what the Gulf
conflict and chaos in the Soviet economy mean.
Each day, they face stark shortages of energy
and fooa caused by the outside world's insta
bility. VV)
' A&oss Bulgaria, these shortages have made
this the wprst of all winters since World War
It
Yesterday, residents once again lined up for
hours in sub-zero temperatures to buy bread
and milk â€” the only food on sale here for days.
"Half the people in line can't buy anything
because the shops are even running out of
those two items," said Rosita Borisova, a
mother of two children aged five and 10.
Borisova feeds her children mostly from

stockpiled supplies of white beans and pota
toes. "Greengrocers' and butchers' stores are
just totally empty," she sighed.
All but 2 percent of the goods produced at
Blagoevgrad's 78 factories were destined for
the Soviet Union, which is canceling the
orders, said senior city administrator Alexan
der Balabanov.
In addition, Bulgaria must now pay hard
currency for Soviet energy. The Gulf War took
care of hoped-for supplies from Iraq, which
owes this debt-ridden Balkan nation of 9 mil
lion people an estimated $1.3 billion.
In Plovdiv, the nation's second most popu
lous city, half the 370,000 inhabitants went
without heat for a week in January. Old foe
Turkey eventually rescued the city with emer

gency oil supplies.
In order to win vital help from the Interna
tional Monetary Fund, prices today will more
than double for about 600 basic foods and con
sumer goods.
Bulgaria begged the European Community
this week for $1 billion, saying failure to secure
the money "will certainly prove the last straw
that breaks the back of the Bulgarian reform
process."
Nationwide strikes brought down the gov
ernment of Socialists, or former Communists,
last November. The anti-Communist Union of
Democratic Forces now controls two of the
three key economic ministries in a coalition
headed by an unknown, nonpartisan lawyer
Dimitar Popov.
