## Editor's farewell 
### 
JUST MORE THAN TWO
weeks ago, U.S. and allied war
planes began bombing Bagh
dad in the opening stages of a war
that, for a few days, captivated
America.
The normal cycle of our lives
was suspended those first few days
— protests shut down buildings
and streets, network TV anchors
broadcasted nearly around the
clock, everyone talked of nothing
but the war.
The air was charged with a sense
of urgency; it was a big deal for the
United States to be at war, for the
lives of millions to be at stake, for
the political shape of the Middle
East and the global role of the
United States to be hanging in the
balance.
Now, after just two weeks, it all
seems to be fading.
Yes, there were demonstrations
in San Francisco and Washington
last weekend. Yes, the war still
takes up most of the front page of
most mtyor newspapers each day.
But the big event last weekend
was not a march or protest, it was
the Super Bowl. The teach-ins and
"gatherings" at Stanford have
begun giving way to the first of the
midterms.
Perhaps that shouldn't be sur
prising. After all, this is the second
television war. TV-viewing Ameri
cans expect problems to be created
and solved on 30-minute sitcoms;
we think everything that happened
in the world today can be suffi
ciently explored in a half-hour
news show.
This war is taking an awfully
long time, by TV's standards —
and when a show runs too long,
there is a great temptation to
change the channel.
Even with the television cover
age, the war seems far removed
from what is going on here at
home.
The "news" these days is of mil
itary briefings and Pentagon press
conferences and occasional pool
reports from the scene of action.

We get little sense of what life is
like for troops dug into the Saudi
desert, which claims from both
sides are true and which are false,
how Iraq can still launch missiles
and take over a Saudi town.
For me, that is one of the great
est disappointments of the current
situation. It's been my belief that
good journalism can reduce the
tension created by life's uncertain
ties, that the understanding
afforded by journalism is a key
ingredient in solving the problems
of world society.
Now, at a time when war is
brought live into our homes and
yet we gain so little from the pre
sentation, I'm not so sure.
These end-of-the-volume mes
sages from the editor in chief are
supposed to contain some great
truth, some insightful observation
gleaned from the intense experi
ence of leading this institution.
But I have to admit: I don't have
one for you, at least not on the war.
It is a strange, unsettling time, and
it leaves many of us, I suppose,
dazed and a little blank — the feel
ing you get after watching too
much TV
That said, i should add
that I look with clear eyes on
the accomplishments of this
volume of The Daily.
The last five months have
passed more quickly than any com
parable period of time in my life,
and they have carried their share
of successes and shortfalls.
But in the end, I am left with
immense respect and appreciation
for the efforts of the Volume 198
staff. They built on a great tradi
tion and produced what I immod
estly but wholeheartedly submit is
one of the best college newspapers
in the country.
