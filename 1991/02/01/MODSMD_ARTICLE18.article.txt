Coalition has nipped Saddam's ambitions in the bud

IHAD TO RESPOND after reading
your columns and seeing demonstra
tions. The most vocal so far seem to
view the United States as the villain in
every dispute and as always unjustified
in using force.
Many are paralyzed by the compari
son to Vietnam, but that's faulty. The
closest modern analogue to the Vietnam
War was our 1983 Beirut misadventure,
when our troops were constrained by
straitjacket rules of engagement and did
not have a clearly defined mission. Nei
ther applies now.
I believe the best analogy is that of
World War 11. Lacking foresight, the
Allied peoples were divided, just as now.

The House approved the draft by one
vote months before Pearl Harbor. In the
19305, the elite student members of
Oxford University's Union encouraged
Britain's enemies by resolving that they
would not fight for King and country.
This time around, the U.S.-led coali
tion has nipped a growing threat in the
bud — the opportunity missed in 1936,
when Hitler remilitarized the Rhineland,
and in 1938, when he was allowed to
annex the Czech Sudetenland.
Was it premature to give up on sanc
tions? That's hard to say. However, the
Iraqis could have bitten the bullet for
much longer, since they know Saddam's
response to complaints.

During that time, they could have
consolidated their hold on Kuwait and
added more Iraqi settlers to build a
friendly population. How long could the
diverse members of the coalition have
held together?
Most plausible, to me, is the accusa
tion that we are fighting a hypocritical
war. If Kuwait and Iraq were competing
cashew producers, we would only issue a
reproachful State Department note.
Of course, we're primarily fighting for
oil. Unfortunately, we have to, because
the United States and the world run on
oil. It's terrible and foolish that we
painted ourselves into this corner (we

must form an energy policy), yet it really
is a matter of national survival.
The alternative is to acquiesce while
Saddam acquires the power to damage
the world's economy — like OPEC qua
drupling oil prices in 1973. Also, he
would be vigorously adding to his arsenal
all the while, making a later campaign to
stop him even costlier.
Had the world tried to wait out Sad
dam, it could have been put into Neville
Chamberlain's position in September
1939, when Churchill said to him, "You
had a choice between peace and war. You
chose peace, and now you will have war."
