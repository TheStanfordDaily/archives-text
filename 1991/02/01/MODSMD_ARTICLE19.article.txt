# Suffering of Jews is just as important as that of Muslims

Your Jan. 26 editorial, "The War
Backlash," began with an important
statement. Discrimination against Arab-
Americans, on the rise since the Gulf cri
sis erupted, has no place in our society.
We must be careful to prevent it, quick
to condemn it and committed to counter
it without hesitation.
However, the last remark you made,
that "while Jews are a primary victim (of
Iraqi missiles), Arabs and Muslims have
suffered far more from Saddam's aggres
sion" was inappropriate and harmful to
our community.
First, we must not underestimate the
seriousness of discrimination against and
suffering of Jews. As Israeli citizens face
immediate chemical and conventional
threats, their families in the United
States anxiously suffer for them. Mean
while, as Tikkun editor Michael Lerner
says, many Jews "are deeply disturbed

by the anti-Semitism and Israel-bashing
appearing in the anti-war movement
itself."
Second, and most importantly, such a
remark offensively plays Jews against
Arabs, as though they were competing
for the compassion of the American pub
lic.
Jewish leaders, including the Anti-
Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, have
stood together with their Arab counter
parts in condemning racism and aggres
sion against Arab-Americans. This is not
a competition, and you do a disservice to
both Jews and Arabs by trivializing their
suffering that way.
It is essential to realize this is not a
zero-sum game. Understanding and com
passion toward one group need not
decrease the feelings toward another.
Fighting discrimination is an active
and dynamic process in which we must
be united against all traces of racism.
Attempting to allocate finite amounts
of suffering among different ethnic and
religious minorities will only bring us
back to a mentality of aggressive rivalry.
Suffering is neither finite nor compara
ble. And one group should not be fooled
into believing it has to out-do the other

in order to be worthy of American sym
pathy.
