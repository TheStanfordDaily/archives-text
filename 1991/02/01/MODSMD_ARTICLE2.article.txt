# Queerland aims to add visibility to homosexuals
## 
### Marie Bui Cecilia Tom Staff writers 
"Queerland," a new group of gay, lesbian and
bisexual students, held its first "be-in" last night,
drawing a packed crowd to the Coffee House.
The event was designed to increase homosexual
and bisexual visibility on campus in an environment
in which heterosexual students could also partici
pate, organizers said.
As people who donned pink triangles continued to
stream in, members of Queerland found their pur
poses fulfilled.
The group was founded to promote social events,
coalition-building and multicultural awareness,
according to member Ann Seaton, a lesbian first
year graduate student. She said that the organiza
tion seeks to complement the resources of the
Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Community Center and
that its formation does not indicate a split in the
homosexual and bisexual community.
The group hopes to reclaim and redefine the word
"queer" in a positive way because some homosexuals
and bisexuals are uncomfortable with that term, said
event organizer Sairus Patel, a senior.
Patel said the "be-in" was not planned to be a
spectator event because heterosexuals and closet
homosexuals could all participate simply by being
there.
Seniors Gemot Huber and Sholom Surges, a het
erosexual couple, said they came to the Coffee House
to see all their gay and lesbian friends. "They're the
most interesting people," Huber said.
He added he would like to see more events like
last night's until people accept homosexuality as
commonplace.
Tom Boellstorff, a gay senior who helped publicize
the gathering, said he was pleased with the turnout.
He then demonstrated an act of affection by pinch
ing the nose of a male friend.
Jane Hsiao, a senior who happened to be studying
computer science at the Coffee House, said she
approves of the gathering, having recently learned
that a good friend of hers is gay.
"If it makes the gay community
feel better," there should be more
such events, she said.
Patel said fliers and posters
advertising the event have
already raised people's aware
ness. He added that he received
some negative reactions to two
types of fliers he distributed. Both

featured controversial pictures
such as two nude men wrapped in
an American flag, one holding a
condom.
In a school where heterosexu
als have notoriously stunted dat
ing habits, homosexuals and
bisexuals kiss "with shameless
and un-Stanford like abandon,"
one flier reads.
"The only same-sex erotica on
this campus is these posters, and
that's too much for people," Patel
said. There are hundreds of het

ero-erotic books and films avail
able in the libraries and book
store, he added.
Patel said Queerland was not
an organization as much as an
impulse, adding that some homo
sexuals are bored with the
activism on campus, which has
focused on the domestic partners
conflict for the past two years.
Queerland can provide a
chance to do something fun for
once, he added.
