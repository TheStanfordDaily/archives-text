# Nuclear threats, oil prices not good reasons for war

### 
So we should go to war to keep Sad
dam from developing nuclear weapons
that could be used on Americans. I'm
under the impression that the United
States has sufficient nuclear weaponry to
annihilate the human race at least a cou
ple times over. Is this a problem? Are
American lives inherently more valuable
than all others?
So we should go to war to keep oil
prices down. For what ends? Recently at
the rally in Palo Alto no less than 75 per
cent of the cars driving in front of city
hall were occupied by only one person.
Would that be the case if gas were twice
as expensive? Three times? Five times?
So we should go to war because
Kuwaiti women are being raped and

Kuwaiti children are dying. Does anyone
remember the wreath of yellow ribbons
in White Plaza last quarter? What is the
infant mortality rate in the United
States again?
Sorry, I'm not convinced.
