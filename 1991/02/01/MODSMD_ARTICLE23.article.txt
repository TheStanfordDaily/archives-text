## Not so Ecce, Homo 
### 
I'M SORRY KIDS, BUT I'm afraid it's
true. Researchers prep Bob Costas
before the show.
And besides, this is my last article. So I
figured I'd use it to answer some of the
questions that are often asked of me:
Why I Look Like A Greek God
Actually, this is usually phrased, "Yo,
Stein, what's the deal with the goofy hair
cut?" I've grown so tired of this question
that I've developed a slew of sharp-witted,
nay, razor-edged responses. Such as,
"Bite me, ya weasel."
Now, the reason I wear my hair "low,"
as the hipsters like to say, is not, as some
have postulated, an attempt to cover an
embarrassing tattoo of Linus Pauling on
my neck. Nor is it because of a personal
conviction that if you're going to bother
shampooing and conditioning, you'd
damn well better get the most out of it.
The reason my hair looks like a reject
from a Soviet mop factawy iS'lwwed in the
roots of ontology, epistemology and Bon-
Joviology. It concerns the basic human
need for self-expression. A need which I
believe is so important that I'm willing to
go around looking stupid.
Why I Write Such Good Articles
Actually, this question is more com
monly phrased, "Why do you spend so
much time on that little 'Bug' thing you
do for Release?" Well, that's a complex
question, the answer to which encom
passes much more than the pastel green
"I was a Daily Columnist" T-shirt.
You see, I'm 19 years old. My sexual
prime is over, and I've got time to kill.

So, like all aging men, I looked for a
hobby. I thought about the Axe Commit
tee, but they're just too scary. I thought
about crew â€” Yeah, right. As if.
I decided to spend my extra time writ
ing, only because I talk too fast. I consid
ered writing for Release, but felt my cre
ativity would be stifled by about my
eighth pizza review. I also considered
Aurora, but could never seem to get the
words "oppressed" and "hymen" in the
same sentence as "CVBF." (I didn't want
to work blue, dammit, but you kids force
me.)
So I joined The Daily, not only to meet
the lovely and talented David Bianco, but
to find out what OATQ means (Once
Around the Quad is just what we tell peo
ple, it's actually some obscure, yet despi
cably raunchy joke about the obscure, yet
peaceful, Middle Eastern country Qatar).
But for a more philosophical explana
tion of why I volunteered to write a three
page paper every week for nothing but
your petty amusement, I'm afraid you'll
need an in-depth understanding of the
effects of alcohol and the phrase,
"Wouldn't it be zany.. However, the a
posteriori rationale I've invented conve
niently ties in with the theme of this arti
cle: You got to express yourself. Hey, hey,
hey, hey.
That's why I drag Glenn (my personal
photographer and horse groomer) to the
most dangerous and best lit locales on
campus. For without self-expression, we
would all look, sound, and act like John
Davidson.
But that's all over now, and The Daily
is throwing me into the cold like some

half-chewed maraschino cherry, with as
much thanks as that nameless black
Peanuts character. (Yeah, I know it's
Franklin, but I had to get my one multi
cultural statement in, and I'm running
out of time.)
"So," you might ask in your numbed,
lifeless state of ennui, "what's Joel gonna
be doin' with his time now?"
Unfortunately, it'll be another four
months before Alyssa Milano turns legal,
so I'm thinking about running for the
Council of Presidents.
"But why?" you ask in utter ignorance
and confusion.
I could make up lies about big salaries
and resum6 packing, but why beat around
the bush.
You see, somebody's got to loosen this
place up.
After all, we're capable of choosing
which classes to take without the aid of
28 distribution requirements. And we can
control ourselves without restricting our
first amendment rights (Fighting words?
What are these? Zowee? Kabamm?).
So, this April, you just might find me
shaking babies and kissing Pro-Fros.
"This town needs an enema."

Don't worry kids. Joel Stein wouldn't
really leave you. His column can now be
found conveniently located in the Inter
mission section of Thursday's Daily.
