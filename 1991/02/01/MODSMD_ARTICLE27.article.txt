# How I pulled an all-nighter
## 
### Ken Wharton Staff writer 
Knowing that the war will be over in six more
weeks if the groundhog sees his shadow tomorrow,
I'm sure that everyone on campus nowadays is
focusing solely on their schoolwork. Not.
In fact, ever since this war started, doing problem
sets and writing papers about people who have been
dead for hundreds of years seems kind of unimpor
tant in the vast scheme of things.
As a direct result, I've stated to notice people pro
crastinating more and more, allowing their work to
build up to massive proportions, leading directly to
what we in the business refer to as an all-nighter.
To better explain this, I have performed painstak
ing research to piece together a likely scenario of
how this could happen to anyone.

Thursday, Jan. 18, 9:47 a.m.:
You're sitting in the back of class, having an
intense, whispered argument over whether it is bet
ter to crumple or fold toilet paper, when in the back
ground the prof, assigns a paper due a week from
Monday. Your subconscious mind actually hears this,
and files it under "Things to do Later," along with
the idea you had in October to clean out your fridge.
You decide crumplers are obviously superior.
Saturday, Jan. 26, 11:23 p.m.:
You wander around the party, trying to determine
which direction people with full drinks were coming
from, when half of a Kahlua milkshake is spilled on
your thigh.
"Sorry, dude ... Hey, I know you! Have you
started your paper yet?"
Your mind whirls. What paper? What class?
"It's OK, I haven't either!", your random class
mate continues. "I just finished the book today! Oh
— gotta run!"
You wonder what book you forgot to read. You
wonder if you should turn in early. You wonder who
that guy was.
Sunday, Jan. 27, 3:15 a.m.:
You finish planting the stolen "For Sale" signs in
front of Branner. As you stumble home, part of your
brain reminds you of your paper. Unwillingly, you set
you alarm for 9:00.
Sunday, Jan. 27, 9:01 a.m.:
Your alarm clock dies a sudden and violent death.

2:13 p.m.: By now, you're ready to start working,
but with only an hour until the Super Bowl, you
know there's really no point. You play Tetris.
7:04 p.m.: You crack the book for the first time
and scan the pages for a good thesis. Eventually, you
narrow the important part of the book down to a 50-
page section, which you begin to read, underlining
impressive-looking quotes that you know will take
up the majority of space in your paper.
Monday, Jan. 28, 12:52 a.m.:
You ask yourself if you could still get an extension,
but then realize you don't even know your TA's
name. As you seat yourself in front of the Mac, you
calculate that you only have to write a page an hour.
No problem.
4:50 a.m.: You're feeling incoherent.
Somehow, your sleep-deprived brain manages to
convince you that you would get a lot more done if
you took a quick nap. Big mistake.
7:04 a.m.: You awake with a huge napjerk, stare
at the clock, and begin to utter those same uncre
ative phrases that seem to accompany most of the
world's great bonehead maneuvers. But. at least it
gets the adrenaline flowing.
9:50 a.m.: You stumble breathlessly into class
just as everyone is getting up to leave.
"Hi there!", says the guy you "met" at the party.
"Aren't you glad that we got an extension until
Wednesday? I would have been up all night!"

Knowing that the war will be over in six more
weeks if the groundhog sees his shadow tomorrow,
I'm sure that everyone on campus nowadays is
focusing solely on their schoolwork. Not.
