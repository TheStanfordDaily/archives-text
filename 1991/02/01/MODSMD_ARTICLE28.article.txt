# Dear Bug: Is this business about 'cow tipping' real? Or is it bull?

### Amy Gillett Staff writer 
Dear Bug,
As a concerned parent and an animal
rights activist, I am concerned about the
practice of "cow tipping." Does this really
occur, or is it a just a modern-day myth
that has made its way west from Iowa?
Please enlighten me!

Unfortunately for cows, cow-tipping is
not just a myth. Fortunately for your chil
dren, chances are a mere .00001 percent
that they will have a cow land on them as
a result of a cow-tipping incident within
the next six months.
In a typical procedure, cow-tippers
steal upon their livestock victim late at
night. They pass over sheep, pigs and an
occasional supine student who has also
come to the field to tip but has passed out
before he has had a chance to hit. Then
BINGO — the tippers find their target!
They push the sleeping cow onto its side.

A thundering "MOOO" results from
the action, which can be translated into
English as "If I catch you, you are ham
burger meats and your tongue is part of
my deli sandwich." With this ominous
MOOO, the tippers run away as fast as
their flanks and rumps can carry them.
The cows, startled by their sudden
sideways position, take a couple of min
utes to recover themselves and to plot
their revenge. Unless the cow has had a

According to Cindy Rodriguez, a
reporter from the University of Connecti

dition on her campus. She said that last
fall several arrests were made for cow tip
ping.

After several beers, the Connecticut
students are inclined to interpret the dis

The tippings usually take place on the
weekends, when students of the pastoral

Cow-tipping is not a Stanford phe
