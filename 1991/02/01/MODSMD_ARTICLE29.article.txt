## Career nights for Morgan and Wingate — Card wins 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
Take three magic words, two
career-best scoring performances
and one pile of rebounds, add 'em
all together, and you've probably
got a formula for success.
The Stanford men's basketball
team sure did last night against
the Oregon Ducks, staging a beau
tifully-executed second-half show
to run away with an 86-75 win.

Men's Basketball

Cardinal 86

Ducks 75

The Cardinal win moves Stan
ford into seventh place in the
Pacific 10 Conference with a 4-5
record (11-8 overall), while Ore
gon falls into a three-way tie for
eighth at 3-5 (8-10). For those of
you keeping score at home, the
difference between second and
eighth place in the Pac-10 right
now is exactly two games.
The two career-high efforts last
night came from forward Deshon
Wingate and center Jim Morgan,
who scored 23 and 13 points,
respectively. The rebounds came
mostly from Wingate (who tied his
career high with 14) and Adam
Keefe (who tied his career best
with 15, to go along with 22
points). The Cardinal had a sea
son-high 50 rebounds in the game
— 21 more than the Donalds.
Even with the board domi
nance, the scoring-fest (Kenny
Ammann's 17 gave the Cardinal
four starters in double figures)
and the career nights (Hey! We've
got 20 bucks for anyone who can

come up with a synonym for
"career"!), it was the three magic
words that made most of the dif
ference last night for Stanford.
The words came at halftime, and
they came from coach Mike Mont
gomery:
Man to man.
Stanford had played a 3-2, a 2-
3, a sort-of diamond-and-one (let's
just say it didn't work out so well)
and several other amorphous
zones in the first 20 minutes of
the game, and the result was that
the Ducks were up 35-31 at the
half. The zones were meant to
stop guard Terrell Brandon (27.4

ppg) from scoring, and they did
just that — he had only six at
intermission — but they couldn't
stop Terrell's backcourt mate
Kevin Mixon, who had 15 first
half points.
"We figured Brandon would be
a problem, but we'd be able to con
trol everyone else," Montgomery
said. "It turned out we did OK on
Brandon, but we couldn't locate
Mixon." (It shouldn't have been
too hard to locate him, because he
spent most of the game lighting it
up from outside — Mixon ended
up with 27 points, 15 on threes).
The major problem with the

zones wasn't Mixon, however —
the problem was what the zones
were doing to Stanford. The Car
dinal plays zone once every other
blue moon (if you missed it last
night, the next one's in *93), and it
showed.
Indecision on defense led to
indecision on offense, and that led
to 34 percent shooting — and a lot
of ugliness — in the first half.
Without its astronomical 31
rebounds (18 at the offensive end)
in the first half, the Cardinal
would have been in trouble.
"We could not execute, the ball
wouldn't go down, people weren't

in the right places," Montgomery
said. "It's scary, because you start
to worry about what you're going
to d 0.... When we get indecisive,
we tend to do nothing."
Stanford decided to scrap the
zone at halftime, and none too
soon. "It seemed like everything
we tried to do in the first half
didn't work," Montgomery said.
"We started in man in the second
half just to see if we'd get more
aggressive."
Bingo. After a short hook from
Morgan got Stanford within two,

They surprised the pundits, that's for sure. Many people thought that last weekend's three losses — losing games to both Arizona teams
and losing Andrew Vlahov for the season — would devastate Stanford's men's basketball team. But the Cardinal obviously have a different
attitude: when you're down, you've got to get up.
Wingate took that aggressiveness
and used it to take over the game:
An 18-footer ties it at 35. A shot
from the line two minutes later
puts the Cardinal up two. A tip-in
60 seconds later grabs the lead for
good. Fifteen seconds later, a give
and-go layup off a sweet pass from
Keefe makes it 43-39. A drive
along the baseline leads to a dunk
y tivc^point edge.
And, finally, after Oregon
decides t<i press, Wingate puts the
exclamation point on his out

burst: John Patrick ends up with
the ball a good 30 feet from the
hoop, the Duck zone shifts out a
bit. . . and leaves Wingate all alone
in the left corner.
Big mistake. Huge. Patrick
rockets a pass toward the hoop,
and Wingate flies in to throw it
down. Pandemonium.
The slam puts the Cardinal up
by seven, and, after a three from
Mixon cuts it to four, a patented
Keefe fake-one-way-go-up-the
other layup and a trey and two
free throws from Ammann put

no closer than six the rest of the
way.
"Needless to say, that's a

tremendous relief to me," said
Montgomery, who kept the
starters in for the final 20 min
utes of the game. "To come out in
the second half and score 55, to
play the way we know we can. . ..
We moved better, we shot better,
and we looked like the team we're
capable of being."
"Getting out of the zone made
us more aggressive," said Patrick,
who had seven of his nine points
in the second half. "I'm not sure if
it carried over to our offense, but I
do know it made me more com
fortable."
It must have been contagious:
Ammann scored 15 of his 17 after
halftime, and Morgan nine of his

13. Patrick had seven of his
career-high-tying nine assists in
the second half. Keefe had all six
of his career-high six assists after
intermission.
Several of Keefe's assists were
to Morgan (including a slick
behind-the-back bounce pass for a
slam with one second left in the
game), who finally got involved in
the offense. "After Sunday's per
formance I really needed to play
well," Morgan said. "It was just
there — everything clicked."
"That's just what we needed,"
Keefe said. "Jim didn't do any
thing spectacular, for him — he
does it every day in practice."
Still, it was kind of a surprise

— especially to Duck forward Bob
Fife, who guarded Morgan at
times. "He was more confident
than I expected," Fife said. "He
took their first couple of shots and
I thought 'Wow, I didn't think he
was going to do that.' "
