# SLAC layoffs infuriate union leaders

### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
In response to federal budget cuts,
directors of the Stanford Linear Accel
erator Center announced Wednesday
the layoff of 66 workers, spurring
charges from the United Stanford
Workers that the laboratory is "engag
ing in union-busting."
Because of across-the-board cuts at
the Department of Energy, which
funds SLAC, the center's budget was
reduced by $10 million dollars this
year. The budget cuts were spread
through several different divisions,
including the electronics department.
Of the laid-off workers, 30 were

union members in five different
departments, said Ruben Serna, a
USW field representative. He charged
that the laboratory has continued to
hire temporary contract workers dur
ing the last few months even though
the impending layoffs were announced
in late November.
As evidence, he cited a recent SLAC
newsletter "which welcomed all the
new employees."
"SLAC is using the [budget] cuts as
an excuse to go after the union," Serna
said.
But personnel director Lee Lyon
denied his claim. "There are no con
tract workers in the departments
where layoffs have occurred," he said.

Ron Lynch, a purchasing agent who
handles contracts with outside agen
cies, also said he didn't know of any
contract workers that have been hired
in the last few months. "All I've seen is
temporaries walking out the door," he
said.
Laid-off workers were told of the
layoffs in a meeting with their depart
ment heads and Alonzo Ashley, a Uni
versity employee relations representa
tive. The workers received 30 days'
notice.
Although neither Lyon nor Serna
could give an exact figure, they agreed
the electronics department was hard
est hit. Serna said other affected divi
sions include controls, mechanical

engineering, mechanical fabrication
and klystron. The klystron depart
ment uses radio frequency tubes to
help accelerate electrons.
According to Serna, the layoffs also
eliminated some managers, supervi
sors and engineers. He said some
union workers will exercise their con
tractual right to "bump" other union
workers with less seniority at SLAC.
Workers with more than four years'
seniority cannot be bumped.
Serna said he anticipates another
wave of layoffs in six months. How
ever, Lyon said the laboratory is not
expecting more. "But we always have
