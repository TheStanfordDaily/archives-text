# Bokemeier steps up to bat

### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
Unassuming freshman Matt Bokemeier has
made a smooth transition to college baseball, now
he's just as quietly trying to slip into Stanford's
starting lineup.
The baby-faced infielder could be expected to
settle peacefully onto the dugout pine for his first
year, but his early-season play indicates Boke
meier will be more than a silent observer in 1991.
"I got pretty geared up for my first game, it was
really exciting, but kind of hard to describe," said
Bokemeier, who had two hits, a sacrifice bunt,
drove in a run and scored twice in his collegiate
debut Wednesday. More importantly to coach
Mark Marquess, Bokemeier played flawless
defense, helping the top-ranked Cardinal to an 8-
0 victory over San Francisco State.
Heading into a three-game series at No. 30
Fullerton State, Bokemeier is running a very
close second in what was once a three-horse race
for the second base job. Senior Chris Kemper had
the edge after fall practice and started the first
two games, while freshman Jeff DesJardins
appears relegated to a back-up infield and pinch
runner role in 1991. Kemper and Bokemeier
won't have longer than the start of Pacific 10 Con

ference play, Feb. 22, to duke it out for the start
ing job.
"I'd like to settle in on a lineup eventually, but
right now I want to prepare them both so they can
do the best they can," said Marquess, who has
been openly pleased with the efforts of both Boke
meier and Kemper.
"Bokemeier hit the ball well (against San Fran
cisco), and they both played good defense. But as
I told Kemper, he hasn't done anything wrong,
and he's going to be back in the lineup," Marquess
said.
Marquess said Tuesday that he would start
Kemper today against Fullerton, but that
Bokemeier would see more time in the Cardinal
infield in the non-conference preseason. Boke
meier will be a reserve at shortstop and third
base, in addition to his time at second base.
"I'm getting my chances, and I think if I keep
playing like I did today (against San Francisco
State) I'll have a good shot (to start)," said Boke
meier, who also had two hits in the alumni exhibi
tion Jan. 19. "But I have to keep my head about
it."
A sinewy 6-1, 170-pounds, Bokemeier came to
Stanford as a highly-touted infielder from nearby
