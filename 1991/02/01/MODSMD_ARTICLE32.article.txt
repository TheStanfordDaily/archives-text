# Netters take on Washington
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Ideally, an early-season sched
ule would consist of three or four
progressively more difficult
matches. Each would challenge a
team just a bit more than the last
to help prepare the squad for the
long difficult season that follows.
The world, of course, is far
from ideal. That helps explain
why Washington is visiting the
Stanford Tennis Stadium today
instead of Utah, which came to
town a week ago. The Utes nearly
shocked UCLA and gave the Car
dinal a good fight.
The Husky women, on the
other hand, are so lightly regarded
that Stanford will play without
three of its top four today, and
coach Frank Brennan is not
overly concerned.
Junior Debbie Graham contin
ues to nurse an iruured shoulder,
senior Sandra Birch has a class to
attend and sophomore Heather
Willens is apparently not 100 per
cent, according to Brennan.
With that trio sidelined, a few
fresh faces will get an opportunity
to step into the lineup and strut
their stuff. Hailing from Danville,

Calif., freshman Emma Wood
house has thus far only seen
action in doubles with her partner
Willens. Today, she gets to step
into the singles lineup.
So does Boulder, Colo, native
Kelly Fisher. (It is at this moment
where even some of the most
knowledgeable tennis fans are
saying, "Kelly who?"). Fisher, a
junior, is the newest member of
the Cardinal team.
During her freshman and
sophomore years, she tried out for

the team but didn't make it. At
the end of last year. Fisher noticed
that Valerie Wilson, Lisa Green
and Meredith McGrath were all
leaving and only Woodhouse and
Laxmi Poruri were coming in to
replace them.
She asked Brennan if there
might be an opportunity to make
the team this time around and he
responded affirmatively. Sure
enough, Fisher found the third
time to be the charm and will step
onto the court this afternoon for
her first-ever intercollegiate
action.
Assuming the singles go
according to plan, Fisher will
team with Woodhouse in doubles.
The other Cardinal tandems are
expected to be Teri Whitlinger and
Poruri at No. 1 and Kylie Johnson
and Mario Carruth at No. 2.
Card notes
This ia Stanford's last dual match
until Feb. 15, when San Diego State
comes to town. Five Cardinal players,
Birch, Graham, Whitlinger, Willens
and Poruri will head to Minneapolis
next week for the Rolex National
Indoor Tournament â€” one of the four
legs of the the Intercollegiate Tennis
Coaches Association Grand Slam.
