# Wingate finally plays up to par
## 
### Robert Pardington Senior staff writer 
After the game, Oregon Coach
Don Monson still mistakenly
called him "David Wingate," but
Stanford's Deshon Wingate
gained some respect and notoriety
among all who watched last
night's 23-point, 14-rebound
monster performance in a win
over the visiting Ducks.
The 23 points were a career
high for the senior forward. The
14 rebounds tied Wingate's career
best. Fourteen of Wingate's points
came in the second half — 12 of
those in the first seven minutes
after halftime and eight of them
on slam dunks.
In one four-and-a-half-minute
span, Wingate scored 10 of Stan
ford's 14 points — two jumpers, a
tip-in, a lay-up and a dunk — and
the Cardinal went from being
down by two points to being up by
five. It was the biggest momen
tum swing in the game.
The name of Wingate's game
was authority. He took it to the
hoop strong again and again, get
ting points on dunks, driving lay
ups and tip-ins. On the game,
Deshon shot 11-for-15 from the
floor.
"With the changes in the line
up, I tried to take it upon myself
to be mere aggressive on offense,"
Wingate said.
On the season, Wingate was
fifth on the team in scoring with a
9.1 ppg average and third in
rebounding, grabbing exactly six
per game. He was leading the Car
dinal in blocks with 12.
But everyone, including
Wingate, sensed that he was not
performing up to expectations. He
would often practice like an All-
American, then turn in only aver
age performances in games. In
that respect, this game was a
breakthrough for Wingate.
"I played like I know I can
really play today," Wingate said. "I
played like I do every day in prac
tice."
Wingate's play surprised Mon
son. He hadn't prepared his team
to stop a suddenly-aggressive and
offensively dangerous Wingate.
"I just give Wingate credit for
the game he played," Monson
said. "I don't know how he could
drive baseline against the zone."
Stanford Coach Mike Mont
gomery praised his starting for
ward for instigating some team
momentum at the beginning of
the second half.

"He sure did a nice job of get
ting the big plays," Montgomery
said. "He was just real active. .. .
He seemed to be reed focused.
"Wingate's 23 and 14 [points
and rebounds] was probably the
best performance he's had since
he's been at Stanford."
There were hints that Wingate
was ready to explode last night.
He was pumped up before the
game, point guard John Patrick
said, and he was trying to light a
fire under his teammates.
"Emotionally. . . before the
game, Deshon was getting every
body going, and it carried over to
the court," Patrick said.

Asked why he came out so
inspired, especially in the second
half, Wingate pointed to the fact
that he was just frustrated from
losing so much.
"I didn't want to lose," Wingate
said. "Being down by four at half
was bad enough. I was just tired of
losing."
Montgomery was obviously
also pleased to break a three-game
losing streak. Big games from
Wingate and Jim Morgan, who got
an impressive 13 points and seven
rebounds, were a positive sign
that people are stepping in to fill
the gnp left by Andrew Vlahov.
Still, Wingate is holding off on

any celebration until he has
games like the one last night con
sistently, and the team wins a few
more contests.
"I really want to play like this
for the next nine games," Wingate
said. "Then I'll feel good."
