# MacMurdo returning to form
## 
### David Hirning Senior staff writer 
Last week, the Cardinal
women's basketball team went to
Arizona. While it was there,
backup forward Chris MacMurdo
derided that she would get some
rebounds. She came back Sunday
with 25 of them and the distinct
possibility of erasing that word
"backup" from the spot xn front of
her name.
Hard to believe that just two
years ago, MacMurdo didn't know
if she would ever put on the Cardi
nal uniform again.
Like many on the Stanford
team, MacMurdo was All-Every
thing in high school, and schools
like Penn State (currently ranked
No. 2) and Virginia (currently No.
1) recruited her. Always competi
tive, MacMurdo chose Stanford
because it offered the biggest chal
lenge.
"I knew the program was really
building to a good level," Mac-
Murdo said, "and the school was
No. 1, at least in my area (human
biology). I was looking at the
whole package."
MacMurdo would be getting a
great education for free, and the
Cardinal would be getting a six
footer who could run and jump
and had averaged better than 26
points and 11 rebounds a game
her senior year at South Aiken
High School. Everyone was happy.
Then, the bottom fell out.
During fall practice and the
first few games of her freshman
year two years ago, MacMurdo felt
some tingling in her leg and knew
something was wrong. Something
was very wrong. A doctor diag
nosed her as suffering from two
herniated disks in her back, and
recommended surgery that would
only give her a 20 percent chance
of playing again.
A doctor from MacMurdo's
hometown echoed the diagnosis,
and told her that she should really
consider giving up the game she
loves.
"We were both in tears in my
office," recalled coach Tara Van-
Derveer about the time. "I told
her we would find another doc
tor."
They eventually found the doc
tor that had operated on Joe Mon
tana's herniated disks. MacMurdo
had the surgery, was redshirted,
and spent the rest of the year and
the following summer rehabilitat
ing. She still wasn't sure if she
could come back, or how compara

ble her play would be to her for
mer level.
"It really affected my confi
dence coming into Stanford,"
MacMurdo said. "I was riding
high, working out, and excited...
it was a real blow."
She came back "a little rusty"
last season, and played just 9.4
minutes per game on a team that
won the whole thing. Even as the
team won, it was doubly hard for
MacMurdo to sit on the bench,
wondering if she would end up
just another washed-up high
school All-American.
"More than anything, I just

had to get my mental state better,
to know that I could play at this
level," MacMurdo said.
But at the year's end, Stan
ford's resident small forward Katy
Steding took her superlative game
and went off to play in Japan. As a
third-year sophomore, MacMurdo
would finally be getting her
chance.
Or would she? After three early
season starts, MacMurdo was
replaced in the lineup by sopho

be regaining her superb playing abilities.
scoring, and MacMurdo often
passed up her shot. An inside
player in high school, she is still
adjusting to the wing. Going into
the Arizona trip, MacMurdo was
averaging 5.4 points and 4.7
rebounds per game.
"Vial's our leading rebounder
and we need her in there," Van-
Derveer said. "Chris is playing
better than she did when she
started."
VanDerveer enjoys the luxury
of having MacMurdo on the
bench, because she is an excellent
athlete who can play big guard or
either forward spot. "I like bring
ing people off the bench," Van-
Derveer said. "I like to be able to
make and adjustment. . . and
Chris can go in at basically any
position."
While MacMurdo would love to
start, she is happy where she is
now, too. "I'm pretty confident
with the position I'm in," Mac-
Murdo said. "I can ease into the
flow [from the bench]. As long as
I'm contributing."
Which she did last weekend,
turning in a performance against
Arizona (16 rebounds) that hasn't
been seen in five years. Not since

her freshman year has a Cardinal
pulled in so many rebounds. Two
nights later, she had nine against
Arizona State.
H s Chris MacMurdo finally
arrived? Possibly. "-If I put my
mind to it, I can do some rebound
ing," she said. "I'm finally finding
out what I can contribute to the
team. We have scorers and ball
handlers, but we could use some
rebounding."
MacMurdo, a "miracle of mod
ern medicine" by her own
account, could be just what the
doctor ordered.
