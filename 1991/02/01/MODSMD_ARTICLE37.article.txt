# Chico challenges Card wrestlers
## 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
After two straight blowout
victories, the Stanford
wrestling team should be in for
a closer match on Saturday,
when it faces Chico State in
Chico, Calif.
While the two schools
haven't met in a dual match
yet this season, wrestlers from
the squads have faced each
other several times in tourna
ment competition. According
to Stanford coach Chris Hor
pel, the Wildcats have held a
slight advantage in these
meets.
"We've already wrestled and
lost to them in four weight
classes this season," said the
coach. "In addition, two other
guys who didn't actually face
Chico have finished lower than
them in tournaments."
However, the Cardinal
should be wrestling at or near
full strength on Saturday.
Sophomore Phil Nowick, a 118-
pounder, has been fighting ill
ness for the past week and is
the only question mark. Now
ick, 7-9-0 on the season, has
shown great improvement in
his last few dual meets, and his
absence could be a problem for
Stanford.
Nowick's backup, freshman
Ramy Saad, has only four var
sity matches under his belt.
However, Saad impressed Hor
pel in splitting his four
matches at the All-California
Invitational last weekend and
will be ready to go if Nowick is
out.
In addition, 158-pound
junior Matt Topham (4-4-0 on

Buddie's career has
been marked by
consistent excel
lence.

the season), who has been
fighting a shoulder ir\jury for
the bulk of the year, should be
back in action Staurday night.
As usual, Stanford's co-cap
tains, Steve Yarbrough and
Steve Buddie, are the favorites
at 177 and 167 pounds, respec
tively. Yarbrough (23-4-0) did
not wrestle in the All-Cals
because of illness. However, the
senior is near 100 percent
health and should have no
problems.
The Chico match means a
bit more for Buddie. The All-
American will be shooting for
his 102 nd career Stanford vic
tory, breaking the record that
he currently holds with former
great Scott Wiggen (1983-87).
Buddie's career has been
marked by consistent excel
lence. The senior has won at
least 20 matches in each of his
four years at Stanford, and he
is currently ranked sixth in the
country in his weight class.
Horpel never expected any
different from Buddie. "There
was never any question that he
was a truly excellent wrestler,
and he's gotten key victories
for us every year. He's a rarity."
Other Cardinal wrestlers
who are expected to perform
well are Jay Jackson (13-11-0),
a 126-pound freshman, Lance
Johnson (13-7-0), a 134-pound
freshman.
