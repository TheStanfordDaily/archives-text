# Men face tough opener against Irvine
## 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
The Stanford men's tennis team has been
busy playing tournaments since school began
in the fall, but this weekend's match-ups with
UC-lrvine and the University of San Diego
mark the start of the official 1991 season for
the pre-season No. 1 Cardinal, and head coach
Dick Gould is excited to begin playing dual
matches.
"The guys are eager to play," Gould said.
"These are good matches for us; we are playing
teams that have given us trouble in the past."
The Cardinal opens on Saturday against
Irvine, a school that has a good history as
Stanford's first opponent. The Anteaters came
to the Stanford Tennis Stadium two years ago
as the season opener, and the match ended
under the lights as the Cardinal prevailed in
the third set of the last doubles match.
Though Irvine comes into Saturday's match
ranked 14th in the pre-season poll, 1989 has
not been forgotten.
"I don't know much about Irvine this year,
but I do remember how well they played
against us two years ago," junior All-American
Alex O'Brien said. "Irvine has a young team,
but they are always tough. They are a good
team to start against."
Stanford has been playing challenge
matches all week to determine this weekend's
line-up. With last year's No.l seed Jonathon

Stark out with a stress fracture in his foot,
Pacific 10 Conference Indoor Champion
O'Brien has taken over the first spot with Ail-
American and NCAA semifinalist Jared
Palmer playing as the second seed.
Glenn Solomon is slated as the third seed
and All-American Jason Yee will play fourth,
health permitting. Both Yee and Solomon have
been bothered with colds of late and could sit
out. Freshmen fill out the rest of the order
with Vimal Patel at No. 5 and either Micheal
Flanagan or Chris Cocotos at No. 6.
Doubles duties will be handled by Yee and
O'Brien at No. 1, Palmer and Dan Turbow at
No. 2 and Flanagan and Cocotos at No. 3.
With only three dual matches before the
USTA/ITCA National Indoor Championships,
Gould is looking forward to getting his
younger players used to playing in the team
format.
"The most impportant thing for us right is
the national team indoors," Gould said. "A lot
of the younger players are not used to the col

lege dual match format, and it is important to
get the young guys into matches."
Arriving on The Farm as top-ranked
juniors, Patel, Flanagan and Cocotos will be
watched closely as they begin their collegiate
careers, but the real excitement of the week'
end should come from the veteran O'Brien.
After playing as the team's No. 3 seed for
most of last year, O'Brien opens the season as
Stanford's top player and will be playing
against Irvine's and San Diego's only return
ing nationally ranked players. Ranked 22nd in
the latest Volvo Intercollegiate poll, O'Brien
should face Irvine's 32nd ranked Brett
Hansem-Dent on Saturday and 4th-ranked
Jose-Luis Noriega on Sunday. An experienced
international player, Peruvian Noriega is the
talented leader of a team that lost its No. 2,
No. 3 and No. 4 seeds to graduation.
"[Noriega] is fundamentally one of the best
players in college tennis," Gould said. "He is a
very good back-court player and runs well. He
and Alex have very similar games."
Though O'Brien plays down his match with
Noriega, the Amarillo, Tx.-native is ready for
the challenge.
"He is a great player; I'll have to put a lot of
pressure on him at the net to win," O'Brien
said. "I hope the team wins though. A team
win is better than any individual victory."
With this weekend marking the start of a
long season, O'Brien's teammates share the
desire for victory.
