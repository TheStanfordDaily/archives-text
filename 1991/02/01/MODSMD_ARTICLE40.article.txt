# Gymnasts to fight battle of three armies
## 
### Noah Blake Staff writer 
After two consecutive victories over out
matched opponents at Burnham Pavilion, the
Stanford men's gymnastics team must travel
to Tempe, Ariz, this weekend to compete in
what should be a very close meet that could be
won by any of three different teams.
True, four teams will compete in Tempe on
Friday night, but one of those teams is UC-
Santa Barbara, which Stanford crushed two
weeks ago in Burnham. As coach Sadao
Hamada puts it, "they [UCSB] are about 10
points behind us, so we don't have to worry
about it."
Stanford will have to worry, however, about
both New Mexico and host Arizona State. The

home team has a proud tradition of gymnastic
excellence, as Hamada reveals: "ASU has been
in the top ten just about eveiy year, and they
even won the NCAA championships in 1987,
and they are very, very strong."
As for New Mexico, "they've had their ups
and downs, but this year their team seems to
be very good. ... They beat us three weeks
ago, by about two points. So this contest will
be a very tough one."
One might expect that the large, rowdy
crowd that will no doubt pack the stands in
Tempe would give ASU a slight advantage in
this extremely close, three-team battle. But
Hamada believes that crowds are irrelevant.
"I feel there are no excuses, unless there is
really bad equipment, for [gymnasts] not being
able to hit their routines and come up with a

good result. It's all based on how they train,
how they prepare for the competition, and how
they execute in the meet. Crowds have nothing
to do with it in my opinion."
Hamada hopes the team will perform well,
even though he has larger goals in mind. "If
it's possible, without changing the overall
training schedule, which I gear towards the
Pac-10 and NCAA Championships, I'd defi
nitely like to come home with a victory."
Although Friday's contest in the Valley of
the Sun may be the greatest test for the Cardi
nal to date, Hamada sees it as just another
piece of the puzzle. "The guys have started
doing better routines, and I can expect a little
more consistency, even though we are not
really close to 80 percent yet. But I definitely
think [our] progress is coming along."
