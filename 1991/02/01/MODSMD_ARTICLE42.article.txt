# Uh oh, she's magic!
## Sensational freshman Summer, Summer Sanders turns swimming world upside down 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
When she was four years old, Summer
Sanders watched her older brother swim at a
local pool.
"He looked like he was having a lot of fun,"
she said, "so I decided to have fun too. At first,
when I got in I was scared and just stayed by
the wall, but when we had our first meet I just
put on this stone face and decided to just do it.
It was a 6-and-under meet, and I got third!"
Fourteen years later, Sanders is still keep
ing pretty fast company. And she's still having
fun too.
Now 18, she is a freshman on the second
ranked Stanford squad which meets No. 4
USC today and No. 5 UCLA tomorrow at
deGuerre Pool. "It's fun," she says of swim
ming for the Cardinal.
But Sanders is not just another Stanford
swimmer; she's considered to be one of the
world's finest. And all that came one night last
July when Sanders was competing at the
Goodwill Games . . . but wasn't having much
fun.
To the swimming cognoscenti, Sanders was
known as an up-and-comer but she had yet to
make a mtyor impact. Five months earlier she
had won two events at the U.S. Short Course
Nationals to qualify for the Goodwills.
And there, in her first race of the meet, she
squared off against Janet Evans in the 400-
meter individual medley. Janet Evans, the
1988 Olympic gold medalist in that event.
Janet Evans, who hadn't lost a 400-meter IM
in three years. Janet Evans, America's sweet
heart.
"I was really nervous for the 400 IM,"
Sanders says, "but then I said, 'I do this all the
time in workout. What's the difference? It's
just two laps of each stroke.'"
She opened up a lead on the butterfly leg,
maintained it through the backstroke,
extended it on the breaststroke and held on
through the freestyle. Her time was nine sec
onds faster than she had ever swum before,
and she had a gold medal. Needless to say, the

fun-loving youngster from Roseville, Calif.,
looks back on this race with fond memories.
Or maybe not. In response to a question at
the U.S. Open last December, she replied, "I
hate three things: quiche, brussel sprouts and
the 400 IM." And that hasn't changed.
"The 400 IM is moving up a little bit," she
says, "taking over the quiche and the brussel
sprouts, I think. I totally hate that race.
"It hurts so bad. I can't describe it. I've
never felt anything that hurts so bad.... I
don't know why I don't stop when it hurts.
Maybe somewhere deep, deep down inside, like
my gall bladder or something, I like it a little.
Honestly, I don't know why I do it."
But whether or not she actually enjoyed the
four and a half minutes she spent in the water
during the race, she couldn't help but approve
of the result. The victory over Evans, in one of
Evans' best events, on national television,
made Sanders a star. But she still had two
more races to swim.
"After that happened it was really hard for
me to keep my cool," she says."I was really

excited but then I went home and thought,
'one down, two to go.' I focused on my other
races. . . . After that I knew I couldn't relive
that over and over. It wouldn't help me in the
200 IM."
Sanders went on to win both the 200-meter
IM and the 200-meter butterfly at the Games
and says, understatedly, "It was probably one
of the better meets I've had." She left Seattle
to go to Austin, Texas, for the U.S. Long
Course Championships, but made the mistake
of stopping briefly at home.
"The media was pretty hard when I came
home," she says."I came home for a day and a
half, and that was a disaster. As soon as I got
off the plane I already had commitments. I was
dead tired. I tried to see everybody."
But things died down soon thereafter.
Sanders qualified for the U.S. contingent trav
eling to the World Championships and went to
begin her studies at the Farm. Then, three
weeks ago, she won a gold, a silver and a
bronze at the Worlds meet in Perth, Australia.
Now, however, there are no more interna
tional competitions, and Sanders is just swim
ming for the Cardinal. After competing at the
highest level, it may seem that collegiate
swimming would be anticlimactic, but not for
Sanders.
"To be on such a high-caliber team — it's
great because everyone's pushing you hard,"
she says. "That's where it helps — where they
push you. I just keep thinking how amazing it
is that I'm working out with such a super
group of swimmers. Of all the great swimmers
I've competed against, people that good are all
here in the same pool."
In addition to Evans, senior Michelle
Griglione, sophomore Janel Jorgensen and
freshman Pam Minthorn are all world-class
swimmers in Sanders' best events. While
Sanders won all three of her events in Stan
ford's dual meet last Friday, she still sees great
competition every day. Plus, swimming for a
team provides other advantages.
"I'm excited for NCAAs," she says. "Our

team is so spirited and so close,

couldn't have made it if I didn't
have people cheering for me. I
was going to faint, throw up, I

she has only been training all-out
for two years? "I really, really

she says. "We really want that

"Then after that, I don't know.
I have too many things to think
about. ... I just keep working as
hard as I can. I sure want it to pay
off."
