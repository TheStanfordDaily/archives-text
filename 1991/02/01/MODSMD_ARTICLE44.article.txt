# Freshman Mayfield already looking to NCAAs
## 
### Amy Wusterbarth Staff writer 
At age ten, doctors told Tyler
Mayfield he could no longer play
contact sports because of a broken
bone cyst in his leg. Rather than
sit around the house he took up
swimming. Eight years later, he
was one of the hottest recruits in
the nation. As a high school Ail-
American, his incoming time in
the 100-yard breaststroke was
faster than any other on Stan
ford's 89-90 team and good for
second all-time at Stanford.
"I was just a little punk in the
water," Mayfield said with a smile,
"After a few years, I started enjoy

ing it. You get a first place here, a
best time there, get the ball
rolling."
Coming to college has not kept
the freshman from hitting strikes.
Although he was worried about
balancing gruelling workouts with
rigorous academics, Mayfield has
stayed on target both in the pool
and out. "It's actually easier
because the discipline that I've
had to have in swimming makes it
easier to do the schoolwork."
Self-discipline has been a key
factor in Mayfield's success. The
Las Vegas native swam for a club
where he was one of only two
seniors last year.
"Its gone from me pretty much

training by myself and always
having to push myself to stepping
in here where there are 20 guys
who are just as good if not better
all on the same level pushing one
another set after set, workout
after workout. It gets kind of bru
tal."
The high intensity of collegiate
workouts and extra weight train
ing made Mayfield nervous
because he thought he might be
too tired to perform well. But he
surprised himself and impressed
coaches from the very beginning.
Assistant coach Ted Knapp
noted a day in early fall quarter
where Mayfield did a drill in two
seconds less than they had asked

him to, swimming faster than
some guys had in races last year.
"Right away he showed the ability
to compete in races and train
well."
Mayfield's work ethic and men
tal discipline also shine through in
competition. In a tough Michigan
meet a few weeks ago, he had two
minutes to prepare to race in the
200 breast, which he usually
doesn't swim in dual meets.
He was not daunted by the fact
that he was in a lane between the
world record holder and Amer
ica's top 100 ..breaststroker.
According to Knapp, "Tyler had a
great, great swim" and even cut
two seconds off his time from the
previous meet in Texas.
"I accepted at it as a challenge,
and just said okay, I'm going to get
up there and race them."
Being surrounded by world
class swimmers in practice as well
as in meets hasn't intimidated
Mayfield. "Yeah, we've got a lot of
world champions, and a lot of peo
ple ranked up in the top 10 in the
world in this and that, but I don't
think that if you stepped up on the
pool deck you'd know who that is
just by their attitude. Everyone's
real mellow about that type of
thing.
"We've got a big team theory,
its always for the good of the
team. If you're performing well
it's going to benefit the team, and
that's what it's all about."
Mayfield will definitely be help
ing the team this year. He hopes to
place first in the 200 breaststroke
in the five remaining dual meets.
"We're looking for Tyler to be a
big contributor in relays and
breast," said Knapp, "He'll defi
nitely be an NCAA finalist this
year. In four years he can be an
NCAA Champion in probably two
events."
Mayfield has a time goal for

NCAA's, but he's not sure if it will
place him in the top three. He
plans to just "take it as it comes."
This easy-going attitude has
been with Mayfield from the
beginning. "I just got into it for
the fun of it. My parents have
been really supportive. They're
kind of naive about it,"he says
with a chuckle, "They're inter
ested as anything but they don't
remember times and stuff."
So Mayfield keeps working and
winning and having fun. And
what's in the future? "Well, it's
like, there's no professional swim
ming, so what I'm going to end up
doing is having a real life," he
laughs.
Rowdy Gaines, a multiple gold
medalist in the 1984 Olympics,
coached Mayfield in Las Vegas.
"He always told me that he
believed you had to give back
something to swimming that you
took from it.
"A lot will depend on what the
end of swimming is for me — if I'll
just step out and apply what I've
learned from swimming to life, or
if I'll step out with a couple gold
medals and be able to use some of
the glory and that type of thing."
Olympics in 1992 and 1996 are
his ultimate goals along with a
few gold medals and world records
thrown in, but like always, he'll
take things as they come. "That's
shooting high but I like to talk
about it, not in a cocky way but in
an ambitious way," said an any
thing-but-arrogant Mayfield.
