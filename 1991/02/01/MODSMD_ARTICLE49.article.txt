# Blood banks overflow with potential donors

### Anita Presser Staff writer 
In an attempt to contribute to
the war effort in the Middle East,
donors have swamped the Stan
ford Blood Bank and other local
blood collection centers.
In fact, the supply of blood is
large enough that for tha first
time in recent history, potential
donors are being asked to wait
until more blood is needed.
Rhoda Burns, assistant admin
istrator of the Stanford Blood
Bank, said while donations last
month greatly exceeded usual lev
els, the extra supply won't be
wasted. "Blood is a precious com
modity, and we are very careful
not to overcollect," she said.
According to Burns, the num
ber of donors has increased by up
to 40 percent since Jan. 15. "We
don't want people to feel that we
don't need their donations â€” we
still have to keep up a daily sup
ply," she added. Currently, more
blood is needed locally than by sol
diers in the Gulf.
If additional blood is needed in
the Persian Gulf, local blood dona

tion centers will send it to the
Middle East through a national
network.
The Peninsula Blood Bank in
Burlingame has also seen an
increased number of donors, said
assistant administrator June Lee.
"We are keeping a close tab on
our inventory," she said. "We have
an adequate supply so we are ask
ing donors to make appoint
ments" before they come.
Sylvia Remerez, spokesperson
for the Irwin Memorial Blood
Center in San Francisco, said
donations there doubled at the
onset of the war but have slowed
recently.
"Helping the military is just
one part of where the blood goes,"
she said. The center distributes
blood to 40 hospitals in eight
counties.
People who have signed up to
donate blood at Stanford are
advised to keep their appoint
ments, despite the adequate sup
ply. Others who want to donate
blood should call first and leave
their names and phone numbers
so they can be contacted when
donations are needed.
