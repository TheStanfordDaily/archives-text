# Female POWs reported
## U.S. may look again at women's role in war 
### Mike Laris Staff writer 
Reports that the first U.S. servicewoman
may have been captured by Iraqi forces may
shatter the illusion that American women are
not involved in combat and change public
opinion about the war, several Stanford com
munity members said yesterday.
"Women are likely to be casualties of this
war," said History Prof. Albert Camarillo.
Susan Okin, a lecturer in political science
and part of the faculty of the Feminist Studies
program, said she thinks the capture illus

trates the double-standard that women are not
officially allowed in combat and yet face many
of the same dangers as men.
"If you are in the front lines" and can be
captured, "then surely you are in combat," she
added.
Even though they will face these risks,
women have not been accorded the status of
male soldiers, she added.
"It looks as though, in this case, women are
going to get the bad consequences of being in
combat without the good consequences of
being in combat," she said.
Camarillo said there may be pressure in the

United States to pull women back from harm's
way, but that is nearly impossible because they
play vital functions in the military.
U.S. female medical personnel were also
captured in the Philippines and in the South
Pacific during World War 11.
"I don't think [the Iraqis] are going to show
any empathy to women that happen to be
POWs," Camarillo said.
But, he said, "I think if a woman is captured
and afforded the same treatment as a male
POW, if a woman is put as a human shield and
she is killed, .. . there will be
increased outrage over the treat
ment of Allied POWs."
Quynh Tran, coordinator of
the Women's Center, said she
thinks women face "different
kinds of danger in wartime than
men" do, such as sexual assault,
but added that "women in general
always face a certain amount of
danger."
Tran said she believes the
United States will actively use the
image of "uncivilized" Iraqis
threatening American women as
a propaganda tool.
"I hope this is not used to basi
cally galvanize the American pub
lic into supporting the war," she
said.
According to the Associated
Press, the Iraqi military com
mand released a statement saying
women "will be given good treat
ment in accordance with the

spirit of lofty Islamic laws."
Abdullahi Bature, president of
the Stanford Islamic Society, sug
gested this might not be the case.
"Saddam Hussein has gone all the
way out of the religion.
"There is a difference between
Islam and someone who claims to
be a Muslim," he said. "The (rul
ing Iraqi) Baath Party is not an
Islamic state. It's a killing state."
Bature said he thinks Islamic
laws are irrelevant in this case
because Saddam has not followed
them in the past. But if Saddam
were to base his treatment of pos
sible women POWs on Islamic
laws, that would mean they
should be "properly covered," and
should "not be displayed in a way
[they] could be molested," Bature
said.
According to the tenets of
Islam, if a woman captured from
an opposing force was not firing
weapons against Muslims but was
instead playing a support role,
she would retain the "special priv
ileges" usually afforded women,
Bature said.
