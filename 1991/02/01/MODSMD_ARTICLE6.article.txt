# Affirmative Action Council breaks up
## 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
Although Stanford's Affirma
tive Action Council held its last
meeting yesterday, a number of
issues still confront the future of
multicultural development —
from new affirmative action poli
cies to reduced staff morale.
Because the council has
achieved many of its goals, the
group is splitting into more
focused task forces to better shape
the University's multicultural
vision, according to Sharon
Parker, director of the Office of
Multicultural Development.
During the last three years, the
council — a diverse group of 25
staff members — has taken the
lead in many of the University's
multicultural efforts. The council
coordinated a search for a new
affirmative action officer, assisted
in the review of the University
Committee on Minority Issues
report and spearheaded an exter
nal affirmative action policy.
At its final meeting, the council
discussed a number of goals and
issues which will be addressed by
the task forces.
The University is close to
approving an affirmative action
policy first discussed by the coun
cil in Nov. 1988 which will affect
"all interactions between the Uni
versity and its external environ
ment," Parker said.
What this means is that any

time a University department
decides to contract work with out
side firms, it would have to give
equal opportunity to companies
run by women, minorities or dis
abled people.
The policy would include con
tracts for catering, construction,
consulting, entertainment, facili
ties and lodging, transportation
and procuring of materials.
The policy's stated goals are "to
promote diversity in the external
environment through judicious
use of the University's financial
and other resources and to
enhance diversity in the Univer
sity through increased contacts
with and awareness of minorities,
women and disabled people."
The new policy would apply to
activities on all Stanford land,
including the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center, Stanford
Shopping Center and Stanford
Research Park.
The Provost would be required
to appoint a review group to
assess the effort.
In December, Parker presented
the policy to the Cabinet of Deans
which endorsed it and forwarded
it to the Operations Council.
While "There was no objection to
the policy per se, they just don't
want to be policing the shopping
center," she said. While the policy
would not affect hiring practices
of individual tenants, it would
influence how those tenants are
selected.
Parker said another goal is
keeping the Office of Multicul
tural Development (formerly
known as the Affirmative Action
Office) on the same administra
tive level as the vice presidents,
who report directly to University
President Donald Kennedy.
She said a Human Resources
task force chaired by Dean of the
School of Education Marshall
Smith had wanted to place the
office under the control of the
vacant, newly created position of
Vice President for Human
Resources. The council "reacted
very strongly" and the adminis
tration backed off. Parker said
reporting to a vice president
would be too limited and "disem
powering."
Placement is still an issue, she
said, and the final decision will
not come for a few months.
"All the vice presidents need to
realize they are also responsible

for multiculturalism," she said.
Parker said she was surprised
by the amount of debate stirred
up in the Deans' Cabinet over the
council's suggestion to allow staff
members release time to attend
special staff forums about work
related problems. The suggestion
is now "caught in bureaucracy,"
she said.
One staff forum, "Stanford
Staffers," meets monthly during
lunch hour and allows staff mem
bers to speak and exchange ideas.
Other similar multicultural
forums exist for the the Asian-
American, African-American, Chi
cano/Latino, Filipino and disabled
staff communities.
Parker said acceptance of the
idea "would speak volumes" to the
staff and would boost morale.
Some members of the council
pointed to other staff morale
problems. Jim Larimore, assistant
dean of Student Affairs and direc
tor of the Native American Cul
tural Center, said the staff used to
feel a connection with its work
and the mission of the University.
"Now, morale is pathetically
low," he said.

agreed, saying departments are
not displaying any form of organi
zational cohesiveness.
The staff "is not seen in the
same light as faculty or students,"
said Andrew Lisac, an assistant
dean of the summer session. He
said staff would feel a sense of
"self-worth" if they had an official
voice in the University similar to
the ASSU or the faculty senate.
Other suggestions presented by
the council included sending out a
University-wide notice that
departments and schools imple
ment a targeted hiring policy, as
well as ending the use of profes
sional search firms for key posi
tions. Parker said resources
should not be invested in outside
search firms but in the Univer
sity's affirmative action recruit
ment program.

consulting, entertainment, facili
ties and lodging, transportation
and procuring of materials.
The policy's stated goals are "to
promote diversity in the external
environment through judicious
use of the University's financial
and other resources and to
enhance diversity in the Univer
sity through increased contacts
with and awareness of minorities,
women and disabled people."
The new policy would apply to
activities on all Stanford land,
including the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center, Stanford
Shopping Center and Stanford
Research Park.
The Provost would be required
to appoint a review group to
assess the effort.
In December, Parker presented
the policy to the Cabinet of Deans
which endorsed it and forwarded
it to the Operations Council.
While "There was no objection to
the policy per se, they just don't
want to be policing the shopping
center," she said. While the policy
would not affect hiring practices
of individual tenants, it would
influence how those tenants are
selected.
Parker said another goal is
keeping the Office of Multicul
tural Development (formerly
known as the Affirmative Action
Office) on the same administra
tive level as the vice presidents,
who report directly to University
President Donald Kennedy.
She said a Human Resources
task force chaired by Dean of the
School of Education Marshall
Smith had wanted to place the
office under the control of the
vacant, newly created position of
Vice President for Human
Resources. The council "reacted
very strongly" and the adminis
tration backed off. Parker said
reporting to a vice president
would be too limited and "disem
powering."
Placement is still an issue, she
said, and the final decision will
not come for a few months.
"All the vice presidents need to
realize they are also responsible

for multiculturalism," she said.
Parker said she was surprised
by the amount of debate stirred
up in the Deans' Cabinet over the
council's suggestion to allow staff
members release time to attend
special staff forums about work
related problems. The suggestion
is now "caught in bureaucracy,"
she said.
One staff forum, "Stanford
Staffers," meets monthly during
lunch hour and allows staff mem
bers to speak and exchange ideas.
Other similar multicultural
forums exist for the the Asian-
American, African-American, Chi
cano/Latino, Filipino and disabled
staff communities.
Parker said acceptance of the
idea "would speak volumes" to the
staff and would boost morale.
Some members of the council
pointed to other staff morale
problems. Jim Larimore, assistant
dean of Student Affairs and direc
tor of the Native American Cul
tural Center, said the staff used to
feel a connection with its work
and the mission of the University.
"Now, morale is pathetically
low," he said.

resentative in Human Resources,
agreed, saying departments are
not displaying any form of organi
zational cohesiveness.
The staff "is not seen in the
same light as faculty or students,"
said Andrew Lisac, an assistant
dean of the summer session. He
said staff would feel a sense of
"self-worth" if they had an official
voice in the University similar to
the ASSU or the faculty senate.
Other suggestions presented by
the council included sending out a
University-wide notice that
departments and schools imple
ment a targeted hiring policy, as
well as ending the use of profes
sional search firms for key posi
tions. Parker said resources
should not be invested in outside
search firms but in the Univer
sity's affirmative action recruit
ment program.
