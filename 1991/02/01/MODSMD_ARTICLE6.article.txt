# Affirmative Action Council breaks up
## 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
Although Stanford's Affirma
tive Action Council held its last
meeting yesterday, a number of
issues still confront the future of
multicultural development —
from new affirmative action poli
cies to reduced staff morale.
Because the council has
achieved many of its goals, the
group is splitting into more
focused task forces to better shape
the University's multicultural
vision, according to Sharon
Parker, director of the Office of
Multicultural Development.
During the last three years, the
council — a diverse group of 25
staff members — has taken the
lead in many of the University's
multicultural efforts. The council
coordinated a search for a new
affirmative action officer, assisted
in the review of the University
Committee on Minority Issues
report and spearheaded an exter
nal affirmative action policy.
At its final meeting, the council
discussed a number of goals and
issues which will be addressed by
the task forces.
The University is close to
approving an affirmative action
policy first discussed by the coun
cil in Nov. 1988 which will affect
"all interactions between the Uni
versity and its external environ
ment," Parker said.
What this means is that any

time a University department
decides to contract work with out
side firms, it would have to give
equal opportunity to companies
run by women, minorities or dis
abled people.
The policy would include con
tracts for catering, construction,
consulting, entertainment, facili
ties and lodging, transportation
and procuring of materials.
The policy's stated goals are "to
promote diversity in the external
environment through judicious
use of the University's financial
and other resources and to
enhance diversity in the Univer
sity through increased contacts
with and awareness of minorities,
women and disabled people."
The new policy would apply to
activities on all Stanford land,
including the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center, Stanford
Shopping Center and Stanford
Research Park.
The Provost would be required
to appoint a review group to
assess the effort.
In December, Parker presented
the policy to the Cabinet of Deans
which endorsed it and forwarded
it to the Operations Council.
While "There was no objection to
the policy per se, they just don't
want to be policing the shopping
center," she said. While the policy
would not affect hiring practices
of individual tenants, it would
