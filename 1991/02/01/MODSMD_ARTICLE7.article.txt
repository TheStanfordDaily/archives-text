# ROTC students may be called up to fight
## 
### Eleni Kirkas StafF writer 
While the reinstitution of the
draft in response to the Gulf War
is still a distant possibility, the
prospect of active military duty
may be just around the corner for
Stanford students involved in
ROTC.
A total of 115 Stanford under
graduates are currently enrolled
in Navy, Army and Air Force
ROTC programs. Nearly half are
in Navy ROTC.
Stanford students must com
mute to other schools — such as
UC-Berkeley and San Jose State
University — to train with their
units each week because Stan
ford's ROTC unit was closed down
in the early 1970s due to Vietnam
War protests.
ROTC was established in 1917
under the authority of the
National Defense Act of 1916. The
program offers college scholar
ships and military and job train
ing in exchange for active service
in the armed forces. Upon comple
tion of ROTC training, partici
pants become commissioned offi
cers.
According to Marine Maj.
Finnie, public affairs officer at the
Navy ROTC unit in Berkeley, stu
dents who have graduated from
college and completed their train
ing could conceivably be called up
to fight if the war with Iraq drags
on. While students are discussing

the prospect, no special measures
have been taken to prepare them
for war.
"Most of us have thought
about these sort of things before
we came in and realize that it's a
reality," senior Jeff Neal, a Navy
ROTC student, said about the
chance of going to war.
"Obviously I thought about it. I
always knew there would be the
possibility, " said senior Frank
Holmes, who is in Air Force
ROTC. He is considering remain
ing on active duty beyond the
commitment required by ROTC.
Many ROTC students are given
tuition and books and in some
cases, minimal living expenses.
However, not all ROTC students
are on scholarship.
Finnie downplayed the impor
tance of the scholarship money in
motivating students to join the
program, saying, "I hope we get
the people who join because they
have a commitment" to serving
their country.
Students who join ROTC are
required to take an oath of office
much like that of elected officials,
Finnie said. "It's not just a job.
It's a little more than that," he
said, "It's a commitment"
After one year, students have
the option to quit ROTC without
any further obligations.
Neal agreed with Finnie's
assessment. He said he joined
ROTC not for the scholarship
money, but primarily out of a
sense of patriotism and because
the Navy offers a lot of opportu
nities for interesting jobs and
interesting experiences."

Contrary to popular
belief, we don't learn
to kill people with our
bare hands.'
- Jeff Neal

There is often a misperception
on campus about ROTC, Neal
said. "It's not what you see on TV
all the time," he explained, "It's
not boot camp. And, contrary to
popular belief, we don't learn to
kill people with our bare hands."
The ROTC program involves
much class work. Neal said Navy
ROTC students travel each
Wednesday afternoon to UC-
Berkeley for five to eight hours of
drills in Naval etiquette, lectures
and presentations from officers,
and classes ranging from the his
tory of the Navy to leadership and
management training.
Holmes said he spends at least
four hours every Thursday in his
Air Force ROTC classes at San
Jose State University. He fre
quently stays even longer to par
ticipate in activities of the Arnold
Air Society, which he described as
a sort of "club for cadets."
Holmes said he joined ROTC
because of the opportunities the
Air Force afforded him, but noted
that the scholarship money was
an incentive. Although the Air
Force would also have paid for
medical school, Holmes, a double
major in biology and chemistry,
declined that scholarship in favor
of one ottered by the University of
Alabama at Birmingham.
Both Holmes and Neal will
have to fulfill a commitment of
active duty service in the Navy
and Air Force when they finish
school. During that time, they will
be trained in a special skill of their
choice. Holmes is considering
becoming a flight surgeon; Neal, a
mechanical engineering major, is
interested in the Navy's civil engi
neering corps and nuclear tech
nology division.
