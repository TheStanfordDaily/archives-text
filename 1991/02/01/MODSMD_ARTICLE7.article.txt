# ROTC students may be called up to fight

While the reinstitution of the
draft in response to the Gulf War
is still a distant possibility, the
prospect of active military duty
may be just around the corner for
Stanford students involved in
ROTC.
A total of 115 Stanford under
graduates are currently enrolled
in Navy, Army and Air Force
ROTC programs. Nearly half are
in Navy ROTC.
Stanford students must com
mute to other schools — such as
UC-Berkeley and San Jose State
University — to train with their
units each week because Stan
ford's ROTC unit was closed down
in the early 1970s due to Vietnam
War protests.
ROTC was established in 1917
under the authority of the
National Defense Act of 1916. The
program offers college scholar
ships and military and job train
ing in exchange for active service
in the armed forces. Upon comple
tion of ROTC training, partici
pants become commissioned offi
cers.
According to Marine Maj.
Finnie, public affairs officer at the
Navy ROTC unit in Berkeley, stu
dents who have graduated from
college and completed their train
ing could conceivably be called up
to fight if the war with Iraq drags
on. While students are discussing

the prospect, no special measures
have been taken to prepare them
for war.
"Most of us have thought
about these sort of things before
we came in and realize that it's a
reality," senior Jeff Neal, a Navy
ROTC student, said about the
chance of going to war.
"Obviously I thought about it. I
always knew there would be the
possibility, " said senior Frank
Holmes, who is in Air Force
ROTC. He is considering remain
ing on active duty beyond the
commitment required by ROTC.
Many ROTC students are given
tuition and books and in some
cases, minimal living expenses.
However, not all ROTC students
are on scholarship.
Finnie downplayed the impor
tance of the scholarship money in
motivating students to join the
program, saying, "I hope we get
the people who join because they
have a commitment" to serving
their country.
Students who join ROTC are
required to take an oath of office
much like that of elected officials,
Finnie said. "It's not just a job.
It's a little more than that," he
said, "It's a commitment"
After one year, students have
the option to quit ROTC without
any further obligations.
Neal agreed with Finnie's
assessment. He said he joined
