If either of these
makes your pulse race,
talk to us.
Having to get a real job
isn't so bad.
Not when there's a place w here the
people get as pumped up about technol
ogy as you do.
A place where you work on real stuff
right away. And red tape and bureaucracy
and produce tomorrow's
products.
We're involved in electronic design
automation, automatic test equipment,
telecommunications test, and custom
connections. All four of our businesses
are market leaders.
Our work environment is. well, colle
are kept away.
Of course, there is a catch. VYc only want giate. And among other great benefits,
software and hardware professionals who like we offer an educational assistance plan
to be on the leading edge of high technology.
That's because our business is help
ing other high tech companies develop
with 100% reimbursement—up front.
So talk to us. ()r settle for a job that
may turn out to be just work.
