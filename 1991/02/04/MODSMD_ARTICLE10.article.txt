Winnie Mandela on trial
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -
Winnie Mandela, wife of ANC leader Nelson
Mandela, is scheduled to go on trial today in
Johannesburg with several ex-bodyguards on
kidnapping and assault charges.
State prosecutors allege four youths were
taken to Mrs. Mandela's home and beaten in
December 1988. The youngest youth, 14-year
old Stompei Seipei, was killed.
For many black people, especially the mili

destruction of apartheid.
Prosecutors say the trial may be postponed.
A decision will be made today.
