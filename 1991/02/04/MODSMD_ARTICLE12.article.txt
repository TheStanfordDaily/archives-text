SAN FRANCISCO GOTERA, El
Salvador (AP) — Army troops briefly
detained 18 journalists returning from
rebel territory where they had covered
a ceremony in which the guerrillas
returned anti-aircraft missiles to
Nicaraguan officials.
Troops of the 4th Military Detach
ment based in this town 72 miles
northeast of San Salvador used a road
block Saturday evening to halt five
vehicles carrying the reporters and
obliged them to proceed under armed
escort to the barracks.
Col. Oscar Leon Linares, comman
der of the 4th Detachment, said the
journalists' detention was ordered by

his superiors in the Defense Ministry
and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
The commanders reportedly were
chagrined at coverage of the return of
the missiles because the ceremony was
held before hundreds of guerrillas and
rebel supporters and included partici
pation of high-ranking diplomats and
government officials of Nicaragua and
Mexico.
The rebels returned the missiles,
which they bought in October from
Nicaraguan army officers, after the
United States protested Nicaraguan
interference in El Salvador's 12-year
old civil war.
The ceremony could be viewed as

giving credibility to insurgent claims
that they exercise full control over a
"liberated territory." The government
seeks to portray the rebels as isolated
terrorists and bandits.
The reporters were held for just
under two hours while their vehicles
were searched and their reporting
materials — videotapes, notebooks and
film — confiscated. Among those
detained were reporters from The
Associated Press, Reuters, Agence
France-Presse, Inter Press Service,
Viz News, Worldwide Television News
and several local media.
The rightist government of Presi
dent Alfredo Cristiani issued a com

munique accusing the journalists of
"violation of established norms and
procedures" for travelling to the guer
rilla-controlled town of Perquin, north
of Gotera, where the missiles were
handed over.
By means of roadblocks, the army
regularly impedes access by journalists
to rebel-dominated northern and east
ern regions of El Salvador. But the
journalists had encountered no mili
tary roadblocks when they went to
Perquin on Saturday.
"Make sure this does not happen
again. Because if it happens again,
you'll all be dead," Leon told the
detained reporters at his barracks.
