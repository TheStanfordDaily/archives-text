## Editor's welcome 
### 
IN A TIME OF WAR, The Daily
may not be the first newspaper
people pick up in the morning.
We don't have our own eyewit
ness reports of bombing in Israel
or skirmishes on the Saudi border.
We don't have "our person in
Baghdad" or even a press-pool
reporter.
We don't know what it's like to
be in the Gulf today, nor will we
able to convey that to our readers.
But we shouldn't have to. The
Daily cannot be the only source of
information for the Stanford com
munity, especially now.
For in-depth coverage of the war,
people should read another paper
— or several — to decipher the
Pentagon-censored news.
Although the war seems to be
going well (if any war can go well),
informed members of society can
not become complacent. Thinking
individuals cannot just assume the
war is continuing on pace in a dis
tant location and that it is not
really affecting us.
The role of The Daily in covering
this war is to show how it is touch
ing us. We have the ability, and the
responsibility, to present the effect
of events in the Persian Gulf on the
lives of Stanford people — ROTC
students, those with family in the
Gulf, foreign students and those
studying overseas, to name a few.
We may only be able to provide
at-a-glance coverage of the front
lines, but our reporting back here
at Stanford will be comprehensive.
We will work to get the stories that
you won't see in The New York
Times or the San Jose Mercury
News — stories about how our
lives here are changing as most of
us experience our first war.
Our Opinions page will continue
to provide a forum for community
members to express their views on
the war as it progresses. Letters
and editorials will reflect the ongo
ing debates and add to them.
Most of all, we will not let the
issue drop. There is a temptation
for some people to ignore the news

when "nothing big" is happening.
Less than three weeks after the
war started, people are already
becoming used to it. We cannot
allow the war to be seen as "the
same old thing."
Already some have said, "Noth
ing really happened today" in the
Gulf, as cities are destroyed and
people killed or taken prisoner.
What will happen after two
months when similar events are
occurring everyday?
It is important for the commu
nity to know that we do not have
an agenda in covering this war, or
anything else for that matter. It
has been suggested that The Daily
could influence campus opinion for
or against the war through the sto
ries we write and how we place
them.
But our purpose as a newspaper
is not to prejudice people's views by
giving them slanted or intention
ally incomplete information. The
best we can do in this and all situa
tions is to clearly and objectively
present the facts and let people
make their own decisions.
The opinions represented in this
box every day are those of our edi
torial board, which consists of five
editors, two staff and three com
munity members. Our editorials do
not represent an agenda, or even
the input, of our news department,
which is not involved on the edito
rial board.
Each day, it becomes more evi
dent this will not be a short war.
For many here at Stanford,
though, the danger is not being
sent to war, but forgetting it is even
happening.
We will do our best to keep you
in touch. Please keep us posted on
how we are doing.
