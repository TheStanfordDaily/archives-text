## Waging war on words 
### 
IN A PARTICULARLY POIGNANT
and humorous sketch, comedian
George Carlin rails out against the
distorted reality created by the American
people through its language. The Central
Intelligence Agency doesn't assassinate
someone in another country; they
"remove," "extinguish" or "neutralize"
the target. No one "dies" anymore; they
"pass away," "expire" or "move on." Peo
ple are no longer "handicapped" or "dis
abled"; they're "differently abled" or
"handicapable."
Language helps define reality. It's a
simple fact of life that our terminology in
part determines the way we view love, life
and war.
At no time has this been more appar
ent — or more important — than the cur
rent war in the Persian Gulf. The ensuing
war of words has seen Saddam Hussein
called "an authoritarian dictator," "envi
ronmental terrorist" and the "Butcher of
Baghdad." President Bush, meanwhile,
has been enviably dubbed "the Satan" by
the Butcher himself. The military termi
nology applied in daily Pentagon press
conferences has permeated the everyday
speech of civilians, with "sorties,"
"Scuds" and "BDA (bomb damage assess
ment)" leading the pack of Pentagonisms.
One trend in Stanford's own lingo is
the increased use of language to mask
reality. Stanford administrators, for
example, often refer to budget "short
falls" — not "deficits" — and solve the
problems through "repositioning" — not
"cutbacks." Granted, positions are being
changed, but that in itself does not save
money. Budget cuts need to be made, and

some people will inevitably lose their jobs.
The sooner we deal with that reality, the
quicker we can find some real solutions.
Socially, Stanford students find cre
ative ways to maintain their reality that
"Stanford students don't date." I don't
want to burst anybody's bubble, but
Stanford students do date; they just don't
call it that. This self-supported reality
makes it difficult to communicate with
non-Stanford students. When a student
from another college asks about a Stan
ford student's love life, a typical answer
follows: "Well, I don't have a girlfriend,
but I have been seeing someone for a few
months." Or they admit to having a
"pseudo-girlfriend" or a "boyfriend, sort
of." For some reason, that's an easier
reality to deal with than the real commit
ment implied in the b-word or the g-word.
On a more serious note, the psycholog
ical reasoning that recently put forth the
terminology of "rape survivor" instead of
"rape victim" seems flawed. Not only does
the term "survivor" definitionally imply
most people do not survive, but it also
ignores the real problem presented by
rape — a woman's victimization by a
man. "Survivor" implies that the woman
had some role in the assault; more prop
erly, "victim" puts the responsibility
squarely on the shoulders of the man who
physically and emotionally brutalized the
woman.
Our dependence on recreated realities
makes me wonder if Stanford students
are becoming "soft" in this cushy, country
club environment. If we can't deal with
the reality here, what happens when we
get in the "real world"?

The dichotomy between people in the
ivory tower and in the "outside world"
was striking when war broke out in the
Persian Gulf. While hundreds of thou
sands of our peers were entering an
armed conflict, unsure if they would be
attacked with chemical or biological
weapons — or even live to see Valentine's
Day, we were here at Stanford setting up
counseling options to "deal with" the war.
I'm not saying each person should fly
solo with all his problems, but individuals
need to develop some internal strength to
avoid a society dependent on linguists,
counselors and psychoanalysts.
In light of language's defining quality,
we need to constantly evaluate our use of
language and the effect it has on our soci
ety. For too long, we have used language
to protect us from the truth and to make
life easier for us. Because of it, we are
stuck in a cycle — always needing to find
new terms to disguise new realities. How
can we deal with reality if we ignore the
reality of it?
Americans seem to have a love affair
with commentators and columnists who
"tell it like it is." It's time for our lan
guage to do the same.
