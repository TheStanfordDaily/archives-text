## Reader attacks Daily coverage of White Plaza rally 
### 
The reporting in the jan.
25 Daily of the Free Kuwait rally
in White Plaza the day before was
notable for its subjectivity.
The Daily estimated the supporters of
our involvement in the Persian Gulf at
"about 20," and the anti-war faction at,
evidently, more than 80, because it stat
ed that the crowd numbered "more than
100."
I submit that there is no way The
Daily could have accurately estimated
the number of supporters of the rally
among the crowd, and the volume of
applause at times belied its estimate of
only 20. This is flagrant editorializing

1 would hate to think that any of the people protesting
our involvement in this war are doing so because they
want to avoid a draft.'

masquerading as reporting.
I also regret the inaccuracy of The
Daily's "quotes" of remarks at the rally.
I would like to state emphatically that I
did not say, as quoted, that "some of the
protesters are objecting to the war
because they want to avoid the draft."
My statement was, "I would hate to
think that any of the people protesting

our involvement in this war are doing so
because they want to avoid a draft." I
submit that this is a far different state
ment than that which I have been quoted
as making.
Finally, I want to emphasize my pur
pose in helping to initiate the rally. That
is, I am wary of hearing all the accusa
tions of the United States as the aggres-

I'm equally wary of the sophomoric
reiteration of all the mistakes and errors
of U.S. policy in the past, as if this some
how makes it wrong for the United
States to do the right thing now. I want
to state clearty that Saddam Hussein will
stop at nothing to achieve his expansion
ist purposes. Nothing that the United
States has or has not done in the past
makes any difference now.
I am proud that, at least this once, our
government has stepped forward to
oppose despotism and brutality.
