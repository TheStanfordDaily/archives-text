# Humanistic concerns rule out using nuclear weapons in the Gulf
## 
### 
Three parts of last Monday's Daily
caught my eye: first, the excellent edito
rial rebuking Tom Campbell's impru
dence in approving possible nuclear first
strike by our country in the Middle East;
second, the article about Oscar Arias'
pessimism on roughly the same subject;
and third, the ad which announced free
counseling for those who are exercised in
mind and spirit over the intractable and
growing threat of widespread conflict.
As the editorial points out, using
nuclear weapons is unacceptable. Are
many aware that 4,000 Japanese victims
of the Hiroshima bomb died last year?
The bomb exploded over that city more
than 45 years ago and people continue to
die from the effects. Greenpeace recently
published grim data on the radiation at
Chernobyl which has turned out to be
worse than the most pessimistic esti
mates.
A backpack nuclear warhead, equal to
the strength of the Hiroshima bomb, was

designed some time ago for use by our
troops in battle. But wouldn't the fate of
the soldier be sealed as soon as he fired
his weapon?
The nature of modern war technology
outlaws war. Our generals, the Presi
dent, his staff and all Bush's well-trained
media people are feeding us lies and pro
paganda worthy of Goebbels. Do we plan
to use nuclear weapons as soon as our
army faces defeat in the desert? Sobering
thought, especially since negotiations are
now under way to abolish nuclear arma
ments by establishing a comprehensive
test ban, an international treaty that
Bush threatens to veto.
