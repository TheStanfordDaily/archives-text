# Professor's sexist implication is not supported by facts
## 
### 
We would like to thank Carol Delaney
for her much-needed defense of Aim6e
Allison (Daily, Jan. 29).
Delaney's letter was both thoughtful

and compassionate, and it raised impor
tant points about our quickness to criti
cize Allison's decision without fully con
sidering her situation. Delaney's com
ments have caused us to significantly
rethink our position.
The final paragraph of Delaney's let
ter, however, strikes us as tragic. In the
body of her letter, she presents a kind,
helpful argument that truly contributes
to the issue at hand. Unfortunately, it is
only a lead-in to a sexist plug for which
she presents no basis.
She implies that there is a link
between the number of men who have
publicly criticized Miss Allison and the
cause for that criticism, yet offers no
explanation for that connection.
Indeed, there are many men who are
criticizing Aim6e Allison. But there are
women casting stones as well. We live
among the student body Delaney seems
to know so well, and we have heard
them.
Nobody is criticizing Allison for being
a woman, and such an assertion is
unfounded. If it were a man in her posi
tion our reactions would be identical;
there is no evidence that all the same
criticisms would not have been voiced.
Our wish is that the issues which con
front all of us continue to be discussed in

the forum of our university, but dis
cussed as what they really are, and not
turned into something which they clearly
are not. We also sincerely hope Allison is
able to resolve the problem which faces
her.
