# Big guns loaded for indirect-cost inquiry

### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
It's not easy being the subject of four
federal investigations and a non-stop bar
rage of media inquiries — a lesson Stanford
officials have learned the hard way.

"Legal Times" of seven lawyers and lobby
ists who specialize in representing clients
before the subcommittee, which is chaired
by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich. "Legal
Times" is a Washington-based trade publi
cation for lawyers.
A hearing on Stanford's policies has not
been scheduled, but congressional investi
gators say a date later this month or in
early March is likely.
The acquisition of Mankiewicz and the
two D.C. attorneys does not come cheaply.
"The matter at stake has required us to
