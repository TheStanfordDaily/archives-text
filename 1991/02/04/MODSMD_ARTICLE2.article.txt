# Big guns loaded for indirect-cost inquiry
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
It's not easy being the subject of four
federal investigations and a non-stop bar
rage of media inquiries — a lesson Stanford
officials have learned the hard way.
Hoping to beef up the defense of its indi
rect cost policies, the University has hired
an outside public relations heavyweight,
Frank Mankiewicz.
Mankiewicz is a former press secretary
for Robert Kennedy, a former campaign
director for George McGovern, a former
Washington Post columnist and the former
head of National Public Radio.
He is currently the vice chairman of Hill
& Knowlton, the largest public relations
firm in the country. And for the next several
months, from his office in Washington,
D.C., Mankiewicz will be advising Stanford
on how to handle the press attention gener
ated by the indirect cost controversy here.
"We decided we needed additional help,"
explained Larry Horton, associate vice
president of public affairs. "We've never
faced anything like this before."
The University's decision to hire
Mankiewicz, made quietly last month, fol
lowed closely on the heels of another move
intended to shore up support in Washing
ton. To prepare for an impending hearing
by the House Subcommittee on Oversight

'We decided we needed
additional help. We've
never faced anything like
this before.'
— Larry Horton

and Investigations, the University hired
attorney Thomas Ryan of Wunder, Ryan &
Cannon and lawyer-lobbyist James Fitz
patrick of Arnold & Porter.
Both Ryan and Fitzpatrick were
included on a list published last spring by
"Legal Times" of seven lawyers and lobby
ists who specialize in representing clients
before the subcommittee, which is chaired
by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich. "Legal
Times" is a Washington-based trade publi
cation for lawyers.
A hearing on Stanford's policies has not
been scheduled, but congressional investi
gators say a date later this month or in
early March is likely.
The acquisition of Mankiewicz and the
two D.C. attorneys does not come cheaply.
"The matter at stake has required us to
expend funds we would prefer not to," Hor
ton said. He declined to say what the cost
would be, but added that hiring
outside lawyers and public rela
tions consultants is a smart eco
nomical move from a long-term
perspective.
Stanford received $554 million
from the government during the
last decade for the indirect costs
of federally sponsored research.
Around $175 million of that
amount is at stake in the current
controversy.
In the past few months, the
University has been embarrassed
by media revelations that Stan
ford includes items such as flower
arrangements and antiques in its
indirect cost recovery claims.
The hiring of Mankiewicz will
not stop the flow of such damag
ing stories, Horton said. Nor will
Mankiewicz help the University
get better "spin" on such stories.
"We wouldn't even think of
hiring a spin doctor," Horton said.
"We'd like to pitch the ball
straight."
Mankiewicz will be called upon
to offer advice "primarily on press
matters" and to provide construc
tive criticism of University initia
tives, Horton said. Last week,
Mankiewicz helped coach Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy
for an interview with "20/20,"
ABC's weekly news program.
