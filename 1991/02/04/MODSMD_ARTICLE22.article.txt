## Michael Friedly Walking the line between emotion and responsibility 
### 
I ATTENDED A PEACE RALLY IN
Palo Alto several weeks ago — before
the war began in the Persian Gulf —
not really sure of why I was there. As a
journalist reporting on some aspects of
the anti-war movement, I knew that I
needed to keep abreast of what had been
organized, so that at least served as the
excuse for my presence.
But standing on the edge of the crowd
that Saturday, news reporter's notebook
in hand to establish myself as an journal
ist, I suddenly became unsure of my role,
finding myself wanting to join in the
march, but always aware of my responsi
bility to remain as objective as humanly
possible.
As the march began, I stayed off to one
side, crossing the street at one point to
show the crowd that I was separate from
them. I watched the protesters as they
shouted their silly slogans, reassuring
myself that that was not where I
belonged, wondering exactly where it was
that I did belong in the search for a peace
ful resolution of the Gulf crisis.
In the last few months, I have evolved
from a position of confusion about what
the United States should do in response
to Iraq's aggression to one of firm opposi
tion to military intervention against Iraq.
Not until that Saturday was I forced to

ask myself what my response to the Gulf
war would be. Throughout this whole cri
sis, Stanford has been strangely quiet on
the issue, campus life going on as usual,
retaining the impression that somehow
the campus is a haven from concerns
about a war that would take place thou
sands of miles away.
Missing are the continuous demon
strations for peace, the confrontations
with police, the flower placed in the barrel
of an officer's rifle. Missing are the mili
tary recruiting tables, the posters of
Uncle Sam asking us to join the war
effort, the crowds of flag-waving patriots
honoring America's war veterans.
Perhaps the crisis so far has hit many
students in a way that is far more per
sonal than can be expressed in a mass
demonstration or a letter to the Presi
dent. For some students, it has brought a
period of personal reappraisal, in which
students must decide not only their polit
ical positions on the Gulf crisis, but also
how to follow through on their positions
and advance their views.
The confrontation in the Gulf has
affected some students perhaps not at all,
save for a fleeting vision of desert battle
scenes, or an occasional flash of patrio
tism.
The crisis, however, has profoundly

affected me, causing me to reappraise the
value that I had placed in being an Amer
ican. The decision of where I will stand on
the issue of war and peace is easy to make
and difficult to follow. I will not go to war.
I will not support this war.
Even if I am drafted into military ser
vice, I will not participate. I believe myself
to be a conscientious objector, as I fit into
the criteria cited by the military. Convinc
ing the military of this will be the only dif
ficulty. If this status is denied to me, I will
face a jail term rather than comply with
the involuntary servitude of a draft.
I take this position against the war and
my participation in it for reasons that are
both moral and political, idealistic and
practical.
I take this position partly out of a
moral objection to all war and the killing
of innocents.
I take this position out of a fundamen
tal belief that this conflict can be settled
peacefully. I take this position with the
hope that the international community
will stop to listen to a voice of reason and
will end this disastrous war.
I also feel strongly against this partic
ular war because it is unnecessary and
untimely. Rather than pursue the sanc
tions and end the conflict in a peaceful
manner, the President has chosen to meet

violence with violence. Although Bush
justifies this on the basis that Saddam
Hussein's aggression cannot go
unchecked and unpunished, it is just as
dangerous a precedent to resort to force
to expel him.
The international community had a
remarkable opportunity to create a new
world order in which the restoration of
order would be achieved not by violence
but by economic sanctions and diplomatic
isolation. Instead the new world order,
like the old one, will be based on the mili
tary prowess of the superpowers.
I brought many of these biases that I
have just discussed into my job as the
news editor of The Daily, which ended last
week. It was my job, and still is as a
reporter, to remain as objective and free
from bias as I possibly can. It is the jour
nalist's job to be a machine, never consid
ering stories from a personal point of
view, never interjecting his own preju
dices and biases.
In many ways, this was an impossible
role. I am human; I have biases. As hard
as I may try, there will most likely be
some loss of objectivity when I report on
an issue that is as important to me as this
one is.
I hope that I have remained true to the
primary creed of a journalist: the fair,

objective presentation of the news.
But I find myself in a conflict for which
I see no resolution. I am caught between
competing obligations, one to The Daily's
staff and its readership, and one to
myself.
My confusion in large part stems from
the fact that I am profoundly disillu
sioned, caught by surprise by the failure
to even consider negotiations before
jumping headlong into a costly war. I am
disillusioned with the almost automatic
response of fighting violence with vio
lence, and the failure of the American
people to question it.
I am disillusioned with the anti-war
movement, whose feeble attempts to
protest the war have elicited little more
than scorn from the vast majority of
America, whether or not this scorn is
deserved.
I will not be able to convince President
Bush that his policies in the Persian Gulf
are wrong, or that a war in the area will
most likely be disastrous. But hopefully I
can come out of this crisis with the sense
that I have withstood the challenges to
my moral standards, and with the feeling
of gratification that I have contributed to
a position in which I so strongly believe.
