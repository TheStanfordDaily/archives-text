## Keefe and Cardinal down Oregon State Beavers 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
Ain't no points given for beauty
in a hoops game, and that's just
fine with the Stanford men's bas
ketball team.
The Cardinal bruised its way to
a 64-59 win over Oregon State
Saturday afternoon, surviving a
game that had turnovers and
fouls galore, painfully long scoring
droughts and just a few too many
airballs for most people's aes
thetic tastes.

"It was really ugly out there for
awhile," said Stanford's Adam
Keefe, who uglied his way to a
game-high 29 points on 13-of-16
shooting. "But a W's a W, it
doesn't matter how it looks."
Chad Scott had 15 and Mario
Jackson 14 for the Beavers, who
finished the weekend with losses
at both Cal and Stanford for the
first time since 1973. The win
gives Stanford a 5-5 record in the
Pacific 10 Conference (12-8 over
all), while OSU is 5-4 (11-8), with
all four league losses coming on
the road.
"It wasn't easy," said Stanford
coach Mike Montgomery, whose
team needed several clutch perfor
mances off the bench to hold off
the Beavers. Redshirt freshman
Brent Williams had nine points,
Marcus Lollie added seven and
Paul Garrett chipped in with
three points and four boards in 19
minutes of relief for foul-plagued
center Jim Morgan.
"Paul did a nice job to come in
and make a couple plays, and
that's all we're asking of our
bench," Montgomery said. "Mar
cus came in and settled us down
and did his job to run the club,
and Brent made a couple plays
too. We had a good performance
off the bench."
"I just want to do what I can to

make the team better," said
Williams, who hit four of his six
shots and had four rebounds. "I'm
supposed to come in and give the
team a lift, whether it's with a
shot, a rebound, playing defense. .
.. This game it seemed like all of
that came together."
Even with the strong support
ing cast, though, Saturday's show
had only one real star. Besides
playing a solo on offense — no
other Cardinal starter scored
more than five points — Keefe
also had the starring role at the
defensive end, where he held the
Beavers' Teo Alibegovic, who
averages 18 points a game, to 11
— three on a meaningless shot at
the buzzer.
"The most important thing I
did today was play defense against
Teo," Keefe said. (In the interest
of saving time and aggravation for

everyone, we'll just call Alibegovic
"Teo" the rest of the way.) "A
player like that you don't shut
down — you make things difficult
and he has a bad day."
Things were difficult for both
teams most of the day, as the cold
spells, traveling violations and a
bunch of fouls turned the game
into a struggle for just about
everyone.
"We were never really smooth
— we never excelled for a long
time," Montgomery said. "Playing
Oregon State does that to you."
Actually, Montgomery probably
couldn't have cared less how
pretty the win was. The aesthetic
value of a game depends on one's
perspective, and if Montgomery's
view was that it wasn't smooth,
and Keefe's was that it was a little
ugly now and then, how was OSU
coach Jim Anderson's view of

everything? We 11...
"That first half was probably
the worst half I've ever seen an
Oregon State team play," Ander
son said. He might have been
exaggerating a bit — after all, he's
been at OSU since 1965 — but
still, the Beavers weren't exactly
playing textbook (or comic book,
or any kind of book) basketball.
Playing without guard Will
Brantley (who averages 14 a game
but was out with an ankle injury),
the Cleavers shot a scintillating
26 percent (6 for 23) in the first
half, which was almost as bad as
Wally and the real Beav would
have done against the Cardinal.
They also handed the ball over 11
times (mostly on lousy passes),
giving them a stellar hoop-to
turnover ratio of .545. If OSU

Sophomore Marcus Lollie added seven points to this Saturday's total, helping Stanford eke out a 64-59
