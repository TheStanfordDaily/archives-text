## Keefe and Cardinal down Oregon State Beavers 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
Ain't no points given for beauty
in a hoops game, and that's just
fine with the Stanford men's bas
ketball team.
The Cardinal bruised its way to
a 64-59 win over Oregon State
Saturday afternoon, surviving a
game that had turnovers and
fouls galore, painfully long scoring
droughts and just a few too many
airballs for most people's aes
thetic tastes.

"It was really ugly out there for
awhile," said Stanford's Adam
Keefe, who uglied his way to a
game-high 29 points on 13-of-16
shooting. "But a W's a W, it
doesn't matter how it looks."
Chad Scott had 15 and Mario
Jackson 14 for the Beavers, who
finished the weekend with losses
at both Cal and Stanford for the
first time since 1973. The win
gives Stanford a 5-5 record in the
Pacific 10 Conference (12-8 over
all), while OSU is 5-4 (11-8), with
all four league losses coming on
the road.
"It wasn't easy," said Stanford
coach Mike Montgomery, whose
team needed several clutch perfor
mances off the bench to hold off
the Beavers. Redshirt freshman
Brent Williams had nine points,
Marcus Lollie added seven and
Paul Garrett chipped in with
three points and four boards in 19
minutes of relief for foul-plagued
center Jim Morgan.
"Paul did a nice job to come in
and make a couple plays, and
that's all we're asking of our
bench," Montgomery said. "Mar
cus came in and settled us down
and did his job to run the club,
and Brent made a couple plays
too. We had a good performance
off the bench."
"I just want to do what I can to

make the team better," said
Williams, who hit four of his six
shots and had four rebounds. "I'm
supposed to come in and give the
team a lift, whether it's with a
shot, a rebound, playing defense. .
.. This game it seemed like all of
that came together."
Even with the strong support
ing cast, though, Saturday's show
had only one real star. Besides
playing a solo on offense — no
other Cardinal starter scored
more than five points — Keefe
also had the starring role at the
defensive end, where he held the
Beavers' Teo Alibegovic, who
averages 18 points a game, to 11
— three on a meaningless shot at
the buzzer.
"The most important thing I
did today was play defense against
Teo," Keefe said. (In the interest
of saving time and aggravation for

everyone, we'll just call Alibegovic
"Teo" the rest of the way.) "A
player like that you don't shut
down — you make things difficult
and he has a bad day."
Things were difficult for both
teams most of the day, as the cold
spells, traveling violations and a
bunch of fouls turned the game
into a struggle for just about
everyone.
"We were never really smooth
— we never excelled for a long
time," Montgomery said. "Playing
Oregon State does that to you."
Actually, Montgomery probably
couldn't have cared less how
pretty the win was. The aesthetic
value of a game depends on one's
perspective, and if Montgomery's
view was that it wasn't smooth,
and Keefe's was that it was a little
ugly now and then, how was OSU
coach Jim Anderson's view of

everything? We 11...
"That first half was probably
the worst half I've ever seen an
Oregon State team play," Ander
son said. He might have been
exaggerating a bit — after all, he's
been at OSU since 1965 — but
still, the Beavers weren't exactly
playing textbook (or comic book,
or any kind of book) basketball.
Playing without guard Will
Brantley (who averages 14 a game
but was out with an ankle injury),
the Cleavers shot a scintillating
26 percent (6 for 23) in the first
half, which was almost as bad as
Wally and the real Beav would
have done against the Cardinal.
They also handed the ball over 11
times (mostly on lousy passes),
giving them a stellar hoop-to
turnover ratio of .545. If OSU

Sophomore Marcus Lollie added seven points to this Saturday's total, helping Stanford eke out a 64-59
win against the Oregon State Beavers.
hadn't somehow forced a 16-16
standoff on the boards, they
would have been down by a heck
of a lot more than 33-23 at the
half.
"The referees let this game be
very physical, which is a typical
Stanford game," said Teo, who
took only two shots the entire
half. (Needless to say, one was an
airball.) "Stanford played a good
game — they executed exactly
what they were supposed to. In
the first half we didn't execute our
offense very well." To say the
least: After Chad Scott hit an 18-
footer to make the score 16-14
Stanford with 12 minutes left in
the half, the Beavers went six
whole minutes without scoring.
The drought might have killed

OSU 112 but Stanford wasn't really
working wonders at the other end.
Kenny Ammann nailed a three
with just under 11 minutes to go,
but over the next four minutes the
Cardinal managed only five
turnovers and about a zillion
missed shots to offset the Beavers'
zillion turnovers and five missed
shots.
Yuck. A TV timeout was called
with 7:21 left in the half — pre
sumably to let members of the
audience go throw up — and a
minute later Keefe grabbed a
rebound and slammed it home to
finally stop the ugliness. Keefe
then came up with a steal to feed
Deshon Wingate for a layup before
Scott hit another three to remind
the Beavers where the basket was.
The Cardinal got the lead up to
12 on a Williams 10-footer (after a
looong scramble for the ball that
left at least three players lying on
the floor) and took a 10-point lead

into the locker room — a lead that
would have been a little bigger
had the Stanford players remem
bered how to shoot free throws.
The Cardinal was 4 for 10 at the
line in the first half, and 10 for 23
overall. "We shot free throws like
a bunch of turkeys again," Mont
gomery said.
It didn't really matter, because
the Beavers were pretty fowl
themselves. (Oh, yuck!!!) The lead
got up to 18 in the second half
before OSU's pressure defense
started to work, but then things
got hairy. After Keefe hit a layup
to make it 53-35 with 9:33 left, the
Cardinal went into another cold
spell and OSU took a 10-0 ride for
the next four and a half minutes
"That's going to happen at
some point in the game," Keefe
said. "We just got in a little bit of a
rut." The rut was just deep
enough to let the Beavers get

within five with four minutes left,
but then John Patrick hit a huge
three (his only basket of the day)
from the left wing to get it back up
to eight.
"I don't think we're the type of
team that can get up by 18, then
28, then 38," Keefe said.
