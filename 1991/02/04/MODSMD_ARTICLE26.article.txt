This weekend's Shell Answer
Man award goes to Stanford's
Adam Keefe. Almost every time
the Oregon State Beavers scored a
basket in Saturday's Cardinal vic
tory, Keefe was there to answer
with two points of his own.
Keefe, now playing at strong
forward for Stanford, totaled 29
points on the afternoon, on 13-of
-16 shooting from the floor. He also
had eight rebounds, two assists,
two steals, and a block in his 36
minutes of action.
In addition to being very close
to unstoppable on offense, Keefe
held the Beavers' center Teo
Alibegovic to 11 points, his lowest
number in Pacific 10 Conference
games this year.
In the first half, Alibegovic did
not make a single shot from the
field and managed only two points
on two free throws. Oregon
State's offense was clearly dis
rupted by this inability to get
their leading scorer involved, and
the Beavers shot a woefull 26.1
percent from the field in the first
period.
"I was better on the stuff that
doesn't phow on paper than what
shows," Keefe said. "The most
important thing was playing Teo,
trying to keep him down."
"I thought Keefe did a good job
of keeping the ball away from Teo
by and large," Stanford Coach
Mike Montgomery said.
Alibegovic complained of being
mugged under the basket all
game, but still gave credit to
Keefe. Alibegovic shot only 4 of 12
on the game.
"With no doubt, Keefe is a pro
prospect," Alibegovic said. "He
can play with anyone. Defensively,
he needs attention 40 minutes."
With forward Andrew Vlahov
out for the rest of the season after
having surgery on an ankle, Keefe
now takes on the responsibility of

marking up with the other team's
best offensive threat down low.
Keefe said he was up to the chal
lenge.
"I don't know if I'm as good a
defensive player as Andrew but I
think I'm a pretty good player,"
Keefe said.
"For us to win, Keefe has to
play well," Montgomery said.
"And now he has the added pres
sure of taking the other guys' big
man on defense."
As far as Montgomery is con
cerned, Keefe's performances are
becoming so consistent that he
starts to take his star forward for
granted.
"You get to the point where you
almost expect every shot Keefe
takes to go in." Montgomery said.
"He's the constant."
Even when the team couldn't
seem to get the ball into Keefe
when he's trying to post up, Keefe
would get his points off of offen
sive rebounds. Keefe had five
offensive boards on the game, and
most of them came at times when
Stanford was having a dry spell
offensively.
"The thing about Adam is if it's
not one thing he does it's
another," Montgomery said. "He
gets offensive rebounds at a time
when we maybe can't get any
thing going."
Keefe said that he doesn't
notice an intensified effort on his
part to get offensive rebounds
when the team can't score, but he
does recognize that he needs to get
the ball at certain times.
"There gets to be a time when I
need to get the ball myself," Keefe
said. "And the way I can do that is
through offensive rebounding."
Oregon State Coach Jim
Anderson gave Keefe credit for a
"complete ballgame."
"He did everything they needed
to win," Anderson said. "Any time
(Keefe) receives an entry pass,
something usually good happens."
