# Stanford sweeps weekend series
## 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
Stanford baseball coach
Mark Marquess was worried
that he couldn't replace start
ing pitchers Mike Mussina and
Stan Spencer, but now he has a
new concern.
The top-ranked Cardinal
whitewashed No. 30 Fullerton
State this weekend in three
straight, but Stanford's start
ing pitching may have been too
good. Marquess now has the
tough, but enviable position of
deciding between near-perfect
pitchers when he selects his
final rotation.

Cardinal sweeps three
games from Titans

Stanford's starters at
Fullerton — senior John Reid,
sophomore Jamie Sepeda and
freshman Willie Adams —
allowed a total of one earned
run in the three-game sweep of
the Titans. Stanford, ranked
No. 1 by Collegiate Baseball,
improved to 6-0 on the year,
while the Titans sank to 1-3.
Now in the professional
baseball ranks, Mussina and
Spencer guided the 1990 Cardi
nal to a 59-12 record and a
third-place finish in the College
World Series, but during the
first six games in 1991 they
have hardly been needed.
When right-hander Brian
Sackinsky returns to the
lineup in two weeks, Marquess
may have a difficult time nam
ing a three-man rotation for
Pacific 10 Conference play.
Stanford opened the set Fri
day afternoon at Amerige Park
with a 5-2 win, won a 2-0 tacti
cal battle Saturday and closed
out the visit with a 12-4 bom
bardment yesterday afternoon.
Having proved itself on the
road, Stanford returns to
Sunken Diamond Tuesday to
start a colossal 13-game, 20-
day homestand, by far its
longest of the year. University
of the Pacific, the first of seven
guests, plays the Cardinal
Tuesday at 2 p.m.
Reid set the tone for the
series with his start Friday,
allowing just one Titan hit in

the first six innings. He tired
and allowed a run in the sev
enth, but by that point Stan
ford had built a 5-0 cushion.
Right fielder Steve Solomon
drew first blood, drubbing a
two-run double in the fifth.
Solomon and first baseman
David McCarty each had three
hits to pace the Cardinal
attack.
Reid, who won games in
both the West Regional and
World Series last year, is 2-0
and is expected to be the point
man for the pitching staff in
Six-Pac play.
But Sepeda and Adams have
been pleasant surprises for
Marquess and the Cardinal,
and their contributions will be
critical if Stanford is to outgun
third-ranked Arizona State for
the Six-Pac title.
Sepeda, a 6-foot-2 right
hander from Sinton, Texas, has
yet to allow an earned run in
his two starts. Saturday he
hurled six innings of six-hit,
shutout baseball as Stanford
clawed to a 2-0 win. McCarty
and center fielder Jeffrey Ham
monds notched solo home runs
in the second and eighth
innings, and that was all Stan
ford needed.
Junior right-hander Aaron
Dorlarque, who missed the end
of last year with a rotator cuff
injury, also looks ready to con
tribute in a middle or short
relief role. Dorlarque showed
some flames on his fastball
against Santa Clara, and
against Fullerton Saturday he
struck out five in three innings
of relief.
Adams, a 6-7 marauder,
walked four but allowed no
earned runs Sunday in his sec
ond win of the season. Adams
won his collegiate debut last
Wednesday against San Fran
cisco State and was able to
return to the hill against the
Titans.
Freshman left-hander
Andrew Lorraine was roughed
up in relief, allowing three
earned runs in less than an
inning of work, but by the time
Adams left the game Stanford
led 12-0. Sophomore Tim
Moore and Weiss combined to
hold Fullerton scoreless for the
rest of the game.
