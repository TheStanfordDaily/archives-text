# Cardinal stays undefeated in the Pac-10
## 
### David Hirning Senior staff writer 
February has just begun, but the Cardinal
women's basketball team is starting to think
about late March. The defending national
champions are anxious to begin the defense of
their title next month.
Stanford began gearing up for the postsea
son party early, showing tournament form in
two blowouts over the weekend. The Cardinal
completed its undefeated run through the first
half of the Pacific 10 Conference Friday with a
113-79 shellacking of California, then contin
ued to roll with an easy 81-67 victory over No.

Stanford (15-3, 9-0 in the Pac-10) showed
both its prodigious offense and stingy defense
in the two wins, setting a season high for
points Friday while holding the Lady Rebels to
their lowest output of the year on Saturday.
Even though the Cardinal cruised to its
ninth and 10th straight wins, Coach Tara Van-
Derveer continued to juggle her lineup and
refused to put her stamp of approval on the
efforts. This was partly due to a late UNLV
run that whittled a 30-point advantage down
to 10 with 40 seconds remaining, forcing the
Stanford coach to reinsert two starters.
"We played really well for 35 minutes," Van-
Derveer said after Saturday's win. "If we
hadn't let up for that little run, I'd be fat and
happy.'*
The Cardinal may have been slightly tired,
playing back-to-back games in two nights with
the latter contest against a rested UNLV team.
Stanford scheduled the games intentionally to
prepare for this year's similar Final Four
schedule, which takes place March 30-31.
This aside, the Cardinal was extremely
business-like in winning its 16th straight Pac
-10 game (nine this year) and its 40th and 41st
consecutive in Maples Pavilion Stanford Uni
versity Women's Basketball Team, Incorpo
rated.
Stanford dominated despite the fact that
VanDerveer took leading scorer Julie Zeilstra
out of the starting lineup in both games, opt
ing instead for sophomore forward Chris Mac-
Murdo. The move was prompted both by Mac-
Murdo's sterling play last weekend and Zeil
stra's practice performance.
Asked if Zeilstra would be back in the
lineup soon, VanDerveer responded, "Thats
depends on Julie. It's determined by (who
plays well in) practice. We're using a lot of dif
ferent lineups."
Zeilstra didn't stay out of either game for
long, and actually ended up topping the Cardi
nal's point totals each night. Perhaps slightly
inspired, the 6-foot-3 junior forward shot 13-
of-16 against the Golden Bears and had 29
points (including career No. 1,000), all in just
21 minutes. She came back the next night to
score 20 against the Lady Rebels.
"To be honest, I kind of liked coming in off
the bench," said Zeilstra. "I can add a spark to
the team, and it's easier to come in at the *3'

(small forward). I seriously wouldn't care if I
didn't start anymore."
She may not if MacMurdo continues to play
like she has. She continued her recent assault
on the boards, pulling down 17 rebounds over
the two contests, including 12 against the
Lady Rebels. Overall, Stanford had a great
weekend in the paint, outrebounding both
opponents easily (47-40 and 50-39) and getting

numerous layups.
The Cardinal sported an efficient, balanced
attack both nights, with five players in double
figures in each game. Stanford shot a blister
ing 57.3 percent Friday and a solid 46 percent
the following night.
"Our shooting percentage is what I like to

see," VanDerveer said about the
Golden Bear game. "Cal was out
of it early. Any time you shoot 57
percent, you're going to do pretty
well."
Stanford never trailed against
the Bears, and handed them their
fifth conference loss of the year. It
was the Cardinal's biggest win
ever against California, and its
largest margin of victory since it

beat BYU by 41 in December.
In the Rebels, Stanford beat a
team that had once been unde
feated and ranked No. 5 before
losing three straight in one eight
day stretch two weeks ago. UNLV
boasts speedy guards and a 6-
foot-6 center from Toronto, Mer
lelynn Lange, who leads the team
in scoring at nearly 14 points a
game.
Zeilstra, Val Whiting and
Trisha Stevens teamed to hold
the slow-moving Lange to just
four points on l-of-5 shooting,
and forced her into a fifth foul

with more than eight minutes
remaining.
UNLV head coach Jim Bolla
had loads of praise for the Cardi
nal, a team which he may get
another shot at if the Lady Rebels
make it to the West Regional they
host in March. Stanford is looking
to be there as a No. 1 seed, accord
ing to VanDerveer, and Bolla
thinks the Cardinal is good
enough despite a No. 8 ranking.
"I think they're a lot better
than what people rate them, and
how people perceive them," Bolla
said.

weekend in the paint, outrebounding both
opponents easily (47-40 and 50-39) and getting

numerous layups.
The Cardinal sported an efficient, balanced
attack both nights, with five players in double
figures in each game. Stanford shot a blister

the following night.

Golden Bear game. "Cal was out
of it early. Any time you shoot 57
percent, you're going to do pretty
well."
Stanford never trailed against
the Bears, and handed them their
fifth conference loss of the year. It
was the Cardinal's biggest win
ever against California, and its
largest margin of victory since it

beat BYU by 41 in December.
In the Rebels, Stanford beat a
team that had once been unde
feated and ranked No. 5 before
losing three straight in one eight
day stretch two weeks ago. UNLV
boasts speedy guards and a 6-
foot-6 center from Toronto, Mer
lelynn Lange, who leads the team
in scoring at nearly 14 points a
game.
Zeilstra, Val Whiting and
Trisha Stevens teamed to hold
the slow-moving Lange to just
four points on l-of-5 shooting,
and forced her into a fifth foul

with more than eight minutes
remaining.

another shot at if the Lady Rebels
make it to the West Regional they

thinks the Cardinal is good
enough despite a No. 8 ranking.

February has just begun, but the Cardinal
women's basketball team is starting to think
about late March. The defending national
champions are anxious to begin the defense of
their title next month.
Stanford began gearing up for the postsea
son party early, showing tournament form in
two blowouts over the weekend. The Cardinal
completed its undefeated run through the first
half of the Pacific 10 Conference Friday with a
113-79 shellacking of California, then contin
ued to roll with an easy 81-67 victory over No.

Stanford (15-3, 9-0 in the Pac-10) showed
both its prodigious offense and stingy defense
in the two wins, setting a season high for
points Friday while holding the Lady Rebels to
their lowest output of the year on Saturday.
Even though the Cardinal cruised to its
ninth and 10th straight wins, Coach Tara Van-
Derveer continued to juggle her lineup and
refused to put her stamp of approval on the
efforts. This was partly due to a late UNLV
run that whittled a 30-point advantage down
to 10 with 40 seconds remaining, forcing the
Stanford coach to reinsert two starters.
"We played really well for 35 minutes," Van-
Derveer said after Saturday's win. "If we
hadn't let up for that little run, I'd be fat and
happy.'*
The Cardinal may have been slightly tired,
playing back-to-back games in two nights with
the latter contest against a rested UNLV team.
Stanford scheduled the games intentionally to
prepare for this year's similar Final Four
schedule, which takes place March 30-31.
This aside, the Cardinal was extremely
business-like in winning its 16th straight Pac
-10 game (nine this year) and its 40th and 41st
consecutive in Maples Pavilion Stanford Uni

rated.
Stanford dominated despite the fact that
VanDerveer took leading scorer Julie Zeilstra
out of the starting lineup in both games, opt
ing instead for sophomore forward Chris Mac-
Murdo. The move was prompted both by Mac-
Murdo's sterling play last weekend and Zeil
stra's practice performance.
Asked if Zeilstra would be back in the
lineup soon, VanDerveer responded, "Thats
depends on Julie. It's determined by (who
plays well in) practice. We're using a lot of dif
ferent lineups."
Zeilstra didn't stay out of either game for
long, and actually ended up topping the Cardi
nal's point totals each night. Perhaps slightly
inspired, the 6-foot-3 junior forward shot 13-
of-16 against the Golden Bears and had 29
points (including career No. 1,000), all in just
21 minutes. She came back the next night to
score 20 against the Lady Rebels.
"To be honest, I kind of liked coming in off
the bench," said Zeilstra. "I can add a spark to
the team, and it's easier to come in at the *3'

(small forward). I seriously wouldn't care if I
didn't start anymore."
She may not if MacMurdo continues to play
like she has. She continued her recent assault
on the boards, pulling down 17 rebounds over
the two contests, including 12 against the
Lady Rebels. Overall, Stanford had a great
weekend in the paint, outrebounding both
opponents easily (47-40 and 50-39) and getting
