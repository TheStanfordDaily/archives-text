# Stanford lacks concentration: still shellacks Toreros
## 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
Probably the only way that the
Stanford men's tennis team was
going to lose its match against the
University of San Diego was if
they beat themselves, something
they nearly accomplished. After
strong opening set performances,
four out the six singles matches
went to three sets, creating some
temporary tension before the Car
dinal walked away with a 8-1 vic
tory.

Cardinal 8
Toreros 1

"To tell you the truth I wasn't
really happy during the second
sets," Stanford coach Dick Gould
said. "We have to play good smart
concentrated tennis, and we have
to maintain our intensity."
After Saturday's match against
UC-Irvine was canceled because
of rain, the Cardinal opened the
1991 season against a young San
Diego squad. A general lack of
concentration was evident as most
of the team cruised through their
first sets, but faltered in the sec
ond. Playing at No. 6, Freshman
Mike Flanagan had a roller
coaster match with Luke Fitzsim
mons as he won five straight
games to take his first set 6-2, but

lost the second 5-7 before
regrouping to win the third con
vincingly 6-2.
"I started out rolling, but then
I lost my concentration like
crazy," Flanagan said. "I wasn't

thinking about the match; I don't
know what I was thinking about."
At No. 6 singles, Vital Patel also
cruised to a first set victory before
running into trouble. The fresh
man was told to work on his net

game after the first set, and he
had some trouble getting into his
game before finally beating Akida
Mashaka 6-4, 4-6, 6-3.
"I'm still immature," Patel
said. "If I'm going to play, I have

to play my game."
Senior Jason Yee shared his
teammates problem, but was
never able to regroup. Playing J.J.
Shobar at No. 4, the All-American
had no problem taking the opener,
but his serve and volley left him in
the second set and he wound up
losing 6-3, 4-6, 6-7 (3-7).
"In the second set I lost all my
rhythm," Yee said. "It was a little
lack of concentration and inten
sity. I definitely had my chances, I
just didn't capitalize."
"I thought Jason got off to a
good start, but he let the other
guy stay in (the match)," Gould
said. "I liked the way he played
the first set though, it was good
solid tennis."
The same could not be said for
second seed Palmer. Unlike most
of his teamates the sophomore
started out slow, falling 0-3 to
Kevin Bradley before losing the
first set 3-6. Playing his usual
aggressive, attacking serve and
volley, Palmer had trouble making
shots in the first set.
"It's really easy to get down if
you don't make a lot of balls,"
Palmer said. "In the first set my
serving percentage was down and
I wasn't moving my feet well; I
was late on my groundstrokes and
my volleys. It was all in my feet."
Moving better after the opener,
Palmer was able to take the match
with strong 6-3, 6-2 victories in
the last sets. After the match,
Palmer blamed his slow start on

the time of the season.
"I haven't had a lot of match
experience at this point in the sea
son," Palmer said. "It is hard to
come out and play (agressively)
without being match tough."
Able to avoid the lapses that
plagued his teammates, No. 3
Glenn Solomon appeared very
match tough with a easy 6-1, 6-2
win over Matt Foote. After bat
tling the flu last week, the senior
looked surprisingly strong.
"It was good to get out,"
Solomon said. "I wasn't able to
play the last couple of days and I
had some nervous energy. I was
able to channel my energy and I
felt like I was dictating the
points."
Alex O'Brien had little trouble
at the first seed, beating Fredrik
Axsater 7-5, 6-3. O'Brien was
scheduled to also play doubles
with Yee, but Gould held the duo
out to allow more people into the
match. After the Cardinal swept
the doubles portion of the match
to end the competition under the
lights, Gould admitted that his
teams erratic play was not all that
bad.
"(The match) was good because
we were able to win the first sets
pretty decisively, and this allowed
us to let the guys work on other
parts of their game," Gould said.
"This might have messed up their
momentum, but it will help them
in the long run."
