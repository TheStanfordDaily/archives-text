# After S. Africa, a new divestment issue
## California wants University to sell $18 million in tobacco stocks 
### John Louie Staff writer 
To strengthen California's
anti-smoking campaign, State
Health Director Kenneth Kizer
has asked Stanford and other uni
versities in the state to consider
divesting their stock holdings
from tobacco companies.
The Board of Trustees has
been discussing tobacco divest
ment since last fall-end is consid
ering Kizer's proposal "as part of
the University's investment
responsibility process," according
to Barbara Benjamin-Trevino,
associate director of University
relations.
In a letter dated Jan. 15, Kizer
asked University President Don
ald Kennedy and the board to

"carefully consider whether con
tinued investment in these com
panies is consistent with various
public policies discouraging the
use of tobacco products."
Stanford holds about $18 mil
lion in stock of tobacco companies,
primarily Philip Morris Inc.
"Tobacco holdings make up a
small percentage of Stanford's
[total] endowment" of $2 billion,
Benjamin-Trevino said.
In his reply to Kizer on Jan. 25,
Kennedy wrote that both Stan
ford's Advisory Panel on Invest
ment Responsibility and the
Board of Trustees' Special Com
mittee on Investment Responsi
bility have been looking into the
matter and will present a recom
mendation on the issue later this
year.

The advisory panel consists of
students, faculty and several
trustees, while only trustees sit on
the special committee. The two
groups are independent of each
other and make recommendations
to the board.
The University reviews issues
of investment responsibility on a
"case-by-case basis, consistent
with the standards of due pro
cess," Kennedy wrote. "It is in
this context that the tobacco issue
is being reviewed," he added.
Benjamin-Trevino said the
University's examination of the
issue was prompted by a report
from the Investor Responsibility
Resource Center, an nationwide
organization.
Although Kizer is the first
state health official to publicly

advocate divestment of tobacco
company holdings, the issue has
been a growing national concern.
Last summer, Harvard University
and the City University of New
York became the first educational
institutions to sell their tobacco
company stock.
California voters in 1988
approved the Tobacco Tax and
Health Protection Act, which allo
cated $150 million to discourage
tobacco use and publicize its
health consequences. Kizer said
enforcing the initiative "should
lead to a more healthy and pro
ductive California in the future."
"This is analogous to South
African [divestment], I think, in
many ways," Kizer said.
Benjamin-Trevino said Stan
ford has divested from 10 compa
nies which had business opera
tions in South Africa since 1986,
including Newmont Mining,
Teneco and USX.
"In the investment responsibil
ity process, we look at a range of
social responsibility issues,
including South Africa, affirma
tive action and the environment.
Tobacco holdings are a fairly new
issue on the social issues invest
ment responsibility agenda," she
added.
According to Gwen Loosmore,
a staff member of the advisory
panel, decisions on divestment do
not depend on the amount of
money invested.
"Divestment is a last resort,"
Loosmore said. "It is [the Univer
sity's] policy to try and persuade
the companies to abandon the
hurtful or injurious action that
they are engaged in.
USC and several schools in the
University of California system
received similar letters from
Kizer.
