# Card swims past Arizona, unable to catch Arizona State
## 
### Amy Wusterbarth Staff writer 
The sun gods of the South
ignored their own this weekend
and instead sparked a wildfire of
blazing energy and radiant spirit
in the visiting Stanford swimming
team. The Cardinal men were hot.
They seared Arizona by a score of
144-97 on Friday in Tucson.
The win only fueled the Stan
ford flame. The following day
against Arizona State the Cardi
nal swimmers had seasonal bests
and lifetime bests in virtually
every event. Despite the record
breaking effort, they lost in the
last event to the Sun Devils 124-

119.
"We've got the attitude and the
team spirit back where it
belongs," said coach Skip Kenney.
"We traveled with the Stanford
pride that had been missing for
awhile."
Saturday the Cardinal faced a
Wildcat team which had been get
ting psyched up all season to swim
them, a Wildcat team which
seems to pride themselves on
their dual-meet record since they
historically are not very success
ful at NCAA Championships.
This did not intimidate Stan
ford, it actually got the men even
more fired up. "I've heard that
ASU doesn't like us, so we got

excited," said freshman Eddie
Parenti.
The Cardinal does not prepare
for dual meets but rather focuses
on NCAAs at the end of the sea
son. Because of this, the team
went in not expecting to win,
according to Ted Knapp, Stan
ford's assistant coach. "When we
did well and stayed with them, the
team spirit and unity really went
up," said Knapp.
"When we won the 200-yard
medley relay and the 1,650
(freestyle) we knew we'd have an
exciting meet." These two races
were important because they were
ones which the opposing coach,
Ron Johnson, had specifically
asked to race.
Usually in dual meets a 400
medley relay is used instead of a
200, and a 1,000 freestyle is used
instead of a 1,650. However, nei
ther the 400 medley relay nor the
1,000 freestyle are events at

NCAAs so by having the alternate
races in a dual meet, the athletes
get a chance to practice for post
season competition. The Stanford
coaches do not know exactly why
Johnson wanted to switch events
â€” if he was hoping to get more
points that way, it didn't work.
The Cardinal's 200 medley
relay team finished with a time of
1:29:76 which was almost as fast
as their time at NCAA competi
tion last year. Bill Schell, who
swam the fly leg of the relay had
his lifetime best in that race.
"ASU was my best meet so far,"
said Schell, "The whole team
came together. After training so
hard we're finally getting closer to
NCAAs. The adrenaline is pump

ing harder."
The 1,650 was also a great race
for Stanford. Alex Kostich won
the event and sprinter Andy Lloyd
placed fourth. "I had a pretty good
race," said Kostich, "I wanted to
win because I knew the team
needed the points."
Kenney noted Lloyd's out
standing performance in the race.
Lloyd, a junior, had never com
peted in this event but because
points are awarded for the top five
places, Kenney hoped that Lloyd
could get fourth place. After 66
lengths of the pool the sprinter
captured fourth place by .08 sec
onds. "We're very, very proud of
him. We needed him in an event
he probably hasn't done since
high school."
Other outstanding perfor
mances included Erik Maurer's
triple win in the freestyle events
at both Arizona and Arizona State
and Jeff Rouse's phenomenal 200

individual medley at Arizona
State. He was two seconds faster
than last year's unshaved time,
and missed first place by .05 sec
onds.
The divers also made a sensa
tional splash down in the desert.
Brad Wightman won both events
both days and freshman Darryl
Sagel had two third place finishes
at Arizona and a third and fourth
at Arizona State. "The divers
were a big part of the successes
this weekend," said Knapp.
This Friday and Saturday the
men face another tough contin
gent from the south. UCLA and
USC will travel up to the Farm to
face Stanford and a big Cardinal
crowd at deGuerre pool. Next
weekend is also special because it
is Parents' Weekend for the swim
mers. The team will need a couple
more red-hot performances like
the ones in Arizona to crush the
Bruins and No. 2-ranked Trojans.
