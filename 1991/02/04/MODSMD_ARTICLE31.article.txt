# Understudy holds court: center stage
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
The star of the big Broadway
production sits in her dressing
room looking something awful.
Her nose begins to twitch, she
reaches for a tissue and... ah-ah
ah choo!
Suddenly, the director bursts
through the dressing room door.
"You can't go on?"
"No chance, boss," she replies.
Frantic, he heads down the hall
to a tiny dressing room. There is
no star on the door. He knocks,
enters and says to the timid
understudy: "Kid, you're going
on."
"B-b-but..."
"No buts about it,"he inter
rupts, "you're gonna be a star."
In the magical world of Holly
wood movies, the kid then steps
onto center stage and blows away
the crowd. The question Friday
was whether Kelly Fisher, the
understudy in this story, could
muster enough Hollywood with
her tennis racket to bring down
the house. Women's tennis coach
Frank Brennan, our director, was
counting on it.
Sure enough, the junior from
Boulder, Colo, did just that. Play
ing nearly five hours worth of ten
nis in her first collegiate match,
Fisher recorded comeback wins in
singles and doubles as the Cardi
nal shut out visiting Washington,
9-0, to move its season mark to 4-
0. Stanford's 69th straight win
dating back to 1988 dropped the
Husky women to 2-2.
The day began innocently
enough for Stanford, which was

Women's Tennis

Cardinal 9
Huskies 0

playing without Sandra Birch,
Debbie Graham and Heather Wil
lens. At No. 1 singles Teri
Whitlinger easily downed Mary
Reilly, 6-1, 6-0. Freshman Laxmi
Poruri did Whitlinger one better,
literally, by recording a 6-0, 6-0
shellacking of Rhonda Fox.
"This, I thomjht, was really a
great match, said,
pointing to the Poruri-Fox
encounter in the scorebook.
Similar results for the Cardinal
came at third and fourth singles
where Kylie Johnson beat Susan
Cahoon 6-1, 6-1 and Mario Car
ruth handed Lisa Hinckley 6-2, 6-
0. Emma Woodhouse made her
Stanford singles debut at No. 5
where she took apart Michelle
Thomas 6-2, 6-3.
"I thought I played really well
today, except in a couple of
patches," the freshman Wood
house said. Well enough that she
finished her match soon after
Fisher began her second set with
Andrea Pollock.
The Washington No. 6 had
taken the first set off a nervous
Fisher 6-2. But the newest mem
ber of the Cardinal dynasty was
not about to let her debut be a los
ing one. She fought back to take a
leads of 2-1 and 3-2 in the second
set.
Pollock then responded with a
hold and service break to move up
4-3. At 5-5, Fisher answered with
a pivotal break of her own and

took the set 7-5. Still not appear
ing totally at ease, Fisher was nev
ertheless able to open the third set
with a break — winning her
fourth straight game in the pro
cess.
Down 3-5, Pollock was unable
to hold serve and Fisher walked
away with a marathon 2-6, 7-5, 6-
3 victory. So what could she do for
an encore?
While her singles drama in
three acts wore on, the Cardinal's
No. 1 and 2 doubles tandem each
posted easy wins. Poruri and
Whitlinger dropped Fox and Reilly
6-3, 6-0. Carruth and Johnson
bested Hinckley and Becky Clay
ton 6-1, 6-1.
The only thing left on the slate
was third doubles where Fisher
and Woodhouse were set to meet
Pollock and Thomas. With the
meet score at 8-0, though, and a
cold, dark evening setting in, it
seemed likely the match would be
canceled.
But that wouldn't make for
very good theater, would it? So
they played and Fisher and Wood
house quickly jumped ahead 4-0.
Almost as quickly Pollock and
Thomas had close to withing 5-4.
Though the Husky duo lost the
set 6-4, they clearly had captured
the momentum.
In a whirlwind second set, the
Washingtonians shut out the Car
dinal and seemed to be on their
way. Woodhouse and Fisher were
floundering and didn't seem to
have too much incentive. But
instead of packing it in, they
began to battle back. Fisher held
to knot the set at 4-4 and then the
Stanford pair got a break and the

lead.
The Huskies broke back before
the Cardinal answered with yet
another break. Ahead 6-5, Stan
ford had Fisher serving for the
match. Despite two double faults,
she was serving match point at
40-30. Woodhouse put away a
winner and Stanford was victori
ous.
"I was very nervous, it was
apparent in my singles," Fisher
said of her debut. "It's fun to be
out here. I never thought I would
be.
"I'm proud that I won both my
matches, I would've felt bad if I
was the only person to lose."
Instead she felt pretty good,
having been a double winner.
When the walk-on was asked if
one day in the limelight was
enough for her, she responded
negatively. "I want to play again
and play better," Fisher said.
Card notes
During Fisher's singles match, a
large crowd gathered to watch the
action on the back courts. While many
were no doubt interested in the out
come, it was clear many were enjoying
the action between sophomore Jared
Palmer and former Stanford star
Tim Mayotte.
Mayotte, who played here a decade
ago, was in town preparing for the
Volvo event in San Francisco this
week.
Five Stanford players — Birch,
Graham, Whitlinger, Poruri and Wil
lens — are headed for Minneapolis to
take part in the Rolex National Indoor
Tournament. Stanford's next dual
meet is Feb. 15 against San Diego

and play better," Fisher said.

During Fisher's singles match, a
large crowd gathered to watch the
action on the back courts. While many
were no doubt interested in the out
come, it was clear many were enjoying
the action between sophomore Jared
Palmer and former Stanford star
Tim Mayotte.
Mayotte, who played here a decade
ago, was in town preparing for the
Volvo event in San Francisco this
week.

Junior Kelly Fisher, playing in her first collegiate match, recorded
comeback wins in singles and doubles as the Cardinal shut out vis
iting Washington, 9-0. The Cardinal played Friday without Sandra
Birch, Debbie Graham and Heather Widens.
The star of the big Broadway
production sits in her dressing
room looking something awful.
Her nose begins to twitch, she
reaches for a tissue and... ah-ah
ah choo!
Suddenly, the director bursts
through the dressing room door.
"You can't go on?"
"No chance, boss," she replies.
Frantic, he heads down the hall
to a tiny dressing room. There is
no star on the door. He knocks,
enters and says to the timid
understudy: "Kid, you're going
on."
"B-b-but..."
"No buts about it,"he inter
rupts, "you're gonna be a star."
In the magical world of Holly
wood movies, the kid then steps
onto center stage and blows away
the crowd. The question Friday
was whether Kelly Fisher, the
understudy in this story, could
muster enough Hollywood with
her tennis racket to bring down
the house. Women's tennis coach
Frank Brennan, our director, was
counting on it.
Sure enough, the junior from
Boulder, Colo, did just that. Play
ing nearly five hours worth of ten
nis in her first collegiate match,
Fisher recorded comeback wins in
singles and doubles as the Cardi
nal shut out visiting Washington,
9-0, to move its season mark to 4-
0. Stanford's 69th straight win
dating back to 1988 dropped the
Husky women to 2-2.
The day began innocently
enough for Stanford, which was

Women's Tennis

Cardinal 9
Huskies 0

playing without Sandra Birch,
Debbie Graham and Heather Wil
lens. At No. 1 singles Teri
Whitlinger easily downed Mary
Reilly, 6-1, 6-0. Freshman Laxmi
Poruri did Whitlinger one better,
literally, by recording a 6-0, 6-0
shellacking of Rhonda Fox.
"This, I thomjht, was really a
great match, said,
pointing to the Poruri-Fox
encounter in the scorebook.
Similar results for the Cardinal
came at third and fourth singles
where Kylie Johnson beat Susan
Cahoon 6-1, 6-1 and Mario Car
ruth handed Lisa Hinckley 6-2, 6-
0. Emma Woodhouse made her
Stanford singles debut at No. 5
where she took apart Michelle
Thomas 6-2, 6-3.
"I thought I played really well
today, except in a couple of
patches," the freshman Wood
house said. Well enough that she
finished her match soon after
Fisher began her second set with
Andrea Pollock.
The Washington No. 6 had
taken the first set off a nervous
Fisher 6-2. But the newest mem
ber of the Cardinal dynasty was
not about to let her debut be a los
ing one. She fought back to take a
leads of 2-1 and 3-2 in the second
set.
Pollock then responded with a
hold and service break to move up
4-3. At 5-5, Fisher answered with
a pivotal break of her own and

took the set 7-5. Still not appear
ing totally at ease, Fisher was nev
ertheless able to open the third set
with a break — winning her
fourth straight game in the pro
cess.
Down 3-5, Pollock was unable
to hold serve and Fisher walked
away with a marathon 2-6, 7-5, 6-
3 victory. So what could she do for
an encore?
While her singles drama in
three acts wore on, the Cardinal's
No. 1 and 2 doubles tandem each
posted easy wins. Poruri and
Whitlinger dropped Fox and Reilly
6-3, 6-0. Carruth and Johnson
bested Hinckley and Becky Clay
ton 6-1, 6-1.
The only thing left on the slate
was third doubles where Fisher
and Woodhouse were set to meet
Pollock and Thomas. With the
meet score at 8-0, though, and a
cold, dark evening setting in, it
seemed likely the match would be
canceled.
But that wouldn't make for
very good theater, would it? So
they played and Fisher and Wood
house quickly jumped ahead 4-0.
Almost as quickly Pollock and
Thomas had close to withing 5-4.
Though the Husky duo lost the
set 6-4, they clearly had captured
the momentum.
In a whirlwind second set, the
Washingtonians shut out the Car
dinal and seemed to be on their
way. Woodhouse and Fisher were
floundering and didn't seem to
have too much incentive. But
instead of packing it in, they
began to battle back. Fisher held
to knot the set at 4-4 and then the
Stanford pair got a break and the

lead.
The Huskies broke back before
the Cardinal answered with yet
another break. Ahead 6-5, Stan
ford had Fisher serving for the
match. Despite two double faults,
she was serving match point at
40-30. Woodhouse put away a
winner and Stanford was victori
ous.
"I was very nervous, it was
apparent in my singles," Fisher
said of her debut. "It's fun to be
out here. I never thought I would
be.
"I'm proud that I won both my
matches, I would've felt bad if I
was the only person to lose."
Instead she felt pretty good,
having been a double winner.
When the walk-on was asked if
one day in the limelight was
enough for her, she responded
negatively. "I want to play again
and play better," Fisher said.
