# Women down USC and UCLA
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
If there were any questions as
to how good the Stanford
women's swim team is, they were
answered in a hurry this weekend.
The Cardinal, ranked second
nationally, hosted No. 4 USC and
No. 5 UCLA over the weekend.
But instead of showing respect for
two highly ranked foes, the Cardi
nal played the rude host, routing
both schools.
The Trojans actually won the
200-yard medley relay to open Fri
day's meet, but Stanford was
quick to respond. With American
record-holder Janet Evans sitting
out the race, the Cardinal still
went one-two-three in the 1,650
freestyle, the meet's first individ
ual contest.
Barb Metz and Karen Kraemer
both recorded NCAA qualifying
times in that race and freshman
Sionainn Marcoux completed the
sweep. Despite a pair of strange
disqualifications to two of the

team's top swimmers, Stanford
still won 12 of the 14 individual
races en route to a 193-105 win.
Saturday things went about
the same. The Bruins won a total
of two races and were crushed
216-82. Stanford improved to 7-0
overall on the season and is now 4-
0 in the Pacific 10 Conference.
The Cardinal has now won 22 con
secutive dual meets and is 21-0 in
coach Richard Quick's three-year
tenure.
"I was real pleased," Quick said
after the weekend's meets. "We
have seven weeks to go before the
NCAA Championships and I just
think our team is in real good
position if we continue to get bet
ter in every phase.... This week
end helped us establish some
momentum toward meeting our
goals."

The meets were also the final
home contests for four Cardinal
seniors. Metz, Suzy Buckovich,
Michelle Griglione and Jody
Smith all finished up the home
portion of their careers, combin
ing to win a total of six races.
"It's sad, just because it's the
end of a period of my life,"
Griglione said. "But I look back on
the period warmly — all the peo
ple I met. . .
The highlights of Friday's
meets were the NCAA qualifying
times posted by Metz and Krae
mer in the 1,650 freestyle, by
Buckovich in the 100 butterfly
and by Janel Jorgensen in the 100
backstroke and the 400 individual
medley, two events she doesn't
normally swim.
As a freshman last year, Jor
gensen qualified for NCAAs in an
amazing seven different events (a
swimmer may only swim three
events at the meet) and is well on
her way to repeating that feat.
