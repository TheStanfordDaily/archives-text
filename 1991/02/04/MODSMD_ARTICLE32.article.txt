# Women down USC and UCLA
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
If there were any questions as
to how good the Stanford
women's swim team is, they were
answered in a hurry this weekend.
The Cardinal, ranked second
nationally, hosted No. 4 USC and
No. 5 UCLA over the weekend.
But instead of showing respect for
two highly ranked foes, the Cardi
nal played the rude host, routing
both schools.
The Trojans actually won the
200-yard medley relay to open Fri
day's meet, but Stanford was
quick to respond. With American
record-holder Janet Evans sitting
out the race, the Cardinal still
went one-two-three in the 1,650
freestyle, the meet's first individ
ual contest.
Barb Metz and Karen Kraemer
both recorded NCAA qualifying
times in that race and freshman
Sionainn Marcoux completed the
sweep. Despite a pair of strange
disqualifications to two of the

Women's Swimming

Cardinal 193, Trojans 105
Cardinal 216, Bruins 82

team's top swimmers, Stanford
still won 12 of the 14 individual
races en route to a 193-105 win.
Saturday things went about
the same. The Bruins won a total
of two races and were crushed
216-82. Stanford improved to 7-0
overall on the season and is now 4-
0 in the Pacific 10 Conference.
The Cardinal has now won 22 con
secutive dual meets and is 21-0 in
coach Richard Quick's three-year
tenure.
"I was real pleased," Quick said
after the weekend's meets. "We
have seven weeks to go before the
NCAA Championships and I just
think our team is in real good
position if we continue to get bet
ter in every phase.... This week
end helped us establish some
momentum toward meeting our
goals."

The meets were also the final
home contests for four Cardinal
seniors. Metz, Suzy Buckovich,
Michelle Griglione and Jody
Smith all finished up the home
portion of their careers, combin
ing to win a total of six races.
"It's sad, just because it's the
end of a period of my life,"
Griglione said. "But I look back on
the period warmly — all the peo
ple I met. . .
The highlights of Friday's
meets were the NCAA qualifying
times posted by Metz and Krae
mer in the 1,650 freestyle, by
Buckovich in the 100 butterfly
and by Janel Jorgensen in the 100
backstroke and the 400 individual
medley, two events she doesn't
normally swim.
As a freshman last year, Jor
gensen qualified for NCAAs in an
amazing seven different events (a
swimmer may only swim three
events at the meet) and is well on
her way to repeating that feat.

Pam Minthorn took Saturday's 200 butterfly, adding to this weekend's victories against No. 4 USC and
No. 5 UCLA.
She also won the 100 freestyle Fri
day as well as the 50 freestyle and
100 butterfly Saturday.
In another display of versatil
ity, butterflier Summer Sanders
won the 100 breaststroke Friday
and the 200 and 100 breaststrokes
Saturday. On Saturday sopho
more Janet Evans won the 1,000
freestyle, the 200 backstroke and
the 500 freestyle, all with ease, to
lead the way.
Freshman diver Eileen Rich
etelli also had a banner weekend,
winning both the one- and three
meter events in each meet.
Other winners for Stanford
were Dede Trimble in Friday's
200 backstroke and Pam Min
thorn in Saturday's 200 butterfly.
"Everybody swam really well,"
Metz said. "We're still working
hard — I don't know what the dif
ference is from last weekend.
Everything seemed to click. ... A
lot of people were really close to
(NCAA) cuts here. That should
get us up for next week."
"Next week" is the biggest of
the regular season as the Cardinal
travels to Austin to meet No. 1
Texas Friday night. The two
schools have combined to win the
last eight NCAA titles. Stanford
has won the teams' dual meet
handily in each of the past two
years, but the Lady Longhorns
upset the Cardinal to capture last
season's NCAA title.
"It's going to be extremely
close," Griglione said. "I think it's
going to be tougher than in the
last few years. I think we're really
going to have to come through in
our strong points."

In another display of versatil
ity, butterflier Summer Sanders
won the 100 breaststroke Friday
and the 200 and 100 breaststrokes
Saturday. On Saturday sopho
more Janet Evans won the 1,000
freestyle, the 200 backstroke and
the 500 freestyle, all with ease, to
lead the way.
Freshman diver Eileen Rich
etelli also had a banner weekend,
winning both the one- and three
meter events in each meet.
Other winners for Stanford
were Dede Trimble in Friday's
200 backstroke and Pam Min
thorn in Saturday's 200 butterfly.
"Everybody swam really well,"
Metz said. "We're still working
hard — I don't know what the dif
ference is from last weekend.
Everything seemed to click. ... A
lot of people were really close to
(NCAA) cuts here. That should
get us up for next week."
"Next week" is the biggest of
the regular season as the Cardinal
travels to Austin to meet No. 1
Texas Friday night. The two
schools have combined to win the
last eight NCAA titles. Stanford
has won the teams' dual meet
handily in each of the past two
years, but the Lady Longhorns
upset the Cardinal to capture last
season's NCAA title.
"It's going to be extremely
close," Griglione said. "I think it's
going to be tougher than in the
last few years. I think we're really
going to have to come through in
our strong points."
