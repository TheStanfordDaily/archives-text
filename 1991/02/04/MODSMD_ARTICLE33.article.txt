### Kevin Jeffery Staff writer 
The Stanford men's volleyball
team got their sweep, but the
Hawaii Rainbows weren't
whisked away easily in a pair of
weekend WIVA matches at Burn
ham Pavilion.
The Cardinal prevailed Friday
night in three straight games, 15-
6, 15-13 and 15-9. Saturday they
completed the sweep with a
thrilling four-game triumph by
the scores of 15-7, 6-15, 16-14 and
15-2.

The wins gave fifth-ranked
Stanford the best record in the
Western Intercollegiate Volleyball
Association at 4-0 and they lead
Long Beach State by one-half
game in the Harry Wilson divi
sion. Including a non-league loss
to USC and a win over BYU, their
overall record stands at 5-1.
Hawaii dropped to 0-3 and 1-4
overall, and the llth-ranked
Rainbows are entrenched in the
Wilson basement.
The Cardinal jumped on
Hawaii early in Friday's match,
finishing off the first game with a
five-point run, and taking an early
6-0 advantage in the second. But
from that point, the Rainbows
stopped playing like a team who
lost all six of its 1990 starters to
graduation.
Behind the inside blocking of
Rico Guimares and Larsen Vil
iamu, Hawaii went on a 7-1 run to
tie the game. Hawaii took advan
tage of Stanford's abundance of
service errors and kept close until
a Mike Lowe solo block gave the
Cardinal a 15-13 win, and an
insurmountable two games to
none lead.
In the third game outside hit
ters Dave Goss and Bob Hillman,
who led the Cardinal attack with
20 and 14 kills, respectively,
answered Hawaii's improving hit
ting efficiency. After the Rainbows
had drawn close, another 5-0 run,
this time behind the ferocious
jump serving of Duncan Black

man, gave Stanford their third
WIVA victory.
Stanford Coach Ruben Nieves
was impressed with Hawaii's
blocking scheme which focused on
the Cardinal's relatively weak
inside attack, but said that the key
to Friday's match was Stanford's
ability to pull away at the end of
each game.
"You so often see that in a
young team, they play tough early
but can't put away the game at
the end. We have a definite experi
ence advantage, and tonight we
just made the plays when we had
to," Nieves said.
Still the Cardinal entered the
weekend with a sweep in mind
and, as Nieves said, Hawaii has a
long-standing reputation for
being able to completely turn
around a matchup in one night.
"We're never surprised to see
Hawaii play us really tough.
They've got a lot of great athletes
and they're capable of always
putting together a strong match,"
said Hillman.
"We knew that they would
come out with a much different
look in the second match, we just
didn't know what it would be. The
only thing predictable about
Hawaii is that they're unpre
dictable," he said.
Hawaii fulfilled that expecta
tion, changing their serving order,
and blocking schemes, not to men
tion the tint of their neon uni
forms. Stanford tried to combat
that with an game plan that fea
tured the powerful outside hitting
of Goss, Blackman and Hillman,
and a lot of deception on the
inside.
Sophomore Jimmy Blackman
replaced freshman Canyon
Ceman at setter and his ability to
find the holes in the Rainbow
blocking pattern was instrumen
tal to Stanford taking the first
game. But the passing game of
Hawaii turned the tables in the
second game, as the Rainbows
were getting sideouts on virtually
every Cardinal serve. Guimares
also had his best hitting game of
the match and Hawaii cruised, 15-
6.
"They really showed us their
offensive potential in the second
game. If they are passing and set
ting well, they're going to be hard

to stop," said Nieves.
Hawaii looked ready to take
absolute control of the match
when they overcame the dominat
ing cross-court hitting of Goss to
take 14-11 lead in the riveting

third game. But consistent play
from non-starters Ceman and
especially middle blocker John
Hribar (3 blocks) contributed to

With 14 kills, outside hitter Bob Hillman helped lead the Cardinal
against Hawaii this weekend.
