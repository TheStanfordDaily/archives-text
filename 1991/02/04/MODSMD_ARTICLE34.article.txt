The night did not start well
for the Cardinal. In the 118-
pound match, sophomore
starter Phil Nowick (7-9-0 on
the year) and his backup, fresh
man Ramy Saad (2-2-0) were
both sidelined, forcing into
action Jim Montoya. The
sophomore, wrestling the first
collegiate match of his career,
suffered a technical fall loss.
At 126, Jay Jackson (13-12-
0) wrestled a tough match, but
lost by a score of 3-2.
Lance Johnson also wrestled
well, but came up short. The
freshman 134-pounder lost by
a score of 9-6.
Down 11-0, Stanford des
perately needed a victory at
142 to turn things around,
according to coach Chris Hor
pel. "Momentum had become a
factor in their favor, and there
was definitely a home crowd
attitude in the stands (the
match was held in Chico)."
Senior James Dinette, the
Stanford 142-pounder, started
off his bout slowly. The Chico
wrestler scored a quick take
down, and held Dinette to the
mats for the majority of the
first period. However, Dinette
(15-11-0) regrouped, and by
the third period, was in control,
scoring a 17-8 mcyor decision
victory.

Dave Sacks continued the
turnaround for the Cardinal at
150. The junior was taken
down and almost choked out on
the first move of the match, a
move which Horpel said
"started out as a legal hold, and
ended as an illegal one."
Sacks, behind by a score of
5-0 at the end of the first
round, did not let the early
takedown frustrate him,
pulling out a 7-5 win. He
improved his record to 10-10-1.
Matt Topham, at 158
pounds, scored a gritty 7-3 vic
tory. The junior, bothered all
season by a painful rotator cuff
shoulder injury, was facing
Chico's Scott Horrill, a smart
wrestler who had finished sec
ond last weekend in the 16-
team All-California Invita
tional. Topham was bothered
by the shoulder in warm-ups,
but did an excellent job of
avoiding the use of it in
improving his record to 5-4-0.
With the Chico lead nar
rowed to 11-10 and co-captains
Steve Buddie and Steve
Yarbrough up next, Stanford
had the match well in hand.
Buddie scored a pin at the 3:59
mark of his 167-pound bout in
improving his record to 22-2-0.
With the win, the senior stands
alone atop the all-time Cardi
nal career wrestling victory list
with 102.
Yarbrough had no trouble at
all in winning his 177-pound
match by the score of 8-2. The
senior picked up his team-lead
ing 24th victory in the process.
Mark Graham pinned his
man with his first move of the
night, only 18 seconds into the
190-pound event. Graham, 14-
4-0 on the year, has not lost
since winter break.
According to Horpel, the
three middle weight classes
were the key to victory. "I
expected to win the upper
classes (167-177-190) handily,"
said the coach. "Our three mid
dle weights definitely wrestled,
and won, the pivotal matches."
