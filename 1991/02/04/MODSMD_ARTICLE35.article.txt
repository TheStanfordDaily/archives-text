# Card gymnasts come back
## 
### Noah Blake Staff writer 
Halfway through last Friday
night's meet in Tempe, Ariz., the
Stanford men's gymnastics team
had dug itself into a large hole.
The Cardinal was down eight
tenths of a point to host Arizona
State, despite the efforts of sopho
more Ail-American Jair Lynch,
who had won the floor exercise
and pommel horse, two of the first
three events.
Stanford coach Sadao Hamada,
who blamed three falls on the
pommel horse for the team's large
deficit, gathered the Cardinal
around him for a pep talk.
"I told them that to win we
would have to hit everything,"
said Hamada, who then went on
to discuss strategy with his team.
After Hamada finished, according
to freshman Chris Sey, "He looked
up and said, 'We're a tight team,
and it belongs to us."'

Cardinal 276.45
Sun Devils 275.40

responded in the competition's
fourth event, the vault. Led by
freshman Marc Booth's first place
score of 9.65, they shaved three
tenths of a point off of ASU's lead.
Stanford's performance in this
event was particularly satisfying
for Hamada, because the team has
not been scoring as high as he
would like on the vault.
"We don't have all the tricks
that we need yet," Hamada
remarked, "so even when we hit
our routines, we don't score that
high. But we have been improving
in this event."
While the Cardinal showed
improved performance on one of
their weaker events in the fourth
rotation, they demonstrated their
dominance in the fifth on perhaps
their strongest event, the parallel

bars. Led by another first place
score from Lynch, who won the
all-around competition by over a
point and a hcdf, Stanford blitzed
the Sun Devils with an 1.05 point
swing and seized the lead.
The final event, the high bar,
posed a serious threat to the Stan
ford lead because of its difficulty
on the release moves, but the Car
dinal managed to hold on. "ASU
was making a surge," said Lynch,
"and we knew that we needed to
score big."
And score big they did. "We
caught all our release moves,"
Hamada said, "scored a 46.70, our
highest total of the season on high
bar, and pulled away to win by
1.35 points. I am very proud of the
guys."
"Later in the season we will
face tougher competition, espe
cially in the Pac-lOs and NCAAs,"
Hamada continued, "and the
valuable lessons that we learn in
meets like these will help us a lot
then."
