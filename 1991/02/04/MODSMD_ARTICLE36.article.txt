Philosophy Prof. Emeritus
John Mothershead died at his
campus home Wednesday, Jan. 30,
following a series of strokes. He
was 82.
Known as a modest, unassum
ing professor who was extraordi
narily popular with students,
Mothershead specialized in teach
ing large undergraduate introduc
tory courses on logic and the his
tory of philosophy.
Mothershead's family and col
leagues said the professor's popu
larity stemmed partly from a
strong commitment to students.
"He cared, and communicated
this to everyone he came in con
tact with," said his son, Lee Moth
ershead.
"He was very systematic, very
attentive to students' questions
and problems," said Philosophy
Prof. Patrick Suppes. Mother
shead, who held office hours every
day, did not do much research
because he wanted to focus on
teaching, Suppes added.

At the end of the 1973-74 aca
demic year, when a University pol
icy forced Mothershead to retire,
students quickly gathered more
than 1,000 signatures and suc
cessfully petitioned that he con
tinue teaching.
Nancy Steege, an administra
tor for the Philosophy and Reli
gious Studies Departments, said
the outpouring of student support
was especially remarkable
because it occurred during Dead
Week.
"I've never seen anybody who
was that well-loved," Steege said,
adding that "he was like a gentle
grandfather, but a very smart
grandfather."
Mothershead often returned to
the faculty during the 1970s to
teach introductory philosophy as
well as smaller seminars. At the
end of his last seminar course, his
students created a thank-you card
which included a paragraph from
each student.
The students gave Mother

shead the card because "they rec
ognized him as someone they
knew they should treasure,"
Steege said.
After earning his bachelor's
and master's degrees at Stanford
in 1930 and 1933, Mothershead
returned to join the faculty in
1941.
For a period during the lean
years of World War 11, Mother
shead served as professor, secre
tary, janitor and air-raid warden
for the Philosophy Department.
In 1964, Mothershead received
the Dinkelspiel Award for service
to undergraduate education. The
citation noted his contribution to
"intellectual enthusiasm and
breadth of outlook through years
of brilliant and effective lectures
on philosophy to thousands of
undergraduates from all depart
ments of the University."
Mothershead was also the
author of "Ethics: Modern Con
ceptions of the Principles of
Right."
