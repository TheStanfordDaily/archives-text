# Possible Gulf weapons discussed
## 
### Peter Cousins Staff writer 
Professors from Stanford and other universities
addressed the different effects of nuclear, chemical
and biological warfare — from the political to the
medical — at a conference at the School of Medicine
Saturday.
Titled "Modern Warfare: Nuclear, Chemical, Bio
logical — Medical Aspects, Societal Effects," the
annual conference had a slightly different focus this
year because of the war in the Persian Gulf. The pro
gram addressed topics relevant to the current war,
from the U.S. nuclear arsenal to the history of chem
ical and biological warfare.
About 40 students attended the conference, which
was held in Fairchild Auditorium. The program was
also watched by about 10 Medical Center staff.
Prof. Theodore Postol of MIT talked about the
immediate effects of a nuclear weapon attack, which
he said are harder to predict than are those of a con
ventional war.
Scholars are reassessing how nuclear weapons
actually inflict damage, Postol said. "Most damage is
caused by fire [ignited by the blast], although mili
tary planners in the past did not recognize this," he

said.
Rodney McElroy, a graduate student at the Uni
versity of Sussex in England, analyzed the history
and mechanics of chemical and biological warfare.
He said they are especially dangerous because there
is "no operational limit" for their use — meaning
they can easily be delivered by missile, artillery shell
or other means.
The conference also explored current security
issues. Political Science Prof. David Hollo way raised
the question of what international conditions will be
like after the resolution of the Persian Gulf war and
challenged the audience to review the implications of
nuclear and chemical weapons on the future interna
tional order.
Program moderator Jeffrey Croke, a Stanford
specialist in internal medicine, said he was very
pleased with the colloquium. He said he became
involved in the conference three years ago when he
"realized the role of physicians as ecologists."
Croke is a member of Physicians for Social
Responsibility, a nationwide organization which
addresses the threat of nuclear war from a medical
perspective.
