# Sprinklers douse dumpster blaze
## 
### Howard Libit Staff writer 
A small fire broke out late
Friday night in the dumpster
between Madera and Okada,
but an automatic sprinkler sys
tem prevented the fire from
spreading into the two dormi
tories.
When the Palo Alto Fire
Department arrived at about
11:30 p.m., the dumpster —
located at the bottom of a
garbage chute between the two
buildings — was already filled
with almost 500 gallons of
water, firefighter Bruce Brous
sard said.
"Chalk one up for the fire
sprinkler system," Broussard
added. "It is like having three
firemen down there ready to
put the fire out."
However, the fire depart
ment could not determine the
cause of the fire because there
was so much water in the
dumpster, Broussard said.
Smoke from the fire seeped
into Okada through open win
dows, setting off smoke alarms
and forcing residents to evacu
ate. Although several people in
Madera said they did smell
smoke, the alarm was never

activated and few students
realized there was a fire out
side.
Santa Clara County fire
ordinances require campus
buildings with garbage chutes
emptying into a dumpster to
have a sprinkler head at the top
of the chute and several around
the dumpster at the bottom. In
taller buildings, a heat-sensi
tive catch automatically closes
a door between the chute and
the dumpster in case of fire,
Broussard said.
The garbage chute needs to
be protected by sprinklers
because it is one of the few ver
tical openings in every floor
and a fire could spread quickly
through it, Broussard said.
Except for the high rise
apartments in Escondido Vil
lage, few tall buildings on cam
pus still have garbage chutes.
In similar incidents, the
sprinkler systems have always
done their job and prevented
dumpster fires from doing sig
nificant damage, Broussard
said.
"Ninety-nine percent of the
time the sprinkler system will
put out or control the fire and
prevent it from spreading to
the building," he said.
