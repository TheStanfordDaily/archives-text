# Little quiet found on Bush's day of prayer
## 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
President Bush's call for
yesterday to be a day of prayer
for troops in the Persian Gulf
was met with mixed feelings
and to a large extent, inaction
by students and campus reli
gious leaders.
While many religious lead
ers said they supported individ
uals praying for the troops
themselves, they did not for
mally hold any special sessions
in response to Bush's call. In
addition, some people reacted
with open hostility to Bush's
pronouncement.

Byron Bland, director of
United Campus Ministries,
said that while it is appropriate
to pray for the safety of U.S.
troops and the comfort of their
families, Bush may be using
the pronouncement as a way of
garnering political support for
the war. "There was no men
tion of Iraqi deaths" in Bush's
call for prayer, he said.
A better solution than pray
ing for the troops would be to
ask God for guidance in deter
mining the justice of American
actions, Bland said. "I didn't
hear anything about asking for
humility in the face of uncertainty," he
noted.
Freshman Mark Weber, a member of
Students for America, a new conservative
campus group, said he does not think Bush
made the declaration to gain support for
the war. "Bush is a religious man," he said.
"He personally believes in prayer and he is
asking the American people to do what he's
doing for [American troops] already."
Weber also said the latest public opinion
polls, which give Bush about an 80 percent
approval rating for his conduct of the war,
indicate Bush does not need to use prayer
to get support.
Dean of Memorial Church Robert Gregg
said that although prayer for the troops is
necessary, it is not inappropriate also to
protest an unjust war. "The call for a
national day of prayer doesn't really relieve
any of us from following the dictates of our
own conscience," he said.
Erin Clune, a member of Stanford Stu
dents for Peace in the Middle East, called
Bush's pronouncement "an ultimate
hypocrisy."
"We are praying for the troops in reac
tion to Bush's actions," she said. "It's
ironic that Bush both dictates the terms of
the war and the terms of prayer and
peace."
Clune said the call for prayer may be
comforting to the troops and their families,
but to those who are opposed to U.S. mili
tary action, the declaration is a "shallow

and vacuous attempt at comforting the
American public."
In light of previous U.S. policies in the
Third World, "making a declaration when
it is politically convenient in the name of
peace and justice is highly hypocritical,"
Clune said.
Senior Hanns Lee, a member of the
Catholic community, said the day of prayer
should focus on the troops. "I think devot
ing the time to think about the individuals
in the Middle East is a positive thing," he
said.
"The troops have been over there for a
while and it's easy to forget about [them]."
said Lee, who is in Army ROTC.
Abdullahi Bature, president of the Stan
ford Islamic Society, said Muslims should
not pray for either side in the Gulf conflict.
He added that Muslims should always pray,
but only for the sake of Islam in general.
"To pray for the U.S. to get the upper
hand is un-Islamic, just as praying for Sad
dam Hussein is un-Islamic. What we
should pray for is for peace and stability in
the Middle East and that innocent people
not be killed," he said.
Ari Cartun, rabbi for the Stanford chap
ter of Hillel, the Jewish student organiza
tion, said he would have preferred a "week
end of prayer" to recognize the fact that
not all Americans worship on Sundays. He
said he believes prayer for the troops is
appropriate.
Russ Roide, a local Catholic minister,
said many students were coming to him
with questions about whether the war is
just. He said they are bothered by the fact
that many innocent people are being killed.
