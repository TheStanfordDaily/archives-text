# The 						case of the $70 wine
## 
### John Wagner Senior stafF writer 
Less than two weeks ago, congres
sional investigators revealed a host of
items that have seemingly little to do
with research but had nonetheless been
included in Stanford's indirect cost
recovery claims during the past decade.
Among the questionable charges were
"dozens of $70 bottles of wine" pur
chased for consumption at receptions
held in 1986 at the University-owned
home of Robert Freelen, vice president
for public afTairs .
Stanford officials immediately
protested, contending the charge in
question was $70 per case of wine, not
$70 per bottle.
Now, public afTairs officials say they
have proof.
They have dug out receipts from K&L
Liquors in Redwood City, where the pur
chases in question were made at the
beginning of the 1985-86 academic year.
The receipts do not explicitly indicate
the amount of wine purchased for $70,
but other items on the hand-written bill
suggest the University was charged by
the case. For example, Stanford was
charged more than $10 for "Coors." The
charge is clearly not for a single can of
Coors beer, said Larry Horton, associate
vice president for public afTairs.
The owners of K&L Liquors back the

University's claim, Horton added.
The congressional investigator who
disclosed the charge in question
acknowledged the University could be
correct. The voucher the University sub
mitted to the government only says
"Quantity: 1" and does not specify the
unit, she said.
The charge nonetheless reflects
poorly on Stanford, she reasoned. If the
Erice is $70 per case, then Stanford is
uying even more wine than she origi
nally thought.
Stanford's public affairs officials have
one other factor operating in their favor:
first-hand experience. They claim that
wine served at Freelen's receptions is
cheap. "I've drunk enough of that wine
to know it's not $70 a bottle," Horton
notes.
In any event, the whole issue is moot.
Stanford has announced that it will vol
untarily withdraw the operating expens
es of three University-owned residences,
including Freelen's, from its indirect
cost claims.
University officials decided it was not
worth the public confusion to continue
charging the government for these
expenses.
Under an agreement with the govern
ment, Stanford is allowed to charge 23
percent of the expenses of Freelen's
home to the government as an indirect
cost of research.
