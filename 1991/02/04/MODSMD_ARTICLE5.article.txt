# WAR IN THE. GULF
## U.S. planes hit Scud launcher; B-52 crashes 
### 
D HAH RAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) — American
"Scud patrol" jets, in a swift counter-strike,
pounced on two Iraqi missile launchers yester
day and may have knocked one out. But the Air
Force also lost a big one — a B-52 down in the
Indian Ocean.
Three of the giant bomber's crewmen were
plucked safely from the sea, and a search con
tinued for the other three, the U.S. command
said. It said a mechanical problem was proba
bly to blame.
Since early in the 18-day-old war, the rum
ble of distant B-52 strikes has been heard from
across the Saudi-Kuwaiti border. The huge
bombers have zeroed in particularly on the
dug-in positions of the Republican Guard, the
core of Iraq's defense of occupied Kuwait.
One of the eight-engine, $55-million
"Stratofortresses," headed back from a bomb
ing mission, crashed into the Indian Ocean late
Saturday on its way to its base at Diego Garcia,
a tiny atoll 2,000 miles southeast of the Gulf.
The U.S. command did not say where the
crash occurred or give details of the rescue of
three crewmen. It said there was "no evidence
that the aircraft went down as a result of hos
tile fire." At least 26 Americans are now miss
ing in action in the Gulf war.
A U.S. Marine UH-1 Huey helicopter also
crashed yesterday, killing all four crew mem-
bers, military authorities said.
The Pentagon said first reports
indicated the crash in eastern
Saudi Arabia was not combat
related.
American military sources say
the Air Force has begun mounting
"counter-Scud patrols," war
planes flying over areas where
Iraq's ballistic missiles are
believed based, ready to swoop
down when a launch is detected
on radar. One of the patrols
apparently scored yesterday.
Just minutes after Scuds were
launched toward Israel and Saudi
Arabia, U.S. planes descended on
two launch sites, the U.S. com
mand said. It said the pilots
reported secondary explosions at
one target — indicating a hit.
One of the Iraqi missiles, fired
at Riyadh, was intercepted by U.S.
Patriot defense missiles, but
debris fell into a residential area
of the Saudi capital. The Saudi
Press Agency said 29 people suf
fered minor injuries.
Two other missiles struck cen
tral Israel or the occupied West
Bank, but no injuries were
reported. The U.S. command said
one Scud may have landed in Jor
dan, but Jordanian officials dis
puted that report.
As ground fire died down for
the moment on the northern front
lines, the Desert Storm allies
pressed their relentless air war.
The U.S. command said the air
campaign had passed the 40,000-
sortie mark — some 10,000 more
missions than were flown against
Japan in the final 14 months of

World War 11.
Most major bridges in the
Kuwait region have now been
destroyed or badly damaged, the
command said, and the Iraqis
have had to throw makeshift pon
toon spans across rivers — new
easy targets.
Air strikes yesterday rocked
Iraqi targets from Kuwait to
Baghdad. Late in the afternoon, a
missile — probably a U.S. cruise
missile — slammed into down
town Baghdad, sending up a col
umn of white smoke, according to
an Associated Press report from
the Iraqi capital.
Fresh reports came in of air
attacks on civilian vehicles on the
road from Baghdad to Jordan.
Egyptians arriving in Jordan said
their bus was the only vehicle on
the road when it was repeatedly
machine-gunned by warplanes.
One of their group was killed,
they said. '
Allied bombers have destroyed
or significantly damaged about 25
of 35 bridges leading to the
Iraqi front lines in Kuwait and
southern Iraq, the command said.
The Iraqis are now resorting to
secondary roads and new pontoon
bridges to resupply their troops,
"and clearly that creates for us
some targets," said command
spokesman Marine Maj. Gen.
Robert Johnston. He said convoys
consequently have become backed
up and vulnerable.
Countless warehouses in Bagh
dad and in the strategic Iraqi port
of Basra, just 30 miles north of
Kuwait, have been destroyed by
allied bombers.
