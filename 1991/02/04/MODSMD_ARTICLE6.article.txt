The past struggles and contributions of black peo
ple and their hopes for a bright future were resonant
themes in a celebration Friday night that marked
the beginning of Black Liberation Month.
More than 150 students, faculty and staff congre
gated in Kresge Auditorium for the three-hour pro
gram, titled "Preparing Our 21st Century Leaders."
The ceremony — complete with speeches, musical
presentations and dance performances — kicked-off
an annual month-long tradition on campus that
showcases the cultural and intellectual accomplish
ments of black people and highlights issues of con
cern in the black community.

Black Liberation Month at Stanford also coin
cides with Black History Month, which occurs
nationwide.
"One Hundred Years of Change: Visions for Our
Future" is the theme of this year's celebrations and
events.
Friday's keynote speaker, African and Afro-Amer
ican Studies Program Chair Horace Porter, recited a
list of black leaders — including Sojourner Truth
and Martin Luther King Jr. — who significantly

improved the lives of black people.
"Honor and salute these individuals because they
stand and will stand as monuments of individual
achievement and excellence," he said.
Porter added that black role models serve the
important function of "deconstructing the American
reality." He said blacks have always been an inextri
cable part of America's complex history and fate.
From a passage by Ralph Ellison, the black
author best known for his book "Invisible Man,"
Porter quoted, "Most American whites are culturally
part black without realizing it. Without the presence
of black American style — [this country's] jokes, our
tall tales, even our sport, would be lacking."
Porter encouraged listeners to follow the path of
previous black leaders by asking difficult questions
about society and doing things to improve humanity.

Another speaker, Black Student Union Chair
Tasha Jackson, said black people should always be
mindful of giving back to their community. "Our
ancestors have paid with their sweat and blood and
lives. What we become pays tribute to their sacrifices
and serves as a gift for those behind us," she said.
"The single area where black leadership is needed
most is in our black communities," said Barry
Deonarine, chair of the Black Graduate Students
Association.
"The pursuit of the American dream should not
and must not leave out those in the black community
who need the vision that only black leaders can pro
vide," he said.
