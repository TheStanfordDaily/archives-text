# It's a trip: Conference probes history, culture of drug use
## 
### Cynthia Benton Staff writer 
"Psychedelic high priest" Timothy Leary and
"consciousness guru" Robert Wilson touted the
virtues of using drugs and attacked current anti
drug laws at a conference here this weekend.
The series of speakers and discussions in the two
day conference, titled "Linking the Past, Present and
Future of Psychedelics," was organized by senior
Ted Sichelman and hosted by The Bridge, a nation
wide organization that specializes in psychedelia.
Last year's conference took place at UC-Berkeley.
Wilson, author of "Schrodinger's Cat," a well
known book about quantum physics, opened the
conference by mocking current anti-drug propa
ganda. "This is your brain," he said, holding up an
apple. Then, as he dropped it, he added, "This is your
brain after its been hit by stupid uninformed TV
commercials on drugs."
About 500 people were present in the audience of
the opening session, including a large number of peo
ple not associated with the University as well as
Stanford students.
In his address, Wilson described a theory in which
the government is a pyramid with President Bush at
the apex and common people at the base. "No one
likes to tell the truth to someone who has power over
them, so as you move up the hierarchy, the bullshit
accumulates until you reach the top," he said.
Wilson explained both the Persian Gulf war and
Bush's war on drugs with his theory. "Bush has been
at war with us since he took office. He declared war
on us, on anyone who disagrees with the official
dogma. And to put it kindly, he's just misinformed. .
.. Marijuana is a totally harmless herb."
Timothy Leary, author of over 30 books and a pio

neer of group therapies in psychology, sketched a his
tory of the use of psychedelic drugs, which began
"with shamanistic traditions in geographic areas
that contained botanical neurotransmitters."
"The use of hallucinogens was suppressed in feu
dal society because [knowledge of the power of the
mind gained through psychedelic drugs] is incompat
ible with a society that depends on there being one
God," he said.
"The whole theory of'Know thyself came from a
bunch of Greek philosophers hanging around and
getting high. They had a lot of secret rituals that
involved psychedelic plants," Leary added.
Leary said the use of psychedelic drugs has spon
taneously resurfaced at different times throughout
history. "There's a whole new generation of young
people discovering psychedelics out there and intu
itively setting up a sort of shamanistic environ
ment," he added.
"They use LSD and Ecstasy to set up a hypnotic
trance state, and then listen and dance to music for
five or six hours. Sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll — that's
what it's all about," Leary said.
The lobby outside Cubberley Auditorium, the site
of yesterday's events, was filled with booths display
ing the commercial and political offshoots of the
drug culture. Television monitors filled with swirling
fractal patterns advertised videos designed to
enhance LSD trips.
In addition, a variety of new-age magazines fea
tured drug-inspired art and articles. One article
boasted that hemp could be used as an alternative
fuel source, thus ending the American dependence
on foreign oil.
Many Stanford students said they enjoyed the
conference and its topic.
