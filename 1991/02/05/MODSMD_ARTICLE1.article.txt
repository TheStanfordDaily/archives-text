# WAR IN THE GULF
## Iran initiates peace; allies bomb Baghdad 
### 
DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) - Marine
"jump jets" hammered Iraqi tanks in the
northern sands yesterday, while out in the gulf
the USS Missouri established a new front line,
the battleship that ended one war unleashing
its big guns to help win another.
The Iraqis warned they would fight the
Americans in the desert with "the hit-and-run
tactic formulated by our ancestors," the Arab
raiders of old.
But once again the U.S. military machine
relied on the weapons of tomorrow, waking up
Baghdad with "smart" bombs and missiles
that sent Iraqis scurrying down to basement
shelters.
After the Missouri's 16-inch guns
announced an escalation in the allied offensive,
and as bombs again fell by the ton, an unex
pected peace initiative came from Iran, the
only avowedly neutral nation in the Persian
Gulf.
Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani, who
has held discussions with Iraqi and Kuwaiti
envoys, said he was willing to meet with Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein and to resume
direct contact with the United States to try to
mediate a peaceful settlement.
In Washington, however, the Bush adminis
tration dismissed the likelihood that diplo
macy, not war, would drive Iraq from occupied
Kuwait.
"I think that we're now in a situation, hav
ing embarked on the course we're on, that we
will pursue military action until we have
achieved our objectives," Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney said. "What's to mediate?" asked
a State Department spokeswoman.
Early Tuesday, Radio Baghdad broadcast
renewed calls for terrorist attacks against
allied interests worldwide. The broadcast,
monitored in Cyprus, was followed by cryptic
messages from "central command," but their
meaning was not immediately apparent.
A television network report on Monday
quoted anonymous sources saying that more
than 20 Iraqi warplanes have been sent to
Sudan and Iraqi surface-to-air missiles have
been placed at strategic sites across the north
African nation.
The ABC report cited an anonymous relief
worker as saying he saw Iraqi jets at air bases
