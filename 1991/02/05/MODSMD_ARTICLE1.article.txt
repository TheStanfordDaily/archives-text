# WAR IN THE GULF
## Iran initiates peace; allies bomb Baghdad 
### 
DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) - Marine
"jump jets" hammered Iraqi tanks in the
northern sands yesterday, while out in the gulf
the USS Missouri established a new front line,
the battleship that ended one war unleashing
its big guns to help win another.
The Iraqis warned they would fight the
Americans in the desert with "the hit-and-run
tactic formulated by our ancestors," the Arab
raiders of old.
But once again the U.S. military machine
relied on the weapons of tomorrow, waking up
Baghdad with "smart" bombs and missiles
that sent Iraqis scurrying down to basement
shelters.
After the Missouri's 16-inch guns
announced an escalation in the allied offensive,
and as bombs again fell by the ton, an unex
pected peace initiative came from Iran, the
only avowedly neutral nation in the Persian
Gulf.
Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani, who
has held discussions with Iraqi and Kuwaiti
envoys, said he was willing to meet with Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein and to resume
direct contact with the United States to try to
mediate a peaceful settlement.
In Washington, however, the Bush adminis
tration dismissed the likelihood that diplo
macy, not war, would drive Iraq from occupied
Kuwait.
"I think that we're now in a situation, hav
ing embarked on the course we're on, that we
will pursue military action until we have
achieved our objectives," Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney said. "What's to mediate?" asked
a State Department spokeswoman.
Early Tuesday, Radio Baghdad broadcast
renewed calls for terrorist attacks against
allied interests worldwide. The broadcast,
monitored in Cyprus, was followed by cryptic
messages from "central command," but their
meaning was not immediately apparent.
A television network report on Monday
quoted anonymous sources saying that more
than 20 Iraqi warplanes have been sent to
Sudan and Iraqi surface-to-air missiles have
been placed at strategic sites across the north
African nation.
The ABC report cited an anonymous relief
worker as saying he saw Iraqi jets at air bases

north of the capital of Khartoum. A
Sudanese official denied Iraqi missiles
or aircraft are in the country and said
it had a long military relationship with
Iraq, the network reported.
The situation on the ground at the
Gulf war's northern front remained
essentially static Monday. No new
Iraqi probes were reported six days
after Iraqi troops punched into Saudi
territory and were repulsed in a series
of bloody clashes.
But the U.S. command said front
line Marines did trade fire with the

Iraqis across the border Monday, and
Marine pilots reported scoring a major
hit against Iraqi armor.
Four AV-8 Harriers, the Marines'
vertical-takeoff "jump jets," found
and attacked 25 to 30 Iraqi tanks
across the border, unloading Rockeye
anti-tank bombs.
"The results, from the initial pilot
reports, were 25 Iraqi tanks destroyed,
or at least burning," said Marine Maj.
Gen. Robert Johnston, chief of staff
for Operation Desert Storm.
Marine officers earlier reported that
two of their Hornet fighter-bombers
knocked out an Iraqi rocket site that

had fired on allied positions.
The Marines also said a battalion
size Marine task force opened up with
155 mm artillery fire on Iraqi ground
radar and infantry positions near the
Umm Gudair oil field in southwestern
Kuwait, and Marine light armored
vehicles exchanged cannon and small
arms fire with Iraqi troops just over
the border in Kuwait.
No U.S. casualties were reported in
those actions.
Late Sunday, Desert Storm air
power pounded an Iraqi convoy on the
move in Kuwait, Johnston said. He
said the Iraqis, in a clear attempt to

reduce the size of targets for allied
warplanes, are using smaller convoys
than before — keeping them to five to
10 vehicles.
The allies' mission-a-minute air
campaign focused again on Iraqi
troops' dug-in positions in Kuwait.
The Air Force's giant B-52 bombers
staged six raids on the Republican
Guard, Iraq's best troops, Johnston
said.
In the wintry chill of the front lines,
Marines told a reporter they like to
hear the distant thunder of the B-52s
— such "preparation" will make their
eventual push into Kuwait easier.
