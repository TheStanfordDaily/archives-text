Brown to run for U.S. Senate
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Former Gov.
Jerry Brown said yesterday he is resigning as
chairman of the California Democratic Party
to run for the Democratic nomination for the
U.S. Senate next year.
Brown's announcement ended months of
speculation that he was considering running
for the Senate in 1992, when for the first time
both of California's seats are on the same bal
lot.
The 52-year-old Brown's written announce
ment said he will step down as chairman at the
conclusion of the annual state party conven
tion March 3. In a separate telephone inter
view, Brown elaborated on his plans, saying he
would seek the seat now occupied by Democrat
Alan Cranston, who has announced plans to
retire.
"I think I made a significant contribution in
rebuilding the party, and I can best serve to
inspire voters (now) as a candidate," Brown
said.
FBI agent gets 20 years
LOS ANGELES (AP) - The only FBI agent
ever convicted of espionage was sentenced to
20 years in prison yesterday by a judge who
suggested the agency shouldn't have placed
such an inept agent in control of sensitive doc
uments.
It should have been obvious that Richard
Miller was highly susceptible to recruitment as
a spy, said U.S. District Judge Robert Taka
sugi.
"The fact is that Mr. Miller betrayed a
national trust. And yet I truly wonder why the
FBI allowed Mr. Miller to serve in this capac
ity," the judge said.
State cuts farm irrigation
SACRAMENTO (AP) - California officials
cut off state irrigation water deliveries to farm
ers yesterday to save dwindling supplies for
cities in the fifth year of a deepening record
drought.
Few farmers rely solely on water from the
State Water Project, but deliveries from the
larger and more heavily used Central Valley
Project, a federal program, also are expected to
be reduced by 65 percent or more in an
announcement mid-month, according to
authorities.
The double blow will force many farmers to
pump much more water from the ground,
which is expensive because of electricity con
sumption, or to take land out of production.
Lithuanians want independence
MOSCOW (AP) — Lithuanians campaigned
yesterday for the SdViet Union's first republic
wide vote on independence, with nationalists
calling for secession and critics urging a boy
cott of the vote, reports said.
Leaders of Lithuania and Estonia, mean
while, urged residents to maintain vigilance
against Soviet troops in the Baltic states,
despite recent calm after the military assaults
last month that left at least 20 people dead.
