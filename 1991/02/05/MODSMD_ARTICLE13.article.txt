# More money planned for unemployed
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The president's budget
recommends an extra $280 million to help states run
unemployment insurance programs, but critics say
the Bush administration is glossing over how deeply
the recession will hit the jobs market.
The Labor Department's proposal for a 14 per
cent spending increase for unemployment insurance
to $2.3 billion is based on a forecast that unemploy
ment will peak at 6.7 percent next year and then
start to come down. Unemployment last month was
6.2 percent.
Many private analysts predict that even a mild
recession would push the nation's unemployment
rate to at least 7 percent by midsummer, and some
economists' projections are much worse.
Rudy Oswald, chief economist at the AFL-CIO,
noted that in other recessions since World War 11,
unemployment has gone up an average of 3 percent
age points.
President Bush is also proposing a $27.5 billion
education budget that would encourage states and
local school districts to adopt private school voucher
programs.
The Education Department's proposed budget
outlay represents a $2.5 billion increase over the
1991 level. However, the increase is about $840 mil
lion when the guaranteed student loan program is
removed.
Spending for new programs would be $690 mil
lion, with the bulk of the programs focused on allow
ing parents to select the schools their children will
attend.
A key initiative under parental choice is a pro
posed $200 million fund for grants to states or local
school districts that adopt "choice" programs involv
ing public and private schools. Religious schools
could be involved if a school district agrees.
Bush also is seeking a 7.5 percent increase in the
Pell Grant program, which provides aid to low
income college students. The total $5.8 billion
request would provide grants to about 3 million stu
dents and increase the maximum amount from
$2,400 to $3,700.
