### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Energy Department proposed
increased spending yesterday to
clean up atomic weapons plants
and said it would scale back plans
for a new weapons reactor pro
gram and not reopen an aging
reactor.
The department's fiscal 1992
proposed budget called for spend
ing $4.4 billion on cleanup pro

grams at 17 atbmic weapons facil
ities, a 30 percent increase over
what Congress provided-
The department, however, also
said it was asking for more money
this fiscal year as well. It said
another $623 million would be
sought for weapons plan cleanup
activities in 1991, including $283
million that is needed to allow the
Rockv Flats facility in Colorado to

resume plutonium production
While more money was being
allocated for environmental
cleanup, the department said the
tight budget requires that a pro
gram for a new weapons reactor
be scaled back.
The department said that it no
longer planned to build two sepa
rate new reactor plants to produce
tritium.
