## Vote Overdeck: yes 
### 
ASSU should deal with
national issues as they
relate to Stanford itself

Tonight the assu senate
will finally vote on the
Overdeck bill, which
attempts to limit debate only to
issues that directly relate to Stan
ford; it should pass the bill in order
to prevent wasted effort that can
be used for other activities.
Contrary to charges from the
bill's opponents, the Overdeck bill
does not mean that the ASSU
should limit its activities only to
the alcohol policy or other campus
issues. Student leaders should not
simply ignore issues of interna
tional prominence. International
issues such as the war in the Per
sian Gulf certainly affect individ
ual students more than many
Stanford issues do.
The Overdeck bill is an attempt
to limit debate in the ASSU to
issues on which it can have an
effect. No one cares if the ASSU
opposes a U.S.-led military offen
sive against Iraq. That certainly
didn't stop President Bush from
unleashing his forces a couple of
weeks ago.
The ASSU can, however, deal
with non-Stanford issues as they
relate to Stanford itself. Rather
than taking a position for or
against a national issue, which will
alienate the students who disagree,
the ASSU can provide services that
help students deal with the issues.
The Council of Presidents, for
example, was involved in the orga
nization of a campus-wide teach-in
after the war started. This kind of
activity serves a number of differ
ent purposes, among them provid
ing the students and faculty with a
forum for opinion and increasing
their knowledge of the issues in

this war.
The ASSU can also use its
resources to establish draft coun
seling in preparation for a possible
draft. This will provide a needed
service without getting into the
partisan politics of anti-war bills in
the ASSU senate.
The ASSU, through the
Speaker's Bureau, can also work to
bring in bipartisan experts on
American foreign policy or the
peace movement.
This can also serve to keep the
issue alive on the campus. Many
people are already tired of hearing
about the war and no longer wish
to discuss it, despite its impor
tance. Stanford has been very quiet
on the war issue in the last week
and the ASSU can help to bring the
issue back to life.
Supporters of the Overdeck bill
rightly point out that the ASSU
cannot represent the student body
on international issues. Senators
were not elected because of their
knowledge of foreign policy and
Middle Eastern politics. Nowhere
in the campaign for ASSU Senate
were there debates over the proper
role of the United States in the
"new world order."
On international issues the
ASSU does not speak for the stu
dents, and it should not pretend
that it does.
The truth is that nobody really
knows what the students think on
the issue of the Persian Gulf war.
Although The Daily conducted a
poll before the war and found a
slim majority to be against it, those
results probably became obsolete
overnight when we bombed Bagh
dad, as they did nationwide.
Instead of taking a position on
issues independent of the students,
the ASSU should conduct unbiased
polls, as it did last week, to try to
measure student opinion. This can
provide a far more valuable service.
