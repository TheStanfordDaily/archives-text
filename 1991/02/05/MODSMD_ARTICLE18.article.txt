Don't get caught in WWII, Vietnam comparisons

IT IS TIME AGAIN TO PROVE to
the world and to ourselves that our
democracy works. Does this mean we
should take to the streets and protest
the war effort in the Gulf? Does it mean
instead that we should support the
administration's war strategy? The
anrwers depend on how we the people
choose, and we must choose and not
evade our responsibility to articulate our
national interests — moral, security, eco
nomic or otherwise — in the Persian
Gulf region.
I argue that our national interests
will be better served by exhorting Presi
dent Bush to refrain from commencing a
ground assault on Kuwait for a signifi
cant period of time. But this personal
opinion is not so important as the neces
sity that we as a people do debate and
articulate popularly our national inter
ests, making them known to the admin
istration.
Is the present situation more analo
gous to the Vietnam War or to World War

II? Clearly to the majority of Americans,
if we characterize the Gulf conflict as
"World War 11-like," our presence and
war effort in the Middle East becomes a
"just" cause. Likewise, labeling the cir
cumstances as "Vietnam-like" would
make the majority of Americans demand
immediate withdrawal of our soldiers
from the region.
Important here is the realization that
the duration of the conflict and/or the
casualty rate, while obviously important
to the emotional response underlying
public opinion, are not totally control
ling. World War II was not a short con
flict by any means, lasting (for the
United States) a period of four long
years and costing some 407,316 Ameri
can lives, 349,165 more lives than were
lost in Vietnam.
But during that war there was a gen
eral consensus among the citizens of this
nation that these lives lost were justly
risked because the war was necessary.
Our moral, security and economic inter

ests coincided and coalesced; we articu
lated our interest to be the complete and
utter destruction of the Axis's war
machine because 1) the Axis powers vio
lated the regime of international law, 2)
the Axis forces threatened our national
security by embarking on a policy of
world domination and 3) the Axis imper
iled our economic interests by this desta
bilization of the world order.
Such an imminent threat is not
apparent from Iraq's Saddam Hussein.
But neither does this mean that the Viet
nam analogy is more apposite. In fact,
given that we are acting in behalf of a
U.N. Resolution to support the rule of
international law, given that Hussein's
professed expansionist military repre
sents a decided threat to our national
security and, of course, given that we are
protecting the world's access to vital oil
deposits in the area, I would argue that
the conflict is more like World War 11.
Nonetheless, the World War II anal
ogy does not fit perfectly and that is why

an all-out response, similar to that of
World War 11, is not mandated. Instead
our response should be, and so far has
been, a limited and flexible one — one,
though, that does not eliminate military
action, including using ground forces to
liberate Kuwait.
The specific extent of the responses
we should contemplate depends precisely
on delineating exactly what our national
interests should be in the region. I sug
gest that this should be the focus of dis
cussion in our debates and protests; the
protests should inform Washington
where the people think our national
interests lie and outline, where possible,
realistic alternatives to achieving
national interests.
Just saying American soldiers should
get out of the Gulf, period, avoids the
essential question, unless our national
objective is, ridiculously, only to risk no
American lives at any cost whatsoever.
