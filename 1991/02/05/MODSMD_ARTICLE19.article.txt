# 'Military takeover' stops media from getting at truth
## 
### 
During the elections last
November, many newspapers ran
an article which noted that most
Americans could not name their congres
sional representative. Sadly, many of
these same Americans call themselves
patriotic.
As I see it, patriotism means personal
responsibility — knowledge about and
participation in government. When less
than 30 percent of American citizens
even bother to vote, let alone familiarize
themselves with the candidates' plat
forms or issues, they can hardly say they
defend democracy.
For example, do those persons who
support this war know that last Decem
ber, one month before Iraq's deadline to

withdraw from Kuwait, the Food and
Drug Administration lifted the rule
requiring that Desert Shield troops be
given informed consent about experi
mental drugs that may be used on them?
Our soldiers do not have the right to
know about "investigational new drugs"
because it's not "feasible," according to
the Department of Defense, who
requested the waiver. Do Americans
know that the veteran's hospitals were
gearing up last fall for heavy Desert
Shield casualties?
Do Americans know George Bush has
requested a 50 percent increase for the
Star Wars program for fiscal year 1992?
Or that this war is costing $1 billion per
day, while another federal agcncy, the

U.S. Institute for Peace, received an
appropriation of $8.3 million for fiscal
year 1991 — roughly equal to what 10
minutes of the war costs. That's the
value of peace to the current administra
tion.
Americans are suffering for a war on
truth. The media have virtually had a
military takeover, presenting only those
views which support the Bush adminis
tration/Pentagon position. Body counts
and examples of our own brutality are
politically unpopular, and worse yet, the
nation may have to feel its grief.
I implore all Americans to educate
themselves as much as possible about
this tragedy. Capturing oil and sustain
ing a costly military economy aren't the

only issues here. This war is also about
whether or not Americans care to dis
cover the evil in our own psyches (I
include my own) and if we do, in fact,
have a democracy or merely euphemisms
and "moral" rhetoric.
If these sentiments make me unpatri
otic, so be it. But as the mother of an 18-
year-old man in the Army, I find it tragi
cally ironic that his very first gun is an
M-16.1 will march in every single anti
war demonstration I can. As Buddha
said thousands of years ago, "Life
belongs to (s)he who saves it."
