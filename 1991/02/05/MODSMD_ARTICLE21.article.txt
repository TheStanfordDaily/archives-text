## George 'Rudyard' Bush 
### 
IN THE FIVE YEARS I HAVE spent in
the United States, last Tuesday was
the first time I watched the Presi
dent's annual State of the Union address
on television.
My main reaction was one of disbelief
and concern. The speech reminded me,
more than anything else, of Rudyard
Kipling's "The White Man's Burden,"
which encouraged white men to go out
and colonize the world for its own good. It
did not seem to matter to the colonizers
then that the world had not, in fact,
requested to be colonized, nor shared
England's vision of what was good for it.
A similar lack of concern is visible in
Bush's view of America's role in his "new
world order."
Many of you who have been on study
abroad programs have probably
encountered anti-Americanism. Bush
too, must be aware that it exists in many
countries. It is, however, rarely directed
against the United States or its citizens,
but rather against the projection of U.S.
power abroad, through the foreign policy
actions of its government. I submit that
few countries in the United Nations, for
instance, would agree that "For genera
tions, America has led the struggle to pre
serve and extend the blessings of liberty"
abroad.
The most visible U.S. foreign policy
actions since World War 11, in Southeast
Asia and Latin America, have brought to
the people in those regions countless
deaths and a severe curtailment of their
rights, liberties and opportunities. Even
assuming that these interventions arose
from a concern for and interest in justice

and liberty, the actual effect in each case
was clearly opposite to that intended.
Cambodia became so destabilized that Pol
Pot seized power; Nicaragua became even
poorer; El Salvador has become even
more violent.
Notwithstanding claims to the con
trary, it oflten seems hard to reconcile
America's stated "selfless" aim of justice
and liberty with its actual behavior. What
distinguishes Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
from Indonesia's invasion of East Timor
years ago? What is the difference between
Saddam Hussein's invasion of Iran, sup
ported by the United States, and that of
Kuwait, which turned him into a mad dic
tator? How come Bush wants to "Help
the Baltic people achieve their aspira
tions, not punish the Soviet Union," but
seems bent on punishing Iraq?
The results of past armed interven
tions should be considered before
embarking on a new one. Europeans have
been faulted for their lukewarm support
for the war, even though they depend
more on Middle Eastern oil. Perhaps they
thought a different policy was better. But
Bush went ahead and sent troops, possi
bly eliminating the chance for a peaceful
solution.
The United Nations has recognized the
dangerous situation in the Gulf with 12
resolutions, including a demand for Iraq's
immediate and unconditional with
drawal. But the "burden of leadership"
was quickly taken over by the U.S. gov
ernment. The United Nations might have
sent peacekeeping forces to calm the situ
ation — in expectation of a peaceful solu
tion to the conflict — as it has done in the

past, for example, when Turkey invaded
Cyprus.
The United States is, as Bush indi
cates, probably the only country in the
world with the force to back up its aims.
But whence does Bush get the "moral
standing" to decide what is just and nec
essary? Many small U.N. countries have
memories of the strong-arm tactics of
close neighbors or colonial overlords. Why
should they now welcome the strong arm
of a global policeman, who decides what
they need or deserve?
Until the early 1980s, the United
States was noticeably less eager to play
the global policeman than it is today. The
involvement of the Soviet Union, after all,
could turn any local conflict into a super
power standoff. This countervailing force
has now disappeared. Perhaps it is
time for such a force to be generated
domestically. Students at Stanford are
preparing for positions of local or national
leadership. We should prepare to do what
Bush calls "the hard work of freedom" in
our own country. American leadership
should be by domestic example, not by
foreign intervention — by facing up to
our serious domestic economic problems,
not by deciding which dictator deserves to
be tipped off his pedestal next.
