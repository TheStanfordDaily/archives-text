## Baseball opens homestand 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
If you have never seen a Stan
ford baseball game in Sunken Dia
mond do not worry; the Cardinal
will be home for awhile. Today's
game against the University of the
Pacific marks the begining of a 13-
game, 20-day homestand that cul
minates with the team's Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division
opener against Arizona State.
Stanford will be playing a lot of
games in a short period of time,
but with the all-important Pac-10
season less than a month away,
there is a reason.
"We are playing lots of games in
the next couple of weeks, but
there is a method to the mad
ness," coach Mark Marquess said.
"This kind of schedule forces us to
use more pitchers and gives us a
chance to evaluate the pitching
staff."
After pitching an inning of
relief in Sunday's 12-4 victory
over Fullerton State, Tim Moore
should start for the Cardinal this
afternoon, weather permitting.

The 6-foot-4, 190-pound soph
more did not compete for Stanford
last year, but Marquess thinks he
is ready to contribute.
"(Moore) looks good," Mar
quess said. "He has an outstand
ing split-fingered fastball and also
has a good curve. He needs to
make some adjustments on his
overall game, but he looks good."
UOP comes into today's game
with a 1-1 record and should not
blemish the Cardinal's perfect 6-0
mark. Historically the Tigers spot
Stanford a touchdown or two and
the question then becomes how
many Cardinal players will have
multiple hit days, not who will
win.
Stanford is led offensively by
David McCarty and Jeffrey Ham
monds, both batting .417.
McCarty went 6-for-ll against
Fullerton and collected his first
two home runs of the season.
Hammonds leads the team in
homers with four, collecting a
team high of eight RBl's along the
way. After playing with a sore
thumb last weekend, Marquess
said he may sit catcher Troy Tall

man and allow Mark Skeels to
take over the duties behind the
plate. Skeels is batting .400 with
one RBI.
Depending on the score this
game could see Marquess go to the
bench often, but the emphasis will
still be on the mound. With the
Pac-10 season coming up the Car
dinal has to decide on a pitching
rotation, and games like today's
are where the younger members
of the staff have to prove them
selves.
"Our (pitchers) are all trying to
earn starting spots," Marquess
said. "They are out there to
impress the coaches and compete
for innings."

Freshman Willie Adams improved his record to 2-0 with a victory over Fullerton State Sunday. He went
six innings, giving up only six hits and an unearned run while striking out five.
