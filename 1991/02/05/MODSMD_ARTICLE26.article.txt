# Top-ranked netters host San Jose State
## Cardinal, Spartans hoping Mother Nature gives them the green light 
### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
Coming off its third-consecu
tive national crown, the men's
tennis team has most students
saying, "Here they go again,"
especially after the squad's sea
son-opening dual match victory
Sunday.
Coach Dick Gould doesn't see
things quite the same way.
"There's the men's team and
then there's the women's team.
Let's get that straight," Gould
pointed out, differentiaing his
squad from the 69-straight-victo
ries-and-counting women's team.
Even if the Cardinal was
ranked No. 1 in the Volvo presea
son poll, the squad definitely isn't
overlooking its early-season "fod
der" matches, including today's
match-up with San Jose State.
There's a lineup to be worked out
— top-seed Jonathan Stark is out
at least until spring with a foot
injury — young players who need
collegiate experience, and concen
tration.
Yes, the beginning of the sea
son means time to work on that
match-time concentration for all
players, not just the squad's five
freshmen. The need was apparent
Sunday when four of six singles
competitors dropped either their
first or second sets before pulling
themselves together for the vic
tory.
Gould, however, isn't worried,
just aware.
"Any good team has to learn to
maintain its concentration level,
and it's a little harder to do earlier
in the season when the guys
aren't focused, when the young
guys are playing," Gould said.
"It's always easier to say than to
do.
"Walking on the court it's easy
to say 'forget everything going on
in my personal life,' but's its hard
to do. Coming out to practice
when you're not completely
focused is different than a team
match."
In addition to honing tennis
skills and chalking up another 'W,'
early-season matches are sched
uled to work on match intensity.
Opponents aren't quite as tough
— or forboding — as Pacific 10
Conference foes, and Stanford can
use the home-court advantage to
relax and get itself into champi
onship-caliber form — physically
and mentally.
San Jose should be a perfect

testing ground. The team isn't
ranked, the Spartans don't have
any nationally renowned aces,
and, in fact, Stanford doesn't even
know anything about the squad.
An ideal candidate against whom
to rebuild competitive intensity
and give some of the freshmen
match experience.
"They need to get used to the
little things, like changing the
scoreboard and having a coach
yelling at them [during a match].
"[And] players need to be

reminded that just because they
beat someone in junior tennis a
year ago, they are not going to just
walk on the court and beat them
6-2, 6-2," Gould added. "College
tennis is a great equalizer."
With Stark out for at least
another month, the Cardinal's
top-ranked freshmen are defi
nitely going to have to get used to
participating in and contributing
to collegiate dual matches.
With the like of the country's
No. 1 recruit and another who

was ranked in preseason singles
listings — without playing a single
collegiate set — it shouldn't be a
problem.
Card notes
The Cardinal hosts the Spartans at
1:30 p.m. at Stanford tennis stadium.
The match will be held later in the
week in case of rain. Last Saturday's
weather-cancelled match against UC-
Irvine, however, will not be resched
uled.

season opener Sunday.
