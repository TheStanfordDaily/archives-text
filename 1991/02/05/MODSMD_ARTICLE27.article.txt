# Fencers prove themselves the West's best

### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
One of the problems of being successful in
sports is that then your opponents try that
much harder to beat you. Saturday at Roble
Gym the Cardinal men's and women's fencing
teams found that out.
Stanford has dominated West Coast fencing
for years, so when the team hosted rivals Cal
ifornia, Long Beach State, UC-Santa Cruz and
the University of San Diego, they knew they
would be challenged.
Despite this, the Cardinal women were
more than up to the test, sweeping through
the opposition, while the Stanford men were
nearly as impressive, falling only in a close
contest with the 49ers.
"Everybody did absolutely a great job," said
men's coach Zoran Tulum. "We definitely
proved ... we are on the top of West Coast
fencing."
On the women's side, Stanford opened the
day with a 13-3 win over Cal. The Cardinal
then topped Long Beach State 11-5, San Diego
15-1 and Santa Cruz 14-2. Lana Kang went

15-0 in her bouts to lead the way for Stanford.
Olivia Judson went 14-1, allowing only one
touch against the Golden Bears; captain Grace
Chang went 14-2 and Thea Wojtkowski was
11-5.
On the men's side, Stanford defeated Cal
17-10, lost to Long Beach 16-11, bested the
Tritons 19-8 and handled the Banana Slugs
17-10. The Cardinal's sabre team went unde
feated and the epee team went 3-1, but the foil
team was 0-4. Stanford's foil squad is without
Nick Bravin, the defending NCAA champion,
however. He is training overseas for the 1992
Olympics and is redshirting this year.
Tulum said that six of the bouts his team
lost to the 49ers were 4-4 before Long Beach
State recorded the final, winning touch.
"They're not that strong," he said. "If we just
concentrate on those 4-4 matches, we can beat
them as we've done in the past."
Leonard D'Amico went 12-0 to lead the
sabre team while Keith Early went 9-3 and
Glenn Wong was 8-3. In epee, Jeremy Nelson
was 8-3, David Brody was 8-4 and Chris
McKenna went 7-5, while Stan Brobson had
the foil team's only winning record at 6-3.

"I'm pleased in the way the team behaved
and fenced," Tulum said. "I think Long Beach
is more scared with the victory than we are
concerned with the loss. They know we can
beat them and I know we can beat them."
Stanford next competes this weekend at
Cal in the Pacific 10 Conference Invitational.
While not every Pac-10 institution sponsors
fencing, Tulum expects seven teams to be pre
sent. In the first two years of the meet, Stan
ford's men and women have won every aspect
of the competition.
He expects both the men and the women to
win the overall competition and feels the
men's sabre and epee teams should both win,
while the foil team will find the hosting
Golden Bears to be the strongest competition.
Despite the absence of Bravin, Tulum feels the
Cardinal definitely belongs in the nation's top
10, and is getting better.
"Every year is better and better," he said.
"I'm very excited about the coming season
because I will have the best recruiting year
ever. With a little bit of luck ... we can be in
the best three in the country (in 1992)."
