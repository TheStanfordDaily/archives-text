# Stop the madness
## 
### 
All right, a lot of people
seem to be confused
about what's going on in
the Pac-10 men's hoops race, so
I figured I'd do my best to
explain what's happening.
After all, since everyone
seems to be annoyed by the fact
that no one (specifically, Stan
ford) can seem to look good
more than one game in a row, I
guess it's about time that
somebody explained the situa
tion completely, thoroughly
and intelligently. Don't say it.
Let's see .. . what we have
here is a bunch of teams
who've spent the last five
weeks beating up on each
other: Arizona lost to Washing
ton, who lost to Oregon State,
who lost to Washington State,
who lost to Stanford, who lost
to USC, who lost to ASU, who
lost to Cal, who lost to Oregon,
who lost to UCLA, who (guess)
lost to Arizona, who begat
Joseph, who ... oh. Sorry.
The deal is that at the mid
point of the conference sched
ule, everyone in the Pac-10
except Arizona has at least
four losses.
Arizona, at 7-2, has a two
game lead on Oregon
State and Washington
State. Yes, the same Washing
ton State that was 1-17 last
year.
After that? Well, the differ
ence between second place and
10th place in the Pac-10 these
days is exactly two games. Five
days ago Stanford was tied for
ninth. Now — thanks to the
usual weirdness over the week
end — they're in fourth, one
game out of second.
It's crazy. It's anarchy. It's
camels sleeping with platy
puses.
What we obviously need
here is a calm, poised, exhaus
tive and objective explanation
of the whole mess from some
one used to dealing with sensi
tive subjects, and that person
(obviously) isn't me. Instead,
we need someone who can off
set the madness in the Pac-10.
Someone who's able to sift
through all the baloney and
give us a comprehensive analy
sis of the situation.
What we need, in short, is
the most level-headed, intelli
gent person in the universe.
We need Ted Koppel.
Unfortunately, Ted's not
available right now —
or at least he wasn't
when I called his office yester
day. (Again, the usual caveat: I
am not making this up.)
I came close, though: The
ABC Washington Bureau sec
retary got me the Nightline
secretary, and he got me Ted's
executive assistant — who,
after putting me on hold for
about a week, told me that the
folks at ABC had a little differ
ent procedure for stuff like
this.
Hey, how was I supposed to
know? Anyway, I had to call
New York and ask a PR rep if I
could set up an interview. The
conversation went really well:
"You want to ask him about
whatV
"Basketball."
"What?"
"Basketball, The Pacific 10
Conference race. For five min
utes."
"Pacific what?"
After we broke through the

initial language barrier, she
said she'd ask Ted and get back
to me. Stay tuned. So, since
Ted couldn't spare the time —
what, does he have something
better to do? — it looks like
y'all are stuck with me. Sorry.

Okay then, here's my thor
ough, well-thought-out, intelli
gent, comprehensive explana
tion of why the Pac-10 race
seems to be such a mess:
I don't have a clue in hell.
Actually, there is a fairly
simple explanation for
why the entire league is
bunched together. The expla
nation was so simple and so
obvious it was given back in
November.
Of course, the explanation
has been ignored for the last
several months both by fans
and sportswriters, because it
makes perfect sense. The
explanation? Everyone in the
league happens to be good.
Yeah, I know, it's pretty earth
shattering, but that's all there
is.
Way back in the preseason
press conference, almost every
coach in the league said how
tough the Pac-10 was going to
be. A bunch of people nodded,
said uh-huh, then went out and
predicted what the Pac-10
would look like at the end of
the season.
Halfway through that sea
son, it looks like just about
everyone — except the coaches,
of course — didn't have any
clue how balanced the league
would be. Come on: Oregon
State beating UCLA? Fine, go
ahead and say UCLA isn't very
good. Explain how they beat
the living you-know-what out
of Pitt two days ago.
And explain how the Pac-10
has the second-best non-con
ference record in the country.
Explain how the Big East —
the conference with the best
record — is 0-3 against the Pac
-10 this season.
It's a mess, and it's going to
stay that way. WSU beating
ASU on the road? USC coming
within a missed 8-foot shot of
beating Arizona at McKale? Cal
beating Arizona and then los
ing to Oregon?
It's like this: There's abso
lutely no way to tell who's
going to win on any night the
rest of the season. This week
end the Cardinal plays at
Washington and WSU (whom
they beat by a combined total
of 63 points a month ago) and
very well could lose both
games.
Nobody has any clue what's
going to happen the rest of the
way, and that means all 10
teams — all of them — have a
shot at the top.
Things could get interest
ing.

Due to idiotically telling his
barber to "go for it,"the back of
Cameron Macky's neck is visi
ble for the first time in six
years. Catch a glimpse while
you can.
