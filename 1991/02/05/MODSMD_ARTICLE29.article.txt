# International law experts:
## Saddam violates Geneva Convention 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
Since the Iran-Iraq war, Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein has been accused of violat
ing the Geneva Convention, and many inter
national law experts believe he may do so
again in the current war in the Persian Gulf.
Analysts say they fear Saddam may vio
late two parts of the convention — the
requirement that prisoners of war be treated
humanely and a prohibition on the use of
nuclear weapons.
The convention is a series of international
agreements that specify what types of
actions are considered illegal during
wartime. The first agreement was reached in
1864 and has been updated since then.
Almost every country in the world — 165 out
of 169 — has agreed to abide by the conven
tion, said Gen. George S. Prugh, former
Judge Advocate General of the U.S. Army.
While Iraq is one of the signatories of the
convention, Saddam's regime is currently
violating it through its treatment of Allied
prisoners of war, said George Bunn, former
general counsel of the Arms Control and Dis
armament Agency, a federal agency.
Article 17 of the 1949 Geneva protocol
states that "No physical or mental torture
nor any other form of coercion may be
inflicted on prisoners of war."
Bunn said the television pictures display

ing apparent physical beatings of captured
pilots shows a clear violation. "The guys
looked as if they were pummeled," he said. "I
was outraged."
The convention also forbids using the
prisoners as "human shields" against air
attack. It assumes they will be housed "in
something that is not an explicit target,"
Bunn said.
He added that while bombings by the
coalition forces may make feeding the pris
oners difficult, humane treatment is still
expected. The prisoners "ought to be fed and
given medical attention," he said.
"But certainly, if everyone is starving, no
one expects that you do more for them than
for your own citizens," he added.
Prugh said the International Red Cross
generally checks on the condition of POWs
in warfare. However, Saddam has not
allowed the organization to investigate the
current situation, according to Jackie
Wright, external affairs associate of the
American Red Cross.
Since the Red Cross has no mechanism to
enforce international laws, it typically tries
to persuade the countries involved to give it
access, Prugh said.
Saddam has not cooperated with the Red
Cross in the past, particularly during its
investigation of his use of chemical weapons
on hundreds of Kurds in Iraq during the
Iran-Iraq war. When Iraq refused to stop its

policies the Red Cross sent a telex to all con
vention signatories publicizing the killings,
Prugh said.
Some experts have predicted Saddam will
violate the prohibition against chemical
weapons in the current war.
The Geneva Protocol of 1925 specifically
prohibits the use of all chemical agents.
Bunn, who worked on developing the proto
col, said most countries even consider the
use of tear gas to be prohibited. However, the
U.S. does not consider tear gas to be prohib
ited when it is used extensively for civilian
riot control, he said.
This reservation may give Saddam a way
to justify his own use of deadly chemical
weapons, Bunn said. If Saddam decides to
use chemicals against Allied troops, he could
say the U.S. had already violated the conven
tion by allowing the use of tear gas.
And this is a justification Saddam is likely
to need, according to John Harvey, a military
analyst at Stanford's Center for Interna
tional Security and Arms Control. "If there's
an Allied ground attack," he said, "the Allied
forces can expect to get gassed."
Bunn said the coalition's practice of car
pet bombing Iraqi positions is not specifi
cally prohibited by the Geneva convention,
though it does prohibit bombing civilians or
hitting foodstuffs. "Saddam's claim that we
are aiming at houses has not yet been
proven," he said.
