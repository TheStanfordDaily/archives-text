# Students divided on role of ASSU
## 
### Eric Young Senior Staff writer 
As the ASSU Senate convenes tonight to vote
on a bill that would confine its debate to Stan
ford-related issues, students are almost evenly
divided on the issue, a recent ASSU telephone
poll has found.
Of the 245 students responding, 48 percent of
the students answered "yes" to the question:
"Should the ASSU Senate be limited in the state

ments it can make on certain state, national, or
international issues?" Forty-five percent said
"no," while seven percent did not respond.
Four other poll questions asked whether stu
dents thought the senate should change its scope
to allow statements on broad issues, such as the
Persian Gulf war, or on more focused issues, like
Stanford divestment from South Africa.
The poll was conducted from Jan. 29-31. The
poll's statistical margin of error is
six percent.
The bill, which would restrict
the ability of the senate and
Council of Presidents to pass res
olutions with a national or inter
national scope, is sponsored by
graduate senators John Overdeck
and Douglas Bone.
The scope of the senate's legis
lation has been debated formally
and informally for years, but the
question has been brought to the
forefront most recently by the 20-
day-old Persian Gulf war.
In response to an anti-war
rally in November, the ASSU Sen
ate approved a resolution Nov. 15
opposing "an unprovoked, non-
U.N.-sponsored military offensive
in the Middle East."
During the past three months
of debate on the issue, some stu

dents have argued that it is a
waste of time for the ASSU Sen
ate to delve into national or inter
national issues that do not affect
Stanford students. The senators
were not elected to speak for the
students on such matters, they
contend.
At the same time, nearly half
the students polled say that
issues like the war or divestment
from foreign countries affect stu
dents, either directly or indirectly.
Many students taking this posi
tion say not taking a stand on the
issue is trying to sidestep it.
John Overdeck said the poll
results support his claim that stu
dents want the legislative body to
limit its sights to issues within
Campus Drive.
But despite his support for the
bill, originally submitted at the
Nov. 28 senate meeting, he pre
dicted the bill would be voted
down tonight. " I It's] sad it's so
predictable," he lamented.
