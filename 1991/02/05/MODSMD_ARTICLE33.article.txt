# Black Church fills void for students
## 
### Denise M. Morris Staff writer 
When they arrive at Stanford, some stu
dents feel they must relinquish their religious
needs. But the recently formed Black Church
is trying to fight this pressure by offering a dif
ferent perspective on exploring religion than
do other churches.
Some black students said that until
recently, they were uncomfortable with other
religious organizations on campus. The one
black chaplaincy on campus wasn't capable of
meeting everyone's needs, they said. Last
spring, an ecumenical committee formed what
is now the Black Church.
Rev. Floyd Thompkins, Assoc. Dean of
Memorial Church and a founder of the Black
Church, said the church represents a home,
open to "whosoever will [join] and with low
pressure. The Black Church is here to hearken
to our hurts. The message is universal, but the
means of celebration are particular."
Originally, he said he envisioned a non
denominational worship service in which black
students could thrive and be affirmed as black
Christians. From there, students would then
participate in the other chaplaincies.
But the Black Church has become a sepa
rate entity with a steady membership of over
40 people.
Senior Darrell Armstrong, the only under
graduate member of the church's planning
committee, said some students come to college
and decide what it means to be black, and reli
gion may get pushed into the background.
Therefore students need something like the

'I preach because the
issues are so pressing for
us. The church needs to
be a part of our achieve
ments again."

Black Church as a resource, he said.
Despite the name, many students of other
ethnicities attend regularly, including a num
ber of white students. Thompkins offered two
reasons: "Here we preach and speak in a direct
way, and the worship invites you to experi
ment with styles of celebration."
He said he is confident about the success of
the Black Church. "If God is worshiped and
praised and some folks' needs are met, it
would not be a failure."
Church members hike to Elliott Program
Center to attend services at 6:30 p.m. Sun
days. The planning committee bemoans the
inconvenience of the location. "We still long for
a neutral space in the middle of campus,"
Thompkins said.
The Black Church has an open pulpit, urg
ing students and others to participate in the
worship service. All one needs is "faith experi
ence and common sense," Thompkins said.
The ecumenical committee holds open meet
ings Monday nights in the Round Room of
Memorial Church.
Senior Mark Arnold, who regularly speaks

at church services, said he sees the Black
Church as "a forum to help me deliver my
message. I preach because the issues are so
pressing for us. The church needs to be a part
of our achievements again, as it was in the
[19605]."
Arnold said he finds finds the church sooth
ing â€” "a pill to get through the week." Arnold
further stressed the importance of voicing
black opinions through African tradition.
He also said he finds the Black Church lib
erating. There he has the freedom to relate the
Bible to everyday life to help uplift his race
without the fear of appearing heretical, he
said.
Diann McCants, who has a doctorate in psy
chology and is a Stanford alumna, is one of the
coordinators for the only formally recognized
black chaplaincy on campus, Rejoice in Jesus
Ministries. She also is a member of the Black
Church planning committee. Before the Black
Church "there was a lot of hate and anger in
the air," she said. "Only through the Lord can
people be set free."
As a member of the committee, Armstrong
sees its purpose as setting the agenda in the
African-American tradition. It also seeks to
inform people of other campus ministries.
Armstrong said his main role in the Black
Church is "to seek and encourage undergradu
ates to take leadership positions, take on a
black men's support group, and to show the
church is an important part of life."
Thompkins said he would like to implement
a similar plan for Chicano/Latino Protestants
in the future.
