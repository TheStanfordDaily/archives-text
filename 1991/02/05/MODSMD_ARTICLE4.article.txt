# University denies library overbilling
## Report says Stanford charged too little 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
Stanford isn't going down without a
fight.
A two-and-a-half-inch-thick report
released today by the University con
cludes that it did not overcharge the
government for library-related
research costs, as some federal officials
have alleged. If anything, the report
contends, Stanford charged the gov
ernment too little during the last
decade.
The issue of library charges is cen
tral to Stanford's ongoing dispute with
the government over the University's
indirect cost policies.
Paul Biddle, the federal regulator
who sparked the controversy, has said
Stanford overbilled the government by
$50 million for library expenses — a

sizable chunk of the $175 million in
total overbilling he says may have
occurred during the last decade. Fed
eral auditors say Biddle's estimate on
the libraries is too high, but back his
claim that Stanford charged the gov
ernment too much for library costs.
The University report released
today refutes that finding, calling it
"completely unsupported by any evi
dence or analysis."
The University's report was
prompted by an opinion issued in
September by the Defense Contract
Audit Agency. The auditing agency's
report was critical of studies used by
Stanford to determine a reasonable
amount to charge the government for
use of University libraries by
researchers.

Under federal rules, the University
may charge a portion of its library
expenses to the government as an indi
rect cost of research, since faculty
members doing federally sponsored
work here use the University's
libraries. Last year, Stanford recovered
$12 million in library expenses.
In order to determine a fair percent
age to charge the government, univer
sities may either use "default"
methodology provided by the govern
ment or conduct a "special study" to
measure their own usage patterns
more precisely.
The federal auditors concluded in
their September report that the
methodology used in Stanford's study
was problematic and that the Univer
sity had failed to provide justification

for using the study. The University's
opinion released today dismisses these
opinions as "incorrect."
The University's report is also
highly critical of allegations made by
Biddle, the campus representative of
the Office of Naval Research. ONR is
the federal agency responsible for
overseeing Stanford's research prac
tices.
Biddle has alleged that Stanford's
relationship with ONR was far too
cozy during the last decade, allowing
Stanford to recover millions of dollars
in indirect costs it was not entitled to.
In a critique of Stanford's library
study written in May 1990, Biddle said
the University's study "resembles a
black box that serves merely as a vehi
cle for feeding the University's needs
for income."
That statement, the Univer
sity report says, is "irresponsible
and inflammatory" and "has no
basis in fact."
In other instances, the Univer
sity claims Biddle "misquotes,
misuses and misinterprets" fed
eral rules and makes "unsup
ported and unspecific" allegations
of wrongdoing by Stanford — a
practice the University considers
"highly unprofessional and irre
sponsible."
A staff member of the House
Subcommittee on Oversight and
Investigations, one of four federal
agencies investigating Stanford's
research practices, defended Bid
die yesterday. "He's a profes
sional," she said. "I don't think
Stanford's basis for criticizing
him is valid."
The Navy has not allowed Bid
die to talk to the press for the last

several weeks.
The congressional investigator
was also critical of Stanford for
releasing its report to the public
before federal auditors had had a

chance to respond
to the Univer
sity's contentions.
"This is a matter
that shouldn't be
taken to the
press," she said.
Stanford
spokesperson Joel
Shurkin dismiss
sed that criti-

cism. "I didn't know we needed
her permission to issue a press
release," he said sarcastically.
University officials said yester
day that they would have pre
ferred to release the report
sooner, but were not allowed to do
so because of a confidentiality
agreement with the government.
But several local journalists
obtained copies of the Defense
Contract Audit Agency's report in
the fall through inappropriate

channels and ran stories on its
findings, said Larry Horton, asso
ciate vice president for public
affairs. Stanford could only offer
a limited response at that time, he

said.
Horton said
today's release
provides a "very
strong and con
vincing case"
that the federal
auditor's con
cerns are not
valid.
The Defense

Contract Audit Agency is likely to
issue a supplemental report
within the next several weeks
responding to Stanford's con
tentions. A federal official with
knowledge of the auditing agency
said the chance the office would
back off its findings was "very
slim."
As part of regular procedures,
the University and the Office of
Naval Research will try to negoti
ate the matter. Stanford Con

troller Frank Riddle said he is
confident a meeting of the minds
will occur. "I would assume that
reasonable parties will be able to
reach agreement on this," he said,
but added that the negotiations
over library expenses will be
"very stringent."
If Stanford and the Navy are
unable to settle, the University
has several other recourses,
including litigation, Riddle said.
In addition to the House sub
committee and the Office of Naval
Research, two other federal agen
cies are investigating Stanford's
research practices: the General
Accounting Office and the Naval
Investigative Service.
The Inspector General of the
Office of Naval Research is
expected to release a report on its
relationship with Stanford within
the next few days.
The House subcommittee,
chaired by Rep. John Dingell, D-
Mich., is expected to hold hear
ings later this month or in early
March.

highly critical of allegations made by
Biddle, the campus representative of
the Office of Naval Research. ONR is
the federal agency responsible for
overseeing Stanford's research prac
tices.
Biddle has alleged that Stanford's
relationship with ONR was far too
cozy during the last decade, allowing
Stanford to recover millions of dollars
in indirect costs it was not entitled to.
In a critique of Stanford's library
study written in May 1990, Biddle said
the University's study "resembles a
black box that serves merely as a vehi
cle for feeding the University's needs
for income."
That statement, the Univer
sity report says, is "irresponsible
and inflammatory" and "has no
basis in fact."
In other instances, the Univer
sity claims Biddle "misquotes,
misuses and misinterprets" fed
eral rules and makes "unsup
ported and unspecific" allegations
of wrongdoing by Stanford — a
practice the University considers
"highly unprofessional and irre
sponsible."
A staff member of the House
Subcommittee on Oversight and
Investigations, one of four federal
agencies investigating Stanford's
research practices, defended Bid
die yesterday. "He's a profes
sional," she said. "I don't think
Stanford's basis for criticizing
him is valid."
The Navy has not allowed Bid
die to talk to the press for the last

several weeks.
The congressional investigator
was also critical of Stanford for
releasing its report to the public
before federal auditors had had a

chance to respond
to the Univer
sity's contentions.
"This is a matter
that shouldn't be
taken to the
press," she said.
Stanford
spokesperson Joel
Shurkin dismiss
sed that criti-

cism. "I didn't know we needed
her permission to issue a press
release," he said sarcastically.
University officials said yester
day that they would have pre
ferred to release the report
sooner, but were not allowed to do
so because of a confidentiality
agreement with the government.
But several local journalists
obtained copies of the Defense
Contract Audit Agency's report in
the fall through inappropriate

channels and ran stories on its
findings, said Larry Horton, asso
ciate vice president for public
affairs. Stanford could only offer
a limited response at that time, he

said.
Horton said
today's release
provides a "very
strong and con
vincing case"
that the federal
auditor's con
cerns are not
valid.
The Defense

Contract Audit Agency is likely to
issue a supplemental report
within the next several weeks
responding to Stanford's con
tentions. A federal official with
knowledge of the auditing agency
said the chance the office would
back off its findings was "very
slim."
As part of regular procedures,
the University and the Office of
Naval Research will try to negoti
ate the matter. Stanford Con

troller Frank Riddle said he is
confident a meeting of the minds
will occur. "I would assume that
reasonable parties will be able to
reach agreement on this," he said,
but added that the negotiations
over library expenses will be
"very stringent."
If Stanford and the Navy are
unable to settle, the University
has several other recourses,
including litigation, Riddle said.
In addition to the House sub
committee and the Office of Naval
Research, two other federal agen
cies are investigating Stanford's
research practices: the General
Accounting Office and the Naval
Investigative Service.
The Inspector General of the
Office of Naval Research is
expected to release a report on its
relationship with Stanford within
the next few days.
The House subcommittee,
chaired by Rep. John Dingell, D-
Mich., is expected to hold hear
ings later this month or in early
March.

Stanford isn't going down without a
fight.
A two-and-a-half-inch-thick report
released today by the University con
cludes that it did not overcharge the
government for library-related
research costs, as some federal officials
have alleged. If anything, the report
contends, Stanford charged the gov
ernment too little during the last
decade.
The issue of library charges is cen
tral to Stanford's ongoing dispute with
the government over the University's
indirect cost policies.
Paul Biddle, the federal regulator
who sparked the controversy, has said
Stanford overbilled the government by
$50 million for library expenses — a

sizable chunk of the $175 million in
total overbilling he says may have
occurred during the last decade. Fed
eral auditors say Biddle's estimate on
the libraries is too high, but back his
claim that Stanford charged the gov
ernment too much for library costs.
The University report released
today refutes that finding, calling it
"completely unsupported by any evi
dence or analysis."
The University's report was
prompted by an opinion issued in
September by the Defense Contract
Audit Agency. The auditing agency's
report was critical of studies used by
Stanford to determine a reasonable
amount to charge the government for
use of University libraries by
researchers.

Under federal rules, the University
may charge a portion of its library
expenses to the government as an indi
rect cost of research, since faculty
members doing federally sponsored
work here use the University's
libraries. Last year, Stanford recovered
$12 million in library expenses.
In order to determine a fair percent
age to charge the government, univer
sities may either use "default"
methodology provided by the govern
ment or conduct a "special study" to
measure their own usage patterns
more precisely.
The federal auditors concluded in
their September report that the
methodology used in Stanford's study
was problematic and that the Univer
sity had failed to provide justification

for using the study. The University's
opinion released today dismisses these
opinions as "incorrect."
The University's report is also
highly critical of allegations made by
Biddle, the campus representative of
the Office of Naval Research. ONR is
the federal agency responsible for
overseeing Stanford's research prac
tices.
