# University denies library overbilling
## Report says Stanford charged too little 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
Stanford isn't going down without a
fight.
A two-and-a-half-inch-thick report
released today by the University con
cludes that it did not overcharge the
government for library-related
research costs, as some federal officials
have alleged. If anything, the report
contends, Stanford charged the gov
ernment too little during the last
decade.
The issue of library charges is cen
tral to Stanford's ongoing dispute with
the government over the University's
indirect cost policies.
Paul Biddle, the federal regulator
who sparked the controversy, has said
Stanford overbilled the government by
$50 million for library expenses â€” a

sizable chunk of the $175 million in
total overbilling he says may have
occurred during the last decade. Fed
eral auditors say Biddle's estimate on
the libraries is too high, but back his
claim that Stanford charged the gov
ernment too much for library costs.
The University report released
today refutes that finding, calling it
"completely unsupported by any evi
dence or analysis."
The University's report was
prompted by an opinion issued in
September by the Defense Contract
Audit Agency. The auditing agency's
report was critical of studies used by
Stanford to determine a reasonable
amount to charge the government for
use of University libraries by
researchers.

Under federal rules, the University
may charge a portion of its library
expenses to the government as an indi
rect cost of research, since faculty
members doing federally sponsored
work here use the University's
libraries. Last year, Stanford recovered
$12 million in library expenses.
In order to determine a fair percent
age to charge the government, univer
sities may either use "default"
methodology provided by the govern
ment or conduct a "special study" to
measure their own usage patterns
more precisely.
The federal auditors concluded in
their September report that the
methodology used in Stanford's study
was problematic and that the Univer
sity had failed to provide justification

for using the study. The University's
opinion released today dismisses these
opinions as "incorrect."
The University's report is also
highly critical of allegations made by
Biddle, the campus representative of
the Office of Naval Research. ONR is
the federal agency responsible for
overseeing Stanford's research prac
tices.
Biddle has alleged that Stanford's
relationship with ONR was far too
cozy during the last decade, allowing
Stanford to recover millions of dollars
in indirect costs it was not entitled to.
In a critique of Stanford's library
study written in May 1990, Biddle said
the University's study "resembles a
black box that serves merely as a vehi
cle for feeding the University's needs
for income."
