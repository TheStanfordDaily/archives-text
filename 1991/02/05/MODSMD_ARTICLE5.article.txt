# More students apply
## 
### Miranda Doyle Staff writer 
Rebounding from a four-year
downward trend, the number of
applications for next year's fresh
man class increased almost four
percent over last year.
The Office of Undergraduate
Admissions had received 13,457
complete applications as of Friday,
according to Assoc. Dean John
Bunnell. Last year, the number of
applicants dropped 13 percent,
hitting a 10-year low of 12,953.
The increase so far is 3.89 per
cent, but that figure could rise as
forms mailed on time but from
distant locations arrive, Bunnell
said. Also, applications with one
or two missing elements may be
added to the count if they are com
pleted.
"We were pleased with the
increase because demographics
show there [will be] a decline in
the number of high school gradu
ates through the mid-'9os," Bun
nell said.
He said he is not sure why
more students are applying to
Stanford this year. "We do not
have a context yet," he said.
Because the number of high
school seniors in California is
increasing, Bunnell said he would
have expected a larger number of
applications from California.
However, he did not attribute the
rise to California applications
alone.
Bunnell said his office consid
ers the Earthquake of 1989 to be a
factor in much of last year's drop.
Council of Presidents member
Goodwin Liu also mentioned the
earthquake as a possible factor in
last year's decrease. Because
"Stanford in general maintains its
quality and reputation pretty well
year to year," Liu said he does not
know why the number of applica
tions fluctuates.
Bunnell also said reasons for
this year's increase are hard to
specify but added that he is just
happy that the numbers are
increasing.

Between 1984 and 1990, appli
cations decreased almost 27 per
cent from 17,652 to 12,953. Appli
cations fell 9 percent from 1984 to
1985, then increased 5 percent in
1986. The numbers of applicants
declined in the following three
years, with the largest drop com
ing last year.
Bunnell said he does not have
figures yet but expects that other
colleges will see similar increases.
Bill Fitzsimmons, dean of
admissions at Harvard University,
said his school has also experi
enced an increase this year. The
admissions office received 12,409
applications, an increase of almost
two percent over last year's
12,190. Fitzsimmons said this fig
ure is expected to rise as more are
received.
Bunnell said he was "pleas
antly surprised" by the increase
but noted that numbers are not
everything. "The bottom line is
not the numbers but the quality,
which we are looking at now," he
said.
The admissions staff is now
undertaking the task of reading
the applications. Offers have been
made to roughly 2,500 applicants
in past years.
