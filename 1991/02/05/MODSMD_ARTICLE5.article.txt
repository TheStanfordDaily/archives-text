Rebounding from a four-year
downward trend, the number of
applications for next year's fresh
man class increased almost four
percent over last year.
The Office of Undergraduate
Admissions had received 13,457
complete applications as of Friday,
according to Assoc. Dean John
Bunnell. Last year, the number of
applicants dropped 13 percent,
hitting a 10-year low of 12,953.
The increase so far is 3.89 per
cent, but that figure could rise as
forms mailed on time but from
distant locations arrive, Bunnell
said. Also, applications with one
or two missing elements may be
added to the count if they are com
pleted.
"We were pleased with the
increase because demographics
show there [will be] a decline in
the number of high school gradu
ates through the mid-'9os," Bun
nell said.
