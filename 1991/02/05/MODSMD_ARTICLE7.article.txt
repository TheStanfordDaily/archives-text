# Bow and arrow search illegal?
## 
### Howard Libit Staff writer 
A Palo Alto resident appeared in small claims
court yesterday asking for retribution for an alleged
illegal search conducted by two Stanford Police offi
cers late last year.
Ben Bailey, 50, contacted The Daily with his story,
but Stanford Police officials refused to comment on
the case until the judge reaches a decision.
Bailey, a gardener in Palo Alto for 21 years, has a
history of run-ins with police and said he believes he
is being targeted by local police for his past involve
ment in forcing all California police departments to
reveal data on complaints of police harassment.
He said he was bicycling down Stanford Avenue
Dec. 30 on his way to Foothill College for archery

practice with his bow and arrows when he was
stopped by two officers and cited for carrying a
weapon in a game refuge. The entire Stanford cam
pus is considered a refuge, he said.
One officer conducted an "embarrassing and
humiliating" nine-minute body search while the
other examined the contents of his knapsack, Bailey
said. They confiscated his bow and his bicycle, which
did not have a two-dollar license, he said.
Bailey later spoke with Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer, who allegedly said that the citation
was proper and valid. Bailey said Niemeyer also
allegedly "extended apologies for the officers' correct
behavior" and dropped all charges.
Both sides testified in front of Judge James Heath
