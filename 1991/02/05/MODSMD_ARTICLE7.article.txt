# Bow and arrow search illegal?
## 
### Howard Libit Staff writer 
A Palo Alto resident appeared in small claims
court yesterday asking for retribution for an alleged
illegal search conducted by two Stanford Police offi
cers late last year.
Ben Bailey, 50, contacted The Daily with his story,
but Stanford Police officials refused to comment on
the case until the judge reaches a decision.
Bailey, a gardener in Palo Alto for 21 years, has a
history of run-ins with police and said he believes he
is being targeted by local police for his past involve
ment in forcing all California police departments to
reveal data on complaints of police harassment.
He said he was bicycling down Stanford Avenue
Dec. 30 on his way to Foothill College for archery

practice with his bow and arrows when he was
stopped by two officers and cited for carrying a
weapon in a game refuge. The entire Stanford cam
pus is considered a refuge, he said.
One officer conducted an "embarrassing and
humiliating" nine-minute body search while the
other examined the contents of his knapsack, Bailey
said. They confiscated his bow and his bicycle, which
did not have a two-dollar license, he said.
Bailey later spoke with Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer, who allegedly said that the citation
was proper and valid. Bailey said Niemeyer also
allegedly "extended apologies for the officers' correct
behavior" and dropped all charges.
Both sides testified in front of Judge James Heath
yesterday in Palo Alto Municipal
Court, and Heath took the case
under advisement. He did not say
when he would make his final
decision.
Foothill College has a archery
range open to the public where
Bailey said he has practiced since
November 1987. Bailey said this
was "the 174 th time he cycled
with his bow along the same
route" to practice at the range.
The $250 lawsuit against the
two officers alleges they violated
Bailey's right to privacy by
searching his backpack. Bailey
claims the 1975 Supreme Court
decision U.S. v. Chad wick stated
that a search warrant is necessary
for an officer to search someone's
luggage unless there is an imme
diate threat to public safety.
Bailey believes his case is sig
nificant even though he is asking
for a relatively small judgment
against the officers.
"To be humiliated like that
hurts worse than a physical beat
ing," Bailey said. "It also demon
strates that citizens are subject to
illegal search at any time without
legal redress."
Bailey does not expect to win
his case, despite the Supreme
Court precedent he believes sup
ports his argument.
"The judge will not be as con
cerned with my civil rights as
with police morale. He will think
that a verdict in my favor would
set off a string of frivolous law
suits from cop-haters," Bailey
said.
"The judge has no concern
with the human rights and dig
nity of someone in my economic
class," he added.
Bailey claimed that area police
departments have been con
stantly harassing him because he
fought against a change in the
Police Officers Bill of Rights, a
California law passed in 1982.
Among other things, the
revised law allowed police depart
ments to refuse to publicize the
number of citizens' complaints
filed and disciplinary actions
taken against officers because
they were based upon personnel
files, Bailey said. He attended
every Palo Alto City Council
meeting for two years asking for
these figures until the law was
changed Jan. 1 last year, he said.
Since that time, Palo Alto
police officers have allegedly fol
lowed him in squad cars and
stared at him for long periods of
time, he claims.
"I have seen police cars a lot
more often than chance would
allow," Bailey said. "I can't
believe that (the two officers) did
not know who I was. It has been a
big topic at the Palo Alto and
Stanford Police Departments."
Bailey said he has been unable
to record the squad cars' numbers
because the officers drive away
quickly whenever he approaches.
This is not the first time Bailey
has filed a lawsuit against a police
officer who searched his bag.
In 1983 Bailey sued a Palo Alto
police officer who allegedly
searched his pack for drugs when
Bailey was standing next to a
friend who was smoking mari
juana. The judge ruled in favor of
the police officer in that case.
Bailey also claims he has been
searched four or five other times
by police officers because he is a
gardener of a lower economic
class. He has allegedly received a
letter from the Palo Alto Police
officially warning him against
interfering with officers in the
course of duty.
Bailey now expects further
retaliation from local police
departments because he was
against the change in the Police
Officers' Bill of Rights.
"Police officers know lots of
thugs. They will probably have
someone step out of the bushes
and beat me up or stick a knife in
me," he said.
