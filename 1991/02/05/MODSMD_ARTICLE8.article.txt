# Women face challenges in ROTC
## 
### Eleni Kirkas Staff writer 
For years, the Marines have
advertised their search for "a few
good men." But in freshman
Sarah Puffer, they've found one
good woman.
"Some people are shocked
when I tell them I'm a woman
Marine," said Puffer, the only
woman in the joint Marine
Reserve Officers Training Corps
program for Stanford and UC-
Berkeley students.
Puffer is one of several Stan
ford women in ROTC programs at
Bay Area schools — women who
face a particular set of concerns
about their future in the military.
Despite the surprised reactions
she sometimes gets, Puffer said
she is happy in the Marine Corps.
"The thing I like about being a
Marine is the challenge that it

poses," she said. "I'm learning a
lot of skills that I wouldn't learn
otherwise."
Puffer, who wants to train in
military intelligence or communi
cations, said she decided to join
ROTC after visiting Stanford and
meeting women who had had pos
itive experiences in other pro
grams. Another reason was the
range of opportunities the Marine
Corps could provide, she said.
Female Stanford students par
ticipate in Army, Navy, Air Force
and Marine ROTC programs
administered through neighbor
ing universities such as UC-
Berkeley and San Jose State Uni
versity. ROTC programs at Stan
ford closed during the early 1970s
because of protests over the Viet
nam War.
Despite the growing acceptance
of women in the armed forces,
there are still inequalities. For

instance, women are barred from
certain jobs in the military — such
as being fighter pilots and holding
infantry positions — because they
are not allowed in combat.
In addition, Congress limits the
number of women admitted to
ROTC each year to 10 percent of
the total enrollment although
there is no limit to that total,
according to Marine Maj. Michael
Finnie, public affairs officer at the
Navy ROTC unit at UC-Berkeley.
Aside from this limit, however,
the admission process for men
and women is the same, although
competition among women is
harder since there are fewer
spaces, Finnie said.
Although women and men
have similar reasons for joining
ROTC, being a woman in the mil
itary poses special challenges, one
participant said.
"It is difficult for both men and
women to mesh ideas of feminin
ity with the role women must play
in the military, said Amy Welch, a
junior in Air Force ROTC."
Welch added that it is hard to
define a professional image of a
military woman, noting that Air
Force regulations require women
to be "feminine and attractive" at
all times.
At some military balls, for
example, female cadets are
required to wear their uniforms,
while at others they must wear
civilian clothing, she said. But
men always wear their uniforms,
she added.
Freshman Kelly O'Connor said
she joined Air Force ROTC
because of the career training and
job security the military would
provide and because the pro
gram's scholarship money would
help pay for her education.
Once in ROTC, however,
O'Connor decided that the mili
tary was not right for her and quit
the program at the end of last
quarter.
ROTC provides the option of
dropping out after one year with
out further obligation to the mili
tary.
None of these women said they
have experienced hostility or con
descension from any of their male
classmates in ROTC. "They treat
me like an equal, and we get along
well," said Puffer of her fellow

'They treat me like
an equal, and we
get along well.'

Marines.
Welch also said she feels
respected by her colleagues here,
but she noted that at national Air
Force ROTC leadership camp last
summer there was grumbling
from some men after she won the
prestigious Commandant's
Award, the top honor. Welch was
the only woman to win any of the
25 prizes presented at the gather
ing.
O'Connor said she did some
times feel that women were
treated as "extras" because the
military is geared primarily
toward men.
Puffer also said that she has
sometimes felt uncomfortable
about her position as the only
woman in Marine ROTC but
received a very positive response
when she approached Finnie, her
commanding officer at the UC-
Berkeley unit, about the problem.
He has taken steps to make her
feel more comfortable, including
bringing women Marine officers
in to speak to the students, Puffer
said.
The Air Force ROTC unit has
not brought in any female officers
speak to students yet this year,
but Welch said she hopes to meet
with younger women in ROTC to
discuss issues pertinent to women
in the military, such as marriage
and discrimination.
