# Women face challenges in ROTC

For years, the Marines have
advertised their search for "a few
good men." But in freshman
Sarah Puffer, they've found one
good woman.
"Some people are shocked
when I tell them I'm a woman
Marine," said Puffer, the only
woman in the joint Marine
Reserve Officers Training Corps
program for Stanford and UC-
Berkeley students.
Puffer is one of several Stan
ford women in ROTC programs at
Bay Area schools — women who
face a particular set of concerns
about their future in the military.
Despite the surprised reactions
she sometimes gets, Puffer said
she is happy in the Marine Corps.
"The thing I like about being a
Marine is the challenge that it

poses," she said. "I'm learning a
lot of skills that I wouldn't learn
otherwise."
Puffer, who wants to train in
military intelligence or communi

ROTC after visiting Stanford and
meeting women who had had pos

range of opportunities the Marine
Corps could provide, she said.
Female Stanford students par

and Marine ROTC programs
administered through neighbor

Berkeley and San Jose State Uni

ford closed during the early 1970s
because of protests over the Viet
nam War.
Despite the growing acceptance
of women in the armed forces,
there are still inequalities. For

instance, women are barred from
certain jobs in the military — such
as being fighter pilots and holding
infantry positions — because they
are not allowed in combat.
In addition, Congress limits the
number of women admitted to
ROTC each year to 10 percent of
the total enrollment although
there is no limit to that total,
according to Marine Maj. Michael
Finnie, public affairs officer at the
Navy ROTC unit at UC-Berkeley.
Aside from this limit, however,
the admission process for men
and women is the same, although
competition among women is
harder since there are fewer
spaces, Finnie said.
Although women and men
have similar reasons for joining
ROTC, being a woman in the mil
itary poses special challenges, one
