## Bush doubts Iraq can be beaten by air 
### 
.DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) - A U.S.
Marine amphibious assault force is moving
into place in the Persian Gulf, but allied com
manders say any ground war to retake Kuwait
will probably wait until Iraqi forces take even
more pounding from the air.
The mission-a-minute air assault continued
today, with bomb-laden warplanes roaring off
desert runways to strike targets in Iraq and
occupied Kuwait. The allies are fast closing in
on the 50,000-sortie mark, the U.S. military
said.
Prime targets have been Republican Guard
troops and resupply lines to Iraqi troops in
Kuwait and southern Iraq.
With the Persian Gulf war entering its
fourth week today, President Bush said he is
sending his top military men to the war zone to
assess the campaign. Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, will visit the Gulf later this
week — their first wartime visit to the region.
Bush said the top-level visit did not signal that a
ground war was about to begin. But he said he
doubted air power alone would drive Saddam Hus
sein's armies from Kuwait.
"My own view is I'm somewhat skeptical that it
would," the president said yesterday.
That seemed to reflect the thinking in the field.
One U.S. Air Force commander, Col. John Mcßroom
of the First Tactical Fighter Wing, told reporters in
Saudi Arabia a ground assault eventually would be
necessary to oust Iraqi troops from Kuwait. But he
said he hoped senior commanders would be patient.
"I would like to think the air war would dictate
the ground war," he said. "I'd like the Army to go in
and move the last soldier out instead of the,last
100,000. ... I would hope we do not go in on' the
ground until we have almost completely obliterated
him from the air."
The cornerstone of any ground offensive may well
be an amphibious assault. Pentagon sources say a
U.S. Marine task force is maneuvering into position
after a practice seaborne attack on the southern
shore of the Saudi Arabian peninsula.
The task force — made up of about 17,000
Marines — is "slowly working its way north," said
one Marine Corps officer. "We intend to keep Sad
dam awake, and let him worry about where we
might land."
The Marines have massed around 90,000 of their
number in the Gulf region — which amounts to
about 75 percent of the Corps. "With that many in
the region, it's clear the Pentagon brass wants a
classic Marine beach assault," said a senior military
officer.
Marine commanders say an amphibious attack, if
it comes, will be the most complicated and danger
ous part of an offensive to retake Kuwait. The troops
who would take part are well aware of that.
"Most of the people realize they will have heavy
casualties, but no one likes to talk about it too
much," said Lance Cpl. Rod Sturkie, stationed
aboard the USS Okinawa, an amphibious helicopter
vessel. "Over the months, we got close and a lot of
friendships have developed."
