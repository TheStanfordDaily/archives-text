Chinese dissidents face trial
BEIJING (AP) — A Chinese court today
began trying the first of four leaders of the
1989 democracy movement who are charged
with plotting to overthrow the Communist
government.
Tho proceeding marked a new phase in a
month-long series of trials of several dozen
leading participants in the movement.
Most of the others were charged with
counter-revolutionary incitement and sen
tenced to up to seven years in prison. Today's
defendant, 29-year-old Chen Xiaoping, is one
of only four charged so far with sedition. It is a
crime punishable by death.
Human rights activists have suggested the
Chinese, stung by earlier Western outrage over
the crackdown, are trying to resolve the cases
now while the world is preoccupied with the
Persian Gulf War.
Most of the democracy activists tried over
the past month have been charged with
counter-revolutionary incitement and sen
tenced to terms ranging from two to seven
years.
Crash sites may yield
MIA remains in Laos
BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) — Military experts
are digging up two U.S. plane crash sites in
southern Laos after finding evidence they may
yield remains of U.S. soldiers missing from the
Vietnam War, a U.S. spokesman said today.
A U.S. army team flew to Laos from
Bangkok on Sunday to begin the project, which
is expected to take up to three weeks, said
James Williams, the spokesman of the U.S.
Embassy in Bangkok.
Laotian experts will work jointly with the
20-member team from the Joint Casualty Res
olution Center based in Hawaii, he said.
A joint team surveyed the two sites in Jan
uary and May 1990 and concluded they may
contain remains of Americans listed as missing
in action from the war, he said.
There are more than 2,000 Americans listed
as missing from the war, with a quarter of
them in Laos.
U.S. planes bombed Communist insurgent
positions in Laos during the war, which ended
in 1975 with Communist takeovers in Viet
nam, Laos and Cambodia.
Sikh political leader killed
AMRITSAR, India (AP) — Sikh separatist
gunmen ambushed and killed a Sikh political
leader who opposed their secessionist move
ment, police said. Three of the politician's
police bodyguards also died in the attack.
Elsewhere in the northern Punjab state,
Sikh militants killed at least 10 other people
since Sunday night, bringing to at least 386
the number of deaths this year, Indian news
agencies reported.
Jarnail Singh, president of the Rangretta
Dal, a political party of low-caste Sikhs, was
attacked on a dirt road leading to Bhattiwal,
where Singh had gone to visit relatives. The
village is 65 miles northeast of Amritsar, the
center of the Sikh secessionist campaign.
