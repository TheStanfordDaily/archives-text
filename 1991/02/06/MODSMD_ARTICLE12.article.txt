JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) - Pros
ecutors at the kidnapping and assault trial of Win
nie Mandela today tried to head off a defense bid
for dismissal. Police later swung clubs to hold
back her enthusiastic supporters outside, injuring
several people.
The melee broke out when a confident-looking
Mrs. Mandela emerged with her husband, African
National Congress leader Nelson Mandela, from
an initial court session. They were greeted by
about 200 cheering supporters, and Mrs. Mandela
responded with clenched fist salutes.
Police, battling to restrain the excited crowd,
used clubs to disperse some of the chanting peo
ple. The injuries appeared minor.
The case against Mrs. Mandela threatens her
credibility as a black activist and possibly that of
her husband. It could even hinder political negoti
ations between this country's white minority gov
ernment and the black meuority.
The ANC, the country's leading opposition
group, has called the charges against Mrs. Man
dela harassment by white authorities.
Mrs. Mandela has denied allegations she par
ticipated in the kidnapping and assault of four
youths in December 1988. The youngest, 14-year
old Stompei Seipei, was killed.

State prosecutors responded today to defense
claims that the state had failed to provide suffi
ciently detailed information on the charges to
allow Mrs. Mandela and her co-defendants to pre
pare their defense.
Prosecutor Jan Swanepoel said the state had
provided considerable detail. He said it is impossi
ble to give every detail because many people were
involved in the assaults and not all details are
available.
Prosecutors say members of Mrs. Mandela's
former bodyguard unit, the Mandela United Foot
ball Club, abducted the youths and took them to
Mrs. Mandela's Soweto home, where the beatings
allegedly occurred. A judge has ruled Mrs. Man
dela was present during the assault.
According to prosecutors, the bodyguards were
motivated by accusation that the four youths had
sexual relations with a white Methodist minister
and that Stompei was a police spy.
Mandela was in prison at the time, and the con
troversial bodyguard unit was disbanded after
ward.
Mandela was freed a year ago as the govern
ment of F.W. de Klerk launched a series of
reforms aimed at giving blacks more rights and
political power.
