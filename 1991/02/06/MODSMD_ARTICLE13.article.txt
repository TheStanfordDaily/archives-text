RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) -
Americans make up 70 percent of the
705,000 allied troops and have flown
84 percent of the Persian Gulf War's
combat missions — but are just one of
31 military partners in the anti-Iraq
coalition.
In the war's first 19 days, troops
from Saudi Arabia and Qatar engaged
in ground combat and eight countries
besides the United States participated
in bombing raids.
The Saudis had as of Monday suf
fered the most casualties among the
allies' 31 confirmed deaths — 18 to the
Americans' 13.
U.S. commanders have praised the
cooperation of their coalition partners.
"Whatever they do is a relief. If you
have a nation sending in 500 troops to

guard mcyor roads or installations,
that's 500 less of our own forces we
don't have to siphon off to do those
jobs," said a senior U.S. military
spokesman, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
The largest armed contingents
come from the United States, Britain,
Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Syria and
France
Among the lesser coalition part
ners, the Qataris received high marks
in the battle for Khafji, the biggest
ground engagement of the war to date.
"These guys are real fighters," a
U.S. Marine captain said of the
Qataris' performance at Khafji. "They
are very aggressive."
According to allied accounts, the
Qataris and Saudis fought house-to

house and tank-to-tank to dislodge a
brigade-size Iraqi force that struck
across the border to seize the north
eastern Saudi town last week.
The number of coalition partners
may be more important than individ
ual contributions, analysts say.
They say the inclusion in Operation
Desert Storm of 13 Arab and Islamic
countries serves to counter claims that
the conflict is being waged by Western
ers against the Muslim world.
However, some of the smaller
Islamic states deployed in rear areas
stress that they became involved with
the aim of protecting Saudi Arabia's
holy places — not to go on the offen
sive against Muslim brethren.
To date, only the Americans, Saudis
and Qataris have fought ground bat

ties against Iraqi infantry and armor.
The war so far has been largely an
aerial campaign, with the United
States, Britain, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
France, Italy, Bahrain, Qatar and
Canada flying offensive operations.
The Saudis have flown more than 6
percent of total missions, the second
largest number after the United
States, and produced the allies' first
double-kill of Iraqi warplanes.
Next are the British, who have
accounted for nearly 5 percent of coali
tion sorties, including dangerous, low
level raids against airfields. Their
Lynx helicopters have also helped U.S.
forces virtually knock Iraq's small
navy out of the war. The Kuwaiti air
force-in-exile ranks fourth in missions.
