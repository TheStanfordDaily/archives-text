# S&L bailout set at $30 billion
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Senate Banking Committee today
authorized an additional $30 bil
lion in taxpayer funds to continue
closing failed savings and loan
institutions.
The money was approved by
voice vote. The Bush administra
tion says the Resolution Trust
Corporation, which is managing
the S&L bailout, will have to cease
operations by the end of the

month unless it gets the new cash
infusion.
Congress voted $50 billion for
the bailout in August 1989 while
authorizing the corporation to
borrow additional funds to buy
assets from failed institutions.
The $30 billion authorized by
the Senate panel is subject to sep
arate action by the appropriations
committees of the House and Sen
ate. The authorization is not

expected to be acted on by the
House Banking Committee until
later in the month.
Sens. Richard Shelby, D-Ala.,
and Robert Graham, D-Fla., criti
cized the Trust Corporation's
management of the more than
$140 billion in assets that it seized
from failing institutions. They
said the slow pace
of disposing of those assets has
depressed the real estate market.
