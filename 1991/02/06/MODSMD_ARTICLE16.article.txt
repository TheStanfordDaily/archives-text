# Banking reforms proposed
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Bush administration
today proposed the first comprehensive overhaul of
the U.S. financial system in half a century, a plan
that would force fundamental changes affecting
nearly every American who borrows or saves.
For the first time since the establishment of fed
eral deposit insurance in 1934, government'guaran
tees to bank customers would shrink rather than
expand.
And, longstanding laws barring commercial and
industrial companies from owning banks would
crumble, as would the division of banking from the
insurance and securities industries.
The long-awaited proposals, presented by top
White House officials, must be approved by
Congress.
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said that the
changes were critical to overhaul an outdated finan

cial system and ensure that the overall economy is
not threatened by weak banks.
"Today, our banking system is under stress. Our
banks are hampered by out-of-date laws," Brady said
in unveiling the administration's reform plan.
"We must modernize our banking laws to deal
with the realities of the marketplace," Brady said.
"If we expect to exert as a country world economic
leadership in the 21st Century, we must have a mod
ern banking system."
The administration would relax decades-old
restrictions on interstate banking within three years,
making it easier for giants like Citicorp and Bank of
America to establish branches competing with local
institutions.
It would prune a thicket of independent regulato
ry agencies and, in the process, give the administra
tion more control of financial regulation.
