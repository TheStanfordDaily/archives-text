# Budget: Bush plans to tap wages
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - People
who default on federal student
loans could face government
action to withhold the money
from their wages, under a pro
posal in President Bush's budget.
Prospective first-time home
buyers who have Individual
Retirement Accounts could with
draw up to $10,000 for a down
payment without paying the usual
penalty.
And, people who like to hike
national forests could be required
to pay more fees for the trails'
upkeep.
The wage garnishment, IRA
withdrawal and recreational fee
proposals are among the more
direct ways that the $1.45 trillion
budget proposal for fiscal 1992
would affect the average Ameri
can. The Bush administration
sent its budget to Congress on
Monday.
The budget comes home to citi
zens in countless ways, from cuts
in strategic weapons and crop
insurance to plans for shifting a
variety of federal programs to the
states. But the impact on an indi
vidual is hard to measure.
Student loans, home-buying
and the cost of going camping, on
the other hand, are pretty tangi
ble.

'The budget includes
proposals to help
reduce illness and
death from pre
ventable diseases.'

At the end of 1990, outstanding
student loans under the govern
ment-guaranteed program totaled
nearly $53 billion, roughly double
the amount in 1982. Gross default
rates also increased, from 12.5
percent in 1980 to 16 percent last
year.
The president's proposal would
authorize wage garnishment of
defaulters and enable state and
federal agencies to trade informa
tion to locate them. It would also
require debtors to show hardship
before having their default dis
charged by declaring bankruptcy.
The budget would expand user
fees at Corps of Engineers sites to
include day use of developed
recreational sites, such as boat
launching ramps, and all
overnight camping. Some fees are
already charged for overnight
camping, averaging $6 a night,
but each site has a free camping

area, corps spokesman Dave
Hewitt said.
The budget would also expand
the types of recreational facilities
and services for which the Forest
Service could charge fees. The
money would go for rehabilitation
and reconstruction of trails and
facilities.
Programs for the needy would
receive modest increases. There
would be more money for health
care for women and young chil
dren and to help public housing
tenants buy their homes.
"The budget includes propos
als to help reduce illness and
death from preventable diseases,
and to reverse the long-term trend
of underinvestment in children,"
Bush said.
The Center on Budget and Pol
icy Priorities, however, said the
budget "would confer large new
benefits on the very wealthy ...
and risk sizable reductions in
assistance for the poor in future
years."
Robert Greenstein, executive
director of the liberal think tank,
said 80 percent of the programs
that would be turned over to the
states are intended to help low
income people, who he said are
weaker politically in many state
capitals than in Washington.
