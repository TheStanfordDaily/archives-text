## Celebrating culture 
### 
Month-long festivities
offer opportunities for
blacks, non-blacks alike

BY MAKING BLACK Libera
tion Month part of the Cen
tennial Celebration, the Uni
versity has given the event the
recognition it deserves. We hope
the entire student body will follow
suit.
The inclusion of black students
and faculty, after all, is unquestion
ably one of the most telling forms
of progress during Stanford's first
century. As we begin to shape its
second, the status of blacks at
Stanford will prove crucial.
This year's theme, "One Hun
dred Years of Change: Visions for
Our Future," should provide sub
stantial insight into developments
in the past and directions for the
future.
For instance, last weekend's
opening ceremony illustrated some
of the intellectual and cultural con
tributions blacks have made in the
United States, while beginning to
ponder what form future contribu
tions might take.
Upcoming programming,
including readings of African-
American poetry and a soul food
dinner, will further examine black
culture.
In light of the range of events
and speakers Black Liberation
Month provides, it is troubling that
many non-black students still view
it as irrelevant.

To paraphrase Cornel West,
director of Afro-American studies
at Princeton, learning about the
black experience was never meant
to be solely for Afro-Americans. It
was meant to try to redefine what
it means to be human, what it
means to be modern, what it
means to be American, because
people of African descent in this
country are profoundly human,
profoundly modern, profoundly
American.
At the same time, some non
blacks interested in learning more
about the black experience might
worry that they would be unwel
come at the month's events.
While the month primarily aims
to give black students a forum to
celebrate their heritage, it also
seeks to share its legacy with oth
ers.
The "Black" in Black Liberation
Month does not mean it seeks to
isolate black students and faculty
from the rest of the campus; in
fact, all of its events are free and
open to the public.
Nevertheless, some continue to
view the event as separatist.
Whether this feeling is the
result of insufficient effort on the
part of the organizers or prior
biases on the part of the non-black
students does not matter. What
matters is how we react to it.
Rather than pointing fingers,
both sides must make adjust
ments. While blacks need to make
it clear that all are welcome, non
blacks must be willing to try and
see Stanford and the United States
from a radically different perspec
tive.
