# Sexual assault task force gives report
## 
### Michael Friedly Senior staff writer 
After more than a year of research and
analysis, the Sexual Assault Task Force
released its report yesterday amid campus
wide praise.
However, University officials are con
cerned about the cost of implementing its
recommendations.
Included in the recommendations are a
new full-time Coordinator of Sexual
Assault Response Services, dramatic
changes in the method of proving a viola
tion of the Fundamental Standard and the
drafting of a formal policy supported by
University President Donald Kennedy on
unacceptable sexual behavior.
In addition, the report recommends cre
ating a standing committee of faculty, staff
and students that would monitor the Uni
versity's response to individual sexual
assault cases "so that this issue does not
sink into any black hole," said Patricia Fabi
ano, director of the Cowell Health Promo
tion Program and co-chair of the task force.
The recommendations come at the end
of a year-long examination of the resources
available to rape and sexual assault victims,
education and awareness programs and the
judicial process of prosecuting students
charged with sexual assault.
The members "did a very thoughtful job
in an area in which it is often difficult to be
thoughtful," said Judicial Affairs Officer
Sally Cole, whose office is responsible for

prosecuting students charged with rape
and sexual assault.
The recommendations "address a wide
range of issues, and [the report] does so
thoughtfully and constructively," according
to acting Dean of Student Affairs Norm
Robinson, who approved and released the
final draft of the report.
Effect on Judicial Affairs
The task-force recommendations may
have far-reaching effects on the handling of
Fundamental Standard cases other than
sexual assault. Since one problem in the
prosecution of sexual-assault cases is the
absence of third-party witnesses, one pro
posal is to consider modifying the require
ment for "proof beyond a reasonable
doubt."
Instead, Judicial Affairs would have the
option to use the less stringent standard of
a "preponderance of evidence," as required
in California civil cases, or "clear and con
vincing evidence," according to the report.
The task force also recommended that one
of the less stringent standards be applied to
all Fundamental Standard cases, not just
those involving sexual assault.
Judicial Affairs has been criticized in the
past for being unable to handle sexual assault
cases because of the high burden of legal
proof needed. "I think that there are a vari
ety of characteristics in the [University's]
judicial process that are unnecessarily
