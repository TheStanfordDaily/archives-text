# Sexual assault task force gives report
## 
### Michael Friedly Senior staff writer 
After more than a year of research and
analysis, the Sexual Assault Task Force
released its report yesterday amid campus
wide praise.
However, University officials are con
cerned about the cost of implementing its
recommendations.
Included in the recommendations are a
new full-time Coordinator of Sexual
Assault Response Services, dramatic
changes in the method of proving a viola
tion of the Fundamental Standard and the
drafting of a formal policy supported by
University President Donald Kennedy on
unacceptable sexual behavior.
In addition, the report recommends cre
ating a standing committee of faculty, staff
and students that would monitor the Uni
versity's response to individual sexual
assault cases "so that this issue does not
sink into any black hole," said Patricia Fabi
ano, director of the Cowell Health Promo
tion Program and co-chair of the task force.
The recommendations come at the end
of a year-long examination of the resources
available to rape and sexual assault victims,
education and awareness programs and the
judicial process of prosecuting students
charged with sexual assault.
The members "did a very thoughtful job
in an area in which it is often difficult to be
thoughtful," said Judicial Affairs Officer
Sally Cole, whose office is responsible for

prosecuting students charged with rape
and sexual assault.
The recommendations "address a wide
range of issues, and [the report] does so
thoughtfully and constructively," according
to acting Dean of Student Affairs Norm
Robinson, who approved and released the
final draft of the report.
Effect on Judicial Affairs
The task-force recommendations may
have far-reaching effects on the handling of
Fundamental Standard cases other than
sexual assault. Since one problem in the
prosecution of sexual-assault cases is the
absence of third-party witnesses, one pro
posal is to consider modifying the require
ment for "proof beyond a reasonable
doubt."
Instead, Judicial Affairs would have the
option to use the less stringent standard of
a "preponderance of evidence," as required
in California civil cases, or "clear and con
vincing evidence," according to the report.
The task force also recommended that one
of the less stringent standards be applied to
all Fundamental Standard cases, not just
those involving sexual assault.
Judicial Affairs has been criticized in the
past for being unable to handle sexual assault
cases because of the high burden of legal
proof needed. "I think that there are a vari
ety of characteristics in the [University's]
judicial process that are unnecessarily
legalistic and inappropriately
legalistic," Cole said.
Cole added that she supports
reducing the standard of proof
necessary to convict students of
violations. "It is likely that in
cases that are now not proven
adequately, there would be more
outcomes of students being found
in violation of the Fundamental
Standard" under a new require
ment of proof, she said.
In addition, a relaxed standard
of proof would allow her office to
prosecute students that it does
not under the current rules
because of a lack of evidence, she
said.
Committee of 15
The recommendation to reduce
the standard of proof will likely be
evaluated by the Committee of 15,
a University group that decides
issues related to the judicial pro
cess. In addition, the committee
will probably decide whether a list
of rights for sexual assault victims
should be created and whether
students charged with sexual
assault can be required to cooper
ate in the investigation.
"There have been cases in
which a student has delayed the
proceedings by failing to cooper
ate in the initial investigation into
his/her conduct," the report
states.
The Judicial Affairs Office is
governed by the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968, which
the committee would have to
modify if it implemented any
changes.
Furthermore, the task force
recommended that Judicial
Affairs charge students accused of
rape with lesser sexual assault
violations that can be more easily
proven if rape itself cannot be
established. For example, a stu

dent can be charged with a lesser
form of sexual assault in a case in
which "acquaintance rape is dis
puted, but there is no dispute that
a student disrobed another
against his or her will," the report
states.
'Repositioning' cutbacks
Some of the goals of the task
force may have to be postponed,
however, because of budgetary
concerns, Robinson said.
"Because of 'repositioning,'
those recommendations that have
budgetary implications will need
to be studied closely," Robinson
wrote in a letter to Fabiano and
senior Suzanne O'Brien, co-chair
of the task force.
"It is unlikely that we will be
able to implement any recommen
dations to create new positions.
Instead, we will be looking for
ways to carry out those functions
using existing resources," he
wrote.
Specifically, the responsibilities
of the coordinator can be spread
out to current positions so that a
new position will not have to be
created, he said yesterday. The
report also calls for increased
funding for existing programs
about sexual assault, such as the
Rape Education Project, but fund
ing will be scarce because of Uni
versity cutbacks.
Other recommendations in
clude:
• Adopting written procedures
for handling sexual assault,
including a statement of confiden
tiality and a statement of a vic
tim's rights,
• Identifying and training "key
personnel who are likely to receive
initial reports of sexual assault,"
• Including sexual assault as an
example of a Fundamental Stan
dard violation in University publi
cations, and
• Annually publishing the pol
icy on unacceptable sexual con
duct.

The task force also sought to
bring Stanford in line with state
legislation passed last year deal
ing with sexual assault. The Uni
versity is required to "establish
and utilize clear and consistent

It is unlikely that we
will be able to imple
ment any recommen
dations to create new
positions' because of
budget cuts.

sexual assault policies which may
be incorporated into the current
disciplinary policies," according to
a bill passed by the California
Assembly and signed into law last
July.
In addition, all universities and
colleges in California are required
to provide sexual assault victims
with information about options
available to them, including
reporting the assault to the police
and seeking counseling.
The task force began its work
in November 1989, partly in
response to a 1988 survey con
ducted by the Rape Education
Project that exposed the fre
quency of sexual assault at Stan
ford.
From a survey given to 2,400
Stanford students, the project
found that one out of three
women and one out of eight men
said they had "full sexual activity"
against their will, almost all of
them with acquaintances. Thirty
nine percent of the incidents
occurred at Stanford and only two
percent of the cases were reported
to the police.
Committee membership
The 21-member task force
included eight students, as well as

Stanford Police Chief Marvin Her
rington, Senior University Coun
sel Susan Hoerger, Counseling
and Psychological Services Direc
tor Alejandro Martinez, Associate
Dean of Memorial Church Diana
Akiyama and Assoc. Dean of Resi
dential Education Alice Supton.
The recommendations were
submitted to Robinson in Novem
ber for approval and were released
yesterday
"There may be some students
for whom this strikes a very per
sonal note, students that have
been the victim of sexual assault.
This report may be the impetus
for some students to deal with
that," Robinson said.
Fabiano said she was very
pleased about the outcome of the
report, calling it"the final prod
uct of something that was really
positive."
She said she was disappointed
the University does not have the
money to fund the position of sex
ual assault response coordinator
but was optimistic that the recom
mendations would be fulfilled in
the future.
"The task force felt and feels
strongly that we need a visible,
accessible person who is specifi
cally designated to coordinate a
comprehensive approach to sexual
assault," she said. The coordina
tor would provide for the "maxi
mization of education and mini
mization of duplication of
efforts," she said.
But she said she understood
that Robinson felt "it doesn't fit
into the current reorganization
and restructuring of the Univer
sity right now."
"We're not going to get (all the
recommendations] in the next six
months," she said, but "we're
going to find an way to do this
because it's so important."
He encouraged students who
have experienced sexual assault
and need help to call CAPS coun
selor Gail Nelligan at 723-3785.
