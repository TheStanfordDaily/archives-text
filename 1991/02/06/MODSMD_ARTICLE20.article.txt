Troops need support, even from those who oppose war

LET'S FACE THE FACTS: They're
there, they're risking their lives,
and they deserve our support.
Regardless of your political persuasion.
Whether or not you support the
actions in the Gulf, the bottom line is
clear: There is a war, and we're in it.
Americans are putting their lives on the
line, halfway around the world. I think
that they deserve our support. All of our
support, even if you are a peace activist.
In the world arena, every possible
avenue of peace has been traveled. The
United States, Egypt, Syria, Jordan,
France, Yemen, the United Nations and
even Libya have attempted to solve the
situation. All to no avail.
On the home front, President Bush
has consulted with policy-makers about
war more times than any other president
in our nation's history. The avenues of
peace have been exhausted.
I respect the cause of the so-called
peace activists. Nobody likes war; no
sane human being cares to see a friend
slaughtered in battle, and our motives
for being in Saudi Arabia are debatable.

But now, we are in Saudi Arabia, and we
are at war.
For over 680,000 U.S. and foreign
troops, seeing a friend wounded or killed
is a frightening possibility. It is for this
reason that I think they need our moral
support. Public opinion has to be there
for the troops who need to rely on it.
Recently, I was disturbed to see many
anti-war demonstrators yelling and
chanting, not because I am against their
right of expression, but because not one
word of respect was given to the young
men and women who are risking their
lives halfway around the world.
"GET OUT OF THE GULF" is a good
message to politicians, but how do you
think these sentiments would affect a
serviceman as he gets ready for battle?
Whether the soldiers are there for a
good cause or for a bad cause, whether
they're there for the American ideal or
for crude oil, the fact remains that
they're there, fighting a war. They need
support, not as soldiers supporting a vir
tuous or flawed policy, but as Americans
performing their duties patriotically,
regardless of their personal feelings con

cerning the conflict.
They are bound by a legal and moral
obligation to serve their country when
they are needed. They are presently ful
filling that obligation.
By joining the armed forces, they
trusted the government to weigh the
pros and cons between aggression and
nonaggression, and between sending and
not sending them. The government has
made these decisions. As our soldiers
fight in the Persian Gulf, they are honor
ing that trust by fulfilling their responsi
bility.
Denounce the policy, not the foot-sol
dier. Unfortunately, criticism of the for
mer often carries onto the latter.
Let me give you an example of where
criticism by peace activists makes a dif
ference. If you were in Saudi Arabia with
the knowledge that the protesters back
home in San Francisco protested to the
point that they shut down the Golden
Gate Bridge for a while, shut down the
Bay Bridge for a while, brawled in the
streets, and burned American flags, all
because they didn't support your pres
ence in the Gulf, how would these nega

tive reports play on your emotions?
How would this disheartening news
affect your performance? Or your
morale? (Incidentally, all of these occur
rences transpired in the City on the first
night of war.)
My message is simple: When activists
make such strong statements aimed at
politicians, they inevitably make a
demoralizing statement to the young
men and women who responded when
our country called them to serve and
who are risking their lives right now.
How fair Eire protesters being to them,
the real losers of war? You see, they're
not policy-makers, and they're not
killing machines. They are ordinary
Americans, carrying out a mission
assigned to them.
Send a message to politicians, but
don't send the same one to the soldiers.
All it can do is hurt them. At this point
in time, they need to see us behind them,
not against them. They have enough ene
mies already.

Pregnancy network director denounces 'anti-choice 9 label

AS THE DIRECTOR OF THE Stan
ford Crisis Pregnancy Network
(SCPN), I would like to address
the comments made by Patricia Atkinson
West in the Jan. 30 Daily.
While I feel that her portrayal of
SCPN does not accurately reflect the
philosophy or the motivations of our
group, Ms. West is correct in stating that
SCPN does not make referrals for abor
tions. I admit that this does represent a
bias in our approach. I do not believe,
however, that it prevents us from being
"supportive" and "judgmental." It is a
policy that, as a group and individually,

we struggle with and, at times, question.
I agree with Ms. West that we must be
sensitive to the effect it may have on our
objective of helping women.
I am especially troubled by Ms. West's
labeling of SCPN as an "anti-choice"
organization. Our goal is to enable a
woman to choose, from the variety of
options, the one which is right for her.
We provide our clients with a free preg
nancy test, and if the woman wishes, our
peer counselors are available after the
results are known to provide emotional
support and to discuss any concerns and
answer any questions she may have. We

use a form of supportive peer counseling
known as "reflective listening."
One aspect of this is that we do not
bring up any topic that the client does
not first mention. We recognize that
groups which practice the manipulative
and emotionally damaging tactics Ms.
West alluded to do exist. We are not in
any way associated with such organiza
tions, nor do we use these tactics our
selves.
Abortion is seen by SCPN to be a
legitimate option and to the best of our
ability we will answer clients' questions
concerning this option factually. Our

counselors view the choice of abortion, or
any other option, as a decision that
should be made by each woman.
It was not our intention to deceive
anyone by omitting our abortion referral
policy from our advertisement. When we
composed the ad, we wrestled with
whether to mention it and made the
decision not to mention the policy out of
concern that it would be misunderstood.
We apologize to anyone who may feel she
has been misled.
