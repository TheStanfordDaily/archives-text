## The
						chasm beyond charity 
### 
BY THE TIME I GOT TO THE Sam-
Trans stop in front of the Stanford
Shopping Center, on my way back
from Boston after winter break, I wanted
pity.
I'd been traveling for 17 hours, having
been bumped from a flight in Newark,
then nearly stranded in Los Angeles. It
was now 2:15 a.m., and I was tired. The
dorms weren't open yet, and my only
hope of spending the night indoors lay in
the chance that one of my friends in Man
zanita Park had returned to campus early.
I was also cold, as my jacket, supposedly
designed for winter in New England,
offered little resistance against the wind
coming off the Bay.
I called a cab, then waited, shivering,
talking to a graduate student who had
been on the bus with me. We traded travel
horror stories (he had flown in from
Paris), complained about the cold and
bounced around to keep warm. And then,
suddenly, we heard a voice.
"Do you know when the next bus
comes?"
It was the voice of a child but came
from a woman's drooping face. She stood
no taller than four feet and had no visible
possessions except her clothing — thin,
dreary and inappropriate for the weather
— and a single crutch. She was clearly
homeless and we didn't have the heart to
tell her that the buses had stopped
running, that she was stranded, in the
cold and in the dark.
The graduate student and I stam
mered, looked at each other, looked at the
sidewalk. She asked what town she was
in. We stammered some more. "Palo Alto,

ma'am." We turned back around, to face
El Camino, to wait for the cab that would
take us away from a situation we could do
nothing to remedy except to pretend that
it wasn't happening.
The cab finally came, and we jumped
toward it. But the woman would not be
forgotten so easily. Without speaking, she
hobbled to the cab, pulled open the back
door, and got in, before either the gradu
ate student or I could react. We hesitated,
then put our bags in the trunk. He got in
front, and I got in back, bravely, I
thought. I shut the door gingerly, as if the
woman might shatter, leaving me with a
pile of pieces to clean up and dispose of.
The cab driver asked where we were
going. Manzanita, I said. The woman's
destination was less specific. "I'm looking
for a home. A place to stay where I can be
alone."
We didn't know what to say to that.
The driver needed a place that would
register on his meter. He asked again, and
the woman did her best to comply. "Can
you take me to Portland as quickly as pos
sible?"
I winced. I imagined a brother in Port
land, a friend, maybe her old school. I
would take her there myself if I could,
wrap her in my arms and make her whole
again. But my dreams were idle. Portland
was as distant as Paris, as distant as this
woman I did not know, and could proba
bly never know.
We dropped her at the Stanford Hospi-*
tal; all we could do was make her warm
for the night, and hope that she would do
as well tomorrow. As we drove away, the
graduate student turned to me, and

voiced our helplessness. "You, I would let
stay in my apartment. But she's different.
Ycu don't know what she might do. You
never know."
That's what I felt, and it confused me.
The lesson of the incident should have
been clear. The woman should have
shown me How Fortunate I Really Am,
made me ashamed of my complaining,
made the cold more tolerable. But all it
did was show me how different we really
are.
The woman was a human being, with
hopes and loves and fears, and that
should have been enough for me to hold
her, to help her, to tell her everything
would be all right. But she would have
been as uncomfortable with the gesture
as I would have. The social gap between
us was too broad, too deep. We met each
other as humans and aliens might, the
moment at which we touched a tentative
probe, not an understanding.
We drop quarters in canisters, we vol
unteer time for the homeless, but few of
us ever really vault the chasm. Something
more profound, more essential than ser
vice or charity has to come into being
before I can set aside the complaints of
my daily life and fully appreciate those of
the unfortunate and downtrodden. Our
concepts of society and humanity have to
change, and all we have for that is hope,
and time.
