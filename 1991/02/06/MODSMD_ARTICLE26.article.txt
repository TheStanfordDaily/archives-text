## Seminar discusses radiation effects 
### Julie Makinen Staff writer 
The possibility that combatant
nations might employ chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons in
the Persian Gulf conflict has
stirred public anxiety about the
consequences of using war's most
destructive tools. The medical
effects of radiation on humans
was a topic of last weekend's sym
posium, "Modern Warfare —
Nuclear, Chemical and Biological:
Medical and Societal Effects."
"Radiation produces its effects
through the ionization of atoms,
causing cell damage by altering or
destroying essential cell con
stituents. The abnormal or non
functional molecules that result
may impair or kill the cell," said
Dr. Herbert Abrams, professor of
radiology at Stanford Medical
School.
Damage to the cell may be pro
duced by the direct action of ions
on essential molecules or by the
action of highly reactive molecules
called free radicals. Free radicals
disrupt bonds in cellular
molecules, possibly creating sub
stances toxic to the cell.
"Minute damage may be
reparable, but damage to mol
ecules like DNA is critical and vir
tually irreparable," explained
Abrams.
Certain cells are more sensitive
than others. For example, the cells
that line the intestinal tract are
more susceptible to damage than
are more highly differentiated
muscle, bone and nerve tissues.
Bone marrow, lymphoid tissue,
the spleen, the gastrointestinal
tract and the male reproductive
organs are also especially suscep
tible to the damaging effects of
radiation.
The body's reaction to radia
tion exposure is quite predictable,
and varies according to the dose of
radiation, Abrams said. Four
stages of radiation sickness are
recognized: the prodromal syn
drome, the latent period, a febrile
period and finally either death or
recovery.
The prodromal period is the
phase immediately following
exposure. It is characterized by
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and a

drop in lymphocyte counts. It is
possible that the central nervous
system, rather than actual cell
dysfunction, initiates these
responses.
A latent period usually sets in
24 to 36 hours following exposure.
Depending on the dosage of radia
tion, this period of relative well
being may last as little as a few
days or as long as a few weeks.
Following the latent period is
the febrile period, where bodily
response depends even more
directly on the degree of exposure.
Exposure to radiation is measured
in units called rads, for "radiation
absorbed dose."
For people exposed to high lev
els (500-1200 rads), death almost
inevitably occurs within a few
days — apparently due to brain
hemorrhaging or cardiovascular
collapse.
Victims who have been exposed
to moderate levels of radiation
suffer from severe damage to the
gastrointestinal system. The
destruction of the intestinal lining
is accompanied by exhaustion,
delirium and dehydration. Coma
and death typically occur one to
two weeks after exposure.
At lower levels of exposure, the
hematopoietic syndrome —
involving damage to the bone
marrow — occurs. When bone
marrow is damaged, it becomes
unable to produce new red blood
cells, leaving the victim highly
susceptible to infection. Although
bone marrow transplants may
save some victims in this category,
death generally occurs two to four
weeks after such exposure.
"Bone marrow transplants are
probably the most important
recent therapy development," said
Abrams. Dr. Robert Gale and his
colleagues performed 19 such
transplants on Chernobyl victims.
Because of complications such as
burns, only five out of the 19
patients survived. "The goal of
such transplants, like all other
radiation sickness treatments, is
to carry the patient through the
period when his marrow is unable
to furnish the necessary blood ele
ments," said Abrams.
Children are thought to expe
rience higher mortality than
adults when exposed to similar
levels of radiation. A study found
that 90 percent of pre-pubescent
mice die when exposed to a given
amount of radiation, compared to
only 20 percent of adult mice.
Treatment of radiation sick
ness is multifaceted: it is impor
tant for doctors to maintain fluid
levels, monitor white blood cell
levels and, most importantly, pre
vent infection by maintaining
sterile conditions.
Radiation victims also suffer
from malnutrition and decreased
T-lymphocyte counts. T-lympho
cytes are white blood cells active
in the body's defense against
infectious organisms.
"These factors usually act in
concert to produce an acquired
immunodeficiency condition that
is very similar to the action of the
AIDS virus.
"It is no coincidence that today,
Ukrainian doctors talk of 'Cher
nobyl AIDS' among their patients
[victims of the 1986 Chernobyl
nuclear power plant meltdown],
because these patients are suscep
tible, like AIDS patients, to a host
of exotic infections," said Abrams.
Dr. Abrams points out that the
Chernobyl accident was only Km of
the magnitude of the Hiroshima
bombing. The threat the United
States faces in the form of one
conventional nuclear weapon is
125 million times greater than the
magnitude of Chernobyl.
"The catastrophe of Chernobyl
should serve as a warning about
more than just nuclear power,"
concluded Abrams.
