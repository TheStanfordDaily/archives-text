# SEAL BEACH at Año Nuevo
## 
### Michael Drout 
□ Every winter, a growing
population of northern ele
phant seals returns to Ano
Nuevo State Reserve to bear
young, to mate and to be
observed by human beings.

They look like duffel bags. Long, tawny
duffel bags filled with jello.
The elephant seals have returned to Ano

Nuevo. Flipping sand
onto their backs,
holding their flippers
aloft, jostling each
other and bellowing
into the cool winter
air, they resemble a
large, unruly family
on a trip to the
beach.
Elephant seals —
enormous, blubbery
beasts that can reach
lengths of 18 feet and
weigh more than two
and-a-half tons —
usually cluster in
herds of up to 300.
And the population
has been rising
steadily since the
turn of the centuiy.

Human beings nearly exterminated the
seals in the 1800s, but by 1911 the animals
began to reappear in their former breeding
sites. Humans no longer pose a threat to the
seals; the Marine Mam mad Protection Act has
safeguarded the species since 1972.
Today, humans seek out elephant seals to
study the animals' physiological adaptations,
to marvel at their size and strength, or to
observe their complex social interactions and
mating behavior.
The seals first appear on shore in late
November. Their flippers are too weak to sup
port the weight of their bodies on land, and
the}' lump across the sand like giant slugs,
their blubber quivering.
The females, which comprise the bulk of
the herd, search for the best location to raise
their pups. When they find an appropriate
site, they lie down to wait, looking like huge
sunbathers.
As the females look for birthing sites, the
males begin battling for dominance of the
herd.
"Elephant seals have a strict dominance
hierarchy based on size and strength,"
explains Leßoeuf. "The males spend most of
their time protecting a large group of females
from other males."
Calling loudly at each other through their
snouts, the males posture belligerently, press

ing their chests together. Then they slash at
each other with their canine teeth, tearing
the skin of their opponent's chest shield.
While the males are fighting for the right
to mate> the females are delivering the pups
they conceived the previous year. Each preg
nant female gives birth to one pup, and
nurses it for four weeks.
Although the birth of the new pups can be
a trying, hazardous time for the herd,
humans rarely interfere with the seals at Ano
Nuevo.
"This is a state reserve, and we let nature
take its course," says Leander Tamoria, a
park ranger at Ano Nuevo. "We only inter
vene to fix something man has done. Eor
example, when animals become entangled in

nets or in plastic,
we'll cut them free."
According to Tamo
ria, this is a rather
uncommon occur
rence. "It happens
less than once a
week," he says.
After they wean
their pups, the
female seals come
into estrus — or
"heat" — for four
days. It is during
this time that they
mate.
Once the seal has
mated, says Rankin,
"she has to run a
gauntlet of less dom
inant males who are
waiting for her on

her way to the sea."
"Nature's way of making sure that she's
pregnant," says Echvarry.
About 300 days after leaving, she
comes back to the breeding grounds to
give birth, mate and begin the entire cycle
over again.
Elephant seals can live up to 15 years,
though half the females and 80 to 90 per
cent of the males do not live to see their
eighth birthday.
Those that do live return to the rookery
the next year, to the delight of hundreds of
Californians who make an annual pilgrim
age to see these enormous, charmingly ugly
beasts.
"There's nothing like it," exclaims
one visitor, busily snapping pho
tographs of two juvenile males engaged
in a mock dominance battle. "They're so
impressive. And there are so many of
them."
In the years to come there will be
even more, as the population continues
to increase and the new colonies at Big
Sur and Point Reyes begin to grow to
the size of the colony at Ano Nuevo.
"There'll never be enough of them for
me," says Echvarry, peering through his
binoculars at one large bull sleeping in a
pile of kelp. "I love these animals."
