# Bread gets its 'rise' from two unique wheat proteins

Q # Why is flour made only from wheat,
• and why is it necessary to knead
aough?
A. I guess you haven't had a ham on rye
• or a piece of cornbread lately. Actually,
of the 8,000 different species of grains in
the world, wheat (Triticum aestivum and
T. durum) is one of the few that are able to
produce raised breads. Barley and rye have
been used since ancient times to produce
rather heavy breads, and rice flours are
commonly used for types of pasta.
Wheat contains 10 percent to 15 percent
protein, and much of this forms an insolu
ble, gummy material called gluten. It is the

gluten that needs kneading, and it gives
wheat dough the elasticity to form gas
pockets and the strength to tolerate this
rising. Other grains have too little gluten to
make fluffy breads.
Gluten is made of two proteins, gliadin
and glutenin. When water is first mixed
with the flour, the gluten proteins form a
tangled mass of coiled molecules, like a
room full of Slinkys. Upon kneading, the
dough becomes elastic as the gluten Slinkys
are partially stretched out. The dough
gains strength as the protein molecules are
lined up parallel and cross-linked to each
other with disulfide bonds.
The dough now has the necessary

strength and elasticity to hold the carbon
dioxide bubbles made by the fermenting
yeast. Turn on your $395 yuppie bread
maker from Williams-Sonoma and presto: a
$1.59 loaf of bread.

If overkneaded (this is almost impossible
to accomplish by hand, but easy with a
Cuisinart™ or Kitchen-Aid™), the gluten
molecules get stretched out completely and
are unable to remain chemically attached to
their neighbors. The result: Like Stallone
without his steroids, the dough loses its
strength and it just sits there, worthless
and weak.
Although the gluten proteins are impor
tant to us for their bread-making abilities,
the wheat plant is not too thrilled about
having its children ground up, mixed with a
