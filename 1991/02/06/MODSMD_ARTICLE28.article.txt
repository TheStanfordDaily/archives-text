Q # Why is flour made only from wheat,

A. I guess you haven't had a ham on rye
• or a piece of cornbread lately. Actually,
of the 8,000 different species of grains in
the world, wheat (Triticum aestivum and
T. durum) is one of the few that are able to
produce raised breads. Barley and rye have
been used since ancient times to produce
rather heavy breads, and rice flours are
commonly used for types of pasta.
Wheat contains 10 percent to 15 percent
protein, and much of this forms an insolu
ble, gummy material called gluten. It is the

gluten that needs kneading, and it gives
wheat dough the elasticity to form gas
pockets and the strength to tolerate this
rising. Other grains have too little gluten to
make fluffy breads.
Gluten is made of two proteins, gliadin
and glutenin. When water is first mixed
with the flour, the gluten proteins form a
tangled mass of coiled molecules, like a
room full of Slinkys. Upon kneading, the
dough becomes elastic as the gluten Slinkys
are partially stretched out. The dough
gains strength as the protein molecules are
lined up parallel and cross-linked to each
other with disulfide bonds.
The dough now has the necessary

strength and elasticity to hold the carbon
dioxide bubbles made by the fermenting
yeast. Turn on your $395 yuppie bread
maker from Williams-Sonoma and presto: a
$1.59 loaf of bread.

If overkneaded (this is almost impossible
to accomplish by hand, but easy with a
Cuisinart™ or Kitchen-Aid™), the gluten
molecules get stretched out completely and
are unable to remain chemically attached to
their neighbors. The result: Like Stallone
without his steroids, the dough loses its
strength and it just sits there, worthless
and weak.
Although the gluten proteins are impor
tant to us for their bread-making abilities,
the wheat plant is not too thrilled about
having its children ground up, mixed with a

other seed proteins have evolved
to feed the growing seedling until
it can get its own energy from the
sun.

Q,How do planes fly ?
A .This simple answer is: Go

nately, despite what people say,
we here at the Science Bug are not
simple.
After two fist fights and a ses
sion with a counselor who special
izes in conflict resolution, we

decided that the most important
thing keeping an airplane in the
air is the shape of the wing — and,
of course, the fact that the plane is
moving forward through the air.
Now for the important part. A
wing produces lift by creating a
low air pressure region above
itself as it moves through the air.
Wings are designed so that the
path length of air moving across

the top of the wing is longer than
the path length of air moving
under the wing.
As the wing moves forward, air
must move faster across the long
top of the wing to meet up with
the slow air that traveled across
the short bottom of the wing, so
that both kinds of air end up in
the same place at the same time at
the back of the wing.

From Bernoulli's principle and
the equation of continuity, it is
intuitively obvious that the fast
air above the wing results in a
region of low air pressure. Thus it
is the low air pressure above the
wing, relative to the high air pres
sure below the wing, that pro
duces the lift that allows an air
plane to fly.
