# Local naturalist teaches long-term concern
## 
### Nancy Volkers Staff writer 
Jerry Lawrence's neighbors include a
great horned owl and a pair of raccoons.
But perhaps that's to be expected;
Lawrence, the superintendent of open
space and science in Palo Alto, and a city
employee for over 20 years, has both feet
planted firmly in Palo Alto's environmen
tal soil.
As superintendent, Lawrence oversees
4,000 acres of open space, including
Foothills Park, Arastradero Preserve and
the Baylands Preserve. He is also respon
sible for the Palo Alto Junior Museum and
the interpretive centers in the Baylands
Preserve and Foothills Park.
Lawrence's responsibilities include
maintenance, enforcement of rules and
regulations, land management, interpre
tive programming and special projects.
Beginning his career in 1966 as a
ranger and naturalist, Lawrence began
supervising various parks and open spaces
in 1969, and remained in that position
until his promotion to superintendent two
years ago.
Staying in one area for so long has
given Lawrence a grasp of changes in local
opinion on environmental issues.
"There were plans in the '50s to dike
off all sections of the Bay and just fill
them, or not allow circulation. They could
then build on it. It'd be worth millions of
dollars."
In the late '60s and early '70s,

Lawrence noticed a "real awakening of
the ecology movement .. . and there was
pressure put on the state legislature [to
preserve the Bay Area marsh]." Today,
Lawrence says, he sees a resurgence of
national ecological concern.
However, the renewed concern is insuf
ficient to solve the environmental prob
lems humanity has created, Lawrence
worries.
"I think people realize we've got a prob
lem, so maybe 100 years from now we'll be
better off than we are now. But I think
we're in for a series of disasters before we
actually start to turn this thing around.
We're still on the way down as far as the
environment's concerned, and it's going
to be a while before we start on the way
back up."
From a more regional viewpoint, "Palo
Alto has a reputation for being kind of on
the cutting edge, if you can use that term
anymore, in issues that particularly have
to do with the environment," Lawrence
says. The city has been establishing open
space areas for 70 years, and was one of
the first communities in the nation to
employ rangers to protect these spaces
and to enforce the rules and regulations.
Lawrence and his employees are trying
to instill environmental concern in the
children of Palo Alto and the surrounding
communities, in hopes that they will carry
on the area's tradition of ecological pio
neering.

programs for children throughout the
year. Its facilities include an inflatable
planetarium and a tiny zoo, where chil
dren can see and learn about area wildlife,
such as the great horned owl and the rac
coons.
Museum employees and volunteers
also participate in an outreach program,
teaching science classes in three area
schools.
The interpretive centers offer pro
grams each weekend to both children and
adults. The department has also estab
lished a junior ranger program in East
Palo Alto, where Palo Alto owns 200 acres
of marshland.
"We're trying to get instilled in the kids
the value of that marshland so we won't
have the kinds of problems we've had in
the past, in terms of inappropriate use of
the area — hunting, trash, dumping, off
road vehicles," Lawrence explains.
Palo Alto's marshlands are a precious
commodity: 90 percent of the salt marshes

in California have been destroyed.
Two endangered species live in the
Bay lands salt marsh: the salt marsh har
vest mouse and the light-footed clapper
rail (a crane-like bird). In a count con
ducted last month, state authorities dis
covered that the population of clapper
rails has dropped severely, possibly due to
predation by the red fox, a non-native
species. Lawrence isn't sure what can be
done to prevent this predation without
upsetting the balance of the marsh.
Now, Lawrence must look ahead to the
spring, when the department will propose
to "build" both a saltwater and a freshwa
ter marsh on old ITT property, hoping to
increase biodiversity and provide more
niches for wildlife.
He must also look ahead to summer,
when the drought will manifest its most
severe effects. Lawrence's department
has already cut water use by 25 percent,
and may cut back an additional 15 to 25
percent, depending on the amount of rain
fall. The lake in Foothills Park will not be
filled, and Lawrence must deal with the
loss of diversity there as bass, catfish and
red-eared sunfish begin dying. Grass and
trees are also dying, and Lawrence's open
spaces are turning brown.
So while the great horned owl and the
furry raccoons can slumber peacefully in
the zoo's early morning sunshine, their
neighbor Jerry Lawrence must take the
weight of 4,000 acres on his shoulders and
continue his 25-year commitment to help
ing Palo Alto understand the Earth.

space and science in Palo Alto, and a city
employee for over 20 years, has both feet
planted firmly in Palo Alto's environmen
tal soil.
As superintendent, Lawrence oversees
4,000 acres of open space, including
Foothills Park, Arastradero Preserve and
the Baylands Preserve. He is also respon
sible for the Palo Alto Junior Museum and
the interpretive centers in the Baylands
Preserve and Foothills Park.
Lawrence's responsibilities include
maintenance, enforcement of rules and
regulations, land management, interpre
tive programming and special projects.
Beginning his career in 1966 as a
ranger and naturalist, Lawrence began
supervising various parks and open spaces
in 1969, and remained in that position
until his promotion to superintendent two
years ago.
Staying in one area for so long has
given Lawrence a grasp of changes in local
opinion on environmental issues.
"There were plans in the '50s to dike
off all sections of the Bay and just fill
them, or not allow circulation. They could
then build on it. It'd be worth millions of
dollars."
In the late '60s and early '70s,

Lawrence noticed a "real awakening of
the ecology movement .. . and there was
pressure put on the state legislature [to
preserve the Bay Area marsh]." Today,
Lawrence says, he sees a resurgence of
national ecological concern.
However, the renewed concern is insuf
ficient to solve the environmental prob
lems humanity has created, Lawrence
worries.
"I think people realize we've got a prob
lem, so maybe 100 years from now we'll be
better off than we are now. But I think
we're in for a series of disasters before we
actually start to turn this thing around.
We're still on the way down as far as the
environment's concerned, and it's going
to be a while before we start on the way
back up."
From a more regional viewpoint, "Palo
Alto has a reputation for being kind of on
the cutting edge, if you can use that term
anymore, in issues that particularly have
to do with the environment," Lawrence
says. The city has been establishing open
space areas for 70 years, and was one of
the first communities in the nation to
employ rangers to protect these spaces
and to enforce the rules and regulations.
Lawrence and his employees are trying
to instill environmental concern in the
children of Palo Alto and the surrounding
communities, in hopes that they will carry
on the area's tradition of ecological pio
neering.
The Palo Alto Junior Museum presents

we start on the way back
up.'

programs for children throughout the
year. Its facilities include an inflatable
planetarium and a tiny zoo, where chil
dren can see and learn about area wildlife,
such as the great horned owl and the rac
coons.
Museum employees and volunteers
also participate in an outreach program,
teaching science classes in three area
schools.
The interpretive centers offer pro
grams each weekend to both children and
adults. The department has also estab
lished a junior ranger program in East
Palo Alto, where Palo Alto owns 200 acres
of marshland.
"We're trying to get instilled in the kids
the value of that marshland so we won't
have the kinds of problems we've had in
the past, in terms of inappropriate use of
the area — hunting, trash, dumping, off
road vehicles," Lawrence explains.
Palo Alto's marshlands are a precious
commodity: 90 percent of the salt marshes

in California have been destroyed.
Two endangered species live in the
Bay lands salt marsh: the salt marsh har
vest mouse and the light-footed clapper
rail (a crane-like bird). In a count con
ducted last month, state authorities dis
covered that the population of clapper
rails has dropped severely, possibly due to
predation by the red fox, a non-native
species. Lawrence isn't sure what can be
done to prevent this predation without
upsetting the balance of the marsh.
Now, Lawrence must look ahead to the
spring, when the department will propose
to "build" both a saltwater and a freshwa
ter marsh on old ITT property, hoping to
increase biodiversity and provide more
niches for wildlife.
He must also look ahead to summer,
when the drought will manifest its most
severe effects. Lawrence's department
has already cut water use by 25 percent,
and may cut back an additional 15 to 25
percent, depending on the amount of rain
fall. The lake in Foothills Park will not be
filled, and Lawrence must deal with the
loss of diversity there as bass, catfish and
red-eared sunfish begin dying. Grass and
trees are also dying, and Lawrence's open
spaces are turning brown.
So while the great horned owl and the
furry raccoons can slumber peacefully in
the zoo's early morning sunshine, their
neighbor Jerry Lawrence must take the
weight of 4,000 acres on his shoulders and
continue his 25-year commitment to help
ing Palo Alto understand the Earth.
