# SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE TASK FORCE ON SEXUAL ASSAULT
## 
### 
Develop and adopt a formal written policy stating that
Stanford will not tolerate unacceptable sexual conduct.
Create and fund a highly visible Coordinator of Sexual
Assault Response Services.
Identify and train key personnel who are likely to receive
initial reports of sexual assault or interact with
victims/survivors.
Where sexual assault or acquaintance rape is alleged, but
cannot be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, the Judicial
Affairs Officer should examine the facts to determine whether
sufficient undisputed evidence exists to charge the student with
other unacceptable sexual conduct.
Convene the Committee of 15 to consider:
• amending the Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968 to:
• include a list of rights of victims/survivors of sexual assault,
• require the cooperation of student witnesses during the investi
gation and any subsequent disciplinary proceeding, and
• require the cooperation of the accused student during the
investigation stage;
• examining the appropriateness of retaining the "beyond a
reasonable doubt" standard of proof, UNLESS measures are taken
to address the limitations of the current system with respect to ALL
student disciplinary cases.
Appoint a standing committee of faculty, staff and students to
review the University's response to cases involving allegations
of unacceptable sexual conduct and the effectiveness of
measures taken in response to this report.
