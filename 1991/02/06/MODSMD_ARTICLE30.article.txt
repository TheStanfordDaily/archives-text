## McCarty's homer propels Cardinal past Pacific Undefeated batsmen win seventh straight 
### Michelle Ghert Staff writer 
The Stanford baseball team
hadn't started its season with a 7-
0 run since 1981... until yester
day.
Recovering from a 4-0 deficit in
the middle of the second inning,
the Cardinal came back to defeat
the University of the Pacific 6-5,
extending its early-season win
ning streak to 7 games.
"There was no worry about us
coming back," relief pitcher Aaron
Dorlarque said. "It was just a mat
ter of when."
'When' turned out to be the
bottom of the second inning in
which the Cardinal scored four
runs to tie the game. Left fielder
Ryan Turner walked, took second
on a wild pitch by Pacific pitcher
Matt Senske and scored on third
baseman David Holbrook's single.
Holbrook then scored from first
on catcher Mark Skeels' double to
right field. Designated hitter John
Lynch reached first and Skeels
took third on third baseman Steve
Coppedge's error. Matt Boke
meier, second baseman for the
Cardinal, then hit into a double
play as Skeels scored, cutting the
Tiger lead to 4-3. Right fielder
Steve Solomon followed with a
double to right and later scored to
tie the game on shortstop Roger
Burnett's RBI single.
"We came back in that one
inning and that really helped us
get back in the game," Cardinal

head coach Mark Marquess said.
"I was really pleased with our hit
ting production today. We got 11
hits and hit a couple of balls to the
walls."
Leading the Cardinal offense
was first baseman David McCarty,
who was 4-for-5 with one run and
two RBl's. Solomon was 3-for-5
with two runs scored.
"I felt pretty comfortable after
my first at-bat," Solomon said. "I
knew I would have a successful
day. It just worked out that way."
McCarty is now 10-for-16
(.625) in his last four games and
has hit safely in all seven games
this season.
"I struggled in the first couple
games, I wasn't swinging the bat
well," McCarty said. "Just this
weekend I felt like I was swinging
the bat the way I should. I started
to hit the ball a little harder and
drive a few out of the park."
Yesterday, McCarty did drive
one out of the park. With one out
in the sixth inning, McCarty
belted a home run off Pacific relief
pitcher Chris Reinheimert.
Solomon, who was on second after
his single and a sacrifice bunt by
second baseman Chris Kempe,
scored along with McCarty to give
Stanford a 6-4 lead.

"I wasn't looking for a home
run," McCarty said. "I knew all I
needed was a hit to get Solomon
in, Steve's one of our faster play
ers. I just got a changeup out of
the plate and went with it."
McCarty now has 20 career home
runs in just over two years on the
Farm. Three more homers will
break him into Stanford's all-time
top-10.
"McCarty's a good hitter,"
Marquess said. "He's tough out
there and he'll hurt you. He's
gonna hit with power."
Marquess continued the early
season pitching rotation, starting
Tim Moore and putting in relief
pitchers Dorlarque and Scott
Weiss. The pitching rotation will
not be cemented for at least two
weeks, during which Marquess
plans to give each pitcher some
experience on the mound.
"We've got some good, young
arms," Marquess said. "They just
need to get some pitching in."
Moore ran into trouble, pitch
ing only one and one-third innings
and allowing three earned runs.
"They (the Tigers) really
jumped on his fastball," Marquess
said. "The key was to get ahead of
the pitcher and Moore was pitch
ing behind."
Dorlarque came on to pitch
four and two-third innings while
allowing only three hits and no
earned runs in gaining the victory.
