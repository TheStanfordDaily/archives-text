### Steve Apfelberg Staff writer 
Yesterday's downpours left
the Stanford men's tennis team
hungry for action. Unfortu
nately for the San Jose State
Spartans, they were the oppo
nents on which the Cardinal
netters feasted, 9-0.
Freshman Michael Flanagan
was the first Cardinal off the
court. He raced to a 6-0, 6-0
double-bagel win at No. 6 sin
gles, and later teamed with fel
low freshman Chris Cocotos for
a 2-6, 6-2, 6-2 win at No. 1 dou
bles.
"I played a lot better today. I

kept my concentration better,"
Flanagan commented. "Also, I
felt much more comfortable
than I did in my first home
match.
"Our doubles match was a
great one," he continued. "We
are usually so up and down. We
both started slowly but kept our
composure and concentration.
It was a big win."
At No. 1 singles, junior Alex
O'Brien had yet another rou

tine win, defeating Rich Beiger
7-5, 6-1. "I started coming in to
the net more and pressuring
him in the second set," O'Brien
explained. "I feel my volley has
improved and am going to con
tinue to come to the net more
often."
Freshman Vimal Patel and
oeniors Glenn Solomon and
Jason Yee all won in straight
sets in their respective No. 3,
No. 4, and No. 5 singles
matches. Solomon won 6-4, 6-4
in a long match that once again
showed his ability to wear down
his opponents. Yee won 6-3, 6-0
and Patel triumphed 6-0, 6-4.

'Our doubles
match was a great
one. We kept our
composure and
concentration. It
was a big win.'
—Michael Flanagan

"Jason played a great second
set," Stanford coach Dick Gould
said after the singles matches.
"Vimal played the best first set
that I have seen him play."
The only singles match that
went into a third set was the
No. 2 singles match. Sopho
more Jared Palmer came back
from a slow start to win 3-6, 6-
1, 6-1. "My mind was else
where," Palmer commented. "I
started off slowly. It takes me a
while to get focused. Once I am
focused I am okay. The tables
turned in the second set. I
started making him play more
balls."
Freshmen Robert Devens
and Billy Wright teamed up for
a 7-6 (7-1), 6-1 victory at No. 2
doubles, and sophomores Ken
Pedrosa and Roman Sydorak
completed the shutout with a 6-
4, 6-1 win at No. 3 doubles.
"One of their top players was
out with the flu and another
was declared ineligible," Gould
said. "It hurt them. Our four
through six singles matches
started very well. It was a solid
performance.
"From a coach's standpoint,
it was good because everyone
got to play in the match. No. 1
doubles played well, as did No. 3
doubles, which is a very good
team. No. 2 doubles played well
in their victory even though it
was their first match."
The Cardinal's next home
match is the Nor Cal Intercolle
giate Tournament on February
16-19. Stanford will enter six
singles players and three dou
bles teams in the individual
tournament.
