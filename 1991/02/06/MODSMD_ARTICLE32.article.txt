# Give Rose his shot at the Hall
## 
### 
The ballot has been cast. And baseball is the
worse for it. Tuesday's unanimous vote by the
Hall of Fame board of directors to prohibit
ineligible players from even consideration to the Hall
injures "America's game." The nation's 1990's
morals are being superimposed on a century-old tra
dition.
The only player on the ineligible-for-life list is
Pete Rose, and his name is written all over the
archaic board's ruling.
Pete Rose is no saint. Far from it, actually. He
broke federal law in addition to mtyor league base
ball law. He didn't pay his taxes and bet on numer
ous sports — most likely including baseball— an act
forbidden by the league. He was a terrible father to
his first two children and wasn't a good husband to
his first wife. But are these the criteria upon which
he should be considered for election into the Hall?
He was one of the greatest to ever play the game.
Famous for breaking Ty Cobb's record of most hits
(he eventually ended up with 4256), he holds almost
twenty other records as well, including most singles
(3215), most seasons with 200-plus hits (10), most
seasons with 100-plus hits (23), most at-bats and
most games played during his 24-year career. These
are the accomplishments for which Rose should be
judged, not his off-the-field entanglements.
There's no question that his baseball achieve
ments are deserving of induction, but should his
lifestyle negate this worthiness?
If the Baseball Writers of America resolve that
because of his extra-legal affairs Rose should be held
out of the Hall, let that be their decision. It should be
up to the Hall of Fame voters, not a 12-man panel
consisting of retired millionaires, to cast this judge
ment.
If the writers don't want to elect him, fine. But
now the board is saying they can't even vote on him.
The BBWAA has always gotten to decide who's wor
thy of Cooperstown. The directors have gone too far.
And where do morals enter the picture in the first
place? When you step on the field? When you step off
of it? When you're elegible for the Hall of Fame?
Baseball, like life, is definitely not pristine. Play
ers are alcoholics and drugs addicts, players have
been drug dealers, players have been arrested for
sexual molestation. So where do we decide that one
"bad" act is worse than the rest and deny the perpe
trator the right to be honored for his athletic skills
and contributions?
And if we're going to drag morality into the game,
whose do we use? Current player's morals? Current
owners'/administrators' ethics? The virtues of the
founders of the game? A conglomeration of every
thing?
That's what it looks like we have now, for good or
for bad. Pete Rose is not the first talented baseball

player to commit sins, nor the first Hall of Fame-cal
iber player to break the law. But past illegalities
didn't prohibit the induction of the other wayward
greats.
Ty Cobb's place in Cooperstown has never been
debated. Yet he's considered to have been a
sociopath, a social menace, in addition to having bro
ken Baseball Law. Yet the Georgia Peach, despite
having bet on the infamous 1919 Black Sox World
Series, remains in baseball's shrine, his morality
never questioned. And Tris Speaker, one of the
greatest center fielders ever, was also a known gam
bler. His place in the Hall has never been doubted
either.
The board of governors is trying to make an
example out of ol* Pete Rose. They figure,
"Hey, this guy was great, gave lots to the game,
but he was bad. He did what we told him he couldn't
do. And he didn't pay his taxes. So let's make sure no
one else tries to get away with doing bad things by
showing them who's boss! If we say don't do it, don't
do it! Or what has befallen Pete Rose will happen to
you too! (heh-heh). No Hall of Fame. No glory."
But they shouldn't.
They are hurting the game in the process. Base
ball has a right to honor its heroes, and Rose was
more than a hero in the batter's box. Current players
should have the perogative to look up to him for his
game-day accomplishments, of which there are
many. And although you wouldn't want your kids to
emulate his off-season activities, children should
have the privilege of making him a baseball role
model, for he still is one of of the greats.
Tuesday's ruling took all of this away. He is to be
scorned, to be avoided, the trustees told baseball fans
everywhere by their actions.
It's too bad.
Especially since Rose has already suffered
enough. It's not as though he's off in the Caribbean
secretly er\joying illegally earned gambling winnings.
He and his family hav * been publicly humiliated. He
spent a year on the front pages of papers and on the
nightly news during his investigation and trial. He


Debbie
Spander
spent five months in jail. Now
he's in a halfway house in Cincin
nati, and still can't get on with his
life.
And yet, the board of directors
wants more. More blood. Keep
him from the one thing he still
truly deserves.
Pete Rose's bats, balls and uni
forms from Sept. 8, 1985 when he
tied Cobb's record, from Sept. 11,
1985 when he set the new all-time
hits record, and from various
other momentous games lie in
Cooperstown, marvelled at for the
accomplishments they represent.
Yet Rose is denied the same
honor.
Baseball is for the fans. They
should be the ones to decide.
