# Sailors lose close one to Weenies
## Last-second surge gives Cal the win in bad weather 
### Deborah Claymon Staff writer 
Stanford sailors fell short in
the last fifty yards of the last race
at North Series 2 on Sunday, los
ing the regatta by one point to
UC-Berkeley. The Cal skipper,
Thad Leib, passed two Stanford
boats through big waves on the
finish line to secure first place.
Top Stanford pairs of Dave
Dowd and Paula Gani, and
Jeremy Mclntyre and Matt Dun
bar struggled for consistency in
both divisions. Dowd and Mcln
tyre narrowly missed first place.
Following a mere one point behind
Dowd and Mclntyre, Stanford's
pairing of Matt Sanford and Kris
ten Sidell and Rick Rosen and
Rebecca Bryson battled at the
front of the fleet, but stopped
short of pulling ahead.

Hosted by UC-Santa Cruz, the
North Series regatta featured
eight teams, forming a fleet of
twenty boats from the Northern
California Intercollegiate Yacht
Racing Association. They com
peted in the second in a string of
nine regattas that run until late
April. The North Series ends just
before Pacific Coast Champi
onships, which will determine the
west coast entrants at Nationals.
Frustrating sailing conditions
greatly affected this first weekend
in the series. North Series 1 was
canceled on Saturday due to high
winds. Eight- to ten-foot swells
compounded the dangerous condi
tions. Sunday, high waves per
sisted but the air was extremely
still, with winds consistently
below five mph.
"The conditions demanded

intense concentration to keep up
any boatspeed," Sanford said.
"Often, you were sailing, holding
speed and a swell would come up
and push you back. Literally, the
sails would backwind."
Coach Blake Middleton com
mented on the narrow loss, indi
cating the team'B lack of consis
tency on the course. "There were
many smart races, but the sailors
lacked the focus necessary to over
take Cal." Middleton feels that
after great success on a national
level during winter break, Stan
ford has become preoccupied with
its national competitiveness.
The team looks forward to a
women's intersectional contest
this weekend and a co-ed intersec
tional on February 16-17. Both
races will be held in Charleston,
S.C.
