# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
The winter doldrums may get you down,
make you feel miserable, get you wishing you
were someplace else. Last weekend, though,
The Daily's Athletes of the Week were per
fectly happy right here at Stanford.
Both Dave Goss and Eileen Richetelli
turned in stellar performances to lead,
respectively, men's volleyball and women's
swimming to a pair of wins apiece.

Richetelli, a freshman from Milford,
Conn., won all four diving events as the Car
dinal women drubbed USC and UCLA at
deGuerre pool Friday and Saturday.
Against the Trojans, she scored a 264.0 in
the one-meter to best teammate Melissa
Kuller. In the three-meter event, Richetelli,
Kristin Jensen and Kuller finished one, two,
three for Stanford. The freshman led the
way with a 269.63. Stanford recorded a 193-
105 victory over USC.
A day later, things were almost exactly the
same. In the one-meter, Richetelli posted a
260.7 to nose out Kuller. Again Stanford
took the top three places in the three-meter.
This time Kuller came in ahead of Jensen,
however.
On the day, the Cardinal drubbed UCLA
216-82. The team has not lost a dual meet
under the direction of third-year coach
Richard Quick. Stanford faces Quick's old
team, top-ranked Texas, Friday night in
Austin.
If If If
Goss, a junior from Santa Barbara, Calif.,
peppered the hardwood at Burnham Pavilion
on consecutive nights as the Cardinal spiked
the Rainbows straight back to Hawaii —
twice.
Friday, Goss paced the Cardinal attack
with 20 kills as Stanford trounced Hawaii
15-6, 15-13, 15-9. Teammate Bob Hillman
chipped in 14 for good measure.
The victory gave the Cardinal a rare
opportunity for a weekend sweep of the
Rainbows and Goss did his part to make sure
the team capitalized.

The big man recorded a whopping 36 kills
and hit a sizzling .458 as Stanford won the
match in four, 15-7, 6-15, 16-14, 15-2. Hill
man again was the team's second most dead
ly attacker with 23 kills and a .588 hitting
percentage.
With the pair of wins, the Cardinal
pushed its season tally to 5-1, 4-0 in Western
Intercollegiate Volleyball Association play.
