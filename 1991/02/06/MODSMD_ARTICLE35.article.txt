# Bird may return to Celtics' lineup

BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP)
— Five days after being upset
by the Charlotte Hornets, the
Boston Celtics hoped to change
the outcome in tonight's
rematch.
That might not be the only
mqjor difference.
There was a chance that
Larry Bird, sidelined by back
problems for the past 14
games, would return to the
Celtics' lineup. He went full
speed in Tuesday's scrimmage
and hasn't have any mcgor set
backs since he returned to
practice a week earlier.
Boston coach Chris Ford
said Bird would decide himself
if he could play tonight.
"We went through a 24-
minute scrimmage (Tuesday)
and he played well," Ford said.
"He looked like he was moving
pretty freely out there. ... If
he were ready to play, he would
start."
The Celtics can use him.
His last game, a 127-110 vic
tory over Dallas on Jan. 6,
improved the Celtics' record to
26-5, best in the NBA. They are
7-7 since then.
"We've still got to realize
what got us to the point we
were at before Larry went
down is doing it as a team,"
center Robert Parish said.
"That's what we got away
from, the little things — the
defense, the rebounding, the
loose balls.
"Even if Larry was there, it
still would have happened."
Last Friday night, Boston

lost in Charlotte, 92-91. It was
only the Celtics' second loss in
28 games against the four most
recent expansion teams.
"It's a game that will be very
fresh on the players' minds,"
Ford said. "We lost a real tough
one... so (his players) should be
up for it."
"Now we can just go back
out and get our revenge,"
guard Reggie Lewis said.
Bird would help accomplish
that. His absence deprived the
Celtics of their best passer, best
defensive rebounder and their
player with the best court
sense and creativity.
But Lewis agreed with
Parish that the Celtics are good
enough to win more than half
their games without Bird.
"We played without him a
couple of times before," Lewis
said. "It's not anything that's
new to us. We just weren't con
sistent."
In 1988-89, Bird played only
six games before surgery on
both heels sidelined him the
res* of the season. He played 75
games last season. But the
Celtics were eliminated in the
first round of the playoffs both
times.
Bird, 34, lives with the accu
mulated aches of his 12 NBA
seasons. His back bothered him
from the beginning of training
camp. He even sat out a few
preseason games.
But he played in Boston's
first 31 games, averaging a
career low 19.2 points, before
finally sitting down.
