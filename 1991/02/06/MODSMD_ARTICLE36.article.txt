# Israeli student's thoughts on homeland
## 
### Dan Stearns Staff writer 
For some individuals, the Per
sian Gulf war rages far away in a
world of oil, sand and holy cities.
But although Eviatar Shafrir
lives in a realm of silicon, sand
stone and late-night studying,
his heart remains in the Middle
East.
"All the Israelis are terrified,"
says Shafrir, who came to the
United States from Israel in
1984. "All these macho comman
dos you see, all these macho
pilots are terrified, and they are
afraid of the Arabs, and they are
afraid Israel will be annihilated,
pushed to the sea, [by] Scud
attacks and chemical weapons."
Shafrir, now a coterminal stu
dent in engineering manage
ment at Stanford, is teaching a
SWOPSI course this quarter
titled the Arab/Israeli Conflict
through Literature and Film.
His parents live in Jerusalem
along with his brother and his
sister, who moved there from Tel
Aviv recently because of Scud
missile attacks by Iraq.
Before coming to the United
States, Shafrir graduated from
Hebrew University in

Jerusalem, where he majored in
computer science and mathe
matics. He also served in the
Israeli army.
Besides teaching and taking
classes, he also works part-time
at Hewlett Packard in computer
design.
His heart remains with his
family always, he says, but espe
cially during the crisis in the
Gulf.
But he says he has not seen a

strong sense of family in the
United States. "I know people
who live [at Stanford] and don't
even talk to their parents down
in San Jose," says Shafrir.
He also finds differences in
the physical environment here,
he says. "All of Jerusalem is built
from chiseled stone, like Stan
ford," he says. "Every year I visit
Israel, and when I walk in
Jerusalem I feel like I have to
touch the stones. The stones
talk to me. I walk around the
walls and graze them with my
fingers. Big boulders talk to me.
When I drive around the land
talks to me."
But "The stones at Stanford
and Yosemite are silent," he
says.
Shafrir's Stanford Workshops
on Political and Social Issues
course focuses on the situation
of Palestinians in the Israeli
occupied West Bank, and he says
the class can be very emotional
at times for him.
"A lot of this (Israeli/Pales
tinian) rivalry has to do with
similar goals," says Shafrir.
"Both groups have strong beliefs
in their country and land.
"There is a lot of hope for
solving the Palestinian issue,"

he adds. "I have my own solu
tions, but to state somebody
else's wonderful phrase: if my
solution were a company I
wouldn't buy its stock."
"I think the first step has to
be taken by Israel," he adds.
"They need to immediately start
serious negotiations with the
Palestinians and the [Palestine
Liberation Organization]."
The Palestinian issue is one of
many concerns Shafrir carries
with him daily. "I worry about
the U.S. troops, and hope they
are up to the task," he says.
Shafrir says he believes good
relations between Israel and the
United States are essential.
"I am absolutely against Sad
dam's (use of) force," Shafrir
says emphatically. "He threat
ened before he even went into
Kuwait to burn half of Israel
with chemical weapons."
Shafrir says former Israeli
Prime Minister Menachem
Begin was the political leader
who most influenced his life,
even though he disagrees with
many of Begin's views. "He was
able to withstand this long wait
until he finally had his views
heard after 30 years, and ... he
made peace."
