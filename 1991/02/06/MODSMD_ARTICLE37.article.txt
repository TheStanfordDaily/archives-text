# Directors gear up for Pro Fros next spring

Even before the Dec. 15 appli
cation deadline, Prospective
Freshman Week program direc
tors were already hard at work
planning a week of enticements
for participants this April.
As in the past, prospective
freshmen will be treated to dozens
of events, ranging from the requi
site campus and dorm tours to
admissions, financial aid and
majors seminars to sporting
events, a large-scale scavenger
hunt and two a cappella concerts.
Pro Fro Week will take place from
Monday, April 15 to Sunday, April
21.
Michelle Landrey, one of the
three program directors, said
some new concepts are being tried
this year, including a computer
program that matches prospective
freshmen with hosts from similar
places and with similar interests.
Program directors are also asking
resident fellows and resident
assistants for suggestions about
activities.
In addition, the Council of
Presidents is planning a Centen
nial Culture Fest celebrating
Stanford's diverse ethnic groups

to coincide with the visits by stu
dents who might make up Stan
ford's 100 th class.
Last year, between 700 and
1100 prospective freshmen
attended. About as many are
expected again this spring,
although the economic recession
might cut the numbers slightly,
directors said.
The guiding philosophy of the
week, Landrey said, is to "make
the campus open" to the students
so that they can learn what college
life is like directly from the stu
dents.
Still, not every facet of life will
be open to the visiting students.
Because of Stanford's new alcohol
policy, hosts are being asked to
keep their prospective freshmen
away from any "wet" parties.
Though they have spent much
time planning, Landrey said the
many student volunteers working
to coordinate this year's events
are "psyched" to welcome the
high-school students.
She said people interested in
becoming prospective freshman
hosts should contact either the
dorm coordinators in dorms
where freshmen live or the Admis
sions Office.
