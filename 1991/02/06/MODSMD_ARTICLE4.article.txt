# ASSU defeats bill limiting discussion to Stanford issues
## Donald Kennedy discusses indirect costs with Senate 
### Marie Bui Staff writer Eric Young Senior staff writer 
In his quarterly appearance at
the ASSU Senate last night, Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
entertained questions from sena
tors and kept them entertained
with his often-humorous replies.
But Kennedy's tone was seri
ous when he addressed questions
about the federal investigations of
Stanford's indirect cost policies
and how the "fallout" from the
probes will affect the University.
Graduate senator Larry
Augustin said he is concerned the
indirect cost controversy has
hampered funding for some
research proposals. He said the
image that Stanford is frivolously
billing the government for indi
rect costs wards away possible
grants.

After spending hours in sharp
debate over what they should
debate, the ASSU senate last
night defeated a bill that would
have limited the scope of its legis
lation to campus-related issues.
The bill's defeat serves as a sig
nal from the senate that it is free
to take stands on state, national
or international issues whether or
not they have an impact within
Campus Drive.
Senator David Brown, a vocal
opponent of the bill, said last
night's senate action "preserves
the presumption that the ASSU
will be active on all kinds of
issues."
The senate also voted to change
a number of the ASSU's general
election bylaws in anticipation of
this spring's races.
Last night's meeting — which
after four hours was moved into
the Law School courtyard to allow
a janitor to close the room the sen
ate normally uses — began after a
number of general comments by
University President Donald
Kennedy.
Kennedy fielded several ques-

tions from senators on issues
ranging from the current contro
versy over indirect cost recovery
to what services the University is
providing students in response to
the outbreak of war in the Persian
Gulf.
Bringing to a close nearly two
hours of verbal wrangling, the
senate voted 13-7 to kill the scope
legislation. Co-authored by gradu
ate senators John Overdeck and
Douglas Bone, the bill said the
senate and Council of Presidents
should remain quiet on "state,
national or international matters
not directly affecting Stanford
students."
The bill's proponents said it
was meant to stop the ASSU from

universities most likely charge the
government for the same kind of
expenses that have proven embar
rassing to the University during
the past few weeks, such as flower
arrangements at Hoover House.
Stanford is "no more frivolous"
than any comparable institution,
he said.
Some senators expressed con

cern about the appropriateness of
the University's policy for stu
dents who are affected by the war
in the Middle East. Many people
have not been keeping up with
their academic studies in order to
organize teach-ins or protests, one
senator said.
But Kennedy said he does not
plan to implement general policies
for students troubled or affected
by the war, as he did after the
Earthquake of 1989. If placed on
academic probation, students will
be dealt with individually, and

those called into service may be
released from financial obliga
tions to the University, he said.
Kennedy fielded questions
about whether the University
should divest from tobacco com
panies that direct advertisements
toward youth, minorities or peo
ple in other countries who are
uneducated about the health haz
ards associated with smoking.
It is "better to use our influ
ence on companies than to make a
single gesture and get out," he
said.

Addressing the planned demo
lition of Delta Tau Delta, Phi Psi
and Synergy, Kennedy called the
three houses, which were dam
aged in the 1989 earthquake,
"wonderful old monsters." He
said the houses will be razed and
replaced with faculty housing, but
the money obtained by selling the
houses may be channeled into
building new student housing in
more convenient locations.
He said a persuasive co-op resi
dent advocate urged him not to
destroy the damaged houses dur

ing his 6:30 a.m. run to the Dish
yesterday.
Senator Noel Maurer, a junior,
cited statistics from a U.S. News
and World Report survey on how
much colleges spend on their stu
dents. According to the study,
Stanford spends about $65,000
per student, surpassed only by the
California Institute of Technology,
at $102,000. Maurer asked how
those statistics measured the Uni
versity's commitment to teaching.
"What do the figures mean?
Are they something good or a

problem?" Maurer asked.
"I simply cannot answer the
second question for the simple
reason that I cannot answer the
first," Kennedy said, to the laugh
ter of his audience.
He said the University does not
supply any statistical information
for the survey, and called the
study a "pseudo-quantification."
But Kennedy said he thought the
U.S. News and World Report sur
vey has improved; it ranked Stan
ford higher this year than it did
last year.

when the senate declared its oppo
sition to "an unprovoked, non-
U.N.-sponsored military offensive
in the Middle East."
"It seems the ASSU Senate
exceeds its boundaries of power
and responsibility," said senior
Marc Evans during an open
forum speech before the vote on
the Overdeck bill.
After seeing his bill defeated,
Overdeck remained upbeat. "I
was pleased we could articulate
our point of view," he said. "I hope
that it comes up in the spring" on
the ballot as an initiative.
An opponent of the bill, senator
Naomi Onaga said the vote tells
studen 1 9 the ASSU needs "to

To underscore her desire to see
the senate take a balanced
approach to non-Stanford issues,
Onaga, a senior, submitted a bill
that would allow the senate to
debate broader issues but would
require it to solicit student opin
ion before doing so. Her bill was
sent to the student affairs com
mittee.
According to the results of an
ASSU telephone poll released
Monday, Stanford students were
nearly evenly divided when asked
"should the ASSU Senate be lim
ited in the statements it can make
on certain state, national and
international issues?"
The senate also changed two of
its general election bylaws. The
first, authored by Bone and
passed 15-3, is intended to avoid
the controversy that has sprung
up over when campaigning can
officially start. It specifically

states that campaigning can begin
exactly one week — or 168 hours
— before the first polls open.
The second bill was authored
by senate chair Solina Kwan, a
junior. That bill was designed to
combat the proliferation of cam
paign flyers during campaigns.
The bill puts a cap of up to 750
fliers — depending on the office —
on the number of fliers candidates
can post.
The bill, which passed 14-7
amid murmurs from senators
complaining about the length of
the meeting, also stated that this
year's candidates for various
offices must spend anywhere from
$15 to $50 less on their campaigns
than last year's candidates.
In other business, graduate
senator Michael Wolfe submitted
a resignation letter, dated Jan. 31,
1991. Wolfe, who has never
attended a senate meeting, wrote
he "has been unable to attend as
many meetings as I feel would be
acceptable, so I would rather
another senator take my place."
Wolfe cited his responsibilities
as a resident assistant in Potter
House and as a computer science
teaching assistant as reasons for
stepping down. He will be replaced
by a non-voting graduate senator,
Kwan said.

The bill, which passed 14-7
amid murmurs from senators

$15 to $50 less on their campaigns
than last year's candidates.
In other business, graduate
senator Michael Wolfe submitted
a resignation letter, dated Jan. 31,

he "has been unable to attend as

In his quarterly appearance at
the ASSU Senate last night, Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
entertained questions from sena
tors and kept them entertained
with his often-humorous replies.
But Kennedy's tone was seri
ous when he addressed questions
about the federal investigations of
Stanford's indirect cost policies
and how the "fallout" from the
probes will affect the University.
Graduate senator Larry
Augustin said he is concerned the
indirect cost controversy has
hampered funding for some
research proposals. He said the
image that Stanford is frivolously

After spending hours in sharp
debate over what they should
debate, the ASSU senate last
night defeated a bill that would
have limited the scope of its legis
lation to campus-related issues.
The bill's defeat serves as a sig
nal from the senate that it is free
to take stands on state, national
or international issues whether or
not they have an impact within
Campus Drive.
Senator David Brown, a vocal
opponent of the bill, said last
night's senate action "preserves
the presumption that the ASSU
will be active on all kinds of
issues."
The senate also voted to change
a number of the ASSU's general
election bylaws in anticipation of
this spring's races.
Last night's meeting — which
after four hours was moved into
the Law School courtyard to allow
a janitor to close the room the sen
ate normally uses — began after a
number of general comments by
University President Donald
Kennedy.
Kennedy fielded several ques-

tions from senators on issues
ranging from the current contro
versy over indirect cost recovery
to what services the University is
providing students in response to
the outbreak of war in the Persian
Gulf.
Bringing to a close nearly two
hours of verbal wrangling, the
senate voted 13-7 to kill the scope
legislation. Co-authored by gradu
ate senators John Overdeck and
Douglas Bone, the bill said the
senate and Council of Presidents
should remain quiet on "state,
national or international matters
not directly affecting Stanford
students."
The bill's proponents said it
was meant to stop the ASSU from

universities most likely charge the
government for the same kind of
expenses that have proven embar
rassing to the University during
the past few weeks, such as flower
arrangements at Hoover House.
Stanford is "no more frivolous"
than any comparable institution,
he said.
Some senators expressed con

cern about the appropriateness of
the University's policy for stu
dents who are affected by the war
in the Middle East. Many people
have not been keeping up with
their academic studies in order to
organize teach-ins or protests, one
senator said.
But Kennedy said he does not
plan to implement general policies
for students troubled or affected
by the war, as he did after the
Earthquake of 1989. If placed on
academic probation, students will
be dealt with individually, and

those called into service may be
released from financial obliga
tions to the University, he said.
Kennedy fielded questions
about whether the University
should divest from tobacco com
panies that direct advertisements
toward youth, minorities or peo
ple in other countries who are
uneducated about the health haz
ards associated with smoking.
It is "better to use our influ
ence on companies than to make a
single gesture and get out," he
said.

Addressing the planned demo
lition of Delta Tau Delta, Phi Psi
and Synergy, Kennedy called the
three houses, which were dam
aged in the 1989 earthquake,
"wonderful old monsters." He
said the houses will be razed and
replaced with faculty housing, but
the money obtained by selling the
houses may be channeled into
building new student housing in
more convenient locations.
He said a persuasive co-op resi
dent advocate urged him not to
destroy the damaged houses dur

ing his 6:30 a.m. run to the Dish
yesterday.
Senator Noel Maurer, a junior,
cited statistics from a U.S. News
and World Report survey on how
much colleges spend on their stu
dents. According to the study,
Stanford spends about $65,000
per student, surpassed only by the
California Institute of Technology,
at $102,000. Maurer asked how
those statistics measured the Uni
versity's commitment to teaching.
"What do the figures mean?
Are they something good or a

problem?" Maurer asked.
"I simply cannot answer the
second question for the simple
reason that I cannot answer the
first," Kennedy said, to the laugh
ter of his audience.
He said the University does not
supply any statistical information
for the survey, and called the
study a "pseudo-quantification."
But Kennedy said he thought the
U.S. News and World Report sur
vey has improved; it ranked Stan
ford higher this year than it did
last year.

when the senate declared its oppo

"It seems the ASSU Senate
exceeds its boundaries of power
and responsibility," said senior
Marc Evans during an open
forum speech before the vote on
the Overdeck bill.
After seeing his bill defeated,
Overdeck remained upbeat. "I
was pleased we could articulate
our point of view," he said. "I hope
that it comes up in the spring" on
the ballot as an initiative.
An opponent of the bill, senator
Naomi Onaga said the vote tells
studen 1 9 the ASSU needs "to
strike a balance between being a
voice (of the students) and being
accountable to them."
To underscore her desire to see
the senate take a balanced
approach to non-Stanford issues,
Onaga, a senior, submitted a bill
that would allow the senate to
debate broader issues but would
require it to solicit student opin
ion before doing so. Her bill was
sent to the student affairs com
mittee.
According to the results of an
ASSU telephone poll released
Monday, Stanford students were
nearly evenly divided when asked
"should the ASSU Senate be lim
ited in the statements it can make
on certain state, national and
international issues?"
The senate also changed two of
