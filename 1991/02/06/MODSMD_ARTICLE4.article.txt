In his quarterly appearance at
the ASSU Senate last night, Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
entertained questions from sena
tors and kept them entertained

about the federal investigations of
Stanford's indirect cost policies
and how the "fallout" from the

to what services the University is
providing students in response to
the outbreak of war in the Persian
Gulf.
Bringing to a close nearly two
hours of verbal wrangling, the
senate voted 13-7 to kill the scope
legislation. Co-authored by gradu
ate senators John Overdeck and
Douglas Bone, the bill said the
senate and Council of Presidents
should remain quiet on "state,
national or international matters

Kennedy responded to a senator's question about Stanford's spending per student with, 'I'm totally
