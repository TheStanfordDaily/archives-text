## 
### Howard Libit Staff writer 
Richard Lyman, former
University President and Di
rector of the Institute for
International Studies, an
nounced Monday that he will
retire effective Aug. 31.
The announcement came
only a week after the conclu
sion of the first meeting of the
International Advisory Coun
cil, a group of international
political leaders, business exec
utives and academics organized
by the institute.
Lyman served as University
president from 1970 to 1980,
before which he was provost
and a professor of history. He
left to become president of the
Rockefeller Foundation in New
York.
He returned to Stanford in
September 1988 to found the
Institute for International
Studies. Last week's confer
ence, organized by Lyman and
former Secretary of State and
Hoover Institution Distin
guished Fellow George Shultz,

attracted such dignitaries as
former President Gerald Ford,
former West German Chancel
lor Helmut Schmidt, Nobel
Peace Prize winner and former
Costa Rican President Oscar
Arias and former Prime Minis
ter of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew.

Lyman said he decided to retire
in December while he and his wife
Jing vacationed in Vermont and
considered the future.
"I decided to retire because I
have had enough administration,"
Lyman said. "I realized that I
have had more than a quarter of a
century of administration. My
longest time off of work was three
months in the fall of 1972."
"I would like to read whole
books for a change," he added.
Lyman has no immediate
retirement plans. He said he may
do some writing, possibly about
his experiences as University
president, but is "not sure what
exactly I will write and on what
schedule."
He also hopes to "follow the
crazy course of events in the
world."
The search for Lyman's succes
sor will begin immediately,
according to Provost James
Rosse.
"We need to work hard to find a
strong replacement. He did the
most important job for the insti
tute and gave it the momentum to
get it started," said Rosse. "He
provided the strength and leader
ship to fashion the institute into a
success and he breathed life into
it."
University President Donald
Kennedy also said he hopes to find
a replacement for Lyman in the
near future.
"As to the Institute for Interna
tional Studies, we'll just have to
look around and try to get leader
ship as good as Dick's given us,"
Kennedy said.
Officials at the institute were
not available for comment on
Lyman's retirement.
Although Lyman is retiring
from the institute, he does not
expect to leave Stanford alto
gether. He will continue living in

Palo Alto and noted that as presi
dent emeritus he will still be occa
sionally asked for advice.
"He is a very wise man and has
meant a great deal to Stanford,"
Rosse said. "He will still be an
active part of the University and
we will be able call on him from
time to time."
Kennedy expressed similar
thoughts, saying, "Happily, Dick
Lyman will still be around the
University and continue to play a
very valuable role, so we don't
have to think about replacing him
in that regard."
Lyman waited to announce his
retirement until Monday to main
tain people's focus on the Advi
sory Council's meeting 10 days
ago.
"If I had come back [from vaca
tion] in January and announced
my retirement before the confer
ence, it would have distracted peo
ple," Lyman said.
Lyman said he is "extremely
pleased" by the success of both
the institute and the first meeting
of the International Advisory
Council.
"It was important to try to get
the institute established as an
interdisciplinary study of interna
tional issues. The current global
environment demonstrates the
need for this institute," Lyman
said.
"George Shultz did an unbe
lievable job of recruiting. Many
people at the council came up to
me and told me that only George
Shultz could gather all of these
people together," said Lyman.
Lyman does not expect his
retirement to have a significant
effect on the institute's future.
"Any time someone steps down
there will be a destabilizing influ
ence for a brief period of time. But
I do not doubt that the University
will find a successor," Lyman said.
Lyman said he is proud of his
10 years as University president,
which saw marked changes at
Stanford.
