# Ban on rock band could soon be Dead
## 
### Miranda Doyle Staff writer 
What a long, strange trip it's
been.
Two years after Jerry Garcia
and his band were banned from
performing at Frost Amphithe
ater — after 29 fans were arrested
outside the concert for drug- and
alcohol-related offenses — think
the Grateful Dead may rise again.
"We have pretty much gotten
the go-ahead from the Univer
sity," said Colin Hubbard, a co
founder of a group formed last
spring to protest the ban on the
band. The problem now, he added,

is coordinating a date with the
group and the administration.
However, University officials
have made no statement about
the possibility of allowing the
band to return.
Concert Network Director
Mary Escobedo said, "I cannot say
if it will happen." She added that
no plans or decisions have been
made yet. If there is not a concert
this year, she said, there could be
one next year. Even if the band
can be scheduled, however, she
said the issue of drug use must be
discussed.
Escobedo said she has been
working with students and the

University for the last year in an
attempt to bring the band back to
campus.
During the Dead's 1989 visit,
Stanford Police arrested 20 people
in the eucalyptus grove outside
the amphitheater for buying, pos
sessing, selling or using drugs.
Nine others were arrested for
alcohol-related offenses, two of
them for drunk driving.
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer said the police continue
to oppose inviting the Dead back
to campus. He said he believes
having large rock concerts, espe
cially Grateful Dead concerts,
attracts an undesirable element.

Niemeyer said although the
concerts themselves have not
been a problem, the "carnival
atmosphere" outside the amphi
theater has been a threat to public
safety.
"We do not have the police
resources to deal with it,"he said.
With limited numbers of officers,
the volume of arrests made the
concerts a considerable workload
for the small department,
Niemeyer added.
After the 1989 show, then-
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons told the Concert Network
not to ask the band back for a con
cert last year because of the drug
problems.
Last April Stanford Police and
Office of Student Affairs office
announced the Dead would not be
allowed to perform at Stanford,
citing the drug problems that
accompanied the band's concerts.
Hubbard blamed the band's
resurgent popularity for the trou
ble two years ago. "Their popular
ity has skyrocketed in the last few
years," he said. In 1987, the group

released a new album, "In the
Dark," and received a large
amount of air time, he added.
The concerts drew more people
than could fit in the 9,500-person
capacity amphitheater each of the
two days they were held. "That is
what really caused the problem,"
Hubbard said.
There were people in the over
flowing crowd who "did not quite
know how to behave," he said.
Some were looking for drugs,
refusing to obey the police and
causing trouble, he added.
"The University [administra
tors] were not the only ones who
thought the last show was a little
out of control," he admitted. But

he said he was disappointed by the
University's reaction to the con
cert.
Niemeyer said he believes that
if enough undercover police offi
cers had been available, the
department could have made 300
to 400 additional arrests at last
year's concerts.
Niemeyer expressed concern
about the "Deadheads," fans who
follow the band around the coun
try and camp out at the concerts.
They are transients who live in
beat-up buses and trucks and sell
food, beads and tie-dyed clothing
at Grateful Dead performances,
he said.
"Some, not all, also sell drugs,"

Niemeyer added. "We have had a
lot of cases where these people
have just freaked out on LSD, pey
ote and mushrooms. Some get
pretty combative."
He estimated that from 500 to
1,000 "Deadheads" attended the
last Stanford concert. "You have
all of these burned-out hippies
from the '60s everywhere," plus
young people who come to the
concert, he said.
After the University banned
the Grateful Dead, disappointed
fans quickly formed a student
group called "We Need a Miracle"
to protest the decision. About two
weeks after the announcement,
they held a rally in White Plaza.

More than 100 students gathered
for the protest.
The concerned students then
met with Lyons to discuss resum
ing the tradition this year.
Hubbard said he thinks the
concert ban was unnecessary.
"The University gave the Grateful
Dead some flak, and [the band]
decided it would be better for
everyone if they did not come
back," he said.
Then, "out of the blue," Stan
ford issued a national press
release about their decision and
the reasons for it, Hubbard said.
The incident was widely publi
cized, a move he said was "a cheap
shot" since the Grateful Dead had

already said they would not
return.
"This really upset the Grateful
Dead," Hubbard said. His student
group "spent most of last year try
ing to make amends."
Hubbard also said he thinks
the police "refused to take our
proposals seriously or meet with
us to discuss them. The Police
Department is still dragging their
feet. They are a big obstacle."
Hubbard said the Dead have a
long history in the Bay Area and
at Stanford. The band played in
the Arroyo House lounge in the
19605, he said, and at Tresidder
Student Union in 1972.

capacity amphitheater each of the
two days they were held. "That is
what really caused the problem,"
Hubbard said.
There were people in the over
flowing crowd who "did not quite
know how to behave," he said.
Some were looking for drugs,
refusing to obey the police and
causing trouble, he added.
"The University [administra
tors] were not the only ones who
thought the last show was a little
out of control," he admitted. But

he said he was disappointed by the
University's reaction to the con
cert.
Niemeyer said he believes that
if enough undercover police offi
cers had been available, the
department could have made 300
to 400 additional arrests at last
year's concerts.
Niemeyer expressed concern
about the "Deadheads," fans who
follow the band around the coun
try and camp out at the concerts.
They are transients who live in
beat-up buses and trucks and sell
food, beads and tie-dyed clothing
at Grateful Dead performances,
he said.
"Some, not all, also sell drugs,"

Niemeyer added. "We have had a
lot of cases where these people
have just freaked out on LSD, pey
ote and mushrooms. Some get
pretty combative."
He estimated that from 500 to
1,000 "Deadheads" attended the
last Stanford concert. "You have
all of these burned-out hippies
from the '60s everywhere," plus
young people who come to the
concert, he said.
After the University banned
the Grateful Dead, disappointed
fans quickly formed a student
group called "We Need a Miracle"
to protest the decision. About two
weeks after the announcement,
they held a rally in White Plaza.

More than 100 students gathered
for the protest.
The concerned students then
met with Lyons to discuss resum
ing the tradition this year.
Hubbard said he thinks the
concert ban was unnecessary.
"The University gave the Grateful
Dead some flak, and [the band]
decided it would be better for
everyone if they did not come
back," he said.
Then, "out of the blue," Stan
ford issued a national press
release about their decision and
the reasons for it, Hubbard said.
The incident was widely publi
cized, a move he said was "a cheap
shot" since the Grateful Dead had

already said they would not
return.
"This really upset the Grateful
Dead," Hubbard said. His student
group "spent most of last year try
ing to make amends."
Hubbard also said he thinks
the police "refused to take our
proposals seriously or meet with
us to discuss them. The Police
Department is still dragging their
feet. They are a big obstacle."
Hubbard said the Dead have a
long history in the Bay Area and
at Stanford. The band played in
the Arroyo House lounge in the
19605, he said, and at Tresidder
Student Union in 1972.
What a long, strange trip it's
been.
Two years after Jerry Garcia
and his band were banned from
performing at Frost Amphithe
ater — after 29 fans were arrested
outside the concert for drug- and
alcohol-related offenses — think
the Grateful Dead may rise again.
"We have pretty much gotten
the go-ahead from the Univer
sity," said Colin Hubbard, a co
founder of a group formed last
spring to protest the ban on the
band. The problem now, he added,

is coordinating a date with the
group and the administration.
However, University officials
have made no statement about
the possibility of allowing the
band to return.
Concert Network Director
Mary Escobedo said, "I cannot say
if it will happen." She added that
no plans or decisions have been
made yet. If there is not a concert
this year, she said, there could be
one next year. Even if the band
can be scheduled, however, she
said the issue of drug use must be
discussed.
Escobedo said she has been
working with students and the

University for the last year in an
attempt to bring the band back to
campus.
During the Dead's 1989 visit,
Stanford Police arrested 20 people
in the eucalyptus grove outside
the amphitheater for buying, pos
sessing, selling or using drugs.
Nine others were arrested for
alcohol-related offenses, two of
them for drunk driving.
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer said the police continue
to oppose inviting the Dead back
to campus. He said he believes
having large rock concerts, espe
cially Grateful Dead concerts,
attracts an undesirable element.

Niemeyer said although the
concerts themselves have not
been a problem, the "carnival
atmosphere" outside the amphi
theater has been a threat to public
safety.
"We do not have the police
resources to deal with it,"he said.
With limited numbers of officers,
the volume of arrests made the
concerts a considerable workload
for the small department,
Niemeyer added.
After the 1989 show, then-
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons told the Concert Network
not to ask the band back for a con
cert last year because of the drug
problems.
Last April Stanford Police and
Office of Student Affairs office
announced the Dead would not be
allowed to perform at Stanford,
citing the drug problems that
accompanied the band's concerts.
Hubbard blamed the band's
resurgent popularity for the trou
ble two years ago. "Their popular
ity has skyrocketed in the last few
years," he said. In 1987, the group

released a new album, "In the
Dark," and received a large
amount of air time, he added.
The concerts drew more people
than could fit in the 9,500-person
capacity amphitheater each of the
two days they were held. "That is
what really caused the problem,"
Hubbard said.

flowing crowd who "did not quite
