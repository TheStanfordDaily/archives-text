# Ban on rock band could soon be Dead
## 
### Miranda Doyle Staff writer 
What a long, strange trip it's
been.
Two years after Jerry Garcia
and his band were banned from
performing at Frost Amphithe
ater — after 29 fans were arrested
outside the concert for drug- and
alcohol-related offenses — think
the Grateful Dead may rise again.
"We have pretty much gotten
the go-ahead from the Univer
sity," said Colin Hubbard, a co
founder of a group formed last
spring to protest the ban on the
band. The problem now, he added,

is coordinating a date with the
group and the administration.
However, University officials
have made no statement about
the possibility of allowing the
band to return.
Concert Network Director
Mary Escobedo said, "I cannot say
if it will happen." She added that
no plans or decisions have been
made yet. If there is not a concert
this year, she said, there could be
one next year. Even if the band
can be scheduled, however, she
said the issue of drug use must be
discussed.
Escobedo said she has been
working with students and the

University for the last year in an
attempt to bring the band back to
campus.
During the Dead's 1989 visit,
Stanford Police arrested 20 people
in the eucalyptus grove outside
the amphitheater for buying, pos
sessing, selling or using drugs.
Nine others were arrested for
alcohol-related offenses, two of
them for drunk driving.
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer said the police continue
to oppose inviting the Dead back
to campus. He said he believes
having large rock concerts, espe
cially Grateful Dead concerts,
attracts an undesirable element.

Niemeyer said although the
concerts themselves have not
been a problem, the "carnival
atmosphere" outside the amphi
theater has been a threat to public
safety.
"We do not have the police
resources to deal with it,"he said.
With limited numbers of officers,
the volume of arrests made the
concerts a considerable workload
for the small department,
Niemeyer added.
After the 1989 show, then-
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons told the Concert Network
