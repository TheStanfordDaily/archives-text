The future of Okada's Teahouse has
dimmed some since University officials shut
down the snack bar temporarily because of

it's been worse."
The violations were not discovered during a
formal investigation. Instead, Tamiesie said,
the problems were found by Wilbur Hall staff
members who were "familiarizing themselves
