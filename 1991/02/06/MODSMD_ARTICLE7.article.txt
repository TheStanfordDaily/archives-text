# Teahouse shut down due to safety violations
## 
### Art Marcum 
The future of Okada's Teahouse has
dimmed some since University officials shut
down the snack bar temporarily because of
Health and Safety Code violations.
Because of fire-safety concerns, the Tea
house was never reopened after it shut down
for winter break. "It was a possibly life-threat
ening situation," Asst. Manager of Student
Housing Suzanne Tamiesie said of the facil
ity's condition.
A final report on the reasons for closing the
Teahouse and the possibilities for reopening it
will be released Monday.

The list of infractions includes cooking in
an area that does not have proper ventilation,
using hot plates that were "in poor condition,"
having several unsafe extension cords and
having decorative banners that were made out
of non-flame retardant material, Tamiesie
said.
Stanford Fire Marshal Ray Gamma called
the conditions at the Teahouse "substandard."
He said that the Teahouse was created out
of a storage room and that no one had ever
obtained the permits required to cook and
serve food. "You cannot start these things
without going through the proper channels,"
he said.

The shutdown came as surprise to those
who operated and worked there. Teahouse
worker Mary Yen, a sophomore, said she
thought conditions were "no big deal."
Teahouse manager Don Chin was also
caught by surprise. Commenting on the
alleged infractions, Chin said, "As far as I
know, its always been like that. In fact I think
it's been worse."
The violations were not discovered during a
formal investigation. Instead, Tamiesie said,
the problems were found by Wilbur Hall staff
members who were "familiarizing themselves
with the building."
Tamiesie went on to say that
the reason it took twenty years
before these discoveries were
made is because "The Teahouse
slipped through the cracks. It
didn't fall under anyone's partic
ular jurisdiction."
Chin, a senior, said he is opti
mistic that the Teahouse will
reopen, but not for some time.
"The initial cost estimates [to
make the Teahouse legally opera
tional] are $15,000 dollars. . . . We
don't have that kind of money
right now." He added that it will
most likely reopen sometime
early next year if organizers find
sufficient funding, most of which
he expects to come from alumni.
Tamiesie said that from now
on the Teahouse will be consid
ered an official program much
like the campus eating clubs and
will be subject to regular inspec
tion when it reopens.
She also expressed concern
that students not get the wrong
idea about the closure.
"We want the Stanford com
munity to know that we are very
supportive of programs like the
Teahouse and the cultural diver
sity it represents, she said. "We
want to let the program get back
on track."
A reopening would please stu
dents who frequented the late
night snack bar. Freshman Steve
Brown said he was "bummed"
that the Teahouse has been
closed.
"When it's real late at night
and you're hungry, it's a great
place to go eat and hang out.
Nothing else is open that late on
campus," he said.
