# Navy report dismisses serious overcharge allegation
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
A long-awaited report released
today by the Navy dismisses some
of the most serious allegations
that have been made about the
University's indirect cost policies,
including the claim by a federal
regulator that Stanford benefited
by as much as $200 million from a
"cozy" relationship with the
Office of Naval Research.
The report, however, says gov
ernment oversight of Stanford
has been far too lax during the
past decade and does not rule out
the possibility that Stanford over
charged the government in some
instances.
The findings are published in
an 80-page report by the Inspector
General of the Office of the Chief
of Naval Research, one of four fed
eral agencies that have been
investigating Stanford's indirect
cost policies.
In an interview last night, Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
said he was "quite gratified" with
the report's findings.

The Navy investigation, which
began six months ago, was
prompted by allegations made by
Paul Biddle, the campus represen
tative of the Office of Naval
Research. The naval office is the
federal agency responsible for
monitoring Stanford's research
costs.
Biddle has contended that prior
to his arrival at Stanford in Octo
ber 1988, the local naval office
was far too accommodating to the
University, allowing it to recover
millions of dollars in indirect costs
that it was not entitled to.
The investigation, however,
found no evidence of special treat
ment of Stanford. "While certain
facts, if unexplained, may support
a 'perception' of partiality, there
was no evidence of actual partial
ity of Navy officials in their deal
ings with Stanford," the report
says.
The Inspector General also
concludes that Biddle used "ques
tionable logic and very subjective
judgment" to calculate his $200
million estimate of overcharging.
"We have concluded that (Bid-

die) was not able to factually sup
port his contention of a $200 mil
lion overpayment to Stanford,"
the report says.
However, the report goes on to
say, "there appears to be some
validity to (Biddle's) concern that
the government overpaid Stan
ford for indirect costs during the
period." The investigators were
unable to "substantiate or reliably
estimate the exact amount" of any
overbilling, however.
Indirect costs of conducting
research are those costs not easily
attributable to a specific research
project and include such expenses
as electricity, building depreciation
and use of the library by
researchers. The government reim-

burses Stanford
for the indirect
costs of federal
research done
here.
The matter of
whether Stanford
owes the govern
ment money is far
from settled. De
fense Department

auditors and negotiating teams
from Stanford and the Navy are
looking at charges dating back to
1981 and will not close the books
on those years for at least several
months.
Under federal rules, the gov
ernment and universities are
expected to negotiate costs for
individual years on a more timely
basis. The report released yester
day criticizes top-ranking Office of
Naval Research officials for allow
ing Stanford's books to remain
open for so long.
Additional effort should have
been made "to bring Stanford's
indirect cost rates into a more cur
