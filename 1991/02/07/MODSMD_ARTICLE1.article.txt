# Navy report dismisses serious overcharge allegation
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
A long-awaited report released
today by the Navy dismisses some
of the most serious allegations
that have been made about the
University's indirect cost policies,
including the claim by a federal
regulator that Stanford benefited
by as much as $200 million from a
"cozy" relationship with the
Office of Naval Research.
The report, however, says gov
ernment oversight of Stanford
has been far too lax during the
past decade and does not rule out
the possibility that Stanford over
charged the government in some
instances.
The findings are published in
an 80-page report by the Inspector
General of the Office of the Chief
of Naval Research, one of four fed
eral agencies that have been
investigating Stanford's indirect
cost policies.
In an interview last night, Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
said he was "quite gratified" with
the report's findings.

The Navy investigation, which
began six months ago, was
prompted by allegations made by
Paul Biddle, the campus represen
tative of the Office of Naval
Research. The naval office is the
federal agency responsible for
monitoring Stanford's research
costs.
Biddle has contended that prior
to his arrival at Stanford in Octo
ber 1988, the local naval office
was far too accommodating to the
University, allowing it to recover
millions of dollars in indirect costs
that it was not entitled to.
The investigation, however,
found no evidence of special treat
ment of Stanford. "While certain
facts, if unexplained, may support
a 'perception' of partiality, there
was no evidence of actual partial
ity of Navy officials in their deal
ings with Stanford," the report
says.
The Inspector General also
concludes that Biddle used "ques
tionable logic and very subjective
judgment" to calculate his $200
million estimate of overcharging.
"We have concluded that (Bid-

Donald Kennedy said
he was 'quite grati
fied' with the report's
findings.

die) was not able to factually sup
port his contention of a $200 mil
lion overpayment to Stanford,"
the report says.
However, the report goes on to
say, "there appears to be some
validity to (Biddle's) concern that
the government overpaid Stan
ford for indirect costs during the
period." The investigators were
unable to "substantiate or reliably
estimate the exact amount" of any
overbilling, however.
Indirect costs of conducting
research are those costs not easily
attributable to a specific research
project and include such expenses
as electricity, building depreciation
and use of the library by
researchers. The government reim-

burses Stanford
for the indirect
costs of federal
research done
here.
The matter of
whether Stanford
owes the govern
ment money is far
from settled. De
fense Department

auditors and negotiating teams
from Stanford and the Navy are
looking at charges dating back to
1981 and will not close the books
on those years for at least several
months.
Under federal rules, the gov
ernment and universities are
expected to negotiate costs for
individual years on a more timely
basis. The report released yester
day criticizes top-ranking Office of
Naval Research officials for allow
ing Stanford's books to remain
open for so long.
Additional effort should have
been made "to bring Stanford's
indirect cost rates into a more cur

rent status," the report says.
Due to the large number of
years for which costs are still
being negotiated, some adjust
ments to the University's recov
ery should be expected, Kennedy
said last night.
The release of the report
"doesn't necessarily make us
immune from bad news on the
numbers," he added. "There will
no doubt be some adjustments up
and some adjustments down."
But the report does give the
University reason to believe the
net adjustment won't be nearly as
large as Biddle has alleged,
Kennedy said. Biddle's $200 mil
lion figure is "nowhere in the ball
park," according to Kennedy.
The Navy is not allowing Bid
dle to speak to the press.
Congressional investigators,
who are conducting a separate
review of Stanford's policies,
expressed disappointment yester
day with the Navy review's focus.
According to one staff member

of the House Subcommittee on
Oversight and Investigations, the
Navy report took a "narrow
minded" approach, dwelling too
much on the credibility of Biddle's
calculations instead of his broader
concerns about lack of govern
ment oversight.
"Biddle was basically right on
target," the staff member said.
"The bottom line is that the Navy
didn't carry out its fiduciary
responsibility to the taxpayers
during the 1980s."
Many of Biddle's objections
center around agreements signed
by Stanford and the government,
called "memoranda of under
standing." Many of these agree
ments allow Stanford to collect
more in indirect cost recovery
than would otherwise be possible
under government rules.
Dozens of agreements
Stanford has far more memo
randa of understanding with the
government than any of the other
36 universities regulated by the
Office of Naval Research. Accord
ing to the report, Stanford has 95
such agreements pertaining to
indirect costs, while the next high

est number is five, at MIT.
The report concludes that the
large number of agreements
between Stanford and the govern
ment is not necessarily a sign of
coziness, as fliddle has suggested.
But the report is extremely
critical of higher-ranking officials
in the Office of Naval Research for
not taking a more active role in
reviewing and giving formal
approval to these agreements.
None of the memoranda of
understanding signed during the
last decade were formally audited
or reviewed by Navy legal counsel,
as is required by government reg
ulations, the report notes. Nor did
they have formal review and
approval by high-ranking officials
in the naval agency, as is required.

Because of this lack of review,
the report concludes, some of the
agreements may be "flawed" and
may have allowed Stanford to
overbill the government.
The report recommends that
the Office of Naval Research
establish a formal policy on the
use of memoranda of understand
in&-
The University announced two
weeks ago that it would take sev

eral steps to improve its account
ability to the government on indi
rect cost issues. The moves
include the formation of a special
advisory panel and the retention
of Arthur Anderson and Co. to
evaluate Stanford's accounting
system.
'Full steam ahead'
The findings of today's report
will not detract from these efforts,
Kennedy said. "This isn't going to
change our course of action," he
said. "We're going full steam
ahead."
Stanford's indirect cost policies
are still under review by the
House Subcommittee, the Gen
eral Accounting Office and the
Naval Investigative Service.
The Naval Investigative Ser
vice, which operates indepen
dently of the Office of Naval
Research, is looking into the pos
sibility of criminal wrongdoing.
The House subcommittee is
expected to hold hearings in early
March. A staff member of the sub

whether Stanford
owes the govern
ment money is far
from settled. De
fense Department

auditors and negotiating teams
from Stanford and the Navy are
looking at charges dating back to
1981 and will not close the books
on those years for at least several
months.
Under federal rules, the gov
ernment and universities are
expected to negotiate costs for
individual years on a more timely
basis. The report released yester
day criticizes top-ranking Office of
Naval Research officials for allow
ing Stanford's books to remain
open for so long.
Additional effort should have
been made "to bring Stanford's
indirect cost rates into a more cur

rent status," the report says.
Due to the large number of
years for which costs are still
being negotiated, some adjust
ments to the University's recov
ery should be expected, Kennedy
said last night.
The release of the report
"doesn't necessarily make us
immune from bad news on the
numbers," he added. "There will
no doubt be some adjustments up
and some adjustments down."
But the report does give the
University reason to believe the
net adjustment won't be nearly as
large as Biddle has alleged,
Kennedy said. Biddle's $200 mil
lion figure is "nowhere in the ball
park," according to Kennedy.
The Navy is not allowing Bid
dle to speak to the press.
Congressional investigators,
who are conducting a separate
review of Stanford's policies,
expressed disappointment yester
day with the Navy review's focus.
According to one staff member

of the House Subcommittee on
Oversight and Investigations, the
Navy report took a "narrow
minded" approach, dwelling too
much on the credibility of Biddle's
calculations instead of his broader
concerns about lack of govern
ment oversight.
"Biddle was basically right on
target," the staff member said.
"The bottom line is that the Navy
didn't carry out its fiduciary
responsibility to the taxpayers
during the 1980s."
Many of Biddle's objections
center around agreements signed
by Stanford and the government,
called "memoranda of under
standing." Many of these agree
ments allow Stanford to collect
more in indirect cost recovery
than would otherwise be possible
under government rules.
Dozens of agreements
Stanford has far more memo
randa of understanding with the
government than any of the other
36 universities regulated by the
Office of Naval Research. Accord
ing to the report, Stanford has 95
such agreements pertaining to
indirect costs, while the next high

est number is five, at MIT.
The report concludes that the
large number of agreements
between Stanford and the govern
ment is not necessarily a sign of
coziness, as fliddle has suggested.
But the report is extremely
critical of higher-ranking officials
in the Office of Naval Research for
not taking a more active role in
reviewing and giving formal
approval to these agreements.
None of the memoranda of
understanding signed during the
last decade were formally audited
or reviewed by Navy legal counsel,
as is required by government reg
ulations, the report notes. Nor did
they have formal review and
approval by high-ranking officials
in the naval agency, as is required.

Because of this lack of review,
the report concludes, some of the
agreements may be "flawed" and
may have allowed Stanford to
overbill the government.
The report recommends that
the Office of Naval Research
establish a formal policy on the
use of memoranda of understand
in&-
The University announced two
weeks ago that it would take sev

eral steps to improve its account
ability to the government on indi
rect cost issues. The moves
include the formation of a special
advisory panel and the retention
of Arthur Anderson and Co. to
evaluate Stanford's accounting
system.
'Full steam ahead'
The findings of today's report
will not detract from these efforts,
Kennedy said. "This isn't going to
change our course of action," he
said. "We're going full steam
ahead."
Stanford's indirect cost policies
are still under review by the
House Subcommittee, the Gen
eral Accounting Office and the
Naval Investigative Service.
The Naval Investigative Ser
vice, which operates indepen
dently of the Office of Naval
Research, is looking into the pos
sibility of criminal wrongdoing.
The House subcommittee is
expected to hold hearings in early
March. A staff member of the sub
committee said yesterday that the
Navy's report will have little
effect on the hearings.
A long-awaited report released
today by the Navy dismisses some
of the most serious allegations
that have been made about the
University's indirect cost policies,
including the claim by a federal
regulator that Stanford benefited
by as much as $200 million from a
"cozy" relationship with the
Office of Naval Research.
The report, however, says gov
ernment oversight of Stanford
has been far too lax during the
past decade and does not rule out
the possibility that Stanford over
charged the government in some
instances.
The findings are published in
an 80-page report by the Inspector
General of the Office of the Chief
of Naval Research, one of four fed
eral agencies that have been
investigating Stanford's indirect
cost policies.
In an interview last night, Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
said he was "quite gratified" with
the report's findings.

The Navy investigation, which
began six months ago, was
prompted by allegations made by
Paul Biddle, the campus represen
tative of the Office of Naval
Research. The naval office is the
federal agency responsible for
monitoring Stanford's research
costs.
Biddle has contended that prior
to his arrival at Stanford in Octo
ber 1988, the local naval office
was far too accommodating to the
University, allowing it to recover
millions of dollars in indirect costs
that it was not entitled to.
The investigation, however,
found no evidence of special treat
ment of Stanford. "While certain
facts, if unexplained, may support
a 'perception' of partiality, there
was no evidence of actual partial
ity of Navy officials in their deal
ings with Stanford," the report
says.
The Inspector General also
concludes that Biddle used "ques
tionable logic and very subjective
judgment" to calculate his $200
million estimate of overcharging.
"We have concluded that (Bid-

Donald Kennedy said
he was 'quite grati
fied' with the report's
findings.

die) was not able to factually sup
port his contention of a $200 mil
lion overpayment to Stanford,"
the report says.
However, the report goes on to
say, "there appears to be some
validity to (Biddle's) concern that
the government overpaid Stan
ford for indirect costs during the
period." The investigators were
unable to "substantiate or reliably
estimate the exact amount" of any
overbilling, however.
Indirect costs of conducting
research are those costs not easily
attributable to a specific research
project and include such expenses
as electricity, building depreciation
and use of the library by
researchers. The government reim-

burses Stanford
for the indirect
costs of federal
research done
here.
