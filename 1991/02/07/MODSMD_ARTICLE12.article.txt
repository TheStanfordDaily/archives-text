Gorbachev vows to hold union
MOSCOW (AP) — Mikhail Gorbachev
made a surprise television appearance yester
day night to declare his determination to hold
the country together and urge full participa
tion in the Kremlin's referendum on the
union.
"All my convictions are based on preserva
tion of the union," the Soviet president said,
sitting at a desk to deliver a 15-minute address
at the beginning of the evening newscast.
"The Soviet Union is a superpower," he
said. "Huge efforts were made to make it so
powerful, and we could lose it very quickly."
It was Gorbachev's clearest declaration to
date that he will not let any of the 15 republics
secede.
In a speech that mixed warnings of catastro
phe with promises of ethnic self-determina
tion, Gorbachev showed his frustration with
dozens of nationalist movements that he said
had sapped the country's economy, left hun
dreds dead in ethnic conflicts, and spurred a
shift to hard-line policies.
Tougher rape penalties urged
ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) — Gov. Pete Wilson
told the state's law enforcement leaders yes
terday that he wants to see first-time child
molesters imprisoned for life, time restrictions
on death penalty appeals and longer sentences
for rapists.
"The law in California (on rape) is danger
ously and absurdly lenient," Wilson told the
California Police Chiefs Association, which is
holding its annual convention at the Disney
land Hotel.
The average time spent in jail by a first-time
convicted rapist is 3 1/2 years and Wilson said
he would like to see that figure rise to 24 years.
There is substantial evidence, Wilson said,
that children who are abused suffer for the
rest of their lives, and may also become
abusers themselves.
Arab-American harassment rises
WASHINGTON (AP) — A sharp rise in acts
of violence, harassment or intimidation
against Arab-Americans since war began in the
Persian Gulf was reported yesterday by the
American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Commit
tee.
The civil rights organization reported there
had been nearly 100 incidents since Iraq
invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. These include 47
since the war began Jan. 16.
Albert Mokhiber, the group's president, also
raised questions about an FBI interview Mon
day of an Arab-American government
employee who was questioned about attitudes
of his ethnic group toward the war.
The interview occurred after the FBI said it
had completed contacts with prominent Arab-
Americans to solicit information about poten
tial terrorism.
Anti-Semitic attacks increase
NEW YORK (AP) — Anti-Semitic incidents
climbed to a record 1,685 in 1990 due in part to
events in the Persian Gulf, campus bigotry and
the popularity of crude entertainers, the Anti-
Defamation League said yesterday.
The figure represented an 18 percent
increase over the previous year's 1,432 inci
dents and was the highest total in the 12 years
the study has been done, the ADL said in
releasing its audit of violence, vandalism and
harassment against Jews.
