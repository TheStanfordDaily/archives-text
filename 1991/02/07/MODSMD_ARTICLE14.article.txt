# Soviet group aims to end glasnost
## 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) - The leader
of the self-proclaimed National
Salvation Committee smiled
broadly yesterday as he outlined
the little known group's plan to
take over the Soviet government
and crush every spark of democ
racy.
Flashing his gold teeth genially,
Vladimir Voronin said the com
mittee would eliminate Soviet
parliaments, political parties, the
free press and the presidency.
The chilling platform might
have seemed absurd just last fall,
when Voronin and other extrem
ists formed the committee with
the goal of installing themselves
at the head of government.

Since then, 13 civilians were
killed in an army attack on a tele
vision tower in the Lithuanian
capital of Vilnius, one of various
actions signalling a harder line
from the government. The crack
down was requested by a so-called
National Salvation Committee in
Lithuania.
Voronin said his group has no
connection to the Lithuanian sal
vation committee or a similar
group in Latvia. Both tried to
claim power during the height of
the violence last month that
claimed a total of 21 lives.
Little is known about Voronin's
committee, how many members it
has or even who they are. But one

thing is clear: they have the ear of
some officials in the Soviet gov
ernment.
In early December, the group
demanded that Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev impose a state
of emergency, suspend parlia
ments, and call in the Soviet army
to stop what it said was the disin
tegration of the Soviet Union.
Last week, Voronin and other
committee members confidently
took their cause directly to KGB
chief Vladimir Kryuchkov. He
reportedly voiced his support for
Gorbachev, but even getting
access to the KGB leader, a figure
still feared by many Soviets, was a
coup for the group.
