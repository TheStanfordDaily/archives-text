# U.N. supplies sent to Iraqis

UNITED NATIONS (AP) - U.N. agencies will
send emergency medical supplies to Iraqi children
and their mothers as early as next week, officials
said yesterday.
The decision follows Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar's meeting Monday with James
Grant, the director of UNICEF, to assess the needs
of Iraq, which claims dire requirements for emer
gency relief.
The Security Council also met briefly in private
and decided to convene next week for private discus
sion of the Gulf War.
U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani said the
United Nations decided to send a joint World Health
Organization-UNICEF mission to Iraq to deliver
emergency medical supplies "to assist in the care of
children and mothers and ascertain essential health
needs."
"It is hoped that the mission could arrive in Bagh
dad by the end of next week," he said. Sources,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said the ship
ment is expected to include baby food.
Last week, Iraq requested that UNICEF and
World Health officials assess the need for emergency
aid.
Medicine and medical equipment are specifically
exempted from the Security Council's embargo on
Iraq. The United Nations categorizes food for
infants younger than 6 months old as medicinal.
But the Security Council's sanctions committee
must approve any other shipments of food to Iraq or
occupied Kuwait, which are allowed only "to relieve
human suffering."
Diplomats say the shipments will probably go
overland from Iran, but final arrangements have not
been made. Iranian officials have suggested the Ira
nian Red Crescent society and the International
Committee of the Red Cross supervise any aid.
Giuliani said that a joint WHO-UNICEF team
would accompany all supplies into Iraq.
The United Nations has yet to contact the allied
coalition bombing Iraq to ensure that the convoys of
medicines and infant formula will not be attacked,
diplomats said.
The anti-Iraq coalition has been attacking Iraqi
supply routes — including highways — while stress
ing it does not intentionally target vehicles unrelated
to the war effort.
Diplomats said the Security Council debate would
be held in private at the urging of the majority of the
council members, led by the United States, Britain,
Soviet Union and France.
Cuba and Yemen — two council members that
have voted against several gulf council resolutions —
have tried for two weeks to open a public debate on
the Gulf war.
