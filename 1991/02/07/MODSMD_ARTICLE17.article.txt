South African sanctions
seem to be working and
should be maintained

Last Friday, south Afri
can President F.W. de Klerk
went farther than many
expected in dismantling key foun
dations of South Africa's racist
apartheid system.
His actions deserve kind words
and encouragement from the inter
national community — but noth
ing more. The world must continue
to pressure South Africa through
the use of economic sanctions until
the process of reform is complete.
De Klerk and his country face a
grim future. With the African
National Congress and Inkatha
now forming a unified black
stance, and a conservative party
that is moving even farther to the
right, there may be no way to avoid
a bloody civil war. Such a war
might result in permanent removal
of the apartheid system, but the
high cost in human life — a cost
that would be borne predomi :
nantly by the black population —
makes this an alternative to avoid
at all costs.
In his difficult struggle for
peaceful reform, President de
Klerk faces a situation ominously
like the one faced by Soviet Presi
dent Mikhail Gorbachev. The
South African leader is losing sup
port from white factions, and has
never had any real support from
the blacks. As he tries to strike a
balance between reform and stabil
ity, de Klerk is finding his power
base crumbling underneath him.
This makes it even more impor
tant for the United States — and
for Stanford — to remain firm on
its policy of sanctions. If South
Africa is shown that it cannot
freely conduct international trade

until the process of reform is com
plete, de Klerk and other moderate
whites will have a strong argu
ment, and significant incentive, for
further action. There is already
great domestic pressure in South
Africa to halt reform at current
levels, or even to clamp down and
reverse the process. A lifting of
sanctions, even partially, might
encourage such reaction.
Some opponents of apartheid
believe that if some sanctions are
not removed now, South African
whites will become frustrated with
the lack of international encour
agement and decide to turn their
backs on the international commu
nity altogether. While this is a pos
sible scenario, isolationism seems
an unlikely response by such an
advanced industrialized country.
The international community
could offer token encouragements,
such as lifting the prohibition on
South African participation in
international sporting events.
Such economically insignificant
but symbolically powerful changes
would reward and give prestige to
moderate reformers for their
progress.
At what point should sanctions
be dropped? Ideally, not until a new
constitution guarantees "one per
son, one vote" for all of South
Africa. In practice, the United
States has substantially lower
standards, such as the commence
ment of "good faith negotiations"
with black representatives. Stan
ford's policy of divestment "until
apartheid has ended" from all
South African companies that do
not actively oppose apartheid also
falls short of this ideal.
President de Klerk has made a
significant if symbolic move
toward dismantling South Africa's
oppressive and racist regime. To
encourage further and more sub
stantive reform, the United States
and Stanford must persist in main
taining sanctions.
