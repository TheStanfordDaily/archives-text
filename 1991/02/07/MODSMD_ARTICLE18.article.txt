## Living in Israel is a daily confrontation with fear 
### 
I AM SURE YOU ARE FOLLOWING
the news closely, but here is a more
personal report of what's happening
in Israel, from an insider's point of view.
Overall, the situation in Israel is not
as bad as it may sound. It's true, we
have had some casualties and some prop
erty damage, but I feel that it could have
been worse.
The real problems are mental and
psychological.
The most worrisome part is that there
is no clear and quick solution to the mis
sile problem. It's been almost three
weeks since the war started and Saddam
Hussein managed to launch nine missile
attacks on Israel. The Washington Post
reported a few days ago that the damage
to the Iraqi launchers is not as great as
the officials report. Sitting here and lis
tening to such news makes us feel really
uncomfortable.
The sad part is the life routine that
people in Israel have adopted. We go
home as soon as it gets dark, around
5:00 or 6:00 p.m. We eat supper, maybe
take a quick shower and get ready for
the evening. The television and the radio
are on all the time, both for updates and
to hear the siren.

We have a national news show at 9
p.m. Three of the last four attacks took
place during this news show, around 9:30
p.m. Every night we sit there, watching
the news and waiting. We hear the siren,
run into the room and seal the door, put
on the gas masks and listen to the radio,
praying it's not our home the missile will
hit this time, praying for the Patriot mis
sile to do its job.
It takes about two minutes from the
time the alarm is sounded until the mis
siles fall. If we pass the first two to three
minutes safely, we know we are safe for
the night. The concern then is for our
family and friends. We start calling peo
ple like crazy to make sure everyone is
OK.
We continue to contact our friends
and relatives until the next signal is
given, this one to tell us we are safe. All
this time we are closely following the
radio for reports of where the missile hit
this time and how many casualties there
are. Once the attack is over, we know we
can relax for the night and most of the
people simply go to bed. It's like waiting
for a show and going to sleep once it's
over.
Last Wednesday a friend, Oded, came
to my house for a visit. We sat and

missile problem.

watched the news and got ready to run
into the sealed-off room, but the siren
didn't come. That night there was no
attack, and Oded had a dilemma: Should
he go back home? When?
You don't want to get caught in your
car during a missile attack. You should
see the empty streets of Tel Aviv and
Haifa once it gets dark. It's really sad.
I am not sure how long it will take to
resolve the problem; I hope not too long.
It is hard to describe the fear, especially
of the kids of all ages, as well as the men
tal damage. You can see it everywhere.
The small children are kept at home,
which keeps some of the women out of
work.
We are worried all the time of what's
going to happen where and when. This
uncertainty is the hardest part.
The general feeling of being bombed

with missiles is pretty bad, even for us,
the "tough Israelis." It's probably hard
est for the men, who are used to going to
the front during a war and fighting. Now
they just sit at home doing nothing, lis
tening to the news, unable to participate
or to help. It can drive you ntots to sit
there, waiting and guessing where and
when the next one will hit.
During the second missile attack to
the north of the country, where I live, I
was at home, in the sealed room with my
gas mask on. The siren went on about
two minutes before I heard this strong
noise, which later turned out to be the
launch of the Patriots. I could hear the
whistle and after a few seconds, the
blast. Sitting in this room I didn't know
what was happening: Did a Scud fall
near by? Is it conventional or chemical?
Where was it? Lots of questions, no
answers, and quite a bit of fear.
The only damage that my family has
had are a few broken windows at my par
ents' home, caused by one of the Scuds
hitting a house just two blocks away.
But again, the property damage is the
"easy" part. The fear is what's hard.
