# Saying 'rape survivor' empowers the victims of assault
## 
### 
I FOUND TIM MARKLEIN'S Feb. 4
column, "Waging War on Words,"
incisive in its attack on many insidi
ous euphemisms; however, I feel that he
incorrectly targeted the phrase "rape
survivor" as an inappropriate term.
Part of rape's pernicious nature is
that it removes a woman's control over
her body. Rape brings a woman's world
crashing down around her. Nothing is
safe anymore; all of the personal precau
tions that she may have taken were
insufficient to prevent the crime.

All of her mental constructions, her
means of convincing herself that she is
safe, are destroyed in a violent, hateful
act of domination that violates her most
personal space and frequently threatens
her life. A survivor of rape will never be
free of that crime; it will stay with her
for the rest of her life, and she may think
of it every single day.
As a rape crisis counselor (with the
Mid-Peninsula YWCA Rape Crisis Cen
ter), I have spoken with rape "victims,"
as Marklein insists that they should be

called. Emphasizing that a woman is a
victim does nothing to help her regain
control over her life.
Using the term "rape survivor" is a
reminder that the woman in question
has survived; the crime is behind her,
and no matter how long the road ahead
is, she can be empowered by the fact that
she lived through an attack during which
she was unable to determine what hap
pened to her body.
Returning control to the survivors, as

we call them now and will continue to
call them, is the first step to locating
other strengths and resources.
Calling a woman a rape survivor in no
way implies her guilt or lessens the
blame of the rapist. It refocuses the
attention onto the most important per
son in the rape dynamic: the woman who
is reconstructing her life. This terminol
ogy encourages women to cease being
victims and to become survivors.
