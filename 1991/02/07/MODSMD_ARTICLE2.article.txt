Centennial Celebration officials yesterday
approved the Council of Presidents' plan for a "Cen
tennial Culture Fest" to be held spring quarter dur
ing Prospective Freshman Week.
During the festival, which will take place April 19,
food booths and other displays representing different
cultures will line the Inner Quad. Organizers said
they hope to simulate a street fair and create an
informal, picnic-like atmosphere.
"It will give a snapshot of Stanford, one that
brings all the diversity here together in one place at
one time," said COP member Goodwin Liu.
Stephen Peeps, director of the Centennial Cele
bration and associate vice president of public affairs,
agreed.
"The centennial year is meant to capture and
commemorate Stanford at this point in its history,"
Peeps said. "We couldn't think of anything better to
capture it than our multicultural diversity."
The decision puts the program "squarely on the
map as a big event," Liu said.
Various campus groups, including dormitories,
ethnic community centers and academic depart
ments, will be asked to participate. Theme houses —
such as Ujamaa, Okada, Haus Mitteleuropa and the
French House — will also be invited to join the event.
The objective is "to celebrate diversity at Stanford
in a more inclusive way," said COP member Jamie
