# Diversity focus of Culture Fest
## 
### Peter Robison Staff Writer 
Centennial Celebration officials yesterday
approved the Council of Presidents' plan for a "Cen
tennial Culture Fest" to be held spring quarter dur
ing Prospective Freshman Week.
During the festival, which will take place April 19,
food booths and other displays representing different
cultures will line the Inner Quad. Organizers said
they hope to simulate a street fair and create an
informal, picnic-like atmosphere.
"It will give a snapshot of Stanford, one that
brings all the diversity here together in one place at
one time," said COP member Goodwin Liu.
Stephen Peeps, director of the Centennial Cele
bration and associate vice president of public affairs,
agreed.
"The centennial year is meant to capture and
commemorate Stanford at this point in its history,"
Peeps said. "We couldn't think of anything better to
capture it than our multicultural diversity."
The decision puts the program "squarely on the
map as a big event," Liu said.
Various campus groups, including dormitories,
ethnic community centers and academic depart
ments, will be asked to participate. Theme houses —
such as Ujamaa, Okada, Haus Mitteleuropa and the
French House — will also be invited to join the event.
The objective is "to celebrate diversity at Stanford
in a more inclusive way," said COP member Jamie
Green. "Some people have been
concerned that the 'big four' (eth
nic communities) have been repre
sented too much" in programs cel
ebrating multiculturalism.
The festival will also provide "a
way for students to get involved in
the Centennial celebration,"
Green added.
Liu and Green said they are not
sure whether The Fire Within will

also be held this year. That COP
sponsored event, which features
performances by the four commu
nities of color, was postponed ear
lier this year. It had previously
been held during Freshmen Ori
entation Week.
It's up to the four communities
to put on the show, Green said.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Michael Jackson said he is "excit
ed" about the event. His office —
Campus Affairs — will fund
$2,500 of the $5,000 total cost of
the festival, with the Centennial
Celebration providing the rest.

"I hope students respond to it,"
Jackson said. "It's reaching out to
all different kinds of student
groups, from community centers
to academic theme dorms."

ASSU meeting about a U.S. News

associate.
