## Feeling out of place here 
### 
I PROBABLY DON'T NEED to point
out that Stanford is not like the inner
city. Some people say Stanford resem
bles a country club. I have never been to a
country club, but I suppose that if I ever
did see one from the inside, it would prob
ably look a lot like Stanford.
I experienced severe culture shock
when I first came here. I am an inner city
Chicana from East Los Angeles. If you
know anything about the inner city and
anything about Stanford, I expect that
you can figure out why the disparity
between East Los Angeles and Stanford
put me in shock.
People often ask me what East Los
Angeles is really like. I don't know what
to say because there isn't much that I can
compare it to. There are drugs and gangs
there, though not as many as people say.
It is economically depressed. And it is
about 99.9% Latino, mostly Chicano.
People speak Spanish and English
there. They listen to Mexican music. Life
moves at a different pace. It is not like the
rest of Los Angeles and Southern Califor
nia. It is definitely not like Stanford.
The thing I found most startling when
I came here was how few people were like
me. It is not that I cannot deal with it —
in fact I am a great believer in multicul
turalism.
My problem with Stanford diversity is
that there really isn't much diversity at
all. We have a wide assortment of stu
dents of color; the numbers are quite
impressive. Eight percent are Chicanas
and Chicanos. But there are almost no
students of color from the inner city.
The inner city has the largest and most

varied population of Chicanos in the
Southwest. The population of Chicanos at
Stanford is not at all representative of
this demographic and cultural reality.
The inner city is of critical social and cul
tural importance to people of color.
I won't idealize it. Inner city life has
many problems. But it is a place where
our culture and language take on
dynamic qualities as they seek to survive
the adversity that threatens and chal
lenges the community. A new cultural
resiliency arises from the inner city, a
mixture of traditional and urban. The
inner city also creates a strong sense of
ethnicity and belonging.
I was raised with tough kids — intimi
dating and scared at the same time. They
spoke with thick accents that I didn't
even notice until I had been away at Stan
ford for two years.
We wanted to be street smart, but not
intellectual, and most of all, we wanted to
know the jargon — all the words that I
can't print and those that I won't trans
late. We all had a tremendous sense of
attachment to our community, our fami
lies and our roots. Stanford isn't like this.
I've been here for three-and-a-half
years and it gets easier. I've learned to
adapt. But I still feel out of place.
During Christmas break of my junior
year, I drove home with a friend. He was a
sophomore fjom the Pomona area, who
embodied the essence of what I consid
ered to be Chicano. Although from
Pomona and not East Los Angeles, he
reminded me of all things Chicano: his
features, his clothes, his jargon and the
music that he played all the way down

Interstate Highway 5. We became friends
last year because we had so much in com
mon.
Unfortunately, I couldn't drive back up
with him. He transferred back to a Los
Angeles school.
If Mario had been happy here I am
sure he would have stayed. But he wasn't.
He never quite fit in. Fraternity parties
didn't quite do it for him, and he had
never been inside a country club either.
At home I realized he would be happy
there: His face glowed when we reached
the San Bernardino area and a friend
waved at him from the back of his truck.
"That's my homey!" he exclaimed.
It's said that Stanford is not for every
one. I wonder why not. Most of the Chi
canas and Chicanos I grew up with were
like Mario. But Stanford can't accommo
date people like Mario yet, and it accom
modates me only marginally.
Stanford says that it wants racial
diversity. I have a feeling that it wants the
same sort of student to come in different
colors. Like Barbie dolls do. So much for
diversity.
