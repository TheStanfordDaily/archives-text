## Lollie leads Card on key road trip 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
Hometown hero Marcus Lollie
came back to Seattle last January,
and oh, what a homecoming it
was.
Lollie, then a freshman on his
first conference road trip for Stan
ford, was returning to the town
where he'd led Chief Sealth High
School to the AA state basketball
title a year before. Now, he was
back to play the Washington
Huskies — in front of his family,
in front of former teachers, in
front of his friends.
They'd all come to watch the
man who'd been student body
president — the man who'd
scored with six seconds to play in
the 1989 state title game to send it
into overtime. This was some
thing big: After all, it's not every

day someone gets to go to Stan
ford.
And so, with the Cardinal trail
ing the Huskies on that Thursday
night in Seattle, Stanford coach
Mike Montgomery sent Lollie into
the game. The freshman ran on
the floor, got the ball to set up the
Stanford offense.. ..
.. and I think I traveled the
first time I got the ball," Lollie
laughs. Ouch. "I was excited to be
playing at home and everything,
but I was pretty nervous. I think 1
was more nervous then than I was
in my first college game."
So who wouldn't be? Lollie
eventually calmed down — "I
played all right," he remembers.
"I had a pretty good game" — but
it wasn't enough to help the Car
dinal, which lost 71-59 to the
Huskies.
That loss was Stanford's 11th

in its last 12 tries at Hec Edmund
son Pavilion, and that's a trend
the Cardinal will try to forget as it
travels north this weekend to take
on both Washington and Washing
ton State. The road trip is the
team's first since losing senior for
ward Andrew Vlahov and, if the
Cardinal is going to beat both
WSU tonight and Washington on
Sunday, it's going to have to be
extremely focused: Stanford has
swept in Washington only once
since 1978.
"We have to do the little
things," Lollie says. "We've got to
work together as a team: We have
to make the extra pass, look for
the open man, (and) we've got to
have the continuity we had when
Andrew was here.
"We've got to chase down loose
balls, because we don't have
Andrew to do that. We have to
work even harder on defense
because Andrew's not here. . . .
We still feel pretty good about our
future as far as this season's con
cerned. We know we can still
accomplish our goals; it's just
going to be a little bit harder."
That means a little more pres
sure for everyone, including Lol
lie, who's been Stanford's first
guard off the bench for most of
the season. Coming in for starting
point guard John Patrick, Lollie is
averaging 4.2 points and 3.7
assists per game.
The dish average is second to
Patrick's 4.3 per game, but
Patrick plays almost eight min
utes more each contest than Lol
lie. (If you really want to be tech
nical, then, Lollie gets an assist
every 4.95 minutes, Patrick every
6.12.) Lollie's assist-to-turnover
ratio (59 to 31) is also the best on
the squad.
All of this comes after last
year's finish, when Lollie played

19 minutes per game over the last
third of the season as the spark
plug that ignited the Stanford fast
break. He turned the ball over
only eight times in the season's
last eight games, scored a career
high 16 against Cal in the Pacific
10 Conference Tournament and
was voted the team's Most Inspi
rational Player. Things must be
going well, right?
At times, yes. At others. ... "I
think I've been a little inconsis
tent," Lollie says. "I'm still not
doing the things I'm capable of
doing. . . . Sometimes I just make
stupid decisions, and I think after
ward 'Why'd I do that?' I need to
do that before, so it doesn't hap
pen.
"[Marcus] hasn't had as good a
year coming off last year as I'd
hoped," Montgomery agrees.
"He's had some games when I did
think he played pretty well —
early on he was playing really well
— but then he got hurt, was out
for three or four games and didn't
come back well at all."
Those four games came at the
start of the season, when Lollie
had to sit out two weeks with a
sprained ankle. Since then, he's
shown flashes of last year's excite
ment — 10 points and seven
assists at Oregon State, eight
points and eight assists against
WSU — but sometimes it's just
not there: two points, no assists
against Oregon, one point, one
dish at UCLA.
"Last year when we'd put him
he'd do everything that we needed
at the time," Montgomery says.
"This year that hasn't happened
as much. For some reason the
break hasn't been there at times,
but that's not necessarily because

After leaving Seattle as a high school legend, Marcus Lollie made
a less-than-trlumphant return when the Cardinal lost to Washington
last year. Lollie and the Cardinal travel to Washington State tonight
and meet the Huskies Saturday.
