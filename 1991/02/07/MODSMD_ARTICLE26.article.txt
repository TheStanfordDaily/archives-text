when Adam Keefe scored 26 points to lead the Cardinal in a 94-63 romp.
COUGAR UPDATE — The Cougars, who won only one conference game
all of last year, are (of course) tied with Oregon State for second right

two-block and a-partridge-in-a-pear-tree performance.... In the 86-75
win over Oregon, five players tied or bettered their career bests in 18(!)
