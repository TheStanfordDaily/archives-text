# Women worthy of watching
## 
### 
If you're a women's basketball fan, don't
bother reading this column. My message is
not meant for you, and your time could be
better spent reading my article about the two
exciting games that the Cardinal will be play
ing this weekend in Maples. Skip this.
Those of you that are still reading probably
belong to the group of sports fans on campus
that I want to address today: women's basket
ball detractors. The people that pack Maples to
see the men play, listen to every road game, and
claim to love college basketball — but who
won't even entertain the idea of following the
campus basketball team with the "Defending
National Champions" title in front of its name.

I know that you're out there. I've talked to
some of you. Not all of you will come right out
and admit what a recent KZSU sportscaster
did on his oft-silent call-in show. "I hate
women's basketball," this philosopher of the
airwaves declared.
But you exist, quietly watching ESPN to get
your fix, debating the relative merits of East
Tennessee State's point guard and whether or
not UNLV is the best college team ever. Decent,
upstanding citizens, most of you.
So why, in the name of Azzi, do you ignore
what is possibly the most exciting team Stan
ford has ever had? There is a dynasty of college
hoops being built in your own backyard, and
you ignore it. "Ignore," as in, "ignorance."
That's right. I'm not going to call you sexist,
although that may be a part of it. I think you
just refuse to acknowledge the facts, and hold
on to a traditional, media-enhanced fantasy:
that men's basketball is inherently better than
women's.
Let me say right here that I am not claiming
that the games are the same, or even similar.
Simple size differences make the game vastly
different. The women are less physical
(although not devoid of players who "mix it
up"), and do not have the dunk in their arse
nal. Stanford senior point guard Sonja Hen
ning said that the two shouldn't be compared,
because it would be comparing "two different
games." Coach Tara VanDerveer similarly
viewed the men's game as another world.
But different does not mean better.
Women's basketball, in many ways, is just as
exciting as the men's. Sometimes, it is more so.
Ask anyone up at Washington — they'll tell
you. Their women's team outdraws the men,
emphatically. When Stanford travels to Seattle,
it's bigger than the Arizona men's visit. Auto
matic sellout. A crowd so pumped it blows any
thing in Maples away, women or men.
This is sometimes considered a joke around
the league, but why? It's simple logic, and can
be explained in one word: success. The Husky
women made it to the Elite Eight last year, and
handed Stanford its only loss of the year in one
of the most exciting college basketball games
ever played — period. The Husky men? Uh,


David
Hirning
they didn't fare so well.
Yet, at Stanford, the lackluster
men's team still continues to out
draw the women, despite last
year's national championship.
Wasn't anybody watching last
year's phenomenal team? The
men couldn't win a game in the
NIT, while the women went 32-1,
dominated the West Regional on
their own floor, and then cleaned
up at the Final Four. A real Jour
ney to the Tourney, not a big
buildup and huge letdown.
But it seems that not even a
coveted national title can help the
situation. This year's team is
nearly as good, has been ranked
all year and is working on a 10-
game win streak. Yet the numbers
remain unchanged. Last Satur
day, the men played Oregon State
in the afternoon and draw 6,100.
That same evening, the women
took on No. 16 UNLV in a
matchup that could be a preview
of the West Regional. Only 3,762
came to see it.
At a campus where everyone
claims to be so enlightened, we
seem to be living in the Dark Ages
in terms of athletics. We've come a
long way since VanDerveer's play
ing days: she went to a high school
where there was no women's bas
ketball team, then went tolndiana
and started for three years. This
can't happen anymore, fortu
nately, because the game has
improved very rapidly as
resources have been allocated
more fairly.
The NCAA long ago passed
Title IX, which mandates that col
leges must have "comparable"
women's and men's athletic pro
grams. Gone are the days of
shoestring women's budgets
while the men spend thousands
on nice sweats. The women's
NCAA finals are on network TV
and ESPN picks up games occa
sionally.
But I continue to note the dis
parities everywhere, and not just
because I cover the team. But my
position allows me to constantly
note the differences. There are
thousands of ways in which the
women's game is slighted, start
ing with media coverage and
working down through booster
support and student interest.
I maintain that it doesn't have
to be this way, that this is simply

selective inattention that should
be changed. And it can start with
this newspaper, which has
"always" sent the men's writer to
all the away Pacific 10 Conference
games and had a second writer for
home games. It's time to start
some new "traditions."
I've heard the arguments. "I
want to see people do things I
can't do." Can you nail threes like
Julie Zeilstra and Molly Gooden
bour? Can you block shots like Val
Whiting? Post up like Trisha
Stevens?
I don't think so. If you could,
you'd be playing varsity, men's or
women's.
"I like the physical play." Then
go see a football game or, better
yet, professional wrestling. The
women's game is just basketball,
the way it was meant to be played.
Playmaking without punishing.
Setting picks without sending
someone to the hospital.
Rebounding without remaking
someone's facial structure.
Then there's, "There's not
nearly the aura of excitement
around women's basketball. I love
the men's game because of the
crowds, the media hype, the
excitement."
Here's one response, from
someone close to the game. "Our
game is just as exciting as the
men's," Sonja Henning said.
"We're more fundamentally
sound. We don't have some of the
strength and size, but we work on
execution."
Here's another: Why don't you
go to the f-ing game instead of
complaining about it. ESPN will
be here Saturday for a game
against Washington. No. 8 vs. No.
12. I went to the Arizona men's
game, and I know what kind of
atmosphere the students can cre
ate in Maples. Don't the defend
ing NCAA champions deserve the
same support in their biggest
home game of the year?
I agree that the women's game
doesn't have the aura of the men's
game here or on a national scale. I
just happen to think that this can
be changed. Here. Now.
One final thing. This year, the
women's West Regional is in Las
Vegas. The Final Four is in New
Orleans. If you are going to jump
on the bandwagon, wouldn't now
be a real good time?

David Hirning can't do anything
that anyone on the women's bas
ketball team can do, but he loves
to tell people about them anyway-

claim to love college basketball — but who
won't even entertain the idea of following the
campus basketball team with the "Defending
National Champions" title in front of its name.

I know that you're out there. I've talked to
some of you. Not all of you will come right out
and admit what a recent KZSU sportscaster
did on his oft-silent call-in show. "I hate
women's basketball," this philosopher of the
airwaves declared.
But you exist, quietly watching ESPN to get
your fix, debating the relative merits of East
Tennessee State's point guard and whether or
not UNLV is the best college team ever. Decent,
upstanding citizens, most of you.
So why, in the name of Azzi, do you ignore
what is possibly the most exciting team Stan
ford has ever had? There is a dynasty of college
hoops being built in your own backyard, and
you ignore it. "Ignore," as in, "ignorance."
That's right. I'm not going to call you sexist,
although that may be a part of it. I think you
just refuse to acknowledge the facts, and hold
on to a traditional, media-enhanced fantasy:
that men's basketball is inherently better than
women's.
Let me say right here that I am not claiming
that the games are the same, or even similar.
Simple size differences make the game vastly
different. The women are less physical
(although not devoid of players who "mix it
up"), and do not have the dunk in their arse
nal. Stanford senior point guard Sonja Hen
ning said that the two shouldn't be compared,
because it would be comparing "two different
games." Coach Tara VanDerveer similarly
viewed the men's game as another world.
But different does not mean better.
Women's basketball, in many ways, is just as
exciting as the men's. Sometimes, it is more so.
Ask anyone up at Washington — they'll tell
you. Their women's team outdraws the men,
emphatically. When Stanford travels to Seattle,
it's bigger than the Arizona men's visit. Auto
matic sellout. A crowd so pumped it blows any
thing in Maples away, women or men.
This is sometimes considered a joke around
the league, but why? It's simple logic, and can
be explained in one word: success. The Husky
women made it to the Elite Eight last year, and
handed Stanford its only loss of the year in one
of the most exciting college basketball games
ever played — period. The Husky men? Uh,


David
Hirning
they didn't fare so well.
Yet, at Stanford, the lackluster
men's team still continues to out
draw the women, despite last
year's national championship.
Wasn't anybody watching last
year's phenomenal team? The
men couldn't win a game in the
NIT, while the women went 32-1,
dominated the West Regional on
their own floor, and then cleaned
up at the Final Four. A real Jour
ney to the Tourney, not a big
buildup and huge letdown.
But it seems that not even a
coveted national title can help the
situation. This year's team is
nearly as good, has been ranked
all year and is working on a 10-
game win streak. Yet the numbers
remain unchanged. Last Satur
day, the men played Oregon State
in the afternoon and draw 6,100.
That same evening, the women
took on No. 16 UNLV in a
matchup that could be a preview
of the West Regional. Only 3,762
came to see it.
At a campus where everyone
claims to be so enlightened, we
seem to be living in the Dark Ages
in terms of athletics. We've come a
long way since VanDerveer's play
ing days: she went to a high school
where there was no women's bas
ketball team, then went tolndiana
and started for three years. This
can't happen anymore, fortu
nately, because the game has
improved very rapidly as
resources have been allocated
more fairly.
The NCAA long ago passed
Title IX, which mandates that col
leges must have "comparable"
women's and men's athletic pro
grams. Gone are the days of
shoestring women's budgets
while the men spend thousands
on nice sweats. The women's
NCAA finals are on network TV
and ESPN picks up games occa
sionally.
But I continue to note the dis
parities everywhere, and not just
because I cover the team. But my
position allows me to constantly
note the differences. There are
thousands of ways in which the
women's game is slighted, start
ing with media coverage and
working down through booster
support and student interest.
I maintain that it doesn't have
to be this way, that this is simply

selective inattention that should
be changed. And it can start with
this newspaper, which has
"always" sent the men's writer to
all the away Pacific 10 Conference
games and had a second writer for
home games. It's time to start
some new "traditions."
I've heard the arguments. "I
want to see people do things I
can't do." Can you nail threes like
Julie Zeilstra and Molly Gooden
bour? Can you block shots like Val
Whiting? Post up like Trisha
Stevens?
I don't think so. If you could,
you'd be playing varsity, men's or
women's.
"I like the physical play." Then
go see a football game or, better
yet, professional wrestling. The
women's game is just basketball,
the way it was meant to be played.
Playmaking without punishing.
Setting picks without sending
someone to the hospital.
Rebounding without remaking
someone's facial structure.
Then there's, "There's not
nearly the aura of excitement
around women's basketball. I love
the men's game because of the
crowds, the media hype, the
excitement."
Here's one response, from
someone close to the game. "Our
game is just as exciting as the
men's," Sonja Henning said.
"We're more fundamentally
sound. We don't have some of the
strength and size, but we work on
execution."
Here's another: Why don't you
go to the f-ing game instead of
complaining about it. ESPN will
be here Saturday for a game
against Washington. No. 8 vs. No.
12. I went to the Arizona men's
game, and I know what kind of
atmosphere the students can cre
ate in Maples. Don't the defend
ing NCAA champions deserve the
same support in their biggest
home game of the year?
I agree that the women's game
doesn't have the aura of the men's
game here or on a national scale. I
just happen to think that this can
be changed. Here. Now.
One final thing. This year, the
women's West Regional is in Las
Vegas. The Final Four is in New
Orleans. If you are going to jump
on the bandwagon, wouldn't now
be a real good time?

David Hirning can't do anything
that anyone on the women's bas
ketball team can do, but he loves
to tell people about them anyway-
If you're a women's basketball fan, don't
bother reading this column. My message is
not meant for you, and your time could be
better spent reading my article about the two
exciting games that the Cardinal will be play
ing this weekend in Maples. Skip this.
Those of you that are still reading probably
belong to the group of sports fans on campus
that I want to address today: women's basket
ball detractors. The people that pack Maples to
see the men play, listen to every road game, and
claim to love college basketball — but who
won't even entertain the idea of following the
