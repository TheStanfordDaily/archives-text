# Women worthy of watching
## 
### 
If you're a women's basketball fan, don't
bother reading this column. My message is
not meant for you, and your time could be
better spent reading my article about the two
exciting games that the Cardinal will be play
ing this weekend in Maples. Skip this.
Those of you that are still reading probably
belong to the group of sports fans on campus
that I want to address today: women's basket
ball detractors. The people that pack Maples to
see the men play, listen to every road game, and
claim to love college basketball — but who
won't even entertain the idea of following the
campus basketball team with the "Defending
National Champions" title in front of its name.

I know that you're out there. I've talked to
some of you. Not all of you will come right out
and admit what a recent KZSU sportscaster
did on his oft-silent call-in show. "I hate
women's basketball," this philosopher of the
airwaves declared.
But you exist, quietly watching ESPN to get
your fix, debating the relative merits of East
Tennessee State's point guard and whether or
not UNLV is the best college team ever. Decent,
upstanding citizens, most of you.
So why, in the name of Azzi, do you ignore
what is possibly the most exciting team Stan
ford has ever had? There is a dynasty of college
hoops being built in your own backyard, and
you ignore it. "Ignore," as in, "ignorance."
That's right. I'm not going to call you sexist,
although that may be a part of it. I think you
just refuse to acknowledge the facts, and hold
on to a traditional, media-enhanced fantasy:
that men's basketball is inherently better than
women's.
Let me say right here that I am not claiming
that the games are the same, or even similar.
Simple size differences make the game vastly
different. The women are less physical
(although not devoid of players who "mix it
up"), and do not have the dunk in their arse
nal. Stanford senior point guard Sonja Hen
ning said that the two shouldn't be compared,
because it would be comparing "two different
games." Coach Tara VanDerveer similarly
viewed the men's game as another world.
But different does not mean better.
Women's basketball, in many ways, is just as
exciting as the men's. Sometimes, it is more so.
Ask anyone up at Washington — they'll tell
you. Their women's team outdraws the men,
emphatically. When Stanford travels to Seattle,
it's bigger than the Arizona men's visit. Auto
matic sellout. A crowd so pumped it blows any
thing in Maples away, women or men.
This is sometimes considered a joke around
the league, but why? It's simple logic, and can
be explained in one word: success. The Husky
women made it to the Elite Eight last year, and
handed Stanford its only loss of the year in one
of the most exciting college basketball games
ever played — period. The Husky men? Uh,
