# Women's hoops meet former pushover WSU
## 
### David Hirning Senior staff writer 
Entering the second half of its league
schedule, the Cardinal women's basket
ball team sits atop the Pacific 10 Confer
ence with a perfect 9-0 record.
Yawn.
Sorry, it's just that after four consec
utive years of breezing through the first
half of the Pac-10 undefeated, Stanford
tends to get a little bored. Fortunately,
third-place Washington State and sec
ond-place Washington break up the dol
drums with a whirlwind tour of Maples
this weekend.
The two games may be the Cardinal's
biggest challenge left on its schedule,
indicating whether Stanford will falter
(as they did three years ago, losing three
in the second half) or establish total
dominance (two seasons ago, 18-0 in
league) heading into the NCAA tourna
ment.

Last year, of course, the Cardinal
came three points shy of back-to-back
perfect Pac-10 seasons when the
Huskies upset the No. 2 Cardinal in
Seattle. The teams eventually shared
the conference title with identical 17-1
marks. This year, however, it is not only
the Huskies that Stanford must focus
its attention on.
Washington State made that quite
clear last weekend when they took a
USC team that gave the Cardinal fits in
Maples and obliterated it at home, 74-
47. Phenom Lisa Leslie, who lit up the
Cardinal for 24 points and 20 rebounds,
managed just eight points and three
measly rebounds against the Cougs.
Washington State then claimed third
place for itself with a 78-77 win over
UCLA. The Cougars, 9-9 in the Pac-10 a
year ago, improved to 13-5 overall and 6-
3 in conference.
"So what?" you say. "We beat them
once already, right? Probably by 30 or

somethin'."
Try by six points, in a game where
Stanford trailed with as little as six min
utes remaining. In retrospect, that
game was Stanford's toughest in the
league so far, closer than USC or Wash
ington.
"That win looks better now, coach
Tara VanDerveer said. "When you look
at how well they (WSU) have been
doing, it shows how good they are.'
The Cougars are better than good,
now that they have their best player,
Angie Miller, back from an injury. Miller
is one of four Cougars who average dou
ble-figures in scoring.
"Miller is back, and she's very good,"
VanDerveer said. "They're a very bal
anced team."
VanDerveer hopes that her team will
respond with some balance of its own,
something that was lacking in the two
team's first meeting.
