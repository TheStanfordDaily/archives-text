# WAR IN THE GULF
## Jordan's king supports Iraq 
### 
AMMAN, Jordan (AP) — Dropping his neu
tral stand to side openly with Iraq in the Per
sian Gulf War, King Hussein has accused the
U.S.-led allies of seeking Iraq's destruction and
harboring postwar designs on the region.
In an emotional speech Wednesday night,
the Jordanian leader urged a cease-fire in the
war next door that has wrought hardship on
his people.
"This is a war against all Arabs and Mus
lims and not only against Iraq," said the king,
long a bulwark of pro-Western moderation in
the region.
His speech echoed the strong pro-Iraqi sen
timents of his 3.4 million subjects, many of
them Palestinians.
Before the war, Jordan professed neutrality
and purchased oil from Iraq, claiming it was
not violating the U.N. embargo.
For refusing to join the anti-Iraq coalition,
Saudi Arabia punished Jordan with a cutoff of
oil and aid — and banned most Jordanian
imports.
In recent days, Jordanian oil tank trucks
have been bombed and strafed by allied war-
planes as they headed for home on
Iraqi roads.
Hussein accused the allies of trying
to "deprive us of our basic needs" —
punishment for Jordanian attempts to
mediate a peaceful settlement to the
Persian Gulf crisis following Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait.
"The alternative to a cease-fire is
the destruction of Arabs and Muslims,
their humiliation, their exploitation,
the trampling of their honor, pride and
legitimate hopes," said Hussein.
In the United States, President
Bush instantly rejected the cease-fire

call. He reiterated that Saddam Hus
sein must first begin "a credible, uni
lateral withdrawal" from Kuwait.
But the sudden shift in tone, mir
roring the mood of the Jordanian peo
ple, was an ominous signal for allied
forces that Arab opinion is shifting in
favor of their Iraqi foe.
In the fourth week of war in the
Persian Gulf, the allied assault is still
being waged primarily from the skies.
Warplanes kept to their round-the
clock pace today, roaring off to unload
their bombs on Saddam Hussein's
forces, including dug-in ground troops
and their supply lines.

"From here, you can see the bomb
flashes at night," said a U.S. military
officer deployed near the wind-chilled
northern Saudi frontier. "This could
get very ugly at any moment."
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and
Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, were to leave
Washington tonight for the Gulf to get
a first-hand look at the readiness of
U.S. forces for a ground offensive.
Yesterday, Cheney and Powell
briefed members of Congress in a
closed-door meeting, and one key law
maker, House Minority Leader Robert
Michel, R-111., said afterward that

"there seems to be no rush" to a
ground war.
Secretary of State James Baker
painted perhaps the grimmest picture
yet by the Bush administration of
what a land battle would be like.
"Tough times lie ahead," he said.
"The task is formidable, and no one
should underestimate Saddam's mili
tary capabilities."
Baker, appearing before the House
Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday,
spoke soberly of "many casualties,
great hardships and growing fears for
the future."
