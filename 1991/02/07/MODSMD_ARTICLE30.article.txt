# Football grabs another top recruiting class
## 
### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
The 1991 football season has begun
— at least for Stanford's newest addi
tions. The Cardinal announced its lat
est recruiting class yesterday (signing
day), and third-year coach Denny
Green has nabbed one of the best in
the nation.
Highlighted by five consensus Ail-
Americans and two junior college All-
Americans, Stanford's incoming play
ers have been ranked the country's
15th best, giving the Cardinal its third
consecutive top-20 recruiting class.
"We're very pleased with our
recruits. We have another really good
class," Green said. "Some of these guys
are going to be household names in the
future."
Highlighting this list is All-Ameri
can quarterback Justin Armour, of
Manitou Springs, Colo. The 6-foot-6
versatile athlete was rated the fourth
best prep quarterback in the nation.

Playing in the unusual wing-T forma
tion, Armour showed his talent and
versatility by throwing for 2,103 yards
and 27 touchdowns while rushing for
1,320 and another 25 scores. He will
also play forward on the Cardinal bas
ketball team.
"Armour is a terrific football
player," Green elaborated. "He made
every All-America team, which rarely
happens. His strengths are his leader
ship abilities and his confidence on the
field."
Allen Gonzalez is the second all
everything prep who decided to join
the Cardinal yesterday. Choosing Stan
ford over Nebraska, Oklahoma and
Colorado, the defensive end from
Tulsa, Okla. will be a big boost to the
needy defensive line. The 6-4, 275-
pound (and growing) player is consid
ered one of the top five linemen in the
country.
"[Allen] is a great big strong guy
who has muscle to go up against the
big guys but is also quick," Green said.

"We're very excited he's coming out
here and is leaving Big 8 territory."
The other nationally renowned
players include quarterback Mark But
terfield, defensive end David Carder
and inside linebacker Dave Grable.
Butterfield, from Antioch, Calif, threw
for 1,562 yards and 13 touchdowns
this year. Carder was selected Ail-
American after collecting 78 tackles
and 10 sacks last season in Flagstaff,
Ariz., and Grable is considered the best
linebacker in the state of New York.
Cornerback Lenard Marcus is con
sidered the most likely to make an
immediate contribution to the Cardi
nal. The Baltimore, Md. native had 16
interceptions over his junior and
senior seasons, a record for Baltimore
Poly High, a school renowned for its
athletic programs. Another incoming
defensive demon is Damon Phillips
from nearby Hercules. The outside
linebacker is considered a sleeper
because he missed five games due to
injury, yet still recorded 78 tackles, five

sacks and caused three fumbles.
Two football celebrities' sons will be
suiting up for the Cardinal as well,
next season. Nathan Olsen, son of for
mer Ram Merlin Olsen — one of the
greatest linemen in NFL history —
will try to follow in his father's foot
steps. Washington Redskin's coach Joe
Gibbs' son Coy is another Cardinal-to
be.
Following in former Stanford coach
Bill Walsh's tradition, Green and staff
dipped into the junior college pool, and
came out with two JC Ail-Americans,
and five juco players overall. Ryan Wet
night, from Fresno City College,
should be able to fit right into the
scheme of things next season. The first
team All-American tight end caught 42
passes for 787 yards last season.
Although Stanford has traditionally
refrained from recruiting juco players,
Green feels there were enough of the
right guys with the right kind of
grades to make an impact on the pro
gram this year.
