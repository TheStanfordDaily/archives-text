# Women netters open play in Rolex Nationals
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
A team doesn't win five NCAA
Championships in as many years with
out talented individuals — a fact to
which the Stanford women's tennis
team will no doubt attest.
Beginning today in frigid Min
neapolis, four of those individuals will
get a chance to show their stuff at the
Rolex National Indoor Champi
onships, the third leg in the Intercolle
giate Tennis Coaches Association
Grand Slam.
The four-day event features 32 of
the nation's top singles players and 16
of its top doubles teams.
Senior Sandra Birch enters the sin
gles as the No. 1 seed and will meet
Florida's Holly Lloyd in first round
action. The Gator junior is ranked No.

50 on the computer.
Like Birch, Teri Whitlinger is also
seeded and meets Texas' Jackie Moe in
her opening match. Moe, a freshman
for the up-and-coming Longhorns, is
unranked. Heather Willens rounds out
the Stanford singles contingent. Wil
lens, ranked 15th, meets Kentucky
senior Melissa Nelson, the No. 10
player in the country.
Birch's path to the semifinals
appears to be easier than that of her
two teammates. Sixth-ranked Caryn
Moss of Georgia poses the most signif
icant obstacle in a theoretical quarter
final matchup. Last year, Birch
reached the semis but had to default
her match with eventual champion
Ginger Helgeson due to illness.
Whitlinger's draw is particularly
nasty. A win would probably set her up
to face Florida's Andrea Farley, a dom

inant baseliner. If she gets to the quar
ters, she may meet Duke sophomore
Julie Exum, the nation's most
improved player in 1991. Exum won
the DuPont Clay Court Champi
onships in the fall.
Willens' possible quarterfinal oppo
nent is Georgia serve-and-volley wiz
ard Shannan McCarthy.
In doubles, Whitlinger and fresh
man Laxmi Poruri lock up in a cere
bral dual against Harvard's Amy
deLone and Jamie Henikoff. Poruri
and Whitlinger are ranked No. 4 while
deLone and Henikoff are No. 10 on the
charts.
The Cardinal contingent would
have been a good deal stronger had
Debbie Graham been able to make the
trip. The defending NCAA singles
champion is ranked No. 2 in the coun
try and teams with Birch to form the

nation's best doubles tandem. Graham
has been ill and is suffering from a
shoulder ir\jury.
Card notes
The singles and doubles finals are both
Sunday afternoon. The most unusual
entrant in the tournament is Myriam
Berthe who attends Midland Junior Col
lege. She is from Senegal.
None of Stanford's men are competing
in the tournament. Jonathan Stark is
still nursing a stress fracture. He is ranked
No. 3 in singles and teams with Jared
Palmer to form the best doubles pair in
men's college tennis.
Joanna Plautz and Susan Gilchrist,
the defending Rolex doubles champs, could
meet Poruri and Whitlinger in the second
round. Gilchrist and Plautz beat Birch and
Graham, then the No. 1 seeds, in the first
round of the tournament laßt year.
