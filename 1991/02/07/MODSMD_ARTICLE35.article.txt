THE STANFORD DAILY'S EbBIWEEKLY

And then there was
light. . . . Two Stan
ford seniors rewrite
the story of creation
in "One Bad Apple/' a
musical comedy
which opens next
Thursday. God never
had so much fun.

Who is God?
What is God?
What is religion?
Was mankind created, or did it
evolve?
Is evil really evil, or is it just a
misunderstanding?
"One Bad Apple" is a serious,
thought-provoking play which
forces the audience to ...
What am I talking about?!!
"One Bad Apple" is a wild and
wacky — twisted, in fact — musi
cal comedy about creation where
Adam is a wimp and a whiner, Eve
is a fanatical feminist, God makes
mistakes, and the archangels play
pool.
"It's goofy, powerful, tragic and
light-hearted," said senior Randy
Smith, musical director:
"One Bad Apple," written by
seniors Debbie Wicks and Chris
LaPuma — as an honors project in
music composition — is at just the
stage it should be one week before
opening.
UTTER CONFUSION.
Let me give you an idea of how
confusing.
At the beginning of Monday's
rehearsal the pianist was in the
corner rehearsing with an actress
while 20-or-so cherubs gyrated in
opposite directions in the middle of
the room. Meanwhile, the snake
danced wildly across the back of
the hall.
But by the end of the night, the
scenes were running smoothly and
all of my doubts were gone.
"It started to click at the end of
rehearsal last night, but it really
came together tonight," director
Bob Florsheim said Monday
evening. "They could go on tomor
row and do an OK job, but in a
week it's going to be great. And
we've got a week-and-a-half," he
added with a sly smile.
That's a week-and-a-half to put
the finishing touches on an already
strong show. "One Bad Apple"
already has all it needs to be a top
notch musical — definite charac
ters played by a talented cast,
diverse music and even the requi
site RCS (Really Corny Scene).
All that's missing is an orphan




Bad Apple" over the summer at
Interlocken (National Music
Camp). They had Ben Evans sing
the part of the snake to test out the
lyrics and the music.
"Actually, we thought he'd end
up playing the snake, but when we
came back [to Stanford] he was bet
ter as Adam," LaPuma said.
Better as Adam? Evans is ter
rific. I can't imagine him playing
any other part than Adam. His
voice, mannerisms and even his
posture fit the character. Evans is
perfect in the role and has done a
wonderful job with it.
Besides, no one could possibly
play the snake as well as Bill
Grundy. Grundy is phenomenal.
His song, "Taste the Surprise," is
the favorite of both LaPuma and
Florsheim, and I can't help but
agree. I was awestruck by his per
formance, especially the dancing.
He is definitely one of the better
actors I've seen in a long while.
Actually, they all are. I can't

with red curly hair and a shaggy
dog.
But let's go back to the cast. —
the cast is great. Illana Zauderer,
who plays God, is fantastic, even
out of this world. She has a won
derful voice, she sings with
strength and her acting is superb.
You would almost think the part
was written for her
Holy coincidence, it practically
was.
"When I was writing the script, I
saw certain people playing the
parts. It wasn't pre-casting,
because I didn't tell anybody except
Debbie, but when they cast the
show they cast some of the people
I'd been imagining," LaPuma said.
(You got it, Zauderer was one of
them.)
Wicks and LaPuma wrote "One

remember the last time I've seen
an amateur production that was so
. . . so ...
Professional.
Florsheim noted that the actors
are aided in developing such strong
characters because it is an original
play. "Because no one's ever done
[this play] before, the roles aren't
established. The actors can exploit
their personal strengths and really
create the characters," he said.
But surely it takes more than
just an original script. It must
require talent as well.
"The cast is incredibly tal
ented," agreed Wicks. And she
should know. She's worked with
enough staffs during her three-and
a-half years at Stanford to be able
to judge the best.
And these very well could be the
best.
As for the aforementioned
"really corny scene" . . . well, it is
corny, but tolerable. The sappiness
of the two songs it involves, "Look

For the Inner Light," and "You're
the Only One For Me" is out
weighed by the talent of the cast,
especially John Peters's humorous
portrayal of the archangel Gabriel.
"John makes Gabriel's charac
ter. He makes it so much more
humorous than I ever thought it
would be. I originally wrote Gabriel
as a real nerd, sort of a brown
noser in a way, but now he's funny.
It's hard to imagine anyone else
playing the part but him," LaPuma
said.
"John is Goofy personified,"
Florsheim said. "I knew John was
the one for the part and we would
just have to change the song," he
said, explaining that the song was
transposed into Peters's vocal
range.
As for changes, "Look For the
Inner Light" is just one of many. In
fact, the whole tone of the play has
changed.
"Originally, Chris and I had all
these wild ideas. We wanted to

open it with the golden cherubs tap
dancing in the dark and have God
come out and say, 'let there be
light' and flip on all the stage
lights," said Wicks.
"We were going to change a well
known story in a fun way. But now,
there's so much more than a silly
musical there," she added.
Wicks and LaPuma made a lot
of changes before they turned the
script over to the cast. "First of all,
it was kind-of hard to say 'OK, here
you go. Here's the script, now
interpret it as you want it,' but I'm
very happy with the cast and staff,"
said LaPuma.
From the other side, having the

playwrights on campus was both
good and bad. "I feel a bit like a
pawn to Debbie and Chris, but at
the same time it's great whenever
I'm 'iffy' on how to work a scene to
be able to take it to them," Flor
sheim said.
Everything, though, has turned
out just fine.
"It's really exciting to see my
words spoken by other people, to
see the play become three dimen
sional," LaPuma said.
"It's going to be better than
'Evita'!" said Florsheim, sliding a
tape of the production into his car
stereo.
