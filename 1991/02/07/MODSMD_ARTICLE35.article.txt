THE STANFORD DAILY'S EbBIWEEKLY

And then there was
light. . . . Two Stan
ford seniors rewrite
the story of creation
in "One Bad Apple/' a
musical comedy
which opens next
Thursday. God never
had so much fun.

Who is God?
What is God?
What is religion?
Was mankind created, or did it
evolve?
Is evil really evil, or is it just a
misunderstanding?
"One Bad Apple" is a serious,
thought-provoking play which
forces the audience to ...
What am I talking about?!!
"One Bad Apple" is a wild and
wacky — twisted, in fact — musi
cal comedy about creation where
Adam is a wimp and a whiner, Eve
is a fanatical feminist, God makes
mistakes, and the archangels play
pool.
"It's goofy, powerful, tragic and
light-hearted," said senior Randy
Smith, musical director:
"One Bad Apple," written by
seniors Debbie Wicks and Chris
LaPuma — as an honors project in
music composition — is at just the
stage it should be one week before
opening.
UTTER CONFUSION.
Let me give you an idea of how
confusing.
At the beginning of Monday's
rehearsal the pianist was in the
corner rehearsing with an actress
while 20-or-so cherubs gyrated in
opposite directions in the middle of
the room. Meanwhile, the snake
danced wildly across the back of
the hall.
But by the end of the night, the
scenes were running smoothly and
all of my doubts were gone.
"It started to click at the end of
rehearsal last night, but it really
came together tonight," director
Bob Florsheim said Monday
evening. "They could go on tomor
row and do an OK job, but in a
week it's going to be great. And
we've got a week-and-a-half," he
added with a sly smile.
That's a week-and-a-half to put
the finishing touches on an already
strong show. "One Bad Apple"
already has all it needs to be a top
notch musical — definite charac
ters played by a talented cast,
diverse music and even the requi
site RCS (Really Corny Scene).
All that's missing is an orphan
