# The 						Weighting Game: Chris Harris is bigger than BIG
## 
### 
... I lay on the floor of the Alpha Delt
(oops, The Enchanted Broccoli Forest)
house in despair — and worse, in de' beer
— watching all the big guys talking with
Michelle, The Woman I Like. Who was I
fooling? After two hours of squeezing
through the crowds, sucking in my gut and
ignoring the beer running down my neck, I
knew I would walk home alone again.
If I could ever get unstuck from this
floor.
"Help!" I cried. "I'm drunk and I can't
hook up!"
... I sat in silence at Flicks, watching
"Ghost" for the fifth time ("Hev, is that
Rogosa on the subway?"). Pa trick Swayze
can't act. But he's a Brobdingnagian (big)
sort of fellow ("Look, kids! A humor col
umn and SAT primer in one!"). Thus, he
gets the perfect girl. Big guys get all the best
women. It's a rule.
OK, there's Ric Ocasek. And Billy Joel.
But these are exceptions. Walking
out of Memorial Auditorium, only two
thoughts are running through my head.
First, there's no way that they play Righ
teous Brothers in Heaven. Second, it's
about time that I got big.

That's right, BIG. Then all my prob
lems will be solved. It worked every Friday
evening for Bill Bixby> it'll work for me. I
don't just wanna be big, but BIG. I mean
big big. I wanna be as big as a Delt. No, as
big as three Delts. But I'm not even as big
as a Tft-Dclt now.
I'm tired of being the weak, silent type.
I wanna be awe-inspiring, not "Aw . ..
inspiring. I wanna walk around with my
arms sticking out like a Christ figure. I
wanna swing my whole upper body when I
move. I wanna learn how to grunt, wear
my baseball cap backwards, spit on side
walks and smell like a wet dog.
I wanna be big. We're talking
Schwarzenegger-big. Hell, Schwarzeneg
ger's-ego-big. I mean, Africa-big. Deficit
big. That-ball- of-twine-in-Kansas-big. Big
big big big big. All I need to do is be big, and
I know that My TVue Like Michelle will fall
at my feet.
If only I had a "Zoltar" machine.
"'Editor's Note: In The Daily's never
ending crusade against stereotypical des
ignations, we regret the following por
trayal of a big person named "Lunk." We
would like to stress that, unlike this article

suggests, not all people of bigness have
monosyllabic, self- descriptive names.
So I visit my big friend Lunk to ask how
one goes about becoming big.
"Thu wught ruum," he replies.
"The weight room? Is it worth it?"
"Wurthut?!" He looks shocked. "Thu
last time Uh wus thure, Uh did thurty
curls!"
Wowzers, I think, that is worth it. Then
I slap myself. Curls, you fool! He said
curls!.
An hour before dinner, I stand tri
umphantly at the entrance to Encina Gym.
I smile at the attendant and flash my new,
self— laminating Stanford ID. With the
rhythm of old Village People anthems

spurring me on, I take a deep breath, hold
my nose, and step inside.
Ah, it's all here. Bicycles for the legs. ..
. Dumbbells for the biceps.... Barbells for
the dumbbells.. .. Mirrors for the ego. Yes,
it's all here. ...
. . . and so is half the campus.
The bigger half, I assume.
No problem. Keep calm. I try not to
notice that I'm about 300 pounas lighter
than the next smallest person here. I begin
stretching, and repeat to myself all die
benefits of working out. Health, self
esteem, babes. Health, self esteem, babes.
Stretch. Bend. Squeeze. TWist. My life is
a song: Pulling Muscles for Michelle.
Squeeze, again.
"'Editor s note: Remember, all you dear,
wonderful, handsome, intelligent, big
readers, we are morally opposed to the
bad, bad, nasty stereotypes that follow.
Pleasepleaseplease don't hurt us. QHRIS
HARRIS is the person you want.
My big friend Lunk lumbers up to me,
bringing a bunch of his friends.
"Hey, Chrus. Uh'd like you to meet suh
muhmuh frunds." He introduces each one:
"Buff, Gus, Hulk, Scud, Lug and Dumb."

I smile back, and try to make big talk for
a while: "So, are you in a fraternity?" I ask
Lug. Four second pause. He nods. "Let me
guess: Theta Dolts, right?" Longer pause. I
use his mental processing time to slip into
the crowd.
TWenty minutes later, a half hour into
my "workout," I've done half a bench press
(the first half, that is: lowenng the barbell),
one excruciating set of two pull-ups, and
made six trips to the water fountain. Oth
erwise, I haven't been able to squirm my
way onto a piece of equipment.
Frustrated, I sit down on a nearby stool
— the closest I'd ever get to benching 160
pounds.
It isn't wurthut, after all. There's not
enough use in being big. Or maybe there's
too many u's. Rationalization sets in: After
all, I've got plenty to offer Michelle that
those others can't. A visible chin. A mov
able neck. A, E, I, and O.

Chris Harris is a Junior majoring in
International Relations. That "Theta
Dolt" bit was a typo. No, really, guys, I
mean it. Ouch! Stop!...

wanna swing my whole upper body when I
move. I wanna learn how to grunt, wear
my baseball cap backwards, spit on side
walks and smell like a wet dog.
I wanna be big. We're talking
Schwarzenegger-big. Hell, Schwarzeneg
ger's-ego-big. I mean, Africa-big. Deficit
big. That-ball- of-twine-in-Kansas-big. Big
big big big big. All I need to do is be big, and
I know that My TVue Like Michelle will fall
at my feet.
If only I had a "Zoltar" machine.

"Thu wught ruum," he replies.
"The weight room? Is it worth it?"

I slap myself. Curls, you fool! He said
curls!.

my nose, and step inside.
Ah, it's all here. Bicycles for the legs. ..
. Dumbbells for the biceps.... Barbells for
the dumbbells.. .. Mirrors for the ego. Yes,
it's all here. ...
. . . and so is half the campus.
The bigger half, I assume.
No problem. Keep calm. I try not to
notice that I'm about 300 pounas lighter
than the next smallest person here. I begin
stretching, and repeat to myself all die
benefits of working out. Health, self
esteem, babes. Health, self esteem, babes.
Stretch. Bend. Squeeze. TWist. My life is
a song: Pulling Muscles for Michelle.
Squeeze, again.

Lug. Four second pause. He nods. "Let me

use his mental processing time to slip into
the crowd.

my "workout," I've done half a bench press

enough use in being big. Or maybe there's

Thank

... I lay on the floor of the Alpha Delt
(oops, The Enchanted Broccoli Forest)
house in despair — and worse, in de' beer
— watching all the big guys talking with
Michelle, The Woman I Like. Who was I
fooling? After two hours of squeezing
through the crowds, sucking in my gut and
ignoring the beer running down my neck, I
knew I would walk home alone again.
If I could ever get unstuck from this
floor.
"Help!" I cried. "I'm drunk and I can't
hook up!"
... I sat in silence at Flicks, watching
"Ghost" for the fifth time ("Hev, is that
Rogosa on the subway?"). Pa trick Swayze
can't act. But he's a Brobdingnagian (big)
sort of fellow ("Look, kids! A humor col
umn and SAT primer in one!"). Thus, he
gets the perfect girl. Big guys get all the best
women. It's a rule.
OK, there's Ric Ocasek. And Billy Joel.
But these are exceptions. Walking
out of Memorial Auditorium, only two
thoughts are running through my head.
First, there's no way that they play Righ
teous Brothers in Heaven. Second, it's
about time that I got big.

That's right, BIG. Then all my prob
lems will be solved. It worked every Friday
evening for Bill Bixby> it'll work for me. I
don't just wanna be big, but BIG. I mean
big big. I wanna be as big as a Delt. No, as
big as three Delts. But I'm not even as big
as a Tft-Dclt now.
I'm tired of being the weak, silent type.
I wanna be awe-inspiring, not "Aw . ..
inspiring. I wanna walk around with my
arms sticking out like a Christ figure. I
wanna swing my whole upper body when I
move. I wanna learn how to grunt, wear
my baseball cap backwards, spit on side
walks and smell like a wet dog.
I wanna be big. We're talking
