# From The Editors
## 
### 
Formerly, this box was dedicated to the objective reporting of
entertainment news. However, with the new regime of Daily
editors in power, we are nixing this idea.
No longer will we write under the pretext of objectivity — pur
porting to supply empirical data on what's "Hip, Hot and Hap
penin."'
No way.
From now on, we (June and Mara, Intermission Editor and Man
aging Editor, respectively, if not respectfully) will simply tell you
what we would do, if we had all the time in the world to spend just
entertaining ourselves. (As if working at The Daily wasn't enter
tainment enough.)
You'll be seeing a lot of changes in Intermission over the next
few weeks — we're trying to incorporate a lot more creativity and
plain old goofiness. Hopefully (fingers crossed, keep that caffeine
coming), most of them will be in place by next week.
Note the facelift we gave the cover and our brand new feature —
the Intermission Interview.
Plus, the legendary Joel Stein and Chris Harris will alternate in
filling the much coveted position of cover columnist (the "new
Andrew Berkowitzes", so to speak).
We are also looking for more creative (or sick — no, especially
sick) minds to work on Intermission, so if you think you fit either
of those categories come to our Intermission staff meeting/brain
storming session on Sunday at 1 p.m. Don't be intimidated by our
sarcasm — we won't bite unless you ask.
AND NOW . . . the entertainment picks of the week:
Tonight, for a change of pace, we would head over to the Adelfa
Lounge right after dinner (6:30 p.m.) for a poetry reading by Carl
Djerassi.
Oh, take that anti-intellectual sneer off your face, stop saying
"dude" for just one minute and consider the fact that Djerassi is not
only the author of "Cantor's Dilemma," but the inventor of the
birth control pill as well. Something the least literary among us can
appreciate.
On Friday, we'd hit Singing for Freedom, an "A Cappella" con
cert benefiting Amnesty International.The concert is at 8 p.m. in
Kresge Auditorium and costs a mere $3. All proceeds benefit pris
oners of conscience who were jailed solely for peaceful expression
of their political beliefs. And if you're lucky, you might even get to
hear Jeanette Davidson (of Mixed Company fame) sing "Blackbird."
Go Jeanette!
Nuff said.
On Sunday, we'd hop in the car and drive to the City (we hate
capitalizing that, since we all know New York is the only real City)
to catch the Cannes International Advertising Festival. I know,
the title doesn't immediately reel you in, but it actually sounds
really neat. (Excellent use of vocabulary, huh?)
The festival is a compilation of the "most innovative, entertain
ing, original and effective commercials from around the world"
(according to the press release, which by the way, was written in a
very lovely font).
Anyhow, the film will be shown Saturday through Monday at the
Castro Theater, on Castro Street near Market in San Francisco. Call
751-3129 for details.
Finally, next Wednesday, we'd go to see the Stanford University
Singers perform music and poetry in celebration of Valentines Day
— at 8 p.m. in Campbell Recital Hall.
Whatever you do, have an entertaining week. And remember,
our advice to you is not to question why or whither, just enjoy your
ice cream while it's on your plate.*
