# The
						Many Faces of Illana Zauderer
## 
### Martha Brockenbrough 
I liana Zauderer has been eating One Bad Apple. If
she had the time, she would probably sleep and
breathe it, too. Somehow, the concept of "one
days rest" doesn't appear to have caught up with
this 19-year old music mtyor.
Zauderer is playing God in the original musical
"One Bad Apple," composed and written by seniors
Debbie Wicks and Chris La Puma.
As God, however, Zauderer is not immune to the
temptations of her creativity. The sophomore sings
with Everyday People and the Stanford Chorale. She
will soon be playing the witch in "Into the Woods."
And she is taking 19 units.
To her credit, the fruit that has tempted her
seems to be agreeing with her quite nicely.
She has found mentors in her adviser, Prof.
William Ramsey, and her voice instructor, Judith
Fatina.
Zauderer has found friends in the a cappella and
theater circles at Stanford.
And she has found a career in the performing
arts. While Zauderer may never fulfill her high
school dream of becoming an ambassador, Shirley
Temple Black seems to have made the transition
from theater to politics quite well. (Others have,
well, made the transition.)
Intermission caught up with Zauderer in her hour
of rest last Sunday.
Intermission: Did you come to Stanford intending
to be an actress?
Zauderer: When I came here I wasn't really sure
that music was going to be anything more than a
hobby. So I really didn't care how [the program] was
going to be handled. Because I hadn't had a lot of
training before I came here [the Drama Department]
has been really helpful to me.
I: How does Stanford help or hinder people in the
arts?
Z: The department and the a cappella communities
are such networks that you see a lot of the same peo
ple. And even if you don't meet all the new people
you know you're going to run into them sometime. It
creates a really comfortable atmosphere for some
thing like theater, where you have to be comfortable
with everyone.
I: What are you planning on doing when you gradu
ate?
Z: I have no idea what's going to happen [in my stage
career]. I'm not sure I want to go to New York right
away. I think I want to go to London. Theater has a
different sort of feeling for everyone there.
I: Are you scared that you may not be successful?
Z: I'm very scared about what's going to happen.
When you find something you really like doing, you
ask yourself, "Why do anything else?" [The uncer
tainty] is really scary.

I: What first drew you to the stage?
Z: My first role was as an Oompa Looma in "Willy
Wonka's Chocolate Factory." I wore a blue pom-pom
on my head, and I was six. [Acting] started taking up
more of my time when I started doing summer
shows, which were rehearsing in the evening for five
hours every day ... I kind of realized that it was
going to happen when I was younger and looked up
and said, "That could be you one day."
I: What has been your favorite show so far?

Z: Last summer I played Anita in "West Side Story."
I sort of wanted to emulate Rita Moreno who . . . had
the role of Anita in the movie. But it's easy to break
into your own personality when you interact with
the other actors. It's your own personal interplay
with some of them.
I: Do you feel trapped into playing that sort of role?
Z: The director [of "West Side Story"] said I'm going
to be stereotyped into [strong] roles for a while. I
don't know why. That's what he decided, I guess.

He'd probably laugh if he knew I was playing God.
I: How does it feel to play both God and a witch?
Z: It's weird. I haven't gotten to compare [the roles]
so much because "Into the Woods" rehearsals
haven't started. Knowing [the script of "Into the
Woods"] the roles are really different, but at the
same time I'm wondering if the experiences are
going to be very similar because both characters are
so strong. Looking at it from the outside, it's pretty
ironic.

Once you've played
God, where can you go
from there? Ironically,
Zauderer's next role
will be the witch in 'Into
the Woods.'

I: Is it strange being a woman playing God?
Z: It's not strange at all. Contrary to what people
might think before seeing "One Bad Apple," it's not
a feminist statement, really... . The show isn't based
on the fact that God is a woman. Once I started
working on it, I sort of forgot about it.
I: What will this show mean to the audience?
Z: I think they're going to be surprised at the
amount of talent there is in both the cast and the
staff. . . . It's probably also going to surprise every
body that, during a time when there isn't usually a
show going on, that so many people got together and
spent so much time making this thing a huge, explo
sive success. I hope it's going to be [successful]. I'm
pretty sure it is. When you think about how much
time people have spent on this, you hope it will all
pay off and be a great success.
I: What is your favorite part about it all?
Z: The people, of course. Everyone would say that. .
. . And there's the one or two moments right before
you go on stage. The nervousness is just so vile. It's
really scary, but it's really nice knowing there's a
large audience of people who really don't know what
to expect at all. So it's up to me and the rest of the
cast to show them what we feel like showing them.
It's really neat.
