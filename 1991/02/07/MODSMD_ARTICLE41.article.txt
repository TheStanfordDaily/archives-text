# Ballet season opens with a lot of fluff and a few gems
## 
### Leah Edwards 
On Wednesday, Jan. 30. the San
Francisco Ballet kicked off its 58th
season with a gala billed as "A
Classical Celebration."
Most of the one-time-only per
formance consisted of sugary sweet
choreography and costumes per
fectly suited to the champagne and
dessert party which followed in the
Opera House. However, there were
some stunning exceptions.
For one, there was the pas de
deux from "New Sleep," with a
clangy electronic score and sleek
black costumes. Muriel Maffre's
sinuous flexibility and Christopher
Boatwright's powerful leaps and
turns make this a work worth see
ing many times over. Fortunately,
"New Sleep" is the one work from
the' opening program that will be
performed during the rest of the
season.
The other gem at the gala was
the pas de deux from "Paquita,"
performed by Evelyn Cisneros and
Nicolaj Hiibbe. Cisneros was as
regal as ever — in full control of
each step, making the dance look
so effortless. On leave from the
Royal Danish Ballet, Hiibbe will be

with the San Francisco Ballet all
season. A superb dancer with high
leaps and dramatic flair, Hiibbe is
alone reason enough to go to the
ballet — more specifically, the San
Francisco Ballet — this year.
But there are other reasons as
well.
Under Helgi Tbmasson's direc
tion, the company has steadily
worked towards its goal of being
considered a national (versus a
regional) company, lb be consid
ered national caliber, a company
has to be able to do the standard
full-length ballets and also have
flawless technique, lb fulfill the
first criterion, the San Francisco
Ballet can point to last year's
highly acclaimed production of
"Sleeping Beauty" (which will be
repeated this season).
And Anna Kisselgoff, a reviewer
for The New York Times, provides
testimony for the company's suc
cess in providing the second
requirement. She says,"The
national status that is within the
San Francisco Ballet's reach today
is based on ... a new brilliance in
technique and style, which in turn
inspires a new repertory of sub
stance."

The Ballet has seven repertory
programs this year, the first of
which opened Ttiesday and will be
repeated Friday evening and during
the Sunday matinee. The program
includes the complete work of New
Sleep along with the San Francisco
premiere of another modern ballet,
"Tagore," and an old stand-by of
the San Francisco Ballet, "Varia
tion's de Ballet."
Tonight is the opening of the
second program, which is basically
a show of reruns. Fortunately, the
works represent some of the best
pieces of the last few seasons,
including "Dreams of Harmony"
which premiered in 1987.
Throughout the season, one of
the seven programs will be per
formed each Hiesday through Sun
day — with two shows on Saturday
and Sunday — through May sth.
Student subscriptions are still
available at 50 percent off regular
price (for certain seats). However, if
you can't plan ahead and want to
buy individual tickets, you can still
get a good deal. Anyone can buy
the Ballet's Dance Pass which is
good for six tickets for the price of
five. For more information, call
