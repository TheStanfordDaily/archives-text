Not Without My Daughter
Sally Field, Alfred Molina, Sheila Rosenthal
Grade: B
In modern-day Iran, women are literally owned by
their husbands. They have no power, no say in any
thing. They are separated from society by veils and
laws that keep them silent. They are, in effect, slaves.
Worse than slaves.
If that's hard to conceptualize, imagine how diffi
cult it must be to experience. "Not Without My
Daughter" is the true story of an American housewife
who is forced to do just that.
Sally Field is Betty Mahmoody, an ordinary subur
ban housewife who reluctantly agrees to accompany
her Iranian husband to his homeland, and is gradual
ly forced to succumb to the drastically conservative
behavior required of women. In effect, she is an Amer
ican woman held hostage by her own husband in a
country completely foreign to her.
Alfred Molina plays Betty's husband, the insecure
man who tricks her into believing their trip is a vaca
tion, a trip to visit relatives. However, there is no end
to this "vacation," and the longer Betty stays in Iran,
the smaller her chances of ever leaving become.
Any woman is automatically considered an Iranian
citizen if she marries an Iranian, and as Betty's hus
band becomes more and more fanatical, he treats her
the way women "deserve" to be treated â€” by Iranian
standards. Betty is not permitted to use the phone or
leave the house unaccompanied. She must cover her
face and body at all times, and must remain separate
from men.

Betty Mahmoody is an ordi
nary suburban housewife
held hostage by her own hus
band in a country completely
foreign to her.

Though her chances look bleak, Betty vows to
return to the United States, and her daughter, played
by Sheila Rosenthal, becomes the pawn in her struggle
to escape. Betty will leave, but not alone.
Not without her daughter.
Set in a devoutly religious and often militant set
ting, "Not Without My Daughter" reminds us of our
own freedom. There are still women in Iran, like
Betty, who are "coerced," through violence and subor
dination, to stay with their husbands.
The script is well-written, the characters are strong
and Fields and Molina portray the conflict almost
flawlessly. However, the film fails to create a sus
tained sense of suspense and seems much longer than
it has to be.
Nonetheless, it is well worth seeing, if for no other
reason than to show you just how lucky you are to be
here, and not there.
