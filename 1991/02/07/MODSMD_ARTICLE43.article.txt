The Field
Tom Berenger, Richard Harris,
Sean Bean
Grade: A
If it's a light hearted, pull-at
your-heartstrings romance
you're looking for, "The Field" is
not for you. But, if you're in the
market for something a little
deeper, this film could be it.
Director Jim Sheridan (My
Left Foot) tells the intense tale of
the relationship between a man
and his country. Richard Harris
is Bull McAbe, a gritty Irishman
fighting for his land. When an
American (Tbm Berenger) threat
ens Bull's claim, a battle ensues.
Harris makes it poignantly clear
how deep the passion a man
feels for his hard-earned land can
be. For Bull, the law of the land is
"stronger than the common
law," and is placed before reli
gion, family and even human
life.
Tadgh McAbe, played by Sean
Bean, is Bull's alienated son.
The generational ties to the land

'The Field'
embodies an
entire nationality
of people, Irish
men, struggling to
hold on to what is
rightfully theirs.

that span across history have
been heaped upon him by his
father. As Tadgh has no remem
brance of the familial sacrifice
involved in obtaining the terri
tory, he has no emotional stake
in retaining it. It is he who suf
fers most from his father's
obsessive desire to retain the five
acres of his homeland.
Bird O'Donnel (John Hurt) is
Bull's toothless lackey who looks
out for Tadgh in return for food

scraps and pints of ale. At times
he provides comic relief by way
of his joker-like appearance and
slurred Irish brogue, but don't
expect any belly aches from
laughter.
The general mood of the film
is somber. Tragically somber.
But, in the best of all possible
ways. You'll leave the theater
feeling that no matter how bad
things get in your life, they can
never reach these monumental
heights of tragedy.
Mental anguish takes on a
new meaning in the"The Field"
as it embodies an entire nation
ality of people, Irishmen, strug
gling to hold on to what is right
fully theirs. Though it's depress
ing, and at times the dialogue is
very difficult to decipher through
the thick Irish accents, the film
is richly textured both visually
and thematically. It's definitely
worth the thought-provoked
melancholy that lingers upon
leaving the theater.
