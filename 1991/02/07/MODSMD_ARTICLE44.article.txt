# Student's night of gambling leads to a 'run' for his life

Run
Patrick Dempsey
Grade: C+
When I told a friend of mine that I had seen "Run,"
he asked me if I liked Akira Kurosawa. I responded
that I had just seen "Run" not "Ran."
"Run." "Ran." Same difference, right?
Well, I think that I can say with a fair amount of
certainty that the two films have very little in com
mon. As far as I can recall, there are not a great num
ber of samurai in "Run," nor are there many allusions
to "King Lear."
However, for my non-reimbursable six dollars I did
get to see Patrick Dempsey beaten repeatedly.
Bonus!
Normally I would not derive so much fulfillment
from the brutality of one individual against another
(cough cough), but the fact that Dempsey is a dead
ringer for my roommate from freshman year eased my
conscience.
Dempsey plays Charlie Farrow, a smart-ass law
student whose problems begin when his car breaks
down on his way to Atlantic City.
Jersey! Thumbs up.
So, with his car in a state of inertia, Charlie hails a
cab that runs him by a mob-run casino. After a run of
good luck in a poker game, Charlie decides to fold
them, instead of hold them. As he tries to run out the
door, he becomes involved in a fight with a gentleman
who would probably best be classified a sore loser.
Well, as fate would have it, and Alfred Hitchcock

has done it, Chuck's sparring partner runs his head
into a marble counter. At that time, Chuckie makes
the philosophical discovery that:
1 cracked skull = 1 dead man.
So, like any sensible college student, Chuck waits
around to suggest that the manager of the illegal gam
bling establishment dial 911 (that's 9-911 for those of
us who have the University phone system) to report
the accidental beating to death of the local mob king
pin's son. When Chuck finally comes to the conclu
sion that he is running out of options, he runs for the
door.
At that point in time, Chuck is officially on the
run, thus reinforcing the producers' choice of a one
word imperative sentence for the title of their film.
Obviously, they envisioned this film as the first in a
series of thematic sequels: "Walk." "Duck." "Hide."
"Jump." "Dart." "Bolt."
The best thing that "Run" has going for it is its
relentless, hyperactive energy. Director Geoff Bur
rowes has done a good job of quickly hooking the
viewer. Once you are sucked in by the film, the fairly
exciting action goes a long way — though not all the
way — towards covering the flat dialogue and gaping
plot holes.
The entire movie is a series of standard scenes,
most of them rehashed from previous films. Yet, the
sheer enthusiasm of the film keeps them interesting.
Occasionally, Charlie even finds a clever, but realis
tic, means of escape. Which is more than what I
would have expected from my roommate.

Patrick Dempsey crouches, sizing up his situation and ready to bolt, in the energetic, even hyperactive
film "Run." Dempsey plays a law student who is forced by circumstance into life-threatening situations
— and finds himself pursued by angry Mob members, bent on revenge.
