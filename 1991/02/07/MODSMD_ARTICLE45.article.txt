An Arab with a love of dishwashing
and a lew with a foot fetish meet as dou
bles partners at a retirement home in
Florida. After the game, they decide to
open up a Middle Eastern restaurant
together across from the United Nations
building. Unlikely, yes, but Tom Robbins
successfully spins a tale including many
cities, but really about only one:
Jerusalem.
Back up. Start from the beginning.
"Skinny Legs and All" doesn't begin
with the Arab or the lew. It begins in
Colonial Pines, Virginia with newlyweds
Ellen Cherry Charles and Boomer Pet
way. The complex storyline that evolves

wraps around a bizarre cast of characters,
including a Baptist preacher, a Puerto
Rican doorman/songwriter, a student
nurse/bellydancer and several inanimate
objects.
The plot is skillfully woven; every
thing falls into place as the characters
move inexorably toward their common
destinies. The book's actual action could
be set forth more succinctly, but, as with
Robbins' five other books, getting there is
much more than half the fun.
Robbins' prose alternates between
insightful commentary on the human
condition and just plain goofiness. One
character, correcting itself after mistak
enly calculating the chronological dis
tance between two events before the birth
of Christ (itself because he/she is a can of
beans of indeterminate gender), states:
"That's ninety years, not a hundred

and ten. This backward counting gets
confusing. But think what it must have
been like for the folks who were around
when Baby Jesus was born. They'd been
counting backward all their lives, their
ancestors counted backward as far back
as anyone could remember, and, scheech,
all of a sudden they woke up one morn
ing and had to start counting in the oppo
site direction. I tell you, that switch from
B.C. to A.D. must have driven people
nuts. I bet more than a few Israelites
missed their dental appointments."
"Skinny Legs and All" is timely in that
it deals with Middle Eastern strife, and
timeless because that conflict is nothing
new, a point well made. Robbins deals
lightly with the conflict surrounding
Palestine/Israel, and never preaches or
offers solutions. What the book does dis
cuss is overcoming differences and work
ing together.
