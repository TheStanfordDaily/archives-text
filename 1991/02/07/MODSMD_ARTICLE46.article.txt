A mere four pages into Thomas Pynchon's
"Vineland," Zoyd Wheeler, an old ex-hippie in a
magenta and acid green dress, walks into what
was a typical loggers' bar in Northern California
and finds himself face to face with a man wear
ing:
"... a Turnball and Asser shirt in some pas
tel plaid, three-figure-price-tag jeans by Mme.
Gris and aprds-logging shoes of a subdued but
incontestably blue suede."
Zoyd, though slightly taken aback by this
startling yuppification, produces a tailor-made
lady's chain saw with the name "Cheryl"
inscribed in rhinestones on the handle, and yells
belligerently for the press.
Zoyd turns out to be one of the more subdued
and predictable people in Pynchon's fourth
novel. Other characters include federal drug
agent and Tubal-Detox escapee Hector Zuniga,
a Ninjette named D.L., the dreaded narc Brock
Vond, a Karmic readjustment specialist named
Takeshi, 14-year-old mall expert Prairie Wheel
er and, at the focus of everyone's obsessions, the
beautiful Frenesi Gates, radical 1960s filmmak
er turned FBI informant.
Those familiar with "V"and "Gravity's Rain
bow" will find Pynchon's latest a bit easier to
wade through and no less rewarding. The story
careens through the '60s and the '80s as the
author takes potshots at our (not quite hopeless)
idealism in the face of mortality and the
omnipresent, dehumanizing (but not quite suc
cessful) System.
Pynchon himself remains a mystery. One leg
end has it — and legend is almost all anyone has
— that in the late 19305, a Cornell engineering
student took a course in modem fiction from
Nabokov and disappeared shortly after gradua
tion. Manuscripts have been surfacing in a lock
er in Grand Central Station ever since.
Some herald Pynchon as the voice of the late
20th century. His voice seems to fall somewhere
between J.D. Salinger, Douglas Adams and a
modern-day Charles Dickcns gone slightly mad.
But what makes "Vineland" is Pynchon's rau
cous, irreverent, irrepressible imagination. His
rollicking style hovers between hilarity and a
deadly frustrated seriousness:
"(She left] Tex on foot among the still-bound
ing echoes of their encounter, which had
brought tourist helicopters nudging in for a clos
er look, distracted ordinary mules on the trail
below into quick shuffle-ball-changes along the
rim of Eternity, proceeded through a sunset that
was the closest we get to seeing God's jaundiced
and bloodshot eyeball, looking back at us with
out much enthusiasm."
A bit heavy-handed, perhaps. Yet Pynchon
can, and does, pull it off.
