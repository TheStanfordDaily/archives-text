Odd and disturbing is the best
way to characterize Peter Straub's
"Houses Without Doors," a short
story collection from the author of
"Ghost Story," "Floating Dragon,"
"Koko," "Shadowland" and"The
Talisman."
Straub has been called "the
thinking man's Stephen King" (the
two writers collaborated on "The
Talisman") for his elevated lan
guage and use of extended descrip
tion and metaphor. Actually,
Straub plots poorly, compared with
his more popular contemporary,
and while the stories in "Houses
Without Doors" are certainly
upsetting, there is very little tradi
tional horror here.
The book is comprised of six
long pieces, each separated by a
short vignette, similar in construc
tion to Hemingway's "In Our
Time" or, more recently, Jayne
Anne Phillips' "Black Tickets." In
fact, Straub attempts to cover some
of the same territory as Phillips —
"The Juniper Tree" is even set in a
run-down movie theater, as is the
title story of "Black Tickets" —

including childhood molestations,
hallucinatory experiences and
loneliness. "Houses Without
Doors" does not contain any pleas
ant stories, and is not a book to
read while depressed.
The most striking story in the
collection is "A Short Guide to the
City," a travelogue with a very
uneasy tone. The story is a descrip
tion of an imaginary Midwestern
town, mottled with bizarre ele
ments of distortion and violence. It
is very reminiscent of a work by
novelist J.G. Ballard, in which fea
tures of the built landscape are
wrecked hulks, all seeming to pos
sess a symbolism that lurks just
below the surface. This story is one
of the best surrealist pieces to be
published since Ballard's "Day of
Creation."
Other strong stories are "Blue
Rose" — about a boy who hypno
tizes his younger brother into hav
ing a fatal epileptic fit — and"The

Buffalo Hunter." "The Juniper
"free" is the most upsetting piece in
the book, its graphic descriptions
of a young boy's molestation by an
older man in a darkened movie the
ater and the hallucinatory effect
this has on the boy are not the stuff
of which light reading is made. The
language in all the stories, however,
is poetic in a dark and powerful
way.
The short vignettes, surpris
ingly, are less poetic, and rarely
achieve a solid effect. They seem to
be merely filler, and since the book
is over 350 pages long, unneces
sary filler at that.
In "Houses Without Doors,"
Straub does not attain the furious
pace and terror he reached in
"Floating Dragon," nor the intel
lectually satisfying updating of a
classic genre of "Ghost Story," but
he does craft several powerful sto
ries. The book is worth reading for
"A Short Guide to the City" alone.
