Oh, the Places You'll Go!
By Dr. Seuss
Random House, $12.95, 42 pages
This latest book by Cat-in-the-Hat guru
Theodor Geisel (a.k.a. Dr. Seuss) has now been
on the bestseller lists for nearly a year, and not
without reason. "Oh, the Places You'll Go!" is a
delightful ode to personal initiative, a guide to
weathering life's rainstorms without melting.
With his characteristic whimsical rhymes
and colorful illustrations, Seuss urges readers to
take control of their lives:
You have brains in your head;
You have feet in your shoes.
You can steer yourself
any direction you choose.
Though Seuss is nominally a children's
author, the message in this book is equally appli
cable to grown-ups, and may be best appreciated
by those who have more experience with life's
ups and downs than the average three-year-old.
The Little Prince
By Antoine de Saint-Exupdry
translated by Katherine Woods
Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich, $3.95, 112 pages
This classic children's story, now almost 50
years old, recounts the adventures of the little
prince from asteroid 8612. In the African desert,
the prince befriends a pilot whose plane has bro
ken and left him stranded.
The boy recounts to the pilot his adventures
on other planets, inhabited by adults who, in dif
ferent ways, are entirely self-absorbed. One man
is drunk, another vain, expecting the little prince
to admire and praise him.
Yet another is a businessman who spends all
his time counting and adding numbers of stars,
which he claims to possess. Upon questioning,
the businessman affirms that he possesses the
stars in order to be rich, so if someone discovers
more stars he can buy them.
Saint-Exupdry beautifully demonstrates the
folly of sorcalled serious adults, and at the same
time he tells a story of friendship, loyalty and
responsibility. The little prince and the pilot
develop a strong bond and though they are sepa
rated in the end, the author puts to rest the
cliche, "Better to have loved and lost than never
to have loved." He shows that love is never a los
ing proposition.
