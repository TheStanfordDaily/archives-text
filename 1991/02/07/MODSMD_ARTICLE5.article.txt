# Church to give free wedding in raffle
## 
### Paul Yee 
To help raise funds for repair
ing Memorial Church, a Stanford
religious group is offering a once
in-a-lifetime deal â€” a $2 wedding
in Memorial Church.
The group, the Catholic Com
munity at Stanford, is holding a
Valentine's Day raffle to help col
lect the restoration money. The
owner of the winning ticket will
receive a free wedding in the
church after repairs are com
pleted, said Rev. Russell Roide,
who leads the group.
The raffle proceeds will add to a
larger, ongoing University fund
raising effort for the quake-dam
aged church. Dean of Memorial
Church Robert Gregg said recon
struction will commence as soon
as $8 million out of the needed
$10 million is raised. If repairs
begin as scheduled this April, the

church will be able to reopen in
October 1992, he added.
Gregg said the Memorial
Church fund-raising committee,
headed by trustee Melvin Lane, is
aggressively seeking donations to
meet the goal. About $6.8 million
have been collected so far, mostly
from large gifts, including more
than $2 million from Stanford
graduate William Hewlett, Gregg
said.
However, possibilities for
reaching the $8 million minimum
still look grim to Gregg. "It's look
ing tense. We need some help," he
said.
Roide said the University also
plans to ask couples who were
married in Memorial Church to
donate money. He estimated that
3,000 people have had their wed
dings in the church.
