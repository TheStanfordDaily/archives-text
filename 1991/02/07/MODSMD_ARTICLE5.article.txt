# Church to give free wedding in raffle
## 
### Paul Yee 
To help raise funds for repair
ing Memorial Church, a Stanford
religious group is offering a once
in-a-lifetime deal — a $2 wedding
in Memorial Church.
The group, the Catholic Com
munity at Stanford, is holding a
Valentine's Day raffle to help col
lect the restoration money. The
owner of the winning ticket will
receive a free wedding in the
church after repairs are com
pleted, said Rev. Russell Roide,
who leads the group.
The raffle proceeds will add to a
larger, ongoing University fund
raising effort for the quake-dam
aged church. Dean of Memorial
Church Robert Gregg said recon
struction will commence as soon
as $8 million out of the needed
$10 million is raised. If repairs
begin as scheduled this April, the

church will be able to reopen in
October 1992, he added.
Gregg said the Memorial
Church fund-raising committee,
headed by trustee Melvin Lane, is
aggressively seeking donations to
meet the goal. About $6.8 million
have been collected so far, mostly
from large gifts, including more
than $2 million from Stanford
graduate William Hewlett, Gregg
said.
However, possibilities for
reaching the $8 million minimum
still look grim to Gregg. "It's look
ing tense. We need some help," he
said.
Roide said the University also
plans to ask couples who were
married in Memorial Church to
donate money. He estimated that
3,000 people have had their wed
dings in the church.
A chief organizer of the raffle,
Roide said he hopes it will raise at
least $5,000.
Roide said the overall Catholic
community has a duty to help out
in the fund raising drive. Before
the Earthquake of 198*9, two
Catholic masses were held each
Sunday in Memorial Church.
"We feel indebted to Memorial
Church for the service it has given
to us over the years. We feel we

should play a part in helping to
repair such a beautiful center
piece on campus," he said.
The winning package is worth
about $1,000, Roide said. It
includes use of the church, organ,
sound system, wedding coordina
tor and church minister. The wed
ding may take place anytime after
the church is reopened, he said.
"This is the ideal way to get
students involved, either by sell
ing or purchasing tickets. Every
one's a contributor to the Memo
rial Church fund," according to
junior Monica Gonzalez, student

coordinator of the religious group.
About 800 students and 200
faculty members belong to the
Catholic Community at Stanford
The second prize includes a
dinner for two at Carpaccio's
restaurant in Menlo Park and two
tickets to the Ram's Head produc
tion, "One Bad Apple." The third
prize winner will receive breakfast
for two at Hobee's restaurant.
Tickets are on sale in White
Plaza from 11 to 1 p.m. until next
Thursday. The winner will be cho
sen Feb. 14 at 10:30 p.m. in front
of Memorial Church.
