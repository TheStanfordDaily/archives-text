# New comic series will work magic on you

Imagine you were a 12-year
old boy offered the chance to
become one of the most powerful
sorcerers in history — if you were
willing to pay the price.
That's the position Timothy
Hunter finds himself in, in the
new DC mini-series, "The Books
of Magic," a comic I avoided for a
while because of its protagonist.
Typically, a comic written by a 35-
year-old for 20-year-olds about
10-year-olds loses something in
the translation.
But despite the youth of its
star, the comic has plenty to
appeal to older buyers.
For one thing, it features a
script by Neil Gaiman, probably

the most talented storyteller cur
rently working on a continuing
series. He manages to craft a
multi-faceted child character who
isn't snotty or hypersensitive,
boring or phony.
Four magicians with various
styles and skills join together to
give Tim enough information to
make an educated decision about
his destiny. My personal favorite,

The Books of Magic' features a script by Neil
Gaiman, probably the most talented story
teller currently working on a continuing
series. He manages to craft a multi-faceted
child character.

John Constantine, introduces
Tim to Earth's leading practition
ers of magic, while the three oth
ers show him what magic has
meant elsewhere in time and
space.
Meanwhile, the trench coat
wearing conjurers must protect
Tim from evil magicians who
want to ensure that he doesn't
become the modern equivalent of

Merlin.
"The Books of Magic" balances
the serious and humorous aspects
of Tim's quest for knowledge into
a coherent and enjoyable whole.
Constantine, a wise-cracking
British magician, plays off the
straightforwardness of his three
companions remarkably well.
Beyond Gaiman's plot, the
series also features different
artists to capture each leg of
Tim's journey. So far, the art has
been stunning, with rich colors
and an epic scope. DC's "Prestige
Format" also augments the
impressive graphics.
All in all, "The Books of Magic"
promises to be one of the more
interesting comics to come our
way in quite a while. It's defi
nitely worth a look.
