# Indirect cost rate drops two more points to 70
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
The Navy knocked another
two points off Stanford's provi
sional indirect cost rate yester
day, bringing the figure down
to 70 percent.
This latest reduction means
Stanford's rate — at least for
the time being — is eight
points less than what the Uni
versity had originally planned.
Each one-point drop translates
into about a $1.25 million loss
in revenue for the University
as a whole.
The reduction, the second in
less than two months, is a by
product of ongoing negotia
tions between the University
and the Office of Naval

Research. Until the contro
versy surrounding Stanford's
indirect cost policies is
resolved, the Navy has imposed
a provisional rate on Stanford
to? protect the government's
interests.
If the rate remains at 70
percent for the remainder of
the year, the University will
take in $10 million less in indi
rect cost recovery than it origi
nally expected.
Indirect cost recovery is the
second largest revenue source
of income in the University's
operating budget, accounting
for nearly 30 percent of Stan
ford's funds. Only tuition con
tributes more.
Stanford originally proposed a rate of 78 per
cent for this year to the government, but because
an agreement could not be reached, a provisional
rate of 74 percent was imposed in the fall, when
several investigations of the University's policies
began.
The four-point drop and several other factors
prompted the University to cut $8 million from
this year's operating budget. Budget-planners
have not yet indicated whether the latest drop
will make further cutbacks necessary.
The rate dropped another two points in
December, after the Navy sent in a negotiating
team to address many of the concerns raised by
Paul Biddle, the campus representative of the
Office of Naval Research.
Based on audit findings that questioned some
of Stanford's charges, the Navy team felt a six
point cushion between the University's proposal
and the provisional rate was necessary to protect
the government's interests.
Last month, the Navy asked Stanford to sub
mit formal revisions to its rate taking into
account the cutbacks it had made several
months before. On Jan. 17, the University sub
mitted a revised proposal of 76 percent.
The Navy negotiating team apparently
insisted on maintaining its 6-point cushion and
knocked the rate down to 70 percent.
It is possible the rate will continue to change
during the upcoming weeks.
