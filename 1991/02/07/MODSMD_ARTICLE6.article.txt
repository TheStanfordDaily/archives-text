# Indirect cost rate drops two more points to 70
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
The Navy knocked another
two points off Stanford's provi
sional indirect cost rate yester
day, bringing the figure down
to 70 percent.
This latest reduction means
Stanford's rate — at least for
the time being — is eight
points less than what the Uni
versity had originally planned.
Each one-point drop translates
into about a $1.25 million loss
in revenue for the University
as a whole.
The reduction, the second in
less than two months, is a by
product of ongoing negotia
tions between the University
and the Office of Naval

Research. Until the contro
versy surrounding Stanford's
indirect cost policies is
resolved, the Navy has imposed
a provisional rate on Stanford
to? protect the government's
interests.
If the rate remains at 70
percent for the remainder of
the year, the University will
take in $10 million less in indi
rect cost recovery than it origi
nally expected.
Indirect cost recovery is the
second largest revenue source
of income in the University's
operating budget, accounting
for nearly 30 percent of Stan
ford's funds. Only tuition con
tributes more.
