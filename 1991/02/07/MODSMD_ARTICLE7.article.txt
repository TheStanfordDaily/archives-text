# Greek system proposes new alcohol guidelines
## 
### Connie Chang Editorial Staff 
In an effort to show good faith and
reduce liabilities, Stanford's Greek organi
zations have created their own alcohol poli
cies, complete with general guidelines for
campus parties.
Last night, the Intersorority Council dis
cussed a proposal — to be voted on next
week — that would implement self-imposed
regulations for serving alcohol at parties.
The Interfratemity Council passed a simi
lar, but separate, proposal last week.
While there are differences between the
two policies, both provide very specific
guidelines and procedures for planning
events. The regulations codify practices
some fraternities currently use, including:
• Having a minimum of two sober moni
tors circulating throughout the party to aid
people in danger of harming themselves or
others,
• Providing an adequate amount of non
alcoholic beverages, based upon the
expected turnout, and
• Checking for Stanford as well as age
identification "in a clear and precise man
»
ner.
In addition, the ISC policy states that
"the availability of alcohol does not consti
tute approval of intoxication.... We disap
prove of belligerent and/or inappropriate

sexual behavior."
The IFC policy allows individual frater
nities to draft their own alcohol policies
based upon the general guidelines and their
specific needs. Its policy notes several alter
native ways of regulating parties, including
having guest lists and areas restricted to
people over 21 years of age, said IFC Presi
dent Eric Jorgensen.
However, the IFC's judicial board will
hold fraternities accountable to the general
policy in situations when a complaint is
filed, Jorgensen said.
The separate ISC policy is "completely
necessary" because sororities have differ
ent needs and pressures, he added.
Kerrin Hedlund, who is in charge of
campus events for the ISC, explained that
unlike their male counterparts, sororities
are "not allowed (by their national chap
ters) to directly contribute funds to pur
chase alcohol."
Neither council believes its new policy
will affect rush or turnout at parties. Soror
ity rush has always been dry, and Jorgensen
said fraternities will just "have to be more
creative because the situation is not as
open."
While the changes have been influenced
by Stanford's revised alcohol policy, Jor
gensen and Hedlund said the Greek com-
munity would have proposed new
guidelines even if the University
regulations had not been imple
mented.
The new rules "abide by Stan
ford policy" and serve as a "bare
minimum (requirement) for fra
ternities and sororities," Hedlund
said.
Jorgensen said the IFC's poli
cies "wouldn't have been as
strict" had there been no Univer
sity policy change. Hedlund added
that without the changes, the
ISC's guidelines would have been
less focused on minors.
University administrators said
they support the Greek commu
nity for its leadership in making
these proposals.
"This is self-regulation, this is
what the community wants to
do," said Michael Ramsey-Perez,
program and fraternal affairs
adviser. He applauded the initia
tive as "a wonderful effort on the
part of the Greek community to

articulate steps people should be
taking."
The proposed general policies
and those of individual fraterni
ties will be reviewed and certified
by Louise Miller, director of the
Risk Reduction of Intoxicants in
the Stanford Community project
at Cowell Student Health Center.
Because their policies are self
imposed, the IFC and the ISC do
not need approval from any
administrative office of the Uni
versity.
However, Miller said certifica
tion is a "proactive measure to
show good faith [and] that
they've taken special training."
The project's training empha
sizes planning and control — such
as making sure there are enough
servers to prevent long lines and
self-service of alcohol, enough
monitors to guard against disrup
tions and enough non-alcoholic
beverages.
ISC President Erin Scalley and
Jorgensen have been trained and
are responsible for teaching oth
ers in the Greek community.
Scalley said she sees the new
policies as part of a "national

trend." There is more of an
"awareness of trying to decrease
liability, make parties safe and
make people more aware of
responsibilities," she added.
Jorgensen said the IFC's
"main goal is to get out a univer
sal set of guidelines to let fraterni
ties know what they should to be
doing to hold responsible parties
in the eyes of the IFC."
He said fraternities "don't
want to have strict policies."
"It's a pain to go this extra
yard because we feel Stanford
students are mature enough to
make their own decisions about
drinking, but that (expectation is)
not realistic anymore," he said.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Michael Jackson said, "Anything
[the Greek community] can do to
let students have fun safely and
with moderate use of alcohol is
terrific." He said he hopes it will
have an immediate effect.
"The big thing has been self
regulation, seeing where prob
lems are and trying to combat
them before the University feels
they need to aid us on that," Hed
lund said.

sexual behavior."
The IFC policy allows individual frater
nities to draft their own alcohol policies
based upon the general guidelines and their
specific needs. Its policy notes several alter
native ways of regulating parties, including
having guest lists and areas restricted to
people over 21 years of age, said IFC Presi
dent Eric Jorgensen.
However, the IFC's judicial board will
hold fraternities accountable to the general
policy in situations when a complaint is
filed, Jorgensen said.
The separate ISC policy is "completely
necessary" because sororities have differ
ent needs and pressures, he added.
Kerrin Hedlund, who is in charge of
campus events for the ISC, explained that
unlike their male counterparts, sororities
are "not allowed (by their national chap
ters) to directly contribute funds to pur
chase alcohol."
Neither council believes its new policy
will affect rush or turnout at parties. Soror
ity rush has always been dry, and Jorgensen
said fraternities will just "have to be more
creative because the situation is not as
open."
While the changes have been influenced
by Stanford's revised alcohol policy, Jor
gensen and Hedlund said the Greek com-
munity would have proposed new
guidelines even if the University
regulations had not been imple
mented.
The new rules "abide by Stan
ford policy" and serve as a "bare
minimum (requirement) for fra
ternities and sororities," Hedlund
said.
Jorgensen said the IFC's poli
cies "wouldn't have been as
strict" had there been no Univer
sity policy change. Hedlund added
that without the changes, the
ISC's guidelines would have been
less focused on minors.
University administrators said
they support the Greek commu
nity for its leadership in making
these proposals.
"This is self-regulation, this is
what the community wants to
do," said Michael Ramsey-Perez,
program and fraternal affairs
adviser. He applauded the initia
tive as "a wonderful effort on the
part of the Greek community to

articulate steps people should be
taking."
The proposed general policies
and those of individual fraterni
ties will be reviewed and certified
by Louise Miller, director of the
Risk Reduction of Intoxicants in
the Stanford Community project
at Cowell Student Health Center.
Because their policies are self
imposed, the IFC and the ISC do
not need approval from any
administrative office of the Uni
versity.
However, Miller said certifica
tion is a "proactive measure to
show good faith [and] that
they've taken special training."
The project's training empha
sizes planning and control — such
as making sure there are enough
servers to prevent long lines and
self-service of alcohol, enough
monitors to guard against disrup
tions and enough non-alcoholic
beverages.
ISC President Erin Scalley and
Jorgensen have been trained and
are responsible for teaching oth
ers in the Greek community.
Scalley said she sees the new
policies as part of a "national

trend." There is more of an
"awareness of trying to decrease
liability, make parties safe and
make people more aware of
responsibilities," she added.
Jorgensen said the IFC's
"main goal is to get out a univer
sal set of guidelines to let fraterni
ties know what they should to be
doing to hold responsible parties
in the eyes of the IFC."
He said fraternities "don't
want to have strict policies."
"It's a pain to go this extra
yard because we feel Stanford
students are mature enough to
make their own decisions about
drinking, but that (expectation is)
not realistic anymore," he said.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Michael Jackson said, "Anything
[the Greek community] can do to
let students have fun safely and
with moderate use of alcohol is
terrific." He said he hopes it will
have an immediate effect.
"The big thing has been self
regulation, seeing where prob
lems are and trying to combat
them before the University feels
they need to aid us on that," Hed
lund said.
