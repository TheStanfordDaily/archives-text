# Greek system proposes new alcohol guidelines

### Connie Chang Editorial Staff 
In an effort to show good faith and
reduce liabilities, Stanford's Greek organi
zations have created their own alcohol poli
cies, complete with general guidelines for
campus parties.
Last night, the Intersorority Council dis
cussed a proposal — to be voted on next
week — that would implement self-imposed
regulations for serving alcohol at parties.
The Interfratemity Council passed a simi
lar, but separate, proposal last week.
While there are differences between the
two policies, both provide very specific
guidelines and procedures for planning
events. The regulations codify practices
some fraternities currently use, including:
• Having a minimum of two sober moni
tors circulating throughout the party to aid
people in danger of harming themselves or
others,
• Providing an adequate amount of non
alcoholic beverages, based upon the
expected turnout, and
• Checking for Stanford as well as age
identification "in a clear and precise man
»
ner.
In addition, the ISC policy states that
"the availability of alcohol does not consti
tute approval of intoxication.... We disap
prove of belligerent and/or inappropriate

sexual behavior."
The IFC policy allows individual frater
nities to draft their own alcohol policies
based upon the general guidelines and their
specific needs. Its policy notes several alter
native ways of regulating parties, including
having guest lists and areas restricted to
people over 21 years of age, said IFC Presi
dent Eric Jorgensen.
However, the IFC's judicial board will
hold fraternities accountable to the general
policy in situations when a complaint is
filed, Jorgensen said.
The separate ISC policy is "completely
necessary" because sororities have differ
ent needs and pressures, he added.
Kerrin Hedlund, who is in charge of
campus events for the ISC, explained that
unlike their male counterparts, sororities
are "not allowed (by their national chap
ters) to directly contribute funds to pur
chase alcohol."
Neither council believes its new policy
will affect rush or turnout at parties. Soror
ity rush has always been dry, and Jorgensen
said fraternities will just "have to be more
creative because the situation is not as
open."
While the changes have been influenced
by Stanford's revised alcohol policy, Jor
gensen and Hedlund said the Greek com-
