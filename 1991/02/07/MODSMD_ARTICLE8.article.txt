# Bettelhiem called plagiarist

### Dan Steams Staff writer 
The late Bruno Bettelheim, a renowned
psychoanalyst and former Hoover Institu
tion fellow, was accused by a noted folklore
expert last week of plagiarizing parts of one
of his most famous works.
In an article in the Journal of American
Folklore, UC-Berkeley Anthropology Prof.
Alan Dundes said numerous sentences and
passages from Bettelheim's "The Uses of
Enchantment: The Meaning and Impor
tance of Fairy Tales" were taken from an
earlier book by Julius Heuscher.
Heuscher's book, "A Psychiatric Study of
Fairy Tales," was released in 1963. Bettel

heim's award-winning work was published
in 1976.
Bettelheim, who committed suicide in
March at the age of 86, was a well-known
expert on relating Sigmund Freud's theory
of psychoanalysis to fairy tales and folklore.
In his book, Bettelheim argued that fairy
tales represent the struggle for identity
children wage against their parents.
In an interview with The Daily, Dundes
said he was one of Bettelheim's biggest
fans. "This comes as quite a blow," he said.
"There are so few Freudians in the
world," Dundes said. "I have spent my
whole life trying to [apply] Freudian theory
to fairy tales."
Dundes said he first stumbled upon the
plagiarism last February when preparing to
present Bettelheim's work at a conference
on psychoanalysis in Hartford, Ct.
"He used the same tales in the same
order (as in Heuscher's book)," Dundes
explained. "He took whole sentences, word
for word" without giving adequate credit to
the author, he added.
Bettelheim was a senior research fellow
at Hoover until 1987. He also served as a
visiting professor of psychiatry at the
School of Medical. During the 1971-72 aca
demic year, he worked in the Center for
Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences
at Stanford.
Bettelheim was also a pioneer in treating
childhood mental illnesses and ran a school
for disturbed children at the University of
Chicago from 1944 to 1973.
