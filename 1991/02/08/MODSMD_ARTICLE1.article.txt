# Latest budget woes make deficit look likely
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
The University, having already sliced
$8 million from this year's operating bud
get, is likely to finish the year with a
deficit as large as $5.5 million.
This latest dose of bad news about
Stanford's financial health was delivered
to the Faculty Senate yesterday afternoon
by Provost James Rosse.
"We can and we will survive this year,"
Rosse said. But, he added, it will be a
struggle "to keep our head above water."
Only last fall Rosse predicted the Uni
versity's $22 million "repositioning"
effort would lead to a balanced budget
this year and produce surpluses in the
years to come.
But falling interest rates, overly opti
mistic projections of research volume and
financial fallout from the federal probes
of Stanford's indirect cost policies have
thrown this year's budget into a state of
disarray.
For many of the same reasons, the
planning process for next year's budget is

laced with uncertainty. "It's very difficult
to make firm projections about what the
future's going to look like," Rosse said in
an interview yesterday.
Under a best-case scenario, University
departments and offices will have to hold
their expenses at the inflation level next
year, Rosse said. But he is also asking that

they prepare for an alternate case — one
which would require cuts of 2 percent
after inflation.
Either way, he said, plans for most new
academic programs and services "will
have to be put on ice for awhile."
Budget planners are still wrestling
over how much to increase facultv and

staff salaries next year. Plans are still
very tentative, Rosse said, but it's possi
ble the increase will not match the infla
tion rate.
Much of the overall uncertainty cen
ters around the stability of federal
research conducted at Stanford. Domestic
spending restraints imposed by Congress
in last fall's budget battle and the federal
investigations of Stanford's indirect cost
policies have made it extremely difficult
to predict how much research-related rev
enue Stanford will garner in years to
come.
The government reimburses Stanford
for both the direct and indirect costs of
federally sponsored research here. Indi
rect costs are those expenses such as elec
tricity and building depreciation that are
not easily attributable to a single research
project.
Indirect cost recovery from federal
research represents the second-largest
component of Stanford's operating bud
get, accounting for nearly 30 percent.
Only tuition contributes more. Direct
costs of research are not included in the

operating budget.
Budget planners say they have no way
of knowing what Stanford's indirect cost
rate will be after all the federal probes
and audits of Stanford's policies finally
come to a close. "We're considering a vari
ety of Rosse said.
A provisional indirect cost rate
imposed by the Navy has taken its toll on
the University this year. Stanford had
planned on a rate of 78 percent, but that
figure has been knocked down three
times since this fall. The current rate,
announced Wednesday, is 70 percent.
A one-point drop in the indirect cost
rate translates into about $750,000 in
lost revenue to the operating budget.
It could be several months before a
final rate is established.
Due to the large number of uncertain
ties that still exist, Rosse has decided to
delay his submission of the 1991-92 bud
get to the Board of Trustees. Tradition
ally, the board reviews the proposed oper
ating budget in April; this year, it will be
presented at the June meeting.
