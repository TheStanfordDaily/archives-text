# Continuing Studies degree approved

### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
Starting next year, adults from the Bay
Area will have the opportunity to earn a mas
ter of liberal arts degree from Stanford's Con
tinuing Studies Program.
The Faculty Senate passed a measure
approving the new degree on a divided voice
vote yesterday afternoon.
Initiated in September 1988, the Continu
ing Studies program offers night courses
taught by Stanford faculty. Currently, there
are about 500 adults enrolled in the program
and between 15 and 20 courses offered each
quarter.
Supporters of the measure said yesterday

that only a fraction of those enrolled in the
program will likely choose to pursue a degree.
WTiile the program was almost universally
praised, several senators voiced concern about
unknown personnel and financial costs of the
program. The issue had been tabled at the sen
ate's meeting two weeks ago, after several fac
ulty members asked for additional information
about the proposal.
In other senate business, several faculty
raised concerns about the decision to eliminate
the University's deans of undergraduate and
graduate studies from the administrative
structure.
The decision, announced in October by
Provost James Rosse as part of "repositioning"

efforts, will take effect at the beginning of next
year.
The move is intended to encourage more
decision making within individual schools,
Rosse said.
Earlier in the meeting, Political Science
Prof. John Manley urged senate members to
help him schedule a discussion about the work
ing conditions at Webb Ranch, which leases
University land. The senate's steering commit
tee rejected a similar request by Manley earlier
this year.
"I think a full airing would be helpful,"
Manley said. "The people continue to live and
work in poverty. If we can't discuss this kind of
thing, what can we discuss?"
