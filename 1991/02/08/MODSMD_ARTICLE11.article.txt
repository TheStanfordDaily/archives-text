# Austrian traditions inspire ball, events

While Saturday night's
Viennese Ball and the Austria
Week celebration on campus
leading up to it are now well
known and well-attended
events, both came from more
humble origins.
The first ball, held in Toyon
Hall in 1977, was organized by
students who returned from
the Stanford-in-Vienna campus
wanting to share Austrian cul
ture with the Stanford commu
nity. About 350 students
attended.
Viennese Ball Chair Scott
Johnston, a graduate student,
said the ball's organizers hoped
to capture the spirit of Aus
tria's Fausching Season. Dur
ing this three-month festive
period from the new year to the
beginning of Lent, old castles
and museums throughout Aus
tria are transformed into dance
halls, with each room featuring
a different kind of dance, he
said.
Even after the closing of
Stanford's Vienna campus, the
popular ball continued as an
annual tradition, gradually
expanding into the elaborate
week-long celebration of Aus
trian culture now known as
Austria Week.
About 60 student volunteers

work to organize the week.
Many are interested in Austria
itself. "I've been to Austria, but
basically just saw a lot of cas
tles there," said Austria Week
publicity chair Sandy Lai. "I
joined the committee because I
wanted to learn more about
Austrian culture."
But some committee mem
bers are motivated by less ide
alistic goals, said Lai, a sopho
more. Students who volunteer
for the committee get reserved,
half-price tickets to the ball.
The committee leadership
keeps its members honest by
not handing out the reserved
tickets until people actually
appear to set up for the ball,
said committee member Samoa
Watanabe, a sophomore.
This year's other Austria
Week activities began Tuesday
and have included dance
lessons, speakers, a re-creation
of a wine tavern and a folk
ensemble performance.
But the ball remains the
week's high point. Featuring
the Stanford Symphony
Orchestra, a professional swing
band, dance competitions, dec
orations and refreshments,
this Saturday night's event
promises to be a memorable
evening for the 250 Stanford
couples lucky enough to get
tickets.
