Top court liberal retires
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — State Supreme
Court Justice Allen Broussard, one of the most
influential members of the Rose Bird court
and the leading dissenter on the current con
servative court, said Thursday he will retire
sometime this year.
The departure of Broussard after a decade
on the court is another blow to the waning
influence of liberalism in the California judi
ciary. It gives Gov. Pete Wilson the chance to
make his first appointment to the court, five of
whose remaining six members were appointed
by his fellow Republican, George Deukmejian.
Broussard, now 61, was appointed in 1981
by Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. after 17 years on
the municipal and superior courts in Alameda
County. He was the second black justice in the
court's history; the first, Brown appointee
Wiley Manuel, died in 1980.
IRA attacks Prime Minister
LONDON (AP) — A mortar shell fired by the
Irish Republican Army from an abandoned van
exploded Thursday within 50 feet of Prime
Minister John Major as he met with his War
Cabinet, Scotland Yard said.
Mfy'or and his colleagues were not injured in
the attack near 10 Downing St., his office said.
Three police officers and a civil servant were
treated for minor injuries, a spokeswoman at
Westminster Hospital said.
It was the IRA's first mortar attack in
Britain, though it has often used the weapon in
Northern Ireland.
Queen Elizabeth 11, who seldom speaks on
current events, mentioned the attackers while
opening a London Hospital. "I would like to
take this opportunity to remind them that
they will not succeed," the monarch said.
Underwear saves Australian
NEW DELHI, India (AP) — An Australian
tourist sentenced to 10 years in prison for car
rying hashish in his underwear was cleared by
an appeals court when he proved that the
briefs produced in evidence did not fit him.
Andrews Salvador was given the prison
term plus a fine of nearly $28,000 by a lower
court after his arrest last April, Press Trust of
India reported Thursday.
Kerala High Court Justice K. Padmanab
han asked him to wear the underwear in the
presence of a court official. The official told the
judge that despite all his efforts to wriggle into
it, Salvador "miserably failed."
