PARIS (AP) — President Francois Mitterrand
predicted Thursday that the Gulf War allies will
mount a ground offensive against entrenched Iraqi
troops this month, but ruled out occupation of large
chunks of Iraq's territory.
He flatly rejected using nuclear, chemical or bio
logical weapons, even if Saddam Hussein used non
conventional weapons.
"Once we've liberated Kuwait, we'll have done
most of the job we set out to do," he said. "I don't
want this to turn into a war covering all of Iraq's ter
ritory, with all that implies in terms of occupying
towns, resistance movements and day-to-day fight
ing by other means."
After one journalist noted that U.S. officials
hadn't ruled out using nuclear weapons in the event
of a non-conventional attack on allied forces, Mitter
rand said:
"I rule it out. Neither chemical arms, nor bacteri
ological, nor nuclear arms. To engage in arms of this
type would be a descent toward a barbarism that I
refuse."
The French president said he did not fear an
international escalation of the conflict, as Baghdad
has apparently hoped to achieve by attempting to
draw Israel and possibly Iran into the war.
"I don't believe for one second that this could
degenerate into another world war," Mitterrand
said. But "if we hadn't acted now, we would have
found ourselves in the conditions of conflict that
could have risked one."
A postwar settlement should be organized by the
United Nations, Mitterrand said. He reiterated his
longstanding call for a peace conference to solve the
Middle East's problems, including Lebanon and the
Israeli-Palestinian dispute.
Mitterrand's aims are somewhat at odds with a
postwar plan proposed Wednesday by U.S. Secretary
of State James A. Baker 111, who avoided references
to an international peace conference.
Mitterrand said any settlement must include
respect for internationally recognized borders and
national sovereignty, a global arms control plan,
mutual security guarantees and a workable regional
balance of power.
"We must not fool ourselves," Mitterrand said.
"It's the Security Council that should organize the
return to peace."
He said arms sales would have to be controlled.
France has come under heavy criticism for sup
plying Baghdad with about 25 percent of its arsenal
before the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. France was
second only to the Soviet Union in arms sales to
Baghdad.
Mitterrand predicted that the allies would not
become bogged down in a protracted ground war, and
doubted the conflict would have lasting harm on
Western economies.
