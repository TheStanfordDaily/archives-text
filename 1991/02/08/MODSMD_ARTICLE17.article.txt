## An urgent problem 
### 
Recommendations are
strong; ramifications
need to be addressed

THE BULK OF THE recom
mendations made in the Sex
ual Assault Task Force's
report, released February 5, should
be implemented. In particular, a
formal written policy concerning
sexual assault is desperately
needed.
One recommendation, however,
seems out of context in its scope.
The call for an examination of the
"beyond a reasonable doubt" stan
dard of proof with respect to all
Fundamental Standard cases has
wide reaching implications and
requires further thought.
Certainly there is a definite need
to examine critically the status quo
which allows so many cases of sex
ual assault to go unprosecuted.
One-third of the Stanford
women and one-eighth of the Stan
ford men who responded to a sur
vey done by the Stanford Rape
Education Project reported having
full sexual activity when they did
not want to. This is a crisis which
demands a remedy.
The report calls for a funded,
highly visible Coordinator of Sex
ual Assault Response Services, a
legitimate starting point. Unfortu
nately, the University has said it is
unlikely it will be able to fund such
a position now.
Nonetheless, the creation of
such a position should remain a
high priority and, as the report
suggests, the responsibilities of the
coordinator should be distributed
to other individuals until such a
position can be implemented.
Significantly, rape education can
only go so far. In order to combat
the situation, the prosecution in
sexual assault cases must have

teeth. Usually involving only two
people, sexual assault cases are
particularly problematic since
proof is difficult and usually comes
down to one person's word against
another's. Wliat's more, this con
fusion is often further muddled by
the issue of consent.
According to President Kennedy
in a speech during Rape Awareness
Week last spring, forcing or coerc
ing another person into sex "vio
lates the most fundamental princi
ple of this community."
But the question remains
whether the heinousness of the
problem or the difficulties of prov
ing sexual assault cases justifies
the lightening of the burden of
proof. Instead of "proof beyond a
reasonable doubt," one suggestion
is "clear and convincing evidence"
as the criteria for the burden of
proof.
Such a change would increase
the potential for abuse in the judi
cial system.
There are a variety of situations
in which violations of the Funda
mental Standard are ambiguous,
and the new wording could upset
one of the basic principles of the
Fundamental Standard â€” the
notion that ours is a community
based on trust.
We urge students and adminis
trators alike to think long and hard
before speeding to change the bur
den of proof in these cases. The
implications must be considered
and. not lost as a minor detail
among other necessary changes to
combat the problem of sexual
assault on campus.
While the standard procedures
for dealing with sexual assault
cases must be examined, and there
must be more individuals responsi
ble and trained for these proce
dures, the issue of the burden of
proof for the entire Fundamental
Standard is a considerable one and
is cause for further thought and
examination.
