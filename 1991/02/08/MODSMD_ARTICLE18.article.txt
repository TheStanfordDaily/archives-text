In striving for peace, we need to overcome prejudice

TRUTH IS THE FIRST casualty of
war. ... and war's first fruit is
prejudice. How does this come
about?
Extremist patriots of every nation
manage to blindfold themselves with the
flag, so they can't see the humanity of
those they maim and kill through war.
Convenient.
Victims are transformed into an
abstract enemy — demonized beyond
recognition. The flag wavers simply
refine the grand art of prejudice. My
country, especially when it's wrong.
What is prejudice in its essence ? Prej
udice is a prejudgment that can't be
bothered with acknowledging the human
characteristics of someone of a different
faith, a different orientation, a different
nationality, a different color.
Small wonder prejudice flourishes
during times of war hysteria. Have you
noticed how Israel-bashing, Islam-bash
ing, peace-bashing, as well as anti-
Semitism, anti-Americanism and anti-
Arabism are on the increase around the
world?
Scuds, bouncing Betsies, and terrorist
attacks may come from different direc

tions, but their target is always the
same. A faceless enemy. Someone not
recognized as a fellow human.
How does prejudice prevent learning'?
The urge to justify all my actions blocks
off my ability to empathize with the feel
ings of other people. Thus, when I am
preoccupied with my own point of view,
convinced of the Tightness of my cause,
or consumed with self-pity, I'm unable to
gain the information that can be gleaned
from temporarily adopting the perspec
tive of my erstwhile opponent.
In the Middle East, the results are too
well-known — rhetoric brimming with
bitterness, resentment, fear, outrage,
terror, self-justification, rationalization.
It's so bad, I've noticed that some peo
ple assume I cannot be a true friend
unless I scorn and denigrate the same
people they do on the principle "love me,
hate my enemies."
I begin overcoming prejudice by iden
tifying with someone beyond my circle. In
the midst of all the self-serving rhetoric
of war, a few citizens have shown us how
to combat prejudice and restore truthful
ness and compassionate understanding
to the world. I refer to Japanese-Ameri
cans.

Recalling how they were once herded
into barbed-wire camps — their honest
patriotism and citizenship notwithstand
ing — many of them are protesting the
current intimidation of Arab-Americans.
They identify with persons of a different
hue, a different religion, a different cul
ture.
Impressive as this is, the Jewish tradi
tion demands that we go one step fur
ther. It claims that extending compas
sionate understanding to enemies is
more powerful than dumping coals of
fire on their heads. I take this to mean
that genuine empathy disorients your
opponent: The soft answer turns away
anger and begins the slow process of
negotiation, trust-building, cooperation,
reconciliation, peace.
This is the jujitsu principle of non-vio
lence. Dump fiery coals on me, and I'm
justified in dumping whatever I have on
you — be that a missile loaded with
nerve gas or one loaded with a nuclear
device.
But, if you can get across to me the
fact that you grasp whatever merit may
reside in my position, that you
empathize with me, I relax the finger
poised on the button. I begin to think

about you as a humane human being. I
change.
What happens if some Palestinians
begin to identify with the Israelis in Tel
Aviv, some Israelis with Palestinians on
the West Bank, some Americans with
Iraqis in Basra, some Iraqis with the
Kuwaitis? Surely they will be denounced
as traitors by their more zealous compa
triots.
Yet isn't that the kind of daring we
must have during these times of chau
vinism, paranoia and double standards?
This approach doesn't pretend to solve
the complex problems of the Persian
Gulf, but it may prevent the escalation of
hostilities.
Another example of "political correct
ness?" Hardly. This thought-stopper
phrase is merely another version of
"knee-jerk liberal." To bring peace to the
war-weary planet, we'll have to use more
thought-starters. Eliminating negative
stereotypes which cloud clear thinking is
a good place to begin. As the Buddhists
say, "Right thoughts, right words, right
deeds."
