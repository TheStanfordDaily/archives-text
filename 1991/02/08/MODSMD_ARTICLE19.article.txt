# Anti-war movement should reconsider its approach to protest
## 
### 
I would be the first to agree that the
United States is a flawed government. In
fact, it was partially in hopes of someday
improving it that I came to school.
I also will make no apology for the
often stupid and sometimes immoral for
eign policy which our nation has fol
lowed. The decision to go to war in the
Gulf is certainly questionable on both

moral and practical levels.
But does it really make sense to
protest U.S. action by laying bodies cov
ered in fake blood in the middle of the
busiest bike routes on campus, perhaps
causing people to crash and spill some
REAL blood?
The Stanford peace activists, like
those in San Francisco ("anti-war vio
lence" being the only definition of an
oxymoron more apt than "military intel
ligence"), seem more concerned about
expressing themselves than about the
results of that expression.
Should they succeed in obstructing
the U.S. war effort, the only thing they
could possibly accomplish would be to

drag out the war and watch more people
die. And I don't remember any mass ral
lies protesting the butchering and raping
of Kuwaiti citizens.
It seems to be "politically correct" to
ignore this event, placing all the blame
for the crisis on the United States —
although I can't explain why.
The demonstrators who gleefully hurl
epithets such as racist and imperialist at
the United States seem to forget not only
who started the invasion, but also that
such dissent in Iraq would have gotten
them killed.
The United States may be confused.

but it is hardly evil incarnate.
I certainly agree that war is an unmit
igated horror, and I can respect the opin
ion that this one is being fought for
unacceptable reasons. But do something
useful, protesters.
Stop burning cars and daring bikes to
crash into you. Don't desert the victims
of war in the name of morality. Such
actions help nobody, least of all those in
the Gulf.
You are right to want peace, but some
sensibility would be nice too.
