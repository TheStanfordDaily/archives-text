## We can't hide it anymore 
### 
WE WERE LIKE ALL high school
guys. We scammed, we dated, we
told other guys about our
exploits. We were like other guys, but
there was one difference.
The other guys felt great acting tough,
cool and alooC but we felt strange as the
stereotypical males. It seemed silly to
date women just to increase our status.
After the typical "one-night stand," we
would leave, sickened and confused.
Slowly, we discovered what made us dif
ferent.
We did not fully understand our feel
ings until we met. After spending time
together, we came to grips with it. We
talked, laughed, and asked God why it
had to be us. We couldn't keep it inside
any longer; we told the rest of the dorm.
Now, we have to tell the rest of campus.
We are . . .
PATHETIC GUYS
Pathetic Guy: a male exhibiting the fol
lowing characteristics:
1) over-analyzes women;
2) views any socially successful man as
egotistical, wealthy and M.A.C.H.O.
(Male Association of Callous Heartless
Ogres);
3) views all other men as socially suc
cessful;
4) sees himself as potentially the ideal
mate;
5) rationalizes his pathos; and
6) exhibits totally absurd behavior for
the purpose of validating himself (see
below).
K and A Validation Hierarchy
(Acts listed in ascending order of absur
dity)

1) Validation through humor. A
joke, look, action or sound designed to
provoke laughter. Followed by, "Dude, did
you see me make her laugh?"
2) Validation through sensitivity.
Listening to the beloved lament her diffi
culties with other men. Designed to
demonstrate loyalty.
3) Validation through menial
labor. Cooking, cleaning and performing
other small tasks for the beloved.
Designed to demonstrate helpfulness,
diligence, consideration and degree of lib
eration.
4) Validation through noble sacri
fice. Standing in the corner at a frater
nity party so that the beloved can dance
with you and not look desperate in front
of the guy she likes; setting up the
beloved with the guy she likes; gracefully
accepting the fact that the beloved views
you "only as a friend" and not saying "I
told you so" when the beloved is ill
treated by the jerk you warned her about.
This is far and away the most heinously
destructive and absurd behavior — you
know and we know, she's never gonna
notice.
The Pathetic Guy idealistically
believes that the next place that he goes
will be Nirvana, where the Pathetic Guy
will be validated eternally. Meanwhile,
the jerks go the way of the dinosaur.
We thought Stanford was Nirvana.
The liberated women on this campus
would certainly be able to distinguish
quality guys from the jerks. After all, we
are strong yet sensitive, masculine yet
emotional, athletic yet artistic, handsome
yet modest, independent yet devoted, etc.

yet etc. That is what women are looking
for these days, right?
Wrong.
The women here still go out with the
M.A.C.H.O. guys. (Of course, we under
stand entirely, are here if you need to talk,
and will support you in your decision to
date whomever you like.)
We are certainly not criticizing the
women; they are not to blame for our
insecurity. We realize that we only get
stepped on, rejected, and avoided, because
we allow it. We walk away hurt, knowing
that our pain results from our decisions
and not those of others.
The pain, however, is no less real.
You will never see this. You will think
we have it together. You will be wrong.
The Pathetic Guy hides behind a mask of
humor, thus convincing himself and oth
ers that he is all right.
It is clear that Pathetic Guys need an
advocacy/support group on campus. We
could call this group the Organization
Representing Generally Attractive Sensi
tive Males (0.R.G.A.5.M.). Yeah. And we
could meet at The Bridge. That way, when
the women finally come around, they will
know where to find us.

chy — validation through column-writ
ing.
