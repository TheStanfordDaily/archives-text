A new New Deal was announced today, one which
promised, instead of a chicken in every pot, a pearl in
every oyster. In a story entitled "New Deal for Oys
ters Planned at Stanford," the world was first intro
duced to the vision of biologist Paul Bonnot.
Attempting to extend New Deal legislation to mol
lusks, Dr. Bonnot pushed his plan for establishing "a
better housing plan for the bivalve society" at Stan
ford.
Dr. Bonnot had searched for years until finding
Humboldt Bay, a haven for oysters. It was perfect, he
said, because it would be difficult for "the oysters to
overpopulate the bay, making crowded slum condi
tions." And anyone who saw "Good Times" knows
how difficult it is for a mollusk to rise from the ghet
tos.
