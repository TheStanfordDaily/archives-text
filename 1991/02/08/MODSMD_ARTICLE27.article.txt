# Büg investigates snake phalluses, Grimaces
## 
### John Ott 
Dear Bug,
During a typical dorm "intellectual
discussion," a guy down the hall said
that snakes have two barbed penises.
Could you look into this for me? I'd
hate to ask the people at the Green
Library reference desk.
— Double Entendre
Dear Mr. Entendre,
Your penis question wasn't all that
hard to handle. Personal experience, as
well as the information gleaned from a
colleague over a late lunch, has taught
me that not only snakes, but most
reptiles, are all in fact the more blessed
of God's creatures.
Yes, even the fearsome alligator
sports two hemipenises, as they are
called. Only one hemipenis can be fully
operational at any given time, how
ever, which leads to further questions:
Why two? Why the bonus castration
complex?
Though the temptation is great, I
will refrain from making crude dia
gramed references to electrical outlets
or the Doublemint twins, and simply

state that this wishbone formation
(sorry) is necessary to carry out one of
Mother Nature's stranger mating pro
cedures. Food for Freudian thought,
anyway.

What about the barbs, you ask?
Through intensive research (World
Book Encyclopedia Volume 12: O-P) I
also discovered that neither snakes nor
lizards, but in fact "some domestic cats,
are the proud owners of this, um,
prickly pear. Every rose has its thorn, I
suppose.

The technical basis behind this con
genital nightmare can be attributed to
the female cats' aversion to the old
horizontal disco. Apparently the barbs
keep the organ in question in place
even while the female does her best to
break off the relationship.
Go figure.
Dear Bug,
Something brought up in CIV sec
tion the other day has been on my
mind lately, and I can't stop thinking
about it. I was wondering if you had
any answers to this burning question:
If the Fry Guys represent fries and the
Hamburglar stands for hamburgers,
what the hell is Grimace?
— McWondering
Dear McWondering,
Alas, this Grimace quandary was a
little trickier to work out. Repeated
attempts to get in touch with Ronald
McDonald were unsuccessful. In fact, I
was harassed by Mayor McCheese and
his cronies when I became persistent
and, perhaps, too close to a larger,
more insidious truth.
Through an anonymous source

'Grimace is not, as I orig
inally thought, meant to
symbolize Christ.'

(some guy in a mask with a really odd
chemical addiction) I did determine
that Grimace is not, as I originally
thought, meant to symbolize Christ,
nor does he represent the layered
deposits of gum found underneath the
molded seats. In reality, Grimace is the
patron saint of McDonald's milk
shakes.
But, as the astute reader notes, how
can this be so when he's the color of
them horseshoe Lucky Charms? Well,
McDonald's used to sell grape-flavored
shakes. No fooling (if you must know,
it all has to do with a former employee
who was inadvertently zapped like Dr.
David Banner with the mutating
gamma rays they use in the danish
oven).
So don't get Grimace angry.
You wouldn't like him when he's
angry.
