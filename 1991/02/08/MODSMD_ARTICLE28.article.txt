# Chicks, man, chicks

A S FAR AS I CAN TELL,
/\ there are two kinds of peo-
XAple at Stanford: men and
women.
To the untrained observer,
these two types appear similar in
many ways. But, after recent in
depth and detailed studies, expert
researchers have determined that
the only attribute men and
women have in common is a dis
like for having their bellies ripped
open by wild animals.
So, to help clear up this whole
befuddling issue, I'm going to out
line some of the major gender dif
ferences at Stanford.
And by the way, if you happen
to be taking this seriously, just
keep in mind that kicking some
one out of housing for a humor
article would be really bad press
for yourself.
OK. The first thing that guys
need to realize is that members of
the opposite sex tend to have a
much lower tolerance for embar
rassment. Sure, it doesn't bother
you to play Frisbee with TV din
ners in the frozen food section of
Safeway. The average female,
however, when confronted with
this situation, will not only refuse
to play, but will actually try to
hide in another aisle so she won't
be seen by the manager when he
comes over to make you clean up
the tater tots.
On the other hand, women
need to keep in mind that most
college males ignore all basic
norms of cleanliness.
Yes, I'm sure some of you
females think you have a messy
room as well, meaning that five of
your 30 pairs of shoes are strewn
on your closet floor, but you just
don't realize that most guys have

at least twice that many new life
forms evolving in their carpets.
Fortunately, it's usually not
possible for them (the new life
forms) to escape into the rest of
the world, without climbing
through layers of clothes, old Hal
loween candy and the bodies of
people who happened to open the
refrigerator while inhaling.
Another major difference that
should be taken into account is
that guys tend to be more destruc
tive.
Sure, I've seen a couple females
attend hockey games, but they're
usually not hoping that a fight
will break out so they can see
facial fragments splatter into the
crowd.
Guys, on the other hand, will
be in the front row, eagerly wait
ing with open Tupperware con
tainers, hoping to catch a sou
venir. (Unless the crowd makes
them throw it back.)
As you can see, dealing with
someone of the opposite sex can
often be a bit of a stretch, espe
cially during football season. But
there are some simple things you
can do to help ease the tensions.
Guys: When dining out, try to
avoid challenging the waiter to a
belching contest before he's taken
your order, and don't make reser
vations under phony names (Mag
got, Hamsterdrool, etc. . . .).
As for you people of the female
persuasion, stop telling guys that
their clothes clash. As it happens,
the average Stanford male
couldn't tell which colors "go"
together if two of them jumped up
and had intimate relations on his
desk.
So clearly, gender differences at
Stanford are nothing that can't be
resolved with a little patience, a
little sensitivity and a lot of semi
automatic weapons.
