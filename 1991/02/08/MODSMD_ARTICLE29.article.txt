# TREASURE HUNT
## 
### 
"A treasure hunt?"
you ask in your all-too
eager-for-entertainment
voice.
Yes, a treasure hunt.
But I guess all our time
here at Stanford is a trea
sure hunt in a way. A '
hunt for truth, a hunt for
knowledge, a hunt for a
date.
But now it's time to
slap on your eye patch,
take your parrot out of
your freezer, and prepare t
to search for thousands of
dollars in cash and prizes.
Well, would you believe
a $100 gift certificate?
The Great Search will
begin next week, when I

will divulge the first clue. For

now, all I can tell you is that the

prize is buried on campus somewhere in an

enveloped marked with the phone number to call to claim your prize.
So get off your hobby horse, put on your secret decoder ring, and come join us for
the wackiest, craziest event in Stanford history (save the Sammy Car Bash).
C'mon, it'll be fun.
Trust me.
