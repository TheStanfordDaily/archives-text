## Washington State defeats error-plagued hoopsters Last-second surge not enough to offset terrible foul shooting, crucial turnovers 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
PULLMAN, Wash. - The Stan
ford men's basketball team ar
rived at Washington State a day
late and about a hundred dollars
short yesterday, and the result
was one of the the Cardinal's
poorest efforts of the season.
Hampered by an acute inability
to deal with the Cougars' pressure
defense, a lack of hustle, turkey
like foul shooting and Keystone-
Kop officiating, Stanford fell
74-68 to WSU in a game the Car

Stanford would have been tied
for second in the Pacific 10 Con
ference had it won last night, but
instead falls into a tie for seventh
at 5-6 (12-9 overall). The Cougars,
who played without leading scorer
Neil Derrick (who was in Texas
for his grandmother's funeral) are
now 6-4 in the conference — a
game behind the Arizona Wild
cats, who lost at USC last night
— and 14-6 overall.
The Cougars dominated the
game from the start, swarming
like crazy all over the Cardinal
on defense, using a three-quarter
court trapping press to harass
Stanford's guards, denying the
weak-side guards the ball and
pushing center Adam Keefe
waaaay away from the hoop.
Keefe finished with a team-high
15 points, but only made three of
his nine shots from the floor.
"Teams always try to push you
out on defense," Keefe said. "The
problem was that combined with
the fact I had to move up and
help out on top because of their
pressure. We were running plays
about five or six feet out from
where we normally execute
them."
"The key to this game was that
we worked hard all week on de

win this game.'

fensive pressure," said WSU coach
Kelvin Sampson. "We just wanted
to get behind Keefe and push him
out as far away as we could, and
we wanted to deny the ball to
their weak-side guard."
The pressure might have been
a key, but it had a little help:
Stanford was a miserable 14-for
-27 at the free throw line last
night, compared to the Cougars'
sizzling 20-for-25, and lost by that
six-shot difference. Deshon Win
gate missed all five of his foul
shots, and Kenny Hicks was 1-
for-6. The Cougars were also
on fire from the three-point line,
hitting a phenomenal 10 of their
21 treys. Terrence Lewis had
three of them on the way to 21
points.
Still, it was the pressure that
made the difference, even though
it shouldn't have. Stanford had
21 turnovers in the game (five in
the first three minutes) and only
nine assists.
"They were really physical,"
said John Patrick, who took only
four shots and ended up with four
points and three turnovers. "They
have great quickness, but we
should be able to handle that. It's
nothing we haven't seen before."
"Needless to say, I'm not very
pleased with our effort," Stanford
coach Mike Montgomery said.
"Washington State was extremely
aggressive from the beginning and
we didn't handle ourselves at all."
"Early on we felt we got out
hustled to loose balls, we didn't
rebound well. .. Montgomery
said. "We didn't deserve to win
this game. We're going to have to
play better on the road if we want
to win."
Of course, playing on the road
isn't easy — especially when you
go through a stretch in Traveling
Hell on the way to the game. Stan
ford was originally scheduled to

arrive in Pullman late Wednesday
night, but that got changed to
early Thursday afternoon thanks
to the weather at San Francisco
International.
The Cardinal's flight to
Spokane, scheduled for 7 p.m.
Wednesday, was canceled: The
plane didn't make it in to SFO
that morning because of fog. (Of
course, United Airlines didn't
bother to call anyone to tell them
the flight was history.) The team
was given two choices: Stay at the
Airport Hilton, catch an early
flight to Spokane and take an
hour-long bus ride to Pullman, or
fly to Portland, spend the night
there, and then fly to Spokane
and the bus.
Montgomery chose the former,
which meant Stanford was up yes
terday morning at 6:30 a.m. and
traveled all day, instead of getting
up at 9 a.m. and spending most
of the day resting in a hotel. After
getting to Pullman at 1 p.m. yes
terday, the team actually went to
Friel Court to shoot around before
ever even seeing its hotel.
And, last night, it showed. The
Cougars, thanks to pressuring,
harassing (mugging? nah) and
swarming, were up 22-9 before
the Cardinal figured out what was
going on. The team woke up a
little when Montgomery picked up
a technical foul berating the refs
for their ineptitude and cut it to
29-22, but WSU got it back up to
37-24 at the half.

Montgomery's T — only his sec
ond in the last three years —
came because he was trying to
point out to the refs that the
Cougars' were more or less tack
ling the Cardinal every time they
set a pick. In general, the officiat
ing had zero consistency: In the
first half, the Cougars could have
kicked a Stanford player in the
groin and not been called for a
foul; in the second, Stanford was

in the bonus with over 13 minutes
to go, as the slightest contact was
whistled.
"Nothing to say about that,"
Montgomery said.
"I don't comment on officiat
ing," Sampson said.
All right, we will: Larry, Curly
and Moe would have done a better
job officiating this game.
But still, the fact remains that
the Cardinal had the deficit down

to 42-39 with 12 minutes left in
the game ... and were outscored
18-9 in the next six minutes.
Twice during that stretch Stan
ford was on the line for two shots.
They missed all four shots.
The Cardinal went into a press
with four minutes to go, and
Marcus Lollie hit a pair of threes
to cut the lead to six with six
seconds left, but it was way too
little way too late.

Deshon Wingate's drives to the basket weren't enough for the Cardinal last night, who fell to Washing
ton State.
