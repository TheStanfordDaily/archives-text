# Women slam Cougars

### David Hirning Senior staff writer 
As the game began, it was apparent that
there were two glaring problems last night
at Maples Pavilion. There were huge gaps of
empty bleachers in the student section, and
there was an empty seat where Stanford
star center Trisha Stevens should have
been.
Midterms may have kept the students
away in droves, but Stevens' absence was
due to something even more horrible and
insidious: a reaggravation of her damaged
right knee in Thursday's practice. Before
last night, Stevens had started 72 straight
games.
A few more students eventually strag
gled in, and the Cardinal senior finally
made it as well—in street clothes. Fortu
nately for Stanford, a lackluster perfor
mance by Washington State and some
timely shooting made Stevens' absence
immaterial as the Cardinal cruised to the
93-63 win.
Stanford Coach Tara VanDerveer can
only hope both problems can be rectified
before Saturday's nationally-televised
showdown with arch-rival Washington (See
Preview Box). If Stevens and the fans are
no-shows again, it could be a long night.
"Her chances are good (to play against
Washington)," VanDerveer said. "I think
(resting) tonight helps her play Saturday."
Last night, Stevens could only watch as

opposition in Maples. It was Stanford's
third consecutive rout at home, and 11th
straight win overall. Only 2,211 witnessed
the contest, the lowest home crowd to see a
Cardinal game this season.
The Cardinal, true to their modus
operandi, took a close game at the half and
turned it into a blowout with an early sec
ond half run. It took little more than five
minutes for Stanford to stretch a nine
point halftime lead into a 25-point advan
tage and a win.
The Cardinal shot an obscene 64 percent
in the first half, and wound up settling for
58 percent for the game. It was the first
time a Cougar opponent had shot more
than even 50 percent from the field this
season.
"It was a stellar team effort," Van-
Derveer said. Julie Zeilstra led all scorers
with 25 points, while Sonja Henning had 19
and Val Whiting contributed 15 points and
11 rebounds (her ninth double-double of
the year).
The decision to sit Stevens was made in
the pregame warmups, and sophomore for
ward Chris MacMurdo was informed she
would start "five minutes before the game."

The Cardinal hoopsters' airtight defense helped topple WSU at Maples Pavilion last night. The Stanford women are now
17-3 on the season.
