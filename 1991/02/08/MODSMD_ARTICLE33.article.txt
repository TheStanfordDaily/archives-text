Unbeaten? Yes.
Unproven? Maybe.
If the Cardinal men's volleyball team's
division-leading 4-0 WIVA record doesn't
quite speak for itself, they'll get their
chance to be heard tonight when they face
the Pepperdine Waves (#6 in the AVCA
poll) at Maples Pavilion.
In what coach Ruben Nieves calls,
"definitely our biggest league match so
far," Stanford begins a four-game stretch
in which they will face the nation's sixth,
second, ninth, and other top-ranked
teams in a 10-day span.
The Cardinal comes into tonight riding
a five-match winning streak, which has
lifted their record to 5-1 overall. Their
Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Associ
ation unbeaten record leaves them tied
with 2nd-ranked Long Beach State for
the lead in the Harry Wilson division.
Still, their four WIVA wins have come

against the likes of cellar-dwellers Loyola
Marymount, Brigham Young, and
Hawaii.
Pepperdine enters the match with a 4-
2 overall record, and with a 1-2 WIVA
mark. They stand in third place in the
DeGroot division, behind UCI.A and Cal-
State Northridge. However, they have
won their last two matches, non-league
contests against LMU and Princeton.
The Waves return four starters from a
team that finished the 1990 season
ranked 11th. Three of those players have
given Pepperdine big offensive numbers
so far this season. Sophomore middle
blocker Tom Sorenson (6-foot-6), last
year's Freshman Player of the Year, leads
the squad in kills with 119 and has a hit
ting percentage of .341. Senior outside
hitter Dijon Douphner (6-5) has 30 digs to
go along with 83 kills and a .327 hitting
percentage, and 6-5 senior middle blocker
Brian Merrick is hitting an impressive
.426.

Last weekend in two
matches against
Hawaii, they hit .397
and .418, their highest
two averages of the
season.

Cardinal more than mildly concerned.
"They're a big team with excellent hitting
and blocking skills, we know we'll have to
have an great passing and serving match
to beat them," he said.
Stanford's offense has been peaking,
and they couldn't have picked a better
time to do it. Last weekend in two
matches against Hawaii, they hit .397
and .418, their highest two averages of
the season.

The surge has been led by outside hit
ter Dave Goss, who last Saturday
exploded for a career-high 36 kills. On
the year Goss has amassed a team-high
102 kills for a .354 average, and his 36
digs are just one short of Bob Hillman's
club-leading total. Hillman and Duncan
Blackman have also been hot hitters from
the outside, pounding down 159 and 156
kills on the season, respectively.
Freshman Canyon Ceman and sopho
more Jimmy Blackman have been split
ting time at the setter position and turn
ing in consistent all-around play. Ceman
has averaged 16 assists per match, and
Blackman has had 12.9.
Stanford's lone shortcoming on
offense has been production from the
middle blocker position, where Mike
Lowe leads with 65 kills.
The Cardinal are entering the most
difficult stretch of their WIVA schedule,
with their next three matches, versus
Long Beach State, UC Santa Barbara and
USC, being on the road.

Hillman said the team realizes the
importance of this game, and how crucial
to the season the next four matches will
be. "We know we've got a big road trip
coming up, and our goal all along has
been to go into that trip undefeated," he
said.
"We're still unbeaten in WIVA, we won
the four matches we had to. Now we're
right where we want to be," said Nieves.
How long they will stay there, the next
10 days will tell.
