# Divers Wightman, Sagel lead swimmers against USC, UCLA

### Amy Wusterbarth Staff writer 
Like Batman and Robin aiding the
forces of good in Gotham City, Stan
ford's own dynamic duo of Brad Wight
man and Darryl Sagel have been helping
the men's swimming team with some
outstanding performances in the diving
tank.
Last weekend sophomore Wightman
crushed all competition by placing first
on both boards at Arizona and Arizona
State. Sagel, a freshman, also gave the
team a boost by placing third in three
events and fourth in the other.
In a deadlock with the Wildcats for
most of the meet, the Cardinal needed
all the help they could get. In true heroic
fashion, the divers came to the rescue.
"They were a big part of our successes
this weekend," said assistant swimming
coach Ted Knapp.
Success comes with consistency for
these two Stanford superheroes.
"Everyone has most of their dives
down," explained Wightman, "It always
comes down to who has the best backs
and gainers (2-1/2 pike and reverse 2-1/2
pike). They don't even have to be great,
just consistently good. In Arizona this
year I put together a more consistent
list than they did."
Wightman is taking his success in
stride, concentrating on one meet at a
time. All the dual meets are simply
preparation for postseason competition.
"I definitely want to qualify this year. I
missed it by one last year. Once I'm
there I just want to keep my composure
because it'll be my first time."
His chances of qualifying are excel
lent because there are more -spots open
this year in Stanford's zone. There are
four zones, and the number of divers
that can qualify from each zone depends
on how well the zone did overall at

Sagel has surprised his
coach with his skill. 'I was
not real familiar with his
talent,' said diving coach
Rick Schavone, 'but he
has a lot more than I'd
have guessed. He's defi
nitely a national caliber
diver if he sticks with it.'

NCAA's in the previous year.
Sagel, the younger half of the
dynamic duo, was Stanford's top
recruit, although the diving program is
unable to offer scholarships. Hailing
from Creve, Missouri, Sagel has sur
prised his coach with his skill. "I was not
real familiar with his talent," said div
ing coach Rick Schavone, "but he has a
lot more than I'd have guessed. He's
definitely a national caliber diver if he
sticks with it."
Schavone seems to expand on what
ever talent he is given. "We convince
them that this is the place to come to be
a good diver," said Schavone. "It's hard
for us to get the best, but we get the next
level and make 'em better."
How much better remains to be
seen— this weekend Wightman and
Sagel will flip and twist against two of
the top divers in the nation when the
Cardinal battles with UCLA on Friday
and USC on Saturday at deGuerre Pool.
UCLA will be sporting Chris Dudka,
who finished Bth at NCAA's last year. If
the force is with Wightman on Friday,
he may overpower the top notch Bruin.
"He's strong but not as talented (as
Brian Early— USC)," said Wightman,

"I think I have a chance at him."
Brian Early of USC is a master on the
boards. He may be more than our
valiant heroes can handle. "He is one of
the top three sophomores in the
nation," said Wightman, "It'll be a very
tough day."
Not only do the Trojans have a domi
nator in the diving tank but they also
have an abundancy of talent in the pool.
The No. 2-ranked USC boasts a squad of
experienced international and national
competitors. "They don't seem to have a
weakness," said Kenney.
Will the Cardinal be able to find a soft
spot in the Trojan armor? Will the
dynamic diving duo be able to help jus
tice prevail for Stanford? Or will the evil
forces of Southern California dominate
at deGuerre? Stay tuned this afternoon
and tomorrow as the Cardinal wages
water war against the sun-baked boys
from the South.
Card Notes
World-class swimmer Jeff Rouse slipped
on the stairs Sunday night and broke his
wrist. He'll miss three weeks of competition
but will be working on leg conditioning in the
meantime. He's still planning to compete at
NCAA's.

astating departure of teammate Mark Kraus earlier in the season.
