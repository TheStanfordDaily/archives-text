# Women's tennis excels at Rolex

A list of winter destinations
for the average traveler would
likely include places like
Aruba, Ixtapa and St. Croix. It
would be unusual to see, say,
Minneapolis on that list.
Of course, the women's ten
nis team did not win five
straight national titles by being
average in any way — and
travel is no exception. Four
members of the team are cur
rently toiling away at the Rolex
National Indoor Champi
onships (in Minneapolis, of
course) and doing quite well,
thank you.
The nation's No. 1 player,
senior Sandra Birch, had the
easiest day of any member of
the Stanford contingent. The
tournament's top seed rolled
over Florida's Holly Lloyd, 6-2,
6-3 to advance into the second
round. Her next opponent is
Notre Dame's Tracy Barton, a
junior from Cincinnati who is
ranked 28th on the computer.
Should Birch beat Barton,
she and the other second
round winners will place twice
today with a berth in Satur
day's semifinals on the line.
Senior Teri Whitlinger
seems to have a good chance of
joining Birch in the final four.
She scored an easy 6-3, 6-3 win
over Jackie Moe, a highly
touted Texas freshman. Whit
linger gets a shot at revenge
today when she takes on Ari
zona's Danielle Scott.
In October's Riviera Ail-

American Tournament conso
lation final, Scott upset the
Stanford star. According to
sources in Minneapolis, Whit
linger is primed for the re
match.
If she wins, Whitlinger
could face Duke's Julie Exum
later in the day. Exum, the No.
2 seed at the Rolex, is bidding
for her second straight Inter
collegiate Tennis Coaches
Association Grand Slam title.
She won the DuPont National
Clay Court Championships.
Sophomore Heather Wil
lens, arguably the second-most
improved player in the nation
after Exum, survived a three
set thriller with Kentucky's
Melissa Nelson yesterday. Wil
lens gutted out the 6-4, 6-7, 6-3
win and gets a shot at San
Diego's Tonya Fuller this
morning.
A Willens win would proba
bly set her up to meet Geor
gia's Shannan McCarthy in the
quarterfinals. Willens upset
McCarthy at Riviera, and the
Bulldog junior, like Whitlinger,
is looking to avenge the early
season defeat.
In doubles action, Whit
linger and freshman Laxmi
Poruri took a pair of tiebreak
ers from Harvard's Amy
deLone and Jamie Henikoff.
The 7-6 (7-4), 7-6 (7-2) tri
umph earned the Stanford pair
a meeting with Carolyn Delisle
and Sally Godman of Okla
homa State. That veteran duo
upset defending Rolex champs
Susan Gilchrist and Joanna
Plautz of Texas yesterday.
