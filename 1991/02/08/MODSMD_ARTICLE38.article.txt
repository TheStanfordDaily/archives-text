# Smith, swimmers face No. 1 Longhorns
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Going into her senior season,
life as a Stanford swimmer wasn't
too great for Jody Smith. One
month after winning an NCAA
title as a member of Stanford's
800-yard freestyle relay team, she
developed tendinitis in both
shoulders.
She finished up the school year
and did very little all summer in
an effort to allow her shoulders to
heal, but it didn't help. So there
she was, starting her senior year
of college, and she couldn't swim.
"It was bad when I came back,"
she says."It hadn't gotten better.
. . . Six to eight weeks — I did
nothing. I spent more hours on
that darn stationary bike. . . . The
only thing I did was ice — spent a
lot of time at the training room,
my home away from home. I'm
Ail-American training room by
now.
"I just iced and iced and iced
and iced. They slowly got better."
And the story finally takes a
turn for the better.
"The best thing that might
have happened to me is I got
injured this summer," Smith says.
"I missed my first nationals ever
— not because I didn't want to
swim but I couldn't swim. Not
being able to go to the World
Championships qualifying meet
was rough. That made me look
forward to now, being able to get
back in it."
And she has come back in a big
way. She has had a very successful
season so far and has swum some
of her best unshaved times ever in
the freestyle and backstroke.
"Confidence-wise and swim
ming-wise it's the best collegiate

season," she says. "This is the
most positive I've ever been about
a season. I enjoy it more than ever.
The fun is back in it. I can work
harder because I enjoy working
harder now."
Smith will have a good chance
to make that hard work pay off
tonight when No. 2 Stanford
meets No. 1 Texas at the Texas
Swimming Center in Austin. Both
squads are undefeated and appear
to be the nation's best by a sub
stantial margin.

The Cardinal has won the last
two dual meets between the
schools handily. In 1989 Stanford
went on to win the NCAA title but
the Lady Longhorns upset the
Cardinal last March to reclaim the
crown.
"It's a good chance to swim
fast," Smith says of the dual meet.
"It's a really fast pool. . . . It's
important to win it (tonight) but
that's not our main goal. It's nice
to have it under your belt but it
doesn't matter compared to six

weeks from now (at NCAAs).
"Most of us were here when we
won it and almost all of us were
here when we lost. We know what
it's like to get just beat out, and
we don't like it. ... It's kind of
nice being the underdog again
because we have something to
prove."
Winning the NCAA title this
year would be especially sweet for
Smith for a pair of reasons. One,

she and Suzy Buckovich are the
team's captains this year.
Her other reason is that,
"unless I have a really big time
drop at NCAAs," she will hang up
her swimsuit after the meet.
"It still hasn't hit me yet that
there is an end," she says."I don't
know what to expect because I
haven't lived like that for a long
time. ... So much that I have
done is connected to swimming
but now that connection is going
to be gone."
But despite the uncertainty
after her career, she knows exactly
what she wants to finish up with
at NCAAs: "A happy ending."
