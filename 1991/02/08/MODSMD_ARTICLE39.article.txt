# Summer ball pays off big for Turner
## 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
Ryan Turner needed to play.
The 6-4 San Jose native had
come out of Gunderson High
School to find out that he might
be a little too big and slow for
third base, so his coaches tried to
teach him to play outfield and in
the meantime he sat. The prob
lem was that he was not a scrub.
Turner was a "reserve," which
meant he played enough to sniff

success, but never got enough
time to fully develop his skills.
For two years Ryan Turner sat
and watched, wondering when he
would get his chance.
"It's tough for anyone coming
out of high school (to play at Stan
ford)," Turner said, "With all the
talent they get out here, it is a
very humbling experience."
By the end of his sophomore
season, Ryan knew he had to
make his move. If he could not
play at Stanford, then he would

have to find an alternative. Not
desparate enough to leave school,
Turner looked to a summer
league, and with the help of head
coach Mark Marquess, found his
way to Liberal, Kansas. Then
things started to get better.
"What really turned me around
was the summer spent in Lib
eral," Tuner said. "After two
yeirs on the bench my confidence
w b shaken. I needed to get away
and prove I could play."
Like the Cape Cod League in
Massachusetts, Kansas' Jayhawk
League is a haven for college play
ers looking for a chance to play
ball in the off-season. The ball
parks are small, the people are
friendly, and the bats are wood
(colleges use aluminum). Pro
scouts are around, and the kids
get a chance to show their stuff in
games almost every day. It was
exactly what the man from San
Jose needed.
"Ryan was really able to get the
playing time he needed," Mar
guess said. "He was getting lots of
at-bats and was getting good com
petition. He was really able to
work on his concentration."
Fixed up with a family that
housed him for the two months he
spent on the prairie, Turner
would paint fences in the day for
some extra cash and then play ball
at night. Playing in the outfield
every evening helped Turner
develop the skills he had been
lacking back on the Farm. Ball
angles that he once could not
understand started to make more
sense, and his arm power was
strengthened. Best of all he got a
chance to hit. Turner never got a
chance to get in a groove at Stan
ford, getting up to the plate only
32 times in his first two years. In
Liberal, Turner got more than
100 at-bats, and he got the chance
to work with a wood bat for the
first time.
"It's hard to make the switch
from aluminum to wood, but it
helped my game a lot," Turner
said. "The wood bat has a small
ler sweet spot and is heavier at the
top, so I had to develop more hit
ting disipline while working on my
hand speed."
The result was a fond farewell
to the bench. Coming back to
Stanford for his junior year,
Turner had what Marquess called
a "great" fall, and took the start
ing position in left field from
Steve Solomon and Mike Eicher.
Finally able to show the collegiate

baseball world what he could do,
Turner did not disapoint. Emerg
ing as one of the best outfielders
in the Pacific Ten Conferance,
Ryan hit .335 with five home
runs, 34 runs-batted-in, and 10
stolen bases. Along the way he
was named to the All-Tournament
Team at the NCAA West I Rea
gional after leading Stanford with
.467 batting average.
"Ryan had a great year and was
one of the keys to our team last
year," Marquess said. "We will be
counting on him a lot this year."
Calling himself a good consis
tent hitter who neither hits for
power like teammate Dave
McCarty nor slaps the ball like the
Red Sox' Wade Boggs, Turner is
off to a slow start with a .227 aver
age, but is not concerned.
"I'm a notorious slow starter,"
Turner said. "The key to my hit
ting is timing and feeling comfort
able. I just haven't had enough
at-bats."
With Paul Carey, Troy Paulsen
and Tim Griffin gone to the pros,
Turner is left along with second
baseman Chris Kemper as the
team's only starting senior. On
the bench in Omaha when the
Cardinal last won the national
title in 1988, Turner has been
through a lot with the team and is
a leader by example.
"He's not real loud, not the
cheering type," Kemper said. "He
plays hard and keeps his head.
He's not a real emotional player
who will explode when he strikes
out. He just gets the job done."

coach Mark Marquess, found his
way to Liberal, Kansas. Then
things started to get better.
"What really turned me around
was the summer spent in Lib
eral," Tuner said. "After two
yeirs on the bench my confidence
w b shaken. I needed to get away
and prove I could play."
Like the Cape Cod League in
Massachusetts, Kansas' Jayhawk
League is a haven for college play
ers looking for a chance to play
ball in the off-season. The ball
parks are small, the people are
friendly, and the bats are wood
(colleges use aluminum). Pro
scouts are around, and the kids
get a chance to show their stuff in
games almost every day. It was
exactly what the man from San
Jose needed.
"Ryan was really able to get the
playing time he needed," Mar
guess said. "He was getting lots of
at-bats and was getting good com
petition. He was really able to
work on his concentration."
Fixed up with a family that
housed him for the two months he
spent on the prairie, Turner
would paint fences in the day for
some extra cash and then play ball
at night. Playing in the outfield
every evening helped Turner
develop the skills he had been
lacking back on the Farm. Ball
angles that he once could not
understand started to make more
sense, and his arm power was
strengthened. Best of all he got a
chance to hit. Turner never got a
chance to get in a groove at Stan
ford, getting up to the plate only
32 times in his first two years. In
Liberal, Turner got more than
100 at-bats, and he got the chance
to work with a wood bat for the
first time.
"It's hard to make the switch
from aluminum to wood, but it
helped my game a lot," Turner
said. "The wood bat has a small
ler sweet spot and is heavier at the
top, so I had to develop more hit
ting disipline while working on my
hand speed."
The result was a fond farewell
to the bench. Coming back to
Stanford for his junior year,
Turner had what Marquess called
a "great" fall, and took the start
ing position in left field from
Steve Solomon and Mike Eicher.
Finally able to show the collegiate

baseball world what he could do,
Turner did not disapoint. Emerg
ing as one of the best outfielders
in the Pacific Ten Conferance,
Ryan hit .335 with five home
runs, 34 runs-batted-in, and 10
stolen bases. Along the way he
was named to the All-Tournament
Team at the NCAA West I Rea
gional after leading Stanford with
.467 batting average.
"Ryan had a great year and was
one of the keys to our team last
year," Marquess said. "We will be
counting on him a lot this year."
Calling himself a good consis
tent hitter who neither hits for
power like teammate Dave
McCarty nor slaps the ball like the
Red Sox' Wade Boggs, Turner is
off to a slow start with a .227 aver
age, but is not concerned.
"I'm a notorious slow starter,"
Turner said. "The key to my hit
ting is timing and feeling comfort
able. I just haven't had enough
at-bats."
With Paul Carey, Troy Paulsen
and Tim Griffin gone to the pros,
Turner is left along with second
baseman Chris Kemper as the
team's only starting senior. On
the bench in Omaha when the
Cardinal last won the national
title in 1988, Turner has been
through a lot with the team and is
a leader by example.
"He's not real loud, not the
cheering type," Kemper said. "He
plays hard and keeps his head.
He's not a real emotional player
who will explode when he strikes
out. He just gets the job done."
