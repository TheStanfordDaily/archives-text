# WAR IN THE GULF
## Allies say ground war looks likely 
### 
DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) — Allied
strategists are talking less about whether a
ground war will be fought in the Persian Gulf
— and more about how and when. Comman
ders say the epic land battle would be on a scale
not seen since World War 11.
The air war against Iraq roared on without
letup today, but U.S. pilots say it is getting
harder to locate prime targets. Much of Iraq's
armor is hidden deep in bunkers, and Iraqi
ground forces are using decoys to fool allied
attackers.
U.S. bombers dubbed the "Scud patrol"
have been trying to zero in on Iraq's truck
mounted missile launchers. But they are an
elusive target; Iraq lobbed another of the rock
ets at the Saudi capital of Riyadh early today. It
was intercepted by a Patriot anti-missile
rocket, and no it\juries were reported.
On the frontier frontlines of northern Saudi
Arabia, U.S. soldiers are chilled by more than
the freezing nighttime temperatures. They are
well aware they are within range of Saddam's
mustard and nerve gas-filled artillery shells
and rocket warheads.
Even blowing sand — a constant of life in
the wintry desert — can set off the chemical
alarms. "You've never seen guys scramble for

their masks like we do out here,"
said Lt. Flip Hicks, a Ist Armored
Division platoon leader whose
unit is camped near the front. "A
lot of guys will even feel their
hands itching, like there was
really nerve gas in the air."
Marine Brig. Gen. Richard
Neal said the allied air campaign
was concentrating on "isolating
the battlefield" by severing Iraqi
lines of communication and hit
ting supply centers, roads and
bridges. But some reports say ren
dering roads and bridges impass
able is killing more and more civil
ians.
The Independent, a London
newspaper, today quoted an Iraqi

hospital director as saying nearly
50 civilians died when allied
bombers attacked a crowded
bridge in the Iraqi city of
Nasiriyeh, 250 miles south of
Baghdad.
Dr. Rabi Faroon, the British
trained director of the city's Sad
dam Hospital, told the newspaper
more than 100 civilians were hurt
when the bombers destroyed the
al-Nasir bridge over the
Euphrates river on Monday.
The United States has pledged
to do everything possible to pin
point military and strategic tar
gets. Asked about the bombing's
toll on civilians, command
spokesman Neal responded: "War
is a dirty business."
"Unfortunately, there will be

collateral damage," he said, using
the military euphemism for civil
ian casualties.
"The war can end tomorrow, if
Saddam Hussein will get out of
Kuwait," Cheney told the House
Armed Services Committee before
he left Washington yesterday with
Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
At the same time, top U.S. offi
cials made it clear that Saddam is
not part of their picture of post
war Iraq. Secretary of State
James Baker, testifying before the
Senate Foreign Relations Com
mittee on Thursday, talked of the
eventual reconstruction of Iraq,
now being hammered by tons of
allied bombs every hour.
