# Gymnasts host meet at Burnham
## 
### Brandi Shipp Staff writer 
Burnham Pavilion should be
shaking tonight for the Stanford
womens gymnastics team's sec
ond home meet of the year, as they
host the women from UC Davis,
lowa State, and Washington.
Despite the fact that they have
not competed in two weeks, the
Stanford women are confident
that they can outshine their com
petition. "We have seen Davis two
out of the last three weeks, so we
aren't too worried," head coach
Breck Greenwood said.
However, Greenwood admitted
that they did not have much infor
mation on the team from lowa
State. Despite the fact that the
Cyclones outscored the Stanford
women earlier in the year, the
Cardinal does not anticipate much
of a battle.

Washington, though, is quite a
different story. "Washington is a
lot like the Cal team, " Greenwood
said, "so basically, it's going to be
between Stanford and Washing
ton." Although Stanford, at num
ber 20, is ranked higher than the
other teams, Washington is not
far behind.
Since their last meet on Jan
uary 26, the Stanford team has
made a few minor changes in their
performances. "Kerri Kanuka
has added even more tumbling,"
Greenwood said. This freshman
phenom, one of their top all
arounders, walked away with a
9.7 and first place on floor two
weeks ago.
Sophomore Erin McCann,
injured for much of the season
will also be doing her first full bar
routine of the year, which should
assist the team tremendously in

that event. McCann has been bat
tling various foot and ankle prob
lems throughout the year, pre
venting her from being able to
perform a dismount on bars in
earlier competitions.
Despite the fact that these
changes should help the Cardinal
score, the team is not relying on
these minor alterations to put
them on top. "Most importantly,
we are just looking for better con
sistency and better perfor
mances," Greenwod said. After
their near record-breaking perfor
mance two weeks ago, the Stan
ford women hope to achieve an
even higher goal tonight. "Our
goal is to score 188.0 points,"
Greenwood said. "If we can put
together a perfect meet, then it is
a possibility."
The meet starts at 7:30 p.m. at
Burnham Pavilion.
