# Gymnasts look to regionals, NCAA's
## 
### Noah Blake Staff writer 
Last Friday's victory by the
Cardinal men's gymnastics
team was a highly successful
ending to the first phase of its
season, a stage in which Stan
ford Head Coach Sadao
Hamada was looking to
develop team consistency and
confidence on all six events
and hopefully keep everyone
healthy. But in the phase
which starts with Saturday
and Sunday's meets against
California, San Jose State, and
Kent State, the Cardinal has
much loftier goals.
From here on out, the team
will focus, both in practice and
in competition, on two dates:
March 22nd and April 6th, the
dates of the Pac-10 Champi
onships and NCAA Regionals,
respectively. Frequently dur
ing this phase, as is the case
this weekend, the Cardinal
gymnasts will face teams that
are not really a threat to beat
them. But Hamada hopes that
the team will maintain its
focus and continue to perform
well, even though Stanford's
opponents may not challenge
for meet victories.
"It's different from other
sports," says Hamada, "where
teams go out to beat the oppo
nent. But my approach is that
as long as my kids perform to
their maximum, there is no
such a thing as a opponent.
The opponents are the gym
nast himself and the appara

tus.
To attain and maintain this
maximum performance, which
will be required for the Cardi
nal to challenge for the NCAA
championship, the team must
overcome obstacles other than
opponent which are not quite
up to its level. "They have to
grind and get through a large
number of routines," Hamada
states, "so from now on it's
going to be very physically
demanding for them."
"Also, midterms and finals,
which will grind on them men
tally, are approaching, so I
have to be very careful with
their training. But I've got a
great bunch of kids, who are
very motivated and disci
plined, and I don't think we'll
have any problems."
The team will prepare for
March 22nd and April 6th with
two types of routines, each of
which have seperate purposes.
"We will be doing compulsory
routines, which polish up their
form, and a number of
optional routines which will
make their confidence go up
and make their routines more
consistent."
Although the team is look
ing far into the future during
practice, they are careful not
to forget that every meet,
including the ones Saturday at
lpm in Burnam Pavilion and
Sunday at Harmon Gym in
Berkeley, is an opportunity to
check out their progress, as
well as gain more competition
experience.
