### Brian Egan Staff writer 
The Stanford wrestling team
faces one of its toughest tests of
the season Saturday night, squar
ing off against Cal State-Bakers
field in Maples Pavilion.
After starting the season
slowly, the Cardinal (4-3-1 on the
year) has turned things around
over the past month, currently in
the midst of a three-match win
ning streak. The rise of several
Stanford wrestlers has been
instrumental in the team's resur
gence.
Phil Nowick, a 118-pounder,
has shown great improvement in
the second half of the season. The

sophomore's last two victories
have been particularly encourag
ing, as Nowick has won by scores
of 15-6 and 13-2. According to
coach Chris Horpel, Nowick "has
become a much more consistent
wrestler, and I'm beginning to
expect more and more from him."
Mark Graham, since returning
to action from a shoulder injury,
has also been outstanding. The
190-pound junior is coming off his
first 1991 tournament victory, a
convincing first place finish at the
All-California Invitational two
weeks ago. With a 14-4-0 overall
record, Graham has a strong shot
at qualifying for the NCAA Cham
pionships in March.
Stanford's three seniors,

James Dinette, Steve Buddie, and
Steve Yarbrough, have been
exceptional all season. Dinette, a
142-pounder, was the star of last
week's 25-17 victory over the
Chico State Wildcats. With Stan
ford down 11-0, Dinette scored a
come-from-behind 17-8 victory, a
decision win which reversed
the momentum of the meet.
Dinette has won six of his last
eight matches, and is third on the
team in victories with 15.
Buddie, a 167-pounder, has had
an outstanding season. The Ail-
American has been dominating
lately, and currently leads Stan
ford in falls and technical falls.
Since returning from a bursitis
injury in early January, Buddie

has not lost a single match and is
currently ranked sixth.
Yarbrough, co-captain along
with Buddie, has held the team
together this season. The 177-
pounder wrestled through 10 days
of illness in early January, and
leads the squad in victories with
24. Like Buddie, Yarbrough is
ranked sixth nationally in his
weight class.
Bakersfield, since joining the
wrestling branch of the Pacific-10
Conference in 1988, has fielded a
strong team every year. Last year,
the Roadrunners placed a close
second to NCAA-runner up Ari
zona State and won three individ
ual weight division champi
onships.
