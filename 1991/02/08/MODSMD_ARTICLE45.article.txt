# Greek Rap brings issues of acquaintance rape forward
## 
### John Snyder 
After less than a year, Greek Rap, a
new program focusing on acquaintance
rape for fraternities and sororities has
met wide acceptance among members of
the Greek community.
Many people who have participated in
the program said it has opened their eyes
and made a difference in their attitudes
toward acquaintance rape.
The program, which uses role playing
and other games to dramatize different
points of view and break down misconcep
tions about relations between men and
women, has been held six times this year.
Greek Rap focuses on "how men and
women in the same situation have really
different perceptions of what goes on,"
said program organizer Karen Kramer, a
junior. The sexes "operate according to
different rules [that] often cause miscom
munication which leads to rape," she
said.
In a typical session, about 40 sorority
and fraternity members are directed
through a series of role playings and dis
cussions by two volunteer facilitators —
one male and one female — both of whom
belong to Greek organizations. Kramer

said, "They don't try to moralize they
say that they just want you to be aware."
Kramer noted a diversity of reactions
among participants. While some people
are accepting of the program, others
"start off initially very resistant," she
said.
"But by the end [participants] start
saying things like 'Wow, that makes
sense,'" she said. "This is what I would
consider the ideal reaction."
"With some others you wonder if any
thing would get through to them," she
said.
"I think the program is important,"
said Brian Spaulding, a Phi Delta Theta
member who participated in the program
during fall quarter. "We pretty much just
rapped about how miscommunication
often leads to problems."
Junior Ashley Fieglein, a Kappa Alpha
Theta member who has attended three of
the workshops, said she was "sometimes
surprised" by the attitudes of men in the
discussions, but she felt that they were
"definitely honest."
Although response to the program has
been generally positive, some participants
have expressed reservations.
Spaulding said the program was

"worthwhile" but wished for smaller
groups that would give participants a
greater opportunity to discuss the issues
more comprehensively.
Senior Geoff Ballew, the resident assis
tant for Beta Theta Pi, was also critical of
the program. The discussions often raised
important issues but then left them unre
solved, he said.
"I like the idea of the program because
someone is trying to do something, but
... most of the comments I felt were very
stereotypical. Not much thought was
given to whether we were perpetuating
stereotypes," he said.
"I kind of see it as a self-serving pat on
the back," he added.
Sixteen of Stanford's 23 Greek organi
zations have participated in the program.
Interfraternity Council President Eric
Jorgensen said all of the Greek organiza
tions decided last quarter to invite Greek
Rap to run the program for their mem
bers at least once this year. All 23 organi
zations contributed to the program's cost.
The program focuses on communica
tion, placing the burden of responsibility
on women as well as men. "Clearly there
are things that both sexes can do,"
Kramer said. "For the women there is the

'Alcohol is often a factor in
acquaintance rape
because it makes commu
nication more difficult. It is
hard for the man to be
aware of what a woman is
trying to communicate.'

issue of clarity — saying clearly, 'No.' And
for the men, it is being receptive to that,
and being aware that 'no' always means
'no.'"
A major goal of the program is to
develop awareness about the dangerous
influence of alcohol.
"Alcohol is often a factor in acquain
tance rape because it makes communica
tion more difficult," Kramer said. "It is
hard for the man to be aware of what a
woman is trying to communicate."
Many male participants are shocked to
realize that according to the California
penal code, intercourse "where the per
son is prevented from resisting by any

intoxicating or anesthetic substance, or
any controlled substance, administered
by or with the knowledge of the accused"
is considered rape, she said.
Kramer came up with the idea for a
rape-awareness program for the Greek
system last winter when she was a repre
sentative to the Sexual Assault Task
Force, which recently issued a report call
ing for greater attention to sexual assault
issues.
A program like Greek Rap was neces
sary because "it is very common to pin
point the Greek system as a high-risk
area," she said. The problem could best be
addressed by a Greek-coordinated initia
tive that would promote communication
and responsible action rather than defen
siveness, she added.
Greek Rap was developed after consul'
tation with Jerry Talley, a Stanford gen
der psychiatrist who teaches a popular
class on the Etiquette of Sex.
Kramer said she is optimistic about
the program's future. "This is an issue
which needs to be brought up and needs
attention and discussion. I don't know if
it's really going to change behavior, but at
least it plants a seed of awareness," she
said.

among participants. While some people
are accepting of the program, others
"start off initially very resistant," she
said.
"But by the end [participants] start
saying things like 'Wow, that makes
sense,'" she said. "This is what I would
consider the ideal reaction."
"With some others you wonder if any
thing would get through to them," she
said.
"I think the program is important,"
said Brian Spaulding, a Phi Delta Theta
member who participated in the program
during fall quarter. "We pretty much just
rapped about how miscommunication
often leads to problems."
Junior Ashley Fieglein, a Kappa Alpha
Theta member who has attended three of
the workshops, said she was "sometimes
surprised" by the attitudes of men in the
discussions, but she felt that they were
"definitely honest."
Although response to the program has
been generally positive, some participants
have expressed reservations.
Spaulding said the program was

"worthwhile" but wished for smaller
groups that would give participants a
greater opportunity to discuss the issues
more comprehensively.
Senior Geoff Ballew, the resident assis
tant for Beta Theta Pi, was also critical of
the program. The discussions often raised
important issues but then left them unre
solved, he said.
"I like the idea of the program because
someone is trying to do something, but
... most of the comments I felt were very
stereotypical. Not much thought was
given to whether we were perpetuating
stereotypes," he said.
"I kind of see it as a self-serving pat on
the back," he added.
Sixteen of Stanford's 23 Greek organi
zations have participated in the program.
Interfraternity Council President Eric
Jorgensen said all of the Greek organiza
tions decided last quarter to invite Greek
Rap to run the program for their mem
bers at least once this year. All 23 organi
zations contributed to the program's cost.
The program focuses on communica
tion, placing the burden of responsibility
on women as well as men. "Clearly there
are things that both sexes can do,"
Kramer said. "For the women there is the

issue of clarity — saying clearly, 'No.' And
for the men, it is being receptive to that,
and being aware that 'no' always means
'no.'"
A major goal of the program is to
develop awareness about the dangerous
influence of alcohol.
"Alcohol is often a factor in acquain
tance rape because it makes communica
tion more difficult," Kramer said. "It is
hard for the man to be aware of what a
woman is trying to communicate."
Many male participants are shocked to
realize that according to the California
penal code, intercourse "where the per
son is prevented from resisting by any

intoxicating or anesthetic substance, or
any controlled substance, administered
by or with the knowledge of the accused"
is considered rape, she said.
Kramer came up with the idea for a
rape-awareness program for the Greek
system last winter when she was a repre
sentative to the Sexual Assault Task
Force, which recently issued a report call
ing for greater attention to sexual assault
issues.
A program like Greek Rap was neces
sary because "it is very common to pin
point the Greek system as a high-risk
area," she said. The problem could best be
addressed by a Greek-coordinated initia
tive that would promote communication
and responsible action rather than defen
siveness, she added.
Greek Rap was developed after consul'
tation with Jerry Talley, a Stanford gen
der psychiatrist who teaches a popular
class on the Etiquette of Sex.
Kramer said she is optimistic about
the program's future. "This is an issue
which needs to be brought up and needs
attention and discussion. I don't know if
it's really going to change behavior, but at
least it plants a seed of awareness," she
said.
