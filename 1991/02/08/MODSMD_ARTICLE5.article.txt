# Tuition, board bills to rise again in 1991-92
## Combined increase is lowest since 1968-69 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
Undergraduates will have to pay $15,102
to attend classes at Stanford in 1991-92, an
increase of 5.75 percent over this year's
tuition costs.
The increase, pending approval by the
Board of Trustees next week, is roughly the
same as last year and outpaces the rate of
inflation by about one percent.
The trustees are also expected to pass a
room-and-board increase of 3.9 percent,
bringing the charge to $6,160. The rise will
be significantly less than in recent years,
however. Last year the cost jumped 6 per
cent.
Provost James Rosse attributed the
slower growth in room-and-board costs to
the effective budget cutting and cost con
tainment in Housing and Food Service. He
praised the efforts of Keith Guy, the office's
director.
Administrators say the increase in com
bined costs — tuition plus room and board
— will be the smallest since 1968-69. Next
year's $21,262 figure represents a 5.2 per
cent increase over this year.
Despite the University's budget prob
lems, administrators have pledged to keep
tuition increases to a minimum. Last fall,
University President Donald Kennedy said

the public would no longer tolerate tuition
costs that greatly outpace inflation.
The late 1980s saw increases of between
6 and 8 percent for most years.
Tuition and fees are the greatest source
of revenue in the University's $400 million
operating budget, accounting for 43 percent
of these funds.
Stanford's total costs have hovered right
around the same mark as those of its com
petitors. In 1989-90, for example, tuition,
room and board cost $19,164 at Stanford,
$19,395 at Harvard University, $19,310 at
Yale University, $19,355 at MIT and
$19,207 at Princeton University.
