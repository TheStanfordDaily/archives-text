# Ban of the Dead will not be lifted
## 
### Miranda Doyle Staff writer 
Although many students have
apparently expected the Univer
sity to allow the Grateful Dead to
return to campus, administrators
said Wednesday they will still not
allow the band to play here.
Acting Dean of Student Affairs
Norm Robinson said the Univer
sity's decision last year not to
allow the band to perform a spring
concert in Frost Amphitheater
has not changed.
The University banned the
Dead after 29 fans at its 1989 per
formance were arrested outside
Frost for drug- and alcohol
related offenses.
Colin Hubbard, co-founder of a
student group formed last spring
to protest the ban, said Tuesday
he believed the University would
allow a Dead concert in the near
future.
But Robinson said he has not
been contacted about the issue in
more than six months and has not
approved any new proposals for a
Dead concert. "I would not want
[the students] to spend a whole lot
of time on [planning a concert]
since the likelihood of it being
allowed is remote," he said.
Last year, then-Dean of Stu
dent Affairs James Lyons held a
series of discussions with Hub
bard and his group, "We Need A
Miracle," to discuss plans for solv
ing the drug and alcohol prob
lems.
Lyons said he "laid out some of
the concerns" at the first meeting,
including drug use, health, sanita
tion and security concerns.
During the second discussion,
Lyons asked the students to write
a proposal addressing these con
cerns. The plans they came up
with "looked good," Lyons said.
"They did a good job."
After the discussions, Lyons
wrote a letter to the students

which read, in part, "I write to
commend you for the good work
that you have done to seek to rein
state the Grateful Dead concert at
Stanford, and to approve your
request to proceed to plan a con
cert for the 1990-91 school year."
"No decision was made to have
the concert again, but I was
encouraging," Lyons explained.
The letter also asked the stu
dent group to coordinate specific
plans with the Concert Network.
Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Herrington also said Lyon's letter
was not a definitive statement lift
ing the ban. "[The students] have
got to come up with convincing
arguments that things would be
different," he said.
Herrington added he thought
the letter suggested there were
still many problems with the con
cert, but people were willing to lis
ten and try to resolve them.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Michael Jackson said the Univer
sity needs more information
before making any decisions on
the matter. "There are still some
outstanding issues," he said.
Concert Network Director
Mary Escobedo said Tuesday she
has been working with students
and the University for the last
year in an attempt to bring the
band back to campus.
However, neither Hubbard nor
Escobedo would comment on
whether they plan to meet with
University administrators to seek
permission for a concert.
