To avoid war, Political Science Prof.
Hubert Marshall had to go to a public service
camp. History Prof. Paul Seaver spent time
in prison. And Assoc. Communication Prof.
Jeremy Cohen worked at the local YMCA.
The professors, who refused to serve dur
ing World War 11, the Korean War, and the
Vietnam War, respectively, had experiences
as draft resistors and conscientious objectors
that illustrate some different ways policy
makers and the public have dealt with resis
tance to military service.
During World War 11, the military did not
want to deal with objectors, Marshall said.
Although they were drafted through the
Selective Service system, they were not
required to report to induction centers.
Instead, objectors were assigned to special
public service camps.
"I was assigned to Civilian Public Service
Camp No. 16," Marshall said.
Camp No. 16, in Pennsylvania, was run
by a unique alliance between the govern
ment and the Brethren Church, he said. The
men worked for the U.S. Forest Service, but
their food and clothing were provided by
members of the church.
The "Selective Service also made sure
that you were sent to a camp far from your
home, so you couldn't go home on week
ends," Marshall said.
The men worked for about eight-and-a
half hours a day, six days a week and were
paid $2.50 per month. "For a while, I worked
in a gravel pit, shoveling gravel into a truck,"
he said.
"We were about 10 miles from the nearest
town, and the townspeople wouldn't pick us
up when we tried to hitchhike," he added.
"They did not like us."
After about three months, Marshall was
transferred to another camp, in Bowie, Md.,
to work for the Fish and Wildlife Service and
the Forest Service. He said people at that
camp were better educated and conducted
scientific agricultural research for the gov

ernment.
Attitudes toward objectors during World
War II were varied, Marshall said. For exam
ple, when servicemen learned how little
objectors were paid and how their lives were
restricted, they actually preferred the ser
vice, he said.
Members of Congress did not like them,
Marshall said. And, he added, the U.S. Gov
ernment tried to keep the conscientious
objector camps invisible from the public.
During the Korean War eight years later,
Seaver refused to register in accordance with
his Quaker beliefs.
In 1950, the year the war began, the head
of the draft board visited both Seaver and his
twin brother to convince them to apply for
conscientious-objector status. To do this,
however, the young men had to register with
the government.
"It was our feeling that registration itself
was cooperation with a system [that was] not
designed to give CO classifications, but
rather to draft our friends into the military,"
Seaver said.
Although they refused to fill out the gov
ernment registration forms, they were sent
notices to report for induction and a physical
examination. When they refused to respond
to these notices, they "had a visit from the
FBI," Seaver said.
Seaver and his brother, who were fresh
men at Haverford College in Pennsylvania,
were arrested and told to report at the fed
eral courthouse for arraignment. A friend of
the family put up his farm as bail, and the
Sea vers were released.
Three months later, they were sentenced
to 18 months in prison. Initially they were
placed in a county jail in Philadelphia and a
few weeks later shipped to a larger Federal
prison in New York. "[lt] was not a happy
prison," Seaver said.
From New York, they were transported to
a correction institution in Connecticut for
six-and-a-half months. They were eventually
released on parole, although the brothers
still refused to register.

They went back to college and received
forms from the draft board again. "We went
through the whole process again, [including!
a second trial," Seaver said.
The judge at this trial perceived the futil
ity of the process. He told the prosecutors
and the Seavers that they had established
their respective positions, and he sentenced
the brothers to one day in prison, Seaver
said.
"It was obvious that the judge, looking at
the reporters in the room, felt under great
pressure to give us a sentence. Community
pressures were very much against this kind
of attitude," said Seaver.
Cohen, an associate professor of
communication, said community percep
tions of objectors during the Vietnam War
were also very negative.
"San Francisco was one of the few places
tat] that time where you could be a [consci
entious objector) and people didn't look
down on you for it,"he added.
Cohen registered at age 18 as a conscien
tious objector, and a year later, in 1970, the
draft board denied his claim. Although he
was eligible for a student deferment, he
decided that "was not a very moral way to
proceed," he said.
He took the physical examination and
"unfortunately passed it,"he said. He then
received a letter from the draft board order
ing him to report to fight in two weeks.
"I sent them a letter and said 'No thank
you.' I said 1 will not go into the army, nor
will I leave the country. You can either draft
me on [conscientious objector] status or you
can send me to jail," he said.
The draft board subjected him to a "talk"
to change his mind. They tried various emo
tional strategies, he said, such as asking
"What if your grandmother were killed?"
The draft board then required Cohen to
find a satisfactory alternative service. He
worked for the San Francisco YMCA, run
ning a drop-in center for 20 hours a week
and doing draft counseling another 20 hours
a week.
