# Prof. discusses mysteries of urban legends
## 
### Tom Costello 
Urban legends are stories that
most everyone has heard in one
form or another. They are sup
posed to be true, and they always
seem to have happened to a friend
of a friend. But somehow, when
you try to track them down, you
can rarely find the original source.
This modern mythology was
the subject of a talk given by Uni
versity of Utah Prof. Jan Brun
vand last night in Branner
Lounge. Brunvand is an interna
tional authority on contemporary

folklore.
Stories about the alligators
that are supposed to infest the
sewers of New York — purport
edly the result of flushing a baby
alligator down a toilet — and little
dogs brought back from Mexico
that turn out to be rats, are sur
prisingly widespread and resilient
myths, Brunvand said.
These stories, in many differ
ent forms, occur all over the
world, he said. The Mexican
puppy can turn up as a Thai dog in
Italy or a Faroe Island sewer rat in
Innsbruck, Austria, he added.

Many of the stories have no
basis in truth, he said. However,
Brunvand did note one urban leg
end for which he had found the
source.
It concerns the story of a stu
dent who arrives late to an exam
to find three math problems on
the board. He finds the first two
easy, but just manages to finish
the last in time. The professor
later tells him the three were not
the exam but were actually
famous unsolved problems.
This incident actually hap
pened to Statistics Prof. George

Dantzig, who was-present at the
discussion last night. Dantzig said
he once answered two previously
unsolved problems that he
thought were homework prob
lems.
Dantzig left the solutions on
his professor's desk. Six weeks
later, when the professor finally
read them, he rushed to Dantzig
to tell him what he had achieved.
And when the time came for his
doctoral thesis the professor told
him to simply write an introduc
tion to his "homework" and put
the two answers in a folder.
