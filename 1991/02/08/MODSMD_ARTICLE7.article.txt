# Joint celebration planned for parents and founders
## 
### Robin Mathison 
One month from this weekend, parents visiting
Stanford will have more to do than tour their chil
dren's dorms and go to the top of Hoover Tower.
They will also be welcomed by Centennial festivities
ranging from commemorative speeches to a 1890s
theme ball.
While Parent's Weekend usually takes place in
the fall, this year the event is being merged with
Founders' day, which celebrates the birthday of
Leland Stanford Sr. and the University's founding,
both of which took place on March 9.
"We're looking at the whole weekend as one
event," said Sally Pinkner, who coordinates student
volunteers for the Centennial Celebration.
"Since it's the Centennial year, we thought it
would be very fitting to combine the two events,"
she added.
"The Stanfords were very much into family, and
since they lost their son they wanted to make the
children of California their children," she explained.
Susan Wolfe, assistant director of the Centennial
Celebration, said, "We wanted to enhance Founders'
Day for the Centennial year to include parents. We
want to involve as many people in our Centennial
Celebration as possible. We want to extend the cele
bration from the Stanford family to the students'
families."
Highlighting Founders' Day this year is a com
memorative ceremony and slide-show in Memorial
Auditorium. English Prof. Emeritus Wallace Steg
ner, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his novel "Angles
of Repose," will be the keynote speaker. Stegner, who
founded the Creative Writing Program, will present
a description of the Stanford family in the American
West.
Stegner, who taught students such as writer Ken
Kesey in the late 19505, is a "real heavyweight,

student community," Wolfe said.
University President Donald
Kennedy, President Emeritus
Richard Lyman and KGO-TV
anchor Anna Chavez, who gradu
ated in 1976, will also speak.
To commemorate Stanford's
first century, a quilt created espe
cially for the Centennial Celebra
tion will be unveiled and dedi
cated. The fabric used to weave it
together is imprinted with the
centennial logo and each square
depicts a Stanford scene, such as

Memorial Church or Stanford
Stadium.
"Quilting is traditionally an
American folk art, so it is fitting
that the University, founded in
the American West, would be
commemorated by it," said Wolfe.
It creates a "linkage, between the
American West and the tradition
that comes on this soil."
After the Memorial Audito
rium ceremony a traditional pro
cession will lead spectators to the
inside of the Mausoleum, which is
only open to the public on
Founders' Day. This event is "like
a birthday party," Wolfe said.
"After all, it's Leland Stanford's
birthday. There'll be cake and
punch."

The Mausoleum is "really
quite beautiful, an interesting
thing to see," said Pinkner. The
building is constructed of marble
and the coffins of the Stanford
family are "all identical, right
next to each other. You can walk
in between [them]."
An 1890s-theme Founders'
Day ball, open to students, par
ents and faculty, will be held Sat
urday night in Burnham Pavilion.
This informal event will feature
music from 1890 to 1990, and
tickets will be at the 1890 price of
$3.
Photo concessions will be pro
vided to "offer guests the oppor

tunity to be photographed with
cardboard cutouts of the Stan
fords. A family portrait of their
family and yours," said Wolfe.
Wolfe said she believes the
additional festivities will not
detract from Parent's Weekend.
One parent said she looks forward
to the added activities of the com
bined weekend.
But Elaine Sinnock, who is
planning to come from San Diego
to visit her son Ryan, doesn't plan
to attend every event. "We'd
rather spend the time with
Ryan," she said.
"It's fun to visit when all the
other parents are there," Sinnock
said.
