One month from this weekend, parents visiting
Stanford will have more to do than tour their chil
dren's dorms and go to the top of Hoover Tower.
They will also be welcomed by Centennial festivities
ranging from commemorative speeches to a 1890s
theme ball.
While Parent's Weekend usually takes place in
the fall, this year the event is being merged with
Founders' day, which celebrates the birthday of
Leland Stanford Sr. and the University's founding,
both of which took place on March 9.
"We're looking at the whole weekend as one
event," said Sally Pinkner, who coordinates student
volunteers for the Centennial Celebration.
"Since it's the Centennial year, we thought it
would be very fitting to combine the two events,"
she added.
"The Stanfords were very much into family, and
since they lost their son they wanted to make the
children of California their children," she explained.
Susan Wolfe, assistant director of the Centennial
Celebration, said, "We wanted to enhance Founders'
Day for the Centennial year to include parents. We
want to involve as many people in our Centennial
Celebration as possible. We want to extend the cele
bration from the Stanford family to the students'
families."
Highlighting Founders' Day this year is a com
memorative ceremony and slide-show in Memorial
Auditorium. English Prof. Emeritus Wallace Steg
ner, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his novel "Angles
of Repose," will be the keynote speaker. Stegner, who
founded the Creative Writing Program, will present
a description of the Stanford family in the American
West.
Stegner, who taught students such as writer Ken
Kesey in the late 19505, is a "real heavyweight,
