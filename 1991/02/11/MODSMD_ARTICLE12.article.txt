### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Three men were
charged with attempting to bomb a Norfolk,
Va., tank storage facility containing
flammable chemicals as part of a plot to collect
insurance money, the FBI said yesterday.
Charles Gresham, 57, was arrested early
yesterday in Ellicott City, Md., and was being
held in Baltimore. He was accused of partici
pating in the plot along with two men taken
into custody in Arizona on Friday night, the
FBI said.
Gresham was charged with conspiracy to
use explosives to commit mail and wire fraud

in connection with an attempt to recover
insurance money for chemicals he had stored
in rented tanks at the Norfolk facility, the FBI
said.
Also charged were Joseph Openshaw, 36, of
St. Johns, Ariz., and Cecil Ross, 31, of Glen
dale, Ariz. The two men were being held by the
FBI in Phoenix.
FBI Director William Sessions said in a
statement that federal law enforcement agen
cies will "vigorously and relentlessly pursue
all criminal acts, particularly when committed
by those who might try to take advantage of

an environment of heightened concern
because of the Gulf war."
The arrests came a day after federal
authorities said they had officially eliminated
terrorism as a motive for the attempted bomb
ing.
The discovery of the bombs attached to two
tanks at the Allied Terminals Inc., not far
from the Norfolk Naval Base, had led to fears
that they had been left by terrorists.
The company that owns the terminal rents
tanks to other businesses for storage of chem
icals.
