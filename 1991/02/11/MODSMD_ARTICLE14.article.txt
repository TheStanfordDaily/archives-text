'Culture Fest' will prove
to be positive, inclusive,
enlightening — and fun

The inclusion of a
"Centennial Culture Fest" in
the activities of this year's
Centennial Celebration is a boon
for the Stanford community.
The event, as proposed by the
Council of Presidents, will be an
informal celebration of culture,
resembling a street fair. There will
be food, drinks and entertainment,
and all of the campus' ethnic
groups will be invited to partici
pate.
The informal setting of the pro
gram will broaden its appeal. It will
be a valuable complement to "The
Fire Within" and other multicul
tural activities.
It will also put forth a positive
and inclusive multicultural mes
sage. In the past, students have
been troubled by the tone of the
presentation of multiculturalism:
at Orientation, in the residences
and at "The Fire Within." Multi
cultural events have been criticized
for being exclusionary, dogmatic
and political.
Hopefully, the "Culture Fest"
and future multicultural activities
will render these sentiments
unjustified. Ideally, the event will
welcome the participation of every
one on campus, enfranchising all
ethnic backgrounds.
The fact that the event will inte
grate all the different ethnic repre
sentatives in one setting is signifi
cant. The mood will be one not of
separatism, but of cross-cultural
interaction. Emphasis must be not
on politics but on the celebration of
culture and individual diversity.
Similarly, "The Fire Within," an
Orientation activity in which Stan
ford's largest minority ethnic

groups — the Black Student
Union, Asian American Student
Association, the Stanford Ameri
can Indian Organization and
MEChA, a Chicano/Latino student
group — celebrated their cultural
heritage through song, dance and
entertainment, could be a welcome
part of every year's programming.
Unfortunately, the Council of
Presidents and other individuals
have tried in the past to turn "The
Fire Within" into a political plat
form. Accusatory speeches and the
endorsement of the United Stan
ford Workers have ruined the posi
tive multicultural message that
might have been communicated.
But if handled correctly, "The
Fire Within" is a valuable and
enjoyable way for the ethnic groups
on campus to reach out to incoming
students.
The "Culture Fest" and"The
Fire Within", if handled with dis
cretion, will help Stanford realize
the twin goals of multiculturalism:
cultural awareness and integra
tion. The preservation of an indi
vidual culture does necessitate cer
tain activities directed primarily at
those of a specific cultural back
ground.
But ethnic groups at their best
will also foster activities which wel
come the community as a whole.
Such activities teach different
groups to live with and appreciate
each other.
The timing of the "Culture
Fest," during Pro Fro Week, will
give prospective Stanford students
a true taste of our campus' ethnic
diversity, making minority stu
dents feel welcome and communi
cating a positive message to all
prospective Stanford students.
The "Culture Fest" and"The
Fire Within" serve important pur
poses on campus.
Events like these should become
intrinsic to our community.
