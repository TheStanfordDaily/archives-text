## Balancing the checkbook 
### 
LAST WEEK'S GRIM FINANCIAL
news only confirmed what many of
us had already feared: This Univer
sity is going to hell in a handbasket — if it
can afford one.
Only two short years ago, Stanford
was sitting on top of the world — boasting
the most expensive government con
tracts, setting fund-raising records
through the Centennial Campaign, and
winning U.S. News and World Report
beauty pageants in all different cate
gories, including the swimsuit competi
tion.
Like all Utopias, that world is crum
bling around us. As if the Western Cul
ture debate didn't do enough to damage
our reputation, the recent indirect costs
debacle threatens to do much more.
Who's going to give money to a university
that can't keep track of its own books?
Stanford's spiraling budget woes
began in 1988 and 1989 when Provost
James Rosse announced projected budget
"shortfalls" of $5 million and $11 million
respectively. Later in 1989, the University
had the "foresight" to realize potentially
serious financial straits that lay ahead
unless budget cuts happened soon. Then
an earthquake hit and the University an
unforeseeable $170 million or so in repair
bills.
All these events led to budget cutting,
"repositioning" or financial chaos —
whichever description you prefer. First,
the University cut $22 million from the
budget, supposedly to get us back to even-
Steven by next school year. Earlier this
year, another $5 million in cuts was
announced. Now, Rosse says millions

more in cuts will be needed because of
decreasing indirect costs and lower
returns on University investments.
The University's situation appears
increasingly parallel to that of the United
States: Both are suffering major wounds
that administrators try to heal with hun
dreds of little Band-Aids. Not surpris
ingly, it's not working.
Financially, Stanford faces the unde
sirable prospect of needing to increase
revenues without having any viable
sources. The University's tuition is
already one of the highest in the country,
while room and board costs set the
national standard. The University's
endowment probably won't fare too well
in the current recession, even if no one
will admit the recession is there. The
Centennial Celebration fund-raising cam
paign can't be sustained for another 100
years, and I'd be more than a bit sur
prised to see the indirect cost rate move
up any time soon.
What revenue-raising prospects does
that leave us with? Maybe the "Stanford
Bankruptcy Telethon" depicted in last
year's Gaieties would be appropriate.
Whatever the solution, we need a lot of
money and we need it soon.
Until then, the University must come
to grips with the hard road ahead. That
means three things:
• We can't roll over and play dead on
the indirect cost issue. Apparently, Stan
ford and other universities are generally
playing by the rules, but the rules are
screwed up. Government investigators
are treating this national problem like the
NCAA handles errant college football pro

grams: knock off the big guns and ignore
the inherent structures that are the real
problem. It's time for the University to
take the offensive, and last week's
announcements of outside financial and
public relations help is a good first step.
• Stanford can't be everything for
everybody. We can't have the best profes
sors in every department and the best
researchers in every field. We can't afford
every Rolls Royce on the market. We also
can't be the center of the academic uni
verse, playing host to a score of research
centers, each with its own acronym.
• Some heads are going to have to roll.
Budget cuts can't be made without people
losing their jobs, and that means adminis
trators and, staff members. Unfortu
nately, Stanford can't afford to be a haven
for everyone who wants to be involved in
educating tomorrow's leaders.
Unless people start facing up to these
realities, Stanford may see the following
epitaph sooner than expected: "Here lies
Stanford University, 1891-1991. Once the
nation's greatest institution of higher
learning, the University suffered an
untimely death because it couldn't bal
ance its checkbook."

A senior majoring in political science,
Tim Marklein can't balance his check
book either. But at least he's using his
own money.
