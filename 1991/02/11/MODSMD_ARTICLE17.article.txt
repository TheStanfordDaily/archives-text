## Dead were never banned from playing at Stanford 
### 
AS DIRECTOR OF THE Stanford
Concert Network, I have several
bones to pick with the The Daily
about the Feb. 6 article on the Grateful
Dead, "Ban on rock band could soon be
Dead." The article includes several state
ments that seem to be misunderstand
ings on either the reporter's part or on
the part of her source, and I feel they
should be cleared up for the benefit of
those involved.
First of all, the Dead were not banned
from Stanford. True, University officials,
along with the Stanford Police Depart
ment, decided it would not be in the best
interests of the University to have them
return without some changes being
made in the way the concerts were run.
However, at the same time, the Grate
ful Dead and Bill Graham Presents also
decided it would be best not to return to
Stanford, at least for 1990, until some of
the problems that concerned the Univer
sity, such as illegal vending and camping
and flagrant drug visibility, could be
addressed. It was an agreement, not a

ban; since the Dead did not ask to come
here, the University could not have
denied them anything.
Secondly, there was never a national
press release issued "out of the blue" by
either the University or the Stanford
Police. The reason the decision spread to
papers across the country was most
likely because outside papers picked it up
from The Daily's story.
Thirdly, the University has had no
official change of policy about the Dead
and the Dead, as of this date, have not
changed their policy on Stanford.
Although I have been discussing the
issues with University officials (includ
ing former Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons and Acting Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Norm Robinson), and there
has been some progress on addressing
their concerns, there have been no clear
decisions and, therefore, no plans are in
the works to bring the Dead back to cam
pus at this time.
Also, as Capt. Raoul Niemeyer stated,
the Stanford Police still have safety con-

cerns about the concerts at Frost
Amphitheater. However, like the other
University representatives, they were
also open to discussion and Capt. Marvin
Moore was very helpful by suggesting
plans that might curb illegal activities.
From what I have seen in the past
year, the Grateful Dead are as concerned
with the above issues and with their fans
as the University is about the "undesir
able element," as Niemeyer puts it.
Although I cannot speak for the band,
I have kept track of their other engage
ments around the country and Europe,
and I can safely say they are addressing

those problems that have plagued their
shows in the past. It is because of this
concern for their fans and for their host
communities that they are cracking
down on these illegal activities outside
their shows, as reported by numerous
newspapers around the country.
Although there are still some reserva
tions, the University has been very open
to ideas on the Grateful Dead concerts. If
the shows do not happen this year it will
be because both the University and the
Grateful Dead do not feel it is in the best
interest of Dead fans.
We have been privileged to have such
a musical institution as the Grateful
Dead be part of our history and let us be
part of theirs, and although we would
welcome them back with open arms, we
respect their decision to refrain from
returning for another year, if indeed they
choose to do so.
Which is not to say we won't keep try
