# Admissions should not compromise for underprivileged

IHAD THE GREAT DISPLEASURE
of reading Delia Ibarra's Feb. 7 col
umn, "Feeling out of place here."
Ibarra blames Stanford for not admit
ting more "students of color from the
inner city." She implies that in order to
prove its diversity, Stanford should
accept more inner city students. Is she
asking the Office of Undergraduate
Admissions to lower its standards so that
she may feel more at home? This idea
seems ludicrous to me.
Stanford is known throughout the
world as one of the premiere institutions
of higher education. Each new entering
class is comprised of some of the
smartest young men and women in the
world.

One cannot blame Stanford for not
admitting more students from the inner
city. Most inner city schools are a sham
and many graduating students are a sad
tribute to deteriorating educational pro
grams. This is unfortunate and is cer
tainly a problem that must be addressed.
However, it is not Stanford's job to
accept students that are not ready for
the rigors of a Stanford education just so
that we may claim cultural diversity.
Stanford would not only be cheating you
and me, it would also be cheating those
students.
Bravo to Ibarra for figuring out that
her friend would not have transferred
from Stanford if he had been happy here.
She is quite the sleuth. True, some stu

dents find Stanford is not what they had
bargained for and choose to pursue an
education elsewhere. I would hope that
Ibarra realizes this is true at all universi
ties.
One might point out the fact that stu
dents also transfer to Stanford as well as
away. I don't think there is a university
in existence that can make all of its stu
dents happy all of the time. If Ibarra can
find one, I would be very interested to
learn about it. Maybe next she could find
Utopia, then possibly the lost Garden of
Eden.
Ibarra claims to be a wholehearted
supporter of multiculturalism. If this is
true she might like to stop comparing

Stanford to a country club. She herself
admits she has never been to one. She
says,"I have never been to a country
club, but I suppose that if I ever did see
one from the inside, it would probably
look a lot like Stanford." Wrong you are.
I have seen the inside of a few country
clubs and I can tell you from my
experiences Stanford looks nothing like
one. I suppose you might have an argu
ment if you put a jacuzzi next to the
Claw, set out a few banquet tables in Old
Union, stuck a couple of steam baths in
Cubberly Auditorium and possibly had a
couple of caddies take your books from
class to class for you.
