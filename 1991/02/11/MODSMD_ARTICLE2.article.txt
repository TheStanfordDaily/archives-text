# Response team to aid sexual assault victims
## 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
Realizing that money would not be avail
able to hire a coordinator for sexual assault
services, the University has asked Counsel
ing and Psychological Services to take on
some of these responsibilities.
The request is a stopgap measure to bet
ter coordinate victim-aid programs. Last
week, the University Task Force on Sexual
Assault recommended a special position be
created to coordinate rape prevention and
victim services.
On the Friday before the task force's
report was released, Acting Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Norm Robinson assigned
CAPS this responsibility CAPS has set up a
five-member response team for this task.
Psychiatrist Gail Nelligan, team coordi
nator, said the response team will listen to
victims, counsel them on what kinds of ser
vices are available and even visit them if
they need immediate attention.
While some administrators quickly sup
ported the task force's proposals, they said
Stanford's current budgetary problems
make the creation of a special victim-aid
coordinator almost impossible.
"I just don't see it there for a few years,"
Robinson said.
He added that existing resources for sex

ual assault victims "need to be better coor
dinated" to help solve the problems identi
fied by the task force.
Nelligan said the CAPS team is trying to
coordinate a wide range of services for vic
tims, from physical exams at local hospitals
to help from the ASSU legal counseling ser
vice to assistance in making academic
arrangements with University depart
ments.
While the team will soon be "up to
speed," it is a only "stopgap measure," she
said. The CAPS staff is working on sexual
assault services in addition to their other
duties.
Nelligan added that many of the team's
staff are not paid to work in the summer
and the University may need to provide
additional funding for them to stay on dur
ing that period.
She said that as CAPS gathers informa
tion on the team's workload, they will pre
sent the University with a proposal for the
summer.
Task force co-chair Patricia Fabiano said
the best solution to the sexual assault prob
lem would include creating "an office with a
great deal of time and flexibility" to coordi
nate victim-aid services.
"Recovering from sexual assault is not a
simple step back to normal life,"
she said. "It involves physical
problems, legal problems, per
haps academic difficulties."
While the CAPS team provides
a "reliable, contact entry-point"
for victims, it is a "temporary, in
between measure," Fabiano said.
To keep pressing for longer
term solutions, the task force rec
ommended creating a standing
committee on sexual assault. "It's
a built-in mechanism to continue

keeping the issue alive for stu
dents," she said.
Task force co-chair Suzanne
O'Brien, a senior, said sexual
assault is a nationwide problem
on college campuses. But she said
many of the universities the task
force interviewed would not even
acknowledge the problem.
"There are a lot of schools
where they don't know what's
going on," she said. "Stanford is
light-years ahead because we
identified [sexual assault] as an
issue."
She added that the Stanford
study was "pathbreaking"

because it was the first
"extremely extensive study of one
campus."
A survey of 2,400 Stanford stu
dents conducted in 1988 by the
Rape Education Project found
that one in three women and one
in eight men said they had "full
sexual activity" against their will,
almost all of them with acquain
tances.
The task force was created in
August 1989 in response to data
gathered from this survey. Fabi
ano said the task force spent
"endless hours" on the report,
interviewing victims and experts

and gathering information from
other universities.
"It is an effort that Stanford
can really be proud of, as well as
over a dozen people," she said.
In addition to victim services,
the task force recommended a
new interpretation of the Funda
mental Standard that requires
less proof to prosecute alleged
sexual assault offenders. It also
proposed the drafting of a formal
policy on unacceptable sexual
behavior that task force members
hope University President Don
ald Kennedy would support.
