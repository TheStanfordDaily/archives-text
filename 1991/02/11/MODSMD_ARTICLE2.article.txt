# Response team to aid sexual assault victims
## 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
Realizing that money would not be avail
able to hire a coordinator for sexual assault
services, the University has asked Counsel
ing and Psychological Services to take on
some of these responsibilities.
The request is a stopgap measure to bet
ter coordinate victim-aid programs. Last
week, the University Task Force on Sexual
Assault recommended a special position be
created to coordinate rape prevention and
victim services.
On the Friday before the task force's
report was released, Acting Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Norm Robinson assigned
CAPS this responsibility CAPS has set up a
five-member response team for this task.
Psychiatrist Gail Nelligan, team coordi
nator, said the response team will listen to
victims, counsel them on what kinds of ser
vices are available and even visit them if
they need immediate attention.
While some administrators quickly sup
ported the task force's proposals, they said
Stanford's current budgetary problems
make the creation of a special victim-aid
coordinator almost impossible.
"I just don't see it there for a few years,"
Robinson said.
He added that existing resources for sex

Nelligan said the CAPS team is trying to
coordinate a wide range of services for vic

to help from the ASSU legal counseling ser

arrangements with University depart
ments.
While the team will soon be "up to
speed," it is a only "stopgap measure," she
said. The CAPS staff is working on sexual
assault services in addition to their other
duties.
Nelligan added that many of the team's
staff are not paid to work in the summer
and the University may need to provide
additional funding for them to stay on dur
ing that period.
She said that as CAPS gathers informa
tion on the team's workload, they will pre
sent the University with a proposal for the
summer.
Task force co-chair Patricia Fabiano said
the best solution to the sexual assault prob
lem would include creating "an office with a
great deal of time and flexibility" to coordi
nate victim-aid services.
"Recovering from sexual assault is not a
