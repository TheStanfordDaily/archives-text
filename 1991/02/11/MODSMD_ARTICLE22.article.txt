## Shot at buzzer ends 42-game home streak 
### David Hirning Senior staff writer 
The Streak is over, but it literally
took a prayer to end it.
The No. 8 Stanford women's basket
ball team, defending national champion
and former owner of the nation's sec
ond-longest home winning streak at 42
straight victories, had its annual dose of
humility administered by the No. 12
Washington Huskies on Saturday night.
As 5,141 and a national television audi
ence looked on, reserve guard Laura
Moore's buzzer-beater shocked the Car
dinal in Maples, 69-68.
The loss seemed almost fated to
occur, just as it did a year ago when the
Cardinal lost its only game of the year to
an inspired Husky team, 81-78.
It's the second consecutive year that
Washington has stunned Stanford (17-
4, 10-1) on ESPN after losing to the
Cardinal earlier in the season. In so
doing, the Huskies (16-3, 9-2)
reasserted themselves as a factor in the
Pacific 10 Conference race, one game
behind league-leading Stanford.
"I think I'll take ESPN with me
wherever I go," a beaming Washington
Coach Chris Gobrecht said after the
upset.
Much like last year's upset, the game
had all the signs of a classic barnburner:
a vocal, sign-waving crowd; momentum
swings; aggressive play; and nip-and
tuck basketball. The two teams were
tied at halftime and then deadlocked
nine more times in the second half. It
was the type of game where the team
which has the ball last wins.
Unfortunately for Stanford, that
team was the Huskies. After the Cardi
nal's Sonja Henning was fouled on a
drive and made one of two free throws
with 25 seconds remaining, Gobrecht
called a timeout with her team trailing
by one. She turned to Moore, a three
point specialist who had yet to play in
the game.

Moore described the scene in the
huddle. "We were standing there and
fCoach Gobrechtl looked at me and said,
'Do you want to do this?' I said, 'Yes,
Coach, I do.'"
"Laura Moore is the best shooter we
have on this team," Gobrecht said, "and
we were in a situation where we needed
to score."
Yet Gobrecht's designed play was not
for Moore, but the Huskies' leading
scorer, senior Karen Deden. Deden had
been hot down the stretch after a cold
start, scoring 12 second half points. Just
inside 10 seconds left, Deden got the ball
on the left baseline.
Immediately, Stanford center Trisha
Stevens blanketed Deden. Chris Mac-
Murdo, inserted as part of a four-for
ward lineup in the closing minutes, left
her assignment to double-team Deden.
Somehow, the six-foot-four Deden got
off a shot. It went in—and back out.
The crowd went crazy, certain that
the Cardinal had just won its 12th
straight overall and 43rd consecutive in
Maples.
But then disaster occurred. Stan
ford's Val Whiting, who led all scorers
with 17 points and added 10 boards for
her 10th double-double of the year,
appeared to be in position for the weak
side rebound. But somehow, in the
melee of bodies, the ball slipped away
and went rolling in the middle of the
paint.
Moore emerged from the crowd of
diving players with the ball. The clock
showed :04. The sophomore from
Pendleton, Ore., who averages just five
points a game, turned, squared and shot
from just inside the three-point arc. It
found nothing but net.

Was Someone looking out for the
Huskies during the last seconds?
"Before the game I prayed to God,
'Just give me a chance to win the game
with a last second shot,'" Moore said
afterward. "I swear it. Fortunately, He
did, and I thank Him for that."
In a mirror-image of last year, the
Huskies piled on each other at center
court to celebrate an improbable win
over Stanford. Last year, they revenged
a 102-62 thrashing in Maples with a
three-point victory in Seattle. This year,
the sites were reversed: Stanford led all
the way in a 75-71 win in Seattle, but
were upset at home.
Stanford had called a time-out with
one second left, but there would be no
Big Game-like heroics on this night.
Deden and Henning fought for the
inbounds pass as the horn sounded, sig
nalling the Cardinal's first Pac-10 loss
since Washington beat them one year
ago yesterday.
The game and its finish was just
another typical chapter in the fierce
rivalry between the two programs.
"It's never just another game when
you play Stanford," Deden said, who
topped the Huskies with 14 points and
seven rebounds. "Personally, I didn't
think that anything could top last year,
but it did. It was the biggest win of my
career and it feels great."
If there was a deciding factor in the
game, it would have been the inside play
of Washington's front-court players. In
Seattle, Stevens overwhelmed the
Huskies for 21 points on 9-of-13 shoot
ing, while Washington was without the
inside muscle of Shaunda Greene.
Last night, it was yet another rever
sal of fortune. Stevens, who had been
unable to play against Washington State
on Thursday because of a sore knee, did
not move well against the Huskies and
managed just 10 points.
