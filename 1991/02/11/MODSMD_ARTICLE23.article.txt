# What the Hec? Cardinal wins
## 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
SEATTLE, Wash. - Pat
yourself on the back if you can
remember the last time the
Stanford men's basketball
team used a press — yes, a full
court, swarming, we're-taking
the-ball-now press — to win a
basketball game.
If you can't remember,
you're probably not alone: The
Cardinal presses almost as
often as UNLV loses. And so, in
this Year of Insanity in the
Pacific 10 Conference, it makes
perfect sense that the Stanford
press won yesterday's game
with the Washington Huskies,
60-59.
The Cardinal win, only its
second on the road this year,
puts the team back into a five
way tie for third in the Pac-10
at 6-6 (13-9 overall). Arizona,
after beating UCLA in over
time yesterday, has an 8-3
mark and a one-game lead on
Washington State. After that
— as usual — it's a mess.
The Cardinal must have
been blessed yesterday, because
it had to overcome a lot of
lousiness — most of it self
induced — to come away with
only its second win at Hec
Edmundson Pavilion since
1978. Against the Huskies,
who are now dead last in the
Pac-10 at 3-8 (12-9), Stanford:
• Shot a horrid 36 per cent
(18-for-50) from the field.
Without Adam Keefe (6-for-9,
11-of-12 at the line, 23 points
and 10 boards) the team was a
sterling 12-for-41,
• Shot 62 per cent at the
line. Without Keefe? Ten hits,
12 misses: 45 percent,
• Turned the ball over 15
times and had exactly four
assists, and
• Had, for most of the first
half, the most unbalanced scor
ing attack one could imagine:
Keefe scored 15 of the Cardi
nal's first 17 points and was
the only reason Stanford didn't
get blown away by halftime.
However, the Cardinal spent
the entire first half trailing.
After falling behind 15-5 after
10 minutes, though, the team
was able to scrape and claw its
way back into the game and
ran for the shelter of the locker
room down only 27-25.
"The fact we were able to
come back and go in only down
two at the half was the key to
our having any chance at all,"
Montgomery said.
And, after getting that
chance, Stanford came

extremly close to throwing it
out the window. Nothing from
the outside worked in the sec
ond half — to say the least —
and the result was a 47-36
Washington lead with 11 min
utes left. So, with nothing else
to do, Stanford went into its
once-every-4 7-years-or-so
press.
"Well, we weren't doing any
thing else extremely well,"
Montgomery said. "Our half
court defense was all right (the
Huskies shot 42 per cent), but
on offense we weren't getting
anything done.
"We haven't worked on the
press, because with our quick
people you give something up
offensively, but we figured we
might as well shake it up and
see if we could get a few cheap
baskets."
They did just that, as the
Huskies threw the ball away
four times in their next six pos
sessions to see their lead cut to
47-42. A bunch of fouls on both
sides (the Huskies made all six
of their free throws, the Cardi
nal — natch — two of its four)
and a Deshon Wingate 10-
footer made it 55-46 with seven
minutes left, and then Stan
ford put on a decisive run:
Wingate makes one of two
for 55-47. Dion Brown (who
ended up with 10 points)
misses a short jumper, and
then Patrick — who just
checked in — nails a three. 55-
50. Marcus Lollie creates yet
another press-induced turn
over and gets the ball to
Patrick, whose layup makes it
55-52. Doug Meekins misses,
Brent Williams grabs the board
and puts it in Lollie's hands,
Lollie finds Keefe all alone and
the rest is history. 55-54, four
minutes left.
The Cardinal took its first
lead a minute later, when
Wingate hit two free throws to
make it 58-57. Brown hit a free
throw of his own to tie it up,
and then 20 seconds later
Williams (who had four points
and a career-high seven
rebounds) was fouled and
stepped up to the line. Tie
game. Less than three minutes
left.
Two misses.
It didn't matter, though,
because on the Huskies' next
