# Bulldogs take two from No. 1 Stanford
## 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
Fresno State shelled Sunken
Diamond with 17 hits Friday and
it took the previously undefeated
and top-ranked Cardinal until the
eighth inning yesterday to dig out
from the rubble.
The No. 27 Bulldogs (5-1)
blasted Stanford into the losing
column in the series opener with a
seven-run, 17-hit bombardment.
The Cardinal (8-2) was still gun
shy Saturday and lost a 5-4 deci
sion, and didn't return fire until a
three-run eighth-inning outburst
yesterday subdued Fresno State
6-3, preventing an embarrassing
three-game sweep on the home
soil.

Bulldogs take two
of three from Cardinal

"I know we can beat any team
in college baseball — we just did
it," Fresno State coach Bob Ben
nett said. "Of course we would
have been a lot more pleased if we
could have gotten a sweep, but if
you take two out of three from
another good team you have to be
pleased."
"It was a well played series,"
Bennett said, the tenth win
ningest coach in collegiate base
ball with an 856-461 record.
"There was good pitching in all
three games. Both of these are
good teams and I expect we'll both
get a lot better." 112
The Bulldogs got complete
game victories from junior Bobby
Jones Friday and junior Jim Pat
terson Saturday to clinch the
series win. On Friday, shortstop
Roger Burnett's first-inning
home run was the extent of the

offensive production for Stanford.
Catcher Troy Tallman hit a
two-run blast Saturday but Stan
ford was unable to overcome a
five-run Fresno outburst in the
eighth. The Cardinal was held to
just 10 hits in the two Bulldog vic
tories.
The big guns in the Stanford
lineup were noticeably quiet in
the series, although Burnett and
Steve Solomon exploded yester
day. Combined, the 3-4-5 hitters
— first baseman David McCarty,

center fielder Jeffrey Hammonds
and left fielder Ryan Turner —
were 3-for-30 with one run scored
and no runs driven in.
"When you can shut down
Hammonds and McCarty you
have a real good shot," Bennett
said, who revealed that Fresno
State's not-so-top-secret strategy
against Hammonds was to pitch
him in and out, change speeds and
to be "very, very careful."
"He's an impact player any
where in the lineup, and when he

gets on base he just gives you fits.
Right now it looks like he might
be a little too aggressive — swing
ing at pitches out of the strike
zone — but he's such a great ath
lete I'm sure he'll adjust," the
Bulldog skipper continued.
Hammonds, who leads the
team with four home runs, was 3-
for-12 for the series with no extra
base hits, no runs and no runs
driven in.
