# Women fish swim past Longhorns, Mustangs
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
When the Cardinal women's
swim team last traveled to Austin,
Texas, it left under highly
unpleasant circumstances. Last
March the Cardinal was upset by
Texas at the NCAA champi
onships there, and Stanford had
to wait 11 months to get another
shot at the Lady Longhorns.
Friday night second-ranked
Stanford got that shot, and the
team made the best of it by beat
ing top-ranked Texas in the
team's dual meet at the Texas
Swimming Center While the
158.5-141.5 victoiy does not com
pletely avenge the loss at NCAAs,
it leaves the Cardinal in good posi
tion to return the favor at this
year's nationals, six weeks hence
in Indianapolis.

Cardinal 158.5

tive dual-meet win over the Lady
Longhorns, Stanford beat No. 9
Southern Methodist 165-127 Sat
urday The Cardinal is now 9-0
this year and has won 24 consecu
tive dual meets. The winner of the
Stanford-Texas dual meet has
gone on to win the NCAA title in
three of the last four years.
"I think the meet overall was
great," sophomore Janel Jor
gensen said. "It was neat to go in
there as the underdog. ... We
went down there with the attitude
that we had something to prove."
"I think that we all swam really
well," sophomore Janet Evans
added. "We knew it would be

really close and we knew every
point would count."
Jorgensen started the meet off
by swimming the backstroke leg
on the 400-yard medley relay Jor
gensen won NCAA titles in the
butterfly and individual medley
last year, and is a good sprint
freestyler, but coach Richard
Quick asked her to swim the back
stroke leg in the relay.
"We kind of discussed it," she
said of swimming the backstroke.
"I guess I found out about two or
three days before we left. It was
kind of different. ... Normally I
got in having a lot of confidence in
my butterfly leg or my freestyle
leg, but starting the race in back
stroke. .."
Swimming the backstroke legs
for Texas' two teams were Beth
Barr, who swam the backstroke
leg for the U.S. silver medalist
400-meter medley relay team in

the 1988 Olympics, and Jodi Wil
son, who placed third in the
NCAA 100 backstroke last year.
But despite facing such a stacked
deck, Jorgensen outswam her
competitors, giving Stanford a
.67-Becond lead.
Breaststroker Lori Heisick,
butterflier Summer Sanders and
freestyler Suzy Buckovich fared
equally as well, and Stanford won
the opening race by a second and a
half. The Cardinal B team also
placed third, giving Stanford a 13-
4 lead after the race.
"I think that was a really
important part," Evans said, "not
just the team that won, but get
ting third. I think it got the team
off to a really good start Now
that they score three places in
relays, from their point of view I
think it's harder to come back
after only getting second."
Evans then won the 1,650
freestyle by a whopping 32 sec
onds and teammates Barb Metz,
Katherine Comanor and Sionainn
Marcoux placed third, fourth and
fifth. Stanford never slowed up
after the start and went on for the
win.
Jorgensen also won the 100
and 200 freestyles and the 100
butterfly. In the 100 freestyle she
upset two-time defending NCAA
champion Leigh Ann Fetter, much
like she did at last year's dual
meet.
"That was probably the one I
was most worried about," Jor
gensen said. "I knew she hadn't
swum since the relay and would
be fresh (Jorgensen had the 200
freestyle in between). I just real
ized that was going to be an essen
tial race for the team. It was close
going into that and if they went
one-two, well, it wouldn't really
put us under but it would make
things a lot tougher."

After winning the 1,650 in
16:00.92, a time faster than any
one else swam the event all last
year, Evans managed to get a sec
ond behind Barr in the 200 back
stroke. Then, after the 200 breast
stroke, she was back in the pool
again to win the 500 freestyle.
In the backstroke, "I just went
in there with an attitude that 1
had to go and place as high as I
could to score points for the
team," Evans said. "It was kind of
'go for it and rest for five minutes
then get in and go for it again.' "
Like Evans, Sanders also won
two events and had a strong per
formance in a third. She won the
200 butterfly, edging teammate
Michelle Griglione, and took the
400 IM by seven and a half second.
She swam in the 100 backstroke,
taking third behind the Lady
Longhorns' two big guns.
Freshman diver • Eileen
Richetelli won the one-meter div
ing competition and placed second
in the three-meter. The only other
Cardinal event winner was
Heisick, in the 100 breaststroke.
Heisick missed last week's meets
after severly lacerating her finger,
but swam season-bests to win the

100 and place second in the 200
breaststroke.
On the day, Stanford swimmers
recorded team season-bests in 11
of the 12 individual events. The
Cardinal also combined with the
Lady Longhorns to post a phe
nomenal 39 NCAA qualifying
times at the meet. Freshman
Laura Gandrud qualified in the
200 breaststroke and senior Jody
Smith qualified in the 200 back
stroke, bringing the total number
of Cardinal swimmers qualified to
11.
"I think our team got pretty
fired up about it," Jorgensen said.
"It was nice to beat them down
there in front of the Texas crowd
— it was pretty packed.
Saturday Jorgensen and Pam
Minthorn both sat out the meet
but the Cardinal still beat the
Mustangs. Smith won the 200 and
500 freestyles to lead the way.
Karen Kraemer won the 1,000
freestyle, Heisick won the 100
breaststroke, Griglione took the
200 backstroke, Metz captured
the 100 butterfly, Sanders claimed
the 200 IM and Richetelli
outscored the field in the three
meter diving.

Evans then won the 1,650
freestyle by a whopping 32 sec
onds and teammates Barb Metz,
Katherine Comanor and Sionainn
Marcoux placed third, fourth and
fifth. Stanford never slowed up
after the start and went on for the
win.
Jorgensen also won the 100
and 200 freestyles and the 100
butterfly. In the 100 freestyle she
upset two-time defending NCAA
champion Leigh Ann Fetter, much
like she did at last year's dual
meet.
"That was probably the one I
was most worried about," Jor
gensen said. "I knew she hadn't
swum since the relay and would
be fresh (Jorgensen had the 200
freestyle in between). I just real
ized that was going to be an essen
tial race for the team. It was close
going into that and if they went
one-two, well, it wouldn't really
put us under but it would make
things a lot tougher."

After winning the 1,650 in
16:00.92, a time faster than any
one else swam the event all last
year, Evans managed to get a sec
ond behind Barr in the 200 back
stroke. Then, after the 200 breast
stroke, she was back in the pool
again to win the 500 freestyle.
In the backstroke, "I just went
in there with an attitude that 1
had to go and place as high as I
could to score points for the
team," Evans said. "It was kind of
'go for it and rest for five minutes
then get in and go for it again.' "
Like Evans, Sanders also won
two events and had a strong per
formance in a third. She won the
200 butterfly, edging teammate
Michelle Griglione, and took the
400 IM by seven and a half second.
She swam in the 100 backstroke,
taking third behind the Lady
Longhorns' two big guns.
Freshman diver • Eileen
Richetelli won the one-meter div
ing competition and placed second
in the three-meter. The only other
Cardinal event winner was
Heisick, in the 100 breaststroke.
Heisick missed last week's meets
after severly lacerating her finger,
but swam season-bests to win the

100 and place second in the 200
breaststroke.
On the day, Stanford swimmers
recorded team season-bests in 11
of the 12 individual events. The
Cardinal also combined with the
Lady Longhorns to post a phe
nomenal 39 NCAA qualifying
times at the meet. Freshman
Laura Gandrud qualified in the
200 breaststroke and senior Jody
Smith qualified in the 200 back
stroke, bringing the total number
of Cardinal swimmers qualified to
11.
"I think our team got pretty
fired up about it," Jorgensen said.
"It was nice to beat them down
there in front of the Texas crowd
— it was pretty packed.
Saturday Jorgensen and Pam
Minthorn both sat out the meet
but the Cardinal still beat the
Mustangs. Smith won the 200 and
500 freestyles to lead the way.
Karen Kraemer won the 1,000
freestyle, Heisick won the 100
breaststroke, Griglione took the
200 backstroke, Metz captured
the 100 butterfly, Sanders claimed
the 200 IM and Richetelli
outscored the field in the three
meter diving.


Stanford swimmer Janet Evans on her way to a victory In the 1,650 freestyle this weekend at Texas. She
won the race by 32 seconds.
When the Cardinal women's
swim team last traveled to Austin,
Texas, it left under highly
unpleasant circumstances. Last
March the Cardinal was upset by
Texas at the NCAA champi
onships there, and Stanford had
to wait 11 months to get another
shot at the Lady Longhorns.
Friday night second-ranked
Stanford got that shot, and the
team made the best of it by beat
ing top-ranked Texas in the
team's dual meet at the Texas
Swimming Center While the
158.5-141.5 victoiy does not com
pletely avenge the loss at NCAAs,
it leaves the Cardinal in good posi

year's nationals, six weeks hence
in Indianapolis.

tive dual-meet win over the Lady
Longhorns, Stanford beat No. 9
Southern Methodist 165-127 Sat
urday The Cardinal is now 9-0
this year and has won 24 consecu
tive dual meets. The winner of the
Stanford-Texas dual meet has
gone on to win the NCAA title in
three of the last four years.
"I think the meet overall was
great," sophomore Janel Jor
gensen said. "It was neat to go in
there as the underdog. ... We
went down there with the attitude
that we had something to prove."
"I think that we all swam really
well," sophomore Janet Evans
added. "We knew it would be

really close and we knew every
point would count."
Jorgensen started the meet off
by swimming the backstroke leg
on the 400-yard medley relay Jor
gensen won NCAA titles in the
butterfly and individual medley
last year, and is a good sprint
freestyler, but coach Richard
Quick asked her to swim the back
stroke leg in the relay.
"We kind of discussed it," she
said of swimming the backstroke.
"I guess I found out about two or
three days before we left. It was
kind of different. ... Normally I
got in having a lot of confidence in
my butterfly leg or my freestyle
leg, but starting the race in back
stroke. .."
Swimming the backstroke legs
for Texas' two teams were Beth
Barr, who swam the backstroke
leg for the U.S. silver medalist
400-meter medley relay team in

the 1988 Olympics, and Jodi Wil
son, who placed third in the
NCAA 100 backstroke last year.
But despite facing such a stacked
deck, Jorgensen outswam her
competitors, giving Stanford a
.67-Becond lead.
Breaststroker Lori Heisick,
butterflier Summer Sanders and
freestyler Suzy Buckovich fared
equally as well, and Stanford won
the opening race by a second and a
half. The Cardinal B team also
placed third, giving Stanford a 13-
4 lead after the race.
"I think that was a really
important part," Evans said, "not
just the team that won, but get
ting third. I think it got the team
off to a really good start Now
that they score three places in
relays, from their point of view I
think it's harder to come back
after only getting second."
