# Women fish swim past Longhorns, Mustangs

### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
When the Cardinal women's
swim team last traveled to Austin,
Texas, it left under highly
unpleasant circumstances. Last
March the Cardinal was upset by
Texas at the NCAA champi
onships there, and Stanford had
to wait 11 months to get another
shot at the Lady Longhorns.
Friday night second-ranked
Stanford got that shot, and the
team made the best of it by beat
ing top-ranked Texas in the
team's dual meet at the Texas
Swimming Center While the
158.5-141.5 victoiy does not com
pletely avenge the loss at NCAAs,
it leaves the Cardinal in good posi
tion to return the favor at this
year's nationals, six weeks hence
in Indianapolis.

tive dual-meet win over the Lady
Longhorns, Stanford beat No. 9
Southern Methodist 165-127 Sat
urday The Cardinal is now 9-0
this year and has won 24 consecu
tive dual meets. The winner of the
Stanford-Texas dual meet has
gone on to win the NCAA title in
three of the last four years.
"I think the meet overall was
great," sophomore Janel Jor
gensen said. "It was neat to go in
there as the underdog. ... We
went down there with the attitude
that we had something to prove."
"I think that we all swam really
well," sophomore Janet Evans
added. "We knew it would be

really close and we knew every
point would count."
Jorgensen started the meet off
by swimming the backstroke leg
on the 400-yard medley relay Jor
gensen won NCAA titles in the
butterfly and individual medley
last year, and is a good sprint
freestyler, but coach Richard
Quick asked her to swim the back
stroke leg in the relay.
"We kind of discussed it," she
said of swimming the backstroke.
"I guess I found out about two or
three days before we left. It was
kind of different. ... Normally I
got in having a lot of confidence in
my butterfly leg or my freestyle
leg, but starting the race in back
stroke. .."
Swimming the backstroke legs
for Texas' two teams were Beth
Barr, who swam the backstroke
leg for the U.S. silver medalist
400-meter medley relay team in

the 1988 Olympics, and Jodi Wil
son, who placed third in the
NCAA 100 backstroke last year.
But despite facing such a stacked
deck, Jorgensen outswam her
competitors, giving Stanford a
.67-Becond lead.
Breaststroker Lori Heisick,
butterflier Summer Sanders and
freestyler Suzy Buckovich fared
equally as well, and Stanford won
the opening race by a second and a
half. The Cardinal B team also
placed third, giving Stanford a 13-
4 lead after the race.
"I think that was a really
important part," Evans said, "not
just the team that won, but get
ting third. I think it got the team
off to a really good start Now
that they score three places in
relays, from their point of view I
think it's harder to come back
