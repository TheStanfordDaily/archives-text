# Stanford doesn't let down, sweeps over weekend
## 
### Noah Blake Staff writer 
After its thrilling, come-from
behind victory over Arizona State
10 days ago, Stanford's men's
gymnastics team had to avoid a
let-down in two meets over the
weekend against California, Kent
State and San Jose State in order
to keep up with Coach Sadao
Hamada's "plan" to lead the
fourth-ranked Cardinal to the
national championship. The team
won both meets handily, raising
its record to eight wins and no
losses and, more importantly, kept
on course for Hamada's plan.
In Saturday's meet, held at
Burnham Pavilion, Hamada, look
ing for a high team score, put his
best team on the floor and was
rewarded with a 281.05, almost
seven points better than second
place Kent State. Stanford beat
the third-place Spartans by 13
points and trounced the hapless

Men's Gymnastics

Cardinal sweeps
four-way meet

Golden Bears, who were unable to
field six gymnasts for the all
around, by over 73.
The Cardinal was able to
achieve this score, its highest of
the season, despite, by Hamada's
count, "a total of 18 misses" in the
meet. Two factors made this score
attainable despite the misses:
This weekend Stanford's gym
nasts started to perform routines
with more difficult (and higher
scoring) tricks, and, as Senior Tim
Wang put it, "the scoring on Sat
urday was a little high, because
the judges were being pretty
lenient."
Perhaps taking advantage of
this lenient scoring, Card sopho
more Jeff Bender scored a 9.90 on

the pommel horse while freshman
Marc Booth, who placed second in
the all-around for yet another
week, won three individual events
including the high bar and floor
exercise, both with 9.B's.
"I am pleased with our overall
performance because even with
the misses, we scored well,"
Hamada said. "Once we practice
more routines our consistency will
improve and then who knows
what we will be able to do."
For Sunday's meet at Harmon
Arena in Berkeley, only Wang and
Freshman Jason Cohen competed
in the all-around as Hamada tried
to give other team members a
chance to show their stuff. Not
suprisingly, the Cardinal had a
lower score than on Saturday, fin
ishing with a 276.35. But the
team's margin of victory grew to
12 points over Kent State, who
again finished second, with San
Jose State placing third and Cal
finishing fourth.

Given an opportunity to shine,
Wang won the all-around with a
55.65, a very good score consider
ing that the judges were much
tougher on Sunday.
"It was great to win the all
around at a meet and I really see
the team pulling together, with
everybody doing their jobs." Wang
said.
They are obviously performing
well with the pressure off, as it
was this past weekend. The team
knew going in to the meet that
none of the teams were really a
threat to beat them. Yet they
accomplished Hamada's main
objective for the weekend, scoring
big with new routines.
When the gymnasts look back
at the end of the season, perfor
mances like the ones they gave
this past weekend, in which they
virtually competed against them
selves, may be just as important
as a victory over any top-notched
squad.
