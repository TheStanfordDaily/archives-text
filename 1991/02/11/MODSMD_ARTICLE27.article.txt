# Netters fall at Rolex

Minneapolis isn't exactly
Khafji and the battle for
supremacy isn't anything at all
like the war in the Persian
Gulf, but. . .
At the Rolex National
Indoor Tennis Championship
this weekend, the enemy dust
ed off two of its biggest guns
and used them to win an early
season skirmish with the five
time defending national cham
pionship.
The guns, Florida's Nicole
Arendt and Georgia's Shannan
McCarthy may not have how
itzered the opposition out of
existence. They did, however,
knock top-seeded Sandra Birch
and Teri Whitlinger out of the
tournament Saturday in a pair
of spirited three-setters.
Birch reached her semifinal
with Arendt by scoring a pair of
crushing wins Friday. First,
she shot down Notre Dame's
Tracy Barton 6-3, 6-0. Then, in
the quarterfinals, the Stanford

senior flattened Kristine Kurth
of William & Mary 6-0, 6-4.
She .continued to roll
through her first set with
Arendt, winning it 6-3. The
wily Gator came back to take
the match with 6-4, 6-2 victo
ries in the second and third
sets.
McCarthy would earn a
meeting with Arendt in the
semifinals by blitzkrieging
Whitlinger 0-6, 6-3, 6-4 on Sat
urday. A day earlier, Whitlinger
hammered Danielle Scott of
Arizona 6-2, 6-2 and pounded
Duke's Julie Exum 6-4, 6-4.
Sophomore Heather Willens
was eliminated from the Rolex
theater by McCarthy Friday, 7-
5, 6-1. Georgia's star junior,
though able to knock off two of
Stanford's finest, could not
best Arendt in yesterday's
final. McCarthy fell 3-6, 7-6, 6-
4 â€” it was her second defeat in
a Collegiate Grand Slam final
this season.
Arendt established herself
as the tourney's top gun by cap
turing the doubles title as well.
