# USC, UCLA beat Stanford
## 
### Amy Wusterbarth Staff writer 
The men'B swim team made a
valiant showing in the final home
meets of the season, losing to
UCLA 123-120 on Friday before
falling to No. 2-ranked USC 141-
100 on Saturday.
The battle with the Bruins was
close. The lead changed hands
four times with tight races in
almost every event. Although
three outgoing Cardinal seniors
had strong performances on Fri
day, it was freshmen who stole the
show.

Bruins 123, Cardinal 120
Trojans 141, Cardinal 100

Seniors Matt Rodgers and Ken
Brakebill had season-best perfor
mances in the 200-yard individual
medley and 200 breaststroke
respectively. But freshman Derek
Weatherford won both the 200
individual medley and the 200
backstroke while classmate Tyler
Mayfield captured the 200 breast
stroke with the only NCAA quali
fying time of the meet.
Saturday was the same story
with young guns Weatherford and
Mayfield winning the 200 back
stroke and 200 breaststroke
again. In addition Weatherford
broke a six-year pool record with
his dazzling 200 backstroke.
"I wasn't as concerned with my
time as I was with beating the
(USC) guys," said Weatherford,
"It was kind of a personal
vendetta."
The Trojans had spectacular
swims in every event. Their star
diver Brian Early outscored Stan
ford's Brad Wightman by 39
points on the one-meter board.
"USC is definitely the best
team we've faced," Coach Skip
Kenney said." There's no doubt in
my mind that they're better than
(No. 1-ranked) Texas. (USC)
really doesn't have a weakness."
With two injured swimmers,
the Cardinal suffers from a lack of
depth. Jeff Rouse and J.J. Freitag
are world-class athletes who will
be a tremendous help to the team
once they return from their
injuries.
"You just can't lose a world
champion and his talents. Jeff is

the heart of the team and a poten
tial Olympian like J.J. It hurts (to
lose them)," Kinney said. "We
can't be much better than we're
doing. We just have a real small
team. We need more bodies."
That may be exactly what Ken
ney gets out of next year's fresh
man class. He hopes to recruit 12
tols athletes to add depth to the
Cardinal program. "It's all up to
Admissions now," Kenney said.
"We've worked harder at recruit
ing this year than ever before."
Kenney seems to have a good
chance of getting what he wants.

The team's top 25 recruits aver
age a 3.9 GPA and a 1280 SAT
score. "It's the best academic class
we've ever recruited and they're
great swimmers too," Kenney
said. "With that talent, we could
be undefeated next year."
Half of the recruits have
already verbally agreed to come to
Stanford if admitted. Clay Tip
pins, a 1989 All-American and
Georgia state record-holder in the
butterfly, has already signed a let
ter-of-intent. He'll probably fill
the hole left by senior Jeff
Abrams.
