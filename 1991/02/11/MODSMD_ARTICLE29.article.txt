# Weenies pin Cardinal, 21-15
## 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
A valiant effort by the Stan
ford wrestling team came up
just short Saturday night as the
Cardinal lost to 18th-ranked
Cal State-Bakersfield 21-15 at
Burnham Pavilion in the team's
last dual meet of the year.
Stanford Coach Chris Horpel
was obviously satisfied his his
squad's performance. "I was
really pleased with the team on
Saturday. Considering the
strength of Bakersfield, I
thought we wrestled really well.
We had a good crowd there, and
it was a great way to send off
the seniors."
The Roadrunners, 9-6-0 on
the season, fielded a menacing
lineup which included five
wrestlers ranked nationally
among the top 11 wrestlers in
their weight classes.
Lance Johnson, the Stanford
134-pounder, fought a seesaw
battle with Bakersfield's Troy
Beavers. Both wrestlers picked
up first period takedowns but
Beavers appeared to have taken

the upper hand in the second
round, going ahead 6-3 and in
control late in the period.
However, Johnson (14-8-0 on
the year) scored escape points
late in the period and then
countered with a reversal and
two takedowns in the third
period en route to an impressive
11-8 victory.
The freshman's come-from
behind win impressed Horpel.
"Lance has just got this will of
iron," Horpel said. "When he
was down late in the match, he
really rose to the occasion."
Dave Sacks scored the Cardi
nal's second win of the night, a
10-6 decision in the 150-pound
event. Sacks's first move of the
night, what Horpel called a
"hip-throw headlock," was good
for takedown and mat points,
giving the junior a quick 5-0
lead. Sacks improved his record

to 11-10-1 on the season.
Steve Buddie continued to
perform like an All-American at
167 pounds. The senior co-cap
tain recorded the only pin of the
night on a beautiful reverse lift
move 1:58 into his match. Bud
die, ranked seventh nationally,
improved to 23-2-0.
In the 177-pound event,
Steve Yarbrough came away
with an 8-4 upset victory over
fifth-ranked Mark Cheff.
Yarbrough (25-4-0), who had
lost to Cheff at the Las Vegas
Invitational in early December,
utilized a takedown technique
that had consistently scored
near-fall points for the senior in
practice, but not in actual
matches.
According to Horpel,
Yarbrough's week of prepara
tion paid off. "Steve used a style
[against Cheff] that he uses all
the time, one which usually
takes people down but does not
score him back points. We
worked on it in practice this
week and it paid off."
Stanford completed their
dual season with a 4-4-1 record.
