# Latino students criticize elimination of administrator

### Jason Bloomstein Senior staff writer 
Despite assurances from University
President Donald Kennedy, Latino stu
dent leaders seem unconvinced that the
elimination of the Office of Mexican-
American Affairs will not affect the vari

They also expressed concern that they

were never consulted in the decision
making process.
The director of the office, Fernando de
Necochea, will be laid off April 1, and all
of the office's duties will be reassigned to
other administrative departments. In
recent years, the office has staffed com
mittees like the University Committee on
Minority Issues, provided services to local
Latino neighborhoods and families and

made inroads in attracting Latino faculty.
According to Kennedy, the layoff is
solely a financial matter.
Speaking of a meeting last week with
six Latino student leaders who protested
the layoff, Kennedy said, "I reassured the
students that repositioning and only that
was at issue. [The layoff] did not relate to
job performance or to past divisions
within the Chicano/Latino community."

"We also discussed various options for
relocating the functions associated [with]
the office," Kennedy said.
At least one person has said the layoff
may not be a great loss in light of de
Necochea's performance as an assistant
provost and adviser to the president for
Chicano affairs.
Jerry Porras, a professor in the Gradu
ate School of Business, said the office

should provide a "conduit of information
and communication between faculty and
upper-level administration. That service
was not forthcoming" in recent years, he
added.
After the meeting with Kennedy, for

a senior, said he was "disappointed and
