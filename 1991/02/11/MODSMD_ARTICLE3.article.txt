# Latino students criticize elimination of administrator
## 
### Jason Bloomstein Senior staff writer 
Despite assurances from University
President Donald Kennedy, Latino stu
dent leaders seem unconvinced that the
elimination of the Office of Mexican-
American Affairs will not affect the vari
ous services provided to their community.
They also expressed concern that they

were never consulted in the decision
making process.
The director of the office, Fernando de
Necochea, will be laid off April 1, and all
of the office's duties will be reassigned to
other administrative departments. In
recent years, the office has staffed com
mittees like the University Committee on
Minority Issues, provided services to local
Latino neighborhoods and families and

made inroads in attracting Latino faculty.
According to Kennedy, the layoff is
solely a financial matter.
Speaking of a meeting last week with
six Latino student leaders who protested
the layoff, Kennedy said, "I reassured the
students that repositioning and only that
was at issue. [The layoff] did not relate to
job performance or to past divisions
within the Chicano/Latino community."

"We also discussed various options for
relocating the functions associated [with]
the office," Kennedy said.
At least one person has said the layoff
may not be a great loss in light of de
Necochea's performance as an assistant
provost and adviser to the president for
Chicano affairs.
Jerry Porras, a professor in the Gradu
ate School of Business, said the office

should provide a "conduit of information
and communication between faculty and
upper-level administration. That service
was not forthcoming" in recent years, he
added.
After the meeting with Kennedy, for
mer UCMI staff member Michael Canul,
a senior, said he was "disappointed and
angry" the University cut the
very office that organized Latino
membership on UCMI. Among
other things, the committee
report urged recruitment of more
Latino faculty and students.
With budget cuts strapping
already overloaded departments,
the student leaders did not seem
confident the services of the Mex
ican-American affairs office
would find a receptive home else
where in the University.

"We really got
across the need
for our own
office," said Adri
ana Martinez,
one of the six
who met with
Kennedy, "not to
redirect it into
already overbur
dened offices."

Martinez is a member of the
Latino Students Association.
The student leaders also
expressed disappointment that
administrators did not consult
them and did not examine the
impact of the loss of the office
before making the layoff decision.
"Kennedy told us to disregard
the process," Martinez said. "He
said he didn't consult students
because there was no time. He felt
he had to act."
Canul, who coordinates the
Hispanic Student Leadership
Project, said only after the layoff
did administrators fully under
stand the importance of the office

to Latino students. "Before you
act, you should know who it
affects and what your decision
does," Canul said.
"There was a lot of fact-finding
after the layoff decision," Mar
tinez said.
Kennedy refused to comment
on this concern.
Lydia Sandoval, co-chair of the
1991 Chicano/Latino Graduation
Committee, said although the
budget of the Provost's Office has
been slashed by 25 percent and
the University has expressed a
commitment to making the cuts
"even-handedly," one has to ques
tion the fairness of a "100 per

cent" cut in the
Office of Mexi
can-American Af
fairs.
However, one of
the principal ar
chitects of the
budget cuts did
not agree with
Sandoval's as
sessment of the

fairness of the layoff.
Ray Bacchetti, acting vice pres
ident for Planning and Manage
ment, said there really is no
Office of Mexican-American
Affairs beyond de Necochea's
position. De Necochea's services
to the Latino community are only
a small part of his job require
ment, which includes general
administrative support which can
be cut, Bacchetti added.
Sandoval said she thinks
Kennedy seems sincere in his
willingness to incorporate the
office's services into other depart
ments after the cuts are made.
