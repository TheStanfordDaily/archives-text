Coach Breck Greenwood may
have found a new job. Early last
week, he predicted that Friday
night's meet at Burnham Pavil
ion, with four schools repre
sented, would be a battle between
the top two teams. He could not
have been any more correct. The
Stanford women went head-to
head with a strong Washington
team, and despite their valiant
performance, placed second
behind the Huskies, 184.85 to
185.95.
"As a whole, we just had a down
day. We lacked a lot of energy, basi
cally," Kanuka said. "There was
nothing really specific that hap
pened. We just didn't pull together
like we had in some of our other
meets."
"We could have beat Washing
ton if we all had worked together

and had the kind of meets that we
had been having," freshman Ker
rie Kelley said. Although four
teams competed, the meet was a
duel between Washington and
Stanford from the start of the
competition. The two other
teams, UC-Davis and lowa State,
were left in the dust.
The meet opened with Stanford
on vault while the Huskies com
peted on the uneven bars. Vault
ing proved to be the Cardinal's
weakest event of the competition,
with most scores averaging
around 9.1 points. The one excep
tion was freshman Kerri Kanuka,
whose 9.6 points on the apparatus
provided an extra boost. The team
still fell short, however, as first
round totals had Stanford trailing

Washington, 46.80 to 45.55.
Throughout the rest of the
meet, Stanford attempted to take
the lead but the talented Husky
women refused to let go. In the
second round, Stanford tried to
make up the point difference with
strong performances on the
uneven bars. Senior Jennifer
Bloom led the team's performance
in the event with a solid score of
9.4 points. Despite the effort,
however, a few mistakes cost the
Stanford women the opportunity
to take over first place.
During the third round, how
ever, the tide started to turn and
the final outcome became less
clear. On the beam, by far Stan
ford's strongest event, the six
competitors pulled together and
turned in outstanding routines,
tallying up only one fall among
them. Helping to lead the squad
were Bloom and Kelley, who both
scored 9.55 points. With an excel
lent performance, Kanuka nailed
down the team's highest beam
score for the evening, 9.6 points.
The final round, however, was
everything but dull. Stanford, per
forming on the floor, needed to
have near-perfect routines across
the board to come out with the
win. On the other hand, the
Huskies, who were vaulting, had
to perform well enough to hold on
to their lead over a hungry Stan
ford team.
Stanford rose to the challenge
and had several good perfor
mances on the floor. The "KK"
couple, once again gave it their all
and led the team in scoring on
floor. Kelley earned 9.5 points,
while Kanuka's two double backs
gave her 9.7 points in the event.
At the same time, however, the
Washington women vaulted beau
tifully with many scores in the
mid-nines.
In the end, despite an all-out
comeback by Stanford in the final
two events, Washington held on to
the number one spot with 185.95
points. The Cardinal placed sec
ond with 184.85 points; far behind
were third place lowa State, with
179.60 points, and UC-Davis,
with 174.5 points.
In the all-around competition,
however, Stanford came out on
top. Washington's Lisa Churchill
and Chilo Millner took the second
and third spots, but number one
was all Stanford. For the third
competition in a row, Kanuka
walked away with the all-around
title with 38.15 points.
