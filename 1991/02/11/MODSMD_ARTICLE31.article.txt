# Waves or Tsunamis?
## Pepperdine defeats Stanford in five games 
### Kevin Jeffrey Staff writer 
The Stanford men's volleyball team
could have given itself the best record in the
NCAA's toughest conference and solidified
its standing as one of the elite teams in the
nation.
Instead, the fourth-ranked Cardinal
must prepare for their biggest road trip of
the year with a cloud of uncertainty hang
ing overhead after a dramatic five-game
loss to the Pepperdine Waves Friday at
Maples Pavilion.
The defeat halted both Stanford's five
match overall and 11-match home winning
streaks and left the Cardinal at 5-2 overall.
It also dropped them from the top spot in
the Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Asso
ciation's Harry Wilson division, as their 4-1
league record leaves them behind unbeaten
Long Beach State (2nd-ranked nationally,
4-0 in WTVA) and USC (No. 1, 3-0).
With their 10-15, 15-12, 15-13, 10-15,
15-10 victory, sixth-ranked Pepperdine
raised their overall record to 5-2 and their
2-2 WIVA mark leaves them behind UCLA
and Cal-State Northridge.
After the first game in which the Cardi
nal took an early lead and controlled all the
way, Pepperdine used their substantial
height advantage to thoroughly control the
match at the net. Sophomore middle
blocker Tom Sorenson was a constant
worry for Stanford, scoring on kills and
blocks at crucial points in the game. Last
year's NCAA Freshman Player of the Year
led Pepperdine with 22 kills but more
impressive was his .465 hitting percentage.
He seemed to make something positive hap
pen for the Waves every time he touched
the ball.
Throughout the match, the blocking
presence of Sorenson, middle blocker Brian
Merrick and outside hitter Duane Cameron
(10 blocks) created problems for Stanford's
outside hitters. The usually potent trio of

Dave Goss, Duncan Blackmo, and Bob Hill
man was held to a paltry .247 hitting per
centage.
As the Waves seemed to be focusing their
blocking strategy on the outside hitters, it
left open the middle for quick hits by Cardi
nal middle blocker Mike Lowe. Lowe had an
excellent night pounding 19 kills for a stel
lar .696 hitting percentage. But Stanford
wasn't able get the ball to Lowe and fellow
middle blockers John BezmalinoVic and
John Hribar nearly enough.
Whereas in previous matches against
Hawaii and BYU Stanford had been able to
get the important points and pull away at
the. end of tight games, Pepperdine played
that role on Friday night. The two key
sequences in the match came in the second
and third games with the score tied at 10-10
and 13-13, respectively. In both instances,
Stanford simply wasn't able to put together
the big plays.
. "We had a lot of respect for Pepperdine's
program coming into the match. But we
came out flat, and we played that way all
night," sophomore setter Jimmy Blackman
said.
In game two the Cardinal missed a cou
ple of serves after impressive side-outs, and
the Waves took advantage, running off four
straight points for a 14-10 lead and eventu
ally the victory.
The turning point of the match may
have come in the final moments of game
three. With the score tied at thirteen, the
Waves' Merrick made a diving dig on what
looked like a sure kill by Goss. Sorenson fol
lowed with a surprise scoring spike from
the back row to give Pepperdine a lead they
never relinquished.
