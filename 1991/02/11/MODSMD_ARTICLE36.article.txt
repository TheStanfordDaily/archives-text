# Soviet art attacks communist ideals

From the back of the room, the poster looks
like an image of Madonna and Child. With nar
rowed eyes, though, one begins to wonder why
the Virgin Mary is bald and sports a mous
tache — and what her child is doing with thick
black eyebrows and a cunning smile.
The Virgin Mary is, in fact, Vladimir Ilyich
Lenin; her child, Joseph Stalin.
The poster, which satirizes the Soviet pro
pagandists symbols of the past, might never
have seen the light of day a few years ago. It is
an example of a growing movement in Soviet
art that was spawned by the introduction of
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's pro
gram of glasnost.
About 30 such posters were the subject of a
presentation last Friday, titled "The End of
The Soviet Union," by Prof. Roman Laba of
Monterey's Naval Postgraduate School.
The professor of political science pho
tographed the posters during his stay in
Moscow last summer and presented the slides,
perhaps appropriately, in the Red Room of
Encina Hall.

The Red Star, once a sacred symbol of the
Communist Party, has been turned into a
device of political commentary about the
destructiveness of communism, Laba said.
One poster showed a half-red star filled with
the blood of communism's victims. Another
showed Stalin's profile against the backdrop of
a black sickle.
Until very recently, Lenin's image was
sacrosanct in Soviet society. Soviets could qui
etly criticize his rule or exchange rumors that
in his final days he crawled around the floor
like a farm animal, but defiling his person on
paper or canvas was strictly forbidden.
As Laba demonstrated through his slides,
even Lenin has now become a permissible sub
ject for artists' assaults on the past.
Of the posters that Laba showed,
"Madonna Lenin and Baby Stalin" evoked the
loudest laughter from the 50 audience mem
bers — students, faculty members and affili
ates of the lecture's sponsor, the Center for
Russian and East European Studies.
Before glasnost, artists were expected to
paint glorious renditions of a socialist utopia,
Laba said. In the official eye, a picture that
portrayed a farmer joyously digging a trench

and bore the slogan, "One who works will
achieve honor" was considered a masterpiece.
Soviet artists had a "unique ability to gen
erate sustaining myths," he added.
As is now apparent, Soviet artists have the
ability to break through and expose the propa
ganda they once sustained. Thanks to Gor
bachev's reforms, they can do this without
fear of persecution, he said.
Although the society may be more open,
however, there are few channels for Soviet cit
izens to voice their complaints. One of the
posters, titled "Glasnost," depicts a telephone
with no receiver.
Two posters portray the pessimism with
which Soviets look to the future. In one, blind
people lead their blind comrades in a long pro
cession to oblivion. "Where Are We Going?" is
written at the bottom of the poster. In the
other, a bleak vision of the 21st century, hazy
footsteps are shown stepping forward into a
mist.
Laba did not offer any insight into whether
the Soviet Union actually will come to an end
or what kind of mist the Soviets may be step
ping into.
