# Campbell discusses war at town forum
## 
### Peter Robison Staff writer 
In his town meeting yesterday,
Rep. Tom Campbell pronounced
his opposition to a draft as he
addressed a crowd that included
Stanford students with placards
that read, "There's blood on your
hands."
About 25 members of Stanford
Students for Peace in the Middle
East were among a crowd of about
200 who gathered at the Palo Alto
City Hall to hear Campbell's
remarks about the war.
The anti-war group was the
most visible Stanford contingent
at the meeting. Some of its mem
bers wore mock body bags to
protest Campbell's support of the
war.

However, the audience
appeared to be evenly split into
supporters and protesters of the
war. The two factions traded
applause as members of each side
directed questions to Campbell.
Campbell, R-Stanford, was the
only Bay Area congressman who
voted Jan. 13 to authorize Presi
dent Bush to use force in the Gulf.
In his opening remarks, Camp
bell said a ground war is "not
imminent," despite published
reports to the contrary. "Both
(Secretary of Defense) Dick
Cheney and (Chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff) Colin Powell
gave me the impression, in brief
ings, that a ground war will not
start soon," he said.
