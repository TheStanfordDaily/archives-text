# Campbell discusses war at town forum
## 
### Peter Robison Staff writer 
In his town meeting yesterday,
Rep. Tom Campbell pronounced
his opposition to a draft as he
addressed a crowd that included
Stanford students with placards
that read, "There's blood on your
hands."
About 25 members of Stanford
Students for Peace in the Middle
East were among a crowd of about
200 who gathered at the Palo Alto
City Hall to hear Campbell's
remarks about the war.
The anti-war group was the
most visible Stanford contingent
at the meeting. Some of its mem
bers wore mock body bags to
protest Campbell's support of the
war.

However, the audience
appeared to be evenly split into
supporters and protesters of the
war. The two factions traded
applause as members of each side
directed questions to Campbell.
Campbell, R-Stanford, was the
only Bay Area congressman who
voted Jan. 13 to authorize Presi
dent Bush to use force in the Gulf.
In his opening remarks, Camp
bell said a ground war is "not
imminent," despite published
reports to the contrary. "Both
(Secretary of Defense) Dick
Cheney and (Chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff) Colin Powell
gave me the impression, in brief
ings, that a ground war will not
start soon," he said.

At his town meeting yesterday at Palo Alto City Hall, Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Stanford, addresses an audi
ence split on war issues.
Campbell said he will oppose
any proposal to reinstate a mili
tary draft. "A resumption of the
draft is not likely, and if it is asked
for, I won't support it,"he said.
He added that conscription is "not
suggested by either side of the
debates" in Congress.
Many of the questions audience
members posed concerned the
objectives of U.S. policies. One

person was worried that the
administration's goals have
shifted from removing Iraqi
troops from Kuwait to destroying
Iraq itself.
Campbell responded that
"destroying the military capabil
ity of Iraq is appropriate in a time
of war." President Bush wants to
free Kuwait and "will not call for a
halt to the war until Saddam Hus
sein is removed from Kuwait,"
Campbell said.
Others at the meeting ques
tioned the economic costs of the

war. Campbell said although cost
is a serious concern, the Gulf war
"must be viewed as an unusual
circumstance, economically and
politically."
He said contributions pledged
by U.S. allies total $51 billion, but
the actual figure "may be less
than promised." To make up for
the shortfall, Campbell proposed
to impose an import tariff on the
goods of those countries whose
contributions are below U.S.
expectations.
Fifth-year senior Michael

Myers, a Students for Peace mem
ber, said the purpose of his
group's appearance at the meet
ing was to express outrage at U.S.
policy. "We wanted to come here
and express our opinions to Rep.
Campbell because he is in a posi
tion of power.
Myers said the group has been
dismayed by the Bush
administration's "lack of vision in
terms of the overall repercussions
of this war â€” for the Middle East
region, for the environment and
for domestic policy."
