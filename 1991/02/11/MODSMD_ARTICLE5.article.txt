# WAR IN THE GULF
## Major land war just 'weeks away' 
### 
DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) — The allied
air war pressed on without pause today, with
one Air Force forecaster calling it a "beautiful
day for bombing." Yet despite nearly a month
of pulverizing air raids, Saddam Hussein
insists Iraq is not beaten.
Senior U.S. officials have exuded confidence
that Saddam will be beaten when President
Bush decides to bring the war down to earth.
Today, there were clear signs that many believe
a land assault is two or three weeks
away.
One senior U.S. commander pointed yester
day to the need to move more soldiers and
equipment into place along the front, saying it
could take up to a month. Underscoring that,
Ml-Al main battle tanks — a key weapon in
any ground war — were being
shipped north today along Saudi
supply routes.
Saddam's defiant speech yes
terday on Baghdad radio was his
first nationwide broadcast since
three days after the war's first
bombs fell.
"Victory will restore to the
Iraqis all the requirements for a
free and honorable living that
they will merit as a reward for
their patience and steadfastness,"
he said in his address, excerpts of
which were carried by the official
Iraqi News Agency.
"Iraq is not ready to relinquish
the role given to it by God," he
said.
The fighting words stood in
stark contrast to conditions in
Saddam's capital. Baghdadis suf
fer from shortages of food, drink
ing water, medicine and fuel.
Horse-drawn carts are replacing
cars, water is drawn from the
Tigris River, and twigs are gath
ered for fuel.
Bush pronounced himself
unimpressed by Saddam's speech.
"I heard what Saddam Hussein
said, and I didn't hear him say
anything about him getting out of
Kuwait," he said yesterday in
Washington. "Of course, that's
what the whole world is wanting
to hear."

Bush was conferring today
with Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney, who paid a weekend visit
to the war zone. Cheney told
reporters in Saudi Arabia yester
day that the next phase of the
fighting — which would include
ground and amphibious action —
would be "decisive." He did not
suggest when it would begin.
In battlefield developments:
• A Saudi military source said
today he expected the allies to
keep the air campaign in the
realm of 2,500-3,000 sorties a day,
weather permitting. Skies were
clear today over the Arabian
peninsula, but activity at one
major base in Saudi Arabia
appeared light.
American warplanes flew 2,800
missions on Sunday, concentrat
ing on Republican Guard troops
on the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border.
• The military yesterday
reported the loss of the first U.S.
warplane in combat in more than
a week. The Marine AV-8 Harrier
was downed over southern
Kuwait on Saturday, and the pilot
was missing, the U.S. command
said.
• British warplanes reported
hitting four bridges in one raid
yesterday, including two pontoon
bridges recently put up to keep up
supplies to units of the elite
Republican Guard.
