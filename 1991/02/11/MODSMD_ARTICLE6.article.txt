# Recycling white paper new challenge
## 
### Robin Mathison 
Student residences have long been
home to collection bins for newspapers,
glass bottles, cans and junk mail. Now,
the Stanford Recycling Center has
decided to revive another program —
white paper recycling — in several cam
pus houses.
Separate white paper collection bins
were installed in 13 undergraduate resi
dences late last month by the recycling
center as a pilot program that will run
through this quarter. If successful, the
new system will be expanded to all cam
pus residences.
"We hope to collect an average of 100
pounds of white paper from each [par
ticipating] residence during the first
month," said Heidi Clark, one of the
center's public education co-managers.
"This will save approximately 13 addi
tional trees per month and also generate
revenue to cover the cost of the pilot
program."
The pilot program targets under
graduate residences because they hold
house meetings during which center
workers can educate students about
recycling, Clark said.
Residences participating in the pro

gram include Terra, Muwekma-Tah-
Ruk, Delta Kappa Epsilon, American
Studies House, the Enchanted Broccoli
Forest, Synergy, Haus Mitteleuropa and
all of Stern Hall.
The recycling center's public educa
tion staff has attended several dorm
meetings in participating residences to
introduce guidelines for proper white
paper recycling. Center manager Barb
Voss said if the program is expanded
campus-wide, additional efforts such as
fliers and slide shows may be used to
promote awareness.
Previous attempts at white paper col
lection have failed, mainly because
other materials, such as stickers, plastic
windows, spiral bindings, colored
inserts and glossy paper were mixed in,
said John Chang, Clark's co-manager.
"It's an ongoing battle to get differ
ent grades of paper separated out,"
Chang added.
However, continued student
requests, in addition to the environmen
tal and financial benefits of white paper
recycling, have motivated the center to
try again, he said.
"If it's not a significant task to pull
out bits of contamination, then it will be
a success," Chang added.

Voss said she hopes the greater focus
on education will pay off and the
attempt will be taken more seriously.
Recycling white paper will increase
the center's revenue. Selling white
paper valued at $80 to $90 per ton will
help the center support itself by subsi
dizing less profitable ventures such as
recycling junk mail.
Recycling mixed waste paper can only
produce newspapers, bags and other
low-grade products which are sold for
lower prices than white paper, Voss said.
The pilot program will not increase
the center's costs because spare collec
tion bins are being used and the partici
pating residences are on current pickup
routes, Voss said.
Even if white paper recycling is
expanded throughout the campus, the
additional revenue earned would cover
the cost of extra bins and higher sorting
fees, she added.
The center is currently under the
jurisdiction of Operations and Mainte
nance and is subsidized by the Univer
sity, according to Rachel Huddlestun, a
student employee. It is, however, look
ing to become an independent depart-
ment, she said.
In addition to earning more
revenues, the center wants to
recycle white paper separately
because the process does not
require bleaching and is therefore
"more environmentally sound
than [recycling! junk mail," Voss
said.
"Fewer by products (of bleach
ing) are created. Water and air
pollution are reduced," she said.
The chloride bleach used in
making new paper and in most
other paper recycling produces
dioxin, which is rinsed off the
paper and can seep into the water
supply.
Dioxin is "very very toxic and
cancer-producing. ... It spreads
rapidly throughout the environ
ment," Voss explained.
Clark said she is optimistic
about the program, based on the
success of existing white paper
collection programs in University
offices. The success of the pilot
program will be evaluated over
spring break, she said.
Although center employees are
optimistic about the new project,
Voss said she fears the added com
plexity will discourage students
from recycling properly. "Is the
program getting too time-con
suming?" she asked. "Will people
take the time to sort out their
white paper from their other
nj»
paper.'
Encouraged by receptive stu
dent responses so far, however,
Voss said she is confident that the
program will succeed.
"Any program like this relies
on the cooperation of the people
who live here," said graduate stu
dent Dan Connelly, who lives in
the Enchanted Broccoli Forest.
"People here are in general very
environmentally conscious. ... I

garbage last

record figure for
the campus.

wish people were more coopera
tive and didn't mix containers
and I wish people recycled more."
Students in other participating
residences seem equally receptive
to white paper recycling. "There's
never been a bin for it,' said
sophomore Susan Helfter, who
lives in Haus Mitt. "We need one
because there's never anywhere
to put white paper. We just throw
it in with the colored paper."
The white paper program is an
outgrowth of the center's goal of
increasing the "absolute mass" of
recycled material, Chang said.
The center is also trying to
increase the yield of existing recy
cled materials such as aluminum,
glass and junk mail.
Stanford recycled 26.7 percent
of its garbage last December, a
record figure for the campus that
"compares quite well to other
municipalities," Chang added.
According to state law, all
municipalities must recycle 50
percent of their garbage by the
year 2000.
Besides recycling, Chang
emphasized the need for conserv
ing and composting. In addition,
"Reducing the amount of dispos
able packaging you use" is as
important as recycling, he said.
Composting is a process of
recycling where leaves and grass
clippings are allowed to break
down and turn back into soil — a
critical compfonent of meeting
future recycling quotas.
