# Recycling white paper new challenge
## 
### Robin Mathison 
Student residences have long been
home to collection bins for newspapers,
glass bottles, cans and junk mail. Now,
the Stanford Recycling Center has
decided to revive another program —
white paper recycling — in several cam
pus houses.
Separate white paper collection bins
were installed in 13 undergraduate resi
dences late last month by the recycling
center as a pilot program that will run
through this quarter. If successful, the
new system will be expanded to all cam
pus residences.
"We hope to collect an average of 100
pounds of white paper from each [par
ticipating] residence during the first
month," said Heidi Clark, one of the
center's public education co-managers.
"This will save approximately 13 addi
tional trees per month and also generate
revenue to cover the cost of the pilot
program."
The pilot program targets under
graduate residences because they hold
house meetings during which center
workers can educate students about
recycling, Clark said.
Residences participating in the pro

gram include Terra, Muwekma-Tah-
Ruk, Delta Kappa Epsilon, American
Studies House, the Enchanted Broccoli
Forest, Synergy, Haus Mitteleuropa and
all of Stern Hall.
The recycling center's public educa
tion staff has attended several dorm
meetings in participating residences to
introduce guidelines for proper white
paper recycling. Center manager Barb
Voss said if the program is expanded
campus-wide, additional efforts such as
fliers and slide shows may be used to
promote awareness.
Previous attempts at white paper col
lection have failed, mainly because
other materials, such as stickers, plastic
windows, spiral bindings, colored
inserts and glossy paper were mixed in,
said John Chang, Clark's co-manager.
"It's an ongoing battle to get differ
ent grades of paper separated out,"
Chang added.
However, continued student
requests, in addition to the environmen
tal and financial benefits of white paper
recycling, have motivated the center to
try again, he said.
"If it's not a significant task to pull
out bits of contamination, then it will be
a success," Chang added.

Voss said she hopes the greater focus
on education will pay off and the
attempt will be taken more seriously.
Recycling white paper will increase
the center's revenue. Selling white
paper valued at $80 to $90 per ton will
help the center support itself by subsi
dizing less profitable ventures such as
recycling junk mail.
Recycling mixed waste paper can only
produce newspapers, bags and other
low-grade products which are sold for
lower prices than white paper, Voss said.
The pilot program will not increase
the center's costs because spare collec
tion bins are being used and the partici
pating residences are on current pickup
routes, Voss said.
Even if white paper recycling is
expanded throughout the campus, the
additional revenue earned would cover
the cost of extra bins and higher sorting
fees, she added.
The center is currently under the
jurisdiction of Operations and Mainte
nance and is subsidized by the Univer
sity, according to Rachel Huddlestun, a
student employee. It is, however, look
ing to become an independent depart-
