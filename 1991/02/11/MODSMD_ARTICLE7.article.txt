### Dan Stearns Staff writer 
A 25-member SWAT team was
called to the Palo Alto Holiday Inn
Hotel shortly after 11 a.m. yester
day to search for two burglars, at
least one of whom was believed
armed.
Twelve hours later, Palo Alto
police reported that the SWAT
team had not found the two sus
pects after an intense search and
that guests were being allowed to
return to their rooms.
The two were spotted earlier in
the morning by a hotel maid.
Police spokesperson Jean
Krahulen said the maid "inter
rupted the burglary" around 10
a.m. The two men reportedly
grabbed a suitcase and fled.
After Palo Alto police arrived
on the scene, a second hotel
employee said she spotted a man
running down a hall with a gun in
his belt. The SWAT team, com
posed of officers from various
local police departments, was then
called in.
The hotel is located at the inter
section of University Avenue and
El Camino Real, across from the
Palm Drive entrance to Stanford.
Hotel administrators said they
estimated about 30 guests were in
the hotel at the time of the rob
bery. The staff called guests in
their rooms and instructed them
to remain there, while those out
side their rooms and other arriv
ing guests were moved to a restau
rant next door.
At 5:30 p.m. the first guests
were allowed to leave their room.
They were four San Francisco
teenagers who were participating
in a speech and debate contest
held at Stanford.
Sasha Madfes, a senior at
George Washington High School,
said she and her three school
mates dashed into the bathroom
of their room early in the after
noon after a SWAT officer came
tapping at their window.
"We were scared when we saw
the SWAT people," Madfes said.
"It was like the stuff in a movie.
They were like ninjas. They
knocked at our door and said they
were the police. I asked them,
'How do I know that?'"
Several other guests who were
allowed to leave later in the
evening related similar stories. "I
opened the door and had six guns
staring at me." said Greg Rem
biszewski, a Chicago businessman.
Hotel management expressed
concern for the guests during the
SWAT team search. "This has been
an inconvenience for the guests.
Our main concern is for them, and
it is completely out of our hands,"
said a hotel administrator who
asked to remain anonymous.
