# Students take action to save Row houses
## Residents say future of co-ops in doubt 
### Sarah Morisseau Staff writer 
The University's Jan. 24 decision to tear
down the old, earthquake-damaged Syn
ergy, Phi Psi and Delta Tau Delta houses
has angered several students into action to
try to save those residences.
Many members of the three communi
ties said they are upset they were left out of
the decision and feel the University is more
committed to money than to its students.
Because Synergy and Phi Psi are co-opera
tives, some fear the decision places the
future of similar houses in doubt.
"They can't just sit on us and pretend
we're going to lap up any decision they
make," said senior Myia Johnson, a Syn
ergy resident.
Originally, University officials promised
to repair the student residences located on
San Juan Hill overlooking the Theta Xi
house. The three houses were damaged in
the Earthquake of 1989.
But because of the difference between
projected and actual costs of repairing
Columbae and several other houses over
the summer, administrators decided to tear

down the hill houses. The land will be used
to build faculty housing, and the revenue
from the sale of those houses will fund
more undergraduate student housing.
University officials say the three groups
will be allowed to remain in their current
locations.
"Nobody is going to deny that money
was a big factor (in the decision), but look
ing at the whole picture the decision made
was the one that made the most sense to
the whole campus community," Row Direc
tor Jack Chin said.
But the decision doesn't make a lot of
sense to the Delts or members of Synergy or
Phi Psi.
"There's no way I support this decision,"
said Delt President Rob Robbins. "If you
want to be a top-notch institution and have
students become good alums, you can't just
take every chance you have to make a
buck."
"They're putting money ahead of stu
dent life," he added.
The demolition will save the University
$2.8 million, but the group of people work-

Seniors Tom Boellstorff, left, and Eric Rose, both members of Synergy, are part of a group of students trying to save three
Row houses scheduled for demolition following the October 1989 earthquake. The land will be used for faculty housing,
and proceeds from the sale of the houses to faculty will be applied to construction of new undergraduate housing, Uni
versity officials have said.
ing to save the houses say the
houses' historical value is more
important. They said they are try
ing to have the Phi Psi house,
which is approximately 100 years
old, declared an historic site.
"It's like selling off historical
value just to get money," said Syn
ergy resident Eric Rose, a senior.
"To get something declared as
a national historical site you
pretty much have to have the sup
port of the owner, which we cer
tainly don't have," Johnson said,
"but we're trying anyway."
In addition, the group has
started circulating a petition
against the decision and is writing
letters to alumni asking them to
donate money and pressure Uni
versity President Donald
Kennedy to reverse the decision.
"Ultimately, we can stand in
front of bulldozers," said Rob Lev
itsky, a landlord of nine co-ops in
Palo Alto. At a time when negative
stories about the University
abound in the newspapers, "It
probably wouldn't be a good time
for another front-page article on
students staring down the front of
bulldozers to save old houses," he
added.
"If the University stonewalls
the whole thing, shoves it down
our throats, won't open up and let
us raise money . . . then that
forces us to do that," he explained.
"Our goal is to make this an
open process so we can save one of
those houses," Levitsky said.
While the Delts are just as
eager to move back into their orig
inal house, their efforts to do so
are not as strong.
"Getting the hill house back
would be ideal, but the chances
are slim," Robbins said. "We're
talking to people like [Chin], but
we're pretty much at the mercy of
the University."

Levitsky also said he feels at
the mercy of the University, but
for different reasons. He, like oth
ers, is afraid the co-ops are going
to be lost.
"They fixed Roble (Hall and)
Don Kennedy's house, but Phi
Psi? They just said, 'we're tearing
it down,'" Levitsky said.
"Promises were made at the
time of the earthquake (to fix the
houses). They followed through
on Columbae and conveniently
didn't follow through on others. I
think some people deliberately
didn't speak the truth there,"
Levitsky said.
Johnson said, "What they're
not recognizing is the need for
diversity in student housing. Liv
ing in a co-op was a precious part
of my experience at Stanford. I
stopped out for two years and I
wouldn't have come back if I
didn't have the opportunity to live
there," she added.
Levitsky noted, "The adminis
tration doesn't seem concerned
with those who don't want the
standard 10 ft.-by-lO ft. cin
derblock dorm room."
Johnson and Levitsky both
said they feel moving Synergy and
Phi Psi to different locations takes
away from the houses' atmo
sphere.
"You can't realistically just put
people in dorms," Levitsky said.
"You can't possibly re-create the
environment there on the hill.
Where will there be space for a
chicken coop like we had at Syn
ergy?"
The University denies all alle
gations that they are trying to
weed the co-ops out of the housing
system and asserts that officials
are doing everything possible to
accommodate the wishes of the
displaced students.
Keith Guy, director of Housing
and Food Service, called the co-op
system "thriving," and noted the
seven Stanford co-ops are fully
supported by his department and
the Office of Student Affairs.

Guy said the three communi
ties that had lost their houses
would be retained. "This shows
we support the co-ops and there is
not a plan to do away with them."
"The co-ops are going to con
tinue as long as people want to
live in them," he added.
Acting Assoc. Dean of Student
Affairs Diana Conklin said the
groups themselves will decide
where they will live. "They are
welcome to stay in their current
locations indefinitely, but if they
feel strongly that they should
move, we'll put them" in another
house, she said.
"The primary goal is to make
sure [the Deltsl have a house on
the row," Fraternal Affairs
Adviser Michael Ramsey-Perez
said.
Another large complaint from
the student faction is that the
decision to tear down the houses
was made without any student
input.
"I wish the whole situation had
been handled differently. They
dropped a bombshell on us — we
had no idea what was coming,"
Robins said.
"We need to be involved in the
negotiations," Johnson said.
"They need to rescind their deci
sion until there is discussion on
it."
Guy said students were left out
of the decision-making process
because "it needed to be looked at
administratively" but added he
could understand the feeling of
being left out.
"It's unfortunate that there
were no students on the commit
tee, but there was a sense of
urgency," Chin said.
Conklin said, "I know (stu
dents' views) weren't ignored.
They were voiced very strongly by
those of us in Student Affairs."
"The hill is designed for faculty
housing," said Conklin. "I'm
really sad to see those houses go,
but it is inescapable."
