# Students take action to save Row houses
## Residents say future of co-ops in doubt 
### Sarah Morisseau Staff writer 
The University's Jan. 24 decision to tear
down the old, earthquake-damaged Syn
ergy, Phi Psi and Delta Tau Delta houses
has angered several students into action to
try to save those residences.
Many members of the three communi
ties said they are upset they were left out of
the decision and feel the University is more
committed to money than to its students.
Because Synergy and Phi Psi are co-opera
tives, some fear the decision places the
future of similar houses in doubt.
"They can't just sit on us and pretend
we're going to lap up any decision they
make," said senior Myia Johnson, a Syn
ergy resident.
Originally, University officials promised
to repair the student residences located on
San Juan Hill overlooking the Theta Xi
house. The three houses were damaged in
the Earthquake of 1989.
But because of the difference between
projected and actual costs of repairing
Columbae and several other houses over
the summer, administrators decided to tear

down the hill houses. The land will be used
to build faculty housing, and the revenue
from the sale of those houses will fund
more undergraduate student housing.
University officials say the three groups
will be allowed to remain in their current
locations.
"Nobody is going to deny that money
was a big factor (in the decision), but look
ing at the whole picture the decision made
was the one that made the most sense to
the whole campus community," Row Direc
tor Jack Chin said.
But the decision doesn't make a lot of
sense to the Delts or members of Synergy or
Phi Psi.
"There's no way I support this decision,"
said Delt President Rob Robbins. "If you
want to be a top-notch institution and have
students become good alums, you can't just
take every chance you have to make a
buck."
"They're putting money ahead of stu
dent life," he added.
The demolition will save the University

Seniors Tom Boellstorff, left, and Eric Rose, both members of Synergy, are part of a group of students trying to save three
Row houses scheduled for demolition following the October 1989 earthquake. The land will be used for faculty housing,
and proceeds from the sale of the houses to faculty will be applied to construction of new undergraduate housing, Uni
versity officials have said.
