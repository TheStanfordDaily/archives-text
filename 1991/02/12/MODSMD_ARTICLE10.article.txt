# ASSU election rules debated in meeting
## Early declarations may be punished 
### Miranda Doyle Staff writer 
ASSU election officials and
potential candidates in this
spring's elections squared off at
an information meeting last night
over when candidacy can officially
be declared.
The election bylaws prohibit
campaigning before April 10 â€”
one week before the elections are
held. ASSU Hearings Officer
Doreen Musson said campaigning
includes any announcements in
the press about a candidate's
intention to run.
Several students attending the
meeting said they objected to this
interpretation because slates are
announced at open meetings
before April 10 and could be
printed by the press at that time.
"I do not think individuals
should be held responsible for the
actions of student publications,"
said Deputy Senate Chair Beth
Morgan, a sophomore.
Graduate student Neil Crellin
called the rule absurd. "We are
establishing a dangerous prece
dent in restricting the freedom of
speech of the candidates," he said.
But Musson, a graduate stu
dent, said she would hold candi
dates responsible for premature
announcements. "The onus is on
them to keep it secret," she said,
adding that they will have to show
they did not purposely reveal
their candidacy.
If candidates are found guilty
of violating the bylaws, they may
be disqualified, she said.
John Overdeck, a graduate
senator, said he believes there are
too many campaigning rules in
general. "Some are very silly and
would lead to insane conclusions,"
he added.
Crellin agreed, saying, "These
are very restrictive rules. They
are not workable because you can

not enforce this kind of thing."
Musson said she believes there
must be some discipline in every
campaign. None of her rulings is
official until it is posted in the
ASSU offices.
The rule regarding campaign
ing is not a new one, Musson said.
There have been two other
changes in the election bylaws
since last year's election. The
ASSU Senate voted last week to
restrict the number of fliers a can
didate may distribute and to cut
the campaign expense limits by 20
percent.
The flier limit is "related to an
effort to reduce littering," said
Elections Commissioner Raul
Lopez. Candidates for the senate
may distribute a maximum of 500
fliers, while slates for the Council
of Presidents are limited to 750.
"This is not to limit freedom of
expression but to make the cam
pus look better," said Lopez, a
graduate student.
The ASSU Elections Commis
sion has also hired a computer
programmer to tally the votes.
"We are not going to lose a single
vote," Lopez said. "We will be cre
ating a system to eliminate
human and computer errors."
He said last year's recount
changed the vote totals and
although the election results were
not affected, many people were
upset. This year, the new system
should increase the reliability of
the results.
Lopez said another change will
involve an increase in the number
of polling places in an attempt to
reach more people.
Declarations of intent to run
are due March 12 to be included in
the election handbook and ballot.
"We must get more people to run.
There are so many issues that are
important on this campus," Mus
son said.
