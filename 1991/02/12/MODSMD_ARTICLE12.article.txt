Civil rights groups criticize Harvard
BOSTON (AP) — Several civil rights groups said yesterday
they will support a lawsuit by Harvard Law School students who
claim the school discriminates against women and minorities
when hiring faculty.
The students are scheduled to face a showdown later this
week in Middlesex Superior Court when Harvard plans to ask a
judge to dismiss the suit.
Harvard says the students are not in a legal position to raise
charges of employer discrimination, and also that they are paint
ing an inaccurate picture of the law school's recent hiring his
tory.
But civil rights advocates disagreed.
"Harvard is not moving in the direction it should toward
diversity," said Ozell Hudson Jr., executive director of the Boston
affiliate of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.
Hudson's group, as well as the state chapters of the National
Lawyers' Guild, the National Conference of Black Lawyers and
several other organizations signed a brief backing the lawsuit
filed last year by the Harvard students.
The students, who formed a group called the Harvard Coali
tion for Civil Rights, said in their lawsuit that Harvard Law
School has failed to hire any minority women, Asian-Americans,
Native Americans, Latinos or openly homosexual men or women
to tenured or tenure-track faculty positions.
Bilingual education works, study shows
WASHINGTON (AP) — Bilingual education programs help
Spanish-speaking children excel in school, according to a study
released Monday by the Education Department.
The study found that Spanish-speaking students in bilingual
classes grew academically as fast as students in the general stu
dent population. But it also found that most of the teachers were
not as effective as they should be. The study was conducted by
Aguirre International of San Mateo, Calif.
"Based on this study, we can conclude that bilingual education
benefits students," said acting Education Secretary Ted Sanders,
"and school administrators can choose the method best suited to
their students, confident that if well-implemented, it will reap
positive results."
Bilingual education programs help children who speak very lit
tle English learn the language so that they can enter regular
classrooms.
After years of controversy over how to teach English to immi
grant children, Congress decided the federal government should
support a variety of education programs.
Top Soviet journalist defends censorship
MOSCOW (AP) — The head of Soviet broadcasting yesterday
defended continued news censorship and said he has altered news
reports for political reasons.
Since Leonid Kravchenko took over Soviet broadcasting in
November, the main news program has sometimes reverted from
wide-ranging political reporting to little more than readings of
government announcements. The most daring shows have been
pulled from the air.
"On state television, we can have censorship," said Leonid
Kravchenko, citing limits on coverage of the Gulf war that have
been imposed by other governments.
Kravchenko also said that in his previous position as head of
the official Soviet news agency Tass, he altered news reports for
political reasons during last year's ethnic violence in Azerbaijan.
