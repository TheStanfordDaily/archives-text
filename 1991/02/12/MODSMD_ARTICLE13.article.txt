Los Angeles loses five officers in a week

LOS ANGELES (AP) - A Sal
vadoran gunman shot and killed a
policewoman as she was getting
out of her patrol car early yester
day, the first female Los Angeles
police officer killed in the line of
duty, investigators said.
Officer Tina Kerbrat, 34, the
mother of two children, ages 3 and
6, and who had been on the police
force only 10 months, was killed
near the Sun Valley Recreation
Center, 15 miles north of down
town. Her husband is a city fire
fighter.
"She was shot in an absolutely
senseless situation. She had no
chance at all," said an angry Police
Chief Daryl Gates, who con
demned lax federal immigration
regulations for the gunman's
presence in this country.
"It is clearly a failure of our
immigration service which does
not pay attention to those who
shouldn't be here," said Gates,
who referred to the assailant as
"an El Salvadoran drunk who
doesn't belong here."
It was the second time in recent
months that one of Gates' officers
was killed by an illegal immigrant.
A Hungarian man shot and killed
Detective Russell Kuster, 50, last
Oct. 9 at a Hollywood Hills restau
rant.
Kerbrat was in the front pas
senger seat of a patrol car driven
by Officer Earl Valladares at 12:30
a.m. when they decided to stop
and question two men sitting on
the sidewalk and drinking beer,
investigators said.
Before the officers got out of

the patrol car, one of the men
pulled out a .357 Magnum and
opened fire, fatally wounding Ker
brat, investigators said. She died
in surgery at Pacifica Hospital.
Valladares, 45, a 20-year
department veteran who wasn't
wounded, fired 10 times at the
gunman, Jose Amaya, 32, killing
him.
"There's been a lot of talk
about women in combat these
days," Gates said during a profan
ity-laced news conference at
Parker Center.
"The Los Angeles Police
Department's women are in com
bat all the time."
"There's a war right here and
it's been fierce. ... If you think
the war is just in the Persian Gulf,
you are wrong. Our casualties are
greater in proportion to the casu
alties in the Persian Gulf.
Police took the other beer
drinker, James Welch, 24, to the
North Hollywood station where
he was being held for violating
parole on a cocaine conviction.
Gates said Welch was a member
of a San Fernando Valley street
gang, which was responsible for
the death of North Hollywood sta
tion Officer James Beyea on June
7, 1988.
The Kerbrat killing was the lat
est in a rash of police-involved
shootings this month, said Lt.
William Hall, head of the depart
ment's officer-involved-shooting
investigation team.
"I don't know what's going on
this week. This is the fifth officer
that's been shot this week," said
Hall.
