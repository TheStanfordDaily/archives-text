## Army has to change 
### 
Women should not be
prevented from filling
combat roles anymore

ONE OF THE MOST BASIC
principles underlying the
U.S. military system is that
it is a system based on merit. As a
result, the armed forces should
strive towards egalitarianism, in
every facet of military life.
To do this, the military must
change its discriminatory policy
toward women.
At present, women are not
allowed in combat. As a result,
they are barred from being fighter
pilots and holding infantry posi
tions. In addition, women are lim
ited to a mere 10 percent of ROTC
positions.
The reasons for barring women
from combat are not at all com
pelling, but are outdated.
Quite simply, the military is
dragging its feet.
The military knows that the
image of a woman soldier being
taken as a prisoner of war is repul
sive to most American citizens.
There is the concern that women
soldiers could be subjected to sex
ual abuse by the enemy.
However, both men and women
are the victims of war. The horrors
to which POWs can be subjected
are not limited to or epitomized by
sexual abuse.
And, though women in the mili
tary currently cannot fight, they
still live with the threat of being
taken as a POW.
Frequently during war there is a
spoken or unspoken thought that
the battle is being fought to protect
a society's women and children. By
allowing women in combat, the
military would dispel such an
image.
Many of the arguments for bar

ring women from combat cite the
physical differences between men
and women as a justification. Most
of these arguments have been
made obsolete with technological
advancements in the military.
For example, there is no reason
that women cannot be fighter
pilots. The military should not con
tinue to fabricate one.
Other arguments, like the claim
that the inclusion of women in
combat would require an unwar
ranted increase of facilities, are
exaggerated. If modesty is the pri
mary concern, in times of war
there are many concerns which
transcend this issue.
Finally, there is the legitimate
concern that undue hardship
would be placed on children with
two parents in the military. When
both parents are up for duty one
should be exempted.
Such questions have already
been raised for the reserves and are
being discussed by Congress. How
ever, there is no reason it should
always be the mother who is
excluded.
The primary result of limiting
the role of women in the military is
that it severely limits a woman's
chance for promotion.
Distinction and advancement in
the armed forces is closely tied to
combat performance, and no
woman will ever be able to rise past
a certain level of leadership in the
military until she is allowed to
prove herself on the battlefield.
By admitting — and, if a draft is
ever reinstated, conscripting —
women to combat roles, the U.S.
military would not lower its stan
dards, it would just increase the
number of individuals competing
on an even footing in the current
system.
The U.S. military should end its
discriminatory practices now. The
result would bring the military
closer to the meritocracy to which
it aspires.
