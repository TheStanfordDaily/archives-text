## Ignorance is not strength 
### 
SEVERAL OBSERVERS OF the war
against Iraq have noted the curious
vocabulary used by officials to
describe the conflict.
The "Newspeak" focuses on the num
ber of "sorties" and successful missions.
Human damage to the enemy is deliber
ately de-emphasized. Metaphors bor
rowed from non-military areas abound
(surgical attacks, penetration, etc.), and
civilian deaths in Iraq and Kuwait are
considered "collateral damage."
Even more disturbing than this curi
ous use of language is how receptive most
people are to it. This shows the power of
media-supported conditioning to shape
the opinions of the people. The U.S. gov
ernment seems to share at least one slo
gan with that of the Oceanian govern
ment in Orwell's "1984": "Ignorance is
Strength" — the less Americans know
about the enemy country and its people,
the better.
Recent studies have shown an alarm
ing ignorance about the world among
American students. Most international
students don't need a study to tell them
that. (How many of you know where the
Netherlands is and what language(s) the
inhabitants speak?) The internal world
map of many Americans must look a lot
like old maps of Africa: lots of white
space, a few names in approximately the
right locations and pictures of the strange
creatures who must dwell in those far-off
places.
This widespread ignorance about the
world is crucial in enabling Americans to
disregard the humanity of foreign people.
Former President Ronald Reagan once

reassured Americans that he would make
sure any potential nuclear war with the
Soviet Union would be fought in Europe.
To him, Europe was a convenient, dis
tant battlefield, not a continent of several
hundred million people — including his
NATO allies — who would much rather
prefer not to fight a war at all. In the pre
sent war, as in any armed conflict, it is
impossible to avoid civilian deaths com
pletely. But I find it reprehensible that
those deaths are reduced to "collateral
damage."
The ability of the U.S. government and
the media to mold the opinions of the
American people recalls the description of
the alliances in "1984." A former ally
becomes a sworn enemy from one
moment to the next, for reasons which
are vague at best, and the people follow
along like well-trained animals. They
know nothing about Eurasia and east
Asia, except that one is a faithful ally with
freedom-loving people and the other an
evil enemy, whose people are mad and
treacherous.
Does this ring a bell? Not too long ago,
Saddam Hussein was considered a valu
able ally in the Middle East because he
fought Iran, a U.S. enemy at that time.
One of the more frightening side
effects of the conditioning and ignorance
of the people is the recent rise of anti-Ara
bic violence. Racist and xenophobic senti
ments do not just arise in a vacuum; they
are fostered by the continuous black-and
white portrayal of enemies and friends by
the government and the media.
This starts at a young age. In Sunday's
New York Times, Anna Quindlen

reported a psychologist's response to an
elementary school child who expressed a
concern for Iraqi children, "I know it is
frightening, but it is all happening very
far away."
Do we really want to teach children
that they need not worry about events
that happen abroad, to people of different
cultures?
I have been asked whether I am willing
to bicycle to work for the rest of my life,
the tenuous implication being that with
out this war, oil would become unafford
able. My response is: If your hometown
were to be razed and all inhabitants killed
unless you biked to work for the rest of
your life, would you be willing to do so? If
so, are the people killed in this war,
because they are of a different culture,
less human than those in your home
town?
All wars should be evaluated like that:
If all civilian casualties of the war were to
be people just like you, fellow citizens,
would you still think the war necessary?
If so, then it may in fact be a just war; if
not, we should find a different solution.
Above all, we must not close our eyes
to the realities of war and portray the
civilians on the other side as somehow
less human or deserving of life than our
selves.
