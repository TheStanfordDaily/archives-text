## Bridging the distance: writing to a friend in the Gulf 
### 
Addressed to Sgt. Wayne Abbott
Somewhere in the Saudi Arabian desert
DEAR WAYNE, How are things
going there? I hope this letter
reaches you safely.
The ground war looms in the Gulf, a
darkened cloud bank heavy with the
promise of death and destruction. The
anchor on CNN looks soberly into my
eyes, predicting unmeasurable tragedy.
My mind turns back to a simpler time,
before the war, before Stanford, when I
went to a small junior college in Texas
with a man named Wayne Abbott.
Wayne was my best friend; now he is a
soldier. Once he was a short, smiling,
wide-eyed guy whose mouth rattled off
like a machine gun. Now he smiles less,
and carries a machine gun of a more
lethal variety.
. . . Remember our old physics profes
sor? I can still hear him say "Physics is
like a poker game. ..."
In the good old days, Wayne and I
climbed up the slope of engineering
physics into the highest levels of math
and science that our junior college
offered, and though we sold our week
days to our school, our jobs and the
mundane affairs of everyday life, the

days to our school, our jobs, and the mundane
affairs of everyday life, the weekends were ours.

weekends were ours.
On the weekends, we did the normal
things best friends do together when
they're young and independent.
We explored all of Fort Worth â€” the
movies, the dance clubs, the parks. We
rented movies and watched them on my
VCR. We stayed up until four in the
morning and talked about the meaning
of life, the plausibility of time travel and
which girls we liked.
It didn't matter what we did, just as
long as we did it together. On the week
ends, we were friends, compadres, ami
gos.
Except when he did his reserve duty.
.. . Things here at Stanford are great.

I'm doing well this quarter. Classes are
a lot better and I like my professors, but
sometimes things get hectic. . . .
On the television, the Army sounds
like a great deal. "Earn money for col
lege." "Serve your country on your own
time." "Be all you can be."
Working only once a month and two
weeks a year, Wayne not only saw a
steady paycheck each month, but he also
got help paying his college bills. More
than that, he got to jump out of air
planes, wear a red beret, and impress his
friends with the macho, militaiy bullshit
18-and 19-year-old boys fall for.
What could be better?
Wayne was assigned to a Special Oper-

ations Unit, something to do with Psy
chological Operations A lot of what he
did was classified, so he couldn't toll rne
about it. He even spoke some other lan
guage, but couldn't let me know which
one. I wonder if he spoke Arabic.
... I'm sorry I haven't kept in touch....
After I came to Stanford, Wayne and I
grew apart. Sometimes ties of friendship
are rigid and won't stretch so far. I guess
I should have kept in touch. It's been
two years since I talked to him, but I still
worry about him. He's still my friend.
But I don't know what to say to him.
I make small talk about small things,
as if the war didn't exist, as if he weren't
buried in some bunker, gas mask by his
side, waiting for the eventual attack,
worried about the gas or Scuds, wonder
ing if he would die and praying that he
wouldn't.
After all that time we spent together,
all those weekends, I don't know what to
say to him now. Now that he's over there
and I'm here. Now that he's in danger of
losing everything, and I'm not.
I miss you. Everyone is proud of you.
And most of all:
Come home soon.
