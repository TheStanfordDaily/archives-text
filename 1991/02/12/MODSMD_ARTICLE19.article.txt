# Student groups praise task force suggestions, urge implementation
## 
### 
We, members of independent student
groups working as a coalition, are writ
ing in support of the Stanford Sexual
Assault Task Force's recently released
policy recommendations.
The task force was formed in
response to a 1989 Stanford survey,
which found alarming rates of sexual
coercion on this campus. Task force

members have been working for over a
year formulating policy recommenda
tions, which, ideally, will be implemented
immediately.
We emphasize the urgency of creating
the position of Coordinator of Sexual
Assault Response Services, as recom
mended in the report. Students have lim
ited time to devote on a consistent basis,
which inhibits the efficiency of our
groups.
Moreover, with students graduating
every year, our turnover rate is high.
The position of a coordinator would be
an institutionalized way to ensure that
our efforts continue, and having the

coordinator would allow us to spend our
time on substantive, rather than organi
zational, efforts. On a group level, the
coordinator would assist in enhancing
communication among our organiza
tions.
According to the task force's recom
mendations, the coordinator would also
serve as an advocate for students who
are reporting sexual assaults.
In this capacity, the coordinator would
fulfill a role that currently does not exist
at Stanford, but one that would be used
by the many survivors of sexual assault
on campus.
Other recommendations outlined in

the report, including that of developing
and adopting a formal written policy on
unacceptable sexual conduct and that of
amending the Legislative and Judicial
Charter of 1968, also deserve rapid
implementation.
The task force's report and subse
quent institutionalized changes would
serve as a sign of the University's recog
nition that rape is indeed a problem on
campus and one deserving of continued
attention.
