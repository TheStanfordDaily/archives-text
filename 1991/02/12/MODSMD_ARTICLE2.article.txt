# Cold snap, disease plague eucalyptus trees
## 
### David Hirning Senior staff writer 
Groves of the stately eucalyptus
tree, a long-time campus trademark,
are slowly being decimated by a host of
afflictions.
Already plagued the last several
years by a mysterious disease that kills
in a matter of weeks, the century-old
trees have had to contend with a
severe drought, parasitic beetles, and
— most recently — a crippling late-
December freeze.
But despite increased spending and
attention to the problem, campus

grounds crews say there isn't much
they can do to prevent the losses.
"The problem is much worse than it
was last year," said Herbert Fong,
manager of grounds and custodial ser
vices. "We've had some very large trees
hurt by the freeze."
The cost of locating and removing
the arboreal casualties has mush
roomed in the last year, becoming a
significant problem for Fong's depart
ment. The removal of eucalyptus trees,
last year estimated at $6,000, will cost
about $80,000 this academic year —
more than half the entire grounds bud
get allocation for trees.

The eucalyptus, which is native to
Australia, is the most prevalent tree on
campus and was planted by Leland
Stanford as part of his exotic "Stan
ford Arboretum." There are signifi
cant numbers of eucalyptuses near
Stanford Stadium, in the grove near
the Track House at Galvez Street and
in the area between Palm Drive and
the Stanford Medical Center.
Fong said the extent of the damage
caused by temperatures in the low
teens over winter break will not be
fully evaluated until later in the
spring. At that time, campus crews will
begin to cut down the dead trees that

stand in hazardous areas near roads
and walkways.
"We're almost running a logging
business," Fong said. "We're having
problems with disposal of the large
pieces of wood." The grounds depart
ment is currently attempting to con
tract out the disposal, he said.
The freeze "has definitely created a
considerable amount of additional
work that we hadn't anticipated,"
Fong said.
In the spring, however, Fong and
other officials will have to face perhaps
