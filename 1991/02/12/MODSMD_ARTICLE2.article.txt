# Cold snap, disease plague eucalyptus trees
## 
### David Hirning Senior staff writer 
Groves of the stately eucalyptus
tree, a long-time campus trademark,
are slowly being decimated by a host of
afflictions.
Already plagued the last several
years by a mysterious disease that kills
in a matter of weeks, the century-old
trees have had to contend with a
severe drought, parasitic beetles, and
— most recently — a crippling late-
December freeze.
But despite increased spending and
attention to the problem, campus

grounds crews say there isn't much
they can do to prevent the losses.
"The problem is much worse than it
was last year," said Herbert Fong,
manager of grounds and custodial ser
vices. "We've had some very large trees
hurt by the freeze."
The cost of locating and removing
the arboreal casualties has mush
roomed in the last year, becoming a
significant problem for Fong's depart
ment. The removal of eucalyptus trees,
last year estimated at $6,000, will cost
about $80,000 this academic year —
more than half the entire grounds bud
get allocation for trees.

The eucalyptus, which is native to
Australia, is the most prevalent tree on
campus and was planted by Leland
Stanford as part of his exotic "Stan
ford Arboretum." There are signifi
cant numbers of eucalyptuses near
Stanford Stadium, in the grove near
the Track House at Galvez Street and
in the area between Palm Drive and
the Stanford Medical Center.
Fong said the extent of the damage
caused by temperatures in the low
teens over winter break will not be
fully evaluated until later in the
spring. At that time, campus crews will
begin to cut down the dead trees that

stand in hazardous areas near roads
and walkways.
"We're almost running a logging
business," Fong said. "We're having
problems with disposal of the large
pieces of wood." The grounds depart
ment is currently attempting to con
tract out the disposal, he said.
The freeze "has definitely created a
considerable amount of additional
work that we hadn't anticipated,"
Fong said.
In the spring, however, Fong and
other officials will have to face perhaps
the most Serious threat to the
trees — the eucalyptus long
horned borer.
That beetle, Phoracantha
semipunctata, first appeared in
the Bay Area in July 1989 after
migrating from Southern Califor
nia. In May, beetles will hatch in
the Stanford eucalyptus groves.
If initial indications are correct
and the parasite survived the
frost, the beetles will begin to ful
fill their only function in life:
destroying eucalyptus trees.
The longhorned borer poses a
more serious problem than the
aptly named "Sudden Death," a
bacterial disease that has infected
a number of eucalyptus trees on
campus since 1988.
"It's not as definite a problem"
as the borer, said Larry Costello,

an environmental horticulture
adviser for the University of Cali
fornia Cooperative Extension. "
'Sudden Death' has been very
spotty. ... It hasn't shown any
indications of spreading."
However, "The population (of
the borer) has pretty much
exploded out there," said Steve
Scott, an entomologist for the
California Department of
Forestry.
Although researchers at UC-
Riverside are trying to find ways
to eradicate the beetles, there is
currently no available method
The longhorned borer can
flourish here because of the trees'
already debilitated defense sys
tems, Scott explained. Healthy
eucalyptus trees can produce
kino, a sap that drowns beetle lar
vae. But Stanford's "stressed"
trees, which have been weakened
by the long drought and the
freeze, cannot.
