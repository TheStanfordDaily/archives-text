## John Keisling Threat posed by Saddam demands assertive American response 
### 
SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE
war in the Gulf, it has seemed to
me that many students, both here
and elsewhere, are in favor of immediate
peace — ending the hostilities at once
and bringing all the troops home.
Several students draw parallels to the
Vietnam War: a sort of political football
game in which our troops are expected to
fight "with one hand tied behind their
backs."
Others argue that our only reason for
being there is for low oil prices, or to
ensure that Saddam Hussein's invasion
of Kuwait and egregious human rights
violations do not warrant a full-scale
war.
Some see racism in the conflict, or
"classism," while some seem to believe
Saddam's claims of legitimate
sovereignty over Kuwait and of being the
leader of a new, strong pan-Arabism. In
any case, they argue for "peace now."
I find these beliefs disturbing and, for
the most part, misguided, for several rea
sons.
First, Saddam has shown time and
again that he has no respect for interna
tional law concerning human rights, the
banning of chemical weapons or any
other issue.
He has attempted to eliminate most of
the Kurdish population in his country,
using poison gas and other methods, and
he has imposed a rigid military dictator
ship on his citizens, executing anyone
who dares to disagree.
Even to his own people, Saddam is an
oppressive tyrant.

But his ambition extends to other
sovereign nations, not limited to Kuwait.
There is little doubt that Iraqi forces
would have also taken Saudi Arabia had
the United Nations (particularly the
United States) not opposed him so
strongly.
The crimes against humanity under
Saddam were intensified in Kuwait to an
incredible degree; not only was the coun
try overrun, but its citizens were
subjected to torture, rape and summary
executions.
It is highly doubtful that Saddam was
acting as the liberator he claims to be.
Further, once the war began, the Scud
attacks on Israel, a neutral country hav
ing absolutely no involvement in the con
flict, show that Saddam will stop at
nothing, even outside his own country, to
maintain the expansion of his absolute
rule.
In short, Saddam is an aggressive,

unprincipled dictator with the desire and
the means to consume as much of the
Middle East as he wishes.
A rebuttal to these arguments is that
the Middle East is not our concern, that
we should not involve ourselves in the
squabbles of countries halfway around
the globe, opting for an "Arab settle
ment" instead.
The fallacies here are two fold.
First, Saddam does not represent the
Arab world, as the rest of that world
(save for Jordan) has realized. The rest
of the Arab world has forces in Saudi
Arabia, prepared not only to stop the
Iraqi advance but also to push it back.
If, as some would claim, the leaders
who sent these forces do not truly repre
sent the Arabs as a people, the same
claim must apply tenfold to Saddam him
self. Unless it is said that he represents
the Iraqis as Mussolini represented the
Italians — eliminating all opposition by

force.
Second, we can no longer afford an
isolationist point of view in affairs of this
magnitude. We are a world of commu
nity, increasingly interdependent, forced
to cooperate in order to survive.
Environmental concerns are a prime
example of this, as Brazil's destruction
of "their" rain forests would suffocate
us, and everyone else, as well. In the
same way, if Saddam is allowed to carry
out his campaign for dominance in the
Middle East, he will control much of the
world's oil supply and will soon develop
nuclear capability.
With this control, he would be able to
force whomever he wishes into a choice
between yielding to his demands and
being either strangled or annihilated.
Some say increased oil prices would be
a sort of beneficial shock treatment, forc
ing industrial nations to convert to alter
native energy supplies. However, oil
prices of, say, $100 per barrel, or $500 if

necessary for Saddam, would destroy our
transportation networks and industries,
forcing vast unemployment and chaos.
We could not adapt quickly enough to
avoid this. (Consider, for example, the
number of houses heated by oil in the
winter.) I agree that we are dependent on
oil and that the present conflict should
be taken as a lesson to end that depen
dence, but not at the cost Saddam would
impose.
In short, Saddam's actions clearly
show him to be an unprincipled man of
aggression, not intending to further the
Iraqi people or the Arab people, but only
his own aggrandizement of power. After
nearly six months of economic sanctions
and attempts at negotiation, I do not
think anything but force will stop him,
and he must be stopped.
We cannot set a precedent of allowing
the takeover of a peaceful nation by an
aggressive one. We could not stop the
Soviet Union in Afghanistan, nor Hitler
in Poland, except by a bloody war borne
of waiting too long for non-violent means
to work.
We can, however, stop Saddam. Unless
we fulfill our responsibility as the
strongest, most free member of the
United Nations in opposing him, the
world will pay a terrible price for peace.
If I am drafted, then, I will go,
because I believe that some things are
worth fighting for, and stopping a man
like Saddam is among them.
