## Solomon's lead-off homer sparks Cardinal to 7-0 win 
### Tyson Vaughan Senior staff writer 
The weather was warm yester
day, and nowhere did it feel more
like spring than at Dia
mond. The Cardinal baseball team

continued its tradition of crushing
non-conference foes on its sunny
home field, shutting out Cal
State-Los Angeles 7-0.
Stanford's batsmen took no
time at all to produce offense, as
leadoff hitter Steve Solomon

homered in the first Cardinal at
bat of the game. It was the third
time he had belted one over the
wall in his last five at bats.
A few minutes later Ryan
Turner broke his hitting slump by
banging a double to right field and

bringing in Jeffrey Hammonds to
put the Cardinal up 2-0. Turner
notched another RBI in the third
inning when he singled home first
baseman David McCarty.
Coach Mark Marquess was glad
to see Turner hitting again. "That
was perhaps the most positive
thing about our hitting today —
Turner got some hits, some RBIs.
If we can get him going at the bat,
that will help us a lot."
Stanford got some help out of
the bottom of its lineup in the
fourth inning when second base
man Chris Kemper slammed a
triple to center field, scoring des
ignated hitter John Lynch. It was
the first triple of Kemper's colle
giate career. The second baseman
then scored Stanford's fifth run
on a sacrifice groundball to first
by Solomon.
Kemper continued his heroics
in the sixth inning, booming a hit
over the wall in left-center for his
first collegiate home run. The
sixth inning was Stanford's last
offensively productive one, as
McCarty blasted a low rocket over
the left-field fence.
The senior Kemper, who has
played in a reserve role for three
years, was low-key about his new
found offensive prowess. "It's
exciting to get my first career RBI
triple and home run and all that,
but that should be kept in per
spective. I'm much more pleased
with the fact that I'm just feeling
more comfortable at the plate in
general.
"It was a lot quicker to get into

the swing of things in the field. It
just took me a little longer to feel
comfortable at the plate."
"Kemper's been playing great,"
said Marquess. "Any offense he
gives us is a real plus, but he's
been playing great defense, and
that's our main concern."
Marquess was also satisfied
with the performance of his pitch
ers, Scott Weiss and Andrew Lor
raine. Weiss, Stanford's ace re
liever, made an unusual start and
pitched six innings, striking out
six and giving up seven hits. Lor
raine preserved the shutout, strik
ing out one and giving up only one
hit in three innings of relief duty.
"We needed to get some innings
for Weiss, so I'm pleased we could
give him six today," said Mar
quess. "He seems to be a pitcher
who does better the more he
plays, and he likes to pitch a lot, so
it was good to get him some
innings."
Marquess stressed that Weiss
will continue his primary role as
relief. He has apparently settled
on a starting rotation of John
Reid, Jamie Sepeda and Willie
Adams. However, in these early
season non-conference matchups,
Marquess is trying to get as much
experience for as many pitchers as
he can.
He will probably start Aaron
Dorlarque in today's game against
USF. But, he says he will also try
to give Lynch, Tim Moore and
Greg Mix some time*
The Cardinal will face the Dons
at Sunken Diamond at 2 p.m.

Shortstop Roger Burnett has earned a national reputation as one of the best defensive players at
that position in collegiate baseball. After spending the season with the U.S. National Team, he has
improved his hitting and currently stands at .390.
The weather was warm yester
day, and nowhere did it feel more
like spring than at Dia
mond. The Cardinal baseball team

continued its tradition of crushing
non-conference foes on its sunny
home field, shutting out Cal
State-Los Angeles 7-0.
Stanford's batsmen took no
time at all to produce offense, as
leadoff hitter Steve Solomon

homered in the first Cardinal at
bat of the game. It was the third
time he had belted one over the
wall in his last five at bats.
A few minutes later Ryan
Turner broke his hitting slump by
banging a double to right field and

bringing in Jeffrey Hammonds to
put the Cardinal up 2-0. Turner
notched another RBI in the third
inning when he singled home first
baseman David McCarty.
Coach Mark Marquess was glad
to see Turner hitting again. "That
was perhaps the most positive
thing about our hitting today —
Turner got some hits, some RBIs.
If we can get him going at the bat,
that will help us a lot."
Stanford got some help out of
the bottom of its lineup in the
fourth inning when second base
man Chris Kemper slammed a
triple to center field, scoring des
ignated hitter John Lynch. It was
the first triple of Kemper's colle
giate career. The second baseman
then scored Stanford's fifth run
on a sacrifice groundball to first
by Solomon.
Kemper continued his heroics
in the sixth inning, booming a hit
over the wall in left-center for his
first collegiate home run. The
sixth inning was Stanford's last
offensively productive one, as
McCarty blasted a low rocket over
the left-field fence.
The senior Kemper, who has
played in a reserve role for three
years, was low-key about his new
found offensive prowess. "It's
exciting to get my first career RBI
triple and home run and all that,
but that should be kept in per
spective. I'm much more pleased
with the fact that I'm just feeling
more comfortable at the plate in
general.
"It was a lot quicker to get into

the swing of things in the field. It
just took me a little longer to feel
comfortable at the plate."
"Kemper's been playing great,"
said Marquess. "Any offense he
gives us is a real plus, but he's
been playing great defense, and
that's our main concern."
Marquess was also satisfied
with the performance of his pitch
ers, Scott Weiss and Andrew Lor
raine. Weiss, Stanford's ace re
liever, made an unusual start and
pitched six innings, striking out
six and giving up seven hits. Lor
raine preserved the shutout, strik
ing out one and giving up only one
hit in three innings of relief duty.
"We needed to get some innings
for Weiss, so I'm pleased we could
give him six today," said Mar
quess. "He seems to be a pitcher
who does better the more he
plays, and he likes to pitch a lot, so
it was good to get him some
innings."
Marquess stressed that Weiss
will continue his primary role as
relief. He has apparently settled
on a starting rotation of John
Reid, Jamie Sepeda and Willie
Adams. However, in these early
season non-conference matchups,
Marquess is trying to get as much
experience for as many pitchers as
he can.
He will probably start Aaron
Dorlarque in today's game against
USF. But, he says he will also try
to give Lynch, Tim Moore and
Greg Mix some time*
The Cardinal will face the Dons
at Sunken Diamond at 2 p.m.
