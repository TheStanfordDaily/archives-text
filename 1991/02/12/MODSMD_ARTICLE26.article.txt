phy's Laws of Sports Travel":
"Chapter Six — Washington
Hoops Trip from the Deep, Dark
Depths of Hell"
Day One. San Francisco, 6 p.m. No
problem getting on the bus at Maples. No
problem on the ride to SFO. No problem
unloading the luggage and waiting to
check in at the desk. Hey, this is simple!
6:10 p.m. Team manager Jamaal
Brown asks me for my ticket. "Why?"
"Flight's been canceled."
Of course. Apparently SFO had been
shut down in the morning, which meant
the plane scheduled to take us to Spokane
never got in. Hey, no problem: There's a
later flight to Spokane, right?
Dream on. The fine folks at United
offer us a flight to Portland and then a
switch onto Alaska Airlines to Spokane.
Seems reasonable, so we check the
"Departure" monitor. . . and, while we
watch, the flight is changed from 6:40
p.m. to 9 p.m.
That's just swell, except it would put
us in Portland long after all the connect
ing flights were gone. After debating for
about a week, United gives us a choice:
Fly to Portland and spend the night in a
hotel; or stay at the Airport Hilton and
catch a direct flight tomorrow.
We stay. I hate Washington State
already.
7:40 p.m. The luggage is loaded on two
mini-vans for the trek to the Hilton. We
arrive, we stand around, we wonder if the
$10 vouchers we got for dinner will get us
two french fries or three.
9:15 p.m. After waiting 90 minutes to
check in, everyone takes their vouchers
and heads for the restaurant, where a
soup and salad costs $8.95. During din
ner, the intrepid student media members

Absolutely nothing goes
wrong. Of course, we
spend the entire day in the
hotel because we're get
ting scared, but still, abso
lutely nothing goes wrong.

ask the front desk if someone could please
fix their lock so they could actually get
into their room.
10:40 p.m. The student media head
back to their room.. . . and, needless to
say, the lock still doesn't open.
10:45 p.m. A security guard shows up
and rips the doorknob off, opening the
door. The amazingly-still-in-a-good-mood
students get ready for bed.
10:55 p.m. The hotel manager shows
up and says we have to move to another
room so the security guard can fix the
door. He's lucky we don't have a gun.
11:15 p.m. "Hey, Cheers is on at 11
o'clock here, too."
"That's because we're still at home,
dummy!"
Oh yeah.
Day Two. 6:30 a.m. Rise and shine.
Are we there yet?
7:00 a.m. The Breakfast Bar costs
$8.95, but at least United doesn't give us
any money to cover it. Back onto the
minivans and over to SFO.
9:00 a.m. After (surprise) a half-hour
delay, everyone is on the plane. As it takes
off, we've traveled exactly 20 miles in the
first 15 hours of the trip. At this rate,
we'll get to Pullman in March.
Pullman, Wash., 1:00 p.m. Some
thing's wrong: The flight to Spokane was
perfect, the bus was waiting for us and we
somehow didn't get lost on the 90-minute

trek to Pullman. Something's got to hap
pen.
7:00 p.m. Something happens. Appar
ently the Pac-10 couldn't get regular offi
cials for the game, so they hire three
bozos who — due to birth defects — have
their heads lodged in their rear ends.
The Cougars set screens that would
get them arrested in other states, Stan
ford's Mike Montgomery picks up a T ask
ing the refs, in effect, if they're naturally
stupid or if they have to work at it, and
the Cardinal falls, 74-68.
Moscow, Idaho, 11:15 p.m. The phone
system at the University Inn decides it
really doesn't want a certain Daily writer
to be able to send his story. Par for the
course.
Fortunately, he only wastes an hour
trying to get the damn thing to work,
holds up the paper and endears himself to
his way-too-tense editor. As he goes to
bed, the words of KZSU's esteemed Brian
Webber echo in his ears: "Remind me
never to leave my house again."
Day Three. Spokane, Wash., 11:45
a.m. Another smooth bus ride, which can
only mean trouble. A member of the
coaching staff walks up to Sports Infor
mation Director Bob "Nothing ever hap
pens on road trips" Vazquez and asks "Are
you readv for this?"
"What?"
"There are 23 people in our group. . .
and we're booked on a 19-seat plane."
For some reason, this really doesn't
surprise anyone. The solution is for 15
people to switch onto a Horizon flight,
while eight luckv souls get to try their
luck on United's spacious Jetstream. As
we walk toward the gate, we look outside
. . . and see a model airplane sitting on the
tarmac.
"Oh, man. . . ."
How small is this plane? Seat A is a
window seat and an aisle seat.
Jim Morgan, Lang Meyer and Paul
Garrett — three of the Cardinal's tallest

players — have to fold themselves in half
just to fit through the door. Asst. coach
Paul Rundell sits right next to the cockpit
and gets an extra pilot's headset during
the trip.
12:40 p.m. As we zoom on down the
runway, a crosswind catches the jumbo jet
and moves it ever so slightly sideways.
Morgan cracks a huge grin and puts his
hands over his face while everyone else
holds on to something.
Seattle, 1:40 p.m. We make it. Our lug
gage makes it.
Unfortunately, the other plane is
delayed a half-hour.
9:00 p.m. Fog rolls in. Not a good sign.
Day four. Absolutely nothing goes
wrong. Of course, we spend the
entire day in the hotel because
we're getting scared, but still, absolutely
nothing goes wrong.
Except the Stanford-Washington
women's hoops game, the baseball team's
second straight loss, the fact that it was
completely foggy all day . . no, no, we're
gonna be positive!
Absolutely nothing goes wrong.
Day five, 12 noon. Completely sunny.
Blue sky. Warm.
Something's up.
3:36 p.m. The bantering KZSU duo
jokes that if the rest of their trip turns
out anything like the first four days,
they'll be getting home on Wednesday.
It isn't funny.
5:15 p.m. The Cardinal holds off Wash

ington in a game neither team should
have won. Everyone's happy. A split on
the road in the Pac-10 is beautiful.
5:45 p.m. Asst. coach Steve Seandel
walks toward the press area. He looks
grim. He looks annoyed.
Guess.
"Airport's closed. Fog."
The blue sky all day should've tipped
us off.
The team leaves for the airport, where
United, yet again, will most likely tell
them to head for a hotel.
7:45 p.m. Vazquez and The Daily's
ever-optimistic writer get to the airport,
drop off their rented car, go inside to find
out which hotel the team went to . . . and
the team's still there! Alaska Airlines is
still running! An 8:30 flight to San Jose,
and everything's going to be fine.
At the desk, a clerk tries to check a cer
tain writer's bags to Oakland. Said writer
shows admirable restraint in not stran
gling him.
8:15 p.m. Still no plane at the gate
when an announcement comes. "Folks,
the plane left Boeing Field at 8:04, and
should be here by 8:30. No promises."
NBA teams play forty-one road games a
year?
8:35 p.m. The plane arrives. Fifty min
utes later we're on, we're taking off
through the fog . . . and we're headed
home. No one can believe it was so easy.
Day six. Stanford, 12:45 a.m. A quick
bus ride — No lost luggage! — a stop at
The Daily, and home. Where do I live
again?
9:59 a.m. History midterm. As an
extremely well-rested writer takes his
seat, a friend turns to him and asks the
obvious question: "So," she smiles, "how
was your weekend?"
He hits her.

Cameron Macky is The Daily's men's has
ketball writer — and, thus far, he's sur
vived. No promises.

11:15 p.m. "Hey, Cheers is on at 11
o'clock here, too."
"That's because we're still at home,
dummy!"
Oh yeah.
Day Two. 6:30 a.m. Rise and shine.
Are we there yet?
7:00 a.m. The Breakfast Bar costs
$8.95, but at least United doesn't give us
any money to cover it. Back onto the
minivans and over to SFO.
9:00 a.m. After (surprise) a half-hour
delay, everyone is on the plane. As it takes
off, we've traveled exactly 20 miles in the
first 15 hours of the trip. At this rate,
we'll get to Pullman in March.
Pullman, Wash., 1:00 p.m. Some
thing's wrong: The flight to Spokane was
perfect, the bus was waiting for us and we
somehow didn't get lost on the 90-minute

trek to Pullman. Something's got to hap
pen.
7:00 p.m. Something happens. Appar
ently the Pac-10 couldn't get regular offi
cials for the game, so they hire three
bozos who — due to birth defects — have
their heads lodged in their rear ends.
The Cougars set screens that would
get them arrested in other states, Stan
ford's Mike Montgomery picks up a T ask
ing the refs, in effect, if they're naturally
stupid or if they have to work at it, and
the Cardinal falls, 74-68.
Moscow, Idaho, 11:15 p.m. The phone
system at the University Inn decides it
really doesn't want a certain Daily writer
to be able to send his story. Par for the
course.
Fortunately, he only wastes an hour
trying to get the damn thing to work,
holds up the paper and endears himself to
his way-too-tense editor. As he goes to
bed, the words of KZSU's esteemed Brian
Webber echo in his ears: "Remind me
never to leave my house again."
Day Three. Spokane, Wash., 11:45
a.m. Another smooth bus ride, which can
only mean trouble. A member of the
coaching staff walks up to Sports Infor
mation Director Bob "Nothing ever hap
pens on road trips" Vazquez and asks "Are
you readv for this?"
"What?"
"There are 23 people in our group. . .
and we're booked on a 19-seat plane."
For some reason, this really doesn't
surprise anyone. The solution is for 15
people to switch onto a Horizon flight,
while eight luckv souls get to try their
luck on United's spacious Jetstream. As
we walk toward the gate, we look outside
. . . and see a model airplane sitting on the
tarmac.
"Oh, man. . . ."
How small is this plane? Seat A is a
window seat and an aisle seat.
Jim Morgan, Lang Meyer and Paul
Garrett — three of the Cardinal's tallest

players — have to fold themselves in half
just to fit through the door. Asst. coach
Paul Rundell sits right next to the cockpit
and gets an extra pilot's headset during
the trip.
12:40 p.m. As we zoom on down the
runway, a crosswind catches the jumbo jet
and moves it ever so slightly sideways.
Morgan cracks a huge grin and puts his
hands over his face while everyone else
holds on to something.
Seattle, 1:40 p.m. We make it. Our lug
gage makes it.
Unfortunately, the other plane is
delayed a half-hour.
9:00 p.m. Fog rolls in. Not a good sign.
Day four. Absolutely nothing goes
wrong. Of course, we spend the
entire day in the hotel because
we're getting scared, but still, absolutely
nothing goes wrong.
Except the Stanford-Washington
women's hoops game, the baseball team's
second straight loss, the fact that it was
completely foggy all day . . no, no, we're
gonna be positive!
Absolutely nothing goes wrong.
Day five, 12 noon. Completely sunny.
Blue sky. Warm.
Something's up.
3:36 p.m. The bantering KZSU duo
jokes that if the rest of their trip turns
out anything like the first four days,
they'll be getting home on Wednesday.
It isn't funny.
5:15 p.m. The Cardinal holds off Wash

ington in a game neither team should
have won. Everyone's happy. A split on
the road in the Pac-10 is beautiful.
5:45 p.m. Asst. coach Steve Seandel
walks toward the press area. He looks
grim. He looks annoyed.
Guess.
"Airport's closed. Fog."
The blue sky all day should've tipped
us off.
The team leaves for the airport, where
United, yet again, will most likely tell
them to head for a hotel.
7:45 p.m. Vazquez and The Daily's
ever-optimistic writer get to the airport,
drop off their rented car, go inside to find
out which hotel the team went to . . . and
the team's still there! Alaska Airlines is
still running! An 8:30 flight to San Jose,
and everything's going to be fine.
At the desk, a clerk tries to check a cer
tain writer's bags to Oakland. Said writer
shows admirable restraint in not stran
gling him.
8:15 p.m. Still no plane at the gate
when an announcement comes. "Folks,
the plane left Boeing Field at 8:04, and
should be here by 8:30. No promises."
NBA teams play forty-one road games a
year?
8:35 p.m. The plane arrives. Fifty min
utes later we're on, we're taking off
through the fog . . . and we're headed
home. No one can believe it was so easy.
Day six. Stanford, 12:45 a.m. A quick
bus ride — No lost luggage! — a stop at
The Daily, and home. Where do I live
again?
9:59 a.m. History midterm. As an
extremely well-rested writer takes his
seat, a friend turns to him and asks the
obvious question: "So," she smiles, "how
was your weekend?"
He hits her.

Cameron Macky is The Daily's men's has
ketball writer — and, thus far, he's sur
vived. No promises.

or "You Can't Get There from Here: Mur

"Chapter Six — Washington
Hoops Trip from the Deep, Dark
Depths of Hell"
Day One. San Francisco, 6 p.m. No
problem getting on the bus at Maples. No
problem on the ride to SFO. No problem
unloading the luggage and waiting to
check in at the desk. Hey, this is simple!
6:10 p.m. Team manager Jamaal
Brown asks me for my ticket. "Why?"
"Flight's been canceled."
Of course. Apparently SFO had been
shut down in the morning, which meant
the plane scheduled to take us to Spokane
never got in. Hey, no problem: There's a
later flight to Spokane, right?
Dream on. The fine folks at United
offer us a flight to Portland and then a
switch onto Alaska Airlines to Spokane.
Seems reasonable, so we check the
"Departure" monitor. . . and, while we
watch, the flight is changed from 6:40
p.m. to 9 p.m.
That's just swell, except it would put
us in Portland long after all the connect
ing flights were gone. After debating for
about a week, United gives us a choice:
Fly to Portland and spend the night in a
hotel; or stay at the Airport Hilton and
catch a direct flight tomorrow.
We stay. I hate Washington State
already.
7:40 p.m. The luggage is loaded on two
mini-vans for the trek to the Hilton. We
arrive, we stand around, we wonder if the
$10 vouchers we got for dinner will get us
two french fries or three.
9:15 p.m. After waiting 90 minutes to
check in, everyone takes their vouchers
and heads for the restaurant, where a
soup and salad costs $8.95. During din
ner, the intrepid student media members

Absolutely nothing goes
wrong. Of course, we
spend the entire day in the
hotel because we're get
ting scared, but still, abso

ask the front desk if someone could please
fix their lock so they could actually get
into their room.
10:40 p.m. The student media head
back to their room.. . . and, needless to
say, the lock still doesn't open.
10:45 p.m. A security guard shows up
and rips the doorknob off, opening the
door. The amazingly-still-in-a-good-mood
students get ready for bed.
10:55 p.m. The hotel manager shows
up and says we have to move to another
room so the security guard can fix the
door. He's lucky we don't have a gun.
11:15 p.m. "Hey, Cheers is on at 11
o'clock here, too."

"Oh, man. . . ."
How small is this plane? Seat A is a
window seat and an aisle seat.
Jim Morgan, Lang Meyer and Paul
Garrett — three of the Cardinal's tallest

players — have to fold themselves in half
just to fit through the door. Asst. coach
Paul Rundell sits right next to the cockpit
and gets an extra pilot's headset during
the trip.
12:40 p.m. As we zoom on down the
runway, a crosswind catches the jumbo jet
and moves it ever so slightly sideways.
Morgan cracks a huge grin and puts his
hands over his face while everyone else
holds on to something.
Seattle, 1:40 p.m. We make it. Our lug
gage makes it.
Unfortunately, the other plane is
delayed a half-hour.
9:00 p.m. Fog rolls in. Not a good sign.
Day four. Absolutely nothing goes
wrong. Of course, we spend the
entire day in the hotel because
we're getting scared, but still, absolutely
nothing goes wrong.
Except the Stanford-Washington
women's hoops game, the baseball team's
second straight loss, the fact that it was
completely foggy all day . . no, no, we're
gonna be positive!
Absolutely nothing goes wrong.
Day five, 12 noon. Completely sunny.
Blue sky. Warm.
Something's up.
3:36 p.m. The bantering KZSU duo
jokes that if the rest of their trip turns
out anything like the first four days,
they'll be getting home on Wednesday.
It isn't funny.
5:15 p.m. The Cardinal holds off Wash

ington in a game neither team should
have won. Everyone's happy. A split on
the road in the Pac-10 is beautiful.
5:45 p.m. Asst. coach Steve Seandel
walks toward the press area. He looks
grim. He looks annoyed.
Guess.
"Airport's closed. Fog."
The blue sky all day should've tipped
us off.
The team leaves for the airport, where
United, yet again, will most likely tell
them to head for a hotel.
7:45 p.m. Vazquez and The Daily's
ever-optimistic writer get to the airport,
drop off their rented car, go inside to find
out which hotel the team went to . . . and
the team's still there! Alaska Airlines is
still running! An 8:30 flight to San Jose,
and everything's going to be fine.
At the desk, a clerk tries to check a cer
tain writer's bags to Oakland. Said writer
shows admirable restraint in not stran
gling him.
8:15 p.m. Still no plane at the gate
when an announcement comes. "Folks,
the plane left Boeing Field at 8:04, and
should be here by 8:30. No promises."
NBA teams play forty-one road games a
year?
8:35 p.m. The plane arrives. Fifty min
utes later we're on, we're taking off
through the fog . . . and we're headed
home. No one can believe it was so easy.
Day six. Stanford, 12:45 a.m. A quick
bus ride — No lost luggage! — a stop at
The Daily, and home. Where do I live
again?
9:59 a.m. History midterm. As an
extremely well-rested writer takes his
seat, a friend turns to him and asks the
obvious question: "So," she smiles, "how
was your weekend?"
He hits her.

Cameron Macky is The Daily's men's has
ketball writer — and, thus far, he's sur
vived. No promises.
