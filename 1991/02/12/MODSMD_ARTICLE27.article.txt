### David Hyatt 
Stanford's women's softball
team, after losing its first three
games, has come back with a
winning streak of equal length.
The Cardinal beat the Santa
Clara Broncos twice yesterday,
evening its season record at 3-3
in the Cardinal's first year at
the varsity level.
In yesterday's opener, Stan
ford's defense turned in its best
effort of the young season.
Frosh pitcher Nicole Sanchez
gave up no earned runs, cruis
ing to a 4-2 victory. Junior
catcher Kim Petersen sparked
the Cardinal offense with a two-
RBI bases-loaded single.
The second game was
decided by a two-run rally in the
bottom of the seventh, capped
by a clutch RBI single by sopho
more outfielder Kenda Kill
patrick. Killpatrick had a
quirky afternoon at the plate,
appearing seven times in the
two games but only going 1-for
1, being constantly walked or
hit by a pitch. The Cardinal

teams.

entered the bottom of the last
inning down by one run, and
Killpatrick's sole hit ended the
game by putting the Cardinal
ahead.
Other key RBI hits in the
second game were delivered by
senior Tamara Sosnick and
sophomore Lauri Reffelt, who
hit the season's first homer, a
two-run shot. Reffelt also deliv
ered a seventh-inning sacrifice
fly to tie up the game before
Killpatrick's game winner.
Sanchez was also the win
ning pitcher in the second
game, coming in to relieve and
holding the Broncos without a

run for the last three innings.
Her record, with two wins yes
terday, is evened at 2-2. Sanchez
has not given up an earned run
in her last 17 innings of work.
The Cardinal has 38 more
games scheduled through April,
mostly against other Northern
California schools. The team
will also travel to Oregon, Ore
gon State and USC, where Stan
ford will test the waters of the
Pacific 10 Conference. A
matchup at nationally ranked
California has also been sched
uled. The Cardinal hopes to
gain enough experience this
year to be competitive against
other Pac-10 teams, possibly
joining the league as soon as
next year.
The team is led by senior co
captains Darsi Rueda and Flo
Hsu in the outfield, and senior
co-captain Nancy Tillapaugh
anchors the infield at shorstop.
Stanford now prepares for a
weekend tournament in Mon
terey. The team plays and prac
tices in the northwest corner of
Roble Field.
