# Comparing taste, smell, comfort
## Annual contest to rate condoms gets underway 
### Robin Mathison Staff writer 
Unlike men, all condoms are
not created equal. Starting
tomorrow, nearly 2,000 stu
dents will be able to test the
truth of this statement in Stan
ford's fifth annual condom rat
ing contest, held in conjunction
with National Condom Week.
Just in time for Valentine's
Day, the AIDS Education Pro
ject will distribute more than
13,000 free condoms in White
Plaza from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.
tomorrow through Friday. The
contest asks students to evalu
ate a packet of six or seven con
doms for appearance, taste,
smell, lubricant, sensitivity/
comfort, sense of security and
overall rating.
"Part of being comfortable
with condoms during sex is
being comfortable with con
doms before sex," said contest
organizer Chien-Wen Tseng, a
graduate student. "You can
play with condoms and com
pare them in a fun, non-techni
cal atmosphere."
Well-known condoms from
the United States will be com
peting with the most popular
brands from Japan and Swe
den in this year's contest. Each
packet contains a variety of
shapes and styles, including
colored, textured and con
toured condoms.

to "increase personal aware
ness of sexually transmitted
diseases and safer-sex prac

tices," Tseng said.
"We want to make it fun," said
freshman Rachel Maddow, a con
test coordinator. "We want people
to see the variety that is avail
able," she said, adding that Tro
jan condoms, one of the most pop
ular brands, are not the only
choice.
Maddow said people do not
have to have sex to participate in
the contest. In fact, she said,
organizers prefer people to test
the condoms by "just pulling
them out and looking at them."
The ballots suggest playful
methods of testing each condom,
such as stretching it over one's
fingers to check its sensitivity and
blowing it larger than one's head
to test for strength. The ballots
also include a detailed rating

sheet and instructions for using
condoms and lubricants correctly.
"It's much more descriptive
than just asking 'Does it fit?'"
Tseng said. She added that she
hopes that the fun aspects of the
contest will encourage people to
explore safer-sex options.
Tseng compared condoms to
safety belts and said, "For some
people [they take] a little getting
used to, while others don't feel
safe without them."
The number of condoms being
distributed has increased since
last year because of larger contri
butions from manufacturers. A
total of $950 of condoms was
donated, reducing the costs of the
contest to organizational
expenses. Special funding from
the ASSU Program Board pro
vided the additional $200 needed
to pay for long-distance phone
calls, ballots and fliers.
Alondra House, an all-fresh

man residence, volunteered to
publicize and to help organize the
contest as part of a community
service project.
In the past, contests have been
held on campuses nationwide
during National Condom. Week.
This year, however, only six uni
versities, including Stanford, are
participating. Because too few
manufacturers were willing to
commit to a national contest, the
six schools are conducting inde
pendent tests.
Last year's, winner, the
Japanese Crown SkinLess Skin
condom, will return to defend its
title. Trojan, whose product was
reported as having broke in 12
surveys last year, is not partici
pating this year.
To increase student awareness
about safer sex practices, the pro
ject is "wprking closely with other
educational efforts on campus,"
Maddow said.
