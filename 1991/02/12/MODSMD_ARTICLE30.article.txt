# Fraternity plans to offer alternative for Row house
## 
### Sarah Morisseau Staff writer 
At least one unhoused fra
ternity plans to make an offer
to the University to either
repair and move into or replace
one of the three houses
destroyed in the Earthquake of
1989.
But University officials say
they refuse to even consider
such an offer.
Instead of repairing the
damaged houses — Synergy,
Phi Psi and Delta Tau Delta —
or allowing fraternal organiza
tions to develop the land, the
University plans to build fac
ulty houses on those sites and
use the money from their sale
to build more undergraduate
student housing.
Fraternity members ex
pressed dismay at the Univer
sity's stance.
"You would think the
administration would want to
raise as much money for
undergraduate housing as pos
sible, especially in this time of
budget problems," said Keith
Rabois, vice president of the
Interfraternity Council.
"Their refusal to consider a
bid frorr a fraternity which can
easily outbid any faculty offer
by a very large amount is
absurd," he added.
But University officials are
sticking to their guns. "That
land is wanted for faculty hous
ing. It is not for sale," said act
ing Assoc. Dean of Student
Affairs Diana Conklin.
"There's no chance in the
world" fraternities will be
allowed to bid for the land, she

said.
"It is just not an option. It is
not even going to be consid
ered," Row Director Jack Chin
said.
"It doesn't make any sense
to me," said IFC President
Erik Jorgensen, a member of
the Sigma Chi fraternity. "I
can't* see why they'd want to
turn down free student hous
ing built without University
funds."
Fraternal Affairs Adviser
Michael Ramsey-Perez said the
University's commitment to
coeducational residences is a
large factor in this decision.
"The University prefers coedu
cational housing as an educa
tional tool. They see it as a bet
ter mix," he said.
Chin said, "The Board of
Trustees decided that Univer
sity resources will be put only
into housing that any student
can have access to through the
draw system. They decided
there will be no new houses for
subjectively selective groups."
Steve Lyons, president of
Alpha Epsilon Pi, an unhoused
fraternity, said, "I wish they
would be more receptive and be
willing to talk about it at least.
A lot of money could be gained
by opening up to fraternities."
Lyons said his fraternity's
national organization can
afford, and has offered, to con
struct a house for its members
at no cost to Stanford.
This would alleviate the
tight housing situation by
approximately 40 people,
Lyons said. Alpha Epsilon Pi
has asked several times to
become a housed fraternity.
