# Teahouse to reopen in spring
## 
### Art Marcum Staff writer 
The currently closed Teahouse
received a long-awaited, favorable
fortune cookie yesterday in the
form of a report saying the Uni
versity will allow it to re-open
spring quarter.
The report also specified the
steps the University will take to
resolve the health and safety
problems that forced its closure.
Stanford will pay the renovation
costs.
The Teahouse was shut down
during winter break after new
Wilbur Hall staff members discov
ered numerous health and safety
violations.
Manager of Student Housing
Operations Suzanne Tamiesie
said the Teahouse should be ready
to open by the beginning of spring
quarter after an estimated
$12,000 in repairs are completed.
The University will hire an out
side contractor to do the work and
will cover the cost with "major
repair funding" from Housing
Facilities Projects.
Students will assist in interior
decorating but will not have to
raise any funds or provide any
labor for the upgrade.
The news came as a welcome
surprise to Teahouse Manager
Don Chin, a senior. Before the
report's release Chin had esti
mated the cost of correcting the
infractions at $15,000 and said he
believed the Teahouse would
remain closed until next fall.
The bulk of the infractions are
fire-safety issues concerning haz
ardous extension cords and
flammable banners and curtains.
Health inspectors were also con
cerned with the cleanliness of the
cooking area and a lack of ade
quate ventilation.
According to yesterday's
report, the existing floor will need
to be replaced and a dry wall ceil
ing constructed. The electrical
system will need to be upgraded,
the flammable banners and cur
tains replaced and a new commer
cial refrigerator installed.
Despite these changes, Man
ager of Housing Facilities Projects
Marty Keller said that making the
Teahouse operational would not
be difficult because the Teahouse
will be reclassified as a snack bar,
not a commercial kitchen. The
regulations for a commercial
kitchen are more stringent than
those for a snack bar, he said.
The Teahouse was re-catego
rized as a snack bar "because of
[the purpose] it served and
because the regulatory agencies
looked on it benignly," Keller said.
An appreciative Chin said he
was surprised the University was
covering the cost."I thought that
because of the recent budget cuts
that we would have to do a lot of
fund raising. I'm impressed," he
said.
To account for the University's
generosity, Tamiesie pointed to
the importance of the Teahouse as
a part of the campus. She noted
the cultural importance of the
Teahouse, calling it "vital for the
entire Stanford community."
Both Tamiesie and Keller said
they expect to meet with Tea
house management this week and
to be ready to start work some
time next week.
