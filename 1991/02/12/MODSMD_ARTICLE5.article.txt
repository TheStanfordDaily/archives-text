# Allies intensify air war; Scud injures Israelis
## 
### 
DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) — Favored
by the desert sun, allied jets stepped up the air
war yesterday with hundreds more bombing
runs against Iraqi targets. The city of Basra,
nerve center of Iraq's defense, was believed all
but cut off.
Iraq fired two Scuds at Israel and launched
a missile at Saudi Arabia, causing injuries and
damage in both countries.
"We hated to come back, but we ran out of
bombs," an exuberant U.S. Air Force pilot told
reporters on his return from a bombing run.
As U.S. air commanders pressed this "bat
tlefield preparation phase," President Bush
met with his war advisers to consider ordering
American troops onto that battlefield — in a
decisive ground war for Kuwait.
Emerging from a White House meeting with
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and joint chiefs
chairman Gen. Colin Powell, both just back
from Saudi Arabia, the president said the air
war "will continue for a while."
As for a ground offensive, Bush said, "we're
not talking about dates."
In Baghdad, the government announced it
was reaching still deeper into the Iraqi popula
tion — into the schools — for teen-age soldiers
to help "destroy the enemies of God and
humanity."
Iraqi radio announced that 17-year-old male
students are being ordered to report to military
conscription offices. In January, the Baghdad
government lowered the age for mandatory
military service Iraq to 17 from 18 but
exempted 17-year-olds still in school.
Also yesterday, Iraq's religious affairs min
ister, Abdullah Fadel, said "thousands" of civil
ians have been killed or wounded in allied
bombings. It was the first time a senior Iraqi
official had spoken of such high civilian losses.
