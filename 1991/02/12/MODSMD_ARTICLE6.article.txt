# Officials: Raffle for free wedding may be against University policy
## 
### Matthew Werdegar 
A Valentine's Day raffle to raise money
for earthquake-damaged Memorial Church
may be against University fund-raising pol
icy or possibly illegal, according to the
Office of Development.
For the last week a campus religious
group, Catholic Community at Stanford,
has been selling $2 entry tickets for a raffle
with a grand prize of a free wedding at
Memorial Church valued at more than
$1,000.
But in a 1984 statement, the Office of

Development, the University department
responsible for all fund-raising activities,
announced a policy "prohibiting the use of
raffles, lotteries, or similar schemes at
Stanford." In addition, "Requests for per
mission to conduct a raffle or similar
scheme will be denied," the policy states.
Raffle organizers never consulted with
the Development Office about their fund
raising plans. According to Assoc. Director
of Planned Giving Fred Hartwick, the office
did not know of the existence of the raffle
until the end of last week, a few
days after it had begun.
The raffle may also violate the
California Criminal Code, under
which lotteries and raffles are
considered forms of gambling and
are therefore illegal. The only
exception to this law is the
California State Lottery, which
was authorized by a constitu
tional amendment.
However, "There are ways to
present the opportunity to win
prizes that are not illegal,"
Hartwick said. If the entry tickets
to the raffle are technically free
and any money given in exchange
for them is labeled a donation,
then the raffle is legal.
Dean of Memorial Church
Robert Gregg said he is not sure
what to do about the raffle given
the possibility that it violates
University policy and/or state law.
"If this is a major blunder we
will simply correct it," Gregg said.
Rev. Russell Roide, head of the
Catholic Community and a raffle

organizer, was out of town yester
day and could not be reached for
comment.
Raffle planners intend to meet
soon to discuss the situation. Stu
dent organizer Monica Gonzalez,
a junior, said the raffle winners
will be picked Thursday, Valen
tine's Day, as scheduled.
The proceeds of the drawing
were to have gone into an ongoing
University fund for the restora
tion of the church. But the Devel
opment Office is not sure whether
it will be able to accept the pro
ceeds of a fund-raising event con
trary to University policy and of
questionable legality, said office
Communication Director Eliza
beth Sloan.
Ned Lee, a games specialist
with the Santa Clara County Dis
trict Attorney's Office, defined a
raffle as any event where individ
uals purchase the opportunity to
win a prize of value and the win
ner is determined entirely by
chance.
For a raffle to be legal, individ
uals must be given tickets for free
if they do not want to make a
donation. Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer said, "If some

body says 'I want a ticket,' the
organizers must be willing to give
... one."
Although the wedding raffle
tickets do state that the $2 price is
a donation, it is unclear whether
individuals could receive tickets
for free upon request. Raffle orga
nizers said although they were
unaware of this technicality until
yesterday, no one has asked for a
free ticket.
Even if the raffle proves legal,
it is still contrary to University
fund-raising policies, Hartwick
said. The Development Office's
policy recognizes changes can be
made in raffles to make them
legal, but says "these modifica
tions are both disingenuous and
harmful to efficiency of the fund
raising effort itself."
Raffles and lotteries are com
mon fund-raising events at other
universities, Sloan said. "We have
many examples of other institu
tions using raffles. Because they
can be effective, some institutions
choose to look the other way," she
said. (
Lee said the district attorney s
office is required to take action
when it learns of an illegal raffle.
