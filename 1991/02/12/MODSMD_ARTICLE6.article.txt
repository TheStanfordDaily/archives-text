A Valentine's Day raffle to raise money
for earthquake-damaged Memorial Church
may be against University fund-raising pol
icy or possibly illegal, according to the
Office of Development.
For the last week a campus religious
group, Catholic Community at Stanford,
has been selling $2 entry tickets for a raffle
with a grand prize of a free wedding at
Memorial Church valued at more than
$1,000.
But in a 1984 statement, the Office of

Development, the University department
responsible for all fund-raising activities,
announced a policy "prohibiting the use of
raffles, lotteries, or similar schemes at
Stanford." In addition, "Requests for per
mission to conduct a raffle or similar
scheme will be denied," the policy states.
Raffle organizers never consulted with
the Development Office about their fund
raising plans. According to Assoc. Director
of Planned Giving Fred Hartwick, the office
did not know of the existence of the raffle
