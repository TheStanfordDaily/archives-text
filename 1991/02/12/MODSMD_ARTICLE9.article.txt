# Wanted: Craziness, energy, liking for drool
## Quest to name next Tree begins 
### Matt McNeil 
"Do you like men? Do you like
to be man-handled? Do you like
children's drool? Answer all these
questions using references to
Dublin."
In the words of Stanford Band
manager Jesse Dorogusker, a
junior, these questions are part of
what is clearly "no ordinary appli
cation." But this application is for
no ordinary position: the coveted
post known as the Stanford Tree.
The Band begins its search for
a new mascot each February. By
tradition, the outgoing Tree —
currently sophomore Todd David
— authors an application
designed to select the person with
just the right mix of craziness and
energy to represent Stanford dur
ing the coming year.
The applications are just the
beginning of the process, David
said. Once they have been culled
over by a select Band panel, a
handful of lucky applicants is
called to the Band Shak for a
"hellish interview" where the
prospective Trees are asked for
their reactions to a variety of
unlikely questions.
Costumes are encouraged —
last year David arrived as "a
Grateful Dead-going rabbi" — and
bribes for the Band, he noted, are
huge.
After several hours of intense
deliberation, the panel finally
chooses one of the interviewees,
and at midnight the entire Band
rallies around his or her home in
the traditional ceremony to crown

the new Tree.
Despite the tough application
process and an attack by UC-
Berkeley students at Big Game he
called a "lesson in self-defense,"
David said he was "really glad" he
decided to become what is likely
the most recognizable Stanford
symbol. The biggest reward for
his efforts, he said, was in the
faces of the little children who
tend to swarm the Tree at sport
ing events.
The Tree is named after El Palo
Alto, the large redwood for which
Palo Alto is named, but the Tree's
exact origin as the Stanford mas
cot has been lost somewhere in its
17-year history.
Although the last four trees
have been men, the position has
not traditionally been male. David
said he encourages female stu
dents to try out this year.
Applications to be this year's
Tree are available now in the
Office of Student Activities and
are due March 1. An informa
tional session will be held Feb. 21
at 4 p.m. in the Band Shak, and
interviews and final Tree selection
will occur March 6.
