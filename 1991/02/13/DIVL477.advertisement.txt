ive a gift of warmth during tlie 2nd Annual North Face
Coat Drive for the Homeless, February 13th-18th.
And get 25% off on any clothing purchase.
Surviving on the streets of our cities and towns gets harder every day.
Facing an unusually cold winter, a poorer economy, and a nation focused
on war, the homeless people in your town are less able to provide themselves
with the bare necessities of survival than ever before.
Which is where The North Face 2nd Annual Coat Drive comes in. Last
year, we were able to give 2,000 coats to homeless people all over the Bay Area.
This year, our employees have already donated 3(X) coats which will
be given to such groups as the Emergency Services Network of Alameda
County, the Urban Ministries of Palo Alto, and the San Francisco Coalition
on Homelessness.
Now it's time to make your own contribution. Bring your clean,
used coats to your nearest North Face retail store. Or to our Factory Outlets,
featuring discontinued items at outlet prices. Your donation is tax-deductible.
And you'll receive a coupon good for 25% off any clothing item
in either our Retail or Factory Outlet stores with your donation.
But please act now. Because The North Face Annual Coat Drive is not just
a nice thought, for some it's a matter of survival.
