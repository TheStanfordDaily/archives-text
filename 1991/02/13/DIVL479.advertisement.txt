Whether you strongly believe in GOD, or in the EVOLUTION THEORY,
or in nothing at all, there is something else you should know. It's
about the origin of life on earth. Life on earth was a deliberate
creation by an advanced race of people who scientifically engineered
the human race through a perfect mastery of DNA and who created
us in their image (GENESIS 1:26). These beings are referred to as
"ELOHIM" in the original HEBREW bible and this word does not mean
"God" but "those who came from the skv". If you're curious and
open-minded, come and find out what it's all about.
