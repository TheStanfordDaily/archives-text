# University's library calculations unacceptable, Navy says
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
The Navy has determined that the Univer
sity has been using flawed methodology to cal
culate the indirect costs of research associated
with Stanford's libraries, federal regulator
Paul Biddle said in an interview yesterday.
The decision is a substantial setback for the
University, which released a two-and-a-half
inch-thick report to the public last week to jus
tify the way Stanford charges the government
for library expenses.
A Navy negotiating team, which includes
Biddle, has given Stanford until April 1 to
come up with acceptable methodology, Biddle
said.
If the University is unable to do so, he said,
future calculations of Stanford's library costs
will have to be made with a "default" formula
provided by the government. The move would
cost the University more than $5 million of the
$12 million per year it bills the government for
library costs.
University officials declined to comment on
the government's decision. "We're not dis-

cussing matters that are
under negotiation," said
Larry Horton, associate vice
president for public affairs.
A congressional investiga
tor, however, called the Navy's
decision "a slap in the face" to
the University and said it is a
sign that the controversy over
indirect costs at Stanford is
far from over.

A long-awaited report released last Thurs
day by the Navy dismissed some of the most
serious allegations Biddle has made about
Stanford's indirect cost policies, including a
claim that past "coziness" with Navy officials
has allowed Stanford to collect $200 million
more in indirect cost recovery than it was enti
tled to in the last decade.
Many of the most substantial issues in the
controversy have yet to be resolved, including
disputes over how much Stanford will be able
to charge the government in the future.
In December the Navy sent in a special
negotiating team to address many of the con
cerns Biddle had raised about possible over

billing. One of the team's tasks is to evaluate
dozens of "memoranda of understanding" that
have been signed between Stanford and the
government during the last decade.
Biddle has contended that these agree
ments are far too generous to Stanford and
have allowed the University to inflate its indi
rect cost bills.
The agreement on library charges is one of
the thorniest issues in the entire controversy.
Biddle and federal auditors have faulted Stan
ford's studies of its library usage, arguing the
methodology used is not statistically sound.
Under federal rules, the University may
charge a portion of its library expenses to the
government because faculty members doing
federally sponsored work here use Stanford's
libraries.
In order to determine a fair percentage to
charge the government, universities may
either use the government's default methodol
ogy or conduct a "special study" to more pre
cisely measure their usage patterns.
Stanford has historically opted to use a spe-
