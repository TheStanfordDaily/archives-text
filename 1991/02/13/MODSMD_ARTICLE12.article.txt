Japanese reactor malfunctions
TOKYO (AP) — Japan's worst nuclear acci
dent was caused by an emergency pressure
release valve that failed to work properly when
technicians tried to shut down a reactor over
the weekend, the Energy Agency said yester
day.
Although the accident caused the largest
accidental radiation leak ever recorded in
Japan, it did not pose a threat to humans or to
the environment, added the officials, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
Anti-nuclear groups responded to Tues
day's disclosure by calling for similar reactors
to be shut down in Japan.
When the valve failed to work Saturday,
technicians had to use a water sprinkler to
reduce pressure in the reactor's primary cool
ing system after the leak was detected at the
500,000-kilowatt reactor at Mihama Nuclear
Power Plant in Fukui, western Japan, agency
officials said.
South California water
supply restricted further
LOS ANGELES (AP) — The Metropolitan
Water District board approved a rationing plan
yesterday that would cut water use by 20 per
cent for Southern California home and indus
trial consumers and 50 percent for farmers.
"We've gotten to the point that we are using
all of our Colorado River supply," said Carl
Boronkay, MWD general manger. "Our con
cern is that even in a normal rainfall we would
be right where we are today a few years from
now. There's nowhere to move."
The MWD supplies water to the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power and 26 other
utilities. The district, which gets its water
from the State Water Project, the Colorado
River and other sources, provides more than
half the water supply for 15 million Southern
Californians.
Manila will charge for bases
MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The Philippines
told the United States yesterday that it wants
more money to allow the Americans to use mil
itary bases here after their lease expires in
September.
Philippine negotiators made their proposal
one day after chief U.S. negotiator Richard
Armitage offered what U.S. officials called a
"reasonable" package for use of Clark Air
Base, the Subic Bay naval base and four
smaller installations.
