# Gangs linked to six student deaths

TACOMA, Wash. (AP) - A
reputed gang member has pleaded
innocent to shooting and wound
ing six Pacific Lutheran Univer
sity students at an off-campus
party.
Richard Augkhopinee, 20, who
listed addresses in Tacoma and
the Spanaway area, entered his
pleas Monday to six counts of
first-degree assault. He remained
in the Pierce County Jail in lieu of
$300,000 bail.
Superior Court Judge Karen
Seinfeld scheduled a pretrial hear
ing for Feb. 19.
"It appears from all indications
that our suspect does have some
gang affiliation," Pierce County
sheriff's spokesman Curt Benson
said.
Augkhopinee, who is not a uni
versity student, was convicted of
second-degree theft in October,
Benson said.
The shooting occurred late Fri
day night after about a dozen peo
ple were denied entry to a party at
a small house rented by three stu
dents across the street from the
campus. Several dozen people
were at the party.
The sheriffs deputy said the

intruders wore red, a color gener
ally signifying membership in the
Bloods.
Earlier reports indicated some
in the group may have known stu
dents at the party. But Benson
said investigators now believe the
intruders learned of the gathering
as word spread off-campus.
"It kind of spread like wildfire
... in all these little gathering
places," he said. "They heard that
it was taking place and they took
it upon themselves to invite them
selves."
More than half of the would-be
party crashers have been identi
fied and further charges based on
vandalism to cars in the area may
be filed, Benson said.
Investigators have yet to
recover the weapon used in the
shootings. Prosecutors told the
judge that Augkhopinee refused
to tell them where the gun could
be found.
Augkhopinee was arrested at a
Parkland clinic where he had gone
for treatment of a gunshot wound
to his hand. Officers believe he
accidentally shot himself when he
was allegedly shooting into the
crowd of party-goers.
