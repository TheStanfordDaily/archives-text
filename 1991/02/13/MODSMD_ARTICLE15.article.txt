# Tighter restrictions on Gulf media coverage

DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) -
The media and the military, never the
best of friends, are engaged in an esca
lating battle over the journalists'
rights to cover the war and the mili
tary's concerns over security.
In the past two weeks at least a
dozen reporters and photographers
have been detained by military person
nel after trying to gather stories out
side the official press pools, groups of
reporters traveling under military
escort.
These incidents range from the
whimsical to the terrifying.
In one case, an Associated Press

writer and photographer were held six
hours by a unit of the Ist Cavalry Divi
sion. They were given dinner, shown
flashes from B-52 air strikes from over
the horizon, and provided with other
glimpses of camp life that generated a
story.
In a grimmer incident, Wesley
Bocxe, a photographer on assignment
for Time magazine, was held for 30
hours by members of the Alabama
National Guard. At times during his
captivity, Bocxe was blindfolded and
interrogated.
"They were very, very scared sol
diers and they didn't recognize my

press credential," said the 30-year-old
New Yorker.
On Sunday, New York Times
reporter Chris Hedges was detained
for six hours and his credentials were
temporarily lifted after he tried to ask
officials at a military hospital for per
mission to conduct an interview.
"I was told I could lose my creden
tials, have my visa revoked and be
asked to leave the kingdom," he said.
His credentials were returned the next
day.
Hedges' case is more typical of inci
dents reported during the past week in
the areas of Khafji and Hafr al Batin,

where reporters, chafing under the
tight controls of the pool system, have
begun to venture out unescorted in
search of stories.
CBS newsman Bob Simon and three
crew members disappeared two weeks
ago while traveling unescorted near
the Kuwaiti border.
The Hedges case isn't likely to be
the last incident. With nearly 800 jour
nalists vying for a mere 126 spots on
the various press pools, many
reporters and photographers have
struck off on their own to find some
thing to photograph or write about.
