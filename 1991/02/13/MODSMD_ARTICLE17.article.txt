PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP)
— Mikhail S. Gorbachev has pro
posed the elimination of the War
saw Pact's military role by April,
the state CTK news agency
reported.
The Soviet president suggested
Warsaw Pact foreign and defense
ministers meet to take up the
issue later this month, the news
agency said Monday.
It said President Vaclav Havel
had accepted the suggestion, con
tained in a letter.
Hungarian Prime Minister
Jozsef An tall announced yester
day that the meeting to scrap the
alliance's military role would be
held in Budapest on Feb. 25.
Czechoslovakia and Hungary
— both invaded at one time by
Soviet-led pact forces to crush
reform movements — have for
months sought dissolution of the
pact's military structures by June
and abolition of the alliance by
early next year.
Poland, which led the 1989
democratic reform movement
that overturned four decades of
Communist rule throughout most
of Eastern Europe, also supports
dissolving the pact, which was ere

ated to counter NATO.
Romania and Bulgaria, the
other Warsaw Pact members, also
want to dissolve its military role.
CTK did not give a specific date
and place for the conference.
Hungary and Romania ack
nowledged receiving the proposal,
which was not reported Monday
by Soviet media.
Dissolving the 36-year-old
pact's military role would offi
cially end the era in which two
opposing military structures faced
each other across Europe.
Earlier Monday, Havel sug
gested Czechoslovakia cooperate
more closely with the NATO.
"The dramatic developments
in the Baltics, the Persian Gulf
War ... the whole present situation
strengthens the reasons for a
closer cooperation with NATO,"
Havel said. "Changes in the
Soviet Union are of great concern
to us. ... Instability in one part of
the world exudes instability else
where.
"We are in (the) direct neigh
borhood of this colossus, undergo
ing very dramatic changes," he
said.
