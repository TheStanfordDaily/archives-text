## Saying no to tobacco 
### 
University discourages
smoking; investments
have to be consistent

IN A RECENT LETTER, the
California state health director
requested that Stanford divest
all of its stock holdings in tobacco
companies. To maintain a socially
responsible investment policy, the
University's Board of Trustees
should honor this request.
Stanford's policy on divestment
is deliberately selective and cau
tious. Every company whose activ
ities cause "identifiable social
iiyury" is dealt with on a case-by
case basis.
Divestment is always the last
resort, following an exhaustive
attempt to persuade the offending
company to discontinue its socially
injurious actions.
Although the term "identifiable
social injury" is obviously open to
interpretation, the actions of
tobacco companies must surely be
included in any reasonable defini
tion. Such companies produce,
advertise and sell an addictive drug
that is responsible for 320,000
deaths each year.
While the decision of whether or
not to smoke lies with the individ
ual, the subsequent health care
costs are borne by all of society.
California's underfunded public
health care system could provide
better care for all of its patients if it
did not have to deal with thou
sands of tobacco-related illnesses
each year. And a person's individ
ual decision to smoke can also
affect non-smokers in more direct
ways, as recent studies on the haz
ards of secondary smoke have
shown.
Stanford has already recognized
these harmful effects. For example,
its residence policy bans smoking

in common areas and allows smok
ing in dorm rooms only if all room
mates agree.
It is true that even when a com
pany's "socially injurious activi
ties" are recognized, divestment is
a last resort for the University. But
since there is no way to dissuade a
tobacco company from producing
or selling its own product, Stanford
has no other alternative if it wishes
to maintain an ethical investment
policy.
Critics of divestment routinely
maintain that the primary func
tion of Stanford's investments is to
make money for the University,
and forced divestment interferes
with that function. Such critics are
only half correct.
Stanford's investment policy
must also have a social conscience,
and the University would be
remiss in its proclaimed role of an
"ethical investor" if it did not con
sider the social ramifications of its
investment strategy.
When Stanford divests from a
company in response to socially
injurious action, it sends a strong
message to both the offending com
pany and to the community as a
whole.
At any rate, economic argu
ments are hardly significant in this
specific case, since the University's
stock holdings in tobacco compa
nies represent less than one per
cent of its total endowment.
The Board of Trustees Advisory
Commission on Investment Re
sponsibility first began considering
this issue last fall. It is normal, and
justifiable, for the University to
take its time in making divestment
decisions.
But after all the necessary delib
eration is completed, the correct
policy choice should be clear.
If Stanford wishes to maintain a
consistent and socially responsible
investment policy, it must sell its
stock holdings in the tobacco
industry.
