Last Sunday night, junior Laura Dyer
toted her bed linen and a garbage bag
full of clothes up to freshman Chris
Finnila's room on the third floor of Bur
bank.
Dyer and Finnila are two of the 48
Burbank residents participating in a
week-long "coed by bed" experiment
designed to increase interaction between
residents and promote interest in the
dormitory's Gender Exploration Week
program this week.

The program is an expansion of an
experiment last year in which about 20
people on the third floor switched into
coed rooms. This time, Burbank resident
assistants randomly assigned interested
students to coed rooms. Burbank's 97
residents normally live on one coed and
two single-sex floors.
Living with a roommate of the oppo
site sex "sets the tone for people to go to
the programs" of the exploration week,
Dyer said.
She said she and her new roommate
had not talked about the implications of
living with someone of the other gender
before a program Monday night featur-

ing Psychiatry Prof. Herant
Katchadourian.
Katchadourian, who teaches a
popular course called Human Sex
uality, sparked discussion about
gender differences during his
workshop. About 60 residents
packed the dormitory's lounge.
Katchadourian asked how stu
dents could be sure they were act
ing normally in their new living
arrangements.
"In the midst of mid-terms,
you can't put on an appearance,"
answered junior Michelle Latvala.
She and her fellow resident assis
tants planned the week's events,
which include a viewing of the
film "When Harry Met Sally," fol
lowed by a discussion about rela
tionships and what people cherish
about being male or female.
Junior Valerie Paz Soldan said,
"It's a topic that's interesting to
people, and could last more than
one day." Burbank's RAs tried to
pick a week not too near the
beginning or end of the quarter, so
it would not interfere with other
programs such as a dorm ski trip
or Latin American V >- T eek in
March.
Ironically, Valentine's Day lies
in the week they picked for gender
exploration. Latvala said she
encouraged Burbank residents to
attend Mixed Company's "Love
Sucks" concert at Roble Hall
tomorrow night but discouraged
romantic dinners between the
new roommates. "We're trying to
say you can be friends. We don't
want this to be a romantic thing,"
Latvala said.

But Colin Flaherty, a fresh
man, said, "A lot of couples didn't
sign up. They decided to do their
own gender exploration!"
Sophomores Kyle Pickett and
Blake Ilstrup did not participate
because they felt they were too
busy. Both of them also lived in
Burbank last year, when the first
coed experiment took place. Pick
ett recalled how the idea to switch
rooms originated over casual din
ner conversation.
"In our parents' day coed
dorms were unthinkable. But I
bet you our kids are going to have
coed rooms," Pickett remembered
saying last year. The discussion
turned into whether or not people
could live platonically in the same
room.
"I was positive I could, and my
roommate was positive he could
not," Pickett said.
But he added one week is not
enough to prove whether people
of the opposite sex can live
together and remain "just
friends."
Sophomore Dina Hamdy dis
agreed.
"I think just in one day there's
stuff I wouldn't have noticed oth
erwise," she said, nodding toward
the cluttered mattress on the
other side of the room.
"You're staying in a different
room, but not living in a different
room," Pickett argued as he ges
tured to the stacks of tapes and
books that remained on the
shelves on Dina's roommate's side
of the room.
Because she knew she was only
moving out for a week, sophomore
Shirley Tsay did not take all her
belongings with her.
Tsay moved into a third floor
room with freshman Udaya Pat

naik. Together they negotiated
which of the lofted beds to take
and the details concerning the use
of the telephone, answering
machine and stereo.
Since Sunday night, when they
first moved in, Tsay and Patnaik
have found they have a lot in com
mon, from playing with their
alarms in the morning to shouting
"Enter!" when people knock on
the door.
"It's uncanny," Patnaik said.
The two talk about their
shared passion for nutty ho-hos.
But "we don't talk about chang
ing clothes all the time."
RAs brought up the topic of
changing clothes during a mini
orientation session Sunday after
noon. Most students take showers
in the bathrooms and change
there.
"I don't think anyone minds.
You could be a female for all I
know," junior Kate Deisseroth
told her male roommate.
Flaherty said he feels disori
ented when he wakes up and sees
a female in the room. But he said
he finds the experiment practical
because "you're going to be living
with girls all your life."
Another freshman said he
missed his old roommate. Some
residents decided not to partici
pate because they were uncom
fortable with the idea.
But overall, "people love it,"
Latvala said. It forces people to
interact more than usual and stirs
up routines, she added.
Latvala cautioned the novelty
might wear off if the experiment
continued for more than a week.
"A week is good because you
can get the experience and then go
on. A quarter is questionable,"
Flaherty said.
He has blue sheets; she has peach. He
uses one pillow; she has 14 color-coordi
nated ones piled around her bed.

ing Psychiatry Prof. Herant
Katchadourian.
Katchadourian, who teaches a
popular course called Human Sex
uality, sparked discussion about
gender differences during his
workshop. About 60 residents
packed the dormitory's lounge.
Katchadourian asked how stu
dents could be sure they were act
ing normally in their new living
arrangements.
"In the midst of mid-terms,
you can't put on an appearance,"
answered junior Michelle Latvala.
She and her fellow resident assis
tants planned the week's events,
which include a viewing of the
film "When Harry Met Sally," fol
lowed by a discussion about rela
tionships and what people cherish
about being male or female.
Junior Valerie Paz Soldan said,
"It's a topic that's interesting to
people, and could last more than
one day." Burbank's RAs tried to
pick a week not too near the
beginning or end of the quarter, so
it would not interfere with other
programs such as a dorm ski trip
or Latin American V >- T eek in
March.
Ironically, Valentine's Day lies
in the week they picked for gender
exploration. Latvala said she
encouraged Burbank residents to
attend Mixed Company's "Love
Sucks" concert at Roble Hall
tomorrow night but discouraged
romantic dinners between the
new roommates. "We're trying to
say you can be friends. We don't
want this to be a romantic thing,"
Latvala said.

But Colin Flaherty, a fresh
man, said, "A lot of couples didn't
sign up. They decided to do their
own gender exploration!"
Sophomores Kyle Pickett and
Blake Ilstrup did not participate
because they felt they were too
busy. Both of them also lived in
Burbank last year, when the first
coed experiment took place. Pick
ett recalled how the idea to switch
rooms originated over casual din
ner conversation.
"In our parents' day coed
dorms were unthinkable. But I
bet you our kids are going to have
coed rooms," Pickett remembered
saying last year. The discussion
turned into whether or not people
could live platonically in the same
room.
"I was positive I could, and my
roommate was positive he could
not," Pickett said.
But he added one week is not
enough to prove whether people
of the opposite sex can live
together and remain "just
friends."
Sophomore Dina Hamdy dis
agreed.
"I think just in one day there's
stuff I wouldn't have noticed oth
erwise," she said, nodding toward
the cluttered mattress on the
other side of the room.
"You're staying in a different
room, but not living in a different
room," Pickett argued as he ges
tured to the stacks of tapes and
books that remained on the
shelves on Dina's roommate's side
of the room.
Because she knew she was only
moving out for a week, sophomore
Shirley Tsay did not take all her
belongings with her.
Tsay moved into a third floor
room with freshman Udaya Pat

naik. Together they negotiated
which of the lofted beds to take
and the details concerning the use
of the telephone, answering
machine and stereo.
Since Sunday night, when they
first moved in, Tsay and Patnaik
have found they have a lot in com
mon, from playing with their
alarms in the morning to shouting
"Enter!" when people knock on
the door.
"It's uncanny," Patnaik said.
The two talk about their
shared passion for nutty ho-hos.
But "we don't talk about chang
ing clothes all the time."
RAs brought up the topic of
changing clothes during a mini
orientation session Sunday after
noon. Most students take showers
in the bathrooms and change
there.
"I don't think anyone minds.
You could be a female for all I
know," junior Kate Deisseroth
told her male roommate.
Flaherty said he feels disori
ented when he wakes up and sees
a female in the room. But he said
he finds the experiment practical
because "you're going to be living
with girls all your life."
Another freshman said he
missed his old roommate. Some
residents decided not to partici
pate because they were uncom
fortable with the idea.
But overall, "people love it,"
Latvala said. It forces people to
interact more than usual and stirs
up routines, she added.
Latvala cautioned the novelty
might wear off if the experiment
continued for more than a week.
"A week is good because you
can get the experience and then go
on. A quarter is questionable,"
Flaherty said.
He has blue sheets; she has peach. He
uses one pillow; she has 14 color-coordi
nated ones piled around her bed.
Last Sunday night, junior Laura Dyer
toted her bed linen and a garbage bag
full of clothes up to freshman Chris
Finnila's room on the third floor of Bur
bank.
Dyer and Finnila are two of the 48
Burbank residents participating in a
week-long "coed by bed" experiment
designed to increase interaction between
residents and promote interest in the
dormitory's Gender Exploration Week
program this week.

The program is an expansion of an
experiment last year in which about 20
people on the third floor switched into
coed rooms. This time, Burbank resident
assistants randomly assigned interested
students to coed rooms. Burbank's 97
residents normally live on one coed and
two single-sex floors.
Living with a roommate of the oppo
site sex "sets the tone for people to go to
the programs" of the exploration week,
Dyer said.
She said she and her new roommate
had not talked about the implications of
living with someone of the other gender
