Gulf war highlights urgent need for new energy policy

JUST HOW TIGHT OIL SUPPLIES
become in the wake of the Gulf war
will depend, in large measure, on
what the US. government does to
increase domestic energy production.
The continuing absence of a coherent
energy policy would mean increasing
dependence on oil from the Middle East,
which, in turn, means declining domes
tic drilling for oil and natural gas, delay
ing production plans, reducing payrolls
and put off development of alternative
energy sources.
A strong energy policy would mean
quite the opposite: If domestic energy
resources are tapped more, they could in
the long run hobble the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC),
substantially improve America's balance
of payments, and make the U.S. economy
more energy-independent.
The United States has needed an
energy strategy for 20 years, not just for
national security reasons, but also to
address issues connected with energy
production and consumption.
The essential energy problem is this:
American dependence on imported oil
has grown to slightly more than 50 per
cent of consumption. Domestic oil pro
duction, meanwhile, has hit a 17-year

low and is still falling.
Yet the Bush administration contin
ues to tout market forces as the only
solution, and Congress eschews legisla
tion because this would help special
interests.
This is hard to understand, consider
ing that petroleum accounts for 65 per
cent of the total energy used in the
United States and is a key ingredient in
more than 3,000 petrochemical products.
More than that, proposals by industry
to open up more areas to exploration are
getting stiff resistance from environmen
talists who claim that renewable energy
resources and conservation will provide
enough energy for economic growth in
the years ahead.
Greater conservation and energy effi
ciency are already helping to reduce
demand, but a swing to more efficient
appliances, light bulbs and motors can
not fuel economic growth for the long
term. Solar energy could take decades
more to develop, and large-scale hydro
electric development is occurring in parts
of Canada, not the United States.
Any national energy strategy must
enhance energy production from all
sources — particularly nuclear power.
Environmentalists are inconsistent

when they press for action to avert
greenhouse warming while remaining
adamantly opposed to nuclear power.
They need to rethink those attitudes.
True, the critical issue of high-level
nuclear waste is unresolved in this coun
try. But there is a worldwide consensus
that the waste can be safely stored in
underground geologic repositories.
Politics — not technology — are
delaying a decision over where the waste
storage site should be.
Furthermore, nuclear power is a
domestic energy source that is not sub
ject to the whims and tantrums of Mid
dle East despots like Saddam Hussein.
Here at home, nuclear plants are contin
uing to save 74,000 barrels of oil a day,
nearly one-third of what we are import
ing from the Middle East.
France and Japan have recognized the
importance of an aggressive energy pol
icy emphasizing the power of the atom.
They are the world leaders in the use of
economic power, an area in which they
have invested heavily since the oil crises
of the 19705.
In fact, before the 1973 oil embargo,
Japan had virtually no nuclear-power
capacity; today, it has 38 operating
nuclear facilities, which supply about

nine percent of its total energy. The
Japanese government has announced
plans to almost double that by the end of
the decade.
In the United States, the energy prob
lem is made more difficult by the fact
that our increasing dependency on Mid
dle East oil is compounded by the reality
that the demand for electrical energy is
quickly catching up with available sup
plies. Electricity reserve margins are
falling, and utilities have been turning to
imported oil increasingly as a stopgap
measure to meet growing demand.
President Bush has a dramatic oppor
tunity to turn the Gulf crisis to our long
term advantage.
The war has been such a strain on
U.S. resources that he can use its cost to
create the conditions of public acceptabil
ity under which this country can adopt a
two-pronged energy strategy of using
conservation and energy efficiency to
reduce demand, while promoting domes
tic energy production.
In energy, the overriding national
interest lies in taking whatever steps are
necessary to break our dependence on
foreign oil.
