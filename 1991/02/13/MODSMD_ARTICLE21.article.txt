# Postal rates cartoon was demeaning in its portrayal of workers
## 
### 
Once again, working people feel
maligned.
I am referring to The Daily's editorial
cartoon of Feb. 5, which parodied a dol
lar bill. It had the words, "The Postal
Rate of America" on it, with a picture of
a greedy looking pig and the caption
"Postal Unions" underneath the pig.

Why is it that working people and
their unions have to be portrayed by the
media as being greedy and subhuman? Is
there some sort of class elitism here?
The National Postal Mailhandlers
Union, which represents 50,000 workers
nationally, is made up of about 35 per
cent women and more than 40 percent
minorities. The postal service is one of
the few employers that gives genuine
preference to the handicapped; more
than 10 percent of the workers in the
Mailhandlers Union are disabled employ
ees who have productive jobs.
Furthermore, in the period of 1973-

1990, the cost of a stamp increased 212.5
percent (not including the most recent
increase), while the U.S. Consumer Price
Index went up 179.7 percent.
However, the wages for mailhandlers
during this same period increased only
175.7 percent.
Do these workers really deserve to be
caricatured as a greedy pig? I hope that
such symbolism won't be used to
degrade Stanford workers.
