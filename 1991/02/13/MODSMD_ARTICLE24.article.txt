## Timothy Leary and me 
### 
THE SKY IS A RICH SHADE of olive
green, almost dripping, as if
painted in water colors. The sun,
large and purple and gently throbbing,
seems to wobble for a moment as it
extends two ethereal arms to give you a
hug. A few minutes later, it flutters to
rest on a sea of molten gold, where giant
silver whales play in the waves. . . .
It's an appealing image, full of wonder
and hope and love. And a friend of mine in
high school, "Lyle," claimed to have expe
rienced it, after eating a brownie from the
wrong plate at a party one Saturday
night.
The story holds a strange fascination
for me, but the details are hazy since it
was told to me three years ago, and Lyle
wasn't really that close of a friend.
Actually, it had almost faded from my
memory completely, before Timothy
Leary came tripping into town last week,
carrying with him his dream of an LSD
counter-culture.
Leary, a Harvard professor, made his
name in the 1960s with a simple message
he is still tirelessly spreading today: Hal
lucinogenic drugs are a good thing and
should be used by all of us. He says that
they are harmless, they increase self
awareness, and they give us access to
valuable new planes of experience.
Leary was on campus under the aus
pices of something called the Bridge Con
ference, a two-day meeting of scholars
and laymen who share an interest in
"consciousness expansion."
Not surprisingly, a topic of dis
cussion was the hallucinatory waking
dreams of LSD, and the tamer, but less

erratic, joys of marijuana.
The thought of several hundred LSD
and transcendental meditation devotees
gathered under one roof was a little
daunting, so I didn't go to the conference.
But it did give me occasion to recall Lyle's
experience and think about Leary's mes
sage on a more personal level.
It was junior year of high school, and I
was at Yale University with 15 or 20 other
students for an academic conference.
Late one night, five or six of us sat scat
tered around one of our rooms at the
hotel, trading jokes and stories, getting
more personal as the hours went by.
Somehow the conversation turned to
drugs, and that's when Lyle told his story.
A few months earlier, Lyle told us, he'd
gone to a college party with a few friends.
He knew the people he came with, and a
few others, but the hosts and most of the
people milling around were strangers to
him.
In any case, it seemed like a normal
party, with beer and some food, so he was
a bit taken aback when he snarfed a
brownie and found himself floating in
Never-Never Land.
It was a startling experience, he told
us, and he desperately wanted to go
through it again.
Lyle wasn't an incredibly expressive
person, but the rapt, laconic monotone in
which he recounted his "journey" was
unnerving.
He rattled off the beautiful, majestic
images that had danced through his
sight. He told us how time had warped, a
few minutes seeming like hours. And he
spoke vaguely of the great secrets of the

universe at which he had been given a
peek.
Everything Timothy Leary always
promised, and more.
Lyle kept telling us that he missed the
fairy-tale landscape, that he wanted to go
back, that he wanted to try LSD again. He
was clearly obsessed, and I couldn't blame
him: It sounded incredible.
So why hadn't Lyle used LSD again?
He had no moral or ethical qualms with
drugs; all of us in the room knew where to
find them, so availability wasn't a prob
lem. And he scoffed at side effects.
After some prodding, Lyle finally told
us that he was afraid that the real world
might not be as exciting or colorful to him
the next time he came back from the
imaginary one, and that was a price he
just wasn't ready to pay.
And that's why I don't think Timothy
Leary's dream for an LSD culture will
ever be fulfilled, even if drugs eventually
become legally and socially accepted.
A yellow sun sinking into a blue sea
may be old news, but it's still pretty damn
beautiful to most of us, and for that, we
have the slightly archaic, but still popular,
brain and eyes to thank.
I don't know about you, but I'm not
quite ready to trade mine in yet.
