## Hormones and you: The
						biochemistry of sexuality 
### Julie Makinen Staff writer 
Tomorrow is Valentine's Day.
It has been said that the stereotypical
Stanford student has little to celebrate on
this particular holiday. However, even in this
climate of celibacy, minds accustomed to
solitary nights of study will turn from
research to romance.
So we thought we'd explain the what can
really happen in an atmosphere of hearts,
flowers and ...
Men and women share a biochemical
basis of sexuality with all others of their gen
der (personal levels of sexual activities
notwithstanding). The substances that com
prise these gender-specific common bonds
are produced by many different bodily sys
tems.
And their effects dictate a multitude of
physiological aspects, ranging from sex drive
to brain structure.
Underlying the fundamental differences
between males and females are hormones.
Though they operate from only a handful of
control sites, hormones have effects that
reach nearly every part of the body.
The hormones most closely associated
with sexuality are produced by the adrenal
cortices (located above the kidneys), the
pituitary gland (located in the brain) and the
hypothalamus (also located in the brain).
And, of course, there are the gonads —
the ovaries in females, the testes in males.
Androgens, produced by the gonads and
the adrenal cortices, are anabolic hormones
which promote tissue growth. In males, they
direct prenatal sexual differentiation and
guide sexual development during puberty.
They are also responsible for the develop
ment of some secondary sexual characteris
tics in females.
Estrogens and progestins are the primary
female sex hormones. Produced in the
ovaries, these hormones regulate menstrua
tion, direct female sexual maturation and
prepare the body for pregnancy. Males, how
ever, also produce small quantities of estro
gens.
Prolactin and oxytocin, also produced by
the anterior pituitary, regulate milk produc
tion in women. Recent investigations, how
ever, suggest that oxytocin may also play
another role in the body.
"Oxytocin, in addition to its actions asso
ciated with lactation, may also work in the
medial preoptic area of the brain to stimu
late sexual activity," said Dr. Julian David
son, professor of molecular and cellular
physiology at Stanford.
However, long before they stimulate sex
ual activity, sex hormones affect the develop
ment and differentiation of those parts of
the body and brain concerned with sexual

behavior.
The pres
ence of
testos-

terone early in life appears to
"stamp" an individual as male, leav
ing him immune to the effects of
female sex hormones. However, male
primates who do not receive ade
quate levels of testosterone as
infants can manifest female physio
logical responses to doses of estrogens
and progestins.

Although females do produce minute
amounts of testosterone, the levels are
low enough that estrogens and progestins
determine their sexual characteristics and
brain structure.
The presence of testosterone and other
androgens heightens the male sex drive;
insufficient levels of these hormones reduce
sexual interest and activity. Antiandrogenal
drugs such as cyproterone and medoxypro
gesterone interfere with normal sexual drive
so greatly that they are often used to treat
perpetrators of sex crimes.
Eunuchs, males castrated before puberty,
experience abnormally low levels of testos
terone and consequently exhibit little or no
sex drive.
Less is known about the female sex drive.
Current literature about the effect of pro
gestins and estrogens contains many contra
dictions. Researchers who examine the role
of androgens in female sexual desire have
found that removing the testosterone-pro
ducing adrenal glands reduces a woman's
level of sexual activity, while administering
testosterone increases her sexual desire and
the frequency of her sexual fantasies.
Nevertheless, "psychology is very much a
part of sex drive, perhaps the most impor
tant part," according to Dr. Herant
Katchadourian, professor of psychiatiy at
Stanford.
The brain is at the core of all human
function and experience, and sexuality is no
exception.
The lymbic system, which is buried deep
in the brain, is believed to be the control cen
ter of sexual behavior. Little is known about
its function, however, it is believed to regu
late instinctive behaviors such as eating,
fighting, fleeing and sex.
In animals, electric stimulation of the
lymbic system causes grooming, mounting
and penile erection. The experience of plea
sure and emotion may also be centered in
this region.
On the other hand, the temporal lobes of
the brain seem to suppress sexual activity
when functional. Brain cancer patients who
have had these lobes removed report
increases in autoerotic, heterosexual and
homosexual activity.
Neurotransmitters, chemicals which
convey messages between nerve cells or
from nerve to muscle cells, are only begin
ning to be investigated as contributors to
sexual behavior.

Acetylcholine and other
neurotransmitters are known to
cause dilation of artery walls and
to allow for vasocongestion, the
filling of blood vessels and tissues
with blood. Vasocongestion caus
es well-known sexual responses
such as erection and swelling of
the breasts.
Visual cues — for example,
the sight of a sexually attractive
person — activate a pair of trans
mitters called norepinephrine and
dopamine, which generate sensa
tions of pleasure and desire.

Neuropeptides give new
meaning to the term, "chemistry of
love." Produced in the brain, in the
immune system and in other organs,

these proteins may be the link between
emotions and the body.

Neuropeptides can be released simply by
a thought. Thinking about that "special

some
one" sig-

nals nerve
endings to re
lease neuropep-

tides, thereby
creating sensations of

desire and such physical responses as
increased heart rate, appetite (for food) and
body temperature.
Neuropeptides are very potent chemicals.
One, known as dynorphin, is 200 times
stronger than morphine. Several neuropep
tides have been classified as opiates. Because
they are associated with the immune sys
tem, neuropeptides may translate happy
thoughts into healthy bodies.
Pheromones, natural perfumes that
attract potential mates, are present in many
animals; however, the question of whether
they are present in humans remains.
While no one has established a causal
relationship between bodily scent and sexu
al activity in humans, it has been demon
strated that women frequently exposed to
male body scents are more fertile and have
highly regular periods. A mixture of alcohol
and male underarm secretion applied to a
woman's upper lip is effective in regulating
menstruation.
Perfumes and other cosmetic scents
may be thought of as "socially determined
pheromones." Social conceptions of attrac
tiveness often have real consequences in
terms of behavior. A person who finds
musk oil or flowery scents sexy is likely to
be attracted to someone wearing those
scents.
Nonetheless, due to humans' limited
sense of smell, scent in general probably
plays a relatively minor role in human sexu
al behavior. If human pheromones do indeed
exist, they are only one small factor in a con
cert of cues which make others attractive to
us.
"Vision and touch are the predominant
senses involved with attraction, with
pheromones playing a minor role if any,"
Katchadourian explained.
Given such extensive background infor
mation about the biochemistry of sexuality,
one ma3 r wonder about some of the conse
quences of sexual arousal. While arousal has
many obvious direct consequences, it has a
number of interesting concomitant effects
as well.
Sexual excitement may temporarily alle
viate stuttering and hay fever, as well as
dampen pain and reduce bleeding from cuts.
On the other hand, the after-effects of sexu
al arousal may include hunger, thirst, a crav
ing for tobacco or — surprisingly enough —
headaches, which occur due to the increased
blood pressure in the brain that accompa
nies excitation.
"Arousal is like turning on the lights in
the bedroom," Katchadourian explains.
"Suddenly, unexpectedly, the porch light
goes on, the kitchen light goes on, and
pretty soon the whole house is lit up, and
you didn't even mean for it to happen.
Arousal has many effects beyond the sex
organs.
"The difference between what is sexual
and what isn't is not a clear-cut line."
Undoubtedly, this Valentine's Day, many
Stanford students will sympathize.
