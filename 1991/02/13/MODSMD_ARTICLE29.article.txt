# New cancer therapy kills resistant cells

A new combination of existing
therapies destroys cells found in
cancerous growths that make up
about 90 percent of all cancers,
according to Dr. J. Martin Brown,
director of the Stanford Cancer
Biology Research Laboratory.
These growths, called solid
tumors, have until now proven
strongly resistant to standard
methods of treatment.
Solid tumors are comprised of
two kinds of cells: aerobic and
hypoxic. Aerobic cells are those
that need oxygen to survive; these
are the ones that respond to radi
ation. Hypoxic cells, on the other
hand, do not need oxygen to sur
vive and do not respond apprecia
bly to traditional radiotherapy.
Brown and fellow researchers,
however, have discovered that a
specific anti-cancer drug, SR
4233, effectively attacks tumors
containing the hard-to-kill
hypoxic cells, when used in con
junction with topical radiother
apy.
While traditional radiation
therapy attacks the aerobic cancer
cells, SR 4233 kills the hypoxic
cells directly.
In addition, Brown's group has
found that as hypoxic cells die, the
tumor constantly transforms an
equal number of aerobic cells into
new hypoxic cells. The drug then
eliminates theses newly converted
cells.

Thus, the combination of
radiotherapy against the aerobic
cells and the drug's assault on
hypoxic cells makes SR 4233 a
very powerful cancer killer.
"It turns out that hypoxia
becomes an advantage rather
than a disadvantage in a tumor,"
says Brown. "You could say the
hypoxic cells are the Achilles'
heels of the tumor.
Ironically, medical researchers
have historically tried to treat
cancer by converting hypoxic cells
into aerobic cells.
Brown predicts that
researchers will now begin to
examine conversion in the other
direction: the transformation of
aerobic cells into hypoxic ones.
This process would involve
restricting blood flow to tumors
by constricting the blood vessels
that carry oxygen to the tumor.
However, while such proce
dures are known to be effective in
mice, they have never been tested
in human beings.
If all goes well, and SR 4233
receives approval from the Food
and Drug Administration, clinical
trials on humans should start
later this year. The testing is
scheduled to begin at Stanford,
Harvard and Cambridge Medical
Centers.
Because of the complexity of
the treatment, clinical trials will
last approximately three to four
years, unless experimental results
differ greatly from what is
expected.
