# House subcommittee to hold hearing March 15
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
A House subcommittee
hearing on Stanford's indirect
cost policies has been scheduled
for Friday, March 15, a con
gressional aide said yesterday.
Congressional investigators
have speculated for several
weeks that Stanford would face
a hearing before the Subcom
mittee on Oversight and Inves
tigations, but yesterday was
the first time a hearing date
had been firmly identified.

During the last several
weeks, subcommittee staffers
have disclosed to the press that
Stanford included the deprecia
tion on a yacht and other
embarrassing items in its indi
rect cost recovery claims.
Chaired by Rep. John Din
gell, D-Mich., the subcommit
tee is perhaps best known for
its disclosures in 1985 that the
Pentagon had paid $640 for a
toilet seat and that General
Dynamics had billed the Pen
tagon for country club dues and
dog kennel boarding.
