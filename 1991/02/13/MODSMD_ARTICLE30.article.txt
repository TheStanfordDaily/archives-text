Q m What exactly happens to
'.paper that is recycled, and
how much paper needs to be recy
cled to save a tree?
A # Although many articles have
I been written on how to recy
cle, none has been bold enough to
explain just what happens to the
paper.
Some current theories assert
that recyclers hire UC-Berkeley
students to "White-Out" every
sheet; others hypothesize subnu
clear bleaching of the paper at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter.
However, non-"National En
quirer" answers were provided by
Barb Voss, the manager of Stan
ford's Recycling Center, and by
Bob Schaeffer, a spokesman for
Conservatree Paper Company.
Paper comes in many grades,
based primarily on fiber length,
ink content and color. Grades are
sorted by hand at the recycling
center and then sold to paper
mills. Computer and white paper
(which contain the longest fibers)
fetch about $110 and $70 per ton,
respectively. Comparatively, a ton
of newsprint and junk mail, which
have shorter fibers and a higher
ink content, is worth only about
$10.
The paper mills remove the ink
using a combination of mechani

cal and chemical means. This pro
cess also separates the paper into
a thick soup of pulpy fibers. Fibers
long enough to be used are col
lected by passing the "soup"
through a screen as fine as panty
hose. The pulp can then be made
directly into paper â€” if it's white
enough.
Otherwise, it is bleached,
either by organochlorides (which
produce toxic substances known
as dioxins) or with various oxide
bleaching agents (more economi
cal and less hazardous). The pulp
is then pressed and dried into
paper.
Producing paper directly from
trees involves the same processes,
