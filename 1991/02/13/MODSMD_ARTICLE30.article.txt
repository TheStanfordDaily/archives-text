Q m What exactly happens to
'.paper that is recycled, and
how much paper needs to be recy
cled to save a tree?
A # Although many articles have
I been written on how to recy
cle, none has been bold enough to
explain just what happens to the
paper.
Some current theories assert
that recyclers hire UC-Berkeley
students to "White-Out" every
sheet; others hypothesize subnu
clear bleaching of the paper at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter.
However, non-"National En
quirer" answers were provided by
Barb Voss, the manager of Stan
ford's Recycling Center, and by
Bob Schaeffer, a spokesman for
Conservatree Paper Company.
Paper comes in many grades,
based primarily on fiber length,
ink content and color. Grades are
sorted by hand at the recycling
center and then sold to paper
mills. Computer and white paper
(which contain the longest fibers)
fetch about $110 and $70 per ton,
respectively. Comparatively, a ton
of newsprint and junk mail, which
have shorter fibers and a higher
ink content, is worth only about
$10.
The paper mills remove the ink
using a combination of mechani

cal and chemical means. This pro
cess also separates the paper into
a thick soup of pulpy fibers. Fibers
long enough to be used are col
lected by passing the "soup"
through a screen as fine as panty
hose. The pulp can then be made
directly into paper — if it's white
enough.
Otherwise, it is bleached,
either by organochlorides (which
produce toxic substances known
as dioxins) or with various oxide
bleaching agents (more economi
cal and less hazardous). The pulp
is then pressed and dried into
paper.
Producing paper directly from
trees involves the same processes,

but has an extra step at the begin
ning. The woody part of trees is
rich in a complex chemical com
pound known as lignin. The lignin
must be removed before paper is
made, unless you want people to
write on sheets of plywood.
This de-lignification process
uses large amounts of nasty chem
icals that are rather useful for
destroying ecosystems. When
paper is recycled, the amount of
bleaching is reduced by about 50
percent, and the entire de-lignifi
cation process is avoided.
However, even if every scrap of
paper were recycled, there would
still be a need for virgin pulp.
There is roughly a 3 to 6 per
cent loss when white paper is recy
cled, and a 10 to 20 percent loss
for newsprint and junk mail. So,
an 8 -by-11 inch sheet of paper
comes back only 10 inches long,
and the Wednesday Daily returns
without the Sports page. (But
never without the all-important
Science Bugs.)
Since one ton of recycled paper
saves about 17 pulp trees, about
50c worth of recycled newsprint
will save a tree. In other words, a
person's weight in recycled paper
will save a tree.
Or, to look at it from yet
another perspective, roughly
11,000 sheets of paper (eight final
exams) equals one tree saved.
However, the best way to save
trees is to reduce demand for
paper products. Remember this
statistic the next time some runt
comes to your door selling news
paper subscriptions: About 75,000
trees would be saved if all the
copies of just one Sunday edition
of The New York Times were recy
cled.

low voltage (size A) and high volt

graph systems. Let's hope none of
the aforementioned items comes
back on the market.
