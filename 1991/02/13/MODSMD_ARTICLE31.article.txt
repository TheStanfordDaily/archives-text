# Peaks in solar activity imply tilted rotation of solar core
## 
### Chris Patil Editorial staff 
While it may be true that nothing is new
under the sun, a new theory of what hap
pens inside the sun may force astrophysi
cists to reconsider conventional concepts of
solar history.
A section of the sun's core rotates around
an axis that is perpendicular to the main
solar axis, according to Applied Physics Pro
fessor Peter Sturrock and Dr. Taeil Bai of the
Center for Space Science and Astrophysics.
By examining measurements of total
sunspot area compiled over the last century
(from observatories in England and Switzer
land), the researchers discovered that peaks
in solar activity recur with a period of about
25.8 days.
"In the Zurich data, what we found pri
marily was what we call the 'fundamental
period' of 25.8 days," Sturrock said. "In the
Greenwich data, what shows up more clear
ly is the harmonic of one-half of that period
— 12.9 days."
Astrophysicists have known since 1984
that sunspot activity peaks every 155 days,
but Bai also found maxima that recurred
every 51, 78, 103 and 130 days. Further
more, he observed that these periods are all
rough integral multiples of 25.8.
"This suggests to us that there is a clock
inside the sun with that period," Sturrock
explained. "The question then is, 'What
could that clock be?' The most obvious possi
bility is [that] part of the sun rotates with
that period."
To determine the orientation of the hid
den rotator, Bai and Sturrock took advan
tage of the fact that their data were gathered
from Earth.
"Suppose something is rotating on the
surface of the sun," Bai elaborated. "If you
pick a spot on the sun that is rotating in the
same direction as Earth, it looks like it's
moving slower," and Earthbound astron
omers will observe a corresponding decrease
in the frequency of rotation. "If it [the spot]
is moving in the opposite direction, it looks
like it's moving faster,"
There are thus three frequencies of oscil
lation observable from Earth:
• the 'fundamental' or unshifted frequen
cy;
• the 'low band,' slower than the funda
mental due to rotation in the same direction,
or 'sense,' as Earth's; and
• the 'high band' frequency of rotation in
a sense opposite to Earth's.
For any given rotator, the relative intensi

ties of the three bands provide information
about the orientation of the axis.
"If the tilt of the axis is very small, we
would mainly see the lower frequency,
because we would be mainly following [the
oscillator]," said Bai. "If it's tipped almost
180 degrees, then you'll see the higher band,
and that's all. But suppose it's tipped about
90 degrees; then both side bands will be of
equal strength."
The latter case is just what Sturrock and
Bai observed: The side bands are of approxi
mately equal intensity, indicating that the
solar core is spinning around an axis that
makes a roughly square angle with the axis
of the surface.
Further consideration of the core's
nature led the two scientists to one of the
most intriguing implications of their discov
ery — the possibility that the solar system
developed in two distinct phases.
"The current idea of solar system forma
tion is that there was a so-called 'solar nebu
la,'" a cloud of interstellar hydrogen with a
uniform angular momentum, Bai explained.
Some sections of the nebula were denser
than others, and the gravitational attraction
of these regions initiated the accretion of dis
tinct clumps of matter that later became the
sun and planets.
However, Sturrock and Bai's analysis of
the data directly contradicts descriptions that
rely on a uniformly rotating cloud of matter.
"When we say the core is rotating in a dif
ferent direction, that means maybe the core
was formed earlier," Bai said. "Perhaps there
was a white dwarf that became the 'seed' of
the attraction of this nebula material."
White dwarves are stars that have so little
hydrogen fuel that they collapse under their
own weight, shrinking to a size roughly the
same as Earth's.
Sturrock and Bai discuss the theoretical
status of their conclusions with a guarded
optimism.
"We feel we have good reason to make the
suggestion, but we don't feel that we're in a
position to prove that such is the case," Stur
rock cautioned.
Nonetheless, the theory is valuable at
present due to its explanatory power.
"It's odd," Bai admitted. "No one expect
ed to see this 155-day periodicity. It came as
a surprise; then we found there are other
periods. With this conjecture we can explain
eight periodicities.
"So it's a kind of Ockham's Razor," he
concluded. "If you have one conjecture that
explains lots of things, then that's a very
attractive theory."

mental due to rotation in the same direction,
or 'sense,' as Earth's; and
• the 'high band' frequency of rotation in
a sense opposite to Earth's.
For any given rotator, the relative intensi

ties of the three bands provide information
about the orientation of the axis.
"If the tilt of the axis is very small, we
would mainly see the lower frequency,
because we would be mainly following [the
oscillator]," said Bai. "If it's tipped almost
180 degrees, then you'll see the higher band,
and that's all. But suppose it's tipped about
90 degrees; then both side bands will be of
equal strength."
The latter case is just what Sturrock and
Bai observed: The side bands are of approxi
mately equal intensity, indicating that the
solar core is spinning around an axis that
makes a roughly square angle with the axis
of the surface.
Further consideration of the core's
nature led the two scientists to one of the
most intriguing implications of their discov
ery — the possibility that the solar system
developed in two distinct phases.
"The current idea of solar system forma
tion is that there was a so-called 'solar nebu
la,'" a cloud of interstellar hydrogen with a
uniform angular momentum, Bai explained.
Some sections of the nebula were denser
than others, and the gravitational attraction
of these regions initiated the accretion of dis
tinct clumps of matter that later became the
sun and planets.
However, Sturrock and Bai's analysis of
the data directly contradicts descriptions that
rely on a uniformly rotating cloud of matter.
"When we say the core is rotating in a dif
ferent direction, that means maybe the core
was formed earlier," Bai said. "Perhaps there
was a white dwarf that became the 'seed' of
the attraction of this nebula material."
White dwarves are stars that have so little
hydrogen fuel that they collapse under their
own weight, shrinking to a size roughly the
same as Earth's.
Sturrock and Bai discuss the theoretical
status of their conclusions with a guarded
optimism.
"We feel we have good reason to make the
suggestion, but we don't feel that we're in a
position to prove that such is the case," Stur
rock cautioned.
Nonetheless, the theory is valuable at
present due to its explanatory power.
"It's odd," Bai admitted. "No one expect
ed to see this 155-day periodicity. It came as
a surprise; then we found there are other
periods. With this conjecture we can explain
eight periodicities.
"So it's a kind of Ockham's Razor," he
concluded. "If you have one conjecture that
explains lots of things, then that's a very
attractive theory."
