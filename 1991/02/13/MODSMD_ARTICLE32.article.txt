## Hammonds hits his fifth, Cardinal beats Dons 10-0 
### Michelle Ghert Staff writer 
The Stnford baseball team
posted its fourth shutout of the
1991 season as it extinguished the
University of San Francisco Dons
10-0 yesterday at Sunken Dia
mond.
The shutout was Stanford's
second straight, and the win

improved the Cardinal record to
10-2 on the year as the Dons sunk
to 2-5.
Starting pitcher Tim Moore
earned his first win of the season
and together with relief pitchers
Aaron Dorlarque and John Lynch,
limited the Dons to only three
hits.
Eight of nine Stanford starters
hit safely at least once while all 10

runs were earned before the sixth
inning. The Dons, running into
pitching trouble, substituted four
times onto the mound while the
substantial lead allowed the Car
dinal to play 22 members of the
squad.
"It's great when you have an
opportunity in a game like this,"
head coach Mark Marquess said.
"When you have a good lead and

Baseball

can get as many players in as pos
sible. They put a lot of work in but
don't get a lot of playing time."
Center fielder Jeffrey Ham
monds agrees.
"Everybody goes out and works
hard every day," Hammonds said.
"It feels good when the starting
nine go out there and decide the
game early, giving the other guys a
chance to play."
Hammonds contributed to the
impressive Cardinal offense with
three hits in four at-bats, includ
ing a solo home run in the second
inning to start off the scoring for
Stanford. Hammonds' homer was
his fifth of the season and twelth
of his college career.
"I went out there today to try
and get things done," Hammonds
said. "Fortunately I had a little bit
of Lady Luck. It's good to go home
for a few days vacation knowing
that I left the ballpark with a good
feeling."
If Lady Luck was at Sunken
Diamond yesterday, she was espe
cially generous to the Cardinal in
the fourth and fifth innings. Stan
ford scored nine runs in those two
innings alone, posting a total of 14
hits throughout the game.
Don starter Auggie Acuna
lasted until the fourth inning,
when he gave up an RBI single to
right fielder Steve Solomon and
then threw a wild pitch that
scored Stanford's second baseman
Chris Kemper and Solomon.
Hammonds then made it 5-0
Stanford when his RBI single
scored shortstop Roger Burnett,
aboard on a walk.
Subsequently, the Dons made
their first of four pitching subsitu

tions, replacing Acuna with fifth
year senior Dave Laßosa.
The Cardinal bats could not be
silenced, however. Laßosa only
lasted one inning as Stanford
added five more runs in the fifth
inning to bring the Cardinal tally
to 10 runs. Kemper singled to
score catcher Mark Skeels and
third baseman David Holbrook.
Burnett doubled and first base
man David McCarty earned his
season's fifth home run with a
420-foot drill over (way over) the
left field fence.
Hammonds then singled to
right field to get on base with his
third safe hit of the day. Left
fielder Ryan Turner singled but
he and Hammonds were stranded
on first and third respectively as
designated hitter Troy Tallman
popped out to center field to end
the Cardinal onslaught.
Yesterday's game was the last
of five straight for the Cardinal,
but the first of the weekend series
in which Hammonds felt he was
playing up to par.
"I felt good going into every
game," Hammonds said. "I felt as
though I was hitting the ball well,
seeing the ball very well, but I had
nothing to show for it."
Hammonds was l-for-15 over
the last four games.
"I was swinging a lot of balls off
the plate that weren't strikes and
that I couldn't do much with,"
Hammonds said. "I had put
myself into a hole." He climbed
out of this hole yesterday and
hopes to stay out.
"Over the next five games
before league games start I'm
going to try to get my eye down,"
Hammonds said. "I feel as though
my swing is there; I just have to
swing at the right pitches."
Cardinal starting pitcher
Moore allowed only two hits and
no earned runs over five innings.
Dorlarque and Lynch split the last

don't get any play
ing time.'

four innings, pitching two each
and allowing only one hit total.
"Moore had a good pitching
performance," Marquess said.
"He hadn't pitched for a while."
Moore started last Tuesday
against the University of the
Pacific but allowed four earned
runs in the first two innings.
Stanford went into the week
end series with a 7-0 record but
dropped the first two games to the
Fresno State Bulldogs in 7-1 and
5-4 decisions. The Cardinal came
back with a 6-3 win over the Bull
dogs and a 7-0 shutout of Cal.
State Los Angeles. The Cardinal
emerges from the long weekend
series with a 3-2 record.
"We got a chance to play a lot of
different people and pitch quite a
few guys this weekend," Mar
quess said. "It worked out well.
I'm pleased with the way we're
playing. I think we're probably
ahead of schedule."
The Stanford Cardinal will con
tinue its season with a three-game
series against the Owls of Rice
University this weekend.
