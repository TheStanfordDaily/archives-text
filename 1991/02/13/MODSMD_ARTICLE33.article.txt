# Stanford gets kick in the rear, looks to NCAA tourney
## 
### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
Saturday's women's basketball game
was one of the most exciting athletic
contests ever played on the Farm —
of any sex. There was action — fast
breaks, stifling defense, one-on-ones —
there was talent, there was suspense, and
there was a wild, supportive home crowd
for the televised game. The contest had to
be one of the best things to happen to
women's basketball along the lines of
gaining national popularity — ever.
The fact that Stanford lost the game
69-68, however — its first home loss after
42 consecutive victories and almost three
seasons — has Cardinal hoops aficionados
up in arms.
"Never mind that it was just by one
point; we lost."
"That's it, there goes the season. Lost
our fourth game of the year, on our come
court, and to rival Washington to boot. No
way we're going to repeat now," fans have
been grumbling the past four days.
Not so fast; there. It was, indeed, a
tough loss, and Washington sure acted
like the win in Maples was the biggest
thing in the world, but the season is by no
means over. In fact, the defeat may have
been just what the Cardinal women
needed.
Stanford did only lose by one point —
by a desperation shot at the buzzer — and
didn't even have a good game. The play

ers couldn't get the ball inside when they
needed to, they were sloppy on defense,
and they slipped on fundamentals in the
heat of the contest. It was probably one of
the Cardinal's worst games of the year,
and the squad still only lost by one.
Stanford has played much better on
numerous other occasions this season,
including at Washington —where they
defeated the Huskies 75-71 — and
against Georgia and UNLV who didn't
even get a chance against the swarming
Cardinal earlier in the season at Maples.
"We have been playing very well but
didn't play particularly well against
Washington," Stanford coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "It honestly was not one of
our best performances. lAndl if that's as
bad as we can play and it was a one point
game, that tells a lot about our team."
Stanford has already shown it can win
on the road, coming up with big victories
in hostile environments at both Seattle
and at Long Beach, where the Cardinal
took care of the ranked Forty-Niners
quite easily.
And even though the Cardinal almost
did win 'em all last season — dropping a
lone contest on the road to the national
championship — it's a nearly impossible
feat. This year the best record in the
country belongs to Virginia, who has
already dropped one, and there is still a
month to go until regionals are selected.
Stanford is only human, especially after
losing team leaders Jennifer Azzi and

Katy Steding to graduation.
"People are expecting us to win [every
thing]," VanDerveer explained. "We are
human — we're not a basketball
machine. Just like the [San Franciscol
Forty-Niners."
And for the living/breathing Cardinal,
this loss may be the kick in the rear it was
looking for. No team can just cruise into
the Final Four without an eye-opener
along the way, and being defending
national champion makes it that much
more difficult. Last year the red-hot
women were handed humility before the
regular season was over by the very same
Washington squad, no less. The result? A
National Champions banner hanging
from the rafters at Maples.
Stanford may be able to do more of the
same this year, especially since it knows it
can beat the Huskies — away, when it
wants to.
And if that isn't enough, there's a very
good chance a third Washington match
up awaits the Cardinal — in the NCAA
regionals. VanDerveer can't wait.
"We definitely could be playing them in
the Regional," VanDerveer said. "There's
nothing I'd like more. [If the match-up
happensl I'd book a non-refundable ticket
to New Orleans."
Washington aside, is the Cardinal
talented enough to repeat? It did
lose its team captains, team moti
vators and team soul when Player of the

Year Azzi and Steding graduated. This
year's squad even has a I>freshman
starting!
VanDerveer thinks so, if everything
falls into place.
According to Stanford's in-house bas
ketball guru, a national champion needs
leadership, rebounding, defense, mental
toughness and physical talent. The Cardi
nal has all the pieces, it just needs to use
them — at the same time.
There's Trisha Stevens and Sonja
Henning, team captains, to take charge.
Val Whiting is one of — if not the — best
rebounders in the country. Henning,
Whiting, Chris MacMurdo and company
have shown they can slow down the best
of them. And the squad definitely has tal
ent — from All-America candidate Hen
ning down to the bench.
But all is not perfect — yet — in Cardi
nal Land, as Saturday evening showed.
VanDerveer thinks the team still needs to
work on its low scoring in addition to the
wings' decisions and ball handling, needs

more consistency Irom the back-up
guards and more focus overall.
She is sure, however, that the founda
tion is there. "It sounds like we have a lot
of work to do — but they are all things we
are capable of doing. We have a guaran
teed seven games left, and this team
doesn't want it to be over,"' VanDerveer
said. "This team has carried the pressure
of being national champions extremely
well. It just has to get out of that shadow
and be the best team it can be."
And one more thing. Stanford is just
plain tired of not getting any respect. Last
season, with the best record in the nation,
the highest the Cardinal was ever ranked
was second!
And this year? The defending national
hovered around eighth for most of the
season, even though they were clearly
better then some of the squads ranked
higher. With the single loss to the Huskies
the team has plummeted to eleventh -, even
Washington, with one viable win to its
name, is ranked tenth.
Stanford knows it's better than it's
given credit for.
"We're not getting a whole lot of
respect, but we didn't last year either.
Sometimes I think people say, 'Oh, its just
Stanford," VanDerveer added. "|But]
we're not worrying about it, we're just
going to do it on the floor through the
NCAA 1 tournament).
"The final poll is what we're shooting
for."
