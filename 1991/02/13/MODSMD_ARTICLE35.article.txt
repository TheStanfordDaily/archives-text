If someone has wronged you in the past in
any way, you might want to give either
Janel Jorgensen or Willie Adams a call.
Last year at the NCAA Women's Swimming
Championships, the Texas longhorns upset
the Cardinal, but Jorgensen helped avenge
that loss by swimming like a champ and
helping Stanford overtake Texas in a close
meet Friday. Likewise, Adams shut down the

bats of the Fresno State Bulldogs, who had
taken two games from Stanford in as many
days, by pitching magnificently.
Jorgensen, a 5-foot-9 sophomore from
Ridr*efield, Conn., started off Friday's con
test by swimming the backstroke leg of the
400-yard medley relay. Her field of competi
tion included Beth Barr, backstroke swim
mer for the U.S. silver medal 400-meter
medley relay team in the 1988 Olympics, and
Jodi Wilson, who placed third in the 100
backstroke at the NCAA championships last
year. Nevertheless, the sophomore gave
Stanford a 0.67-second lead.
In the 100 freestyle, she was able to upset
two time defending NCAA champion Leigh
Ann Fetter, and was able to capture first
place in both the 200 freestyle and 100 but
terfly.

Adams, a 6-foot-7 freshman from La
Mirada, Calif., salvaged the Cardinal base
ball team's disastrous weekend scries with
the Bulldogs by pitching Stanford's first
complete game victory this year.
Adams was strong through the entire
game except for a faulty seventh when he
was touched up for a couple of runs. "I was
starting to get the curve up a little and I was
a little frustrated," he said. "But after the
homerun I had a fresh start and got a little
tougher."
He certainly did, and the freshman held
them to just six as he grabbed his team lead
ing third victory.

The low hit total was a result of Adams'
exceptional control of his pitches. He walked
just one while striking out ninp and kept the
ball on the corner all day.
"He was getting a good fastball and break
ing ball over the corner," said Fresno State
coach Bob Bennet. "We were looking to got to
him early and shake him up because he is a
freshman, but he showed a lot of poise."
