# Go-Cart Service provides disabled students with rides to class
##

Despite continuing funding problems,
the two-year-old Disability Go-Cart Ser
vice has found its niche â€” providing dis
abled students free transportation to
campus destinations that cars cannot
reach.
Formerly called the Paratransit Cart
Service, organizers changed the pro
gram's name this fall to the catchier Dis
ability Go-Cart Service, or "Dis Go-Cart."
"About 1,000 people a year get a cane
or crutches from Cowell (Student Health
Center), so there's a huge demand for our
service," said program director Yu-Min
Shen, a senior.
However, organizers said the service
may not be around next year if its ASSU

special fee request is not approved in the
spring elections.
With an annual budget of about
$18,000, the service operates two golf
carts, employs 12 drivers and serves five
to seven students on an average day. It
offers disabled students free rides to des
tinations throughout campus from 7:30
a.m. to 5:30 p.m. every weekday.
The Disability Resource Center also
offers a van service for disabled students.
However, each van ride costs $20, and the
van cannot access parts of campus where
automobiles are prohibited.
Unlike the golf carts, however, the van
is equipped to handle wheel chairs and
operates around the clock. It carries from
two to four students daily.
"It would cost [disabled students] $150
a month to rent a two-seater golf cart

from our cart supplier, Turf and Indus
trial Equipment, on their own," Shen
said.
While most customers have sprained
ankles, broken legs, injured knees and
other temporary problems, some perma
nently disabled students also use the ser
vice regularly.
"The service has sure made my life a
heck of a lot easier," said law student Ana
Miranda, who has cerebral palsy. She uses
the service to get to classes and other
activities around campus. "I'm not sure I
could handle the campus without it."
Because it was denied its special fee
request last spring, the Go-Cart service is
being partially funded by the University
Committee on Parking and Transporta
tion. The committee currently gives the
program $11,000, Shen said.

The service asked the ASSU Program
Board for the remaining $7,000 it needs
to avoid a deficit, but the request was
turned down. As a result, organizers plan
to ask the parking committee for the rest
of the money, Shen said.
ASSU by-laws prohibit the use of Pro
gram Board funding for student salaries,
he added.
Shen said he thinks the committee will
grant the service's request, but specu
lated that the program will not be able to
operate next year if it is again refused its
$18,000 special fee request.
"Dis Go-Cart provides a really impor
tant service and I hope students will rec
ognize that," said driver Cliff Wu, a
senior. "Without it, if you get in an acci
dent, you're basically screwed."

Cowell currently advises temporarily
disabled students about their transporta
tion options, which include renting their
own carts and taking advantage of the
Go-Cart service or the University van
program.
The golf cart service was developed in
spring quarter of 1989 as a pilot project
by Charles Day, who graduated last year.
Day suffered a basketball injury and
found much difficulty getting around
campus.
At the time, the van service was the
only transportation option for injured or
disabled students.
The parking committee is giving the
golf cart and van services a total of
$22,000 this year, according to a commit
tee member.
