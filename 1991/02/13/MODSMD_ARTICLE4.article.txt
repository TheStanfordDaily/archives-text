# Domestic Partners debate ends
## 
### Dylan Tyson Editorial staff 
After months of heated arguments on
both sides of the issue, debate over the
University's domestic partners policy —
at least on the administrative level —
appears to have come to an end.
The Board of Trustees' ad hoc com
mittee on student housing policy
reported to the full board yesterday that
it supports the policy which they said is
fully in agreement with Stanford's non
discrimination policy.
"The full board concluded that the

domestic partners policy is in line with
the pre-existing and quite long-standing
policy of non-discrimination that the
University has had," said trustee Susan
Prager, a member of the ad hoc commit
tee and dean of the UCLA law school.
The policy, approved by the Univer
sity Oct. 9, grants married student priv
ileges to unmarried heterosexual and
gay and lesbian couples who apply for
them. These benefits include living in
married student housing and having the
opportunity to use campus libraries and
recreational facilities.
Prager said the board examined the

adequacy of the policy in light of the
University's non-discriminatory policy
rather than delving into specific com
plaints.
The committee decided the policy is
simply an implementation of a larger
non-discriminatory policy, she
explained.
In addition, the committee assessed
the ability of the housing system to deal
with any new burdens the policy may
create.
"We found there [are] no access prob-
lems for married student hous
ing," Prager said. "The shortages
in graduate housing are in the
area of single occupancy," while
there is a surplus of available
space in married student housing,
she added. Most of the people liv
ing in married housing are placed
in Escondido Village.
Although the board listened to
the committee's report, it took no
vote on the policy.
"The Board doesn't [vote] on
most administrative actions,"
said Rich Kurovsky, director of
University relations. "It plays a
fiduciary role and does not review
every policy."
Members of the gay, lesbian
and bisexual community said they
view the end of the board's debate
as a victory.
"We're certainly happy that
the trustees have maintained the
policy," said David Bradfute, an
openly gay graduate student who
supported the passage of the
domestic partners policy. "We
were hopeful this would happen. .
. . I see the policy very much as
flowing from the Stanford state
ment on non-discrimination."
Jim Gaither, president of the
Board of Trustees, requested the
formation of the ad hoc commit
tee at the board's December meet
ing. The committee was charged
with reviewing concerns
expressed about the new policy,
Kurovsky said.
Alumni who had written to
criticize the policy were referred
to the committee, said Elizabeth
Sloan, the director of communica
tion for the Office of Develop
ment.
One concern the committee
evaluated was a fear among some

couples that living near gay and
lesbian couples could be detri
mental to their children.
The committee felt the con
cerns of heterosexual couples are
solved by a current University
policy that clusters people in like
groups, Prager said. For example,
families with children are housed
in different sections than couples
without children. "The Univer
sity will continue this policy," said
Prager.
In supporting the policy, the ad
hoc committee did not consider
its financial implications, some of
which may be negative, Prager
said.
"There will probably be some

fallout over the long-term, but
I'm really reluctant to give a dol
lar figure," Sloan said. The mail
from detractors outnumbers the
mail from supporters, but that is
true in any controversy, Sloan
said.
There is also some anecdotal
evidence claiming that people will
withdraw their financial support
from the University for moral
reasons, but that is a hard thing
to quantify, she added.
"The statement of the commit
tee is a positive thing," Sloan said.
"It will bring a sense of closure to
the issue.
"But," she conceded, "it isn't
going to do it for some people."
