# Dante and danishes, Kafka and coffee: Bookstore cafe opens
## 
### Judy Hsu 
As one of the final stages in its
remodeling, the Stanford Book
store opened a new second floor
cafe Monday, replacing its old
candy counter.
The cafe exists mostly to make
the Bookstore more complete, said
Annette Walsh, a purchaser for
the store.
The idea for the cafe was con
ceived early in the Bookstore's
remodeling plan as a way to boost
the store's quality, officials said.
"From the beginning, [the cafe]
was part of the program [since].. .
there was a great desire ... that
the Bookstore ambience be
enhanced," said general manager
Eldon Speed.
The still unnamed cafe over
looks the entrance area below. In
addition to the muffins, cookies,
brownies and fudge that were
available at the candy counter, the
cafe will sell danishes, cakes,
quiche, soup and bagels. Coffees,
milk and juices will also be served.
Since its opening, there has
been a constant stream of cus
tomers purchasing Valentine's
Day candies, muffins and truffles,
workers said.

Walsh said, "We wanted some
thing a little upscale with a Euro
pean flavor."
"We're not really ready for peo
ple to see us and expect us to look
perfect," she said, explaining why
Bookstore planners are not giving
the cafe much publicity. The cap
puccino machine is still being
installed and the staff is adjusting
to the new environment, she said.
The cafe elicited positive
responses from Bookstore em
ployees. "I think it's a great idea,
said Jeannie Sturm. "It'll pull a
lot of people into the store."
"I think it looks really nice and
I know that people have been com
ing in to sit in the chairs," said her
co-worker, Jane Botsford. The
cafe "will be a real asset to the
Bookstore, especially once it gets
going," she added.
The managers of other restau
rants on campus say the Book
store cafe will offer a type of ser
vice that will not directly compete
with them.
Diana Wells, assistant manager
of the Coffee House, did not know
about the cafe. However, she said
she thinks the cafe will be "a good
thing."

"I don't feel like it's going to be
any competition for us," she
added.
Mary Clark, manager of Bon
Appetit, which caters Tresidder
Union, also had not heard of the
cafe. "I think that's neat," she
said when told about it.
She added she does not expect
the Bookstore cafe to interfere
with her business across White
Plaza because the cafe has "a dif
ferent type of service" than
Tresidder, which she described as
more of a "sit down and have-a
full-meal" place.
Bookstore planners said they
have a contingency plan if the cafe
does not attract enough cus
tomers: the sale of baked goods
will be canceled and the cafe will
revert back to a candy counter.
Eventually there will be a wall
of magazines and newspapers
adjacent to the cafe. Walsh hopes
to install more tables, sell gelato
and make more beverages avail
able.
Stanford students will be given
a chance to exercise their imagina
tion and win a bookstore gift cer
tificate by entering the cafe-nam
ing contest.
