Stanford joins coalition to
improve engineering education
Stanford and seven other U.S. institutions
have formed a National Engineering Education
Coalition to restructure and increase the effec
tiveness of undergraduate engineering education.
The coalition plans to devise ways of increas
ing the number of engineering graduates, partic
ularly among women and minorities, as well as
produce better engineers to meet the growing
industry.
The National Science Foundation has awarded
$3 million a year for the next five years to fund
the coalition's various projects. The universities,
which include Cornell University and UC-Berke
ley, must generate a dollar-for-dollar matching
fund to ensure the foundation's continued sup
port, according to Sheri Sheppard, assistant pro
fessor of mechanical engineering and a leader of
Stanford's coalition team.
The coalition is devising changes in the way

engineering is taught. Their proposed strategies
include using information technology to make the
learning process exciting.
Search committee for
athletic director appointed
University President Donald Kennedy
appointed a search committee yesterday for a new
athletics director.
The committee is charged with finding a
replacement for Andy Geiger, who resigned last
year to become athletic director at the University
of Maryland. Alan Cummings is currently the act
ing director for the Department of Athletics.
Robert Freelen, vice president for public
affairs, will chair the committee. Other members
include Stanford Athletic Board President Fidela
Schneider, Organizational Behavior Prof. Jerry
Porras and Stanford football player Glyn Mil
burn.
