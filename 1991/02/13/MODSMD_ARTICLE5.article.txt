# Library employee's firing angers union
## 
### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Staff writer 
In December, Saren Simitian
left his position of checking stu
dent IDs and knapsacks at Meyer
Library for a similar one at Green
Library. The move was supposed
to expand his annual work time
from nine months to a year, he
said.
Now Simitian is out of time and
out of work.
After weeks of warnings about
inadequate job performance,
meetings with Green Library offi
cials and allegations of personnel
harassment, Simitian, 68, was
fired yesterday.
Officials from the United Stan
ford Workers, noting the rapid fir
ing of Simitian just weeks after he
changed jobs, said they are suspi

cious of the library's motives and
will seek unspecified redress.
Green administrators pre
sented Simitian a letter explain
ing the reasons for their decision.
The letter states Simitian had
exhibited an "inability to satisfac
torily perform the duties of his
position and failure to meet the
goals established in certain meet
ings . . . and communicated ... in
written documents."
The firing came after he was
evaluated four times in just over
five weeks, Simitian said. He
blamed library officials for being
hasty in their decision.
"They did not give me a chance
to do the job. The negative criti
cisms that I got [occurred] when I
was just starting," Simitian said.
