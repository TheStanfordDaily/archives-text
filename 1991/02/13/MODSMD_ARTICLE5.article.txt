# Library employee's firing angers union
## 
### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Staff writer 
In December, Saren Simitian
left his position of checking stu
dent IDs and knapsacks at Meyer
Library for a similar one at Green
Library. The move was supposed
to expand his annual work time
from nine months to a year, he
said.
Now Simitian is out of time and
out of work.
After weeks of warnings about
inadequate job performance,
meetings with Green Library offi
cials and allegations of personnel
harassment, Simitian, 68, was
fired yesterday.
Officials from the United Stan
ford Workers, noting the rapid fir
ing of Simitian just weeks after he
changed jobs, said they are suspi

cious of the library's motives and
will seek unspecified redress.
Green administrators pre
sented Simitian a letter explain
ing the reasons for their decision.
The letter states Simitian had
exhibited an "inability to satisfac
torily perform the duties of his
position and failure to meet the
goals established in certain meet
ings . . . and communicated ... in
written documents."
The firing came after he was
evaluated four times in just over
five weeks, Simitian said. He
blamed library officials for being
hasty in their decision.
"They did not give me a chance
to do the job. The negative criti
cisms that I got [occurred] when I
was just starting," Simitian said.
Many Green workers and
administrators questioned about
the firing declined to comment.
Doug Dupen, deputy director of
Employee Relations for the Uni
versity, said in a telephone inter
view that Simitian "did not per
form his job well." Simitian was
responsible for checking the iden
tification of incoming patrons,
assisting visitors with inquiries
and checking the books and bags
of people exiting the library.
Yesterday's dismissal stirred
anger in the USW, the union that
represents Simitian.
The union will file a grievance
against the University stating
that Simitian was fired without
just cause, said USW field repre
sentative Mike Tatum.
"I have never seen a case where
a person was fired so quickly
except for gross misconduct and

the like," Tatum said. "Something
is definitely fishy about this. It
stinks," he added.
News of the firing surprised
and shocked many, employees at
Meyer, where Simitian had
worked nearly four years. One of
his former supervisors at Meyer,
who asked not to be identified,
described him as dependable and
always cheerful.
Gail Kline, an entrance moni
tor at Meyer and a former co
worker, said he was "a nice person
who would even come into the
library on his days off to mingle
with people."
"I cannot imagine what he
could have done to deserve this,"
she added.
But a former supervisor at
Meyer suggested that Simitian
had problems at Meyer that were
heightened at Green.
Library specialist Jesus Gaspar
said although Simitian was punc
tual and had good attendance, he
was given morning duty at Meyer
because he was unable to close the

library effectively at night.
"In his job function Saren
could not remember all the things
that he had to do in the day and he
was very slow, " Gaspar added.
Simitian was friendly and well
liked by students, staff and fac
ulty, Gaspar said. But he added
that Simitian's primary obligation
was not to socialize. "As far as
public relations goes he was great,
but there were other responsibili
ties to the job."
Gaspar added that Simitian
was stubborn and refused to
acknowledge a need to improve.
Simitian was probably hired at
Green despite his performance at
Meyer, because under the USW
contract he had to be given the
first opportunity to take the job,
Gaspar said.
"Some of the worst employees
we have had at Meyer have come
through this process" of union
bidding, Gaspar said.
Simitian said the issue of why
he was hired never came up dur
ing interviews for the Green posi

tion.
He also claimed that any job
related problems were not his
fault entirely and could in part be
blamed on "readjustment" to his
new post.
It took some time to get accus
tomed to Green's system, which
does not have metal detectors and
requires more attention in exam
ining backpacks, he added.
Around the time he assumed
the position at Green, the number
of people manning the entrance
station was cut from two people to
one, making his job more difficult,
Simitian said.
He said he was harassed by
Green officials who at first, would
not allow him to bring water to
the entrance desk so that he could
take medication.
Simitian acknowledged the
USW is working on his behalf but
did not comment on their specific
plans for his case. He said he plans
to volunteer at two local ecological
and environmental awareness
groups.
