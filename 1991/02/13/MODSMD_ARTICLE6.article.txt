# WAR IN THE GULF
## Marine and naval forces join fire in 'training program' 
### 
DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) — In a fore
taste of all-out war, Marine and naval gunners
combined their fire with U.S. air strikes yester
day to pound Iraqi tanks and artillery massed
in southern Kuwait.
Saddam Hussein, meanwhile, welcomed a
Soviet bid to try to end the Persian Gulf War
short of a bloody fight to the finish in the
desert. But the Iraqi president showed no sign
of backing off from Kuwait.
The U.S. command said the thunderous

land-sea-and-air barrage that shook southern
Kuwait could be described as part of "our training
program" — training for the mtyor offensive that
may lie over the horizon.
Iraq's Parliament speaker said the Iraqi military
has saved its "lethal developed weapons" — an
apparent reference to chemical and biological arms
— from the non-stop air raids.
In the Iraqi capital, where two government min
istry buildings were devastated by direct bomb hits
yesterday, Soviet envoy Yevgeny Primakov presented
Saddam with a verbal message from Mikhail Gor
bachev conveying the Kremlin leader's view of the
conflict, Baghdad radio said.
The Soviets have said an Iraqi withdrawal from
Kuwait is a first condition for peace — a condition
Saddam has rejected.
The radio quoted the Iraqi president as telling
Primakov he is prepared to cooperate with the Soviet
Union "in the interest of finding a peaceful, political,
equitable and honorable solution to the region's cen
tral issues, including the situation in the Gulf."
At the same time, however, Saddam declared the
Iraqi people were determined to "beat back the
aggressors," the radio said.
After a meeting of foreign ministers from 15 non
aligned nations in Yugoslavia, it was announced that
a delegation would go to Baghdad to try to head off
an escalation of the war. Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati of Iran, which seeks to mediate the conflict,
said a message received from Saddam means "our
'idea for peace' is very much alive." He did not elab
orate.
