# Defender of Roe v. Wade speaks out
## 
### Alexa Lee Staff writer 
Sarah Weddington, attorney in
the landmark Roe v. Wade case
that legalized abortion, shared her
experiences last night in a speech
in Annenberg Auditorium and
encouraged the audience to
assume leadership roles in the
19905.
Weddington said her role in the
case began in 1973 when she was
approached by a group of women
from Austin, Texas, who were
concerned that women were cross
ing into Mexico to get abortions,
which were illegal in Texas. She
agreed to represent the women,
who wanted legal abortions to be
guaranteed in that state.
She said she did not know then
that the case, the first one she had
ever argued in court, would even
tually set precedents for abortion
laws for many years.
"When I started, 1 had no idea
that it would end up in the [U.S.I
Supreme Court, but it was some
thing that I cared deeply about,"
Weddington said.
Today Weddington is a lecturer
in history and government at the
University of Texas and at Texas

Sarah Weddington, tha successful defending lawyer of the landmark Roe vs. Wade
case, gives her experiences and aspirations in a speech held last night in Annenberg
Auditorium. She stressed that much responsibility lies with the youth, who are most
affected by the decisions of today.
Women's University. Following
her involvement with the Roe v.
Wade case, she worked as general
counsel for the Department of
Agriculture.
Her concern over a woman's
right to abortion still remains, but
Weddington now sees the issue
with a new perspective. "The
issue today is less legal than polit
ical," she said.
Despite fears by some pro
choice advocates that Roe v. Wade
may be overturned by the more
conservative U.S. Supreme Court,
Weddington said, "I do not think
that the Supreme Court will ever
write a sentence that says Roe v.
Wade is overturned."
She added, however, that the
ultimate power to decide abortion
law now lies with the states. She
cited two examples — Utah and
the U.S. territory of Guam —

where Roe v. Wade is being chal
lenged.
Weddington called on today's
youth to prepare for being leaders
by "practicing leadership in our
daily lives, watching with a critical
eye the things going on in the
world and effectively using com
munication skills."
"I am to this day still a leader
in-training," she added.
"When I look at [the abortion
issue], I see more and more how
critical it is that we have leaders
within college communities work
ing for this cause, because what
you do becomes the real difference
in what will happen in the
future," she said.
"I hope you will use this experi
ence for leadership so that when
something touches your heart,
you will respond," Weddington
said in closing.
Weddington's speech was spon
sored by the ASSU speakers
bureau and was attended by about
60 people, most of whom were
female.
