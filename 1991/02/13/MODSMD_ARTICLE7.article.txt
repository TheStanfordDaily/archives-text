Sarah Weddington, attorney in
the landmark Roe v. Wade case
that legalized abortion, shared her
experiences last night in a speech
in Annenberg Auditorium and
encouraged the audience to
assume leadership roles in the
19905.
Weddington said her role in the
case began in 1973 when she was
approached by a group of women
from Austin, Texas, who were
concerned that women were cross
ing into Mexico to get abortions,
which were illegal in Texas. She
agreed to represent the women,
who wanted legal abortions to be
guaranteed in that state.
She said she did not know then
that the case, the first one she had
ever argued in court, would even
tually set precedents for abortion
laws for many years.
"When I started, 1 had no idea
that it would end up in the [U.S.I
Supreme Court, but it was some
thing that I cared deeply about,"
Weddington said.
Today Weddington is a lecturer
in history and government at the
University of Texas and at Texas
