ferries, email, scary, JPL, back rubs, windchimes,
Whitney, San Jacinto, exaggerations, UW, Wooster,
Billy Joel, Paula Abdul, gruff and studly, sunsets, apple
stems, oatmeal, falling stars, Spike and Scruffy,
Princesses, closed parks, sonnets, no socks, ami slurpees. I
hope you know that I'll always be there for you.

Jonathan
