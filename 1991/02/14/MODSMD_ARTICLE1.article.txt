# BOMBING KILLS IRAQI CIVILIANS

DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) -
Allied warplanes, in a pinpoint bombing
that sent shock waves far beyond Iraq,
destroyed an underground structure in
Baghdad yesterday, and officials said 500
civilians were killed. Iraq called it a bomb
shelter, the United States a military com
mand center.
By nightfall, 14 hours after the pre
dawn attack, crews were still pulling
charred bodies, some of them children,
from the rubble, an Associated Press cor
respondent reported from Baghdad. Dis
traught relatives crowded the smoke
filled streets.
Iraq's health minister, Abdel-Salam
Mohammed Saeed, described the preci
sion bombing as "a well-planned crime."
But the U.S. command in Saudi Ara
bia, and later the White House, said the

subterranean concrete facility had been
positively identified as an Iraqi military
command-and-control center, and the
right target was hit.
"We don't know why civilians were at
that location," said Marlin Fitzwater,
President Bush's spokesman. American
officials blamed Iraq's leadership for the
tragedy, saying it had put civilians "in
harm's way."
The AP correspondent, Dilip Ganguly,
inspected the ruins with other journalists
and said he saw no obvious sign that it
had a military use.
The New York Times reported Thurs
day that Iraq had hidden a major military
communications center in a secret base
ment of the Al-Rashid Hotel. The Bagh
dad hotel, where foreign reporters and
others stay, is off limits for allied bomb

ing, the story said.
The Times said sophisticated commu
nications links run from the hotel base
ment under city streets to three bridges
that lead out of the city. One, the Jum
buriya Bridge, has already been destroyed
by allied bombs.
It said the hotel was the last of four
communications centers the allies have
targeted for destruction. The others, at
the Telecommications Building, Defense
Ministry and Baathist Party headquar
ters, have been badly damaged or
destroyed.

At U.N. headquarters in New York,
where Third World diplomats sought an
open Security Council discussion on the
conflict, an African delegate, Bagbeni
Nzengeya of Zaire, said the civilian
deaths "will make everyone think again
about the scope of the war" — a war
fought under the authority of Security
Council resolutions ordering Iraq to end
its occupation of Kuwait.
The Soviet Union, meanwhile,
announced another step in its search for a
negotiated settlement to the Persian Gulf
War.
Iraq's foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, will
fly to Moscow this weekend to meet with
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, a
Soviet spokesman said. A Soviet envoy's
talks Tuesday with Iraqi President Sad
dam Hussein in Baghdad "give cause for

hope," the spokesman said without elabo
ration.
The Soviets have said an Iraqi with
drawal from Kuwait is a first condition
for peace. Iraq has insisted, however, it
will never give up the emirate.
The deadly Baghdad air strike was
among 2,800 sorties mounted by Opera
tion Desert Storm in favorably clear skies
yesterday.
About one-third of the missions were
directed at targets in southern Iraq and
Iraqi-occupied Kuwait, aimed at "soften
ing up" the dug-in positions of Iraqi
troops before the expected ground offen
sive by the U.S.-led alliance.
The refugees who reached Jordan
attested to the fury of the non-stop bom-

bardment in Kuwait.
"There is constant bombing,
not on the city but all around, and
there are fires burning every
where," said one woman, Amal
Saleh al-Korani, 24. "Our house
was shaking from the bombs and
the windows broke."
Saudi officers reported that
one of their attack planes, an F-5,
was lost on a bombing mission
against ground forces in Iraq, and
the pilot was listed as missing.
Before word flashed from
Baghdad of yesterday's devastat
ing attack, U.S. officers told
reporters in Riyadh, the Saudi
capital, that the Iraqi military had
managed to maintain communica
tions links despite more than
three weeks of nonstop bombing.
It was clear U.S. strategists were
anxious to knock out more of
these command-and-control net
works.
The night's raids on Baghdad,
described by residents as among
the worst of the air war, began
about 8 p.m. Tuesday and lasted
12 hours, Ganguly reported.
Telecommunications centers in
two Baghdad districts were
among the sites bombed.

At about 4 a.m., it was the turn
of the 40-foot-deep underground
structure — which U.S. officials
acknowledge was built as a bomb
shelter — in al-Amerieh, a mid
dle-class neighborhood.
Iraqi officials said 400 to 500
people had moved into the facility
after the bombing began Jan. 17,
and hundreds more joined them
because this week's bombing was
particularly intense.
At least two weapons — U.S.
spokesmen said they were two
bombs from planes — struck the
shelter, one slamming into the
entrance and cutting off the lone
escape route with debris, the sec
ond piercing the 9-foot-thick roof
and exploding inside the struc
ture, the Iraqis said.
Emergency teams and local
residents who rushed to the site
found an inferno. Rescue efforts
proceeded slowly, but by mid
morning more than 40 charred
bodies were laid out on the
ground, Ganguly reported.
By nightfall, Abdul Razak Has
san al-Janaby, a supervisor of the
facility, said 235 bodies had been
recovered and at least 300 more
were believed still trapped in the
wreckage.
