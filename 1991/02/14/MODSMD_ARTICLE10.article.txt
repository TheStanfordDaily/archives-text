# SMILES entertains the sick

For sophomore Kendra Kill
patrick and 30 other Stanford
students, taking a break from
studying involves spending two
hours a week to play with chil
dren.
As the creator of Project
SMILES, Killpatrick coordi
nates a group of volunteers who
play and interact with sick chil
dren and their siblings in the
reception area and waiting
room of the Stanford Children's
Hospital.
Project SMILES, which
stands for "Students Making
Illness a Little Easier," was
begun last spring and was for
mally incorporated into the hos
pital last quarter. The projects
works with children who are
outpatients.
The time the students spend
at the hospital is not all play,
however. The students fill a
"need that has been there for a

long time," said hospital Volun
teer Coordinator Charlene Mat
tos.
Project Smiles "is great for
the kids" because many of them
do not get a lot of attention, said
Clinic Supervisor Mary McCall.
"The wait can be long if they are
dropping in" without an
appointment.
Some of the students have
also been able to assist in com
municating with the children. It
is helpful that "a lot of the stu
dents are bilingual," because of
the "large Hispanic community
here," McCall said.
Iris Loza, a receptionist at
the clinic, said she thinks the
volunteer group has been very
successful. "From our end, it's
working great. Kids are
responding. [They] get enter
tained. They get sad when [the
volunteers] leave."
Mattos said the program has
been "tremendously well
received [by] the administration
and the nurses." The project

will move with the clinic in May
to the newly constructed Lucille
Packard Children's Hospital
next to the Medical Center.
Last year, Killpatrick won
the Alumni Association's
Robert L. Pierce Award, which
grants $1,500 annually to a new
student group. She said most of
the money was spent on play
things and drawing books for
the children.
The hospital's Child and
Family Life department agreed
to match the funds used to pur
chase toys and other supplies.
Killpatrick said starting the
project has "gone much
smoother" than she thought it
would. But she has yet to
receive the hands-on experience
she has been seeking. "I've been
doing the administrative side of
it, maybe next year. .
Students can apply to join
the program by writing a brief
paragraph describing their
interest in the project, Kill
patrick said.
