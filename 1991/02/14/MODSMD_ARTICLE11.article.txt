### Howard Libit Staff writer 
The Hammer and Coffin Soci
ety announced at an open meet
ing last night that "Click Here for
Fee Refund" will be the name of
their slate for the Council of Pres
idents in this spring's ASSU elec
tion.
The society, which is composed
of the "ruling elite" of the Cha
parral, the campus humor maga
zine, declined to announce the
names of their candidates for fear
of being disqualified by the ASSU
Elections Commission, said
senior Michael Schreiber, the
society's own elections commis
sioner.
ASSU Hearings Officer Doreen
Musson announced Monday night
at an informational meeting for
prospective candidates that all
forms of campaigning — includ

ing any announcements in the
press about a candidate's inten
tion to run — are prohibited until
April 10, one week before the elec
tion.
Schreiber also said the organi
zation would have a "substantial"
senatorial slate but again refused
to name the candidates in order to
abide by the ASSU rule.
Hammer and Coffin members
said they were generally opposed
to many of the campaign rules
new ASSU rules for this year's
election.
"[The ASSU elections commis
sion] is trying to make its rules so
specific that the primary focus of
a campaign is to get around them
rather than make general rules to
maintain the spirit of the elec
tion," said Chaparral editor Dave
Hyatt, a junior.
The society does support a pro
posal attempting to increase voter

turnout by having more polling
places because "we are a party for
the people," Schreiber said.
The Hammer and Coffin elec
tions commission was formed to
find ways of working around the
wording of specific campaign
rules, such as a limit on the num
ber of fliers and on campaign bud
gets, Schreiber said. The commis
sion hopes the limits will generate
debate, an area that Schreiber
believes is the society's
"strength."
While it is still early in the
campaign, the society has a plan
for helping "Click Here for Fee
Refund" win.
"We spent $40 two years ago
on the campaign and received 800
votes. We have figured, through
complex economic calculations,
that if we spend $100 we can win
the entire election," Schreiber
said.
