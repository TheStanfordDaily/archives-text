Worshippers die in Mexico
MEXICO CITY (AP) - At least 36 Ash
Wednesday worshipers died when crowds tried
to cram into a church famed for a religious icon
believed to have miracle-working powers.
About 25 people were injured in the crush at
the Sanctuary of Our Lord of Chalma about 40
miles south of Mexico City, said Carlos Mota, a
spokesman for the state of Mexico government.
"Some people were trampled and others suf
focated inside the church in the atrium," he
said in a telephone interview.
Mota said at least 3,500 worshippers were
at the Mass and authorities had trouble find
ing enough ambulances.
The hilltop sanctuary draws Ash Wednes
day pilgrims from all over the nation to pray
before an icon of the crucified Jesus.
U.S. Embassy in Bonn fired upon
BONN, Germany (AP) — Shots were fired
yesterday night at the U.S. Embassy in the Bad
Godesburg district of Bonn, police said. No
injuries were reported.
ARD television said an initial investigation
indicates machine gun fire was involved in the
shooting, and that several bullets struck an
outside wall of the U.S. building.
Police in Bonn confirmed shots had been
fired in the vicinity of the Embassy, and that
the incident was under investigation.
Dozens of police converged on the area and
cordoned off the Embassy, with submachine
gun-toting police keeping reporters and the
curious back from the building.
Klaus Moehring, who lives in a building
across from the Embassy, said he heard the
shooting start at about 7 p.m., just as he was
getting ready to watch the evening news on TV
Moehring said he went outside and could
see "tracer bullets" coming from the direction
of the Embassy, and that the shots he saw
appeared to miss the building and came from
the direction of the nearby Rhine River.
Bush plan would improve transit
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Bush
yesterday unveiled a $105 billion, five-year
program to "prepare for the next American
century" in U.S. transportation by improving
highways and mass transit systems and
revamping transportation spending.
The plan envisions using private enterprise
to help refurbish roads and bridges and would
use tolls and user fees to help pay the costs. It
would give states and cities more flexibility in
spending transportation dollars — allowing
them to choose whether to spend federal dol
lars on highways or mass transit systems.
The plan released by Transportation Secre
tary Samuel Skinner yesterday includes
increases over five years of 39 percent in high
way funding to $20.3 billion; and 25 percent in
mass transit to $2.9 billion.
