UNITED NATIONS (AP) -
Despite furious calls for open
debate on the Gulf war and the
hundreds of civilian deaths it is
causing, the Security Council
voted yesterday to hold its first
formal session on the conflict
behind closed doors.
The non-televised debate today
will be the first formal council ses
sion held in private since a
November 1975 debate on the
Western Sahara.
The vote to close the meeting
was 9-2, with four abstentions. It
was taken after a public session of
the 15-member council that
included speeches by a dozen
nations.
Voting for a closed meeting

were four permanent members —
the United States, Britain, France
and the Soviet Union — and Aus
tria, Belgium, Ivory Coast, Roma
nia and Zaire.
Cuba and Yemen voted against
closure, saying it was wrong for a
democratic organization like the
United Nations to conceal its
deliberations on the most impor
tant issue of the day.
China, Ecuador, India and Zim
babwe abstained.
The U.S. government said an
open meeting could give Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein the
impression the coalition was
divided and retreating from its
demand for Iraqi withdrawal from
Kuwait.
