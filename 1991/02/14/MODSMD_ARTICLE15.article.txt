# Witnesses in Mandela trial refuse to testify

JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP)
— Two key state witnesses said they feared
reprisals and refused yesterday to testify
against Winnie Mandela, dealing a severe
blow to the prosecution's case.
Kenneth Kgase and Tabiso Mono
appeared in the Rand Supreme Court but
their refusal to give evidence left the state
without its main witnesses in the trial
against Mrs. Mandela, wife of African
National Congress leader Nelson Mandela.
She and three others have been charged
with four counts each of kidnapping and
assault.
Prosecutor Jan Swanepoel said the
state's case was based on the testimony of
Kgase, Mono and Gabriel Mekgwe, three of
the four young men allegedly abducted and
beaten at Mrs. Mandela's Soweto home in
December 1988. The fourth, 14-year-old
Stompie Seipei, was found dead in a field a
week later.
Mekgwe disappeared Sunday. Swanepoel
said he was kidnapped, and Kgase and
Mono said they fear for their own lives.
The South African Press Association
reported that a man claiming to be Mekgwe
called the news agency yesterday night and

denied he was kidnapped. The caller said he
was in Harare, Zimbabwe, and left South
Africa voluntarily to avoid testifying
against Mrs. Mandela and other ANC mem
bers, SAPA reported.
"As someone involved in the (anti
apartheid) struggle and as a member of the
ANC Youth League, I cannot betray my
comrades," SAPA quoted the man as say
ing. It said a SAPA reporter familiar with
Mekgwe said the caller's voice was similar
to the missing witness*.
The caller said he did not feel safe in
South Africa because he knew he could be
detained for refusing to testify, SAPA said.
Kgase and Mono could receive up to two
years in prison for refusing to testify, but
Kgase said he preferred that to possible
physical harm.
"I really like my life, I want my life,"
Kgase said.
Kgase'a lawyer, Paul Kennedy, said his
client had been prepared to testify until the
disappearance of Mekgwe. He argued that
his client should not be imprisoned because
the case was extraordinary, with Kgase fac
ing possible recrimination long after its
completion.
