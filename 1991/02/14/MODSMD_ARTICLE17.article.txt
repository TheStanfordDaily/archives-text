## Tear down the houses 
### 
Old traditions might
be lost, but students
gain new dormitories

THE UNIVERSITY IS correct
in its decision to raze the
earthquake-damaged Row
houses in order to build faculty
housing, and should not give in to
any pressures to reverse the deci
sion.
As could have been expected, the
decision has been met with opposi
tion from students who were dis
placed from those houses, and an
unexpected request that at least
one of the new buildings house a
fraternity.
Admittedly, the decision is a
regrettable one. Three houses with
long histories and many traditions
will be lost, but the University will
take a big step toward the con
struction of new dormitories that
will create four years of guaranteed
student housing.
The allegation that there is a
conspiracy against co-operatives is
completely unfounded. This deci
sion to replace the earthquake
damaged houses with faculty hous
ing is purely economic in nature.
The University will earn $2.8 mil
lion that will go into the construc
tion of new student housing.
The charge has been made that
the displaced students should have
been consulted before the decision.
Maybe this is the case, but it would
not and should not have changed
the decision. Consultation with the
students would have been, and still
would be, a face-saving measure
that would be ultimately meaning
less.
Unfortunately, the choice has to
be made between the 100-year his
tories of these houses and the need
for money. The University now is
in a period where budgets are

tight. Now it is time to find the
ways in which new sources of
income can be created.
This, unfortunately, is such a
way.
The future of co-ops is not in
doubt. They are not endangered
species. Living in a co-op is a valu
able experience, and the continua
tion of the co-ops should be a high
priority of the University.
The displaced students, after all,
are not losing their housing,
though they will lose the specific
houses in which they have estab
lished their traditions. Phi Psi
turned the old AD House into the
Enchanted Broccoli Forest, while
the Delta Tau Deltas took over 553
Mayfield (not a bad exchange) and
Synergy took Grove-Lasuen and
Grove-May field.
Although this decision is pri
marily economic, the University
should not abandon its sense of fair
play in its search for income. One
of the fraternities that has been
searching for on-campus housing
has announced that it would put in
a bid for the new houses.
Since the University has decided
that the new housing will be fac
ulty housing, they should stick to
that, even if the fraternity offers a
higher bid.
Taking a house from a group of
students and giving it to another
because the other group has more
cash on hand sets a dangerous
precedent. It sends the message
that members of a fraternity are
somehow more valuable than resi
dents of Synergy because they are
wealthier and have a national orga
nization and rich alumni to back
them.
The University should stick to
its original decision, conceding nei
ther to the displaced students nor
to the fraternities, so that Stanford
students can finally get the four
years of guaranteed housing that
have been promised to them for so
long.
