## Dying in 'honor' 
### 
I GREW UP WITH A FEW OF THE
soldiers that are now in the Persian
Gulf. They are men and women now,
but that is not the way I remember them.
They are the boys and girls that I grew up
with, memories from a long time ago.
I can't really call them friends because
they aren't anymore. Actually, I haven't
seen any of them since I've been at Stan
ford, but we went our separate ways long
before I arrived here. I was college-bound
since junior high, at least, and they defi
nitely weren't. In all honesty, I didn't
really like them during high school.
They were troublemakers of sorts.
They hung out with the rowdy kids. For
the most part, they didn't do very well in
school, and they were never college
bound. After high school, the military was
one of the few options available to them.
I remember arguing with them about
that. Young radical that I was, I would
often tell them, "You know that if there is
ever a war you will be the first to go and
the first to die." I would make passionate
statements about how many Chicanos
died in Vietnam.
I sometimes really regret ever having
said it — especially over winter break, as
the television news constantly flashed
pictures of young soldiers sailing away to
the conflict zone. My mother kept
reminding me that so-and-so's daughter
or son was in the Persian Gulf, or on their
way there.
I was, and am, full of anger, guilt and
sadness. Images of the soldiers as boys
still haunt my memory, repeating the war
rhetoric, full of patriotic pride.
I regret having believed that I knew

what was better for them.
Who am I, after all, to tell them what
to do with their lives, what causes to
believe in? But I cared, and still care,
about their lives.
I don't want them to die so that I can
say, "I told you so."
I read in The New York Times that 60
percent of the soldiers in the front line are
people of color, and that there are more
soldiers from Watts and East Los Angeles
in the Gulf than there are from Kuwait. I
wish the statistics would surprise me, but
they don't. So many people that I used to
know are there now and so many of my
mother's friends have sons and daughters
there.
I don't want to argue, like some people
do, that these men and women don't want
to be there. Most of them do. They are
writing letters that tell how glorious it
would be to die for a just cause. I would
feel very strange speaking for them, or in
spite of them.
But for me, the issue is more compli
cated than that.
It has much to do with racism and the
lack of opportunities that push men and
women from impoverished backgrounds
and people of color into the "volunteer
army." The military runs slick ads entic
ing them into the military and promising
more than they can deliver.
For a person with limited opportuni
ties, going into the military is better than
waiting for a job that never comes.
Their lives shouldn't be expendable.
The government spends little to educate
these people or to provide them with
other opportunities.

It does spend a lot of money, time and
energy recruiting them for the military.
When George Bush was campaigning
for the presidency, he visited my high
school. Bush told the students that it was
OK if they didn't go to college because we
need somebody to do the "hard labor" in
our society anyway.
He later retracted that statement, and
apologized. He didn't mean to say that
they "shouldn't" go to college, he
explained, but only wanted to let them
know that menial jobs are just as honor
able. I am sure that the army is just the
kind of honorable job he was referring to.
I am also sure that he would never
have said this to a class of graduating stu
dents from Phillips Andover Academy, his
alma mater. It wouldn't have made sense.
They are the future leaders of this society,
the future thinkers, the future presi
dents.
The kids from Garfield High School
will be the ones that fill the honorable
jobs in the warehouses and factories, and
like other people of color and poor whites,
will die "honorably" in droves for their
country.
It angers me that President Bush, and
many other people, don't feel guilty about
that.
