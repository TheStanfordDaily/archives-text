# Unity 'bridges gaps' through broader goals
## 
### Marci Shore 
A group of Stanford students, faculty and staff
are in the process of organizing a local committee as
part of a new national coalition dedicated to progres
sive change in the United States.
Known as Unity, the organization hopes to pro
mote "fundamental change in [the U.S.] policy sys
tem," said sophomore Adriana Martinez, who is
helping introduce the coalition to the Stanford cam
pus.
Martinez said Unity values "true multicultural
ism" — minority groups working together with
mainstream white people who favor progressive
change.
The group is named for and is forming around
Unity newspaper, an Oakland-based socialist news
paper that has been active since 1978. In an article in
its January issue titled, "A call to build an organiza
tion for the 1990s and beyond," the newspaper urged
the creation of a new, broad-based coalition that
would "meet the new challenges of our day."
Among the more than 100 people who signed the
article are several affiliated with Stanford, including
Black Community Service Center Director Keith
Archuleta, ASSU senators David Brown and Mae
Lee and Council of Presidents member Ingrid Nava.
Brown has been a Stanford distributor of Unity
newspaper for the past three years. Recently, he said
he has played an active role getting students
involved in the local committee.
About 35 Stanford students are now forming the
local committee, which is intended to focus primarily
on educational rights issues. Local Unity groups at
other California campuses have initiated a lobbying
effort against planned 40 percent to 60 percent
tuition increases at University of California schools,
Martinez said.
Unity newspaper, when founded, was the newspa
per of the League of Revolutionary Struggle, a
national Marxist-Leninist organization. The League
announced Sept. 7 that it had dis
solved after a period of internal
self-evaluation.
The Unity coalition aims to
create a universal forum, both
culturally and politically, organiz
ers said.
Archuleta, an active partici
pant in the local Unity organizing
committee, said the group plans

to provide "a way that all these
particular groups can link to
broader issues."
Organizers said Unity hopes
to provide a forum for diverse
opinions, to conduct fact-finding
research, and to lobby on issues
such as the Persian Gulf war, the
draft, the peace dividend, poverty,
homelessness, education and
racism.
Archuleta, who is a member of
the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People
and Jesse Jackson's Rainbow

Coalition, said he sees Unity as
having a broader perspective than
other political organizations.
"We have all these lines that
divide us," Archuleta said. While
it remains important for women
to join with women and blacks to
join with blacks in exploring their
needs and goals, an organization
such as Unity has the potential to
"bridge a lot gaps," he added.
There exists a great opportu
nity to educate a broader group
on issues affecting different
groups, Archuleta said.
