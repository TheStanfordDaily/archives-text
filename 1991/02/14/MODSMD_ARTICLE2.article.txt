A group of Stanford students, faculty and staff
are in the process of organizing a local committee as
part of a new national coalition dedicated to progres
sive change in the United States.
Known as Unity, the organization hopes to pro

helping introduce the coalition to the Stanford cam

Martinez said Unity values "true multicultural
ism" â€” minority groups working together with
mainstream white people who favor progressive
change.
The group is named for and is forming around
Unity newspaper, an Oakland-based socialist news
paper that has been active since 1978. In an article in
its January issue titled, "A call to build an organiza

the creation of a new, broad-based coalition that
would "meet the new challenges of our day."
Among the more than 100 people who signed the
article are several affiliated with Stanford, including
Black Community Service Center Director Keith
Archuleta, ASSU senators David Brown and Mae
Lee and Council of Presidents member Ingrid Nava.
Brown has been a Stanford distributor of Unity
newspaper for the past three years. Recently, he said
he has played an active role getting students
involved in the local committee.
About 35 Stanford students are now forming the
local committee, which is intended to focus primarily
on educational rights issues. Local Unity groups at
other California campuses have initiated a lobbying
effort against planned 40 percent to 60 percent
tuition increases at University of California schools,
Martinez said.
Unity newspaper, when founded, was the newspa
per of the League of Revolutionary Struggle, a
national Marxist-Leninist organization. The League
