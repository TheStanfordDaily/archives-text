## Israel is only undoing Arab repression, colonialism 
### 
IN ONE OF THE DISCUSSIONS of
the teach-in on the Gulf crisis, a for
eign student asked why the Arabs
could not have their days of conquest
and colonialism now, as the French and
the British had theirs in the last century.
A Stanford student displaying this
lack of historical perspective makes one
fear democracy — the rule of the masses
fed on propaganda.
Some 1,300 years ago, the Arabs over
ran the Middle East, North Africa,
Spain, Persia and India; very seldom
have I heard this called imperialism or
colonialism.
However, regarding how little is left of
the culture of the original inhabitants of
the present-day Arab countries, I would
have to say that the Arabs have done a
far more thorough job at making these
lands their own than the Europeans
even attempted to do in their African
and Asian colonies.
One of the few groups surviving the
Arab onslaught, the Jews, were third
rate citizens of the Arab world at best.
Mohammed had some 600 to 900
Medina Jews killed; in the Koran he pre
scribed the way to treat Jews, "Make
war upon those who have been given the
Scripture . . . but follow not the religion
of truth, until they pay the tribute read

ily, being brought low." In other words,
make Jews and Christians pay for their
religion through humiliation and special
taxes.
Later Muslim rulers sometimes pro
tected the Jews, but they were still often
victim to pillage and plunder, expulsions
("transfers") and killings. The Jews'
bearing arms was outlawed, even talking
back to Muslims was forbidden.
Professions were closed to Jews; many
synagogues were desecrated and
destroyed and new construction was for
bidden. In the 19505, Jerusalem's Wail
ing Wall was turned into a garbage dump
by the Jordanian authorities. (As a non
believer I would not bring this up if the
Muslims themselves did not show an
extreme sensitivity over their own holy
places.)
Jewish orphans — which were actu
ally children without fathers — were
taken from their mothers to be raised as
Muslims, and stoning of Jews certainly
did not begin with the Intifada.
So when the state of Israel came into
being by a U.N. resolution (still not rec
ognized by the Arab nations), the Jews of
the Arab world did what any oppressed
minority attempts to do: They went to
their national home, to be their own
masters.

Some anti-Zionists claim that the
Arab Jews were tricked into leaving their
old homes and that they still curse the
day they left the friendly Arabs. Yasir
Arafat once said he wanted to liberate
the Jews from Zionism, but does not

It is sad that the Palestini
ans have to pay for the

keeping the Jews down.

their massively voting Likud clearly
show their opinion on their former
hosts?
An Arab apologist once said the Pales
tinians are treated by the Israelis like
blacks were dealt with treated in the
deep South, but that blacks would not
take being treated like that lying down; I
think a more apt parallel is to look at
how the Arabs treated the Jews, and
even then the comparison tilts favorably
towards the Israelis.
Consider, for instance, how the Arab
authorities handle protesters.

About three years ago, when four or
five months of Intifada had claimed
fewer than 200 Palestinian lives, the
Algerian army killed over 200 Arab
demonstrators in just one weekend. Two
months ago in Morocco, another 100
protesters died violently, and the Syrian
army quelled the 1982 Hama uprising by
killing 25,000.
Have their voices been heard in the
chambers of the U.N. Security Council?
Arafat has sadly been gaining sympa
thy and support all over the world by his
false portrayal of Israel as another West
ern colonial power, a latter-day Crusader
state. He also used to say the Jews of
Israel were a European problem. As the
number of Jews who came to Israel from
the Arab world was about the same as
the number of Palestinian Arabs who
fled or were driven from Israel, the
exchange confirmed Israel's right to
exist and validated its claim to the terri
tory.
It is sad that the Palestinians have to
pay for the Arabs' 1,300 years of keeping
the Jews down, and in peace they
deserve our help, but I would say their
resettlement is basically an Arab prob
lem.
