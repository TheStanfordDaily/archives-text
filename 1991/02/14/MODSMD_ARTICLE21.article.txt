# Iron-pumper challenges columnist's blatant stereotypes
## 
### 
ONCE AGAIN, BLATANT stereo
typing has found its way onto the
pages of The Daily.
I refer, of course, to Chris Harris'
recent portrayal of the Stanford weight
training community. A friend read me
the column, and I was saddened to hear
what all those big words meant. Sad
dened, but not shocked, as the caricature
of an overgrown imbecile is one that
intrudes daily into the lives of the
pumped-up.

Harris' article perpetuates the igno
rance behind the stereotype. Far from
being very big and very stupid, most of
those who work out at Encina Gym are
of average height.
And as for the suggestion that weight
lifters get all the women, I would point
out that several of us are engineering
students.
I suspect that Harris has never fully
considered the difficulties facing a
weight lifter in a "girlyman's" world: the

impossibility of buying clothes off the
rack, the constant danger of a muscle
spasm crushing an innocent bystander,
the embarrassment of accidentally rip
ping doors off their hinges.
For too long we have responded only
with silence, or at best with monosyllabic
grunts; it is time for the muscularly dis
advantaged to be heard.
Unfortunately, squeezing Harris' head
between my hands like an overripe
mango is, at best, a limited response.

I therefore implore the administration
to work with us towards solving this
problem on a larger scale. The addition
of "Arnold: How I Got Real Big" to the
CIV core list would be a good start.
Such actions alone cannot remove the
biases of the flabby mtyority, but they
would at least show that Stanford is
truly committed to fighting the scourge
of flexism.
