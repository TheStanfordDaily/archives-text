## Freaky D's above-rim 0 isn't the sole reason he gets PT 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
The play starts innocently
enough, as point guard John
Patrick dribbles the ball past mid
court. Right before Patrick
reaches the top of the key, Andrew
Vlahov flashes from the paint,
comes out to the right wing and
takes a short pass. Just another
play.
A slight rumbling comes from
the crowd, though, as a few fans
realize what's about to happen.
While they've been watching
Patrick, Deshon Wingate has
waited, patiently, on the left side
of the floor. Now, as the ball goes
from Patrick to Vlahov, center
Adam Keefe comes screaming
from the low post to lay a hella
cious pick on the defender guard
ing Wingate. A few more fans
start to realize what's up.
Wingate's defender is toast.
Vlahov turns, knows that Keefe's
pick is perfect, and fires what
looks like a shot from beyond the
three-point line. Wingate, all
alone now, takes three steps
toward the hoop and vaults into
the stratosphere. "Hey, was that a
shot or. ..."
The ball heads for the hoop, a
pair of outstretched arms fly into
the picture ... and suddenly the

rock is own its way down.
Pandemonium.
The Lob, unfortunately, hasn't
made an appearance since the
Stanford-Arizona game three
weeks ago.
Vlahov has been watching from
the sidelines ever since due to a
season-ending ankle injury, and
that means that during the last
six games the air mail hasn't been
delivered on time.
"We haven't run it, (but) we're
working on something," Wingate
says. "Andrew was so accustomed
to just turning and throwing
every night, whereas these new
guys at that position aren't accus
tomed to it."
Vlahov was used to it because
he and Wingate had run the Lob
for almost two whole seasons.
Now, however, with Vlahov's pass
ing, scoring and rebounding gone,
the rest of the team has had to
turn its play up a notch — includ
ing Wingate.
"I'm definitely trying to be
more involved, (but) whether or
not that shows up in the stats is
kind of hard to say," says Wingate,
who's averaging 9.6 points and 6.5
rebounds per game this season. "I
think that I'm one of the key
pieces in the game in terms of
leadership and calming my team
mates down, making sure they

run the right plays. I get on them
about defense, I bring the huddle
together, and try to give them
confidence.
"I'm definitely trying to pick us
up in more than one or two ways:
I try to give (Jim) Morgan a little
more confidence in his shot, so I
pass him the ball a little bit, (and)
Keefe and I are doing pretty well
with passing the ball and passing
right back, that sort of thing."
Wingate picked the team up
more than a little the week after
Vlahov went out: Playing against
Oregon, he scored a career-high
23 points and added a career-high
14 rebounds. In the Cardinal's
last four games, Wingate has aver
aged 11.5 points and nine boards a
contest.
Even with all the little things
and the occasional scoring spurts,
though, it's still the dunks — off
drives, off rebounds or off The
Lob — that get the fifth-year
senior noticed. Everyone who
wants to talk skywalking talks to
Wingate.
Well, almost everyone. "Did
Deshon tell you that he goes to
bed at night and dreams of my
athletic ability?" interrupts Keefe,
who for some reason has never
been nominated for Leaper of the
Year.
"Adam, did you get paid to say
that?" Wingate asks.
"He dreams of being able to
jump like me," Keefe deadpans.
Dubious. At best.
Wingate seems to be getting
along just fine with his own abil
ity, thank you. "I do like doing
spectacular things," he says, "but
I also enjoy taking charges — well,
I don't really enjoy them, but I
don't mind doing it — taking
charges, getting after loose balls,
something like that, or playing
good defense. I really feel good
when my man doesn't score."
Still, it isn't defense that got
Freaky D his cherished nickname
— it was his penchant, every now
and then, to pull off something
ridiculously spectacular. Well,
actually, that's the /or-the-record
explanation. Off the record?
"I don't know if I can tell you,"
Wingate says, mock-seriously. "It
might be too scandalous." (Look,
if you really want to know, ask
him yourself.)

Anyway, what's that for-tne
record story behind the name?
"My freshman year after practice
we were having a mini-dunk con
test," says Wingate. "I was doing
some dunks that I guess were
pretty amazing, and I think it was
(then-guard) Oliver Cunningham
that coined the phrase Freaky D."
Whatever. The name stuck —
"It's a nickname I like," he says.
"All my friends call me Freaky" —
and, as the seasons went by, the
dunks multiplied and the jaws
continued to drop.
"I wish I had his jumping abil
ity," Keefe says. "That's some
thing that would put my game on
a completely different level, as far
as playing above the rim."
Keefe's current level would
probably be fine for just about
anyone else — after all, he aver
ages 21.2 points and 9.8 boards a
night. Still, though, he probably
wouldn't mind being able to jump
through the roof every now and
then.
So, Deshon, how high can you
jump?
"I don't really know," Wingate
says."I think [my vertical's]
about 30 or 31 inches."
Let's see . . . 6-foot-7 plus
about two and a half feet for the
arm — oh heck, let's say almost
three feet (the Wingate Wingspan
is longer than the average bear's)
— equals nine feet seven inches
plus 30 inches, which gets us to. .
. about 12 feet.
Hold up. Only 12 feet? How
high can you get up on the back
board?
A smile. "We 11... ."
"We don't know," Keefe inter
rupts again. "It only goes up to 15
feet."
A sage nod. "That's true. That
is true," Wingate says."It only
goes up to 15 feet."
Cut the clowning. How high?
"I'm sure I can get the top of
the square," Wingate says.
(Rumor has it Wingate's elbows
have hit the top of the square.) "I
can get up there pretty high."
All right. Fine. We'll settle for
"pretty high."
And yet . . . "Last year against
Washington," Keefe says,
"[Wingate] took a lob pass and
dunked over Dion Brown, who's
one of the best leapers in the Pac

10." Brown is only 6-5, but he
spends most games floating over
the rim.
"Things just kind of run
together," Keefe says."I just
think of the 360-degree dunks he
does whenever he feels like it."
"I do like doing spectacular
things," Wingate says."I like to
dunk, I like to dunk on people, I
like to drive and dunk . . . espe
cially with people in my face."
Still, it's the other things that

Wingate does — defense, settling
others down, hitting the medium
range jumper — that help the
team the most. And, as the Cardi
nal continues to adjust to its new
cast, Freaky D may have to sacri
fice a few spectacular dunks to
concentrate on other duties.
"I think we are becoming more
comfortable with one another,"
Wingate says. "There's so many
people being used now it's more of
a team effort than not."


Tracy Allen — Daily fite
To the casual Stanford hoops fan, Deshon Wlngate is simply the dude
who skies for two-handed, In-your-face, monster jams. But Wlngate
has made tremendous improvements in all facets of his game while
on the Farm and is shooting for a fourth consecutive postseason
berth.
