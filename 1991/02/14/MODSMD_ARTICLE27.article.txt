# Women golfers finish ninth
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Staff writer 
While consistency has been an
asset to the Stanford women's golf
team in the past, this week it
meant ninth place.
"All of us were a little disap
pointed in the results," said Adele
Moore, "It does give us a start on
what we need to work on."
For the third straight day at
the Domino's Pizza/Chris John

son Invitational, the Cardinal
linksters finished the round in
ninth. The team scored a 310 yes
terday, 18 shots behind UCLA's
292.
Having the best score of the
round for the second day in a row
at the Randolph Park North
Course was not enough for the
Bruins to unseat leader and host
Arizona. The Wildcats shot a
three-round total 883 to win their
third invitational of the season,

with the other two coming at Ore
gon and Stanford.
Second-ranked Arizona was led
by individual champion Mette
Hageman. Consistency typified
the senior's play as she scored a
one-over-par 73 to add to her two
even-par scores in previous
rounds.
The 73 was enough to over
come second-round leader Debbie
Koyama of UCLA. Koyama's 76
placed her two shots behind Hage
man. Finishing in third place was
New Mexico State's Jane Egan.
UCLA's Laree Suggs finished in
fourth place.
"It was one of the better tour
naments of the year. A lot of top
teams were there," said Moore.
Audrey Wooding was Stan
ford's strongest finisher. She shot
an even-par 72 to jump into an
eighth-place tie with Arizona's
Debbie Parks at 224. Over the
three-day tournament Wooding
steadily lowered her scores each
round. On Monday she shot a 77
and added a 75 Tuesday.
Unfortunately for the Cardi
nal, no one else was able to crack
the top 10. Adele Moore shot a
third-round 74 to finish in 43rd
place.
Last year's fourth-place fin
isher, Stanford's Jodi Figley,
scored 80 to tie Moore at 235.
Stephanie Davis finished with a
238 total after a third round 84.
Melinda Daniels shot an 86 yes
terday to finish at 268.
