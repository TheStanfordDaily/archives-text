Dear Editor:
I am writing in response to
David Hirning's column last
Thursday ("Women worthy of
watching," The Stanford Daily,
2/7/91). Mr. Hirning is exactly
right: Stanford women's basket
bsl is very worthy of our atten
tion. In fact, this team is simply
awesome and it is disappointing
that The Daily cannot come up
with the money to send a writer
on the road to cover Pac-10 away
games. However, Hirning's col
umn may be misleading to his tar
geted audience.
Hirning is addressing those
hoops fans who inexplicably shun
women's basketball games. When
Hirning quotes a KZSU broad
caster as saying "I hate women's
basketball," he may be leading his
readers to believe that KZSU does

not care about women's basket
ball either.
In fact, KZSU cares more about
Stanford women's basketball than
any other newspaper, radio or
television station in the entire Bay
Area. To date, the Stanford
Women's Basketball Team has
played 21 games, and KZSU has
been courtside for a total of 19 of
those games ... to help with the
math, this means that KZSU has
missed a grand total of two games
all year — and we will not miss
another.
It would not surprise me if
Hirning wrote his stories about
the two games played in Arizona
two weeks ago after having lis
tened to the KZSU broadcasts.
He, no doubt, like many of the
women's hoops fans in the area,
was delighted to be able to follow

the team on the road.
I agree with Hirning that
women's basketball is extremely
exciting and also wish that Maples
would fill up more often for the
women's games. But let me reiter
ate that three years ago KZSU
made a commitment to Stanford
women's basketball and we will
continue to broadcast their games
live throughout the 1991 season
and beyond.
I certainly hope that The Daily
will be able to "find the money" to
send Hirning to the NCAA region
al and, with a little luck, the
Final Four. Fear not, however, for
if he can't be there, Hirning will
write his story based on the game
he listens to on 90.1 FM, KZSU.
