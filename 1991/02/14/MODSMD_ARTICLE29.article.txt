# Perfection isn't always best
## 
### 
In the course of my busy day, I am frequently
asked tough questions about the crazy world
of sports. One query that keeps coming up is,
"Will the women's tennis team here at Stanford
ever lose again?"
To this I answer, "I sure hope so," which usu
ally throws them just long enough for me to make
my escape into the swirling mists.
If there's one universal truth about sports in
my book, it's that perfection is boring. Nothing
particularly against the Cardinal women netters
or the Runnin' Rebels of UNLY but could you just
drop a few, please? One? We're all falling asleep
here.

Is this starting to sound familiar to you: "The
No. 1-ranked in the universe Cardinal women's
tennis team won another match yesterday by the
score of — you'll never guess — 9-0. This time,
one Cardinal actually dropped a game. Still, Stan
ford needed only 14 minutes to dispatch its oppo
nent which, in an exciting development, sacrificed
a Prince racket to Apollo before the match in
hopes of lessening the slaughter."
I don't think I've been to a women's tennis
match in my four years here. It's not that I don't
like tennis; I used to watch the Martina-Chrissy
battles every year at the French Open and Wim
bledon. But I just can't get a charge out of our
obviously superior players crushing someone 6-0,
6-0.
This team has won five straight national titles,
and decided to give up losing in my freshman year.
At least the men's team drops a few conference
matches once in awhile.
It is partially for the same reason that I hate
the 49ers and the A's. Ya gotta hate a team that
begins the season stating they'll consider it "a
failure" if they don't win the Super Bowl or World
Series. Thanks for the dramatic buildup, guys.
It's this kind of attitude that makes winning
breed contempt.
Case in point: My freshman year, I interviewed
Patrick McEnroe and asked him about winning
the NCAA team tennis title, about what a big
achievement it is. I'll never forget what he said.
"Teams like tennis and swimming win so much
here that people just come to expect it,"he said. "I
think the only time people notice is when we don't
win the title, and then they go 'What happened?'"
Which is exactly what is happening to the Stan
ford women's basketball team. After cementing
its claim to greatness and near-perfection with a
32-1 season and an NCAA title last year, it began
to experience the fallout. Three early-season road
losses (two to No. 4-ranked Tennessee) had the
casual fans and detractors muttering, "What's

going on? Jeez, how pathetic."
Then, the unspeakable occured: Stanford lost
at home. I could've sworn I saw fans in Stanford
sweatshirts running around yelling, "Is it the
Apocalypse?! Is it the end?!"
So the Cardinal lost in Maples (on a buzzer
beater) after 42 straight wins. So what? As coach
Tara VanDerveer said a few days later, "I'm kind
of glad it (the streak) is over. People will learn that
they just can't show up and win every night."
Any coach will tell you that winning is great,
but you don't learn a lot from it. Try telling
a team (as Frank Brennan must every day)
that hasn't lost in three years, "OK, now, we
really have to improve! I mean it!" Giggles all
around.
In a sense, some parity is essential — not only
for the health of the sport, but for a team to real
ize its true abilities. Last year, the Cardinal
women's basketball team used that one loss to
refocus itself and commit to doing what it took to
win the championship. They never lost again that
season.
Val Whiting may have put this year in perspec
tive after the loss to Washington. "Sometimes I
think that we're so close to going all the way
again," she said. "It's just the little things that we
have to do."
Last Sunday, I arose at 9 a.m. to watch what
was being billed as the Game of the Decade in col
lege basketball: No. 2 Arkansas versus No. 1 (and
Undisputed Heavyweight Champion of the Hoops
World) UNLV Despite playing on the Razorbacks'
home floor, UNLV, of course, won going away.
The really funny thing was, Arkansas led by
four at the half. Feverish with hope that perhaps
the NCAA tournament would be worth watching
this year, I leaped off the sofa — and went back to
bed.
Somehow, I knew, and I didn't want to stick
around for the inevitable 52-25 Running Rebel
streak (with a paltry 71.3 shooting percentage
from the field) that turned that ominous four
point advantage into a 23-point embarassment.
This is a team that ruined last year's final by
beating Duke by 30 points. How depressing. Give
me North Carolina State over Houston or Vil
lanova over Georgetown any day.
After the game, CBS interviewed Razorback
coach Nolan Richardson, and he just shrugged
and — I swear he actually said this — dead
panned, "We were just fortunate to stay for so
long with a team that can compete with most
NBA clubs." Hey, at least he was honest.
So what's the big, crazy mystery this year
about the Pac-10 men's basketball league, where
on any given night the last-place team can — and
has, handily — beat the top team. To me, it simply
shows that the league is getting better, tougher.
Gone are the 17-1 seasons of domination by the
Arizona Wildcats — another team I've grown to
love to hate.
It's been going on in the ACC and Big East for
years, where the league beats up on each other all
season and then goes out and sends four teams to
the Sweet 16. Losing is good for you.
Try and figure that logic out, sports fans.
