# Rent increase forces Woolworth to leave
## 
### Jon Gifford Staff writer 
The red- and gold-lettered facade of the F.W.
Woolworth Co. has stood at the Stanford Shop
ping Center for the past 35 years.
But after the store's lease expires at the end
of this April, the store will close, a Woolworth
spokesman confirmed last week.
The closing has led some to criticize the
shopping center for becoming too upscale,
with too many smaller, more profitable stores
catering to an increasingly woalthy and
diverse clientele. In the process, some say, less
expensive stores have been forced to move
away.
"The store is closing because the shopping
center is charging a very high rent, much
higher than the store could afford to pay and
operate profitably," said Barry Thomson,
spokesperson for its parent company, New
York-based Woolworth Corporation.
Shopping Center Director David Longbine
said one reason for the increase in the lease
price is the need to attract stores with a higher
sales productivity, which in turn generates
more profit for the center.
"Woolworth's sales productivity was below
the mall's average. ... A select grouping of
customers that are loyal to the store does not
necessarily correspond to profitable sales pro
ductivity in 1991 dollars," Longbine said.
Thomson said Woolworth negotiated with
shopping center officials for a lease at a
smaller location there, but "their offers made
it impossible for us to stay."

sad to see Woolworth go. Most affected are stu
dents and the elderly, who say they will have
fewer alternatives for inexpensive home and
school supplies.
"It's terrible. It's a shame to see it go, since
I've been shopping here for the past 10 years,"
said Connie Larsen, a San Mateo resident who
frequents the store.
Some students are also upset with the
news. "Where else can I go for school supplies,
except the Bookstore, which is far too expen
sive?" asked one freshman.
"It's disappointing and sad to see the store
go, but what can I do about it? I don't think
it's fair because we're not in financial trou
bles," said Gloria, an employee who has
worked at the store for the past 19 years.
Despite the current recession, Woolworth
officials say the company has not hit hard
times. After a restructuring in the early 1980s,
the company has nearly doubled its annual
earnings, from $66 million in 1982 to $122
million in 1990, Thomson said.

In a letter to Longbine, Mary Navarro, a
Menlo Park resident, wrote that "by catering
principally to an expensive clientele, the Stan
ford Shopping Center administration is com
mitting an insidious form of 'class discrimina
tion.' As a result, the mid- and. low-income
community can no longer afford to shop
there."
A Woolworth employee, who wished to
remain anonymous, agreed. "A lot of cus
tomers are really disappointed. There's a
rumor about another boutique moving in —
one more boutique you don't need. It's obvious
[the center doesn'tl want us here," he said.
Longbine said the Stanford Shopping Cen
ter is one of the most profitable shopping malls
in the nation with a 5 percent increase in sales
over the previous year. That figure is two
times the national average for shopping cen
ters.
"In order to stay on top, we need to be on
top of the retail trends of the [19905] and stay
in tune with the needs of the Peninsula shop
per," Longbine said. "We are striving for a 'for
ward-fashion' image to stay on top," he said.
"We are looking for a more exciting tenant
[to fill the new vacancyl, one that will serve
the center in a better way in the long run,"
Longbine said.
Longbine, who has been the center's direc
tor for only two months, said he was not
responsible for the lease negotiations that
were made last fall.
"It is typical of large stores to find difficulty
in operating profitably," said Longbine, giving
a possible reason for Woolworth's decision to
leave.
