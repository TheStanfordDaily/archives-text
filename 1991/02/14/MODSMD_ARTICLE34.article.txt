## Dating... at Stanford? 
### June Cohen 
THE S ilk NFORD DAILY'S AMOROUS EK L Y

■ rom the moment we received our copies of
B . "Approaching Stanford," way back in our promis-
I l cuous high school days, we were warned. We pored
M over the bold-faced quotes, accepting them as
truth. Memorizing those pearls of wisdom in hopes of
speeding our assimilation into the Stanford community.
And what did those sages who had already experienced
Stanford leave for us to learn?
"Celibacy is an integral part of life at Stanford."
And, "this University is sexually frustrating." Ml *
It's like the Greek tragedies we read in
(I guess that would be CIV
now) ... we were
told of our
miser
able

fate, yet were powerless to prevent it from coming true.
We at Stanford don't like people to know if we have a
successful social life. By the middle of our freshman year, we
act like we're miserable — even when we aren't — out of
habit, or just to fit in.
So I set out to investigate the dating scene at Stanford. I
asked students to tell me about their best, worst and funni
est dates — not just at Stanford, but anywhere.
And people had stories to tell.
Lots of stories to tell.
But nobody would let me use his or her real name.
Even if they went on the date years ago, at an obscure
school on the other side of the country. Everyone insisted on
anonymity.
And although this article is hindered by my inability to
name sources (all names have been changed to protect the
innocent — or not-so-innocent), I did determine — defini
tively — that Stanford students do indeed date. They may
not date each other, but they do date.

Or at least they did.
And they remember it fondly.
As the Indigo Girls sing, "Every five years or so I look
back on my life, and I have a good laugh."
So sit back and enjoy the past five years in some other
people's lives and have a good laugh — or cry.
Or both.
I did.

• My date and I were driving to a Valentine's Day party in
grade. There was a really heavy snowstorm, and all of
a stukien, the car hit an ice patch and we spun off the road.
fgQur car gpt stuck in a snow bank, so we just sat there for a
BpjfrUc, kind of looking at each other with sophomoric inno
cence, saying, "Hmm, what should we do now?"
■ Then it occurred to us.
So we got out of the car and had a snow
ball fight in the middle of the deserted highway
— which was fun until one of our snowballs
hit a police car cruising down the opposite
side of the road.
The car screeched as it turned
around, and pulled up next to us. The
officer chastised us for being childish
(go figure, at 15) and then called our
parents.
We ended up spending the
night in a hotel room together —
and had our first kiss — until 4
a.m., when both sets of our paren&j
called to ask if we were shasj#||f01
bed, and, (correctly) assijfning
weren't telling the truth whcwfiH
said we weren't, picked us
he hotel, which was an hodMH
iway from home.

/ • Spring quarter, my freshman
year, I invited this guy to the
_ Toyon Boat Dance. I had had an
incredible crush on him since the beginning
of the year, and I finally got up enough courage
to do something about it.
I was totally into this guy, and totally psyched
to be going out with him. We went to the City, had a
romantic dinner at a restaurant on the pier and then went
to the dance. I was wearing this strapless dress, and wheil
we were dancing on the deck, I was cold, so he put his jack
et around me. Then we kissed for the first time.
Very romantic. And it happened at Stanford.

•My date for the
Junior Prom in high
school just wasn't
into the prom thing.
He wore bluaAucs,
cowboy a
tuxedo shirt, aro we
started the night by

going to a Texas Rangers baseball game
with the mayor of my city. We ate hot
dogs for our prom dinner, went to the
prom and decided to go bowling after
wards. It was definitely my strangest date
ever.

• I was at a square dance, my second day
of freshman year at a boarding school.
This guy I had never spoken to before
asked me to dance.
I said, "Um, OK "
Then, five minutes later, he asked me
if I would "go out with him."
I said, "Um, OK."
So, we did go out — for a breath of air
anyway — we walked around the campus
for two hours without saying a single
word to each other. Finally I said
I had to go back to my dorm, and he said
"Well, should we get this over with now?"
I said, "Um, okay."
So we kissed — the most heinous kiss
of my lift-- and I broke up with him the
next day."

• I discovered I was allergic to benzol peroxide during my
junior year in high school,
I had this huge zit on my forehead that I had to get rid
of before my date. So I took half a bottle of benzol peroxide
and rubbed it into my forehead for about 20 minutes. The
spot was a little red when I was leaving for my date that
night, but I didn't think much of it.
Little did I know that by 9 p.m. the rash would spread
across my whole forehead and by the end of the night my
whole face would break out in hives and swell up.
All from one pimple.
Needless to say, I never went out with my date again.

• Dead Week, my freshman year, I had a date with a pretty
flaky, unpredictable guy. I skipped dinner (big sacrifice),
figuring we would go out to eat. Well, he didn't show up
until around 9 p.m. and we ended up eating chocolate cake
and coffee for dinner at the Waverly Cafe in Palo Alto.
Then he asked me if we could continue our date a few
hours later so he could go home and finish a paper. I said
"OK, whatever," and figured this could only happen at Stan
ford.
He called back around 11 p.m. and asked me if I wanted
to go hot-tubbing with him and some people in his dorm. I
said "OK, whatever," resigning myself at this point to a
totally random night.
So, we went to Watercourse Way with three other cou
ples and hot tubbed for a while. Afterwards, we went to the
Creamery, got take-out ice cream, and ate it while making
out on the beach of Lake Lag, which, of course, was just a
big ditch.

• My decision to go to the Viennese Ball came a little late
this year, as I got my tickets only a few days before the
dance.
None of my female friends could go with me, so I decid
ed to ask this woman who was working out in Encina Gym
— about 6 hours before the ball.
I had never seen her before, but she looked cool, so I
asked her. At first she said she didn't have anything to wear,
but then she decided to go with me.
I think I had a better time with her than I would have
with anyone I actually knew.

• My boyfriend and I were both completely drunk in a real
ly seedy bar in in Tijuana. I went to the bathroom (as most
drunk people do), and he followed me inside.
We messed around for around 20 minutes, and then I
followed him into the men's room, where I waited while he
used the facilities. (I was just standing there. Really.)
