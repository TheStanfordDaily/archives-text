# Joel Stein looks for love in all the wrong places on Valentine's Day
## 
### 
SO IT'S VALENTINE'S DAY. So what.
Valentine's Day is one of those Hallmark
invented holidays. My grandmother, for
some reason, always plays along and sends me
a card. To tell you the truth, I've never felt real
comfortable about that.
Every year around this time I'm forced to
ask the question, "What does Feb. 14 do for
me?"
In the old days, the days before I sprouted
hair in undesirable places, the answer was sim
ple: those neat stacks of Heathcliff cards that all
uniformly read 'Joel S.,' as if they might other
wise fall into the hands of one of the other Joels
in my homeroom.
But those days are over now, and I'm forced
to confront the bare facts: Valentine's Day
doesn't increase my odds of getting laid. Not
one bit.
In fact, its only purpose seems to be to give
me an increased number of ways to make a fool
out of myself. Everywhere I turn, some sub
sidiary of Hallmark (they own everything you
know, everything) is trying its best to get me to
spend money to embarrass myself.
Anyway, I decided to do a little research into
this wnole holiday, into this whole love thang.
But where could I look for answers, in this
war-torn world, where the Simpsons represent
familial love and the only living sex guru is a
shriveled, phlegm-infested, German midget?

I decided to start at the wellspring of all
teenage ideals of romance.
Showtime's "After Hours" movie.
But the dorms don't get cable, and my par
ents stopped sending me videocassettes of "The
Hitchhiker" ever since my grades dropped;
hence, my thumb is far from the pulse of Amer
ican morality.
So I went to the Stanford Bookstore, and
sheepishly asked the woman behind the
counter wnere I could get a copy of a Danielle
Steel book.
"Which one you want?" She asked with a
smile.
I picked the one with both the words
"shrouded" and "scintillating" in the title,
appreciating the attempted alliteration.
"What color you want this in?" She was get
ting way too into this.
My confused, almost stupid look prompted

her to show me four glorious pastels 1 could
choose from. She assured me that my choice
would not affect the contents of the book; after
all, this was no "Choose Your Own Adventure."
I breathed a heavy sigh of relief, if not for
myself, for the rest of society.
In my time of desperation, I resorted to my
old research paper pal, "Encyclopedia Britan
nica," and looked up Love: The Evolution Of.
And this is what I learned:
Stage 1: Pond scum — Love first originated
about 12 billion years ago when one amoeba
locked at another amoeba and realized how
ugly it must be.
After hours of therapy ("I am not a spiro
chete, dammit, and I won't be codependent no
morel"), the amoeba realized that there was
nothing else on the planet to have sex with, and
it's puny excuse for a flagellum couldn't reach
anything below its navel. So, it reconsidered its
position on the aforementioned amoeba and
BOOMI Love blossomed.
Stage 2: The '50s — Love then entered the
McCarthy era where one would meet a mem
ber of the opposite sex, wonder what sex would
be like, take a big gamble and get married. This
couple would then move into a small house,
meet other similar-looking couples, in similar
looking small houses and wonder what sex
would be like with them.
Stage 3t The '60s — Love became a more

common, and potentially dangerously vague
term. Venereal disease also became a more
common, potentially dangerously vague term.
This era ended quickly.
Stage 4: The '70s — Women suddenly and
mysterioualy sprouted pointy breasts, causing

You first find love in high school but then you go to
college and realize that you haven t found it. (With a
healthy profit for Hallmark y no doubt.)

love to take an even more confusing path. One
had to purchase love in odd varieties from
places named after Plato, in strange combina
tions of people and non-people. The evolution
of love had, according to the encyclopedia,
been mutated by an abnormally large intake of
hallucinogens and ugly clothes.
Stage 5: Today — The encyclopedia denied
the existence of the '80s, so I moved on to this,
the final stage of love. Love has become a pro
cessed food — not processed cheese food
(After all, can cheese really eat?) — just a
cheesy kind of processed food.
You first find it in high school, but then you
go to college and realize that you haven't found

it. (With a healthy profit for Hallmark, no
doubt.)
You find it again in college, deny it later
(minus several dollars in greeting cards), and
finally find it once more, desperately, in the
workplace, at a convention out of town or at a

sleazy bar with a girl named Bubbles.
And, by then, you realize that this is your
last chance, so, as with every Feb. 13 before, you
rush out to the mall to spend all your money
on candy and flowers and jewelry and luxury
automobiles and small, handcrafted statuettes
of Milton Berle.
And at the bottom of the page were listed
some local stores which carried such quality
merchandise.

SO IT'S VALENTINE'S DAY. So what.
Valentine's Day is one of those Hallmark
invented holidays. My grandmother, for
some reason, always plays along and sends me
a card. To tell you the truth, I've never felt real
comfortable about that.
Every year around this time I'm forced to
ask the question, "What does Feb. 14 do for
me?"
In the old days, the days before I sprouted
hair in undesirable places, the answer was sim
ple: those neat stacks of Heathcliff cards that all
uniformly read 'Joel S.,' as if they might other
wise fall into the hands of one of the other Joels
in my homeroom.
But those days are over now, and I'm forced
to confront the bare facts: Valentine's Day
doesn't increase my odds of getting laid. Not
one bit.
In fact, its only purpose seems to be to give
me an increased number of ways to make a fool
out of myself. Everywhere I turn, some sub
sidiary of Hallmark (they own everything you
know, everything) is trying its best to get me to
spend money to embarrass myself.
Anyway, I decided to do a little research into
this wnole holiday, into this whole love thang.
But where could I look for answers, in this
war-torn world, where the Simpsons represent
familial love and the only living sex guru is a
shriveled, phlegm-infested, German midget?

I decided to start at the wellspring of all
teenage ideals of romance.
Showtime's "After Hours" movie.
But the dorms don't get cable, and my par
ents stopped sending me videocassettes of "The
Hitchhiker" ever since my grades dropped;
hence, my thumb is far from the pulse of Amer
ican morality.
So I went to the Stanford Bookstore, and
sheepishly asked the woman behind the
counter wnere I could get a copy of a Danielle
Steel book.
"Which one you want?" She asked with a
smile.
I picked the one with both the words
"shrouded" and "scintillating" in the title,
appreciating the attempted alliteration.
"What color you want this in?" She was get
ting way too into this.
My confused, almost stupid look prompted

her to show me four glorious pastels 1 could
choose from. She assured me that my choice
would not affect the contents of the book; after
all, this was no "Choose Your Own Adventure."
I breathed a heavy sigh of relief, if not for
myself, for the rest of society.
In my time of desperation, I resorted to my
old research paper pal, "Encyclopedia Britan
nica," and looked up Love: The Evolution Of.
And this is what I learned:
Stage 1: Pond scum — Love first originated
about 12 billion years ago when one amoeba
locked at another amoeba and realized how
ugly it must be.
After hours of therapy ("I am not a spiro
chete, dammit, and I won't be codependent no
morel"), the amoeba realized that there was
nothing else on the planet to have sex with, and
it's puny excuse for a flagellum couldn't reach
anything below its navel. So, it reconsidered its
position on the aforementioned amoeba and
BOOMI Love blossomed.
Stage 2: The '50s — Love then entered the
McCarthy era where one would meet a mem
ber of the opposite sex, wonder what sex would
be like, take a big gamble and get married. This
couple would then move into a small house,
meet other similar-looking couples, in similar
looking small houses and wonder what sex
would be like with them.
Stage 3t The '60s — Love became a more

common, and potentially dangerously vague
term. Venereal disease also became a more
common, potentially dangerously vague term.
This era ended quickly.
Stage 4: The '70s — Women suddenly and
mysterioualy sprouted pointy breasts, causing
