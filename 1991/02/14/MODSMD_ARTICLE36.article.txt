It's Valentine's Day.
Oh joy.
What a rotten holiday. What a stupid, overrated festival of outdated
courtly love and stale Brachs chocolates wrapped in cheesy red foil.
Okay, so we're bitter.
What do you expect?
Here we are, sitting in the 6-by-6-foot Intermission office at 4 a.m., eat
ing chocolate chip cookies (or, in June's case, broken chocolate chip cook
ies, presumably so the calories won't count) and discussing relationships
with Rogo. (What? You don't know Rogo? You should.)
None of us is happy.
And all of our problems are variations on a theme: caring too much
about one ambiguous relationship, not caring at all about several relation
ships, not having a relationship to care about.
Standard stuff. Our solution?
More chocolate chip cookies.
What did you expect, the solution for your dating problems? We're edi
tors, not magicians. What do we know about love? Copy editing we know.
Caffeine, no problem. Courting?
We're clueless.
But we have managed to put together the obligatory Valentine's Day
issue for you. Not quite romance-oriented, the issue might lean slightly
towards the raunchy.
We thought you might enjoy that.
Anyway, the research for most of the articles was less than a chore ...
There's a lot going on this week, and we're having trouble picking
which things we would do, especially because we can't do anything. But
the best approach to surviving Valentine's Day is keeping yourself as busy
as possible, so here are some possibilities.
First of all, we would recommend seeing the original musical, "One
Bad Apple" in Dinkelspiel Auditorium. It opens tonight and runs through
Saturday, and since June is in it, at least one-half of us will be there each
night. Try not to cry when Ben and Kathye sing "You are the Only One for
Me." They really mean it.
Mixed Company's annual "Love Sucks" show will also be performed on
Valentine's Day, in the Roble Hall lounge. We won't plug Jeanette again this
week, Liz, but we will tell everyone to be advised that no dates are allowed
at this show.
OK, as if these choices weren't enough, there are two more cool things
that we would like to do on Valentine's Day, if we had the opportunity.
(OK, there are more, but we can't print those. Or maybe we can. Check the
rest of the issue, to find out.)
First, The Samples, a hot new folk rock/reggae-ish group, is playing at
the DNA lounge at 10 p.m. The Boulder-based band plays a lot of activist
oriented songs, and we (actually June, since Mara has no idea who they
are) think they have a great sound. Tickets are $3 and the club is at 11th
and Harrison in the City.
For another entirely unromantic event, Kepler's Bookstore is present
ing Allen Cohen, editor of the San Francisco Oracle, the psychedelic news
paper of the Haight-Ashbury, 1966-1968. He'll be talking about the history
of the tabloid, and it sounds pretty radical.
Oh, wait. Even though we only promised two more, there's one more
thing we've got to tell you about. Tonight is the opening night of "Rock
Justice," a musical about a singer on trial for not having a hit. It will play
every Thursday and Friday at the On-Broadway, at 435 Broadway in San
Francisco. Tickets are $15, shows start at 8 p.m. and you can call 282-3729
for more information.
Skipping ahead in time, which we would love to do, we would head to
Campbell Recital Hall to see junior Sara Long perform. She's lovely, cool
and a mezzo-soprano. She's also our (actually June's, Mara has no idea
who she is) friend. And it's free. What more do you want?
Well, we wish you all the best of luck this Valentine's Day. May everyone
you sent a rose send you a dozen in return. It's a rough world be care
ful out there.
Love and meaningless signs of manufactured affection,
