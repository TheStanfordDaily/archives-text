# Better than a warm bath

### Sarah Morisseau Staff writer 
I felt like my upper lip
was going to fall off.
I just don't think
I was cut out for steam
rooms. Any place so humid
it makes me feel like I'm
going to lose a part of my
body is no place for me. So
I opened the door and slid
back into the hot tub.
Rough life, that of a Daily
reporter.
At 8:30 a.m. Sunday, while you were proba
bly sound asleep, recovering from yet another
night of beer-guzzling at some fraternity's Jun
gle Party, I was touring Watercourse Way —
the hot tub mecca of Palo Alto. At 8:45,1 was
actually relaxing in one of their hot tubs.
Like I said, rough life ... but somebody
has to do it.
Before the lip incident, though, was the
grand tour.
Watercourse Way wasn't at all what I
expected. To be honest, when I think of a bath
house, what comes to mind is a sleazy place
often subject to police investigation ... and
not for tax evasion.
But it was clean. Really clean.
Watercourse Way calls itself a "family
bathing center," and although I don't get
excited at the prospect of bathing with my
family, I know a couple of grandmas who
would get a kick out of the place.
Hot tubs, sauna rooms, steam baths, soak
ing tubs, massages, facials, a sensory depriva
tion isolation flotation (say that five times fast)
tank and even a sushi bar.
Cool.
n . .1 1

I checked out the upstairs all alone, peeking
in closets just like Perry Mason. (No dead bod
ies, just some extra towels). The first few
rooms were for massages. Like any good
reporter would do, I bounced on the massage
tables to see how soft they were. Thumbs up.
After the massage rooms, I investigated the
isolation tank.
I stood at the edge of the tub for
a moment, debating whether I
should do it all at once, or nice
and slow. I decided on toes first,
then ankles, then knees — and
got out five minutes later, suffi
ciently pruned.
An isolation tank is basically a huge bathtub
designed to relax you by completely numbing
your senses. It is totally enclosed so that you
can't see or hear anything. The water is kept
exactly at body temperature so that you can't
feel it, and it contains 12,000 pounds of salt to
keep you totally afloat.
I stuck my hand in ... and that's as close as
I came to floating around in a totally dark box
for an hour-and-a-half. Sorry, guys.
Back downstairs, I saw the hot tubs. Boy,
did I see the hot tubs.
I saw tile hot tubs and ceramic hot tubs.
I saw tub rooms with skylights and tub
rooms without skylights.
I saw hot tubs with sauna rooms, hot tubs
with steam baths and hot tubs with cold tubs.
Then finally, the tour was over and the tub
trial was on. I stood at the edge of the tub for a
moment, debating whether I should do it all at
once, or nice and slow.
I decided on toes first, then ankles, then
knees — and got out five minutes later, suffi
ciently pruned. That was when I braved the
steam room.
A steam room is not like a sauna, as I soon
found out. A steam room is extremely humid,
so humid that... well, you know the rest.
Watercourse Way is definitely worth the
money The Daily paid for it, especially with the
free towels and soap.
Besides, the bathing suit is optional.

Watercourse Way is located at 165 Charming
Ave., Palo Alto. For rates and information, call
