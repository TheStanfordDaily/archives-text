# Commissioner vows improved election
## 
### Howard Libit Staff writer 
As this spring's ASSU elec
tions near, Raoul Lopez, the new
elections commissioner, wants to
mix a little humor with his plans
for increased enforcement of
campaign rules.
A third-year graduate student
in electrical engineering, Lopez
said he hopes to "make the elec
tion run as smoothly as possi
ble" and believes early planning
by the elections commission will
allow it to "iron out the details."
Lopez said he feels humor
was missing from last year's
campaign and he hopes its pres
ence will make for a better cam

paign this year.
For example, an advertise
ment for a prospective candi
dates' meeting in Monday's
Daily portrayed the election as a
game. It read, "Do you want to
play? What's the name of the
game?"
However, the advertisement
was not meant to decrease the
seriousness of the campaign,
Lopez said.
Lopez said the Elections
Commission's advertisement is
similar in tone to those for the
ASSU fee refund applications,
which bear the large headline
"SEX."
"The humor should appeal to
the good will and good judgment
of everyone involved. Having a
sense of humor is an important
part of life, but we will treat the
rules of the election in an
extremely serious manner," he
said.
Another of Lopez's election
goals is encouraging a multi-party
system. "I am sure that there are
more trains of thought" than the
two parties that currently exist,
he said.
However, because the elections
commission is a non-partisan
organization, it can do little more
than try to attract people to file
petitions to run for office, Lopez
said.
With his plan to enforce cam
paign laws stringently, Lopez
hopes to avoid the problems that
plagued last year's elections and
commission, which he said was "a
bit lax."
Last year's elections were
marred by uncertainty over cam
paign violation rulings and a post
election controversy over whether
to count write-in votes for non
registered students. The debate
culminated in a failed effort to
recall the winning People's Plat
form COP slate.
However, some of Lopez's rul
ings have already drawn fire from
the two main student parties on
campus.
New election rules stipulate
that no candidate may publicly
announce an intention to run for
office until April 10, the first offi
cial day of campaigning.
At a meeting for potential can
didates Monday night, ASSU
Hearings Officer Doreen Musson,
a graduate student in education,
also said candidates might be held
responsible if the media announce
their names before that date.
Lopez wants the People's Plat
form and Students First, the two
student parties, to hold informa
tional meetings before April 10 to
inform voters about their plat
forms without announcing spe

cific candidates.
"It is essential to us that candi
dates' names must be kept secret"
in order to prevent campaigning
before April 10, he said.
Representatives of both parties
expressed opposition to the idea.
Ingrid Nava, a member of the
People's Platform and the current
COF| said she agrees with the
"logic behind keeping the candi
dates' names secret" but "would
probably be against" closing the
meetings where slates are chosen.
She added that she was unfa
miliar with the exact details of
Lopez's proposal but noted the
People's Platform held open slat
ing meetings last year.
"We would prefer that any stu
dent who wants to see how the
slating process works or who the
candidates are be able to come and
watch. We would also want any
student who wanted to join the
slate from the floor to have that
opportunity," Nava said.
She expressed support for try
ing to prevent the media from
printing candidates' names but
declined to speculate on penalties
for any violations of the elections
bylaws.
Senior Michael Canul, chair of
the Students First party, was
adamantly opposed to keeping the
candidates' names secret after
they file a petition expressing
their intent to run.
"I think that it is ridiculous (to
keep the names secret). Once you
file your intent to be a candidate .
. . it is a matter of public informa
tion and any efforts to prevent
media access to those names
would restrict free speech," Canul
said.
"It is highly problematic and I
do not see what good it would do
to attempt to keep the names
secret," Canul added.
Students First also opposes
holding closed slating meetings
because the party "believes in
openness," Canul said. A closed
meeting would be "for all practical
purposes impossible."
Lopez said the upcoming elec
tion, in addition to being a fair
one, will be a "green" one because
the number of fliers will be lim
ited.

student parties, to hold informa
tional meetings before April 10 to
inform voters about their plat
forms without announcing spe

cific candidates.
"It is essential to us that candi
dates' names must be kept secret"
in order to prevent campaigning
before April 10, he said.
Representatives of both parties
expressed opposition to the idea.
Ingrid Nava, a member of the
People's Platform and the current
COF| said she agrees with the
"logic behind keeping the candi
dates' names secret" but "would
probably be against" closing the
meetings where slates are chosen.
She added that she was unfa
miliar with the exact details of
Lopez's proposal but noted the
People's Platform held open slat
ing meetings last year.
"We would prefer that any stu
dent who wants to see how the
slating process works or who the
candidates are be able to come and
watch. We would also want any
student who wanted to join the
slate from the floor to have that
opportunity," Nava said.
She expressed support for try
ing to prevent the media from
printing candidates' names but
declined to speculate on penalties
for any violations of the elections
bylaws.
Senior Michael Canul, chair of
the Students First party, was
adamantly opposed to keeping the
candidates' names secret after
they file a petition expressing
their intent to run.
"I think that it is ridiculous (to
keep the names secret). Once you
file your intent to be a candidate .
. . it is a matter of public informa
tion and any efforts to prevent
media access to those names
would restrict free speech," Canul
said.
"It is highly problematic and I
do not see what good it would do
to attempt to keep the names
secret," Canul added.
Students First also opposes
holding closed slating meetings
because the party "believes in
openness," Canul said. A closed
meeting would be "for all practical
purposes impossible."
Lopez said the upcoming elec
tion, in addition to being a fair
one, will be a "green" one because
the number of fliers will be lim
ited.
