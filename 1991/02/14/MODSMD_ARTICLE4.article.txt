# Commissioner vows improved election
## 
### Howard Libit Staff writer 
As this spring's ASSU elec
tions near, Raoul Lopez, the new
elections commissioner, wants to
mix a little humor with his plans
for increased enforcement of
campaign rules.
A third-year graduate student
in electrical engineering, Lopez
said he hopes to "make the elec
tion run as smoothly as possi
ble" and believes early planning
by the elections commission will
allow it to "iron out the details."
Lopez said he feels humor
was missing from last year's
campaign and he hopes its pres
ence will make for a better cam

paign this year.
For example, an advertise
ment for a prospective candi
dates' meeting in Monday's
Daily portrayed the election as a
game. It read, "Do you want to
play? What's the name of the
game?"
However, the advertisement
was not meant to decrease the
seriousness of the campaign,
Lopez said.
Lopez said the Elections
Commission's advertisement is
similar in tone to those for the
ASSU fee refund applications,
which bear the large headline
"SEX."
