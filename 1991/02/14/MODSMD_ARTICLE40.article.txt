Romance and
"A Room With a
View" in Italy
*A Room With a View" star
ring Helena Bonham-Carter
and Julian Sands.
When I leave a theater emotionally
stirred, I usually feel like a victim of
propaganda. But "A Room With a
View" is one of those rare films that
you can get emotionally caught up in
without feeling like an idiot
The story takes place largely in
Edwardian Britain, the historical apex
of social orthodoxy, reservedness and
tact.
The film begins however, in libidi
nous Italy, where our heroine Lucy is
vacationing with her elder cousin —
and chaperone — Charlotte.
There they encounter the Emer
sons, a father and son whom they find
to be most indelicate socially. George,
the young man, plays with his food, is
inappropriately quiet and is generally
impossible. He "has brains, but is very
muddled."
Worst of all, he insists on making
Lucy want to kiss him.
Lucy returns to England, where she
is engaged to marry Cecil, an insipid
little poetry-reading schmuck who
can't lciss. To his credit, however, he is
eminendy tactful.
Fortunately, George and his father
move by chance to the same country
town. With George around to "insult
her behind Cecil's back" (make her
want to kiss him again), Lucy finally
realizes that Cecil is boredom incar
nate and breaks off the engagement.
She cracks and admits that she
loves George, "Of course I did, what
did you all think?"
Score one for love.

'Goofy guy"
meets 'good girl'
"Say Anything," starring
John Cusak and lone Sky.
Dorky boy loves cool girl, dorky

Doy gets cool girl, dorky boy loses cool
girl. Cool girl loves dorky boy again,
cool girl and dorky boy live happily
ever after.
Well, nobody ever said "Say Any
thing" had an original plot.
If it's not the plot, then what is it?
"Say Anything" is of those all time
great romantic flicks, so it has to have
something....
It's not John Cusak's extremely
true-to-life character. It's not the way
you cringe when he makes a fool of
himself, or the way you cry when she
dumps him and cheer when she takes
him back.
It's not the heartstring tuggin' sub
plot of the relationship between the
girl and her father.
It's not the happy ending that
makes you think "Yeah, maybe I could
get a date here at Stanford...
It's not even the scene where he
stands outside her house in the rain
and plays their song, "In Your Eyes" by
Peter Gabriel, on his boombox because
she won't answer the phone.
Nope, it's Seattle.
Filmed in Seattle. Set in Seattle.
(Yes, we kiss up there, even in the
rain.) It's the Space Needle — the ter
rifically phallic symbol of the rainy
city. (Phallic enough, at least, for us
sexually-starved Intermission writers.)
Need I say anything more?

You'll play this
one again and
again ... Sam
"Casablanca/ starring
Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid
Bergman.
When you think of "Casablanca,"
you think of Humphrey Bogart's dis
tinctive voice saying, "Play it again,
Sam."
This line is never uttered in the
1942 classic.
Despite this, however, "Casablanca"
remains one of the truly great Holly
wood romances.
Ingrid Bergman co-stars in this
masterpiece as Bogart's beautiful ex
lover, who is now married to someone

else. Bergman walks into Bogart's bar
after years of separation, and asks his
assistance. She needs his help so she
and her husband can escape
Casablanca and continue with their
freedom-fighting missions.
The true romance of this film stems
from the decision Bogart must make.
Should he allow his lover to leave him
forever (with another man) for the
sake of a larger good? Or should he
remain neutral and let fate take its
course?
This Oscar-winner deserves all the
praise it has ever received, and defi
nitely merits a second or third viewing.
If for no other reason, it is worth
watching to prove that "Play it again"
is never in the film.

Six hours of
Scarlett
"Gone With the Wind," starring
Clark Gable and Vivian Leigh.
What list of great movie romances
would be complete without this 1939
blockbuster? Vivian Leigh is Scarlett
O'Hara, the feisty, spoiled Southern
belle you love to hate. Clark Gable is
Rhett Buder, the dashing scoundrel
with the pencil-thin mustache and
perpetual smirk who is determined to
win her.
Their tempestuous love affair, cast
against the backdrop of the Civil War
and Reconstruction eras, set the stan
dard for big-budget screen romance.
At some points the plot takes a few
contrived, melodramatic turns, but in
terms of visual power few films can
match the breathtakingly beautiful
color cinematography.
Some of the film's highlights: the
burning of Atlanta sequence, a scene
depicting a Confederate field hospital
and of course, Gable's famed line,
"Frankly, my dear, I don't give a
damn."

A prince who
gets rescued by
a prostitute
"Pretty Woman," starring
Julia Roberts and Richard
Gere.
What movies did you see last
summer, Dave?
"Pretty Woman."
I missed "Days of Thunder,"
"Arachnophobia" and even "Ghost"
last summer, because every time a
group of friends was going to the
movies, I'd convince them to see
"Pretty Woman."

Again.
It's the story of the promising pros
titute with low self-esteem who meets
a dashing but acrophobic billionaire,
and — you guessed it — they fall in
love.
Watching Richard Gere and Julia
Roberts play Pygmalion on each other
to such tunes as "King of Wishful
Thinking" and"It Must Have Been
Love" is enough to make even the least
romantic among us swoon.
"You and I are such similar crea
tures," Gere says. "We both screw peo
ple for money."
But by the end of the movie,
nobody's screwing anybody, period, as
if to remind you that this is a Disney
film after all.
This is one fairy tale you won't want
to miss. But odds are you haven't —
the latest figures show "Pretty
Woman" to be the second-most
watched movie worldwide, ever.
Only "E.T." could beat this delight
ful film that has fueled the fantasies of
all the ladies of the night in Hollywood
for the next decade.
— Dave Bianco
'Summer lovin'
at Rydell High
"Grease," starring John Tra
volta and Olivia Newton-John.
Forget all the garbage you've heard
about "Wuthering Heights," "Romeo
and Juliet" and other "classic"
romances; "Grease" leaves those dust
balls spinning at the stoplight.
A moving saga of modern love: boy
meets girl, boy disses girl, girl snubs
boy and goes out with dumb jock, boy
becomes dumb jock to win girl, girl
becomes slut to win boy, boy and girl
fall in love.
Pure romance.
— Alex Gregory
Can men and
women ever
really be
friends?
"When Harry Met Sally,"
starring Billy Crystal and Meg
Ryan.
"We were friends for a long time...
and then we weren't."
Everyone who has ever realized
with surprise, or even dismay, that
they're in love with one of their best
friends will see themselves in every
scene of "When Harry Met Sally."
Or wish they did.

I don't know, maybe it's the New
York setting, or maybe it's watching
the goofy couple sing "Fringe on Top"
(or whatever that song was called), but
this movie has a mesmerizing appeal
for goofy people like me.
You will find yourself sitting in your
seat thinking, "I want that."
Even when Sally is crying on
Harry's shoulder bemoaning the fact
that she'll be 40 one day, or when
Harry is lying next to her in bed with
"one foot on the floor," you'll still
point at the screen and say, "I want
that."
And all the romance aside, in the
history of filmmaking, there's never
been a scene which amuses women
and worries men more than Meg
Ryan's fake orgasm.... you just never
know, do you guys?...

For the love 0f...
a pickle man?
"Crossing Delancey," starring
Amy Irving.
"Crossing Delancey" is the story of
a New York Jewish woman who works
as a bookseller. Though she fancies
herself as a part of the cultured,
bohemian "in-crowd" of the literature
world, her Bubbie (the Yiddish equiva
lent of grandmother) wants her to find
a "nice Jewish boy" and settle down.
Through a matchmaker friend,
Bubbie arranges a blind date with a
pickle man.
Now, nothing could be more mun
dane and repugnant to her grand
daughter than dating a plain man who
smells of garlic and dill. But, of course,
after a series of misunderstandings, the
two fall in love.
This is a love affair of the "nice"
variety.
It isn't a stormy and passionate
relationship. It's a sweet and everlast
ing one.
s Nothing could be nicer than the
thought of these two nice people get
ting married and sharing a nice life
together.
At the end of this film, you won't
have tears of joy or sorrow in your
eyes, you'll simply sigh and say, "That
was really nice."
— Jen Sey
Random
romance from
Joel Stein
"Hitler — The Last Ten Days."
Always a Valentine's Day favorite,
this movie leads you through the

greatest love story of the 20th century.
No matter what your personal feelings
about the man are, this film cannot
help but bring a tear to your eye and a
pang to your heart.
The romance itself revolves around
the Filhrer and his beautiful and com
passionate mistress, Eva Braun.
With only minutes before the
Soviet troops approach his bunker,
Hitler is forced to recognize that the
power of love is stronger than even the
most ambitious forms of world domi
nation. A touching and subtly, yet
undeniably, erotic scene ensues, where
Adolph and Eva feed each other pieces
of chocolate cake.
The two newlyweds, knowing the
Allies will never let a love as strong as
their's last, decide, like Romeo and
Juliet, that they would rather die in
each others arms than live even a
moment apart.
So as a wedding favor to his advi
sors, also trapped in the bunker, the
honeymooners distribute silver
framed pictures of the Ftihrer himself,
along with two red, cyanide capsules.
I still cry.
— Joel Stein
With this title,
how could we
not include it?
'Love Story,* starring Ryan
O'Neal and All MacGraw.
What list of the greatest love stories
would be complete without — you
guessed it — "Love Story"?
This 1970 film stars Ryan O'Neal
and Ali MacGraw as star-crossed lovers
who meet as undergraduates at Har
vard. Their love endures until Mac-
Graw falls victim to a terminal illness.
During this period, rich boy O'Neal
is disinherited by his wealthy father for
choosing to marry a lower-class
woman. Eventually, he does get his law
degree, after the couple suffers the
pains of near-poverty for years, and
things begin to look better for them.
However, their lives are eternally shat
tered when they discover MacGraw has
a fatal disease.
Considering that the movie opens
with the mournful O'Neal asking the
audience, "What can you say about a
25-year-old girl that died?" you know
MacGraw's character is going to die,
making every scene prior to the her
death all the more depressing.
Although overtly maudlin, "Love
Story" is definitely an entertaining
movie. Sentimentalists will be moved
by it. Realists will laugh at it.
And you'll learn why "Love means
never having to say you're sorry."
— Sunil Perkash
