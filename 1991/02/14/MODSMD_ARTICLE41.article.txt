# Working on the night moves: The best songs to turn on
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
For reasons still unbeknownst to
me, the arbiters of good taste at this
newspaper (i.e. the Intermission edi
tors) have commissioned me to com
pile a list of the top 69 make-out songs
of the modern era.
Before rushing into things, allow
me to define a few terms.
Modern err Loosely defined, this
excludes pre-Elvis music.
Make out: To display affection in a
physical fashion; kiss, fondle, suck
face; the kind of stuff one might do in
the back seat of a *57 Chevy after your
senior prom.
Make-out song: Whatever the
spirit moved me to include on the list I
included. But, basically, the following
songs would somehow enhance rather
than hinder the activity detailed above.
Most songs on the list have some
thing to do with love, lust and the like
— but, then again, so do most songs
these days. A song needn't be explicitly
about making out (e.g. Meatloaf's
"Paradise by the Dashboard Light") to
qualify. Nor does explicit mention of
sexual activity (e.g. George Michael's
"I Want Your Sex" or AC/DC's "Let Me
Put My Love Into You") guarantee
placement in the top 69.
I tended to favor mellow tunes over

raucous bump-and-grind stuff, but
enough upbeat ditties have been
thrown in to ensure neither party falls
asleep prematurely.
The hot rumor is that K-tel will be
releasing a multi-volume Intermission
Top 6S compilation soon, but no
details yet on where to send your
money...
Here they are, in reverse order.

Before rushing into things, allow
me to define a few terms.
Modern err Loosely defined, this
excludes pre-Elvis music.
Make out: To display affection in a
physical fashion; kiss, fondle, suck
face; the kind of stuff one might do in
the back seat of a *57 Chevy after your
senior prom.
Make-out song: Whatever the
spirit moved me to include on the list I
included. But, basically, the following
songs would somehow enhance rather
than hinder the activity detailed above.
Most songs on the list have some
thing to do with love, lust and the like
— but, then again, so do most songs
these days. A song needn't be explicitly
about making out (e.g. Meatloaf's
"Paradise by the Dashboard Light") to
qualify. Nor does explicit mention of
sexual activity (e.g. George Michael's
"I Want Your Sex" or AC/DC's "Let Me
Put My Love Into You") guarantee
placement in the top 69.
I tended to favor mellow tunes over

raucous bump-and-grind stuff, but
enough upbeat ditties have been
thrown in to ensure neither party falls
asleep prematurely.
The hot rumor is that K-tel will be
releasing a multi-volume Intermission
Top 6S compilation soon, but no
details yet on where to send your
money...

For reasons still unbeknownst to
me, the arbiters of good taste at this
newspaper (i.e. the Intermission edi
tors) have commissioned me to com
pile a list of the top 69 make-out songs
of the modern era.

me to define a few terms.
