# Reworked 'Oedipus' ponders death using all-female cast
## 
### Martha Brockenbrough Senior staff writer 
"Whatever you do, you must
turn your thoughts to death."
Because I'm the sort of person
who'd rather lean back and think of
England, this grim mantra of
"Seneca's Oedipus" came unin
vited.
Despite my skepticism, my
thoughts did turn to death during
the Drama Department's artsy, yet
absorbing, rewrite of the Oedipus
myth.
The show begins with
video monitors — and
not actors — on stage.
Images of violence, dis
order and lost control
pass vividly across the
two outer screens, creat
ing an overall effect
which is both humorous
and grimly violent.
The main features of the Oedi
pus myth remain intact — Oedi
pus learns the hard way how he
killed his father and bedded his
mother. Yet, director Lance Miller
and dramaturge Matthew Causey
have managed to stamp the over
analyzed story in a wholly different
way.
The show begins with video
monitors — not actors — on stage.
Images of violence, disorder and
lost control pass vividly across the
two outer screens, while words and
sentences fill the center one.
Although the verbal messages
should have been run through a
spellchecker, the effect overall is
both humorous and grimly violent.
It creates a mood ripe for Seneca's

Stoic philosophy that one must put
aside passion and unjust thoughts
in order to accept fate, and master
life.
So that Miller and Causey could
emphasize the storytelling aspect
of drama, and to build distance
between the actors and narrative,
they chose an all-female cast. Most
played their roles at a constant
emotional level.
Kristi Pado playing Oedipus,
and Abigail Derecho as Kreon both
maintained this focused distance,
rising to emotion only when most
appropriate. The effect is powerful,
especially when an eerily-lit,
booming-voiced Derecho domi
nates the stage as Kreon learning
the truth about Oedipus.
Not all characters are portrayed
with this austerity, however. This
inconsistency seems to undermine
Miller and Causey's attempt to dis
tance the performers from the nar
rative. And, while this could have
been a deliberate choice, it raises
some questions about the ambition
of the production.
Although the set is simple, the
play attempts to deal with many of
the most profound philosophical
questions ever asked, in a very
complex way. In addition to the
thematic gravity and video open
ing, a layered soundtrack and care
fully choreographed choral move
ment leave playgoers reeling with
confusion.
The production is certainly
carefully crafted. Use of a varying
background hum creates tension,
and the choreography reinforces
some important issues.
And, while ambition is
admirable, and this ambitious
show captivating, I didn't feel when
I left that I really understood what
it was all about.
Yes, my thoughts turned to
death, to war, to corruption and
vice. Once they were turned,
though, they had nothing to settle
upon. Perhaps that was the point.
