# Underneath it All

### Anita Schneider 
Last year, did this happen to you?
You bought chocolates for your beloved and
found out she was on a diet. You bought flowers and
found out she had hay fever. You bought nothing
and found out that was a bad idea.
This Valentine's Day, give your lover something
she'll really appreciate.
Lingerie and underwear are great gifts, and
today's designs fit all types 0f... personalities. Local
shops carry a range of styles from sophisticated to
exotic, from humorous to ...
Senshu, in the new Plaza Ramona building in
downtown Palo Alto, carries fine European under
wear, sleepwear and loungewear for men and
women. Business partners Shirley Gines and Maxine
Most, both of whom gave up careers in technology to
"go into underwear," call the Senshu line "software
for the body."
The concept behind Senshu is to emphasize fine
lingerie not necessarily as "an accoutrement to sex,
but an enhancement of the body and spirit."
The women's collection includes beautiful lace
gowns, bodysuits and leggings and colorful
chemises, silk robes and pajamas.
Senshu also carries a line of clothing for men,
who, by the way, compose 50 percent of the buyers.
Men's clothing includes bathrobes, G-strings and
handwashed silk boxers.
Everything in the store is made of either 100 per

cent silk or cotton, and prices are geared to reach all
income brackets. The atmosphere is elegant, sensual
and not at all overpowering.
So, even if you're hesitant about buying "unmen
tionables" for you or your honey, you'll be made to
feel comfortable shopping at Senshu.
For those of you who are quite comfortable shop
ping for undergarments, there's Victoria's Secret at
the Stanford Shopping Center.
The reasonably-priced clothing at Victoria's
Secret includes cotton, polyester and silk items in a
selection of teddies, robes, garters, G-strings and
bra-and-panty sets. You'll find a style to fit the mood
you want — whether it's bold or bashful.
Men's items aren't sold in this particular Victoria's
Secret, but silk boxers are featured at the store in the
Valley Fair Mall and in the one in San Francisco Cen
ter.
If you're not really ready to shop at a "lingerie
only" store, you can still pick up something for that
special person. Many department stores stock more
than just Hanes.
For example, carries many designer labels
for women. You could go for Christian Dior's bra
and-panty sets in dazzling red, horizon blue or deep
teal. Or maybe Ungaro's feminine styles in spicy
shades of tangerine, lime and hot pink.
There's also Oscar de la Renta's delicate laces in
pale spring colors, and Morgan Taylor's red silk Fan
tasies. If you're truly daring, try a tiger-striped body

suit by Calvin Klein. You can't go wrong.
Macy's men's department also carries holiday
underwear, but you'll need a sense of humor to shop
here. Case in point: The novelty item this Valentine's
Day is $17 glow-in-the-dark boxer shorts by San
Francisco's Joe Boxer. When you turn out the lights,
your man's shorts will turn on with the message,
"Loves me, loves me not."
If you're looking for something just a little more
serious, Joe Boxer designs exclusive prints of pigs,
robots and cows for $24. And he has the more tradi
tional silk boxers in red, white or polka-dots.
Nordstrom's also has a selection of underclothes,
and may be more suitable for you if you're the con
servative type. Cotton boxers in stripes, plaids and
solids are the traditional fare here; the riskiest items
Nordstrom carries are Calvin Klein's string bikinis
and red briefs.
And for women, Nordstrom has created an exclu
sive Valentine's design that's selling like mad. This
design can be found on 100 percent cotton or silk
boxers, or on camisoles, tap pants, teddies and biki
nis.
Or you can try the Designer Boutique, where a
$198 lace body suit by La Perla will look great with
an elegant red silk robe (also available at Nord
strom).
The bottom line is: there's no excuse for stale
chocolate this year.
