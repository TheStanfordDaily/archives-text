Kissing: Everything you ever wanted to know
Tomima Edmark
Simon & Schuster, 128 pages, $6.95
A book on kissing?
Get serious. Everybody can kiss, right?
Wrong, according to Tomima Edmark, whose
book proclaims, "There are most definitely correct
and incorrect ways to kiss."
An amusing look at the ins and outs, so to speak,
of kissing, Edmark's book unfortunately also perpet
uates sexist and "heterosexist" stereotypes. For exam
ple, she writes, "Men and boys steal kisses; women
and girls usually let them," and "A kiss is the most
intimate form of contact between a man and a
woman."
Edmark has collected funny quotes ("A kiss is an
inquiry on the second floor as to whether the first
floor is free." â€” Art Garfunkel) and interesting theo
ries about kissing's origins.
And, she freely dispenses advice:
On first kisses: "If you move forward to continue
the kissing and your partner does not, this is a sign
that perhaps he or she doesn't feel any chemistry. In
this situation, it is advised that you stop kissing."
The Paper Bag Princess
Robert Munsch, story
Michael Martchenko, art
Annick Press Ltd., 24 pages, $4.95
This prize-winning children's book is a hilarious
retelling of the classic damsel-in-distress-saved-by
dragon-slaying-prince story, only this time with a
new twist
In"The Paper Bag Princess," it is the prince who is
carried off and the princess who must save him.
Elizabeth, the heroine, outsmarts the dragon and
goes to rescue Ronald, the tennis-racket wielding
prince. When he complains of her messy, dirty
appearance (And who wouldn't be a mess after hav
ing her castle burned down and trekking miles
through the countryside in pursuit of a dragon?) she
tells him in no uncertain terms what she thinks of
him.
