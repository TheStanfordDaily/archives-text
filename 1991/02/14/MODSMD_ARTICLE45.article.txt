Through the Arc of the Rain Forest

Coffee House Press, 211 pages, $9.95
Reviewed by Kecia Albright

"Through the Arc of the Rain Forest" is a perceptive look
at the excesses of modern society. Through exaggeration
and satire, Karen Tei Yamashita crafts an elaborate micro
cosm of fame, fortune and immediate gratification which
not only does not really satisfy her characters' needs, but
also comes crashing down around them in the end.
Although set primarily in the Brazilian Amazon, this
novel begins in Japan when a certain Kazumasa Ishimaru,
still only a boy, is knocked unconscious on the beach only
to awaken with a small ball floating several inches in front
of his face. Yamashita describes his relationship with his
own personal satellite,
"Kazumasa was never again in his life alone. During the
day, the ball bobbed and bounced and jittered merrily
before him in the same wandering pattern of the boy fol
lowing the intuitive dance of his growing muscles The
ball was his pet and his friend."
In an cutesy attempt at stylistic originality, Yamashita
uses the ball to narrate the novel. The outcome is clumsy; a
straightforward narrative would have served the purpose
equally well and been less disruptive in an otherwise well
written work.
The book's other characters include Man£ Pena, a sim
ple farmer who discovers the healing and soothing power of
feathers; J.B. Tweep, the three-armed, over-achieving
American whose aim is to market feathers to the whole
world; and Chico Paco, a simple small-town boy who ends
up with an evangelical radio empire.
In a plot that involves flocks of carrier pigeons, a chain
of karoake bars and a giant American corporation, the
story's characters are all inexplicably drawn to the MatacSo,
an almost impenetrable plastic layer covering parts of the
Earth, first discovered in the Amazon rain forest.
For some, like Chico, the MatacSo has a religious signif
icance; for others, like Tweep, it is significant because of the
possibilities for commercial exploitation. For all, it becomes
a source of contention and the root of disaster.
Yamashita crafts real, likable characters, ascribing to
them the same motivations that influence all humans: jeal
ousy, altruism, greed, love. All are searching for personal
fulfillment, and though they achieve material wealth, it

comes at the expense of personal relationships.
Yamashita employs old themes: Money can't buy happi
ness and be careful what you wish for because you may get
it. "Through the Arc of the Rain Forest,' 1 however, is more
than a simple reiteration of these ideas.
By the novel's end, the catastrophic consequences of an
overriding concern with growth and development ("bigger

is better") are clear; her characters pay dearly for their
shortsightedness and greed, as do many who are personally
uninvolved.
Thoroughly entertaining, "Through the Arc of the Rain
Forest" is also thought-provoking; Yamashita forces her
readers to reconsider their goals and ambitions in light of
her characters' predicaments.
