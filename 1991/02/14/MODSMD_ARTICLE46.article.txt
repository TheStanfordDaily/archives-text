Allende's newest book, "The Stories of Eva
Luna," contains romantic fairy tales, bitter
sweet stories of star-crossed lovers and magical
legends about timeless passions.
Allende employs the heroine of her last
novel, "Eva Luna," as a modern-day Latin
American Scheherazade. At the request of her
lover, Rolf Carl£, Eva creates the series of myths

and fables found in this collection.
She states at the beginning of one of her
tales, "Every person has his or her story, and in
this barrio they were almost always sad, stories
of poverty and accumulated injustice, of every
form of violence, of children dead before term
and lovers who had run away, but Maria's story
was different; it had a glow of elegance that
gave wing to the imagination."
This is indeed the case with many of the sto
ries Eva relates. In the style of a true magical
realist, Allende's narrator extracts from the
brutal realities of Latin America all that is beau
tiful and mysterious, bizarre and intriguing.
The 23 stories are told in a rich and exotic

language appropriate to their setting, and the
characters, too, are of the exact types one
would expect to find in the cosmopolitan cities
and luxuriant jungles of this land of contrasts
and contradictions.
Allende paints vivid characters such as
Nicolis Vidal, the arrogant and independent
gang leader who "had always known that a
woman would cost him his life"; simple Maria,
the dignified prostitute plagued by a life of mis
fortune; Walimai, the "noble savage" intent on
defending the honor of his conquered people;
and a variety of despots, political leaders of vil
lages or nations, all corrupted by their own
visions of power.

After allowing her audience brief but
insightful glimpses into the minds and hearts
of her protagonists, Eva Luna proceeds to
weave their often tragic tales. Although they
span many centuries and an entire continent,
all of the stories are united by a number of
common themes, including loneliness,
revenge, compassion, desire and especially,
death.
The plots are rarely conventional, and often
contain unexpected twists and turns. The end
ings, in particular, tend to leave the reader with
a sense of amazement and disbelief.
In the book's final chapter, "And of Clay Are
We Created," journalist Rolf Carl£ exposes a bit

of the irony of advanced technology. He is one
of the dozens of reporters on the scene of a dev
astating avalanche that has killed hundreds and
left a young girl named Azucena trapped in the
mud.
While a multitude of technicians utilize
sophisticated equipment to transmit the image
of the dying girl to television screens around
the globe, no one, not even the country's pres
ident, is able to locate a simple pump to free
her from her earthly prison.
In combining powerful narratives such as
Rolf's with fanciful tales of romance and
adventure, Eva Luna presents a unique and fas
cinating vision of Latin America.
