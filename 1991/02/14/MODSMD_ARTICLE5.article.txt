# Grassroots organizers won't get greenbacks
## 
### Miranda Doyle Staff writer 
A controversial ASSU bill request
ing reimbursement for students who
attended an off-campus workshop was
withdrawn Tuesday night because
fewer students actually went than
originally planned.
The bill, which had previously been
voted down by two separate commit
tees, was reintroduced at last Tues
day's ASSU Senate meeting and
referred to the Appropriations Com
mittee. But the bill's authors, Council
of Presidents member Ingrid Nava and
ASSU senator Naomi Onaga, decided
to withdraw it before another commit
tee vote.
Onaga, a junior, said the senate will
officially be informed at its Feb. 21

meeting that the bill will not be sub
mitted for a vote.
The bill, which was also supported
by the COFJ asked that money be taken
from the senate discretionary fund to
reimburse students who attended the
Grassroots Organizing Weekend at
Fresno State University Feb. 9-10.
Nava said the weekend featured
workshops on how to organize people
at the grassroots level. She said partic
ipants were taught how to wage cam
paigns and educate people on mock
issues.
Onaga said the bill was withdrawn
because the people who had needed the
money to go to the workshop were not
sure whether they would be reim
bursed and did not attend. "The people
who needed the money pulled out" and
made the bill unnecessary, she said.

These withdrawals reduced the
number of students who went to the
session from 10 to about eight, lending
more weight to some senators' criti
cism that the reimbursement would
benefit only a few students, Onaga
said.
Several senators strongly opposed
the bill. Senator Jay Goldin, a senior,
said he objected to it because the work
shop was an outside event that few
students know about.
Senate associate John Hall said, "I
think we would be saying its method of
political activism is better than other
methods of activism" if the bill was
passed. By supporting students at [the
workshopl and giving money to them,
we would be supporting professional
agitator training."
Nava denied that the workshops are

an outside activity, noting that they
are sponsored by the United States
Student Association to which Stanford
belongs. "Some people probably con
sider it radical" because it is aimed at
organizing and not at preserving the
status quo, Nava said.
Senior Leina Johansson, who
attended a similar workshop session
last fall, said the skills learned there do
not have a political basis. "They can be
applied to political causes or they could
help people with any kind of organiz
ing," she said. "How you apply them is
up to you."
However, Onaga denied that some
senators' opposition to the workshop
was a main reason for the decision to
withdraw the request for funding.
The bill, which originally asked
for $300, was submitted to the
Budget and Finance Committee
Jan. 24. At that time, according to
committee chair John Overdeck,
there was not enough money in

the discretionary fund to cover
the requested amount.
The fund was depleted because
$685 was withdrawn for the
ASSU-proposed Undergraduate
Teaching Award. However, the
Budget and Finance Committee
may decide today to use the
annual discretionary fund for the
award instead and put money
back into the senate account.

The second time it was intro
duced, the bill was submitted to
the Appropriations Committee.
The committee voted it down
because it felt the request —
reduced to $200 — was a large
sum of money that only benefited
a few students.
The COP donated $150 from
its own discretionary fund for the
weekend workshop.
