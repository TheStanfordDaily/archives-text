# War rally wakes sleepy campus
## Peace group stages night march through library, dorms 
### Dylan Tyson Editorial staff 
Stanford students appeared to
be caught by surprise last night as
their studies were interrupted by
beating drums, clanging pipes,
jangling keys and screaming peo
ple.
But they were not hearing the
Stanford Band.
What they did hear was an
anti-war march planned by Stan
ford Students for Peace in the
Middle East to heighten con
sciousness about the war.
About 85 protesters gathered
in White Plaza at 11 p.m. last
night and proceeded to march
through the lobby of Meyer
Library and then past Stern,
Toyon, Wilbur and Branner Halls
en route to all the mtyor dorms on
campus.
The protesters were singing
John Lennon's "Give Peace a
Chance" and carrying signs with
such slogans as "Stanford Stu
dents say No to War for Oil" and
"Lives lost should not be the cost
for oil lifestyle." Many clapped
and chanted throughout the
march.
About 50 people helped plan

the demonstration Tuesday at
Columbae house. The anti-war
group decided marching through
campus would "heighten the
awareness that a strong faction of
people is in opposition to the war,"
said Students for Peace member
Jenn Pearson. "We want people to
raise their voices for peace."
"We want people to know ...
the peace movement has not died
out," Pearson said.
Group organizers said they are
planning teach-ins, workshops on
non-violence and a film series for
the next few weeks.
"The peace movement has been
quite busy, but a lot of the things
it has been doing have not been
that visible," said group member
Gabriel Kahn, a senior. "Our pur
pose (in planning the rally) is to
make some noise — to wake peo
ple up again."
As the protesters filed through
Meyer Library, several students
peered through the windows to
figure out what was going on. The
efleet was even more pronounced
at the dormitories where many
students stopped what they were
doing for a few moments to assess
the situation.
Not all students supported the

rally, however.
"I disagree with their view
point," said freshman Mark
Weber, founder and chairman of
the Stanford chapter of Students
for America, a new conservative
group. "But I feel the protesters
have every right to voice their
opinions."
Freshman Angie Rice, whose
father is in the Air Force, said,
"I'd like to hear the protesters say
something meaningful. We all
want peace in our hearts. If you're
going to protest you have to give
options.
"Noisemakers won't stop Sad
dam Hussein," said Eric Krock, a
member of Students for America.
"It's possible the low turnout
reflects a drop in support on cam
pus for the peace movement," he
said.
Students for Peace member
John Chang, who graduated last
quarter, said the commotion the
rally caused was justified.
"In a sense the rally is sup
posed to be disruptive in order to
show that we are in an emergency
state," Chang said. He quickly
added he did not believe anyone in
his organization would advocate
destructive or violent events.
