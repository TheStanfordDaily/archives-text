# WAR IN THE GULF
## Allies continue to pound away 
### 
DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) — From the
Kuwait coast to central Iraq, U.S. and allied
pilots pounded away at fresh targets yesterday,
unimpeded by the international furor over the
Baghdad bunker tragedy.
The U.S. command, in response to the death
of hundreds of civilians in Wednesday's Bagh
dad bombing, said it was looking for new ways
to limit such casualties — possibly including
advance announcements of its targets.
The air war, buildup to an armor-and
infantry push into Kuwait, appeared to have
made progress. The command said one
third of Iraq's tanks and artillery in the battle
zone have now been destroyed.
Strategists are believed shooting for 50-per
cent destruction before ordering the ground
assault. The commander of British forces in
the Persian Gulf, Lt. Gen. Sir Peter de la Bil
liere, told reporters yesterday there are already
"proposed dates" for the offensive.
In the Desert Storm air campaign, two crew
men of a U.S. Air Force EF-111 were killed
when their plane went down in northern Saudi
Arabia, apparently after being damaged in
combat, and a British Tornado bomber was lost
while attacking Iraqi airfields. Its two crew
men were listed as missing.
In Baghdad, the day-after scenes were
etched in sadness and hate.
Body after body was pulled in grisly proces-
sion from the rubble of the underground structure
bombed by U.S. warplanes early Wednesday, while it
was crowded with civilians seeking refuge from air
attacks.
The death toll remained uncertain, in part
because workers still had not reached all areas of the
shattered structure.
Civil defense officials estimated more than 500
died, mostly women and children. A mortuary direc
tor said 288 bodies had been removed, including 91
children, CNN's Peter Arnett reported. Reporters at
the scene counted at least 40 corpses, many decapi
tated or missing limbs, extricated over one 90-
minute period yesterday.
The U.N. Security Council opened debate on the
Gulf War yesterday in its first closed-door session in
15 years. Iraq's envoy condemned the bombing
deaths of civilians in Baghdad and declared Kuwait
a province of Iraq.
China called the reports of civilian casualties and
massive destruction caused by allied raids in Iraq
"extremely grave" and offered its own plan for
achieving a peaceful solution.
The debate was the first on the war by the 15-
member council, which in November authorized the
United States and its allies to use military force to
drive Iraq from Kuwait after Jan. 15.
The council adjourned yesterday night after three
and a half hours of debate and was to reconvene this
morning.
