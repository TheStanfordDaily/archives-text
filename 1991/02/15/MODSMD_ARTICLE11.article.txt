# Need a date? XTV to revive 'Lovelinks'
## 
### Connie Chang Editorial Staff 
It's back and it's "racier" than ever, accord
ing to XTV Station Manager Dave Holland.
"No more red and pink hearts in the back
ground. ... Now there's a black backdrop plas
tered with lip imprints."
He speaks, of course, about "Lovelinks,"
the Stanford television dating game show
which is being revived later this month with at
least three new episodes already scheduled.
When it was founded two years ago, the
show was noted in newspapers across the
country. But it stopped airing after spring
quarter 1989 because Sharon Wachs, the
show's original producer, graduated.
"Lovelinks" follows the format of "The Dat
ing Game," in which one person questions
three prospective dates and selects one to go
out with. "Lovelinks" covers the cost of the
actual date, usually through restaurant dona
tions or dormitory contributions.
Senior Shari Bradford, the show's new pro
ducer, remembers "Lovelinks"' debut her
sophomore year and said she "got really
excited" about reviving it when she started
working on the project.
The first three episodes are scheduled to be
taped next Wednesday. Although Bradford had
originally planned to start yesterday — Valen
tine's Day, the "response hasn't been all that
great, partially because of timing," she said.
Many students have tests this week, she
added.
However, Bradford said she is confident
that once the show has begun taping, it will

"sustain interest over the year." Students "get
a vicarious experience out of watching the
show," she said.
The show's hosts, senior Andrew Reisner
and sophomore Shari Levine, also said they
are excited about the upcoming taping.
Although "Lovelinks" will be his television
debut, Reisner said he can "give Pat a
run for his money, and Shari's got Vanna
White beaten down." He added he became a
host because he had watched many television
game shows and decided, "I can do that."
He said he is not worried about making mis
takes because they will be funny. His "top pri
ority is making it entertaining for the audi
ence," he said, adding that "this is a college
production, not a professional production."
Levine made her XTV debut in the four
part science-fiction series "Invasion Stanford,
1991 A.D."
Reisner said the fact that he and Levine
know each other well might "work to the
show's advantage and diffuse any nervous
ness."
Holland said, "The fact that it's been done
before and was popular takes a lot of pressure
off." People enjoy the show, and the response
two years ago was very positive, he said.
XTV has been replaying old "Lovelinks"
episodes by request since last year.
Bradford said she has received a number of
calls from people who want to participate.
Most have asked to be the "scammer," the per
son asking the questions, rather than one of
the three "scammees," who are asked ques
tions.
Although "Lovelinks" participants can say

'The fact that it's been done
before and was popular takes
a lot of pressure off.' People
enjoy the show, and the
response two years ago was
very positive.

which position they would "prefer" to play,
Bradford said the "ultimate choice" is left to
her.
She said she tries "to get. .. people who are
more aggressive and creative" to be the scam
mers, but added that there is a "camaraderie
developed among the other three contestants."
The scammees are in the "hot seat" and
have to "come up with clever responses and
compete" with one other, she said.
Reisner said the staff had discussed doing
an episode with single faculty members. Peo
ple would probably "like seeing their profes
sors going through the same agony and tur
moil we all go through," he said.
In the show's original season, a special gay
and lesbian episode was produced during Gay
and Lesbian Awareness Week.
The first taping of "Lovelinks" will take
place Feb. 20 at 8:30 p.m. in Ricker Dining and
Performance Center. Students can also watch
the final, edited version of the show Feb. 25 at
8 p.m. on Channel 10.
