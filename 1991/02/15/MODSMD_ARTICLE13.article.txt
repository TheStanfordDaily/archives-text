Corruption inquiry begins in Haiti
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - The
week-old government of President Jean-
Bertrand Aristide on Thursday barred 91
high-level civil servants from leaving Haiti as
part of a corruption inquiry.
All those named in the new list served under
Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot's 11-month interim civil
ian government, independent Radio Haiti
Inter reported.
Among them was Robert Sabalat, president
of the Electoral Council which organized the
Dec. 16 general elections in which Aristide was
chosen president by a two-thirds vote margin.
About 1,000 international observers moni
tored the balloting and declared it the first
democratic election in Haiti's 187-year history.
Shamir aide denies reports of
Golan Heights demilitarization
JERUSALEM (AP) - An aide to Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir today assured
Israelis in the Golan Heights that reports of
government readiness to demilitarize the area
in peace talks with Syria were baseless.
Yossi Ahimeir, director of Shamir's office,
made the statement in a letter following
reports that Washington was floating the
buffer zone idea as a way of reviving Middle
East peace efforts, despite the Gulf War.
The strategic Golan, a plateau that also bor
ders Jordan on the south and Lebanon to the
north, was captured from Syria in the 1967
Middle East War. Israel annexed the area in
1981.
Oil company profits triple
WASHINGTON (AP) — Major oil compa
nies recorded a 77 percent increase in profits in
the fourth quarter of 1990 as high crude oil
prices nearly tripled their income from oil and
gas production, the government reported
Thursday.
The report by the Energy Department said
there was no evidence of price gouging by the
companies.
The companies' "greatest gains in prof
itability were directly tied" to the sharp
increases in crude oil prices that occurred in
the months after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait
on Aug. 2, the report said.
But the report noted that in recent months
oil prices have been declining and because of a
supply glut may fall more when the fighting
stops in the Persian Gulf.
