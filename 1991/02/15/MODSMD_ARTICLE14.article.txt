# Economic woes intensify in eastern Germany
## 
### 
BERLIN (AP) - More than 15,000
teachers and school workers staged a
warning strike in eastern Germany on
Thursday in the latest sign of the
region's growing economic troubles.
In Bonn, the economics ministry
said eastern German industrial output
plunged 10.5 percent in December.
Across the former Communist
nation of 16 million residents, local
leaders are clamoring for more money
from the federal government, unem
ployment is increasing, and rents are
rising beyond the reach of many peo
ple.
For many, the euphoria over Octo
ber's unification of the two Germanys
has been replaced by worry and feel
ings of insecurity about the future.
Teachers walked off their jobs in the

cities of Dresden, Leipzig and Chem
nitz, forcing three-quarters of the local
schools and kindergartens to close for
the day.
In all, about 15,500 striking teach
ers and school personnel took to the
streets in demonstrations during the
one-day job action, according to the
GEW teachers' union.
The strikers were demanding
higher wages and job protection,
despite efforts to trim down the
bloated Communist-era work forces.
Economics Minister Juergen
Moellemann said earlier this week that
rebuilding the industry in eastern Ger
many will take longer and be more dif
ficult than originally thought.
At the same time, the federal gov
ernment said it was sending $6 billion

mmmmm

to eastern German this month to keep
towns and cities financially afloat.
On Thursday, Moellemann said the
10.5 percent drop in eastern German
industrial production underscores the
"seriousness of the economic situation
there."
Western Germans, whose industry
remains strong, say they will have to
rebuild eastern German industry from
top to bottom. The region's Commu
nist-built plants and factories are in
worse shape than originally estimated,
and they are turning out almost no
products that are competitive on world
markets.
Eastern Germany's state governors
met in Dresden to plan their latest
strategy for getting more money from
Bonn.

Kurt Biedenkopf, the maverick gov
ernor of Saxony, revived his threat of a
Supreme Court suit to get increased
funds.
"There cannot be two different
standards for what is reasonable in
east and west," Biedenkopf said.
Manfred Stolpe, the state governor
of Brandenburg, says an additional
$22 billion are needed to bail out the
region.
While federal Finance Minister
Theo Waigel has promised tax hikes,
the government still has not adopted
such increases.
In addition, the Bonn government
insists higher taxes will be needed to
finance the Gulf War and other items,
rather than the merger of the two Ger
man states.
