## 'Coed by bed' all year 
### 
Friends of different
genders should be
able to live together

Right now, the idea of
pairing roommates of differ
ent genders probably seems
as foreign as allowing men and
women to live in the same dormito
ries did 40 years ago.
But just because there would be
initial opposition to "coed by bed"
housing does not mean the Univer
sity should not consider it.
Students who are friends of the
same gender have always had the
option of drawing and rooming
together. But students who are
friends of different genders can
only, under the current policy,
draw together.
The University should enable
students interested in drawing into
coed rooms to do so, regardless of
pressures from alumni and par
ents.
Ideally, students should have the
option of rooming with whomever
they want. After all, if consenting
adults make an informed decision
to live together, the University
should respect their choice rather
than provide obstacles to it.
But, just as it would only be
responsible for the University to
allow students to room with mem
bers of the opposite sex, it would be
irresponsible for it to force stu
dents to live in coed rooms. Many
who would like to room with a
friend of a different gender would
feel uncomfortable with a stranger
of a different gender.
To prevent students from get
ting random roommates of the
opposite gender, the University
could set aside a certain number of
rooms to be single sex.
This would ensure that there

are no "extras" after an in-house
draw; no one would be forced to
room with a random roommate of
the opposite sex.
Naturally, students of coed
rooms would have to grapple with
issues of privacy and space â€” but
such is the case with roommates of
the same sex. The difficulties of
such an arrangement are limited
compared to the insights it could
provide.
As two years of experimentation
at Burbank has shown, coed rooms
can add a new dimension to the
understanding of and interacting
with members of the opposite gen
der.
This year's arrangement, part of
a gender exploration week, com
pelled students to find personal
answers to the question of whether
or not men and women can be
friends, and just friends.
At the very least, more dorms
should consider trying Burbank's
experiment because of its potential
to break down gender stereotypes.
Having coed rooms for an entire
year can be a workable option. Cur
rently, there is already at least one
house on campus that, unofficially,
has coed rooms.
The University should provide
this option, however, only to upper
classmen.
Having incoming freshmen live
in coed rooms could cause prob
lems. Many might want to live in
coed rooms for novelty's sake,
while others might bring with
them all sorts of emotional prob
lems.
Of course, all students, upper
classmen or not, should think
twice before taking up the option
to live with members of the oppo
site sex.
Couples who wanted to take
advantage of a policy change would
have to remember that they will
have to room together for a full
year, for better or for worse.
