Admitting disadvantaged does not mean lower standards

I HAD THE GREAT DISPLEASURE
of reading Reid Schar's Feb. 11 letter
entitled, "Admissions should not com
promise for the underprivileged."
Schar's generalizations about inner
city youth indicated to me that he has
neither seen nor understood life outside
his "I have seen the inside of a few coun
try clubs" background.
Apparently in response to a student's
article expressing desire to see more
"students of color from the inner city"
attend Stanford, Schar posed the ques
tion, "Is she asking the Office of Under
graduate Admissions to lower its stan
dards so that she may feel more at
home?"
I found it quite funny that Schar
automatically equated the admission of
inner city youth with lowering Univer
sity standards.
Well, Schar and other like-minded
people, I pose this question to you: On
what basis do you assume that Stanford
must lower its standards to admit more
inner city youth? Or, to turn this ques
tion around, what makes you think that
inner city youth cannot meet Stanford's
standards?
On one point I will agree with you. It
is my opinion (and note that I say opin-

ion, not fact) that universities like Stan
ford should not admit those without the
ability to handle the rigors of higher edu
cation. But I define ability as the capac
ity to learn, not the amount or quality of
previous education.
Before you decide that inner city
youth do not have ability, you need con
sider two possible reasons why there are
not more inner city youth here:
1. Some inner city schools in this
nation do not adequately prepare their
students to pass the selection process for
admission to an institution like Stanford.
Why do a good number of these young
people not attend anyway?
Affordability — the majority of people
in this nation, much less those of the
inner city, cannot afford a school like
Stanford.
Because of lack of wealth, talented
bright young people are systematically
excluded from the educational benefits of
Stanford.
2. Many inner city schools do indeed
lack a quality curriculum.
Yes, it is a national problem that
needs to be addressed. And no, Stanford
should not have to attempt to rectify the
problems of a nation by admitting all in
— that would not solve the problem at

But should a student with full capa
bility and desire to undertake a higher
education be denied the opportunity to
do so because her school did not offer the
language course or the science course
that was needed for her to look like "a
strong candidate" on her application?
We have all, unwittingly or wittingly,
played by the unspoken rules of admis
sions to get here. But not all people have
the resources and tools available to play
the admissions game and win.
To make assumptions about people
based on stereotypes and generalizations
is a dangerous activity. It causes trouble.
Because I am a person of color, I have
been on the receiving end of such
assumptions myself.
When I transferred to a school here in
California several years ago, despite my
previous educational background and my
good grade record, I was looked over,
given a "test," and promptly put into a
math class three levels below my math
knowledge and ability.
When I sought to be put into the
highest math class in the school, I was
given a sweet, patronizing smile and the
message, "We don't think you can handle
the rigors of a higher math class."

After two quarters of fighting with
the school structure, I was slowly moved
up to the class. Not only did I "handle
the rigors" of that math class, I finished
it with an A.
Stanford prides itself on evaluating
students not by numbers and letters
only, but by considering the sum totality
of each person and his or her accom
plishments.
It is the obligation of the Admissions
Office to implement an admissions pro
cess that evaluates a student based solely
on his ability and desire to learn and the
quality of his character.
How will that be evaluated? That is
the responsibility of the Admissions
Office.
But education is the giving of knowl
edge, and no one should prevent any per
son willing and able to learn.
It is an ideal, Utopian concept, yet
Stanford should certainly work towards
that goal. And Schar, as well as the rest
of us, can make a step towards that goal
by dropping the negative assumptions
about different groups and investigating
the individuals in those groups for their
true talents and worth.
