# Organizers should have sought Hoover expertise for forum
## 
### 
I think the students who organized
the Gulf war teach-in at Kresge are sell
ing the Hoover Institution short.
Hoover is a great research institution
and its particular fields of expertise are
war, revolution and peace. The scholars
at the Institution are well able to hold a
successful conference to support both
sides of any war dispute.

So, to invite a computer expert whose
opinion is not disciplined by years of
study to speak at the teach-in — a man
who advances the "shoot the messenger"
theory that the Vietnam War was lost
because of dissent in the United States,
and thus prepares in advance excuses for
the failure of the present war — is to
denigrate scholarship and research.
President Bush and Rep. Tom Camp
bell, R-Stanford, deserve better than to
have what is purported to be "their" side
of the story so poorly presented.
