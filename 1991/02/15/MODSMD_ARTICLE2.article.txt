# Spiders crawl by Brannerites

### Julie Cantor 
Enormous, hairy-legged creatures crawling over
an unsuspecting body. Spiders in the bathtub, spi
ders on the wall, spiders under the kitchen table.
For many arachnaphobic people, these scenes are
terrible nightmares, but for Jules Sylvester, they are
movie scenes for which he supplies the spiders.
Last night in a packed Branner Hall lounge,
Sylvester shared his specialty with a boisterous
crowd. Born and raised in Kenya, he said he became
interested in spiders and other animals because
"there was no TV. There was nothing else out there"
to do.
Using only a spatula, tongs and his bare hands, he
placed a zebra-legged tarantula onto the floor as the
audience circled around him. Shrieks emanated from
the audience as the blew on the creature, causing it
to scamper across the floor. Though this Peruvian
spider looked gigantic at nine inches long, the self
proclaimed "Spider Wrangler" said "some can get to
be 18 inches."
While this particular spider was "rather gentle . .
. but very fast," Sylvester displayed two other taran
tulas that he called "quite aggressive." These spi
ders, although they do not bite often, possess half
inch-long fangs that can go through a person's fin
ger.
Sylvester's tarantulas have been a crucial part of
more than 60 films, including "Arachnaphobia" and
"A Nightmare on Elm Street, Part IV. " In addition to
spiders, Sylvester trains many other animals, from
the scorpion he also showed the audience to the lion
who roared at River Phoenix in "Indiana Jones and
the Last Crusade."
His business, Reptile Rentals, is also the only one
in Hollywood that specializes in snakes. In "Indiana
Jones," Sylvester said he used over 3,000 garter
snakes and 2,000 plastic snakes for a chase scene on
a moving train. Amazingly, the scene took over 13
hours to film, but the actual footage in the movie
lasts only 14 seconds, he noted.
Sylvester said he makes sure
that "nothing gets killed" because
of filming. He added that he care
fully watches his animals so
overzealous actors do not acciden
tally trample tarantulas or smash
spiders.

One snake, the King
Cobra, 'has enough
venom to drown you.'

Following the live presentation,
he showed pictures of tarantulas
and snakes in a slide show. One
snake, the King Cobra, "has
enough venom to drown you," he
said.
These cobras can grow up to 18
feet in length, and when they rise
up, they can be six feet tall.
Sylvester said it's not fun to look a
fully grown King cobra in the eye.
Although working on a movie
set may seem glamourous,
Sylvester noted that being a spider
trainer is not an easy job.
