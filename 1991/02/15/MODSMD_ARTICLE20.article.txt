# Professor encourages faculty and students to continue teach-in
## 
### 
The teach-in on the Middle East and
the war was splendid, but it presented
more information than anyone could
fully assimilate in such concentrated
form.
What we need now is some form of
ongoing teach-in.
Attendance at the lectures and forumi
three weeks ago revealed what hunger

there is for information, both on back
> ground and current events.
Apparently, students and faculty at
UC-Berkeley have collaborated in orga
nizing such an ongoing series of unoffi
cial classes, lectures and study groups.
Surely it could happen here as well, if
those who agree it is needed would voice
their demand and work together to orga
nize it.
In my opinion, the University itself
ought to be assisting and endorsing such
a continuation — an unlikely eventuali
ty!
