## Pathetic Guys — unite! 
### 
Attention all pathetic guys!
We at the Institute for Examining
the Social and Political Ramifica
tions of Everything have decided that you
may not fully understand the effects of
identifying with our first column. You fail
to realize the insidious implications of
putting our column on your door, or
approaching us, saying things like,
"Dude, I am Pathetic and am damn proud
of it, thank you!"
As innocent as it all seemed, you actu
ally placed yourself in a category that we
created. You accepted an identity for
yourself without full knowledge of every
thing the identity entails.
We know we made Pathetic Guys seem
like studly, romantic sex gods. The reac
tion of many others on campus to this
new category of males is not entirely pos
itive. In fact, they don't like us.
As you made animal sacrifices in our
name, others on campus were slicing up
the Pathetic Guy. They said the Pathetic
Guy is a hypocrite; his sensitivity is a
scam to make himself feel he is better
than others.
He "guilts" women into giving him
attention by telling them that they have a
problem. His claim of liberation is a lie —
he only pursues the women that society
has defined as attractive and valuable. He
is an immature, Machiavellian objectifier
with an inferiority complex.
We are sorry to tear down the icon. We
know you are saying to yourself, "If I
can't live and be respected as a Pathetic
Guy, then I would prefer not to live at
all."
Calm down.

Take a Valium, get a hug, grab your
woobie and go to bed. It is not your fault
that you did not know what you were get
ting into. Many people don't understand
how identifying themselves with a group
affects other people.
The nature of a group is that it has
limited membership — it divides people
into members and non-members. The cri
teria for this division is the possession of
certain characteristics. Identifying with a
group separates you from the non-mem
bers — it says you have those characteris
tics.
People form a group because they wish
to validate their shared characteristics.
The group does so by celebrating these
characteristics (e.g. Independence Day, a
celebration of democratic ideals for the
group known as the United States). Our
column was a celebration of Pathetic
Guys' characteristics. We affirmed the
value of the Pathetic Guy, achieving vali
dation for those who define themselves as
Pathetic Guys.
If, however, a group celebrates its iden
tifying characteristics, it is implied in the
celebration that non-members are less
valuable because they lack the same char
acteristics. Our particular celebration,
the column, blatantly stated that we see
non-Pathetic Guys as worse than us.
The non-members will lash out against
the group. They do so in self-defense.
Since the process of identification is also
an attack on those who can't identify, can
non-members be criticized for responding
as they do?
We believe that we all must take
responsibility for our actions. If we create

antagonists by identifying with a particu
lar group, we must accept their right to
exist.
We cannot derive validation by cele
brating the group's positive characteris
tics and then ignore criticism of the
group's negative characteristics.
Every group is defined by the charac
teristics and behavior of its members.
When you marry yourself to the group
identity, you can not divorce yourself
from the actions of other members of the
group. Within the context of the group,
their actions define you as much as your
actions define you. As a member of a
group, you have responsibility for the
actions of all other members.
We must stress, however, that accep
tance of responsibility is not acceptance of
guilt. Accepting responsibility is realizing
that you are a just target of criticism. You
are not, however, the just target of blame.
One can realize the faults inherent in
one's group without having to apologize
for them. You must either deal with the
criticism or work to change the group's
identity.

Andrew Katz and Kofi Bruce ponder an
age-old question. The person who discov
ered milk comes from cows — what
exactly was this person doing when he
