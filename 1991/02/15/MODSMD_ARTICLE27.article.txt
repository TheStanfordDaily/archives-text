# Büg derides jugglers, pirates and welders

### John Ott Staph Writher 
Last week I delved into the myster
ies of McDonaldland and fornication.
"All well and good," you say to yourself
as you sit in Annenberg Auditorium,
waiting for your Human Biology lec
ture to rev up, "but, gosh, Bug, how
does all this relate to me? How about
answering some questions that really
hit home, that truly monitor the pulse
of the Stanford community?"
Well, intrepid reader, look no fur
ther. Buckle on that snazzy biking hel
met and brace yourself for a new
sociopolitical awareness.
Dear Bug,
I live in Blackwelder, and I've
always wondered what sort of bizarre
material the ceilings are made of. I
once threw something up there and

particles came down like a snowstorm.
I've heard conflicting reports about
whether it is or isn't asbestos. I'll ask
you since you are known as the FINAL
authority on these matters.

Dear Wildly Curious,
Before I start revealing any power
ful truths, I'd like to turn the tables on
you, o eager inquisitor, and send a few
zingers your way.
What kind of name is Blackwelder
anyway? The "Flashdance" theme
house? A tribute to some marauding
17th-century pirate?
And just what are you doing tossing
"something" (A bowling ball? Some
hapless marsupial? One of the Hardy
boys?) at your potentially lethal ceil
ing, risking a private nuclear winter
apocalypse?
Do you want to get cancer in your
eye? Do you relish the idea of hemor
rhaging uncontrollably from every
infected orifice because you couldn't
kick some arcane juggling fetish? If
you're going to flirt with the Grim
Reaper, why not do something a little

more romantic and theatrical, like set
ting yourself on fire, or having yourself
torn asunder by wild horses?
Lucky for you, the helpful folks at
Housing's Maintenance Division told
me you won't be breaking out into
some leprous rash or coughing up
internal organs any time soon.
Susan and Chuck informed me that
the "cottage cheese stuff" on your ceil
ing is a Sprayed Acoustic Material
(SpAM?) that contains only 1 percent
to 3 percent crystalline asbestos, which
they are in the process of replacing.
So keep on practicing for the 1992
Olympic Darts Competition or what
ever you're doing out there. Just don't
start pulling the stuff down and serv
ing it as pate or pumping it intra
venously into your bloodstream.
And for God's sake, get a hobby or
something.
