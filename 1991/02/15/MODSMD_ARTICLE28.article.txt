# Tired of lubricating the ol' chain?

Technology has pro
duced some pretty amazing
things. It's given us afford
able, miniature radioactive ovens,
capable of reducing small animals
to their basic constituents. It's
made bombs smarter than the
person who discovered how to fold
Kleenexes so they come out of the
box one at a time. And, of course,
it's created the ever-popular Salad
ShooterÂ®.
Hard to believe it's also respon
sible for my bike.
I bought my bike at the begin
ning of freshman year and quickly
developed the theory that the less
I cared about it, the less money I'd
spend on it.
So, as the quarters rolled by,
my bike progressed from a brand
new, ten-speed mountain bike, to
the rusty, one-speed eyesore it is
today. The back tire has gotten so
warped that it scrapes against the
frame; the only time the chain
gets lubricated is when it rains.
You know the type.
For a while, my bike was at the
point where I didn't change gears
because I was afraid of what
might happen. But lately, my bike
has gotten the crazy idea of
changing gears itself.
Unfortunately, it never finds a
gear that it's happy with for more
than two seconds, which makes
pedaling rather difficult. It also
produces a noise similar to how
The Claw would sound if it were
audible.

The only person who
would steal my bike is
a blind kleptomaniac.

Not that I pay any attention to
these noises. Like many guys, I
ignore all strange sounds that a) I
don't understand, or b) might
cost me money.
Instead, I'm content to ride
along at speeds slower than the
line at the Dan Quayle Memorial
Post Office, unless I'm in a hurry,
in which case I get off and walk.
But who needs a fast bike any
way? Every time I go to class I get
caught in crowded bike jams that
resemble a bunch of retarded
trout during spawning season.
Luckily, due to my minuscule
speed, I don't even have to slow
down.
This is a good thing, due to the
fact that the fingernail-on-a
blackboard noise produced by my
brakes has been known to kill
small animals up to 50 feet away.
And there are other advantages
to riding a contraption that's
every mechanic's nightmare.
For example, all you people
who own fancy functional bikes
waste vast amounts of time lock
ing them to trees, those handy
bike "racks" and your fellow class
mates.
But I have no need for this.
The only person who would steal
my bike is a blind kleptomaniac
with a strange affinity for rust.

Another good thing about my
bike is that I don't have to worry
about getting in any serious acci
dents. This was a typical problem
during freshman year (safety tip:
bollards don't swerve), but now
the only thing I have to worry
about is people crashing into me.
People ask me why I don't just
walk to class, but I just feel too
exposed to other bikes. At any
moment, I could become just
another nameless road kill to be
scraped up by the recycling center.
In fact, when walking between
classes, I've found that the only
safe place to be is in the bike
lanes.
Strange as this may seem, it is
due to the stigma associated with
anyone who actually pays atten
tion to those little white lines.
"Gosh," people say, "That person
must be from Cal."
Another suggestion I've gotten
is to buy rollerblades. I dunno, but
I couldn't even handle the safer
looking roller skates. All I can
think of is Suzy Quinlan's sth
grade birthday party at the roller
rink, where I nearly severed my
left arm at the elbow after testing
out those funky rubber toe-stops.
(They work.)
Somehow, I can't see myself
gracefully rolling into class, espe
cially the one in that slanted audi
torium.
So I'll stick with my bike. After
all, it may be a worthless heap of
junk, but it's my worthless heap
of junk, and I'm going to keep it.
Unless, of course, they come
out with giant-sized Big Wheels.
