Frank Lloyd Wright and Sen. Joseph
McCarthy both spoke on or near Stanford cam
pus.
McCarthy suggested ousting all Communist
teachers from schools. "One Communist pro
fessor can do more damage than a spy in an
atom bomb plant," he said. Obviously, Sen.
McCarthy had never met a CIV professor.
Meantime, Wright slammed Memorial Audi
torium. Glancing at the high ceiling, he said,
"We are gathered here tonight in a vacuum
three times the size that would be necessary."
While there were no attendance figures for
Wright's talk, over 6,200 people clapped and
cheered on Sen. McCarthy.

Famed explorer Vilhjalmur Stefannson gave
a talk entitled "Transpolar Commerce By
Air,"always one of my favorite topics. By the
way, what kind of name is Vilhjalmur? Is it
another name for the Denver Boot?
"We are living in a northern civilization,"
Stefannson said. "Nearly all the great cities
and countries are in the north temperate
zone." Like Cleveland, for example.
"Therefore the power and culture of the
world is crammed up at the top of the world like
a tremendous doughnut," he continued. "At
the very center of the doughnut is a hole, the
Arctic."' Another hole would be Cleveland.
