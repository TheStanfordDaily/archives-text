# Navy and Stanford still cozy, Biddle says
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
Paul Biddle, the federal regulator whose
allegations of "coziness" sparked the indi
rect cost controversy at Stanford, now
believes the Navy's efforts to restore its
relationship with the University are tainted
as well.
Navy officials "still have a very cozy rela
tionship with Stanford," Biddle said in an
interview earlier this week. "I have no
doubt about that."
Biddle's comments were made a few days
after a report issued by the Inspector Gen
eral of the Office of Naval Research dis
counted some of the regulator's most seri
ous charges against Stanford, including his
claim that a tight relationship between the
government and the University had
allowed Stanford to over-recover $200 mil
lion in indirect costs during the last decade.
In December, the Chief of Naval
Research appointed a five-person team to
examine Biddle's concerns and restore the
Navy's working relationship with Stanford.
The Navy team, which includes Biddle,
essentially took over the functions that he

had previously been
entrusted with as the resi
dent representative of the
Office of Naval Research.
The team's charter
includes negotiating the
University's indirect cost
rate and examining past
cost agreements between
the two parties.
Since negotiations began,

Stanford's indirect cost rate has been
knocked down twice and currently sits at 70
percent — far below the 78 percent the Uni
versity originally proposed. The difference
will likely cost Stanford about $10 million
in revenue this year.
Even so, Biddle said, the head of the
Navy's negotiating team, John Ford, is not
being nearly as tough on Stanford as he
should be.
"I think John Ford tries to be so fair that
he ends up being cozy," Biddle said. "He's a
nice guy, but he's like the fickle lover — the
person who sticks his tongue in his ear last
is the one he's in love with."
