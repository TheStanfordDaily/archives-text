# Navy and Stanford still cozy, Biddle says
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
Paul Biddle, the federal regulator whose
allegations of "coziness" sparked the indi
rect cost controversy at Stanford, now
believes the Navy's efforts to restore its
relationship with the University are tainted
as well.
Navy officials "still have a very cozy rela
tionship with Stanford," Biddle said in an
interview earlier this week. "I have no
doubt about that."
Biddle's comments were made a few days
after a report issued by the Inspector Gen
eral of the Office of Naval Research dis
counted some of the regulator's most seri
ous charges against Stanford, including his
claim that a tight relationship between the
government and the University had
allowed Stanford to over-recover $200 mil
lion in indirect costs during the last decade.
In December, the Chief of Naval
Research appointed a five-person team to
examine Biddle's concerns and restore the
Navy's working relationship with Stanford.
The Navy team, which includes Biddle,
essentially took over the functions that he

had previously been
entrusted with as the resi
dent representative of the
Office of Naval Research.
The team's charter
includes negotiating the
University's indirect cost
rate and examining past
cost agreements between
the two parties.
Since negotiations began,

Stanford's indirect cost rate has been
knocked down twice and currently sits at 70
percent — far below the 78 percent the Uni
versity originally proposed. The difference
will likely cost Stanford about $10 million
in revenue this year.
Even so, Biddle said, the head of the
Navy's negotiating team, John Ford, is not
being nearly as tough on Stanford as he
should be.
"I think John Ford tries to be so fair that
he ends up being cozy," Biddle said. "He's a
nice guy, but he's like the fickle lover — the
person who sticks his tongue in his ear last
is the one he's in love with."

Ford "doesn't have enough dis
cernment to realize when he's
being hornswoggled" by Stanford,
Biddle said.
Ford declined to be interviewed
for this article, but Norm Hanson,
a spokesman for the Office of
Naval Research, said Biddle's alle
gation was off-base.
The Navy "has every confi
dence in Mr. Ford's ability," Han
son said. "You could hardly call a
$10 million reduction a cozy rela
tionship."
Larry Horton, Stanford's asso
ciate vice president for public
affairs, said Biddle's assertion of
coziness was "reckless and irre
sponsible."
"Negotiations are taking place
in a thoroughly professional and
businesslike manner," Horton
said.
Biddle contends that Ford, act
ing as head of the Navy's team,
should have immediately termi
nated all the "memoranda of
understanding" between Stanford
and the naval office. Some of
these accounting agreements
allow Stanford to charge the gov
ernment more for indirect costs
than would otherwise be possible
under government rules.
The Navy report released last
week found that many of the
agreements had not been properly
reviewed by higher-ranking Office
of Naval Research officials.
Eliminating the agreements
would drop Stanford's indirect
cost rate into the low 60 percent
range, Biddle said.
Biddle's position on the memo
randa of understanding, or
MOUs, is shared by the Depart
ment of Health and Human Ser
vices, a federal agency which plays

an oversight role similar to the
Navy's at other research universi
ties.
"We have concluded that the
MOUs are substantially out of
compliance with the cost princi
ples and have placed the govern
ment at a distinct advantage with
Stanford," wrote Health and
Human Services official David
Low. "Consequently, we recom
mend that the MOUs be termi
nated immediately."
The Defense Contract Auditing
Agency, the government agency
that audits Stanford's indirect
cost claims, has also recom
mended immediate termination of
the agreements, according to both
Low and Biddle.
But the Navy has adopted a dif
ferent posture in its official nego
tiating stance. All the memoranda
of understanding are being
reviewed by the two parties, but
they will remain valid until after
the review has been completed.
Immediately terminating the
agreements would neither be
"prudent" nor "fair to Stanford,"
said Hanson, the Navy public
affairs official.
"If you took them away, you're
unfairly penalizing Stanford" for
contracts the Navy has agreed to,
he said. The Navy "has to balance
the government's interests with
the University's interests and the
nation's interests."
Throughout the negotiation
process, Biddle said, the Navy has
been far too concerned about pro
tecting Stanford's interests for
fear of losing the University's
research contributions.
"We don't need Stanford's
brains," Biddle said. "We've got
MIT. We've got Berkeley. We've
got a bunch of schools around this
country. Stanford doesn't have a
corner on intelligence."
Despite the findings of the
naval office's Inspector General,

'We don't need Stan
ford's brains. We've
got MIT. We've got
Berkeley.'

Biddle still believes his estimate of
$200 million in overcharges for
the last decade is reasonable.
The report concluded that Bid
dle used "questionable logic and
very subjective judgment" to cal
culate his $200 million estimate.
But the report also noted that due
to lax regulation by Navy officials
in the past, there exists "the
potential for overpayment."
"What the report shows is an
organization that's doing touchy
feely with the contractor and try
ing to understand what the hell to
do now," Biddle said.
"I think the 'potential for over
payment' [finding] was a cover
your-ass approach. That's so [the
Navy] will not look like a dunce at
the end of the game when all this
money appears to be improperly
reimbursed," he said.
How much money the govern
ment will recover, Biddle said,
depends on how hard the Navy is
willing to negotiate. Biddle
warned University President
Donald Kennedy in a December
letter that Stanford could wind up

owing the government between
$69 million and $175 million.
"There's probably $69 million
of overcharges that there's no way
Stanford can deny or [the Navy]
can walk away from," Biddle said.
But, according to Biddle, the
burden falls squarely on the
shoulders of Ford, the head of the
Navy negotiating team. "John
Ford can rig the situation to
accommodate Stanford as easily
as he can go after Stanford to get
that money back for the American
taxpayers," Biddle said.
In the past, Kennedy has said
the possibility of some overpay
ment exists but insists Biddle's
estimates are "out of the ball
park."
For the time being, Biddle
remains a rather isolated figure in
the Office of Naval Research. He
said he feels "deep-sixed" by the
Navy's report and that his only
hope for a just end to this contro
versy rests with the House Sub
committee on Oversight and
Investigations.
The powerful subcommittee,
chaired by Rep. John Dingell, D-
Mich., has scheduled a hearing on
Stanford's indirect cost practices
for March 15.
"Dingell is the centerpiece,"
Biddle said. "Dingell is the key
stone. Dingoll is the only one who
can keep [the Navy] on track
through this."
