## Cardinal bursts Trojans' bubble in rematch, 92-76 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
The Stanford men's basketball team got
into the full swing of Valentine's Day last
night, as the Cardinal emphatically,
resoundingly and decisively told the USC
Trojans what they could kiss.
Riding several outstanding perfor
mances from the bench, yet another
workhorse effort from the Big Redhead and
total domination on the boards, the Cardi
nal snapped a two-game losing streak
against the Trojans with a crushing 92-76
win in front of 6,002 sometimes-noisy fans
at Maples Pavilion.

"I'm very, very pleased with that," said
Stanford coach Mike Montgomery, whose
team is now 14-9, 7-6 in the Pacific 10 Con
ference. "I've said all along that USC's a
good team, and so this game is obviously a
big win for us." The win keeps the Cardinal
in a tie for third in the Pac-10, a half-game
behind Washington State, which lost at
Oregon last night. The Trojans are 4-7 and
eighth in the Pac-10, 13-8 overall.
"This was by far our worst performance
in conference play this year," USC coach
George "Un" Raveling said. "We just didn't
have it tonight: They were the aggressors,
and they just took the game away from us."
No kidding. Just about everything went
right for the Cardinal last night: The bench
played almost perfectly; center Adam Keefe
got his customary 23 points and 11 boards;
John Patrick added 19; the front line
swarmed the glass to the tune of a 42-27
rebounding advantage; and Deshon
Wingate held USC superstar Harold "Baby
Jordan" Miner to four points in the second
half (Miner ended up with 20, but missed
12 of his 20 shots).
The Cardinal also finally remembered
how to shoot free throws (23-for-29), four

nine assists) almost came up with Stan
ford's first-ever triple-double. ...
Heck, did anything not go right?
Well, yes: The first 14 minutes were all
USC, as the Trojans took a 32-19 lead.
Miner hit his first six shots (with 6:11 to go
in the half he was scoring more than a point
a minute) and the Cardinal, thanks to
sloppy passing and poor transition defense,
wasn't getting the job done at either end of
the floor.
With six minutes left, however, the Tro
jans went into a coma — they would miss
their next seven shots — and the Cardinal
came to life. Spurred by two Kenny
Ammann three-pointers, a couple of
rebounds and a lot of steadiness from
reserve point guard Peter Dukes and a pair
of baskets from reserve forward Brent
Williams, the Cardinal went on a rollicking,
in-your-face 23-2 tear and headed for the
locker room up 44-37.
"Peter Dukes came in and gave us a big
lift," said Keefe, who spent most of the game
getting pounded on by five different USC
big men. "He made a couple great plays,
pulled down a couple big rebounds. ..."
"Pete's probably our best passer, and he
does a nice job reading the flow of the game
and running the offense," Montgomery
said. "He did a good job at that tonight."
The second-half bench contribution was
mostly from forward Paul Garrett, who had
a pair of buckets, a career high six rebounds
and two assists — one of them (at last!) a
Lob-to-Wingate dunk — as the Cardinal
turned a 67-62 lead with eight minutes to
go into an 84-65 laugher with 2:18 left.
Keefe had seven points and an assist during
the decisive run, as the Cardinal committed
absolutely zero turnovers against the USC
zone press.
"We really had a great contribution off
the bench tonight," Montgomery said. "We

found some guys who really helped us out,
passing the ball and playing hard. Garrett,
Dukes, Williams and (Marcus) Lollie (who
had six points and three assists): All the
guys who came in did a really good job."
In all, it might have been the Cardinal's
most complete team effort of the season. "I

told everyone after the Washington game
that this is a team thing," Montgomery
said. "We aren't going to have one set
lineup, because no one thing is going to
work against everyone. We're just going to
continue to get people in there and see what
they can do."

nine assists) almost came up with Stan
ford's first-ever triple-double. ...
Heck, did anything not go right?
Well, yes: The first 14 minutes were all
USC, as the Trojans took a 32-19 lead.
Miner hit his first six shots (with 6:11 to go
in the half he was scoring more than a point
a minute) and the Cardinal, thanks to
sloppy passing and poor transition defense,
wasn't getting the job done at either end of
the floor.
With six minutes left, however, the Tro
jans went into a coma — they would miss
their next seven shots — and the Cardinal
came to life. Spurred by two Kenny
Ammann three-pointers, a couple of
rebounds and a lot of steadiness from
reserve point guard Peter Dukes and a pair
of baskets from reserve forward Brent
Williams, the Cardinal went on a rollicking,
in-your-face 23-2 tear and headed for the
locker room up 44-37.
"Peter Dukes came in and gave us a big
lift," said Keefe, who spent most of the game
getting pounded on by five different USC
big men. "He made a couple great plays,
pulled down a couple big rebounds. ..."
"Pete's probably our best passer, and he
does a nice job reading the flow of the game
and running the offense," Montgomery
said. "He did a good job at that tonight."
The second-half bench contribution was
mostly from forward Paul Garrett, who had
a pair of buckets, a career high six rebounds
and two assists — one of them (at last!) a
Lob-to-Wingate dunk — as the Cardinal
turned a 67-62 lead with eight minutes to
go into an 84-65 laugher with 2:18 left.
Keefe had seven points and an assist during
the decisive run, as the Cardinal committed
absolutely zero turnovers against the USC
zone press.
"We really had a great contribution off
the bench tonight," Montgomery said. "We

found some guys who really helped us out,
passing the ball and playing hard. Garrett,
Dukes, Williams and (Marcus) Lollie (who
had six points and three assists): All the
guys who came in did a really good job."
In all, it might have been the Cardinal's
most complete team effort of the season. "I

told everyone after the Washington game
that this is a team thing," Montgomery
said. "We aren't going to have one set
lineup, because no one thing is going to
work against everyone. We're just going to
continue to get people in there and see what
they can do."

Brent Williams battles for a rebound against USC. Williams came off the bench to
spark the Cardinal and send them to a decisive victory over the Pac-10 rival Trojans.
The Stanford men's basketball team got
into the full swing of Valentine's Day last
night, as the Cardinal emphatically,
resoundingly and decisively told the USC
Trojans what they could kiss.
Riding several outstanding perfor
mances from the bench, yet another
workhorse effort from the Big Redhead and
total domination on the boards, the Cardi
nal snapped a two-game losing streak
against the Trojans with a crushing 92-76
win in front of 6,002 sometimes-noisy fans
at Maples Pavilion.

"I'm very, very pleased with that," said
Stanford coach Mike Montgomery, whose
team is now 14-9, 7-6 in the Pacific 10 Con
ference. "I've said all along that USC's a
good team, and so this game is obviously a
big win for us." The win keeps the Cardinal
in a tie for third in the Pac-10, a half-game
behind Washington State, which lost at
Oregon last night. The Trojans are 4-7 and
eighth in the Pac-10, 13-8 overall.
"This was by far our worst performance
in conference play this year," USC coach
George "Un" Raveling said. "We just didn't
have it tonight: They were the aggressors,
and they just took the game away from us."
No kidding. Just about everything went
right for the Cardinal last night: The bench
played almost perfectly; center Adam Keefe
got his customary 23 points and 11 boards;
John Patrick added 19; the front line
swarmed the glass to the tune of a 42-27
rebounding advantage; and Deshon
Wingate held USC superstar Harold "Baby
Jordan" Miner to four points in the second
half (Miner ended up with 20, but missed
12 of his 20 shots).
The Cardinal also finally remembered
how to shoot free throws (23-for-29), four
