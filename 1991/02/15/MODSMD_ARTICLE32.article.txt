# Streaky, streaky

Streaks or "runs" in basketball
are easy statistics to manipulate.
An 8-0 run by one team can be
sandwiched by a 16-8 run by the
other team. But in last night's
blowout of USC at Maples Pavil
ion, the Cardinal used two major
runs to first climb back into the
game and then put the game out
of reach for the Trojans.
USC struck first. Riding the
crest of a Harold Miner, "Will he
ever miss?" wave, the Trojans
went out ahead by 13, 32-19 with
six minutes to play. USC would
surely go into the locker rooms
with a comfortable lead.
In the next four and one half
minutes, Stanford took itself out
of neutral and revved up the
offense to outscore the Trojans
23-2.
"The really big run right before
the first half had to be the key to
giving us some self-confidence,"
Stanford Coach Mike Mont
gomery said.
Senior forward Deshon Win
gate had a lot to do with starting
the run in the first half and fin
ished the first 20 minutes with 10
points, six rebounds and an
astounding six assists. His passing
was a big reason Stanford's
offense was able to score 23 points
in just over four minutes.
"We started off a little slow,"
Wingate said. "We weren't quite
in sync. Then we got confidence
in ourselves. .. . We realized we
needed to get aggressive."
To start off the second period of
play, the Trojans had another
streak of their own, outscoring
the Cardinal 8-0 to retake the lead
at 45-44.
Stanford captured the lead
again immediately and built on it
gradually to enjoy a 63-58 advan
tage with 8:46 remaining.
But five points was too close for
comfort. The Cardinal launched a
17-4 run that put the contest out
of reach at 80-64. Slip it into
cruise control. Sixteen points was
the final margin of victory.
Forward Adam Keefe pointed
to reserves Peter Dukes and Paul
Garrett as the impetus for the two
big runs.
