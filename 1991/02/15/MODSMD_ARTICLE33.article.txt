# Tennis squares off against Cal, SDSU
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Like the typical Stanford
student, the women's tennis
team is facing midterms this
weekend. In the netters' case,
though, it's not the in-class
variety but the on-court type.
This weekend the Cardinal's de
facto exhibition season gets
pushed aside by the beginning
of the "hard part."
"This weekend will be our
toughest test of the season so
far," Stanford coach Frank
Brennan said. Today, the team
meets San Diego State at home
— easily its best competition in
1991. Tomorrow, the Cardinal
heads slightly north and east to
face the always-gritty Califor
nia Golden Bears, who sport a
national No. 5 ranking.
"They're always tough over
there," Brennan said of Cali
fornia. "They get some obnox
ious people to root and cheer
and jump up and down."
At least Stanford will be at
full strength for the first time
this season when the team
faces the Bears. Debbie Gra
ham's injured shoulder isn't
yet 100 percent, but she will
play Friday and Saturday
Despite being the defending
NCAA champion, Graham wiii
play No. 2 singles for Stanford
this season. Senior Sandra
Birch, the 1989 national titlist,
nosed out Graham for the top
spot in the lineup on the
strength of her performance in
the team's challenge matches.
Stanford has not played a
dual meet since Feb. 1. Much of
the team traveled to Minneapo

lis over the weekend for the
Rolex National Indoor. Though
no Stanford player captured
the singles title, Brennan rated
the trip "a good solid B."
Birch and Teri Whitlinger
reached the semifinals while
Heather Willens made it to the
quarters. Surprisingly, how
ever, Brennan was more
talkative about the doubles
action. "The thing that was
most encouraging to me was
the doubles play of Laxmi
Poruri," he said. "She's set
tling in and being more
assertive. She's not getting all
tangled up on the court."
Brennan added that he may
not make the trip to Minneapo
lis in the future. He said that
on the men's side, "Dick
(Gould, the men's coach)
pulled everybody out of it,"and
expressed concern about the
travel and missed school.
Besides, Brennan added, "You
get skewed results," as a result
of playing indoors.
Discussing the semifinal
losses of his players, he said, "I
don't want Sandra Birch to
think she's not as good as
Nicole Arendt. I don't want
Teri to think she can't beat
Shannan McCarthy."
Looking ahead, Brennan
noted that now was the time of
the year for the team to start
pulling together as a unit,
which should help them face
the tougher times ahead.
"But I still think player for
player we have the best team in
the country." This weekend,
the Cardinal will get its first
indications of just how true
that is.
