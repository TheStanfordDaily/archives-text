# Whiting, hoopsters battle USC tonight
## 
### David Hirning Senior staff writer 
In the paint, Val Whiting is an
opponent's worst nightmare.
Swatting shots away like flies,
soaring to snare improbable
rebounds and going to the basket
with quick grace, the 6-foot-3
sophomore forward is an intimi
dating presence on the court.
But on January 19, even Whit
ing was intimidated.
On the Maples floor that she
and her Cardinal teammates are
supposed to own, the defending
national champions saw the
shadow of USC's 6-5 freshman
Lisa Leslie. They flinched and
barely won the game, 77-69.
"I guess I played scared in that
game, afraid of getting my shot
blocked," Whiting said recently, as
she and her teammates prepared
for their rematch with the Tro
jans in Southern California
tonight at 7:30 p.m. "I think we
all did."
Although Whiting scored 13
points, had three blocked shots
and was the game's second-lead
ing rebounder with 14 boards, she
was overshadowed by the skinny
freshman with the smooth shot
and huge reputation. Leslie
turned in another of her "the
incredible becomes routine" per
formances, with 24 points, 20
rebounds and three blocks. One of
those blocks was at the expense of
Whiting.
That doesn't mean that Whit
ing is dreading tonight's rematch
with the Trojan 9. On the contrary,
the former Wilmington, Del. prep
star is more than up for it. In the
last contest, Whiting only guarded
Leslie in the first half, in which
the Trojan center had just six
points. Tonight, the two post play
ers may square off for most of the
game.
"I think I'll be playing against
her (tonight)," Whiting said.
"She's a great player—l played
with her in the summer."
In only her second season, how
ever, Valeria Whiting has become
something of a great player her
self. As a freshman last year, all
Whiting did was average a stellar
12.4 points and a team-leading 7.4
rebounds per game off the bench
on Stanford's NCAA champi

onship squad. She also set a Car
dinal record with 57 blocked shots
and was named the Pacific 10
Conference Freshman of the Year.

On January 19, even
Whiting was intimidat
ed. On the Maples
floor that she and her
Cardinal teammates
are supposed to own,
the defending nation
al champions saw the
shadow of USC's 6-5
freshman Lisa Leslie.

This season, the talented Whit
ing is beginning to come into her
own, with frightening results.
After beginning the season in her
former "sixth woman" role, Whit
ing has emerged as a star forward
and inside force that fuels Stan
ford's success.
"Val's really the key," Stanford
coach Tara VanDerveer said. "She
gives us our strongest rebound
ing, and without rebounding you
don't win anything."
Which isn't to say that Whiting
is not a scorer—her 13.3 ppg aver
age this year is not only
respectable, it is critical to the
team. But when Stanford fans
think of Val Whiting, they think of
rebounds. Big, swooping, arm
stretching, ball-snatching re
bounds.
"I like to rebound," Whiting
said. "I have the attitude that
every ball that goes up should be
mine."
It's hard to argue with her.
Whiting currently averages more
than nine boards a game, good for
fourth in the conference. On a
team where rebounding was a def
inite weakness in the first half of
the season and still presents some
problems, Whiting's value cannot
be measured in statistics.
With starting center Trisha
Stevens suffering from tendonitis
that limits her mobility, the Cardi


Val Whiting leads the Stanford basketball team against Pac-10 sen
sation Lisa Leslie and the rest of the Women of Troy tonight.
