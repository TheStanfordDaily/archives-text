# Tough test for volleyball
## 
### Kevin Jeffery Staff writer 
At least the Cardinal men's volleyball
team can take heart in the fact that,
after this weekend, the worst will be
over.
Beginning tonight, Stanford (5-2
overall, 4-1 WIVA) faces the #2, #9, and
#1 ranked teams in the country on a
brutal three-match tour of Southern
California.
The Cardinal will try to bounce back
from last weekend's dramatic five-game
loss to Pepperdine as they face Long
Beach State tonight, which leads the
Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Asso
ciation's Harry Wilson division with a 5-
0 record. On Saturday they face UCSB,
and on Monday they travel to Los Ange
les to face the defending national cham
pion USC Trojans, who are also unde
feated with a 3-0 mark.
This weekend's matches will have
more than a significant bearing on the
outcome of the Wilson division race.
Long Beach, USC, and Stanford are the
only real contenders for the title midway
through the season.
"Winning all three matches this
weekend would put us in great position
to win the division, because our next
games against Long Beach and USC
would be at home," said coach Ruben
Nieves.
Sophomore setter Jimmy Blackman

said, "A realistic goal for us would be to
win two out of three. But we had hopes
to come into this trip still undefeated in
league."
The loss to Pepperdine was not an
easy one for the Cardinal to swallow, as
it dropped them from 4th to Bth in the
polls and knocked them out of the Wil
son top spot. Last year they were
unbeaten in games in Burnham and
Maples Pavilion. But last year they
played only .500 ball on the road, and,
coming in to their first road trip of
the season, that is what captures Nieves'
concern.
"We need to be a much better road
club this year, and that's got to start in
Long Beach," Nieves said. The Cardinal
did defeat Long Beach in a best-of-three
match earlier this season in the UCSB
Tournament.
Unfortunately, a road victory could
prove to be a tall order, considering Stan
ford hasn't won in University Gym in
five years and that the 49ers have one of
their strongest teams in recent history.
That strength rests on the arms of
outstide hitter Brent Hilliard and middle
blocker Brett Winslow. Hilliard is aver
aging a potent 7.7 kills a game and will
get his more than his share of kill
attempts tonight. Winslow is hitting for
a tremendous percentage of .487, which
would surpass the all-time WIVA record
he established last season. Winslow also
leads the 49ers in digs and blocks.
