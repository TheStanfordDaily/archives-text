# Baseball to square off against Rice
## 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
With the pitching rotation settled
into a comfortable shutout pattern and
the hitters clear of their off-season cob
webs, the baseball team is ready for a
SiX-Pac practice run.
The second-ranked Cardinal (10-2)
take on unranked Rice (5-5) tomorrow
in the start of a three-game intersec
tional series that should prepare Stan
ford for its Pacific 10 Conference South
ern Division opener next Friday. Stan
ford opens Six-Pac play against powerful
Arizona State, last year's conference
runner-up and a pre-season No. 1 pick
by Baseball America.
Stanford carries a three-game win
ning streak and a two-game shutout
streak into the Rice series, while coach
David Miller's Owls appear a little off
balance after a 1-0 loss Tuesday to
Nicholls State.
"We've been trying to get Rice to
come out for a long time," said Cardinal
skipper Mark Marquess. "Last year they
had a good team but they tailed off at
the end of the season. They're one of the
top four teams in the Southwest Confer
ence, and it should be a good intersec
tional match-up."
"We're ready to go. Our pitchers are
fresh, and it should be a good series,"
Marquess continued.
"It will be the same as against Fuller
ton and Fresno," said Saturday's
starter, right-hander John Reid. "We
don't know anymore about them than
they do of us, so we'll just go out there

and play. I'll try to throw strikes and get
batters out early in the count."
The Owls were 33-29 last year and
finished sixth in the eight-team SWC
behind league champion Texas.
But so far in 1991 the Owls have
struggled, coming to town with an even
record and not-so-impressive losses to
Texas-Pan American (twice) and North
east Louisiana and a shutout at the
hands of Nicholls State.
Although they did score 20 runs in a
hard-fought victory over Hardin-Sim
mons, Rice has only hit three home runs
on the year, with slugger Jason Ogden
(.429, 1 HR, 11 RBI), pacing the Owl
attack.
Jim Miller, Darrell Richardson and
Chris Jones have carried the bulk of the
pitching weight for Rice, although none
has an earned run average below three.
Meanwhile, Stanford, which defeated
the University of San Francisco and
Cal-State Los Angeles this week by 10-0
and 7-0 margins, has already thrown as
many shutouts in 1991 — 4 — as it had
all last year when it set a school record

with 59 wins.
Pitching was the biggest question
mark at the beginning of the season, but
one week away from the open of league
play, the questions seem answered.
Collectively the staff is second in the
leage behind UCLA in pitching, with a
2.90 ERA and a healthy 23-to-67 walks
to-strikeouts ratio. Reid is second in
innings pitched and third in walks, Sun
day's starter Jamie Sepeda leads the
Six-Pac with a 1.00 ERA, and freshman
Willie Adams, who will start Monday's
finale, is tied for the league lead with
three wins and is third in strikeouts.
Card notes
Like many teams across the country,
Stanford will now have American flags sewn
onto its uniforms, in symbolic support of the
troops in the Persian Gulf.
"We put some pressure on Nine (Mar
quess) last weekend," said senior pitcher
John Reid. "It's a thing I think we've really
got to do. This is a liberal University and
everything, but we really should support the
troops."
