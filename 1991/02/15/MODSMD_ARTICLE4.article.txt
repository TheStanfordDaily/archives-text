# Kennedy wedding reception included in indirect cost billing
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
Congressional investigators
added yet another item yester
day to the list of embarrassing
expenditures Stanford has
included in its indirect cost
claims during the last decade
— a 1987 reception to intro
duce University President
Donald Kennedy's bride Robin
to the Stanford community.
The tab for the evening —
more than $17,500 — was
billed to the Board of Trustees
account, about a fifth of which
is charged to the government
as an indirect cost of research
here. University officials said

yesterday they plan to remove
the expense from Stanford's
bill to the government.
The reception, held at Lou
Henry Hoover House a week
and a half after the Kennedys'
wedding and attended by 400
people, was not among the
$500,000 in charges the Uni
versity announced last month
it would voluntarily withdraw
from its past claims.
Last month's move was
intended to avert public confu
sion that had arisen from reve
lations that flower arrange
ments, a cedar-lined closet and
a refurbished piano at Hoover
House had been included in the
University's cost claims. Accord
ingly, the operating expenses for
Hoover House and two other Uni
versity-owned residences were
withdrawn.
The reception "is the type of
activity that we intended to be
covered by the withdrawal," said
Larry Horton, associate vice pres
ident for public affairs. But
because the expense was billed to

the Trustees' account, it was not
initially removed, he said.
A congressional investigator,
however, said the charge was
"ridiculous."
"It's another example of a cost
that has nothing to do with
research," she said.
The reception bill included
$8,300 for catering, $5,100 for
the rental of tents and heaters,
$2,700 for champagne flutes and
silver trays, $1,100 for liquor and
$700 for shuttle service between
the Wilbur parking lot and
Hoover House, according to the
congressional investigator.
