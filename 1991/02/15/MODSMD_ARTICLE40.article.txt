Stanford will showcase four of its
newest guns and some of its proven
hardware as well at the 44th-Annual
Hobee's Nor Cal Intercollegiate Tennis
Championships at Stanford Tennis Sta
dium today through Monday.
Senior co-captain Glenn Solomon will
lead the Cardinal contingent into this
weekend's event as the top seed in a
large singles field. "I've kind of had an
up-and-down early season, so I'm hop
ing to just go out there and play some
consistent tennis," Solomon said.
"Being the top seed doesn't really mat
ter to me that much. I've still got to play
good tennis every day I'm out there."
"Glenn deserves that No. 1 seeding,"
Coach Dick Gould added. "Not every
time does the No. 1 seed come through,
but Glenn's a tremendous competitor.
He's as tough as lanyone] to beat."
Senior Ail-American Jason Yee, the
No. 5 seed in singles, sees this weekend
as a good warm-up for the all-important
National Team Indoors Feb. 21-24 in
Louisville, Ky. "This tournament is a

great way to get some matches in before
the Team Indoors. There definitely will
be some good tennis out here," Yee said.
Yee will team with Stanford No. 1
Alex O'Brien in the doubles competi
tion. The tandem, which was ranked as
high as second in the country earlier in
the season, is seeded first at this week
end's tourney. O'Brien is a two-time
defending singles champion in this com
petition, although he will not play sin
gles this weekend.
But the upperclassmen will not be
alone. Stanford tennis fans will get their
first taste of some of the most dominant
freshmen in the country, specifically
Chris Cocotos, Robert Devens, Michael
Flanagan, and Vimal Patel. All four will
be competing in this weekend's singles
tournament.
"For us to win the national champi
onship this year, some of these fresh
men are going to have to step up. We're
still looking for one of them to do just
that," Gould said. "This tournament
will give them a good chance to prove
something to us."
"We want to see how these younger
guys respond to pressure. We'll get a

good chance to see that during the com
petition this weekend," Asst. Coach
John Whitlinger added.
All four freshmen are aggressive
players, but Gould and Whitlinger said
they are trying to get them to attack
even more. Cocotos was the No. 1-
ranked junior singles player in the coun
try in 1989, Patel No. 4, Flanagan No. 6,
and Devens No. 32.
Sophomore superstar Jared Palmer
will combine with senior co-captain Dan
Turbow to form Stanford's second dou
bles team. They are seeded second.
Cocotos.
Several of the top collegiate players
from the Northern California area will
be participating this weekend. All four
year college players are eligible to com
pete, regardless of the division in which
they play. California will send several
players, including Carl Chang, the No. 2
seed, and Pete Fitzpatrick, the No. 6
seed.
"There should be some great tennis
out there [at Stanford Tennis Sta
dium]," Whitlinger said. "There's a wide
array of talent, and this tournament is
usually very good."
