# Gymnasts will try to rebound this weekend

The Stanford women's gymnastics team
headed off to Arizona yesterday for the South
west Cup tonight in Tempe. Stanford will be
joined by Cal State-Fullerton, Utah State, and
host Arizona State at the meet, a talent
packed competition.
Coming off of a disheartening loss to Wash
ington for a second-place finish at last week
end's home meet, the women are prepared for
a tough battle in Tempe tonight.
"The team spirit is good," freshman Kerri
Kanuka, the Cardinal's top all-arounder, said.

"We had a meeting this week and talked about
what didn't happen last week, so I think that
we are all back in the competition mode
again."
Despite the team's optimism, the South
west Cup will be anything but an easy meet for
Stanford, as the gymnasts take on three very
strong and capable teams. Both Arizona State
and Cal State-Fullerton have proven them
selves as perrenial powerhouses in collegiate
gymnastics over the past several years.
Last year, Stanford ended the season with
an 0-2 record against Arizona State, and an 0-
3 record against Cal State-Fullerton. At the
first meet of this year's season, the Cardinal

lost to Cal State-Fullerton again.
Stanford, with an unusually small team,
will have to count on everyone to perform her
best in order to come out with a win tonight.
Kanuka, as well as freshman Kerrie Kelley,
should lead the team in the all-around compe
tition, with Kanuka dominating on the floor
and Kelley shining on the balance beam.
Despite last week's second-place finish,
there have been few changes in the women's
routines during the week. Rather than adding
more difficult tricks, the team focused on their
execution and consistency instead. "We will
have to hit everything and really do well," Kel
ley said.
