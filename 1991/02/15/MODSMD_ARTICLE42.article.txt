### Gretchen Atwood Staff writer 
Today the Stanford track
team travels to Nevada for the
last indoor meet of the season.
Although focusing on the
upcoming Bay Area Invita
tional the team could qualify
several members this weekend
for the NCAA Championships
"Two or three people have a
chance to qualify in the long
jump," said head coach Brooks
Johnson, "Chryste [Gaines]
already provisionally qualified
in the 60. She also has a chance
in the 200 and so does Rhonda
Oliver."
The Reno meet draws
schools from all over the West
Coast. "Reno is at altitude, and
it's the largest undersized
track that you can use to qual
ify," Johnson said, "A lot of
teams from the West who have
people they want to get quali
fied from the 800 down will be
there and also some 19-foot
pole vaulters, so it should be a
very keen competition."
The Cardinal proved them
selves capable of scoring well
indoors two weeks ago at the
Louisiana State University
Indoor Classic. Gaines won the
55 meters in 6.87 seconds, one
one-hundredth of a second off
the NCAA qualifying time.
James "Sting" Cramton set
a Stanford school record of
48.21 while taking second in
the 400 meters. "In a lot of
ways it was my best race since

junior year of high school. I
was more focused," Cramton
said.
The team sent only 10
women and eight men to the
meet, which included Texas,
Alabama, and Texas A&M.
Although short on quantity
the Cardinal were long on
quality as the women placed
fifth and the men tied for sev
enth.
"We don't put a lot of
emphasis on the indoor season.
For other teams it is blood and
guts," said asst. coach Betsy
Riccardi.
"We are trying to build a
more broad-based team, a bet
ter dual-meet team," said
Johnson, "That seems to be
the wave of the future, and we
have to play catch-up."
. Propelling the women to the
top five was a one-two finish in
the mile. Melanie Bloch won,
and Ashley Black took second.
Black was also the runner-up
in the half mile. Jackie
Edwards finished third in the
long jump and Oliver placed in
both the 200 and 400 meters.
Several top three finishes
spurred the men. Marcus Hick
erson took second in the long
jump. Mark Mastalir was run
ner-up in the mile while Alex
Accetta finished fifth. Accetta
also placed in the 500 meter.
"We were pleased with the
collective effort of the team.
They had great spirit," said
Riccardi.
