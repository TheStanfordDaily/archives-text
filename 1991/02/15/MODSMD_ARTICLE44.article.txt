# Metz, women's swimming face No. 3 Cal
## Squad counting on team unity to topple Cal in Weenieland 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Normally, when Stanford and
California compete, it's a very big
deal. And when both teams are
ranked among the nation's top
three, the competition is even
keener.
Or is it? When the top-ranked
Cardinal women's swim team
meets the No. 3 Golden Bears in
Berkeley tomorrow, it will not
only be a match-up between two
long-time rivals, but it will also be
the final dual meet for Stanford's
seniors. Coming a week after a
win over then-No. 1 Texas and
five weeks before the NCAA
Championships, however, it is
almost lost in the shuffle.
"I'm not getting too sentimen
tal about my last home meet or
my last dual meet," senior Barb
Metz says. "There's still so much
to do. There are still so many
things we as a team need to
accomplish in the next six weeks."
At that time Metz and her
teammates will see the Lady
Longhorns again. And while Stan
ford defeated its arch-rival in a
dual meet last year, Texas came
back to beat the Cardinal and win
the NCAA title.
Stanford is hoping that the
Lady Longhorns will be unable to
duplicate that feat despite their
strength in the sprints and great
depth. In addition to numerous
talented swimmers, the Cardinal
hopes to have another advantage

— a camaraderie few, if any, other
teams have.
"I don't feel like we're forcing
team unity or team functions on
anybody," Metz says."I feel that
people aren't doing things
together because they have to, but
because they want to. I think we
have to have that extra edge at
NCAAs.
"When we pick who we want to
room with at Pac-lOs or, for dual
meets, when the coaches put us
together, there's not one person I
wouldn't want to room with. I'd
like to spend more time with each
one of them. I think that says a lot
about the team."
Through her first three-plus
seasons, Metz has contributed to
the Cardinal both in and out of
the pool. She is a seven-time Ail-
American and placed third in the
1,650-yard freestyle at the NCAA
Championships in 1989, helping
the Cardinal to the team title.
And despite all that success she
feels 1991 will be her best season
yet. "I'm training faster than I
have the previous years," she
says. "I'd say my dual-meet times,
on the average, are faster. I think
knowing that at NCAAs, 'This'll

be my last short-course mile I'll
ever swim,' that's going to make
me go that much faster."
But Metz is must more than
just someone who gets in a pool
and swims fast. As one of four
seniors, she also realizes she has a
role as a leader to fill.
"I guess I have a responsibility
to the team, to put something
back into it," she says. "I've
learned so much from the people
on the team throughout my first
three years. I don't want to say I
feel an obligation to pay the team
back; I just feel I want to, for all
the things I've gotten out of it.
"I guess I like to lead by exam
ple instead of leading by telling
people. I like to be more of a pas
sive leader, if that's not contradic
tory. Some of the freshmen, who
haven't been to a lot of big meets
before, I think they can gain wis
dom and experience through the
seniors and the other people on
the team so they don't have to
learn the hard way."
And all those experiences will
give Metz more to remember
Stanford by than a diploma and
All-America certificates. "There's
no question it's the best thing for

me here," she says."The people
here make the place.
"There are so many things I
didn't get to do while I was here. I
got a lot out of swimming, and I
don't regret it for a second, but
there are sacrifices you make. I've
never been on a dorm ski trip. I
thought that would be fun. I've
never taken a seminar that goes
from 3:15 to 5:05.
"But on the flip side, I have got
ten to travel and see a lot of differ
ent schools, and I know that we
have the most beautiful campus.
And I have gotten to represent the
school. It's kind of like the high
school spirit thing — it makes you
feel good."
But while Metz reflects on her
Stanford career, she realizes she
still has the finishing touches to
add. After losing to Texas last
year, she'd like nothing better
than to beat them in her final col
legiate competition.
"It's not revenge," she says."I
guess I just want to prove it to
people. We were undoubtedly the
better team last year — it just
didn't come out. I guess I just
want to prove to people that we
yy
are.

ten to travel and see a lot of differ
ent schools, and I know that we
have the most beautiful campus.
And I have gotten to represent the
school. It's kind of like the high
school spirit thing — it makes you
feel good."
But while Metz reflects on her
Stanford career, she realizes she
still has the finishing touches to
add. After losing to Texas last
year, she'd like nothing better
than to beat them in her final col
legiate competition.
"It's not revenge," she says."I
guess I just want to prove it to
people. We were undoubtedly the
better team last year — it just
didn't come out. I guess I just
want to prove to people that we
yy
are.

Barb Metz and the rest of the Stanford women's swimming team will try to continue their winning ways
this weekend against Berkeley. Metz, a senior freestyle specialist, has consistently provided leadership
for the Cardinal throughout her tenure on the Farm. She is one of four seniors who will be competing in;
their last collegiate home meet.
Normally, when Stanford and
California compete, it's a very big
deal. And when both teams are
ranked among the nation's top
three, the competition is even
keener.
Or is it? When the top-ranked
Cardinal women's swim team
meets the No. 3 Golden Bears in
Berkeley tomorrow, it will not
only be a match-up between two
long-time rivals, but it will also be
the final dual meet for Stanford's
seniors. Coming a week after a
win over then-No. 1 Texas and
five weeks before the NCAA
Championships, however, it is
almost lost in the shuffle.
"I'm not getting too sentimen
tal about my last home meet or
my last dual meet," senior Barb
Metz says. "There's still so much
to do. There are still so many
things we as a team need to
accomplish in the next six weeks."
At that time Metz and her
teammates will see the Lady
Longhorns again. And while Stan
ford defeated its arch-rival in a
dual meet last year, Texas came
back to beat the Cardinal and win
the NCAA title.
Stanford is hoping that the
Lady Longhorns will be unable to
duplicate that feat despite their
strength in the sprints and great
depth. In addition to numerous
talented swimmers, the Cardinal
hopes to have another advantage

— a camaraderie few, if any, other
teams have.
"I don't feel like we're forcing
team unity or team functions on
anybody," Metz says."I feel that
people aren't doing things
together because they have to, but
because they want to. I think we
have to have that extra edge at
NCAAs.
"When we pick who we want to
room with at Pac-lOs or, for dual
meets, when the coaches put us
together, there's not one person I
wouldn't want to room with. I'd
like to spend more time with each
one of them. I think that says a lot
about the team."
Through her first three-plus
seasons, Metz has contributed to
the Cardinal both in and out of
the pool. She is a seven-time Ail-
American and placed third in the
1,650-yard freestyle at the NCAA
Championships in 1989, helping
the Cardinal to the team title.
And despite all that success she
feels 1991 will be her best season
yet. "I'm training faster than I
have the previous years," she
says. "I'd say my dual-meet times,
on the average, are faster. I think
knowing that at NCAAs, 'This'll

be my last short-course mile I'll
ever swim,' that's going to make
me go that much faster."
But Metz is must more than
just someone who gets in a pool
and swims fast. As one of four
seniors, she also realizes she has a
role as a leader to fill.
"I guess I have a responsibility
to the team, to put something
back into it," she says. "I've
learned so much from the people
on the team throughout my first
three years. I don't want to say I
feel an obligation to pay the team
back; I just feel I want to, for all
the things I've gotten out of it.
"I guess I like to lead by exam
ple instead of leading by telling
people. I like to be more of a pas
sive leader, if that's not contradic
tory. Some of the freshmen, who
haven't been to a lot of big meets
before, I think they can gain wis
dom and experience through the
seniors and the other people on
the team so they don't have to
learn the hard way."
And all those experiences will
give Metz more to remember
Stanford by than a diploma and
All-America certificates. "There's
no question it's the best thing for

me here," she says."The people
here make the place.
"There are so many things I
didn't get to do while I was here. I
got a lot out of swimming, and I
don't regret it for a second, but
there are sacrifices you make. I've
never been on a dorm ski trip. I
thought that would be fun. I've
never taken a seminar that goes
from 3:15 to 5:05.
"But on the flip side, I have got
ten to travel and see a lot of differ
ent schools, and I know that we
have the most beautiful campus.
And I have gotten to represent the
school. It's kind of like the high
school spirit thing — it makes you
feel good."
