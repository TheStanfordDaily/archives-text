# Alcohol program proposed for frosh
## 
### Connie Chang Editorial staff 
The Interfraternity Council proposed
a new alcohol-awareness program for
Freshman Orientation Week at its
biweekly meeting Wednesday night.
Called the "Freshman Alcohol Re
sponsibility and Management Pro
gram," the Orientation event would be
coordinated by fraternities and sorori
ties under the guidelines of the Inter
sorority Council and the IFC.
"Two women and two men would
each go as a team to two freshman (dor
mitories] and present the material from
several different sources, including . . .
individual Greek members' experiences
here at Stanford," the proposal states.

Sophomore Mike Curry, a member of
the Delta Tau Delta fraternity, said he
made the proposal because "many who
enter Stanford have had little exposure
to the problems that occur with the
widespread use of alcohol here on cam
pus."
He added that he thinks the adminis
tration would support the Greek com
munity's sponsorship of a program
about responsible drinking.
In his proposal, Curry also said the
program would "give credibility to the
sorority and fraternity system."
"This is the perfect opportunity for
the Greek system to bolster its image
and give something back to the Stanford
community. Hopefully, it will help
silence critics who claim that we only

serve a social purpose on campus," he
wrote.
The IFC and ISC have tried to spon
sor Orientation programs in the past,
but Orientation Week coordinators have
not put either organization exclusively
in charge of any single program, Curry
said.
Also at Wednesday night's meeting,
copies of the new IFC alcohol policy
were passed out, and fraternities were
urged to submit their individual alcohol
policies.
As part of the IFC policy, each frater
nity is responsible for detailing specific
procedures it will take to implement the
overall policy guidelines.
In addition, IFC Vice President
Keith Rabois, a senior, announced
last night that Greek Week — in
which fraternities and sororities
sponsor a variety of games and
contests — will take place despite
the stricter alcohol policies.
Greek Week "is designed to fos
ter spirit and camaraderie within
the Greek community," said IFC
public relations officer Jim Lam
bright. He added that last year "it
didn't go that well because people
didn't know about it, so it wasn't
well-attended."
Last year, the organizers'
"overall goal was to raise money
for AIDS awareness programs,"
said Lambright, a junior.
Rabois said he wants the week,
which is scheduled for March 7-
10, to be "more social and fun."
Specific events for the week have
not been announced.
Also at the meeting, a repre
sentative of the Housing Energy
Conservation Center asked each
housed fraternity to appoint an
environmental representative
who would inform residents
about recycling and other envi
ronmental issues. Dormitories
already have such representa
tives.
