# Grad theme house called apathetic
## 
### Art Marcum Staff writer 
Halfway through the first year
of a graduate multicultural theme
house, residence staff say student
apathy is keeping the dormitory
from meeting its goals.
Responding to a three-year
struggle by the United Graduate
Student Alliance, the University
last spring approved the establish
ment of the multicultural theme
dormitory in the Rains Houses to
address the needs of the various
ethnic cultures in Stanford's
graduate population.
But resident assistant Felix
Cuevas said he is disappointed by
the lack of energy of the students
involved, adding that the atten
dance at some of the house's activ
ities has been low.
John Kenney, one of the
house's theme coordinators, esti
mated that roughly 15 of the
house's 115 members are active in
house activities. He said the resi
dents don't have enough energy to
accomplish the goals he had envi
sioned.
Cuevas said that although the
interest of the students in multi
culturalism is strong, the general
attitude and lifestyle of graduate
students keeps them from actively
pursuing these interests.
"The apathy of graduate stu
dents fin dorm life] is not unique
to Rains," Cuevas said. "It's the
reality of grad student life."
He attributed this phe
nomenon to graduate students'
devotion to their particular
departments, which keeps them
very busy and "tends to drain
their energy."
About 115 residents live in the
theme house, which occupies
three apartment complexes in
Rains. The one RA and 10 theme
coordinators organize events such
as multicultural film series,
minority guest speakers and par
ties celebrating different cultures.
As part of the same program,
the University also has estab
lished "clusters" of students of
color and of people interested in
multiculturalism in all of the
graduate student dormitories on
campus. These clusters are sec
tions of halls where students live
in close proximity.
Though originally conceived to
address the needs of American
minority students here, the house
has also become a haven for inter
national students who relate to
the needs of ethnic minorities,
staff said,
Though he said he welcomes
the added dimension the interna
tional students bring to the house,
Cuevas also expressed concern
that some of these students and
others in the house were placed
there by accident in the graduate
housing lottery.
Echoing this concern, Kenney
said many students who would
like to live in the theme house
were unable to draw into Rains.
At the same time, others less
interested in the theme wind up in

the house.
"The University's fair lottery is
implicitly unfair," Kenney said.
Kenney said he would like to
see the theme house become a
focal point for international and
minority activities and issues and
thinks the house should be active
in organizing campus-wide
events.
Despite the disappointments,
Cuevas said the house has suc
ceeded in many areas. "People like
being here â€” they feel secure.
People want to live multicultural
ism, not just talk about it."
Cuevas added that there have
been no conflicts between stu
dents and that roommates have
gotten along very well.
For the future, Cuevas said he
will attempt to combat student
apathy by organizing smaller and
more intimate events. He said he
plans to better acquaint students
with each other in the hope they
will participate in activities more
readily if they know those
involved.
A meeting will take place in a
few weeks between theme house
organizers and graduate-student
housing directors evaluating the
current state of the house
