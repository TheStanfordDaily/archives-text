# Grad theme house called apathetic

### Art Marcum Staff writer 
Halfway through the first year
of a graduate multicultural theme
house, residence staff say student
apathy is keeping the dormitory
from meeting its goals.
Responding to a three-year
struggle by the United Graduate
Student Alliance, the University
last spring approved the establish

dormitory in the Rains Houses to
address the needs of the various
ethnic cultures in Stanford's
graduate population.
But resident assistant Felix
Cuevas said he is disappointed by
the lack of energy of the students
involved, adding that the atten

John Kenney, one of the
house's theme coordinators, esti

house's 115 members are active in
house activities. He said the resi

accomplish the goals he had envi
sioned.
Cuevas said that although the
interest of the students in multi
culturalism is strong, the general
attitude and lifestyle of graduate
students keeps them from actively
pursuing these interests.
"The apathy of graduate stu
dents fin dorm life] is not unique
to Rains," Cuevas said. "It's the
reality of grad student life."
He attributed this phe
nomenon to graduate students'
devotion to their particular
departments, which keeps them
very busy and "tends to drain
their energy."
About 115 residents live in the
theme house, which occupies
three apartment complexes in
Rains. The one RA and 10 theme
coordinators organize events such
as multicultural film series,
minority guest speakers and par
ties celebrating different cultures.
