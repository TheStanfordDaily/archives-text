# Skateboarders explain why Stanford campus is 'happening'

For the serious skateboarder, Stan
ford's greatest qualities are not its Nobel
Prize-winning faculty, overwhelming aca
demic resources or sky-scraping stan
dards of excellence, but its smooth pave
ment, sturdy benches and plethora of
cement stairs.
"There's lots of stuff we like about the
campus," says Gabe MacKillop, who
attends Palo Alto High School. " The
stairs and everything. . . . We like the
variety, and it's all close together. It sucks
when you have to skate really far between
curbs and stuff," he says.

The general consensus of several
"skate gangs" is that the post office area
and various parts of the Quad offer the
best opportunities for skateboarding.
"But we like pretty much any place
that has stairs or slick cement, MacKillop
adds. "Handrails are also good."
"The post office area can be a real has
sle when it's too crowded," says Stanford
sophomore Matt Tripp. "Your skateboard
shoots out from under you into some
one's bike, people get pissed and so on."
However, Tripp said he tolerates the
difficulties because of the area's ideal mix
of steps, blocks, planters and both high
and low walls.

favorite spots. Nick Wright, a student at
Gunn High School, says,"The Oval is
happening." Wright says he drives 45
minutes to skate on campus.
On the whole, skateboarders say they
get along fairly well with the rest of the
campus community.
"People at Stanford don't mess with
us. There are no cars," says MacKillop.

Wright agrees. "Students here seem
pretty mellow. Some of them have prob
lems getting out of the way, but they're
pretty cool. It is their school and stuff,"
he said.
MacKillop also acknowledges Stanford
students "do have the right of way."
Tripp says, "Bikers are only a hassle at
congestion hours such as lunch

time. I have almost been killed by bikers
but I, in turn, have almost killed bikers.

a skateboard. You have to, or you'll get
hurt."
Most skateboarders said they do not
feel hostility directed toward them
despite their rambunctious and often
noisy activity. "No one seems to get mad
except. . . when we skate near the sculp
tures, then people come out and yell at us
to stay off the artwork," Wright says.
"Even the Stanford cops are pretty cool.
They don't give us too many hassles."
