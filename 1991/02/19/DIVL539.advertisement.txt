Famous U.S. Women's Ski Team Diet
This diet has been featured in SPORTS ILLUSTRATED magazine.
During the non-snow off season the U.S. Women's Alpine Ski Team members
used the "Ski Team" diet to lose 20 pounds in two weeks. That's right 20
pounds in 14 days!. The basis of the diet is chemical food action and was
devised by a famous Colorado physician especially for the U.S. Ski Team.
Normal energy is maintained (very important!) while reducing. You keep "full"
— no starvation — because the diet is designed that way. It's a diet that is
easy to follow whether you work, travel or stay at home.
This is, honestly, a fantastically successful diet. If it weren't, the U.S. Women's
Ski Team wouldn't be permitted to use it! Right? So, give yourself the same
break the U.S. Ski Team gets. Lose weight the scientific, proven way. Even if
you've tried all the other diets, you owe it to yourself to try the U.S. Women's
Ski Team Diet. That is, if you really do want to lose 20 pounds in two weeks.
Order today. Tear this out as a reminder.
Send only $10.00 ($10.50 for Rush Service) - to: SlimQuik, P.O. Box
103, Dept. 2R, Hayden, ID 83835. Don't order unless you want to lose 20
pounds in two weeks! Because that's what the Ski Team will do. © 1990.
