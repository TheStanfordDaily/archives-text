It began as a class project
1984, Stanford
University.
Four graduate
students and
their professor
develop a new experimen
tal microprocessor incorpo
rating the ideas behind
RISC. This prototype com
puter is four times faster
than anything commercially
available, with advantages
that motivate them to com
mercialize their ideas.
The result is Mil's
Computer Systems, Inc.,
which today boasts 800 em
ployees and an annual rev
enue rate greater than $150
million, according to Wall
analysts projections.
Through design wins, soft
ware licensing and reseller
system sales, MIPS is gath
ering a significant share of
RISC-based computing. In
other words, we're becom
ing a leader in the technol
ogy that will be the heart of
computer platforms in the
19905.
