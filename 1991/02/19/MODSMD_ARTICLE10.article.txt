# Japanese language education explored

### Ajai Chari 
Because Japanese is a rela
tively new subject for U.S. high
schools, participants in a confer
ence here this weekend tried to
find ways to better incorporate
the language into the mainstream
of education.
The goal of the conference was
to develop curriculum guidelines
for teaching Japanese at the sec
ondary school level and to initiate
a College Board achievement test
in Japanese, according to Ronald
Walton, a representative of the
National Foreign Language Cen
ter.
The consensus at the gathering
was that high school teaching
should definitely focus on spoken
Japanese, said Ronald Herring,
director of public programs at the
Stanford Institute for Interna
tional Studies and host of the con
ference.
The conference, entitled "Lan

guage in Culture: Issues in the
Teaching of Japanese in American
High Schools," was part of a pro
ject funded by a grant from the
National Endowment for the
Humanities, Walton said.
Currently; more and more high
school students are enrolling in
Japanese. Mari Noda, a member
of the curriculum task force,
attributes the enrollment boom to
the media's increased exposure of
Japanese culture and Japan's
increasing economic power.
Students and parents believe
learning Japanese will be a valu
able asset for careers in business,
law, international relations and
science, Walton said.
Noda added that, unfortu
nately, this boom in students has
not been matched by an increase
in the number of trained teachers.
The teacher shortage was one of
the issues discussed at the confer
ence.
