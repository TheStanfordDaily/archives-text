Maryland pro-choice bill passes
ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) - Gov. William
Schaefer signed into law yesterday a bill that
would protect a woman's option to get an abor
tion in the event the U.S. Supreme Court's Roe
vs. Wade decision is overturned.
The Maryland House sent the measure to
the governor on a vote of 84-52, ending a round
of intense lobbying and a yearlong battle.
"I think the House and Senate acted
wisely," Schaefer said. "They voted their con
science."
Abortion advocates hailed the law as a
mÂ£yor victory. Abortion foes vowed to launch a
petition drive to allow voters to reject the law.
A proposed, anti-abortion "conscience
amendment" to bar lawsuits against people
who refuse to refer patients for an abortion
was rejected by the House on a vote of 61-73.
Dannemeyer announces
candidacy for U.S. Senate
SACRAMENTO (AP) - Orange County
Republican William Dannemeyer, an outspo
ken conservative who has built a political
career opposing gays and environmentalists,
declared his candidacy yesterday for the U.S.
Senate seat held by gubernatorial appointee
John Seymour.
The 61-year-old Dannemeyer, a 12-year vet
eran of Congress, said during a statewide
swing of four cities that his campaign would
"reinvigorate" California politics, adding that
he would need to raise $15 million to $20 mil
lion to win the June 1992 GOP primary and
capture the seat in the November 1992 general
election.
"I believe I am the only viable conservative
in the race to confront Seymour," Dannemeyer
said.
Cranston decries leaks about
Keating Five case to reporters
WASHINGTON (AP) - Sen. Alan Cranston
on Monday described as "malicious" leaks to
reporters about Senate Ethics Committee
plans to discipline him for his role in the scan
dal surrounding financier Charles Keating.
"These malicious leaks constitute a violation
of ethical behavior at least as serious as any
thing of which we senators have been accused,"
the California Democrat said in a letter to the
committee.
