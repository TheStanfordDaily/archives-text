LONDON (AP) - A bomb
exploded at Victoria station dur
ing morning rush hour yesterday,
45 minutes after a caller claiming
to represent the Irish Republican
Army. The caller warned of bombs
at all of London's train stations,
police said. One man was killed
and 40 people were injured.
It came less than three hours
after a bomb exploded at Padding
ton station, another main station.
Only a dozen employees were on
duty, and no one was injured.
The Victoria explosion at 7:46
a.m. sent screaming commuters
running from the terminal, some
trailing blood across the con
course. Morning rail traffic was

halted for hours.
The IRA claimed responsibility
for both attacks, but blamed the
casualties on authorities
"All future warnings should be
acted upon," said a statement
from the IRA.
"The cynical decision of senior
security personnel not to evacuate
railway stations named in sec
ondary warnings, even three
hours after the warning device
had exploded at Paddington in the
early hours of this morning was
directly responsible for the casual
ties at Victoria," the statement
said.
The incidents were the first
attacks on a British rail station

credited by the IRA in 16 years.
The warning was delivered by a
man with an Irish accent who;
said: "We are the Irish Republican
Army. Bombs to go of! at all main
line stations in 45 minutes," said
Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist!
chief, Cmdr. George Churchill-
Coleman.
Churchill-Coleman said the call
was only one of a number of
threats following the Paddington
explosion, and that the others
"transpired either to be false or
malicious."
lain McGregor, deputy chief
constable of the British Transport
Police, said his department gets
about six bomb threats a day.
