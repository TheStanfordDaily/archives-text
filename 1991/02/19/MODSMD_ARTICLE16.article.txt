## Reject Saddam's offer 
### 
Proposal is unrealistic;
U.S. should deter, not
reward aggression

THE IRAQI DICTATOR'S
new diplomatic initiative
dominated media coverage of
the Gulf war last Friday. This new
"peace" proposal from Saddam
Hussein is little more than a public
relations hoax. The United States
should not agree to negotiate with
Saddam in this present diplomatic
climate.
While a peaceful resolution to
armed conflict is in everyone's
interest, peace cannot be negoti
ated under present circumstances.
Saddam's new proposal does not
represent a substantive departure
from his communiques last Aug.
12. The language of the initiative is
more moderate than others of the
past, and it does for the first time
make a direct reference to an Iraqi
pullout from Kuwait.
However, the proposal's primary
stipulations are not new. There is
still an emphasis upon linking this
issue to the Syrian/Lebanese and
the Israeli/Palestinian conflicts.
Saddam additionally continues to
reject the legitimacy of the Emir's
government and the necessity for
Iraq to pay reparations to Kuwait.
The entire ideological founda
tion for U.S. action in the Gulf
rests on the recognition of a "new
world order."
Aggression must be deterred
and aggressors must be punished.
If the United States gives in to any
of Saddam's stipulations it will be
sending the message that aggres
sion will be rewarded rather than
punished.
Which is not to say that last
week's American bombing of an
Iraqi building, which resulted in
500 civilian deaths, is justified.

Conflicting evidence makes it
unclear whether or not the struc
ture was a military command post
or a civilian shelter. Still, the
killing of 500 civilians is a tragedy.
Civilian casulties always raise seri
ous questions about moral stan
dards in the war.
But targeting civilians has pre
cisely been part of Saddam's own
warplans. Iraq's initial attack upon
Kuwait, and its subsequent Scud
launches against Israel were all
aimed at civilians.
Nevertheless, this fact should
not tempt the United States to
embrace an "eye-for-an-eye" men
tality. While the killing of civilians
in war is inevitable, it should be
avoided wherever possible.
This is not only an assertion of
moral decency, but one of Ameri
can political interest as well. The
fewer Arab civilians killed, the less
anti-U.S. sentiment will be bol
stered in the region.
Negotiation implies a certain
compromise. However, until Iraq
withdraws from Kuwait there is
nothing that the allies can give
Saddam which will not reward him
for his actions. A cease-fire prior to
his withdrawal would jeopardize
the military gains that the allies
have made in the past four weeks.
During the five months prior to
the outbreak of war, the allies and
the United Nations sought, with
out success, a diplomatic solution
to the crisis through many differ
ent avenues. This new proposal is
not indicative of any new-found
willingness on Saddam's part to
comply with the U.N. Security
Council Resolutions to withdraw
from Kuwait.
There will come a time, once
there is evidence of an Iraqi inten
tion to comply with U.N. condi
tions, for negotiation between
Bush and Saddam.
This is not that time.
