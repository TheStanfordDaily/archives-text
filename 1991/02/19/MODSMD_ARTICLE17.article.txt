Racist persecutions during WWII may repeat themselves

THE INCARCERATION OF Japan
ese-Americans during World War II
is one of the darkest events in his
tory — not just Japanese-American or
Asian-American history, but United
States history. That was in 1942.
This is 1991 and history may be
repeating itself. This time, the victims
are Arab-Americans.
Those who support the war in the
Middle East tell us to remember Adolf
Hitler; they say we can't sit back and let
Saddam Hussein take what he wants.
Those against the war remind us of the
Vietnam War; they say the United States
is being dragged into another country's
battle and we don't know why or don't
understand the justification.
The lesson I want to add is to remem
ber, "On February 19, 1942, President
Franklin Roosevelt signed Executive
Order 9066, which placed 120,000 per
sons of Japanese ancestry into intern
ment camps."
These words are in quotes because I
say them euphemistically. The quote
could possibly be found in a history text,
placed there only after years of demands
that this ugly part of American history
be told. I want to let you know what
textbooks leave out.
The books tone down the fact that the
internment was a racist move, pure and
simple, on the part of the government
with the blessing of the public. The
quote doesn't do justice to the fact that
120,000 people were herded out of their
homes — talcing only what they could
carry — into concentration camps.
There were no charges; their only
"crime'' was their ethnicity.
The quote doesn't say that most of
these people were U.S. citizens. It
doesn't tell about the humiliation and
indignation of being treated like second
class citizens and the anger that was felt,
the monetary loss, the damage done to
the family structure. It doesn't explain
the effects which didn't only affect those

in the camps but their children and their
children's children.
The above quote doesn't express the
extent of the great injustice that was
done.
Day of Remembrance, Feb. 19, is a
day to commemorate the struggle, the
hardship and the survival of those who
were in the camps.
It is to remember those who have
died, those who didn't live to see that
indignity removed. It is a day to cry and
to rejoice. The image of 120,000 people
surrounded by barbed wire and machine
guns, trying to live a life, trying to raise
families and trying to understand how
and why their government could do such
a thing can never be lost.
This year's Day of Remembrance has
a frightening added dimension because
of the Persian Gulf war. We, as a demo
cratic nation, supposedly fighting for this
idea of democracy, have not come far
enough to insure that a population of
human beings won't be imprisoned
because of their ancestry.
We haven't conquered racism.
When I hear of Arab-American dis
crimination or of any hint of "rounding
up" Arab-Americans, I am frightened,
not only for these people whose civil
rights are being violated, but also
because the lesson from World War II
obviously has not been learned.
This shameful event must always
touch all of us. In the freest country in
the world, the unjust herding of people
into concentration camps without
charges and without reason shows that
each individual's unalienable rights can
not be taken for granted. It is up to each
of us to remember, to learn and to make
sure nothing like this happens again.
For this very reason, in the early
1980s, the movement for redress and
reparations gained strength. Commu
nity, religious and student groups
banded together to lobby for an apology
from the U.S. government for the viola

tion of the internees' constitutional
rights and reparations for the wrongdo
ings.
The movement resulted in the signing
of the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 by
President Reagan. It won the entitle
ment which started payments in 1990.
All this was supposed to insure that the
rights of others are never again taken
away as was done in 1942.
Yet after a decade of struggle, and
even after the Civil Liberties Act was
passed, there were actual plans drafted
to intern Iranians in the United States
during the takeover of the American
Embassy in Iran. There are increasing
incidents of anti-Arab discrimination; an
internment of Arab-Americans is not
beyond the imagination of many in this
country.
Just because it's been over 40 years
since the Japanese-American intern
ment, I would not say this flagrant viola
tion of rights is inconceivable today. The
evidence is right here at Stanford. It
took form in my Western Culture section
three years ago, long before Saddam
Hussein marched into Kuwait.
My class read a passage by Rousseau
which influenced that great document,
the Bill of Rights. The question was
posed as we talked about human rights,
"If we were at war with Canada, would
you support rounding up all the Canadi
ans in the United States and placing
them in internment camps?"
Those who were on the "pro" side
came up with reasons of national safety.
Those on the "con" side said nothing.
After a short time, all I heard was my
heart. I was truly speechless. I couldn't
believe that I was hearing Stanford stu
dents — the best in the nation.
If any student in this great land of
ours had learned about the Japanese-
American internment, it would have
been these students sitting around me.
If they had learned about it, they had
not learned from it. They were ready to

take away the human rights of people
whose only crime was their ancestry.
They could have been any group of stu
dents in any classroom in any school.
These are tomorrow's leaders. It could
happen again.
I am sad that 120,000 people suffered,
endured and survived so that hopefully
no one else would be prosecuted for their
ethnicity, yet we are starting down the
road to repeating history. I begin to won
der whether or not 60,000 people have
not died in vain. We have to open our
eyes and recognize, before it is too late,
what history will tell those who follow. It
may be happening again.
