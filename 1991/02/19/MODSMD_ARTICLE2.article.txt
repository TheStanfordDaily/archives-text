More than 200 peace act
ivists from Stanford and other
local communities held an
"Anti-War Fair" at Mitchell
Park in Palo Alto Saturday,
coinciding with demonstra
tions around the Bay Area and
around the country.
The focus of the fair was to
educate the public about the
peace movement and mobilize
public opinion against the Per
sian Gulf war, organizers said.
Fair coordinator Paul
George said that while the Palo
Alto fair was taking place,
about 10,000 people rallied in
San Francisco's Golden Gate

Park and about 5,000 demon
strated in Oakland. George, the
coordinator of the Palo Alto
Peninsula Peace Center, which
has organized numerous other
rallies in the area, said activists
from 80 cities took part in anti
war demonstrations nation
wide.
George called for the start of
a general boycott to slow down
the economy until the war is
stopped. "Until this war
stops," he told the crowd, "put
off purchasing that new appli
ance, don't go out to restau
rants or to the movies." He
urged the crowd to, "write the
president and tell him to stop
this war or we're going to stop the
economy."
Jeff Paterson, a former Marine
who refused to deploy with his
unit, said he worries about the
results of public opinion polls
showing the majority of American
people support the war.
"I'm worried that no one is
against" the war, he said, "Some
times you got to follow your con
science. Just because a million
people say a stupid thing doesn't

mean it's not a stupid thing."
Paterson said he couldn't
deploy with his unit because he
believed the United States was
exploiting the Third World for its
own interests. "What the Marine
Corps was going to do to me was
insignificant compared to what
we were going to do to the people
in the Middle East," he said.
Speakers from Stanford joined
the Bay Area activists at the fair.
History Prof. Joel Beinin said the
Gulf war comes from a long
standing U.S. policy to protect oil
interests in Saudi Arabia.
He said the Persian Gulf con
tains 60 to 65 percent of the
world's oil resources and Saudi

Arabia holds about 21 percent.
Beinin said these resources were
developed by a joint Arab-Ameri
can venture that included the
U.S. corporations Texaco, Mobil,
Exxon and Chevron.
Beinin said the U.S. has
emphasized a military solution to
the crisis because "the military is
the only sense in which the U.S. is
unequivocally a superpower."
The Bush administration is
seeking to send a message to the
Third World that, "anyone that
seeks to change the existing dis
tribution of resources will be
smashed" and to the Allies that
they must be prepared to back up
the [United States] in order to

preserve the existing order, he
said.
Beinin said Bush is saying,
"You pay, we fight, and in this way
the [United States] keeps its
prominence in the world."
In addition to questioning the
reasons for the war, activists com
plained about the way the war
was being fought. Clifford John
son, manager of capacity planning
at the Stanford Data Center, led a
workshop in which he said U.S.
bombing strategy against Iraq
violated the Geneva Convention.
He called the incident Feb. 12 in
which 500 civilians were killed by
bombs from U.S. stealth fighters
a "war crime."
