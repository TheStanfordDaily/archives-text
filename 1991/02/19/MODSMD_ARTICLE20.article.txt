## Children have rights, too 
### 
A RECENT OUTBREAK OF measles
in Philadelphia has caused the
deaths of at least four children. The
families of all of the deceased belong to
churches that oppose medical care, that
rely instead on prayer and faith to cure
illness.
Measles is preventable and curable, so
these children arguably would not have
died had their parents allowed them to be
inoculated, or even treated once their
symptoms worsened. However, these par
ents refused to let their children receive
medical treatment.
As this is considered a First Amend
ment issue, officials cannot legally
require vaccinations. It seems to me,
however, that it is the children's religious
liberty which is at stake here — not that
of their parents.
Religious beliefs are intensely per
sonal, and should be consciously chosen
by each individual. This choice was never
offered to the children who died of
measles, nor to most of the other 140 chil
dren in the United States who have died
in the past 15 years as a result of withheld
medical care.
These children might have chosen a
religion which accepts medical care, and
thus might be alive today.
There is nothing wrong with parents
teaching their children their own beliefs.
One can hardly expect them to raise chil
dren in a moral and religious vacuum.
Nor would it be wise to assign the
entire burden of teaching values and
beliefs to the state or the school — that
would give children even less of a chance
to evaluate for themselves what they wish
to believe in.

Your beliefs are inevitably influenced
by your parents' teachings and by your
(cultural) background. Most people, in
fact, stay close to the religion of their par
ents, and their values resemble those of
the people with whom they grew up.
But the importance of parental influ
ence does not give parents the right to
make decisions for their children that
may irrevocably affect their lives. Chil
dren are not pieces of property to be gov
erned at will.
The religious liberty of children enti
tles them not to be considered an auto
matic part of their their parents' religion.
Until they reach an age at which they can
make informed decisions on the issue, the
state must protect this right against the
decisions of the parents.
Thus, I favor mandatory vaccination of
children against preventable diseases
such as measles, as well as medical care in
life-threatening cases. If the parents want
to heal their children by prayer, they can
do so in a hospital.
The same principle applies in situa
tions that are not life-threatening, but
may drastically curtail children's oppor
tunities in life.
For instance, there have been cases
involving Moslems who have refused to
let their daughters attend high school.
They apparently believe that their daugh
ters should help their mothers at home.
They demand to be exempt from legal
educational requirements because of
their religious beliefs.
But these fathers are denying their
daughters the opportunity to participate
in society as anything other than house
wives who rarely venture outside. I

believe that the state should protect the
right of these women to get as much of an
education as they desire.
Very few religions prohibit converts at
at an adult age. Women with a college
degree can still be good Moslems, but they
can be little else if denied a basic educa
tion. Similarly, children can decide once
they grow up if they should rely on faith
healing instead of medical care, but they
cannot decide to do anything at all if they
die of measles as a result of their parents'
refusal to have them vaccinated and
treated.
If parents fear that the children's
minds will be "poisoned" by exposure to
education or health care, they must not
have a very strong faith in the continuing
appeal of their own beliefs.
There is an old adage, the source of
which I forget, that says,"The world is
not ours remake or destroy — we have
only borrowed it from our children."
Today's children are not only tomor
row's rulers, they also constitute one of
the most important elements of this
world which has been entrusted tem
porarily to adults. As I see more and more
of my friends starting families, I hope
none of them will treat their children as
pieces of furniture they may alter, redeco
rate and even dispose of as they please.
