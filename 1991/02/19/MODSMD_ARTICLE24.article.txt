# Wartime at Stanford
## From activism to apathy Psychologists gauge Stanford's reaction to war 
### Eleni Kirkas Staff writer 
During the past four weeks,
student reactions to the war in
the Persian Gulf have run the
gamut from demonstrations in
Palo Alto and San Francisco to
letter-writing campaigns to
seeming inaction.
The war has profoundly
affected some people, while oth
ers appear to carry on their nor
mal lives with as little change as
possible.
While there are no definite
explanations for the variety of
feelings and behavior, many psy
chologists and psychiatrists
believe people's uncertainty
about the war and about their
ability to influence world events

are some of the factors that have
shaped responses to the war.
Psychology Prof. Lee Ross
said scientists have long ques
tioned why people disagree on
the relative importance of issues
like war and what motivates
them to act on their convictions.
People who hold extreme
stances on an issue express those
attitudes clearly because they are
certain of their positions, Ross
said. But when people feel
ambivalent about an event, they
may often be reluctant to discuss
it with others for fear their occa
sionally contradictory views may
be misunderstood, he added.
"As a political community (at
Stanford), we are not comfort
able with complexity," Ross said.
In addition, students' reac

tions to war are in part influ
enced by the actions of their
peers, he added.
Gary Lapid, clinical associate
professor in psychiatry, said peo
ple respond to particular crises
based on how they are "pro
grammed," or influenced by the
values adopted from their par
ents or derived from education or
environment.
Ideals and hopes for a better
world may spur some people into
action, he said. "There's also
such a thing as vision."
People also choose their
responses to a situation such as
the Persian Gulf war based on
their perceptions of their effec
tiveness, Lapid said. People who

feel their actions will not make a
difference are unlikely to take to
the streets or pursue some other
form of activism, he explained.
The choice of responses, which
may mean letter-writing for some
and marching in protest for oth
ers, depends partially on the

image people have of themselves
and of their place in society, Lapin
said.
Lapid added that another fac
tor in a person's decision whether
to act on his or her convictions is
the level of involvement with the
issue. "People are active if they've
been personally touched by some
thing."
Currently many Stanford stu
dents are "confused and pulled in
contradictory directions" about

with a tremendous
amount of inertia in
our life. Most of us
don't change unless
we really have to.'

the war, he said. Hence campus
demonstrations supporting or
opposing U.S. policy in the Gulf
have not risen to the level of some
past events, including rallies

about apartheid and abortion, the
debate over Western Culture and
the takeover of University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's office.
Lapid said people may not
demonstrate or take other actions
that they perceive as troublesome
or as intrusions into everyday
activities. "Most of us operate
with a tremendous amount of
inertia in our life. Most of us
don't change unless we really
have to."
Psychology Prof. Philip Zim
bardo said that although inaction
is often perceived as approval for

policies already in place, it may
also signal ambivalence or a sense
of helplessness.
It is difficult to discern which
of these factors is dominant in
any particular situation, he said.
Lapid said he thinks the cur
rent low level of activism on cam
pus is more likely a symptom of
ambivalence over the issues
rather than indifference to the
war.
"My intuition is that most peo
ple are tremendously, tremen
dously affected by this Gulf cri
sis," he said.
