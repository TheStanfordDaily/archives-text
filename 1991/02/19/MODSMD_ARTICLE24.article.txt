# Wartime at Stanford
## From activism to apathy Psychologists gauge Stanford's reaction to war

During the past four weeks,
student reactions to the war in
the Persian Gulf have run the
gamut from demonstrations in
Palo Alto and San Francisco to
letter-writing campaigns to

The war has profoundly

said. But when people feel

may often be reluctant to discuss

Stanford), we are not comfort
able with complexity," Ross said.
In addition, students' reac

professor in psychiatry, said peo

Ideals and hopes for a better
world may spur some people into
