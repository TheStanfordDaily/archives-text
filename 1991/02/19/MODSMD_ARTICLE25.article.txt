# Athletes touched by conflict

Anyone who has attended an athletic event in
the past month — professional or collegiate —
knows the sports world has not been unaffected by
the Persian Gulf War.
At the beginning of almost every contest, a few
seconds of silence are observed to honor the troops
in the desert. Many teams, who once may have
donned only cardinal and white or blue and gold,
now also bear the red, white and .blue.
The Stanford men's basketball team, in a 92-76
victory over USC last Thursday, for the first time
wore uniforms on which the American flag was
sewn.
"Everybody agreed on it," said Brent Williams, a
forward on the team. "But, you know, that flag can

stand for different things. Some of the guys on the
team feel that they're against the war, but they
support the troops. Then there are some people
that might support the war, so the flag can mean
two things."
The Cardinal baseball team has also chosen to
don the stars and stripes.
Relief pitcher Scott Weiss, a senior, said the war
has put his life as an athlete in perspective. "It
gives you a sense of reality. Now, before every game
we have a moment of silence, and every time you do
it you think to yourself about the sacrifice the
troops are making over there," he said.
"It makes you think about how lucky you are to
be playing baseball here when there are kids your
age over there fighting. A lot of soldiers are there
