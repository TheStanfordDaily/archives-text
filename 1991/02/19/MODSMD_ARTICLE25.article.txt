# Athletes touched by conflict
## 
### Tyson Vaughan Senior staff writer 
Anyone who has attended an athletic event in
the past month — professional or collegiate —
knows the sports world has not been unaffected by
the Persian Gulf War.
At the beginning of almost every contest, a few
seconds of silence are observed to honor the troops
in the desert. Many teams, who once may have
donned only cardinal and white or blue and gold,
now also bear the red, white and .blue.
The Stanford men's basketball team, in a 92-76
victory over USC last Thursday, for the first time
wore uniforms on which the American flag was
sewn.
"Everybody agreed on it," said Brent Williams, a
forward on the team. "But, you know, that flag can

stand for different things. Some of the guys on the
team feel that they're against the war, but they
support the troops. Then there are some people
that might support the war, so the flag can mean
two things."
The Cardinal baseball team has also chosen to
don the stars and stripes.
Relief pitcher Scott Weiss, a senior, said the war
has put his life as an athlete in perspective. "It
gives you a sense of reality. Now, before every game
we have a moment of silence, and every time you do
it you think to yourself about the sacrifice the
troops are making over there," he said.
"It makes you think about how lucky you are to
be playing baseball here when there are kids your
age over there fighting. A lot of soldiers are there
because they didn't have a career,
didn't have a lot of options in life,"
Weiss added.
Debbie Graham, a junior on
the women's tennis team, agreed.
"It seems so trivial when I get
upset about a match or some
thing. ... Especially in the first
week (of the war), everything
seemed so meaningless compared
to [it]."
Graham has her own story
about the war. "I did know some
one over there," she said. "Cindy
Buchsbaum (who played for the
Cardinal from 1986-89) was in
Jerusalem when it started. The
team was really worried. She was
there for a while. Her parents sent
her a ticket and she finally came
home."

But Graham has other con
cerns that hit closer to home. "I'm
worried because I might go to
Europe for the French Open and
Wimbledon. My faipily is con
cerned about terrorism. I have a
feeling something will happen
soon — some bomb in some
plane," she said.
Some athletes related the diffi
culty of keeping up with the news
of the war.
Being an athlete, "you don't
have as much time to read papers
and watch the news — especially
when you're on a road trip and
you've got midterms," Williams
said.
"We were practicing when it
broke out," Weiss said. "The first
week it affected our concentration
in practice. In games you don't
give it as much thought, because
as an athlete you're trained to
concentrate, block out your stud
ies, your girlfriend, whatever."

One factor that adds to the fear
and uncertainty is the novelty of
the war. The possibility of a draft,
which is surfacing for the first
time in nearly two decades, affects
many who thought they would
never have to worry about fight
ing a war themselves.
But for men's swimming coach
Skip Kenney, the present con
cerns are all too familiar. Kenney
was a Marine in Vietnam and
fought as a foot soldier and a
sniper.
"Because of my Vietnam expe
rience, I'm more sensitive [to the
war and its effects]," he said.
"When one person is killed you
think of one person, but then you
add in friends and relatives and
end up with hundreds of people
[affected]. If they in Washington
believe this is important enough
to sacrifice even one American life
for, I hope they're right.
"I've gone to see the Vietnam

Memorial Wall. I look up at that
wall with 55 thousand names on it
— for what? What did it get us?
What do we have now that we
didn't then? The last thing I want
to see is another wall," he said.
The war in the Gulf has had a
mqjor impact on Kenney's rela
tionship with .his family and his
team. The emotions of the first
day of fighting were particularly
poignant for him, he said.
"What was amazing was that
we had held a team meeting that
day,"he said. "I wanted some
feedback from the the guys about
the soldiers. They asked me some
questions. I said I didn't think
there would be a war."
About 10 minutes later he
went into his office and heard the
news on the radio, he said. "I told
the guys it had started. I told
them to get out of the pool and go
home so they could see the presi
dent's speech."

Kenney said that when he went
home that night his 12-year old
son gave him a big hug. "He said,
'Dad, I'm glad you're here,' and I
started to cry. I went into another
room, and my wife said to me,
'Your son needs to see your feel
ings,"' he said.
He has held several more team
meetings to talk about the war
and has kept in contact with play
ers on an individual basis.
He also noted his attitude
toward peace ralliers has changed
since the Vietnam era. "After I
came back from Vietnam, every
time I'd hear someone for peace,
I'd yell at them.
"I'd drive by those folks on the
corner of Embarcadero and El
Camino (Real) with their signs,
and I'd get angry. But you know, a
few weeks ago I drove by and
smiled. I smiled because this time
I agreed with them. The sign they
held said, 'Bring the boys home.'"
