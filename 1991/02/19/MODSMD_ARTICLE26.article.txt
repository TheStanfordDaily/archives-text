# Other schools lose students to Gulf
## 
### Miranda Doyle Staff writer 
At many universities across the coun
try, empty seats in classrooms have
become constant reminders that hun
dreds of students have been called up to
fight in the Persian Gulf war.
"One day someone is sitting next to
you in class and the next he has been
activated to Saudi Arabia," said Sherri
Mariwhether, director of university
relations at Auburn University in Mont
gomery, Ala. "That has got to have an
impact."
Mariwhether said she does not know
how many students have been called up
for military service, but "class size is
definitely reduced."
Auburn students are not just missing
classmates. The university's chancellor,
James Williams, was activated Jan. 28.
Mariwhether said he is serving at a mil
itary base in Denver, Colo, and will prob
ably not be sent to the Gulf.
At the Baton Rouge campus of
Southern University in Louisiana, col
lege life has also been disrupted. "We
have at least 600 students gone," said
senior Leslie Watson, a leader of the
peace movement there.
Nationwide, 375 schools are report
ing that considerable numbers of stu
dents in ROTC or the reserves are being
activated into the military, said Sam
Snead, a spokesperson of the American

Snead said he did not have informa
tion on the total number of college stu
dents who have been called up.
Southern University and Louisiana
State University students make up 80
percent of the 256 th Army Infantry Bat
talion, which was was activated Dec. 1,
Watson said.
"When people started seeing their
classmates and roommates leaving for
Saudi [Arabial, they started getting
scared. So they have kind of pulled into
themselves," Watson said.
More students are expected to be
called up from among the 13,000 on
campus, she added.
Watson said she thinks state schools
have been disproportionately affected
by the war.
At the Citadel Military College in
Charleston, S.C., "Students are very
sympathetic with the cause," said Lt.
Col. Ben Legare.
Legare, director of public affairs for
the college, said 21 cadets have been
activated from the 2,000-member stu

dent body and over 100 graduates are
currently serving in Operation Desert
Storm. Five faculty members have also
been called up.
Citadel students "are very concerned
for the welfare" of their friends and
classmates, Legare said. "They are also
proud that they are doing what they
wanted to do."
"A great many have friends [in Saudi
Arabia]. They are hoping there will not
be a ground war and their friends will
come home safely," he said.
Of the students at the military
academy, "no one is eager to go, but if
called they will serve," Legare added.
Watson said she thinks the possibility
of a ground war beginning in the next
couple of weeks may have a large impact
on Southern University students. "We
have to try to prepare the students for
ground war casualties. They were
shocked to see the Iraqi casualties and it
will be even worse when it is our stu
dents," she said.
Although the protest movement at
Southern University was strengthened
when the students were activated,
Louisiana remains a very pro-war state,
Watson said. "It is understandable
because 10,000 men and women from
this state are serving," she added.
"But it is important that people
understand they can support the troops
and still want them to come home," she
said.
