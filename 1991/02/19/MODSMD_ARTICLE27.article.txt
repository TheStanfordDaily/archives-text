# Few use counseling services
## 
### Anna Rabinowicz Staff writer 
Few students have taken
advantage of counseling sessions
established to help relieve war
related anxiety, leading some cam
pus health workers to believe peo
ple are finding other ways to cope.
Only one student has gone to
Counseling and Psychological Ser
vices' daily drop-in support group
for students suffering from war
related anxiety and depression,
said Sam Edwards, a CAPS social
worker.
Edwards said students are not
as depressed as they were immedi
ately after the war broke out. "It's
fading into the background."
Senior Matt Paradise, a live-in
counselor at the Bridge, said,
"There's not a huge influx of peo
ple coming in for [counseling]."
He compared the current situa
tion to the aftermath of the
Earthquake of 1989, when rela
tively few people sought advice
there.
Douglas Daher, a CAPS psy
chologist who led two programs at
Roble Hall and the French House
to discuss reactions to the war,
said he believes students are turn
ing to one another to share their
feelings rather than to counseling
services.
"People process their reactions
where they live — on their own
turf," Daher said.
Several students said if they
wanted to talk to someone about
the war, they would seek out their
friends first, then a resident assis
tant, resident fellow or a parent.
One freshman, Otero resident
Atman Shah, said he feels turning
to CAPS or the Bridge for support
would be a "last line."
Edwards said students are
more inclined to provide compan
ionship and support for each other
during this time of stress.
Daher, who ran the Roble pro
gram shortly after the war began,
said although students' immedi
ate reactions to the war were feel
ings of helplessness, fear and frus
tration, some now feel ambivalent
and confused.
Julie La'Bassiere, a sophomore
who attended Daher's program in
the French House last week, said,
"I don't know if I'd go to a support
group. It's hard to share your feel
ings in a group, especially when
you're not sure of them."
Daher said he expects atten
dance at CAPS sessions to
increase soon. "Six to eight to ten
weeks later, people will come in,
not with war as their primary con
cern, but with other issues that
are aggravated given the fact that
they have been under extra
stress."
CAPS also holds a weekly coun
seling session from 11:30 a.m. to 1
p.m. Mondays for students with
relatives in the Persian Gulf.
