# Two film war documentary

### Connie Chang Editorial Staff 
Since the beginning of the Persian
Gulf crisis, Jed Friedman and Alex
Edmonds have been worrying about
their friends in Israel. So when fighting
actually started, they wanted to do more
than just watch television. They decided
to make it.
With video equipment and general
assistance from XTV the two sopho
mores are filming a television documen
tary of Stanford events during the Per
sian Gulf war. Friedman and Edmonds
said they intend to chronicle all war
related events on campus but hope to
edit a short piece by the end of this quar
ter.
To date, the students have filmed the
Middle East Teach-in held three weeks
ago and several demonstrations in sup
port of and in opposition to the war.
They have also interviewed students and
faculty members.
"In a way, we want to take a position,
but not directly," Edmonds said. Both
students said they are against the war.
Edmonds said although he will try to
remain objective, he does not think any
one can be purely objective.
Edmonds said that when word of the
war first reached Stanford, he and
Friedman became angry and frustrated

and went to San Francisco to join the
anti-war demonstrations. A week later,
they made a commitment not to let per
sonal feelings interfere with getting the
video project done, he said.
Friedman said he wants the Univer
sity to keep the master tapes and raw
footage in an archive on campus so
future Stanford students and faculty
can watch it and "try to understand
what went on here."
He said he and Edmonds have not yet
chosen an exact focus for their docu
mentary, adding that he has shot
enough footage to do several different
types of documentaries.
The two students are not alone on
campus in making war-related docu
mentaries. Several other students tak
ing Assoc. Communication Prof. Jan
Krawitz's film production class are
working on film documentaries about
the war to fulfill their course require
ments.
Krawitz said making such films is
important because "getting video out
there will change attitudes."
One film explores stereotypes of
Arabs during the war period. Another
student is using the "relationship
between video games and perception of
the war as a metaphor" for his project,
Krawitz said.
