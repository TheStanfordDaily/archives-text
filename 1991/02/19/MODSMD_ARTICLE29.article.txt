# 'The novelty is wearing off'
## War no longer focus of everyday life in Roble

Editor's note: The reporter's goal
in writing this story was deter
mining how life in Roble Hall, a
four-class undergraduate resi
dence, has been affected by the
Persian Gulf War. He is not a res
ident of the dormitory.
On the evening of Jan. 16,
Roble Hall residents packed their
lounge instead of their dining hall.
Mesmerized by network reports
on the outbreak of war in the
Gulf, more than 100 residents
spent their eating and study time
glued to the television set.
Late Saturday afternoon, a
month after the war began, only
six people gathered around the
Roble lounge television, reclining
on the sofa rather than poised on
the edge of their chairs. This time,
despite a sign that reserved the
television "for news," the stu
dents watched the Cardinal men's

basketball team play the UCLA
Bruins.
Although some students partic
ipated in rallies and a teach-in
after the fighting broke out, dis
cussion of the war has taken a
increasingly less prominent role
in Roble, some students said.
"At the beginning, you couldn't
walk across Roble lounge because
there were bodies all over the
floor," said Robert Robinson,
Roble's resident fellow. "Now,
when you go in there, there will be
maybe ten people watching the
evening news. People are going
back to their studies, parties and
life," he said.
"When you look around,
there's less interest," said Jeff
Neal, a senior in Roble. Despite
that, he said people are still very
concerned about the war. "I'm not
distraught that people aren't in
front of the television. There are a
lot of people still keeping up and
putting newspaper clips up on the

walls."
"But people are more busy and
the novelty is wearing off," he
noted.
Some students say there are
fewer debates about the issues
now because no matter how hard
they argue, they cannot convince
their opponents to change their
minds.
"After a while, you know which
way people are leaning," said
freshman Suzanne Lee, who
opposes the war. "You learn to just
kind of avoid it to keep the peace."
She said her disagreements
with other students over the war
have made her more political. "I
was much more moderate before
the war started," she said.
Her next door neighbor, fresh
man John Chung, is someone she
has previously tried unsuccess
fully to sway to her point of view.
"I pretty much support this

Roble neighbors freshmen John Chung and Suzanne Lee often debate Issues concerning the war. Lee,
who Is against the conflict, said disagreeing with other students has made her 'more political.'
