# 'The novelty is wearing off'
## War no longer focus of everyday life in Roble 
### John Louie Staff Writer 
Editor's note: The reporter's goal
in writing this story was deter
mining how life in Roble Hall, a
four-class undergraduate resi
dence, has been affected by the
Persian Gulf War. He is not a res
ident of the dormitory.
On the evening of Jan. 16,
Roble Hall residents packed their
lounge instead of their dining hall.
Mesmerized by network reports
on the outbreak of war in the
Gulf, more than 100 residents
spent their eating and study time
glued to the television set.
Late Saturday afternoon, a
month after the war began, only
six people gathered around the
Roble lounge television, reclining
on the sofa rather than poised on
the edge of their chairs. This time,
despite a sign that reserved the
television "for news," the stu
dents watched the Cardinal men's

basketball team play the UCLA
Bruins.
Although some students partic
ipated in rallies and a teach-in
after the fighting broke out, dis
cussion of the war has taken a
increasingly less prominent role
in Roble, some students said.
"At the beginning, you couldn't
walk across Roble lounge because
there were bodies all over the
floor," said Robert Robinson,
Roble's resident fellow. "Now,
when you go in there, there will be
maybe ten people watching the
evening news. People are going
back to their studies, parties and
life," he said.
"When you look around,
there's less interest," said Jeff
Neal, a senior in Roble. Despite
that, he said people are still very
concerned about the war. "I'm not
distraught that people aren't in
front of the television. There are a
lot of people still keeping up and
putting newspaper clips up on the

walls."
"But people are more busy and
the novelty is wearing off," he
noted.
Some students say there are
fewer debates about the issues
now because no matter how hard
they argue, they cannot convince
their opponents to change their
minds.
"After a while, you know which
way people are leaning," said
freshman Suzanne Lee, who
opposes the war. "You learn to just
kind of avoid it to keep the peace."
She said her disagreements
with other students over the war
have made her more political. "I
was much more moderate before
the war started," she said.
Her next door neighbor, fresh
man John Chung, is someone she
has previously tried unsuccess
fully to sway to her point of view.
"I pretty much support this

war.... I think for [Bush] to be
effective, he had to come down as
hard as he did," Chung said.
He said his three roommates
also "pretty much support the
war. He added that Lee is in the
minority, "although she tends to
be more vocal."
Fayyaz Nurmohamed, a fresh
man from Canada, said it has been
a while since any real discussion
has occurred in the dorm. "It's
difficult to keep the war as a real
part of your life right now. In a
real sense it's very distant," he
said.
He added, however, that he
feels it is important for him to
keep up with the news. The Per
sian Gulf war is the first one that
he can try to understand "as it
happens," he said.
Nurmohamed said the media
have caused complacency in the
public. "They play a big role in
saturating us with information, so
that we become numb to the war
and the reality of it all."
Some Roble residents have
tried to actively voice their opin
ions on the war. Freshman Helen
Tjioe, a concert pianist, partici
pated in anti-war demonstrations
on campus and in San Francisco.
"I can handle activism and home

work, but it has gotten in the way
of my music," he said.
Tjioe said her musical back
ground has made her more recep
tive to the emotions arisen from
the war. "When you see such dark
ness in people's hearts, it's really
frightening," she said.
She added that she is irritated
by people who "aren't bothered by
the war" and consider it impor
tant. "They don't want to think
about it. That's frustrating to
see."
Junior Steve Breinberg, who
supports the war, also expressed
frustration at some students' lack
of interest. "What disturbs me the
most is the attitude on this cam
pus to just stand by and watch a
sick man get out of control with
his powers," he said.
Breinberg said he is concerned
about family members living in
Tel Aviv, Israel. "I am always on
the phone with my parents" talk
ing about other relatives in the
Gulf, he said. "But you can't let it
dominate your whole life. It will
drive you crazy."
Breinberg cited the attacks on
Israel as turning points for many
Roble residents' positions on the
war. "Lately, more people have
been starting to take the position
that I hold," he said.
"I think many students have
come to decide for themselves that
diplomacy only had so much
potential," he said.

'You can't let it domi
nate your whole life. It
will drive you crazy.'

Like Breinberg, some of Nur
mohamed's concerns arise from
his cultural heritage. "As a Mus
lim ... I've been concerned with
the impact that the war is having
on the image of Islam" because it
is occurring in a part of the world
associated with Islam, he said.
"I have heard a lot questions
about the Muslim role and stand
point. But I think that is benefi
cial because it's better to have
questions than to go on the erro
neous information that the media
is providing," he said.
Although the war has pitted
some Muslims and Jews against
each other, Nurmohamed said he
has not felt any tension between
himself and Craig Alexander, his
Jewish roommate.
"There hasn't been any tension
because Craig and I are willing to
listen to each other and realize it's
very much a political and eco
nomic war," Nurmohamed said. "I
don't think we stand on different
sides of the issue in that respect."
"Personally, I'm not scared
because I'm at Stanford, and I
think people are on the whole
intelligent and open-minded,"
Nurmohamed said.
