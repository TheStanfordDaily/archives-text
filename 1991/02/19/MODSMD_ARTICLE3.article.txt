# Gulf war touches Stanford lives — lightly
## 
### Mike Laris Editorial staff 
So this is life on the margin of war.
Wartime at Stanford has been very similar to
peacetime at Stanford. Midterms go on. Games are
played. Students laugh with their friends. A few peo
ple engage in strenuous debates. And overall, most
plans continue right on track.
And yet, the Stanford community is affected by
war.
Some Stanford athletes wear American flags on
their uniforms and talk among themselves and with
their coaches about war.
One student, Marine reservist Chris Norte, sits by
the phone with his bags packed waiting for the call
that would send him to fight in Kuwait.
Freshmen neighbors in Roble Hall argue until
finally they decide they will never be able to convince
the other to change their minds about the war.
An emergency surgery professor at the Medical
School supplements his course with a section on how
to treat injured soldiers scorched as they try to
escape a burning tank.
Activists, as they have from the beginning of time,
condemn the "apathetic" masses.
Some students, with tears in their eyes, curse the
television picture of President Bush, who they feel
has usurped too much power over the actions of their
country.
Still others organize a letter writing campaign for
a Marine company in the Gulf that requested that
Stanford students and faculty write.
War has forced on Stanford a complex set of rela
tionships and events. As a massive ground battle
approaches, many in the Stanford community are
still trying to understand how life has changed thus
far. If the war escalates, life here will continue to be
off balance, but for most of us, it will probably con
tinue almost as planned.

Alexandra Fuchs, a senior in comparative literature, writes a paper in Green Library. Halfway around the world, more than
a million soldiers are preparing for a desert ground war that may begin this week. Despite the significance of the moment,
much of Stanford life goes on as usual.
