"The people concerned
about the war seem to be few
in number and are drifting
around the margins of White
Plaza.... I think that's
because there's widespread
support underneath for what
we're doing "
— Charles Hill, Hoover
senior research fellow

"We have not really experi
enced war on our soil. We've
brought war to other people's
soil, but most Americans
have no direct understanding
of what it means to be the tar
get of someone else's
bombs."
— Clayborne Carson, associ
ate professor of history
