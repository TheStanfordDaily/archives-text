# Wartime at Stanford
## Looking forward to war Senior anticipates phone call sending him to Gulf 
### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Staff writer 
Now 28 years old and preparing
for war, senior Chris Norte always
knew a call to arms was possible
when he made the decision to join
the Marine reserves.
"The recruiters told me there
would be no promises, anything
could happen," the lance corporal
explained. "They said it would be
tough and challenging and that a
lot of the rewards would be intan
gible."
Now, as Operation Desert
Storm roars into its second month
and the probability of a ground
war heightens, Norte not only
expects the phone call which could
send him to the front lines, he
welcomes it.
As Norte awaits the possible
activation of his regiment — the
First Beach and Port Company of
San Jose — the student-soldier's
thoughts drift from the Stanford
campus to the Marine bunkers of
the desert.
"It is hard for me to Le here
when I know people who I have
trained with since day one .. . are
over there," he said. "There is this
tremendous sense of being a part
of this team that I take very seri
ously," Norte added.
In these days of waiting, Norte,
his hair cropped after a recent

encounter with a barber's clip
pers, is not enrolled in classes. He
still must complete two quarters
of course work before he gets his
degree.
He passes time by working as a
videotape coordinator for the
Department of Athletics. He
recently returned from a trip to
Minnesota to visit family and
friends and to bid them farewell
should his company be activated.
Trained as a radio field opera
tor, Norte said he is prepared for
war. "I'm ready to go. I nave had
my bags packed for four months,"
he said.
Norte said he has been eager to
serve, even in war, since he joined
the Marines four years ago. He
noted he was inspired by a former
co-worker and veteran of the
armed forces who told him he
would make a good officer.
Although Norte, an intermit
tent student at Stanford since
1980, is paying for his own educa
tion, he did not join the reserves
to finance his schooling, he said.
"I'm very much into public ser
vice and I wanted to do something
that was service-oriented. I also
wanted a personal challenge," he
added.
But in 1987, less than one
third of the way through boot
camp — likened by enlistees to "a
summer camp from hell" — Norte

It is hard for me to be
here when I know
people who I have
trained with since day
one ... are over
there.'

developed a corneal ulcer and was
discharged.
"Before I left, my senior drill
instructor pulled me aside and
said, 'Go home, get better and
come back,'" Norte recalled. "I
was disappointed about leaving,
but I knew I would be back. I
loved the organization and I
wanted to be a Marine." he said
Norte later returned to the
Marines as a reservist. He was
planning to finish his Stanford
course work and then apply to the
Marine's officer candidate school.
Then the Persian Gulf War
broke out.
Now the life plan that seemed
so certain for Norte has been cast
in doubt. He does not know
exactly when or if he will be called.
Nor does he know where he will be
sent.
"The only thing I do know is
my job is to provide communica
tion wherever and whenever it is

needed," he said.
Norte said the role of war com
municator could make him a
prime target for Iraqi gun sights,
but the Marine is confident.
"You can die doing anything,"
he said. "I have a job to do and I
will do it to the best of my ability,"
he added.
The San Francisco native is not

the first in his family to serve in
the military. He stands in the
shadow of a father who attended
the U.S. Military Academy and
later transferred to the U.S. Air
Force Academy. Norte's brother is
also a Marine.
But his Marine company, not
his biological family, is responsible
for imbuing him with a sense of

camaraderie, military pride, and
sense of duty, Norte said.
It is this notion of obligation
and duty, he said, that gives him a
positive outlook on the war when
the country's nerves are tense.
"I have plans to come back,"
said Norte, who turns 29 in two
days. "I'm going to buy a L-Z Boy
recliner to chill in when I am 30."

loved the organization and I
wanted to be a Marine." he said
Norte later returned to the
Marines as a reservist. He was
planning to finish his Stanford
course work and then apply to the
Marine's officer candidate school.
Then the Persian Gulf War
broke out.
Now the life plan that seemed
so certain for Norte has been cast
in doubt. He does not know
exactly when or if he will be called.
Nor does he know where he will be
sent.
"The only thing I do know is
my job is to provide communica
tion wherever and whenever it is

needed," he said.
Norte said the role of war com
municator could make him a
prime target for Iraqi gun sights,
but the Marine is confident.
"You can die doing anything,"
he said. "I have a job to do and I
will do it to the best of my ability,"
he added.
The San Francisco native is not

the first in his family to serve in
the military. He stands in the
shadow of a father who attended
the U.S. Military Academy and
later transferred to the U.S. Air
Force Academy. Norte's brother is
also a Marine.
But his Marine company, not
his biological family, is responsible
for imbuing him with a sense of

camaraderie, military pride, and
sense of duty, Norte said.
It is this notion of obligation
and duty, he said, that gives him a
positive outlook on the war when
the country's nerves are tense.
"I have plans to come back,"
said Norte, who turns 29 in two
days. "I'm going to buy a L-Z Boy
recliner to chill in when I am 30."
