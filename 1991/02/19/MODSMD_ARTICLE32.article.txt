# 'Traumatic' experience awaits medical teams
## Ground war in Gulf will pose special problems, prof. says 
### Kaarin Michaelson Staff writer 
If a ground war begins in the
Persian Gulf, some U.S. military
personnel will not be firing bullets
or artillery shells across the desert
sand. Instead, they will be fight
ing in evacuation hospitals, trying
to save the lives of the wounded.
Being part of a medical team in
a war zone is "almost as traumatic
as being out there doing the actual
fighting," said Dr. Ward True
blood, a Medical School professor
who from 1966 to 1967 served as a
surgeon at an Army evacuation
hospital near Da Nang in Viet
nam.
Trueblood, who is on the gen
eral surgery clinical faculty, said
the stress and strain medical per
sonnel experience in war is
"incredible."
"There is a definite burnout
factor involved, just like there is
in the field," he said.
Trueblood said the tactical sit
uation in the Gulf may create spe
cial problems for medical teams.
Because the Iraqis have shoulder
fired ground-to-air missiles, evac
uation helicopters will not be able
to fly directly to the front line to
pick up casualties, he said.
Instead, the wounded will have
to be carried by stretcher from the
front line to a waiting ambulance
that will take them to a helicopter
for a several mile flight to a hospi
tal, Trueblood said.
"Medical transport will, in
effect, be jumping back a genera
tion. The last time stretcher bear
ers were widely used was in Korea
and World War II," he said.
Trueblood added that the time
lost in transit to the hospital may
make it more difficult to treat
casualties. "A lot of fluid and blood
can be lost in the hour it will take
to reach medical care. . . . Some

soldiers may not make it to the
hospital alive," he said.
At the hospitals, teams of
physicians and assistants will take
incoming casualties to the triage
unit, where "sorting" of injuries
takes place, he said. Those most
critically iryured will be X-rayed
and treated first.
If chemical weapons are used in
the fighting, treatment could be
slowed even further. Wounded sol
diers would have to be rinsed by
overhead showers to remove
traces of the chemicals before doc
tors could assess other injuries,
Trueblood said.
Trueblood also said he expects
surgeons in the Gulf to treat "lots
of land mine injuries, along with
the usual gunshot wounds from
artillery rounds." In addition,
there will likely be a high number
of burn injuries among soldiers in
tanks that are hit by missiles, he
added.
While no doctors from the Med
ical School or Stanford Hospital
are currently in the Gulf or in the
reserves, the war could affect
them in the future, said Dr. Marc
Nelson, assistant professor of
emergency medicine at the Medi
cal School.
"We're very concerned about
the possible drafting of emergency
physicians, which the armed
forces have recently recognized as
a specialty," he said.
"Several of the past few [Stan
ford Medical] Journal club meet
ings have been devoted to issues
like the possible draft and updates
on the kinds of injuries that we
could expect should we be sent
overseas," Nelson said.
Nelson, who teaches an emer
gency medicine course called
Essential Surgical Techniques,
