# Quiet campus irks activists
## 
### Michael Friedly Senior staff writer 
After an initial flurry of student concern
about the war, including a two-day teach-in,
most Stanford students have settled into a lull
where the war takes the back seat to mid terms
and problem sets, campus activists assert.
Students on both sides of the war issue say
they have had trouble getting students
involved in war-related activities. "Unfortu
nately, this campus tends to be very apathetic,"
said freshman Mark Weber. "It takes quite a bit
to get people stirred up."
Weber chairs the conservative group Stu
dents for America, which supports the U.S. war
effort in the Gulf.
"Things have been really quiet because . . .
after a while people get sick of [hearing about
the war]. They go back to their normal
lifestyle; midterms get more important," he
said.
"Now that the war has started, people feel
like they can't do anything," said Jennifer
Pearson, a member of Stanford Students for
Peace in the Middle East. "People don't feel
[the warl as close to home as they did during
the 19605," she said. The lack of a draft has a
lot to do with that.
Stanford students "do not know the value of
making a visible display of their feelings"
through protests, said Pearson, a junior in
feminist studies.
Another Students for Peace member, senior
Erin Clune, concurred. "Its hard to pull people
out of their rooms to protest a war," she said.
"People are more concerned with the mun
dane, everyday concerns about getting ahead in
the world than they are about changing the
world for the better," said History Prof. Clay
borne Carson. "[lt's] a fairly ordinary human
trait to be more concerned with immediate
things than with long-range concerns.
"I don't see that changing," he added.
Weber said, "If there is a ground war, that
will maybe keep people's attention for all of
three days." It is difficult to get people's atten
tion for more than that, he added.
"I think a lot of people are having trouble
deciding how they feel," Weber said, citing the
lack of concrete, reliable informa
tion on the war from the govern
ment as the largest reason for
students' inability to make up
their minds.
Many activists are also saying
UC-Berkeley, the center of anti
war protests during the Vietnam
war, is apathetic. After a week of
rallies that attracted thousands of
protesters, "people kind of ran
out of steam," said Jennifer
Packer, an editor at the Daily Cal

ifornian.
UC-Berkeley students
returned for classes from winter
break Jan. 22, almost a week after
the war began. "Everyone went
crazy for the first week (of
school)," Packer said. But now,
"everything is totally quiet."
"The majority of students are
turned off by a lot of the tactics
(of the anti-war protesters)" such
as trying to close down the uni

versity and "a lot of screaming
and shouting in the middle of the
afternoon," Packer said.
A nightly candlelight vigil
protesting the war began late last
year and is still being held,
although "it has certainly died
down," Packer said.
"Initially people got scared,
but I think that people automati
cally settle into their routines"
and forget about the war, she said.
