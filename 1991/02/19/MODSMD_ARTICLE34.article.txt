Taped to a blackboard to the left of the
Axe in the Tresidder Union lobby is a let
ter scrawled from somewhere in the Per
sian Gulf.
The letter, written by Marine Cpl. Mar
vin Esper, reads, "I am currently deployed
in Saudi Arabia. We would like to have the
faculty and students of Stanford Univer
sity to correspond by mail to the Marines
of Alpha Company. All letters will be
greatly appreciated."
Esper is a member of the Ist batallion
of the sth Marine regiment, which is nor
mally stationed at Camp Pendleton, near

San Diego.
ASSU senate associate John Hall, a
freshman, saw the letter last week and
began organizing a letter-writing cam
paign between Stanford students and the
Esper's Marine company. Hall has
worked closely in the project with head
dorm representatives, who endorsed the
idea Friday.
"It seems like a good hands-on way to
get people to think about the situation,"
said sophomore A.R. Jones, who coordi
nates the dorm representative program.
"What really excited us is that Stanford
had been specifically asked to write let
ters."
Dorm representatives said they are

planning to promote the campaign at
house meetings across campus tomorrow
night. They will urge people to write let
ters and give them to their dorm repre
sentatives along with a quarter to cover
most of the postage.
Funding for the program, including
stamp subsidies and promotional materi
als, will come out of the dorm representa
tive program's annual budget of $600,
Hall said.
The campaign does not have a specific
budget, but if necessary, the dorm repre
sentatives will seek discretionary funds
from the ASSU Senate to cover additional
expenses, Jones said.
Hall said he considers the campaign

politically neutral. "Regardless of the
philosophical opinion that students have
of the war, I think there is a very clear
consensus among the Stanford popula
tion that we want to do everything possi
ble to express our personal, emotional
and moral support for the men and
women in the Gulf," he said.
Both proponents and opponents of the
war have expressed support for the letter
writing campaign.
"It's great that regardless of differ
ences of opinion we can support the
troops," said sophomore John Flores, vice
chairman of the Stanford chapter of Stu
dents for America, a new conservative
organization. "The letter-writing cam

paign gives a great opportunity to support
the troops in a non-partisan way."
Senior Kim Milligan, a member of
Stanford Students for Peace in the Middle
East, said she was in the process of orga
nizing a similar campaign but decided to
defer to the dorm representatives.
Hall said he expects positive student
reaction to the campaign.
"There's so much protest; it's nice to
consider the people as individuals," Jones
said.
The military does not release informa
tion on names or locations of soldiers, but
letters to Esper's company can be sent to
Alpha Co. 1/5, FPO San Francisco, CA,
96608-5508.
