## Bruin backcourt burns Stanford in 89-86 thriller 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
Crunch Time crunched the
Stanford men's basketball team
again on Saturday afternoon, as
the UCLA Bruins came up with
the right plays at the right times
to snap a five-game losing streak
against the Cardinal with an emo
tional 89-86 win at sold-out
Maples Pavilion.

Men's Basketball

Bruins 89
Cardinal 86

With 3:45 left in the game,
Stanford's Adam Keefe had
grabbed a rebound and hit a layup
to make it 79-79, erasing the last
of a five-point lead the Bruins had
held only one minute before.
Then, with a diving, brilliant steal
by Kenny Ammann, the Cardinal
had the ball. After trailing virtu
ally the entire game — by as much
as 11 — the Cardinal had the
momentum. The Cardinal had a
chance to take the lead.
The Cardinal scored one point
in the next three minutes.
Two straight turnovers and an
off-balance missed shot killed
Stanford during those three min
utes, as the Bruins got a huge
three-pointer from guard Gerald
Madkins to take the lead with
2:35 left and then iced the game —
barely — at the foul line.
Even two absolutely unbeliev
able three-pointers by John
Patrick in the final 23 seconds
couldn't get Stanford out of its
hole: after Patrick's second three
(a no-arc how-the-hell-did-that
go-in line-drive from between two
defenders) got the Cardinal
within one with four seconds left,
Madkins stepped to the line, hit
two free throws and put the game
out of reach. A shot from Kenny
Hicks at the buzzer hit the side of
the rim, and the Bruins had a
huge monkey off their backs.
"We had a lot of inner motiva
tion for this game," said Madkins,
who scored a career-high 21

points to lead the Bruins (18-7, 6-
6 and fifth in the Pacific 10 Con
ference). "I was a redshirt the last
time we beat them in L.A. It was
wearing on our nerves."
"That's a missed opportunity
for us," said Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery, whose team is now
14-10, 7-7 and fifth in the Pac-10.
"We had a chance, but we didn't
play as well as we needed to at the
right times to beat a team of that
caliber. ... It seemed the pressure
was always on us, we were always
having to play catch-up. In the
last three minutes, had we made
all the plays the pressure would
have been on UCLA."
The loss certainly was a missed
opportunity, for the Bruins were
playing without forward Don
Mac Lean, who leads the team in
both scoring and rebounding.
Mac Lean took an elbow to the
right eye against California last
Thursday, and the eye was still
swollen and his vision blurry by
game time Saturday. He watched
the game in a particularly grue
some green suit — and, ironically,
gave his teammates a little extra
incentive.
"We have enough talent to win
without key people," Madkins
said. "Normally, with Don and
Tracy (Murray, who was ham
pered by a sore hip), we've got two
great scorers and the rest of us
have our own roles. Today we just
said 'Look, no more role players'
and went out and played. ... We
wanted to prove we could step up
and overcome losing Don."
Madkins and point guard Dar
rick Martin (20 points) stepped
up, over, around and through the
Cardinal defense all afternoon,
blowing by defenders as if they
weren't there and slicing their
way to the basket for easy hoops.
A typical Stanford possession took
20 to 30 seconds as the Cardinal
worked the ball around; a typical
UCLA possession lasted maybe
the five seconds it took Martin to
run the length of the court, spin
around a few times and hit a
layup.

Adam Keefe tried to outsmart the officials in the waning moments
of Saturday's 89-86 loss to UCLA. Keefe tried to call a timeout
when Stanford didn't have any, then denied he did it, but despite
an impressive argument, he couldn't fool the zebras.
"We didn't do a good job mark
ing their guards at all," Mont
gomery said. "That really hurt
us." Stanford went into a zone to
stop the penetration in the first
half, but then freshman Shon
Tarver (15 points) hit three quick
treys and that was all she wrote
for the zone.
Of course, the Bruins didn't do
a very good job on Stanford's
guards either, but they at least
kept Patrick and Ammann from
getting hot at the same time:
Ammann had 11 points, all of
them in the first half; Patrick
(who made six of his nine three
point attempts) had a game-high
22 — all of them in the second
half.
"I think they're the best guards
in America when they play us,"
UCLA coach Jim Harrick said.
Harrick should know a little
something about talent, because
he coaches two of the best players
in the Pac-10: Murray, who had 18
in spite of making only five of his
15 shots, and Mac Lean, who
won't be out much longer with his
eye trouble.
Without Mac Lean's 23.4
points per game, the Bruins still
scored 89 — tying the highest
total scored against Stanford this

year. "Our defensive effort wasn't
very good," Montgomery said.
Without Mac Lean's 7.6 boards
per game, the Bruins still outre
bounded the Cardinal, 32-30.
Both Deshon Wingate and Brent
Williams (who scored a career
high 14 in his first start) had nine
rebounds for* Stanford and Keefe
added seven, but that was it.
Without Mac Lean's .843 mark
at the line, the Bruins still hit 25
of their 33 free throws (.758).
Mitchell Butler, who normally hits
at a blistering .492 clip, was 7-for
-9 — 3-for-4 in the final 43 sec
onds.
"They made the plays down the
stretch, they got the rebounds
after missed shots and we didn't,"
Keefe said. "They deserved to
win."
