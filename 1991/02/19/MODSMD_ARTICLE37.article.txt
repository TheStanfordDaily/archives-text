# Madkins, Martin steal the show

### Robert Pardington Senior staff writer 
UCLA guard Gerald Madkins
looks like the Bruin mascot with
his big cheeks and bald head.
Backcourt mate Darrick Martin
looks like someone's little brother,
with his smallish face and big
grin. The Madkins-Martin combi
nation, despite their harmless
looks, devastated Stanford's
defense Saturday afternoon, help
ing the Bruins to an 89-86 victory.
The starting backcourt for
UCLA totaled 41 points on 15-for
-22 shooting. Madkins had a
career-high 21, including a trio of
three-pointers.
Martin dropped in 20, to go
along with five rebounds, three
assists and a steal. Using his great
quickness, Martin was able to
make countless sorties into the
paint. He was especially effective
in the second half, making five out
of his six shots.
Madkins and Martin had to
step it up a notch because of the
temporary loss of forward Don
Mac Lean. Mac Lean was averaging
23.4 points per game, a sizable
chunk of offense to compensate
for.
"M and M boys" is the nick
name that folks around Westwood
have dubbed Mac Lean and for
ward Tracy Murray, who had been
averaging 21.5 points per contest.
Saturday, it was a different set of
M's who did the job for the Bru
ins.
Madkins stressed that UCLA
has players who can step up their
production when the star goes
down.
"If (Mac Lean) doesn't play, we
have enough talent to win without
him," Madkins said. "People say
we're not as good of a team with
out Don but that's just not true.
Today we just said 'No more role
players,' we have to step up."
"UCLA is pretty doggone
good," Stanford coach Mike Mont
gomery said. "They have a wealth
of athletes ... it's not like missing

one player is going to hurt them."
Madkins said that losing
Mac Lean was not really a blow to
the team in the sense that it
"added incentive." The junior
shooting guard responded to that
incentive.
On one possession in the first
half, the shot clock had wound
down to five seconds, and the
Stanford students were doing the
old "false countdown" trick, so
that Madkins thought he had to
shoot. He pulled up and shot a
hurried 22 footer — and hit noth
ing but net.
Then, in the second half, Mad
kins hit what was probably the
most significant shot of the game,
draining a three-pointer with 2:35
to play that put UCLA ahead for
good at 82-79.
"I thought Madkin's three
pointer was the key play of the
game," UCLA coach Jim Harrick
said.
Montgomery pointed to poor
defense on the perimeter as the
reason for Madkins' and Martin's
success.
"We did a very poor job of
squaring their guards," Mont
gomery said. "They took the ball
to the hoop.
"I knew that with Mac Lean
out, Martin would take a much
bigger role. ... It was the penetra
tion that was hurting us."
Cardinal guard John Patrick,
who had a career high of his own
with 22 points — all in the second
half — had trouble with Martin all
night on defense.
"He's very quick," Patrick said.
The Madkins and Martin show
overshadowed great performances
from Patrick, who hit six of nine
three-pointers, and freshman
Brent Williams.
McLean should be back in the
Bruin lineup Thursday, but he
jokingly wondered if he should
even bother.
"I'll play Thursday for sure,"
Mac Lean said, before reconsider
ing. "I don't know, now maybe I
shouldn't."
