# Women sweep USC, UCLA in Los Angeles
## 
### David Hirning Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES — As both Stanford basketball
teams have learned this year, there are no gimmes in
the Pacific 10 Conference. Especially on the second
game of a road trip, with your starting center unable
to play
Despite these factors, and the 24 first-half points
of UCLA's Rahema Stephens, the Cardinal women's
team overcame the odds and a 17-point UCLA lead
to beat the Bruins Sunday, 91-77. The win gave
Stanford a road sweep here, after it bested USC on
Friday, 76-58.

The Cardinal coach Tara VanDerveer did not
know if senior co-captain Trisha Stevens would play
until "five minutes before the game," VanDerveer
said. It was then that Stevens, who re-aggravated
her sore right knee two weeks ago in practice, and
team doctors decided she could not go against the
Bruins.
It was the second game in the last four that
Stevens has not suited up, after starting 73 consecu
tive contests. "We're going to rest her the next two
weeks," VanDerveer said.
Without her money player, VanDerveer turned to
Cardinal forwards Julie Zeilstra and Val Whiting for
a short-term loan. The move paid off, as both had
career nights. Zeilstra grabbed a career-high 15
rebounds to go with 32 points, while Whiting had a
career-high 26 points and added 14 boards in the
come-from-behind victory over the Bruins.
"It's probably our biggest team win of the year,"
VanDerveer said. "It was on the road, without every
one healthy, on a second night... we could have had
all kinds of excuses, but our team wasn't willing to
use them."
The win also loomed large in the Pac-10 race as
Stanford (19-4,12-1) stayed one game in front of sec
ond-place Washington, which won twice at home
over the weekend.
"We looked at it as the Pac-10 championship right
here," said forward Chris MacMurdo, who stepped
into the starting lineup with Stevens out and had
eight points and five rebounds. "Every game is for
the championship from here on out."
The Cardinal looked like anything but a champi
onship team in the first half against the Bruins,
trailing at one point 35-18. Stephens, the UCLA
junior who leads the conference in scoring at 26 ppg,
lit up Stanford with a variety of spinning layups and
acrobatic jumpers. By the end of the nightmarish 20
minutes, Stephens had more than half of the Bruins'
44 points and UCLA led by 10.
"You try guarding her," VanDerveer counter
pointed to this reporter. "She shoots, she's got a
great vertical, she's big...."
Stephens is also extremely competitive, as a sec
ond-half altercation with Stanford's Molly Gooden
bour indicated. Referees quickly separated the
excitable Stephens and the undaunted Goodenbour,
who had been flattened by two Bruins in the paint
several minutes before.
But Cardinal co-captain Sonja Henning has a
competitive nature as well, and showed it by limiting

Sophomore Val Whiting helped spark a Stanford comeback, leading the Cardinal over UCLA in
Westwood. Whiting had yet another double-double to bring the Cardinal back from a 17-polnt deficit
and finished with a career-high 26 points.
Stephens to just 10 second-half
points.
Two Zeilstra free throws con
cluded a 23-12 run that finally
caught the Bruins and put Stan
ford ahead 57-56 with 12 minutes
left in the game.
"I was getting excited," said
MacMurdo of the Cardinal's out
burst. "It's great when the whole
team pulls together — it makes it
much more fun."
"We just dug down a little
deeper, reached down and pushed
for something extra," VanDerveer
said.
The big deficit and loss of
Stevens forced VanDerveer to play
five players almost exclusively in
the second half. Henning and
Whiting went wire-to-wire with

40 minutes of time, while Zeilstra
played 39.
The same three players did
yeoman's work Friday against the
Trojans, who were thought to
pose the greater threat to the Car
dinal on the trip.
USC's Lisa Leslie had 21
points and 10 rebounds to lead the
home team before fouling out
with 2:35 remaining in the game.
It was her fifth straight disqualifi
cation on fouls.
It was a relatively close game
until USC went to a zone defense
midway through the first half.
VanDerveer promptly inserted
sophomore Molly Goodenbour,
who scolded the Trojans' choice of
defense with three treys and a
two-point bucket.
Stanford almost lost the entire
lead in the opening five minutes of
the second half, much as UCLA
would two days later. The Cardi
nal came out cold, while the Tro-

Jans ran off eight straight to cut
the lead to 43-36.
Stanford might have gone the
rest of the half without a bucket if
Leslie had managed to convert an
attempted dunk and electrify all
757 in attendance. The shot came
two minutes into the half after
the 6-foot-5 Leslie blocked
Stevens's shot and raced down

well short, and the ball bounced
off the front of the rim and away.
Whiting finally broke the run
with an eight-footer with 15:53
left in the game. USC narrowed
the gap to six when Linda
Kennedy hit a three-pointer a
minute later, but Stanford finally
got untracked behind Whiting
and the Trojans never got closer.
