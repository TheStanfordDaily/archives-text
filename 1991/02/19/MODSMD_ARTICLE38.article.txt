# Women sweep USC, UCLA in Los Angeles

LOS ANGELES â€” As both Stanford basketball
teams have learned this year, there are no gimmes in
the Pacific 10 Conference. Especially on the second
game of a road trip, with your starting center unable
to play
Despite these factors, and the 24 first-half points
of UCLA's Rahema Stephens, the Cardinal women's
team overcame the odds and a 17-point UCLA lead
to beat the Bruins Sunday, 91-77. The win gave
Stanford a road sweep here, after it bested USC on
Friday, 76-58.

The Cardinal coach Tara VanDerveer did not
know if senior co-captain Trisha Stevens would play
until "five minutes before the game," VanDerveer
said. It was then that Stevens, who re-aggravated
her sore right knee two weeks ago in practice, and
team doctors decided she could not go against the
Bruins.
It was the second game in the last four that
Stevens has not suited up, after starting 73 consecu
tive contests. "We're going to rest her the next two
weeks," VanDerveer said.
Without her money player, VanDerveer turned to
Cardinal forwards Julie Zeilstra and Val Whiting for
a short-term loan. The move paid off, as both had
career nights. Zeilstra grabbed a career-high 15
rebounds to go with 32 points, while Whiting had a
career-high 26 points and added 14 boards in the
come-from-behind victory over the Bruins.
"It's probably our biggest team win of the year,"
VanDerveer said. "It was on the road, without every
one healthy, on a second night... we could have had
all kinds of excuses, but our team wasn't willing to
use them."
The win also loomed large in the Pac-10 race as
Stanford (19-4,12-1) stayed one game in front of sec
ond-place Washington, which won twice at home
over the weekend.
"We looked at it as the Pac-10 championship right
here," said forward Chris MacMurdo, who stepped
into the starting lineup with Stevens out and had
eight points and five rebounds. "Every game is for
the championship from here on out."
The Cardinal looked like anything but a champi
onship team in the first half against the Bruins,
trailing at one point 35-18. Stephens, the UCLA
junior who leads the conference in scoring at 26 ppg,
lit up Stanford with a variety of spinning layups and
acrobatic jumpers. By the end of the nightmarish 20
minutes, Stephens had more than half of the Bruins'
44 points and UCLA led by 10.
"You try guarding her," VanDerveer counter
pointed to this reporter. "She shoots, she's got a
great vertical, she's big...."
Stephens is also extremely competitive, as a sec
ond-half altercation with Stanford's Molly Gooden
bour indicated. Referees quickly separated the
excitable Stephens and the undaunted Goodenbour,
who had been flattened by two Bruins in the paint
several minutes before.
But Cardinal co-captain Sonja Henning has a
competitive nature as well, and showed it by limiting

Sophomore Val Whiting helped spark a Stanford comeback, leading the Cardinal over UCLA in
Westwood. Whiting had yet another double-double to bring the Cardinal back from a 17-polnt deficit
and finished with a career-high 26 points.
