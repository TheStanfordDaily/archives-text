# Card sweeps Rice Owls
## 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
After this past President's Day long week
end, no one who got a chance to hang out under
the sun at Sunken Diamond should ever doubt
the wisdom of Yogi Berra. The old New York
Yankee star once said that the game "ain't over
till it's over," and Stanford proved that his
words make a better philosophy than any off
hand attempt at wit.

Cardinal takes three
from Owls

Ninth-inning heroics highlighted the open
ing and closing games of the series, as the Car
dinal was able to sweep the visiting Rice Owls
and raise its record to 13-2. The Owls fell to 5-
8.
"Our guys don't panic," second baseman
Chris Kemper said. "We have so many talented
people that you know it will happen eventu
ally."
In Stanford's case, it "happened" mostly in
the last half of the ninth. After Jeffery Ham
monds' ninth-inning home run broke a 5-5
deadlock to give the Cardinal a 6-5 win in Sat
urday's opener, Stanford yesterday again
found itself needing some offensive help at the
end of the game. Rice pitcher Rob Howard had
effectively shut down the Cardinal all day with
his fastball and slider, and through eight
innings had given up only three hits, all to
Kemper. The Cardinal went into its last at-bat
down 2-0, but was not ready to fold.
"We just knew that we wern't going to lose,"
Ryan Turner said. "It's a subtle difference, but
the good teams know they have it in them to
win."
After striking out twice, Burnett led off the
inning with a single for the team's first non-
Kemper hit and a suddenly mortal-looking
Howard then walked Cardinal first baseman
David McCarty. After having his way with
Stanford for most of the day, Howard could not
feel too good about his situation. No outs, men
on first and second, and up comes a guy who
you saw hit a clutch homer to win the first
game in the ninth. As some players warmed up
in the Owl bullpen, Rice manager David Hall
decided to have a chat with his two-time All-
Southwest Conference star.
"I wasn't worried about him, I just wanted
to go over the situation," Hall said. "This guy
is a four-year starter, he wasn't nervous; he
knew what had to be done."
The funny thing is that Howard did it, his
team just did not cooperate. Facing off with
Hammonds, Howard was down in the count
before an over-anxious Hammonds went for an
3-0 fastball that wound up in the glove of cen-
ter fielder Donald Allen for the
first out. Howard then got
Turner, hitless for the series, to
ground to shortstop Joe Racina. It
looked like a routine double-play
ball, but as Berra made it so clear,
nothing is ever certain.
Racina bobbled the hard-hit
ball and then turned what should
have been a game ending double
play into a tie score, as his throw
to second soared into right field
and both Burnett and McCarty
scored with Turner advancing to
third. A rattled Howard then saw
the game slip away as Stanford's
next batter, Troy Tallman, took a
fastball to the rightfield wall to
give the Cardinal a 3-2 win.
"We will not have a harder loss
all year," Hall said. "We really
wanted to win this game. We used
our No.l pitcher and it was his
game to win. (Racina) should have
made the play."
The error, and Tallman's sub
sequent ability to get the ball in
the air (something he said later
that he was working to do all day),
gave Stanford pitcher Willie
Adams his team-leading fourth
win against no losses.
"I didn't have my good stuff,
but I was able to keep my concen
tration," the freshman said. "I

was just trying to blank them."
Adams nearly did it, but
slipped in the second inning as he
walked Jason Ogden and then
gave up a home run to Sunday's
losing pitcher, third baseman Jim
Miller. It was Miller's first colle
giate at-bat.
"It was a fast ball that was sup
posed to move away, but it didn't,"
Adams said. "It was not that bad a
pitch, he just got a hold of it."
The long ball was actually the
story of the weekend for the Owls.
Nine of Rice's 11 runs in the
series were due to home runs, and
two of them put the only damper
on Scott Weiss' pitching gem in
Sunday's 10-4 Cardinal win.
Usually a middle reliever, Weiss
was forced to come in early when
starter Jamie Sepeda gave up two
runs after facing the game's first
three batters. Coming in with no
outs and a man on second, Weiss
struck out the next six batters,
winding up with a career high 13
for the day. The only blights on an
otherwise great day were the two
back-to-back homers he gave up
in the sixth that allowed the Owls
to momentarily close Stanford's
lead to 6-4.
"I felt real strong," Weiss said
after the win improved his record
to 3-1 on the year. "The first home
run was the only real mistake I
made; I hung a curve right at his
eyebrows. The second one was a
good pitch, the guy just got to it."
