# Card sweeps Rice Owls

### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
After this past President's Day long week
end, no one who got a chance to hang out under
the sun at Sunken Diamond should ever doubt
the wisdom of Yogi Berra. The old New York
Yankee star once said that the game "ain't over
till it's over," and Stanford proved that his
words make a better philosophy than any off
hand attempt at wit.

Cardinal takes three
from Owls

Ninth-inning heroics highlighted the open
ing and closing games of the series, as the Car
dinal was able to sweep the visiting Rice Owls
and raise its record to 13-2. The Owls fell to 5-
8.
"Our guys don't panic," second baseman
Chris Kemper said. "We have so many talented
people that you know it will happen eventu
ally."
In Stanford's case, it "happened" mostly in
the last half of the ninth. After Jeffery Ham
monds' ninth-inning home run broke a 5-5
deadlock to give the Cardinal a 6-5 win in Sat

found itself needing some offensive help at the
end of the game. Rice pitcher Rob Howard had
effectively shut down the Cardinal all day with
his fastball and slider, and through eight
innings had given up only three hits, all to
Kemper. The Cardinal went into its last at-bat

"We just knew that we wern't going to lose,"
Ryan Turner said. "It's a subtle difference, but
the good teams know they have it in them to
win."
After striking out twice, Burnett led off the
inning with a single for the team's first non-
Kemper hit and a suddenly mortal-looking
Howard then walked Cardinal first baseman
David McCarty. After having his way with
Stanford for most of the day, Howard could not
feel too good about his situation. No outs, men
on first and second, and up comes a guy who
you saw hit a clutch homer to win the first
game in the ninth. As some players warmed up
in the Owl bullpen, Rice manager David Hall
decided to have a chat with his two-time All-
Southwest Conference star.
"I wasn't worried about him, I just wanted
to go over the situation," Hall said. "This guy
is a four-year starter, he wasn't nervous; he
knew what had to be done."
The funny thing is that Howard did it, his
team just did not cooperate. Facing off with
Hammonds, Howard was down in the count
before an over-anxious Hammonds went for an
3-0 fastball that wound up in the glove of cen-
