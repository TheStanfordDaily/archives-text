### Dylan Tyson Editorial staff 
Arturo Islas, Stanford profes
sor of English and award-winning
novelist, died at his home Friday
of AIDS-related complications. He
was 52.
A well-liked professor and aca
demic adviser, Islas was well
known for writing two novels that
chronicle the Chicano/Latino
experience.
Colleagues and students
described him as a dedicated
teacher with a warm personality.
"We will all miss Arturo," said
Fernando de Necochea, assistant
provost and adviser to the presi
dent for Chicano affairs. "He was
a warm, generous caring friend. . .
. He had a wonderful sense of
humor that always gave pleasure
and joy to his students," he added.
"He was an early and steadfast
battler for the place of Chicano lit
erature," de Necochea said. "He

gave it a place at Stanford and in
American letters."
His classes were engaging and
offered a fresh perspective on the
material he taught, students and
faculty said.
He was a skilled writer, lecturer
and professor â€” all three vari
ables will be missed," said senior
Zach Hernandez, who had Islas as
an adviser.
English Prof. Nancy Packer
said, "The course he taught on
Hemingway and Fitzgerald was
one of the most popular non
required, non-introductory
classes in the University."
The Border Regional Library
Conference awarded "The Rain
God," his first novel, its prize for
best fiction in 1983. It was also
named one of the three best nov
els of 1984 by the Bay Area
Reviewers Association.
" 'The Rain God' is very well
established as a classic Chicano
novel," said Luis Leal, literary

critic and professor at the Univer
sity of Illinois.
"Migrant Souls," Islas' second
novel, was the first
Chicano/Latino-authored novel
published by a New York com

pany. But Islas was angered by
this fact.
In an interview last May with
El Observador, a newspaper in El
Paso, Texas, he said the fact that
no Chicano/Latino authors had
been published on the East Coast
before him was "a willful igno
rance on the part of the machines
that produce the books that we
read."
The two novels chronicle a
Mexican-American family and its
acculturation into the United
States over three generations.
The books are autobiographical
to an extent, drawing from his
experience of coming to the
United States and becoming a pro
fessor, Leal said.
Islas was invited three times by
the graduating seniors to the
Class Day ceremony during com
mencement, and he received the
Lloyd W. Dinkelspiel award for


Arturo Islas
outstanding service to undergrad
uate education in 1976.
Islas received his doctorate in
English at Stanford in 1971,
becoming the first Chicano in the
country to do so, Packer said. He
was asked to join the faculty and
received tenure in 1976.

He also received a bachelor's
degree at Stanford in 1960 and a
master's degree in 1963, both in
education. Islas was born May 24,
1938 in El Paso.
The English Department plans
to establish a memorial scholar
ship in Islas' name for creative
writing, Packer said.
The Islas family will hold pri
vate services. A campus memorial
service is tentatively scheduled for
March 7.
