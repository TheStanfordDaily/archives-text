The Streak.
Stanford's women's tennis
team is no longer perfect in 1991.
Debbie Graham is no longer per
fect in dual matches. The Cardi
nal, however, is still undefeated
since Tax Day in 1988 after
defeating San Diego State and
California over the weekend.

Cardinal 8, Aztecs 1
Cardinal 8, Golden Bears 1

Stanford's 71st consecutive vic
tory gives the team a season
record of 6-0, 1-0 in Pacific 10
Conference play.
A pair of routine 8-1 victories
over the Aztecs and Golden Bears
is hardly newsworthy in and of
itself. Were it not for the return of
Graham, and her first defeat after
55 straight dual-match wins, it
would have been just another typ
ical couple of routs.
Instead the junior superstar
added some spice. She returned
after a long absence Friday to lead
Stanford as the team steamrolled
San Diego State. Graham bested
Eva Olivarez 6-2, 7-6, one of five
straight-set singles wins for the
Cardinal.
The only blemish came at third
doubles where Carina Rolley and
Kylie Johnson were beaten. That
loss was the Stanford's first of any
kind in '91, ending a string of four

consecutive shutouts.
After Friday's appetizer, Cal
provided the main course Satur
day. Senior Sandra Birch paced an
easy team win with a 40-minute
blowout of Lisa Albano 6-0, 6-1.
Albano has some sort of mental
block about playing Birch and it
appeared to be in force. "Sandra
did a great job at No. 1," Stanford
coach Frank Brennan said. "At no
point did Albano make any move
to win the match."
Graham was dropped by Emilie
Viqueira, the nation's No. 5
player, by a 7-6, 6-3 tally. "It
wasn't because she outplayed
me," Graham said. "It was com
pletely mental ... all my fault
from game one. I wasn't focused. I
wasn't thinking about tennis at
all."
Which against Viqueira can
mean trouble. Still, Graham was
disappointed. "There's no way I
should lose to her. I just beat her
oh and oh a month ago."
Said Brennan: "Debbie's been
out of matches for a while,"
explaining why she struggled. In
the long run it might help. I think
she's capable of putting a lot more
matches together again .. .
maybe in a more meaningful set
ting."
In other words, higher in the
lineup and in tournaments as
well. Graham's streak was largely
compiled at third and fourth sin
gles.
For her own part, Graham said
she wasn't relieved that the pres
sure is now off. "I was really dis
appointed that it had to end how it
did. I beat myself."


Tracy Allen â€” Dally
Debbie Graham recorded an easy win at No. 1 singles Friday to
lead the Cardinal past San Diego State. The following day, however,
at California, Graham lost at No. 2. It was the first time in her
two-plus-year Stanford career that the Fountain, Valley, Calif., native
lost a singles match in a dual meet.
