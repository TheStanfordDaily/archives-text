The division title hopes of
the Cardinal men's volleyball
team were effectively dashed
last weekend as they dropped
all three matches of their
Southern California road trip.
Stanford, ranked eighth,
saw its once unblemished West
ern Intercollegiate Volleyball
Association record drop to a
mediocre 4-4. Their current
four-game losing streak leaves
thoir overall mark at 5-5.

Cardinal falls to 49ers
Gauchos and Trojans

The Cardinal fell in a heart
stopping five-game match (16-
14, 15-10, 14-16, 14-16, 15-12)
Friday night at second-ranked
Long Beach State. From that
point things only got worse, as
Stanford fell in three straight
games to both UC-Santa Bar
bara (15-9, 15-6, 15-9) Satur
day, and USC (15-5, 15-6, 15-
10) Monday.
Once 4-0 and atop the
WIVA's Harry Wilson, Stan
ford is now tied for third place
with fifth-ranked San Diego
State (2-2), far behind co-lead
ers Long Beach and USC, who
are both unbeaten at 6-0. The
league's 18-game schedule
gives the Cardinal a glimmer of
divisional-title hope, but given
the level of the co-leaders' play
and the fact that they each
have one win over Stanford,
just qualifying for postseason
play seems a more reasonable
goal.
The WIVA postseason tour
nament, from which two teams
advance to the NCAA Final
Four, hosts eight league teams.
The top three clubs in each of
the two divisions plus two wild
cards advance.
The outcome of the road trip

may have been foreshadowed
in its very earliest moments, as
at the outset of the first game
at Long Beach, Jimmy Klein
went down with a knee injury..
Ironically, Klein had just
worked his way into the lineup
after seeing limited action at
best all season. The injury was
diagnosed as torn anterior era-;
ciate ligament which will likely
end not only the two-sport
star's 1991 volleyball season,
but his football season as well.
Without Klein the Cardinal"
still managed to claim a com-,
manding 7-0 first game lead,*
but saw it immediately with--
ered away by a 7-1 Long Beach
run. The 49ers went on to
claim the first game and then
rattled off five straight points
to break a 10-10 tie and win in
the second.
The third game provided,
most of the night's drama as
Stanford staved off five match
points, an 11-14 deficit, and a
thunderous partisan crowd to'
keep the match alive. Again in
the fourth game the Cardinal
fought off a match point, and
they seemed to have captured
momentum with another emo
tional game victory. But in the
rally-scored fifth game, the
relentless hitting of the 49ers'
Brent Hilliard and the blocking
of first team All-American
Brett Winslow did Stanford in.
The exhausting three-hour
marathon match took its toll
on the Cardinal, as 24 hours
later, in what coach Ruben
Nieves called "a must-win situ
ation," they fell quietly to the
less potent, ninth-ranked Gau
chos.
Monday night the defending
national champion USC Tro
jans showed the disheartened
Cardinal why they own the
nation's number one ranking
when they pounded Stanford
in straight games. USC
improved NCAA volleyball's
only unbeaten record to 10-0.
