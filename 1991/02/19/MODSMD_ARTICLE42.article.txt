# Netters reach doubles final
## 
### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
The beautiful weather did
not mask Stanford's disappoint
ment at its singles play in the
Hobee's NorCal tennis tourna
ment, but its end-of-the-day
doubles performance Sunday
did take some of the sting away.
Stanford did not place any
one in today's all-California sin
gles finals, and had only one
player qualify for yesterday's
individual semifinals of the
four-day, 13-team tournament,
but swept doubles semifinal
play. Dan Turbow and Jared
Palmer will face off against
teammates Alex O'Brien and
Jason Yee this afternoon for the
NorCal double title.
"In my mind there was no
question that they were the best
two teams in the tournament,
but sometimes you play down to
the level of your opponent,"
coach Dick Gould said. "That
didn't happen and I expect a
very good doubles final."
O'Brien and Yee, the top
seeded doubles team in the tour

nament, dominated Cal's Dan
Hiddleson and Tom Phanco in
the semis.
Doubles specialist Turbow
and Palmer, the tournament's
second seed, didn't have it quite
so easy against Cal's Carl Chang
and Anders Rolfson, although
the outcome was never really in
question. The male collegiate
version of Monica Seles and
tournament partner Rolfson did
give Turbow and Palmer a little
trouble along with a lot of
grunting — especially when
Chang's serve was on (which
wasn't too often), but the Cardi
nal's array of shots was just too
much for the pair from across
the Bay. They went down 6-3, 6-
2 to seal an all-Cardinal final.
Chang will play teammate
Pete Fitzpatrick, who downed
teammate Phanco 6-3, 6-1 in
the semis, for the singles title.
Robert Devens was the
exception during the otherwise
sub-par singles play for the Car
dinal. Due to injuries and Cal's
top seeds bowing out of the
tourney, Stanford's top three
players did not compete in sin

gles competition, leaving room
for the Cardinal's freshmen to
gain collegiate match experi
ence. Devens didn't let the
opportunity pass him by.
Stanford's No. 9 singles
player surprised his opponents
as well as the tournament fans
by making it to the semifinals,
the only Cardinal to do so. By
beating Cal's Ed Marcum 6-4, 6-
4 in the quarters Sunday morn
ing, Devens became the only
Stanford player to survive the
round of 16.
As for the rest of the squad,
Gould chalked it up to early-sea
son match experience, and a
chance to see what everyone
needs to work on before it comes
time to defend those NCAA
titles once again.
Card notes
Due to the fact that the singles
finals are an all-California affaif;
they will be held in Berkeley at the
competitors' convenience. The Tur
bow-Palmer vs. O'Brien-Yee doubles
finals will be held today at 2:30 p.m.
at the Stanford Tennis Stadium.
There will be no admission charge.
