# Cardinal swims past Bears
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
BERKELEY, Calif. - After an
exciting victory at then-No. 1
Texas last week, the Cardinal
women's swim team was looking
for a bit of a breather this week.
Despite the fact that the team was
competing at third-ranked Cali
fornia, the meet was expected to
be a fairly one-sided affair for the
now-top-ranked Cardinal.
But it didn't end up that way.
With three people not making
the trip due to illness and two oth
ers not competing do to injury, the
Cardinal had a problem. Even
worse was the fact that almost
every swimmer who did make the
trip was sick as well.
But when his team fell behind
43-30 after four events, coach
Richard Quick reshuffled his
Stanford lineup and the Cardinal
posted a 175-142 win over the
Golden Bears at Spieker Pool.
"I was real impressed with our
team effort," Quick said after the
meet. "We have a lot of people
who, because of their health,
didn't want to swim, or didn't
want to swim as many events, or

didn't want to swim as hard as
they had to. I thought they really
reached down and got it. I'm
really proud of them... . There
was a large number of our swim
mers who, if they were the only
one feeling the way they did, I
wouldn't have had them swim."
Stanford started by winnihg
the 200-yard medley relay behind
the swimming of Janel Jorgensen,
Lori Heisick, Summer Sanders
and Suzy Buckovich. The Bears
went one-three-four in the 1000
freestyle, but Janet Evans coun
tered by winning the 400 individ
ual medley.
But Sarah Anderson, who had
won the 1000 only minutes ear
lier, came back to win the 200
freestyle for Cal and Trina Radke
and Lisa Summers placed second
and fourth for the hosts. Then
panic ensued.
Quick changed his plans of
resting the sickest of his swim
mers, added extra events for both

Heisick and Evans, among others.
Jody Smith and Anne Mahoney
went one-two in the 100 back
stroke. Heisick, Susan Johnson
and Laurie Gandrud swept the
100 breaststroke. Sanders and
Jorgensen dominated the 200 but
terfly. And, just like that, Stanford
was ahead for good at 72-57.
Buckovich grabbed a second in
the 50 freestyle, Eileen Richetelli
dominated the one-meter diving
and Jorgensen and Michelle
Griglione went one-two in the 100
freestyle to extend the lead.
Minutes after taking third in
the 200 backstroke, a very sick
Evans beat Anderson in the 500
freestyle with teammates Kather
ine Comanor, Sionainn Marcoux
and Barb Metz taking third
through fifth. Then, with Jor
gensen, the defending NCAA
champ, watching from the stands,
Buckovich, Sanders and Pam
Minthorn took first, second and
fourth in the 100 butterfly.
Richetelli and Kristin Jensen
grabbed first and third in the
three-meter diving and Jor
gensen, Griglione and Gandrud
went one-two-four in the 200 IM
to ice the win.
