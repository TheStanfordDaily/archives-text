# Track races in Reno

### Gretchen Atwood Staff writer 
Saturday the Stanford track
team sent 13 athletes to the
first annual Reno indoor meet,
but winning wasn't on their
minds.
"I was trying to qualify (for
the NCAA indoor champi
onships), win or lose," said long
jumper Marcus Hickerson.
Although he won he described
his performance as poor. "I
fouled several jumps," said
Hickerson, "That was the frus
trating part. I felt good but
couldn't get my run-up right."
Hickerson was one of four
Cardinal athletes to place first.
"We did very well as a team. It
wasn't a highly competitive
meet," said asst. coach Scott
Chisam.
Chryste Gaines easily won
the 55 meters and Rhonda
Oliver ran a NCAA provisional
qualifying time of 24.87 while
winning the 200 meters. Fresh
man Dana Weeks won the
triple jump with a leap of 37-
feet, 2-inches.
"Chryste and Rhonda won
their events easily. If pushed
they would have run faster,"

Chisam said.
Oliver was somewhat
pleased with her race. "It's not
where I want to be," Oliver
said. "I want to eventually
make NCAAs, indoor and out
door, but I have to take it one
step at a time."
Several other team mem
bers placed well in Reno. Jackie
Edwards was runner up in the
long jump and Peggy Odita
placed second in the high jump.
Jamie Merek came up with
his best pole vault since he has
been at Stanford. His 16-feet,
1-inch vault was good for fifth
place. Chris Ray finished
fourth in the 800 meters. Also
placing fourth were David
Calomese in the long jump and
Glyn Milburn in the 55 meters.
This Saturday the Cardinal
head to Berkeley for the Bay
Area Invitational. The team
expects the tough competition
to push them harder than they
were pushed at Reno. Hicker
son hopes to improve his com
petition performance this
weekend.
"My training has been going
better than the meets. It's dis
appointing," Hickerson said.
