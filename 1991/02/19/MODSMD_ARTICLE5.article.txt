# Expanded weight room faces uncertain future
## Old gym may be replaced 
### Dylan Tyson Editorial staff 
The building of the new Ford Center has enabled
the expansion of the weight room at Encina Gym,
but officials say the old building may have to be torn
down and replaced within the next few years.
The size of the weight room was effectively tripled
last month, when it took over space previously occu
pied by a gymnastics area.
A new gymnastics area was built in the Ford Cen
ter, a project which included reclaiming Burnham
Pavilion — which had been turned into offices — and
building new sports buildings.
Weight room manager and head wrestling coach
Chris Horpel said Stanford has needed the extra
space for the weight room for "a long, long time."
But even with the added space Horpel isn't sure
people are happier. "It's kind of a mixed blessing —
for every positive comment there have been just as
many negative comments," he said.
"With each improvement I've made, the more
complaining I've heard," said Horpel.
One lifter said, "It's totally cool. Now we have
some room to spread out." But one student taking
the class Weight Training for Women thought the
room was a little big for the amount of equipment it
has.
The weight room will soon be getting more floor
ing and mirrors soon.
The Centennial fund-raising campaign made the
Ford Center possible. The Department of Athletics
cited the project as its key need and set a $15 million
target. Only $10 million was raised, so a scaled-back
version was constructed, said Ben Asaro, manager of
special projects.
However, the University will have to find even
more money in the next few years. Encina gym was
built under the lenient seismic codes of the 1920s

and needs to be either reinforced or replaced, said
acting Athletic Director Alan Cummings.
"The building is a target building; mtyor work
needs to be done," Asaro said. "The structural engi
neers found it amazing how well it responded to the
Loma Prieta earthquake."
Instead of doing several millions of dollars of

work and ending up with an outdated structure,
however, the possibility of replacing the gym is being
considered, Cummings said.
The building will be around for two more years
before the decision is made, Horpel said. The "think
ing right now is bulldoze but we would need a tempo
rary facility."
