## Iraq considering Soviet peace plan 
### 
DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) - Allied
battle preparations intensified today amid
growing signs coalition forces are poised for an
all-out assault. But a Soviet peace plan is said
to hold out the promise that Saddam Hussein
can stay in power if he pulls his armies out of
Kuwait now.
The diplomatic bid brought no pause in the
allied air assault. Baghdad came under

repeated bombardment during the night, the heavi
est onslaught in several days, AP correspondent
John Rice reported from the Iraqi capital.
Black clouds of smoke drifted over the city, and
streaks of red-and-white anti-aircraft fire illumi
nated the night sky, he said. There was no immedi
ate word on what was hit and whether there were
casualties.
Baghdad's state-run newspapers carried no
reports today on the peace plan Mikhail Gorbachev
offered to Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz yester
day.
But Soviet Middle East envoy Yevgeny Primakov,
who was present at the Aziz-Gorbachev meeting,
called on the allies to hold off on any ground offen
sive until the plan has gotten a full airing.
"If we start a . . . land operation, without replying
to the Gorbachev plan, and without knowing what
the reaction has been of Iraq to this, then we would
be assuming a great responsibility in history," he
said from Moscow on ABC's "Nightline."
Iran's official news agency said Aziz would meet
with Iranian President Hashemi Rafsai\jani today
before returning to Baghdad.
On his way from Baghdad to Moscow, Aziz trav
eled by land to Iran because the allies said his safety
could not be guaranteed if he flew in the war zone.
Vitaly Ignatenko, Gorbachev's spokesman,
refused to divulge details about the plan, but said it
was "fully in line with the Soviet position that there
should be an unconditional withdrawal from
Kuwait."
The German newspaper Bild said the Soviet plan
calls for an unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait,
coupled with a guarantee that no "punitive actions"
would be taken against the Iraqi government.
President Bush and his top war advisers met for
more than two hours on the proposal yesterday, but
Fitzwater would not disclose the administration's
view of it:"It doesn't require any response from us.
. . . This is between the Soviets and Iraq."
The respected French newspaper Le Monde,
quoting French sources, said Iraq was being told it
must accept the Soviet peace plan within 36 hours or
ground combat would begin.
The month-old war has already been costly. A
senior Iraqi official was quoted by an Iranian news
paper today as saying more than 20,000 Iraqis were
killed and 60,000 wounded in the war's first four
weeks.
Iraq's deputy prime minister, Saadoun Hammadi,
reported those figures to Iranian officials in talks
last week, the Jomhuri Islami newspaper said. It did
not provide a breakdown of civilian and military
deaths.
