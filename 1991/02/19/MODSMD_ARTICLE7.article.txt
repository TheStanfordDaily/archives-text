MONTEREY — The Daily has been named the
state's best student newspaper at a four-year univer
sity for 1990.
The award, given by the California Newspaper
Publishers Association, was presented Saturday at
the organization's 103 rd annual convention here. In
addition to categories for four-year and two-year col
lege papers, nearly 400 professional weekly and daily
newspapers were judged in up to 26 news and adver
tising categories.
Participants in the collegiate
categories entered newspapers
from three consecutive publica
tion days between September
1989 and August 1990. The
Daily's entry included its coverage
of Soviet President Mikhail Gor
bachev's visit to Stanford.

"I thought [the award] was a
fine tribute to a hard-working
staff last spring," said senior John
Wagner, who was editor in chief
during the time for which the
award was given. "It's nice to have
people from the outside say you
are doing things well."
This was the first year The
Daily entered the contest.
The Daily Nexus, the student
newspaper at UC-Santa Barbara,
took second place.
