If either of these
makes your pulse race,
talk to us.
Having to get a real job
isn't so bad.
Not when there's a place where the
people get as pumped up about technol
ogy as you do.
A place where you work on real stuff
and produce tomorrow's
products.
We're involved in electronic design
automation, automatic test equipment,
telecommunications test, and custom
connections. All four of our businesses
right away. And red tape and bureaucracy are market leaders.
Our work environment is, well, colic
are kept away.
Of course, there is a catch. We only want giate. And among other great benefits,
software and hardware professionals who like we offer an educational assistance plan
to be on the leading edge of high technology. with 100% reimbursement—up front.
That's because our business is help
ing other high tech companies develop
So talk to us. Or settle for a job that
ma> turn out to be just work.
