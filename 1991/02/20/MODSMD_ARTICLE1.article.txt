# WAR IN THE GULF
## Soviets urge allies to delay ground war 
### 
D HAH RAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) — Marine
gunners hammered away at Iraqi defense lines
yesterday, and allied ships swept Gulf waters
for Iraqi mines as the desperate days of diplo
macy dwindled down toward an all-out assault
on Kuwait.
Moscow gave Iraq another day or two to
accept a secret Soviet peace plan, a plan Presi
dent Bush was already describing as "well
short" of U.S. requirements.
A Soviet mediator urged the Desert Storm
allies to delay the long-expected ground war, or
risk bearing "a great responsibility in history."
An Iranian mediator said he was sure Iraq's
bottom line would be simple: an Iraqi pullout
from Kuwait in exchange for a U.S. pullout
from Saudi Arabia.
Iraqi Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz returned
home to his bomb-battered capital yes
terday from Moscow and Tehran, car
rying the Soviet proposal for peace.
Because of the air war, he could not fly,
instead traveling over land from Iran.
Terms of the plan, presented to Aziz
on Monday by Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev, were not made
public. But it was widely believed to
link an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait
to guarantees that President Saddam
Hussein's government could remain in
power in Iraq.
After consulting with Saddam, Aziz
is expected to return to Moscow today
with the Iraqi response, Soviet U.N.
ambassador Yuli Vorontsov said in
New York.
Gorbachev's special Mideast envoy,

Yevgeny Primakov, urged the allies to
hold off on any ground offensive. "If
we start a .. . land operation, without
replying to the Gorbachev plan, and
without knowing what the reaction
has been of Iraq to this, then we would
be assuming a great responsibility in
history," he said.
In Washington, Bush told reporters
he had spoken with Gorbachev "very
candidly . . . and I've been frank with
him on this. ... It falls well short of
what would be required."
New evidence of the war's human
cost emerged. A senior Baghdad offi
cial told the Iranians more than 20,000
Iraqis have been killed, a Tehran news
paper reported.
Up on the firing line, from Marines
afloat in the Persian Gulf to U.S.
armored cavalrymen on alert in the

Saudi desert, all appeared poised for a
final offensive to push the Iraqis from
occupied Kuwait.
Intensified skirmishes were
reported yesterday along the border
with Kuwait.
U.S. Army forces captured an aban
doned Iraqi observation post on the
high ground that could have alerted
rear divisions to an allied attack into
Kuwait, according to a pool report.
"It appears as though they have
given up (that section of) the border,"
said Karl Horst, a battalion oper
ations officer. "We were expecting to
fight to cross it. It makes it easy (or us
when we roll across. It's one less fight
we have to do."
Marines directed artillery fire yes
terday at Iraqi bunkers and troop con
centrations across the border, south of

AJ Wafra oilfield, an earlier pool report
said. At least seven secondary explo
sions were reported, indicating a hit on
ammunition or fuel stores.
Lt. Gen. Calvin Waller, commander
of all Army forces in Operation Desert
Storm, said on a visit to the front that
the Soviet peace proposal had "abso
lutely not" affected allied war plan
ning.
The man in overall charge of sup
plying the troops, Lt. Gen. Gus Pago
nis, said, "We're totally prepared to do
whatever is necessary. We're ready to
S°"
Last-minute "battlefield prepara
tion" continued, including off Kuwait,
where exploding Iraqi mines on Mon
day blew a hole in a huge Marine
assault ship and disabled a U.S. missile
cruiser.
