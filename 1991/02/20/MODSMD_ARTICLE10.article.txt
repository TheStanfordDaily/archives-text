# Fraternity donates money, banner to Israeli consulate
## 
### Connie Chang Editorial staff 
The Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity last
week donated to the Israeli Consulate in
San Francisco about $300 and a banner
offering the people of Israel the Stanford
community's hopes and prayers.
The seven-foot banner had been dis
played in White Plaza for people to sign
and was formally presented with several
hundred signatures in a ceremony held
at the consulate Friday.
Fraternity members said the dona
tions were collected from students and
faculty members.
Joseph Dobrin, who helped found the
fraternity's Stanford chapter in 1987,
developed the idea for the banner and
monetary donations. Dobrin, a senior,
spent five months at Tel Aviv University
in Israel last year.
Dobrin said fraternity members were
receptive about showing support
because they were concerned with the
events in Israel — particularly the Scud
missile attacks — and wanted to "help
out in our small way."
Senior Brian Fagel, who designed the
banner, said the fraternity was very care
ful in wording it so no one would be
opposed to signing it. The banner read,
"The students at Stanford send hopes
and prayers to the people of Israel."
Leah Stist, public affairs officer at the
Israeli Consulate, said the consulate was
delighted to receive the banner and the
donations.

The consulate is displaying the ban
ner in its front lobby, and the money has
been deposited in a war relief fund that
goes directly toward repairing damage
caused by Scud missiles.
Stist said this donation and others the
consulate has received are "self-moti
vated from people supporting the only
democratic country in the Middle East."
Dobrin said he wai surprised at how
much the consulate appreciated the fra
ternity's donation.
He said he thinks consulate officials
were encouraged to see college students
being active in their support for Israel
and donating money.
In a speech Dobrin gave at the cere
mony, he said, "It may be easier as a stu
dent to just wake up every morning,
casually glance at the paper and head oft
to class without stopping to do anything,
but that is precisely what those that
want the destruction of Israel want. As a
Jewish fraternity, we decided to do some
thing small but concrete."
Dobrin said he would like to continue
to raise money because support for
Israel, politically and economically, is an
"ongoing process."
Hillel, a Jewish student organization,
has been collecting donations since the
war started. The organization has col
lected $3,000 in donations to date, which
will go to Israel's Red Cross.
Hillel Rabbi Ari Cartun said he is glad
the fraternity made the banner because
"it gave the campus a chance to show
support for Israel."
