Israel requests U.S. loan to
resettle Soviet immigrants
JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel hopes to bor
row $1 billion, using the credit lines of Jewish
groups in the United States and Canada, to
help absorb thousands of Soviet immigrants,
the quasi-governmental Jewiwh Agency
announced Monday.
Board chairman Mendel Kaplan told a news
conference his agency would ask North Ameri
can chapters of the Council of Jewish Federa
tions to guarantee the loan.
The money will be loaned out to Soviet
immigrants at favorable interest rates, he said.
Kaplan said the idea was "to make the max
imum amount of funds available" to resettle
up to 1 million Soviets over coming years.
Gulf war sparks energy debate
WASHINGTON (AP) - With America's
reliance on foreign oil painfully underscored by
the Persian Gulf War, Congress and the
administration are both eager for a new ener
gy strategy. But they are at severe odds over
whether it should stress conservation or
increased domestic production.
President Bush is expected to unveil on
Wednesday a long-term energy blueprint that
comes down heavily on the production side.
But a half dozen lawmakers already have
introduced bills so varied that no compromise
will come easily.
The arguments range from much stiffer
auto fuel economy standards, to drilling for oil
in environmentally sensitive areas, to a rebirth
of the nuclear power industry. "There will be a
battle royal over energy policy," predicted Sen.
Albert Gore, D-Tenn.
Gore has been highly critical of the Bush
administration's refusal to support stronger
measures to reduce energy consumption. He is
among a number of lawmakers who have
offered bills aimed at forcing Americans to use
less energy, especially oil.
Peace talks to begin in Colombia
BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — The govern
ment and rebels agreed Monday to begin peace
talks following two months of guerrilla vio
lence that has claimed about 350 lives.
Government Minister Humberto de la Calle
told reporters that a rebel statement Monday
eliminated all obstacles to negotiations. Sever
al smaller rebel groups already have agreed to
a cease-fire and are participating in a confer
ence drafting a new constitution.
In fighting since late Sunday, six govern
ment troops and three rebels were killed,
according to an army report. Leftist guerrillas
also blew up three electrical towers and set fire
to a small plane at an airport in northern
Colombia.
