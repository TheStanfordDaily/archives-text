# Gorbachev resignation demanded by Yeltsin
## 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) â€” Boris Yeltsin made an
unprecedented televised appeal yesterday
for the resignation of Mikhail Gorbachev,
accusing the Soviet president of sacrificing
reforms in a drive for personal power.
Yeltsin has been a strident and frequent
critic of Gorbachev, but never before called
for him to step down. The attack seemed
certain to exacerbate the enmity between
the two men and to heighten the Soviet
political crisis.
"I warned in 1987 that Gorbachev has in
his character a tendency to absolute per
sonal power," Yeltsin said. "He has done all
that and has led the country to a dictator
ship, giving it a pretty name: presidential
rule."
As president of Russia, the largest Soviet
republic, Yeltsin enjoys immense personal
popularity but has had difficulty parlaying
that into the kind of political power Gor
bachev wields. Gorbachev has run the
Soviet Union for nearly six years but has
been widely criticized for the failing econ
omy and the increasing disorder in society.
In the broadcast, Yeltsin said his biggest
mistake since becoming president of the
Russian Federation parliament last May
was placing too much trust in Gorbachev's
promises of economic and political reform.
The heart of Yeltsin's argument was that
power should be shifted from the central
government, led by Gorbachev, to the 15
Soviet republics.
"I distance myself from the position and
policies of the (Soviet) president; I am in

favor of his immediate resignation, with the
power being transferred to a collective
organ, the Federation Council of the repub
lic(s)," he said.
The Federation Council, consisting of
the Soviet president, vice president and
heads of the republics, was created at Gor
bachev's initiative.
Reformers' fears of a shift toward a
harder line were heightened in December
by the resignation of Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze, who warned of a
coming "dictatorship."
Shevardnadze attributed Gorbachev's
shift away from reform to pressure from
the military and the Communist Old
Guard, but Yeltsin laid the blame squarely
on Gorbachev.
The centrally controlled media, particu
larly the state broadcast monopoly, have
criticized Yeltsin relentlessly in the past
month, because of his denunciation of Gor
bachev's crackdown in the Baltic republics.
A former member of Gorbachev's Polit
buro, Yeltsin was ousted from the ruling
body in 1987 and has feuded with Gor
bachev since over the pace of reform.
Yeltsin, 60, has quit the Communist
Party and recently has been under attack
by hard-liners. His aides say opponents
have collected enough signatures in the
Russian parliament to call for a special ses
sion at which they are expected to press for
a vote of no-confidence.
