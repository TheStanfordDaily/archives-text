## Thinking of drinking 
### 
The interfraternity
Council deserves high praise
for its recent proposal for an
alcohol awareness program during
Freshman Orientation Week.
During their first week at Stan
ford, incoming students already
hear about responsible drinking
from many different sources: the
university administration, Resi
dential Education and Project
R 2 ISC. A program conducted by
fraternity and sorority members
would be a good complement to
these efforts because it would lend
more credibility to the doctrine of
responsible drinking.
Since Greek organizations have
a reputation for throwing parties
where alcohol is served, their mes
sage may be more believable and

thus more effective than the
efforts of resident assistants.
The program will also benefit
the Greek community by showing
students early on that fraternities
and sororities have standards of
responsible drinking. This message
will hopefully shatter some stereo
types that incoming students may
have of such organizations.
Many students come to Stanford
with very little prior experience
with alcohol. The IFC's proposed
program would increase alcohol
awareness significantly and thus
take a big step toward decreasing
the number of alcohol-related
problems on campus.
The University should work
with the Greek groups to develop
this program to its fullest.
