# Changing the bylaws
## 
### 
The bylaws for the
ASSU spring elections have
been changed, and almost all
of the changes are for the better.
The laudable changes in the
election bylaws work to increase
the efficiency of the ASSU elec
tions. These changes include limit
ing the number of fliers a candi
date can use, and cutting campaign
expense limits by 20 percent. Such
changes will reduce the wasteful
ness usually associated with ASSU
elections and, therefore, are in the
community's, as well as the candi
dates', best interests.
Another positive change for the
upcoming ASSU elections is a
streamlining of the computer pro
cess which tallies the votes.
Finally, the new election com
missioner should be commended
for his enthusiasm and refresh
ingly light-hearted approach to the
elections.
However, some of the other
changes facing the ASSU elections
are not as welcomed.

Currently, the election bylaws
prohibit campaigning before Apr.
10 — a week before the elections
are held. Under the new interpre
tation, restrictions would extend to
any premature announcements in
student publications about a candi
date's intention to run.
It is unfair to hold a candidate
responsible for what is published
by the press. Similarly, it is inap
propriate to place such restrictions
on student publications.
Although the identities of the
potential candidates are not partic
ularly newsworthy, the suggested
restrictions might artificially ele
vate the importance of the candi
dates' identities before the cam
paigning starts.
Moreover, if the candidate is the
one who is going to be punished in
case of a press leak, it is possible
that a publication with political
affiliations could intentionally sab
otage a campaign by printing the
name of the opposition's candi
dates.
