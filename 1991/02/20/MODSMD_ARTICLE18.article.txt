## A 						definite 'I don't know' 
### 
LIFE WAS MUCH SIMPLER WHEN
I knew how to feel about every
thing. For most of my life, I lived in
a black-and-white world, and I liked it.
"Good" and "Bad" were easily distin
guishable alternatives, roughly equiva
lent to Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader.
I knew what was right and did all that I
could to promote it; no one could ever
accuse me of failing to take a stand on an
issue that mattered to me.
But then a war came along, and every
thing went gray.
When President Bush came on televi
sion on Jan. 16 to tell us that the bombing
had started, I wanted to hate him. I
wanted to scream, to tell him that he was
killing men and women and children, and
making people I'd never met want to kill
me, and draining precious resources from
the people who really needed them.
But I couldn't.
I wanted to be outraged, but I couldn't
ignore the gnawing, persuasive feeling
that the war was at least partially right.
Since Aug. 2, I'd been reading every
thing I could find about the conflict, talk
ing to friends about it, weighing the
moral and practical justifications for and
objections to an American invasion.
And when my five months of critical
analysis finally came to a head, when
Bush's stern but strangely serene face
told me that the possibility of war had
become a reality, I didn't know what to
think. I was completely ambivalent.
The feeling was frustrating. For the
first time in my life, I was unable to take
a stand on a serious issue, to form an
opinion and then do something about it. I

had strong opinions about many individ
ual elements of the war, but taken
together they added up to nothing, gave
me no mandate for action. All I could do
was sit back and watch.
And watching made me feel apathetic.
It seemed to me that the people who
really cared about the war were actually
doing something about it, protesting or
fighting or writing letters or arguing with
their friends, not sitting at home, para
lyzed by ambivalence.
The marching of Stanford students
from White Plaza to the Oval gave me
chills, as did footage of American soldiers
marching in Saudi Arabia, and for the
same reason: The two groups may have
disagreed, but both were standing up for
what they believed, and I admired and
envied them.
I kept reading the newspaper and
watching the news, hoping that some
thing would make it all clear for me and
somehow allow me to embrace or reject
the war. But the more I read and saw, the
more confused I became.
One day I might be moved by letters in
The New York Times from Kuwaiti citi
zens describing their treatment by the
Iraqis; the next, I'd be repelled by images
of the new triumvirs, Cheney, Powell and
Schwarzkopf, moving plastic planes
around on a map and laughing like chil
dren playing with toys.
The flood of details unleashed upon me
by the media day after day contained no
underlying sense of right or wrong that I
could latch on to. The press needed to
remain "objective," and the best
informed subjective sources, the Ameri

can and Iraqi governments, censored and
altered the "news" beyond recognition.
After a while, I began to feel as if my
intellect had failed; I'd been given a set of
information and told to come up with a
decent thesis statement, and had instead
spit out a contradictory, incomprehensi
ble mess.
The morality of war was exactly the
kind of problem my classes had tried to
teach to me to solve, and I seemed to have
retained nothing.
It was only recently that I began to
realize that the war is pretty incompre
hensible itself.
The world, sadly enough, isn't a black
and-white place; the morality of some
thing as overwhelming and all-encom
passing as war can't help being contradic
tory. And having ambivalent feelings
doesn't make me stupid or apathetic. It
makes me human.
I still hold out hope that I'll eventually
be able to take a stand on the Gulf war
and do something about it. All I can do for
now is continue what I've been doing:
reading, debating and listening, so that
my ambivalence doesn't turn into indif
ference.
And however passive and ineffective it
sounds, I have to hope for peace.
