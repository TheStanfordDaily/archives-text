## Stanford failing in its handling of German studies 
### 
Following the article in
the Jan. 29 Daily concerning our
"meeting" with Dean Thomas
Wasow, many Stanford students have
asked, "What the hell is going on in the
German Studies Department?"
On Jan. 25, a group of 19 graduate
students from the German Studies
Department — essentially the entire
graduate student body — walked into
the dean's office and handed in leave-of
absence petitions for next fall quarter.
We were driven to take this step as a
protest against the administration's
resistance to our repeated demands for a
remedy to what has become an intolera
ble situation.
Two of our most popular professors,
David Wellbery and Russell Berman,
have accepted tenure-track positions at
other institutions this year. One of them
may come back next year, though he has
not yet reached a decision.
Of the remaining six professors on
our faculty, one is a linguist, another
runs the language program, a third is
occupied by his duties as assistant dean
of humanities and a fourth is on sabbati
cal.
This leaves the students studying

German literature with virtually no one
to work with; the department does not
even have the requisite number of litera
ture professors for a Ph.D. oral exam.
Moreover, both Wellbery and Berman
had already taken year-long leave of
absences before their departure. Given
that an overwhelming msgority of Ger
man graduate students came to Stanford
to study with Wellbery or Berman, many
have now been without dissertation advi
sors for two years and, due to adminis
trative foot-dragging, this situation
threatens to extend for a far longer
period.
As much as we appreciate the efforts
of our visiting faculty, they cannot
replace tenured faculty as Ph.D. advi
sors.
The departure of Wellbery and
Berman has significantly affected the
national reputation of our department.
An immediate consequence of this loss
has been a 60 percent drop in applica
tions to our graduate program. Under
graduate course offerings have also been
hurt.
Because these now-absent professors
had been active in other departments as

well, the adverse effects of their depar
ture have certainly not been limited to
the German Studies Department; gradu
ate students in many other departments
have voiced their concern as to the grav
ity of the situation.
Stanford University is known for its
diversity and this, we feel, is being sacri
ficed on the altar of new austerity.
A search to replace one or both of
these professors should have begun this
year, and the department as a whole has
repeatedly urged the administration to
take action. It has now become impossi
ble to begin a search for senior faculty
due primarily to administrative delays.
Furthermore, we have long sought to
upgrade a junior faculty position to
tenure track status, which has thus far
met with no response from the adminis
tration.
Among several compromise proposals,
we have suggested that a current visiting
faculty appointment be extended another
year so as to offer some continuity in
advising and examining. This was
rejected due to "budgetary constraints."
While we acknowledge the seriousness
of the University's present financial con

dition, we would like to point out that
the University has already saved tremen
dously through the absence of Berman
and Wellbery; visiting professors receive
only a fraction of their salary.
At this point we are not asking the
University for additional faculty, we sim
ply wish to replace the ones we have lost.
Clearly the future of the German
Studies Department is in danger, and we
call upon the administration to respond
constructively to the issues we have
raised. The dean's suggestion simply to
replace graduate student teachers, who
find themselves forced to leave, with
"Bay Area people" (The Daily, Jan. 21) is
insulting and obviously not a credible
solution to these problems.
Stanford's commitment to quality and
diversity in both undergraduate and
graduate education is at stake here.
We hope that our present desperate
situation does not reflect the administra
tion's new interpretation of this commit
ment — if it does, the University
humanities community must take good
heed.
