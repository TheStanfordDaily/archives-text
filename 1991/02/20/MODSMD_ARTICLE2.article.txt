# SLAC requests $168 million grant
## Proposed accelerator could solve questions on matter's existence 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
Caught in a storm of federal budget
cuts, layoffs and a collider that has not
lived up to expectations, the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center is asking
the government to blow some of the
dark clouds away — with a $168 mil
lion grant.
SLAC director Burton Richter is
spearheading the grant proposal to
build a new atom smasher that would
answer a fundamental question of
physicists, "How can anything exist?"
The new facility would incorporate
some existing laboratory structures
and would eventually overshadow the
current Stanford Linear Collider.
"We want to figure out why we are
here," Richter said. "Why is our world
the way it is?" Specifically, the new
accelerator would be used to determine
why matter has not been wiped out by
antimatter, he added.
Richter, who announced the pro
posal Friday at a Washington, D.C.
meeting of the American Association
for the Advancement of Science, said
he will submit the plan next week to
the U.S. Department of Energy, which
funds SLAC. If approved, the money
could start flowing in 1993 and the

project could be com
pleted by 1996.
SLAC collaborated
in the proposal with
UC-Berkeley's Lawr
ence Berkeley labora
tory and is competing
for the grant with Cor
nell University, which
has submitted a simi
lar proposal. Plans for

similar atom smashers also are under
way in Germany, Switzerland, Japan
and the Soviet Union.
As SLAC directors make plans for
the new facility, they also are trying to
fix longstanding problems with the
laboratory's current centerpiece, the
2-mile-long linear collider. The $130
million facility, which collides elec
trons and positrons in order to explore
the fundamental particles of the uni
verse, was the first of its kind and beat
out better-funded European competi
tion in a race to announce important
discoveries in 1989.
However, since those successes, the
collider's performance has been disap
pointing and European laboratories
have taken the lead. The linear collider
program "has not proved as rich as we
had hoped," SLAC physicist Jonathan
Dorfan said.

The Energy Department has given
SLAC until 1992 to solve the collider's
problems or face a re-evaluation of the
laboratory's role. Dorfan could not
give an estimate of when problems
with the collider would be solved.
Even if Richter's proposal is
accepted, the linear collider will con
tinue to run at least until 1996, when
the new accelerator would assume the
spotlight.
Dorfan said it is possible that, in
addition to the grant money, some of
the funds for the new atom smasher's
might be taken from SLAC's existing
budget, which currently is undergoing
cutbacks.
Last month 66 workers were laid off
in response to federal deficit cutbacks
which slashed $10 million from
SLAC's $150 million budget.
Once use of the current linear col
lider begins to wind down, funds would
be diverted to the new facility, Dorfan
said.
Though the new accelerator could
create some practical applications in
medicine, biology and science, he said
"the real spinoff is knowledge."
Dorfan said the new facility could
answer an age-old question about mat
ter/antimatter imbalance. He
explained that a fraction of a second

after the Big Bang, the universe
existed in an equilibrium of matter
and antimatter.
Theoretically, the two elements
should have annihilated each other,
Dorfan said. However, because of an
unknown phenomenon, a slight imbal
ance arose, creating a universe domi
nated by matter.
"We have a model about why the
balance was brokenDorfan said. "We
don't know if the model is correct," he
noted, adding that there are alternate
models.
The new collider would require the
conversion of an old particle colliding
ring into a specialized reactor which
would produce subatomic B-mesons,
which are composed of two quarks —
the fundamental elements of all mat
ter, Dorfan said.
The rare B-mesons are found only
in collider environments and in the
high-energy cosmic rays which bom
bard the earth from space, he added.
Inside the new accelerator, negative
electrons would be accelerated into
positive positrons and the two would
disappear in a flash of light. Re
searchers would then watch the unsta
ble B-mesons fall apart.
"It's an extremely important piece
of physics," said Richter.
