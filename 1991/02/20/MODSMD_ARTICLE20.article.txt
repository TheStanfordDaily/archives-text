# Columnist underestimated the experience of a good trip
## 
### 
LAST WEDNESDAY Ed Heinemann
displayed an uncommon level of
self-confidence when he devoted his
column to the mental effects of LSD.
Heinemann has never tried the drug,
and his knowledge about the subject
comes from a story he heard three years
ago from someone who "wasn't really
that close of a friend."
Despite his qualifications, Heinemann
decided to write about the pros and cons
of LSD. He concluded that although "a
sea of molten gold" sounds like a lot of
fun, it's not worth the risks of taking

LSD, which include — according to
Heinemann — the possibility of forever
being dissatisfied with sobriety.
Let me take this opportunity to offer
an alternative theory — one supported
by a little research.
LSD does not deplete users of their
zest for life; on the contrary, it allows
them to see the world in interesting new
ways that are often meaningful still after
the drug has worn off. Rather than make
a person long to be forever stoned, it
gives him or her new perspectives which
can be helpful in understanding the real

world.
Here is a layman's explanation of the
mental effects of the drug. During the
trip, the brain becomes hyperactive; the
LSD user is bombarded from within by
strange theories, mainly about society
and the subject's position therein.
Often, the user will discover connec
tions among ideas that he or she has
never before related.
While under the influence of the drug,
the user cannot rationally judge the
validity of LSD-induced theories. Some
are quite wacky and have no basis in

reality. After the subject sobers up, how
ever, he or she might find that some of
the new ideas have useful applications in
the real world.
So the big deal about LSD is not the
pretty colors; it's the wild ideas — many
of them felicitous during sobriety.
LSD does not help one to escape the
real world, as Heinemann suggests, but
rather provides a person with mental
tools that can enhance day-to-day sober
living.
