## Breast cancer test requires no surgery Computerized location of lesions is faster than standard biopsy 
### Lisa Goldman 
A new diagnostic technique
provides a faster way to test
breast lesions for malignancy,
raising hopes for earlier detec
tion of some breast cancers.
The new method, known as
stereotactic fine needle biopsy,
was developed by a Swedish
engineer and has been widely
used in Sweden for the past sev
eral years.

With the new proce
dure, only those
patients who actually
have cancer will
need to undergo
surgery.

Dr. Ingvar Andersson, an emi
nent international figure in
mammography and breast dis
ease management, is currently
visiting Stanford to teach the
procedure to American sur
geons.
Stereotactic fine needle
biopsy uses a computer to deter
mine the exact positions of
breast lesions discovered by
standard mammography. Once
doctors have determined the
location of potentially cancerous
tissue, they can use the results
of the computer analysis to
obtain cell material for testing.
During the procedure, the
patient's breast is compressed,
as in a standard mammogram.
The pad that compresses the
breast contains a small aperture,
which doctors position above the
area that contains the lesion.
Doctors then record images of
the lesion from two different
angles, both rotated 15 degrees
from a top view of the tissue.
After medical technologists pro
cess the film, doctors view the

images, locate the lesion and
feed the angles into a computer.
Along with the two images,
doctors provide the computer
with two reference lines. These
lines, which are engraved on the
examining table and projected
onto the film, help the computer
calculate the lesion's precise
position in the breast.
Once the computer has deter
mined the lesion's exact loca
tion, doctors use a hollow needle
to withdraw cell material for
testing. After they take the first
sample, they record another set
of images and repeat the process.
This repetition insures that
an accurate sample is obtained.
In general, doctors retrieve
three samples from regions of
tissue a few millimeters apart.
Doctors can examine the sam
ples immediately to check that
they have enough material, and
then test the tissue. The entire
procedure only takes about 20
minutes, and diagnostic results
are available within one or two
days.
A slightly altered form of the
new method involves marking
the lesion with a small hook for
later reference. A fine wire with
a tiny hook on the end is
inserted into the lesion via a hol
low needle. When the needle is
removed, the hook stays in place,
marking the tissue and making
it easier for a surgeon to find the
tissue during a biopsy.
In contrast, standard mam
mography detects the presence
of lesions but cannot determine
whether they are malignant. To
obtain such information, doctors
must perform a surgical biopsy,
during which a larger sample of
cells is removed through an inci
sion made in the breast. Patients
must undergo surgery without
knowing whether the lesions are
cancerous.
Stereotactic fine needle
biopsy allows medical profes
sionals to test these lesions for

malignancy without requiring
surgery. Because surgical biop
sies are no longer required to
determine malignancy, only
those patients who actually have
cancer need to undergo surgery.
The method also provides
doctors and patients with a
chance to discuss therapeutic
options before treatment begins.
Since patients who have under
gone the procedure already
know whether their lesions are
cancerous, those who do require
surgery can better prepare
themselves emotionally for its
consequences.
However, stereotactic fine

needle biopsy does have some
shortcomings. For exapiple, doc
tors cannot always retrieve tis
sue from the troublesome area.
Also, some lesions are fibrous
and difficult to sample, and still
others are comprised of a mix
ture of benign and malignant tis
sue, raising the possibility of
false negative diagnoses.
Even so, Andersson said,
there is a definite need for the
new technique in the United
States, where one in 10 women
will develop breast cancer.
Andersson will be visiting the
Stanford University Medical
Center until June.
