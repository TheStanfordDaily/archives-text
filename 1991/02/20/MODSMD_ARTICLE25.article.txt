# Seminar addresses water's uncertain future

Most people use water without considering
that its supply may be limited. With a simple
turn of the tap, a seemingly endless quantity
awaits their use.
Or does it?
Peter Gleik, a water resources specialist at
the UC-Berkeley Pacific Institute, addressed
the uncertain future of the global water supply
in a colloquium held last week.
In a lecture entitled "Global Water
Resources: The Coming Crisis," Gleik said
that the threat of global water shortages
"overshadows all other environmental issues
of the '905."
Problems such as decreasing water quality,
inadequate water supplies and disputes over
international access to water resources should
really be viewed as symptoms of large-scale
trends, Gleik said. Examples of such trends
include population growth, global climate

change and north/south resource distribution.
Much of the current water scarcity can be
blamed on the uneven distribution of available
fresh water throughout the globe, Gleik
asserted. While North America enjoys 14,000
cubic meters of fresh water runoff per person
each year, he explained, Africa obtains only
6,500 cubic meters.
According to United Nations standards,
nearly half of the African population does not
have access to safe drinking water, he contin
ued. And more than one billion people world
wide cannot obtain sanitary drinking water.
Gleik also foresees a rising number of inter
national conflicts over fresh water resources.
Many of the world's water basins are shared
by more than one country, he noted. As popu
lation growth, development and irrigation
place greater demands on these supplies, there
is an increasing risk that international fric
tions will escalate.
Gleik cited the current Gulf crisis as an
example of the growing emphasis on water

resources in the international scene. For
example, at one time the United Nations con
sidered cutting Iraq off from the Tigris and
Euphrates rivers, which provide 50 percent of
Iraq's water supply.
However, international disputes are not the
only aspect to the global water crisis. Closer to
home, Gleik noted that the ongoing drought in
California is "comparable" to that of 1977.
Some experts question whether the present
drought might be due to global climate change
rather than to short-term climatic variability.
However, existing statistics only document the
last 100 years, too brief a period to determine
whether the change is part of a larger pattern.
Nonetheless, Gleik did say this current
drought is "unprecedented" in the last 100
years.
Gleik's lecture was part of an ongoing
series of colloquia hosted by the Morrison
Institute for Population Studies. Talks are
held every Wednesday at 4:15 p.m. in Herrin
Hall, room 175.
