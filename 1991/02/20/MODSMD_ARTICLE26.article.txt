# Antibodies may stop deadly septic shock
## 
### Julie Makinen Staff writer 
An antibody to the protein
interleukin-6 protects mice
against deadly septic shock, and
researchers are cautiously opti
mistic that it might also protect
humans who are at risk for the
condition.
Septic shock is currently
treated by antibiotics; surgery
which aims to remove the focus of
infection; fluid infusion and medi
cations that raise blood pressure.
But despite the range of available
therapies, survival rates are no
better than 50 percent.
However, experiments in mice
indicate that antibodies to inter
leukin-6 may prevent the accumu
lation of toxins that cause septic
shock.
"Immunizing mice with inter
leukin-6 antibodies before infect
ing them with bacteria provides a
marked protective effect against
mortality," according to Dr. H.
Fletcher Starnes, assistant profes
sor of surgery at Stanford School
of Medicine.
"I picked up on the idea that
since people had measured inter
leukin-6 levels in some situations
of severe infection, perhaps an
antibody against interleukin-6
might be able to block the over
whelming septic shock. That's
what gave me the idea," Starnes
explained.
Interleukin-6 belongs to a
group of non-antibody proteins
called cytokines. Cytokines are
released by T-lymphocytes, a type
of white blood cells, on contact
with specific antigens — in the
case of septic shock, bacterial tox
ins that accumulate due to sys
temic infections.
After the T-lymphocytes
encounter the bacterial toxins,
cytokines prompt the release of
antibodies. The cytokines, in turn,
act to remove the poisons from
the bloodstream. Thus, cytokines
act as intercellular mediators in
the generation of an immune
response.
Ordinarily, binding proteins
called inhibitors clean the inter
leukin-6 out of the bloodstream
after it has served its purpose.
Unfortunately, when the body
produces large excesses of the
cytokine — such as might occur
during a severe infection — these
inhibitors are overwhelmed, and
the interleukin-6 level creeps
above the threshold of toxicity.
High levels of interleukin-6
apparently contribute to the car
diovascular symptoms of septic
shock, Starnes explained.
Scientists coryecture that anti
bodies to interleukin-6 help the
body regulate cytokine levels,
relaxing the load placed on inter
leukin-6 inhibitors during periods
of intense infection.
Starnes and his associates
found that higher doses of the
antibody produced higher survival
rates, and that a combination of
anti-cytokine antibodies was also

effective against severe infections.
This is the first demonstration
of interleukin-6 antibodies' pro
tective role against septic shock,
Starnes explained.
In the next phase of research,
Starnes will test a combination of
anti-tumor necrosis factor and
interleukin-6 antibodies in mice.
Tumor necrosis factor, also a
cytokine, has been determined by
other researchers to play a role in
septic shock.
Although the findings thus far
are optimistic, Starnes cautions
that a great deal of further explo
ration must be performed before
the results are applied to human
patients.
"A clinical trial on humans is
probably years away," he pre
dicted.
