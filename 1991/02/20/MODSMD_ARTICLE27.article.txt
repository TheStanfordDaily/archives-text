# Septic shock
## 
### 
Septic shock primarily
affects patients who are
hospitalized with serious
disorders such as cancer or
diabetes mellitus. When
these patients develop infec
tions in the intestines, in
the urinary tract or in other
systems, bacteria and bacte
rial toxins may accumulate
in the blood.
Septic shock is usually
regarded as an intensifica
tion of the problems associ
ated with septicemia (the
spread and multiplication of
bacteria within the blood
stream from a localized site
of infection).
Because they can cause
damage to cells and tissues
throughout the body, bacte
rial toxins are often the
main cause of septic shock's
complications. Toxins can
promote clotting of blood in
small blood vessels or leak
age of fluid from blood ves
sels and a reduction in their
ability to constrict, thereby
leading to a drop in blood
pressure.
Symptoms of septic
shock vary depending on the
location of major tissue
damage; effects can include
high fever, chills, headache,
cold hands and feet, a rapid
pulse, vomiting and diar
rhea.
Rapid breathing and
clouding of consciousness
may also occur. Cyanosis
(blue-purple coloration)
may result due to slowed
blood flow. A low output of
urine may signal that kid
ney damage is occurring and
there is a risk of renal fail
ure. Heart failure and
abnormal bleeding may also
develop.
Between 20,000 and
50,000 Americans die from
the condition annually.
