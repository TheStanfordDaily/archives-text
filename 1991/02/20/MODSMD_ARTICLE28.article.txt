Local lab studies zero-g motion
Scuba divers exercising at NASA's Ames
Research Center in Mountain View may help
scientists design better spacesuits for future
astronauts.
"We hope to answer the basic questions of
how human movement and energy consump
tion will differ in the reduced gravity on the
moon and Mars," said the study's principal
investigator, Dava Newman.
In Newman's experiments, certified divers
wearing various assortments of ballast weights
walk on an underwater treadmill. Researchers
record their heart rate and oxygen consump
tion, enabling the scientists to determine the
maximum work a diver is able to perform.
Different arrangements of ballasts corre
spond to different levels of reduced gravity.
The current study involves simulation of five
different gravity conditions, including zero
gravity — "free fall" — and one-sixth Earth
normal, corresponding to the gravitational
force on the surface of the moon.
The research group also hopes to learn
which gaits are most effective in different
gravity fields and what energy expenditures
are associated with those gaits.
"Because humans have evolved under influ
ence of normal Earth gravity, their muscles
and joints probably will respond differently
under partial gravity," Newman explained.
Cornell prof, to deliver lectures
John Hopcroft, chairman of the Depart
ment of Computer Science at Cornell Universi
ty, will give the Forsythe Memorial Lectures in
Computer Science on Monday and Tuesday,
Feb. 25 and 26. Both talks are open to the pub
lic and will be held in Building 420, room 040.
The first lecture, titled "Objects Need Not
be Real," will begin at 7:30 p.m. on Monday.
The talk, of general interest to the computing
community, deals with the prospect of acceler
ating manufacturing processes though com
puter simulation and analysis of designs.
The second lecture, "Toward a Science Base
for Electronic Prototyping," will discuss the
designs of robust algorithms for geometric
modeling and will be held at 4:15 on Tuesday.
Hopcroft, who received his Ph.D. in electri
cal engineering in 1964, has been recognized
for his pioneering work in the theoretical
aspects of computing, especially in the areas of
algorithm analysis, formal languages and
graph algorithms.
The lecture series honors the memory of
computer science pioneers George and Sandra
Forsythe. George Forsythe played a leading
role in the founding of Stanford's Department
of Computer Science and was its first chair.
Sandra Forsythe was a noted computer science
educator and textbook author.
