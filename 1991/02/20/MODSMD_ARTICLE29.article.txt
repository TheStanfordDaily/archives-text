Q. What exactly is fog? Are there different types
• of fog?
A # For most undergraduates, fog most commonly
• occurs during a final exam and does not burn
ofT until the test is handed in. Listening to KFOG
during the test offers little help.
To us scientists, however, fog is known as a
hydrometeor: a visible aggregate of minute water
droplets or ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere
near the Earth's surface. These water droplets or ice
crystals are the result of condensation of water
vapor.
In other words, fog is essentially a cloud on the
ground.
Fogs of all types occur when the temperature and
dew point of the air become identical. That is, we get
fog when the air contains more water vapor than it
can carry at a particular temperature, and when
there is enough suspended particulate matter to
serve as nuclei for condensation — not a problem
with the smog around here.
Warm air can hold up to 3 percent water vapor
before becoming saturated, whereas cold air may
hold as little as 0.01 percent water vapor. When
warm air is cooled, therefore, its capacity to hold
water is reduced, and that excess water can con
dense into fog droplets.
Thus, all fogs are capped by a layer of air whose
temperature is greater than that of the fog. These
inversions of temperature thermally isolate the
underlying foggy air from the warmer, usually much
drier, air above.
The two mayor types of fogs we experience around
here are the advection fogs and radiation fogs.
Advection fogs owe their existence to the flow of air
from one type of surface to another. This usually
occurs when warm, moist air drifts over much colder
land or water surfaces. Coastal fog forms when

warm, moist air flows offshore onto cold water.
Radiation fogs, exemplified by the winter Tule
fogs of the central valley, are produced over a land
area when radiational cooling reduces the air tem
perature to below its dew point. Thus, strict radia
tion fog is a nighttime occurrence, although it may
form by evening twilight and often does not dissi
pate until after sunrise.
KFOG, however, plays 24 hours a day.
Q. What exactly is biological warfare, and how
• serious is it?

A .The military side of biological warfare is much
• more serious than the well-known civilian
experience of biological weapons, in which one eats
large quantities of beans before visiting in-laws.
Biological warfare uses infectious agents, or their
products, to incapacitate or kill human populations.
Effective agents of incapacitation include diseases
like Rift Valley fever and Venezuelan equine
encephalomyelitis. Both diseases have low mortality
rates, cause severe symptoms within a few days, and
have a recovery period of one to two weeks.
Although vaccines are available, there is no effective
treatment for either disease.
The biological agents used to kill are well-known,
and have been feared throughout history. Plague,
anthrax and tularemia ("rabbit fever") are highly
infectious diseases caused by bacteria which show an
untreated mortality rate of 60 percent to 100 per
cent. Vaccines are available for each; the bacterial
strains usually respond well to antibiotics.
However, since every Biology 44 student knows
the fundamentals of introducing antibiotic resis
tance into bacteria, it is likely that most organisms
used in biological warfare would be difficult to treat.
Anthrax has spores which, when inhaled, can kill
an untreated victim within 18 to 36 hours. These
spores are extremely hardy: In the 19405, the
British military tested anthrax spores on a small
island off the coast of Scotland; the island is still
uninhabitable.
There have been several allegations that Japan
used biological warfare against Chinese troops and
civilians during World War 11, and that the United
States did the same against the North Koreans 10
years later. However, these charges have been
emphatically denied by both governments, and little
corroborating evidence has been made public.
Let's hope that the world's leaders never decide
to use these agents and instead hold to their present
course of verbal flatulence.
