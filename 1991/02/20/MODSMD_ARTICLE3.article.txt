# Kyoto center to create new research facility
## 
### Dylan Tyson Editorial staff 
The Stanford Overseas Center
in Kyoto has taken a step toward
becoming the first U.S. university
research institute in Japan by
naming an eminent Japanese
economist, Ken-ichi Imai, as the
center's director of research.
No other U.S. university has an
overseas center in Japan that
serves both as an academic insti
tute and research facility. With
Imai's appointment, the Kyoto
center will also become Stanford's
only overseas research center.
Imai, an international scholar,
will officially take his post Sept. 1,
after which research there will
officially begin.
He joins the Stanford staff
after serving as a professor at
Hitotsubashi University in Tokyo,
a leading Japanese center for
studying business and commerce.
He taught at the university's
Institute of Business Research
and Graduate School of Com
merce.
The appointment is seen as a
move which will benefit Stanford
programs on both sides of the
Pacific Ocean.

"Stanford has not has a
research presence abroad before,"
said Nancy Okimoto, associate
director of the Institute for Inter
national Studies. While many fac
ulty have done overseas research
on their own, she said that
because the program is under
University auspices, there will be
a greater ability to "target and
channel" research programs.
But the program's success will
depend on Stanford faculty doing
individual research in Kyoto, not
through University programs,
said Jim Raphael, executive direc
tor of the Northeast Asia-U.S.
Forum on International Policy
and member of the Stanford
Japan Center Research Govern
ing Committee, which hired him.
Research at the center will
focus on innovation in science and
technology.
"Imai will bring a lot of
strength to the position," Raphael
said. He has contacts with
research institutions and corpora
tions which "will help jump-start
new ties with Japan."
"I think [Imai is] one of the
pre-eminent international schol-
ars in Japan today," Raphael added.
"He will spend some time at Stanford
— he could benefit students on both
sides of the ocean," Okimoto said.
"His background in economics is
very well-respected and connected into
the Japanese government," said Robert
Dutton, director for research at the
Center for Integrated Systems.
Raphael said he believes the new
research center is especially significant
in light of tense relations between the
two countries and Japan's growing

prestige in the sciences.
"A criticism of U.S.-Japan relations is
that the flow of technology has been
asymmetrical (in favor of Japan) for a
variety of reasons," Raphael said. Kyoto
is Stanford's effort to "try to set up its
own listening post.
"Japan is a major center of scientific
and technological innovations," he
added. The research center will allow
Stanford to stay in touch with those
innovations.
The research center will allow fac
ulty to conduct medium-length research
— involving less time than they would
spend on sabbatical.
The time-frame will be one or two
months for a project, with the possibil

ity of an extension, Okimoto said. The
time limit will help faculty mold
research more closely around teaching.
"Many researchers (here) have close
relationships" with researchers in
Japan, Okimoto said. But those rela
tionships don't allow for the kinds of
prolonged projects the center will sup
port. The center will also allow new fac
ulty members to cultivate contacts in
Japan, Raphael added.
Currently, the Kyoto center's
research governing committee is dis
tributing a description of the center's
research proposal and conducting a fac
ulty survey to assess interest.
Research possibilities for students in
Kyoto may also exist.
