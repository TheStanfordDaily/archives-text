# Drought drives animals to drink — in Palo Alto
## 
### Michael Drout Staff writer 
The current water shortage in the Bay Area has
affected the lives of millions of people, modifying
aspects of their behavior that range from lawn care
to showering. But people are not the only Northern
California residents whose lives have been changed
by the lack of water.
Wild animals, from mountain lions to ground
squirrels, have also suffered from the drought.
Unless rain, and lots of it, comes soon, the Bay
Area's human residents may find themselves coming
into contact with other species — more closely than
they ever imagined.
Animals move out of parks and wooded areas and
into yards in search of food and water, according to
Greg Betts, director of the Palo Alto Animal Control
Service Center. When the thirsty creatures begin to
knock over garbage cans or terrorize pets in their

quest for water, homeowners attempt to snare the
newly arrived pests.
"We've had a very large increase in the number of
people requesting to borrow humane box traps from
us," he added. "We get about 15 requests a week,
which is more than double what we were getting two
years ago."
The Animal Control Service Center loans the
traps to homeowners who have trouble with wild
animals.
The drought's effect on wild animals is not lim
ited to developed regions, park personnel emphasize.
"There's been a significant impact [from the
drought]," said Jeff Nunes, a ranger at Joseph D.
Grant Park in Santa Clara County. "Lakes that were
stocked with fish now dry up completely. We've also
seen a lot less deer and coyotes."
The drought also compounds damage done by
grazing cattle, Nunes added.
"The cattle have really done a job on this place,"

he said. "And with the water shortage, none of the
ground cover is growing back."
Some animals, however, are thriving.
"Ground squirrels and birds of prey are doing
great," Nunes said. "They're drought-resistant and
get water from their diet rather than from open
sources. We're seeing more of them. This is changing
the biological composition of the park."
There is an additional positive aspect of the other
wise bleak water situation.
"We have open water troughs for the cattle,"
Nunes said. "Now [the troughs] are effective bait for
all kinds of other animals. Just about everything
comes up to the troughs to drink at some time or
another, so it makes doing studies a lot easier."
But little else is made easier by the drought —
especially for the non-human residents of the Bay
Area, whose plight in dry times is often noticed only
when they become a nuisance to their human neigh
bors.
