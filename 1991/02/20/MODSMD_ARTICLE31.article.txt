### Michelle Ghert Staff writer 
The Stanford baseball team
spent the weekend 'turning the
.tables' by winning two of its
games in the ninth inning. Yester
day the tables were once again
turned at Sunken Diamond, but
this time they were turned on
Stanford as the Cardinal fell to
the Sacramento State Hornets in
a 12-10 decision.
Following a 10-2 Cardinal lead
going into the eighth inning, the
Hornets came back to score 10
runs in the final two innings to
win the game.
"Obviously it was a tough game
to lose," coach Mark Marquess
said. "When you've got an eight

Cardinal 10

you just can't finish it out, it's dis
appointing."
The Hornets froze the Cardinal
winning streak at six games and
left Stanford with 13-3 record for
the season.
Stanford ended the first inning
with a four-run lead as the Cardi
nal rattled Sacramento State
starting pitcher Doug Thurman
by scoring five runs off seven hits.
Leadoff hitter Steve Solomon
doubled and later reached third
base on shortstop Roger Burnett's
infield hit. First baseman David
McCarty tripled to drive in both
Solomon and Burnett, and then
went on to score on center fielder
Jeffrey Hammonds' sacrifice fly.
Third baseman David Holbrook
hit a home run to score catcher
Troy Tallman who had singled
and the inning ended with a 5-1
Cardinal lead.
Stanford went on to score con
sistently in the third through
sixth innings to earn a total of ten
runs. Among these runs were two
home runs by McCarty, one each
in the fourth and sixth innings.
The homers were McCarty's sev
enth and eighth of the season.
McCarty, who now has 25 career
home runs on the Farm, was 4-
for-4 yesterday with three runs
and five RBl's.
"I'm pleased that I've started
swinging the bat better and driv
ing some balls the other way,"
McCarty said. "But it's hard to be
happy when you lose a game like
that."
The Hornets, who only had two
hits in the first seven innings, lit
up their bats in the eighth and
ninth innings to post 10 hits while
Turner's eighth-inning single was
the sole Cardinal hit in the final

three innings of the game.
"To their (the Hornets') credit,
they hit everbody we ran out
there," McCarty said.
Stanford put seven pitchers on
the mound over the course of thee
game. As predetermined, starting
sophomore Jamie Sepeda pitched
three innings, as did relief pitcher
Aaron Dorlarque. Sepeda allowed

five hits and two earned runs, a
large improvement over his start
against Rice University.
Dorlarque, who is having a
great season thus far, allowed two
hits and no earned runs. Dorlar
que has not allowed an earned run
in his last 20 innings of work,
which includes eight relief appear
ances. He has allowed just 13 hits

and two runs while striking out 16
and walking three in his 22 and
two-thirds innings in 1991.
The final four Cardinal pitch
ers combined to allow 10 hits and
ten earned runs. Sophomore Greg
Mix was the losing pitcher and is
now 0-1 on the season.
"We tried a bunch of different

guys and they just kept hitting the
ball," McCarty said.
"We didn't play poorly," Mar
quess said. " We didn't make any
errors. They just hit the ball well
and we gave them free base run
ners. It was a combination of not
being real effective and walking a
few more people than we're used
to."

went on to score on center fielder
Jeffrey Hammonds' sacrifice fly.
Third baseman David Holbrook
hit a home run to score catcher
Troy Tallman who had singled
and the inning ended with a 5-1
Cardinal lead.
Stanford went on to score con
sistently in the third through
sixth innings to earn a total of ten
runs. Among these runs were two
home runs by McCarty, one each
in the fourth and sixth innings.
The homers were McCarty's sev
enth and eighth of the season.
McCarty, who now has 25 career
home runs on the Farm, was 4-
for-4 yesterday with three runs
and five RBl's.
"I'm pleased that I've started
swinging the bat better and driv
ing some balls the other way,"
McCarty said. "But it's hard to be
happy when you lose a game like
that."
The Hornets, who only had two
hits in the first seven innings, lit
up their bats in the eighth and
ninth innings to post 10 hits while
Turner's eighth-inning single was
the sole Cardinal hit in the final

three innings of the game.
"To their (the Hornets') credit,
they hit everbody we ran out
there," McCarty said.
Stanford put seven pitchers on
the mound over the course of thee
game. As predetermined, starting
sophomore Jamie Sepeda pitched
three innings, as did relief pitcher
Aaron Dorlarque. Sepeda allowed

five hits and two earned runs, a
large improvement over his start
against Rice University.
Dorlarque, who is having a
great season thus far, allowed two
hits and no earned runs. Dorlar
que has not allowed an earned run
in his last 20 innings of work,
which includes eight relief appear
ances. He has allowed just 13 hits

and two runs while striking out 16
and walking three in his 22 and
two-thirds innings in 1991.
The final four Cardinal pitch
ers combined to allow 10 hits and
ten earned runs. Sophomore Greg
Mix was the losing pitcher and is
now 0-1 on the season.
"We tried a bunch of different

guys and they just kept hitting the
ball," McCarty said.
"We didn't play poorly," Mar
quess said. " We didn't make any
errors. They just hit the ball well
and we gave them free base run
ners. It was a combination of not
being real effective and walking a
few more people than we're used
to."
