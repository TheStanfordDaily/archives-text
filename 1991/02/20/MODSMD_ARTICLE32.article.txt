# Have no fear, baseball's here

### 
Tt's almost the end of the sports doldrums, that
£| exciting time of the year between when Super
JLBowI hype fades away and when bowl games are
a memory, and before the men of our national
fcastime make their annual migration to old folks'
•jfmradise — Florida and Arizona. And what a delight
It has been. Five basketball games every Saturday on
the networks, with a bowling tournament thrown in
for excitement. The variety was scintillating.
I But no need to extend the complaints. Salvation is
approaching!
* Mtyor league baseball.
« You can tell the end is near when baseball fans
start salivating at the mouth and ask for vacation
time to sweat away in rickety minor league stands
while watching batting practice. When sports pages
sre filled with old greats reminiscing about their
antics at spring trainings past. And when television
•networks start advertising their first broadcast of
preseason baseball — three weeks down the line .
The crack of the bat and the shouts of the umpire
are getting louder. Only one more day 'till pitchers
report! Only a week until everyone is there — the
superstars, the have-beens, the future-greats, the
never-will-be's. But the next month will be the same
for all. March is the time to get in shape, take 1000
at-bats, make the perfect catches and show that you
deserve a place in the show (or that you're worth the
$2,000,000 your team has just shelled out to hold on
to you.)
No more stories about Jose Rijo's marital woes.
No more media coverage of Jose Canseco's divorce
filings, not to mention his speeding tickets. Maybe
even no more detailed reports of arbitration hearings
(and absurd payouts.)
From now on it's just strikes, hits, catches, wins,
losses and rosters. It's Roger Craig (and not the one
who fumbled against those other Giants) teaching
last season's triple Aers what the split-finger fastball
is all about, it's Sparky Anderson putting together
another pennant winner, it's life on the Yankees
without George Steinbrenner (is there life on the
Yankees without George?)
Europeans always complain when they come to
the United States (or if, heaven forbid, soccer is pre
empted for an hour by America's sport) that baseball
is too slow. Too confusing. Too boring.
They don't know what to look for. They're judging
what goes on between home plate and the batter's
box, what happens around the bases, what tran
spires in the outfield.

But there's so much more.
Baseball is the fans' interaction with the players
(and the fans always know more than the guys
on the field, especially if their player misses a
catch or gives up a home run.) It's hot dogs, peanuts
and beer (except at Sunken Diamond where beer is
replaced by soda). It's keeping score, waiting with
your mitt and your hand for a foul to pop back to
you, and the venerable play-by-play announcer.
Baseball is little kids running around during the
game, and crowding around the players for auto
graphs when the 54th out has expired. It's sunny
days and warm nights and stadiums with personali
ties of their own (or at least it was until cities
replaced the classics with cement indoor-outdoor
holding pens.)
Baseball was this past weekend at Sunken Dia
mond.
Since college schedules demand that baseball be
through by June, not October like the real world,
here in the world of classrooms and fraternity par
ties our dosage of the sporting pastime starts a little
earlier, often before there is sun or even fans.
But on the Farm there's no such thing as winter,
at least not by the third week in February. There are
usually plenty of fans. And Cardinal baseball is in
fine form already, even before Six-Pac action has
started.
The three game series against Rice was baseball
at its prime. There were fans on beach towels wear
ing shorts and sunglasses along the third base line,
and alumni with their kids and grandchildren filling
the bleachers. The weather was perfect. The baseball
even better.
You can't ask for much more.
Great action, great weather, great traditions.
Baseball is back.
