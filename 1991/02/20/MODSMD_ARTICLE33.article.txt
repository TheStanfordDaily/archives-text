# O'Brien, Yee win at Hobee's
## 
### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
In a match with few highlights,
other than the fact that Stanford
was in the unusual (or usual, as
the case often is) position of play
ing itself, the Cardinal's No. 1 duo
of Alex O'Brien and Jason Yee
downed teammates Jared Palmer
and Dan Turbow 6-2, 6-4 in the
doubles final of the Hobee's Nor-
Cal Intercollegiate Tennis Cham
pionshps yesterday.
"Neither team played excep
tionally well. Neither team played
poorly," Coach Dick Gould said.
"Probably the best thing you can
say about the match was that it
gave both teams good practice for
the National Team Indoors in
Louisville later this week."
In the first set, O'Brien and Yee

capitalized on two crucial break
points. O'Brien, who plays the ad
side, returned especially well
when it counted. "The difference
in the match was their ability to
win the big points," Palmer said.
"Usually, when you're serving,
you can come back from a break
point down. But Alex was all over
us on the break points. He came
up with some big returns exactly
when they needed them."
In the second set, Turbow was
broken in his first service game,
and the rest was history. Both
teams held serve for the rest of
the set, giving O'Brien and Yee a
6-4 triumph and the match. "I lost
that game early on and, by the
time we picked up our games a lit
tle bit, it was too late," Turbow
said.
"If anything, this match will

help get us ready for the Indoors
this week. It's not going to be an
easy tournament this year, so the
more practice we can get in
beforehand, the better," O'Brien
said. O'Brien, who won the singles
title in the Hobee tournament for
the past two years, did not play
singles this year.
The singles final of the Hobee
tournament, which pitted Califor
nia's Carl Chang against another
Bear, Peter Fitzpatrick, was post
poned until after the National
Team Indoors.
Stanford will leave for
Louisville, Ky. today. With its No.
1 player Jonathan Stark sidelined
with a foot injury, the Cardinal
will bring three freshmen on the
trip. According to Gould, two
freshmen will play singles and all
three could play doubles.
