# Men's golf heads for Hawaii
## 
### George Malone Staff writer 
Golf is a sport that treats its
players right. The tournaments
are almost always held in balmy
vacation spots (how many golf
tournaments are there in
Antarctica anyway?) on first
rate golf courses.
This week is no different for
the Stanford men's golf team.
Coach Wally Goodwin has taken
the up-and-coming squad to
Honolulu, Hawaii, this week to
participate in the John A. Burns
Intercollegiate Golf Classic
against some of the top teams in
the world.
Although the weather will be
fantastic, the team won't be
spending all its time sunbathing

and surfing. "This is a big, big
tournament," said Coach Good
win; "All the big guns of college
golf are there."
Included in the tournament
field are Arizona, Arizona State,
Oklahoma State and Las Vegas,
all of whom are ranked in the
top ten in the NCAA poll, and
Japan's top collegiate team
from Nihon University.
"Our goal here is to finish in
the top six or seven and make a
name for ourselves in this tour
nament," said Goodwin.
The team members playing
in Hawaii are the same ones
who played in Arizona, includ
ing junior captain Christian
Cevaer, sophomores Mike Mil
liken and Dave Rutkowski, and

freshmen Notah Begay and
Casey Martin, and Goodwin is
confident that his team is ready
to play.
"Things have been going
pretty well. We're playing well
right now. Mid-Pac golf course
is a tough courseâ€”it's really
windy and longer than most.
The wind throws us off espe
cially because we never practice
in it at Stanford," Goodwin
said.
However, a little extra insur
ance never hurt, right, Coach?
"Well, one of the golf pros
down at Mid-Pac sent me a map
of the course with the prevail
ing winds on it, so we can be a
little better prepared," Goodwin
added.
