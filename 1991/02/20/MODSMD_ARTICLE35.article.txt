### Michelle Ghert Staff writer 
The ability of Stanford wo
men's aquatics is well known.
However, it is not as well known
that the Cardinal dominance in
the water continues beyond the
swimming and diving teams. The
Stanford synchronized swimming
and women's water polo teams are
unacclaimed powerhouses them
selves.
After winning the national
championship in 1986, the Cardi
nal women's water polo team has
been rebuilding in recent years
and is once again in form for vic
tory. The team posted four wins
last weekend in the regional tour
nament at UC-Berkeley to earn its
first tournament victory.
The Cardinal squad defeated
UC-Berkeley 10-4 and the Radian
Women's Water Polo team 10-1 in
the preliminaiy rounds. Stanford
then went on to crush UC-Santa
Cruz 10-3 in the semifinals and
capture the tournament title by
breaking away from UC-Santa

Barbara 6-4 in the finals.
The game-winning goals in the
final were scored by junior
Vanessa Perry and sophomore
Ineke Ayubi. Junior Leny Marcus
was the weekend's high scorer
with a total of 18 goals.
"Last weekend was the first
time I played primary hole-set in a
tournament," Marcus said. "I was
very excited about how things
went, it builds confidence for next
year." Marcus was substituting
for the starting primary hole-set,
senior Viv Albritton, who sat out
the tournament.
Other Cardinal goal scorers
included sophomore Hillary
Green, juniors Nicole Chabot and
Susan Meyer, and senior Ginny
Cohn. Aside from shooting well,
the Cardinal was decidedly
stronger in the water.
"We outswam the other
teams," Marcus said. "(Coach)
Sean Flannery swim 3 us a lot."
Flannery, a former member of the
Stanford men's water polo team,
stresses conditioning and speed in
the water, as well as team cama

raderie.
"We're really happy he's our
coach," Marcus said. "Sean knows
how to have fun."
The Cardinal squad will
attempt to earn its second tourna
ment victory of the year at Cal.
Poly San Louis Obispo this week
end. Stanford will also host this
year's national qualifying tourna
ment in April.
"Hosting the national qualify
ing tournament is very important
to us because its never been done
here before," Marcus said. "When
we get the whole team together,
we're gonna drown some really
good teams."
The Stanford synchronized
swimming has placed second at
the national championships
behind the Ohio State Buckeyes
for the past four years. This Sat
urday, the Cardinal will host the
Buckeyes at the DeGuerre pool
complex. Routines will begin at
1:00 p.m.
"We'll see how they fare
against us on our home turf,"
freshman Debbie Downes said.
