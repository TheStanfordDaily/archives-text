# RF kids point out advantages to dorm life
## 
### Robin Mathison Staff writer 
When Brad Porteus went off
to college at Duke University,
he knew exactly what to expect.
He was accustomed to living
with hundreds of other stu
dents and eating dorm food.
Brad Porteus, now 22, lived
in Roble Hall for his last two
years of high school; his par
ents are former resident fel
lows Evan and Ann Porteus,
Living on campus as the son
of RFs was "the greatest thing
ever," says Porteus. "I could
live the life of a college student
while doing high-school work."
At age 17, Porteus says he
was initially overwhelmed by
the 300 Roble students. How
ever, eating all of his meals in
the dorm quickly enabled him
to meet other people.
"Eating with people was the
most positive experience since I
was still really impression
able," he says.
After experiencing life in a
college dormitory, he was able
to see the "physical and per
sonal facades" that people wear
everyday in high school, he

says. At Stanford, "I would see
people in the dorm roll out of bed
and go straight to the dining hall.
... If you live in a dorm you see all
sides of them. People couldn't put
up a facade."
Porteus also credits living in
Roble with "making me more
motivated to do well in high
school, because I knew if I did well
I'd have the opportunity to go to a
place like Stanford." But he says
he did not want to attend Stan
ford because he had already lived
here for two years.
Brendan McDermott, 17, says
he values the past two years he
has spent at Stanford. McDer
mott, who moved from New York
City to live in Burbank with his
father Ray, a professor of educa
tion, says, "Just being in Califor
nia really changes attitudes." Liv
ing on campus has calmed him
down, he says, since the students
are much more mellow than the
"high-strung, stressed-out New
York City people."
In addition to changing his
attitude, living on campus has
made McDermott more indepen
dent, he says. Since he has his
own dorm room, like many of the
older children of RFs, he can come
and go freely and can blare his
music without upsetting his par
ents.
Through living in Stern Hall,
McDermott says he has "learned a
lot more about how to deal with
people, since there's 97 of them
running around all the time." The
age difference doesn't bother him,
because he enjoys spending time
with other students and attending
their parties.
Like McDermott, the children
of James Fox, associate professor
of anthropology, and his wife Mar
garet, an accountant in the con
troller's office, largely ignore the

age gap between them and the
other students in Cedro.
For John, 17, and Rachel, 13,
the age difference may not be all
that large. But even Susie and
Christine, ages 8 and 6, like to
spend time with the students.
When the family first moved
into Wilbur Hall, Susie Fox
thought the students "wouldn't
really like us or pay any attention
to us," she says. But to her sur
prise they were receptive, and she
often plays hide-and-seek, tag and
ping pong with them.
"Once the students meet us,
they never forget us," Fox says.
"They're really fun to play with."
Unfortunately, she says, the
students can only play in the
afternoons since they have to
study at night. "It doesn't make
me look forward to going to col
lege because there's so much
work," she says.
Another drawback to dorm life
is the occasional conflict between
students' parties and the girls'
slumber parties. "When we have
sleepovers all the dorm kids would
be out drinking," Fox says.
Because the noise and alcohol
in the dorm during weekend
nights, the girls are forbidden by
their mother to hang out in the
dorm during the parties.
The atmosphere on campus
has excited Rachel Fox about
going to college. "It seems like
there's a lot of stuff you can do
when you grow up," she says.
John Fox says he is also
impressed by student life, particu
larly by the Residential Education
system. And the lack of dorm dis
cipline surprises him. "I thought
it would be a lot more strict," he
says. "People can do pretty much
what they want."
The family, who admitted they
were picky eaters, say the worst
part of living in Wilbur is food ser
vice. "There's nothing to eat,"
says Rachel Fox. "Everything's in
a sauce and the vegetarian stuff is
kinda gross."

After several years on campus
as RFs, the Fox family purchased
a house in Palo Alto, but "we
always knew we'd be back," Mar
garet Fox says. They moved into
Wilbur last year as soon as their
two oldest children, out of six,
entered college. The experience
has been beneficial to the chil
dren, she says, despite the cot
tage's smaller living quarters.
Russell Rickford, 15, echoes
this sentiment. Although his par
ents, John, professor of linguistics
and Angela, residence dean in
Branner Hall, moved the family
into a much smaller house with a
lot less privacy when they arrived
on campus, he says he finds it
interesting to live in a university.
"I prefer [living on campus], in
terms of things that go on," he
says. In his previous house, "there
were a lot of old people on the
street. It was a dead neighbor
hood," he says.
In contrast, Stanford's lively
atmosphere provides Rickford
with a lot of entertainment. His
favorite programs have been
watching Rosa Parks speak and
seeing a recent rap contest.
Although Rickford doesn't
attend Stanford parties, since he
says he wouldn't get in, he is not
bothered by the noise level on
weekends.
The noise sometimes does dis
turb Peter Samuelson, an eight
year-old living in Toyon and the
son of Communication Prof. Kris
tine Samuelson. Peter, whose bed
is close to the wall, says it's irri
tating when the students bounce
balls in the hallway and play
music late at night.
"I like the music they play
except sometimes they play it real
loud and that's annoying, espe
cially when I'm trying to get to
sleep," he says. His bedtime, usu
ally 8:30 or 9 p.m., often conflicts
with the students' schedules.
However he likes having the stu
dents around him, since they
make him feel safe, he says.
