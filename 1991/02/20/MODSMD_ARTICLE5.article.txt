Speakers at a celebration last night
during the national day of remem
brance for Japanese-Americans
interned during World War II drew par
allels between anti-Asian racism 40
years ago and anti-Arab sentiment now.
"The Arab-Americans are being sub
jected to the same kind of racism Asian-
Americans faced. The excuse is fear of
terrorism; with the Japanese, it was
fear of sabotage," said a Japanese-
American woman who lived in the
incarceration camps. She spoke at a pro
gram sponsored by Stanford University
Nikkei, a Japanese-American student
association that has celebrated the day
for the last three years.
The speech commemorates the 49th
anniversary of the signing of Executive
Order 9066, which placed 120,000
Japanese-Americans in detainment
camps in the Western United States. It
took place at an photograph exhibit in
Meyer Library depicting life in the
camps.
Former camp internee Tsuyako
Kitashima told 20 students about her
experience.
Twenty-four years old at the time,
Kitashima, commonly known as "Sox,"
lived with her mother and three broth
ers in one horse stall at a racetrack

turned into temporary camp in Tan
foran, Calif. She called the experience
humiliating and shocking.
"I couldn't believe I was in America,"
she said.
Another speaker, Senior Linguistics
Lecturer Khalil Barhoum, focused on
the rise in attacks on Arab-Americans
last August. "When the war started the
number of hate crimes went through
the ceiling," he added.
"I find it alarming to know the U.S.
administration decided to dispatch
500,000 young soldiers ... to protect
the rights of 500,000 Arabs who happen
to be Kuwaiti, but hasn't done anything
to protect the 3,000,000 Arab-Ameri
cans who happen to be law-abiding, tax
paying citizens," Barhoum said.
Preventing a repeat of history is one
of the stated objectives of the exhibit in
Meyer. Those photos give a different
picture than the one seen in textbooks,
said Kathleen Hirooka, a cultural out
reach librarian at Meyer.
For example, the exhibit includes a
sample poster ordering Japanese-Amer
icans to "evacuate." Another photo in
the exhibit pictures a Japanese-Ameri
can World War I veteran being herded
into a car by two officials. An old man,
he still wears his uniform, complete
with stripes and pins, and his wrinkled
lips are pursed with sorrow and dignity.
"It makes it more vivid to actually

see photographs of forgotten chapters
in history," she said.
Assembled in 1989, the exhibit will
remain on the first floor of the library
until March 22. Julie Cain, head of
reserves at Meyer called it "one of the
best exhibits we've had here in terms of
quality and topicality."
The exhibit has been viewed by older
people, young children and families, as
well as by students.
"The camps couldn't have come into
existence without a large anti-Asian
sentiment" beforehand, Hirooka said.
Japanese-Americans were confronted
with blatant racism, as seen in one pho
tograph of a Caucasian woman's house
with an enormous sign over the front
porch that reads, "Japs keep moving;
This is a White Man's neighborhood."
"We're trying to make the tie very
clear," Hirooka said. She said every time
there has been a crisis involving a group
of foreign descent, the Japanese deten
tion camps have been mentioned. For
example, during the Iranian hostage
crisis, some people suggested interning
Iranian-Americans in the old campsites.
Barhoum said he thinks the out
break of a ground war with substantial
American casualties could produce
more apparent racism against Arab-
Americans. "It may not be internment
camps, but it'll take a toll on the civil
rights of Arab-Americans," he said.
