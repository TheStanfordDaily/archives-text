# Japanese-American recalls experiences of suffering and discrimination during war
## 
### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Staff writer 
A picture of two Japanese girls —
their necks draped with paper identifica
tion tags — transports Jeanette Horley
to a painful part of her past.
"Did I live though that?" she asked,
staring blankly at the black-and-white
image. "Those girls remind me of me
and my sister."
For Horley, 54, an operations man
ager at the Food Research Institute
Library, this photograph and others in a
Meyer Library photograph exhibit docu
ment a tragic, though not often dis
cussed, episode in American history —
the mass incarceration of 120,000
Japanese-Americans in detention camps
during World War II because of what the
government called "military necessity."
In 1942, Horley, then five years old
and with the surname Nakamoto, and
her family were uprooted from their
plum-and-pear farm in Placer County,
Calif, and sent by government officials
to a temporary detention camp in Tan-

foran, Calif.
Following a brief stay
there, the family was
carted off to a perma
nent camp in Tule
Lake, Calif. Two years
later they were trans
ferred to Topaz, Utah,
the site of another per
manent center, where
they remained for one

year.
Nearly half a century later, the
images of Horley's distant youth are still
painfully vivid — barbed wire, guards
and horse mangers turned into resi
dences.
"We always had to improvise," she
recalled. "There was no refrigeration in
the camps so my father would make an
icebox out of the window."
Horley's family was released from the
Topaz camp in 1945. They returned to
their farm.
"My father owned the land and we


Horley
were able to go back to it. We were
lucky," she said. Others weren't
so fortunate.
Horley's grandfather, who
immigrated to the United States
at the turn of the century, lost his
land during his incarceration. His
American dream deferred, he
moved in with Horley's parents,
she said.
Time has not dulled the feel
ings of humiliation, rejection and
shame which these memories stir
in Horley. "It is difficult to open

up," she said, her voice straining.
"So one just often keeps quiet."
The photo exhibit provides a
necessary forum to the Japanese-
American imprisonment, said
Kathleen Hirooka, the Cultural
Outreach Librarian at Meyer.
"This documentary doesn't
shun the issues [about the camps]
that were not spoken of before —
such as draft resistance arid sui
cides in the camps," said Hirooka,
whose parents also survived the
internment camps.
"The pictures educate others
on what happened and allows
suppressed feelings among
Japanese-Americans to come to
the surface. It will get people to

talk about [the detention
camps]," she said.
The pictures tell grisly tales: a
77-year-old man hanging from a
rope, guards beating young men,
and people being herded like ani
mals.
Horley said the Meyer exhibit,
although it portrays the past,
could serve as a lesson for the
future, particularly with the con
tinuation of the Persian Gulf War.
"If the experience of Japanese-
Americans helps Arab-Americans
today, that's good. They should
not have to suffer the same dis
crimination we did during World
War II," she said.
