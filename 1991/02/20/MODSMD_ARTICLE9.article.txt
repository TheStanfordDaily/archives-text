# Stanford hosts MEChA conference
## 
### Sonya Martinez 
Representatives of MEChA chapters
at 10 Northern California universities
met at Stanford last weekend to discuss
issues facing their communities, includ
ing budget cuts, educational issues and
the Persian Gulf war.
According to Stanford MEChA offi
cer and Council of Presidents member
Ingrid Nava, the MEChA Central Con
ference meets about once a month at dif
ferent universities to coordinate work
among the individual chapters. MEChA
is a statewide Chicano/Latino student
organization.
MEChA co-chair Lorena Barron, a
senior, said about nine Stanford stu
dents came to the conference and among
the 10 universities that were repre
sented, a total of about 50 people
attended.
This year, many California universi
ties are facing financial problems which
threaten existing campus resources for

Chicano and Latino students, partici
pants said.
In addition, many universities
already lack the resources Stanford has,
such as campus Chicano/Latino centers,
Nava said.
Nava said problems facing other cam
puses include a lack of space for stu
dents and problems with
Chicano/Latino faculty not receiving
tenure.
Besides budget cuts, the University
of California and California State Uni
versity systems instituted 40 percent
tuition hikes for next year, which Nava
said may cause problems for many stu
dents.
Sophomore Adriana Martinez, who
attended the conference but is not a
member of MEChA, said another impor
tant issue this year was the Persian Gulf
war. Participants discussed the dispro
portionate number of people of color in
the armed forces.
In addition, the possibility of going

into junior and senior high schools and
"educating our people about what is
involved" in the war was also men
tioned, she said.
Another conference topic was devel
oping outreach projects to "prepare Chi
cano students to be college-bound,"
Martinez said. She cited Stanford
MEChA's mentor program at Sequoia
High School and the Barrio Assistance
program as examples of such projects
that are already in operation.
One specific issue that came up at the
conference was the controversial closing
of Stanford's Office of Mexican-Ameri
can Affairs. The University decided last
month to eliminate the office and lay off
its director, Fernando de Necochea,
because of budget cuts.
A similar office was closed at CSU-
Santa Clara over the summer, and stu
dents from other universities were very
interested in helping to keep the office
at Stanford open, Martinez said.
