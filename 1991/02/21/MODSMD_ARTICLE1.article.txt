# Hoover House accounting faces revision, Kennedy says
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
Prompted by intense congressional
scrutiny, Stanford will likely alter the
way it bills the government for some
indirect costs of research — including
expenses associated with Lou Henry
Hoover House, the residence of Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy.
The announcement, made by
Kennedy in a speech Tuesday to alumni
in Washington, D.C., represents the first
move in a broader overhaul of Stan
ford's accounting system.
In recent weeks, congressional inves
tigators have criticized the University
for using a billing method that relies on
statistical approximations rather than
item-by-item charges. They have ques
tioned whether it is appropriate for
Stanford to charge the government for a

fraction of Hoover
House expenses such as
flower arrangements,
dry cleaning bills and
purchases of antiques.
In his speech,
Kennedy indicated the
University will develop
a more easily under
standable way of allo
cating Hoover House

charges. "An item-by-item test should
be applied to (the Hoover House)
account and perhaps other sensitive
areas," he said. "I should have been
more alert to this policy issue, and I
should have insisted on more intensive
review of these transactions."
Last month, Kennedy acknowledged
that Stanford's accounting system has
"real as well as perceived" shortcomings
and announced that the University had

hired Arthur Andersen & Co., a "Big
Six" accounting firm to suggest ways to
improve Stanford's accountability for
federal research dollars.
Because several research-related con
ferences and briefings are held in
Hoover House each year, federal rules
allow Stanford to charge a fraction of its
operating costs to the government. For
decades, all the operating costs of the
house have been lumped together in a
single accounting pool, a portion of
which is then charged to the govern
ment as an indirect cost of research.
The amount billed to the government
— 23 percent — has been derived from
past statistical studies of the various
uses of the residence.
This method of allocating costs has
saved Stanford and the government a


Kennedy
lot of paperwork, administrators
say. But it has also left the Uni
versity extremely vulnerable to
questions on whether dozens of
individual items in the Hoover
House accounting pool are rele
vant to research.
Congressional investigators
have criticized the University for
including items in the Hoover
House account that "have noth
ing to do with research."
A staff member of the House
Subcommittee on Oversight and
Investigations, one of the federal
agencies probing Stanford's poli
cies, said Kennedy's announce
ment was a positive sign.

"They should do this on every
account," said the investigator,
who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
But such a sweeping overhaul
seems unlikely.
In the past, Kennedy and other
administrators have said a system
that incorporates across-the
board item-by-item review would
be extremely expensive. Univer
sity public affairs officials indi
cated yesterday that a new system
is likely to retain some pooled
accounts.
In his speech, Kennedy said
that in the case of Stanford
libraries, for example, allocation
by pool may be the best method.
Keeping a book-by-book tabula
tion of use would be highly
impractical, he said.
As of yesterday, it was unclear

what accounts, in addition to
Hoover House, would be con
verted to item-by-item review.
Larry Horton, associate vice pres
ident for the Office of Public
Affairs, said final decisions on
how to alter Stanford's account
ing system will not be made until
an Arthur Andersen review is
completed several weeks from
now.
Kennedy is also awaiting
advice from a high-profile five
person panel that was formed last
month. Panelists include Bobby
Inman, former director of the
National Security Agency, and
Paul O'Neill, chief executive offi
cer of Alcoa and chair of President
Bush's Education Policy Advisory
Committee.
Congressional investigators
said yesterday that they have

found questionable costs in sev
eral other accounting pools.
For example, charges from
past Freshmen Orientations are
being examined, an investigator
said. Orientation charges are part
of the University's student ser
vices accounting pool, about 18
percent of which is charged to the
government.
In 1985, Stanford included
$900 in the student services pool
for two bus trips to San Francisco
and the beach as part of Orienta
tion.
A congressional investigator
said she failed to see the causal
relationship between "a trip to
the beach" and federally spon
sored research.
"We are questioning the causal
relationships of several items,"
she said.

In 1985, Stanford included
$900 in the student services pool
for two bus trips to San Francisco
and the beach as part of Orienta

A congressional investigator
said she failed to see the causal
relationship between "a trip to
the beach" and federally spon
sored research.
"We are questioning the causal
relationships of several items,"
she said.
