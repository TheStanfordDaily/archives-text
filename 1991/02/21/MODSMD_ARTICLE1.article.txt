# Hoover House accounting faces revision, Kennedy says
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
Prompted by intense congressional
scrutiny, Stanford will likely alter the
way it bills the government for some
indirect costs of research — including
expenses associated with Lou Henry
Hoover House, the residence of Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy.
The announcement, made by
Kennedy in a speech Tuesday to alumni
in Washington, D.C., represents the first
move in a broader overhaul of Stan
ford's accounting system.
In recent weeks, congressional inves
tigators have criticized the University
for using a billing method that relies on
statistical approximations rather than
item-by-item charges. They have ques
tioned whether it is appropriate for
Stanford to charge the government for a

fraction of Hoover
House expenses such as
flower arrangements,
dry cleaning bills and
purchases of antiques.
In his speech,
Kennedy indicated the
University will develop
a more easily under
standable way of allo
cating Hoover House

charges. "An item-by-item test should
be applied to (the Hoover House)
account and perhaps other sensitive
areas," he said. "I should have been
more alert to this policy issue, and I
should have insisted on more intensive
review of these transactions."
Last month, Kennedy acknowledged
that Stanford's accounting system has
"real as well as perceived" shortcomings
and announced that the University had

hired Arthur Andersen & Co., a "Big
Six" accounting firm to suggest ways to
improve Stanford's accountability for
federal research dollars.
Because several research-related con
ferences and briefings are held in
Hoover House each year, federal rules
allow Stanford to charge a fraction of its
operating costs to the government. For
decades, all the operating costs of the
house have been lumped together in a
single accounting pool, a portion of
which is then charged to the govern
ment as an indirect cost of research.
The amount billed to the government
— 23 percent — has been derived from
past statistical studies of the various
uses of the residence.
This method of allocating costs has
saved Stanford and the government a
