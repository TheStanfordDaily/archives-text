Bush proposes energy strategy
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Bush
yesterday unveiled a national energy strategy
that relies heavily on promoting new energy
production and only modestly on conservation.
Bush called the plan "a strategy for an ener
gy future that is secure, efficient and environ
mentally sound."
Among other features, the plan calls for
opening new areas for oil and gas production
and increased reliance on alternative fuels.
The blueprint was released after 18 months
of public hearings and internal administration
debate. Bush acknowledged that his proposal
will be criticized by some but said "none of
them will propose a plan that is more compre
hensive or in my view more carefully thought
out."
Energy Secretary James Watkins said the
plan was designed to reduce U.S. oil consump
tion by 3.4 million barrels a day by the year
2010 while increasing domestic production.
