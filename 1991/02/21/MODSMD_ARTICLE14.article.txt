MOSCOW (AP) - The Soviet
parliament formally censured
Russian leader Boris Yeltsin yes
terday for urging Mikhail Gor
bachev to resign, and Gorbachev's
former foreign minister pleaded
for peace in the "war of presi
dents."
The plea by Eduard Shevard
nadze, in his first public remarks
since his resignation as foreign
minister last December, suggested
the depth of the crisis in Soviet
government. Shevardnadze quit
after warning that the nation was
heading toward dictatorship.
In a stormy session of the
Supreme Soviet parliament, fel
low lawmakers accused Yeltsin,
the president of the Russian Fed
eration and a frequent Gorbachev
critic, of declaring a civil war and
seeking more power for himself.
In a resolution adopted 292-29,
with 27 abstentions, they accused
Yeltsin of defying the constitution.
The resolution said his state
ment on national television Tues
day was "aimed at replacing the
lawful organs of state power... .It
contradicts the constitution and
aggravates the situation in the
country."
Shevardnadze, who spoke at
the opening of a non-governmen
tal foreign policy association he

heads, told reporters that if desta
bilization continues, dictatorship
or a civil war is still possible.
He urged Yeltsin and Gor
bachev to meet to resolve their
diferences because "this war, a
war of parliaments, a war of laws
and now a war of presidents, must
be ended."
"Everybody must think of the
country, the people, the fate of
democracy in the Soviet Union
and the world," Shevardnadze
said.
In his resignation speech last
December, Shevardnadze blamed
the military and the Communist
Party's Old Guard for Gor
bachev's shift away from reform.
He said Wednesday that the Soviet
crackdown in the Baltics, which
occurred after his resignation,
"confirmed that my fears were not
baseless."
In an interview in the latest
issue of the radical magazine
Ogonyok, Shevardnadze said a
"shadow power" is operating
alongside and sometimes circum
venting the nation's constitu
tional bodies. "The shadow power
is dangerous because it is anony
mous," he was quoted as saying,
and the only way to stop it is to do
what he has done and warn soci
ety of the danger.
