## Energy plan wimps out 
### 
Bush tries to reduce import
dependency and misses real
issue of decreasing oil use

PRESIDENT BUSH'S NEW
energy policy comes at the
right time, but it's the wrong
proposal.
As a nation, the United States is
definitely overly dependent on for
eign oil, and a new energy plan is
certainly necessary. But to the
president's discredit, Bush has
missed the larger picture: The
United States is too dependent
upon all oil, not just foreign oil.
Bush's plan, released yesterday,
includes a call for increased domes
tic oil production. By stepping up
domestic production, Bush has
apparently reasoned, we will be
able to reduce significantly our
reliance on oil imports.
But imports are only part of the
problem.
Moreover, the plan seeks to find
the new supply of oil in the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska.
Recall that our oil exploits in the
Alaskan region have already
destroyed one ecosystem. How
much more damage are we going to
wreak just to rid ourselves of a
dependence on foreign oil?
We need to begin to move away
from oil altogether.
A second component of the plan,
addressing non-oil energy sources,
calls for a loosening of regulatory
barriers to the development of
nuclear power. But even this pro
posal is a watered down version of
what we really need.
Nuclear energy has a bad repu
tation which we must transcend so
that in the future we will be able to
harness its tremendous energy
potential. In the meantime, what's
needed is serious research into
nuclear energy so that we can

develop safe and efficient means of
using it.
Bush's plan also opposes raising
gasoline taxes. While a sudden
price hike will cause painful shocks
to the economy, a gradual increase
in gas tax makes sense. Drivers
have the incentive to decrease gas
consumption and car manufactur
ers will respond by producing more
fuel-efficient vehicles. Moreover,
the tax revenues can fund much
needed research and development
of alternative energy sources.
We appear to be witnessing poli
tics at its worst. Afraid to take on
the nation's powerful oil-depen
dent industries, Bush has released
a weak-kneed plan that fails to
address the most urgent aspects of
the energy problem.
Fortunately, there are currently
bills in Congress which, between
them, do focus on the larger issue
of all oil dependence.
One such bill, introduced by Cal
ifornia Rep. Barbara Boxer, would
mandate that automobiles become
40 percent more fuel efficient over
the next decade.
Other legislation currently
before Congress seeks to impose
penalties on the most inefficient of
cars and trucks, while granting
credits for fuel efficient cars. Ulti
mately, though, a truly meaningful
energy policy will have to be geared
for the long haul and will, by neces
sity, be unpopular as well.
Our highway system will sooner
or later prove obsolete. We must
seek to develop high-speed,
transcontinental trains as well as
dependable and affordable mass
transportation for our cities.
We will have to pay for our cur
rent dependence.
Energy Secretary Watkins says
we should not "force Americans to
change their lifestyles." On the
contrary, our lifestyles will have to
change, and in coming years we
will have to effect drastic measures
to effect such changes.
