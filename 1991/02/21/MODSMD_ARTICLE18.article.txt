Military's structure does not allow for meritocracy

THE EDITORIAL, "ARMY HAS TO
change," (The Daily, Feb. 12)
began, "One of the most basic
principles underlying the U.S. military
system is that it is a system based on
merit." I contend!
The military system is first and fore
most a system based in hierarchy. The
notion that admitting women into com
bat roles will put them on "even footing"
with men is a naive fallacy. The very
structure of the military renders it inca
pable of ever becoming an egalitarian
institution, or "meritocracy".
I do not oppose your effort to bring
equal opportunity to the Army, but I
insist that you broaden your vision and
look at military demographics. Ask why
black women are 48.7 percent of all
enlisted women in the Army and only
19.3 percent of women officers, accord
ing to a September 1990 report.
An article in the October 1987 Objec
tor states black women are approxi
mately 13 percent of the U.S. population
and that black teenage women face
statistics such as 48 percent unemploy-

The military is not a democratic arm of this country. It is
a system that strips individuals of constitutional rights
and of their basic humanity. It is an institution whose
ultimate purpose is killing (often described by the
euphemism of 'defending democracy').

ment. Are you aware that women's com
plaints of sexual and racial harassment
must be handled by a chain of command,
a system which is ineffective due to the
likelihood of retaliation and no guaran
tee of confidentiality?
An equal employment opportunities
officer reported that in 20 years of expe
rience she did not know of one woman
who was not persecuted for reporting
sexual harassment, also according to The
Objector.
The military is not a democratic arm
of this country. It is a system that strips
individuals of constitutional rights and
of their basic humanity. It is an institu

tion whose ultimate purpose is killing
(often described by the euphemism of
"defending democracy").
The people who serve in the military
must be molded to be capable of killing
other people. Looking at personal testi
monies of the dehumanization involved
in preparing for combat provides insigh
into the discrimination of women from
this role.
The military takes the attitudes and
behaviors ingrained in young men by a
society that encourages and rewards
dominance and aggression via the mode
of mass media, war toys, corporate
power structures, etc. and sculpts them

into the soldier whose purpose is pre
cisely to aggress and dominate.
We are dealing with a positive feed
back cycle where militarism has social
impacts and the society prepares mate
rial for the military machine. It is a
vicious cycle which can only be disman
tled by resistance on multiple levels.
One level is giving women equal
opportunity within the military. This
will happen only if civilian civil rights
groups address conditions inside the mil
itary and do outreach to women in the
service. Too often civilians do not make
the connections between the statistics of
which women are in the militaiy and the
socioeconomic conditions those women
are up against.
If we want "a system based on merit"
we need more than band-aid solutions
such as allowing women into combat
positions; we need to resist inequality on
a deeper level by working for conversion
to a peace-based economy that will pro
vide justice for all beings involved.

VanDerveer and women 9 s basketball team deserve praise

Kudos to david hirning for
his Feb. 7 article, "Women worthy
of watching." I am a long-time fan
of women's basketball and agree with
most of what he wrote.
With increasing satisfaction, I have
watched Stanford women's basketball
grow from a point 10 or so years ago
when the participants would sometimes
outnumber the spectators to witnessing
two consecutive capacity crowds at
Maples last year during the regional
tournament. I have watched the pro
gram progress from having excellent stu
dents who were average players to excel
lent students who were also some of the

most highly recruited athletes in the
country
The quality of coaching and level of
play have dramatically increased to the
point of bringing Stanford a national
championship last year in a sport in
which only a few years ago I did not dare
think Stanford would ever reach the pin
nacle. The difference between then and
now is a wonder to behold and has to
rank as one of the most noteworthy suc
cesses in the history of Stanford athlet
ics.
We can't thank Tara VanDerveer and
her staff enough for the effort and guid
ance they have put into bringing the pro

gram to this point. We should also thank
former Athletic Director Andy Geiger for
his effort in bringing Coach VanDerveer
and her staff here.
While I agree with Mr. Himing that
the women play a purer form of the
game, I have to wonder if he has
watched the same games I have when he
indicates that the women don't play
"physical."
Some of the roughest and most
intense basketball games I have seen
have been played by women. I have seen
plenty of punishment delivered and
received in women's basketball games. I
have heard groans and other exclama-

tions from spectators (men as often as
women) in reaction to some of the physi
cal play, leading me to believe that they
preferred the relative safety of courtside
for themselves.
If you like to watch finely tuned ath
letes plav basketball, then it stands to
reason that you should also like to watch
women's basketball because you are
watching athletes who happen to be
women who are also very good at what
they are doing. That should be entertain
ing for any true sports fan. I hope to see
you at the games.
