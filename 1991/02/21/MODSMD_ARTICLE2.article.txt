# WAR IN THE gulf
## Fighting grows as clock ticks toward 'G-Day' 
### 
D HAH RAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) — In barren
border encampments and ornate halls of gov
ernment today, the war vigil ticked toward "G-
Day"the —the start of the allied ground offensive
in the Arabian desert. An escalating series of
clashes suggested the call to battle was near.
There was some life left in a Soviet-proposed
peace plan, but President Bush was reported to
have told Mikhail Gorbachev the proposal
needs new conditions attached in order to be
acceptable.
Baghdad radio said Saddam Hussein and his
inner circle, the Revolutionary Command
Council, had studied the Soviet proposal and
would soon respond. It did not say whether
they had agreed to it.
Along the desolate Saudi northern frontier,
fighting intensified — border skirmishes had
escalated into artillery duels and allied incur
sions into enemy territory. A million allied and
Iraqi ground troops steeled for all-out war.
In one clash, Iraq lost five tanks, 20 artillery
pieces and an unspecified amount of men,
while one American was killed and seven
wounded by Iraqi fire, the U.S. military com
mand said yesterday.
In another action, two teams of Army heli
copters, each composed of a Kiowa scout and
an Apache gunship, destroyed a complex of
more than a dozen Iraqi bunkers across the
border yesterday afternoon, capturing up to
500 Iraqi soldiers, the command said.
It was the second mass capture of Iraqi pris
oners in the month-old war, the first being dur
ing the battle of Khafji.
U.S. commanders refused to say whether

the two engagements took place in or
near Kuwait or Iraq and would not
name the units involved. Military ana
lysts have said a key element of a
ground assault could be an allied end
run through southern Iraq to cut off
Saddam's forces in Kuwait.
In another allied strike, the com
mand said U.S. aircraft hammered a
cluster of Iraqi vehicles parked in
Kuwait, 60 miles north of the frontier,
destroying 28 tanks, 26 other vehicles
and three big guns.
Bored and on edge, many allied
infantry and tank soldiers were
expressing a desire to get on with the
ground war.

Some allied commanders have sug
gested it is difficult to keep troops at
hair-trigger readiness for an extended
period.
But the U.S. Central Command
spokesman, Marine Brig. Gen. Richard
Neal, said yesterday his soldiers were
"ready to go right now — or they can
go in two weeks."
A U.S. military official in Washing
ton, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said preparations for the
assault were in place and all that was
needed was an order to go on the
ground.
"We are in the eye of Desert Storm,"
the official said. "There is something
of a lull right at the moment."

Baghdad radio had its own war fore
cast. It said yesterday that when the
ground fighting begins, allied soldiers
will be sent home in "endless convoys
of coffins."
Terms of the Soviet peace proposal
have not been disclosed, but the Wash
ington Post said in today's editions
that Bush has told Gorbachev he
should add three conditions: Iraqi
withdrawal in four days from the time
it agrees to do so, disclosure of all
minefields and release of all prisoners.
The four-day deadline was said to
have been calculated to force the Iraqi
army to leave many of its tanks
behind.
In Moscow, Foreign Ministry

spokesman Vitaly Churkin said the
Kremlin has had no contact with the
Iraqi government since its foreign
minister, Tariq Aziz, left the Soviet
capital Monday with Gorbachev's
peace plan.
He said the Soviets hoped for a
"prompt and clear-cut response."
Some allied pilots flying missions
over Kuwait reported continued steady
success knocking out Iraqi armor and
said they hoped there would be no rush
to the ground war.
Despite a month of round-the-clock
bombing of Iraqi positions, U.S. forces
still face a formidable, entrenched
army, the airmen said.
