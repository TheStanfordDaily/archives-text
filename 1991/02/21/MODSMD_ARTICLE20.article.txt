"It was, he thought, another sign of
Catholic guilt and desire for punishment
that plagued his parents' generation and
from which there seemed no escape. In his
arrogance, Miguel thought that he was
finding ways out of it through his univer
sity education. He had not yet had time to
combine learning with experience, how
ever, and he still felt himself superior to
those who had brought him up and loved
him."
— Arturo Islas in"The Rain God"
WE READ ARTURO ISLAS' "The
Rain God" in our Western Cul
ture track, the same quarter that
we read Ralph Ellison, Gabriel Garcia
Marquez and Flannery O'Connor. Spring
quarter of "Conflict and Change" was
refreshing after I struggled through the
first two quarters. The themes that we
explored made sense and the readings
seemed infinitely more relevant. I had
many favorite books that quarter, but
none engaged me as much as "The Rain
God."
The novel broached many of the major
topics of the Chicano experience: the fam
ily ties, the struggle and merging of cul
tures, Catholicism, the fixation with
death and rebirth, as well as more univer
sal topics about identity and the past. The
story of the Angel family reminded me of
my own and brought back familiar feel
ings of being sandwiched between two
cultures.
Particularly poignant was the personal
conflict of Miguel Chico, the main charac
ter in the novel, who struggled between
the traditional Mexican culture he grew
up with and the intellectual values he

gained through his education at a distant
college (allusions to Stanford are plenti
ful).
Islas writes about Miguel Chico: "He
was still seeing other people, including
himself, as books. He wanted to edit
them, correct them, make them behave
differently. And so he continued to read
them as if they were invented by someone
else, and he failed to take into account
their separate realities, their differences
from himself."
It was only at his grandmother's death
bed that Miguel Chico finally saw his
identity as a synthesis with his past — as
represented by his grandmother as well
as his future as a college professor. His
identity was no longer a case of "either
or."
Both of Islas' novels, "The Rain God"
and the recently published "Migrant
Souls" reflect various aspects of his expe
riences growing up in a Chicano family in
the border town of El Paso, Texas.
Although Islas often asserted that neither
of the two books were autobiographical,
he also admitted that they were based on
his own familial and personal memories
— that the personalities of his family
inevitably peered through the characters
in the novels. He never denied the unmis
takable identification between Miguel
Chico and himself.
I was present when Prof. Islas deliv
ered the fifth annual Galarza lecture last
spring quarter. His lecture, entitled:
"Migrants at the Border" was a short
speech, mostly reflections about his days
at Stanford — first, as one of very few
Chicano students and then as one of the
very few Chicano faculty. He also read a

passage from his last novel "Migrant
Souls."
The passage he chose was particularly
funny and had the audience rolling with
laughter. (He narrated the story of a Chi
cano family trying to smuggle a turkey
with them across the border.) Under
neath the picaresque humor and lyrical
narrative, however, the passage also high
lighted immense contradictions of the
Chicano experience.
I never met Prof. Islas, although I've
always meant to ask him to autograph my
sister's copy of "The Rain God." I had
also always wanted to sign up for his class
"Creative Writing for Bilinguals." I
finally managed to fit it into my tentative
schedule of classes for spring quarter of
my senior year — next quarter.
Even though I never did meet Prof.
Islas, I cannot help but feel acquainted
with him through his novels. Perhaps it's
because, as he often said, the Angel family
could be almost any Chicano family. His
death was a great loss to Stanford and to
Chicano literature, but because his novels
are so poignantly personal and involve so
many aspects of the Chicano experience,
he will inevitably touch many people that
will never get the chance to meet him.
In this way he will live on.
