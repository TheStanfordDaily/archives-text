## It's a long way from Bakersfield to the big time 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
If you'd told Kenny Ammann during
his senior year of high school that some
day he'd be playing basketball for Stan
ford, he probably would have laughed in
your face.
If you'd told Kenny Ammann during
his freshman year at Division II Cal
State-Bakersfield — after he'd received

no offers at all from any schools
— that someday he'd be starting for the
Cardinal, he probably would have said
you were crazy.
If you'd told Kenny Ammann during
his sophomore year at Rancho Santiago
Junior College — after he was cut by Cal
State-Bakersfield — that someday he'd
be a two-year starter at a Pacific 10 Con
ference school, he probably would have
recommended a good psychiatrist for
you.
And if you'd told ... well, you get the
idea.
It's pretty safe to say that Ammann,
the Cardinal's starting off guard for the
last two years, has taken what must be
the most circuitous route to Stanford
that anyone could have possibly
dreamed. It's taken work, it's taken
luck, it's taken coincidence ... and
above all, he says, it's taken just a little
bit of help from above.
"Looking back, I just see the Lord's
hand on the whole thing," says
Ammann, who's been a strong Christian
since his junior year in high school. "It
just worked out too good to be chance.
I've really learned a lot. If I'd just come
here out of high school I wouldn't be the
same person.
"It was really neat the way it worked
out," Ammann says. "I'm just so thank
ful to be here. . . . It's just really worked
out perfectly."

Of course, Ammann couldn't have
come here straight out of high school in
1986, because (A) that would have been
too easy, and (B) then-Stanford coach
Tom Davis hadn't given Ammann the
time of day. "If I could have picked one
place to go it would have been here,"
Ammann says, "but they never
recruited me or anything."
There were other schools after
Ammann, however — including Mon
tana, whose coach back then — of
course — was Mike Montgomery. If you
like coincidences, this gets better: Mont
gomery and Ammann's father were fra
ternity brothers at Long Beach State.
"I did follow him in high school —
since his dad was a fraternity brother of
mine, when I saw the name 'Kenny
Ammann' it meant more than 'Joe
Shmoe,"' says Montgomery, who was
then in his his last year as the Grizzlies'
coach before coming to Stanford.
Montgomery's interest turned into a
scholarship offer, which Ammann —
naturally — refused. "He wanted me to
sign early, but I thought I was going to
get a better offer," Ammann says."I told
him I was going to wait until after the
season was over."
Whoops. The season ended, the bet
ter offers never came ... and Mont
gomery gave the scholarship to someone

Senior Kenny Ammann has earned a reputation as a good outside shooter in his
two seasons with the Cardinal. But he also does other things that have helped the
team to a 14-10 record.
