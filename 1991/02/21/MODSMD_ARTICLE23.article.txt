## It's a long way from Bakersfield to the big time 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
If you'd told Kenny Ammann during
his senior year of high school that some
day he'd be playing basketball for Stan
ford, he probably would have laughed in
your face.
If you'd told Kenny Ammann during
his freshman year at Division II Cal
State-Bakersfield — after he'd received

no offers at all from any schools
— that someday he'd be starting for the
Cardinal, he probably would have said
you were crazy.
If you'd told Kenny Ammann during
his sophomore year at Rancho Santiago
Junior College — after he was cut by Cal
State-Bakersfield — that someday he'd
be a two-year starter at a Pacific 10 Con
ference school, he probably would have
recommended a good psychiatrist for
you.
And if you'd told ... well, you get the
idea.
It's pretty safe to say that Ammann,
the Cardinal's starting off guard for the
last two years, has taken what must be
the most circuitous route to Stanford
that anyone could have possibly
dreamed. It's taken work, it's taken
luck, it's taken coincidence ... and
above all, he says, it's taken just a little
bit of help from above.
"Looking back, I just see the Lord's
hand on the whole thing," says
Ammann, who's been a strong Christian
since his junior year in high school. "It
just worked out too good to be chance.
I've really learned a lot. If I'd just come
here out of high school I wouldn't be the
same person.
"It was really neat the way it worked
out," Ammann says. "I'm just so thank
ful to be here. . . . It's just really worked
out perfectly."

Of course, Ammann couldn't have
come here straight out of high school in
1986, because (A) that would have been
too easy, and (B) then-Stanford coach
Tom Davis hadn't given Ammann the
time of day. "If I could have picked one
place to go it would have been here,"
Ammann says, "but they never
recruited me or anything."
There were other schools after
Ammann, however — including Mon
tana, whose coach back then — of
course — was Mike Montgomery. If you
like coincidences, this gets better: Mont
gomery and Ammann's father were fra
ternity brothers at Long Beach State.
"I did follow him in high school —
since his dad was a fraternity brother of
mine, when I saw the name 'Kenny
Ammann' it meant more than 'Joe
Shmoe,"' says Montgomery, who was
then in his his last year as the Grizzlies'
coach before coming to Stanford.
Montgomery's interest turned into a
scholarship offer, which Ammann —
naturally — refused. "He wanted me to
sign early, but I thought I was going to
get a better offer," Ammann says."I told
him I was going to wait until after the
season was over."
Whoops. The season ended, the bet
ter offers never came ... and Mont
gomery gave the scholarship to someone


Al Green — Dally file
Senior Kenny Ammann has earned a reputation as a good outside shooter in his
two seasons with the Cardinal. But he also does other things that have helped the
team to a 14-10 record.
else. With nothing else to do,
Ammann had actually enrolled in
a junior college before Bakers
field's coach called him from out
of the blue to offer him a scholar
ship. It was better than nothing,
so Ammann was headed for Bak
ersfield — but he wasn't too
thrilled about it.
Amman had a fairly decent
year at Bakersfield — he started
dating Brandi Wildharber (more
on that later) and scored 10 a
game as a part-time starter for
the Roadrunners — but then
after the season the coach was
fired, a new one came in . . . and
he told Ammann to take a hike.
The move sent Ammann to
Rancho Santiago JC, where he
hoped to maybe make it back to
Bakersfield's league the following

year. Two years, two kicks in the
pants.
However, way up north, Stan
ford's new coach was starting to
think about the future. In 1989
Montgomery would find himself
with three experienced guards —
Todd Lichti, Terry Taylor and
Scott Meinert — who were about
to graduate. It was time to find
some help.
"It was a situation where we
had three senior guards getting
most of the playing time, and we
weren't sure if we could bring in
three quality freshmen," Mont
gomery says. "We figured we'd try
to bring in an older guy who had
some experience, so we thor
oughly investigated — nationally
— the possibility of a JC player
who could (1) be good enough to
play, and (2) qualify academically.
"It came down to one guy."
Guess who?
There was still the small mat

ter of getting in, and once that
was accomplished there was also
Brandi to think about. She'd left
Bakersfield earlier and moved in
with Ammann's mother for a cou
ple of months before finding her
own place, but now, with Kenny
leaving, she had to decide what to
do.
After discussing the situation,
Brandi decided to follow Ammann
to the Bay Area, find a job, and
see what would happen.
"I didn't have any family in
Southern California," Brandi
says, "so I figured I'd take a
chance and if it didn't work out
I'd just sell everything I owned

and move to Greece or something.
Sometimes you've got to take
chances."
We're pretty sure things have
worked out all right, because
Kenny and Brandi were married
last summer.
If he'd taken that scholarship
at Montana; if he hadn't gone to
Bakersfield; if he hadn't been cut
and then enrolled at a JC, where
Montgomery could find him; if
Montgomery hadn't had those
three senior guards; if Brandi
hadn't been willing to take a
chance. . . . Who knows?
Sometimes, Someone keeps an
eye out for you.
