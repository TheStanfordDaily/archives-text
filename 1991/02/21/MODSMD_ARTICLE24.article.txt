### 
TONIGHT - 7:00 p.m. (PST) tipoff at
University Activities Center. KZSU (90.1
FM), as always, will be on hand, with
the diplomatic Brian "What, we aren't
getting pre-empted for baseball?"
Webber on play-by-play.
RECORDS - Stanford (14-10, 7-7 and
fifth in Pac-10 play), ASU (14-8, 5-7 and
eighth).
CARDINAL UPDATE â€” The Cardinal is
2-5 on the road this season.... Guard
John Patrick scored 41 points (all of
them in the second half) in last week
end's games against USC and UCLA.
Patrick is shooting 46-for-101 from
three-land (.456), good for second in
the Pac-10, and leads the team in free
throw percentage at .832.... Fresh
man Brent Williams scored 14 points
and grabbed nine rebounds in his first
career start Saturday against UCLA.
