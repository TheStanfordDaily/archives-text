# Quiet Zeilstra plays a loud game
## 
### David Hirning Senior staff writer 
Someone once said that Jim
Morrison, legendary vocalist of
the Doors, was so intense that
when he finished a show, all he
could do was go back to the hotel
and wait for the next one. Substi
tute basketball games for con
certs, and you have a good descrip
tion of the Cardinal's Julie Zeil
stra.
Physically and emotionally
spent after games, the 6-foot-3
forward is easy to spot in the
crowd, waiting with headphones
on for the team bus to take her to
back to the hotel. Her choice of
music is not quite in the hard-rock
genre of the Doors, however.
"It's a mix of slow songs I made
to relax myself," said Zeilstra, who
actually plays the guitar and
writes music in her spare time.

The music choice fits Zeilstra's
unassuming personality away
from the game. In general, the
junior keeps to herself, studies a
lot (she was an Academic All-
American last year) . . . and basi
cally waits for the next game.
But when that game starts,
Zeilstra turns into "Z," an offen
sive force that paces the Cardinal
at 19.7 points per game. The All-
America candidate is all over the
court, pounding the ball inside,
shooting the three-pointer, sprint
ing downcourt for the long pass
and layup.
"When I get on the court, I'm
so competitive, so intense — I just
change into a totally different per
son," Zeilstra said. "I like myself a
lot better off the court. On the
court, I'm out for blood."
Just as Morrison was known
for his on-stage excesses, Zeilstra
has sometimes gotten carried

'When I get on the
court, I'm so com
petitive, so intense
— I just change
into a totally differ
ent person. I like
myself a lot better
off the court. On
the court, I'm out
for blood.'

away within her own competitive
drive. One particular incident in
practice earned her a two-game
suspension from the starting
lineup.
"Sometimes I have a hard time
separating how I am on the court
in games, where you can be out for
blood, and in practice with your
own teammates," she said. "I get a
little bit too competitive even for
practice.
"I'm a perfectionist in basket
ball, and I get upset with myself
when I don't do the things I want
to do. I get frustrated, and then
Tara (VanDerveer, the Cardinal
coach) gets mad at me."
"Julie puts a lot of time into her
game," VanDerveer said. "She's
extremely motivated."
It is this drive that has made
Zeilstra one of the dominant play
ers in women's college basketball.
It is a tribute to her value that in
a year in which VanDerveer has
experimented with many starting
lineups, Zeilstra has been in every
one save the two games in which
she was being punished.
Much like her competitive
drive, Zeilstra's penchant for hard
work can reap both good and bad
results. Attending high school in a
town of 7,000 in Utah, Zeilstra did
little else but play basketball after
giving up her first loves, the hep
tathlon and volleyball, following
her sophomore year. It paid off
when she made the Parade and
Converse first team All-America
squads.
But when she first came to
Stanford, Zeilstra threw herself
into basketball with an even
greater vigor. After running stadi
ums with Katy Steding ("I
couldn't stop," she said, remem
bering) and playing endless pick
up games with Jennifer Azzi, Zeil

stra ended up with two sore
Achille's heels.
"I have terrible feet... they're
not made for sports," Zeilstra
said.
But despite playing with pain
most of last year, Zeilstra started
all 33 games and was a solid con
tributor, averaging 13.8 ppg and
6.1 rpg. This year, a cortisone shot
over the Christmas break has
eased almost all the pain, and Zeil
stra's game has never been better.
In a crucial road trip last week
end, Zeilstra had 54 points and 22
rebounds in two games as Stan
ford swept the Los Angeles
schools despite the absence of
starting center Trisha Stevens in
one of the games. With Stevens's
role limited by tendonitis, Zeilstra
has emerged as a star.
Not know for her flamboyant
play, this still surprises Zeilstra.
"We didn't need [me to scorel last
year, and I was perfectly comfort
able with my role last year," she
said. "I think that they need me to
look for my shot more, and be a
little more offensive-minded.
"Whatever the team needs in a
game, I'll do. . . . A lot of times,
it's the dirty work."
No stranger to physical play,
Zeilstra can do the dirty work
inside, and is averaging seven
rebounds a game this season, sec
ond on the team. She has also
worked on her drop-step and
turnaround hook, and has gener
ated a lot of points in the paint for
the Cardinal.
But all the points and accolades
are secondary for "Z," who looks
to herself (her own toughest
critic) for the rewards.
"I get the most joy when I'm
done with the game and I'm
drained," she said. "When I know
I've tried as hard as I could. If you
have any energy left, you haven't
done your job."
When she feels that way, the
intense Julie Zeilstra walks out of
the dressing room, headphones
on, and waits for the team bus to
take her to the hotel, where she
waits for the next game.

genre of the Doors, however.
"It's a mix of slow songs I made
to relax myself," said Zeilstra, who
actually plays the guitar and
writes music in her spare time.

The music choice fits Zeilstra's
unassuming personality away
from the game. In general, the
junior keeps to herself, studies a
lot (she was an Academic All-
American last year) . . . and basi
cally waits for the next game.
But when that game starts,
Zeilstra turns into "Z," an offen
sive force that paces the Cardinal
at 19.7 points per game. The All-
America candidate is all over the
court, pounding the ball inside,
shooting the three-pointer, sprint
ing downcourt for the long pass
and layup.
"When I get on the court, I'm
so competitive, so intense — I just
change into a totally different per
son," Zeilstra said. "I like myself a
lot better off the court. On the
court, I'm out for blood."
Just as Morrison was known
for his on-stage excesses, Zeilstra
has sometimes gotten carried

'When I get on the
court, I'm so com

away within her own competitive
drive. One particular incident in
practice earned her a two-game
suspension from the starting
lineup.
"Sometimes I have a hard time
separating how I am on the court
in games, where you can be out for
blood, and in practice with your
own teammates," she said. "I get a
little bit too competitive even for
practice.
"I'm a perfectionist in basket
ball, and I get upset with myself
when I don't do the things I want
to do. I get frustrated, and then
Tara (VanDerveer, the Cardinal
coach) gets mad at me."
"Julie puts a lot of time into her
game," VanDerveer said. "She's
extremely motivated."
It is this drive that has made
Zeilstra one of the dominant play
ers in women's college basketball.
It is a tribute to her value that in
a year in which VanDerveer has
experimented with many starting
lineups, Zeilstra has been in every
one save the two games in which
she was being punished.
Much like her competitive
drive, Zeilstra's penchant for hard
work can reap both good and bad
results. Attending high school in a
town of 7,000 in Utah, Zeilstra did
little else but play basketball after
giving up her first loves, the hep
tathlon and volleyball, following
her sophomore year. It paid off
when she made the Parade and
Converse first team All-America
squads.
But when she first came to
Stanford, Zeilstra threw herself
into basketball with an even
greater vigor. After running stadi
ums with Katy Steding ("I
couldn't stop," she said, remem
bering) and playing endless pick
up games with Jennifer Azzi, Zeil

stra ended up with two sore
Achille's heels.
"I have terrible feet... they're
not made for sports," Zeilstra
said.
But despite playing with pain
most of last year, Zeilstra started
all 33 games and was a solid con
tributor, averaging 13.8 ppg and
6.1 rpg. This year, a cortisone shot
over the Christmas break has
eased almost all the pain, and Zeil
stra's game has never been better.
In a crucial road trip last week
end, Zeilstra had 54 points and 22
rebounds in two games as Stan
ford swept the Los Angeles
schools despite the absence of
starting center Trisha Stevens in
one of the games. With Stevens's
role limited by tendonitis, Zeilstra
has emerged as a star.
Not know for her flamboyant
play, this still surprises Zeilstra.
"We didn't need [me to scorel last
year, and I was perfectly comfort
able with my role last year," she
said. "I think that they need me to
look for my shot more, and be a
little more offensive-minded.
"Whatever the team needs in a
game, I'll do. . . . A lot of times,
it's the dirty work."
No stranger to physical play,
Zeilstra can do the dirty work
inside, and is averaging seven
rebounds a game this season, sec
ond on the team. She has also
worked on her drop-step and
turnaround hook, and has gener
ated a lot of points in the paint for
the Cardinal.
But all the points and accolades
are secondary for "Z," who looks
to herself (her own toughest
critic) for the rewards.
"I get the most joy when I'm
done with the game and I'm
drained," she said. "When I know
I've tried as hard as I could. If you
have any energy left, you haven't
done your job."
When she feels that way, the
intense Julie Zeilstra walks out of
the dressing room, headphones
on, and waits for the team bus to
take her to the hotel, where she
waits for the next game.

Julie Zeiistra has stepped into the limelight as one of the top
basketball players on the West Coast. After practice is over, however,
she takes on a much more relaxed attitude until It's game-time again.
Someone once said that Jim
Morrison, legendary vocalist of
the Doors, was so intense that
when he finished a show, all he
could do was go back to the hotel
and wait for the next one. Substi
tute basketball games for con
certs, and you have a good descrip
tion of the Cardinal's Julie Zeil
stra.
Physically and emotionally
spent after games, the 6-foot-3
forward is easy to spot in the
crowd, waiting with headphones
on for the team bus to take her to
back to the hotel. Her choice of
music is not quite in the hard-rock
genre of the Doors, however.
"It's a mix of slow songs I made
