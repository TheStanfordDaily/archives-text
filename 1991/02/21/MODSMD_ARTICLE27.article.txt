# Men's golf team starts well in Hawaii

The Stanford men's golf team is learning
to keep focused on its matches.
Trying to play 18 holes of golf in Hawaii
with the distracting surf, sun and sand can
be quite a challenge, but the squad per
formed well in its first round of competition
at the John A. Burns Intercollegiate Golf
Classic at Mid-Pac Golf Course on Oahu.
The Stanford men shot a 296 for the day,
only five shots behind first-place host team
Hawaii and well ahead of some good teams
like UC-Santa Barbara and Texas-El Paso.
The Cardinal was led by sophomore Mike
Milliken shooting 1-over 73, followed by

junior Christian Cevaer and freshman
Notah Begay at 74, freshman Casey Martin
at 75 and sophomore Dave Rutkowski at 76.
In addition, senior Johan Remmelgas came
with the team to play as an individual and
also scored a 75.
Milliken's 73 is only five shots behind the
tournament's individual leader, Todd
Gilchrist of UCSB, who posted the only
score in the 60s for the round. Chris Zam
brey of USC is in second with a 2-under 70.
"In a great field after the first round, I'm
really pleased with our consistency. . . .
When you look at us as a pack, we didn't
score any 71s or 725, but we didn't shoot any
77s or 78s either," coach Wally Goodwin
said.

The Mid-Pac course's challenge is its
vicious trade winds which can throw golfers'
shots completely off, but Goodwin was
pleased.
"The winds were really terrific — they
came intermittently. We faded on the last
few holes and took some bogeys because the
holes played into the wind, but all the short
game we've been practicing on has paid off,
and it had to today," Goodwin said.
As if the everyday distractions in Hawaii
weren't enough, the team is also staying on
the Kanahoe Marine Air Station and inter
acting with the marines stationed there.
"The team members have had some great
conversations with the Marines — it's been
a real experience," Goodwin explained.
