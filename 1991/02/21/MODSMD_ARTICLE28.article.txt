# Flags or freedom?
## 
### 
Ever since the Persian
Gulf War began, I have
observed as the nation's
patriotic fervor has entered the
sports world. I'm sure many of
you have seen the signs at cam
pus events.
First it was a moment of
silence before the national
anthem "in remembrance of
our troops." Then it was an
encouragement to sing along
with Francis Scott Key's song.
And most recently, there is the
appearance of flags on the play
ers' jerseys.

Stanford is only following
the rest of the pack, so to
speak. The little emblems have
sprouted on the uniforms of
college athletes across the
country. Basketball players at
UNLV went so far as to put
fighter jets on their shorts,
while at Washington State the
players and coaches had yellow
ribbons on their persons.
Again, all in "support of the
soldiers fighting in the Persian
Gulf War."
Last weekend in Los Ange
les, the Cardinal women's bas
ketball team was not wearing
flags, although both its oppo
nents were. It was only when I
saw this contrast that it
occured to me to find out why.
Perhaps, I thought, some
people on the team had
objected to wearing the flag,
because it could be construed
as support for U.S. foreign pol
icy objectives in the Middle
East. Perhaps it was not an
issue, team coaches and players
reasoning that they did not
want to get mixed up in politi
cal issues while trying to pre
pare for the playoffs.
Instead, coach Tara Van-
Derveer told me it was a simple
case of timing. The Athletic
Department had ordered flags
for University teams, but they
had not arrived in time to be
sewn on the team's jerseys

before it left on the trip. Mean
while, the men's team was
playing back at Maples adorned
with the new flags. Ditto for
the baseball team at Sunken
Diamond.
"We'll get the flags when we
get back," VanDerveer said. "I
hope they ordered enough."
"I think [wearing the flag]
reinforces a national unity,"
VanDerveer said. "That's
something we want on our
team." She said that her entire
team was in support of the
troops in the Gulf.
There is a problem with
the whole situation, how
ever, and that is that it
leaves no room for individual
thought or freedom. While
complete unity and adherence
to the norm may be a positive
thing on the athletic field, it
can be harmful in other aspects
of life. The subject of war and
peace is one of those aspects.
Let's imagine that you were
on a Stanford team, and you
objected to the U.S. involve
ment in the Gulf. If suddenly
every other team in the Pac-10
and around the country on
television was wearing flags,
and your team was considering
it, would you have the fortitude
to say, "No, thank you?"
If you said, "Sure," then let
me give you two real-life
instances. Then give me your
answer.
Marco Lokar is an Italian
citizen who used to play for
Seton Hall's basketball team.
He was just a foreign player on
a team known for its foreign
players, a team which went to
the NCAA finals two years ago
with an Australian player at
guard. Lokar didn't garner
that much attention — he was
averaging just 3.1 points a
game this year.
But when Seton Hall fol
lowed the trend and began
wearing flags on its uniforms
on Jan. 15, Lokar was the only
player that said, "No, thank
you." Less than a month later,
after being booed every time he
touched the ball and receiving
anonymous phone threats to
himself and his pregnant wife,
Lokar made headlines — he
