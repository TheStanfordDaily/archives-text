# Netters go to Indoors

### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
Stanford will be limping when
it meets its toughest competition
of the year at the National Team
Indoors in Louisville, Ky. today
through Sunday.
Stanford's No. 1 player and
arguably the best player in college
tennis, Jonathan Stark, is side
lined with a foot injury, and,
according to coach Dick Gould,
this could pose some serious prob
lems for the Cardinal as early as
its first match against Notre
Dame today at noon.
"Obviously without Jonathan
we're at a tremendous disadvan
tage," Gould said. "The good
thing about it is that it gives more
of our players a chance for experi
ence. We're going to need that
depth later on in the season."

Stanford, the top seed at the
tournament and the defending
champion, will play as many as
two freshmen in singles and
maybe a third in doubles. Alex
O'Brien, Jared Palmer and Glenn
Solomon will fill the top three sin
gles spots, but, according to
Gould, the rest of the lineup is "up
in the air." Jason Yee and fresh
men Robert Devens, Michael
Flanagan and Vimal Patel will
fight it out for the other three
spots.
O'Brien and Yee will play No. 1
doubles, and Palmer and Dan Tur
bow No. 2. The third doubles spot
has not been decided yet.
Even with its top gun missing,
Stanford still has a good shot at
defending its title. But this time
the players are taking things a lit
tle more seriously, starting with
the first match.
