# Council welcomes sorority
## 
### Connie Chang Editorial staff 
At its weekly meeting last
night, the Intersorority Council
officially welcomed the new Chi
Alpha Pi sorority, which was for
mally recognized last week by the
University.
University recognition came
last Friday after "hundreds of
hours" of work since last spring,
said sophomore Shaney Geddis,
president of the new sorority.
Geddis said Chi Alpha Pi mem
bers are excited and called her
sorority "another home for
women to fit into."
Greek organizations seeking
formal University recognition
have to submit a 100-page pro
posal to the Office of Student
Affairs. Upon approval, they must
also submit a constitution and a
list of rules for their activities.
Laura Lindsey, the sorority's
delegate to the ISC, said the
administration at first seemed to
discourage the formation of a new
sorority.
Lindsey said the new sorority
was founded last spring because
many women rushed and some
times had "trouble finding a
match." She added that her soror
ity is different because it is more
diverse.
Geddis said the sorority would
like to become affiliated with a
national sorority. She has
arranged for representatives of
Chi Omega, the largest sorority
nationwide, to meet Chi Alpha Pi
members in March.
The ISC also discussed certain
Rush-related concerns last night.
Because the week when bids
are offered coincides with
Prospective Freshman Week, the
ISC decided to hold closed bid par
ties and forbid "roll-out" break
fasts for pledges during that week.
The ISC came up with the
guidelines after Pro Fro Week
organizers expressed concern
about possible conflicts.
The guidelines are intended to
keep prospective freshmen from
attending bid parties and alleviate
problems for those staying with
sorority pledges.
One ISC delegate said "roll
outs" — knocking on a pledge's
door early in the morning and
waking her up — are a tradition
for some sororities.
