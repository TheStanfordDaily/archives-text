# Cowell helps those coping with stress

### Julie Cantor 
You have two midterms, a 15-
page paper, three meetings at the
same time, overdue books,
bounced checks and a summer
internship deadline that just
passed.
For people who regularly face
stressful situations like this, a
group of students created the
Stress Resource Center at Cowell
Student Health Center last fall.
About two to three students
now visit the stress center every
night to get information, learn
massage techniques or just relax,
staff members said.
The center is part of a program
designed to provide human biolo
gy and psychology students with
internships and other opportuni
ties for stress research at Cowell.
The program was started in fall
quarter of 1988 by Alejandro Mar
tinez, director of Counseling and
Psychological Services.

The center is run "by students,
for students ... to help stressed
people," said junior Pam Nord
strom, the project's coordinator.
"Mostly, it's for people who
need a place to let go of their wor
ries ... in quiet," she said.
Located on the second floor of
Cowell, the center features soft
couches and lighting which are
intended to provide a comfortable
atmosphere for relaxation, staff
members said. Tapes of soothing
music and various self-help books,
such as "14,000 Things To Be
Happy About," line the shelves.
Senior Jill Kuehnle, one of four
staff members, said the stress cen
ter aims to teach students how to
relieve tension and "guide people
so they can help themselves." The
resource materials focus on pre
venting stress-related problems
because "knowing what to do
about things before they happen"
is essential, she added.
