### June Cohen Mara Winokur Editorial staff 
If is said that college to caffeine.
We disagree. ** v * j _
As Daily editors, we occupy posiflbns of immense
responsibility. We are constantly under intense stress
and prd&ure and we rarely get more than four hours
of sleep * night. Sure, we indulge in a cup of cop s

We cln quit whenever weVant. X
So it was purely out of ouimiuty to inform you, ih
our faithful Intermission readers, we decided

Freshman year, Qj — we- were
new here and fraflfcrnity parties

Everyone in our freshman dorms
would go, get drunk together, flail
their arms and legs wildly in the
