# Discovering the meaning of life... upstairs in Tresidder?
## 
### 
Well, seems there's been a big BIG BIG
reaction to my last column. Sorry if
my comments got under the thick
skin of any literate lifters out there, but what
can I say? I column as I see 'em.
Today, however, I was going to consider a
more profound topic: The Meaning of Life. You
know: why were we born, is our destiny,
does Tiny Tim have a point and all that. Alas,
due to space restrictions, we must limit our
inquiry, stripping away all the nonessentials
until we are left with only the core question.
Yes, my friends, today we shall search for ...
The Meaning of TVesidder.
What is The Meaning of TVesidder? I ponder
this thought as I step inside, glancing at the
pizza counter. Nope, no Meaning here. Only
grease. Tresidder's pizza is one of the few in the
country that's priced by the gallon.
I search for, but fail to find Meaning as I
walk through the glamorous new section of the
first floor, fashionably decorated in the TVesid
der spirit of "ring out the old, and while you're
at it, wring out the pizza."
I step outside, and wonder where to look
next. The Store or the Coffee House? TVesidder
Express or TVesidder Espresso?
Hey, coffee generation. That's me. I walk
past the "Sprockets" extras sitting at the picnic
table by the elevator, and enter.
As I step inside, half the Coffee House looks
up at me to see if I'm whoever they're supposed
to meet. Each person raises their eyebrows,
gives a pouting look, and quickly looks back
down again.
TVy it. It happens.
I order a sandwich, and receive a master

piece with just about every garnish and topping
piled on: pickles (yeah!), sprouts (yech!), even
an avocado.
Who says The Stanford Deli isn't liberal?
I'd like to stay longer, and just stare at this
piece of art, but I'm getting sick of hearing
"Hot Rocks." Some big weirdo computer sci-

down again. Try it. It happens.

ence graduate student just sat down at my
table, and I feel out of place sipping this lemon
Hi-C. There's no Meaning here either. I sneak
out the back, give a nod to Dieter at the picnic
table, and decide to try the second floor.
Lo and behold, as I step out of the elevator,
my heart begins to flutter. My legs tremble as
they move me down the walkway. As I turn the
i corner, I am nearly in tears. I fall to my knees,
I lift my hands to the air and praise the heavens,
, for I know I have found the true Meaning of
; TVesidder.
By golly, it's our glorious ASSU
Most people, when asked what the ASSU
■ means to them, have only a narrow idea of its

duties. The typical student response: M Uh,
Refunds... Lecture Notes... Hmm. Did I say
Refunds? And, oh yes, representing the entire
student body opinion on world issues and
events."
And why shouldn't the ASSU represent my
beliefs? After all, the political leanings of candi

dates played such an influential role over my
vote last year. ("Levi? What a silly name — I
gotta vote for him!")
But this ignorance on the students' part is
too bad. The ASSU is a veritable gateway to
another world, just brimming over with won
derful opportunities:
ASSU Legal Counseling: These guys will
carefully listen to whatever problem you have,
analyze your situation, and finally, after much
deliberation, reach the startling recommenda
tion that "Yes, you do need a lawyer." Thanks.
Fortunately, they have a handy-dandy list of
people to recommend. Sort of an attorney's
equivalent of 1-800-DENTIST.

ASSU Speakers' Bureau: Responsible for
' trying to get such important, influential speak
ers to talk here. Sure, you may wonder where
1 they dig up some of their more obscure choices
(Speakers' Burrow, maybe?), but let's face it —
getting Gorby was a coup.
ASSU Culture Fest: A bacteriologist's
dream come true.
ASSU Fester Cult: An "Adams Family"
addict's dream come true.
ASSU Dry Cleaning: Dried up, cleaned out.
Fortunately, a replacement drain on our funds
is in the works. Some current ideas, based on
other, tried-and-true ASSU businesses:
ASSU Sundae Flecks: Designed in response
to the all-too-often heard complaint that
"Stanford just really doesn't have a good place
for chocolate jimmies."
ASSU "Beat the Bursars" sale: Ever taken a
class you didn't need to? Sell back unwanted
units for premium prices! Need one more class
to graduate? Pick up those final credits for a
fraction of another quarter's tuition!
This replaces the less successful ASSU "Beat
the Post Office" sale, which folded after the
Council of Presidents realized everyone was
selling back his/her used stamps, but no one
was buying.
ASSU Even Dumber T-Shirt Shop:
Thought that "Farm Fresh" and "Get your BA
at Stanford" were too funny to buy? Well, the
ASSU has thousands of previously rejected
designs just waiting to happen:
"Stanford: the Stanford of the West"
"NICHOLSON at Stanford" (Commemora
tive)
"STANFORD: We still think the Simpsons

arc trendy"
"Don't ask me nuttin'. I just skateboard
here."
"STANFORD" (Blue and Gold lettering)
"Stanford Mens Basketball: OK, once every
49 years ..
"Thank God for Stanford!" (complete with
dorky-looking photo of campus)
ASSU AlRport Shuttle: Meet where the old
Dry Cleaning Office was; get a ride to the com
puter cluster. Five bucks: Cheap! (Only three
disks per person, please).
Yes, my quest is indeed complete.
Down the stairs I climb, relieved that The
Meaning of Tresidder has finally been discov
ered. I frolic through White Plaza, so excited I
kiss the guy handing out those little green
bibles. "ASSU! ASSU! ASSU!" Over and over
I'm repeating my discovery.
Either that, or I just caught a cold.

Chris is kinda ticked that he couldn't squeeze in
his "/ don't TYesidder any farther than J can
throw her" joke. He is currently accepting dona
tions to the "Get Joel Stein a Haircut" charity
fund.
