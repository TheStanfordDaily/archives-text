Coffee.
A whole issue about coffee.
Brought to you by people who should know.
Finally, an opportunity to utilize everything we really learned at the
Daily. This issue has great personal significance to both of us, signifying
the culmination of years of experience and fact-finding.
How exciting.
How absurb.
Anyway, most of our "Intermission Innovations" — the changes we've
tried to enact over these first three weeks as Intermission gurus — are now
in effect. What do you think? How are we doing? Call us and let us know
— the Daily's number is 723-4632 and we're here — a lot. (what, did you
think we'd give you our home phone? No way. Joel Stein tried that, and
he's still getting weird calls from two gals in North Carolina).
Besides — the Daily is home.
And you're invited to come over and play.
Really — we're looking for new, creative minds to work on Intermis
sion (the Daily's "special" section).
You can do all kinds of neat stuff — like sampling ice cream, cafe-hop
ping, bungee-jumping (that's foreshadowing by the way), throwing birth
day parties for your stuffed animals and eating chocolate chip cookies at 4
a.m.
It's fun — really.
Okay, okay, okay, we'll get to the point: The oh-so-exciting things we
would do this week, if we had the time...
First of all, something we might actually get to do: Blues Traveler, the
premier New York City club band, is playing at Slim's tonight at 9. This
blues-y rock band has a jammin' harmonica and great lyrics like "I lied and
told her I loved her — she didn't care, but anyway.. .1 said that we'd still
be friends — she didn't care, but anyway..."
Don't miss it.
Unless you're going to hear Adrienne Rich, the renowned feminist
poet, speak at San Jose State's Music Concert Hall at 8 p.m. Very inspira
tional.
Friday night we would head to the Little Theater to watch the Drama
Department's production of "The Physicists" (see page eight for our
review).
Another theatrical production opening this week is a semi-staged pro
duction of "The Magic Flute." This Mozart opera is being performed in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium. The Department of Music is sponsoring the
show, which will be performed tonight and Friday at 8 p.m. and Sunday at
2:30 p.m. Tickets are $5 for students.
At some point in the next few weeks you should also make a point of
heading into the City for a most amusing exhibition (no, silly, exhibition,
not exhibitionist).
The Cartoon Art Museum in San Francisco is now showing "Humor in
the Jugular Vein; The Art of MAD Magazine", an exhibition celebrating
this standard of satire's 40th anniversary. And it only costs $1.50.
"What, me worry?"
By the way, if you've been kvetching about this column not giving
enough information, just take a glance over to the calendar, where all of
these events are listed with complete information. OKAY?
On Monday a most bizarre event is taking place on campus.
Mary's Danish is playing Kresge.
Yes, the same Kresge you take econ and CEI7O in. The same Kresge you
fall asleep in.
Amazing, but true. Monday night at 8 p.m., Mary's Danish will rock
your worlds in Kresge Auditorium. Tickets are $8.50.
The most important thing for you to do this weekend (besides wishing
Jen Sey a happy birthday) is come to our Intermission Writers Meeting
and Brainstorming Session on Sunday at 3 p.m. Much fun will be had by
all. Don't be left out.
Keep the faith. Use the force. And look both ways before crossing the
Quad.
Later,
