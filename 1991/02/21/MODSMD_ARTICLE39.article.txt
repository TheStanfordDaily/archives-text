# Piano Man
## Economics Prof. John Sutherland Earle moonlights as a concert pianist 
### Julie Makinen 
From Labor Economics to Liszt,
John Sutherland Earle does it all.
In addition to being an assistant
professor of economics at
Stanford, Earle is a well-known
Bay area pianist who has
performed extensively both in the
United States and abroad.

Earle, the recipient of many local, national and interna
tional prizes, including grand prize in the 1988 Carmel
Music Society Piano Competition, will give a benefit con
cert on behalf of the Children's Center of the Stanford Com
munity on Friday, Feb. 22 at 8 p.m. in Kresge Auditorium.
The center provides parent-cooperative day care and family
services for the community.
Intermission caught up with this "Renaissance man"
earlier this week and inquired about his dichotomous (or
not-so-dichotomous) life.
Intermission: How did you enter the music world, and why
not live as a pianist instead of a pianist/economist?
Earle: I grew up enjoying and loving music from a very
early age ... but it didn't occur to me for a long time that
music was something I'd want to spend my life with. Even
though I was taking piano, trombone, cello and bagpipe
lessons, I was involved in a lot of other things, too.
I grew up in an out of the way place — Baton Rouge, La.
— and there wasn't a very encouraging musical climate
there. Sunday mornings were very special, because those
were the only times when one station played classical music
on the radio. I didn't have the advantage, or disadvantage,
of growing up, say, in New York City and I never even con
sidered the possibility until I was a teenager.
I: You've studied piano, cello, bagpipe and trombone —
why did you pursue piano to the greatest extent?
E: The different thing about the piano is that it's something
you can really do very satisfyingly by yourself. The solo
piano repertoire is just enormous, and it's so full of master
pieces and diverse works that it's just a world unto itself.
You can't really say the same for the trombone. When they
wanted me to march in the marching band, that's when I
decided that I had had enough of the trombone.
I: So how did a cellist/pianist/trombonist/bagpipe player
come to be interested in economics?
E: I was always interested in social problems, social studies.
My parents were very active in the civil rights movement in
the '60s, and they were people with social conscience.
I certainly didn't go to college with the intention of
studying economics — I don't know that anybody does —
but it was just one of those 'random decisions'; I took an
economics class my sophomore year and I found it fascinat
ing. What was interesting to me was that it was a way to
really talk about the things I was interested in ... policy
problems, social problems It was an analytical frame
work in which I could try to answer some questions that I
really cared about,... current events, poverty, etc..

I: Does that social consciousness tie into your musical inter
ests in the form of benefit concerts, such as your upcoming
one for the Children's Center?
E: I would say these two different strands — economics and
music — rarely come together, but this is certainly an inter
esting example of where they do, if in somewhat of an
oblique way.
The Children's Center is a cause I believe in. I especially
like the cooperative aspect of this day care program.
Although I don't have children myself, several of my col
leagues and friends use the center, and it allows them to lead
flexible lives by providing quality care for their children.
I: Music and economics have taken you many places —
California, Ohio and from what I hear, Europe and...?
E: I received degrees in economics and music from Oberlin
College in Ohio, and then came to Stanford for graduate
study in economics. After that, I worked in Washington,

D.C. for the Council of Economic Advisors.
Later, I traveled to India, where I encountered very little
piano. I returned to the United States longing to play, and I
began to pursue it very seriously. I spent the next two years
doing a lot of piano, and sporadically, economics. Eventu
ally I specialized in labor economics and finished my disser
tation [at Stanford].
The last two years, I've spent a lot of time in Vienna —
I've taken maybe six trips there in the last couple of years —
studying, playing chamber music with various groups and
giving solo performances throughout Europe. Originally I
went to Vienna on a Fulbright scholarship.
I: What are your feelings on competitions? You've certainly
been involved in a few.
E: I entered several major competitions, and I've traveled to
Moscow twice for the Tchaikovsky competition. I've won
some 'medium' competitions, but there's an age limit to
many of these competitions — often it's 32 — and I just
turned 32, so I'm doing a lot of chamber work now in addi

tion to my solo work.
Of course, solo competition is very different from solo
performance. There is certainly a draw to solo performance;
there's nothing like being out there by yourself. Having
hundreds of people just listening to one person doing it all,
it's amazing.

You can think of piano com
petitions as an economic
problem: there are very few
jobs auaiiable to people who
want to be performing con
cert pianists. One way to
determine who gets these
jobs is through competi
tions. It would be nice to
work on the demand side of
the problem rather than the
supply.
John Eorle

When I'm playing for an audience, I feel that the audi
ence is on my side and I am communicating with them.
There's a great sense of antagonism in competitions, and
the atmosphere is poisoned by the comparisons that are
going on.
I: Does this mean that you don't think competitions are a
good thing? Perhaps they are a necessary evil?
E: You can think of it as an economic problem: There are
very few jobs available to people who want to be performing
concert pianists. Thousands of people are competing for
maybe 20 jobs. One way to determine who gets these jobs is
through competitions. It would be nice to work on the
demand side of the problem rather than the supply.
I: At Stanford, there are many people who have an interest
in something rather economic as well as something 'artsy,'
such as music or drama. What is your advice to these peo
ple?
E: I don't know if I would advise others to do what I've
done. Often it's a strain; last night I was up until 3 a.m.
grading midterms and I have to play a concert tonight, so
that's not the best situation. However, for me, it's really nec
essary to have both kinds of stimulation.
It's unfortunate that some people feel limited to one
thing just because so few people try to do more than one
thing. It's not impossible. It's hard not to make the 'easy
decision' down one of the beaten tracks, and there are sac
rifices by people who try to pursue several interests. But
there's one thing about my life, and that is that there's no
one I want to exchange it with.

I: Music and economics have taken you many places —
California, Ohio and from what I hear, Europe and...?
E: I received degrees in economics and music from Oberlin
College in Ohio, and then came to Stanford for graduate
study in economics. After that, I worked in Washington,

D.C. for the Council of Economic Advisors.
Later, I traveled to India, where I encountered very little
piano. I returned to the United States longing to play, and I
began to pursue it very seriously. I spent the next two years
doing a lot of piano, and sporadically, economics. Eventu
ally I specialized in labor economics and finished my disser
tation [at Stanford].
The last two years, I've spent a lot of time in Vienna —
I've taken maybe six trips there in the last couple of years —
studying, playing chamber music with various groups and
giving solo performances throughout Europe. Originally I
went to Vienna on a Fulbright scholarship.
I: What are your feelings on competitions? You've certainly
been involved in a few.
E: I entered several major competitions, and I've traveled to
Moscow twice for the Tchaikovsky competition. I've won
some 'medium' competitions, but there's an age limit to
many of these competitions — often it's 32 — and I just
turned 32, so I'm doing a lot of chamber work now in addi

tion to my solo work.
Of course, solo competition is very different from solo
performance. There is certainly a draw to solo performance;
there's nothing like being out there by yourself. Having
hundreds of people just listening to one person doing it all,
it's amazing.

You can think of piano com
petitions as an economic
problem: there are very few
jobs auaiiable to people who
want to be performing con
cert pianists. One way to
determine who gets these
jobs is through competi
tions. It would be nice to
work on the demand side of
the problem rather than the
supply.
John Eorle

When I'm playing for an audience, I feel that the audi
ence is on my side and I am communicating with them.
There's a great sense of antagonism in competitions, and
the atmosphere is poisoned by the comparisons that are
going on.
I: Does this mean that you don't think competitions are a
good thing? Perhaps they are a necessary evil?
E: You can think of it as an economic problem: There are
very few jobs available to people who want to be performing
concert pianists. Thousands of people are competing for
maybe 20 jobs. One way to determine who gets these jobs is
through competitions. It would be nice to work on the
demand side of the problem rather than the supply.
I: At Stanford, there are many people who have an interest
in something rather economic as well as something 'artsy,'
such as music or drama. What is your advice to these peo
ple?
E: I don't know if I would advise others to do what I've
done. Often it's a strain; last night I was up until 3 a.m.
grading midterms and I have to play a concert tonight, so
that's not the best situation. However, for me, it's really nec
essary to have both kinds of stimulation.
It's unfortunate that some people feel limited to one
thing just because so few people try to do more than one
thing. It's not impossible. It's hard not to make the 'easy
decision' down one of the beaten tracks, and there are sac
rifices by people who try to pursue several interests. But
there's one thing about my life, and that is that there's no
one I want to exchange it with.

From Labor Economics to Liszt,
John Sutherland Earle does it all.
In addition to being an assistant
professor of economics at
Stanford, Earle is a well-known
Bay area pianist who has
performed extensively both in the
United States and abroad.

Earle, the recipient of many local, national and interna
tional prizes, including grand prize in the 1988 Carmel
Music Society Piano Competition, will give a benefit con
cert on behalf of the Children's Center of the Stanford Com
munity on Friday, Feb. 22 at 8 p.m. in Kresge Auditorium.
The center provides parent-cooperative day care and family
services for the community.
Intermission caught up with this "Renaissance man"
earlier this week and inquired about his dichotomous (or
not-so-dichotomous) life.
Intermission: How did you enter the music world, and why
not live as a pianist instead of a pianist/economist?
Earle: I grew up enjoying and loving music from a very
early age ... but it didn't occur to me for a long time that
music was something I'd want to spend my life with. Even
though I was taking piano, trombone, cello and bagpipe
lessons, I was involved in a lot of other things, too.
I grew up in an out of the way place — Baton Rouge, La.
— and there wasn't a very encouraging musical climate
there. Sunday mornings were very special, because those
were the only times when one station played classical music
on the radio. I didn't have the advantage, or disadvantage,
of growing up, say, in New York City and I never even con
sidered the possibility until I was a teenager.
I: You've studied piano, cello, bagpipe and trombone —
why did you pursue piano to the greatest extent?
E: The different thing about the piano is that it's something
you can really do very satisfyingly by yourself. The solo
piano repertoire is just enormous, and it's so full of master
pieces and diverse works that it's just a world unto itself.
You can't really say the same for the trombone. When they
wanted me to march in the marching band, that's when I
decided that I had had enough of the trombone.
I: So how did a cellist/pianist/trombonist/bagpipe player
come to be interested in economics?
E: I was always interested in social problems, social studies.
My parents were very active in the civil rights movement in
the '60s, and they were people with social conscience.
I certainly didn't go to college with the intention of
studying economics — I don't know that anybody does —
but it was just one of those 'random decisions'; I took an
economics class my sophomore year and I found it fascinat
ing. What was interesting to me was that it was a way to
really talk about the things I was interested in ... policy
problems, social problems It was an analytical frame
work in which I could try to answer some questions that I
really cared about,... current events, poverty, etc..

I: Does that social consciousness tie into your musical inter
ests in the form of benefit concerts, such as your upcoming
one for the Children's Center?
E: I would say these two different strands — economics and
music — rarely come together, but this is certainly an inter
esting example of where they do, if in somewhat of an
oblique way.
The Children's Center is a cause I believe in. I especially
like the cooperative aspect of this day care program.
Although I don't have children myself, several of my col
leagues and friends use the center, and it allows them to lead
flexible lives by providing quality care for their children.
