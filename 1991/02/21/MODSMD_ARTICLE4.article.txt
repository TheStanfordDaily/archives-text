# Audit agency: Eliminate agreements
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
A second federal agency has recom
mended that the government eliminate
dozens of indirect-cost accounting agree
ments with Stanford.
In a Feb. 13 letter obtained by The
Daily, Joseph Riden, an official from the
Defense Contract Audit Agency, writes,
"We recommend that all memoranda of
understanding between Stanford Uni
versity and the government affecting
cost recovery be terminated."
The agreements, the letter states,
"are substantially noncompliant" with

federal rules and "are not considered to
be in the government's interests."
The letter from the auditing agency is
addressed to John Ford, who heads a
negotiating team from the Office of
Naval Research. The naval office is
responsible for monitoring the Univer
sity's research costs and is currently
reviewing all the memoranda of under
standing that have been signed with
Stanford during the last decade.
Ford received a similar letter last
week from the Department of Health
and Human Services, an agency which
plays an oversight role similar to
that of the Office of Naval
Research at other universities.
The opinions of the two agen
cies are considered advisory.
While their views are likely to
toughen the Navy's negotiating
posture, it is not clear that the
recommendations will have any
other immediate effect.
If the advice of the two agen

cies is adopted, however, the
financial effect on Stanford could
be devastating.
The Defense Contract Audit
Agency estimates that the memo
randa of understanding have
added 15 points to Stanford's
indirect cost rate, which currently
sits at 70 percent. Eliminating
the memoranda of understanding
would cost the University nearly
$19 million a year in the future.
Paul Biddle, the resident repre
sentative of the Office of Naval
Research, is also pushing for the
elimination of the agreements.

Biddle, a member of the Navy's
negotiating team, contends that
Ford, the head of the team, is
being too easy on the University.
In December the two parties
agreed that the memoranda of
understanding would remain
valid at least until the end of a
review process scheduled for com
pletion April 1.
Biddle has argued that the
agreements should have been
eliminated and only reinstated if
Stanford could provide adequate
justification for them.
Ford has declined to comment

on the issue.
A Navy report released earlier
this month found that many of
the agreements now under review
had not been properly audited or
reviewed by higher-ranking
Office of Naval Research officials.
The exact number of memo
randa of understanding between
Stanford and the government is a
matter of dispute, but both par
ties say the number is close to
100. No other research university
monitored by the Office of Naval
Research has more than eight
such agreements.
