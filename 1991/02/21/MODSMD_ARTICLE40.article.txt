Cafes are by
far the most
underutilized
resource available
to Stanford
students.

Whether you like coffee or not,
cafeing (a new verb) is an ideal way to
blow off an afternoon or evening, as
well as an effective means of getting
work done. Depending on your mood.
Unlike the Coffee House in Tresid
der, where it is impossible for even the
least social among us to study, cafes in
the area offer a slightly more isolated
location where you can actually get
work done.
If you want.
And being a coffee lover isn't a pre
requisite for cafeing.
Don't get us wrong, it helps to like
coffee. But it isn't necessary.
Personally, we're divided: one of us
being a stoic, bare-bones "I take it
black" kind of gal, the other coming
from an "I really like those sweet
chocolate-y drinks" approach.
But both of us have a deeply
ingrained love — no, need — for
dessert, so we can give you a pretty
good perspective on what individual
cafes have to offer.
So here they are. The best of the
cafes we sampled in the area. Not an
exhaustive list by any means: merely a
starting point for those of you who
share our sentiments ...
Cafe Barrone is our overall favorite
among local cafes for several reasons,

including its versatility (great for
studying or hangin'), its location (next
door to Kepler's Bookstore), the hot
jazz played there at night and what
may possibly be the world's best whole
wheat scones (with or without rasp
berry preserves on the side).
The only drawback of Cafe Barrone
is that too many people know how
good it is.
On weekends (especially around
brunch time) the place is bustling, and
you can stand on line for half an hour
before getting served. But despite the
wait, and the pricey items, its worth it.
Cafe Barrone is located at 1010 El
Camino Real in Menlo Park (next door
to Kepler's). The weekday hours are 7
a.m. to 11 p.m. (midnight on Fridays).
On weekends, it opens at 9 a.m., closing
at 12 p.m. on Saturday and 5 p.m. on
Sunday.
Despite its Palo Alto location, Cafe
Verona offers its patrons a setting and
atmosphere which is decidedly Euro
pean, or at least more so than most
local cafes.
With its green marble table-tops,
walls adorned with Italian pho
tographs and French posters and wait
resses with European accents, Cafe
Verona offers a bit of escapism for
those who feel confined in the sub
urbs.

Although Verona is a fine place to
read during the day, it's a perfect place
just to sit with a friend or two, savoring
a cup of cafe mocha (the best around,
in our book) and talking about —
whatever.
You can even do some people
watching there, as the clientele is
decidedly more interesting than that of
many local cafes (Verona seems to
attract many Europeans, judging by
the accents of those around our table)
As for nourishment (as if mocha
weren't enough) rich, indulgent
desserts abound and a side counter
also offers great-looking salads, sand
wiches and pasta dishes for $4.50-
$6.95. Watch out for the beer, the least
expensive they offer costs $2.75.
Cafe Verona is located at 236
Hamilton Street in Palo Alto. Store
hours are 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. weekdays
(closing at midnight on Friday), 8:30
a.m. to midnight on Saturday and 8:30
a.m. to 5 p.m. on Sunday.
The Red Rock Coffee Company is
something of a mecca for coffee enthu
siasts. The store's multiple shelves and
display racks are filled with coffee and
tea paraphernalia: coffee makers, tea
pots and endless ceramic mugs: from
dainty espresso cups with three inch
saucers to huge oversized mugs that

hold enough coffee to satiate even the
most harried Daily editor.
The atmosphere (in the afternoon
anyway) is light and lazy.
Paintings by local artists adorn the
walls of the narrow shop, and brows
ing material aplenty can be found scat
tered on the tables and counters. One
could easily pass (not waste, but pass)
hours sitting at a table sipping the Red
Rock's strong coffee and reading.
We didn't sample any espresso
drinks, but the coffee was very strong
and flavorful. Skip the poppyseed cake,
which was OK tasting, but ice cold (it's
exactly like the pre-sliced variety we
buy in the Poli Sci Cafe).
Opt for the chocolate chip cookies,
which were big and chewy or one of
the exotic sounding muffins — like
pumpkin-blueberry — instead.
The Red Rock Coffee Company is
located on the newly revamped Castro
Street in Mountain View.
The Prolific Oven does not offer
the most stimulating or suave atmo
sphere, but it is an excellent place to sit
down, spread out and do problem sets
for a few hours (day or night).
One of the best things about this
bakery/cafe, in fact, is that it offers any
poor soul forced to study on a week
end night an alternative to geekdom.

Instead of feeling nerdy in the library,
studyhounds can appear intellectual
and inspired sitting at the sturdy wood
tables, glasses perched intelligently on
their noses, catching glimpses of them
selves in the mirrors lining the room.
The Prolific Oven's coffee is strong
and the carrot cake with cream cheese
topping is definitely inspirational, as is
the chocolate cake, the biscotti and the
muffins; however, the lemon poppy
seed cake is somewhat disappointing.
The Prolific Oven is located at 550
Waverly Street in Palo Alto. The store
opens at 7:30 a.m. weekdays, closing at
7 p.m. on Monday, 10 p.m. Tuesday
thru Thursday and midnight on Friday.
On weekends, the store opens at 8:30
a.m., closing at midnight on Saturday
and 5 p.m. on Sunday.
Printer's Inc. is a bookstore and
cafe in one — what a fantastic concept.
With two nearby locations, you
really have no excuse for missing both
of the Printer's Inc. stores. If you love
books (other than the ones you have to
read) and you love coffee, or if you just
like sitting around, passing lazy hours
reading or talking to friends, this store
is essential to your existence.
The Mountain View location boasts
hot food during the week, although
when we visited on the weekend, the
only real food we could find was
microwaved pizza puffs which weren't
particularly impressive.
The coffee is good at both loca
tions, though, and many desserts
looked great. But we were too full to
eat anymore at this point, so we passed
them up and just sat awhile.
Printer's Inc. is located at 310 Cali
fornia Ave in Palo Alto and 301 Castro
St.in Mountain View. Both stores are
open from 10 a.m. to 11 p.m. weekdays
and 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. on weekends.
Saint Michael's Alley is the only
cafe we visited which offered a depar
ture from the usual.
Most of the cafes fit a certain
slightly trendy image, and were fre
quented by successful looking, main
stream yuppies; Saint Michael's Alley,
however, has a more underground,
counter-culture feel to it.
Although we visited the cafe during
the day, when it was relatively quiet
and peaceful, we've heard the place
rocks at night with live music played
from the tiny stage at one end of the
room.
Although the coffee and Mocchac
cino we tried were excellent, the scone
and coffee cake weren't particularly
impressive. But we won't condemn all
the food, some of the other bakery
items looked even better — it was just
too early in the morning to eat real
cake (you wouldn't think it was possi
ble, huh?).
Enter through the side street door,
the front door is for the restaurant.
Saint Michael's Alley is located at
800 Emerson St.in Palo Alto. Store
hours are 7 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. Sunday
thru Thursday and 7 a.m to 11 p.m.
Saturday and Sunday.
