# The 						Quest For Coffee

1. The Coffee House
The Coffee House provides the
best cup of coffee on campus
and is also the optimal place for
people watching. While Coffee
House Blend is a tasty mainstay,
each day brings alternate flavors.
But beware of the Chocolate
Raspberry.
2. Law School Cafe
Plush, comfortable couches for
Romanesque lounging and an
outdoor patio earn this place the
distinction of "Stanford cafe
most resembling an Italian
resort."
3. Rains Coffee House
The place actually looks more
like a snack bar, but since snack
bars aren't too chic these days,
go ahead and call it a coffee
house. The coffee is good; the
service is friendly.
4. Education Cafe
Versatile Cashiers watch and
debate Oprah Winfrey while
taking your money for coffee.
Emerald Cream is a novel offer
ing and, like a true treasure, it is
a bit difficult to find.
5. Cafe Jr.
The new Bookstore cafe serves
fine coffee, as well as espresso.
At 75 cents a cup, the coffee is
pricey in comparison with other
campus cafes. Extra-friendly
service ("Did you enjoy that?
May I take your cup? Can I get
you something to read?") and
the novelty of drinking coffee in
the Bookstore almost make up
for it.
6. Tresidder
This high-profile setting always
features four flavors â€” includ
ing the popular vanilla nut.
7. Nuts and Mud
Terman engineering cafe offers
sleak name, efficient service, and
potable coffee.
8. Poli Sci Cafe
Often provides Columbia and
French Roast. The coffee is
watery, but worth it if you have
the Stanford directory coupon
for a free large cup of coffee.
9. Business School Cafe
The perfect place to meet people
and strike up profit margin on a
cup of java. The coffee, however,
is not particularly good.
10. Food Service
Blech. It's free, though.
