# It Happened One Night
## A 						scene from the Coffee House 
### Amy Gillett 
The Scene: The Coffee House
The Time: 9 p.m. on a Wednesday
The Weather Outside: 55° and
damp
The Temperature Inside: 90° with
dense sweat clouds and an occa
sional mocha-scented breeze
Patron 1 (wearing round, tortoise shell glasses): Private
war cannot exist between men in the state of nature!
Patron 2 (in black mock turtleneck): I disagree! In this
instance, I find Rousseau's logic entirely faulty! Now, if we
examine this question from a Marxist perspective ...
Have the comingling aromas of Coffee House Blend and
Vanilla Nut gone straight to their heads? What else could
have stimulated these CoHo patrons to philosphize so
loudly that, even if four coffee pots and two capuccino mak
ers were to come tumbling from their respective counters,
the booming of ROUSSEAU would drown out the crash?
However, nobody around can spare an ear to snoop on
their conversation. People have their own business to attend
to.
As the clock tower chimes twelve times,
the Coffee House cashier who was so
friendly to each of his patrons just hours
ago, has now become the enemy. 'Closing
time, everyone outV the killjoy
announces.
Amid the shouts of "Foucalt did not say that!" "To heck
with Rousseau!" and "Pass the pitcher!" the sound of
"Nothing Compares To You" slowly builds in the back
ground.
Near the juke box sits a co-ed group of beer drinkers.
"Oh, Cool. I haven't heard this song in like so long," says
a woman, who begins swinging her arms and shaking her
torso to the beat until she remembers that it's not cool to
dance in the Coffee House.
"You're so stoked!" replies a woman with a few ancient
letters embroidered on her pink sweater. After taking a
dainty sip from her glass, she looks at the beer in disgust.
"Why didn't I get a cafe au lait?" she is undoubtedly asking
herself. "It would have gone so much better with this bis
cotti I am nibbling on," continues her (probable) thought
process.
Does this table represent a mini-fraternity-sorority
mixer? Very possibly, as it is Wednesday night — a favorite
night for some Greek societies to take a break from other
activities and relax over a pitcher of beer. At the CoHo
though?
To be sure. The CoHo of 1991 is a place for everyone.
The CoHo's ban on smoking has helped make the place
more attractive to Stanford students at large. The "smoke
free" policy has purged the carcinogen cloud that once hov
ered over the coffee house and left all its patrons with the
lingering scent of Marlboro Man.
A football player mannequin, that has recently made his
debut on a rafter above the cashiers, represents a further
divergence from the old CoHo image. It adds a touch of
Stanford Track House to the place, and along with the
smoking ban, may account for the recent influx of athletes
into the coffee haven.
Behind the Greek gathering sits a lone student with four
fat engineering books. He's gnawing on his thumb, tapping
his pencil on his book, squinting his eyes. Not even in the
bowels of Green Library does one encounter a student
exerting such effort to learn!
Perhaps he has to concentrate extra-hard to blockade all
the assaults on his senses. His ears must muffle the sound of
chewers and gulpers and chatters, his hands must resist the

desire to drop his pencil and run to the juke box to stroke
all of its newly manufactured buttons.
His eyes must fight the urge to wander from the vectors
of his textbook onto the person who is sitting nearby
discussing her participation in the Condom Rating Contest.
How can he be expected to study here?
He suddenly taps his pencil hard so on his book, he
bores a hole through several chapters. Conquering aca
demic material in the Coffee House is not easy, but many
academic warriors engage in the battle.
At the table next to the engineer, a white-haired woman
addresses her crony: "Did you know the bookstore has
installed bathrooms?"
"Yes, it's such a joy to shop there now! You can have cof
fee at the new cafe on the second floor, then there's the
lovely bathroom downstairs."
These are CoHo tourists. Simply stopping through to
have a cup of coffee, they are unaware that they have
become part of a "scene." They drink out of styrofoam cups
because SEAS has not informed them of the need to carry
around a blue plastic mug.
"This is so much cooterihan my high school snackbar!"
exclaims a young man in a Stanford T-shirt and Stanford
baseball cap, seated near the tourists.
"It's great. Too bad I don't drink coffee though." replies
his friend.
These are clearly freshmen who have just discovered that
their campus has its very own coffee house. What a place!
Soon it will be time for them to write term papers. And
they will discover that coffee isn't really as gross as they had
originally thought.
Bouncing by these CoHo rookies, a young woman with
a tail halts before a small round table. Is she a rabbit? No,
she is simply bouncing because she has had too many coffee
refills. Upon closer inspection, her tail turns out to be a blue
mug, dangling from a cord on her backpack.
Standing before a woman reading a newspaper, she
exclaims "Meg, you're drinking out of a SEAS mug! I didn't
know you were p.c!"
Meg looks up from her paper, "Actually, Susan, I only
became politically correct so I could save money on coffee
by using my own mug!"
"Oh," replies a disappointed, anti-styrofoam Susan. She
lingers for a minute, perhaps debating whether to remind
Meg to recycle her newspaper, then moves on.
But Susan has not escaped the eye of a man carrying

around a three-day accumulation of food in his half-beard.
Sitting at the next table, with a book opened before him, the
leerer has been alternating his attention between Susan and
his text for the past five minutes.
What does he want? Will he talk to her? Will he ask her
to join him for a coffee refill?? Will he flash her???
None of the above. He will just continue glaring, staring
and wearing a psychotic smile.
'Oh, Cool I haven t heard this song
in like so long.' says a woman, who
begins swinging her arms and shak
ing her torso to the beat until she
remembers that it's not cool to
dance in the Coffee House.
Susan doesn't take much notice. As a coffee house regu
lar, she's grown immune to lecherous stares.
"It's Yer Move!" booms throughout the Coffee House. Is
this a voice from above counseling Susan to sit next to the
leerer?
While a novice CoHo goer might assume so, regulars
know that the voice is emanating from the Soviet Chess
Player's table by the back door. There, da's and nyet's mingle
with the sand neins and oui's and new's from other foreign
speakers to create that international, Tower of Babel ele
ment to the Coffee House.
The CoHo prattle is slowly winding down. A pall sets in.
The temperature cools, the sweat clouds recede.
Suddenly, lights begin flashing on and off. Most people
ignore it, perhaps reassuring themselves that it's just an
electrical short created from frothing too much milk.
All around these remnant patrons, chairs are being piled
upside down on tables. As the clock tower rings twelve
times, the Coffee House cashier who was so friendly to each
of his patrons just hours ago, has now become the enemy.
"Closing time, everyone out!" the killjoy announces. The
CoHo remnants can no longer fool themselves — their
beloved hang-out is clearly closing.
Barring natural disaster, tomorrow will be another day
at the Coffee House, and a slightly different combination of
patrons will create the scene.

Amid the shouts of "Foucalt did not say that!" "To heck
with Rousseau!" and "Pass the pitcher!" the sound of
"Nothing Compares To You" slowly builds in the back
ground.
Near the juke box sits a co-ed group of beer drinkers.
"Oh, Cool. I haven't heard this song in like so long," says
a woman, who begins swinging her arms and shaking her
torso to the beat until she remembers that it's not cool to
dance in the Coffee House.
"You're so stoked!" replies a woman with a few ancient
letters embroidered on her pink sweater. After taking a
dainty sip from her glass, she looks at the beer in disgust.
"Why didn't I get a cafe au lait?" she is undoubtedly asking
herself. "It would have gone so much better with this bis
cotti I am nibbling on," continues her (probable) thought
process.
Does this table represent a mini-fraternity-sorority
mixer? Very possibly, as it is Wednesday night — a favorite
night for some Greek societies to take a break from other
activities and relax over a pitcher of beer. At the CoHo
though?
To be sure. The CoHo of 1991 is a place for everyone.
The CoHo's ban on smoking has helped make the place
more attractive to Stanford students at large. The "smoke
free" policy has purged the carcinogen cloud that once hov
ered over the coffee house and left all its patrons with the
lingering scent of Marlboro Man.
A football player mannequin, that has recently made his
debut on a rafter above the cashiers, represents a further
divergence from the old CoHo image. It adds a touch of
Stanford Track House to the place, and along with the
smoking ban, may account for the recent influx of athletes
into the coffee haven.
Behind the Greek gathering sits a lone student with four
fat engineering books. He's gnawing on his thumb, tapping
his pencil on his book, squinting his eyes. Not even in the
bowels of Green Library does one encounter a student
exerting such effort to learn!
Perhaps he has to concentrate extra-hard to blockade all
the assaults on his senses. His ears must muffle the sound of
chewers and gulpers and chatters, his hands must resist the

desire to drop his pencil and run to the juke box to stroke
all of its newly manufactured buttons.
His eyes must fight the urge to wander from the vectors
of his textbook onto the person who is sitting nearby
discussing her participation in the Condom Rating Contest.
How can he be expected to study here?
He suddenly taps his pencil hard so on his book, he
bores a hole through several chapters. Conquering aca
demic material in the Coffee House is not easy, but many
academic warriors engage in the battle.
At the table next to the engineer, a white-haired woman
addresses her crony: "Did you know the bookstore has
installed bathrooms?"
"Yes, it's such a joy to shop there now! You can have cof
fee at the new cafe on the second floor, then there's the
lovely bathroom downstairs."
These are CoHo tourists. Simply stopping through to
have a cup of coffee, they are unaware that they have
become part of a "scene." They drink out of styrofoam cups
because SEAS has not informed them of the need to carry
around a blue plastic mug.
"This is so much cooterihan my high school snackbar!"
exclaims a young man in a Stanford T-shirt and Stanford
baseball cap, seated near the tourists.
"It's great. Too bad I don't drink coffee though." replies
his friend.
These are clearly freshmen who have just discovered that
their campus has its very own coffee house. What a place!
Soon it will be time for them to write term papers. And
they will discover that coffee isn't really as gross as they had
originally thought.
Bouncing by these CoHo rookies, a young woman with
a tail halts before a small round table. Is she a rabbit? No,
she is simply bouncing because she has had too many coffee
refills. Upon closer inspection, her tail turns out to be a blue
mug, dangling from a cord on her backpack.
Standing before a woman reading a newspaper, she
exclaims "Meg, you're drinking out of a SEAS mug! I didn't
know you were p.c!"
Meg looks up from her paper, "Actually, Susan, I only
became politically correct so I could save money on coffee
by using my own mug!"
"Oh," replies a disappointed, anti-styrofoam Susan. She
lingers for a minute, perhaps debating whether to remind
Meg to recycle her newspaper, then moves on.
But Susan has not escaped the eye of a man carrying

around a three-day accumulation of food in his half-beard.
Sitting at the next table, with a book opened before him, the
leerer has been alternating his attention between Susan and
his text for the past five minutes.
What does he want? Will he talk to her? Will he ask her
to join him for a coffee refill?? Will he flash her???
None of the above. He will just continue glaring, staring
and wearing a psychotic smile.
'Oh, Cool I haven t heard this song
in like so long.' says a woman, who
begins swinging her arms and shak
ing her torso to the beat until she
remembers that it's not cool to
dance in the Coffee House.
Susan doesn't take much notice. As a coffee house regu
lar, she's grown immune to lecherous stares.
"It's Yer Move!" booms throughout the Coffee House. Is
this a voice from above counseling Susan to sit next to the
leerer?
While a novice CoHo goer might assume so, regulars
know that the voice is emanating from the Soviet Chess
Player's table by the back door. There, da's and nyet's mingle
with the sand neins and oui's and new's from other foreign
speakers to create that international, Tower of Babel ele
ment to the Coffee House.
The CoHo prattle is slowly winding down. A pall sets in.
The temperature cools, the sweat clouds recede.
Suddenly, lights begin flashing on and off. Most people
ignore it, perhaps reassuring themselves that it's just an
electrical short created from frothing too much milk.
All around these remnant patrons, chairs are being piled
upside down on tables. As the clock tower rings twelve
times, the Coffee House cashier who was so friendly to each
of his patrons just hours ago, has now become the enemy.
"Closing time, everyone out!" the killjoy announces. The
CoHo remnants can no longer fool themselves — their
beloved hang-out is clearly closing.
Barring natural disaster, tomorrow will be another day
at the Coffee House, and a slightly different combination of
patrons will create the scene.

The Scene: The Coffee House
The Time: 9 p.m. on a Wednesday
The Weather Outside: 55° and
damp
The Temperature Inside: 90° with
dense sweat clouds and an occa

Patron 1 (wearing round, tortoise shell glasses): Private
war cannot exist between men in the state of nature!
Patron 2 (in black mock turtleneck): I disagree! In this
instance, I find Rousseau's logic entirely faulty! Now, if we
examine this question from a Marxist perspective ...
Have the comingling aromas of Coffee House Blend and
Vanilla Nut gone straight to their heads? What else could
have stimulated these CoHo patrons to philosphize so
loudly that, even if four coffee pots and two capuccino mak
ers were to come tumbling from their respective counters,
the booming of ROUSSEAU would drown out the crash?
However, nobody around can spare an ear to snoop on
their conversation. People have their own business to attend
to.
