# More music? for your money

Although it arrived several months ago, the Coffee
House jukebox has remained an issue about which most Co
Ho-goers have formulated passionate opinions.
And I mean passionate.
The majority of those I spoke with held either entirely
positive or negative viewpoints; rarely did I chance upon
someone walking a neutral line.
"It leaves much to be desired," said senior Diana Blank.
"It's most reprehensible. It's of the utmost objectionability."
Anand Adiga expressed his discontent a bit more simply,
"I wish it weren't here.... I guess I'm just here when there
are songs playing that I don't like. Maybe I should just come
to the Coffee House at different times ..."
Hmm. It leads one to wonder if the Coffee House man
agement has a special agenda in mind.
But there are many who herald the jukebox's arrival as a
vast improvement; the former system had Coffee House
employees selecting tapes that were played free of charge.
Dave "Scrappy" Sacks, a junior and a devoted Jimmy
Buffet fan, enjoys the new method of music selection; pre
viously, it bothered him to hear the same tapes over and
over again.
It's not that he particularly dislikes repetition, though.
When asked what selections he'd play if given a dollar, he
replied that all five would have to be Buffet, although he
contended that "by the fifth one, everyone in the place
would probably leave."
One of the ever-present Chess Players, whom I
approached quite timidly, doubting if he even noticed the
music, had a great deal to say. "I think that it's an improve
ment over what the staff selected. We're hearing more Pink
Floyd now, that's nice. And more Frank Sinatra, I like that
too The quality has definitely improved."
One of the anti-jukebox movement's biggest criticisms
concerns the selection of music offered on the jukebox and
played by the patrons.
"I'm really sick of those bozos who play 'Strangers in the
Night' over and over again," stated sophomore Susannah
Jech, a Coffee House employee.
Sacks related one of his friend's commentaries on the sit
uation. "You could make a list of top 20 in the jukebox and
for number 21 to make it onto the list, it would have to be
played about 300 times a day."
This can be truly blunting to the tastes of even the most
discerning music listeners.
"They've ruined 'Brown-Eyed Girl' for me," Kate
Karagueuzian, senior and longtime Coffee House employee,
pointed out sadly.
Another Coffee House employee, Nina Wolgelenter,
seemed downright annoyed with the new machine. "I can't
stand it. You can't tell how many songs are left. It's the same
music over and over again."
"They need more CDs such as Jane's Addiction, Voice of
Harold and Peter Murphy — all these would be fine addi
tions to the repertoire," remarked Mark Geller, a fifth-year
student.
Of course, there is also the issue of money. With the new
jukebox, patrons can play no fewer than five songs, at the
stiff price of one dollar.
"It's lame that we have to pay to hear music," said senior
Seung Bok Choi.
"I wonder how much money they make off that juke
box," added Scott Saul, a senior.
Many have suggested the idea that the machine accept
quarters for fewer selections. This would be difficult to
arrrange, however, since the machine has no coin slot.
Others are concerned with the change in image which the
jukebox brings to the Coffee House. "It's a piece of too
much media culture — it doesn't belong at Stanford,"
senior Marc Kolb argued.
Karagueuzian added that "it makes the Coffee House
more preprogrammed than it used to be and somehow
more commercial."
And as Kessinee Angkustsiri so touchingly put it, "It's a
sign of the changing times all right."
But Emily Parker, a fan of the jukebox, feels it enhances
the atmosphere in the Coffee House. "The mood of the
music reflects the mood of the people in the room. It was so
uneven before. Now it is much less eclectic."
But few have been as transformed by the new addition as
Brian Robinson, a sporadic patron of the Coffee House.
"Dammit, I couldn't be happier about the jukebox," he said.
"Many was a day before the jukebox when I would weep
uncontrollably. I'm a much happier man."
