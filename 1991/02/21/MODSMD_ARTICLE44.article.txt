Does father really
know best?
*Mr and Mrs. Bridge," starring
Paul Newman and Joanne
Woodward.
"Mr. and Mrs. Bridge" is not a tra
ditional narrative. There is no obvious
beginning, middle or end to the story.
There is no suspenseful introduction
which leads to a dramatic climax and
settles into a gentle denouement.
Instead, we are presented with a
slice of American life during World
War 11, as experienced by a wealthy,
country-club couple in Kansas City.
Mr. Bridge (Paul Newman) is the
epitome of stubborn self-righteous
ness. Uncomfortably upright and
tight-lipped, Mr. Bridge never smiles.
Having never found smut "amusing,"
he refuses to laugh at dirty jokes — or
anything else for that matter.
A man of resolute integrity, he is
incapable of expressing love for his
wife and three children though he
accepts his financial responsibility for
them on the most serious terms.
Mrs. Bridge (Joanne Woodward) is
endearing as the timid wife. Having
devoted her life to caring for her fam
ily, her love for them is unconditional,
though at times she aches to be shown
appreciation. She is grateful for even
the slightest hint of consideration, and
tearfully thanks her husband for not
demanding sex from her.
Her willingness to please is touch
ing while at the same time tragic, as
she has always lived her life for others.
She is open-minded and views life
with wonderment, but is confined by
her husband's narrow conservativism.
James Ivory's delicate direction
subtly examines the patriarchal

assumptions that exist in our society.
Evan Connel's insightful novels (the
movie is based on two: "Mr. Bridge"
and "Mrs. Bridge") are skillfully
adapted to the screen, highlighting the
male domination that is so common as
to go unnoticed in daily life. Though
we are disgusted by Mr. Bridge's cold
ness and lack of compassion towards
his wife and children, we realize that
his behavior is not uncommon and is
usually considered acceptable in
American families.
We come to understand the
loneliness and lack of recognition
marking the life of an American
housewife. We sympathize with the
daughters who long for a life in which
they can maintain control, a life with
out submission.
Most importantly, we are reminded
that our mothers love us dearly and
deserve to be shown respect and
appreciation, at least every once in a
while.

A close look at
the tinsel-y part
of tinseltown
*L.A. Story," starring Steve Mar
tin and Victoria Tennant.
"L.A. Story" is a gritty, heart
wrenching exploration of what life is
like in America's Calcutta. It is written
with grave insight by Steve Martin.
Let me try that again.
"L.A. Story," written by Steve Mar
tin, is an exploration of what life is like
in America's Lotus-land.
How about this:
"L.A. Story" is the cinematic equiv
alent of a Perrier with a twist of lemon.
It's ticklish and temporarily satisfies an

urge for comedy, but there is not much
left when it's over.
No? TVy this on:
Imagine you hear the clinking of a
cymbal and a distinctive bass-line. Can
you hear it? Probably not, but bear
with me.
A guitar cuts in.
You hear Jim "My eyes arc rolled
into the back of my head" Morrison
drool something I have yet to figure
out. Then he sings: "L.A. wooooman,
... L.A. woooman."
What this has in common with
"L.A. Story" escapes me. The song is
not even played in the movie — one of
the few Los Angeles-evoking sites or
sounds not utilized in Martin's latest
comedy.
Actually, "L.A. Story" only deals
with the section of Los Angeles north
of the Interstate Highway 10 and west
of Interstate Highway 101. It's about
life on Wilshire and Sunset boulevards.
In other words, kids, this is the Los
Angeles depicted on postcards, bill
boards and the "Tonight Show."
Not that there's anything wrong
with that. Never mind the gang vio
lence, the thousands of homeless peo
ple, the gridlock and the air pollution
that characterize life in the police state
to our south.
No, the Los Angeles of "L.A. Story"
is the type of place people in Delaware
want to visit.
The script by Martin is a funny cat
alog of every stereotype that has been
associated with the "City of the
Angels." He even mixes in some bizarre
references to Shakespeare for flavor.
Director Mick Jackson's visual style
is appropriately hyperactive.
The story is your basic search for
love and fulfillment amidst the chaos
of decadence. Martin plays the perfect
character for La-La land, Harris K.
Telemacher, a "wacky" weatherman.
Talk about a purposeless existence.
Eventually, Harris falls in love with
an unusual English journalist, Sara
McDowel (Victoria Tennant, Martin's
real-life wife).
Needless to say, the film ends on an
upbeat note.
Even though, as a former resident
of the city, I have about as much regard
for Los Angeles as I do for the leftover
pulp in my orange juice, 1 have to
admit that "L.A. Story" is definitely
worth the look.

The gore is off
screen, but the
tenor is there
"Silence of the Lambs," starring
Jodie Foster and Anthony Hop
kins.
As of late, Hollywood's psychologi
cal thrillers have ranged from pre
dictable piffle, like "Pacific Heights," to
campy horror shows, like "Sleeping
With the Enemy."
Clearly, the genre has been in dire
need of a pick-me-up.
But who would've thought that
Jonathan Demme, an offbeat director
known for his kooky comedies ("Mar
ried to the Mob," "Something Wild"),
would deliver the most harrowing
thriller in several years?
'The Silence of the Lambs'
is not for everyone. It is a
harrowingly intense way to
spend two hours, and some
may be put off by its cold,
dank ambience.
"The Silence of the Lambs" is a
ruthless, stylish and terribly disturbing
film based on Thomas Harris' best
selling novel. The book tells the story
of Clarice Starling, an FBI agent-in
training who tracks down a serial killer
with the help of another brutal (but
brilliant) psychotic.
The novel was impossible to put
down, as it traced the process of catch
ing a psychopath with intimate, intelli
gent detail. On a psychological level, it
was horrifying because two out of the
three main characters were deranged
lunatics. Harris' ability to crawl into
their heads made the reading undeni
ably frightening. Remarkably, Demme
manages to recreate the terror of Har
ris' novel without resorting to the
manipulative tactics of other contem
porary thrillers.
Rather than litter the film with gore
(and there are plenty of opportuni
ties), Demme leaves most of the bru
tality offscreen. Instead, he relishes the
harrowing interviews between Starling
(Jodie Foster) and Dr. Hannibal Lecter
(Anthony Hopkins), a former serial

killer held captive in a mental institu
tion. (In his day, he was better known
as Hannibal the Cannibal — use your
imagination.)
Lecter is brilliant and cunning,
slowly revealing clues about the mur
derer's identity and whereabouts while
prying into Starling's own emotionally
scarred past. The film is fascinating in
these skewed tete-a-teter, you may
want to look away at times, but you
can't.
"The Silence of the Lambs" should
have been released two months ago, so
it could have qualified for several
Oscar nominations. In addition to a
haunting soundtrack and brilliant cin
ematography by Tak Fujimoto, the
performances are great.
Foster brings a coarse toughness to
her role, making the character much
richer than the usual woman-in-dis
tress. It is refreshing to see a female
actress performing in a role seemingly
written for a man, and it's even better
to see Foster pull it off. Nobody could
be a more believable hero (never mind
"heroine").
Hopkins achieves the impossible.
Debonair, sly and ever so courteous,
he's chilling and freakishly endearing
at the same time. Some may even find
him sexy, in an offbeat way. At the end
of the film he announces that he is
about to "have a friend for dinner"
(quite literally), and the audience at
my screening cheered. That should tell
you something about Hopkins' por
trayal.
"The Silence of the Lambs" is not
for everyone. It is a harrowingly
intense way to spend two hours, and
some may be put off by its cold, dank
ambience. But it is a remarkable
thriller, unpredictable and stylishly
executed. Whatever you do, don't have
dinner beforehand. Then again, you
won't want any afterwards, either.

She shouldn't
have cut her
hair
"Sleeping With the Enemy,"
stoning Julia Roberts, Kevin
Anderson and Patrick Bergen
I didn't like "Sleeping With the
Enemy."
And it isn't because I'm jealous of

Julia Roberts, either.
Oh sure, she's pretty. OK, she's
more than pretty. ALL RIGHT! She's
GORGEOUS! What MORE do you
want me to say? That I'd KILL to look
like her?! That I cried for a WEEK
when she cut her hair?! That EVERY
time I see one of her movies 1 start a
diet and reconsider plastic surgery?!
SO?
Are you implying that I would let
my personal feelings get in the way of
my journalistic responsibility?
I didn't think so.
Anyway, as I was saying, I didn't like
"Sleeping With the Enemy." And,
despite the fact that I am just a wee bit
envious of Robert's looks (and her tal
ent and her wealth ...), I usually like
her films. And I really expected to like
"Sleeping With the Enemy." In fact, I
wanted to like it.
But I didn't.
Robert's stars as Laura Burney, the
beautiful, intelligent and abused wife
of Martin (Kevin Bergen). As Laura,
Roberts is the seemingly devoted
spouse — she cooks his meals, does his
laundry and makes sure the cans in the
cupboard are all facing forward.
Because that's the kind of wife Martin
wants.
And demands.
Well, Laura's not really all that
devoted (who can blame her) and
eventually she fakes her own death and
escapes to lowa where she meets a
sweet, caring, nice drama teacher
(Kevin Anderson). But, Martin figures
out Laura's not dead, and ... well you
can guess what happens.
Which is one of the problems with
the movie — there are no surprises.
Director Joseph Rubens has
attempted to make a Hitchcock-like
thriller, but to no avail. Every "thrill" is
expected way in advance.
Another problem is the pace of the
movie — erratic. I spent the first 45
minutes waiting for something to hap
pen, and the next hour-and-a-half
amazed that everything was moving so
unbelievably quickly.
And trust me, "unbelievably" is the
key word; the film has a lot of implau
sibilities, though that is the least of its
faults.
So you see, I didn't like "Sleeping
With the Enemy."
And Julia had nothing to do with it.
Well, almost nothing.
