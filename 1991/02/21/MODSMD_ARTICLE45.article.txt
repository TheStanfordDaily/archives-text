How To Defeat Saddam Hussein:
Scenarios and Strategies for the
Gulf War
Retired U.S. Army Cols. Trevor
Dupuy, Curt Johnson, David
Bongard and Arnold Dupuy
Warner Books, 202 pages, $4.95
This book tells what the news
casts don't. It gives five strategies
on how to beat Saddam Hussein.
Formerly titled "If War Comes,
How to Defeat Saddam Hussein,"
this guide is a military strategist's
dream. Its 13 chapters and six
appendices discuss historical per
spectives, various options for
approach, desert environment and
weapons available to each of the
military forces involved.
Written in a straightforward
manner and filled with maps and
charts, "[T]he purpose of this book
... is to acquaint those who might
be interested in the kinds of consid
erations with which those com
manders and staffs must be con
cerned in the planning process."
The Republic of Fear: Inside the
Story of Saddam's Iraq
Samir Al-Khalil
Pantheon, 309 pages, $12.95
Al-Khalil, in describing Saddam
Hussein's rule of Iraq, calls it"the
most ruthless regime in the world."
He gives a detailed political
analysis of a dictatorship and the
maintenance of power in Iraq. Al-
Khalil, an expatriate Iraqi,
describes life in his country as he
observed it.
As he discusses the meaning of
Saddam's regime, he analyzes the
relationship between history and
politics. To him, Saddam's Iraq is
"politics rooted in violence."
Not Without My Daughter
Betty Mahmoody with
William Hoffer
St. Martin's, 420 pages, $5.95
Recently released as a "major
motion picture," Betty Mah
moody's book tells a compelling, if
sensationalistic, story. Under pres
sure from her Iranian husband,

Mahmoody and her American
born daughter make a visit to Iran.
Once there, her husband
becomes increasingly tyrannical
and Mahmoody, accustomed to the
relatively free life of an American
woman, wants to leave. Her hus
band eventually agrees that she can
— but only without their daughter.
The ensuing story of adventure,
danger and escape is entertaining,
but the book fails to provide a
coherent analysis of the Iranian
political and social context in
which her story occurs.
From Beirut to Jerusalem
Thomas L Friedman
Anchor/Doubleday,
526 pages, $12.95
On the bestseller lists for over
six months now, "From Beirut to
Jerusalem" is an account of the
Arab-Israeli conflict over the past
decade.
Because Friedman's book ante
dates the current Gulf crisis, it pro
vides a broader perspective from
which to view conflict in the Mid
dle East. Well-written and compre
hensive, it is aimed at an audience
with little prior knowledge of the
region.
Baghdad Without a Map
Tony Horwitz
Dutton, 276 pages, $19.95
"Baghdad Without a Map" is a
meandering series of anecdotes
which chronicle reporter Tony
Horwitz's two years of travel
through 15 Middle Eastern coun
tries.
Horwitz recounts dangerous
adventures, including crossing
mined bodies of water and flying
on "the world's 10 most-likely-to
be-hijacked airlines."
The gist of the book is that the
Middle East makes no sense; West
erners will never be ab'e to under
stand the region's contradictions.
In all fairness, however, Horwitz
also points out that the Western
conception of rationality is equally
foreign to Middle Easterners.
