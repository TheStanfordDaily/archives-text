## Various perspectives on Middle East war top paperback bestseller lists 
### Judy Hsu 
A month after the beginning of the
war in the Persian Gulf, many people
still watch television to quickly obtain
information about events in the Mid
dle East; others rely on newspapers
and magazines to keep abreast of the
changes occurring in the war, but per
haps only books can provide a more
complete understanding of the situa
tion in the Gulf.
Sasson retells individual
Kuwaitis' accounts of the
war. [She] makes no pre
tense of providing an
objective or comparitive
perspective.
Timely books about the war top the
list of New York Times Paperback
Bestsellers. "Saddam Hussein and the
Crisis in the Gulf" by Judith Miller and
Laurie Mylroie (Random House, 258
pages, $5.95), "From Beirut to
Jerusalem" by Thomas L. Friedman
(see Browsing), and"The Rape of
Kuwait" by Jean P. Sasson (Knights
bridge, 154 pages, $4.95) place first,
second and third, respectively, on the
bestsellers list this week-
Fourth on the list is Betty Mah
moody's "Not Without My Daughter."
"Republic of Fear," by Samir al-Khalil,
takes the tenth spot. (See Browsing for
more information on both books.)
Sasson's "Rape of Kuwait" is a sen
sationalistic book, which deals exclu
sively with the human rights abuses

perpetrated by Iraqi soldiers in
Kuwait.
Sasson retells individual Kuwaitis'
accounts of the war. Written in narra
tive, the book reads easily, bringing to
the reader scenes of chaotic war and
unbelievable injustice. The author
makes no pretense of providing an
objective or comparative perspective.
The sights are astounding. Iraqi
soldiers rape women before their par
ents' eyes, throw hospital patients into
skating rinks and shoot at women and
children marching peacefully.
Sasson, in the first chapter, gives a
clear, concise summary of Kuwaiti his
tory and, in the last, introduces a
detailed account of firsthand experi
ences from members of the ruling
family.
A less personal and more political
view unfolds as the rhetoric of Saddam
Hussein and fellow government offi
cials comes through in "Iraq Speaks:
Documents on the Gulf Crisis." Fred
Moore's unique compilation gives the
Iraqi perspective.
Interviews, speeches and letters
from June 1975 to late October of last
year reveal Hussein's side of the dia
logue surrounding the Gulf crisis with
no outside commentary. Through
these documents, Moore's book pre
sents a clear progression of the think
ing behind the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait.
In these documents, Hussein
describes his attempts to secure a
peaceful pan-Arabia free from imperi
alistic Western intervention. He por
trays the United States as a power-hun
gry nation which seeks control of the
Middle East in order to control the
world.
Moore presents Hussein's letters to

President Bush along with transcrip
tions of various interviews and verbal
presentations. These items record the
progress toward the current conflict
over Kuwait.
The Iraqi government documents
show the official shift in the view of
Kuwait from the "government [that)
began to adopt an unjust [oil] policy
(to) the corrupt minority, which is
connected with the foreigner."
"Iraq Speaks" also contains a brief

description of the political organiza
tion of Iraq and a list of those involved
in its government as well as pertinent
United Nations Security Council Reso
lutions.
While "The Rape of Kuwait"
describes the emotional trauma as a
result of war, "Iraq Speaks" intellectu
alizes and rationalizes the event. The
authors of the books both express the
need to distribute the information
with speed.
