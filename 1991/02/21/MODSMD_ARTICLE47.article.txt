Stanford Humanities Prof. John L'Heureux has
written a thoroughly compelling novel of human
weakness and personal strength. In "An Honorable
Profession," L'Heureux tells the story of Miles Ban
non, a likable and well-liked high school English
teacher who is accused of molesting a student and is
found guilty by a jury of rumor-mongers.
L'Heureux simultaneously weaves complex char
acters and a cogent storyline. His characters grapple
with love, sex, guilt and addiction, and L'Heureux

never falls into the trap of oversimplifying their
dilemmas to provide action.
Bannon is accused of molesting a student, Billy
Mack, who, in an extremely disturbing scene at the
novel's beginning, is raped in the locker room by
several members of the football team.
In an attempt to comfort the boy, Bannon devel
ops a friendship with him. When Billy commits sui
cide, his father, a police officer, begins to suspect the
teacher of wrongdoing on the basis of circumstantial
evidence.
Bannon survives these unfounded accusations of
molestation, unrequited love and bouts of heavy
drinking and emerges a stronger person. Only a
writer as skillful as L'Heureux could portray this
struggle and triumph without moralizing or gross

oversimplification.
The author successfully explores issues of guilt
and responsibility, both in Bannon's friendship with
Mack and in his relationships with Diane and Mar
garet, two very different women with whom he is
involved.
In addition to providing sympathetic portrayals
of his main characters, L'Heureux also includes real
istic and entertaining glimpses into the administra
tive politics and behind-the-scenes maneuvering at
fictional Malburn High.
L'Heureux's dialogue is realistic and his prose
powerful. "An Honorable Profession" is difficult to
put down; the story is dramatic and suspenseful.
More than that, the book raises important questions
about the nature of guilt and innocence.
