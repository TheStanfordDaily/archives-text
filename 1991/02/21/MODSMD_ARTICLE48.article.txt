Milorad Pavic, the Yugoslavian author of
"Landscape Painted With Tea," seems to have a
deep desire to confuse and frustrate the sober
reader. For those on acid trips or in alcoholic
stupors, this book could be a Godsend.
That may not sound too appealing; the
truth is, the book really isn't that bad. It's just
that finding an absurd simile or metaphor in
this book is about as hard as finding an uptight
Harvard student.
When Pavic writes, "It was as quiet outside
as in an armpit," the images which come to
mind don't quite correspond. And the whole
book is full of such images.

Pavic believes that a book is nothing 'other than a
collection of words well-crossedlf this is true, then his
effort is certainly to be commended.

One of the characters divides her family into
molars, incisors and wisdom teeth, loose and
broken. Many of the personas have faces like
"kneaded dough." In short, the whole book
speaks indirectly, and after about 300 pages it's
tiring.
But beyond all the figures of speech, the
story is really about three main characters: Ser
bian architect Antanas Svilar, his wife Vitacha
Milut and You, the reader.

After the first section of the book, in which
Pavic writes about Svilar, some really old monk
and the difference between cenobites and idior
rhythmics (Don't ask.), he changes the entire
format of the novel and sets up the plot as a
crossword, which the reader must solve.
Most of the second half of the book is a trib
ute to Svilar, who has becomes a nuclear waste
dealer in Los Angeles and owns 2 percent of the
world's capital.

Pavic's characters are not particularly sym
pathetic, but they are definitely colorful. Svilar,
who becomes a transsexual for a few days, has
had an incestuous relationship with his sister;
his wife has a fetish for young boys and was a
bulimic in her youth.
Throughout the crossword, the reader fol
low these characters in random moments
through their romances and eventual disen
chantment with each other and with the world.
By structuring the book as a crossword,
Pavic attempts to bridge the gap between the
novel and the reader so the reader becomes an
actual participant. Supposedly by reading
across, reading down and searching for clues,
the reader should be able to solve the riddle at
the end of the book and come out a whole lot
wiser.
The novel's problem, however, is that while I
Pavic must have had a great time creating these

"word crosses," the reader is expected to do too
much work to figure them out. In the end, the
author's points are left only half-articulated
and the reader is left wondering what was just
read.
Pavic believes that a book is nothing "other
than a collection of words well-crossed." If this
is true, then his effort is certainly to be com
mended.
At one point Pavic writes, "A book, if you
expect wonders of it, should also be read twice.
It should be read once in youth, when you are
younger than its heroes, and the second time
when you are advance in age, when the book's
heroes become younger than yourself."
Unfortunately, some books don't make
much sense no matter how old one is or how
many times one reads them, and Pavic seems to
have hit upon this formula perfectly in "Land
scape Painted With Tea."
