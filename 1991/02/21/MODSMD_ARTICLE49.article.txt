"Ghost" as best picture? "Pretty Woman's"
Julia Roberts as best actress? Whoopi Goldberg
for her supporting role in "Ghost?" What next?
Donatello for best actor in "Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles?" "Navy SEALS" as best film?
With the Oscar nominations out last week,
it is clear that either the voting members of the
Academy have been brainwashed by recent
commercial successes or they're high on crack
(probably the latter). Once again, the year in
movies was not a great one. Blockbuster action,
romance, and kiddie pix dominated the mar
ket, leaving little room for the more serious
minded films that in years past have found
their way onto Oscar lists.
"Dances with Wolves," "Dick Tracy" and
"Goodfellas" are perhaps the only memorable
achievements of 1990. Each of these films man
aged to put a creative twist on an old theme —
the western, the fantasy adventure, and the
gangster epic, respectively.
But for every such whiff of innovation, there
was a slew of the usual blockbuster fare. Pretty
women, die-hard kindergarten cops, and
ghosts in misery totally recalled the films of last
year; viewers were better off staying home
alone.
The Academy's choices this time around
were eclectic, but with such slim pickings per
haps there were no other alternatives.
Without further griping, here's a summary
of the nominations, with a list of who could
win and who should win (with the Oscars, this

is a major distinction).
BEST PICTURE: The year almost definitely
belongs to "Dances With Wolves." Winning the
hearts of critics and audiences alike with its
humanist feel-goodism, "Wolves" is, along with
"Good Fellas," the only film worthy of a best
picture title. Unfortunately, Scorsese's gangster
epic was too unconventional in its free-flowing
narrative, and Academy members have tradi
tionally been put off by such art-house experi
mentation.
Sappy voters might like the hankie mental
ity of "Awakenings," but the film is too much
like "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and
"Rainman" to sway the board to a majority
vote. "The Godfather Part III" was a sensa
tional coda to the previous two films, but it has
a major drawback: the roman numerals at the
end of the title.
"Ghost," the highest grossing film of the
year, miraculously found itself nominated in
the Best Picture category. This manipulative
crowd-pleaser should just shut up and go to
video, where it can make another $200 million.
BEST ACTOR: Robert DeNiro, with his
Rainman-esque performance in "Awakenings,"
is the most likely candidate in the best actor
category. However, the Academy loves sur
prises, and foreigner Gerard Depardieu is the
ultimate underdog. Fantastic in both "Cyrano
de Bergerac" and the American "Green Card,"
he just might steal the Oscar from under
DeNiro's nose.
Costner earned more praise for his direc
toral debut in "Wolves" than he did for his
occasionally stilted performance, so his chances

are slim. Jeremy Irons was superb as an icy
Claus Von Bulow in "Reversal of Fortune," but
the film was little-seen. Richard Harris is an
off-the-wall pick for his role in the British film
"The Field," but surprises do happen.
BEST ACTRESS: The year had plenty of fine
women's roles, and great actresses eagerly filled
them (Jessica Lange of "Men Don't Leave" was
unfairly shut out of the competition, as was
Glenn Close for her roles in "Reversal of For
tune" and "Hamlet"). By far, Joanne Wood
ward turned in the best performance of the
nominees in James Ivory's gentle drama "Mr. &
Mrs. Bridge." Since she has recently declared
that this is her last film, Academy members
may rightfully decide to honor her.
Angelica Huston will be hot on the trail
with her portrayal of a fuming dominatrix in
"The Grifters," but Meryl Streep, who was
hilarious as a coke-headed actress in "Postcards
From the Edge," will be casually overlooked.
Playing a mentally deranged psycho is one
of the easiest — and most common — ways to
get critical acclaim. Therefore Kathy Bates
doesn't have a chance with her work in "Mis
ery." Nobody will want to vote for a Stephen
King adaptation anyway. And Julia Roberts
should hit the streets, like she originally did in
"Pretty Woman." If there's any justice in this
world, the award is Woodward's.
BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR: The sup
porting actor race will have A 1 Pacino duking it
out with Andy Garcia. Pacino was rightfully
nominated for "Dick Tracy" (indeed, he made
the most spectacular appearance in the cast
next to Madonna's cleavage). His inexplicable

shut-out from the Best Actor category in "God
father III" may garner him the sympathy votes
he'll need against Garcia in this category.
Garcia, who stole the show in the final
"Godfather" installment, has been an
acclaimed underdog for years ("The Untouch-

and viewers were better off

ables," "Internal Affairs"). His memorable per
formance as a temperamental mafioso may
strike a chord in voters. Also running is Joe
Pesci, a critic's darling who also played a tem
peramental mafioso in "Good Fellas" (do we see
a trend here?). Graham Greene ("Dances with
Wolves") and Bruce Davison ("Longtime Com
panion") are relative newcomers, and their
chances are slim in a field full of veterans.
BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS: In the
women's race, Lorraine Bracco ("Goodfellas")
stands tall in a weak field. Her only threat will
be Mary McDonnell, who was astounding in

"Dances With Wolves." But McDonnell's new
comer status may count against her in the long
run.
If Academy members are still high on crack,
they may give Whoopi a shot. Rounding out
the field are two bizarre choices; Dianne Ladd
as the overprotective Southern Mama in "Wild
at Heart," and the atrocious Annette Bening
("The Grifters") — since when is writhing
about in a tight dress considered great acting?
BEST DIRECTOR: This category belongs to
Kevin Costner all the way, who did a remark
able job with the risky project "Dances with
Wolves." Kostner revived the Western, made
Sioux tribeswear chic, and proved that a three
hour historical epic could still make 100 mil
lion dollars.
Scorsese and Coppola are dark horse candi
dates who will have to overcome Academy prej
udices against unconventional directing and
casting choices. Barbet Schroeder's adept style
in "Reversal of Fortune" is worthy of the prize,
but the film's poor revenues will not help.
Stephen Frears, for "The Grifters," rounds out
the field.
And there they are, the Oscar nominations
for 1990. Tune in next year, when "Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the
Ooze" is up for best picture against "The Care
Bears Go Flatlining," and Jean-Claude Van
Damme battles it out for best supporting actor
with Vanilla Ice ...

Hosted by Billy Crystal, the Oscars will be tele
vised from the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles
on March 25.
