# Stanford lobbies for financial aid changes
## 
### John Snyder 
Facing an upcoming review of
the law that determines federal
contributions to student financial
aid, some administrators and stu
dents are planning to lobby the
government to change the way
awards are calculated.
University officials said they
hope Congress will streamline the
application and disbursement pro
cess for federal student aid and
give educational institutions more
control over individual financial
aid awards.
The campaign aims to influ
ence certain provisions of the
Higher Education Act of 1965,
which is up for congressional
review this year.
This act, which must be reau
thorized every five years, provides
about $15 billion of the $18 billion
dollars spent annually on student
grants, loans and employment.
Stanford is more dependent on
federal resources now than it was
10 years ago, said Robert Huff,
director of Stanford's Financial

Aids Office. He added that the
reauthorization process could
affect a large portion of Stanford's
financial aid resources.
Robert Huff, director of Stan
ford's Financial Aids Office, said
the federal government this year
gave Stanford students about $10
million in total aid this year —
$6.5 million in loans and $3.5 mil
lion in scholarships and
work/study grants. The Univer
sity awarded an additional $26
million in grant and $1.8 million
in loans.
Huff said the lobbying efforts
aim to make financial need calcu
lations more accurate and the
application process less intimidat
ing for students. He added that he
hopes the amount of federal aid
available for students would
increase, but admitted this is
unlikely given a federal budget
deficit of $300 billion.
Stanford will try to influence
the views of educational organiza
tions that lobby Congress, such as

the Coalition for Financing
Higher Education. He said if these
organizations are unwilling to
accept Stanford's ideas, the Uni
versity may attempt to lobby
Congress directly.
The University's efforts will be

spearheaded by Huff and Cindy
Bedont, associate director of gov
ernment relations in the Office of
Public Affairs.
In addition to administrators,
students are becoming involved in
the issue. At 3 p.m. tomorrow,
junior Naomi Onaga, ASSU sena
tor and member of the board of
directors of the United States Stu
dents Association, will speak in
Oak Room East at Tresidder

Union about the reauthorization
of the act.
Onaga said goals of the associ
ation, to which the ASSU belongs,
include a simplified application
process, more work/study pro
grams and an increase in loans
and grants, especially for middle
income students.
The association also opposes a
Department of Education pro
posal to impose a one-month wait

ing period after a loan is approved
before disbursing the funds,
Onaga said.
Huff said he thinks Stanford
students could have a major
impact on the politics of federal
financial aid. "Probably the most
effective lobbies in the country are
students."
Huff said he hopes a reautho
rized act will allow Stanford more
flexibility in awarding financial

aid to students. Currently, finan
cial needs — determined by a con
gressional formula that takes into
account parental income, assets
and other factors — "is sort of
cast in stone," said Mary Roberts,
assistant director of resource uti
lization at the Financial Aids
Office.
"We can't deviate from them
without documenting a reason,"
she explained.
