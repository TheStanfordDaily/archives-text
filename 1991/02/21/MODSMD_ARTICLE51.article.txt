# Laughter fills a packed Coffee House
## 
### Eric Keppler 
The Coffee House's pseudo-intellectual atmosphere was
briefly interrupted Tuesday night when would-be comedi
ans took to the stage for the Certs (Two-Mints-In-One) U.S.
College Comedy Competition.
Thirteen brave souls risked humiliation by entertaining
the tightly-packed crowd, but Alex Gregory was clearly the
stand-out performer, eliciting cheers and laughter for his
impassioned, if raunchy New Jersey humor.
The evening's amusement was enhanced by a trio of
hecklers sitting at the edge of the stage.
The Sigma Chi fraternity, in a stroke of PR mastery, sent
three of their finest in what appeared to be an attempt to
endear themselves to the crowd. Instead, the evening's mas
ter of ceremonies, one-time "Star Search" quarterfinalist
Frank King, succeeded in turning the crowd against them.
Senior Raphe Beck, one of the contestants, joined in the
fun, characterizing the young men as "Fraternal Affairs
Poster Children." And as King was quick to point out, "The
comedian always wins."
These hecklers, despite their concerted (if drunken)
effort, were unsuccessful in stealing the spotlight. That
belonged to contest winner Alex Gregory. Gregory's routine

reached its most poignant moment during his critique of
"Nerf life" at Stanford. When he launched into an invective
about Stanford love, every true romantic in the place was on
his or her feet.
"People here don't want to fall in love!" he howled.
"They want Nerf love. They want it safe and squishy and
Cabriolet and everything nice.... Well f—k that, all
right?!"
What set Gregory's routine apart from the field was the
passion which characterized his delivery.
The routine hit the nerve center of everyone in the place
who had an ounce of emotion in his body, anyone who
believes that love is more important than getting the prob
lem set done on time.
"I was on the verge of tears," said sophomore Dave
Canada.
Other standouts were Rich Lobel, who illuminated the
evening with some of his speculations on rectal thermome
ters and Jewish grandmothers; sophomore Ekpedeme
Bassey, who earned some respect for herself and her belea
guered fellow yell leaders; and someone called G-Man, who
delighted the crowd with a vehement insult directed at the
hecklers (which had the unfortunate consequence of dis
qualifying him on grounds of profanity).
