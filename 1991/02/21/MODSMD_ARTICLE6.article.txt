# Committee will plan search for new dean
## 
### Peter Robison Staff writer 
In its continuing reorganization of
student services, the Office of Student
Resources has taken the first step in
the search for a new dean of students
by appointing a committee to deter
mine the criteria for the position.
The consultative committee of fac
ulty, students and staff, which was cre
ated last week, will help determine the
scope and nature of the search for the
new dean, said acting Vice President
for Student Resources Sally Mahoney.
The new dean will report to Student
Resources and will be "the principal

advocate for students" in the Univer
sity, Mahoney said. In addition, the
dean will focus "on support for the
multicultural agenda and on support
for graduate student affairs."
A timetable for the search process
has not been set, Mahoney said. The
consultative group has to first define,
"in a series of explorations," the limits
of the search.
The exact criteria for appointing the
new dean will be "clearer when we
define the scope of the search," she
added.
After the new post is filled, the posi
tion of dean of student affairs will be
phased out. Most organizations cur

rently under Student Affairs will be
divided between the new dean of stu
dents and a new network of offices col
lectively called "academic services."
Norm Robinson, the current acting
dean of student affairs, was out of
town yesterday and could not be
reached for comment.
The new dean of students will over
see and maintain a range of services —
including the ethnic community cen
ters, Bechtel International Center and
the Disability Resource Center — and
will be the University's liaison with
the ASSU, Mahoney said.
The new dean will not be responsi
ble for the Office of Residential Educa

tion, which will be relocated to the aca
demic services group.
Mahoney said the overall Student
Resources restructuring aims to
smooth working relationships among
the coordinators of different student
services.
The committee includes six faculty
members recommended by the Faculty
Senate's Committee on Committees
and six students nominated by the
ASSU Council of Presidents.
In addition, Teresa Nishikawa, aca
demic standing adviser, and Sharon
Parker, director of the Office of Multi
cultural Development, will participate.
