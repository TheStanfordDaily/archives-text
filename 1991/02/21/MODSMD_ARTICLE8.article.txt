# Students First wants 'less militant ASSU'
## 
### Miranda Doyle Staff writer 
At an informational meeting
last night in preparation for the
upcoming ASSU elections, mem
bers of the Students First party
said they want to promote an
image of an ASSU that works for
the students.
Addressing prospective ASSU
Senate and Council of Presidents
candidates, deputy Senate Chair
Beth Morgan said Students First
tries to "make the ASSU less mil
itant and more acceptable to the
majority of students."
As examples, Morgan cited the
party's work on the new alcohol
policy and sponsorship of a teach
ing award. The award is a "way to
show teaching is really impor
tant," she said.
The senate recently over
whelmingly voted in favor of a bill
establishing student-nominated
teaching awards to professors.
Party members said they envi
sion a student government that is
relevant to students. Party chair

Michael Canul said his party is
most concerned with issues that
affect Stanford students directly.
Along those lines, two party
members, graduate senators John
Overdeck and Douglas Bone,
sponsored a bill that would pro
hibit senate debate of non-Stan
ford-related issues. The bill was
voted down 13-7 at the senate's
Feb. 5 meeting.
"There is no point in debating
issues we can have no affect on,"
said Canul.
Students First's COP slate was
defeated the past two years, but
Canul said he is encouraged by the
number of Students First mem
bers in the senate.
Canul said the party was cre
ated two and a half years ago by
students who wanted "to focus on
student needs in general and not
just minority needs." He also said
the People's Platform, the other
student party, had been very
involved in minority issues, both
on campus and around the world,
which "seemed to alienate a lot of
people."
