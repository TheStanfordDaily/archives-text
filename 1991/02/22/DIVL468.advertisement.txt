TREASURE HUNT
There's a $100 gift certificate out there with your name on it (actually, it says
'winner'). So hop aboard, get inside and come along for a magic ride.
Last Saturday, a young man with a dancing disorder walked up to me at a social
gathering and said, "I solved this week's clue." And, in fact, he had.
To this troubled lad I say: 1) Why so much free time? and 2) How did you figure
out who I am?
Well, I vowed right then and there never to be seen dancing with my neck like
that. I also vowed to make this week's clue tougher, stronger and faster.
But don't worry. I realize most Friday lectures are only 50 minutes long. I've done
my best to balance these two needs.
So here 'tis. Clue numero two.
All of the items on this list have something in common (unlike in the fave Sesame
Street segment). Their commonality is your second clue and a quick path to easy
money. (Did he say easy money, Martha? Yes dear, now eat your ratatouille.)
