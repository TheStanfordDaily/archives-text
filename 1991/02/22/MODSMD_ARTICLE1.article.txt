# SOVIET-IRAQI PLAN NOT ENOUGH FOR U.S.
## 
### 
DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) — As
the sounds of war thundered up and
down the tense Persian Gulf battle line
yesterday, a Soviet-brokered plan to fore
stall a ground war was offered in Moscow
only to be deemed unacceptable by Wash
ington.
After Iraq's foreign minister met with
Mikhail Gorbachev to deliver a reply to
the Soviet president's peace plan, it was
announced that Baghdad and Moscow
had agreed on steps to end the war.
In an initial phone call to Gorbachev,
President Bush "raised serious concerns
about several points," said Wh.*e House

spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
Bush then held a late-night meeting
with advisers, and the outcome was char
acterized by a senior Bush administration
official: "The Soviet call for lifting of eco
nomic sanctions and lifting the U.N. reso
lutions amounts to a conditional with
drawal that would be unacceptable to the
United States."
The official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said administration officials
were communicating that conclusion to
coalition partners and expected to make
public comments later today.
Another key drawback in the U.S. view

was believed to be the lack of any appar
ent Iraqi commitment to pay reparations
for war damage.
Prime Minister John Major today
rejected the Soviet-Iraqi plan to end the
Persian Gulf War as insufficient.
In brief remarks to reporters outside
his Downing Street office, he said the
plan was "certainly an improvement" on

what Iraq had offered before but was still
"not good enough."
Mtyor did not elaborate on his objec
tions. He said he and his Cabinet col
leagues would analyze the plans' details.
Up on the northern desert front, 72
British artillery pieces and battery after
battery of U.S. rocket launchers opened
fire on targets deep in Iraqi-held territory,
in one of the heaviest barrages of the war.
Helicopter gunships streaked north of
the frontier and blasted Iraqi guns and
armored vehicles, and American ground
troops were venturing into Kuwait and
Iraq on reconnaissance forays, the U.S.

command said. Meanwhile, seven Ameri
cans were killed in a helicopter accident.
The command said the allies' stepped
up cross-border activity was "shaping the
battlefield" — in a prelude to an all-out
ground offensive to push Iraq's occupa
tion army out of Kuwait.
Kuwait's exiled emir, Sheik Jaber al-
Ahmed al-Sabah, issued a message to his
armed forces declaring, "The hour of sal
vation is near." But the news from
Moscow left open the possibility a ground
war might be avoided.
