# SOVIET-IRAQI PLAN NOT ENOUGH FOR U.S.
## 
### 
DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) — As
the sounds of war thundered up and
down the tense Persian Gulf battle line
yesterday, a Soviet-brokered plan to fore
stall a ground war was offered in Moscow
only to be deemed unacceptable by Wash
ington.
After Iraq's foreign minister met with
Mikhail Gorbachev to deliver a reply to
the Soviet president's peace plan, it was
announced that Baghdad and Moscow
had agreed on steps to end the war.
In an initial phone call to Gorbachev,
President Bush "raised serious concerns
about several points," said Wh.*e House

spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
Bush then held a late-night meeting
with advisers, and the outcome was char
acterized by a senior Bush administration
official: "The Soviet call for lifting of eco
nomic sanctions and lifting the U.N. reso
lutions amounts to a conditional with
drawal that would be unacceptable to the
United States."
The official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said administration officials
were communicating that conclusion to
coalition partners and expected to make
public comments later today.
Another key drawback in the U.S. view

was believed to be the lack of any appar
ent Iraqi commitment to pay reparations
for war damage.
Prime Minister John Major today
rejected the Soviet-Iraqi plan to end the
Persian Gulf War as insufficient.
In brief remarks to reporters outside
his Downing Street office, he said the
plan was "certainly an improvement" on

what Iraq had offered before but was still
"not good enough."
Mtyor did not elaborate on his objec
tions. He said he and his Cabinet col
leagues would analyze the plans' details.
Up on the northern desert front, 72
British artillery pieces and battery after
battery of U.S. rocket launchers opened
fire on targets deep in Iraqi-held territory,
in one of the heaviest barrages of the war.
Helicopter gunships streaked north of
the frontier and blasted Iraqi guns and
armored vehicles, and American ground
troops were venturing into Kuwait and
Iraq on reconnaissance forays, the U.S.

command said. Meanwhile, seven Ameri
cans were killed in a helicopter accident.
The command said the allies' stepped
up cross-border activity was "shaping the
battlefield" — in a prelude to an all-out
ground offensive to push Iraq's occupa
tion army out of Kuwait.
Kuwait's exiled emir, Sheik Jaber al-
Ahmed al-Sabah, issued a message to his
armed forces declaring, "The hour of sal
vation is near." But the news from
Moscow left open the possibility a ground
war might be avoided.

On Monday, Gorbachev had pre
sented the Soviet peace plan to Iraq's
foreign minister, Tariq Aziz. The Sovi
ets briefed the Desert Storm allies on
the plan, but did not publicly disclose
its details, except to say it abided by
U.N. Security Council resolutions
demanding unconditional withdrawal
from Kuwait.
After consulting with President
Saddam Hussein and the rest of the
Iraqi leadership, Aziz returned to
Moscow late yesterday and hurried to
a session with Gorbachev.
Early today, the Soviet president's
spokesman, Vitaly Ignatenko,
announced that the two sides had
agreed on an eight-point peace plan,
starting with Iraqi agreement to a full
and unconditional withdrawal from
Kuwait, monitored by the United

Nations. The pullout would begin the
second day after hostilities end.
Ignatenko said the Soviet-Iraqi plan
also provides that economic sanctions
against Baghdad would be ended after
withdrawal of two-thirds of Iraq's
forces; all prisoners of war would be
released immediately; and anti-Iraq
U.N. resolutions would be canceled
after a withdrawal.
He said further details would be
worked out and presented to the U.N.
Security Council later today.
Saddam previously had sought to
link simultaneous withdrawals of Iraq
from Kuwait and of Israel from occu
pied Arab lands. But the plan outlined
by Ignatenko did not include any men
tion of such linkage to the Palestinian
issue.
The Bush administration official
who called the plan unacceptable said,

"The main conclusion is that the
Soviet proposal represents a
conditional withdrawal, which is
clearly beyond the scope of the U.N.
resolutions."
The Americans had told the Soviets
a peace plan must also include a con
tinued arms embargo against Iraq,
neutralization of Iraq's nuclear
weapons production potential, and a
guarantee that Iraq will pay war dam
ages, a Bush administration official
said yesterday.
After announcement of the plan,
one knowledgeable U.S. official said,
"The Iraqis are talking about voiding
other U.N. resolutions, including repa
rations for the damage they did to
Kuwait. That, essentially, would be let
ting them get away with it."
The U.S. administration also had
told the Soviets the plan must include

a withdrawal timetable of less than
one week — apparently intended to be
too short for withdrawal of all Iraqi
heavy weapons from Kuwait.
Ignatenko did not announce the length
of the timetable under the Soviet-Iraqi
plan.
Some in Washington also suggest
that the allies make Saddam's removal
from power an additional objective,
but an administration official said, "If
we really diminish him, and there's all
kinds of restraints on him, he's not
that dangerous."
Egypt's U.N. ambassador, Amre
Moussa, said that if the plan is clari
fied, "it will be a very important first
step toward a political settlement."
The Saudi U.N. ambassador, Samir
Shihabi, said simply, "Too many condi
tions."
