# Mayors resent Bush block-grant proposal

WASHINGTON (AP) - May
ors say that President Bush's pro
posal to shift billions of dollars in
federal programs to the states is
one more example of the national
government's abandonment of
cities.
"This latest formulation of
New Federalism is — once again
— no federalism," New York
Mayor David N. Dinkins told the
House and Senate Budget com
mittees on Wednesday. "It leaves
cities to fend for themselves."
Dinkins and two other mayors
complained that Bush's proposal
to roll $15 billion for federal pro
grams into block grants to the
states will pit cities against state
governments.
"If the governors and mayors
turn on each other, maybe they
won't turn on the WTiite House,"
said Boston Mayor Raymond
Flynn. "To me, this isn't federal
ism, it's a fraud."
The mayors also worried that
some state governments would
hold back the money.
"There is a serious risk that

the temptation in state capitals
will prove too great — and money
that now funds much-needed ser
vices in our cities will be spent on
other state programs, supplanting
state funds that are currently
devoted to providing services,"
Dinkins said.
In his 1992 budget released last
month, President Bush proposed
giving directly to the states at
least $15 billion that the federal
government would normally allo
cates to education, water treat
ment construction, health and
human services, housing and law
enforcement. /1
The states would have greater
flexibility in how they use the
money, and the concept should cut
red tape, the administration says.
But the mayors expressed fear
that such grants would actually
increase the layers of bureaucracy.
For example, Dinkins said,
Community Development Block
Grants — used by some cities for
housing and downtown develop
ment — are currently distributed
directly to city governments.
