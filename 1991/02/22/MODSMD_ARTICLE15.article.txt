New research center
will keep Stanford
on the cutting edge

THE UNIVERSITY adminis
tration should be lauded for
its recent decision to open a
research center in Kyoto, Japan.
The center will keep Stanford on
the cutting edge of scientific and
technological research and will be
another step toward the goal of
becoming a "world university."
Many specific aspects of the new
Kyoto research center make it
especially impressive. For example,
the study of Japanese management
techniques and emerging technolo
gies will fit well with the Univer
sity's existing strengths in busi
ness and engineering. The chosen
director for the program, Ken-ichi
Imai, is a world-renowned expert
on industrial organization and
technological innovation.
And most importantly, Stanford
will become the first U.S. univer
sity to establish a research center
in Japan, thus enhancing its repu
tation as an international univer
sity and helping to attract new fac
ulty and grants in the future.
Indeed, the success of the
research program will hinge on
Stanford professors' taking advan
tage of the new opportunities
offered in Kyoto.
The need to establish such
research centers is great. For years
Japanese universities have been
encouraging their best scholars to
come to the United States to study
management styles and to share
U.S. scientific research.
Now that Japan has caught up
to — even surpassed — the United
States in business and engineering,
it is appropriate for U.S. scholars to
travel to Japan and learn from

their former pupils.
Transforming the traditionally
unidirectional flow of information
into a reciprocal exchange can only
strengthen the economic and polit
ical ties between the two countries.
The Kyoto decision is also signif
icant for another reason: It contin
ues a long-term trend of moving
the focus of the University's over
seas programs away from Europe
and toward a truly global design.
Within the last few years, Stan
ford has closed down two of its
European campuses — in Vienna,
Austria and Tours, France — and
opened two new campuses in dif
ferent regions — in Kyoto and in
Santiago, Chile.
While the closures of the Euro
pean campuses were both contro
versial, the new programs have
proven to be very popular.
Given the University's commit
ment to multiculturalism, as well
as the increasing importance of
non-European areas of the world,
the trend away from European
programs is a sensible one.
Unfortunately, the change is a
slow one; currently, only two out of
10 overseas programs offer a non-
European alternative.
New programs require years to
set up and strong faculty support
as well as funding that is very
scarce these days. We hope the fac
ulty and administration will con
sider the Third World and the
Pacific Rim when the opportunity
to open another overseas campus
arises.
Until that time, the new Kyoto
research center is a promising sign
that Stanford continues to look
beyond Europe in its overseas pro
jects. This sign, as well as the tan
gible benefits to Stanford's eco
nomics, business, science and engi
neering programs, makes the
research center a welcome addition
to Stanford's family.
