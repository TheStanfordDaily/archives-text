# Kofi Bruce & Andrew Katz
## Random as we wanna be 
### 
ID: I WANT TO WATCH Navy Seals!
Ego: As nice as that would be, you
know that we have a midterm tomor
row.
Id: BFD! (Big Furry Dog) I want to see
some pointless violence.
Ego: After we've studied for the
midterm.
Id: I wanna watch it NOW!
Ego: Okay! Okay! Stop picking my butt!
Id: Uh-oh! Superego is coming! Think of
an excuse, quick!
Superego: Navy Seals? For shame! How
are we going to pass this class and go to
Med School if you insist upon watching
this garbage?! What do you have to say for
yourself?!
Ego: Well, I was just thinking. . . . We just
had a midterm yesterday. We deserve to
de-stress. Besides, the test is multiple
choice. If we bomb it, we can kick butt on
the final. And if we bomb the final, the
course won't show up on our transcript,
and we can take it again next quarter.
Even if we never pass it and don't com
plete our Med. School requirements, we
can always become a welder.
Id: Good one! I think Superego fell for it!
In case you haven't guessed, this
installment of Why People Do Dumb
Things will discuss: RATIONALIZA
TION.
A rationalization is the internalization
of the bullpucky we told our parents
when we were late for dinner. Rational
ization warps reality to satisfy the desires
of the id and deny the guilt trip imposed
by the superego.
Let us enter the minds of some ratio
nalizers and watch some of these meaty
psychoses in progress.

1. You are a desperately horny student.
You complain about not seeing any action
since freshman year. You refuse to date.
You are running out of excuses.
Rationalization: People don't date at
Stanford. Dating is a patriarchal tradition
passed down to us by horny white males
who don't understand this campus' liber
ated atmosphere. I haven't found Mr./ Ms.
Right yet. I have two midterms tomorrow.
Result: You stay home and pick your
nose. You sit around, talking with mem
bers of the opposite sex about how horny
you both are. Afterward, you read Hegel
in bed 'til you fall asleep. You call yourself
pathetic.
2. You are a large research university
in Northern California. You are the sub
ject of a government investigation of indi
rect cost recovery practices. You have not
yet recovered from last year's Bart Simp
son election fiasco. You feel like you are
being arrested for indecent exposure at
an orgy.
Rationalization: the government
allows other universities to charge
for dumb stuff. Had it not been for all the
cheap cases of wine, our researchers
would never have come up with the idea
for the Star Wars defense system. The
yacht is the only reason our professors do
research.
Result: Only Time Will Tell, (heh,
heh.)
3. You are a powerful Western nation
between Canada and Mexico, founded on
the proposition that the right to property
includes other countries' property. Your
huge defense industry suffers from sag
ging self esteem. Foreign oil is your bever
age of choice. A little bozo country just

invaded another bozo country. Dealing
with domestic problems bores you.
Rationalization: we could certainly use
a little beach-front property. If we don't
get oil, how will we make Vaseline?
Stormin' Norman has been dying to wear
his new desert fatigues. Saddam is a
punk. Doesn't the Constitution say some
thing about kicking butt whenever we
feel like it? A New World Order would be
moderately neato.
Result: war.
As Jeff Goldblum claimed in the Big
Chill, "Rationalization is more important
than sex. . . . Have you ever gone two
weeks without a juicy rationalization?"
We agree wholeheartedly. After all, we
have gone our entire lives without sex
(and have not gone a single minute with
out rationalizing it).
That is not to say that we couldn't
have sex if we really wanted to. We just
have other things to do that we consider
more important. We know that all that
physical stuff can't begin to compare to a
deep, platonic relationship with an inde
pendent, unattached woman.
Not to mention, there are all of these
diseases floating around. In fact, we
heard that sex is overrated. We were once
told that. . .

Contrary to popular belief, Andrew Katz
is the dog person, and Kofi Bruce is the
cat person.
