## Graduate student challenges professor's energy proposal 
### 
IN HIS LETTER DECRYING U.S.
dependence on foreign oil in the Feb.
13 Daily, Petroleum Engineering
Prof. Sullivan Marsden advocated step
ping up the tapping of domestic energy
resources. This is exactly backwards.
To reduce our vulnerability to inter
ruptions in the supply of foreign oil, we
should be leaving our domestic resources
intact.
The ideal policy would be to locate
domestic reserves but leave them
untapped. Actually, while the price of oil
is low, we should be buying cheap foreign
oil and pumping it back into the ground
in the strategic oil reserve.
Professor Marsden also claimed that

conservation cannot fuel economic
growth. This is wrong for a couple of rea
sons.
First, if gasoline taxes were raised to a
couple of dollars a gallon and the rev
enues were all returned via income tax
cuts to the income groups that paid
them, people's purchasing power, on
average, would not be reduced.
The entire effect would be to provide
the correct economic incentives to shift
to energy-efficient ways of living and
producing. These new economic chal
lenges would spur vast economic activity.
Second, the relevant concept of eco
nomic growth is not GNP growth, but
GNP growth less the social costs

imposed by pollution.
A market economy is good at produc
ing efficient behavior with respect to the
costs and benefits reflected in market
prices. If we want to maximize growth in
terms of net social costs and benefits, we
will have to impose energy taxes so that
market prices will properly reflect all
costs.
Regarding atomic energy, the problem
is not, as Marsden suggests, the politics
of nuclear waste disposal. Rather, it is
the economic inefficiency of our nuclear
plants.
Utilities are regulated monopolies
that are allowed to charge whatever it

takes to yield a set lucrative rate of
return on capital investment. To take
advantage of this regulatory environ
ment, the utilities opted for the most
capital-intensive reactor design.
Rather than build safe reactors that
could not accidentally melt down, the
utilities opted for a dangerous design
that requires multiple expensive fail-safe
systems.
High pollution taxes would surely
make clean nuclear energy economically
viable, but the next round of nuclear
plant investment should be fully ratio
nal.
