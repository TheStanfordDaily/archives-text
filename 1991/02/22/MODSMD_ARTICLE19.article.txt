# Kick the habit now: Stanford must drop tobacco investments
## 
### 
As The Daily's editorial board astutely
points out, it would be terribly inconsis
tent for Stanford to maintain its stock
holdings in tobacco companies. The
severity of the "social injury" caused by
these companies is unparalleled.
Unfortunately, most people are
unaware of just how destructive these
tobacco companies and their products
are.
According to the Centers for Disease
Control, tobacco kills 434,000 Americans
every year — not 320,000 as The Daily
claims. This figure of 434,000 is corrobo
rated by the American Cancer Society
and the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services.
Thus, tobacco accounts for more
deaths every year in this country than
homicide, suicide, AIDS, illegal drugs,
alcoholism and car accidents combined.
In fact, cigarette smoking is by far the
number one preventable cause of death

in this country, responsible for more
than one out of every five deaths.
For those who think smokers are
hurting only themselves, remember that
American taxpayers must pay $52 billion
annually — or about $6 million per hour
— to compensate for the lost productivi
ty and health care expenditures due to
cigarette smoking, according to the
Department of Health and Human Ser
vices.
Finally, a recent study by UC-San
Francisco physician Stanton Glantz indi
cates that 53,000 non-smokers die every
year in the United States from inhaling
cigarette smoke from smokers around
them.
For comparison, in all the years of the
Vietnam War, 58,000 Americans were
killed.
Before making a decision, the Board of
Trustees Advisory Commission should
know the facts on tobacco.
Given these facts, it seems impossible
that any divestment decision could be as
obvious as this one.
