Iraq's acceptance of a Soviet peace plan yes
terday may put pressure on the United States
to end the Persian Gulf war, according to sev
eral Stanford students who have lived in
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
But the students disagreed on whether the
pressure will actually have an effect on U.S.
policy and on what accepting the peace plan
would mean for the region.
"It's the best chance for peace we have seen
so far," said Sami Musa Al-Halabi, a Saudi Ara
bian graduate student in mechanical engineer
ing. But "it's not something you take for
granted without it actually happening," he
added.
Al-Halabi called Iraq's agreement to leave
Kuwait without a linked settlement of the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict a "hopeful" devel
opment.
He said he thinks that whether the allies
accept Iraq's offer to leave Kuwait will depend
on Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's motives.
