# Students react to Soviet plan

Iraq's acceptance of a Soviet peace plan yes
terday may put pressure on the United States
to end the Persian Gulf war, according to sev
eral Stanford students who have lived in
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
But the students disagreed on whether the
pressure will actually have an effect on U.S.
policy and on what accepting the peace plan
would mean for the region.
"It's the best chance for peace we have seen
so far," said Sami Musa Al-Halabi, a Saudi Ara
bian graduate student in mechanical engineer
ing. But "it's not something you take for
granted without it actually happening," he
added.
Al-Halabi called Iraq's agreement to leave
Kuwait without a linked settlement of the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict a "hopeful" devel
opment.
He said he thinks that whether the allies
accept Iraq's offer to leave Kuwait will depend
on Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's motives.
"I don't think the allies would
leave the area unless ... all prob
lems are solved and there would
be no danger anymore," he said.
The allies need to analyze
whether Saddam was offering to
pull out for reasons of "self
defense" or "to keep his army for
future use," he added.
Al-Halabi expressed concern
that if the Allies accepted the
peace proposal now, with Iraq's
army still intact, Saddam may
remain a destabilizing force in the
region.
"If they accept it — and every
thing goes back to the way it was
right before the war — what pur
pose did the war serve?" he asked.
Al-Halabi noted if Iraq begins
to pull out of Kuwait, some allied
coalition members will probably
end their support of the war.
"I think if the coalition breaks
up," the United States would not
continue the war alone, he said.
One undergraduate who grew
up in Kuwait predicted the
United States would feel
"tremendous pressure" from
Arab and European coalition
members, especially the Soviet
Union, to accept Iraq's offer to
pull out of Kuwait.
The student, who asked to
remain anonymous, said he has

relatives who fled Kuwait when
Iraq invaded.
The Soviet Union is pushing
hard for the peace plan because
conservatives in the Soviet Union
want to regain influence in the
Middle East and stop watching
the United States gain power in
the region, he said.
He said he thinks Soviet gener
als were probably warning Presi
dent Mikhail Gorbachev, "'The
U.S. is really beating us to the pot
of gold of having influence in the
area.'" He said the Soviets will
probably urge the United States
to accept the plan.
The student added that he also
thinks it is inevitable that "Arab
reconciliation" will take place.
"Of course (Arabs in the Gulf)
are going to be uneasy with Sad
dam Hussein intact on their bor
der," he said, but it would be "typ
ically Arab" to seek an agreement
that could end the conflict.
He called the Bush adminis
tration's insistence that Iraq pay
war reparations unnecessary.
The war is likely to stop, said
Mehedi Hossain, a graduate stu
dent from Bangladesh who still
keeps in electronic-mail contact
with colleagues at King Fahd Uni
versity in Dharhan, Saudi Arabia,
where he was a researcher.
"I think if it stops right now, it
is good for both parties," he said.
"You never know what would
happen in a ground war."
