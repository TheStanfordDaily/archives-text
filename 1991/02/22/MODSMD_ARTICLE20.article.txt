# They don't build 'em like they used to; Row houses should be kept

### 
On the 100 th anniversary of Stanford
University, we are planning to destroy a
part of our history.
Phi Psi house, originally the Cooksey
mansion, was built in 1900, making it 91
years old. Synergy, originally the Sigma
Nu house, was built in 1910 and will be
81 this year. The Delta Tau Delta house
is at least as old as the others.
Phi Psi represents a classic example of
"shingle style" architecture (Stanford
Observer, October 1987). Houses like
these just aren't built any more. They
should be saved.
The houses are to be torn down and
replaced with faculty housing, perhaps
even faculty condominiums. There is a
strong faculty interest in the land occu
pied by the houses now because of its
prime location — thus more is at stake
than just money.
This is the real reason that an offer
from the Delta Tau Delta fraternity last
year to repair their house, at its own

expense, was refused. Students were not
involved in the decision.
As students, we were led to believe
last spring by then-Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons that the houses
would be repaired by September 1991.
He stated that it was less expensive to
repair the houses at a cost of about
$40,000 per bed than to build new ones
at a cost of about $60,000 per bed for a
Kimball-style dormitory.
This was before the issues of the land
value and faculty housing were intro
duced. The University has gone back on
its word.
Contrary to the argument of The
Daily's editorial on Feb. 14, tearing down
the houses will not create more student
housing. The 125 spaces represented by
Synergy, Delta Tau Delta and Phi Psi will
hardly be offset by the 200 beds of Kim
ball hall.
By next year we will not be any closer
to guaranteed four-year housing.
All three houses were characterized
by a peaceful, quiet setting. If they are
torn down, valuable housing options will
be lost forever.
