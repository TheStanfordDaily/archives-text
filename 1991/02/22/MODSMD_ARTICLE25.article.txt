The Stanford Daily
The Daily urged in an editorial that Stanford
women not be deprived of their new "2:30 privi
leges." Instead of having to be in their dorms by
11:30 p.m., the female population had been granted
an extra three hours to stay out late.
Of course, you had to request to stay out that late,
and The Daily warned that "many freshmen women
are going beyond the bounds of good sense and tak
ing too many 2:30 leaves." As if they expected to be
able to stay out late every night when they went to
college. For shame!

The Stanford Daily
David Alman, activist in a national committee to
save Julius and Ethel Rosenberg from execution,
spoke in Palo Alto last night. (The Rosenbergs were
accused, most likely falsely, of giving atom bomb
secrets to the Soviets and were convicted and even
tually executed. Whoops.)
A very skeptical Daily reporter listened to Alman
try to discredit the government's case against the
Rosenbergs.
The Daily called Alman "smooth enough to virtu
ally hypnotize his audience" and described his voice
as having "the sure tone .. . that confident salesmen
seem to possess." The reporter had to admit, though,
that "he didn't seem to be a Communist, nor a Com
munist sympathizer," unfortunately.
