is Biblical.
Dear Biig,
Why is it that every time I pass the
Kimball Hall construction site I see a
lot of wood, but no cement or metal ?
What's going on here? I mean, if
there's an earthquake, wouldn't some
thing a little sturdier be better?
Dear Perplexed,
I would like, if I may, to answer this
question in the form of a parable, as
Christ would have. Excited? You
should be.
I speak to you of the tale of the oak
and the willow. There were, in the
Great Forest, two neighboring trees:
the mighty oak and the swaying wil
low.
The oak, with its thick trunk and

powerful limbs, was very proud. It
looked down upon the willow, whose
wiry branches sagged limply to the
ground. Whenever they went to the
beach the callous oak would kick sand
in the hapless willow's face. But that is
another tale.
One day a tremendous storm came
to the forest, and with it monstrous
winds that buffeted every tree with
unprecedented fury. A real whopper.

The proud oak, refusing to yield,
resisted these gales; it dug its roots
deeper into the soil and flexed its
impressive branches.
The willow, however, gave into the
storm and let its bendable branches
play in the torturous winds. The oak
thought the willow was doomed in its
carefree folly.
Yet as the wind grew stronger,
fiercer and more unforgiving, the oak
was no longer able to resist; it split in
twain, tottered, then fell to the earth
from which it had sprung so long ago.
But by swaying in the breezes, the
humble willow withstood the ferocious
storm. A bona fide victory for the
underdog.
For those of you still numb from the
bedazzling allegory, I will stoop to your
lovable but protozoan intellect and
explain.
Metal and cement construction
(much akin to the staunch oak) are
more likely to fracture under stress

than wood (symbolized by the willow).
Whereas wood will give and buckle in
an earthquake, more inflexible materi
als, such as metal and cement, will
snap like Joe Theisman's leg bones in
the event of a cataclysm.
And the last thing anyone wants,
besides maybe a "Mr. Belvedere" two
hour special, is Stanford's latest
attempt at student housing to collapse
like dear old Mrs. Fletcher. If Kimball
Hall falls, it can't get up.
Here endeth the lesson.
Dear Bug,
Who is Dark Man?
Listen, smarty-pants, I don't need
this. If I weren't so nice I'd track you
down and give you a knuckle sandwich
right in the kisser. In other words,
"Get thee behind me, Satan."
I just love Biblical themes.

No, my name's not 'baby.' It's Bug —

all questions to the Storke Publications
