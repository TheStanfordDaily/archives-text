# A 						pretty swell trip
## 
### Ken Wharton Staff writer 
Last weekend I had the privi
lege of road-tripping to Los Ange
les, happy home of palm trees,
smog and brake lights. Like many
tourists, I decided to pay a visit to
that mystical, magical kingdom
where anyone with enough money
can leave the walls of reality
behind and enter a realm of fan
tasy and intrigue: the lair of the
street-side drug dealers.
But we ended up going to Dis
neyland instead.
I hadn't been to the happiest
place on earth for about eight
years, but it hadn't changed
much, other than the fact that
this time I had to pay my own way.
Yes, it was still jam-packed
with more people than most coun
tries have citizens. I mean, these
lines were longer than Gor
bachev's motorcade. They were
longer than all of the New Kids'
veins, arteries and capillaries
ripped out of their bodies and laid
end to end.
And that was just to use the
bathroom.
But despite the crowds, I
noticed that everyone was smil
ing. I'm not sure if this was some
thing they put in the water, or just
the feeling that nothing bad could
possibly happen while surrounded
by grown men dressed as giant
chipmunks. Everyone seemed to
be genuinely happy.
Sure, there were exceptions,
like the guy who threw up on
Space Mountain, but on the whole
it was a wonderful place to be.
Here are some highlights:
• Main Street U.S.A.: This is
the part of Disneyland which
everyone sprints through as
quickly as possible in order to get
to all the fun stuff. I actually
caught a glimpse of some sort of
parade, but I was too busy shov
ing aside little kids to tell what
was going on.
• Tomorrow Land: Star
Tours was way cool, but when
your ship comes under attack by
imperial fighters, don't stand up
and scream, "AHHH!! WE'RE
ALL GOING TO DIE!!!." They
didn't like that very much.
Space Mountain looked fun
too, but when we were getting
close to the front of the line, the
smell finally hit the crowd. They
had to shut down the ride, turn on
the lights and mop up the mess. I
never did get to ride it. Maybe
they should get some of those
early warning chickens . ..
• Fantasy Land: Although
the Tea Cups was a bad ride to go
on after lunch (in my case, a $3 ice
cream sandwich), you get to man
ually spin your own cup, which
makes it far better than the cheap
Tilt-O-Wheel imitations.
We also went on It's A Small
World, which just didn't do it for
me. I'm sorry, but being sur
rounded by billions of smiling
children singing in unison for 10
minutes is enough to unhinge
anvone's sanity. Fortunately, we

followed this up with Mr. Toad's
Wild Ride, which in my opinion is
the best ride at Disneyland.
• Adventure Land: Pirates of
the Caribbean is not only a great
ride, but also has one of the best
soundtracks in the park. At least
it got that damn Small World song
out of my head. Plus, it has a
great message for the kiddies:
chase women, drink heavily and
kill people who bother you.
Adventure Land also has some
thing for all you people who love
being herded like cattle: The
Swiss Family Robinson's Tree
House. This "attraction" consists
of one huge line! Sure, it gets peo
ple out of the way, but you'd think
they could do something more
active, like releasing savage wild
animals into the crowd.
• Frontier Land: Due to an
extensive wall of human flesh, we
never made it over to this part of
the park. I was bummed about
this, because I really wanted to
take the authentic motor-powered
raft over to Tom Sawyer's Island
and see how long I could hide out
in the caves before someone found
me and kicked me out of the park.
All too soon the day was over,
and we stumbled wearily out the
gate to reality, got our nifty invis
ible hand stamp, ran over to the
black lights to find out what it
said and reflected on what an awe
some day we had had in the magic
kingdom.
And I'm not just saying that
because they paid me off. I'm say
ing that in case Disney's lawyers
happen to read The Daily.
