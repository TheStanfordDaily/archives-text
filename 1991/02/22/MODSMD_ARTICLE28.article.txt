## Baseball to battle ASU in big series

Throw those basketball
sneakers back into the closet
and pull out your suntan
lotion, sunglasses and tickets

If Mother Nature won't let
us have rain, we might as well
cancel winter, pronounce it
spring and let the baseball
games begin.
Stanford's baseball team
can't promise blue skies, but
the second-ranked Cardinal
can guarantee heated battles
every weekend in the Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division
schedule.
The Six-Pac, as the mini
conference has been known
since its creation in 1979, is
undisputably the strongest
conference in the college game.
Five of its six teams are ranked
in the top 30, with half the
league in the top 10. Every
team is above .500, with Stan
ford leading the pack at 13-3.
Stanford and third-ranked
Arizona State, the top teams in
the toughest conference,
square off this weekend in a
three-gdme series that initiates
the 30-game Six-Pac season.
Both teams were ranked No. 1
in a pre-season poll, and either
could win the College World
Series. When Stanford won its

last national title, in 1988, it
defeated the Sun Devils 9-4 in
the championship.
But it is also possible that
neither team will win the Six-
Pac, even if they play well. Last
year four of the six teams
advanced to the Regionals,
while Stanford fared best, fin
ishing third in the nation.
"It's going to be a very inter
esting race," said Stanford
coach Mark Marquess. "All six
teams have played well in non
conference games. We weren't
expecting a drop-off in the
league, but there is less experi
ence this year overall."
Marquess, who began the
year saying his team didn't
deserve its No. 1 ranking, still
considers Arizona State the
favorite, followed by USC,
Stanford, California, UCLA
and Arizona. But he is pleased
with the development of his
team and considers the Cardi
nal "ahead of schedule."
"Arizona State still has to be
the favorite. They have one all
conference pitcher coming back
and the Player of the Year
returning too," said Marquess.
But he stressed that the con
ference race will depend on
pitching. "Pitching is what will
decide it. A lot of teams have
young pitchers they will be
