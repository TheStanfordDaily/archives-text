## Baseball to battle ASU in big series

Throw those basketball
sneakers back into the closet
and pull out your suntan
lotion, sunglasses and tickets
to Sunken Diamond.
If Mother Nature won't let
us have rain, we might as well
cancel winter, pronounce it
spring and let the baseball
games begin.
Stanford's baseball team
can't promise blue skies, but
the second-ranked Cardinal
can guarantee heated battles
every weekend in the Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division
schedule.
The Six-Pac, as the mini
conference has been known
since its creation in 1979, is
undisputably the strongest
conference in the college game.
Five of its six teams are ranked
in the top 30, with half the
league in the top 10. Every
team is above .500, with Stan
ford leading the pack at 13-3.
Stanford and third-ranked
Arizona State, the top teams in
the toughest conference,
square off this weekend in a
three-gdme series that initiates
the 30-game Six-Pac season.
Both teams were ranked No. 1
in a pre-season poll, and either
could win the College World
Series. When Stanford won its

last national title, in 1988, it
defeated the Sun Devils 9-4 in
the championship.
But it is also possible that
neither team will win the Six-
Pac, even if they play well. Last
year four of the six teams
advanced to the Regionals,
while Stanford fared best, fin
ishing third in the nation.
"It's going to be a very inter
esting race," said Stanford
coach Mark Marquess. "All six
teams have played well in non
conference games. We weren't
expecting a drop-off in the
league, but there is less experi
ence this year overall."
Marquess, who began the
year saying his team didn't
deserve its No. 1 ranking, still
considers Arizona State the
favorite, followed by USC,
Stanford, California, UCLA
and Arizona. But he is pleased
with the development of his
team and considers the Cardi
nal "ahead of schedule."
"Arizona State still has to be
the favorite. They have one all
conference pitcher coming back
and the Player of the Year
returning too," said Marquess.
But he stressed that the con
ference race will depend on
pitching. "Pitching is what will
decide it. A lot of teams have
young pitchers they will be
counting on to get the job done,"
he said.
"Arizona State probably plays
the toughest schedule in the
nation, but a lot of it is at home,"
said Marquess. "They're real
tough. They have a lot of talent."
The Sun Devils, 20-10 and sec
ond behind the Cardinal last year,
have a future major league out
field with National Player of the
Year Mike Kelly (.376, 21 home
runs, 82 runs batted in in 1990),
Jim Austin (.358, 17 HR, 57 RBI),
and Tommie Adams (.310, 13 HR,
51 RBI). But the presence of
returning AU-Six-Pac pitcher
Sean Rees is what makes the Sun
Devils the team to beat.
"Offensively they are very pow
erful, and you know they are
going to consistently hit the ball.
At times they may be a little soft
defensively and in pitching, but
it's really going to boil down to
pitching."
USC, 18-12 and third in the
Six-Pac last year and currently
ranked No. 10, doesn't have the
offensive punch of ASU and lost
much of its run production - seven
players - to the major league draft,
but will be a dangerous club if its
untested pitching holds together.
Junior Jackie Nickell has worked
his way onto the pitching rota
tion, joining seniors Jeff Cirillo
and Phil Kendall.
California suffered the worst
year ever in the history of the Six-
Pac with a 3-27 record last year,
but in 1991 the Golden Bears
have improved their pitching
from horrendous to passing and
are ranked No. 21.
"Everyone knows Cal is a good
offensive club, the question is
whether they have enough pitch
ing to win. But they've had some
big wins in the last few weeks,"
said Marquess.
Catcher Mike Harrison and
first baseman Jon Zuber lead the
Bears offensively, while Zuber has
added three saves as a pitcher. If
the Bears can hold opponents
under eight runs per game - their
team earned run average last year
- they will win many more than
three games and could end up in
the middle of the Six-Pac.
Arizona, 11-19 and fifth a year
ago, is ranked No. 30, but the
Wildcats will have a hard time
penetrating the upper echelons of
the Six-Pac. Speedsters Damon
Mashore (.352, 4 HR in 1991) and
J.J. Northan (.311, 11 SB) make
the Wildcat attack exciting, but
Arizona lacks the power pitching
to make a run at the top.
