.357. After being swept at No. 5 Florida State, the Sun Devils took
two of three from No. 8 Texas. Tuesday, the Devils were defeated
12-6 by unranked Grand Canyon College.
CARDINAL UPDATE — Pitchers Jamie Sepeda and John Reid have
been less effective their last two starts, but the Cardinal has a
strong bullpen, with RHP Aaron Dorlarque leading the Six-Pac
with a 0.79 ERA, and RHP Scott Weiss tops in strikeouts, with
34. First baseman David McCarty leads the league with 8 home
runs and is among the leaders with a 441 average and 17 RBIs.
