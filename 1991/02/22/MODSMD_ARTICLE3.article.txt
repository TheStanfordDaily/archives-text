# Centennial Campaign beats billion mark
## Kennedy responds to press criticism

Why Stanford?
With four federal agencies
probing Stanford's indirect cost
policies, University President
Donald Kennedy attempted to
answer that question at yester
day's Faculty Senate meeting.
Kennedy suggested several pos
sible reasons why Stanford's indi
rect cost policies had become the
subject of so much government
and press attention during the
last several months.
First, he said, Stanford, being a
well-known research university, is
"talked about a lot. That makes us
a natural choice."
He then pointed to an article
that appeared in Science maga
zine last April. The three-page
story said Stanford's science fac
ulty had been "pushed to the

Despite a nationwide recession and war in the
Persian Gulf, Stanford's Centennial Campaign
broke the $1 billion dollar mark last month, and
organizers say it will likely exceed its $1.1 billion
goal.
Although several key fund-raising areas still lag
behind, the six-year-long campaign had amassed
$1,054 billion as of Jan. 31 and is running well ahead
of schedule, said administrators from the Office of
Development during yesterday's Faculty Senate
meeting.
If the campaign continues at its present rate,
organizers predict it may overshoot its goals by as
much as $142 million. The six-year fund raising
drive is scheduled to end Oct. 1, 1991, the 100 th
anniversary of the University's opening day.
Centennial Campaign organizers said they plan to
use next fall and winter as a follow-up period to com
plete the effort.
"We are going to succeed in the most ambitious
private fund-raising program ever conducted by a
university," said University President Donald
Kennedy during the meeting.
Although the Centennial Campaign is ahead of
schedule in reaching its overall goal, it will have to
push hard during its final year to meet its other
stated aims, organizers said.

brink of open revolt" by the Uni
versity's rising indirect cost rate
and quoted several well-known
Stanford researchers.
The article itself was fair,
Kennedy said, but the headline
and first few paragraphs sensa
tionalized the issue somewhat.
Third, Kennedy said, much of
the controversy has been sparked
by Paul Biddle, who arrived as the
campus representative of the
Office of Naval Research in Octo
ber 1988. The naval office is
responsible for overseeing Stan
ford's federal research grants.
Since his arrival, Biddle has
made numerous allegations about
wrongdoing, including the claim
that a "cozy" relationship
between Stanford and the Navy
allowed the University to overbill
the government for indirect costs
by $200 million during the last
decade.
Biddle "has some very strong
and, indeed, some very wild
views" that attract a lot of atten
tion, Kennedy said.
Kennedy said he found no rea
son to believe Stanford had been
considerably more aggressive
than other schools in its indirect
cost policies. Some government
officials have argued that the
unusually large number of
accounting agreements, called
memoranda of understanding,
that Stanford has with the gov
ernment is a sign of coziness.
Kennedy said he was "at a loss"
to understand this interpretation.

Stanford has close to 100 such
accounting agreements, while no
other university has more than
eight.
"It's bad to write things
down?" he asked rhetorically.
While Stanford's indirect cost
rate is among the highest in the
nation, it is not any higher than
that of several other comparable
institutions, he said. If Stanford
were so much more aggressive
than other universities, one would
expect Stanford's indirect cost
rate to be much higher as a result,
Kennedy argued. That, he said, is
not the case.
The intense federal scrutiny
has brought to light several short
comings in the University's
accounting system, Kennedy reit
erated yesterday. He said the Uni
versity is considering several
improvements.
"I don't think they will be cost
less," he noted.
The fallout from the contro
versy has not been as severe as
some might expect, Kennedy indi
cated.
"Our friends are still very
strongly our friends," Kennedy
said, basing his comments on sev
eral alumni visits around the
country after the story hit the
press. Kennedy returned to cam
pus yesterday after a trip to Wash
ington, D.C. and Chicago.
He reported that there have
been "no major signs of defection"
from donors. Last month's fund
raising was the strongest in the
University's history, he said.
Kennedy also noted that he had
received only one letter from a
major donor expressing dissatis
faction with the University.

Kennedy said, "There is still
much to do, but our energy is not
flagging â€” the month just con
cluded was our best January in
history."
The Centennial Campaign
needs to bring in $92 million to
reach its $570 million goal for
"featured objectives," which pri

marily fund endowments for key
long-term projects.
Also, fund-raisers must con
tact 6,000 more potential donors
to meet the campaign goal of per
sonally soliciting 14,000 alumni
and friends of Stanford.
"Our last year will have to be
our best," said Vice President for
Development John Ford.
Fund raisers have already met
or exceeded their goals in such
targeted categories as student

residences, athletic facilities and
public service programs.
Although fund raising for new
student residences was temporar
ily dropped from the Centennial
Campaign goals, the effort was
picked up by the Board of
Trustees. Their fund raising has
now exceeded the original goal by
114 percent, enabling such pro
jects as Kimball Hall to continue.
The campaign has almost
reached its targeted amounts for
such categories as endowed schol
arships and fellowships and non-
Humanities and Sciences profes
sorships.
However, other objectives,
including undergraduate re

search, Humanities and Sciences
professorships and earthquake
recovery, still lag considerably.
In an effort to meet these less
successful objectives, Centennial
Campaign organizers have
devised several new strategies.
Fund-raising efforts will now
concentrate on a few of the key
areas that are lagging signifi
cantly, including the refurbishing
of the earthquake-damaged Stan
ford Museum, and endowments
for undergraduate research and
overseas studies.
In addition, both people who
have not yet given and those who
already done so will be encour
aged to donate more.

The campaign has almost
reached its targeted amounts for
such categories as endowed schol
arships and fellowships and non-
Humanities and Sciences profes
sorships.
However, other objectives,
including undergraduate re

search, Humanities and Sciences
professorships and earthquake
recovery, still lag considerably.
In an effort to meet these less
successful objectives, Centennial
Campaign organizers have
devised several new strategies.
Fund-raising efforts will now
concentrate on a few of the key
areas that are lagging signifi
cantly, including the refurbishing
of the earthquake-damaged Stan
ford Museum, and endowments
for undergraduate research and
overseas studies.
In addition, both people who
have not yet given and those who
already done so will be encour
aged to donate more.
Why Stanford?
With four federal agencies
probing Stanford's indirect cost
policies, University President
Donald Kennedy attempted to
answer that question at yester
day's Faculty Senate meeting.
Kennedy suggested several pos
sible reasons why Stanford's indi
rect cost policies had become the
subject of so much government
and press attention during the
last several months.
First, he said, Stanford, being a
well-known research university, is
"talked about a lot. That makes us
a natural choice."
He then pointed to an article
that appeared in Science maga
zine last April. The three-page
story said Stanford's science fac
ulty had been "pushed to the

Despite a nationwide recession and war in the
Persian Gulf, Stanford's Centennial Campaign
broke the $1 billion dollar mark last month, and
organizers say it will likely exceed its $1.1 billion
goal.
Although several key fund-raising areas still lag
behind, the six-year-long campaign had amassed
$1,054 billion as of Jan. 31 and is running well ahead
of schedule, said administrators from the Office of
Development during yesterday's Faculty Senate
meeting.
If the campaign continues at its present rate,
organizers predict it may overshoot its goals by as
much as $142 million. The six-year fund raising
drive is scheduled to end Oct. 1, 1991, the 100 th
anniversary of the University's opening day.
Centennial Campaign organizers said they plan to
use next fall and winter as a follow-up period to com
plete the effort.
"We are going to succeed in the most ambitious
private fund-raising program ever conducted by a
university," said University President Donald
Kennedy during the meeting.
Although the Centennial Campaign is ahead of
schedule in reaching its overall goal, it will have to
push hard during its final year to meet its other
stated aims, organizers said.

brink of open revolt" by the Uni
versity's rising indirect cost rate
and quoted several well-known
Stanford researchers.
The article itself was fair,
Kennedy said, but the headline
and first few paragraphs sensa
tionalized the issue somewhat.
Third, Kennedy said, much of
the controversy has been sparked
by Paul Biddle, who arrived as the
campus representative of the
Office of Naval Research in Octo
ber 1988. The naval office is
responsible for overseeing Stan
ford's federal research grants.
Since his arrival, Biddle has
made numerous allegations about
wrongdoing, including the claim
that a "cozy" relationship
between Stanford and the Navy
allowed the University to overbill
the government for indirect costs
by $200 million during the last
decade.
Biddle "has some very strong
and, indeed, some very wild
views" that attract a lot of atten
tion, Kennedy said.
Kennedy said he found no rea
son to believe Stanford had been
considerably more aggressive
than other schools in its indirect
cost policies. Some government
officials have argued that the
unusually large number of
accounting agreements, called
memoranda of understanding,
that Stanford has with the gov
ernment is a sign of coziness.
Kennedy said he was "at a loss"
to understand this interpretation.

Stanford has close to 100 such
accounting agreements, while no
other university has more than
eight.
"It's bad to write things
down?" he asked rhetorically.
While Stanford's indirect cost
rate is among the highest in the
nation, it is not any higher than
that of several other comparable
institutions, he said. If Stanford
were so much more aggressive
than other universities, one would
expect Stanford's indirect cost
rate to be much higher as a result,
Kennedy argued. That, he said, is
not the case.
The intense federal scrutiny
has brought to light several short
comings in the University's
accounting system, Kennedy reit
erated yesterday. He said the Uni
versity is considering several
improvements.
"I don't think they will be cost
less," he noted.
The fallout from the contro
versy has not been as severe as
some might expect, Kennedy indi
cated.
"Our friends are still very
strongly our friends," Kennedy
said, basing his comments on sev
eral alumni visits around the
country after the story hit the
press. Kennedy returned to cam
pus yesterday after a trip to Wash
ington, D.C. and Chicago.
He reported that there have
been "no major signs of defection"
from donors. Last month's fund
raising was the strongest in the
University's history, he said.
Kennedy also noted that he had
received only one letter from a
major donor expressing dissatis
faction with the University.

Kennedy said, "There is still
much to do, but our energy is not
flagging â€” the month just con
cluded was our best January in
history."
The Centennial Campaign
needs to bring in $92 million to
reach its $570 million goal for
"featured objectives," which pri

marily fund endowments for key
long-term projects.
Also, fund-raisers must con
tact 6,000 more potential donors
to meet the campaign goal of per
sonally soliciting 14,000 alumni
and friends of Stanford.
"Our last year will have to be
our best," said Vice President for
Development John Ford.
Fund raisers have already met
or exceeded their goals in such
targeted categories as student

residences, athletic facilities and
public service programs.
Although fund raising for new
student residences was temporar
ily dropped from the Centennial
Campaign goals, the effort was
picked up by the Board of
Trustees. Their fund raising has
now exceeded the original goal by
114 percent, enabling such pro
jects as Kimball Hall to continue.
The campaign has almost
