Why Stanford?
With four federal agencies
probing Stanford's indirect cost
policies, University President
Donald Kennedy attempted to
answer that question at yester
day's Faculty Senate meeting.
Kennedy suggested several pos
sible reasons why Stanford's indi
rect cost policies had become the
subject of so much government
and press attention during the
last several months.
First, he said, Stanford, being a
well-known research university, is
"talked about a lot. That makes us
a natural choice."
He then pointed to an article
that appeared in Science maga
zine last April. The three-page
story said Stanford's science fac

Despite a nationwide recession and war in the
Persian Gulf, Stanford's Centennial Campaign
broke the $1 billion dollar mark last month, and
organizers say it will likely exceed its $1.1 billion
goal.
Although several key fund-raising areas still lag
behind, the six-year-long campaign had amassed
$1,054 billion as of Jan. 31 and is running well ahead
of schedule, said administrators from the Office of
Development during yesterday's Faculty Senate
meeting.
If the campaign continues at its present rate,
organizers predict it may overshoot its goals by as
much as $142 million. The six-year fund raising
drive is scheduled to end Oct. 1, 1991, the 100 th
anniversary of the University's opening day.
Centennial Campaign organizers said they plan to
use next fall and winter as a follow-up period to com
plete the effort.
"We are going to succeed in the most ambitious
private fund-raising program ever conducted by a
university," said University President Donald
Kennedy during the meeting.
Although the Centennial Campaign is ahead of
schedule in reaching its overall goal, it will have to
push hard during its final year to meet its other
stated aims, organizers said.
