TEMPE, Ariz. — The Stanford
men's basketball team must have
had a huge sense of dtja vu after
last night's game at Arizona
State, for the contest reeked of all
that has gone wrong on the road
for the Cardinal in 1991.

Sun Devils 75
Cardinal 57

There was the out-of-sync
offense, as the Cardinal could get
absolutely nothing to work. There
was the inability to stop anything
the Sun Devils did at the other
end of the floor. There was (need
less to say) lousy officiating.
And, yet again, there was a
loss.
"They had 10 days to prepare
for us," Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery said after his team's
75-57 loss, "and the things we got
last time we weren't able to do
this time." Unfortunately for
Stanford, "last time" was three
weeks ago, when the Devils held
the Cardinal to 14 first-half points
and went on to an ugly 58-47 win.

"We talked about this being an
important week for us," said ASU
coach Bill Frieder, whose team is
now 15-8 and in a four-way tie for
sixth in the Pacific 10 Conference
at 6-7. "This was a big, big win for
us in a must game.
"I think all the games left are
must games for everyone, at least
for everyone with a shot at finish
ing in the upper half of the league
and making the NCAA tourna
ment."
The Sun Devils are prime can
didates to do both, for they play
three of their final five games at
home. ASU plays Cal (11-13) at
home on Sunday, then has two
games against both Oregon and
Oregon State to close out the sea
son. If the Sun Devils finish well,
their strong non-conference
schedule will most likely get them
into the NCAA's postseason bash.
In contrast, Stanford (14-11, 7-
8) is probably headed for a
National Invitation Tournament
berth — if the Cardinal can come
up with at least one win in its final
three games: at Arizona, home
against California and then at Cal
on March 7.
The Devils and the Cardinal,
then, are two teams headed to dif
ferent places — and they certainly
played that way last night. When

the Devils had the ball, they
worked, worked worked the shot
clock down before taking a shot;
when they didn't have the ball,
they swarmed out front to screw
up the passing lanes, swarmed
inside to take away any easy shots
and made life miserable for every
one wearing Cardinal.
The strategies worked won
ders: Four ASU players ended up
in double figures (led by guard
Lynn Collins* 18), and defensively
the Sun Devils had Stanford com
pletely shut down.
"They denied our return passes
really well," said Stanford's John
Patrick, who had 12 points. "One
of the key parts of our offense is
the return pass across the top of
the key, and that's what they shut
off.
"That made things tough for
us. It seemed we got most of our
points from guys going one-on
one, and that made us pretty lim
ited in our offense."
The Cardinal hit only one out
side shot in the second half, and as
for the inside, we 11...
"I think we did a good job on
(Adam) Keefe again," Frieder
said. "He always seems to kill us."
Last night it was Keefe who
kept getting killed, for every time
he touched the ball inside he dis

appeared under a wave a Devil
defenders. Six-foot-10, 250-pound
Isaac Austin had the primary
responsibility of hacking, oops,
guarding Keefe, but he got help
from every single one of the ASU
guards. Doubling down, swinging
at the ball and basically just rais
ing hell inside, the Devil guards
forced Keefe into a game-high five
turnovers.
Even when he did actually get a
shot off, Keefe had his problems:
Three times in the second half he
went up for a layup and 6-7 Jamal
Faulkner stuffed the ball back
down his throat.
Contact? Naaaahh.
"I thought they were pretty
questionable calls," said Keefe,
who finished with 18 painful
points. "I don't think Jamal
Faulkner leads the Pac-10 in
blocks per game." For the record:
(A) Faulkner, before last night,
had 22 blocks in 22 games. Last
night he had four, as the ever
exquisite Pac-10 officiating crew
swallowed their whistles every
time Keefe touched the ball; and
(B) Faulkner can't even block
Keefe cleanly in his dreams.
The non-calls were part of the
usual glorious homerism from the
officials: The Sun Devils shot 28
free throws to the Cardinal's 10,
as Keefe went to the line all of
three times despite leaving the
game with hand prints, elbow
marks and assorted bruises all
over his body.
"I want to scream, but I can't
say anything," Montgomery said
of the refereeing. Montgomery
apparently said a little something
just before the half, because he
picked up a technical foul — his
third of the season and second in
the last two games — arguing
about a foul called on Kenny
Ammann with 14 seconds left
before halftime.
The two free throws given to
ASU made the score only 34-30
Devils at the half, so they weren't
pivotal on the board, but they
might have made a difference psy
chologically.
"That was my fault," Mont
gomery said. "I've been around
too long to do something like that.
It didn't do any good, and it might
have made everyone start to think
about it."
The Cardinal should have had
other things to think about, like a
10-0 ASU run that put the Devils
up by 12 with 10 minutes left and
effectively ended the game. The
Cardinal got no closer than seven
the rest of the way as it Hailed
offensively — Stanford shot a
sorry 11-for-33 in the second half


Point guard John Patrick's twelve points weren't enough to push the Cardinal past Arizona State, as ASU
won easily 75-57.
