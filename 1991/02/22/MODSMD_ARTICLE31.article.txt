# Women's basketball beats the Devil out of Arizona State
## 
### David Hirning Senior staff writer 
It looks as though Trisha
Stevens picked the right night off.
Despite playing without its
starting center for the second con
secutive game, the defending
national champion Cardinal
unhesitatingly dismantled the
Arizona State Sun Devils last
night in Maples Pavilion, 109-61.
This time, no second-half come
back was needed as Stanford
posted its second-highest point
total this season.

Cardinal 109
Sun Devils 61

Stevens, the star senior who
did not play last Sunday against
UCLA, is suffering from nagging
tendinitis and is resting up the
next two weeks.
The 2,500 fans in attendance
may have missed familiar No. 30,
but they saw Stanford put on a
shooting clinic as the Cardinal hit
55 percent from the field and 85
percent (23-of-27) from the line.
They also saw a glimpse of the
future.
"I hate to say it, but [tonightl
was only a preview," said coach
Tara VanDerveer. "Obviously, I
don't like it when Trisha's not
playing, but we've only got her for
one more game here (at Maples)."
Stevens, who played 18 min
utes and had six points on 3-of-9
shooting in her last action at USC,
is anxious to play in tomorrow
night's contest, her final regular
season home game of her career.
"I hope they let me play Satur
day," she said. "I know the team
can do fine without me, but you
can never get these games back."
The win gave Stanford and
VanDerveer their fourth-straight
20-win season and upped their
league-leading conference mark to
13-1.
Without the solid inside scoring
of Stevens, the Cardinal turned to

the all-out, run-and-gun style that
VanDerveer preaches. The Sun
Devils, who shot just 24 percent in
the first half and a paltry 35 per
cent for the game, were left savor
ing Stanford's dust for the major
ity of the game.
Stanford cruised to a comfort
able 53-22 halftime lead and
coasted the rest of the way.
"We want to keep doing the
same things next year, keep run
ning," VanDerveer said.
To that end, VanDerveer rested
the starters for most of the second
half and saw what the future will
look like. Kelly Dougherty played
21 minutes off the bench, and
Angela Taylor had several
sparkling plays in her 14 minutes
of time.
Taylor was forced into the
point guard position when sopho
more Molly Goodenbour had to sit
the entire second half because of a
possible stress fracture in her
foot. She responded with five
assists and a three-pointer that
boosted the Cardinal over the cen
tury mark for the first time in six
games.
"Angela really doesn't play that
much point in practice because
Molly does, but when Molly was
hurt Angela just stepped up there
and did a great job," VanDerveer
said. "She hit her shot."
Taylor had a tough act to follow
in Soi\ja Henning, the All-Amer
ica candidate who dominates the
point guard spot for the Cardinal.
Henning ran the break flawlessly
in her 31 minutes of time, collect
ing seven assists with no
turnovers.
"I like to play up-tempo," said
the mild-mannered and under
stating Henning. "I thought a lot
of it was rebounding — Val (Whit
ing) was getting a lot of defensive
rebounds and starting breaks."
Indeed, oftentimes the charge
was improbably sparked by for
wards Whiting and Chris Mac-
Murdo, who combined for 11
steals (seven in the first half).
MacMurdo continually antici
pated ASU upcourt passes and
scored all six of her first half

points on break-awavs following
steals.
Whiting led all scorers with 25
points, just one shy of her career
high set last week against UCLA.
Whiting also pulled down her
usual 15 boards to form the other
half of her 12th double-double of
the season. Whiting's Herculean
efforts helped the Cardinal outre
bound ASU 39-35.
ASU is the Pacific 10 Confer
ence's top rebounding team, aver
aging three rebounds per game
more than the next best team,
USC. Stanford is currently fifth in
the Pac-10 with 42.3 boards per
game.
Julie Zeilstra, the Cardinal's
leading scorer at 19.7 points per
game, had 21 points in 20 min
utes. She sat most of the second
half.
