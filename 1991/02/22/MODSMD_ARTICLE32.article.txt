# Kostich, swimmers travel to Cal this weekend
## 
### Amy Wusterbarth Staff writer 
Alex Kostich began swimming
4000 meters a day when he was
2. What, isn't that what you did
before you learned to walk? You
probably would have if you were
in the Kostich family. His par
ents swam on the Yugoslavian
Olympic team before immigrat

ing to the United States.
Like his father, Alex is a dis
tance swimmer. But unlike his
father, he declined an invitation
to swim on the Yugoslavian
Olympic team. "After I didn't
make the U.S. team, Yugoslavia
wanted me to swim for them,"
said the younger Kostich, "I
couldn't do it. I would've felt like
a traitor."

Here at the Farm, the junior
has cut his times and strength
ened the Cardinal's performance
in distance events. Swimming
with multiple gold medalist
Janet Evans has been a big boost
to Kostich's morning routine.
"When I'm having a bad day, and
she's having a good one, she's
pretty stiff competition," said
Kostich. "She brings out the best

in me when I'm down, and I
think that's really important.
Plus, I don't want to let a girl
beat me," he says with a grin.
Much of Kostich's success is a
result of a strong work ethic.
"He doesn't have sprinting abil
ity so he does it on endurance,"
said coach Skip Kenney, "He
realized years back that he can't
just show up and be successful;
his only chance is to swim dis
tance and swim it hard."
And that's what he does —
day after day. His father's words
of advice have helped him
through many long workouts.
"He always told me, the harder
you work the more it will pay
off," said Kostich, "I figure the
more I hurt now the more fun it
will be later."
He proved his philosophy to
himself in 1987 when he won a
gold medal and set a meet record
at the Pan American Games in
the 1500 meters. The meet was
his international debut.
Although his parents made
him swim in the beginning, he
rarely resented their pressure. "I
only got mad when I was really
young and couldn't watch
Sesame Street," he said. His ded
ication after that has never fal
tered.
"People used to ask me in
high school if I felt like I was
missing out by making all these
sacrifices, but I really didn't see
them as sacrifices. I mean, in
high school how many people get
to say that they went to the Pan
Am Games and won a gold
medal? You give some, you take a

lot."
Along with stardom came the
question of burning out at such a
young age. Since he was 16 he's
been defying all rumors by per
forming consistently better
every year. "They keep saying I
can't do better than I am," said
Kostich, "It ticks me off. But the
angrier I get, the better I swim."
Right now Kostich is at the
low point in his season because
he has been working so hard. His
times are slow so the rumors
begin again. After tapering and
shaving he expects to cut 35-40
seconds off of his time in the
mile.
"I just wait till the end of the
season and then get 'em," he
says with a grin. The Pacific 10
Conference Championships, at
which he placed first in the
1,650-yard freestyle last year,
will give Kostich a chance to
repeat last year's performance
and help the Cardinal try to cap
ture their 10th consecutive team
title.
At NCAAs the competition
should be stiffen After placing
second last year, Kostich is confi
dent he'll be the first one to
reach the wall this spring. "It's
going to be tough but I think I
can do it,"he said.
After NCAAs, the interna
tional competition picks up
again. It has been four years now
since Kostich's fantastic debut at
the Pan Am Games. This sum
mer you can bet he's going to
swim his heart out. "It would
really mean a lot to me to make
that team," said Kostich.
