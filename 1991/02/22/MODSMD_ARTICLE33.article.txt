# Volleyball plays host to SDSU
## Will try to put an end to losing streak tonight 
### Kevin Jeffery Staff writer 
When Dave Goss found out
he'd been admitted to Stanford,
athletics were not his main con
cern. Playing volleyball for the
Cardinal, he thought, "would
just be icing on the cake." Two
years later, the rest of the West
ern Intercollegiate Volleyball
Association is wishing he still
felt the same.
In just his second year of col
legiate volleyball, Goss has
emerged as one of the most
respected hitters in the WIVA.
In his offensively-potent "oppo
site" position (outside hitter set
up opposite the setter), calling
him a primary weapon in the
Cardinal attack would be an
understatement.
"For me, 'opposite' is the
most fun position on the court. I
really have no passing responsi
bility, which sometimes becomes
burdensome. Plus I get to hit
from every spot in the rotation,
back row and front row, and
that's my favorite part of the
game," said Goss.
"It seemed like last year they
set me a lot to get my confidence
up. I'm getting the ball often
again this year, but now I feel
like I'm taking on more of a
leading offensive role."

Goss has, in fact, been the
leader of the Cardinal offense all
season long. His 194 kills half
way through the season is a
team-leading mark, as is his
average of 6.1 kills per game.
Those numbers are well
ahead of the offensive pace Goss
set in 1990, when he had 290
kills for .246, and his steady
improvement has impressed
Nieves.
Goss credits his development
largely to "the excellent coach
ing I've received here," and that
improvement has changed his
long-term individual and team

oriented goals in the sport.
"When I first got here, volley
ball was definitely not the most
important part of my life. Now
it is, and I think it's something
I'd like to continue after my col
legiate career is over, hopefully
on a national team level. Most of
all, I've developed a burning
desire for us to win a national
championship, and I know
that's something this club is
capable of," Goss said.
Unfortunately, the course to
that goal was severely altered
last weekend as the Cardinal
lost three straight matches on a
Southern California swing. Not
even Goss' career-high 36 kills
were enough to overcome Long
Beach State in the first match,
and Stanford never really chal
lenged UC Santa Barbara or
USC. Having lost four straight
matches, the Cardinal now
stands at 5-5 and is battling for
just a spot in post-season play.
"We met as a team after the
road trip and set new objectives
for the season. Our task at hand
is clear now, we need to win vir
tually all of our remaining
games to put ourselves in a solid
position for the post-season.
That makes our upcoming two
matches absolutely crucial,"
Goss said.
