# Netters face Arizona
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
The last event on the made-for-
TV-human-Nintendo-game
"American Gladiators" is an
obstacle course called The Elimi
nator.
At one point in this test of
strength and skill, participants
cross a balance beam while having
weighted bags tossed at them,
climb a 20-foot net, slide down a
rope and then run through a
paper wall with a three-in-four
chance of finding a large, hulking
humanoid on the other side.
The balance beam and hulking
humanoids, incidentally, pose a
somewhat tougher test than the
net and rope. For the women's
tennis team, California provided
the weighted bags in its match
with the Cardinal last Saturday.
And, next week, the National
Team Indoor will provide Stan
ford with at least two matches
against the giants of collegiate
tennis.
Today and tomorrow, however,
Arizona State and Arizona will do
their best impression of a net and
a rope. Though these are rela
tively easier tests for Stanford,
that doesn't mean they aren't
fraught with potential pitfalls.
Each year, the trip to the desert
provides the Cardinal with a pair
of tough matches. Oftentimes, the
Wildcats and Sun Devils are able
to extend Stanford into meaning
ful doubles â€” something teams
that appear to have more talent

rarely succeed in doing.
Perhaps the most noteworthy
thing about today's match against
Arizona State is that it marks the
first time since her initial colle
giate match that junior Debbie
Graham is not riding a winning
streak.
Graham lost to Emilie Viqueira
Saturday after winning 55
straight in dual-match play. By
Saturday afternoon, the streak
should be back to two.
For it own part, the Cardinal is
up to an astounding 71 wins in a
row, six in 1991. Stanford is 1-0 in
Pacific 10 Conference play and is,
as usual, a prohibitive favorite to
capture the conference crown.
