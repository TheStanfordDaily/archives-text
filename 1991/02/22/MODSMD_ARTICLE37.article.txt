Gold may be in Dave Strang's future.
"My goals are to run for Britain in the 1992
and 1996 Olympics," the Scotland native said.
His aims do not seem too lofty considering he
finished eighth in the 800 meters at last year's
NCAA championships, an event he doesn't think
is his best.
"The 1500 was always going to be my best race.
In the 1500 you need both strength and speed.
I've been lucky that I've been blessed with speed.
Now I've been working on the base work so I can
use that speed to my advantage," Strang said.
His versatility in middle distance events was
further proven last summer in Britain. Strang
ran on the silver medal 4x400 relay team at the
Commonwealth Games. In the 800 he raced
against Sebastion Coe, the world record-holder in
the event.
Living in Europe was not entirely foreign to
Strang. He was born in Scotland but grew up in
South Africa. "I'm not upset that I was brought
up there," he said. "If I hadn't been there I don't
think I'd ever have gotten into track.
"The South African situation is that most peo
ple aren't openly racist," Strang went on. "Society
has been segregated so much that you just grow
up differently. My training partners were all
black, so I was able to train with guys who were
from a different part of society. It opens your eyes
to a lot of things you don't want to believe are
actually happening."
According to Strang, his track peers faced a lot
of problems. They couldn't go to school because of
the high school boycotts. "My training partner
had his room burned down by the black student
union because he was training with Caucasians,"
Strang said.
That he lived in South Africa caused tensions
back in Britain. "When I went back straight after
high school there was a lot of animosity. People

were saying 'You're from South Africa. You're
racist."*
The same could not be said for Stanford. "The
track team was very supportive of me," Strang
said, "People at Stanford for the most part don't
judge you on where you're from but who you are."
Strang plans to train with track coach Brooks
Johnson after graduation. "This is one of the best
places in the world to train. The weather is great.
I've got great training partners and a great
coach," he said.
His visa expires in June but the Applied Earth
Sciences mqjor hopes to combine his academic
interests with track pursuits. "If I can get into
graduate school I can stay studying and keep run
ning. That kills all the birds with one big stone,"
he said.
Olympic hardware may not be the only pre
cious metals Strang knows. "Being brought up in
South Africa you live amongst mining. I want to
try to get into the mineral industry once I pack up
eveything," he said.
Strang doesn't plan to be packing soon. He
views collegiate racing as a stepping stone to the
international scene, and the first step is the Bay
Area Invitational Saturday.
"We'll be able to gauge our training from the
meet — where we are and where we need to be. By
the time it comes to the big meets like Stanford
Invite, Texas Relays, Pac-lOs and Nationals we'll
know what we have to do," Strang said.
His international experience he believes helps
him in meets like the Invitational. "I feel some
times I get into races that I know I can gauge bet
ter what's going to happen," Strang said. "It gives
me confidence and an arrogance I think is
needed."
"He's a very aggressive competitor individually
and collectively," said Johnson. "The swimmers
used to have Jeff Kostoff who pushed himself and
held his teammates accountable also. Dave is that
kind of guy."
