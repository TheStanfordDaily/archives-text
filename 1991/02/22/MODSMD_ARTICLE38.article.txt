terday and fell to sixth while
UNLV moved into first place with
a 287, an eight-shot improvement,
the Cardinal held its own with a

297. Combined with Wednesday's
296, Stanford was in eighth place
going into the final round of the

The squad was led by the fresh
men, with Notah Begay scoring an
even-par 72 for a two-day total of
146, and Casey Martin shot a 73
for a 148 total. In third place were
junior Christian Cevaer's and
sophomore Mike Milliken's two
day scores of 150, and sophomore
Dave Rutkowski's 152 rounded
out the Stanford scoring.

Coach Wally Goodwin was
pleased by his team's consistency.
"Considering the big swings in
other schools' scores, I was really
happy with our guys' play. Tomor
row we've got to pick it up a lit
tle—l'd love it if these guys could
take fifth in this tournament.
With the caliber of teams here, it
would be a big win for us," Good
win said.
