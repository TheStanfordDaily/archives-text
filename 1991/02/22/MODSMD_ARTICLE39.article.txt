# Netters win at Team Indoors
## 
### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
Despite the absence of No. 1-
player Jonathan Stark, Stanford
moved a step closer to defending
its National Team Indoor title in
Lousiville, Ky. yesterday with a 5-
2 victory over Notre Dame.
Two freshmen, Robert Devins
and Michael Flanagan, clinched
the win with a 7-6, 6-3 triumph at
No. 3 doubles over Paul Anthony
and Ryan Wenger. That victory
propelled top-seeded Stanford
into today's quarterfinal matchup
against Miami, which upset No. 8-
seed TCU 5-4 yesterday.
"Overall, I was very pleased
with the way the team played,"
Coach Dick Gould said. "Notre
Dame is a better team than when
we played them last time. (Stan
ford beat Notre Dame 8-1 in an
exhibition match in South Bend
last fall.) It was a good win for us."
The Cardinal's two losses could
have easily gone the other way. At
No. 1 singles, Alex O'Brien, who is
ranked No. 21 by the Volvo Ten
nis/Collegiate Rankings, fell to
Dave DiLucia, ranked No. 6, in a
three-set marathon, 4-6, 7-6 (7-5),
6-3.
O'Brien led in the second-set
tiebreaker, 5-3, but couldn't hold
on, losing it 7-5. The third set was
knotted at 3-3 before DiLucia
came up on the winning end of a
few crucial points, taking the set
6-3 and the match.
"It was a tough, well-played
match on both sides. Alex served
and volleyed better than I have
ever seen him," Gould said. "It
came down to a few points."
Freshman Vimal Patel also lost
a barnburner. Playing at No. 5
singles, the hard-hitting freshman
let several chances slip away,
including a 5-2 third-set lead,
eventually falling 3-6, 7-5, 7-5 to
Andy Zurcher.
But Stanford had some come
backs of its own. Sophomore
Jared Palmer, competing at No. 2,
saved a multitude of set points in
the first, coming back from triple
set point down in one game and
double-set point down in another,
before besting Chuck Coleman 7-6
(8-6), 6-4.
Despite a slow second set,
Jason Yee regained composure at
No. 4, downing Mark Schmidt 7-6
(7-4), 2-6, 6-3.
Senior co-captain Glenn

Solomon and Flanagan had an
easier time of things. Solomon,
playing at No. 3 singles, jumped
out to an early 4-1 lead and never
relinquished control, crushing
Will Forsyth, a recent transfer to
Notre Dame from Trinity, 6-3,6-2.
Flanagan, the only Cardinal to
record two wins on the afternoon,
outplayed Ron Rosas at No. 6, 6-2,
6-3.
Despite Stanford's top seeding,

Gould refused to look beyond
today's quarterfinal matchup
against Miami. "They're a great
team. Conny Falk (Miami's No. 1
player) just won the Rolex Indoor
Championships last week, and
they're good all the way down the
lineup," Gould said.
If Stanford wins today, it most
likely will meet fourth-seeded
USC in the semifinals, which will
take place Saturday afternoon.
