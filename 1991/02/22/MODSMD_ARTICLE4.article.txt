# ASSU favors gay and lesbian faculty rights
## 
### Miranda Doyle Howard Libit Staff writers 
In another marathon session, the ASSU
Senate last night passed a bill supporting
extension of married benefits to gay and les
bian faculty and staff couples.
Discussion of ASSU bylaws and quarrels
over election rules also headlined the nearly
four-and-a-half hours of debate.
Unlike the last senate meeting, which had
to concluded in the Law School courtyard so
the janitor could lock the building, senators

moved to the ASSU offices in Tresidder Union
at 10 p.m. for another hour of debate. Some
senators left the meeting and those remaining
barely formed a quorum of 11 senators when
the session resumed.
Voting at the ASSU offices, the senate
passed, by an undivided voice vote, a bill in
support of giving benefits parity to faculty and
staff in same-sex, long-term, committed rela
tionships.
The bill recommends the University allow
an employee's same-sex partner to collect the
same benefits as a legally married spouse,
including medical and dental insurance, retire

ment annuity funds and access to University
facilities.
Senate support of this bill will not directly
affect University policy, but the Faculty Senate
will soon be considering a similar proposal,
said graduate senator David Bradfute, the
bill's author. Bradfute added he hopes the
administration will be persuaded by
widespread student support and eventually
make it official policy.
"If Stanford takes this action, it is very
important because, to my knowledge, no uni-
versity in the nation offers bene
fits to same-gender couples,"
Bradfute said.
Some senators objected to the
bill's same-sex clause, which does
not extend benefits to heterosex
ual couples, as did the student
domestic partners policy the Uni
versity announced last fall. That
policy extended housing and other
benefits to domestic partners of
unmarried heterosexual and gay
and lesbian students.
Bradfute said he limited the
bill "only to same-sex couples who
would be married if possible"
because University funds are lim
ited and extending benefits to het
erosexual couples could be exceed
ingly expensive.
"It is easy to argue that this is

the most egregious inequity
because same-sex couples do not
have the opportunity for mar
riage," he added.
In other business, Elections
Commissioner Raul Lopez clari
fied previous rulings by Hearings
Officer Doreen Musson about
campaigning before the official
April 10 starting date. He said
Musson decided that if a candi
date's name appears in a student
publication before that date, "an
investigation will be started."
Musson had ruled that the can
didate could be held responsible
for premature announcements in
the press. The investigation
would not go beyond questioning
the primary source, who Lopez
defined as the reporter.
Lopez suggested that if the
reporter refused to cooperate with
the investigation, the Elections
Commission could take action. "If

a writer obstructs the investiga
tion, it is possible we can prose
cute under the Fundamental
Standard," he said.
Musson also ruled that the
commission would "appeal to the
good judgment" of the publica
tion's editors. Lopez said the rule
would make the campaign fair for
independent candidates.
However, graduate senator
Larry Augustin questioned Mus
son's ability to make valid rulings
because her appointment has not
yet been confirmed by the senate.
In a straw poll taken after
Lopez's presentation, 17 senators
expressed disagreement with the
ruling on campaigning, while
three agreed and seven abstained.
The issue of Musson's confir
mation re-emerged as the last
item before the senate adjourned.
A motion to accept Musson as the
Hearings Officer was voted down

five to two, with two abstentions.
Because the senate did not have a
quorum, Senate Chair Solina
Kwan said the vote was invalid.
The Senate also approved by a
divided voice vote a $200 interest
free loan to the Women's Center
to support the Women's Herstory
Celebration to be held in early
March. The special fee request for
the Center for the 1991-92 school
year will be increased to compen
sate for the loan.
The vote followed a nearly two
hour debate during which some
senators questioned the fiscal
responsibility of the center and an
interpretation of the bylaws. The
center needed $200 for publicity
because money from previously
earmarked for that purpose was
diverted to pay for the honoraria
of speakers at the celebration,
such as Planned Parenthood Pres
ident Faye Wattleton.
