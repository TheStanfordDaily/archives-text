TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) â€” Khalid Reeves hit five of
Arizona's nine 3-pointers and the ninth-ranked
Wildcats' balanced scoring smothered California
100-63 Thursday night to tighten their Pacific-10
Conference lead.
Reeves, a reserve freshman guard, and Brian
Williams each had 19 points while Matt Muehlebach
and Jeremy Bohen scored 13 apiece as Arizona (21-5,
10-3) made the Golden Bears (11-13, 7-8) their 60th
consecutive victim at McKale Center, the nation's
longest current home winning streak.
The Wildcats' defense and height advantage over
powered Cal as Arizona repaid the Bears for an 85-78
loss last month at Berkeley.
Arizona jumped to a 49-30 halftime lead and put
the game away with a 12-2 run at the start of the sec
ond half, fueled by two jams, a layup and a jumper by
Butch Bedi.
Cal pulled within 23 points twice after that and
trailed three times by 35 points before Arizona's Rob
Swift ended the scoring on a dunk with 40 seconds
remaining.
Cal trailed just 15-14 after Kellen Glass' layup
and free throw, but after a timeout with 11:55 left in
the opening half, Arizona went on a 14-3 run in the
next 4:46.
Reeves hit a three-pointer, Williams had a dunk
and layup, Muehlebach hit a pair of jumpers and
Sean Rooks added a jumper and free throw to give
Arizona a 29-17 lead.
With their defense forcing 13 first-half turnovers,
the Wildcats continued the pressure. Stokes dunked,
Chris Mills hit a jumper, and Muehlebach had a
three-pointer and dunk to make it 38-20.
The Wildcats' biggest first-half lead was at 44-24
on Stokes' layup with 2:09 remaining.
