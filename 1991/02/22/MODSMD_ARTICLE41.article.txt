The Stanford women's gymnastics
team headed for Oregon this morning
for their second big invitational of the
season. The Cardinal will meet the Uni
versity of Arizona, Boise State, and host
ing Oregon State in Corvallis for the
Shanico Invitational on Saturday night.
The gymnasts hope to turn around
their losing streak, which was extended
by their disheartening loss last weekend
at the Southwest Cup in Tempe, Ari
zona. The Cardinal, despite a valiant
effort, finished in last place behind three
excellent teams â€” Arizona State, Utah
State, and Cal State-Fullerton. One of
the few highlights of last weekend's
meet was an outstanding third place fin
ish in the all-around competition for
freshman sensation Kerri Kanuka.
The losing trend has not put much of
a damper on the team spirit for tomor
row night's match-up. "Our last two
meets were really kind of low meets,"
assistant coach Penney Hauschild said. "
But we had a really great week of work
outs, and I think that we are really posi
tive going into this meet."
Despite the high morale of the team,
though, a first-place finish in Corvallis
will not be easy. The Cardinal's competi
tion are all quite capable of running
away with the victory. The hosting team,

Oregon State, is now ranked as one of
the top six gymnastics teams in the
NCAA.
The University of Arizona is talented
as well, having consistently made it to
the NCAAs for the past few years. The
Stanford women, however, seem hopeful
and ready to prove that they have got
what it takes, as well. "If we can hit,
then (the other teamsl are real, real
beatable," Hauschild said.
The Stanford gymnasts have made
just a few minor changes in bar routines
in preparation for this weekend's invita
tional. "Almost all of the other routines
are real consistent with what we have
been doing in the past meets," Hauschild
said.
In last weekend's meet, freshman
Laurie West injured herself in her first
event, causing head coach Breck Green
wood and Hauschild to pull her out of
the vault and beam competitions.
According to Hauschild, West is in great
condition for this weekend and will per
form all-around as usual. The only major
injury on the team is that of sophomore
Erin McCann, whose ankle injuries pro
hibit her from competing on anything
other than bars.
In general, the spirits were high for
the team. "We have a really good, posi
tive attitude about everything,"
Hauschild said. "We are pretty excited. It
should be a good meet."
