In case you hadn't noticed, the
Stanford men's gymnastics team
is on a roll. Still undefeated
halfway through its season and
ranked fourth in the country, the
Cardinal faces perhaps its biggest
challenge yet this year at the
Santa Barbara Invitational today.
Not that host Santa Barbara
will be a problem. Neither will
four of the other six teams that
Stanford will face. The only two
teams on Coach Sadao Hamada's
mind are Arizona State and Ohio
State.
The Sun Devils came the clos
est of any team to beating the Car
dinal this season, as Stanford
came from behind to win a close
meet in the Valley of the Sun.
Hamada, however, does not think
that history will repeat itself on
Friday. "We beat them at their
home when we were not that
great. Now we are definitely about
five or six points ahead of them."
Hamada does not know, howev
er, where the team stands in rela
tion to Ohio State. "They are
probably the favorite to win the
Big Ten championships, so I am
pretty sure they're going to be
very strong. But we are well-pre

in the same situation as we are, as
they have never met us before and
yet have heard a lot about us."
In the team's week off, Hamada
added new routines with more dif
ficult tricks in hopes of increasing
the team score in the next couple
meets to 282 or 283, a score which
would he believes would put the
team within striking distance of
the NCAA title.
This week, however, Hamada is
only looking for a 281 or 282, as he
is aware of the effect that two very
hard weeks of practice have had
on the the team. "Physically the
guys are very tired right now."
said Hamada, "They've been
doing a lot of routines, and every
one is complaining about aches
and pains. But this is something
they have to go through to prepare
for the NCAA's."
As is facing a tough team in a
big meet with NCAA title implica
tions.
