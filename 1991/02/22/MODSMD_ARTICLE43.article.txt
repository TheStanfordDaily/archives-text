# Queerland presents 'gym-in'
## 
### Paul Yee 
Queerland, a student group
that aims to make the gay, lesbian
and bisexual community at Stan
ford more visible, held a "gym-in"
last night in Encina Gym.
While only about five of the
Queerland members at the event
wore T-shirts emblazoned with
the group's maroon-and-pink
logo, senior Tom BoellstorfT said
many more who attended chose to
wear regular gym clothes.
The purpose of the gym-in, he
said, was to take an everyday
place on campus like Encina Gym
and show that lesbians, gays and
bisexuals use the facilities on a
normal basis. In a similar event
last month, Queerland members
packed the Coffee House at a "be
in."
These events fit in with the
group's goals by sending "a mes
sage to straight people that there
are a lot of queer people on cam
pus and a message to queer people
that they're not alone on cam
pus."
Boellstorff said Queerland and
its events have "definitely revital
ized the gay community on cam
pus."
The idea for creating Queer
land came up during a meeting
last month of lesbian, gay and
bisexual students. Some people
expressed dissatisfaction that
there was not enough visibility of
lesbians, gays and bisexuals on
campus.
Others said some students felt
alienated by the Lesbian, Gay and

Bisexual Community Center,
located at the Fire Truck House.
Graduate student Ann Seaton
said Queerland also hopes to
involve a wide variety of people on
campus, including students, fac
ulty and people of all colors and
ages.
Non-heterosexuals are "very
familiar with being silenced â€”
erased," BoellstorfT said.
Seaton added that Queerland
desires "equal respect and equal
treatment without lip service."
She said the group is also pushing
for the creation of a University
committee to examine the possi
bility of a Lesbian and Gay Stud
ies Department.
The name "Queerland," said
Seaton, who coined it, was a com
bination of Queer Nation and the
name Leland. Queer Nation is an
international group of lesbians,
gays and bisexuals that began last
year and has chapters throughout
the United States, Canada and
Europe.
Queer Nation focuses on visi
bility issues, media bias and
unfair laws, explained Boellstorff.
Like Queer Nation, Queerland is a
non-hierarchal group, with its
members taking turns being the
facilitator at its meetings.
Some members of Queerland
are hoping to remove the negative
connotations from the term
"queer." Seaton and Boellstorff
said they feel the term avoids clas
sifying people as "lesbian," "gay"
or "bisexual."
"While I'm not positive that
I'm a lesbian," Seaton said, "I'm

positive I'm queer."
" 'Queer' is more of an atti
tude," she explained.
Members said that while they
take the main goals of their group
seriously, they still organize
events which involve humor and
fun. Seaton refers to Queerland
members as "activists in the
'active' sense of the word."
" Seaton, who attended Wellesley
College in Massachusetts as an
undergraduate, said Stanford is
not a campus where many cou
ples, both gay and lesbian, openly
express affection in public. "Phys
ical expression [at Stanford) is
lower in general," she said.
Queerland hopes to break the
stereotype that the lives of les
bians, gays and bisexuals revolve
around sex. "Queer people do
things that don't involve sex,"
Boellstorff said matter-of-factly.
Seaton said Queerland plans to
make its presence known at fra
ternity and sorority parties and
the Stanford Shopping Center,
which Seaton called an "apolitical
space devoid of consciousness."
She also hopes Queerland will
hold more gay cultural events,
including readings of works by gay
poets.
Debbie Jue, an officer at the
Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Com
munity Center said she supports
Queerland and what it stands for.
But she distinguished the center
from Queerland, explaining its
purpose is "to be an umbrella so
another structure like Queerland
can use it as a springboard to do
whatever thev want to do."
