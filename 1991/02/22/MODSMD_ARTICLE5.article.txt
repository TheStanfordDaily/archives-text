# Gay and lesbian couples demand equal benefits
## 
### Robin Mathison Staff writer 
Andrew Lisac has been liv
ing with his lover Tom Schmidt
for six-and-a-half years. Yet
Lisac, assistant dean of the
summer session and continu
ing studies, worries that his

partner would receive no bene
fits if Lisac died during work
related travel.
Gay and lesbian faculty and
staff, through an organization
called Out at Stanford, are
fighting for access to the bene
fits that married University
employees receive. For example, if
Lisac were legally married, his
spouse would receive $500,000
compensation upon his work
related death.
"These people can't get mar
ried, but the University should
recognize that and still treat them
equitably," said Lisac, who helped
found Out at Stanford last fall.
Under current University pol
icy, unmarried faculty and staff
are ineligible for spouse housing

and benefits such as medical cov
erage, leave-of-absence policies,
retirement programs and tuition
discounts for their children
This is a "most egregious pol
icy," said David Bradfute, the
graduate senator who authored
the ASSU Senate's benefits-par
ity bill, which was passed unani
mously at last night's meeting.
Bradfute said he thinks the
ASSU endorsement of the equal
benefits principle "is the first step
in the process of creating benefits
parity for gay and lesbian faculty
and staff." He said the next step
would require Faculty Senate
action.
"Student opinion is likely to be
very important" in influencing

University President Donald
Kennedy, said English Prof. Ron
Rebholz, a member of Out at
Stanford. A positive ASSU vote
would be "wonderful, wonderful
support for our position," he said.
Bradfute charged that the
inequity in benefits for same-sex
faculty and staff couples repre
sents discrimination prohibited
by the University's personnel pol
icy. The University policy states
Stanford will "provide equal
employment opportunities for all
applicants and employees."
Unlike the student domestic
partners policy announced Oct. 9,
which offered housing, library,
and athletic benefits to domestic
partners of unmarried same-sex

and opposite-sex couples, the
issue facing same-sex faculty and
staff couples involves larger eco
nomic benefits.
"We're talking about a very dif
ferent set of benefits," said Brad
fute. "Although the principle is
the same, we're talking about
money here, and the University
doesn't have much money right
now," he said.
Rebholz said he believes
Kennedy is "not opposed in princi
ple" to the extension of benefits,
judging by his past actions.
Kennedy was "very courageous on
the domestic partners issues for
students. He's taken a lot of flak
from alumni," he said.
