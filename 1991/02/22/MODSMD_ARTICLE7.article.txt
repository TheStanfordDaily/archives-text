# Legal problems delay extension
## 
### Eleni Kirkas Staff writer 
Almost four months after the
Palo Alto City Council approved
an environmental impact report
on the proposed extension of Sand
Hill Road, the study still has not
begun due to ongoing disputes
between the city and Stanford.
The project would extend the
road about one half-mile north
east between the Stanford Shop
ping Center and San Francisquito
Creek to El Camino Real. It cur
rently ends at Arboretum Road.
The dispute concerns the exact
terms of an agreement between
Stanford or Palo Alto over who

will pay the costs of the environ
mental impact study for the pro
ject.
The Palo Alto City Council in
November awarded the contract
for the impact report to Environ
mental Impact Planning Associ
ates, a San Francisco firm which
completed two similar reports for
proposed extensions of Sand Hill
Road in 1975 and 1984.
Last year Stanford reached an
agreement with Palo Alto regard
ing payment for the study. Stan
ford agreed to pay the full cost of
the study — estimated at
$500,000 — unless the city rejects
the extension project before con
struction was authorized to begin.

In that case, Palo Alto agreed to
reimburse Stanford for half the
cost of the report.
If Stanford terminates the pro
ject, it will not be entitled to any
reimbursement from the city.
Palo Alto has now raised the
question of what constitutes rejec
tion of the Sand Hill project, said
Marvin Overway, chief trans
portation official for the city.
The current problem arises
because outside parties who feel
the study is somehow inadequate
can challenge the impact report in
court.
Stanford and Palo Alto must
clarify who will pay the legal costs
incurred by defending the report
in court if such a challenge is
posed.
If the courts rule the impact
study adequate, the work on the
report can continue as planned,
and the city will likely approve the
extension project.
However, if the impact report is
found to be deficient, the city
must decide whether to continue
with the project by authorizing a
new environmental study or
whether to reject the project alto
gether.
Stanford and Palo Alto must
then clarify the payment arrange
ment for a new environmental
report.
Tony Badger, leader of Neigh
bors Against Sand Hill Expansion,
said his group will challenge the
environmental impact report "on
every possible format."
Both of the previous impact
reports were challenged in court
by Palo Alto and Menlo Park com
munity members for failing to
consider the effects of some
aspects of the Sand Hill Road
extension.
Because courts ruled that the
reports were inadequate, the cities
were unable to come to a decision
on whether to extend Sand Hill
Road, and the project was not
begun.
The Sand Hill Road expansion
project has been a continuing
source of tension between Stan
ford and members of surrounding
communities since 1927, said

Julia Fremon, manager of Trans
portation Programs for Stanford.
The University and other pro
ponents of the project contend
expansion of the road is necessary
to alleviate the traffic congestion
around the Stanford Shopping
Center and the Medical Center.
Opponents such as Badger
argue that the extension of the
road will cause increased traffic in
neighborhoods of north Palo Alto
and in the Menlo Park neighbor
hoods north of the San Fran
cisquito Creek.
The impact report will consider
the effects of several different pro

posals for the project, including a
two- or three-lane extension, on
traffic patterns and the surround
ing environment, said Joan
Kugler of Environmental Impact
Associates.
The report will also study the
implications of alternative pro
jects such as widening Arboretum
Road, Galvez Street and other
campus roads to redirect traffic or
helping increase use of public
transportation.
Once the impact report is com
pleted, Stanford will propose a
project to the Palo Alto City Coun
cil for approval.
