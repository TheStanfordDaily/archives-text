# Department delays faculty hiring
## 
### Marli Marinelli Staff writer 
Despite rising frustration among many German
Studies graduate students, administrators in the
department say they cannot afford at the present
time to find replacements for two popular profes
sors.
The two prominent professors — Russell Berman
and David Wellbery — are on leave, and it is uncer
tain whether they will return to Stanford. Last
month, 19 graduate students in the department
threatened to leave because without Berman and
Wellbery, there was no one to supervise their disser
tations.
"I really sympathize with the graduate students,"
said Rob Robinson, chair of the German Studies

Department. "Two of our most exciting professors
who were in the field of the 20th century, which is
the field most of our students are interested in, may
or may not be coming back."
Robinson added, "They have been protesting, and
quite correctly, that we need more personnel."
However, he said he understands the University's
position as well. "The students want the University
to undertake a search for new faculty, but from the
University's point of view, it's a gamble. And in these
times of budget pressures, I also sympathize with
the University."
Robinson said the budget crisis is a mqjor compli
cation in the situation. "I think there is caution on
the part of the deans in the face of the budget
crunch. They don't want to make
an enormous financial commit
ment that involves long-term
implications. And this caution is
what is hurting the students who
are here right now."
Another complication is the
fact that neither Berman nor
Wellbery has told the University
whether he will return. Because
of budget restraints, a replace
ment tenure-track faculty mem
ber cannot be hired until they
make their decisions, Robinson

Graduate students in the
department said they assume
Berman probably does not plan to
return, as he has already sold his
home in the Bay Area. The Uni
versity is negotiating with Well
bery to try to get him to return,
Robinson said.
"We're expecting to receive
some sort of response from Well
bery soon. It's a very complex sit
uation," he said.
Graduate student Ellen Ander
son said, "Basically, what we've
been told by the administration is
that they have decided to open
Prof. Berman's position, if Prof.
Wellbery decides to come back."
The University would ask Well

bery to head up the search com
mittee for the professor to replace
Berman, she added.
• "So, we have to wait until
Wellbery makes his decision,
which may not be well into
August. Then, the administration
tells us, the search for new profes
sors will begin," she said.
Anderson said, "Wellbery is a
very popular lecturer and a very
established name — a very attrac
tive person to have in the depart
ment, but there is great frustra
tion on the part of the students
that the University has linked the
replacement of the professor for
Berman's spot with Wellbery's
decision."

"Right now, it's all up to Well
bery. It's all very frustrating," she
added.
Robinson said, "I don't think
it's going to come to the situation
where 19 students leave. But I
would understand it in some
cases, I think a few people really
mean it and will do it, but for
most it is a form of protest. If all
of the students do leave, then the
department would be in really sad
shape. ... I really hope this is all
temporary."
Anderson said, "If everything
continues at this level of serious
ness, more graduate students
than they think will leave. . . .
Especially after it dawns on them
that there is no other option."
