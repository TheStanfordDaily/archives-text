FACULTY AGAINST THE WAR
Many things about the Gulf war can not yet be known. How many will die? How extensive will be the destruction in Iraq and
Kuwait? How much will it cost the American people? How severely will the environment be damaged? But one thing we know
already: this war will exacerbate rather than solve the problems in the Middle East. We condemn Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. But
reversing it by military force is causing devastation and creating a hatred for the U.S. whose negative effects will be felt long after
the war is over. Recent events have shown that the Bush administration is not seeking merely an Iraqi withdrawl from Kuwait, but
is committed to overthrowing the existing Iraqi regime, thus extending its war aims far beyond the framework of the United
Nations mandate. Imposing Bush's "new world order" portends a Pax Americana in the Gulf that will very likely require a
protracted commitment of U.S. military forces and resources to guarantee the stability of the undemocratic regimes who control the
bulk of the region's oil reserves.
We therefore call for:
1. An immediate cease fire
2. Iraqi withdrawl from Kuwait, to be achieved by non-military means
3. Withdrawal of US forces from the Gulf
4. An international peace conference to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and other regional issues based on the principles
of: an end to military occupations; self-determination and security for all peoples in the region; and a regional ban on
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons.
5. Defense of the civil rights of the Arab-American, Muslim-American, and Jewish-American communities
6. Development of conservation programs and ecologically sound alternative energy resources to reduce U.S. dependence on oil
7. Redirection of government resources away from the military and towards domestic social needs
