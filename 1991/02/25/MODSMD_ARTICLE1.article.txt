DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) —
American and allied troops stormed
Kuwait by land, sea and air early yester
day and wrested pieces of the emirate
from Iraqi forces. By day's end, U.S. para
troopers and Marines were reported on
the doorstep of Kuwait City.
The huge Desert Storm offensive,
striking along a 300-mile front, also
swept up into southern Iraq in the largest
American-led invasion since World War
11.
Iraq's Republican Guard gave its first
sign of life early today. About 80 tanks
from the elite force, rousted from their
positions by attacks deep inside Iraq,
rumbled south toward advancing coali

tion forces, pilots flying over the battle
field said.
"They're finally flushing," said Lt. Col.
Steve Turner, an F-15E fighter-bomber
squadron commander. "They've got to do
something — either that, or get killed in
their holes."
Allied casualties overall were "remark
ably light," said commander Gen. Nor
man Schwarzkopf, who gave no figures
for U.S. dead and wounded.
In the first 24 hours of the ground war,
more than 14,000 Iraqis were taken pris
oner, the U.S. military command in Saudi
Arabia said today. No information was
available on Iraqi casualties.
Led by hundreds of tanks, the troops

from 11 nations raced across the desert
battlefield, at times under pounding rain.
Aircraft screamed in low, attacking
through greasy black smoke from 200 oil
field fires. Hundreds of assault heli
copters streamed into Iraq carrying
American airborne troops.
One column of Saudi and Kuwaiti
troops that punched 20 miles into Kuwait
was "moving like a knife through butter,"
Associated Press photographer Laurent
Rebours reported from the front.

Some defenders tried to hold their
positions. "They're fighting, they're
resisting," a Marine colonel said at one
point. And American military sources
cautioned that days of hard fighting could
lie ahead — particularly if allied forces
grapple with the Iraqi army's elite Repub
lican Guard.
American commanders, nonetheless,
could barely restrain their euphoria.
The Iraqis have proven to be "remark
ably inept," said one senior military
source. Schwarzkopf hailed the first day
as a "dramatic success," and military
planners said the early gains led him to
put his troops on an "accelerated sched
ule."

Asked by a reporter whether the allies
might be skirting Iraqi positions to hold
down casualties, the Army general shot
back, "We're going to go around, over,
through, on top, underneath and any
other way."
Hours after the invasion jumped off
about 4 a.m. yesterday (5 p.m. PST Satur
day) and Baghdad came under renewed
air bombardment, Saddam Hussein went
on official Iraqi radio to urge his troops
on. "Fight them and show no mercy," the
Iraqi president said.
Iraqi military communiques later
asserted that the offensive "has so far
