# U.S. FORCES REACH KUWAIT CITY'S GATES

DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) —
American and allied troops stormed
Kuwait by land, sea and air early yester
day and wrested pieces of the emirate
from Iraqi forces. By day's end, U.S. para
troopers and Marines were reported on
the doorstep of Kuwait City.
The huge Desert Storm offensive,
striking along a 300-mile front, also
swept up into southern Iraq in the largest
American-led invasion since World War
11.
Iraq's Republican Guard gave its first
sign of life early today. About 80 tanks
from the elite force, rousted from their
positions by attacks deep inside Iraq,
rumbled south toward advancing coali

tion forces, pilots flying over the battle
field said.
"They're finally flushing," said Lt. Col.
Steve Turner, an F-15E fighter-bomber
squadron commander. "They've got to do
something — either that, or get killed in
their holes."
Allied casualties overall were "remark
ably light," said commander Gen. Nor
man Schwarzkopf, who gave no figures
for U.S. dead and wounded.
In the first 24 hours of the ground war,
more than 14,000 Iraqis were taken pris
oner, the U.S. military command in Saudi
Arabia said today. No information was
available on Iraqi casualties.
Led by hundreds of tanks, the troops

from 11 nations raced across the desert
battlefield, at times under pounding rain.
Aircraft screamed in low, attacking
through greasy black smoke from 200 oil
field fires. Hundreds of assault heli
copters streamed into Iraq carrying
American airborne troops.
One column of Saudi and Kuwaiti
troops that punched 20 miles into Kuwait
was "moving like a knife through butter,"
Associated Press photographer Laurent
Rebours reported from the front.

Some defenders tried to hold their
positions. "They're fighting, they're
resisting," a Marine colonel said at one
point. And American military sources
cautioned that days of hard fighting could
lie ahead — particularly if allied forces
grapple with the Iraqi army's elite Repub
lican Guard.
American commanders, nonetheless,
could barely restrain their euphoria.
The Iraqis have proven to be "remark
ably inept," said one senior military
source. Schwarzkopf hailed the first day
as a "dramatic success," and military
planners said the early gains led him to
put his troops on an "accelerated sched
ule."

Asked by a reporter whether the allies
might be skirting Iraqi positions to hold
down casualties, the Army general shot
back, "We're going to go around, over,
through, on top, underneath and any
other way."
Hours after the invasion jumped off
about 4 a.m. yesterday (5 p.m. PST Satur
day) and Baghdad came under renewed
air bombardment, Saddam Hussein went
on official Iraqi radio to urge his troops
on. "Fight them and show no mercy," the
Iraqi president said.
Iraqi military communiques later
asserted that the offensive "has so far

failed utterly," and claimed to
have "wiped out" paratroopers
dropped behind Iraqi lines in
western Kuwait.
Iraq struck Israel early today
with two missiles, the 38th and
39th Scud attacks on the Jewish
state and the first since the
ground offensive began. Officials
said the missiles landed harm
lessly in an unsettled area of
southern Israel.
President Bush, in a television
address late Saturday in Washing
ton, announced he had ordered
the ground Attack in the "right
and just" cause of freeing Kuwait
from Iraqi occupation.
Sheikh Saad al-Abdulla al-
Sabah, Kuwait's crown prince,
said in a U.S. television interview
that after liberation his country's
parliament, dissolved in 1986,
would be restored, and suffrage
for women considered.
Bush adviser Brent Scowcroft
spoke yesterday of an objective
beyond returning Kuwait to the
rule of its royal family: eliminat
ing Iraq's offensive military
power.
The long-expected ground
assault came just eight hours
after a deadline set by the Desert
Storm allies for Iraq to begin a
pullout from Kuwait.
The Iraqis had dismissed that
ultimatum as "shameful." The
Bush administration at the same
time rejected a Soviet-sponsored
plan for a slower-paced with
drawal.
A Soviet spokesman com
plained yesterday that a "very real
chance" at a negotiated peace had
been missed.
The offensive climaxed a 7-
month-old crisis that began with
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last
Aug. 2, intensified with the
buildup of more than a half-mil
lion troops on each side, and
exploded into warfare Jan. 17
when the anti-Iraq coalition
launched a devastating air cam
paign against targets in Kuwait

and Iraq.
That air umbrella of lighter
bombers and helicopter gunships
fanned out over the smoke
shrouded battlefront yesterday as
battalion after battalion of
Marines and British tankers,
French legionnaires and U.S.
Army cavalrymen, Saudi, Egyp
tian and other Arab troops rolled
across the border in a multi
pronged.
The armored phalanxes headed
north stirred up huge dust storms
over the desert floor. Offshore, the
battleships USS Wisconsin and
USS Missouri opened fire with
their mighty 16-inch guns on
Iraqi coastal positions.
"I can't fathom the size of this
operation," said Lt. Col. Randy
Bigum, an Air Force F-15C pilot
back from a mission over the
desert."I can't grasp it. It's enor
mous."
Besides making a direct assault
on Kuwait City, strategists appar
ently intend to sweep up the
Iraqis' western flank with U.S.
and British armored units, to
encircle Iraqi troops in Kuwait
and perhaps pin down reserve
forces — the vaunted Republican
Guard — in southernmost Iraq.
Reports on battle action were
sketchy, because the Desert Storm
command was issuing only limited
information, and dispatches from
reporters in news pools at the
front were slow in reaching rear
areas.
The first casualties trickled
into Navy Fleet Hospital Five in
eastern Saudi Arabia late yester
day night. One, Marine Lance Cpl.
Martin Wilcox, 24, of Seattle,
insisted he felt good and wanted
to return to his outfit, despite the
bullet that shattered the bone in
his upper left arm.
The boldest strike of the new
campaign, reported by allied
sources who asked anonymity,
was a drop of U.S. 82nd Airborne
Division paratroopers over the
outskirts of Kuwait City, 50 miles
north of the Saudi-Kuwaiti bor
der.
