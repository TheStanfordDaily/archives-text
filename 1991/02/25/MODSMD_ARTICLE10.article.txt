# Activists disagree on changes in war
## 
### Dylan Tyson Editorial staff 
The outbreak of the ground
war has renewed debate among
campus activist groups on both
sides of the issue about the best
course of action in the Persian
Gulf and President Bush's role
in the conflict.
Senior Eric Krock summed
up the position of Students for
America, a campus group
which has supported the war
effort. "Bush was right all the
way, all along," he said.
Erin Klune, a member of
Students for Peace — which
has organized numerous cam
pus rallies against the war —
made a different assessment.
She said Bush's decision was
another example of his aggres
sive pursuit of war and mili
tarism. "It was both unneces
sary and avoidable."
Students for Peace members
held a candlelight vigil at mid
night last night to protest the
ground war, and both groups
are planning more events to
support their side of the issue.

Both groups also disagree on
the role of the United Nations
at this stage of the conflict.
"It's obvious that the
[United Nations] has nothing
to do with [the ground war],"
said senior Gabe Kahn, a Stu
dents for Peace member. "The
U.S. administration has some
thing very different in mind
from the U.N. resolution,
under the guise of which they
are working."
Students for America vice
chair John Flores challenged
this assertion. "The decision of
when to start the ground war is
a military decision more than a
political decision."
Members of the two groups
also disagreed about the press
blackout.
Kahn called military censor
ship of the press "a blatant
manipulation of the public."
He criticized strongly what he
calls "disinformation" fed to
the American public.
Flores disagreed, saying the
blackout is not manipulation
but a safeguard for allied
troops.
