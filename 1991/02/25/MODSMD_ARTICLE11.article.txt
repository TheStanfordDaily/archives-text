Thousands support Yeltsin
MOSCOW (AP) — About 100,000 people
rallied yesterday in -support of Boris Yeltsin
after he was blasted by Communist Party
hard-liners for demanding the resignation of
President Mikhail Gorbachev.

square next to the Kremlin in central Moscow.
After chanting Yeltsin's name, the crowd
turned against the Soviet president, chanting
"Gorbachev resign!" and "Gorbachev, go
away!"
Hand-printed signs reflected public dissatis
faction with the Soviet leader: "Gorbachev,
The People Despise You," and "Uncle Gorby,
My Granny and I Don't Trust You Anymore."

opposition Democratic Party

organize supporters of the late dictator Enver
Hoxha to march on the capital, Tirana.

were arrested.
Tanks and troops remained on guard at
strategic sites in the city, but shops were open
as usual, said a journalist with the state media
who asked not to be named.
There was no word on casualties.
