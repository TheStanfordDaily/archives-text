BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) - Military
commanders who easily toppled the govern
ment of Prime Minister Chatichai
Choonhavan said yesterday they want to
return the country to democracy and hold
elections in six months.
Speaking a day after they took Chatichai
captive and imposed martial law, the lead
ers also said they would amend the consti
tution to prevent the corruption they said
had motivated their apparently bloodless
coup.
"It is our intention that both amending
the constitution and holding the general
election be done in six months," said Army
Chief Gen. Suchinda Krapayoon, one of the
five top officers behind the rebellion on Sat
urday.
Apparently not a shot was fired as the
rebels took over radio and television sta
tions, dissolved the government and the
Parliament, imposed nationwide martial

law, and abolished the 1978 constitution.
The coup ended soon after soldiers
detained Chatichai just before his plane
took off from Bangkok's military airport,
Thai newspapers said.
He and other ministers were bound for
the northern city of Chiang Mai to see the
constitutional monarch, King Bhumibol
Adulyadej, to present Deputy Prime Minis
ter Arthit Kamlang-ek in his added post of
deputy defense minister.
The appointment, made by Chatichai,
apparently angered the military. Arthit was
also detained in the coup, according to offi
cers. They said the prime minister was well,
but they refused to say where he was being
held.
Chatichai, an easygoing leader famed for
remarking "no problem" during crises,
even "managed to sport a smile while being
led out of the plane," a reporter who was
aboard the plane was quoted as saying.

a bloodless coup on Saturday.
