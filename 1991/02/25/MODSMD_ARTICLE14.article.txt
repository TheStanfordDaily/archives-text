## Too much, too soon 
### 
Politics and inflexibility
led to a ground battle,
despite other options

JUST AS THE POSSIBILITY
for a peaceful solution to the
Persian Gulf crisis seemed at
hand, the Bush administration
began an all-out ground war.
Allied forces smashed into
Kuwait and southern Iraq Satur
day, living up to an ultimatum
issued by President Bush, after
Saddam Hussein failed to comply
with the noon deadline for uncon
ditional withdrawal from Kuwait.
The obvious question is, "Why
invade now?"
The Iraqis seemed to be becom
ing more tractable by the day. In
only a week they had gone from
refusal to leave Kuwait to accep
tance of many of the United
Nations mandates. Continued air
bombardment and ongoing negoti
ations might have made peace
more likely, and ground battle, if
eventually necessary, easier to win.
The Soviet plan for peace,
though inconsistent with our ulti
mate war aims, merited more than
a summary dismissal. It was,
everyone seemed to agree, a posi
tive first step toward a peacefully
negotiated solution to the Persian
Gulf crisis — the type of solution
for which Bush's vision of a new
world order purports to stand.
Negotiation requires flexibility
and compromise. It does not
encompass setting a deadline for
acquiescence and backing it up
with force.
It does require commitment to
the process of negotiation itself —
the type of commitment which
should have led us to defer a
ground war, continue the air
assault and seek agreement on

peaceful terms.
But at Iraq's first sign of willing
ness to compromise, the adminis
tration created an immediate dead
line and launched its ground war
the next day.
Public enthusiasm for the war is
overwhelming — and the adminis
tration would like to see it stay
that way. Even the protest move
ment has been relatively quiet
lately, allowing an atmosphere of
tacit acceptance to pervade the
image of popular opinion.
Political considerations encour
aged a premature strike. Bush
probably knows that public enthu
siasm for the war could run fickle if
the war stalled, especially if the
absolutes of military necessity
were replaced by the uncertainties
of negotiation and debate.
Taking advantage of the fires of
patriotism while they were at their
height, Bush issued a final ultima
tum which no one expected Sad
dam to accept, then escalated the
war when Saddam failed to accept
it.
Conducting foreign policy with
one ultimatum after another is an
unenlightened diplomacy that
makes war inevitable. To give
nations a choice between humilia
tion and violence is to invite
aggression, not avert it.
War only occasionally solves the
issues that bring it about. It invari
ably creates a thousand new prob
lems — some glaringly clear, others
unforeseeable and hovering just
beyond the horizon.
Though the ground war's victo
ries may be dramatic, though its
casualties may be few, the legacy
left by the administration's actions
in the Gulf may well be the use of
ultimatum, threat and military
force as an instrument of foreign
policy.
It is an alarming keynote for a
new world order.
