CC\"\T HEN in DOUBT, BLAME it
%/%/ on the media." Confucius
Y V didn't say it, but he may as
well have; media-bashing has joined base
ball, hot dogs and apple pie as an integral
part of the American way.
Anti-war protesters complain about
negative coverage when the press reports
police cars being blown up in the heat of
the protest moment; they claim the media
is involved in some kind of conspiracy
with the government to keep information
from the public.
War supporters moan that the media
has overplayed the "collateral damage,"
(civilian deaths), due to the U.S. and
allied air effort; a recent CNN poll showed
45 percent believed too much emphasis
has been placed on the civilian casualties.
Even CNN's Peter Arnett, the only
television reporter who dares to stay in
Baghdad, is taking heat for his role in the
war coverage. An American military offi
cer, when asked if Saddam Hussein is
using the Al-Rashid Hotel in Baghdad as
a base for military operations, responded,
"Yeah, he might be there. He probably
sleeps in the same room with Peter
Arnett."
The media is just one of many objects
people use to blame for their own prob
lems and duck responsibility for their
actions. Something in human nature
makes people seek scapegoats and
excuses — they serve a therapeutic value
by allowing people to avoid their own
responsibility.
Every nation, every community, every
organization must have its own set of
scapegoats to draw on from time to time.

Stanford is no different. Unlike Milli
Vanilli, Stanford can't "Blame It on the
Rain"; we don't have any.
Stanford students do have their own
list of people, places and things to blame.
For those who need an easy-to-use refer
ence guide, here's a non-comprehensive
list of Stanford's favorite scapegoats and
excuses:
• The administration. Also known
as "the University." Nobody knows who
or what this monolith is, but it clearly
spends most of its time planning conspir
acies. From fraternities to co-operatives
to the United Stanford Workers, most
campus groups sincerely believe "the
administration" is "out to get" them.
Have a problem? Need help? Blame it on
the administration.
• Fraternities and sororities. Fra
ternities are the campus' scapegoat for all
that is racist, sexist and homophobic,
while sororities foster the continued sex
ist environment by fulfilling certain
female stereotypes. By placing the blame
for these "isms" on the Greek system,
other students can ignore the "isms"
reflected in their own actions.
• Time. Because every student can
relate to it,"I didn't have enough time"
has become the most popular — and most
acceptable — excuse on campus. Unfortu
nately for students conditioned to using
this excuse, the time factor doesn't fly so
well with professors, parents or prospec
tive employers. Their conditioned
response is to politely suggest that you
make time.
• Alcohol. The most serious of all
Stanford's scapegoats or excuses, drink

ing is a favorite excuse for foolish behav
ior, offensive or destructive acts, and sex
ual assault. Students use booze to lose
their "inhibitions," and then they blame
all sorts of actions on the alcohol —
apparently to eliminate their own respon
sibility "I'm sorry I threw that beer on
you/puked on your bedroom floor/forced
you to have sex against your will. But it
wasn't my fault. I was drunk."
• The campus media. This usually
means The Daily or The Review, since
nobody reads Release, nobody critiques
Campus Report and KZSU simply reads
The Daily on air for its news broadcasts.
The Review gets blamed for all of this
campus' racism, homophobia and politi
cally incorrect thinking, while The Daily
gets blamed for that and everything else.
So what do all these scapegoats and
excuses mean? They prove that nobody's
willing to accept the consequences of his
or her actions. If we could just admit
the fact that we're not all perfect, we
might be able to start accepting responsi
bility for our failures as well as our suc
cesses.

Tim Marklein, a senior majoring in polit
ical science, accepts full blame for this
column. It appears every Monday, except
for last week when there was no Monday
Daily. That can be blamed on George
Washington's parents.
