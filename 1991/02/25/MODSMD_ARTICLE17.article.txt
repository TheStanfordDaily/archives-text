## Students should voice their opinions about ground war 
### 
INSTEAD OF THE SEIZING the
opportunity presented by the Soviet
peace plan to negotiate an end to the
Gulf war and secure an unconditional
Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, the Bush
administration decided to launch an
immediate ground offensive against Iraq,
in order to attain a "more complete vic
tory."
From the standpoint of many
involved, the most terrifying phase of the
Gulf war has begun.
Two war veterans recently wrote to
me, encouraging the peace movement to
continue its efforts at raising the level of
student awareness and protest. I want to
share these pieces, not to defend or pro
mote the strategies and positions of the
anti-war movement, but to make a plea
for a change in awareness.
The first letter was from a World War
II veteran, who criticized Bush's claim
that somehow we are at war to "protect
our way of life." The man wrote of vari
ous national crises that have worsened
since World War 11, and asked, "I wonder
if Bush realizes what our way of life has

become?" His letter offered some words
of support for political activism and
closed, "I am ashamed to turn this coun
try over to my grandchildren."
The second letter was from a veteran
of the Vietnam War. He wrote plainly
that, "after serving with ground combat
forces in Vietnam, the insanity of war is
readily apparent.... Please continue to
make your voices heard, and support the
troops just as loudly and be there when
they come home. They are just doing
their duty regardless of their convictions,
and many just don't know yet how war is
and why it is not the answer."
I realize that many people have been
significantly confused in the past few
months, unsure of how to react to the
military role of the United States in the
Middle East and the ongoing pursuit of
war.
Others have been unable or unwilling
to seriously question and confront the
nature of their own opinions about the
war. While the teach-in that took place
during the first week of war drew a fair
number of people, since then student

involvement in programs on the Middle
East has been pitifully low.
Members of the Students for Peace in
the Middle East movement on campus
have been criticized for their efforts at
questioning and confronting U.S. policies
in the Gulf, and taking a stand against
U.S. military action in accordance with
their own views.
While I believe that many people fail
to seriously consider the complexity of
the arguments and beliefs behind the
anti-war position, others have attacked
the peace movement with harsh nation
alistic rhetoric that has fast become com
monplace within conservative circles,
such as "the peace movement does not
support the troops," and is not "patri
otic." Some students seem annoyed by
the peace movement for being too visible
or too "loud."
I respect any person's resolve to form
and hold his or her own opinions about
this war and the actions of our govern
ment in general.
What I do not understand, however, is
the mentality some seem to have that

we, as students and U.S. citizens, are
unable to influence the decisions of our
government, or that we are divorced
from responsibility for its actions.
Too many students allow themselves
to live here as if in a political vacuum,
carrying on with their regular academic
routines, which have remained largely
unaltered by the outbreak of war. Can
we allow ourselves to become accus
tomed to the destruction of human life
as well?
Whether it has stemmed from confu
sion, frustration or apathy, most stu
dents on this campus have been politi
cally invisible since the start of the war.
In the midst of what may be the single
most devastating event of our lifetime —
regionally, internationally and globally —
we must not allow our generation to fall
into this mentality of "unconnected
ness," of refusing or being unable to
involve ourselves with the realities and
tragedies of the world around us.
There is simply too much at stake.
