# Die-ins emphasize the reality of a war that is too easy to ignore
## 
### 
I wish to express my anger and sad
ness at Dale Edmondson's letter in The
Daily, which compared the die-ins on
campus to the few reckless acts of van
dalism which have occurred in San Fran
cisco, namely the burning of the police
cars on the night of Jan. 16. The sensa
tionalist actions of the San Francisco
protesters do not represent the peace
movement as a whole.
I would also like to respond to his
question regarding why Students for

Peace in the Middle East uses the vehicle
of die-ins on our campus.
Bruno Bettelheim wrote in his essay,
"The Ignored Lessons of Anne Frank,"
that in the face of trauma and crisis, the
human psyche has a natural tendency to
seek that which is safe, and to use illu
sory standards of security to maintain a
sense of self-reassurance.
This is only human; if we carried all
our fears and anger with us at all times,
it would be self-destructive.
However, clinging too tightly to a
false security can be equally destructive.
By creating the illusion that danger
exists simply in a hypothetical, abstract
form against which our friends, family
and everyday schedules are adequate
protection, we make ourselves more vul

nerable through our naivete and igno
rance to the dangers at hand than if we
directly confront them.
Here on the Stanford campus, we
have very safe lives: little crime, guaran
teed meals, money in our pockets. Walk
ing around the campus, one does not see
any sense of urgency regarding the war;
it has been objectified, abstracted and
banished to thousands of miles away. It
becomes dangerously easy to support an
action whose consequences we cannot
see because of isolation and objectivity.
The teach-in organized by Students
for Peace presented an objective, multi
faceted view of the war. However, regard
less of what the government tells us, war
is not objective. Students for Peace seek
only to remind Stanford through the die

ins that a life lost is a life lost, regardless
of in what country it occurs or the
nationality of those killed.
