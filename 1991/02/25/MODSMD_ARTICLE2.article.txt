### Dan Stearns Staff writer 
Three armed gunmen in black
ski masks held up the Medical
Center branch of the Stanford
Federal Credit Union at 11:45
a.m. Friday and stole between
$50,000 and $60,000, Palo Alto
Police officials said.
One of the perpetrators pointed
his gun at an employee's head
while an accomplice hopped over
the counter and stole cash from
the drawers and the safe, police
said.
Three employees and one cus
tomer were in the bank at the
time.
Although the Medical Center's
security offices lie around the cor

tor of Security Services Mike
Stultz said he was only alerted
about the robbery when an
employee ran screaming down the
hall past his office.
Employees were too terrified to
activate the bank's silent alarm,

he said.
Stultz said the gunmen
entered the credit union, which is
below ground level, from a rear
stairwell that connects the hospi
tal basement to the parking lot
adjacent to Quarry Road.
After the heist, the robbers
retraced their steps up the stairs
into the parking lot and escaped in
two waiting cars on Quarry Road,
police said.
One suspect was involved in a
car accident in East Palo Alto min

said. He remains in custody.
Police said they gathered from
witnesses' accounts that the three
robbers are 18- to 20-year-old
black males.
The bank was closed for the
remainder of the day, and the
shaken employees were ques
tioned for several hours by police
detectives. "They were very hys
terical," Stultz said.
Stultz added that the entire
