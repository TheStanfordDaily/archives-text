# Gunmen hold up Med Center bank
## Armed trio escapes with $60,000 
### Dan Stearns Staff writer 
Three armed gunmen in black
ski masks held up the Medical
Center branch of the Stanford
Federal Credit Union at 11:45
a.m. Friday and stole between
$50,000 and $60,000, Palo Alto
Police officials said.
One of the perpetrators pointed
his gun at an employee's head
while an accomplice hopped over
the counter and stole cash from
the drawers and the safe, police
said.
Three employees and one cus
tomer were in the bank at the
time.
Although the Medical Center's
security offices lie around the cor
ner from the credit union, Direc
tor of Security Services Mike
Stultz said he was only alerted
about the robbery when an
employee ran screaming down the
hall past his office.
Employees were too terrified to
activate the bank's silent alarm,

he said.
Stultz said the gunmen
entered the credit union, which is
below ground level, from a rear
stairwell that connects the hospi
tal basement to the parking lot
adjacent to Quarry Road.
After the heist, the robbers
retraced their steps up the stairs
into the parking lot and escaped in
two waiting cars on Quarry Road,
police said.
One suspect was involved in a
car accident in East Palo Alto min
utes later and was arrested, police
said. He remains in custody.
Police said they gathered from
witnesses' accounts that the three
robbers are 18- to 20-year-old
black males.
The bank was closed for the
remainder of the day, and the
shaken employees were ques
tioned for several hours by police
detectives. "They were very hys
terical," Stultz said.
Stultz added that the entire

A Stanford police officer chocks for fingerprints at the Medical Center branch of the Stanford Federal
Credit Union after Friday's robbery.
Medical Center has been
installing a new security system
with 47 cameras over the past
four years. However, the credit
union — the only part of the Med
ical Center where large amounts
of cash are exchanged — was not
part of the new system. The three
"dummy" cameras mounted in
the credit union failed to deter the

criminals.
He added that cameras would
be installed.
Eric Jones, who works in the
patient-admitting department
located above the credit union,
said he thinks the robbery was
well-staged. "Today (Friday) is
payday for both Stanford Univer
sity and the Medical Center," he
said. "The money was here.
Between eleven and twelve is a
slow time. [The robbers] knew the
place well enough."
