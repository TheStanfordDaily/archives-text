The brooms were hidden until the
seventh inning of yesterday's finale
with Arizona State, but they reappeared
with a Steve Solomon grand slam as
Stanford began a successful defense of
its Pacific 10 Conference baseball title.

Cardinal sweeps three-game
series from Sun Devils

Solomon's home run, along with
seven innings of one-hit relief from
Aaron Dorlarque, keyed a seven-run
comeback as the Cardinal won the get
away game 9-8 and swept the third
ranked Sun Devils in the Pacific 10
Southern Division season-opening series
at Sunken Diamond.
Senior John Reid went the distance
in victory Friday, allowing no earned
runs on six hits as the Cardinal tri
umphed 9-1. Center fielder Jeffrey
Hammonds fired two home runs to fuel
a 10-hit Cardinal attack.
Scott Weiss, filling in for sporadic
starter Jamie Sepeda on Saturday,
started slowly but pitched Stanford to a
10-5 complete-game win. After trailing
4-2, the Cardinal scored runs in five
straight innings. First baseman David
McCarty homered in the third, high
lighting a four-run rally.
The sweep puts Stanford (16-3, 3-0)
in its familiar position atop of the Six-
Pac with an early one-game lead. The
Sun Devils, a pre-season conference
favorite and No. 1 pick, have lost five in
a row and are 10-9 overall.
"They've already tied us for the sea
son, no matter how well we play in
Packard. But we played well - we
deserved to win," Sun Devil coach Jim
Brock said, who has compiled a 952-360
mark in his 19 years in Tempe.
After winning the first two games in
convincing style, the Cardinal was clob
bered in the early innings yesterday.
Freshman starter Willie Adams (4-0)
was hit hard in his Six-Pac debut, sur
rendering seven earned runs in two

innings, while the Sun Devils built an 8-
1 lead.
Offensively, Stanford refused to take
the free opportunities offered up by five
ineffective Sun Devil pitchers. With the
help of 14 Sun Devil walks and invisible
clutch hitting until the seventh inning,
Stanford stranded 11 runners and left
the bases loaded three times. But it was
much worse than it sounds.
Stanford did its best to get rid of base

runners without having them score.
The Cardinal hit into three double plays
(David McCarty a repeat offender) and
had three runners picked off base.
The free-pass pitching finally caught
up with the Sun Devils in the seventh.
After four walks and a two-run Tallman
single, right fielder Steve Solomon
pulled a grand slam home run into the

trees in right field, completing the
Cardinal comeback.
"If we lost this game it wasn't
the the umpire's fault. It was
because we left so many guys on
base," Stanford Coach Mark Mar
quess said. "This was the poorest
played of the three, but it was a
great comeback."
The comeback would have been
impossible without the perfect
pitching of Dorlarque, a right
handed junior who has pitched 27
straight scoreless innings. Dorlar
que did not allow a hit in his last
six innings of work to pick up the
victory (2-0).
On Saturday, Arizona State
took another early lead only to see
it wilt under the hot Sunken Dia
mond sun. The Sun Devils scored
four runs in the first two innings
off reliever-turned-starter Scott
Weiss, but Weiss found his compo
sure and the Cardinal badgered
Sun Devil starter Gary Tatterson
(2-2) for nine earned runs.
"After the first two innings I
wasn't sure if I was going to make
it," said Weiss, who took the place
of Sepeda in the rotation. "But in
the third I found my groove and
started throwing my breaking ball
for strikes."
Weiss, who leads the Six-Pac in
strikeouts with 43 in 31.7 innings,
proceeded to strike out six Sun
Devils in the next four innings as
the Cardinal bounced back to a 9-
5 advantage.
"I was a little timid at the
beginning and I wasn't bearing
down," Weiss said. "I had too
much time to think about what
was going on. But once we got the
lead I relaxed and pitched better."
Weiss, who relies heavily on a

repertoire of breaking balls, has
been more effective as a reliever
than as a starter in previous sea
sons. In his sophomore year he
was 0-4 with a 10.97 earned run
average as a starter, but 3-2 with
three saves and a 3.C5 ERA as a
reliever. Tuesday he came in as a
long reliever against Sacramento
State and struck out a career-high
13 batters.
Offensively, Stanford coun
tered with a balanced attack.
Shortstop Roger Burnett doubled
in his first two at bats to drive in
two, Tallman tallied two RBI with
a bad-hop infield single in the
third, Chris Kemper had three
hits and McCarty singled and
homered.
McCarty increased the Stan
ford lead to 8-4 in the fifth when
he launched a Tatterson slider
into an ionospheric orbit. The
ball left Sunken Diamond over the
scoreboard and will probably
come down next week in the
Indian Ocean.
"Actually, I didn't feel like I got
all of it," said McCarty, who is sec
ond in the Six-Pac with 9 home
runs, behind Hammonds. "Usu
ally I can feel the compression of
the ball and bat when I get ahold
of one."
Hammonds, who hit three
home runs and drove in eight in
the three-game series, showed
why he's the clean-up hitter Fri
day, blasting two home runs.
"It was just one of those days,"
said Hammonds, who came five
feet away from a third home run
with a warning track shot in the
fourth. "The adrenaline was flow
ing for the first day of the Pac and
everything went right."
Meanwhile, Reid was back to
his old form and shut down the
dangerous middle of the Sun
Devil lineup.
