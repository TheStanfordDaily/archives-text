Cardinal sweeps three-game
series from Sun Devils

Solomon's home run, along with
seven innings of one-hit relief from
Aaron Dorlarque, keyed a seven-run
comeback as the Cardinal won the get
away game 9-8 and swept the third
ranked Sun Devils in the Pacific 10
Southern Division season-opening series
at Sunken Diamond.
Senior John Reid went the distance
in victory Friday, allowing no earned
runs on six hits as the Cardinal tri
umphed 9-1. Center fielder Jeffrey
Hammonds fired two home runs to fuel
a 10-hit Cardinal attack.
Scott Weiss, filling in for sporadic
starter Jamie Sepeda on Saturday,
started slowly but pitched Stanford to a
10-5 complete-game win. After trailing
4-2, the Cardinal scored runs in five
straight innings. First baseman David
McCarty homered in the third, high
lighting a four-run rally.
The sweep puts Stanford (16-3, 3-0)
in its familiar position atop of the Six-
Pac with an early one-game lead. The
Sun Devils, a pre-season conference
favorite and No. 1 pick, have lost five in
a row and are 10-9 overall.
"They've already tied us for the sea
son, no matter how well we play in
Packard. But we played well - we
deserved to win," Sun Devil coach Jim
Brock said, who has compiled a 952-360
mark in his 19 years in Tempe.
After winning the first two games in
convincing style, the Cardinal was clob
bered in the early innings yesterday.
Freshman starter Willie Adams (4-0)
was hit hard in his Six-Pac debut, sur
rendering seven earned runs in two

innings, while the Sun Devils built an 8-
1 lead.
Offensively, Stanford refused to take
the free opportunities offered up by five
ineffective Sun Devil pitchers. With the
help of 14 Sun Devil walks and invisible
clutch hitting until the seventh inning,
Stanford stranded 11 runners and left
the bases loaded three times. But it was
much worse than it sounds.
Stanford did its best to get rid of base

runners without having them score.
The Cardinal hit into three double plays
(David McCarty a repeat offender) and
had three runners picked off base.
The free-pass pitching finally caught
up with the Sun Devils in the seventh.
After four walks and a two-run Tallman
single, right fielder Steve Solomon
pulled a grand slam home run into the
