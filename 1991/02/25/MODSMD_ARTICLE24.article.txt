# Umpire Patch makes enemies

Someone call Judge Wapner and
give him a chest protector and face
mask. They need him behind the plate
at Sunken Diamond.
In the aftermath of yesterday's
whang-bang series finale at Sunken
Diamond, a 9-8 Cardinal win, it was
apparent that nobody was pleased
with the officiating by home-plate
umpire Tony Patch.
"It is not often in my career that I
can say a ballgame was stolen. But
that was the case here today," said Ari
zona State Coach Jim Brock. "Mr.
Patch must need money very, very
badly, or he has no mirrors in his
home."
Patch, assailed from all sides for
being "impartial," ejected both head
coaches and probably could have
kicked out about 3,000 fans
Obviously umpiring is a tough job,
but what Wapner lacks injudicial skill
he could make up in popularity. The
People's Court justice might make a
good umpire: "Don't take the law into
your own hands, just send 'em to the
showers."
Just ask Patch. He was definitely
the most hated man at Sunken Dia
mond yesterday and, based on his
name recognition, he may merit his
own Wapner-style television show. He
certainly deserves the money after a
grueling sunny afternoon at Sunken
Diamond, where there were 17 runs,

18 walks and two coaches who were
convinced he was trying to rob them.
"I thought he was a man of
integrity. Obviously I was wrong. I'm
going to red-line him for the rest of his
life," Brock said, ironically dressed all
in blue for the postgame ax-grinding.
"I think everybody in the ballpark
saw that the strike zone changed after
Marquess was ejected," Brock said,
who put on a show-and-tell routine at
home plate before bumping bellies
with Patch and earning his ejection.
Brock differed with Patch's call on a 2-
2 curve-ball to Tallman that drifted
over the inside corner.
After Brock's tirade, Tallman sin
gled to drive in two runs and three
batters later Steve Solomon hit the go
ahead grand slam.
"It would be impossible to place the
ball anywhere and have it be more of a
strike," Brock grumbled.
Marquess was thrown out in the
fifth inning after Patch called a shoe
string level fastball a strike on Troy
Tallman. Marquess argued, started to
return to the dugout, but returned
four times with additional advice
before Patch sent him packing.
"I think he is one of the better
umpires. We'll have him for more
games. He'll probably work the
Regional and the World Series," Mar
quess said. "But he had a bad day and
I let him know it. He should have
thrown me out. I said enough and I
