The last two years, Coach Tara
VanDerveer's team has elevated
its play in the home stretch of
each season. Last year, for exam
ple, Stanford scored over 100
points in five of its eight games
prior to the Final Four. This sea
son, it looks like the team is gear
ing up for the tournament again
as its last two contests, including
a 116-79 pasting of the Arizona
Lady Cats on Saturday, have been
routs.

Saturday's game didn't start so
well, however. Arizona's 5-foot-11
freshman forward Janelle Thomp
son scored her team's first six
points as the Cats led the Cardinal
6-4.
But two seniors starting in
their last regular season home
game ignited Stanford's attack.
Sonja Henning dished the first of
her 12 assists on the night to
Trisha Stevens to tie the game at
6-6 and the Cardinal never looked
back.
After several minutes of crowd
ing the paint, it began to get con
gested underneath the basket and
Stanford's guards began to get
hot. Henning, Christy Hedgpeth
and Angela Taylor rained shots
from the three-point arc.
"Tara told the wings to open it
up from the outside," Hedgpeth
said. "That forces the defense to
cover the shot and spreads them
out, so we can use our screens bet
ter. Screens are the key to getting
great shots."
Stanford got plenty of great
shots in the next five minutes of
the game, going on a 22-4 romp to
claim a 30-12 advantage. But Ari
zona wouldn't go away despite the
hard-working defensive hustle of
Hedgpeth. The Cardinal seemed
to have some difficulties on the
defensive end and the Cats
scratched back to a 10-point
deficit.
/'I was disappointed with our
defense in the first half," Van-
Derveer said.
The Cardinal kept cranking on
offense, however, and extended its
lead back to 18 points at halftime
on Henning's spectacular no-look,
around-the-opprnenfVback dish
to Julie Zeilstra. The tally after
the first 20 minutes was 59-41 in

the Cardinal's favor.
The second half was all Stan
ford, and VanDerveer gave her
reserves plenty of game time. The
Cardinal had a chance to break its
all-time high scoring record but
the effort fell three points short of
the current record of 119 points.
"Arizona tried really hard,"
VanDerveer said. "They played
really hard, but they're just not
up to our caliber, not when we're
used to teams like Washington or
Georgia or Tennessee."
Despite the 37-point margin of
victory, Taylor said the Cardinal
could have played better. "We
played all right for a team not
going into the [NCAA] Tourna
ment," she said. "But we plan on
going to New Orleans and win
ning it, so we've still got to work
on some things."
VanDerveer, however, did see
some things in the game that
pleased her. "I was really happy
with Angela's drive and our other

reserves. We've been in some
games in blowout situations —
the last two games they all came
in and helped us a lot. They played
like it was a two point game."
The coach was glad to see her
team running the floor and light
ing it up. Furthermore, in an area
that has been a weak point for her
players, they dominated their
opponents on the boards, 49-34.
But Stanford's ultimate advan
tage in its bid to repeat as national
champions may be something less
tangible than statistics. "Basket
ball is fun for our people on the
floor. They enjoy it. . . . When
you've got a team that's having
fun, they reach down deeper and
play for other people, not just
themselves," VanDerveer said.
Both Taylor and Hedgpeth
echoed that sentiment. "We
always have fun in front of this
crowd," Hedgpeth said. "Plus,
tonight we were pumped up for
Sorya and Trisha."

ball is fun for our people on the
floor. They enjoy it. . . . When
you've got a team that's having
fun, they reach down deeper and
play for other people, not just
themselves," VanDerveer said.
Both Taylor and Hedgpeth
echoed that sentiment. "We
always have fun in front of this
crowd," Hedgpeth said. "Plus,
tonight we were pumped up for
Sorya and Trisha."
