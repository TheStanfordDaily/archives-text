# Crowd salutes seniors' last home appearance
##

There were extra victory balls to toss around on
Saturday night, an evening that marked the end of
an era in Stanford women's basketball history.
The score of Saturday's game against Arizona,
116-79, was certainly impressive but not the real
story of the evening. The most important moment of
the night took place before the game began when the
crowd of 3,295 stood to salute two Cardinal seniors
in their final regular season home game.
When the moment was over, Sonja Henning and
Trisha Stevens stood on the Maples floor in tears.
"What Trisha and Sonja have done for Stanford
basketball is pretty incredible," Stanford coach Tara
VanDerveer said. "The fact that they've lost just two
games here at Maples in their four years is pretty
amazing."
"It was very emotional for the whole team,"
sophomore forward Chris MacMurdo said.
When the ceremony, replete with flowers for the
players and their mothers, was finished, the two
roommates went out and played two different yet
crucial roles in the game.
For Stevens, the moment was specif simply
because she was in uniform for it. She had sat out
two of the last three home games (three out of five
overall) with sore knees and was questionable for
Saturday's game. With a horde of relatives down
from Oregon in attendance, Stevens was just hoping
for a chance to play.
It was a decision that VanDerveer wrestled with.
"I wasn't sure she was going to play at all," Van-
Derveer said. "It was her last home game as a senior
. . . and Trisha always wants to play. I didn't know
what to do."
In the end, however, sentiment won out over secu
rity and big No. 30 started the game. Stevens went
on to score 10 points in just 12 minutes of playing
time before leaving the game for good with 17 min
utes left in the second half.
"I was a little rusty," she said. "It takes a while to
get into the flow of things."
Just to see Stevens play and score was inspira
tional, but Henning had the type of game that tran
scends description. Her dazzling numbers — 22
points, 12 assists, four treys — only tell a part of the
story.
In a rather ho-hum game, Henning had several
stupefying assists, including this one: with only five
seconds left in the half, Henning drove the lane and
dished between two Wildcats to Julie Zeilstra, who
laid it in just before the buzzer.
Henning thought the emotions of the pre-game
ceremony might have lifted her game despite the fact
that she attributed her visible tears to a slight case of
the flu. "It probably had something to do with it,"
the Racine, Wis. native said.
Although the goodbye is somewhat premature
with three regular season games remaining (plus a
very good chance of a second-round NCAA tourna
ment game in Maples), VanDerveer had to confront
the question of what the team will do without two
players who were integral to her program's rapid rise
to the top.
"I thought it was bad last year with Jennifer,
Katy, and Stacy graduating," she remembered. "It's
always tough, but people really improve."
