The Stanford wrestling team capped its
1990-91 turnaround season, taking home two
first-place trophies and a strong sixth place
team finish in the Pacific Ten Conference
Championships held last weekend at Burnham
Pavilion.
Steve Buddie and Steve Yarbrough were the
Cardinal's first individual Pac-10 winners in
five years. Buddie absolutely dominated the
early rounds of the 167-pound weight class.
Seeded second in the nine-man field, the senior
scored a pin at the 2:34 mark against Cal-State
Bakersfield's Leonard Sisneros in his first
match. In the semi-finals, Buddie, who placed
fourth in last season's NCAA finals, took down
Paul Jackson of Boise State in 5:59.
In the finals, the Stanford co-captain was
pitted against old nemesis G.T. Taylor of Ari
zona State. The Taylor-Buddie rivalry dates
back to 1987, when, as a high school senior,
Taylor defeated Buddie in the Ohio state
schoolboy finals. In 1990, the Sun Devil senior,
currently ranked sixth in the country, defeated
Buddie at the Las Vegas Invitationals.
The match was as close as the rivalry indi
cated it would be. Taylor scored a takedown
with 1:06 to go in the first period, and Buddie
quickly countered with an escape. No more
points were scored, unt'l Taylor seemed to tire
late in the second round, and Buddie was
awarded a stalling point.
The two were tied at two heading into the
final period. Taylor, starting the round in the
top position, lost control of Buddie four sec
onds into the period. The escape point was all
that Buddie needed, winning the match by a
score of 3-2.
The Stanford All-American was ecstatic
with the tough win. "Revenge is always sweet,"
said Buddie, currently ranked seventh in the
country. "We both know each other so well,
that each of us has to be perfect to get anything
going. I just wanted this one so badly."
Buddie concluded his career at Stanford
having never lost a match at home. "There's
just something about a home crowd," said the
senior, who improved to 26-2 on the year. "I
guess it's just a matter of pride."
Yarbrough, after plowing into the 177-
pound finals with a technical fall win over
Ramon Diaz of Cal State-Fullerton and a 9-4
decision against Scott Boness of Fresno State,
faced a rival of his own in Bakersfield's Mark
Sheff. ShefT, ranked fifth in the nation, had
split a pair of decisions with Yarbrough, who is
currently ranked 12th. However, when the two
faced each other just two weeks ago at Burn
ham, the Stanford senior had won rather hand
ily.
After a scoreless first period, Yarbrough
scored the match's first takedown just ten sec
onds into period two. The Cardinal senior
remained in control for the majority of the
round and pulled out a gritty 4-2 victory.
"I was a little nervous at first," admitted
Yarbrough, who improved to 28-5 on the year.
"But Buddie's victory inspired me, and I felt as
good as I've felt all season."
