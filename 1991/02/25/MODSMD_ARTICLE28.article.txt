# Gymnasts take third
## 
### Brandi Shipp Staff writer 
In Saturday's Shanaco Invita
tional, held at the Oregon State,
the Stanford women's gymnastics

team finished with a hard-earned
third place finish.
The outlook for the Cardinal,
coming off of two big losses in the
past two weeks, was cloudy as
they faced off against three very

strong schools. The University of
Arizona team is ranked in the top
six women's gymnastics teams in
the NCAA. Hosting Oregon State
is also known as a very talented
team, having made appearances at
the NCAAs consistently for the
past several years. The third
team, Boise State, has also given
the Cardinal tough competition in
the past.
The meet turned out to be an
impressive step in the right direc
tion for the gymnasts. " I think
that we did pretty good," fresh
man Kerrie Kelley said. " It was
not our best meet ever, but we did
really well." Oddly enough,
although they do not consider Sat
urday's competition the best of
the season, Stanford scored its
highest score ever, 188.35 points.
This score, well above the 188.0
point goal that coach Breck
Greenwood had set earlier in the
year, is attributed somewhat to
the fact that Oregon judges are
liberal with points.
Despite this great point total,
the gymnasts still fell to Oregon
State, who earned 193.85 points,
and the University of Arizona,
with 189.70 points. Boise State,
with 187.20 points, picked up the
fourth place spot. The meet, how
ever, was a long awaited change of
pace for the gymnasts. " As a
whole, we did really well. We were
really surprised," freshman Kerri
Kanuka said. Although they
missed the first place title, the
Cardinal gymnasts had several
personal highlights on Saturday.
On the other events, the Stan
ford team excelled as well. Each
of the six beam competitiors
nailed down solid routines, with
no falls among them. Freshman
Mollie Brown, with 9.45 points,
and senior Jennifer Bloom, with
9.5 points, led the Stanford scor
ing on the event. The women were
just as solid on the vault, where
the personal best score of every
Stanford competitor increased.
