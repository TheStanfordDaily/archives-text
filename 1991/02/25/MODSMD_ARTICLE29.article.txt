# Stanford fast at NorCals

The dominant force at Saturday's NorCal
Relays was Stanford's relay teams. Squads from
San Francisco State, Sacramento State, Cal Poly-
SLO and host California could not stay with the
faster Cardinal team.
Early in the meet the men's distance medley
team of Alex Acetta, James Cramton, Dave
Strang and Mark Mastalir blew away the field
with strong performances in every leg. They fin
ished in 9:44.9, cutting nearly 30 seconds off of
last year's time.
"The men's distance relay time is one of the top
in the country so far," Asst. Coach Scott Chisam
said. "Our relays are looking very solid."
In the women's two-mile relay the question
was not who would win but whether California
would even get near Stanford's winning team of
Ashley Black, Susan Helfter, Melanie Bloch and
Jamie Jennings.
The men's two-mile relay was a close race.
Ch/*is Ray was in third when he handed off to
Acetta for the second leg. Acetta edged into the
lead before the baton went to Mark Mastalir. By
the time anchor Dave Strang took off the Cardinal
had a huge lead and Strang only increased it.

Stanford also prevailed in the "everyone runs"
one-mile relay. Neither the men's nor women's
winning teams lost the lead as the men finished
first through third and the women took first in
3:54.2.
In the sprint relays Cardinal teams also looked
impressive. Both the women's 400- and 800-
meter teams won. In last year's 4 by 200, anchor
Chryste Gaines had to catch two California run
ners to win. On Saturday Gaines' teammates gave
her a lead and the race was easy.
The men also did well in the sprint relays,
although Glyn Milburn pulled up a bit on the
backstretch of the 4 by 100 relay. He expects to be
fine in a few days.
Several strong individual performances were
recorded. Gary Stoltz set a meet and personal
record of 9:06 in the men's steeplechase. Dave
Scudamore finished second in the 5,000 and
Peggy Odita was runner-up in the 100 hurdles.
Stanford also had a strong showing inside the
oval. Debbie Malueg won the shotput and took
second in the discus. Alysia Hubbard, Odita and
Jackie Edwards finished one-two-three in the
long jump. The triple jump was also swept by the
Cardinal with freshman Dana Weeks taking first.
"I'm pretty happy with it. I won but it wasn't a
great distance," Weeks said.
