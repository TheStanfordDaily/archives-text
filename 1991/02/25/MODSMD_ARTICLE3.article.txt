# Ramsey-Perez to leave fraternal affairs in April
## 
### John Louie Staff writer 
After serving five months as program
and fraternal affairs adviser, Michael Ram
sey-Perez said yesterday that he has
resigned his position effective April 12.
"I just feel it's time to move on," Ram
sey-Perez said. "I came here as a graduate
student in literature in 1976, and I've been
in the student activities office since 1982.
It's time for me to look forward to new
opportunities . . . and it's time for the office
to have new leadership."
Ramsey-Perez said he will leave Stanford

but did not elaborate on
his plans.
Acting Dean of Student
Affairs Norm Robinson
and Assoc. Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Michael Jack
son — his immediate supe
riors — could not be
reached for comment.
Sally Mahoney, acting
vice president for student

resources, said although she has not
received any formal notice of Ramsey-
Perez's resignation, she informally learned
of it late last week.

Ramsey-Perez said he submitted his let
ter of resignation Feb. 5. but would not
specify further details.
He previously served as assistant dean of
student affairs and director of Student
Organization Services, which became part
of the Office of Student Activities this fall.
As fraternal affairs adviser, he replaced
Michael Hughes, who resigned last spring.
Although his successor has not been
named, he said Nanci Howe, director of stu
dent activities and assistant director of
Tresidder Union, would be a good candi
date for the position. "I have a hunch she
will be the first person asked," Ramsey-

Perez said.
Ramsey-Perez said he thinks the admin
istration will be able to maintain its lines of
communication with the Greek system
after his departure. "Between Robinson
and Jackson, we have people who have lots
of experience in dealing with student
affairs," he added.
Howe echoed his sentiments. "If you
work in student affairs, the actual skills
required are fairly similar whether you're
advising one organization or another.
These are generalist positions," she said.


Ramsey-Perez
However, junior Steven Jar
rett, secretary of the Interfrater
nity Council, said he is unsure
how Ramsey-Perez's resignation
will affect the relationship
between the University and the
council.
"The role of the adviser is
changing now since the IFC is
taking a lot of judicial matters

into its own hands," Jarrett said.
Howe also said she thinks the
Office of Student Affairs will be
affected by Ramsey-Perez's
departure. "In the short-term,
we'll be short-staffed," she said.
"In the interim period, Allison
Sandy will be handling more
[material], and everyone will have
to work a little harder," Ilowe
explained. Sandy works part-time
for Student Affairs and is respon
sible for advising sororities.
Howe said she thinks Ramsey-
Perez's absence will be felt.
