# Swimmers outdistanced by Cal

After exploding off the blocks
with a one-two-three finish in the
first event, the Stanford men's
swimming team slowly sank as
California steadily controlled the
rest of "Big Meet" Saturday after
noon in Berkeley.
Freshmen Derek Weatherford,
Brian Retterer and junior Josh
Mikesell swept the 100-yard back
stroke to open the competition.
Despite first-place finishes by
Weatherford, freshman Tyler
Mayfield, sophomore Erik Maurer
and two big victories in the diving
tank by Brad Wightman, the Car
dinal could not pull out a win,

falling to the Bears 167-134.
"Cal's a better team than they
get credit for. We're a better team
than we get credit for, but we need
to prove that," Asst. Coach Ted
Knapp said.
This final dual meet reflects
the frustrations felt by the Cardi
nal all season. "We're not doing
season bests and we have several
injuries," Knapp said. "The dual
meet season really hasn't pre
pared us for the championship
season.
"I don't think we've rehearsed
anything that we can carry over
into (the conference champi
onships) and NCAAs. We need to
regroup," he said.

The 2-6 swimmers had the
toughest dual-meet schedule in
the nation, competing against
more Top-10 teams than any
other school. The team's philoso
phy of focusing on NCAAs rather
than dual meets also may have
affected their record.
"It's hard because everyone
gets up for Stanford," Retterer
said. "We're pacing for NCAAs
and they're pacing for Stanford."
The Cardinal's main focus —
post-season competition — is just
around the corner. They are plan
ning to make a big splash both at
Pac-lOs in two weeks in Long
Beach, Ca., and at the NCAA
championships over spring break
in Austin, Texas.
