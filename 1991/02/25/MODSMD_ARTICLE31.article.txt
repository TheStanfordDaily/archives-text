Even though they're not there yet, the
Stanford men's golf team is close to becom
ing one of the top collegiate teams in the
nation.
After its second mtyor tournament of the
season at the John A. Burns Intercollegiate
Golf Classic in Hawaii on Friday, the Cardi
nal squad has moved closer to its goal of
challenging the traditional powers in colle
giate golf. Finishing eighth with a three day
total score of 885, Stanford sent a message
to powers like Arizona State and Oklahoma
State: Yes, the Cardinal is on its way.
The best individual performance for the
squad was turned in by senior Johan Rem

melgas, who played impressively after enter
ing the tournament as an individual com
petitor, closing with a one-under 71 in the
final round to finish tied for 14th overall.
"I'm really glad Johan came with us. He
practiced diligently for an hour or two every
night after playing and it really paid off for
him," Stanford men's coach Wally Goodwin
said.
The official Stanford team was led by
freshman Notah Begay. Begay turned in
another outstanding tournament of 218 to
finish tied for 11th overall. He began the
final round on Friday with bogeys on his
first three holes but finished strongly with
an even round of 72.
Close behind was junior captain Chris
tian Cevaer's score of 220, which left him

tied for 20th overall. After a disappointing
showing at the last tournament in Arizona,
Cevaer came back strongly in Hawaii.
"This was Christian's best competition
round for us so far this year. He's definitely
back for us," Goodwin said.
Sophomore Mike Milliken was three
shots behind Cevaer with a 223, followed by
freshman Casey Martin's 225 and sopho
more Dave Rutkowski's 230.
"I really felt good about this tournament.
The team is improving notch by notch, and I
think that's better than just suddenly leap
ing into the top ranks," Goodwin said. "In
my mind, we're in there with the pretty good
teams right now, and in a month or two,
we'll be really ready."
