# Cardinal drops its fifth straight match
## 
### Kevin Jeffrey Staff writer 
Stanford men's volleyball
coach Ruben Nieves and his play
ers called Friday's match against
San Diego State a must-win situa
tion which could end their recent
downturn and put them back in
solid position for a post-season
play.
Instead, Stanford plunged yet
further in the Western Intercolle
giate Volleyball Association stand
ings as they dropped the four
game match to their divisional
rival. The loss left their playoff
hopes in uncertainty.
The 8-15, 15-12, 15-10, 15-9
loss also added another painful
chapter to Stanford's current five
match losing streak, which
dropped their once unblemished
league record to 4-5. Their overall

mark fell under the .500 mark as
well, to 5-6.
Just two weeks ago, the Cardi
nal held sole possession of first
place in the WIVA's Harry Wilson
division. They entered Friday's
match tied with the San Diego
State for third, behind unbeaten
USC and Long Beach State (6-1).
Now Stanford is merely strug
gling to stay in contention for the
league's eight-team post-season
tournament.
The fifth-ranked Aztecs
improved to 7-3 overall and 3-2 in
WIVA play. In the process they
handed the Cardinal its second

straight loss at home, where last
year Stanford was unbeaten in
eight matches.
The Aztecs' league mark is
especially impressive considering
they have played four of five
matches on the road, have already
faced powerhouses USC and Long
Beach State, and have knocked oft
sixth-ranked Pepperdine on the
Waves' home floor. On the other
hand, Stanford's four league wins
have come against WIVA door
mats Brigham Young and Hawaii
and they have already lost to Pep
perdine at Maples Pavilion.
In contrast to their recent
losses, Stanford got off to a quick
start Friday and won the first
game. However, the Cardinal, led
by outside hitter Dave Goss' team
high 18 kills, wasn't able to take a
commanding 2-0 game lead as San
Diego State pulled away at the end

to win the tight second game. The
Aztecs simply outplayed the
demoralized Cardinal in games
three and four and left Maples
with their biggest league victory
of the season.
Stanford played the match
without sophomore outside hitter
Jimmy Klein, who tore an ante
rior cruciate ligament on last
weekend's Southern California
road trip and will be out for Ihe
remainder of the season. Klein is
scheduled to undergo surgery on
the knee sometime this week.
The Cardinal will face a tall
order — literally — in attempting
to keep their losing streak from
reaching six matches as Saturday
they face seventh-ranked UCLA
at Burnham Pavilion. The Bruins
have by far the most height of,any
team in WIVA history, with 11
players at 6-foot-5 or taller.
