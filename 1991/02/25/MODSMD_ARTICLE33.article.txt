# Netters move to 8-0

### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Two years ago, Stanford
women's tennis coach Frank
Brennan said his team was the
"best ever." Last year, remarkably,
the Cardinal women were even
better.

After Stanford upped its season
mark to 8-0 over the weekend the
only question one could logically
ask was, "Is the 1991 edition even
better?"
The Cardinal headed down to
Arizona where traditionally the
Sun Devils and Wildcats put up
quite a fight. This time, well, they
didn't. As a matter a fact, in two
days of tennis, Stanford dropped
just one match — No. 3 doubles
against Arizona State Friday.
About the only other notewor
thy matches against the Sun Dev
ils were first and second doubles.
Both Stanford tandems — Sandra
Birch-Debbie Graham and Teri
Whitlinger-Laxmi Poruri — were
extended to three sets.
Birch and Graham eventually
triumphed 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (8-6) over
Krista Amend and Kristi
Jonkosky. Whitlinger and Poruri
took out Meredith Geiger and
Pam Cioffi 3-6, 6-3, 6-4. The
defeat was suffered by Heather
Willens and Emma Woodhouse.
They lost to Luann Klimchock
and Jennifer Rojohn 6-2, 4-6, 6-4.
Of course, the doubles didn't
make much difference as the Car
dinal swept the singles action.

Graham rediscovered her winning
ways with a 6-4, 6-2 thrashing of
Jonkosky. She had lost the first
dual match of her career just a
week ago at California. Only Kylie
Johnson needed three sets Friday
in singles.
An 8-1 blowout of the No. 7
Sun Devils, which dropped Ari
zona State to 7-2 (1-2 in Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division
play), served as a portent of things
to come. On Saturday, the Wild
cats proved to be just as easy pick
ings as Stanford recorded its fifth
shutout of the season.
The 6-0 final marked the first
time in 1991 that doubles were
not played (although they have
yet to be relevant in determining
the outcome of any match).
Willens went the distance to
knock off Alix Creek 3-6, 6-2, 7-5
at No. 4 singles in the only three
setter on the day. Poruri and Birch
nearly shut out their opponents,
the former crushing Danielle
Klurman 6-1, 6-0 and the latter
smashing Danielle Scott 6-2, 6-0.

Card notes
Graham's 55-match winning
streak overshadowed the fact that
Whitlinger has not lost in duals since
April 8, 1989. Since then she has won
43 straight. The three-time All-Amer
ican is 84-4 in duals over the course of
her Stanford career.
On the season, Stanford is a
remarkable 66-3 in matches played
during dual meets. The non-Graham,
non-Willens-Woodhouse loss was suf
fered by Johnson and Carina Rolley
in a No. 3 doubles match against San
Diego State.
