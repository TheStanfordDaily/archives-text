### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
There was no national title
this year, but with NCAA finals
three months off there was no
alarm either.
The men's tennis team failed
to defend its National Team
Indoors title this past weekend
in Louisville, Ky., falling to USC
5-2 in the semifinals Saturday.
But with the "real" finals quite a
ways off and with its top player
recuperating at Stanford, the
Cardinal was pleased with its
performance as well as the
opportunity to experience some
quality match action.
"You don't like to lose but
there's a difference between los
ing and competing well," Coach
Dick Gould said. "I felt really
positive about what I saw. We'll
be a factor by the end of the
year."
On Friday, Stanford defeated
Miami 5-2 in the quarterfinals to

Men's Tennis

Trojans 5
Cardinal 2

set up its semifinal showdown
with the fourth-seeded Trojans.
USC eventually fell 5-2 to sec
ond-seeded UCLA in the finals.
Saturday's match was high
lighted with wins by Jared
Palmer and Vimal Patel. Palmer,
playing at No. 2 singles, routed
USC's Donny Isack 6-1, 6-2 to
give the Cardinal an early
advantage. Patel, a freshman,
defeated the Trojan's Andres
Lanyi 6-3, 6-4 at No. 5 singles to
keep Stanford in the match.
But the rest of the squad had
a tougher time against the
always competitive Trojans. At
No. 1 singles Alex O'Brien was
downed by Byron Black 6-1, 6-3
and Glen Solomon was defeated
7-5, 6-2 by Brian McFee at the
No. 3 spot. Jason Yee barely

went down to the Trojans' John
Leach 1-6, 6-4 7-6 (10-8) at No.
4 and Michael Flanagan was
defeated by David Ekerot 6-4, 6-
2.
Gould was especially
impressed with Yee's perfor
mance. "Yee did a nice job in his
singles matches. He played very
aggressively and intelligently."
In doubles action Stanford's
No. 3 team was the only Cardi
nal duo to finish play against the
Trojans. Flanagan and freshman
Robert Devens fell to Ekerot and
Isack in three sets, 6-2, 3-6, 6-1
as USC clinched the victory.
"USC is a very good team —
they certainly can beat us any
time during the year, whether or
not we have a full lineup, as can
UCLA and Georgia," Gould said.
"Stanford and these three look
to be pretty strong. They were
the class of the tournament."
Despite the loss and the fail
ure to recapture the title, Gould
was pleased with the Cardinal's

performance and its early-sea
son progress.
"It was a good, solid Weekend.
The guys responded very well to
pressure and on the whole the
team played mentally tough. I
like where we are for this time of
the year," Gould said.
On Friday, Stanford domi
nated the Miami Hurricanes,
who will be traveling to the
Farm for a dual match March 9.
Although the Hurricanes' Con
nie Falk downed O'Brien in
three, 4-6, 6-3, 6-1, the Cardinal
did not have much trouble with
Florida's best.
Palmer defeated Eric Lingen
6-2, 6-7, 6-3, Yee quieted Daniel
Deßoer 6-4, 6-1, Patel downed
Pat Baker 7-5, 6-3, and Flanagan
defeated Stefan Van Schalkowyk
7-6, 6-1. Devens and Flanagan
sealed the match with their vic
tory at No. 3 doubles, a 6-2, 3-6,
6-2 win over Dean Cohen and
Paul Louw.
