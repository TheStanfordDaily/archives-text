# Stanford defeats No. 2 Ohio State

The fourth-ranked, undefeated
Stanford men's gymnastics team
took a huge step towards a
national title Friday afternoon,
mowing down a nine-team field,
which included highly touted pow
ers Ohio State and Arizona State,
at the Santa Barbara invitational.
The Cardinal knew going into
the meet that the competition
would be formidable, as Ohio
State was ranked second in the
country and Arizona State had
just come off a victory over peren
nial power UCLA.
Yet Stanford responded almost
a full-point victory, and in the pro
cess moved itself into the national
spotlight. "People will look at the
results from Friday and say 'Wow,
Stanford beat Ohio Stateâ€”they
must be pretty good.'" Coach
Sadao Hamda said, "I expect us to
move up and be ranked as one of
the top three teams nationally."
But what makes this latest vic

tory even more significant was the
way that the team approached the
meet. If the Cardinal had played it
safe, and thrown less difficult
tricks, it might have won the meet
by a greater margin. But in doing
so the team would have diverged
from its plan for the season, a plan
which was designed by Hamada to
assure that the team peaks for the
NCAA tournament.
"Although we wanted to win,
we needed to go for hard routines
to work towards our primary goal,
the NCAA's." said Hamada,
"Some guys missed, but those
who hit their routines got big
scores."
The Cardinal had more than a
few of these big scores last Friday.
Superfrosh Marc Booth fin
ished second in the all-around,
even though he performed new
routines on pommel horse, floor
exercise, and parallel bars.
"Although I was a little nervous, I
knew that I had done the routines
well in practice, and could do
them in competition." Booth said.

As it turns out, he was absolutely
right, as his average score on
these three events was a healthy
9.53, even though, according to
Hamada, he had some mistakes.
Sophomore All-American Jair
Lynch, who placed third in the all
around, performed a high bar rou
tines that Hamada thought
deserved a perfect 10. Lynch got
only a 9.85, the highest score by
any gymnast on any apparatus in
the meet.
Freshman Jason Cohen, the
top-rated gymnast on floor exer
cise in the country, responded
with a solid 9.65 that should help
him keep that prestigious posi
tion.
But the Cardinal's perfor
mance was also a true team effort.
"Because we were trying new rou
tines, about two people missed on
each event." said Hamada, "But
the other four guys would stick
their routines, and that was
enough to win."
Especially helpful to the victory
was the team's suprising perfor

mance on the still rings, an event
that has given Stanford trouble
throughout the season. The Car
dinal scored a 46.75 on this event,
which, at least on last Friday, was
its third-best apparatus.
"Despite the misses, I saw a lot
of poise in each of our guys in the
meet," Hamada said, "and I think
that the way they performed
under pressure was very signifi
cant."
"We have finished the really
physically tough part of the sea
son, and from now on we must
polish our routines and become
more consistent. When the guys'
mental performance is at its opti
mum level, we will be ready for
the NCAA's."
But the question is: Will the
NCAA's be ready for the Stanford
Cardinal? The team has been
building momentum with every
passing week, beating better and
better competition, and is begin
ning to resemble a runaway loco
motive. And you'd hate to be the
one standing on the tracks.
