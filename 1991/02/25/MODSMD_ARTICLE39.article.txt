### Howard Libit Staff writer 
A new dean of undergraduate admissions to
replace current dean Jean Fetter will be cho
sen by the end of May, acting Vice President
for Student Resources Sally Mahoney said Fri
day.
Mahoney made the announcement at a
meeting with about seven students — includ
ing leaders of several student of color and gay
and lesbian organizations — to discuss the
ongoing restructuring in the Office of Student
Affairs.
Applications for the position will be accept
ed through April, Mahoney said. A short list of
candidates will be compiled by the middle of
May, and the final decision will be made by
Memorial Day, she added.
Mahoney said that after the final candidates

are chosen students will be asked to participate
in the interviewing process in order to offer
feedback and help the candidates better under
stand the University, Mahoney said.
Fetter announced her resignation Jan. 9,
effective Aug. 1.
She also addressed the students' concerns
about how the reorganization of Student
Resources will affect their communities.
Sophomore Maria Peters, co-chair of
MECHA, a Chicano/Latino student group,
asked why the restructuring did not allow rais
ing the number of full-time staff members at
El Centro Chicano from two to three, as the
1989 University Committee on Minority
Issues recommended.
In response, Mahoney said budget con
straints have prevented her office from allocat
ing new resources during the reorganization.
"We must set priorities and focus on things

that are really important. We will continue to
support the center and further address some
issues in the UCMI report," Mahoney said.
"We will maintain our continuing commit
ment to students of color and faculty and staff
of color as well. They are a point of emphasis
because of under-representation," she added.
Questions were also raised about targeting
of minority students in the admissions process.
Sophomore Nelda Brown, vice chair of exter
nal affairs of the Black Student Union and an
ASSU senator, said many high school students
in inner-city schools are overlooked.
Mahoney said budgetary constraints make
it impossible for any institution to recruit
everywhere all the time. She added that per
haps several colleges could work together to
recruit in certain areas, including inner cities
and Native American reservations.
