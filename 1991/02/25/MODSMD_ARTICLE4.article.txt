## 
### Miranda Doyle Staff writer 
A brawl involving about 10 peo
ple broke out at a party at the
Theta Xi house Friday night, leav
ing one student with a fractured
skull. Police called to the scene
broke up the party and arrested
several people for alcohol-related
offenses.
Stanford Police Sgt. Nick
Bruno said police arrested five or
six people for being drunk in pub
lic, but could not give an exact fig
ure. Because the officers involved
had not yet filed their reports,
police released no further infor
mation about the arrests yester
day.
Theta Xi president John
Hamilton said the incident started
at about 12:45 a.m. in the base
ment of the fraternity's house.
The student whose head was
injured, who wished to remain
anonymous, said he and two of his
friends were the only Stanford
students involved in the fight. He
said his friend was told by a per
son from East Palo Alto to move
out of the way. When his friend
refused, the person went upstairs
and brought back about seven
other people with him, the stu
dent said.
The students said these people
surrounded them and started the
fight by punching one of them in
the face. The injured student said
doctors at Stanford Hospital spec
ulated his skull fracture must
have resulted from a kick.
The injured student said he
and his friends left the fraternity
house to get treatment at the hos
pital before the police arrived. The
people they fought left in a car, he
said.
"I think it's very pathetic that
people at this school stood around
and watch as about seven guys
beat up on three students," he
said.
The students said police are
now searching for the people who
started the fight. They say from
other students' accounts stu
dents, at least three of them are
from East Palo Alto.
They added that the matter is
now in the hands of the district
attorney office because of the
extent of the injury.
"There was quite a bit of
blood," said Neal Mahutte, a fra
ternity member who witnessed
the fight.
Freshman Hamish Nixon, who
was at the party, said one person
involved in the fight had a cut on
his forehead and another was
bleeding from the mouth. The vio
lence ended quickly because "peo
ple saw the blood and lost their
appetite for fighting," he said.
During the scuffle a small win
dow was broken, Hamilton said.
Theta Xi resident assistant
Adam Badgett said he called Stan
ford Police when the fight started.
"The police were looking for [the
people involved in the fight], but

as far as I know they did not find
them," he said.
Hamilton said the police
cleared out the basement and
ended the party soon after they
arrived. Five police cars and one
van responded to the call.
Police made a videotape of the
scene "to show what happened
here," Bruno said at the scene.
Standing on the front porch of the
fraternity house, he told several
fraternity members, "I want (Uni
versity President Donald)
Kennedy and the Dean of Stu
dents to see it. Is this a responsi
ble way to hold a party? Do you
know how many kegs of beer you
have in there?"
Hamilton said there were 11
kegs at the party, two of which
were not opened. He said he does
not believe this was an unusually
large amount of beer.
Before the fight, the party "was
going well and under control,"
Hamilton said. "We do our best to
prevent things like this. You can't
predict when something will hap-
JJ
pen.
Badgett said he did not think
non-Stanford students could have
been in the party because frater
nity members were checking for
Stanford ID.
Keith Rabois, vice president of
the Interfraternity Council, said
although he does not know all the
details of the fight, he does not
believe the Theta Xis will be held
responsible.
