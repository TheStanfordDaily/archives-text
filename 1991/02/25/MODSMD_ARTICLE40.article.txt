Israel's trip down the razor's edge of poli
tics, national security and arms control has
reached a critical point because of the Persian
Gulf war, Hoover Institution Senior Research
Fellow Charles Hill said yesterday.
In the keynote address for Israel Education
Day, a program that focused on the war's long
term implications for Israel, Hill told a crowd
of about 400 in Cubberley Auditorium he is
hopeful for a resolution to the Arab-Israeli
conflict.
"I am optimistic, if not for peace, for stabil
ity," he said.
He suggested that Israel's approach to secu
rity must change, since Israel's "aspirations

for self-sufficiency are really a little . . . dream
like" and it can no longer expect to stand alone
against every Arab nation.
Hill also stressed the need for decisive
action to bolster international security.
"This is really a transforming time in the
history of our era. . . . Things are not going to
change unless we change them," he said.
Instead of discussing causes and complica
tions of the Gulf war, Hill focused on its impli
cations, especially in the areas of security,
arms control, the economy and the peace pro
cess. He said the so-called "new world order"
may not stand up to challenges that are not as
"easy" and "clear-cut" as the situation in the
Gulf.
Hill was formerly director of Israel and

Arab-Israeli Affairs and chief of staff of the
State Department under then-Secretary of
State George Shultz.
In one of several smaller workshops after
Hill's address, Anna Azari of the Israeli Con
sulate in San Francisco highlighted Israel's
uncertainty and vulnerability during the war.
"Sadly, the gas mask became the symbol of my
country," she said.
First-year law student Daniel Lubetzky, a
program participant, said he was "really glad
to see Stanford get some different perspectives
on Israel."
Sponsors of yesterday's program include
the Stanford Hillel Foundation and the Jewish
Community Relations Council. Most partici
pants were from nearby communities.
