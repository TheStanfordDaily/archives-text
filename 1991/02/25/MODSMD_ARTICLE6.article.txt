# Students react to ground war
## 
### Mike Laris Editorial staff 
The final U.S. deadline for Saddam Hussein to
begin withdrawing from Kuwait passed at 9 a.m.
PST on Saturday. In the hours before the allied
ground campaign began at 5 p.m., students here
waited for what many considered inevitable, as if
they were privy to an unwanted secret.
In the Okada lounge Saturday morning, fresh
man Elaine Hsieh sat dejected by the television set.
Three students watched with her as it became clear
that Saddam would not meet the deadline.
"I wanted to watch cartoons," she said. "I was
researching cartoons, and I got interrupted," she
said.
Hsieh could have done her research in Roble Hall,
Naranja or almost any other dorm on campus. Dead
line or no deadline, lounge traffic at 9 a.m. Saturday
was, as usual, scarce.
Across campus sophomore Eric Keppler spoke of
the allies over brunch. "They were pretty punctual
after the first deadline. ... I think its going to hap
pen soon," he said. Keppler predicted that when he
emerged from Green Library at the end of the day,
the ground war would likely have started.
Walking by Keppler in the Florence Moore court
yard, freshman N'Gai Croal also said he thought the
ground war would come almost immediately. "I
think deadlines are a bad thing," he said.
When the ground war did start, most students
were not surprised.
In Madera, ten people were watching television in
the lounge as the news came, as opposed to more

than 60 when the air bombardment began Jan. 17.
One person played the piano and two shot pool.
Many people passed through the lounge without
stopping.
"I admit that I have a defeatist attitude about the
war. I can't do anything about it so I don't want to
hear about it," said Sarah Oilman, a freshman.
In Branner, 25 people were gathered in the
lounge, ready to go out for dinner, when news of the
ground war was announced. Freshman Risa Shapiro
said, "It's weird because you read about [warl in his
tory books. It's not something you expect to happen
when you are alive."
In the wake of the announcement, the scene in
Otero also was much different than when news of
the air war was announced. Then, residents said,
they rushed up and down the halls, feverishly ques
tioning each other for news. Some students called
home. Others sat on their beds and cried.
Saturday, however, some Otero residents spent
dinner organizing students to go watch their intra
mural basketball playoffs.
Despite the fact that many expected the news,
some students were still fearful. "I am scared
because I have relatives that will be on the front
lines," said freshman Catrice Monson.
Donner resident Ellen Kennedy said ground com
bat made war more concrete for her.
"Just thinking about friends that are over there,
it is more likely that they will be killed. Man to man
makes it more real."
