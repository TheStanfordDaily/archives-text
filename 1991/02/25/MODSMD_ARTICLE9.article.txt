# Scholars concur on ground war goals
## 
### Peter Robison Staff writer 
Stanford scholars, while disagreeing on the
reasons for the ground war in the Persian
Gulf, predict that ground combat will be lim
ited to Kuwait and southern Iraq.
Political Science Prof. Stephen Krasner said
the U.S. goal is to "humiliate [Saddam] as
much as possible and to defeat him as thor
oughly as possible" and force an internal coup.
Krasner predicted U.S. forces will not
march on Baghdad. "We couldn't hold the
coalition together" if the Iraqi capital were
occupied, because of massive dissent in the
Arab community, he said.
Donald Abenheim, a visiting scholar at the
Hoover Institution, also said U.S. forces will
not occupy Iraq itself.
"There is no pressing political or military
necessity to [take Baghdad]," he said. As it is

now, the war will be fought primarily in open
terrain favorable to allied forces, he added.
Abenheim said Saddam made "an extraor
dinary strategic blunder" by keeping his
Republican Guard units entrenched in south
ern Iraq. The units are not mobile enough to
escape fast-moving ground, air and sea strikes
by the United States, he added.
He estimated the ground war will last any
where from days to several weeks in the worst
case.
Abenheim said he thinks it is "pretty likely"
Saddam will use chemical weapons against
U.S. troops. But he said the Iraqis do not have
an effective means of delivering them because
their air force has been weakened by allied
forces.
"The best way to use gas is by air," Aben
heim said, "but so far only one [Iraqi] heli
copter .. . has been spotted."
The only remaining way to use chemical

weapons is by artillery, which is relatively inef
fective, he said. When artillery is used, U.S.
radar can pinpoint its location and rapidly
return fire.
"They're terrified of shooting their guns
because they give away their position," Aben
heim said.
History Prof. Joel Beinin, an outspoken
critic of U.S. policy against Iraq, said the
United States is "acting pre-emptively to avoid
the possibility of there being a solution other
than a military one."
Beinin said the last-ditch Soviet peace plan
"didn't fail." The United States said the plan
failed in order to start the ground war, he
added.
Political Science Prof. Alexander Dallin, a
Soviet affairs expert, said the U.S. rejection of
the Soviet peace plan will not have a major
effect on U.S.-Soviet relations because "both
sides have tried to downplay the rejection."
