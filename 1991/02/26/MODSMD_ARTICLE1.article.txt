# Will Iraq pull out?
## U.S. SAYS WAR PUSHES ON; SCUD KILLS 27 WAR IN THE GULF 
### 
DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) — The
American war machine, pushing deeper
into Iraq and Kuwait, clashed yesterday
with the elite Iraqi Republican Guard.
Hours later, Baghdad surprised the world
by announcing it had ordered its troops to
withdraw from occupied Kuwait.
The Iraqis, reeling before the advance
of the U.S.-led alliance, fired a Scud mis
sile that struck a U.S. barracks here,
killing 27 U.S. service personnel and
wounding 98, the U.S. command said.
The U.S. statement, released Tuesday
morning, followed a night of searching for
the victims.

The Baghdad radio announcement of a
Kuwait pullout said Iraqi troops "have
completed their duty of jihad," or holy
war. But it did not specify a timetable,
and it threw the diplomatic-military pic
ture into confusion.
It appeared the Iraqis might attempt a
retreat into their home territory under
American fire. If successful, it could foil
the desire of some alliance leaders to
destroy more of Iraq's military power.
White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater told reporters yesterday night
that allied forces "will not attack
unarmed soldiers in retreat but we will

consider retreating combat units as a
movement of war."
Fitzwater said there was no evidence
to suggest the Baghdad radio report was a
genuine peace offer.
A senior Pentagon official said yester
day night allied intelligence sources had
reports of "some movement of (Iraqi)
units going north." "It's too early to say
whether it's repositioning or with

drawal," said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
The official Iraqi radio said President
Saddam Hussein ordered the withdrawal
in line with a Soviet peace plan. A Soviet
plan last week was rejected by Washing
ton, but the Soviets yesterday presented
undisclosed new proposals at a closed
U.N. meeting in New York.
In Washington, the White House dis
missed the Baghdad announcement.
"The war goes on," President Bush's
spokesman said.
The war went well for the Desert
Storm forces yesterday, as they smashed

scores of Iraqi tanks and scooped up thou
sands more prisoners, the U.S. command
reported. Military officials said American
units were having "tremendous success"
in their first battle with the tough Repub
lican Guard.
The forwardmost American troops
were 75 to 90 miles into Iraq, said
informed sources who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
Before the deadly Scud attack, the
command reported U.S. losses so far as
"extremely light" — four Americans
