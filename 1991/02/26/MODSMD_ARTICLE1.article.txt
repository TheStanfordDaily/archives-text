# Will Iraq pull out?
## U.S. SAYS WAR PUSHES ON; SCUD KILLS 27 WAR IN THE GULF 
### 
DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) — The
American war machine, pushing deeper
into Iraq and Kuwait, clashed yesterday
with the elite Iraqi Republican Guard.
Hours later, Baghdad surprised the world
by announcing it had ordered its troops to
withdraw from occupied Kuwait.
The Iraqis, reeling before the advance
of the U.S.-led alliance, fired a Scud mis
sile that struck a U.S. barracks here,
killing 27 U.S. service personnel and
wounding 98, the U.S. command said.
The U.S. statement, released Tuesday
morning, followed a night of searching for
the victims.

The Baghdad radio announcement of a
Kuwait pullout said Iraqi troops "have
completed their duty of jihad," or holy
war. But it did not specify a timetable,
and it threw the diplomatic-military pic
ture into confusion.
It appeared the Iraqis might attempt a
retreat into their home territory under
American fire. If successful, it could foil
the desire of some alliance leaders to
destroy more of Iraq's military power.
White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater told reporters yesterday night
that allied forces "will not attack
unarmed soldiers in retreat but we will

consider retreating combat units as a
movement of war."
Fitzwater said there was no evidence
to suggest the Baghdad radio report was a
genuine peace offer.
A senior Pentagon official said yester
day night allied intelligence sources had
reports of "some movement of (Iraqi)
units going north." "It's too early to say
whether it's repositioning or with

drawal," said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
The official Iraqi radio said President
Saddam Hussein ordered the withdrawal
in line with a Soviet peace plan. A Soviet
plan last week was rejected by Washing
ton, but the Soviets yesterday presented
undisclosed new proposals at a closed
U.N. meeting in New York.
In Washington, the White House dis
missed the Baghdad announcement.
"The war goes on," President Bush's
spokesman said.
The war went well for the Desert
Storm forces yesterday, as they smashed

scores of Iraqi tanks and scooped up thou
sands more prisoners, the U.S. command
reported. Military officials said American
units were having "tremendous success"
in their first battle with the tough Repub
lican Guard.
The forwardmost American troops
were 75 to 90 miles into Iraq, said
informed sources who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
Before the deadly Scud attack, the
command reported U.S. losses so far as
"extremely light" — four Americans
killed find 21 wounded. It also reported the loss of
four U.S. aircraft, three of whose pilots were rescued.
The command said 18,000 Iraqi troops were taken
prisoner in the first two days of the all-out ground
offensive to free Kuwait of Iraq's control.
Marines and U.S. paratroopers tightened their
grip around Kuwait City. But one U.S. official said

"it's going to be a while" before the Americans or
allied Arab troops fight house to house to retake the
capital.
Saudi commander Lt. Gen. Khalid bin Sultan said
the Iraqis continued a reported terror campaign of
"rape, murder and torture" in the city, and warned
they would be "held responsible before an interna
tional court."
In Washington, Bush, continuously updated by

his generals on the progress of the war, told a White
House audience the campaign was "on course and on
schedule."
In bomb-battered Baghdad, meanwhile, where
residents were shaken from their sleep by thunder
ous explosions overnight, military communiques
claimed unbroken triumphs for Iraq's troops.
The ruling party's newspaper urged Iraqi soldier
to "strike with all your force to salvage the nat ; on
from the abyss of slavery."
The Desert Storm offensive was launched early
Sunday along a 300-mile front stretching from the
Persian Gulf coast deep into the western desert.
Under cover of fighter-bombers, columns of tanks
and troops from the United States, Saudi Arabia,
France, Britain and seven other nations rumbled
across the Saudi border, kicking up billowing clouds
of dust.
The unfolding strategy appeared aimed at pinning
down the Iraqis in Kuwait City with Marines and
Saudi and Kuwaiti forces, while sending powerful
allied armored forces through Iraq to loop around
Kuwait's western borders and confront the Republi
can Guard units dug in along its northern frontier.
As part of the western push, U.S. airborne troops
leapfrogged by helicopter at least 50 miles into Iraq
on Sunday to establish a forward support base.
A U.S. command spokesman, Marine Brig. Gen.
Richard Neal, characterized Iraqi resistance Monday
as light to moderate.
The picture of battlefront activity remained
sketchy. The command was issuing only limited
operational information, and dispatches from
reporters in news pools at the front were slow in
reaching rear areas.
Neal said 270 Iraqi tanks had been destroyed in
the operation's first two days, including 35 of the
top-line T-725, the Republican Guard's main battle
weapon.
The Marines engaged an Iraqi armored and mech
anized-infantry force in Kuwait late yesterday morn
ing, and destroyed 50 to 60 tanks, Neal said.


A Saudi army tank crosses a breach in a sand berm as an armored column moves northward inside
Kuwait Sunday. Allied forces continued to engage the Iraqi army yesterday as they closed in on Kuwait
City.
