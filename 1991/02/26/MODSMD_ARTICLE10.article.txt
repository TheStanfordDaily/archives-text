# Kids break down differences to tackle problems of society
##

Need help solving problems of home
lessness, racism, AIDS education or
domestic violence? Ask a kid.
More than 150 junior high and high
school students discussed ways to identify
and solve complex problems like these at
the first "Youth in Action: Building the
YCS Movement" conference Saturday.
The session, organized by Youth Com
munity Service, a national service pro
gram, was held by about 20 Stanford stu
dents and administrators from the Haas
Public Service Center, along with repre
sentatives of local community service
organizations and businesses. The event
took place in Mountain View at the offices
of Sun Microsystems Inc., which also
funded the program.
By having participants grapple with
these issues, the conference intended to
bring the students together through vari
ous workshops and help them develop the
skills necessary to design and implement
public service projects.
Greg Ricks, multicultural educator for
Residential Education at Stanford,
opened the program by urging the partic
ipants to make a difference in their com

munities. "You will get back much more
than you ever give, and it will inspire
you."
Ricks called the gathering an "historic
event" because it brought together stu
dents of very different backgrounds to
brainstorm serious solutions to shared
problems. "You would not be here if peo
ple didn't believe in you," he told the stu
dents.
Throughout the day, students tried to
dream up innovative and exciting ways to
address issues of concern during work
shops and group decision-making pro
jects.
Their solutions to problems ranged
from the fairly simple — taking shorter
showers to conserve water — to the more
complex — such as increasing education
to prevent the spread of AIDS.
Many students discussed issues of dis
crimination and racism. One group devel
oped an idea for a day camp where stu
dents could learn about different ethnic
groups — their food, language and cul
ture — as a way of eliminating prejudices.
Another group hoped to increase
understanding among youth from diverse
backgrounds through rap sessions and
skits about such issues as interracial dat
ing, domestic violence and drug abuse.

In one leadership workshop, facilitated
by Council of Presidents member Good
win Liu, students voiced concern about
problems like discrimination and the lack
of accountability of leaders to their con
stituents. They developed a list of quali
ties of a good leader, which included com
mitment to equality and respect for dif
ferences.
A highlight of the day was an event in
which groups of participants, each with
the help of a Stanford student, identified
a particular problem in their community
and developed a solution for it.
Once the groups settled on a project,
they discussed how to coordinate their
efforts in tandem with school and com
munity officials in order to implement it
successfully.
Organizers said they thought the event
was a success.
Jill Glickman, program coordinator of
Youth Community Service, said the event
succeeded because it brought together
students of different backgrounds and
challenged them. "It expands their vision
of the world — of their community," she
said.
Students also agreed the event was
worthwhile. Tyrone Fitzhugh, an eighth

said he came to learn about leadership
and helping his community. "Today was a
good day — I learned a lot of things. I
wish we had these conversations every
day at school," he said.
Many students said they learned there
are many different ways to help the com
munity and that putting a good project
together is not difficult if they work
together.
Haas Director Catherine Milton said
one of the most important aspects of the
program was the interaction between
diverse groups of students. "This is a way
of building bridges between children in
Palo Alto and East Palo Alto, she said."
Glickman also lauded Stanford's role
in the event, saying Haas' participation
helped make the day a success.
Representatives from various Bay
Area service organizations and busi

nesses were on hand to give the students
a better idea of the resources available to
them and of problems they might
encounter when trying to raise money for
a project.
Each group had to present its project
to these representatives, who had to
approve the "funding" for each plan. The
proposals included planting and main
taining a fruit-and-vegetable garden for a
local homeless shelter and raising money
for a recreation center in a disadvantaged
neighborhood.
In the closing event, a "talk circle"
based on a Native American tradition,
students discussed what they had learned
that day and pledged to continue their
involvement with public service.
Although Youth Community Service
has established programs in only four
local schools, students from 15 schools in
Palo Alto, East Palo Alto and surrounding
cities attended the event. Students and
tutors from Stanford's Upward Bound
program were also at the conference.
Haas provides Youth Community Ser
vice with access to Stanford resources and
facilities and coordinates student involve
ment with the group. There are currently
five Stanford student representatives for
the four schools the program serves.
