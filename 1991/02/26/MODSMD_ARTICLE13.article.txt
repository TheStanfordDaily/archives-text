U.S. Army helicopter crash kills 5
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) - A
U.S. Army helicopter crashed in a lake east of
San Salvador shortly after takeoff yesterday,
killing the five Army personnel aboard, offi
cials said.
The pilot of the UH-1H had reported
mechanical trouble minutes before it went
down in Lake Ilopango, at the edge of the cap
ital, U.S. Embassy spokesman Jeff Brown said.
A U.S.-Salvadoran search for the bodies was
suspended at mid-afternoon. U.S. divers said
they had located the spot where they believe
the helicopter crashed but that the wreckage
was about 270 feet down, too deep to reach.
A U.S. officer said the salvage crew would
report back to authorities in San Salvador
before determining what more might be done
to recover the bodies.
Wilson says emergency drought
measures may be needed soon
SACRAMENTO (AP) - Gov. Pete Wilson
said today California's drought "is worse than
we feared," and confirmed that virtually no
more water is available from the State Water
Project.
Wilson, however, stopped short of invoking
emergency powers to deal with the shortage,
but said that he "may well be" utilizing that
authority in the near future.
The Republican governor said state water
officials had alerted the major purchasers of
SWP water that supplies for cities have to be
reduced dramatically — to 10 percent of nor
mal — and that what little was left had to be
preserved carefully.
Wilson said the latest round of cuts were
made necessary by the continuing warm
weather, an accelerated depletion of the state
snowpack and a state-wide dry spell.
Administration criticized for
diverting airline safety funds
LOS ANGELES (AP) - The federal gov
ernment has been sluggish in upgrading the
nation's air traffic control system and making
it easier for passengers to survive airplane
crashes, witnesses told a congressional hearing
yesterday.
Mayor Tom Bradley criticized the Bush
administration for using a $7 billion aviation
trust fund to balance the budget at the expense
of passenger safety.
"We cannot balance the budget of this
nation with the lives of the people who are
placed in danger," Bradley told a hearing of the
House Government Activities and Transporta
tion Subcommittee at Los Angeles Interna
tional Airport.
