# Warsaw Pact renounces military functions

### 
BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — The
Warsaw Pact effectively went out of
business yesterday, ending a 35-year
confrontation with NATO that divided
Europe between the two alliances and
created history's costliest arms race.
Defense and foreign ministers of
Warsaw Pact members formally dis
solved the East Bloc alliance's military
functions in a 20-minute ceremony at
a luxury Western hotel on the Danube
River.
Countries signing the agreement —
the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia,
Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria and Roma
nia — agreed to meet in Prague by
July 1 to disband the alliance's
remaining structures.
A meeting planned later this week

in Budapest to disband Comecon, the
Soviet-led equivalent of the European
Common Market, was postponed
indefinitely.
Foreign Minister Alexander Bess
mertnykh and Defense Minister
Dmitri Yazov of the Soviet Union
looked glum as they put their names to
the document ending the alliance
Moscow forged in 1955 as a counter
weight to the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
By contrast, Jiri Dienstbier and
Lubos Dobrovsky of Czechoslovakia
smiled broadly. Both men, foreign and
defense minister respectively, are for
mer dissidents who fought the ortho
dox Communist regime imposed by a
Warsaw Pact invasion that ended the

liberal "Prague Spring" of 1968.
"The military bloc system as such
has come to an end today," Foreign
Minister Geza Jeszensky of Hungary
told reporters after the ceremony.
Poland's foreign minister, Krzysztof
Skubiszewski, said: "When you
deprive the Warsaw Treaty of its mili
tary essence, it becomes more or less
an empty shell."
The documents signed Monday pro
vide that the Soviet-dominated mili
tary command will be disbanded by
March 31 and six secret agreements
that bound Eastern Europe to Moscow
will be annulled.
Dienstbier and Jeszensky of
Czechoslovakia indicated the Warsaw
Pact's other functions would be abol

ished by the end of the year.
Disagreements between the Soviets
and their former East European satel
lites remained beneath the surface.
The Soviets did not appear at a news
conference after the meeting and Hun
garian officials said they may already
have left Budapest.
Soviet officials were reluctant to
comment on the meeting. Their
absence from the news conference sug
gested Moscow wanted the Warsaw
Pact to die quietly. The Soviets also
insisted that the agreements annulled
yesterday remain secret.
Dienstbier said the annulled docu
ments were essentially uninteresting
and that the continued secrecy showed
the Soviets had not discarded old ways.
