## The 						right to know 
### 
Information should not
be withheld because it
is politically damaging

SATURDAY'S STATEMENT
from Secretary of Defense
Dick Cheney sets a dangerous
precedent for the future. Though
the public's access to news from
the Gulf has not been seriously
limited during the first few days of
the ground war, Cheney's official
suspension of regular Pentagon
news briefings, and similar moves
toward media censorship that have
occurred over the last six months,
threaten the public's right to know.
There is no question that certain
information — like troop move
ments — should be withheld from
the public out of military necessity.
But this should be the sole crite
rion for legitimate censorship.
Politically damaging information
should not be withheld under the
guise of military necessity.
If information demanded by the
press jeopardizes the American
military position, a "no comment"
from the Pentagon is an acceptable
response. This tacitly recognizes
the right of the press to search out
the facts, and it implies the exis
tence of a legitimate overriding
military interest.
Yesterday, Central Command in
Riyadh briefed the press concern
ing recent activities and casualties.
This action does not settle the
issue of press accessibility. It is still
unclear whether the American
public will hear from Gen. Brent
Scowcroft in the event that our
forces face a serious setback in the
near future.
This apprehension is com
pounded by the fact that a U.S. Dis
trict Court yesterday affirmed a
military order banning photogra
phy by the press of coffins contain

ing the dead bodies of U.S. service
men. There is no justification for
this order other than the military's
desire to avoid a political backlash
at home.
If restrictions such as these are
placed upon news from the Gulf,
the public's expectations for infor
mation will fall. As this occurs, the
body politic will become more apa
thetic, and consequently the activi
ties of the military will be con
doned without intense critical
examination.
Restrictions upon the press will
give the Pentagon the opportunity
to censor that information which
they find politically damaging and
selectively release favorable news.
Furthermore, the probability
that misinformation will circulate
is great. The information vacuum
will allow unfounded rumors to cir
culate with more perceived credi
bility.
During times of war, the impor
tance of a free press can be seen
looking back on the Vietnam War
experience. Touching pictures of
agony and despair were largely
responsible for mobilizing opposi
tion to the war.
Similarly, the dissemination of
pictures and reports from the Gulf
allow those on both sides of the
issue to speak from knowledge, not
ignorance.
Some have argued that opposi
tion to U.S. action has been small
because the American public
hasn't seen the reality of the war. A
free flow of information insensitive
to military operations would allow
for this hypothesis to be tested.
Undoubtedly, public opinion would
be moved in one direction or the
other.
The press has a two-fold obliga
tion to the public. Journalists must
not compromise American military
efforts, but at the same time they
must not allow the military to
neglect the public's right to know.
The press must reassert itself.
