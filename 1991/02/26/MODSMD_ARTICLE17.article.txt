Blaming Arabs for the past unfairly clouds issues

THE WARPED LOGIC OF Marco
SchufTelen's letter, "Israel is undo
ing Arab repression, colonialism,"
published in The Daily on Feb. 14, is
striking.
Schuffelen bases his argument on the
so-called repression that the Arabs
inflicted on the Jewish people for cen
turies, but his historical accounts are
open to question. For instance, India was
never overrun by the Arabs, but by other
Muslim conquerors, and the time Schuf
felen claims this event happened is off by
several centuries.
Schuffelen looks back at events that
occurred hundreds of years ago, and tries
to justify Israeli acts of violence on that
basis. Mohammed's alleged killing of
Jews has little relevance to today's situa
tion in the Middle East. How can one
hope to resolve modern-day issues if one

condemns an entire community because
of the actions of certain people in the
past?
SchufTelen's defense of the Israeli
killing of Palestinians during the
Intifada is that Israel killed fewer people
than Arab governments did while
quelling similar demonstrations!
So Israel won the numbers game â€”
what does that prove? What does one
achieve by attempting to show that the
Israeli government is less repressive
than some Arab governments?
Certainly, the Syrian, Algerian and
Moroccan regimes are not exactly models
of benevolent governments. But does
that make Israel's actions any less horri
fying? And do these acts by a handful of
dictators totally negate any validity in
the Arab viewpoint with respect to the
Palestinian issue?

Schuffelen makes no attempt to con
sider the Arab point of view. The Arabs
are not just some hate-filled, vitriolic
people who are incapable of rational
thought. It is unfortunate that they are
often portrayed as such in the West.
When you consider the fact that in
1920, out of 700,000 occupants of Pales
tine, only 60,000 were Jewish, and that
Jewish immigration in the hundreds of
thousands (with the acquiescence of the
ruling British and because of terrible
persecution by the Germans), led to the
formation of Israel, you may be able to
understand why the Arabs feel cheated.
The United Nations resolution of
1948 was passed by a security council
dominated by Western nations. This res
olution, which Israel willingly accepted,
compromised the political rights of the
Palestinians.

It gave to Israel half of the land that
had been predominantly Palestinian only
three decades earlier. It is no wonder
that the Arabs rejected it. Israel's record
of obeying subsequent U.N. resolutions
with respect to its occupation of Pales
tinian territories has hardly been stellar.
However, I refuse to fall into the same
trap that Schuffelen did. I will not say
that Israel should cease to exist today,
simply because the arrogant and conde
scending attitude of the British towards
the Arabs four decades ago led to its cre
ation.
All I am asking is that an attempt be
made to understand all opinions rather
than resorting to blanket condemnation
of an entire class of people.
