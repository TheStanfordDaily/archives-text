# Kennedy outrageous in billing government for wedding reception
## 
### 
At first I was very skeptical of the
government's allegations concerning the
overbilling of indirect costs — $150 mil
lion is a lot of money to overcharge. And
where was that money going? Certainly
not to any of the friends I knew who
were doing research.
A variety of generalizations can be
made about graduate students doing
research, but flush with cash is not one
of them, especially when 78 percent of
their money goes to the University.
As time went on, I came to believe
that no criminal intent was involved, but
that the University probably employed
some of the worst accountants on the
West Coast. It was probably all just a big
mistake that was going to make the Uni

versity look bad in the national press.
Now I'm mad. Mad as hell. It's absurd
— $17,500 for a wedding reception
picked up by the University.
Even if a lot of big donors showed up
at the reception, it certainly wasn't the
government's bar tab. I know many
research labs on campus that would fight
very hard for a mere fraction of that
booze bill.
So back to the question of criminal
intent. I know that certain accounts are
charged to the government by the Uni
versity. For example, certain copiers
around campus read "For government
sponsored research purposes only."
I expect that President Kennedy
would be intimately familiar with the
workings of government accounts, which
he probably first encountered years back
as a professor in the Department of Biol
ogy-
If he has not figured out these
accounts by now, we need another presi
dent — and did a long time ago.

Also, I find it very hard to believe
Kennedy didn't know which account was
picking up the bill for his own wedding
reception; this could not have been a
simple administrative mistake.
Defrauding the government is a
crime. Ignorance, which I doubt is the
case here, is no excuse anyway.
President Kennedy, to save the name
of this great University and the funding
that is its lifeblood, you should resign.
