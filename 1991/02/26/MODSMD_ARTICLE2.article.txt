# Theta Xi suspended
## Police search for fight witnesses 
### Miranda Doyle Staff writer 
The University placed the
Theta Xi fraternity on social sus
pension yesterday as Stanford
Police and the administration con
tinue to investigate a fight that
broke out at a party there Friday
night.
Program and Fraternal Affairs
Adviser Michael Ramsey-Perez
said the fact the University's deci
sion to suspend the fraternity
"does not mean we know what
happened or have made a judg
ment," he said. Fraternities on
social suspension may not host
social events.
The suspension will be in effect
until an investigation by Ramsey-
Perez and Assoc. Dean of Student
Affairs Michael Jackson is com
pleted. At that time, Jackson will
make a recommendation to acting
Dean of Student Affairs Norm
Robinson about whether the fra
ternity was at fault.
Interfraternity Council Presi
dent Erik Jorgensen objected to
the suspension, charging that the
fraternity had been punished
before it was proven guilty He
also said the IFC — and not the
University — should investigate
the incident. "We thought they
had given us that job," he said.
Police said they are looking for
witnesses of the fight in hopes of
pressing charges against a man
who allegedly kicked a Stanford
student in the head and fractured
his skull.
"We are pretty sure the victim
was kicked in the head when he
was down," said Stanford Police
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer. "If any
body saw the actual blow that was
struck, they should come for
ward."
Stanford Hospital spokesper
son Jody Donaldson said doctors
told the injured student his skull
fracture probably resulted from a
kick, since a punch would not
have caused as much damage. The
student was released Sunday, she
said.
Niemeyer said police believe
four of the about seven people
who fought with three Stanford
students were from East Palo
Alto. Though all seven fled the
scene before police arrived,
Niemeyer added they have identi
fied at least one of the men and
will be questioning him.
However, he said police will not
be able to press charges unless
they obtain witnesses to identify
the alleged assailant. The man
could be charged with assault
with intent to do great bodily
harm — a felony, Niemeyer said.
Police arrived at the fraternity
house at about 12:45 a.m., several
minutes after the fight began in
the house's basement, and broke
up the party. The two students
involved in the fight accompanied
their injured friend to Stanford
Hospital before police came.
Two other students at the
Theta Xi fraternity house and
three more people in the area of
the party were arrested for being
drunk in public.
Niemeyer said there were con
flicting reports among students at
the party about the seven men the
three students allegedly scuffled
with. He said the three other stu
dents not from East Palo Alto may
have been from San Diego.
In addition, Niemeyer question
the fraternity's security proce
dures at the party "It seems like
[Theta Xi] did not do a very good
job of checking for IDs," he said.
Theta Xi president John
Hamilton said the fraternity was
checking for Stanford IDs and he
is not sure how non-Stanford peo
ple got into the party.
"Possibly there could have been
a lapse at the door," he said. He
added that the men may have
sneaked in on a fire escape or
some other way.
Although Ramsey-Perez said
he does not know all the facts
about the incident, he said it is the
responsibility of a party's hosts to
assure the safety of everyone
attending. "Alcohol, it appears,
had something to do with the"
fight, he added.
He also expressed concern
about the possibility that some of
the men involved were not Stan
ford students and stressed the
importance of controlling access
to a party by checking IDs.
