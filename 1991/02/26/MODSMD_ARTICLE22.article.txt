## On means and ends 
### 
ON SATURDAY, SHORTLY AFTER
President Bush announced the
start of the land war, a television
report discussed "important information
about how Bush reached this risky and
difficult decision."
I decided to watch "Star Trek"; at least
that show has an honest commander and
no media to glorify and justify his every
decision.
What difficult decision did Bush make?
The date for the ground offensive had
already been set two weeks earlier. The
only "difficulty" was that annoying Soviet
peace plan, meeting most U.N. resolu
tions but not Bush's goals. How better to
clear our conscience about ignoring such
an opportunity for peace than by
announcing a nearly unsatisfiable ultima
tum, so that we could proceed with our
planned attack?
And where was the risk? Bush's only
real risk is that the war will end too soon
for people to remember it come re-eiec
tion time. He could have tried to improve
the peace plan, but war is better for
domestic approval ratings, so it was the
"safer" choice.
Anyway, enough about state-sponsored
wars. Today I want to discuss a different
topic: terrorism, as practiced by groups
such as the Irish Republican Army, the
Palestine Liberation Organization and
the Basque separatist movement.
I strongly support the causes of most,
if not all such groups. For instance, I fail
to understand why Britain must occupy
Northern Ireland. Similarly, Israel's con
tinued occupation of the West Bank and
the Gaza Strip is inexcusable. But that

does not imply that any means are justi
fied to end those occupations.
The Irish Republican Army set off two
bombs in London railroad stations last
Monday, killing one person, wounding 40
and disrupting the city for days. Such
attacks on civilians are hardly new;
bombings of London subway stations also
took place during the 19705. In 1983, a
bomb killed six shoppers at Harrods in
London, and last year the IRA killed two
Australians committing the sin of driving
a British car in the Netherlands. (They
apologized for the latter, though — how
polite!)
The IRA intends such attacks to pro
vide publicity and to create an atmo
sphere of civic uncertainty Neither will
bring them closer to their goal of ending
the British occupation of Northern Ire
land, but that seems to be of no concern.
In fact, these attacks amount to little
more than random retribution for the
injustices of the British occupation.
Of course, terrorist attacks do reap
their share of publicity. Last week's
attack dramatically reminded the British
that the conflict with Iraq is not their
only war, but the overwhelming reaction
was one of condemnation and disgust.
IRA attacks have never served to
increase the support for the republican
cause, nor have they caused the British to
pressure their government to get out of
Northern Ireland. Publicity — even if
counterproductive — has apparently
become an end in itself, and some
deranged souls have decided that killing
civilians provides the most publicity per
bomb.

Terrorist attacks never advance a just
cause. Even when the immediate aim of
civic terror is achieved, people do not
pressure their rulers to give in to terrorist
demands. Instead, they call for increased
government control and protection.
The only terrorist acts in recent years
that were nearly successful took this into
consideration. In the early 1980s, right
wing terrorists bombed trains in Italy,
hoping to create an environment of fear
in which they could impose authoritarian
rule. There were, in fact, calls for
increased state power, but democracy pre
vailed.
Many terrorists continue to believe in
random violence as a means to achieve
their goals, notwithstanding evidence to
the contrary accumulated over the years.
They feel, apparently, that their cause is
more important than the lives of any
number of innocent civilians. If they were
ever to achieve their ends and ascend to
the government of a new state, we would
have a ruling group that believes murder
ing those who disagree or stand in their
way is worthwhile and justified. That in
itself should be enough of an argument
never to give in to such groups.
