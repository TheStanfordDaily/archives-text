## Miguel Canales and Michael Canul Stanford should keep de Necochea as Latino community leader 
### 
WE WRITE TO CHALLENGE
Professor Jerry Ignacio Porras of
the Graduate School of Business.
His remarks (The Daily, Feb. 11) that
the termination of the Office of Mexican-
American Affairs and layoff of Assistant
Provost and Advisor to the President
Fernando de Necochea will be "no great
loss," are far from accurate; just the
opposite is true.
Mr. de Necochea needs no defense
from us. He has a distinguished record
in Latino leadership and contribution in
California and across the nation; a
record that is unsurpassed by any other
Latino at Stanford.
We respect his record and value his
many contributions including his work
on the University Committee on Minor
ity Issues, the CIV curriculum and the
Stanford in Washington program.
Stanford cannot afford to lose a
Latino senior administrator of his cal
iber. A broad cross-section of Latino stu
dents are united in keeping the Office of
Mexican-American Affairs open. It is a
key resource for these students.
Porras does not, and has absolutely no
grounds to, speak for Latino students or
groups. Nor does he have a basis to pass

himself off as a Latino "elder" or a
"spokesman" on Latino issues.
For evidence, you only need to look at
his record at the Business School, where
he has been a faculty member for 20
years, and has provided no Latino leader
ship.
According to the UCMI report, the
Business School has the most mediocre
record of any Stanford school with
respect to Latinos and minorities. Porras
has done little to change that. He has
never sponsored or initiated any Latino
faculty appointments, visiting or regular;
any Chicano Ph.D. graduates; or any
Latino programs, conferences, seminars,
research or public service programs.
In addition, also according to the
UCMI report, of the three Hispanics
admitted to the Business School from
1985 to 1988, "One of two non-targeted
Hispanics graduated and one withdrew .
. . [and] one Chicano withdrew after
being enrolled for one quarter."
Porras' 20-year record as an organiza
tional behavior professor at Stanford
shows zero Latino research, teaching
publications, public or professional ser
vice. Judging from his record, the world
of business has no Latino dimension, no

Latino impact and no Latino signifi
cance.
Porras has also done zero professional
work on minority issues, race relations
and affirmative action. It is as if Latinos
and minorities did not exist in the world
of business.
For being an organizational decision
making "specialist," Porras has never
given more than a minimal effort to
improve the presence of minorities at the
Business School, nor has he contributed
his so-called "expertise" to improving the
decision-making processes of organiza
tions such as MALDEF (the Mexican-
American Legal Defense and Education
Fund), LULAC (the League of United
Latin-American Citizens), MAPA (the
Mexican-American Political Association)
and other groups that are working daily
to improve the status of Latinos in the
United States.
Perhaps someday we may hear of Por
ras making a contribution, but until now,
we have come to view Porras as only a
"part-timer" in the Latino community.
Porras has close to zero contact with
Latino undergraduates at Stanford. He's
a "Johnny come lately" to the develop
ment of El Centro Chicano after con-

tributing nothing from 1980 through
1989.
In 1989, he "rubber-stamped" the dis
graceful forced resignation of the former
dean of El Centro Chicano — without
ever consulting with Dean Yniguez, the
Latino staff and other affected student
groups.
Now he is rubber-stamping the cen
tral administration's decision to termi
nate the Office of Mexican-American
Affairs and to lay ofT Mr. de Necochea
and the office's administrative assistant,
Sylvia Castillo.
The administration has appointed
him to consultant positions in a reorga
nization process that has eliminated
important Latino positions and pro
grams without consulting the students
who were affected by the decisions.
We question why a professor with Por
ras' limited background would try to
undermine a vital student resource.
Latino student groups (12 of 14 orga
nizations including the largest, the
Latino Student Association) are united
in reversing the elimination of the Office
of Mexican-American Affairs.
Latino students had to struggle to cre
ate these positions and programs. We've

periodically had to struggle to keep them
and that is what we're doing now with
the help of concerned faculty and staff,
our parents and Latino community lead
ers.
Latino needs must be a priority. We
refuse to let Stanford roll back the clock
25 years in the name of progress.
The "new management culture" is the
Old Stanford in disguise: rich, self-satis
fied, smug and devoted to luxury and
trivial pursuits.
Latinos are almost 30 percent of Cali
fornia's population, close to 10 percent of
the national population and projected to
become the largest single minority group
in the year 2000.
Our community has needs and aspira
tions. We came to Stanford to receive an
education that would prepare us for lead
ership.
We refuse to let Stanford downgrade
our future, and are outraged that Porras
and the Stanford administration have
endangered the Latino community's
future.

refuse to let Stanford roll back the clock
25 years in the name of progress.
The "new management culture" is the
Old Stanford in disguise: rich, self-satis
fied, smug and devoted to luxury and
trivial pursuits.
Latinos are almost 30 percent of Cali
fornia's population, close to 10 percent of
the national population and projected to
become the largest single minority group
in the year 2000.
Our community has needs and aspira

education that would prepare us for lead

We refuse to let Stanford downgrade
our future, and are outraged that Porras
and the Stanford administration have
endangered the Latino community's
future.

WE WRITE TO CHALLENGE
Professor Jerry Ignacio Porras of
the Graduate School of Business.
His remarks (The Daily, Feb. 11) that
the termination of the Office of Mexican-
American Affairs and layoff of Assistant
Provost and Advisor to the President
Fernando de Necochea will be "no great
loss," are far from accurate; just the
opposite is true.
Mr. de Necochea needs no defense
from us. He has a distinguished record
in Latino leadership and contribution in
California and across the nation; a
record that is unsurpassed by any other
Latino at Stanford.
We respect his record and value his
many contributions including his work
on the University Committee on Minor
ity Issues, the CIV curriculum and the
Stanford in Washington program.
Stanford cannot afford to lose a
Latino senior administrator of his cal
iber. A broad cross-section of Latino stu
dents are united in keeping the Office of
Mexican-American Affairs open. It is a
key resource for these students.
Porras does not, and has absolutely no
grounds to, speak for Latino students or
groups. Nor does he have a basis to pass

himself off as a Latino "elder" or a
"spokesman" on Latino issues.
For evidence, you only need to look at
his record at the Business School, where
he has been a faculty member for 20
years, and has provided no Latino leader
ship.
According to the UCMI report, the
Business School has the most mediocre
record of any Stanford school with
respect to Latinos and minorities. Porras
has done little to change that. He has
never sponsored or initiated any Latino
faculty appointments, visiting or regular;
any Chicano Ph.D. graduates; or any
Latino programs, conferences, seminars,
research or public service programs.
In addition, also according to the
UCMI report, of the three Hispanics
admitted to the Business School from
1985 to 1988, "One of two non-targeted
Hispanics graduated and one withdrew .
. . [and] one Chicano withdrew after
being enrolled for one quarter."
Porras' 20-year record as an organiza
tional behavior professor at Stanford
shows zero Latino research, teaching
publications, public or professional ser
vice. Judging from his record, the world
of business has no Latino dimension, no

Latino impact and no Latino signifi
cance.
Porras has also done zero professional
work on minority issues, race relations
and affirmative action. It is as if Latinos
and minorities did not exist in the world
of business.
For being an organizational decision
making "specialist," Porras has never
given more than a minimal effort to
improve the presence of minorities at the
Business School, nor has he contributed
his so-called "expertise" to improving the
decision-making processes of organiza
tions such as MALDEF (the Mexican-
American Legal Defense and Education
Fund), LULAC (the League of United
Latin-American Citizens), MAPA (the
Mexican-American Political Association)
and other groups that are working daily
to improve the status of Latinos in the
United States.
Perhaps someday we may hear of Por
ras making a contribution, but until now,
we have come to view Porras as only a
"part-timer" in the Latino community.
Porras has close to zero contact with
Latino undergraduates at Stanford. He's
a "Johnny come lately" to the develop
ment of El Centro Chicano after con-

tributing nothing from 1980 through
1989.
In 1989, he "rubber-stamped" the dis
graceful forced resignation of the former
dean of El Centro Chicano — without
ever consulting with Dean Yniguez, the
Latino staff and other affected student
groups.
Now he is rubber-stamping the cen
tral administration's decision to termi
nate the Office of Mexican-American
Affairs and to lay ofT Mr. de Necochea
and the office's administrative assistant,
Sylvia Castillo.
The administration has appointed
him to consultant positions in a reorga
nization process that has eliminated
important Latino positions and pro
grams without consulting the students
who were affected by the decisions.
We question why a professor with Por
ras' limited background would try to
undermine a vital student resource.
Latino student groups (12 of 14 orga
nizations including the largest, the
Latino Student Association) are united
in reversing the elimination of the Office
of Mexican-American Affairs.
Latino students had to struggle to cre
ate these positions and programs. We've

periodically had to struggle to keep them
and that is what we're doing now with
the help of concerned faculty and staff,
our parents and Latino community lead
ers.
Latino needs must be a priority. We
refuse to let Stanford roll back the clock
25 years in the name of progress.
The "new management culture" is the
Old Stanford in disguise: rich, self-satis
fied, smug and devoted to luxury and
trivial pursuits.
Latinos are almost 30 percent of Cali
fornia's population, close to 10 percent of
the national population and projected to
become the largest single minority group
in the year 2000.
Our community has needs and aspira
tions. We came to Stanford to receive an
education that would prepare us for lead
ership.
We refuse to let Stanford downgrade
our future, and are outraged that Porras
and the Stanford administration have
endangered the Latino community's
future.
