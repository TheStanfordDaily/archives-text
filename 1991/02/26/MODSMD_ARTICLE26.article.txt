## Williams ready to snap the streak Stanford faces Arizona at McKale looking toward the postseason 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
Thirteen thousand screaming
maniacs, the nation's longest
home winning streak and seven
long years of futility will all say
howdy to the Stanford men's bas
ketball team tonight, as the Cardi
nal takes on the Arizona Wildcats
in Tucson.
Sixty-one times in the last four
years, a visiting team has come
into Arizona's McKale Center,
looking for a win. Each and every
one has left with a loss, including
Stanford, which hasn't won in
Tucson since 1984.
One huge reason for that 61-
game streak is McKale's crowd,
which is the loudest west of
Duke's Cameron Indoor Stadium.
(Yes, we know, crowds rarely score
points during games. Still. . .)
During most of those games the
crowd has been larger than
McKale's capacity: the arena
holds 13,477, and last year the
Wildcats' average home atten
dance was 13,636.
Let's just say it's loud. It dis
rupts offenses, plays hell with
game plans and rattles the occa
sional player.
Like, say, a freshman who's
started all of two games in his col
lege career.
"It's definitely not just another
game," says forward Brent
Williams, who's spent most of the
season coming off the bench but
started the last two games for the
Cardinal. "I'll be a little nervous,
but nothing that's gonna keep me
from doing the things I usually do.
"I'm looking forward to playing
them. We've just got to go out
there and show everybody that we
can beat a team like Arizona. . . .
We're going to go out, we're going
to compete, and we're going to

take 'em."
For the Cardinal to do that,
however, it will have to overcome
much more than The Crowd and
The Streak: Stanford also has to
beat its own inability to do much
of anything this season on the
road, where the team is 2-6.

1 couldn't believe it.
At halftime I was just
thinking "Shoot, we
should be killing
these guys."'

The latest poor showing came
last Thursday at Arizona State,
when the Sun Devils disrupted
the Cardinal to the tune of 75-57.
"I don't know what happened,"
Williams says. "We should have
come out hungry and we should
have torn those guys apart. I
think they're the weakest team in
the Pac-10.
"I couldn't believe it. At half
time I was just thinking 'Shoot,
we should be killing these guys.'
. . I can't understand things like
that. We undersold ourselves by
not coming out hungry."
Williams had eight points in
that game, all of them in the first
half. For the season, he's averag
ing four points and 3.3 rebounds a
game — 8.3 and 5.8 in the team's
last six games, during which he's
become a starter.
The first start was against
UCLA two weeks ago, in front of a
sellout crowd at home. "I felt
pretty nervous," Williams says,
"but I just said 'Brent, don't get
too pumped up for the game,
because getting over-ready for the
game is going to make you mess

up. Just prepare.'
"I just went over the plays,
what I was supposed to do; I knew
exactly what my assignment was.
Just going over those things in my
mind helped to get rid of some of
the nervousness.
"When you're sitting there
waiting to go in, that makes you
kind of nervous," Williams says,
"but when you're in there and
everything just happens you don't
have time to think about being
nervous."
Apparently not, because
Williams scored a career-high 14
points and grabbed a career-high
nine rebounds before fouling out
in the Cardinal's 89-86 loss to the
Bruins.
And so, after the game against
the Bruins and another good
effort Thursday night at Arizona

State, Williams will make his
third start tonight. And the player
he will probably be guarding is
Chris Mills, the MVP of the pre
season NIT, won by Arizona. But
Williams isn't worried about start
ing opposite the man most people
expected to be the conference's
newcomer of the year.
"I'm excited," Williams says. "A
freshman getting as much playing
time as I am, there's no way I
can't be excited."
Stanford will need to be excited
— and then some — tonight.
Card notes
Stanford center Jim Morgan did
not make the trip to Arizona after
spraining his knee at practice. The
loss of the Cardinal's tallest player
just might be a problem against the
Wildcats trio of seven-footers.

Duke's Cameron Indoor Stadium.
(Yes, we know, crowds rarely score
points during games. Still. . .)
During most of those games the
crowd has been larger than
McKale's capacity: the arena
holds 13,477, and last year the
Wildcats' average home atten
dance was 13,636.
Let's just say it's loud. It dis
rupts offenses, plays hell with
game plans and rattles the occa
sional player.
Like, say, a freshman who's
started all of two games in his col
lege career.
"It's definitely not just another
game," says forward Brent
Williams, who's spent most of the
season coming off the bench but
started the last two games for the
Cardinal. "I'll be a little nervous,
but nothing that's gonna keep me
from doing the things I usually do.
"I'm looking forward to playing
them. We've just got to go out
there and show everybody that we
can beat a team like Arizona. . . .
We're going to go out, we're going
to compete, and we're going to

take 'em."
For the Cardinal to do that,
however, it will have to overcome
much more than The Crowd and
The Streak: Stanford also has to
beat its own inability to do much
of anything this season on the
road, where the team is 2-6.

1 couldn't believe it.
At halftime I was just
thinking "Shoot, we
should be killing
these guys."'

The latest poor showing came
last Thursday at Arizona State,
when the Sun Devils disrupted
the Cardinal to the tune of 75-57.
"I don't know what happened,"
Williams says. "We should have
come out hungry and we should
have torn those guys apart. I
think they're the weakest team in
the Pac-10.
"I couldn't believe it. At half
time I was just thinking 'Shoot,
we should be killing these guys.'
. . I can't understand things like
that. We undersold ourselves by
not coming out hungry."
Williams had eight points in
that game, all of them in the first
half. For the season, he's averag
ing four points and 3.3 rebounds a
game — 8.3 and 5.8 in the team's
last six games, during which he's
become a starter.
The first start was against
UCLA two weeks ago, in front of a
sellout crowd at home. "I felt
pretty nervous," Williams says,
"but I just said 'Brent, don't get
too pumped up for the game,
because getting over-ready for the
game is going to make you mess

up. Just prepare.'
"I just went over the plays,
what I was supposed to do; I knew
exactly what my assignment was.
Just going over those things in my
mind helped to get rid of some of
the nervousness.
"When you're sitting there
waiting to go in, that makes you
kind of nervous," Williams says,
"but when you're in there and
everything just happens you don't
have time to think about being
nervous."
Apparently not, because
Williams scored a career-high 14
points and grabbed a career-high
nine rebounds before fouling out
in the Cardinal's 89-86 loss to the
Bruins.
And so, after the game against
the Bruins and another good
effort Thursday night at Arizona

State, Williams will make his
third start tonight. And the player
he will probably be guarding is
Chris Mills, the MVP of the pre
season NIT, won by Arizona. But
Williams isn't worried about start
ing opposite the man most people
expected to be the conference's
newcomer of the year.
"I'm excited," Williams says. "A
freshman getting as much playing
time as I am, there's no way I
can't be excited."
Stanford will need to be excited
— and then some — tonight.
Card notes
Stanford center Jim Morgan did
not make the trip to Arizona after
spraining his knee at practice. The
loss of the Cardinal's tallest player
just might be a problem against the
Wildcats trio of seven-footers.

Redshirt freshman Brent Williams had perhaps the best game of his
young career in his first collegiate start, against UCLA earlier this
month. He and his teammates will attempt to end Arizona's 61 -game
homecourt winning streak tonight.
