# Reality in the Pac-10
## 
### 
In case you've been tied up
with something a little
more important, there are
rumors galore running ram
pant throughout the Pac-10
these days, from talk about
the NCAA tourney to discus
sions on referees' intelligence
(or lack of same), it seems just
about everyone has something
to say.
Unfortunately, in a lot of
those talks folks are getting
duped by a few myths about
Pac-10 hoops, so (yet again) I
figured I might as well take my
stab at cutting through all the
ape manure floating around.
And so. . . .

Myth No. 1: Pac-10 offi
cials are more intelligent
than avocados. Does anyone
still believe this? If you do, it
must be because you haven't
seen any road games Stanford
has played this year.
Let's put it this way: Before
this season, Stanford's Mike
Montgomery had one technical
foul in the last three years. He
has three this season, and if he
gets one tonight at Arizona it'll
be the third game in a row that
a ref tells Montgomery to
watch his language.
By the way, official Ron
Richardson has whistled three
of those T's on Montgomery.
(Something personal? You
make the call.) Anyway, the
only explanations of the T-fest
are either (1) the officials
aren't taking as much crap as
they used to, or (2) the officials
are calling games like crap
more than they used to.
I'm partial to the second.
Last Thursday at Arizona
State — where Adam Keefe
was assaulted every time he
touched the ball but shot a
lousy five free throws — the
Pac-10 officials supervisor
didn't stop scribbling notes the
entire game. When Keefe got
thrown out of bounds by three
Sun Devils and was called for
traveling, the supervisor wrote
an entire book on the play.
By the way, the officiating
isn't any better at Maples:
When Stanford played Arizona
here last month, Keefe didn't
pick up a foul until there were
two minutes left in the game.
Come on.

Tonight, Stanford plays a
team that hasn't lost at home
since 1987. Anyone wanna bet
how many calls the Cardinal
will get?
Zero sounds about right.
Myth No. 2: Television
doesn't run college sports.
Right. Stanford is in Arizona
tonight for the first Tuesday
Pac-10 game in the last, oh, 15
years or so. Why? Well, the
game was supposed to happen
last Saturday, but the Wildcats
decided they really wanted to
play Duke at home instead. So,
since an Arizona-Duke game
means more money for ABC,
Arizona and Duke, the Cardi
nal got booted to Tuesday.
Of course, since the Stan
ford game at ASU was five days
ago, the Cardinal flew to
Tempe Wednesday, played the
Sun Devils Thursday, flew
home Friday, flew back to Tuc
son last night, plays the Wild
cats tonight and flies home at 7
a.m. tomorrow. Am I the only
one who thinks this is silly?
But hey: Silly and TV go
hand in hand. Thanks to the
fine folks at Raycom, at least
two Pac-10 teams play on Sun
day every week. That's not so
bad, except that it means teams
play games Thursday-Sunday
instead of Thursday-Saturday.
When Stanford visited
Washington three weeks ago,
the Cardinal played WSU on
Thursday, traveled to Seattle
on Friday . . . and did abso
lutely nothing on Saturday,
because Raycom wanted to
show the Stanford-Washington
game on Sunday. Now, if the
Pac-10 really wanted its ath
letes to go to class or study (I
know, I'm naive), you'd think
they wouldn't let them waste
almost two days lying around
in a hotel, right?
Hey! I've got it! If Raycom
really needs that Sunday game,
why not just make the four
teams involved (Washington,
WSU, Cal and Stanford, for
example) play Friday and Sun
day? Oh, wait: That would
mean the visiting teams would
travel one day later than usual,
which means they'd miss one
fewer day of classes.
We clearly can't have that.
Myth No. 3: The Pac-10 is
sending five teams to the
NCAA tourney. Some idiot —
I'm pretty sure it was me —
said this a few weeks ago. Oops.
Right now it looks like three
teams are going: Arizona for
sure because they're going to
win the conference title; UCLA
because they're UCLA and
they played well at the start of
