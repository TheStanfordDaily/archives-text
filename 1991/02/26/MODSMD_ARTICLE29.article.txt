# Sitting out without standing still

Lea Loveless has a nifty red-and-white Stanford
women's swimming warm-up suit. She goes to prac
tice with the team every day (twice on some days).
And she is there at meets, cheering for her team
mates.
The thing is, they almost never get the chance to
cheer for her.
After a great freshman season at Florida last year,
Loveless saw her coach quit and decided to leave. She
transfered to Stanford and is redshirting this season,
in accordance with NCAA regulations, and will swim
for the team next year.
"Deciding to go to school was probably the hard
est decision of my life and I had to go through it
twice," she says. But despite the problems inherent
to transfering and despite not being able to swim for
the Cardinal, things are still going just fine for Love
less.
As a highly-sought recruit in the backstroke com
ing out of high school, she narrowed her choices to
Florida, Stanford and California before finally decid
ing to go to Gainesville. "I think it was principally
that I really liked Randy Reese, who was the coach
there," she says. "Throughout high school I always
worked hard and decided to find the best coach with
out sacrificing academics. Everybody thought it was
the worst decision I ever made in my life, but I didn't
think so."
The decision actually turned out to be pretty
good, at least in the short run. Loveless gained a lot

After an outstanding freshman season at Florida, Lea Loveless saw her coach quit and
she decided to transfer to Stanford. So while she practices with the Cardinal every
day, she isn't allowed to get in the pool and compete with the nation's top-ranked
squad.
of confidence at Florida and
capped her freshman season by
placing an impressive second in
both the 100- and 200-yard back
strokes at the NCAA champi
onships.
"I wasn't ever the top recruit,"
she says. "Beth Barr, who was on
the Olympic team, and Anne
Mahoney (now a teammate at
Stanford) were the top backstro
kers. . . . Randy was the one who
probably believed in me the most
and that's what I needed because
I hadn't broken through yet."
The structure at Florida that
year was also different. The year
before Loveless went there, the
Gators spent all season ranked
No. 1 before falling to Stanford at
the NCAA championships. But
when Loveless was a freshman,
graduation losses removed the
possibility of a national team title.
"It was a lot smaller and a lot
more focused on individual ideas,"
she says. "We weren't really aim
ing toward winning NCAAs like
Stanford is. ... I think it helped
me that year. Your level of expec
tation is broadened. It opened a
lot of possibilities I never really
thought about."
Another eye-opener was her
swim in the 200 backstroke at the
NCAA meet, where Loveless went
out very fast and led most of the
way before teammate Kristen
Linehan passed her. "I was on
world record pace at the 150," she
says."I would never in a million
years think I would be out that
fast or could be out that fast."
But after the season, Reese
quit. According to Loveless, he
was too tired of dealing with the
administration that has become
prevalent in collegiate swimming
and wanted a chance to just deal
with swimmers. So with class
mate and friend Whitney
Hedgepeth also planning on leav
ing — she is sitting out this year
after transferring to Texas —
Loveless didn't want to hang
around either.

'Deciding to go to
school was proba
bly the hardest
decision of my life
and I had to go
through it twice.'

"That was hard," Loveless
says. "That was one of the only
things that would have kept me at
Florida. She and I were a great
team. ... It was hard because I'm
a loyal persons . . but the martyr
idea just wasn't going to work.
"Probably the first thing I said
was that I should have gone to
Stanford in the first place."
But Loveless is truly glad she
took such a circuitous route to the
Farm. "I think I appreciate it
more than if I went here fresh
man year," she says. "You come
out of high school to college and
you think it's great but then I
came here and say, 'I thought that
was great?'
"I think the people are a lot
more friendly. I think the educa
tion is better — Florida concen
trated more on ideas and facts and
here is more on theory and univer
sal ideas, more on thinking. ... I
like the integration of athletes
and students here. I had like three
friends who weren't athletes (at
Florida)."
But things aren't always easy.
"There are certain meets that are*
harder than others (to miss)," she
says. "Texas was brutal and
NCAAs — it'll be really tough sit
ting here. . . . But the team has
been great. They've included me
as much as they can."
Loveless has also gotten the
chance to compete occasionally
this year. She swam as a part of a
U.S. all-star team against Texas
two weeks ago and beat Barr and
All-American Jodi Wilson to win
both the 100 and 200 backstrokes.
Her times would rank her as the

Cardinal's best in both events if
she were eligible.
But she isn't, and she can only
wait for U.S. Long Course Nation
als in five weeks. That meet will
select three teams to represent
the country in international com
petitions over the summer and
thinking about that has helped
Loveless when she watches the
Stanford team compete.
That doesn't mean she isn't
waiting for the day when she can
put a Stanford cap on and get
back in the pool, though. "College
swimming is probably the best
aspect of swimming — team com
petition," she says. "Sitting out a
year makes you appreciate it
more, makes you want to take
advantage of every opportunity
you have."
