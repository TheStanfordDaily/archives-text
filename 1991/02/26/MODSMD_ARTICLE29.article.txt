Lea Loveless has a nifty red-and-white Stanford
women's swimming warm-up suit. She goes to prac
tice with the team every day (twice on some days).
And she is there at meets, cheering for her team
mates.
The thing is, they almost never get the chance to
cheer for her.
After a great freshman season at Florida last year,
Loveless saw her coach quit and decided to leave. She
transfered to Stanford and is redshirting this season,
in accordance with NCAA regulations, and will swim
for the team next year.
"Deciding to go to school was probably the hard
est decision of my life and I had to go through it
twice," she says. But despite the problems inherent
to transfering and despite not being able to swim for
the Cardinal, things are still going just fine for Love
less.
As a highly-sought recruit in the backstroke com
ing out of high school, she narrowed her choices to
Florida, Stanford and California before finally decid
ing to go to Gainesville. "I think it was principally
that I really liked Randy Reese, who was the coach
there," she says. "Throughout high school I always
worked hard and decided to find the best coach with
out sacrificing academics. Everybody thought it was
the worst decision I ever made in my life, but I didn't
think so."
The decision actually turned out to be pretty
good, at least in the short run. Loveless gained a lot

she decided to transfer to Stanford. So while she practices with the Cardinal every
day, she isn't allowed to get in the pool and compete with the nation's top-ranked
squad.
