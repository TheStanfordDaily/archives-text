# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
Roles of athletes have become more and
more specific throughout the world of sports
as coaches try to have their players do fewer
things at higher levels. Thus it should not
come as a surprise that this week The Daily's
Athletes of the Week are Val Whiting of the
basketball team and Aaron Dorlarque of
the baseball team, two people who have
earned a reputation as stars off the bench.
Whiting, a 6-foot-3 sophomore from

Wilmington, Del., helped the Cardinal close
out the regular-season home schedule with a
pair of total blowouts. Thursday night Whit
ing was actually in the starting lineup, and
boy did she respond.
She had 25 points, 15 rebounds and six
steals, all game-highs, and added two assists
for good measure. Stanford belew the game
open early and coasted to a 109-61 victory
over Arizona State.
Saturday night Whiting had 18 points and
13 boards as the Cardinal hammered Ari
zona 116-79. The Cardinal is now 21-4 over
all, 14-1 in the Pac-10.

Dorlarque, a 6-3 junior right-hander from
Vancouver, Wash., is one of a half dozen Car
dinal baseball players who deserved the
award this week. Stanford, ranked No. 1 in
one preseason poll, met Arizona State,
ranked No. 1 in the other preseason poll, for
a three-game set at Sunken Diamond that
opened Six-Pac play.
Stanford opened the set by thumping the
Sun Devils 9-1, then came back from a 4-2
deficit to win going away, 10-5, Saturday.
But ideas of a Cardinal sweep went out
the window when Stanford got behind 8-1
early in Sunday's contest. Then coach Mark
Marquess turned to Dorlarque, who was
leading the Six-Pac with a 0.79 earned run
average.
Dorlarque gave up one hit in seven
innings of relief, setting the table for a six

run seventh by the Cardinal. Steve Solomon
put the Cardinal ahead 9-8 with a grand
slam, Dorlarque set down the side in order
twice more, and the brooms were back in
business.
Dorlarque has now gone 27 consecutive
innings without allowing a run and has
dropped his ERA to an even more phenome
nal level.
