# Two views of Nicaraguan plight
## Panels review nation's progress under Chamorro 
### Rani Deshpande 
Exactly one year after Violeta Chamorro was
elected president of Nicaragua, two panels examined
the country's progress yesterday in a discussion
called "Nicaragua: Whither the Revolution?"
Assoc. Political Science Prof. Terry Karl, director
of the Center for Latin American Studies, moderated
the first panel, which discussed "The New Govern
ment: Chamorro's First Year."
"We have two very different visions here," she
said. "One is quite pessimistic, talking of parallel
governments and another civil war. The other
(approach) thinks that [Chamorro's party] can put
together a past torn by internal and external con
flict."
Cesar Aviles, the Nicaraguan consul general in
Los Angeles, gave an optimistic view on Chamorro's
first year in office, speaking from the viewpoint of
her coalition party, the National Opposition Union.
"We are poor but hopeful," he said. "Peace has
been our greatest achievement." The relative peace
after the nine-year war between the Sandinistas and
the Contras was brought about through the
Chamorro government's politics of national reconcil
iation, he said.
The second discussion traced the history of the
Sandinista revolution and offered a prognosis for
Nicaragua's future now that the revolutionary gov
ernment is out of power.
"Nicaragua is our backyard, emphasize the 'our,'"

said Thomas Walker, director of Latin American
Studies at Ohio University. The United States' main
goal since the Carter administration has been to
retain, reimpose or reinforce its hegemony, he added.
"The U.S. 'micromanaged' [Ms. Chamorro's]
campaign so that she would win," he asserted. Ihe
elections went the way we wanted them so there was
no need to denounce them as unfair," he said. " The
[Sandinista] revolution is dead," he added.
Magda Enriquez, a representative of the Sandin
ista party, countered this view.
"I don't think it's dead," she said. "The
Nicaraguan people had no choice. They voted with a
hope for change — for the better, not for the worse. "
She later asked, "Would the war have stopped —
would the [U.S.] embargo have stopped — if we had
won the election?"
Stanford Political Science Prof. Richard Fagen
agreed, calling the current government a "golden
egg" which was supposed to have brought foreign aid
and investment in its wake. He characterized Amer
ican foreign policy towards Nicaragua as highly
paradoxical, considering its sudden disappearance
from the U.S. agenda after a decade in the spotlight.
"I personally find it extremely difficult to design a
plan for Nicaraguan reconstruction," he concluded,
"given the profound contradictions, the profound
needs of the economy and the fact that the social
contradictions that gave rise to the revolution —
although they have been addressed — have not been
resolved by the revolution."
