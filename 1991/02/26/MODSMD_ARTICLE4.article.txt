# A 						lead actor in cost drama to retire post
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
John Ford, the head of a special Navy team
charged with resolving Stanford's indirect cost con
troversy, will retire Thursday â€” leaving many of the
thorniest issues in the dispute behind on the negoti
ating table.
The announcement, made quietly over the week
end, came as a surprise to both Stanford officials and
Ford's colleagues in the Navy and adds yet another
wrinkle to the ongoing controversy over how much
Stanford should be charging the government for
indirect costs of research.
Ford's negotiating posture has been strongly crit
icized lately, with some federal officials charging he
has been too easy on Stanford. But the criticism had
nothing to do with his decision to retire, according to
Norman Hanson, a Navy public affairs official. "It's
just happenstance," Hanson said.
Ford has accepted an "executive- and policy-level
position" with a major defense contractor, according
to a statement released by the Navy.
"He had the opportunity for a good job," Hanson
said, adding that Ford has been eligible for retire
ment for three years.
Ford was unavailable for comment yesterday
In December, the chief of naval research, Adm.
William Miller, appointed a five
person team led by Ford to
address many of the concerns
Navy regulator Paul Biddle had
raised about Stanford. Biddle con
tends that past "coziness"
between Navy and Stanford offi
cials allowed the University to
recover $200 million in indirect
costs during the last decade that
it was not entitled to.
A report released earlier this
month by the Inspector General
of the Office of Naval Research
largely discredited Biddle's claim,
saying he used "questionable
logic" and "very subjective judg
ment" to calculate his overpay
ment estimate. In addition to
heading the Navy's negotiating
team at Stanford, Ford was also a
member of the Inspector Gen
eral's fact-finding team.
Since the arrival of the negoti
ating team, Stanford's indirect
cost rate has been knocked down
twice, costing the University $5
million in expected revenue this
year. But during the past few
weeks Ford has come under heavy
fire for the way he has been han
dling the negotiations.
In a recent interview with The
Daily, Biddle attacked Ford for
being too concerned about Stan
ford's welfare. "I think John Ford
tries to be so fair that he ends up
being cozy," said Biddle, who is
also a member of the Navy negoti
ating team.
In addition, two federal agen
cies serving in an advisory capac
ity have recommended that Ford
immediately terminate dozens of

accounting agreements with
Stanford. Many of these agree
ments, called memoranda of
understanding, allow Stanford to
recover more in indirect costs
than would otherwise be possible
under federal rules.
The equity of the agreements
is one of the major issues cur
rently being negotiated between
Stanford and the Navy. In Decem
ber, the two parties signed an
agreement saying all memoranda
of understanding would remain
operative until at least April 1,
when the review is scheduled to
be completed.
Hanson, the Navy public
affairs official, predicted that
Ford's retirement would not
impede ongoing negotiations. A
replacement for Ford should be
named in two or three days, he
said.
In the statement released by
the Navy, Miller, the chief of naval
research, praised Ford's contribu
tions to the Navy negotiating
team. "John Ford has provided
commendable leadership," Miller
said. "John will be greatly missed
. . . but the course that he has
established for resolution of busi
ness issues at Stanford will con
tinue without change."
According to the statement,
Ford expressed regret that he
could not delay his retirement to
complete the work of the special
team. "His retirement had been
in the planning stage for some
time," the statement says.
Stanford officials called Ford
"an effective leader" in a state
ment released yesterday and said
the University "looks forward to
working with Mr. Ford's replace
ment to complete the resolution
of outstanding issues."
