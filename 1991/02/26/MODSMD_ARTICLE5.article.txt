# Few leads found in Medical Center bank robbery
## 
### Dan Stearns Staff writer 
Palo Alto Police are following
up on Friday's robbery of the
Medical Center branch of the
Stanford Federal Credit Union,
but their investigation has yielded
few leads or suspects in the case.
Credit Union President Warren
Marshall yesterday said the origi
nal police estimate — that the
robbers stole $50,000 to 60,000 —
was inaccurate, but he declined to

say how much was taken.
"If I told how much was stolen
it would be like saying 'this is how
much we have, come and steal it,'"
he said.
"It was more than petty cash,"
Zook said.
Although police arrested two
suspects Friday for questioning —
one after he was involved in a car
accident in East Palo Alto — both
were released Friday afternoon,
police said yesterday
Police Detective Brad Zook said

he still has "a couple of leads" in
the case, including footage he said
is being developed from a security
camera in the bank office.
Although Medical Center security
director Michael Stultz said Fri
day that there were only fake cam
eras in the bank, he said he later
learned that one of the cameras
was actually real.
The robbery, which occurred at
about 11:45 a.m., was allegedly
staged by three males wearing ski
masks. One robber was armed

with a "silver, long-barreled" gun,
said the sole customer in the bank
at the time.
The robbers allegedly entered
and escaped the credit union office
from a rear stairwell which con
nects the hospital basement to a
parking lot adjacent to Quarry
Road. Police speculate the robbers
had two getaway cars stationed on
Campus Drive.
The credit union lies around
the corner from the Medical Cen
ter's security offices. The center is

completing a four-year process of
installing new security devices
throughout the complex, but the
credit union has not been con
nected to this system.
Stultz and Marshall said that
because of the robbery they expect
to include the credit union within
the Medical Center's security sys
tem soon. Stultz said there had
never before been an armed rob
bery at the credit union.
The credit union remained
closed yesterday because its alarm
system was being tested.
Three employees and one cus

tomer were in the bank at the
time of the robbery. The customer,
a Stanford Hospital worker who
wished to remain anonymous,
yesterday said the armed robber
held his gun "one foot away" from
an employee's head.
She fled the credit union when
all three of the robbers were

behind the counter plundering the
cash drawers and the safe.
The customer said she couldn't
give a good description of the sus
pects because she was "afraid to
look in their faces."
"The robbery probably lasted
about four minutes," she said,
"but it seemed like an eternity."
