# Balancing act on the Row Fraternity RAs juggle their allegiances
## 
### John Louie Staff writer 
Members of housed fraternities have
specific sets of allegiances and responsibili
ties to their chapters. Resident assistants'
loyalties are also pretty clear — they are
hired, trained and supervised by the Office
of Residential Education.
Hut for the 10 RAs of Stanford's housed
fraternities, balancing these two alle
giances can present dilemmas from time to
time.
"Sometimes, the RA ends up being a
flak-catcher to protect an individual" in the
fraternity, said senior Scott Palmbush, RA
in the Delta Tau Delta fraternity. "The RA
gets squeezed in a bad spot. You have to fol
low what the University wants, but you
don't want to alienate the people in the
house because you live with them."
Evan Nadler, an RAin the Phi Delta
Theta fraternity, said RAs in fraternities
are torn between both roles. "There are
some times where I have to make a tough
judgment whether to handle things our

selves or to let someone else come and han
dle it," said Nadler, a senior. "I have to sort
out where 1 stand as well as what should be
done."
Fraternity RAs' responsibilities are not
different from those of other RAs in other
Row houses, said acting Director of the
Row Jack Chin. "My main goal is that each
Row house can be a place where learning
can occur in formal and informal ways. I
think that the fraternities have done a
really good job at just that."
Still, the differences between the two RA
jobs are pronounced. All RAs have to play a
variety of roles, including academic adviser,
program planner, party organizer and Uni
versity liaison. One of a non-fraternity RA's
biggest responsibilities, however, is just
being there as a friend for social, psycholog
ical or personal advice.
Fraternity RAs say counseling students
in their houses has not been a big part of
the job. "I've had to do very little counsel
ing or referral," said Sigma Alpha Epsilon
