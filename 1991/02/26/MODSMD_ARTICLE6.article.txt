# Balancing act on the Row Fraternity RAs juggle their allegiances
## 
### John Louie Staff writer 
Members of housed fraternities have
specific sets of allegiances and responsibili
ties to their chapters. Resident assistants'
loyalties are also pretty clear — they are
hired, trained and supervised by the Office
of Residential Education.
Hut for the 10 RAs of Stanford's housed
fraternities, balancing these two alle
giances can present dilemmas from time to
time.
"Sometimes, the RA ends up being a
flak-catcher to protect an individual" in the
fraternity, said senior Scott Palmbush, RA
in the Delta Tau Delta fraternity. "The RA
gets squeezed in a bad spot. You have to fol
low what the University wants, but you
don't want to alienate the people in the
house because you live with them."
Evan Nadler, an RAin the Phi Delta
Theta fraternity, said RAs in fraternities
are torn between both roles. "There are
some times where I have to make a tough
judgment whether to handle things our

selves or to let someone else come and han
dle it," said Nadler, a senior. "I have to sort
out where 1 stand as well as what should be
done."
Fraternity RAs' responsibilities are not
different from those of other RAs in other
Row houses, said acting Director of the
Row Jack Chin. "My main goal is that each
Row house can be a place where learning
can occur in formal and informal ways. I
think that the fraternities have done a
really good job at just that."
Still, the differences between the two RA
jobs are pronounced. All RAs have to play a
variety of roles, including academic adviser,
program planner, party organizer and Uni
versity liaison. One of a non-fraternity RA's
biggest responsibilities, however, is just
being there as a friend for social, psycholog
ical or personal advice.
Fraternity RAs say counseling students
in their houses has not been a big part of
the job. "I've had to do very little counsel
ing or referral," said Sigma Alpha Epsilon

Scott Palmbush, a member of the Theta Delta Chi fraternity, is the resident assistant at
Delta Tau Delta. He is the only fraternity member who serves as an RA for another fra
ternity.
RA Joe Reilly, a senior. "The peo
ple in my house don't require me
for counseling any more than
[they do] a non-RA."
Senior Phil Delio, the RA for
the Sigma Chi fraternity, said his
responsibilities as an RA fall into
two categories. "I'm a liaison
between the University and resi
dents who live here, and I'm in
charge of programming some
things in the house," he said.
"I try to open up attitudes and
opinions and expose some of the
people in the house to the diver
sity on campus, both academically
and socially," he added.
Delio said discussions within
the house are sometimes "better
than a [dormitory] discussion.
The guys in the house know each
other so well that they're uninhib
ited in expressing their views," he
said. "All of us are such good
friends that discussions are
always really open."
Although Delio is considered as
a member of the Sigma Chi house
government, his RA position is
not an official one according to the
fraternity's national organiza
tion. "But officers value my opin
ion highly as an RA," Delio said.
"I'm called upon as an officer in
executive meetings, and whenever
decisions are made, my input is
valued."
Reilly cited SAE's strong house
government as a primary reason
why his responsibilities are
reduced. "The house government
is so powerful that it takes care of
many of the duties of non-frater
nity RAs, like community service
and arranging house events,"
Reilly said. As an RA, Reilly holds
one of six seats on SAE's Execu
tive Board.
"I wanted to get involved in
house government and serve my
house," he said. "Because I was
head academic assistant for Alon
dra my junior year, I was used to
dealing with the University. But
this year has been relatively cri
sis-free."

Chin said fraternity RAs are
chosen "just like any other RA.
The director of the row selects 35
RAs, so the interview is actually
pretty quick because there's usu
ally 80 to 100 applicants. This
necessitates having such brief
interviews."
Row RA applicants are then
asked to visit several row houses
of their preference. "We get feed
back from the houses them
selves," Chin said. "Between the
interviews and the house impres
sions, it's a good matrix of infor
mation to make the selection."

'I try to open up
attitudes and opin
ions and expose
some of the people
in the house to the
diversity on cam
pus, both academi
cally and socially.'

"From my perspective, I will be
choosing the person who is the
best candidate for that particular
community," Chin said. "Each
fraternity has its own character,
history and personality, so RAs
aren't necessarily interchange
able, though the general objective
might be the same."
If there is no RA applicant for
the fraternity house, row RA
applicants who have requested
upperclass houses are chosen.
"It's highly unusual, though,"
Chin said. "There's usually some
one from each fraternity who
applies. There's never a situation
where we plop someone in out of
the blue." Out of the 10 housed
fraternities on campus, nine have
RAs who are fraternity members.
Palmbush, the Delt house RA,
is member of the Theta Delta Chi
fraternity and currently the only
RA for a fraternity in which he is

not a member. "I had lived in the
Theta Delt house for three years,
and was actually looking to be an
RA anywhere on the row when I
was applying," he said. "Another
reason was that most of my close
friends in my pledge class were
graduating, and I was looking for
a single."
Palmbush said his unique sta
tus has not posed a problem for
either himself or the Delt house
members. "At first, they were
wondering why a Delt didn't get
the job, but no Delts applied,"
Palmbush sai(L
"But it's not that hard. I'm a
football player, which matches me
to this house well since the house
is very sports-oriented. I feel like I
have a really good relationship
with most people . . . although it is
definitely a weird situation if you
look at it on paper," he said.
Senior James Dinette, a Delt
member, said Palmbush's athletic
background suits him well for the
house. "Being an athlete helps
[Palmbush] relate to such similar
lifestyles," Dinette said. "Scott
fits right in."
RA training sessions before the
school year involve both frater
nity RAs and other row RAs. "At
first, row RAs do treat us differ
ently," Reilly said. "We all had
some preconceived stereotypes
about fraternity and non-frater
nity RAs, but after a week of talk
ing we all found out we have a
whole lot more in common."
Chin said this year's fraternity
RAs have done "a wonderful job of
excellent programming." As an
example, Chin cited a gender rela
tions program involving members
of the Kappa Sigma fraternity and
residents from Roth house, an all
female residence. "Some of the
programs are really creative,"
Chin said.
Additionally, the experience is
rewarding for the fraternity RAs
themselves. "I personally feel like
I've matured from the opportuni
ties I've been exposed to as a RA,"
Delio said.
"That's the learning that we in
Residential Education want to see
— the learning that supplements
the classroom," Chin said.

fraternities, balancing these two alle
giances can present dilemmas from time to
time.
"Sometimes, the RA ends up being a
flak-catcher to protect an individual" in the
fraternity, said senior Scott Palmbush, RA
in the Delta Tau Delta fraternity. "The RA
gets squeezed in a bad spot. You have to fol
low what the University wants, but you
don't want to alienate the people in the
house because you live with them."
Evan Nadler, an RAin the Phi Delta
Theta fraternity, said RAs in fraternities
are torn between both roles. "There are
some times where I have to make a tough
judgment whether to handle things our

selves or to let someone else come and han
dle it," said Nadler, a senior. "I have to sort
out where 1 stand as well as what should be
done."
Fraternity RAs' responsibilities are not
different from those of other RAs in other
Row houses, said acting Director of the
Row Jack Chin. "My main goal is that each
Row house can be a place where learning
can occur in formal and informal ways. I
think that the fraternities have done a
really good job at just that."
Still, the differences between the two RA
jobs are pronounced. All RAs have to play a
variety of roles, including academic adviser,
program planner, party organizer and Uni
versity liaison. One of a non-fraternity RA's
biggest responsibilities, however, is just
being there as a friend for social, psycholog
ical or personal advice.

Scott Palmbush, a member of the Theta Delta Chi fraternity, is the resident assistant at
Delta Tau Delta. He is the only fraternity member who serves as an RA for another fra
ternity.
RA Joe Reilly, a senior. "The peo
ple in my house don't require me
for counseling any more than
[they do] a non-RA."
Senior Phil Delio, the RA for
the Sigma Chi fraternity, said his
responsibilities as an RA fall into
two categories. "I'm a liaison
between the University and resi
dents who live here, and I'm in
charge of programming some
things in the house," he said.
"I try to open up attitudes and
opinions and expose some of the
people in the house to the diver
sity on campus, both academically
and socially," he added.
Delio said discussions within
the house are sometimes "better
than a [dormitory] discussion.
The guys in the house know each
other so well that they're uninhib
ited in expressing their views," he
said. "All of us are such good
friends that discussions are
always really open."
Although Delio is considered as
a member of the Sigma Chi house
government, his RA position is
not an official one according to the
fraternity's national organiza
tion. "But officers value my opin
ion highly as an RA," Delio said.
"I'm called upon as an officer in
executive meetings, and whenever
decisions are made, my input is
valued."
Reilly cited SAE's strong house
government as a primary reason
why his responsibilities are
reduced. "The house government
is so powerful that it takes care of
many of the duties of non-frater
nity RAs, like community service
and arranging house events,"
Reilly said. As an RA, Reilly holds
one of six seats on SAE's Execu
tive Board.
"I wanted to get involved in
house government and serve my
house," he said. "Because I was
head academic assistant for Alon
dra my junior year, I was used to
dealing with the University. But
this year has been relatively cri
sis-free."

Chin said fraternity RAs are
chosen "just like any other RA.
The director of the row selects 35
RAs, so the interview is actually
pretty quick because there's usu
ally 80 to 100 applicants. This
necessitates having such brief
interviews."
Row RA applicants are then
asked to visit several row houses
of their preference. "We get feed
back from the houses them
selves," Chin said. "Between the
interviews and the house impres
sions, it's a good matrix of infor
mation to make the selection."

'I try to open up
attitudes and opin
ions and expose
some of the people
in the house to the
diversity on cam
pus, both academi
cally and socially.'

"From my perspective, I will be
choosing the person who is the
best candidate for that particular
community," Chin said. "Each
fraternity has its own character,
history and personality, so RAs
aren't necessarily interchange
able, though the general objective
might be the same."
If there is no RA applicant for
the fraternity house, row RA
applicants who have requested
upperclass houses are chosen.
"It's highly unusual, though,"
Chin said. "There's usually some
one from each fraternity who
applies. There's never a situation
where we plop someone in out of
the blue." Out of the 10 housed
fraternities on campus, nine have
RAs who are fraternity members.
Palmbush, the Delt house RA,
is member of the Theta Delta Chi
fraternity and currently the only
RA for a fraternity in which he is

not a member. "I had lived in the
Theta Delt house for three years,
and was actually looking to be an
RA anywhere on the row when I
was applying," he said. "Another
reason was that most of my close
friends in my pledge class were
graduating, and I was looking for
a single."
Palmbush said his unique sta
tus has not posed a problem for
either himself or the Delt house
members. "At first, they were
wondering why a Delt didn't get
the job, but no Delts applied,"
Palmbush sai(L
"But it's not that hard. I'm a
football player, which matches me
to this house well since the house
is very sports-oriented. I feel like I
have a really good relationship
with most people . . . although it is
definitely a weird situation if you
look at it on paper," he said.
Senior James Dinette, a Delt
member, said Palmbush's athletic
background suits him well for the
house. "Being an athlete helps
[Palmbush] relate to such similar
lifestyles," Dinette said. "Scott
fits right in."
RA training sessions before the
school year involve both frater
nity RAs and other row RAs. "At
first, row RAs do treat us differ
ently," Reilly said. "We all had
some preconceived stereotypes
about fraternity and non-frater
nity RAs, but after a week of talk
ing we all found out we have a
whole lot more in common."
Chin said this year's fraternity
RAs have done "a wonderful job of
excellent programming." As an
example, Chin cited a gender rela
tions program involving members
of the Kappa Sigma fraternity and
residents from Roth house, an all
female residence. "Some of the
programs are really creative,"
Chin said.
Additionally, the experience is
rewarding for the fraternity RAs
themselves. "I personally feel like
I've matured from the opportuni
ties I've been exposed to as a RA,"
Delio said.
"That's the learning that we in
Residential Education want to see
— the learning that supplements
the classroom," Chin said.
Members of housed fraternities have
specific sets of allegiances and responsibili
ties to their chapters. Resident assistants'
loyalties are also pretty clear — they are
hired, trained and supervised by the Office
of Residential Education.
