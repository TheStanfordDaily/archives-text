# Guide faces special challenge
## She leads campus tours — and is partially blind 
### Anita Presser Staff writer 
As a tour guide, it's Janette
Sampson's job to show visitors the
sights of campus, even though she
has trouble seeing them herself.
Although she cannot see
straight ahead, Sampson, who
describes herself as one of the few
partially blind students at Stan
ford, does have some peripheral
vision.
"I'm what is affectionately
known as a 'partial' because I'm
not totally blind," said Sampson, a
junior.
Sampson, who has been leading
tour groups on campus for the
University's Guide and Visitors
Service since last year, said she
always informs visitors about her
vision before the tour begins.
"Usually people are cool about it. I
ask them to tell me if there is
something moving" behind me,
she added.
Walking backward around cam

pus is difficult for any tour guide,
and her vision problem sometimes
forces her to rely on others to
warn her about obstacles in her
way, she said. But some visitors go
even farther than that.
"One time, this person, this
man, was very worried about me
and instead of telling me to watch
out, he would grab me and pull
when something was behind me,"
she said.
Sampson said one of her most
memorable tours was with a
group of elderly people who were
also visually disabled. Her favorite
time to give tours is during winter
quarter because the groups are
small and"I don't have to walk
backwards — I can just chat," she
added.
"Sometimes people get stressed
out about people with disabilities
because [we are] different. It's
nice when people can get beyond
that," she said. To help surmount
some of the differences, she sug
gests that students attend the

Disability Resource Center speak
ers' bureau programs and try to
get to know disabled people.
Sampson also offered advice for
other students with disabilities.
"Don't be afraid to ask for what
you need, because you are right to
need something and to get it," she
said.
"Most visually disabled people
take care of themselves," she
added.
She also said she feels it is
important not to classify people by
their disabilities. "The things that
make people different are impor
tant, but it is easy — too easy — to
become defined by that, and that's
odd," she said.
Before she came to Stanford,
Sampson never considered herself
a member of a larger disabled
community, she said. The groups
for disabled students on campus
have grown during the past few
years, she noted.
"My disability is a part of who I
am and is a good thing for me."

Janette Sampson has to cope with the campus tour guide's dilemma of walking backwards for long peri
ods of time. But that's not all she has to deal with: she's also partially blind.
