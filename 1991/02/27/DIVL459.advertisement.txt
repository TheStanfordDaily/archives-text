HAPPY 22nd BIRTHDAY
BIG BRO CATOOL
You're the sweetest and the smartest, and you're
better than M.C. Hammer because he can't do
Mexican dances. Thank you for celebrating my
birthday with me. I hope yours is just as great.
Continue to run half the school and do the 10,000
things you're doing now, in that very studly manner
of yours, and bust a revolution everyday.
Everyone please give this birthday boy a huge hug.
