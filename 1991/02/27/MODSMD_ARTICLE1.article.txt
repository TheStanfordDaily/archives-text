# IRAQIS FLEE KUWAIT; WAR RAGES ON
##

DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) —
Under allied fire, Iraq's beaten army
streamed north yesterday in a headlong
flight homeward, abandoning Kuwait
City to its day of liberation after a long,
dreadful, bloody night of occupation and
war.
Early today, an Iraqi military
spokesman said on Baghdad radio that
Iraq had completed its withdrawal from
Kuwait — as promised a day earlier by
Saddam Hussein.
However, the fight raged on. "We're
going to . . . attack and attack and
attack," a U.S. general vowed as Marines
tangled with Iraqis fighting a rear-guard
action at Kuwait City airport, and as a

vast U.S.-British armored force collided
with Iraq's vaunted Republican Guard
somewhere to the northwest.
In fierce battles, allied forces had
knocked out 26 Iraqi army divisions —
roughly 260,000 men by early today, U.S.
military officials in Riyadh said.
The officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that American reconnais
sance teams and other "lead elements" of
U.S. forces were in Kuwait City, but the
U.S. command did not regard the city as
liberated.
"I'm sure we'll run into some pockets
of resistance, but we fully expect it to
belong to coalition forces at the end of
today," one official said. He said some

Iraqis probably remained in Kuwait City.
In one battle, tank crews of the U.S.
VII Corps battered a Guard division in
the Iraqi desert west of Kuwait, a senior
Pentagon official said. A news-pool
report, meanwhile, said Guard units were
setting up new defensive lines west of the
southern Iraqi city of Basra.
The campaign appeared to be coming
down to a deadly race through the desert
between Iraqi troops retreating north
toward Iraq's heartland and the VII

Corps armor rumbling in from the west to
cut them off. The Iraqis reportedly had
Kuwaiti hostages in tow.
No one in authority was saying how
deep into Iraq the allied forces might pur
sue the withdrawing army.
Saddam sought to label the withdrawal
a "victory." President Bush called it an
"outrage" and said Saddam was trying to
cling to formidable military power with
his pullback.
Hundreds of surrendering Iraqi sol
diers had another word for the debacle.
"Salaam! Salaam!" — "Peace! Peace!"
— they shouted as they raised their hands
to advancing troops. More than 32,000
Iraqis have now been taken prisoner, the

U.S. command said. In one instance,
crews from an Iraqi tank and armored
personnel carrier helped extricate a U.S.
Humvee utility vehicle from mud and
then surrendered, a U.S. officer said.
And among Kuwaitis, the word was
"freedom."
"Our joy is overflowing, thanks be to
God," their exile radio declared. "The
enemy is turning tail."
Flashing V-for-victory signs, jubilant
Kuwaitis emerged from their homes yes
terday to greet the first outsiders to ven
ture into their burned, looted city.
People ran up to hug and kiss tri-
