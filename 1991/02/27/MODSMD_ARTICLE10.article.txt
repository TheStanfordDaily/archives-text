# Blood drives canceled due to record donations

The Stanford Blood Bank had to can
cel eight blood drives this month because
of a continuing surplus of blood here and
at blood banks across the state.
Flooded by donors since the Persian
Gulf war started, many blood banks, like
Stanford's, are canceling blood drives,
and some are even turning away donors.
Blood banks say the measures are neces
sary because blood cannot be stored
indefinitely and they do not want to
waste it.
There have been 15 blood drives this
month at Stanford, compared with the
normal level of 23. Twenty-eight drives
were held last month, said Rhoda Burns,
an administrative assistant at the blood
bank. The number of donors has not
increased since the outbreak of the
ground war, she added.
"We don't want a lot of blood coming
in and then [have] the possibility of not
being able to use it," said Richard Moll, a
spokesperson for the Peninsula Memo
rial Blood Bank in Burlingame.
The shelf life of platelets, which aid
in the coagulation of blood, is as short as
five days, and red blood cells are only
good for 42 days, Moll said.
The Buriingame blood bank is
scheduling appointments with donors
instead of allowing them to come on a

drop-in basis, he added.
The outpouring of donations is
unprecedented, Burns said. She said she
has not seen such an interest in donating
blood among the general public since the
mid-19705.
Generally, one-third to one-half of the
donors at Stanford are students, giving a
total of about 3000 units of blood annu
ally, Burns said.
"Everyone is motivated by something
different. For some people it has been
the Persian Gulf war," she said.
The Stanford Blood Bank has not
contracted with the government to sup
ply troops with blood, Burns noted.
Blood Bank officials said they hope
the donors who must be turned away
now do not become discouraged, since
their contributions will be crucial during
peacetime, when interest is lower.
"We are riding a fine line since many
of the people are first-time blood donors
and we don't want to turn them away
from donating blood," Burns said.
A spokesperson at the Fresno-based
Central California Blood Bank, Leslie
Botos, said they have initiated a "Gulf
Crisis Plan." Because officials expected a
huge increase in the number of donors,
they limited the total number of dona
tions there to just above the daily need of
200 units, she explained.
