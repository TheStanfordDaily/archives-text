A 63-year-old visiting scholar from Nor
way at the School of Education was injured
in a bicycle accident in the Quad yesterday
afternoon and had to be taken to the hospi
tal.
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer
said Asmund Stromnes was entering the
Main Quad from Memorial Court on a bicy
cle when he was struck by another cyclist.
Stromnes, suffering from contusions,
was taken to Stanford Hospital, where he
was listed in stable condition and was held
overnight, a hospital spokesperson said last
night.
"Apparently they collided and he's
banged up," one hospital worker said.
The spokesperson said Stromnes
requested that no further information on
his condition be released.
Niemeyer said the other cyclist, 18-year

old freshman Hon Joseph, suffered "facial
abrasions and pain around IhisJ shoulder
and arm area."
Although the police are "investigating
and documenting" the case, there "doesn't
appear to be gross negligence" on Joseph's
part because the pillars in the Quad blocked
his line of sight, Niemeyer said.
Joseph said he was "riding pretty fast"
through the Quad and couldn't see
Stromnes "until a second before we hit." He
added that he thinks Stromnes didn't see
him until they collided near the pillars.
After the accident, several bystanders
came to the assistance of the older man,
including a lifeguard and a student trained
in advanced first aid.
Joseph, who was treated at Cowell Stu
dent Health Center, said that although wit
nesses assured him he was not at fault, he
"still felt pretty bad about the whole situa
tion."
