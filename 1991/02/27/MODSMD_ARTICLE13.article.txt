demand release of white extremist
PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) - Pro
apartheid demonstrators marched in Pretoria
yesterday to demand the release of an impris
oned white extremist who was in the 23rd day
of a hunger strike.

Afrikaner Resistance Movement, warned of
widespread unrest if Piet Rudolph died.
He also demanded that President EW. de
Klerk grant amnesty to all right-wingers in
detention.

Order of the Boers. He is in prison in Pretoria
in connection with an arms theft from a South
African air force base last year.
U.N.: Iran violates human rights
GENEVA (AP) - A U.N. human rights
report said Tuesday that more than 500 people
are believed to have been executed in Iran over
the past 12 months and that torture and other
ill-treatment of prisoners appear to be continu
ing.
Most executions involved people charged
with drug trafficking, but others included
those convicted of political offenses, the report
said.
The study quoted a letter from the Iranian
government dated Jan. 22 as denying allega
tions of torture as "totally baseless," but
observing that amputations are permitted
under Islamic law for certain crimes.
