# Gorbachev blasts Yeltsin, reformers

MOSCOW (AP) — President Mikhail Gorbachev
yesterday lashed back at Boris Yeltsin and other rad
icals who are demanding his resignation, saying they
were trying to oust him through street demonstra
tions, "and they might succeed."
Warning that would lead to civil war, Gorbachev
distanced himself from the forces of radical reform
and aligned himself closer to Communist Party tra
ditionalists in a major speech setting the tone before
a national referendum March 17 to hold the Soviet
Union together.
The anti-Communist opposition has staged three
huge rallies in Moscow since the Kremlin's Jan. 13
military crackdown in Lithuania, with increasing
calls for Gorbachev's resignation as he has turned
toward hard-liners.
Yeltsin, his political rival and president of the
Russian federation, went on national television Feb.
12, accused Gorbachev of sacrificing perestroika for
personal power and demanded his immediate resig
nation.
The speech by Gorbachev, to Byelorussian intel
lectuals in Minsk during his first domestic trip in a
half-year, was also his first public comment about
Yeltsin's demand.
"The democrats are striving for power," Gor
bachev said, referring to Yeltsin and other reform
ers. "And since their initial plan for a lightning cap
ture of power by legal means through the Congress
and Supreme Soviet did not work, they decided to
use what some analysts define today as neo-Bolshe
vist tactics.
"You know what I mean. It's the transition of the
struggle to the streets: organizing demonstrations,
rallies, strikes and hunger strikes," Gorbachev said.
Gorbachev said his political opponents were wag
ing "psychological warfare" against him.
"In the absence of positive programs, they
address the people — the working class — over the
heads of the parliament, with an appeal to dissolve
this and that, and force the president to resign, and
the situation is tense, strained," he said. "And they
might succeed. And that's what they calculate on."
In an apparent reference to demands at recent
demonstrations for the national parliament to
resign, he accused his opponents of trying to dis
mantle the Soviet Union's "first democratically
elected organ."
In fact, the 2,250-member Congress has hun
dreds of deputies selected by party-controlled orga
nizations. In addition, its members have given Gor
bachev increased powers in recent months so that he
rules virtually by decree.
