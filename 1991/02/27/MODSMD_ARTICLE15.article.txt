# Mild recession predicted
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - An over
whelming majority of the nation's top
economic forecasters share the Bush
administration's expectation that the
current recession will be shorter and
much less severe than the average down
turn since World War 11.
The National Association of Business
Economists survey showed yesterday
that 49 of the 54 forecasters participat
ing in the poll, or 91 percent, believe the
recession will last nine months or less —
meaning it should be over by mid-year.
Both their length and severity projec
tions were just a bit less rosy than the
White House's.
The eight previous recessions since
1945 have averaged 11 months in length
during which the economy fell an aver
age of 2.5 percent. The consensus of the
NABE forecasters project the drop in the
GNP this time to be just 1.0 percent. The
poll was conducted in the first two weeks
of February.
"Compared to historic norms, that is
a fairly short recession," Richard Rippe,
NABE president and chief economist for
Dean Witter Reynolds in New York, told
a news conference. "In terms of severity,
the recession is expected to be fairly

shallow compared to historic norms."
A recession generally is defined as at
least two consecutive quarterly declines
in the gross national product — the
nation's total output of goods and ser
vices. The Commerce Department said
the GNP fell at an annual rate of 2.1 per
cent in the fourth quarter of 1990.
President Bush based his fiscal 1991
budget on assumptions that the reces
sion would be mild and last just two
quarters, with economic growth resum
ing in the April-June period. The NABE
forecasters were slightly less optimistic,
projecting a tiny contraction in that
quarter but moderate growth thereafter.
The Commerce Department also
revealed yesterday that the U.S. mer
chandise trade deficit narrowed to
$108.68 billion in 1990, the smallest gap
in seven years and down 5.4 percent
from the imbalance posted in 1989. Both
exports and imports set records,
although the import growth was slower
than exports.
The NABE forecast projected an
unemployment rate of 6.6 percent this
year, dropping to 6.2 percent in 1992.
The jobless rate was 5.5 percent in 1990.
