# Victory in drug war forseen

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President Bush
and Colombian President Cesar Gaviria
expressed confidence after a White House
meeting Tuesday that their two countries
eventually will triumph in the war against
illicit drugs.
With Gaviria at his side after more than
two hours of talks, Bush said, "We are
determined to defeat this enemy. I am more
and more convinced that we will win this
war."
Gaviria said, "You can be sure that this
scourge of humanity will end some day with
the kind of effort we have been doing."
U.S. officials said Gaviria was invited as
a gesture of appreciation for what they

regard as an impressive record in con
fronting the drug kingpins since he took
office eight months ago.
An official who briefed reporters, asking
not to be identified, said Colombian author
ities have seized 11.5 tons of cocaine this
year, double the figure for the comparable
period a year ago and four times the
amount of two years ago.
Gaviria generated some controversy
recently when he agreed not to extradite
drug traffickers who turn themselves in to
Colombian authorities. The move has gen
erated concern that some traffickers might,
be able to evade punishment through bribes
and threats.
