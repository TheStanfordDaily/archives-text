Stanford should take a
stand on discrimination
by extending benefits

The university should
heed the suggestion made by
the ASSU Senate and extend
married benefits to gay and lesbian
faculty and staff couples.
The idea of giving benefits to
partners of gay and lesbian faculty
and staff is an attempt to make
right the wrongs of societal dis
crimination against homosexuality.
Since gays and lesbians are forbid
den from marrying, it is currently
impossible for them to enjoy the
same benefits as married couples.
Stanford has no control over
local and state laws concerning
marriage, but it can take a stand
against exclusionary marriage laws
that discriminate against gays and
lesbians by passing this policy.
Stanford has already recognized
the discrimination against gays
and lesbians through its domestic
partners policy, which, athough
never explicitly specified as apply
ing only to gay and lesbian couples,
was clearly intended for them.
Now, the University must be
consistent in its opposition to dis
crimination against gays and les
bians by applying the same stan
dards to faculty and staff.
There is, certainly, a difference
between letting gays and lesbians
live together and extending mar
ried benefits to them. The differ
ence is that a new policy on faculty
and staff could conceivably cost the
University a great deal of money.
Nevertheless, this should not be
an excuse for the University to
renege on its responsibility to pro
vide an environment free from dis
crimination.
The cost of the new policy must
not be the overriding concern. The

University has a written policy
against discrimination, and
nowhere in that policy does it say it
can be overridden in favor of eco
nomic considerations.
At the same time, cost is a legit
imate reason for not extending
these benefits to heterosexual cou
ples who choose not to marry.
In the process of alleviating the
effects of societal discrimination,
Stanford must not overcompensate
by opening up the benefits to all
unmarried faculty and staff
because the money is simply not
available.
Unfortunately, there is an incon
sistency in allowing unmarried
heterosexual couples to have hous
ing and student benefits but refus
ing the same to faculty and staff.
The problem is that the funds
are not available to do so, and the
University should have as its first
priority in this case the fighting of
discrimination against gays and
lesbians.
Stanford must also safeguard
this policy from potential abuse. It
is possible that couples who have
not made marriage-like commit
ments would apply for the added
benefits.
In anticipation of such abuse,
the University must establish cri
teria for the couples to meet in
order to apply for the benefits, as
well as a list of the possible sanc
tions for fraud, up to and including
the loss of one's job.
The University should, however,
institute the policy on a case-by
case basis and avoid excessively
strict requirements that would be
demeaning and humiliating to gays
and lesbians.
Due to the cost of such a policy,
it is unlikely to be passed by Presi
dent Kennedy or the Board of
Trustees any time soon. But stu
dents, staff and faculty should
keep the pressure on them until
they help to right the wrongs of
societal discrimination.
