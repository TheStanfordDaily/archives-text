# Commissioner says senate vote unfair
## New vote to confirm hearings officer expected next meeting 
### Miranda Doyle Staff writer 
ASSU Elections Commissioner
Raul Lopez accused senators ear
lier this week of acting unfairly
last Thursday when they almost
voted to reject Doreen Musson as
hearings officer.
In his letter dated Feb. 24. to
all ASSU senators and the senate
chair, Lopez defends Musson, a
graduate student, and her contro
versial ruling on election cam
paigning. He said in an interview
yesterday that if she is not con
firmed, he will "not feel responsi
ble" for finding another person for
the position.
The controversy began when
Lopez announced at last Thurs
day's senate meeting Musson's
ruling that student publications
should not print the names of can
didates for this spring'Â® elections
before campaigning officially
begins April 10. If names are pub
lished, Musson said she would
investigate the source of the
announcement and candidates
may be disqualified.
At the senate meeting, a straw
poll showed that 17 senators and
senate associates disagreed with
the ruling. Three senators agreed
and seven senators abstained.
Lopez said he is disappointed
with the attempt to reject Mus
son. "I think that it is very prema
ture and unfair to judge her
future performance without hav
ing had an intelligent and open

discussion with her," he wrote in
the letter.
Musson's election rulings are
not official because she has not
been confirmed by the senate.
Wrapping up a four and one
half hour meeting last Thursday,
the remaining senators voted 5-2,
with two abstentions, not to con
firm Musson. Because 11 senators
are needed for a quorum, the vote
did not count.
Musson will appear briefly at a
special senate meeting tomorrow
night to answer questions, Lopez
said. He said he wrote the letter
because he "would not want
Doreen to be harassed by the sen
ate."
Another vote on Musson's con
firmation will probably be taken
at the senate's next full meeting.
Musson said she is glad to see
so much discussion about the
issues she has raised. "I think I
interpreted [the Bylaws] correctly
and hope that through debate we
can come to an agreement."
She added she does not foresee
any problems with her confirma
tion. "I am sure Ithe senate] will
find me a reasonable person who
is very excited about this posi
tion."
Graduate senator Douglas
Bone, who voted against confirm
ing Musson, said he wanted to
send a message "that there was
dissatisfaction with the rulings"
although he does not necessarily
want Musson to be rejected as
hearings officer.
