## No crazier than you or I 
### 
WE ONLY STOPPED BECAUSE
we could go no farther. Lori's
Diner, as the neon sign out front
announced, held no particular attraction
for us. My friend Kevin and I were simply
tired after a day of walking around San
Francisco — Chinatown, North Beach,
the Embarcadero — and wanted to rest
our aching legs and get something to eat.
We went in and found ourselves trans
ported — or so Lori wanted us to believe.
The interior was decorated in a '50s
theme, with a long, central counter; a
jukebox in the corner; and fading, green
ish paintings of Elvis and cars with fins.
But the decor seemed less an authentic
recreation than a botched resurrection,
the dredging of the dead to no good end.
Too-bright light from bare bulbs over
head drew our eyes to seams in the paint
and cracks in the white plastic tables.
This might have been How It Was in the
50s, but it only seemed decrepit to us now.
Kevin and I sat down and looked
around. I found it strange that no one sat
at the counter; a single waitress stood
behind it at one end, talking to a man in a
thin black leather jacket.
There were two booths by the front
window; one was filled by a family —
Mom and Dad and a son and two daugh
ters — and the other was occupied by two
men and a woman, all about 20 years old,
drinking coffee, smoking and looking out
landish in designer clothing and gelled
hair.
Kevin and I were eating and talking
when another, somewhat different cus
tomer rattled through the door.
It wasn't hard to tell that something

about him just wasn't right. His eyes,
behind coke-bottle glasses, were round
and flaring. His arms flopped jerkily,
swathed in a gray windbreaker, and his
legs, though sturdy, showed the slightest
quiver.
It didn't take him long to approach the
family in front and ask Dad, loud enough
for the rest of us to hear, for 15 cents.
Dad looked away, said something to
Mom, and kept eating. The man didn't
like that too much; he leaned over the
table, thrust his face in Dad's, and
shouted, with all the volume his thin,
grainy voice could muster, that all he
wanted was 15 cents.
Dad stayed frozen, hoping the man
would go away, but the waitress couldn't
take that chance; a drooling, antagonistic
bum was bad for business, so she made
her stand: "Get out of here! Are you
" r>"
crazy?
The answer to that question was quite
clear to all of us.
The man careened on, to the "twenty
somethings" at the next table. His body
rocked slowly, forward and back, as he
made his request once more.
The waitress shouted again, and her
friend in the leather jacket decided to do
something more forceful: He grabbed the
man by the arm and started shepherding
him toward the door.
The man struggled, using the loose,
rambling energy of his body to his advan
tage, but finally had to give in, too weak
to keep up a fight. As he neared the door,
the waitress went to him, gave him 15
cents and told him never to come back.
By that time, however, the money

hardly mattered; the man looked at it,
shoved it in his pocket, and shook his
head. He was loud and rasping, but sur
prisingly still, as he gave his parting blow
from the doorway:
"Let me tell you something. Let me
just tell you something. You're ALL crazy.
>»
It was easy to laugh at that, and I did,
nervously, as all of us looked around at
each other, stunned. But the man was
right; we were all, in some undeniable
way, as crazy as he seemed to be, if not
more so.
Crazy, for trying to bring back the '50s
when the '90s were going on, sordid and
real, in the streets outside.
Crazy, for the conceit that we had
somehow, morally or socially or economi
cally, earned the right to sit inside this
run-down restaurant and be undisturbed
by those who had not.
Crazy, for making a man beg for 15
cents and then spurning him because his
social graces failed to meet our standards.
Crazy, for paying 15 cents to get him to
leave and thinking we had done more
than enough.
Crazy, for thinking we had done any
thing at all.

Ed Heinemann doesn't believe in what
ever it is we call this thing in italics below
his column.
