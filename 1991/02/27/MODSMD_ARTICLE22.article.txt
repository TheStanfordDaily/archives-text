## Shades of Alan Bloom: the closing of the Stanford mind 
### 
We can never be sure that the opinion we
are endeavoring to stifle is a false opin
ion, and if we were sure, stifling it would
be an evil still.
— John Stuart Mill
A DANGEROUS AIR OF censorship
pervades the Stanford community.
Ever since the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait and subsequent U.S. response, I
have sought opinions, arguments and
facts from all sides of the issue. Unfortu
nately, the overwhelming majority of
"open discussions," programs and speak
ers present only the anti-war side.
I find it very troubling that my dorm
can bring in five speakers on the war and
have every single one of them present an
anti-war viewpoint.
I find it very troubling that the very
first teach-in held fall quarter, sponsored
by the Office of Residential Education,
contained no speakers in favor of the U.S.

response.
I find it very troubling that Stanford
Students for Peace held a massive two
day teach-in and completely skewed the
teach-in so that only a small percentage
of programs presented the pro-United
States view.
Barring the panel discussions, which
were surprisingly balanced, there existed
only one program in support of the war.
Hoover Institution fellow Charles Hill
presented his view on why the U.S. policy
is right. Ironically, the teach-in organizers
told him to make his presentation
"short."
What I find the most troubling, how
ever, is the labeling of these skewed pro
grams. Theo Emery remarked in the Feb.
25 Daily, "The teach-in organized by Stu
dents for Peace presented an objective,
multi-faceted view of the war."
Donald Kennedy's quotation, which
called for a "fair," "balanced" and

"thoughtful" discussion on the war,
appeared at the top of the teach-in sched
ule, as well as in a huge Daily advertise
ment.
Please, do not insult the intelligence of
the Stanford community.
If you are an organizer of an event in
which you know the overwhelming
majority of speakers are going to be anti
war, then you should label it truthfully
for what it is. Better still, perhaps it
might occur to you to bring in opposing
viewpoints.
Otherwise, just like the U.S. and Iraqi
authorities, you are engaging in manipu
lation and propaganda.
Which is the lesser evil: presenting a
"fair" and "balanced" program which
degenerates into only one viewpoint, or
presenting no program at all?
A more fundamental issue, however, is
at stake. And that is the subtle stifling of

all opinions that are not politically cor
rect. In this instance, the fault lies on
both sides of the PC spectrum.
Organizers of events should be blamed
for not being more aggressive in bringing
in speakers with opposing viewpoints.
Likewise, knowledgeable people holding
non-politically correct views should be
blamed for failing to speak their minds
when asked.
I find it regrettable that some very
insightful Stanford professors and
Hoover fellows do not share their wisdom
simply because they fear heckling and
unpopularity.
I can only hope that people feel manip
ulated enough at Stanford to take action
not just against overt censorship, but
against self-censorship as well.
