# Valentine's Day Intermission smacked of heterosexism
## 
### 
My FRIEND JAY, who is bisexual,
saw the article in the Valentine's
Day issue of Intermission — the
one of people's accounts of their best and
worst dates.
He has a story to contribute.
Jay's lover is a man. One day, Jay and
his boyfriend were walking to the
movies, holding hands. Suddenly, two
men emerged from an alley behind them.
One kicked Jay's lover to the ground;
the other smashed Jay's nose with a
wrench and dragged him into the alley.
This man held Jay down while his
accomplice shoved a 12-inch stiletto up
Jay's ass.
They left him there.
Jay was hospitalized. He had to have
multiple stitches in his colon and on his
nose. He recovered.

To this day, Jay refuses to stop hold
ing his lover's hand in public. He gets
"queer-bashed" at least twice a year.
The Intermission story — indeed, the
entire issue — reeked of heterosexism.
By failing to mention the dating expe
riences — good or bad — of bisexual, gay
or lesbian people, it not only ignored our
very existence but also trivialized the
systematic opposition and massive vio
lence some of us face when we are in
same-sex relationships.
It is exactly this sort of omission that
directly contributes to an atmosphere
which prevents queer people from com
ing out.
Furthermore, it sends out a message
that queer people are the "other," that
there is this huge gap between the gen
eral readership of The Daily (the kind

who would read Valentine's Day articles)
and "those homosexuals" out there.
And so, queers seem to exist only dur
ing Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian Aware
ness Week in spring, when there is a spe
cialized article on "gay dating."
They exist only when surveys show
that lesbians and bisexual women "lack
community."
They exist only when there is talk of
alumni donations being cut because of
men kissing and domestic partners.
They exist only when community
forums are held to discuss domestic part
ners and the talk is all about (literally)
"exterminating the homosexuals."
To be fair, The Daily did cover Full
Moon on the Quad in a queer-positive
way. But on Valentine's Day, that bastion
of heterosexism, the queers vanished

from the paper.
Is it that the writer of the article did
not want to deal with same-sex dating
experiences because issues — like queer
bashing — that perhaps might have
come up would not have gone well with
the article's fuzzy-silly-smoochy tone, or
was the writer just not aware that cam
pus queers exist?
A systematic, across-the-board inclu
sion of queerness reveals the complexi
ties of the world as it is and necessitates
new ways of thinking about issues that
might seem mundane and taken for
granted.
This is what I expect of The Daily —
not an assumed heterosexual standard
for "mainstream" articles.
