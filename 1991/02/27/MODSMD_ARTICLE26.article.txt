## How scientists learn to love the bomb 
### Adrian Nam-Son Khactu 
To many American citizens, nuclear weapons
designers appear to be confronted with a
moral dilemma nearly impossible to resolve.
Torn between love of their science and knowl
edge of the awesome destructive potential of their cre
ations, researchers should be saddled with a mono
lithic guilt and a permanent confusion. Or so it seems.

However, nuclear scientists
have escaped these conflicts by
forming an independent culture
whose values support and affirm
their actions, reports Stanford
doctoral student Hugh Guster
son.
Gusterson, a Mac Arthur Fel
low currently studying at MIT,
observed scientists at Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory,
a major nuclear weapons design
facility in Livermore, California.
He describes the testing of a
nuclear weapon as "a cultural
process that's become saturated
with deeply felt meanings."
To an outsider, this process
initially seems like one aspect of
a mysterious, ritualistic society
with its own initiation practices,
secrecy and rites of passage.
Each new scientist must sub
mit to a Federal Bureau of
Investigation check, lasting six
months to two years; scientists
view approval as the initiation
required to become a member.
The scientists also view "a
nuclear weapons test as a rite of
passage," says Gusterson.
Very few outsiders see the
inner workings of a nuclear
weapons facility. Consequently,
security constraints are one fac
tor contributing to the transfor
mation of the laboratory into a
"secret society."
Though this society seems
strange and mysterious, Guster
son quickly acknowledges that
the weapons designers' culture
is not completely different from
the lives of those outside the lab.
"The only distinct and differ
ent aspects of this culture," says
Gusterson, "are its specific lan
guage, fetish with machines,
influence on social interaction
and unique ideology."
The language that these sci
entists use isolates their culture
from outsiders who find them

selves unable to understand its
constant stream of acronyms
and inventive vocabulary.
Acronyms are used to denote
any project, file or machine
name. "While I was there," says
Gusterson, "I had a hard time
keeping up with the conversa
tion." Because everything is
known by an acronym, rather
than by a descriptive name, the
artifacts of the weapons culture
can be described to outsiders
only with difficulty.
The scientists often use lan
guage that incorporates birth
metaphors when discussing a
weapons test, Gusterson adds.
A nuclear weapon that deto
nates early is "premature,"
while the feeling of a scientist
after detonation is called "post
partum depression."
Gusterson claims that the sci
entists' comparisons of weapons
test to birth processes "express
the scientists' conviction that
the weapons are about life and
about the fertility of the human
mind."
This connection between
nuclear scientists and machines
is further explored in what
Gusterson terms the scientists'
"fetish with machines." The
powerful machines used in
nuclear weapon design and test
ing tend to be the center of these
scientists' world, he explains.
Some scientists seem to
receive a sense of excitement,
power and energy from these
machines and describe them as
aesthetically beautiful.
"Some of the scientists talk
about being sad that a bomb is
going to be destroyed because
the technology in it is so intri
cate and beautiful," Gusterson
explained.
Because of this "fetish with
machines," nuclear scientists
often have weak human interac

tions, Gusterson claimed,
explaining that many of the sci
entists he interviewed dealt
more easily with machines than
with humans.
And this applies to scientist
scientist relations as well as that
between scientists and out
siders.
Relations between scientists
are often strained because of the
constant competition for re
sources that include computer
time and the raw materials from
which the weapons are made.
The sheer expense of
weapons research further
heightens competition: From
start to finish, a nuclear
weapons test can cost between
$10 and $70 million.
Often, the nuclear scientists
are split into two factions — the
Strategic Defense Initiative
(SDI) camp and the standard
nuclear weapons scientists. This
division adds to the competition
for governmental resources.
The competition for such
resources often depends on
external politics. During the
middle 1980s, the SDI group got

more funding than the nuclear
weapons camp.
Interaction with outsiders is
also weak, however, due to many
outsiders' preconceived — and
erroneous — notions about
nuclear weapons scientists.
Sympathetic to the anti-nuclear
movement during the early
1980s, Gusterson himself began
his study with stereotypes of
mad scientists and wondered,
"What kind of a person is a
nuclear weapon physicist?"
Before he began his study,
Gusterson invited a few nuclear
weapon protesters and a few
nuclear weapon scientists to his
house for dinner one night in
order to observe their interac
tion.
He found that the protesters
talked in "absolute morality


Graphic by Doug Davis — Daily
terms" and viewed theproblem of nuclear prolifera
tion in black or white. Tlie scientists talked of solving
the problem scientifically, and rationalized that the
products of their work make war impossible.
Gusterson also noticed that in his experience,
protesters tend to be middle to upper-middle class
college graduates, while the scientists are usually col
lege graduates from the lower to lower-middle class
families.
The interaction between scientists and protesters
indicates to Gusterson that there exist profound dif
ferences between the ways in which the two cultures
consider ideological issues.
"As the dinner party showed," says Gusterson,
"we need to redefine our definitions of politics,
nuclear stability and deterrence."
To the nuclear scientists, "liberal and conserva
tive politics have little or no bearing on nuclear pro
liferation issues."
Gusterson found actively liberal scientists who
support nuclear stability, and therefore support mak
ing weapons on the grounds that they maintain a
balance between the superpowers.
In sharp contrast, Gusterson also found a Chris
tian Fundamentalist conservative researcher who
feels mankind is inherently flawed and that the use
of nuclear weapons is inevitable.
Most frequently, Gusterson found that the liber
als and conservatives among the scientists agree that
the construction of nuclear weapons will prevent
war.
Weapons, in the minds of these nuclear scientists,
no longer create war; they stop it.
"Scientists believe that the more weapons they
make, the more the world will be afraid to use them,"
Gusterson says.
Almost all of the scientists interviewed were sure
that the United States and the Soviet Union would
not use nuclear weapons within their lifetimes.
"War becomes unthinkable because of the effects
of nuclear weapons on the world. Many scientists
believe, quite plausibly, that without the creation of
nuclear weapons, World War 111 would have hap
pened already," Gusterson explained.
However, some scientists see the construction of
nuclear weapons as more than just a contribution to
the anti-war movement. They perceive weapons
research as basic to their own way of life.
Scientists at Livermore did not oppose a U.S.-
Soviet treaty to limit the number of nuclear weapons
produced, Gusterson found. However, the majority
did oppose a comprehensive test ban treaty.
"There is a very real sense that the comprehensive
test ban treaty would destroy their culture in a way
that other arms control treaties would not," says
Gusterson. "And if you end nuclear testing, you end
a certain culture with it. You destroy the culture."
