# Nerve pulses prepare brain cells for vision

Nerve cells in the eyes of mam
malian infants send signals that
prepare the brain to process
stereoscopic vision, Stanford
researchers report.
Experiments performed on
newborn ferrets indicate that reti
nal nerve cells send coded electri
cal impulses to the part of the
developing brain tha* is first
involved in the processing of
visual information.
These impulses help the brain
distinguish between signals from
the left and right eyes, preparing
the young animal's optic "wiring"
for stereoscopic vision in later life.
Stanford Professor of Neurobi
ology Carla Shatz and postdoc
toral fellow Rachel Wong reported
the findings last week at an
annual meeting of the American
Association for the Advancement
of Science in Washington, DC.
When a ferret is born, the com
plex neural network that coordi
nates vision has not yet fully
developed. The axons of the reti
nal ganglion cells are connected to
brain cells in an almost random
fashion.
Axons are parts of nerve cells
that carry impulses away from the
cell body towards adjacent nerve
ceils.
In the absence of visual stimu
lation — ferrets are born blind,
with their eyes tightly shut — the
retinal ganglion cells send pre
cisely timed electrical signals to
the lateral geniculate nucleus, an
important part of the mammalian
midbrain that processes visual
information.
A developing lateral geniculate
nucleus (LGN) cell uses these
impulses to determine whether it
will be in contact with informa
tion from the left eye or the right
eye.
"Initially from development,
the inputs from the two eyes are
random throughout the struc
ture," Shatz says. "They move
some branches, they smooth out
and they form other branches.
Both in the formation of the con
nections in the LGN and in the
primary visual cortex there is a
remodeling that goes on."
Neural connections between
retina and brain develop until the
lateral geniculate nucleus is
divided into layers of cells that
process visual information from
specific eyes.
It is crucial that a given LGN
cell "know"the point of origin of
visual stimuli, as the cells of the

The brain must distin
guish between stimuli
from the left and right
eyes for normal
vision to take place.

LGN must be wired properly in
order for normal stereoscopic
vision to take place.
In collaboration with Denis
Baylor, also a professor of neuro
biology, and his fellow, Markus
Meister, Shatz found that the
developing retinal ganglion cells
send the timed signals during
short bursts of activity that occur
at relatively infrequent, regular
intervals.
These periods of intense neural
firing occur roughly once every
minute.
"This research answers a ques
tion that has been open for some
time in developmental biology:
What is the nature of the informa
tion that the visual system uses to
identify the signal coming from
the two eyes?" Meister explained.
The researchers' results "pro
vide for the first time some posi
tive evidence that this informa
tion might be contained in the
electrical activity of neurons," he
continued.
To measure the neural activity
in retinal tissue, researchers used
a device known as a multi
electrode array.
The array consists of 61 plat
inum patches arranged in a hexag
onal pattern roughly half a mil
limeter in diameter.
The retinas of postnatal ferrets
were surgically removed and kept
in contact with the array during
the course of the experiments.
Because retinas have thus far
only been studied one at a time,
outside the animals, researchers
have been unable to characterize
adequately the coordination of
signals between the left and right
eyes in intact visual systems.
This interaction remains an
important area of investigation irt"
the study of the development of
visual systems.
Further research may include
exploration of the mechanism by
which retinal cells generate and
synchronize their signals to the
LGN. Additionally, researchers
will attempt to determine whether
there are specialized cells within
the developing retina that are
responsible for the well-timed sig
nals.
