Q,How do desalination plants work ?
A .Like removing bad grades from a
• transcript, removing salt from water
takes lots of money and energy. However,
neither idea is very new. Aristotle described
an ancient evaporation method, and distil
lation of many liquids was known long
before Prohibition outlawed evaporation of
some of them. The first large seawater
desalination plant was built in 1949, in —
you guessed it — Kuwait.
Although distillation of seawater works
just fine, it requires enormous amounts of
energy. The first Kuwaiti plant was produc
ing over 20 million liters per day in the
19505. To simply boil that much water (at
2800 kJ/liter) would a continuous input of

more than a billion watts of power. Most
commercial plants rely on more energy-effi
cient methods, such as flash evaporation,
reverse osmosis or crystallization.
In flash evaporation, heated seawater
is sprayed in a low-pressure chamber,
where it evaporates at a much lower tem
perature than normal. The salts stay
behind and the vapor is then collected and
condensed into fresh water.
Reverse osmosis is like what happens
when a textbook is placed under your pillow
before a chemistry final, and all knowledge
is sucked out of your brain instead of put
into it. Reverse osmosis can also be used to
"filter out" the salts from seawater. The
process uses special membranes that are
impermeable to ions, but allow water to
pass through. Pressure would be required
to push the water through the membrane
in the reverse direction.
Crystallization takes advantage of the
fact that under certain conditions, salt

water can be frozen to produce salt-free
crystals of ice with the salts trapped
between these crystals. The ice crystals are
separated from the mixture and then
melted to make fresh water.
Many commercial plants rely on a combi
nation of processes for maximum efficiency.
. 1 've read that "napalm " may be used
vy • by the coalition forces during the cur
rent conflict in the Middle East. I know it's
nasty stuff, but just how nasty is it?
A. Napalm is a co-precipitated alu
• minum soap made from naphthenic
acids and the fatty acids of coconut oil. It
was developed in 1942 by researchers at
Harvard University in collaboration with
the U.S. Army.
Napalm is used as a thickening agent in
the preparation of gasoline gels for incendi
ary munitions. The name is derived from
the naphthenic and palmitic acids which

are its mtyor constituents.
Napalm is essentially jellied gasoline.
The substance, renamed "Incendergel" by
the military in the Vietnam War, is used to
fill bomb casings or as a fuel in flamethrow
ers.
The substance burns with intense heat
and sticks to anything it touches, some
times causing terrible casualties. One of its
chief values to field commanders is its abil
ity to deplete the air of oxygen. A wave of
napalm-fueled fire splashed across a system
of trenches may fail to burn the occupants,
but can remove so much oxygen from the
air that the trench-bound troops suffocate.
For this reason, opponents of napalm
have argued that it should be classified as a
chemical weapon and banned. Nonethe
less, napalm remains a mainstay of armies
and air forces throughout the world, and
has been used in many wars and minor con
flicts since it was introduced in World War
11.
