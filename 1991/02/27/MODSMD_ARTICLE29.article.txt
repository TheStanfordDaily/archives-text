# Day treatment provides options for mentally ill
##

The room could easily be mistaken
for an elementary school classroom.
Windows cover one whole wall,
filling the room with California sun
shine. Basketballs and volleyballs are
piled up in the corner, and two jigsaw
puzzles await completion on tables
near the walls. There are shelves
filled with novels and issues of
National Geographic, and board
games are stacked high in a wooden
cabinet. One can, without too much
difficulty, see 20 screaming children
in here.
However, this room was not
designed for children.
On weekdays, the chairs arranged
in the middle of the room seat men
tally ill adults — patients in the
North County Mental Health Cen
ter's day treatment program.
Located on Grant Avenue in Palo
Alto, the center provides counseling
services for the mentally ill. In addi
tion to day treatment, the center also
offers outpatient services and pro
grams for children and adolescents.
About 10 patients currently par
ticipate in day treatment at the cen
ter. The program is designed to help
county residents who have suffered a
mental or emotional breakdown that
has drastically affected their lives.
In the past, patients have ranged
from Stanford Ph.D.s to McDonald's
cashiers.
Most of the patients in day treat
ment suffer from serious mental ail
ments such as major depression,
schizophrenia and manic depression,
according to Jim Evans, head of the
program and a licensed social worker.
By gathering the participants
together with social workers each
weekday for four or five hours, "the
program provides things they might

not otherwise have in the commu
nity," Evans says.
Day treatment attempts to give
the patients a sense of structure and
routine — a feeling sorely needed by
people who are often prone to psy
chotic symptoms such as hallucina
tions, paranoid delusions and illogical
thinking.
"The structure of the program
itself gives them something to focus
on, rather than allowing them to
focus on unreal thoughts," he
explains.
Each day proceeds under a strict
schedule, with time allotted for activ
ities such as group therapy, craft pro
jects and organized socialization. Vir
tually everything is done as a group:
discussing problems, setting goals —
even eating lunch.
The counselors hope that the
{>atients can apply to their everyday
ives the order and socialization skills
that they learn by participating in the
program.
"Greater self-esteem, a reduced
sense of isolation and the opportu
nity for emotional release" are
among the benefits of programs such
as this, according to the California
Department of Mental Health.
"The purpose is to restore previ
ous functioning," Evans says. "If
somebody was working before, then
our goal would be to get him back to
work. If somebody's highest level of
function was to be able to socialize in
a board-and-care home, then our goal
would be to return him to that."
Many of the patients are referred
to the program from within the
county's mental health care system.
However, Evans says, community
doctors and therapists also refer
patients whom they think would ben
efit from group treatment.
After individuals are referred,
members of the day treatment staff

meet with them to talk about their
problems and "assess the potential
helpfulness of day treatment," Evans
says.
While Evans acts as the on-site
head of the program, day treatment
— like all of the services provided by
North County — is administrated by
the Santa Clara County Department
of Mental Health.
Evans calls the relationship
between the county and the clinic
" federalists."
While the county defines the tar
get population for care and orders the
formation of programs like day treat
ment, the individual clinics have both
the responsibility and flexibility to
set up the services and develop rea
sonable treatment plans.

Like the individual states, local
clinics supervised and funded by the
county are able to respond to the
needs of the communities "in a flexi
ble way rather than be dictated to,"
Evans says.
The day treatment staff meets
each morning to discuss the patients
and their progress. Naturally, Evans
points out, disagreements over treat
ment methods sometimes arise.
"It's not a pure science," he says,
"and there are people with different
theoretical perspectives. People don't
always agree."
However, Evans adds, in the end
the staff always reaches some level of
agreement. Like the patients work
ing to deal with their problems, "they
approach things as a team."

The day treatment room of Palo Alto's North County Mental Health Center
might look like an elementary school classroom. However, no classes are
held here — the day treatment program provides a therapeutic option for
mentally ill adults.
