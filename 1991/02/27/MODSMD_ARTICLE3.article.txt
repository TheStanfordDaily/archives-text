# Activists concerned about Soviets
## 
### Amy Gillett Staff writer 
Last month, when Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev
sent Soviet troops to fire on civil
ians demonstrating in Lithua
nia, senior Maija Lutsep orga
nized Stanford students to
participate in a demonstration
in San Francisco protesting the
crackdown.
Although she cannot be in the
Baltic republics to support the
independence movements
directly, Lutsep, whose parents
are from Estonia, said she will
do all she can at Stanford to
change U.S. policy regarding the
Baltic republics.
Lutsep is one of several Stan
ford community members with
ties to the Soviet Union who say
that to prevent further crack
downs and counter gains by con
servative forces, people outside
the Soviet Union must work to
keep the reform movements
alive.
Senior Rachel Oliker is work
ing to create direct contact
between Americans and Soviet
Jews. And visiting Sociology
Prof. Victor Zaslavsky, who
teaches a class on the disintegra
tion of the Soviet Union, is orga
nizir g international conferences
to advance the views of liberal
Soviet scholars.
Lutsep, who has a large black,
blue and white striped Estonian
flag hanging on the wall in her
Soto dormitory room, grew up
speaking Estonian. She said that
although she has always been a
proponent of Baltic indepen
dence, she never felt the immedi
acy of the situation before she

traveled to the Soviet Union last
summer.
When she returned to Stan
ford last fall, she founded the
Stanford Baltic Alliance, hoping
she could "catalyze the Baltic
independence process" even
though she was far removed
from the scene.
"If changes don't come about
soon, people will forget about
Estonian culture and there will
be nothing motivating the fight
for an independent Estonia,"
Lutsep said. The Soviets have
attempted during the last 50
years to erase Estonian customs
and traditions, she added.
Like Lutsep, Stanford senior
Rachel Oliker was motivated to
aid Soviet citizens after a trip to
the Soviet Union.
As a member of the Stanford
Soviet Exchange Project, she
spent three weeks in Novisi
birsk, Siberia and set eyes on her
birthplace for the first time since
she emigrated at age three.
Oliker said she had been con
cerned with the plight of Jews in
the Soviet Union for years but
had never imagined their situa
tion was so dire. Many of the
Jews she met in Novisibirsk
were living in fear of being
assaulted by anti-Semitic gangs,
sfye added.
"One young Jewish man I
met had double doors installed
in his apartment to protect
against pogroms," she said. "He
feared for the life of his family."
Oliker said she saw an article
entitled "Jews not Wanted Here
— Get Out!" in a Siberian news
paper.
In her travels throughout the
Russian Republic, Oliker met

many Jews. All of them wanted
to emigrate, she said.
Oliker cited rising Russian
nationalism and the deteriorat
ing economic situation as the
main reasons for the resurgence

of anti-Semitism.
"Traditionally, when the soci
ety has sought an outlet through
which to vent their frustrations,

month's Soviet crackdown in Lithuania.
they have targeted the Jews as
their scapegoats," she said.
Oliker predicts that as the eco
nomic situation worsens, vio
lence against Jews will escalate.
After her return to Stanford in
late September, Oliker said she

took her position as chair of the
Hillel World Jewry Committee at
Stanford more seriously. She
realized her organization could
affect the lives of Soviet Jews.
"Even a letter to comfort and
support [Soviet Jews] can make a
big difference in their lives," she
said.
Oliker said Jews in remote
places such as Siberia are totally
isolated from Jewish culture and

have no little access to religious
materials. They treasure any
thing written in Hebrew and
treat a box of matzo for Passover
as manna from the heavens, she
added.
Zaslavsky, who emigrated
from Leningrad, said because
there is a new trend toward con
servatism in Soviet politics, aca
demic ties with Soviet intellectu
als are now even more vital than

in the past.
In May, he will meet reform
minded Soviet scholars in Italy at
a conference he is organizing on
different Soviet nationalities and
moving toward a free market sys
tem.
Zaslavsky said the scholars
represent the class of liberals
that have recently been dis
missed from the increasingly con
servative Gorbachev govern

ment.
Zaslavsky said that although
many of these liberals no longer
have government posts, they will
not stop playing a key role in
Soviet politics.
The Gorbachev years should
now come to a conclusion, even
though Gorbachev "deserves a
place in history," he said. "Gor
bachev has outlived his useful
ness."

By cracking down on the
Baltics, Gorbachev has proven
that his first priority is the
preservation of the Soviet Union
at all costs and that he has
shelved his plans for a market
economy, Zaslavsky said.
Lutsep, Oliker and Zaslavsky
all say that their ties to the Soviet
Union will be even more impor
tant as the plights of Estonians,
Jews and liberal scholars worsen.
