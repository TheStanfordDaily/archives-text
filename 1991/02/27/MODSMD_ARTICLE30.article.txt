## Wildcats embarrass Stanford 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
TUCSON, Ariz. — And you thought
Iraq was getting its ass kicked.
Maybe — just maybe — if Hell had
frozen over yesterday, the Stanford
men's baketball team would have had a
chance to stop the Arizona Wildcats' 61-
game home winning streak.

Men's Basketball

Wildcats 89
Cardinal 51

Hell didn't freeze.
The Cardinal did.
Stanford was cold from the floor, cold
from the line and not much better any
where else last night, as the Wildcats
shellacked the Cardinal 89-51 in a game
that was over way before halftime. The
complete and total thrashing, which was
the Cardinal's worst loss since 1982 (an
81-38 disaster against Oregon State),
drops Stanford into a tie for eighth in
the Pacific 10 Conference at 7-9, 14-12
overall.
"I think Arizona wanted to win this
game more than we did," said center
Adam Keefe, who had 20 points — but
only four of them in the first half, when
the game was semi-close. "We're not
going to beat anyone if that's the case."
They're also not going to beat anyone
when they shoot a sickening 20-for-69
(.290) from the field, as they did last
night. They're also not going to beat
anyone if they shoot 9-for-18 (do the
math yourself) from the line, as they did
last night.
They're also not going to beat anyone
if they turn the ball over 21 times, get
crushed on the boards (Arizona had 15
more rebounds than Stanford before the
eternal Garbage Time) and play lousy
defense.
"We just played soft," said John
Patrick. "We played scared. There were
no exceptions: No individual played
well."
They weren't much better collec
tively, either. Stanford's offense was so
far out of sync it might take a week for
it to hitch back — aside from Keefe,

Brent Williams (13 points) and Peter
Dukes (five), the other eight Cardinal
players scored 13 total points. On
defense, Stanford did manage to hold
power forward/power tool Brian
Williams to two points (12 below his
average) but let Chris Mills score 22,
Khalid Reeves 19, and every other Ari
zona player at least three.

"I don't think there's a whole lot to
say," said Arizona coach Lute Olson,
whose team is 23-5, 11-3 and virtual
champs of the Pac-10. "It's so obvious to
me seeing them before and now how
much they miss (Andrew) Vlahov."
Vlahov scored 19 in last month's 78-
76 loss to Arizona at Maples Pavilion,
but having him at McKale Center last
night wouldn't have made much of a dif
ference. Having center Jim Morgan —
who sprained his right knee in practice
Monday and didn't even make the trip
— wouldn't have made much of a differ
ence either.
"In order for us to win here, we
would have had to play a perfect game,"
Stanford coach Mike Montgomery said.
Vlahov and Morgan would not have
made this a perfect game. Heck, Magic
Johnson couldn't have helped Stanford
play a perfect game.
What's scary is that the Wildcats
didn't play very well either. Three Ari
zona starters combined for a measly
eight points. The team as a whole had
16 turnovers and shot 12-for-31 in the
first half (29-for-59 overall). And they
still waltzed.
In fact, midway through the first half
the score was Chris Mills, 11, Stanford,
9, and the rest of the Wildcats, zero. Nei
ther team could do much of anything —

the Cardinal missed nine of its first 12
shots, the Wildcats six of their first 10
and both teams were in the bonus with
eight minutes left in the half — and that
was probably just fine with Stanford,
which opened the game in a 2-3 zone to
avoid matchup problems inside.
After a short jumper off a fast break
by Brent Williams made it 11-9, how
ever, Stanford turned the ball over three
of its next four times down the floor and
found itself down 24-12. That was with
seven minutes left in the half. A Keefe
layup cut the gap to 10 — and the Car
dinal wouldn't get that close again.
Center Ed Stokes scored six of his 11
points in the next seven minutes to help
the 'Cats open up a 38-22 lead at the
half, and that was basically that. Just to
make sure the Cardinal got the point,
however, Arizona scored 18 of the sec
ond half's first 20 points — Stanford
missed seven of its first eight shots in
the half — to make it 56-24, thank you
and good night. Montgomery pulled
seniors Patrick, Kenny Ammann and
Deshon Wingate with 17:12 left in the
game and none of them ever made it
back.
The 18-2 run was punctuated by a
beautiful Matt Muehlebach-to-Mills lob
for a slam on an out-of-bounds play, and
the game was completely, totally,
emphatically over. The lead got up to 42
at one point — all the Wildcat starters
were pulled with 11 minutes left and the
score 62-28, and the reserves outscored
the Cardinal the rest of the way.
Call it an ass-kicking; call it devasta
tion; call it a joke — and, once again, call
it a road loss.

going on either end of the floor and ended up falling to the Wildcats 89-51.
TUCSON, Ariz. — And you thought
Iraq was getting its ass kicked.
Maybe — just maybe — if Hell had
frozen over yesterday, the Stanford
men's baketball team would have had a
chance to stop the Arizona Wildcats' 61-
game home winning streak.

Men's Basketball

Wildcats 89
Cardinal 51

Hell didn't freeze.
The Cardinal did.
Stanford was cold from the floor, cold
from the line and not much better any
where else last night, as the Wildcats
shellacked the Cardinal 89-51 in a game
that was over way before halftime. The
complete and total thrashing, which was
the Cardinal's worst loss since 1982 (an
81-38 disaster against Oregon State),
drops Stanford into a tie for eighth in
the Pacific 10 Conference at 7-9, 14-12
overall.
"I think Arizona wanted to win this
game more than we did," said center
Adam Keefe, who had 20 points — but
only four of them in the first half, when
the game was semi-close. "We're not
going to beat anyone if that's the case."
They're also not going to beat anyone
when they shoot a sickening 20-for-69
(.290) from the field, as they did last
night. They're also not going to beat
anyone if they shoot 9-for-18 (do the
math yourself) from the line, as they did
last night.
They're also not going to beat anyone
if they turn the ball over 21 times, get
crushed on the boards (Arizona had 15
more rebounds than Stanford before the
eternal Garbage Time) and play lousy
defense.
"We just played soft," said John
Patrick. "We played scared. There were
no exceptions: No individual played
well."
They weren't much better collec
tively, either. Stanford's offense was so
far out of sync it might take a week for
it to hitch back — aside from Keefe,

Brent Williams (13 points) and Peter
Dukes (five), the other eight Cardinal
players scored 13 total points. On
defense, Stanford did manage to hold
power forward/power tool Brian
Williams to two points (12 below his
average) but let Chris Mills score 22,
Khalid Reeves 19, and every other Ari
zona player at least three.

'I think Arizona wanted
to win this game more
than we did. We're not
going to beat anyone
if that's the case.'
— Adam Keefe

"I don't think there's a whole lot to
say," said Arizona coach Lute Olson,
whose team is 23-5, 11-3 and virtual
champs of the Pac-10. "It's so obvious to
me seeing them before and now how
much they miss (Andrew) Vlahov."
Vlahov scored 19 in last month's 78-
76 loss to Arizona at Maples Pavilion,
but having him at McKale Center last
night wouldn't have made much of a dif
ference. Having center Jim Morgan —
who sprained his right knee in practice
Monday and didn't even make the trip
— wouldn't have made much of a differ
ence either.
"In order for us to win here, we
would have had to play a perfect game,"
Stanford coach Mike Montgomery said.
Vlahov and Morgan would not have
made this a perfect game. Heck, Magic
Johnson couldn't have helped Stanford
play a perfect game.
What's scary is that the Wildcats
didn't play very well either. Three Ari
zona starters combined for a measly
eight points. The team as a whole had
16 turnovers and shot 12-for-31 in the
first half (29-for-59 overall). And they
still waltzed.
In fact, midway through the first half
the score was Chris Mills, 11, Stanford,
9, and the rest of the Wildcats, zero. Nei
ther team could do much of anything —

the Cardinal missed nine of its first 12
shots, the Wildcats six of their first 10
and both teams were in the bonus with
eight minutes left in the half — and that
was probably just fine with Stanford,
which opened the game in a 2-3 zone to
avoid matchup problems inside.
After a short jumper off a fast break
by Brent Williams made it 11-9, how
ever, Stanford turned the ball over three
of its next four times down the floor and
found itself down 24-12. That was with
seven minutes left in the half. A Keefe
layup cut the gap to 10 — and the Car
dinal wouldn't get that close again.
Center Ed Stokes scored six of his 11
points in the next seven minutes to help
the 'Cats open up a 38-22 lead at the
half, and that was basically that. Just to
make sure the Cardinal got the point,
however, Arizona scored 18 of the sec
ond half's first 20 points — Stanford
missed seven of its first eight shots in
the half — to make it 56-24, thank you
and good night. Montgomery pulled
seniors Patrick, Kenny Ammann and
Deshon Wingate with 17:12 left in the
game and none of them ever made it
back.
The 18-2 run was punctuated by a
beautiful Matt Muehlebach-to-Mills lob
for a slam on an out-of-bounds play, and
the game was completely, totally,
emphatically over. The lead got up to 42
at one point — all the Wildcat starters
were pulled with 11 minutes left and the
score 62-28, and the reserves outscored
the Cardinal the rest of the way.
Call it an ass-kicking; call it devasta
tion; call it a joke — and, once again, call
it a road loss.
