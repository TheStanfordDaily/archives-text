# Driven McCarty steers Card offense
## 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
Stanford first baseman Dave
McCarty is a big man who does
not like to lose. At 6-foot-5 and
210 pounds, McCarty looks more

like a power forward than a power
hitter, but the Texas native is not
worried about apperances; he is
worried about success.
"I hate to lose," the junior said.
"I will do anything to help the
team win; I just hate to lose."

With a 16-3 record heading into
today's game against San Jose
State, the No. 1-ranked Cardinal
has not had to deal with losing
very often, and McCarty is doing
his best to keep it that way. Lead
ing the team with a .408 average
and tied for the team home run
lead with Jeffrey Hammonds at
nine round trippers each,
McCarty is a talented player on a
talented team, but he is still not
satisfied.
"Like a lot of great athletes,
(McCarty) is very intense," Cardi
nal coach Mark Marquess said.
"He wants to be the best he can
be; he has a burning desire to be
good."
This desire has its pitfalls. In
the third game of last weekend's
series against Arizonia State,
McCarty came to the plate with
the bases loaded desperately
wanting to bring in some runs.
Admittedly "jacked-up" during
the moment, he hit into a double
play and got nothing for his team
except two outs.
"I tried to do too much,"
McCarty said looking back. "I get
myself in trouble sometimes
(being so intense). Sometimes I
get to the point where I get too
intense and try too hard."
Mostly though, McCarty man
ages to keep himself under con
trol. Last year the junior was an
honorable mention All—Pacific 10
Conference selection after hitting
.336 with 12 home runs, 69 runs
batted in and a .578 slugging per
centage.
After helping the Cardinal to a
third-place finish in the College
World Series, McCarty traveled
the world with the U.S. National
Team, and led the squad with a

.444 average. The team won the
bronze medal at the Goodwill
Games and McCarty was named
to Baseball America's first—team
summer All—America squad,
partly for his hitting skills, and
partly because he does such a good
job keeping others off base.
Those who claim that a 6-foot
-5 first baseman would only result
in a clumsy, clodding, error-prone
nightmare, should head over to
Sunken Diamond to check the
agile exception to the rule.
McCarty leads the team with a
.995 fielding percentage, and as a
freshman made only one error in
350 attempts.
"(McCarty) is a great offensive
player, but is underrated defen
sively," Marquess said. "I think he
is the best defensive first baseman
in the country. He has those long
arms that can stretch; guys love
throwing to him accross the dia
mond."
Those long arms that stretch
for the putout also do a pretty
good job at the plate. Batting in
the number two spot, McCarty is

First baseman David McCarty has only one thing on his mind when
he takes the field for the Cardinal: winning. His attitude served the
top-ranked Cardinal well over the weekend as Stanford swept Six-
Pac rival Arizona State to take the early league lead.
