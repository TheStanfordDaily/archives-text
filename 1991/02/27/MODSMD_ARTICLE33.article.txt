# Synchronized swimmers top Ohio State
## 
### 
The second-ranked Stanford synchronized
swimming team set out last Saturday to 'kick
some Buckeye,' and did just that as the Cardi
nal defeated the national championship squad
from Ohio State 98-78 at the Stanford Invita
tional meet held at deGuerre Pool.
California took third place with 73 points
and UC-Davis followed with 13 points.
"It was surprising to beat them (the Buck
eyes) because Ohio State is such a power
house," freshman Georgia Bauman said.
While Stanford synchronized swimming has
only Varsity 111 status, the Ohio State program
has full varsity status with scholarships,
recruiting and practically unlimited pool time.
"I'm really happy with the way we swam,"
Bauman said. "The Stanford meet helped me
build confidence for upcoming meets."
The victory looked shaky at first for the
Cardinal as Ohio State took first in the senior
compulsory figure event, 13 one-thousandths
of a point ahead of the Cardinal. Junior
Melinda Downey placed first individually,

ahead of Buckeyes Sandra Valles and Jenny
Dunn. Freshman Debbie Downes took fourth
and junior Michelle Ghert was sixth.
Downey continued to dominate the meet by
winning the solo event and teaming up with
Bauman and Downes to win trio.
"I was pleasantly surprised with my plac
ings," Downey said. "We swam really well but
there's a lot of room for improvement. Fortu
nately, we have the time before nationals to
work through and refine the routines."
In the duet competition, Stanford once
again took first place with the team of Bauman
and Downes. Ghert and freshman Kristna
Evans followed with a fourth-place finish in
the event.
The only routine not won by Stanford was
the team event in which Ohio State edged out
the Cardinal squad of Bauman, Downey,
Downes, Evans, Ghert and juniors Rekha Rao
and Amanda Schivell in a 89.2 to 88.9 judge's
decision.
"We really should have won team," Downey

said.
"In a judged sport it's often frustrating to
lose by such a small margin." Ghert said.
Despite the loss in the team event, Stanford
was able to pull far ahead of the Buckeyes by
earning points in the junior and novice com
pulsory figure events. Rao was second in
junior figures behind Cal's Tracy Myers, while
Schivell took fifth. Sophomore Justine Mat
tera won novice figures to give the Cardinal a
comfortable advantage.
The Stanford Invitational was the Cardi
nal's first meet of the season. The national
championships will be held next month in Tuc
son, Ariz., where the Cardinal will attempt to
dethrone the reigning Buckeyes, who have
defeated Stanford for the championship four
years in a row.
"I think that for this early on in the season,
we look really strong," coach Vickey Weir said.
"We still have a long way to go, but we'll be
ready for nationals."
