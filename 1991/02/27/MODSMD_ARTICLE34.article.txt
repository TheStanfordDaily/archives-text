# Turning pro or no?
## 
### 
Ybu're at Stanford, the top
tennis school in the
nation. You've been a
starter on the NCAA champi
onship squad throughout your
career on the Farm. The
national champion rings are
piling up.

You've played tennis since
the time walk and
have been competing nation
ally for a decade. The whole
way up, all you could think
was, "Look at John McEnroe,"
or "I want to be like Bjorn
Borg." (Before he decided to
attempt a comeback at 35, that
is.)
There are so many Stanford
alums who have turned profes
sional the circuit looks like a
Who's Who of Cardinal tennis:
John McEnroe, Tim Mayotte,
Dan Goldie, Derrick Rostagno,
Jim Grabb, David Wheaton.
And those are just the guys at
the top.

Tennis has never seen such
international popularity. There
are more tournaments than
can be counted. Sponsors are
throwing dollars at potential
stars, and management groups
are begging for players to join
their team. The sport is even
rivaling soccer for television
time in Europe!
What to do after Stanford?
Turn pro, of course. What
do you have to lose?
The decision isn't as easy as
it seems. Just ask Glenn
Solomon.
A four-year starter in sin
gles for the Cardinal, Solomon
came to Stanford like most of
its tennis players: a well
known junior player with lots
of potential, eyeballing the
pros.
And he progressed as
expected. He played well and
helped bring the team three
consecutive national crowns.
He played in minor profes
sional tournaments during the
summers to get his ranking,
and competed as an individual
during the year to keep his pro
potential going.
Yesterday Solomon signed
with a Wall Street firm. His
professional career is officially
dead, never to be hatched. June

With such role models as
McEnroe, Goldie, Wheaton and in
recent years Jeff Tarango, Patrick
McEnroe, Martin Blackman and
Alexis Hombrecher, how does a
Stanford competitor decide not to
even give the pro circuit a try?
How do you call it quits after 10
years of fighting to get there?
Heading the list is Stanford
itself. Before coming to Stanford,
most tennis players' lives revolve
around tennis. And nothing else
came close. But after even only a
year on the Farm, competitors are
amazed with what else is out
there that is almost as interesting
as the sport.
"Tennis became something I

really wanted to excel at, and I
always thought in the back of my
mind that my ultimate goal was to
turn pro." Solomon said. "[But]
since I've been here I've realized
that tennis is great but it's not the
be-all end-all. Stanford made me
realize I have other interests."
And while some players still
relish the individual angle of the
sport, for others the team aspect
of the game played at the colle
giate level destroys the enjoyment
they once had at battling the
world by themselves.
To make it as a professional,
tennis players have to be not just
talented, but also fiercely individ
ual. They have to want to win it
all at all times, for themselves.
Stanford, however, gives it
players a sense of unity, of work
ing hard for team goals. Back
tracking may be just too tough.
"When I went on the pro tour I
realized how limiting it is. It's

much more fun to play for your
school and team than to play for
yourself," Solomon explained.
"You can attain a certain level of
achievement greater than any one
individual."
But even if a Stanford great
still adores tennis, after the col
lege and team experience, going
pro may just not be worth the
risk. Sure, there are tons of
enticements out there; Pete Sam
pras hauling in two million for
one tourney victory being just one
of them. But how many of the
pros ever crack the top 100? How
many earn Sampras-like incomes?
While Patrick McEnroe made it
to the big time this winter,
advancing to the finals of the Aus
tralian Open just two years after
graduation, so many others are
mired in anonymity. Former All-
American Tarango, who left in
1989 after his junior year, has
never been higher than 87 in the
world and is currently 110. Black
man, who also left after '89, is
301. Recently-turned pro Hom
brecher is ranked 343.
Solomon and an increasing
number of others — as more and
more tennis players decide to stick
with college through graduation

— do not want to play the num
bers game, despite the advice of
numerous pros, including Goldie,
Kevin Curren and Grabb.
"Every professional I've spo
ken to about this decision has said
definitely give tennis a try; if I
don't, I'll never know how I would
have done," Solomon said.
Even teammates feel the same.
Sophomore Jonathan Stark can't
wait to turn pro. Although he
realizes the benefits of a degree
and can see life beyond tennis,
Stanford's latest star knows the
only option for him is joining the
circuit. "It's always been in my
mind to turn pro — I wouldn't
have played with as much com
mitment as I have if that wasn't
what I want to do. It's definitely
something I have to try," Stark
said.
Solomon disagrees.
"In some respects I'm defying
those in the know by this decision,
but I think I can put my rackets
down and not regret it, though it's
been a difficult decision," he said.
Stanford can be an eye-opener.

days.
With such role models as
McEnroe, Goldie, Wheaton and in
recent years Jeff Tarango, Patrick
McEnroe, Martin Blackman and
Alexis Hombrecher, how does a
Stanford competitor decide not to
even give the pro circuit a try?
How do you call it quits after 10
years of fighting to get there?
Heading the list is Stanford
itself. Before coming to Stanford,
most tennis players' lives revolve
around tennis. And nothing else
came close. But after even only a
year on the Farm, competitors are
amazed with what else is out
there that is almost as interesting
as the sport.
"Tennis became something I

really wanted to excel at, and I
always thought in the back of my
mind that my ultimate goal was to
turn pro." Solomon said. "[But]
since I've been here I've realized
that tennis is great but it's not the
be-all end-all. Stanford made me
realize I have other interests."
And while some players still
relish the individual angle of the
sport, for others the team aspect
of the game played at the colle
giate level destroys the enjoyment
they once had at battling the
world by themselves.
To make it as a professional,
tennis players have to be not just
talented, but also fiercely individ
ual. They have to want to win it
all at all times, for themselves.
Stanford, however, gives it
players a sense of unity, of work
ing hard for team goals. Back
tracking may be just too tough.
"When I went on the pro tour I
realized how limiting it is. It's

much more fun to play for your
school and team than to play for
yourself," Solomon explained.
"You can attain a certain level of
achievement greater than any one
individual."
But even if a Stanford great
still adores tennis, after the col
lege and team experience, going
pro may just not be worth the
risk. Sure, there are tons of
enticements out there; Pete Sam
pras hauling in two million for
one tourney victory being just one
of them. But how many of the
pros ever crack the top 100? How
many earn Sampras-like incomes?
While Patrick McEnroe made it
to the big time this winter,
advancing to the finals of the Aus
tralian Open just two years after
graduation, so many others are
mired in anonymity. Former All-
American Tarango, who left in
1989 after his junior year, has
never been higher than 87 in the
world and is currently 110. Black
man, who also left after '89, is
301. Recently-turned pro Hom
brecher is ranked 343.
Solomon and an increasing
number of others — as more and
more tennis players decide to stick
with college through graduation

— do not want to play the num
bers game, despite the advice of
numerous pros, including Goldie,
Kevin Curren and Grabb.
"Every professional I've spo
ken to about this decision has said
definitely give tennis a try; if I
don't, I'll never know how I would
have done," Solomon said.
Even teammates feel the same.
Sophomore Jonathan Stark can't
wait to turn pro. Although he
realizes the benefits of a degree
and can see life beyond tennis,
Stanford's latest star knows the
only option for him is joining the
circuit. "It's always been in my
mind to turn pro — I wouldn't
have played with as much com
mitment as I have if that wasn't
what I want to do. It's definitely
something I have to try," Stark
said.
Solomon disagrees.
"In some respects I'm defying
those in the know by this decision,
but I think I can put my rackets
down and not regret it, though it's
been a difficult decision," he said.
Stanford can be an eye-opener.

Ybu're at Stanford, the top
tennis school in the
nation. You've been a
starter on the NCAA champi
onship squad throughout your
career on the Farm. The
national champion rings are
piling up.

You've played tennis since
the time walk and
have been competing nation
ally for a decade. The whole
way up, all you could think
was, "Look at John McEnroe,"
or "I want to be like Bjorn
Borg." (Before he decided to
attempt a comeback at 35, that
is.)
There are so many Stanford
alums who have turned profes
sional the circuit looks like a
Who's Who of Cardinal tennis:
John McEnroe, Tim Mayotte,
Dan Goldie, Derrick Rostagno,
Jim Grabb, David Wheaton.
And those are just the guys at
the top.

Tennis has never seen such
international popularity. There
are more tournaments than
can be counted. Sponsors are
throwing dollars at potential
stars, and management groups
are begging for players to join
their team. The sport is even
rivaling soccer for television
time in Europe!
What to do after Stanford?
Turn pro, of course. What
do you have to lose?
The decision isn't as easy as
it seems. Just ask Glenn
Solomon.
A four-year starter in sin
gles for the Cardinal, Solomon
came to Stanford like most of
its tennis players: a well
known junior player with lots
of potential, eyeballing the
pros.
And he progressed as
expected. He played well and
helped bring the team three
consecutive national crowns.
He played in minor profes
sional tournaments during the
summers to get his ranking,
and competed as an individual
during the year to keep his pro
potential going.
Yesterday Solomon signed
with a Wall Street firm. His
professional career is officially
dead, never to be hatched. June
