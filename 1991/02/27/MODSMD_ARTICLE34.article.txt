# Turning pro or no?
## 
### 
Ybu're at Stanford, the top
tennis school in the
nation. You've been a
starter on the NCAA champi
onship squad throughout your
career on the Farm. The
national champion rings are
piling up.

You've played tennis since
the time walk and
have been competing nation
ally for a decade. The whole
way up, all you could think
was, "Look at John McEnroe,"
or "I want to be like Bjorn
Borg." (Before he decided to
attempt a comeback at 35, that
is.)
There are so many Stanford
alums who have turned profes
sional the circuit looks like a
Who's Who of Cardinal tennis:
John McEnroe, Tim Mayotte,
Dan Goldie, Derrick Rostagno,
Jim Grabb, David Wheaton.
And those are just the guys at
the top.

Tennis has never seen such
international popularity. There
are more tournaments than
can be counted. Sponsors are
throwing dollars at potential
stars, and management groups
are begging for players to join
their team. The sport is even
rivaling soccer for television
time in Europe!
What to do after Stanford?
Turn pro, of course. What
do you have to lose?
The decision isn't as easy as
it seems. Just ask Glenn
Solomon.
A four-year starter in sin
gles for the Cardinal, Solomon
came to Stanford like most of
its tennis players: a well
known junior player with lots
of potential, eyeballing the
pros.
And he progressed as
expected. He played well and
helped bring the team three
consecutive national crowns.
He played in minor profes
sional tournaments during the
summers to get his ranking,
and competed as an individual
during the year to keep his pro
potential going.
Yesterday Solomon signed
with a Wall Street firm. His
professional career is officially
dead, never to be hatched. June
