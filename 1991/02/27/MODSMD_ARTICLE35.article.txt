# Gymnasts tune up

### Noah Blake Staff writer 
Stanford men's gymnastics
coach Sadao Hamada has been
smiling a lot lately, and justifiably
so. The Cardinal is undefeated
and is coming off its biggest win of
the season, last Friday's defeat of
No. 2 Ohio State. And in tonight's
meet against Michigan and San
Jose State in San Jose, he will
probably be able to rest most of
his starters.
Stanford has already trounced
the Spartans twice this season,
and Ohio State, not Michigan, is
the class of the Big Ten in gym
nastics. Yet the fact that the Car
dinal could easily beat either team
does not mean that the meet is
without value.
"A few of the guys are going to
try new vaults," said Hamada, "as
I feel they need to improve their
confidence in this event." Indeed,
vault has been one of the team's
weaker events this season, and
Stanford scores on vault must be
improved before the NCAAs.
"The meet is also a chance both

for us to rest some of the guys and
to get some of the others some
more meet experience." Hamada
said. "We won't be going for our
highest team score in this meet,
but we do want to win."
Should Michigan appear in
warmups to be better than
expected, Hamada said that he
will not hesitate to shuffle the
lineup and re-insert his higher
scoring athletes. "We'd like to do
some new and better sets in this
meet," he said, "but we're also on
a streak â€” a streak that we don't
want broken."
The Cardinal is in an enviable
position. Tonight it gets to face
two teams that are not expected to
be in its class, and will probably be
able to get its highest-scoring
gymnasts some well deserved rest.
Friday, Stanford will face these
same two teams in its last home
meet of the season, and will have
the luxury of throwing all the
tricks in its arsenal without fear
of losing. Is it any wonder that
lately Hamada looks like a man
who just won the lottery?
