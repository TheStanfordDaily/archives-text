Several dozen students and local resi
dents gathered in Branner Hall lounge
last night to hear a panel discussion that
highlighted the Israeli-Palestinian ques
tion in relation to developments in the
Persian Gulf war.
Titled "Middle-Eastern Perspectives
on the Middle East," the two-hour dis
cussion was moderated by acting Asst.
History Prof. Michael Chamberlain. In
light of the apparent resounding Iraqi
defeat, the panelists offered their views
on a post-war Middle East.
They agreed resolution of the Pales
tinian-Israeli conflict is of central impor
tance to any long-term regional stability
but disagreed on the likelihood of such a
settlement.
Guity Hashat, an Iraqi native and a
senior fellow at the Hoover Institution,
said the Palestinian question must be at
the forefront of any peace plan. "The
issue must be settled and the Palestini
ans given their own homeland," she
added.
Otherwise, she said, an even more
tragic event could develop in the Middle
East.

Hashat said she is mildly confident
the war would force some sort of settle
ment. She added that it is in Israel's best
interest to negotiate.
History Prof. Joel Beinin also said he
thinks the Gulf conflict will force the
international community to deal with
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. However,
he criticized the U.S. role in the Middle
East, claiming the "Bush administration
seems to be seeing how many Arabs it
can kill."
Beinin also expressed concern that
the United States may attempt "to
impose a Pax Americana on the Gulf."
Sami Mshasha, a former professor at
Birzit University in the Israeli-occupied
West Bank, offered an emotional appeal
on behalf of the Palestinian cause. "I am
speaking with a heavy heart tonight
because it is hard to make sense of the
terrible price of" the Gulf crisis, he said.
Palestinians, he said, have been sub
jected to a double standard by the inter
national community. "I really feel help
less," Mshasha added.
He also said he fears the Iraqi defeat
"will not force any solutions to the Pales
tinian question."
