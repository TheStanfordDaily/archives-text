# Professors petition for end to war
## 73 faculty members call for U.S. withdrawal, peace conference 
### Marie Bui Staff writer 
In the first interdepartmental reac
tion to the Gulf war since the January
teach-in, a group of faculty members
have spoken out against the Persian
Gulf war and demanded an immediate
cease-fire.
The 73 professors and lecturers —
from departments ranging from politi
cal science to linguistics — called for the
withdrawal of U.S. forces from the Gulf
and an international peace conference
on the Palestine-Israeli conflict. Their
plea was published in a half-page adver
tisement in Monday's Daily.
"We're all teachers so we're trying to
speak to a student audience who knows
us and respects us," said Assistant His
tory Prof. Joel Beinin, who authored the
statement.
Thirty professors attended a meeting
that Beinin arranged last Wednesday to
discuss and sign the statement. Beinin,
an outspoken critic of the war, invited
about 250 professors to the meeting,
targeting the offices of history and liter
ature professors and others in the Inner
Quad.
Beinin said he received enough con
tributions from the professors to cover
the cost of the advertisement. He said

'If you have a commitment you believe in, sign
ing a petition is a way of externalizing it.'

he regretted not having time to dis
tribute invitations to law, medical and
science professors.
The idea for the statement surfaced
at a monthly meeting of the Faculty
Seminar in Cultural Studies four weeks
ago. A similar petition was presented by
the faculty of UC-Santa Cruz.
Philosophy Prof. Michael Bratman
said the reason he signed the petition
should be "transparent." The statement
echoes his own beliefs, he said.
He added that although he could not
suggest the best way to resolve the con
flict, it is "not something we should be
bombing people over."
Assoc. Religious Studies Prof. Carl
Bielefeldt said he signed the statement
simply because it is titled "Faculty
Against War" even though he does not
consider himself extremely political.
Political Science Prof. Mark Tunic,
who believes all wars should be avoided
in principle, also said the broad empha
sis of the statement attracted him.
"If you have a commitment you

believe in, signing a petition is a way of
externalizing it,"he said.
Jody Maxmin, known for being able
to remember the name and interests of
every student in her popular art and
classics courses, cited her field of study
as a source of her anti-war belief.
"Those of us who study ancient
things realize we keep fighting the same
wars," she said.
History Prdf. Albert Camarillo said
he signed the statement because the
Vietnam War experience of his youth
taught him war is counter productive.
The petition represents only a hand
ful of professors in a small community
2,500 miles from the White House, but
this form of protest is "something more
than doing nothing," Maxmin said.
Benin said he and other professors
would continue to protest the war by
demonstrating, rallying and teaching,
but he called the statement "an addi
tional way of making our opinion
heard."
