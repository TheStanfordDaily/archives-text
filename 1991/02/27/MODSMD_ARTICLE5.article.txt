# Foreigners learn about U.S. through its reaction to war
## 
### Jennifer Paley Staff writer 
For foreigners living at Stanford, the 43
days since the beginning of the Persian
Gulf war have presented a special opportu
nity.
Looking at students' reactions to the
Gulf war from their own perspective, many
foreign students and journalists studying
here say they have learned more about the
United States during the war than they
could have otherwise.
In particular, some say they have gained
special insight into U.S. media and culture.
Opinions on U.S. media coverage of the
war vary greatly. Some, comparing the
United States to their home countries, say
they appreciate the American media cover
age of the war. Others, however, think
media coverage has had a narrow focus that
has warped the U.S. interpretation of the
war.
Sanjay Raghu, a senior from South
Africa, said the U.S. media is much more
informative than his country's.
"I wouldn't be exposed to outside
sources if I were in South Africa because
the media [are] censored. In the United
States I'm getting news from more than
one source," he said.
But other students, including some
whose countries have strong press restric
tions, are dissatisfied with the coverage of
the war.
"I was taken aback by the bias I saw in

the [U.S.] media. I do appreciate that it is
wartime, but I am appalled by the way the
media is treating the war like a video
game," said Metin Gokan, a 1989 graduate
from Turkey.
Some foreign journalists believe the
media's coverage reflects a struggle to be
popular during wartime. "The media fears
being identified as anti-American. They
fear losing viewers and readers," said Mario
Santos, managing editor of Folha de Sao
Paulo in Brazil and one of the seven inter
national journalists in the Knight Fellow
ship Program.
The Knight program allows professional
journalists to spend a year at Stanford pur
suing academic interests of their choice.
Another Knight fellow, however, was less
critical.
Leonid Zagalsky, a Soviet journalist, said
it is difficult for U.S. journalists to main
tain their objectivity as they report on their
own country in wartime.
"When you are in the Gulf, it is hard to
be personally objective," he said.
Since the Gulf conflict began, some of
these foreign students and journalists say
they have also learned much about atti
tudes here toward the Unites States and
other cultures.
Ignacio Corona, a graduate student from
Mexico, suggested that Americans are igno
rant of other cultures. "Not so many Amer
icans are well informed. ... In order to
understand the situation better you
must have more sources of information
than the television."
One Indian student said Americans
are neither exposed to other views nor
aware of how other cultures think.
"There's a deep gap between Western
culture and Middle Eastern culture. .. .
No American understands the Arabian
point of view," he said.
Sophomore Mona Mourshed said
this perceived ignorance may have
arisen from the fact that there is no
Middle Eastern Studies department at
Stanford.
"People think that Arabs are either
Sheiks or terrorists," said Mourshed, a
student from Egypt and the president of
the Model Arab League at Stanford.
Concern about the ramifications of
stereotypes is common among foreign
students.
Carl Im, a graduate student from
Korea and the resident assistant in
Hammarskjold House, said he is afraid
of paranoia among some Americans. "I
was afraid of xenophobia because of
[incidents like the one] in San Jose
when two Indian students wearing tur
bans were threatened because they
were thought to have been Arabs."

He said although there is great cul
tural diversity in the United States,
there has to be "more education and
understanding" of other cultures to pre
vent such incidents.
Stanford students' responses to the
war elicited varied reactions from these
foreign journalists and students.
Zagalsky called campus anti-war ral
lies "a little hysterical" and said it is
naive to think "shouting to stop the war
will be heard in Washington."
"But it is conservative here when you
compare it to Berkeley, which is really
psychotic," he said.
Despite such distractions, Zagalsky
said being in the United States is help
ing him gain a fuller understanding of
the Gulf war because he can "speak
with different people and learn about
their attitudes."
Santos said the Stanford and Palo
Alto communities are "islands in the
(United) States" because their residents
are much more informed and more will
ing to be critical than the general popu

lation.
Raghu said, "It's more enlightening
to be at Stanford during the war â€” with
all the peace movements and various
groups that have come forward."
Shingeru Tanaka, a Japanese stu
dent, said "patriotic situations" are
more prevalent in the United States
than in Japan. "If it was Japan
[involved] the general population would
be against the war."
Zagalsky said his experience in the
Soviet Union has caused him to support
American policy in the Gulf. "I appreci
ate the idea of [supporting! human
rights, coming from a country with lots
of violence."
He said he believes the United States
supports the principle of sovereignty for
Kuwait and "has no oil interests."
But Santos, who referred to the
United States as the "police of the
whole world," said he thinks the United
States is fighting in the Persian Gulf
because it is "economically threatened
[and] fears losing wealth and position in
the world."

vent such incidents.
Stanford students' responses to the
war elicited varied reactions from these
foreign journalists and students.
Zagalsky called campus anti-war ral
lies "a little hysterical" and said it is
naive to think "shouting to stop the war
will be heard in Washington."
"But it is conservative here when you
compare it to Berkeley, which is really
psychotic," he said.
Despite such distractions, Zagalsky
said being in the United States is help
ing him gain a fuller understanding of
the Gulf war because he can "speak
with different people and learn about
their attitudes."
Santos said the Stanford and Palo
Alto communities are "islands in the
(United) States" because their residents
are much more informed and more will
ing to be critical than the general popu

lation.
Raghu said, "It's more enlightening
to be at Stanford during the war â€” with
all the peace movements and various
groups that have come forward."
Shingeru Tanaka, a Japanese stu
dent, said "patriotic situations" are
more prevalent in the United States
than in Japan. "If it was Japan
[involved] the general population would
be against the war."
Zagalsky said his experience in the
Soviet Union has caused him to support
American policy in the Gulf. "I appreci
ate the idea of [supporting! human
rights, coming from a country with lots
of violence."
He said he believes the United States
supports the principle of sovereignty for
Kuwait and "has no oil interests."
But Santos, who referred to the
United States as the "police of the
whole world," said he thinks the United
States is fighting in the Persian Gulf
because it is "economically threatened
[and] fears losing wealth and position in
the world."

For foreigners living at Stanford, the 43
days since the beginning of the Persian
Gulf war have presented a special opportu
nity.
Looking at students' reactions to the
Gulf war from their own perspective, many
foreign students and journalists studying
here say they have learned more about the
United States during the war than they
could have otherwise.
In particular, some say they have gained
special insight into U.S. media and culture.
Opinions on U.S. media coverage of the
war vary greatly. Some, comparing the
United States to their home countries, say
they appreciate the American media cover
age of the war. Others, however, think
media coverage has had a narrow focus that
has warped the U.S. interpretation of the
war.
Sanjay Raghu, a senior from South
Africa, said the U.S. media is much more
informative than his country's.
"I wouldn't be exposed to outside
sources if I were in South Africa because
the media [are] censored. In the United
States I'm getting news from more than
one source," he said.
But other students, including some
whose countries have strong press restric
tions, are dissatisfied with the coverage of
the war.
"I was taken aback by the bias I saw in

the [U.S.] media. I do appreciate that it is
wartime, but I am appalled by the way the
media is treating the war like a video
game," said Metin Gokan, a 1989 graduate
from Turkey.
Some foreign journalists believe the
media's coverage reflects a struggle to be
popular during wartime. "The media fears
being identified as anti-American. They
fear losing viewers and readers," said Mario
Santos, managing editor of Folha de Sao
Paulo in Brazil and one of the seven inter
national journalists in the Knight Fellow
ship Program.
The Knight program allows professional
journalists to spend a year at Stanford pur
suing academic interests of their choice.
Another Knight fellow, however, was less
critical.
Leonid Zagalsky, a Soviet journalist, said
it is difficult for U.S. journalists to main
tain their objectivity as they report on their
own country in wartime.
"When you are in the Gulf, it is hard to
be personally objective," he said.
Since the Gulf conflict began, some of
these foreign students and journalists say
they have also learned much about atti
tudes here toward the Unites States and
other cultures.
Ignacio Corona, a graduate student from
Mexico, suggested that Americans are igno
rant of other cultures. "Not so many Amer
icans are well informed. ... In order to
understand the situation better you
must have more sources of information
than the television."
One Indian student said Americans
are neither exposed to other views nor
aware of how other cultures think.
"There's a deep gap between Western
culture and Middle Eastern culture. .. .
No American understands the Arabian
point of view," he said.
Sophomore Mona Mourshed said
this perceived ignorance may have
arisen from the fact that there is no
Middle Eastern Studies department at
Stanford.
"People think that Arabs are either
Sheiks or terrorists," said Mourshed, a
student from Egypt and the president of
the Model Arab League at Stanford.
Concern about the ramifications of
stereotypes is common among foreign
students.
Carl Im, a graduate student from
Korea and the resident assistant in
Hammarskjold House, said he is afraid
of paranoia among some Americans. "I
was afraid of xenophobia because of
[incidents like the one] in San Jose
when two Indian students wearing tur
bans were threatened because they
were thought to have been Arabs."

He said although there is great cul
tural diversity in the United States,
there has to be "more education and
understanding" of other cultures to pre
vent such incidents.
