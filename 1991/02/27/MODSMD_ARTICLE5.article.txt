# Foreigners learn about U.S. through its reaction to war
##

For foreigners living at Stanford, the 43
days since the beginning of the Persian
Gulf war have presented a special opportu
nity.
Looking at students' reactions to the
Gulf war from their own perspective, many
foreign students and journalists studying
here say they have learned more about the
United States during the war than they
could have otherwise.
In particular, some say they have gained
special insight into U.S. media and culture.
Opinions on U.S. media coverage of the
war vary greatly. Some, comparing the
United States to their home countries, say
they appreciate the American media cover
age of the war. Others, however, think
media coverage has had a narrow focus that
has warped the U.S. interpretation of the
war.
Sanjay Raghu, a senior from South
Africa, said the U.S. media is much more
informative than his country's.
"I wouldn't be exposed to outside
sources if I were in South Africa because
the media [are] censored. In the United
States I'm getting news from more than
one source," he said.
But other students, including some
whose countries have strong press restric
tions, are dissatisfied with the coverage of
the war.
"I was taken aback by the bias I saw in

the [U.S.] media. I do appreciate that it is
wartime, but I am appalled by the way the
media is treating the war like a video
game," said Metin Gokan, a 1989 graduate
from Turkey.
Some foreign journalists believe the
media's coverage reflects a struggle to be
popular during wartime. "The media fears
being identified as anti-American. They
fear losing viewers and readers," said Mario
Santos, managing editor of Folha de Sao
Paulo in Brazil and one of the seven inter
national journalists in the Knight Fellow
ship Program.
The Knight program allows professional
journalists to spend a year at Stanford pur
suing academic interests of their choice.
Another Knight fellow, however, was less
critical.
Leonid Zagalsky, a Soviet journalist, said
it is difficult for U.S. journalists to main
tain their objectivity as they report on their
own country in wartime.
"When you are in the Gulf, it is hard to
be personally objective," he said.
Since the Gulf conflict began, some of
these foreign students and journalists say
they have also learned much about atti
tudes here toward the Unites States and
other cultures.
Ignacio Corona, a graduate student from
Mexico, suggested that Americans are igno
rant of other cultures. "Not so many Amer
icans are well informed. ... In order to
