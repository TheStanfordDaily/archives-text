# Greeks: Philanthropy not for publicity
## 
### Connie Chang Editorial staff 
As fraternities and sororities become
increasingly active in organizing com
munity service events, some Greek
members say they are frustrated by
anti-Greek sentiments on campus.
The problem arises because some
people find the combination of being
Greek and doing charity work unusual,
or even ironic, some fraternity and
sorority members say.
Alpha Phi Vice President Susan
Turk, who helped design fliers for the
sorority's Aerobics Challenge, held last
Saturday, said she tried to "downplay
the role of the sorority [in the event]
because the campus is anti-Greek and
won't want to do it of a sorority is
involved."
Former Kappa Alpha philanthropy
chair Jay Daniel, known as "Mud Czar"
because he organized the fraternity's
Mud Volleyball Tournament for the last
two years, also said he has encountered
stereotypes about fraternity members
who sponsor charity events.

"People think we do it to put on our
job applications, but we didn't do it for a
reward or acclamations, but for a wor
thy cause," said Daniel, a junior.
Program and Fraternal Affairs
Adviser Michael Ramsey-Perez said he
thinks sororities and fraternities do
public service work for the same rea
sons as other Stanford students. He also
said he does not believe there is any
stigma attached to Greek service
events.
"Everyone knows fraternities and
sororities always do community service;
that's part of their mission," he said.
In addition to larger events like the
Mud Volleyball Tournament or the Aer
obics Challenge, Greek organizations
participate in a variety of smaller activ
ities that are less well publicized, said
Kerren Hedlund, the Intersorority
Council's campus events coordinator.
Such projects include holding canned
food drives and volunteering to tutor
children in East Palo Alto.
Hedlund said she is not concerned
with what the rest of the Stanford com
munity thinks because fraternities and

sororities do not perform community
service for good publicity.
Greek organizations have placed a
greater emphasis on community service
in recent years, members say. Interfra
ternity Council Alumni President Mike
Armstrong, a 1970 graduate and a
Sigma Alpha Epsilon member, said
there has been a "change in the last few
years toward more aggressive activity
and a distinct recognition that commu
nity service has to be a focus more than
in the past."
Armstrong noted that like many
Stanford students, individuals in the
Greek system have always done com
munity service. However, he said com
munity service leadership positions
within fraternities and sororities are "a
new thing."
Daniel said that because the Mud
Volleyball Tournament raised more
than $10,000 this year for the Muscular
Dystrophy Association — the national
organizations' charity of choice — he
hopes people will realize that the
"Greek community is not drinking beer
and making ethnic jokes all the time."
