## U.S., Iraq agree to cease-fire after 100-hour ground war

D UAH RAN, Saudi Arabia (AP)
— The Desert Storm allies ceased
fire this morning, 100 hours into a
lightning ground offensive and
209 days after Saddam Hussein's
troops marched into Kuwait.
In Baghdad, Iraq ordered its
soldiers to stop all fighting in the
Persian Gulf War theater of oper
ations.
The order, announced by a mil
itary spokesman on Baghdad
radio, came about three hours
after the allies said they had
ceased offensive military opera
tions.
"(President) Bush ordered this
morning to suspend military oper
ations. We are happy for the halt
in fighting, which will save a lot of
our sons and grant the safety of
our people.
"Therefore, orders were issued
to all our men in the battlefront
not to open fire," the radio said.
A senior U.S. military source
said Iraqi soldiers would not be
attacked if they approached U.S.
positions peacefully. Iraqi forces
also would be allowed to retreat —
even with their weapons — but "if
they take offensive action then
we're going to take whatever it
takes to protect the forces,"he
said.
"Kuwait is liberated. Iraq's
army is defeated," President Bush
announced in a national television
appearance yesterday night. A
permanent cease-fire in the Per

sian Gulf War would take hold
once Iraq ended all hostilities,
released POWs and foreign cap
tives and met other conditions, he
said.
"At 0800 hours Riyadh time,
offensive operations ceased," said
Navy Capt. Ron Wildermuth,
director of the U.S. military's
Joint Information Bureau in the
Saudi capital. The deadline time
was last night at 9 p.m. PST.
Since Iraq seized its oil-rich
neighbor, 283 allied soldiers have
died, 51 are listed as missing and
13 were being held as prisoners of
war.
An Iraqi official said 20,000
Iraqis were killed and 60,000
wounded in first 26 days of the
war. U.S. officials said more than
80,000 Iraqis had been taken pris
oner.
"We're convinced we've ren
dered combat ineffective about
40-and-a-half divisions," the
senior U.S. source said, speaking
on condition of anonymity Iraqi
divisions number about 10,000 to
15,000 men. "We've broken his
back through aggressive offensive
operations."
U.N. ambassadors said Iraqi
Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz had
informed the United Nations that
Iraq accepted all Security Council
resolutions on the Gulf War, as
demanded by the allies.
Reports from the field yester
day spoke of tank battles raging

on the outskirts of Basra, while
far to the northwest, troopers of
the U.S. 101st Airborne Division
stood less than 100 miles from
Baghdad in the deepest penetra
tion of Iraq.
But U.S. generals already had
declared the outcome certain by
the time Bush went on television
to say the war was won.
"This war is now behind us,"
Bush said. "Ahead of us is the task
of achieving a potentialy historic
peace" in the Middle East.
In liberated Kuwait City hours
before, joyous residents flocked to
the streets to cheer their flag and
throng triumphant U.S. and
Saudi troops. "Thank you, Amer
ica!" they shouted.
Yesterday's tank battle in
Iraq's Southern Desert, west of
the southern Iraqi city of Basra,
was the biggest armor engage
ment since World War 11.
Hundreds of tanks of the U.S.
Ist and 3rd Armored Divisions
and 2nd Armored Cavalry Regi
ment clashed with a Republican
Guard division in a key showdown
in the U.S.-British push to drive
the Iraqi army's beleaguered rem
nants into the Basra corner.
For whatever Iraqi units pulled
back to Basra, escape routes were
limited. The city is hemmed in by
rivers on two sides and by Desert
Storm troops elsewhere.
