Bangladesh holds its first-ever
democratic parliament election
DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — The party
headed by the widow of an assassinated presi
dent held an early lead in yesterday's parliamen
tary election, the first democratic transition of
power in Bangladesh's 20 years of independence.
Counting of the paper ballots was slow in
the races for the 300-member Parliament. The
leading contestants were Khaleda Zia's
Bangladesh National Party and a party led by
Sheik Hasina, the daughter of another assassi
nated president.
With unofficial results announced for 84
seats, Mrs. Zia's party had 41 seats, United
News of Bangladesh reported.
'Broad framework' reached for
settlement of Valdez litigation
JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — Exxon Corp. and
state and federal officials have agreed to a
broad framework for settlement of the govern
ments' civil claims over the Exxon Valdez oil
spill, a state official said yesterday
Alaska Attorney General Charles Cole said
that under the proposal, Exxon would pay to
restore natural resources in Prince William
Sound and further scientific studies and
cleanup would be done.
The agreement is "in the ballpark" of $1.2
billion, Cole said.
The scenic waterway was polluted with
nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil when the
tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground in March
1989.
Demolition of quake-damaged
Embarcadero Freeway begins
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Sixteen months
after an earthquake crippled the Embarcadero
Freeway, Mayor Art Agnos yesterday struck
the first blow in the demolition of the double
deck stmcture.
About 200 people gathered beneath the
doomed pavement under a drizzling sky as a
brass band blared "Happy Days Are Here
Again." Most appeared happy to see the free
way go.
The 150,000-ton, 1.7-mile structure will be
destroyed over the next four months. It once
carried 60,000 cars and trucks a day to and
from downtown but has been closed since it
suffered structural damage in the October
1989 earthquake.
