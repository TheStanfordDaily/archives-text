# All but Cranston cleared in Keating 5 inquiry
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Senate
Ethics Committee yesterday found
"substantial credible evidence" of mis
conduct by Alan Cranston, but said no
further action is warranted against
four other senators for intervening
with federal thrift regulators on behalf
of Charles Keating.
The six-member committee's unan
imous report set the stage for possible
censure of Cranston, D-Calif., by the
full Senate.

But the committee effectively closed
the case against the other four mem
bers of the so-called Keating Five, even
though the conduct of two — Sens.
Donald Riegle, D-Mich., and Dennis
DeConcini, D-Ariz., — "gave the
appearance of being improper."
The committee also found that
Sens. John Glenn, D-Ohio, and John
McCain, R-Ariz., "exercised poor judg
ment" in their actions on behalf of
Keating, the onetime owner of the

failed Lincoln Savings & Loan.
All of the Keating Five stoutly
denied any wrongdoing. Cranston
charged he had been "unfairly singled
out."
Before acting further in Cranston's
case, the committee must send him a
statement detailing the specific
charges against him and give him a
chance to respond.
The committee said in a resolution
it found "substantial credible evi

dence" that "Sen. Cranston engaged in
an impermissible pattern of conduct in
which fund-raising and official activi
ties were substantially linked."
All five senators met both with
Keating and with enforcement officials
to discuss his troubled thrift at a time
when regulators were investigating
the institution.
Keating and his associates donated
$1.3 million to the campaigns and
political causes of the five lawmakers.
