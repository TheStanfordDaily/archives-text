## Suspended before trial 
### 
University should not
punish Theta Xi until
after investigations

ON MONDAY, THE Univer
sity suspended the Theta Xi
fraternity, pending the
investigation of a fight that broke
out there at a party last week.
While the Theta Xis may or may
not have deserved some type of
punishment, their suspension
brings up questions concerning
exactly what punishments for sim
ilar incidents should be and who
should be doing the punishing.
Party-goers reported that people
were only irregularly checked for
Stanford identification at the door
of the Theta Xis. In addition, wit
nesses claim, people were not
checked for proof of age and alco
hol was available to anyone at the
party, whether or not they were
older than 21.
These are violations of both of
the new University alcohol policy
and the new Interfraternity Coun
cil party regulations. But the real
issue is not whether the Theta Xis
actually committed these viola
tions.
Instead, the issues are these:
How should fraternities be pun
ished, if necessary, and who should
make this decision?
After the incident, the Theta Xis
were immediately suspended from
social activities by the University
— before an investigation had even
begun, punishing the fraternity
before a trial had taken place.
Perhaps a better punishment
would have been to place the fra
ternity on probation while an
investigation was conducted,
rather than banning them from
parties for unproven allegations.
This would serve to warn the fra
ternity to shape up, but would not

have declared it guilty before a
trial. It also would have allowed for
a stricter punishment if they vio
lated the probation.
An even larger issue brought
into question by the suspension of
the Theta Xis is who should be
doing the punishing. In the past,
the University has determined
whether to reprimand fraternities,
but in the past year it has allowed
the IFC to take a larger amount of
responsibility through self-regula
tion.
The IFC has established a Judi
cial Board that is designed to act as
the body that will regulate the con
duct of fraternities.
In another step toward self-reg
ulation, the IFC last month estab
lished a set of guidelines for frater
nities to follow when they throw
parties.
The Theta Xis may have violated
these guidelines, and if they did,
they should be punished by the IFC.
There are clear limitations to
regulation of the Greek system by
either the University or the IFC.
On the one hand, the University is
demonstrably anti-Greek and
would most likely give punish
ments that are unduly harsh. On
the other hand, there is a conflict
of interest with fraternities decid
ing whether or not they themselves
are guilty and deserve punishment.
But the University, if it is truly
committed to allowing the fraterni
ties to regulate themselves, should
have allowed the IFC to make the
decision on whether to suspend the
Theta Xis rather than preempting
their decision. By making the deci
sion to suspend, the University has
issued a statement that it will not
allow Greek self-regulation,
whether or not the statement was
intended.
The University must clarify its
stance on whether or not it is going
to allow fraternities to regulate
themselves. A definite answer is
needed.
