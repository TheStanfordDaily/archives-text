Some terrorist tactics are justifiable for Third World

Your Tuesday columnist
failed to draw the correct conclu
sions from his own insightful
observations about the Persian Gulf war
and terrorism.
His conclusion should have been that
we need more terrorism — though a dif
ferent kind of terrorism — not less.
Real development in Third World
countries requires their adopting policies
that will often be in direct conflict with
the stated self-interest of Western capi
talist countries. The West clearly has few
qualms about using conventional mili
tary force to suppress any such policy
moves.
The Gulf war is only one example in a
long line of such incidents.
However, the Gulf war teaches us a
very specific lesson. It appears that the
differences in conventional military
strength between a superpower and even
a relatively powerful Third World coun
try are great enough to make the out
come of any military conflict a fairly

painless victory for the superpower.
Instead of facing the West on its
grounds of conventional warfare, there
fore, the Third World should perhaps try
to use terrorism.
The vast amounts of capital spent on
MIG 295, which have to be flown to
neighboring countries to be used success
fully, and on T-725, which without air
cover do not stand much of a chance,
could perhaps be more fruitfully spent
on developing international terrorist net
works.
Your columnist is very right in point
ing out that the kind of random, small
scale attacks on civilian targets that have
been used by most terrorist groups can
not possibly be effective and thus are not
justified.
However, that is not the only way to
carry out terrorism.
I suggest a more systematic approach
that concentrates on a different kind of
target.
The targets should not be chosen for

publicity or to create "civic uncertainty"
but should be chosen in the same man
ner as the U.S. Army chooses its bomb
ing targets in Iraq.
The terrorist groups should attack
factories, disrupt communication net
works and kill military personnel. This
should not be done in order to raise sym
pathy but just to say to Western coun
tries what Bush in effect tried to say to
the Iraqi people: This is the price you
will have to pay for your government's
actions.
Feasibility is, of course, the big issue.
I am not sure whether it is possible
for the Third World to develop such
large-scale ongoing operations within
Western countries given that one would
be facing at least two of the world's most
effective terrorist organizations, namely
the Mossad and the Central Intelligence
Agency.
However, as many have observed, ter
rorism exploits weaknesses peculiar in
many ways to Western societies. These

societies are very dependent on large
manufacturing plants and extensive —
and therefore exposed — communication
and transport networks.
Of course all this must be done in par
allel with changing the governments of
Third World countries from within so
that we do not have Saddam Husseins.
And by joining and funding move
ments within Western countries which
attempt to change, these Third World
societies move in directions more favor
able to the world nsa whole.
Certainly, if it is possible to change
the stance of Western governments with
out violence, then that should be the pre
ferred route.
But that seems unlikely, given the
public's support of the U.S. govern
ment's action.
We may just have to take Che Gue
vara's advice and take the fight to the
enemies' home.
