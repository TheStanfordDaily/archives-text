# De Necochea inspired boy to work hard, strive for success
## 
### 
Dear president Kennedy, i
recently read a newspaper article
about the dismissal of Fernando
de Necochea. It is difficult for me to fully
express the total range of emotions and
thoughts that I have experienced since
learning of your decision.
I am someone you know. I am one of
those many single-parent, Mexican-
American women who has eagerly served
and supported the programs that would
get my children the education they
needed in order to fully participate,
thrive and succeed in our society.
I am one of the many who believed
Stanford was a university that had made
a firm commitment to support the
recruitment and retention of Mexican-

Americans, whether they were students,
staff or faculty.
Stanford needs more persons like de
Necochea. He opens doors; perhaps he
even creates some.
This is what he did for my family:
De Necochea was the person who first
exposed me to the need for programs
that would recruit, support and retain
minority students in institutions of
higher education.
He also exposed me to the possibility
that my children could attend a univer
sity, even Stanford. De Necochea even
invited us to visit the campus.
My son was in sixth grade at the time
and I felt it was too soon, too expensive,
too much for me to think about. At that

time, I had my hands full with sixth
grade academics as well as three jobs.
But the two of us did visit the campus
and my son listened to de Necochea.
Makoa (my son) left wearing the Stan
ford sweatshirt de Necochea had given
him as a gift.
That was not the only gift he was
given.
De Necochea motivated and inspired
Makoa; my son began applying himself
in his studies, and I thrived seeing my
son working toward a goal I had never
achieved.
My son realized he would have to
begin applying himself early — in sixth
grade — if he were going to be accepted
at Stanford. Makoa was expecting to see

de Necochea at Stanford.
Please help me explain why he will
not be there.
I chose only to write about my per
sonal experience of de Necochea
although I am aware of the array of valu
able programs de Necochea has initiated
at Stanford as well as the collections he
and Roberto Trujillo have brought to the
campus.
Please reconsider your decision.
Expand the program and de Necochea's
responsibilities. Don't eliminate someone
so valuable.
I would like to meet you some day.
Perhaps at my son's graduation, stand
ing next to de Necochea.
