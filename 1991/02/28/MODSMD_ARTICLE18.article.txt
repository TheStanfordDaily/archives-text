## Stereotyping reality 
### 
SOMETIMES THERE'S A FINE
line between stereotype and reality.
Recently, Casa Zapata voted to let a
student design the dorm t-shirt. Every
one agreed on incorporating a portrait of
Emiliano Zapata, the Mexican revolution
ary hero for whom the house was named.
The artist came up with a unique
design.
The front of the t-shirt depicted a brick
wall with the words "Casa Zapata" spray
painted in distinct "Cholo" writing.
(Cholo is a type of Chicano gang member,
although sometimes he is neither Chi
cano nor a gang member.) The back
showed Zapata in his typical Mexican rev
olutionary garb, striking a "gangsta"
pose.
Inscribed in Zapata's wide sombrero
were the words "Casa Zapata," followed
by a familiar Spanish obscenity.
There was controversy as soon as the
artist revealed his design. The debate that
ensued encompassed everything from a
discussion of stereotypes to a definition of
culture and ethnic identity.
Most students objected to the use of
obscenity in the t-shirt. There was wider
dissent over the depiction of the Cholo
lifestyle and the graffiti. Dorm residents
who were against the design opposed it on
the grounds that it focused on some "neg
ative" stereotypes of Chicanos and Lati
nos, and glorified the "evils" of the inner
city.
The line between stereotype and real
ity can be somewhat confusing.
The Chicano identity is shaped and
defined by a myriad of experiences — in
the American southwestern border

region as immigrants, as farm workers
and even as inhabitants of the inner city.
The culture of the Chicano masses
today grows out of poverty and, some
times, desperation. Undeniably, there is
violence in the inner city and many of its
inhabitants openly rebel against the most
visible icons of institutional power: the
police and the school system. Sadly, the
violence often turns against innocent vic
tims and seems senseless at times.
But this is only one extreme — an
aberration rather than a norm.
It is wrong to assume that because the
artist of the t-shirt chose to highlight the
experience of this urban Chicano subcul
ture, he was glorifying violence and law
lessness. There is no doubt that some
expressions of Chicano culture are offen
sive to mainstream society. This is mostly
because Chicano culture resists it so will
fully.
But to let mainstream society define
Chicano culture and ethnic identity
would be to make ourselves undiscernible
from mainstream white culture. We give
different expression to our ethnicity, and
this often jars mainstream society — we
live in a society that doesn't value differ
ences and would just as soon strip us of
our native culture if we let it.
We shouldn't let anyone dictate what
our stereotypes should be, or deprecate
our culture in that way.
Resistance includes giving new mean
ing to old stigmas. There is great power in
being able to redefine old stereotypes.
The very word Chicano as it was rede
fined by activists in the 1960s is an exam
ple of this.

Although the word originally had neg
ative connotations and was used as a
derogatory term for people of Mexican
descent, the first leaders of the
Movimiento adopted the term for them
selves and made the act of self-identifica
tion into a powerful political statement.
Emiliano Zapata is also a portrait of
resistance. He was an Indian peasant
from the lowest rungs of Mexican society
and was everything that the Mexican
elites scoffed at. He, too, was associated
with violence and lawlessness, for he had
a very direct way of resisting; he and his
"zapatistas" took up arms.
His tragic death and the revolution he
took part in made him a hero. Today, Zap
ata posters sell almost as well as those of
Che Guevara.
The little punks in the inner city are
modern day "zapatistas," which is not to
say that they are about to take up arms
(although some may argue that they
already do — against each other), but
because they also come from the lowest
rungs of society and their culture is dep
recated just the same.
I think that Zapata might not have
minded association with these punks. He
might not even have minded the obscene
word inscribed in his sombrero.
