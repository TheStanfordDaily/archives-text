A San Francisco gay couple who died
from AIDS have bequeathed a $200,000
scholarship fund to gay and lesbian stu
dents at Stanford and two other Bay area
universities.
The Markowski-Leach fund, the first
six-figure financial endowment exclu
sively for gay and lesbian students, was
formally announced Tuesday at San
Francisco State University, another of the
designated schools. The announcement
received wide praise from members of the
gay and lesbian community.
The couple planned that representa
tives from their estates, Stanford, San
Francisco State and the third university
— UC-Berkeley — would form a seven

person committee this summer to orga
nize and clarify the terms of the scholar
ships, said Ron Barr, director of develop
ment at San Francisco State.
Because the funds are private, they are
likely to be protected from potential
charges of discrimination against hetero
sexuals, Barr said.
However, if Stanford administrators or
faculty are part of the committee that
administers the scholarships, the pro
gram may contradict University policy.
"The University does not disburse
scholarships that discriminate on the
basis of race, creed and sexual prefer
ence," said Robert Huff, director of the
Financial Aids Office.
Stanford administrators could not
comment yesterday about the scholarship
because the University has not been for

mally extended the offer.
Interest generated from the $200,000
will create 13 renewable annual scholar
ships, with the amount of each based on
the recipient's tuition. The maximum
amount is $5,000, an official at San Fran
cisco State University said.
The program is scheduled to start in
fall 1992.
The fund is named after Thomas
Markowski, who died in 1987 at age 28,
and James Leach, who was 32 at the time
of his death in 1989. Both men were suc
cessful computer analysts and real estate
investors.
Members of the gay and lesbian com
munity around the country and at Stan
ford say they think the scholarships will
open up greater possibilities for gay and
lesbian students.

Robert Bray, a spokesperson for the
National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, a
civil rights group based in Washington,
D.C., called the scholarship "unprece
dented for academic institutions."
"The closet is alive and well at colleges
and universities across the country. This
type of gesture helps us open the closet
door, and hopefully recipients will become
role models for other gay and lesbian stu
dents," Bray added.
English Prof. Ron Rebholz, an outspo
ken gay faculty member, said the scholar
ships would encourage individuals to
declare their sexual orientation. "This
could show that there are more gay and
lesbian people here than there appear to
be," he added.
David Cruz, a graduate student in
mathematics and an officer of the Les

bian, Gay and Bisexual Community Cen
ter, said, "We are pleased with the devel
opment of this fund. It sends the message
that being gay or lesbian is positive and a
good thing."
Andrew Lisac, assistant dean of Con
tinuing Studies and the summer session,
said the money could ease pressures on
students who are gay or lesbian. "Since I
have been at Stanford quite a few stu
dents have faced losing tuition money
from their parents because of their sexual
orientation," said Lisac, who is gay.
The scholarship is a way for the men to
give something to the community — the
Bay Area — that had given them freedom
to live openly gay, said Bill Brockett,
executor of the couple's estate.
The foundation stipulates that
applicants must be self-identified
as gay or lesbian and exhibit aca
demic potential and financial
need. Only juniors, seniors and
graduate students who have a
minimum grade point average of
2.5 can qualify, Barr said.
The funds of the scholarship
will be held and distributed
through the San Francisco State
University Foundation, Inc.
Whether the scholarship recip
ients will include bisexuals has
not yet been determined, he
added.
