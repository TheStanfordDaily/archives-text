## Stanford gymnasts snatch meet at San Jose St. 
### Noah Blake Staff writer 
Yes, this is a gymnastics story
at the the top of the sports page.
But, the fact is, the Stanford
men's gymnastics team is one of
the best teams on campus this
season.
The team was ranked fourth in
the country last week, and, after
beating second-ranked Ohio State
last Friday, should move up in the
polls.
And with last night's victory
over San Jose State and Michigan,
the Cardinal kept its season-long
undefeated streak alive.
Coach Sadao Hamada went
into last night's meet at San Jose
planning to rest his best gym
nasts, as Stanford had already
beaten the Spartans handily twice
this year. He had not expected
much from the Wolverines, yet at
the end of four events they led the
Cardinal by 1.3 points.
So Hamada shuffled the Cardi
nal lineup, putting in his top per
formers, and in the last two
events, parallel bars and high bar,
the Cardinal outscored the

Wolverines by 3.15 points to claim
the victory.
, "It's really great to be able to
have guys that can turn a meet
around like that," Hamada said.
"I've never had that luxury
before."
One of those guys is sophomore
Ail-American Jair Lynch, who last
night turned in two near perfect
performances. On both parallel
bars and high bar Lynch scored
9.9'5, in routines described as
"olympic quality."
But, Lynch's scores were not
the only high ones for the Cardi
nal last night. Freshman sensa
tion Marc Booth put up a 9.85 on
the floor exercise, and, in perfor
mances that Hamada called
"pleasantly suprising", Shawn
Adamek garnered a 9.65 on pom
mel horse, and Jeff Bender had an
identical score on rings.
Although a Stanford gymnast
won each individual event, the
Cardinal was stung in overall
team score by its old nemesis, the
vault. The only satisfying perfor
mance for Hamada on this event
was Marc Booth's 9.75.

"Our performance on vault has
been a little disappointing this
season," said Hamada. "It has just
been little things, like bending
knees , but right now my major
concern is vault. The guys do good
vaults in practice, but they are not
confident enough yet to perform
them well in meets. We will work
very hard on vaulting in the next
few weeks."
Hamada was satisfied with the
results, however, when Cardinal
gymnasts performed good rou
tines. "When the guys hit, we
obviously got the big scores that
we have been looking for."
This was certainly the case on
parallel bars, where the team
scored a season-high 47.15. In
addition to Lynch's 9.9, Booth,
Bender, and freshman Chris Sey
posted scores of 9.4, 9.35, and 9.2
respectively.
However, the meet was close
until high bar, where Stanford
asserted itself and Michigan fell
apart. "Every time I looked over,
they were falling off the bar,"
Hamada said. "But overall they
were pretty solid."
