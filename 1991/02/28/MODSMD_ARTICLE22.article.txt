# Do sports have anything to do with politics?

What I like about sports is how often
they reflect the world we live in.
What I hate about sports is how
often they reflect the world we live in.
No, what you just read was not a typo,
and no, it does not make sense. I find that
not much is making sense in the world of
sports these days. The topic of my column
last week — the intrusion of the Gulf War
into collegiate sports — was just the latest
example of a trend I've observed in my
morning sports pages for the past few
years.
See if any of these topics sound familiar:
arbitration, boycott, walkout, profit-shar
ing, death penalty, television deal, proba
tion, hold-outs, traffic violations, drug test
ing, Gulf War.
All those nasty words have nothing to do
with sports, with the spirit of competition.
They belong in the mouth of Dan Rather,
not Dick Vitale. These days, however, I'm
not so sure of that.
Sports are important to our society. Peo
ple care about them, sometimes much more
than they should. These same people who
are passionate about sports wish to know
everything they can about them. That is
why you are reading this column in a news
paper, which purportedly exists to relay
"news."
Is the score of a basketball game "news"
the way a Desert Storm body count is
"news?" Unfortunately, as sports and
sports journalism becomes more controver
sial and politicized, the obvious difference
between these two pieces of information
has been blurred, a situation which is
chiefly to blame for the merging of the two
issues.

The various explanations that are given

for the use of flags on uniforms and other
political expressions run from showing an
awareness of priorities to a fellow feeling
for combatants of similar age to support for
people whose lives are in danger. All presup
pose one thing: that sports must necessar
ily broach such subjects.
At least one participant in big-time col
lege sports sees such intertwining as
inevitable. "I think sports are always going
to be making political statements," said
Stanford basketball coach Tara Van-
Derveer. Recent history backs her up.
Few would argue with the fact that the
world has expanded and become much
more complex in the last 20 years. With the
rapid advances in communications, nothing
happens in isolation anymore. This issue is
a case in point.
As Cameron Macky pointed out in his
column two days ago, televison controls
much of college sports. TV means dollars,
which means schools like Stanford can pay
for more scholarships and equipment for
their teams. TV also means widespread
exposure, which means free advertising and
projection of a school's image.
In this light, wearing the flag on the uni
form only makes sense. Arizona was one of
the first teams to adopt the flag on the jer

sey. Guess which Pacific 10 Conference
team has by far the most national television
appearances this season? It makes for good,
smart public relations (and with the indi
rect costs controversy going on, Stanford
could use a little more of that).
Small wonder that the Athletic Depart
ment here was in such a hurry to get the
flags on the players' uniforms. Although
♦he initiative for the gesture was suppos
edly from the teams themselves, the pro
cess by which the flags actually made it on
the uniform reveals'a slightly different sit
uation.
According to Cardinal point guard John
Patrick, the team agreed to do something to
show their support, but differing views
about the war caused a debate about what
should be worn. Because of this, there was
some sentiment to wear the letters "S.T.T."
(Support The Troops) rather than the flag.
Apparently, Patrick and his teammates
were being a little presumptive. They were
asked whether or not they wanted to wear
an emblem, not what they wanted to wear.
That part had already been decided by the
Athletic Department and rest of the confer
ence and country.
"I thought we were going to have a slo
gan, but the AD just got the flags," Patrick
said. "We O.K.ed it, but the ultimate deci
sion was made by the athletic department."
Even in non-revenue (read "untele
vised") sports such as swimming, the teams
see it as prudent to wear the flag. The Car
dinal swimmers who go up on the victory
stand at Pac-lOs or NCAAs will be wearing
their special sweats with flags on them. If
nothing else, the logic reads, it will look
good in a newspaper.
Then there is the flip side. As another
Cardinal basketball expert, men's coach

Mike Montgomery, said, "I don't think ath
letics should be used as a forum. But we've
seen people wearing things, and our team
decided we need to do something. It's like
anything else: If you don't do it, you appear
to make a statement the other way."
With potential alumni donations swing
ing in the balance, clearly no one wants to
do that. It is pretty evident which way the
political winds are blowing these days.
Maybe I'm just naive, but the whole
thing bothers and saddens me. Beyond the
issues of free speech and pro-military state
ments is the whole mess that the sports
world seems to be in. Where does it start?
Maybe it's when grownups tiy to play a
kid's game. When I coached Little League
in Palo Alto two years ago, the biggest prob
lem that existed in the league was parents
that got too serious about the whole thing.
But there is hope. When I was a junior
and senior in high school, I used to forget
about life for a week during spring break
and take a vacation ... at the Seattle Coli
seum, where the state high school basket
ball tournaments were played.
I saw some great players at those tourna
ments, including Will Brantley (formerly of
Oregon State), Bill Elleby, Roy Fischer,
Ryan Drew (all currently of California), and
Stanford's Marcus Lollie and Peter Dukes.
Dukes seemed rather unconcerned about
the issue of flags on the uniforms last week.
He agreed that they were a good idea if
everyone was wearing them. "But, person
ally, I don't see that we have anything to do
with politics."
Neither do I, Peter. Amen.

not much is making sense in the world of
sports these days. The topic of my column
last week — the intrusion of the Gulf War
into collegiate sports — was just the latest
example of a trend I've observed in my
morning sports pages for the past few
years.
See if any of these topics sound familiar:
arbitration, boycott, walkout, profit-shar
ing, death penalty, television deal, proba
tion, hold-outs, traffic violations, drug test
ing, Gulf War.
All those nasty words have nothing to do
with sports, with the spirit of competition.
They belong in the mouth of Dan Rather,
not Dick Vitale. These days, however, I'm
not so sure of that.
Sports are important to our society. Peo
ple care about them, sometimes much more
than they should. These same people who
are passionate about sports wish to know
everything they can about them. That is
why you are reading this column in a news
paper, which purportedly exists to relay
"news."
Is the score of a basketball game "news"
the way a Desert Storm body count is
"news?" Unfortunately, as sports and
sports journalism becomes more controver
sial and politicized, the obvious difference
between these two pieces of information
has been blurred, a situation which is
chiefly to blame for the merging of the two
issues.

The various explanations that are given

for the use of flags on uniforms and other
political expressions run from showing an
awareness of priorities to a fellow feeling
for combatants of similar age to support for
people whose lives are in danger. All presup
pose one thing: that sports must necessar
ily broach such subjects.
At least one participant in big-time col
lege sports sees such intertwining as
inevitable. "I think sports are always going
to be making political statements," said
Stanford basketball coach Tara Van-
Derveer. Recent history backs her up.
Few would argue with the fact that the
world has expanded and become much
more complex in the last 20 years. With the
rapid advances in communications, nothing
happens in isolation anymore. This issue is
a case in point.
As Cameron Macky pointed out in his
column two days ago, televison controls
much of college sports. TV means dollars,
which means schools like Stanford can pay
for more scholarships and equipment for
their teams. TV also means widespread
exposure, which means free advertising and
projection of a school's image.
In this light, wearing the flag on the uni
form only makes sense. Arizona was one of
the first teams to adopt the flag on the jer

sey. Guess which Pacific 10 Conference
team has by far the most national television
appearances this season? It makes for good,
smart public relations (and with the indi
rect costs controversy going on, Stanford
could use a little more of that).
Small wonder that the Athletic Depart
ment here was in such a hurry to get the
flags on the players' uniforms. Although
♦he initiative for the gesture was suppos
edly from the teams themselves, the pro
cess by which the flags actually made it on
the uniform reveals'a slightly different sit
uation.
According to Cardinal point guard John
Patrick, the team agreed to do something to
show their support, but differing views
about the war caused a debate about what
should be worn. Because of this, there was
some sentiment to wear the letters "S.T.T."
(Support The Troops) rather than the flag.
Apparently, Patrick and his teammates
were being a little presumptive. They were
asked whether or not they wanted to wear
an emblem, not what they wanted to wear.
That part had already been decided by the
Athletic Department and rest of the confer
ence and country.
"I thought we were going to have a slo
gan, but the AD just got the flags," Patrick
said. "We O.K.ed it, but the ultimate deci
sion was made by the athletic department."
Even in non-revenue (read "untele
vised") sports such as swimming, the teams
see it as prudent to wear the flag. The Car
dinal swimmers who go up on the victory
stand at Pac-lOs or NCAAs will be wearing
their special sweats with flags on them. If
nothing else, the logic reads, it will look
good in a newspaper.
Then there is the flip side. As another
Cardinal basketball expert, men's coach

Mike Montgomery, said, "I don't think ath
letics should be used as a forum. But we've
seen people wearing things, and our team
decided we need to do something. It's like
anything else: If you don't do it, you appear
to make a statement the other way."
With potential alumni donations swing
ing in the balance, clearly no one wants to
do that. It is pretty evident which way the
political winds are blowing these days.
Maybe I'm just naive, but the whole
thing bothers and saddens me. Beyond the
issues of free speech and pro-military state
ments is the whole mess that the sports
world seems to be in. Where does it start?
Maybe it's when grownups tiy to play a
kid's game. When I coached Little League
in Palo Alto two years ago, the biggest prob
lem that existed in the league was parents
that got too serious about the whole thing.
But there is hope. When I was a junior
and senior in high school, I used to forget
about life for a week during spring break
and take a vacation ... at the Seattle Coli
seum, where the state high school basket
ball tournaments were played.
I saw some great players at those tourna
ments, including Will Brantley (formerly of
Oregon State), Bill Elleby, Roy Fischer,
Ryan Drew (all currently of California), and
Stanford's Marcus Lollie and Peter Dukes.
Dukes seemed rather unconcerned about
the issue of flags on the uniforms last week.
He agreed that they were a good idea if
everyone was wearing them. "But, person
ally, I don't see that we have anything to do
with politics."
Neither do I, Peter. Amen.
