# Cardinal catching Wooden
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
The NCAA Women's Tennis Champi
onships will be played at the Stanford Ten
nis Stadium between May 8 and 16. If you
have any doubts, you can look it up. At that
event, the top teams in the country will play
a single-elimination tournament to deter
mine the national champion.
Starting today in the Nielsen Tennis Sta
dium in Madison, Wis., a very similar tour
nament involving those very same top
teams gets underway Though winning the
tournament means nothing come May, the
champion at the National Team Indoors
can at least walk away knowing they tri
umphed over the best in an event that bears
a striking resemblences to NCAAs.
If that team should happen to be some
one other than Stanford, it can take its
place in history for it will have ended the
longest dual-match winning streak in col
lege tennis. The Cardinal (8-0 in 1991) has
won 73 straight in team competition dating
back to April 15, 1988.
When asked about the importance of
The Streak, Stanford coach Frank Brennan
tried to downplay it."I don't know how
meaningful it is to have 75 straight wins in
tennis," he said. Brennan went on to dis
cuss the 88-consecutive wins by John
Wooden's basketball teams — the next
milestone for the Cardinal women to
eclipse.
"We have the [record] for tennis," he
said. "That's what we do." The tone seemed
to indicate an everything-will-be-all-right
with-the-world attitude toward a potential
defeat, but Brennan isn't conceeding any
thing.
Last weekend's trip to Arizona and Ari
onza State seemed easy with the Cardinal
going a combined 15-1. Yet the coach talked
of how "[The Arizona schools] are tougher
proportionally than they've been in the
past.
"I don't get nervous if we have tough
matches," he continued. "I get nervous if
we don't have tough matches." Presumably
these more difficult challenges will have
prepared Stanford for the unforseen tests
that await — including some in this tourna
ment.

Fourth-ranked Georgia, the Cardinal's
likely semifinal opponent Saturday, is "a lit
tle bit of a question mark," according to
Brennan. Freshmen Laura Kimel and
Angela Lettiere, who Brennan calls "pretty
darn good," have been added to a team that
returns serve-and-volley star Shannan
McCarthy and baseline confounder Caryn
Moss.
Even if Stanford were to lose to the Bull
dogs, the team will get a shot at revenge
when Georgia visits in March. The same
can be said for Florida, the favorite to reach
the finals from the other side of the draw.
The Lady Gators have the edge over third
seed UCLA because the Bruins are without
Kim Po, one of their best players.
Stanford, however, is nearly at full
strength. Debbie Graham's shoulder injury
remains a concern. But if her blistering
serve is even at 90 percent power, it will be
deadly on the indoor courts.
While the Cardinal is not looking ahead,
tomorrow's match will probably pit Stan
ford against Oklahoma State, a traditional
rival in events like Team Indoors and
NCAAs.
