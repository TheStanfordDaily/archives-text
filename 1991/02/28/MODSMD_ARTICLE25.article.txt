# Bucko's memoirs

When most students
come to Stanford, they are
originally a little indimi
dated by the change and the
school's reputation. And
when they come in as fresh
men athletes on one of the
Farm's highly ranked teams,
the intimidation factor runs
even higher.
Suzy Buckovich was the
exception.
After her sophomore year
of high school, she tran
ferred to a larger school,
Germantown Academy, for
her last two years. So when
she came to Stanford as a
top swimming recruit two
years later, it was nothing
new.
"It made it a lot easier,"
she says. "First of all, I was
living away from home
already, so I had no problem
going clear across countiy....
School-wise I didn't have
much of a problem either.
Swimming here we don't
swim on Sundays and here we
only swim doubles (two-a-day
practices) three times I week,
so I almost want to say it was
easier."
That may be a slight
exaggeration, but success
has certainly followed Buck
ovich to Stanford. At
Germantown she led the
team to the mythical
national title in each of her
two years there and was
named the swimmer of the
meet at the prep school
equivalent of the NCAA
championships.
In her first three years of
competing at the real NCAA
championships, the senior
from Spring Grove, Penn.,
has also been quite impres
sive. As a freshman she
placed 10th in both the 100-
yard butterfly and the 200
individual medley and swam
on three relay squads.
As a sophomore, she
nabbed a sixth-place finish
in the 100 butterfly and
scored in the 100 freestyle
and three more relays. Last
year, she took sixth in the
100 freestyle, seventh in the
100 butterfly and 10th in
the 200 IM while swimming
on four relay teams.
And she expects to con
tinue to improve in her final
year at Stanford. She and
her teammates are at the
Pacific 10 Conference
