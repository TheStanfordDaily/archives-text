# Bucko's memoirs

### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
When most students
come to Stanford, they are
originally a little indimi
dated by the change and the
school's reputation. And
when they come in as fresh
men athletes on one of the
Farm's highly ranked teams,
the intimidation factor runs
even higher.
Suzy Buckovich was the
exception.
After her sophomore year
of high school, she tran
ferred to a larger school,
Germantown Academy, for
her last two years. So when
she came to Stanford as a
top swimming recruit two
years later, it was nothing
new.
"It made it a lot easier,"
she says. "First of all, I was
living away from home
already, so I had no problem
going clear across countiy....
School-wise I didn't have
much of a problem either.
Swimming here we don't
swim on Sundays and here we
only swim doubles (two-a-day
practices) three times I week,
so I almost want to say it was
easier."
That may be a slight
exaggeration, but success
has certainly followed Buck
ovich to Stanford. At
Germantown she led the
team to the mythical
national title in each of her
two years there and was
named the swimmer of the
meet at the prep school
equivalent of the NCAA
championships.
In her first three years of
competing at the real NCAA
championships, the senior
from Spring Grove, Penn.,
has also been quite impres
sive. As a freshman she
placed 10th in both the 100-
yard butterfly and the 200
individual medley and swam
on three relay squads.
As a sophomore, she
nabbed a sixth-place finish
in the 100 butterfly and
scored in the 100 freestyle
and three more relays. Last
year, she took sixth in the
100 freestyle, seventh in the
100 butterfly and 10th in
the 200 IM while swimming
on four relay teams.
And she expects to con
tinue to improve in her final
year at Stanford. She and
her teammates are at the
Pacific 10 Conference
Championships in Federal Way,
Wash., beginning today and run
ning through Saturday.
"I came here and I've been
improving each year," she says.
"Sometimes I wonder if I started
swimming earlier and doing dou
ble workouts earlier, if I'd be
burned out."
Not to say that Buckovich
wasn't serious before transfer
ring to Germantown; she was.
But it just wasn't the same. "I
sort of trained year around," she
says."I was more serious than

the rest of my team. To be on a
team where each meet you win
your events and everybody else
loses, it's not that fun."
But after switching schools,
she found things to be a lot dif
ferent. "I remember going there
and my eyes were opened," she
says. "They knew so much more
about swimming than I did and
thought about it more. . . .
"You go in there and every
one's good and you're scared. . . .
You just want to be as good as
they are. It's just like our team.
You come in and you think, 'Wow,
Stanford swim team. Everybody
must be good,' then you get bet
ter. ... I think when you have a
program with a lot of good people
around, it has to help you. Every

one swims faster."
And that's what has happened
to Buckovich. Training with the
likes of Jenna Johnson and Janel
Jorgensen, who have combined to
win five NCAA titles and four
Olympic medals — two golds and
two silvers, no less — swimming
the 100 freestyle and the 100 but
terfly, she has improved greatly.
But she isn't done yet. After
this weekend's Pac-10 meet, the
Cardinal will compete at the
NCAA championships in three
weeks. Current No. 1 Stanford
beat then-No. 1 Texas in a dual
meet three weeks ago, and that
gave the team confidence, as well
as a healthy dose of respect.
"The Texas meet was sort of a
foreshadowing ofNCAAs," Buck

ovich says."It showed us how
tough it would be and how much
of a challenge it would be. Every
body is going to have to pull
together and fight for every point.
It's going to be an intense three
days."
After that, Buckovich plans on
swimming through the Olympic
Trials, next spring. Because of
that she isn't overly sentimental
about her final collegiate meets,
but that isn't the only reason.
"I don't think about it being
my last NCAAs," she says. "I'm
not sad. I think it's because I
came in knowing I only had four
years. I could be sad, I guess, but
when I look back it's always
happy."
