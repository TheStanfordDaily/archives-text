# True diversity: All ages apply

### Peter Robison Staff writer 
David Geier is a sophomore planning to major
in electrical engineering. A transfer student from
Florida, he is taking the philosophy track of Cul
tures, Ideas and Values. And his explanation for
being here is a familiar one: "It's very far from
home, but this is the right place for me."
But Geier is unlike most other students in one
respect. He is 40 years old.
Geier is part of a very small minority at Stan
ford — undergraduates who fall outside the tradi
tional age group of college students. Of the enter
ing freshmen in fall quarter of 1989, 99.4 percent
were between the ages of 17 and 20.
But despite being outnumbered, many younger
and older students say their age has not been a
problem.
"I've gotten no reaction," Geier said. "[Other
students] find me just like any other student.
They've become accustomed to me, just as I've
become accustomed to them."
A native of South Florida, Geier graduated
from a Miami high school in 1968, before this
year's freshmen — and many upperclassmen —
were born. After high school he became an electri
cian.
A few years ago, though, Geier decided he
wanted to do something different. "I wanted to
change my career," he said.
So he went to a community college for two
years and then applied to Stanford.
He said he decided on Stanford because of its

diversity in its "variety of people
and its variety of classes."
Although he plans to major in
electrical engineering, Geier said
he "wanted to be with people tak
ing things other than science."
Geier lives in Crothers Memo
rial Hall, a graduate residence.
"It's no problem being 40 years
old and coming here," he said.
"There are no barriers because of
my age; I have friends, just like
anyone else."
The Office of Undergraduate
Admissions receives applications
from a wide range of ages every

year, said dean Jean Fetter. The
oldest applicant last year was 84
years old and the youngest 14,
although neither was admitted,
Fetter said.
However, besides Geier, a 36-
year-old, a 30-year-old and a 28-
year-old were admitted, she
added.
Another older student, Avi
Meyers, attended Stanford
between 1985 and 1988. After
spending a year at San Francisco
State University, he came here for
three years and completed an
bachelor's degree in international
relations and a graduate degree in
international policy studies.
Meyers, now 43, said he had
trouble blending in socially
because he was building a house,

raising two young children and
taking an average of 18 to 20 units
per quarter to graduate in three
years — all at the same time.
A native of Hightstown, N.J.,
Meyers graduated from high
school in 1966. He spent three
years as an officer in the Israeli
Army, and eventually moved to
Los Angeles, where he started a
real estate business.
He sold the business in 1984
and moved to Palo Alto with the
intention of applying to Stanford.
"I had always felt that I
cheated myself by not going to col
lege," Meyers said. "I was paying
back a debt to myself."
Overall, Meyers said he "would
highly recommend" the experi
ence of attending Stanford. "My

only regret is I didn't have more
time," he said. "It was a thor
oughly enlightening experience."
The Admissions Office is more
cautious about admitting younger
students than older ones, Fetter
said. "Typically, 14-year-olds are
not going to be socially ready to
live in the dorms," she said.
One 15-year-old girl, who was
admitted three years ago but
attended another college, received
a score of five on 12 different
Advanced Placement tests, Fetter
said. In that case, one of the girl's
high school teachers assured the
Admissions Office that she could
adjust to Stanford.
But her mother "didn't want
her to live in a [freshman] dorm,"
Fetter said. "The mother wanted

to move to Stanford with her."
The Admissions Office is
"unusually cautious about social
adjustment," although "there are
some academic talents that obvi
ously you cannot pass up," Fetter
aid.
Amy Rees, a 17-year-old sopho
more, said she had no difficulty
adapting socially last year.
Rees, who is from San Diego,
attended a boarding school in
Carmel and graduated at 16
because she started kindergarten
a half year early and skipped first
grade.
Skipping grades so early
helped, Rees said. "If you skipped
grades at a young age you don't
notice it as much" in social rela
tions, she added.
