# Women's Swimming at Pac-10s
## 
### 
WHAT — The Pac-10 Championships run today through Saturday at the
King County Aquatics Center in Federal Way, Wash. Prelims each morning
and finals each night. All Pac-10 teams except Oregon will be there.
RANKINGS — Stanford is No. 1 in the final college swimming poll. Cal is
third, USC is fifth, UCLA is sixth and Arizona State is 16th.
SWIMMING UPDATE — The events today are the 200 free relay, the 500
free, the 200 IM, the 50 free and the 400 medley relay. Freshman
freestyler/backstroker Mary Edwards will make her collegiate debut with
the Cardinal after overcoming tendinitis and bursitis in both shoulders.
Stanford has won all four previous Pac-10 titles by large margins and
this year's shouldn't be too different, although Cal should finish a very
respectable second.
DIVING UPDATE — One-meter is today, three-meter tomorrow and platform
Saturday in Pasadena, Calif. In Pac-10 dual meets, only ASU's Janae
Lautenschlager (twice) and Stanford's Melisa Kuller (once) have beaten
Cardinal freshman Eileen Richetelli this year, making her a big favorite.
Kuller, who broke her right pinkie finger a couple of weeks ago, has her
cast off and will compete.
