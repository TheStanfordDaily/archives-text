# INTERMISSION
## THE 						STANFORD DAILY'S COMFORTING WEEKLY Talking 'bout my generation 
### 
NO ONE DOES ANYTHING
shocking anymore. Nothing
outrageous. Nothing really
crazy. Except for when Mondale decided
to run for president, and even that
seemed kind of reasonable at the time.
I mean, there I was, at 3 a.m., sitting
in front of a red light on El Camino.
There were no other cars in sight, and
definitely no cops. But I was too soft, too
wet, too flaccid, if you will, to lay rubber.

i
It wasn't like I had moral problems
with the whole situation. I don't even
have moral problems with law school.
I know you — you're just like me;
you're a complete wimp. You want to
walk out of boring lectures, but you
don't. You want to ask someone on a
date, but you don't.
So why are you so restrained? Why
aren't people having sex in the back of
my mechanical engineering class? Why
aren't people riding up to other bike rid
ers and pushing them — really hard?
I walk through White Plaza and I feel
like a sheep. A really big sheep with a
close shave and a wicked tan, but a sheep
nonetheless.
So why are we so namby-pamby, so
mollusk-like, such panty-waists (Roget
159.6)? This is one of those questions I
ask myself at 3 a.m. The other one is,
"Wh/d they cancel that Brady reunion
show?" That new Cindy was so hot.
At 3 a.m., I attempt to answer these
questions. I answer the second one first,
because it's easier. Every night I reach the
same conclusions: 1) The sexual tension
between Mr. & Mrs. Brady just didn't
work any more, 2) Martha Quinn.
But the question still remains. Why
doesn't anyone do anything shocking?
Why can't we paint our damn trailers?
So I got determined. I got incensed. I
almost used a fighting word. So I did
what I always do — I made a list.
• Create my own major. It seemed
like a great place to start. Everyone talks
about it, but no one does it. And it
would be great: Gender and Racial Dif
ferences in Ecological Perspective.
• Study under Psycho Fan. I would
pledge my existence to this imitation-
Marv Albert guru.
But even that wouldn't shock this
generation. The generation that saw
their beloved Julie go to rehab, while
Gopher went to Congress.
I had to think of something and fast.
The bikes were closing in on me. And
these guys were shoving green Bibles in
my face and telling me masturbating
would lower my grade point average.
Needless to say, I was getting antsy.
But not shocked. My generation
doesn't get shocked.
Our parents look at us and shake
their heads. Not because we do drugs.
After all, they did that. Not because we
listen to that crazy rock music. They did
that too. And it's not because we have
sex. We don't.
No, our parents complain that our
generation is apathetic.
Whether we vote this guy in, or that
guy, we can't see the difference. It's all
dissociated from us like some post-mod
ern MTV dip.
We want to be grabbed by the scruffs
of our necks and woken up. The atroci
ties of life, the homelessness, rapes and
wars have become uncontrollable — yet
too mundane to shock us anymore.
So let our parents work for the
American Dream.
In the meantime, I'll just follow the
sheep in White Plaza and apply to con
sulting firms like everyone else. But deep
inside I'll hope that someone with guts
comes along and does what he really
feels like doing — even though it won't
make one bit of difference to the rest of
the world.
In the meantime, while I'm waiting,
maybe the new Cindy will give me a call.

Joel Stein, unlike punster Chris Harris,
thinks that the highest form of humor is
the arcane, esoteric reference.
