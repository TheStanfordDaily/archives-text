# NECESSITIES

### Mara Winokur 
When things aren't going well, when my life seems like
it's falling apart, I don't go to my parents, to my friends or
even to the Bridge.
I go to my teddy bear.
Timmy is white, furry and under a foot tall, but that
doesn't stop him from being a great listener, especially for a
two-year-old. True, he doesn't always have an answer for
me, but he always has a hug.
And he's always there — right on my bed, where I left
him.
OK, so Timmy doesn't solve all my problems. That
would be impossible.
But I have eight other bears who are just as willing to
help.

You think I'm crazy, don't you? You're reading this and

saying to yourself, "She's absolutely bonkers.

Must be the stress of college."

Nope. I've

been this way — since I
got my first bear at age six. (Her name is
Koala, and yes, I still have her.)
And I have news for you. Many — if not most — of the
people you surround yourself with every day are the same.
Bear lovers. Serious bear lovers.
And why not?
Bears are more than a childhood toy, more than a cute
thing to indulge in.
Teddy bears are cultural icons.
Most of the first toys we get as children are stuffed ani
mals. And most of these are bears. As infants, we chew them,
throw them and throw up on them. But, unlike our parents,
they never get mad at us.
Consciously or not, we learn this: teddy bears don't com
plain. We can beat them, smother them or ignore them, and
they'll still be there for us. Always.

It is said that it's a very old, basic,
human need to have someone wait
ing up for you when you come
home at night. Perhaps you don't
miss your parents and their cur
, fews, but it's still nice to know
\ someone's there. Someone who

cares.
Teddy fits the bill.
When you're up all night writ-

ing papers, and all your friends,
relatives and enemies (and
every other sane person in the
world) are asleep, Teddy pulls
\ through.

When you've broken up
with your significant other,
and all your friends can say
is, "You're better off," Teddy
I gives you the support you

really need.
And admit it, you never would have fallen
asleep after most of those horror movies if
it hadn't been for your bear.
Teddy never lets you down.
Ever.
For those of you who think this is just a
personal thing of mine, think again. I can
list the names of a least a dozen friends
who, if their wordly possessions were
burning to the ground, would waste no
time saving their bears.
Like my freshman roommate, who was
told by her mother that it "was time to get
rid of that bear thing, dear." Emily didn't
talk to her mom for a week, but she talked
to her bear every night.

Or the girl I knew who would not go
on her honeymoon unless Theodore
went along. "After all," she explained,
"why shouldn't he get to go on vacation
too? He deserves it."
I know people who have literally
threatened the lives of those who have
threatened their bears. Like me.
And this isn't a single-sex phe-

nomenon, either. Ask some of your
male friends. It may take some prod
ding, but chances are you'll find there's
a bear in their past — and probably in
their present as well.
Take Alex, my friend from high

school.
Alex got a bear when he was three years old. He loved it.
Everywhere that Alex went, the bear went. (The bear's name,
incidently, was Bear; Alex has always been very practical.)
When Alex reached school-age, he took Bear with him.
Bear had a lot of fun; he played with blocks and finger paints
and he learned how to write. He also met some other bears.
Eventually, Alex reached high school and was embar
rassed to have Bear around anymore. Alex entered a new
phase of life; Bear entered the closet.
But a funny thing happened when Alex left for college —
he took Bear with him. "I don't know why exactly," he says,
"but Bear had always been near me, and I couldn't leave him
home alone."
Bear was pretty psyched to be going to college, and he can
always be found on Alex's bed, enjoying the scenery.
And Alex isn't alone.
A guy in my dorm has a tattered bear named 8080. He
took him along to college, but doesn't sleep with him any
more — because his (male) roommate does.
Good ol' Teddy.
