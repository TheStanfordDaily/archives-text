It's raining, it's pouring, the old man is. ... Who needs an entertain
ment section when you can just pull on galoshes, run outside and jump
in puddles?
Okay, well it worked for us.
If it doesn't work for you, however, you can try this:
Run down to the nearest bookstore (or the farthest bookstore, what
ever).
Bypass the self-help books (they'll just make you feel pathetic); bypass
the bestsellers; bypass the travel section. Head straight to the children's
books.
Pick up a copy of "Winnie-the-Pooh."
Yes, I know Christopher Robin, it's actually "Winnie-ther-Pooh," I'll be
sure to pronounce it correctly from now on.
Possibly the most clever children's book ever written, Pooh and Roo
and Tigger too, will cheer you up and help you remember what it was like
to fall asleep in the back of the car when it was raining out and Mommy
and Daddy were in the front seat taking care of everything.
Nothing like a little childhood regression to cheer you up.
But if you're just not the juvenile type, we have another option to offer
you.
What do you normally do at noon? Eat lunch, right?
Well next time it's raining out or you just need to get away and treat
yourself, head over to the movie theater to catch a noon showing.
Matinees only cost $3.75 (at Century 10 anyway); you can have pop
corn for lunch and then come home feelin' sneaky cause you were giggling
and eating Goobers while your friends were pretending to study and
thinking about exercising.
Feeling cheery already?
Good.
Then you're ready to run out and take advantage of all the great tunes
being played in the Bay Area this week.
Strains of jazz will echo through the Foothills this weekend as Dizzy
Gillespie, the legendary (and we mean legendary) trumpeter, performs at
the Mountain View Center for Performing Arts on Sunday, and the Stan
ford Jazz Band presents a tribute to Duke Ellington in Dinkelspiel on Sat
urday.
Also on Saturday, Clarence Clemons (sucks to be you if you've never
heard this saxophonist jam) plays at Slim's in the City at 9 p.m.
In the more classical vein, the Stanford Symphony Orchestra will be
performing on Friday and Sunday in Dinkelspiel. The concert will feature
pianist Jon Nakamatsu, a senior who's won soloist competitions in the Bay
Area.
One performance this week deals with a world completely devoid of
music — and sound.
Bernard Bragg, a deaf actor, will perform in Kresge tomorrow. We've
heard great things about his humorous anecdotes and mimery, and the
subject matter sounds fascinating (looks fascinating might be more appro
priate).
Bragg, an acclaimed actor, director, playwright and lecturer who grew
up in a deaf household, will tell the story of his life through anecdotes,
mime sketches and impersonations at 8 p.m. tomorrow.
One last piece of Intermission advice:
Add a little culture to your lives: on Tuesday, head over to the Printer's
Inc. Bookstore in Palo Alto to hear Mary Gaitskill Band, author of "Two
Girls, Fat and Thin," read from her recent novel.
And have a cafe mocha while you're there.
That's all for now, folks, (subliminal message: Happy Birthday Mara)
And remember, in the words of Latin American Studies Prof. Steve
Haber, "Happiness is just a state of electrical and chemical balance in the
brain."
Be happy. No matter what it takes,
