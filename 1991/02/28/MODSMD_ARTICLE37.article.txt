What is Alea (a-lay-uh) II? A
sequel to the movie "Alea I"?
A new laundry detergent?
Perhaps a new brand of running shoes?
Nope. None of the above.
Alea II is the little-known new music
group at Stanford which, in addition to
providing a forum for new music
("new" meaning 20th century, especially
late 20th century), performs graduate
student compositions and provides an
opportunity for members of the Stan
ford community to learn music in a
mixed group of their peers, semi-profes
sionals and professional musicians.
Noted for its unconventional performances, Alea II will
give its quarterly concert Tuesday, March 5, at 8 p.m. in
Campbell Recital Hall. The performance will feature works
by Witold Lutoslawski, a well-known modern Polish com
poser, and Jody Rockmaker, the group's director. Rumor has
it that Lutoslawski himself may drop in for the concert.
Rockmaker took time out this week to talk to Intermis
sion (although we couldn't get in touch with Lutoslawski)
and tell us just what's going on with Alea II and new music
at Stanford.
Intermission: OK. First thing's first. Why is the group
called Alea II? What happened to Alea I? Are there other
Aleas?
Rockmaker: Don't blame me for the name. The group was
named by Theodore Antinou in the 19705; he founded it
when he was a lecturer here. I guess he had begun Alea I at
his first university, and so the Stanford group became Alea
11. There is an Alea 111 in Boston; however, they are a pro
fessional new music ensemble. Our goal is not to become a
professional group but to provide a learning environment
and provide Stanford with new music.
I: Who comprises the group?
R: Well, somewhat unfortunately, this is perhaps the least
sought-after group by students, especially undergraduates.
However, undergraduates, graduate students and even peo
ple from the Medical School are active in Alea 11.
What we play is very dependent upon who we can round
up each quarter. Last quarter we had a piece for nine play

ers, and that was a pretty ambitious step for us. The group
size seems to hover at about 15, but the participants vary
from quarter to quarter.
I: Why do you think response has been so low?
R: Well, first of all, there are other groups with much higher
profiles — it's hard to compete with an orchestra that tours
Asia and plays big flashy pieces. Who wants to play in a
group that's just going to sit here when they can go on tour?
Second of all, 20th century music has a bad reputation
and when people hear the phrase "20th century music,*'
they automatically think of some bad piece of modern
music they've heard and so they shy away. Hopefully our
concerts can do something to remedy this bad name that
new music has gotten.

Third, the Music Department here does not really
emphasize new music, even within the department, let
alone to the campus at large. It's a matter of knocking down
those preconceived notions of what the music will be like
and showing people that there's actually a lot of great music,
fun music, strange music, written in the 20th century.
I: How's attendance at Alea II concerts?
R: Over the last couple years it's been rising — the last con
cert we gave we had a full house. That's refreshing. People
are starting to realize that our concerts provide a spectrum
of new music and there is probably something for everyone.
Last year we had a piece which required members of the
audience to blow into plastic bottles to make sound effects
for this large percussion piece. It was a lot of fun and people

Last year we had a piece
which required members of
the audience to blow into
plastic bottles to make
sound effects for this large
percussion piece. It was a
lot of fun and people really
got into it. It was a whole
new sensation for people
who had only been to 'tradi
tional' music concerts.

really got into it. It was a whole new sensation for people
who had only been to "traditional" music concerts.
I: Can you give us a preview of the upcoming concert?
R: We're presenting a piece for violin and piano by
Lutoslawski. Two of our Polish graduate students — who
actually know Lutoslawski personally — are going to per
form that work. Lutoslawski will be in the area next week
conducting a piece for the San Francisco Symphony, so
maybe he will pay us a visit. We will also present a piece by
George Perle, a Pulitzer Prize-winning composer who is
currently the composer-in-residence at San Francisco Sym
phony.
We will also perform a piece that I composed, called
"Quarter for Twelve." It's a piece for flute, oboe, bass clar
inet, clarinet in B-flat, bassoon, French horn, xylophone,
vibraphone, two violins, viola, cello and bass. As you can
see, we present a wide variety of pieces.
I: You're from New York — so were you surprised with the
attitudes toward 20th century music out here?
R: I was surprised at the amount of conservative thinking
— even within the department there are people who don't
think 20th century music is worth it. It's shocking. How can
you say that? It's almost like pulling teeth at times. Some
times I feel very alone in promoting this type of music.
Hopefully, through our concerts, we can show people that
new music can be fun, strange, weird and even beautiful.
