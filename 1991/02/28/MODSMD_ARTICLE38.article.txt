Stupid slapstick
misses its mark
"King Ralph," starring John
Goodman.
The prospect of sitting through 90
minutes of John Goodman's blue-col
lar schtick is about as appealing as
watching Roseanne Barr posing in the
mud for "Vanity Fair."
At least Barr managed to be funny.
Goodman's first starring role as
"King Ralph" will do little for his
career — he lacks the charisma needed
to carry a whole film by himself; he's
much better off playing second banana
to another performer. Indeed, Good
man was quite memorable in bit roles
such as the exterminator in "Arachno
phobia" and A 1 Pacino's buddy in "Sea
of Love."
The one-joke storyline of "King
Ralph" is simplistic enough for even
the most dim-witted moviegoer.
A freak accident wipes out the
entire royal family, leaving only one
heir to the throne: an American sleaze
who seems to have been brought up by
Neanderthals. Goodman, as the heir,
slugs his way into Buckingham Palace,
sunglasses and baseball hat placed
stolidly on his head.
He spouts redneck lingo to the
Proper English People ("Hey, man,
wuz goin' ON!"), but is not even
remotely funny.
A comedy of manners (such as this
film tries desperately to be) should be
subtle and somewhat grounded in
reality for the humor to work. But the
sledgehammer mentality of "King
Ralph" won't inspire giggles in a sec
ond grader. The sight gags misfire
because they aren't even slightly con
vincing in any of the given situations.
We get to see John Goodman, dressed
up in royal clothing, installing pinball
machines in his bedroom and playing
cricket as if it were some higher form
of baseball.
Does this sound funny? If you think
so, you deserve to sit through 90 min
utes of it.
Using the differences between
American and British customs as a
basis for slapstick comedy was a
promising idea, but this film is too
dumb to even notice the lost potential.

Instead, "King Ralph" lurches
gracelessly from one failed gag to
another, frequently detouring into a
sentimental love story. This subplot,
involving Ralph's relationship with a
showgirl from the wrong side of the
tracks, is played strictly for drama. The
result is unbearably dull, ruining any
spark of comic timing the filmmakers
might have stumbled upon.
Two dignified British actors, Peter
O'Toole and John Hurt, inexplicably
stoop to participating in this film.
O'Toole plays King Ralph's mentor
(similar to the John Geilgud character
in "Arthur"), while Hurt is a corrupt
member of the King's entourage. With
their offhand elegance and lecherous
pronunciation of certain words, they
lend a little humor to the crude pro
ceedings.
But even they don't save this banal
film.

Woody mocks
L.A. lifestyle
"Scenes From a Mall," starring
Woody Allen and Bette Midler.
Nick Fifer, one of the two main
characters in the delightful new com
edy "Scenes From a Mall," is a South
ern Californian who wears his hair in a
ponytail.
That may not shock anyone until
they learn that Fifer is played by
Woody Allen, the always bespectacled,
sometimes brilliant director who
makes movies set in and around New
York City, with Mia Farrow playing the
female lead.
Fifer, though, is a Southern Califor
nia sports agent whose successful psy
chiatrist wife, Deborah, is played by
the Divine Miss M.
That's not M as in Mia, but as in
Midler — Bette Midler. She and Allen
are improbably paired by director Paul
Mazursky to celebrate the Fifers' 16th
wedding anniversary.
The couple, with their his-and-her
Saabs, his-and-her cordless phones
and even his-and-her beepers, choose

to share the joy and happiness their
union has brought them in, of all
places, an upscale shopping mall.
Things begin innocently enough
when the two take each other to the
stores where their respective gifts are
located. After Nick receives his person
alized surfboard and Deborah takes
possession of her antique picture
frame complete with family portrait,
Nick drops the bombshell — he had an
affair.
Stunned, Deborah somehow man
ages to ask when it ended.
"Yesterday,"he answers, "at 4:30."
From there, the movie takes off on
a long, twisted road of divorce plans,
division of marital assets, eating and
shopping. It makes no sense and yet
never fails to entertain. Eventually
Nick convinces Deborah to forgive
him, after an hysterical love scene in a

movie theater, and she admits she too
has been unfaithful. (Her lover is none
another than Mazursky, who appears
in a Hitchcockian cameo at a book
store where Deborah's new bestseller
"I Do I Do I Do" is being hawked.)
"Scenes From a Mall" is an 87-
minute emotional roller coaster ride
with a lot of Allenesque humor. If
"Alice" worked for you, this one
should as well. The chemistry between
Midler and Allen develops quite nicely
— the affair revelation serves as the
catalyst for a farcical chain reaction.
While the script has some holes, the
overall package is funny— sometimes
hysterical — and charming. One final
note: The barbershop quartet serves as
a funny aside, the rap group is
mediocre and you will want to kill the
mime.

He said...
"He Said, She Said," starring
Kevin Bacon and Elizabeth
Perkins.
I bet the makers of "He Said, She
Said" really thought they were on to
something when they decided to tell a
love story from both the man's and the
woman's perspectives.
Sure, it's a clever idea. But it's more
of a gimmick than an expressive way of
describing a romance.
"He Said" is the first half of the
movie, and it focuses on Kevin Bacon's
side of the story. Bacon meets Eliza
beth Perkins, whom he sees as illogical,
fussy and hormonally deranged.
So how and why did he fall in love
with her in the first place?
Well, you're not supposed to won
der about this. Instead, you're sup
posed to laugh. But watching Bacon
and Perkins quibble over every little
thing isn't funny — it's contrived and
irritating.
"She Said" is the second half of the
movie, and in it we get to hear the
female character's point of view. Basi
cally, Perkins bitches about Bacon's
insensitivity and lack of commitment
Zzzzzzzz.
Essentially, "He Said, She Said" is
two one-hour movies shown back-to
back. The story is told twice, and
scenes are shown over again with
barely noticeable changes. While see
ing the romance from tw6 different
perspectives should have been
provocative and enlightening, it was,
instead, boring.
And as if the movie weren't bad
enough, I was stuck watching it with
an irritating companion, Mara
Winokur (see accompanying review).
To begin with, Winokur chomped
her way through the"He Said" seg
ment, wolfing down two hot dogs,
three cookies and a large Coke (no, it
wasn't Diet). Then she has the nerve to
ask me what's going on in the movie.
Well, honey, if you weren't so busy
feeding your face with a predominant
part of the concession stand, you'd
know that Bacon and Perkins just had
another falling out.
Women are scum.... at least when
they're at the movies.

in The Daily" Kostich

She said...
Men are scum.
Men are spineless, insensitive,
messy, shallow, sexually obsessed,
stupid jerks who don't care who they
hurt, as long as they get to sleep
around with beautiful women.
Dumb, beautiful women.
I know this — heck, everyone
knows this — so why did some couple
decide to make a movie about it?
And why didn't they do a good job?
I mean, I figured after seeing "He
Said, She Said," I'd leave the theater
with a reinforced view of what com
plete losers men are, and a determina
tion to remain single for the rest of my
life.
But I didn't.
Or almost didn't.
The movie itself did nothing to
convince me of the worthlessness of
men; instead it made me think that
perhaps women were the real losers —
whining and bitching, even when
things were fine.
Elizabeth Perkins certainly did
enough of that. She meets Bacon, he
falls in love with her, he drops all other
women — without provocation — for
her (nothing like fantasy in Holly
wood) and he devotes his life to her.
All I could think was, "What on
Earth is she complaining about?"
And I probably would have
changed my view about men com
pletely, had it not been for my ever-so
courteous movie companion, Alex
Kostich (see accompanying review).
Men are scum.
First, he makes me drive on to cam
pus to pick him up, even though I live
right near Highway 101 and he has his
own car.
I could have forgiven him for that.
Next, he points out all the things
that are wrong with me, my car, my
writing and my life in general. Sorry
my car wasn't clean enough, Kostich.
Had I known I was going to be chauf
feuring such royalty around I would
have cleaned it.
I could have forgiven him for that
too.
But then he decides to point out
every woman that walks by, complete
with comments like, "Don't you wish
you looked like that?" and "Boy, I wish
I were with her."
So did I, Kostich, so did I.
