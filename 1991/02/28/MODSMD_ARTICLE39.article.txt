The Promised Land:
The Great Black Migration
and How It Changed America
Nicholas Lemann
Alfred A. Knopf,
416 pages, $24.95
Nicholas Lemann's book is
an important study of a subject
that until now has received little
scholarly attention — the
migration, over the last 50 years,
of blacks from the rural South
to the industrial North.
Lemann traces the life of
Ruby Daniels, a black woman
from the Mississippi Delta,
through her migration north
and back to the South, while
depicting the goings-on in the
nation's capital — goings-on
which affected Daniels and oth
ers like her.
"The Promised Land" points
out that although the cities of
the North are often viewed as an
escape from the poor living and
working conditions in the
South, black migrants fre
quently become caught up in a
cycle of violence and poverty in
ghettos.
The Autobiography
of Malcolm X
Alex Haley
Ballantine Books,
460 pages, $5.95
Malcolm X was not a man
who inspired neutral feelings.
Some revered him, some feared
him; everyone paid attention.
The story of his life, as told to
Alex Haley, is a fascinating and
illuminating look at one of this
century's most influential lead
ers.
Haley, best known for his
epic "Roots," writes clearly and
captures the philosophy and
emotions of Malcolm X. The
book provides insight into a
volatile and often confusing
period in American history.
We Are Not Afraid
Seth Cagin and Philip Dray
Bantam Books,
457 pages, $14.95
This compelling book tells
the story of James Chaney,
Andrew Goodman and Michael
Schwerner, the three civil rights
workers who were murdered in
Mississippi by Ku Klux Klan
members.
The three — two white and
one black— were attempting to
register voters. Their murders,
and the cover-ups that followed,
sparked a national controversy.
Seth Cagin and Philip Dray
delve into FBI and police
records, as well as individual
testimony, to reconstruct what
actually happened to the three
men. Their treatment of the
social and political context in
which the murders took place is
thoughtful and helpful.
The Content of Our Character
Shelby Steele
St. Martin's Press,
175 pages, $15.95
This award-winning collec
tion of essays has made Shelby
Steele a household name. "The
Content of Our Character" is a
controversial assessment of the
state of black Americans today.
Well-written but flawed
arguments characterize this
book. Most noted has been
Steele's opposition to affirma
tive action, for which he has
drawn criticism from the black
community of the United States
