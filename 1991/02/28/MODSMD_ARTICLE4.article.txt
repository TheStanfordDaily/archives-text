# War's end brings relief
## 
### Mike Laris Editorial staff 
Campus reaction to Bush's announce
ment last night that the Gulf war "is now
behind us" ranged from joy to anger to
relief.
Minutes after the allies stopped offen
sive military action at 9 p.m. PST, Anne
Marie Krogh watched jubilant Kuwaitis on
a dormitory television.
"I'm reveling in it," said Krogh, an
employee at the Department of Athletics
and a 1989 graduate.
"It's a pretty emotional thing seeing
these people who have their freedom," she
said.
Students with family members in the
Gulf voiced relief.
For example, fresh lan Catrice Monson,
whose two cousins are serving in the Gulf,

said she is "very happy" even though she
has not heard from them.
The older of her cousins is in an army
unit responsible for carrying dead soldiers
from the battlefield.
"I don't know how much he really did
because we never had to get to the point
where there were tons and tons of bodies to
carry out," she said.
Monson said she will appreciate her fam
ily more in the future, especially her
cousins. "I ... really appreciate the fact
they made it through," she added.
Campus activists say they are grateful
for the chance to live without their harried
wartime pace but also say their work is not
over.
"I hope I will be able to get some rest,"
said Assoc. History Prof. Joel Beinin, who
seemed battle weary after yester
day's announcement. "I have
been running around quite a bit
trying to talk to people about
this," he said.
"It's a good thing people are no
longer being killed. It was all
pretty horrific and unnecessary."
For other anti-war activists,
even though the fighting has
stopped, die-ins live on.
Protesters plan to sprawl out
today in White Plaza to symbolize
Iraqi civilian deaths.
"The cease fire won't affect it,
but if there is really prohibitive
weather, it may be postponed
until next week," said David
Kazanjian, a 1989 graduate and a
member of Stanford Students
Against the War in the Middle
East, which is organizing the
demonstration.
Eric Krock, a senior and an
active member of Students for
America, a group which sup
ported the war, said although
campus debate has been a chal
lenge, he agrees with Beinin that
he needs some rest.
"I'm ready for a break. Per
haps now we can go back to com
plaining about the . . . yell lead
ers," he said.
"There are only so many con
servatives on this campus to go
around. I'm tired of . . . going
around explaining the allied posi
tion," he said.
Beinin, however, said peace
and stability in the region have
not been achieved, and senior

There are only so
many conservatives
on this campus to go
around. I'm tired of
explaining the allied
position.'

Erin Clune, a member of Stu
dents for Peace, does not believe
her work is done.
Bush may be "hell-bent on get
ting to Baghdad," she said. "I'm
not sure he's going to stop."
One Navy ROTC member, Jeff
Neal, said the end to fighting will
not allow him to take his mind off
the region.
"I don't really know if (life) will
be that different just yet," he said.
His concern about the Gulf will
not immediately decrease because
the region's future is uncertain
and there is an enormous amount
to learn from the battles that
have just ended, he added.
"There is a propensity for con
flict to arise in a cease-fire situa
tion," he said.
For some, life has already
drifted back to normal. Political
Science Prof. Scott Sagan, who
many say has been an important
analyst of the Gulf conflict, is one
example.
Asked to analyze the implica
tions of the end of hostilities,
Sagan, with a screaming baby
audible in the background, said,
"As you can hear, I'm working out
a cease-fire with my one year old
son, so you'll have to call someone
else."
