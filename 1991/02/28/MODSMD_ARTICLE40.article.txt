Despite popular belief, Toni Morri
son and Alice Walker aren't the only
great African-American writers
around today.
Terry McMillan makes this very
clear with her latest publication — a
new anthology of black literature titled
"Breaking Ice: An Anthology of Con
temporary African-American Fiction."
In what she calls the "first original
anthology of African-American writ
ing in over a decade," McMillan has
collected a group of 57 diverse voices.
Contributors include known African-
American greats such as Alice Walker
("The Color Purple") and Amiri
Baraka ("The Dutchman"), as well as
previously unpublished writers such as
Marita Golden ("A Woman's Place")
and Xam Wilson Carter ("Be-Bop,
Re-Bop").
Many of the pieces are not short
stories, but rather excerpts from novels
such as Gloria Naylor's "Mama Day"
and Ishmael Reed's "The Terrible
Threes." The excerpts are wisely cho
sen pieces which give readers a full
sense of the story and whet their
appetites for more.
With such a myriad of authors,
even picky readers can surely find a
story to fit their mood. McMillan
writes, "Some [of the stories] are
warmhearted, some zingy, some have a
sting and a bite, some will break your

heart, or cause you to laugh out loud,
sit back and remember, or think
ahead."
Some of the highlights of the
anthology come from well-established
writers like Toni Cade Bambara with
her story "My Man Bovanne."
Told in honestly rendered dialect,
"My Man Bovanne" is a tale about a
middle-aged woman, Miss Hazel, who
dances with blind Bovanne, to the cha
grin of her adult children, at a fund
raiser for a black power organization.
Gloria Naylor's excerpt from
"Mama Day" treats us to a rare
glimpse at a contemporary love story
of two young 'Buppies' The story told
by the lovers to each other in the sec
ond person presents black characters
— Cocoa and George — with exquisite
social smarts about the hazards of dat
ing and job-hunting.
Besides the well-written contribu
tions by the big name authors, other
notable contributions include Stan
ford University graduate Trey Ellis'
"Platitudes" and Randall Kenan's "A
Visitation of Spirits."
As a whole, the anthology is a won
derful introduction to the African-
American literature from 1970 to the
present. But perhaps more impor
tantly, as McMillan writes, "We are
capturing and making permanent and
indelible, reactions to, and impres
sions of, our most intimate observa
tions, dreams, and nightmares, experi
ences and feelings about what it felt
like for 'us' to be African-Americans
from the seventies until now — the
nineties."
