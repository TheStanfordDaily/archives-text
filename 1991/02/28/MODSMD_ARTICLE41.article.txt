# Afro-American essentials that everyone should read

### Heidi Durrow 
Since black fiction is not segregated from
other literature in most bookstores, it's some
times hard to find books by black authors easily.
The folks at Meyer Library have tried to give
people some clue of what to look for with a Black
Liberation Month display of African-American
literature inside the front lobby. But if you want
more of a clue, here's a list of some favorites, past
and present:
Song of Solomon, by Toni Morrison. This
1977 award-winning novel tops the favorite list. A
suspenseful, fictional mystery, the story follows
young Milkman Dead through a journey to dis
cover his family's roots. Other books by Morrison

include Sula, Tar Baby, The Bluest Eye and
Beloved, which won a Pulitzer Prize.
The Color Purple, by Alice Walker. Walker's
Pulitzer Prize-winning novel is definitely better
than the movie. Read it to find out who the real
Mr. is. Other good Walker reads include
her first collection of short stories, In Love and
Trouble, and her poetry collection, Good Night
Willie Lee, I'll See You in the Morning In Search
of Our Mothers' Gardens. In this collection,
Walker discusses everything from civil rights to
the writing of The Color Purple.
Invisible Man, by Ralph Ellison. One simply
cannot be a well-versed student of African-Amer
ican literature without reading Ellison's classic
about a young black man struggling to define his

identity in an oppressive white society.
Native Son, Richard Wright. This is another
classic of African-American literature. Wright
recounts the story of Bigger Thomas who kills a
wealthy white businessman's daughter acciden
tally, but in the end partially lives up to the image
of the Negro Beast which society has told him he
is.
Go Tell It On the Mountain, James Baldwin.
Baldwin's semi-autobiographical account of a
young man's coming of age in the church mes
merizes with its lyrical prose.
Baldwin's other works include an excellent
collection of short stories tided Going To Meet
the Man as well as novels such as Giovanni's
Room. An excellent essayist as well, Notes of a

Native Son is a meaningful commentary on the
state of blacks in America.
Their Eyes Were Watching God, Zora Neale
Hurston. Hurston, the literary foremother of
recent black women writers, captures the humor
and the essence of life in a Southern black com
munity in this, her finest novel.
Hurston, also a renowned folklorist, wrote
other exemplary books including Jonah's Gourd
Vine, Mules and Men and an autobiography,
Dust Tracks On a Road Gorilla. My Love, by
Toni Cade Bambara; Passing, by Nella Larsen;
Middle Passage, by Charles Johnson; The
Chaneysville Incident, by David Bradley; Reck
less Eyeballing, by Ishmael Reed; Cane, by Jean
Toomer.
