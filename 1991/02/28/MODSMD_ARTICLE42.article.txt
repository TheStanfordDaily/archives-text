As a high school English teacher, it took Mary
Helen Washington 10 years to feel committed to her
work; she would "teach for years without passion and
without a sense of fulfillment, a kind of marriage of
necessity."
In 1968, however, after completing a master's
degree in literature, "all of this done as though sleep
walking," Washington enrolled in the Black Studies
Department at the University of Detroit and thus set
herself "on the task which would engage her, passion
ately, for the next 20 years."
Today, Washington celebrates the discovery she
made in 1968 by pulling together the various ideas
and works of fiction in which, over the last 20 years,
she found "something of my ancestry, my future and
my own voice." These are stories by and about
women like herself, stories by and about black
women.
"Black-Eyed Susans, Midnight Birds" is the prod
uct of her vision.
More than an anthology of short stories and
excerpts from larger works, the book constitutes a
continuum across the genre of black fiction, project
ing various ways in which black women have repre
sented themselves in fiction and the ideas which sur
round them. It brings together the "voices" of black

women who are continually left out of the insular
world of great literature.
Washington includes, before and after each story,
a brief biography of the piece's author and a short

survey and discussion of the lit
erary criticism that surrounds
that writer's work. Interspersed
with this commentary, Wash
ington includes her own pearls
of insight about the author's
meaning and metaphor.
What she creates through
these patches of commentary is
a body of insight into black lit
erature most suitable for those
just embarking upon this field.
The book ignores many of the
formal modes of literary criti
cism, mostly because, as Wash
ington complains, many of the
formal literary critics have
ignored black literature.

What she does not create, ho' ever, is an in-depth
look at any one particular author. Washington's hur
ried surveys of other sources of criticism can be tiring
at times, as can be her introductions, which explain
the story to follow and call to mind allusions from
other works in the book â€” works which the reader
may not have yet read.
The more one progresses in the book, the easier it
becomes to understand such allusions. However, this
hardly compensates for those lost in the beginning.

This walking tour through the black literary tradi
tion does indeed hold one's interest. The stories and
excerpts Washington has chosen are inspiring and
moving as they cut across both racial and gender lines

to the heart and spirit of human
ity.
including such major authors
as Toni Morrison and Alice
Walker, Washington also focuses
with as much interest upon less
known and more diverse writers
and their styles, such as the
unconventional patterns of lan
guage used by Ntozake Shange
and the "lyricism" of Gayle
Jones' work.
Emphasizing the "intertextu
ality" of the tradition, the dia
logue between the texts and the
authors, Washington unfolds a
moving drama in the tradition,

outlining the contradictions and ironies of being a
woman writer.
One author may focus on the trials of being
chained to the role of mother and wife, as Paulette
Childress White does when she states, "I cannot
imagine an occupation more in conflict with writing
than homemaking."
Alice Walker claims, however, "that her experi
ences teach her that racism and sexism ... are far
more threatening obstacles to her work than her own
child."
