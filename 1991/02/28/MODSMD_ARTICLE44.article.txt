Tctlkiri Blues
Bob Mcnley 8c The Wallers
In the pantheon of rock-era musi
cians, Bob Marley is the God of reggae
music. "Talkin' Blues," the latest col
lection of Marley's work to be released
posthumously, is required listening for
reggae fans seeking insight into Mar
ley's prolific, albeit evanescent, life.
Containing more than 60 minutes
of unreleased material, "Talkin' Blues"
is highlighted by seven songs recorded
live for a KSAN radio audience at the
Record Plant in Sausalito. These per
formances are the only recordings
from The Wailers' 1973 American tour
and thus make up the only collection
of live recordings of The Wailers with
Peter Tosh still in the band.
Ranging from the popular "Get Up,
Stand Up," which Tosh co-wrote and
sang with Marley, to a version of the
less-known "Rastaman Chant" which
far outshines the version found on the
studio album "Burnin'," these perfor
mances are not as polished as those
found on the "Live" album.
But what these recordings lack in
finish, they make up for in vitality. Not
that "Live" is dull, but "Talkin Blues"
finds Marley and Tosh taking more
chances than on other albums.
Also included in the performances
are a Neville Livingston (a.k.a. Bunny
Wailer) composition, "Walk The
Proud Land," and "You Can't Blame
The Youth," a track written by Tosh,
neither of which ever appeared on any
of The Wailers' albums released under
the Island record label.
In addition to the seven KSAN
recordings, "Talkin' Blues" contains
"Am-a-do," a song never released in
any version; a lengthy 1975 perfor

mance of "I Shot The Sheriff,"
recorded at The Lyceum in London the
night before the version on "Live" was
recorded; and two alternate versions of
the "Natty Dread" tracks "Talkin'
Blues" and "Bend Down Low."
Finally, interspersed among the 11
songs contained on "Talkin' Blues" are
10 excerpts from a 1975 interview of
Marley on Jamaican radio. And if you
don't have trouble with Marley's
dialect — there's English in there
somewhere — you might actually
learn something about the break-up of
the original Wailers. And you might
even get some of Marley's jokes.
I haven't gotten them; in fact, the
only reason I know there are jokes in
the interview is because the inter
viewer laughs.
For the uninitiated, "Legend," Mar
ley's greatest hits, remains the best
purchase, guaranteed to please. But if
you already have the hits and want
variety, I highly recommend "Talkin*
Blues."

A Different Kind
of Weather
The Dream Academy
When The Dream Academy broke
onto the scene in 1986, the English trio
caught the music industry by surprise.
Amazingly, these three youngsters
found a way to translate nostalgic
images into ethereal, dreamy ballads,
scoring a top 10 hit with "Life In A
Northern Town" and a cameo in the
movie "Ferris Bueller's Day Off."
But despite the quick start, The
Dream Academy flopped with a sec

ond album and disappeared just as
quickly as they came.
With their third album, "A Differ
ent Kind Of Weather," The Dream
Academy attempts to regain their
atmospheric style of music. But
though some tracks show brief flashes
of brilliance, the three musicians again
fail to sustain any momentum.
Behind many of Nick Laird-Clowes'
Beatlesque vocals lies a touch of vul
nerability, a sound which works well in
the two opening tracks. Keyboardist
Gilbert Gabriel opens the album
quickly with a cover version of John
Lennon's "Love," followed by the

haunting "Mercy Killing," the album's
best track. Though both tracks move
considerably faster than the Academy's
past ballads, Clowes, Gabriel and
oboist Kate St. John hold the pace well.
But the trio runs out of steam for
the rest of the album, a bad sign when
there are still nine tracks to go. "St.
Valentine's Day"and "Lowlands" typ
ify the Academy's fundamental prob
lem: caught behind wispy songs with
simplistic structures, the group sounds
foolishly naked. Other tracks, like the
slow "Waterloo," never even get off the
ground.
The Dream Academy's handle on
music should not rely on clever
psychedelic effects to cheat their way
through songs. On some tracks, the
group proves they can handle a faster
pace with ease. Exposed by weak hooks
that fail to catch, though, the trio
flounders. With their obvious musical
potential, one only hopes that "A Dif
ferent Kind of Weather" is not a
barometer for The Dream Academy's
future.

chances than on other albums.
Also included in the performances
are a Neville Livingston (a.k.a. Bunny
Wailer) composition, "Walk The
Proud Land," and "You Can't Blame
The Youth," a track written by Tosh,
neither of which ever appeared on any
of The Wailers' albums released under
the Island record label.
In addition to the seven KSAN
recordings, "Talkin' Blues" contains
"Am-a-do," a song never released in
any version; a lengthy 1975 perfor

mance of "I Shot The Sheriff,"
recorded at The Lyceum in London the
night before the version on "Live" was
recorded; and two alternate versions of
the "Natty Dread" tracks "Talkin'
Blues" and "Bend Down Low."
Finally, interspersed among the 11
songs contained on "Talkin' Blues" are
10 excerpts from a 1975 interview of
Marley on Jamaican radio. And if you
don't have trouble with Marley's
dialect — there's English in there
somewhere — you might actually
learn something about the break-up of
the original Wailers. And you might
even get some of Marley's jokes.
I haven't gotten them; in fact, the
only reason I know there are jokes in
the interview is because the inter
viewer laughs.
For the uninitiated, "Legend," Mar
ley's greatest hits, remains the best
purchase, guaranteed to please. But if
you already have the hits and want
variety, I highly recommend "Talkin*
Blues."

A Different Kind
of Weather
The Dream Academy
When The Dream Academy broke
onto the scene in 1986, the English trio
caught the music industry by surprise.
Amazingly, these three youngsters
found a way to translate nostalgic
images into ethereal, dreamy ballads,
scoring a top 10 hit with "Life In A
Northern Town" and a cameo in the
movie "Ferris Bueller's Day Off."
But despite the quick start, The
Dream Academy flopped with a sec

ond album and disappeared just as
quickly as they came.
With their third album, "A Differ
ent Kind Of Weather," The Dream
Academy attempts to regain their
atmospheric style of music. But
though some tracks show brief flashes
of brilliance, the three musicians again
fail to sustain any momentum.
Behind many of Nick Laird-Clowes'
Beatlesque vocals lies a touch of vul
nerability, a sound which works well in
the two opening tracks. Keyboardist
Gilbert Gabriel opens the album
quickly with a cover version of John
Lennon's "Love," followed by the

haunting "Mercy Killing," the album's
best track. Though both tracks move
considerably faster than the Academy's
past ballads, Clowes, Gabriel and
oboist Kate St. John hold the pace well.
But the trio runs out of steam for
the rest of the album, a bad sign when
there are still nine tracks to go. "St.
Valentine's Day"and "Lowlands" typ
ify the Academy's fundamental prob
lem: caught behind wispy songs with
simplistic structures, the group sounds
foolishly naked. Other tracks, like the
slow "Waterloo," never even get off the
ground.
The Dream Academy's handle on
music should not rely on clever
psychedelic effects to cheat their way
through songs. On some tracks, the
group proves they can handle a faster
pace with ease. Exposed by weak hooks
that fail to catch, though, the trio
flounders. With their obvious musical
potential, one only hopes that "A Dif
ferent Kind of Weather" is not a
barometer for The Dream Academy's
future.
