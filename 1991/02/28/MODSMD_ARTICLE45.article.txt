Are you a victim of the Dating
Doldrums?
For the past two months, have
you and your significant other been
caught in that endless cycle of
movies, crowded parties and fro-yo
runs?
Fear not, brave students, for

there is a place you can go to enjoy
good company and recreation and
still avoid draining your checking
account. All it takes is a pair of
rented ice skates and a Palo Alto
treasure spot.
The Winter Lodge, located at
3009 Middlefield Road, provides a
perfect escape for any couple — or
group of friends — desperate for a
change of scenery. The Lodge boasts
"the only outdoor ice skating west of
the Sierras," and indeed, it is an odd
experience to skate under the stars
in mild California weather.
Nevertheless, this quaint rink
provides all the essentials of a frozen
neighborhood pond: a smooth sheet
of ice and crisp air nipping at your

nostrils. Even thoughts of impend
ing finals melt away as the piped-in
Top 40 tunes fill your ears and numb
your mind.
As carefree as an evening of skat
ing at the Lodge might sound, one
must be warned that it is not a ven
ture completely devoid of potential
embarrassments. Just like ordering
spaghetti on a first date, skating can
have its social hazards. Unless you're
a pro, the chances of making some
pretty awkward spills while negoti
ating walls, other people and your
own shoelaces are greater than aver
age.
But never fear fellow chickens,
there is always the "Hang-On-To-
The-Wall-And-Inch-Your-Way-
Around-The-Rink" method, a
rather slow, but decidedly safe,
approach to ice skating.
Even if balancing your entire
body on two thin metal blades isn't
exactly your idea of a good time, the
Lodge itself, complete with fireplace
and warm wood interior, is practi
cally a Palo Alto landmark and is
worth checking out. Duncan
Williams, a professor of engineering
at Stanford and San Jose State, built
the lodge in 1956 intending the rink
to be for recreation use only.
To ensure that the rink would
never be used for competition pur
poses, Williams designed it to be
smaller than traditional rinks.
"Serious skaters and hockey play
ers have to find somewhere else to
go," said Nicholas Luby, assistant
manager of the Lodge, "we definitely
cater to the community."
"We get a lot of Stanford students
on Friday and Saturday nights," said
Luby, "at $5 a shot, it's cheaper than
a movie!"
So what if you're not the next
Debbie Thomas? You'd be amazed at
how far a little bit of mutual humili
ation among friends can go.
