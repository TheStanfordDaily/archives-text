# New policy has done little to stop underage drinking
## 
### Sarah Morisseau Staff writer 
If rules were made to be broken — or at
least circumvented — Stanford's new alco
hol policy doesn't seem to be an exception.
Save for making people more aware of
the consequences of underage drinking, the
University's new policy does not seem to
have made any big changes in the use of
alcohol by those under 21:

• Some four-class dorms are still using
dorm funds to buy alcohol.
The policy, released Nov. 14, does not
expressly prohibit using dorm funds for
alcohol but does state residence staffs
"should not provide alcohol to minors, nor
should they allow University funds to be
used in a way which violates the policy"
• Two freshman dorms gave rebates
from house dues and collected this monev
for a party fund to be used in part
for alcohol.
• Many residences have not yet
started checking age identifica
tion at parties.
"We have been using dorm
funds" to buy alcohol, said Roble
resident assistant Jon Abernethy,
explaining that the dormitory
made this decision because Roble
has residents who are over 21.
"We (the RAs) let house gov
ernment essentially do what they
want unless they do something
blatantly out of line. It wasn't a
situation where we felt we had to
step in," Abernethy said, explain
ing that Roble's house govern

ment is very independent from its
advising staff.
According to junior Sarah
Bernstein, a Storey House officer,
her dorm is also still using dorm
funds to buy alcohol. "Since we
don't have any frosh, we didn't
even think about the dorm funds
question," she said.
Those in freshman dorms have
not only been thinking about the
house funds question, they have
come up with an answer: rebates.
Rinconada and Madera, both all
freshman dorms, have rebated
house dues and spent some of that
money on alcohol.
"The refund money went into a
pool which then became private
money. That way it wouldn't be
dorm funds anymore," explained
freshman Chris Morace, a mem
ber of Rinconada's social commit

tee.
Rinconada refunded $8 per res
ident from dorm funds and put it
into a party account to pay for
both alcohol and non-alcoholic
beverages. Because the decision
was unanimous, the rebate was
actually a transfer; students
never actually handled the money.
However, Madera residents
were physically handed $5 in an
envelope and then had the option
of either putting it into one of two
separate funds for alcohol or non
alcoholic beverages or keeping it
for themselves. About one-third of
the residents kept the money.
"When the rebate was decided
on, there were obviously some
people who had their eyes on the
money to give it to alcohol,"
Madera RA Ellen Schur said.
"When we voted last quarter to

raise the house dues, some people
were under the impression that
that money would in part be buy
ing alcohol for parties. Then the
rules changed and people decided
they wanted the money back,"
Schur explained.
Freshman Frank Guevara said
Madera made sure the rebate plan
was set up so that the money used
on alcohol would "no longer be
any part of the dorm funds at all."
The Rinconada and Madera
rebates do not violate any Univer
sity rules or regulations.
"It is students' money. The stu
dents can vote to rebate it back to
themselves," said Michael Jack
son, associate dean of student
affairs. "It is their money, but if
(underage) individuals take it
upon themselves to go to a liquor
store" then that is obviously

against the law, he said.
At the same time, Jackson
noted, "one would be hard pressed
to say the rebate was used explic
itly for alcohol." .
The only legal problem is the
fact that the students who were
buying alcohol were underage.
"We have neither the time nor
the interest in running around
being micromanagers in resi
dences," said acting Assoc. Dean
of Student Affairs Diana Conklin.
"We're not going to play parents."
Because students know Uni
versity officials will respond to
reports of alcohol policy offenses
but not search out offenders, stu
dents are taking precautions to be
more responsible.
"We figure as long as you're
responsible, it won't be a prob
lem," Morace said.

But this responsibility does not
translate into direct compliance
with the policy. Party-goers and
those throwing parties report that
there has not been any major
effort to check age identification.
"I still stick out a cup and the
guy behind the keg will fill it up,"
explained freshman Atman Shah.
Freshman Carol Cho, a Roble
social committee chairperson,
said Roble has not asked for age
identification at its parties.
Instead servers ask people if they
are of age before they serve them
alcohol.
"It went by the honor code,"
she said of a party last weekend,
explaining that because the party
was "invite only," Roble residents
did not feel they needed to card
guests.
