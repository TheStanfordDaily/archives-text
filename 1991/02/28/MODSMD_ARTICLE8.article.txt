# Department calls for drastic water cuts
## 
### Art Marcum Staff writer 
Despite yesterday's rain, new restrictions
on water use will probably make Stanford sac
rifice some of its green.
A new water rationing plan will soon force
the University to reduce outside watering by
90 percent, irrigate all plants with non-potable
water and forbid students and faculty mem
bers from washing cars on campus, said David
Kaye, Stanford's utilities manager.
The plan, announced Tuesday by the San
Francisco Water Department, requires the
department's clients to cut their water con
sumption by 45 percent of use levels in 1987,
the last year of normal rainfall. Previous
restrictions had imposed a 25 percent reduc
tion.
The water department, which is Stanford's

chief supplier, gets its water from the dwin
dling Hetch Hetchy reservoir near Yosemite
National Park.
Kaye said the cutbacks were less severe
than he expected. However, he said all mem
bers of the Stanford community must do their
part to save water.
"This is not the first crisis we've been
through and I think we can come out all
right," said Kaye.
Kaye said water meters are currently being
installed in all Stanford buildings to monitor
water use on campus, and figures will be pub
lished every week in Campus Report.
In addition to monitoring use, the Univer
sity will ask resident assistants and resident
fellows to help heighten drought awareness in
the dormitories.
"We're not going to punish anyone," Kaye
said. "We want to make students part of the

solution, not show them who is the problem."
Emphasizing the severity of the drought,
Kaye called yesterday's rainfall "a tease."
"This rain is like pouring a canteen on a for
est fire," he said. "My guess is that it will take
three to four years of normal rainfall before
drought conditions (are eliminated)."
If normal rainfall does not resume soon,
Hetch Hetchy could dry up completely in two
years, Kaye said. Stanford is investigating
long-term remedies in preparation for a con -
tinued drought.
He said possible ways to ease the pain of the
drought include importing water by tanker,
using only reclaimed water for irrigation and
finding other alternative sources of water.
Kaye said he expects the cutback to remain
at 45 percent for the near future because it is
based on the lowest projections of rainfall and
snowpack run-off for this year.
