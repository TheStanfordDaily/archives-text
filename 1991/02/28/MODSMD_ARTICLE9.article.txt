An elderly Palo Alto woman
charged with embezzling $48,000
from a now-defunct day-care cen
ter at the Nixon Elementary
School on campus was released on
bail last night.
Alys Futtere, 73, was arrested
at her home Tuesday and charged
with two counts of grand theft,
two counts of embezzlement and
three felony counts of tax evasion.
Bail was set at $25,000, said
Margo Smith, supervising deputy
district attorney at the Palo Alto
branch of the Santa Clara County
Municipal Court.
The arrest came after a six

month investigation led by Stan
ford Police Sgt. Tim Frecceri that
also involved the Internal Rev
enue Service and the California
Franchise Tax Board.
The Nixon School, located at
1711 Stanford Avenue, is part of
the Palo Alto Unified School Dis
trict, but the after-school day-care
center was not affiliated with the
district, Frecceri said.
Neither the school nor the cen
ter is related to the University
Futtere was responsible for
bookkeeping and collecting pay
ments at the center, Frecceri said.
She allegedly billed parents for
the full amount of day care,
deposited part of the fees in the
center's bank account and put the

rest in her personal account, he
added.
The investigation centered on
the years 1986 to 1990, during
which time the center was oper
ated by two separate organiza
tions. The Palo Alto Recreation
Department ran the center until
1988, when the Los Altos-based
California Children's Community
took over.
Futtere worked for both orga
nizations. Her contract with Chil
dren's Community was not
renewed last March for reasons
unrelated to the charges, Frecceri
said. The day-care center is not
currently in operation.
Administrators at Children's
Community discovered their bank

accounts were $20,000 short
about six months ago, and the
Recreation Department reported
missing about $28,000, Frecceri
said.
No one was available for com
ment at either organization.
The district attorney's office
intends to prosecute the case and
seek restitution for the embezzled
funds, Smith said.
Although Futtere was the first
suspect the police considered, the
investigation lasted six months
because of its complexity, Frecceri
said.
Securing warrants to obtain
and examine the bank records was
a "very exhaustive process," Frec
ceri said.
