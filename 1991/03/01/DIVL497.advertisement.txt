You too can learn to fly.
It's only natural that you'd want to. Fact is, over an
eighth of all Stanford students do it regularly
Because, the only way to satisfy the age old dream
to fly is to become a pilot yourself. And the cost?
Stanford Flying Club members can fly planes for
less than it costs to rent a car. Go on, keep that
promise to yourself that you'd be flying one day.
