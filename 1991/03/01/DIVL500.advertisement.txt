If you thought that finding a color Macintosh"
system you could afford was just a dream, then the
new, affordable Macintosh LC is a dream come true.
The Macintosh LC is rich in color. Unlike many
computers that can display only 16 colors at once, the
Macintosh LC expands your palette to 256 colors. It
also comes with a microphone and new sound-input
technology that lets yoti personalize your work by
adding voice or other sounds.
Like every Macintosh
computer, the LC is easy to
set up and easy to master.
And it runs thousands of
available applications that
all work in the same,
consistent way-so once
Apple introduces the Macintosh LC
you've learned one program, you're well on your way
to learning them all. The Macintosh LC even lets you
share information with someone who uses a different
type of computer-thanks to the versatile Apple"
SuperDriveT which can read from and write to
Macintosh, MS-DOS, OS/2, and Apple 11 floppy disks.
Take a look at the Macintosh LC and see what it
gives you. Then pinch yourself.
It's better than a dream-it's a
Macintosh.
