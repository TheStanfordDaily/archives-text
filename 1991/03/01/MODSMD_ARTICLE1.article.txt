## U.S. insists on arms embargo against Saddam 
### 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) - The United
States has drafted a resolution offering a set
tlement to the Gulf War and insisting an arms
embargo against Iraq remain in place as long
as Saddam Hussein stays in power, diplomats
said yesterday.
The resolution was expected to be presented
to the Security Council today .
In Washington, State Department
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler outlined the
U.S. requirements in the resolution.
"We have always said that if Saddam Hus
sein remains in power, it's the view of the
United States government that an arms
embargo must continue," she said. "That
remains our view."
The United Nations slapped the embargo on
Iraq after the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
Diplomats said the resolution also requires:
• Iraq's compliance with all 12 Security
Council resolutions on the invasion,
• Immediate release of Kuwaiti hostages

and third-country captives,
• Acceptance in principle of liability for
damage and injuries caused by Iraq,
• Immediate return of Kuwaiti air
planes, incubators and other assets
removed after the Aug. 2 invasion, and
• Rescinding of Iraq's annexation of
Kuwait.
The five permanent members of the
council — the United States, the Soviet
Union, Britain, France and China — were
discussing the proposal yesterday .
The United States was drafting the res
olution even as the Security Council was
holding consultations on formalizing the
provisional cease-fire called by President
Bush.
Some diplomats said they had hoped the
council would swiftly formalize the cease
fire. But the United States and Britain
argued there was no immediate need for
the United Nations to do so.
"We already have a cease-fire," U.S.
Ambassador Thomas Pickering said as he
left the consultations.
The United States argued instead that
the most important thing was a meeting of

allied and Iraqi commanders to discuss
cease-fire terms such as an exchange of
prisoners and release of Kuwaitis. Iraq has
agreed to the meeting.
A U.S. official in Washington, speaking
on condition of anonymity, said Iraqi diplo
mat Khalid Shewayish was called to the
State Department yesterday evening and
told where and when U.S. military com
manders would like to meet with Iraqi
brass. The same message was given to Iraqi
diplomats at the United Nations and also
relayed to Baghdad through the Soviet
Union.
After the meeting, Western diplomats
said, the Security Council would be in a
position to declare a permanent cease-fire,
send observers and begin work on estab
lishing security in the region.
Prospects of a Security Council meeting
today were uncertain and some Western
diplomats said Monday was more likely.
After the Security Council consultations
broke up, Pickering and Iraqi Ambassador
Abdul Amir al-Anbari held a brief conver
sation after greeting with a smile and a
handshake, diplomats said. Details were
not available.
