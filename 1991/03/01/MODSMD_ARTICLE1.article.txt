UNITED NATIONS (AP) - The United
States has drafted a resolution offering a set
tlement to the Gulf War and insisting an arms
embargo against Iraq remain in place as long
as Saddam Hussein stays in power, diplomats
said yesterday.
The resolution was expected to be presented
to the Security Council today .
In Washington, State Department
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler outlined the
U.S. requirements in the resolution.
"We have always said that if Saddam Hus
sein remains in power, it's the view of the
United States government that an arms
embargo must continue," she said. "That
remains our view."
The United Nations slapped the embargo on
Iraq after the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
Diplomats said the resolution also requires:
• Iraq's compliance with all 12 Security
Council resolutions on the invasion,
• Immediate release of Kuwaiti hostages
