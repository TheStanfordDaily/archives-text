Civil war feared by Latvians
MOSCOW (AP) — Three days before Lat
vians and Estonians vote on independence in
unofficial referendums, the top Latvian Com
munist warned Thursday of possible civil war
over the secessionist issue.
"A civil war can be avoided in Latvia by
declaring presidential rule in the republic,"
party chief Alfreds Rubiks was quoted as say
ing by the state news agency Tass.
Presidential rule can include dissolving the
local parliament and imposing virtual dictato
rial control over the republic.
The vote Sunday in Latvia is expected to be
close because only 50 percent of the 2.7 million
populace is ethnic Latvian. The rest are mostly
Russian and Byelorussian.
Kurdish demonstrators killed
ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Security forces
opened fire to stop demonstrations in a Kur
dish town Thursday, killing two peasants and
wounding three, the Anatolia news agency
quoted authorities as saying.
A soldier also was killed when he stepped on
a live wire while trying to block farmers from
entering a nearby state-run coal mine.
The shooting took place in Sirnak, a pre
dominantly Kurdish settlement in southeast
ern Turkey, the semi-official news agency
reported.
The office said soldiers fired when demon
strators — wielding clubs, throwing rocks and
smashing shop windows — marched through
Sirnak in protest that farmers were kept from
removing coal from the mine to heat their
houses.
Only the state is allowed to distribute coal.
Kurds comprise about 20 percent of
Turkey's 57 million citizens and have strug
gled for decades for an independent homeland.
Peru's cholera epidemic worsens
LIMA, Peru (AP) — As the number of cholera
victims climbed above 45,000 Thursday, double
the figure from a week ago, doctors harshly crit
icized President Alberto Fujimori for telling
Peruvians that raw fish was safe to eat.
At least 193 people have died since the
cholera epidemic, the first in the Western
Hemisphere in more than a century, was first
reported a month ago.
Fujimori and his wife have repeatedly been
shown eating raw fish on television. The
footage is meant to boost the country's slump
ing fishing industry, but the Health Ministry
insists that raw fish may be contaminated.
