WASHINGTON (AP) - An untapped
"silent majority" opposes most abortions
but is not well informed about women's
rights to end their pregnancies, an anti
abortion group said Thursday in announc
ing the results of a poll it commissioned
from the Gallup Organization.
Americans United for Life said the sur
vey shows most Americans do not know the
extent to which abortion is legal.
"When properly informed, a majority of
people will embrace a new policy" that
severely restricts abortions, contended
Laurie Anne Ramsey, the group's vice pres
ident for public affairs. "The vast majority
of Americans are opposed to most abor
tions."
The new poll seems to contradict other
surveys that show most Americans support
the right to abortion created by the
Supreme Court's 1973 ruling in Roe vs.
Wade.
And abortion rights activists disputed
the United for Life findings.

"The main point is most polls show
abortion is a highly complex moral, ethical,
religious issue," said Loretta Ucelli, chief
spokeswowan for the National Abortion
Rights Action League. "But they also show
consistently that people believe ... the deci
sion belongs to an individual and her family
The United for Life survey focused
largely on what the abortion right entails
and how people feel about abortions under
particular circumstances, rather than
whether abortions should be banned by law.
For example, 42 percent of those ques
tioned said they thought the 1973 ruling
made abortions legal only during the first
three months of pregnancy.
In Roe vs. Wade, the court said a
woman's decision to have an abortion dur
ing the first three months of pregnancy
must be left to her and her doctor. It said
states may impose certain regulations dur
ing the second trimester to protect the
woman's health, and may take steps to pro
tect fetal life in the third trimester.
