GENEVA (AP) - Famine
caused by two years of drought
and continuing civil war threatens
up to 13 million people in Ethiopia
and Sudan this year, Internation
al Red Cross officials said Thurs
day.
Saying "widespread famine is
imminent," the League of Red
Cross and Red Crescent Societies
appealed for $66 million in inter
national emergency aid.
It was the latest of several
warnings by international aid
agencies that the area could face a
repeat of the devastating 1984-85
famine that killed more than 1

million people in the two African
countries and left millions more in
refugee camps.
"It's nearly as bad, very close to
the situation in 1984-85," said
Red Cross spokeswoman Ann
Naef.
The Red Cross said two-thirds
of the appeal funds were ear
marked for Ethiopia, where up to
6 million people face famine after
two years of complete crop failure.
Civil strife between the govern
ment and two rebel groups has
driven about 800,000 people from
their homes and left croplands
barren.
