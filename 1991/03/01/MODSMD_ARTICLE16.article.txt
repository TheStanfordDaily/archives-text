President's education
plan falls short, takes
away more than it gives

THE BUSH administration
has presented its plan for the
federal education budget and
the overhaul of student aid pro
grams. Nearly all of the plan is con
troversial; parts of it are worth
considering; much of it is garbage.
One of Bush's proposals is more
than welcome: The amount of
financial aid grants made available
to poor students will be increased
dramatically.
While colleges have made strides
in increasing the representation of
ethnic minorities in their classes,
little has been accomplished to
eliminate the barriers confronting
economically disadvantaged stu
dents. The prohibitive costs of a
university education have kept
most disadvantaged students out
of the nation's colleges and univer
sities. A policy which helps needy
students gain access to higher edu
cation is much needed.
However, in what will surely
provoke controversy, those gains
are made at the expense of elimi
nating Pell Grants for students
from families with incomes above
$20,000. Excluding middle-income
students from federal financial aid
grants is an enormous price. The
plan would bar many able but truly
needy students from attending a
top university.
It is wrong that the paltry size of
the education budget makes educa
tion a "redistributive" issue —
something is taken from one group
to be given to another. Indeed, the
entire education budget itself
invites skepticism. Bush proposes
no increase in the $6.7 billion edu
cation budget. Adjusted for infla
tion, the education budget is actu

ally being cut.
Some of the administration's
other proposals for financial aid
programs are downright suspect.
For example, the plan includes cut
ting work-study and supplemental
aid programs, in the hope that col
leges will pick up the slack.
It is doubtful that colleges will
be willing — or able — to take over
these programs. Stanford, for
example, faces monumental bud
get woes. A number of colleges
already cannot offer financial aid
for all of their students who need
it.
The Bush plan also proposes to
eliminate financial aid for students
in the bottom 10 percent of their
college classes. This discriminates
against students who are from
weaker high schools or who attend
the most competitive colleges. It
also reverses attempts to attract
disadvantaged high school stu
dents to competitive universities.
The Bush plan seeks to deal with
the problem of student-loan
defaults by giving institutions the
power to make loan decisions,
threatening to eliminate financial
aid for students at schools whose
default rates are high.
Making regulation of aid pro
grams more flexible would be a
meaningful reform. However, it
comes at a high price. It is exces
sive to punish students by cutting
off their aid when their school is
too liberal with its loans. It would
also bias loan procedures against
poor students, who represent a
greater loan risk for the school.
Debate in Congress on the edu
cation budget will occur this
spring; debate on financial aid pol
icy will go on for the next year.
It is ludicrous that education is
given such a low priority in the
administration's budget.
The impact of this legislation
will be profound, and students
should be vocal about their needs
and desires for financial aid policy.
