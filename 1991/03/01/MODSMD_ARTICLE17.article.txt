Media are out to make a buck, not just report the news

WHILE IT IS OBVIOUS that peo
ple should be responsible for
their actions, institutions are
composed of people who have political
and economic interests. It is, therefore,
naive to believe that the actions of insti
tutions will not be influenced by these
interests.
In response to Tim Marklein's column
in The Daily on Feb. 25,1 wish to
emphasize that "media-bashing" has
unfortunately not yet become an integral
part of the "American Way."
News reporting is not a public service,
but rather an industry. Television and
radio receive roughly 100 percent of
their income from advertisers, newspa
pers 75 percent and magazines 50 per
cent.
And increasingly, the control of these
sources has become consolidated.
In 1986, General Electric Co., a com
pany with a vested interest in nuclear
power and some of the largest military
contracts involving nuclear weapons and
Strategic Defense Initiative, bought
NBC.
In 1989, Time Inc., the largest maga
zine publisher in the United States,

acquired Warner Communications, Inc.
(an extremely large record and television
production company), giving one firm,
with combined assets of about $25 bil
lion, control of an array of media
sources.
In the media, as in any organization, a
hierarchy of owners and managers
decides what product will be produced
and what will be sent to the marketplace
— in this case, something that doesn't
offend advertisers.
Moreover, these media firms and
other giants like them have investments
in other places — and they're not about
to let their media divisions run many
stories critical about people or events
that may undermine a hefty profit.
The New York Times CEO Arthur
Sulzberger admits he pushed his editors
to present the automobile industry's
position for looser safety standards in
the 1970s because it "would affect adver
tising." His admission is not an excep
tion, but rather represents the rule.
Advertisers threaten to pull ads from
a publication/broadcast if the coverage is
not to their liking. It is routine "cour
tesy" in magazines, for example, to

inform advertisers ahead of time if they
are going to be critical of their firm or
vested interest.
Public Broadcasting Service is usually
no better than its "commercial neigh
bors." It receives support for its docu
mentaries and specials primarily from
large industry. Its "analytical" news
shows — the "MacNeil/Lehrer News
Hour," the "McLaughlin Group," etc.
have offered the same conservative view
point time after time.
Just as ABC's "Nightline" does, these
programs always draw from the same
sources of "politically significant" people,
Rarely do we see opposing viewpoints
from special interest, minority or envi
ronmental groups, or anyone associated
with anything on the left. The "opposi
tion" on these shows is simply a milder
conservative viewpoint or a "middle-of
the-road" position.
A great deal of reporting is simply
rewritten press releases given by official
sources: White House officials, presiden
tial aides and politicians.
Such reporting is repeated more often
not as a statement from a source, but
instead as the "facts." For example, the

Bureau of Labor Statistics compiles two
sets of statistics for unemployment each
month and makes both available to the
media, who, in turn, almost always
choose the milder figure which does not
include those forced to retire early and
those who have "given up" looking for
work after a month. Both sets of statis
tics count people who work for only an
hour each week as "fully employed."
In his column, Marklein seems to dis
miss easily notions of censorship existing
in the United States when he states (in
the context that they are wrong) that
"Anti-war protesters .. . claim the media
is involved in some kind of conspiracy
with the government to keep informa
tion from the public."
People who believe that the concept of
censorship is limited to government con
trol of media sources are truly censored.
If you currently obtain all of your
news from television and The Associated
Press press releases in The Daily: wake
up, take off your "Po-Jamas" and, if you
really get into it, throw away your televi
sion.
