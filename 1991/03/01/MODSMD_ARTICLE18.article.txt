# National security doesn't leave room for kinder, gentler army

### 
I READ WITH CONFUSION and dis
belief Myia Johnson's letter in The
Daily (Feb. 21). What started as an
appropriate discussion of the evils of
racism in the military degenerated into a
hopelessly idealistic condemnation of the
military's essential function: to train
and, if necessary, utilize men (and
women) in combat.
Johnson's condemnation rests upon
one central but dangerously misguided
principle: that to make men into soldiers
and, ultimately, killers, is a per se evil.
This is surely not the case.
Transforming men into soldiers is,

unfortunately, a necessary evil, an evil
no nation with any instinct for preserva
tion can be without.
No one would dispute that war is
dehumanizing or that the dehumaniza
tion is a horrible thing. Yet the need for
this evil does not arise from the U.S. mil
itary, the "mass media" or "corporate
power structures," but from human
nature, a force far more powerful than
anything created by society.
And until human nature changes, we
will need soldiers who are ready and will
ing and able to destroy the Adolf Hitlers
and Saddam Husseins of this world,

those who seek to expunge the freedom
of others.
I find myself compelled to defend an
unpalatable calculus: that soldiers must
be trained to "aggress and dominate," to
kill and not to be personally destroyed by
the reality of the destruction that their
efforts — and those of their opponents
— have caused. Only in this way will our
soldiers be able to defend our country,
our democracy and our vital interests.
How ludicrous it is to suggest that sol
diers not be trained to kill, and kill effec
tively!
I am sure Saddam Hussein would

have very much liked to confront John
son's kinder, gentler army, in which sol
diers are unable to harness their aggres
sion to destroy those who would destroy
them, in which soldiers become battle
field philosophers preoccupied with the
consequences of their actions.
Such luxuries must be reserved for
civilians in peacetime and our elected
leaders in wartime. Saddam and others
of his kind would find that their evil
ends would be far more easily attained in
the face of Johnson's military fantasy.
