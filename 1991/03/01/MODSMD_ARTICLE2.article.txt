# Row houses to change locales next year
## 
### Sarah Morisseau Staff writer 
A University administrator
announced yesterday that next
year, Synergy will be moved to
Durand, and the Delta Tau Delta
fraternity will take over 353 Cam
pus Drive.
Durand and 353 Campus resi
dents reacted angrily when they
were told of the decision at meet
ings with Row Director Jack Chin
last night.
The University decided to dis
place 353 Campus and Durand
because of a commitment made to
Synergy, Phi Psi and the Delts
when their original houses on San
Juan Hill overlooking the Theta
Xi house were destroyed in the
Earthquake of 1989, Chin said.
"The basis of the decision is
that we made a commitment to
those three programs saying we
would house them in a place
where they would be sustained.
Those groups were given priority,"
Chin said.
"Yes, it was a value judgment,"
he added. "Somebody's got to lose
in this and [the Office of Residen
tial Education] is saying we value"
the co-operatives more than the
University-operated residences.
Synergy residents said last
night that they were not aware of

dential Affairs, the Delta Tau

Synergy will relocate to Durand.

the final decision. Delt members
were not available for comment.
The Enchanted Broccoli For
est, which was formed when Phi
Psi merged with the AD house,
has "elected not to move," Chin
said.
Residents of Durand and 353
Campus are angered that they
were not consulted in the deci
sion-making process and say they
don't understand why Synergy
and the Delts were given priority.
"I'm very concerned that no
one from [Durand] was consulted
in making this decision. We find
out from a note on our chalkboard
that says 'Surprise, there won't be
a Durand next year,"' said senior
Chris Shuttles worth.
Chin defended the Office of
Residential Education's decision
to leave Row residents off the
committee by saying, "Over the
course of the deliberations, we
didn't want [many different]
groups to be all worked up about
being potentially relocated when
it would most likely end up" only
one or two would be relocated. He
also said the decision was made
because Res Ed officials knew it
would lead to heated arguments.
"They're pulling the rug out
from underneath our feet," said
Alex Accetta of 353 Campus. "I
feel let down and taken advantage
of, like I don't matter and it
doesn't matter what anybody in
this house wanted."
"Why is Synergy more impor
tant than we are?" asked Durand
resident Anne Masiga, a sopho
more. "I guess they thought
Durand was so small they could
just take us over and nobody
would notice," she said.
But Chin said the structure of
the Grove houses, where Synergy
was moved last year, makes them

difficult to run as a co-op. "Its
small kitchen, the L-shaped din
ing room and the small common
space are not large enough for all
residents to meet together — and
the two separate buildings make it
extremely difficult to form a solid
community," he said.
In the case of the Delts, Chin
said the fraternity did not think it
could attract members or fulfill its
Rush quota if they stayed in the
house at 553 Mayfield. Other rea
sons for moving the fraternity
included the size of the rooms and
the Delts' desire for a more
remote location.
Residents of 353 Campus also
charged Res Ed is giving priority
to an all-male group over a diverse
housing community.
"It's ridiculous. You're giving
priority to 20 men when there are
tons of [undergraduates of both
genders] who want to live here,"
Accetta said.
"It just seems to go against all
that Res Ed is supposed to be
about," said Adine Kernberg, a
senior living in 353 Campus.
Many residents also expressed
concern that the University is
reversing its previous decision not
to allow any more housing for
subjectively selected groups such
as fraternities.
Chin said University officials
realized they were going against
their policy, but they decided their
commitment to the Delts overrode
that consideration.
In addition, residents ques
tioned whether the Delts, who
have historically had problems
filling their Rush quotas, would
be able to attract enough men to
live in the larger 353 Campus res

idence, which has room for 17
more residents than 553 Mayfield.
Several students asked Chin
why the University couldn't wait
another year to see if the Delts
could fill the draw quota for 553
Mayfield.
One reason 353 Campus and
Durand are being taken over is
that they are not theme houses or
have a strong program, Chin said.
"Durand doesn't have a strong
program or any special theme, but
that's what we like about it. It's
for people who want to just relax
and get away from a special
theme," said sophomore Adjo
Amekudzi.
Explaining why the Enchanted
Broccoli Forest decided not to
move, resident assistant Kather
ine Baer said residents of that
house were happy living there.
"It's not centrally located. It's
near the Dish. It has a nice spa
cious yard," she said.
Residential Affairs has offered
to ease the burden of the displace
ment by offering the 553 Mayfield
residence as a self-operative for
those now in 353 Campus. Chin
also mentioned the possibility of
giving priority to current Durand
residents in the Draw this year.
Chin's offer to give 553 May
field to the residents of 353 Cam
pus as a self-op was immediately
rejected by all those at the meet
ing.
Despite the dissension in 353
Campus and Durand, Chin said he
still thinks "it is the best outcome,
considering all the factors."
But residents say they aren't
convinced. "This isn't going to be
the last Res Ed will hear from us,"
said Accetta.

still thinks "it is the best outcome,
considering all the factors."
But residents say they aren't
convinced. "This isn't going to be
the last Res Ed will hear from us,"
said Accetta.
A University administrator
announced yesterday that next
year, Synergy will be moved to
Durand, and the Delta Tau Delta
fraternity will take over 353 Cam
pus Drive.
Durand and 353 Campus resi
dents reacted angrily when they
were told of the decision at meet
ings with Row Director Jack Chin
last night.
The University decided to dis
place 353 Campus and Durand
because of a commitment made to
Synergy, Phi Psi and the Delts
when their original houses on San
Juan Hill overlooking the Theta
Xi house were destroyed in the
Earthquake of 1989, Chin said.
"The basis of the decision is
that we made a commitment to
those three programs saying we
would house them in a place
where they would be sustained.
Those groups were given priority,"
Chin said.
"Yes, it was a value judgment,"
he added. "Somebody's got to lose
in this and [the Office of Residen
tial Education] is saying we value"
the co-operatives more than the
University-operated residences.
Synergy residents said last
night that they were not aware of

the final decision. Delt members
were not available for comment.
The Enchanted Broccoli For
est, which was formed when Phi
Psi merged with the AD house,
has "elected not to move," Chin
said.
Residents of Durand and 353
Campus are angered that they
were not consulted in the deci
sion-making process and say they
don't understand why Synergy
and the Delts were given priority.
"I'm very concerned that no
one from [Durand] was consulted
in making this decision. We find
out from a note on our chalkboard
that says 'Surprise, there won't be
a Durand next year,"' said senior
Chris Shuttles worth.
Chin defended the Office of
Residential Education's decision
to leave Row residents off the
committee by saying, "Over the
course of the deliberations, we
didn't want [many different]
groups to be all worked up about
being potentially relocated when
it would most likely end up" only
one or two would be relocated. He
also said the decision was made
because Res Ed officials knew it
would lead to heated arguments.
"They're pulling the rug out
from underneath our feet," said
Alex Accetta of 353 Campus. "I
feel let down and taken advantage
of, like I don't matter and it
doesn't matter what anybody in
this house wanted."
"Why is Synergy more impor
tant than we are?" asked Durand
resident Anne Masiga, a sopho
more. "I guess they thought
Durand was so small they could
just take us over and nobody
would notice," she said.
But Chin said the structure of
the Grove houses, where Synergy
was moved last year, makes them

difficult to run as a co-op. "Its
small kitchen, the L-shaped din
ing room and the small common
space are not large enough for all
residents to meet together — and
the two separate buildings make it
extremely difficult to form a solid
community," he said.
In the case of the Delts, Chin
said the fraternity did not think it
could attract members or fulfill its
Rush quota if they stayed in the
house at 553 Mayfield. Other rea
sons for moving the fraternity
included the size of the rooms and
the Delts' desire for a more
remote location.
Residents of 353 Campus also
charged Res Ed is giving priority
to an all-male group over a diverse
housing community.
"It's ridiculous. You're giving
priority to 20 men when there are
tons of [undergraduates of both
genders] who want to live here,"
Accetta said.
"It just seems to go against all
that Res Ed is supposed to be
about," said Adine Kernberg, a
senior living in 353 Campus.
Many residents also expressed
concern that the University is
reversing its previous decision not
to allow any more housing for
subjectively selected groups such
as fraternities.
Chin said University officials
realized they were going against
their policy, but they decided their
commitment to the Delts overrode
that consideration.
In addition, residents ques
tioned whether the Delts, who
have historically had problems
filling their Rush quotas, would
be able to attract enough men to
live in the larger 353 Campus res

idence, which has room for 17
more residents than 553 Mayfield.
Several students asked Chin
why the University couldn't wait
another year to see if the Delts
could fill the draw quota for 553
Mayfield.
One reason 353 Campus and
Durand are being taken over is
that they are not theme houses or
have a strong program, Chin said.
"Durand doesn't have a strong
program or any special theme, but
that's what we like about it. It's
for people who want to just relax
and get away from a special
theme," said sophomore Adjo
Amekudzi.
Explaining why the Enchanted
Broccoli Forest decided not to
move, resident assistant Kather
ine Baer said residents of that
house were happy living there.
"It's not centrally located. It's
near the Dish. It has a nice spa
cious yard," she said.
Residential Affairs has offered
to ease the burden of the displace
ment by offering the 553 Mayfield
residence as a self-operative for
those now in 353 Campus. Chin
also mentioned the possibility of
giving priority to current Durand
residents in the Draw this year.
Chin's offer to give 553 May
field to the residents of 353 Cam
pus as a self-op was immediately
rejected by all those at the meet
ing.
