### Sarah Morisseau Staff writer 
A University administrator
announced yesterday that next
year, Synergy will be moved to
Durand, and the Delta Tau Delta
fraternity will take over 353 Cam
pus Drive.
Durand and 353 Campus resi
dents reacted angrily when they
were told of the decision at meet
ings with Row Director Jack Chin
last night.
The University decided to dis
place 353 Campus and Durand
because of a commitment made to
Synergy, Phi Psi and the Delts
when their original houses on San
Juan Hill overlooking the Theta
Xi house were destroyed in the
Earthquake of 1989, Chin said.
"The basis of the decision is
that we made a commitment to
those three programs saying we
would house them in a place
where they would be sustained.
Those groups were given priority,"
Chin said.
"Yes, it was a value judgment,"
he added. "Somebody's got to lose
in this and [the Office of Residen
tial Education] is saying we value"
the co-operatives more than the
University-operated residences.
Synergy residents said last
night that they were not aware of
