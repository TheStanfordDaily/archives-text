# Kofi Bruce & Andrew Katz
## It began with Orientation 
### 
WHEN WE ARRIVED AT OUR
dorms for the first time, the resi
dent assistants should have said,
"Welcome to summer camp for the incred
ibly gifted." We entered slowly, our heads
spinning. We learned from the map in the
lounge (you know, the one with every
one's picture on it) that people actually
live in Wyoming.
We were insecure. "How did I get in?
Do I belong here? Am I the only one who
can't play the piano?" we asked ourselves.
Trying to impress each other, we became
our college applications. We resembled a
walking list of activities and awards; our
personalities could be summed up in a
one-page essay (single-spaced).
To overcome our barriers of insecurity,
the RAs forced us to play the usual ice
breaker games — Smell Your Neighbor's
Shoe, Orgy, and I Never.
Stanford was a new beginning. We
could pick and choose our friends, our
classes and even our personalities. (The
lesson to be learned is: You can pick your
friends and you can pick your classes, but
you can't pick your friends' classes.)
We held an ideal image of ourselves
and our position in the dorm; each
moment was an attempt to live up to that
image. All the dorm was a stage, and we
were merely players. (Sorry, Bill.)
We put on a magnificent show filled
with torrid romances, alcoholic bever
ages, intellectual arguments, intense
friendships and late-night sex talks. (We
stress the fact that it was only talking.)
Unfortunately, the acting became tedious.
None of us could deny that it was a sham.
Nevertheless, we could not escape our
roles. We were all parts of a collective

organism — the dorm.
Originally we had thought that we
shared a common identity and mind. Any
attempt to deviate from the collective will
was met with pressure to fulfill the
dorm's expectations. One could be tried
and hanged for treason just for going on a
date and not telling the rest of the dorm
about it.
We resented this situation, and we
resented one another. There were spo
radic outbursts of hostility as individuals
lashed out against the oppressive envi
ronment. The conflict forced us to see
that we all had separate goals and desires.
It became apparent that the organism
would have to divide; we detached our
selves from the dorm amoeba and swam
away to establish our own identities.
Breaking away was difficult. It ended
some friendships and put others in jeop
ardy. As we set off in different directions,
we took with us whoever would come,
thus beginning a battle over friends/terri
tory. People suffered, chose sides and
went on with their lives.
Along the way we found people both in
and out of the dorm who accepted us as
individuals, no matter what role we
played. We focused our energies on what
made us happy, whether it was classwork,
activities or new relationships.
Many of those who had been our clos
est friends ceased to be important to us.
We forgot about the "dorm family." We
put it all behind us and convinced our
selves that its superficiality made it
meaningless.
As the end of the year approached,
however, we were shocked to find we
really did not know the people around us.

How could we leave the dorm — leave
behind the people who understood our
experience better than anyone, without
knowing who they had become?
Our sense of nostalgia drove us on to
rediscover each other. We tried to recreate
the collective spirit that had dominated
every aspect of our lives first quarter.
We had the same late night talks, wild
parties and sexual tension. But as much
as we tried to convince ourselves other
wise, something was lost. We realized that
we no longer shared the same feelings,
goals, ideals and expectations.
We had become individuals. What drew
us together, however, was our shared
memories and experiences — and it was
enough.
Nothing can compare to freshman
year. In the beginning we were a bunch of
confused egomaniacs, running around
trying to impress each other. At the end of
it all, we were Stanford students — what
ever that actually means.
Nothing can compare to being lost in
Eden with 60 of the most incredible peo
ple you have ever met. It sure as hell
beats knowing where you are going but
traveling alone.

Kjfi Bruce and Andrew Katz want Carde
nal 1989-90 to know: "We love you, you
know we do!"
