# Mickey Spillane's Büg digs incandescent dirt
## 
### John Ott Staph writher 
It was a dark and stormy night.
Outside my office window, the filthy city
streets were a witches' cauldron of bestial
sin, moral degradation and unnatural affec
tion for billy goats. No rain, however deter
mined, could wash these sordid thorough
fares.
Yes, this town stunk. And I could sense
something big was going to happen, like
maybe Mr. T would finally make that acting
comeback.

No sooner had these thoughts drifted
from my consciousness like a lazily expand
ing smoke ring than the door opened, and
she walked in. Or maybe glided is a better
word. No, wait — sashayed.
Her eyes were blue like Tidy Bowl, her
legs longer than the miles and miles of the
average person's lower intestine. She stood
tall and proud, but the illumination of the
pulsating neon lights on her face somehow
betrayed her.
"Something wrong, baby?" Not a sound
escaped her full, apple-red lips as she
handed me a note that smelled vaguely of
spring flowers and sorrow. In a graceful,
tear-stained script it read:
Dear Bug,
Since fluorescent light bulbs would
lower the University's electricity bill, why
don't they buy them for us?
"Why do you want to know, sugar?"
No reply.
"You've got nothing to say, honeybear?"
She shook her head. She must have been
a deaf mute. Or a mime. I hoped the former.
I just hate it when they start up with that
walking-in-the-wind thing.
"All right, butterface, we'll play it your
way. But as for payment. ..."
Just like that, she dropped a wad of
dough on my desk and left as quickly and
mysteriously as many of the embarrassing
social diseases I've encountered.
The next day, I started the case.

I had dealt with this heartless, energy
raping, gun-toting, baby-punching crowd
before. A trip to the pool hall and a crisp
stack of my client's greenbacks led me to a
secret source in Operations and Mainte
nance who would be known only as "Skull
cracker." Hired nominally by the Univer
sity, Skullcracker was better known in the
underworld for his illegal activities.
When I finally tracked him down, I could
tell he was hiding something.
"Let's have it out straight, Skullcracker.
Why the incandescent bulbs? Money?
Power? Or just the sick, sadistic satisfac
tion that keeps you degenerates going?"
He seemed amused. He had a smile on
his face like the sound of sharpening
knives. He tried to pull a gun on me but
before he could, I took a flying tackle at the
scum and floored him. I gave him a few
chops to the jaw, but he got up; the weasel
was no Carl "The Truth" Williams.
As we grappled, I couldn't help but won
der if this wasn't a small part of a bigger
story.
Was this just a glimmer of some larger
truth, the tip of a diabolical iceberg, the
first head of a conspiratory Hydra? Would
the skin of Skullcracker's face come loose
and tear away like it did in the climactic
episode of the"V" miniseries?
Or was I just overwriting?
Finally, 1 cornered the rat. Skullcracker
was a little more willing to squeal while
staring at a .357 Smith and Wesson with
steel-plated firing pin, double-catch safety
mechanism and Lucky Astrology Mood
Charm.
"All right, Skullcracker, let's talk. And
no monkey business."
His voice shook, "I hope you know what
you're getting into, Mr. Bug, or whoever
you are."
"That's Biig. Now get on with it."
"Well, the University actually utilizes
thousands of fluorescent bulbs, and only in
some residential buildings do the tradi
tional incandescent bulbs persist.
"Tell, whomever you're working for, Mr.
Biig, that we're in the process of replacing
them, and we would appreciate it if they'd
report any of the incandescent bulbs to us
so we can replace them, as they are 13 times
less energy effective.
"I hope you're satisfied," he muttered in
bitter defeat.
1 know what you're thinking. Sure, I
could have answered this in a paragraph,
but in a world that allows for the existence
of "Babes," I think I'm entitled to a little
aesthetic license.
Any similarity to persons living or dead
is purely coincidental.

Take a few letters out of "Bug," add a cou
ple more, and what do you get ? FUN! Send
your questions, the dumber the better, to the
Storke Publications Building.
