# TREASURE HUNT
## 
### 
First of all, I lied.
It's a $75 gift certificate to Crawdad and Company, a local Fa o
Alto restaurant whose classic style of ctyun cooking is ticklishly
juxtaposed to its refreshingly modern ambience.
If you were only in it for the money, I didn't want you anyway.
I want the few, the proud, the pathetic, those who are willing
to spend their precious time for the brief moment of admiration 1
may — or may not — throw their way.
On another note — I've been told by far too many of you that
last week's clue was too easy. _
My reply to you profligate masochists is this: The prize is still
out there isn't it?
So shut up.
And to those of you who think my tone is too sarcastic, I also
say, shut up.
Enough bantering. This week's clue works as follows:
Use all but one of the letters - but not the punctuation — in
the italicized sentence below to create a new sentence. This new
sentence is your third clue and your shot at instant fame.
Clue Number Three (Turn, Turn, Turn)
You will know what to do when you unscramble the clue:
Go look there, cats.
There, I said it. So put on your thinking cap, and get psyched
for the new world order. I think it's going to be the best world
order ever.
