Benny Goodman, the "King of
Swing," and his orchestra per
formed at an ASSU-sponsored
dance tonight. Students waited in
line overnight to buy tickets for
the "clarinet-tooter's" perfor
mance which sold out immediate
ly. (Before you laugh, remember
how quickly The New Kids on the
Block fill up stadiums.)
Tickets were so scarce that peo
ple were willing to try anything.
One student, who was skiing at
Yosemite the weekend before,
broke his leg. As he was being car
ried away in a stretcher, another
student rushed over.
"Would you be interested in
selling your ticket to the Benny
Goodman dance?" he asked hope
fully. Unfortunately, The Daily
was not able to print the injured
skier's reply.

The Detroit Tigers officially
opened their spring training sea
son at Sunken Diamond. Tiger
hitters took their first batting
practice of the year, and eventual
Hall of Fame member Charlie
Gehringer almost hit a home run
his first time at bat.
While the Tigers had no game
scheduled, it seemed likely that
they would go nine innings with
the San Francisco and Oakland
minor league teams. (Remember
when the farthest team west of
the Mississippi was the St. Louis
Cardinals, the greatest sports
team in the history of the uni
verse?)
The Daily congratulated Stan
ford for landing the big leaguers,
which would be sure to give it
prominence. Perhaps "the average
man in the East . . . may never
again believe [Stanfordl to be in
Southern California."
