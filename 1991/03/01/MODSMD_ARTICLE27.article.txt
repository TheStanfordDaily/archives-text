# Wasted away in Tuna-Coladaville: Blame it on the punch
## 
### Ken Wharton Staff writer 
Along, long time ago, when
human civilization was just getting
started, some witless fool acciden
tally discovered alcohol and immediately
set us back thousands of years.
When I consider this formidable hand
icap, I find it amazing that we've pro
gressed to the point where we can pro
duce mail-order chia pets, but still
haven't changed our basic habits of alco
hol consumption. Sure, we've made some
advances over the drinking methods of
our primitive ancestors — such as vodka
jello — but the basic theme remains the

same: You drink, you get drunk, you
vomit repeatedly.
As fun and exciting as this sounds,
drinking does have one major flaw: Alco
hol tastes worse than most substances
coughed up by lizards.
And so people have spent vast
amounts of time coming up with new
concoctions that balance the need for
high alcohol content with palatal plea
sure. However, these mixtures sometimes
fail horribly, as in the case of the Tuna
Colada.
This drink, which I swear I'm not
making up, consists of three types of
liquor (Liquor? I don't even know her!), a
Hershey's Kiss and real tuna fish. Yeah,

it's disgusting, but it's better than a
Lasagna Daiquiri.
Once people have found a drink that
they can stomach, they usually like to
drink it in a fun atmosphere. A typical
way to accomplish this is to play a drink
ing game that incorporates loud noises,
basic coordination and accelerated
destruction of brain cells.
One such game which I read about in
Newsweek (the nation's primary source
of hedonistic activities) is the Persian
Gulf Party Game. The rules were a little
vague, but apparently the game involves
watching televised war coverage, mock
ing Dan Rather and chugging a beer
every time somebody says "Scud."

Qf course, getting hammered isn't just
a one-stage event. Here are some of the
different levels of drunkenness:
• Buzzed: At this point, the alcohol
has just begun to take effect, making you
happier and lowering your inhibitions.
This leaves you in the dangerous state of
being sober enough to have most of your
motor coordination, but inebriated
enough to want to try to climb Hoover
Tower.
• Drunk: This common phase is
noticeably marked by loudness, beer gog
gling and trying to convince everyone
that you've hardly had anything to drink.
• Comatose: Hopefully, someone has
managed to force-feed you lots of water

before this occurs.
The only problem is that by the time
you wake up, your head will probably feel
like it's been the subject of some bizarre
experiment in the Stern Hall kitchen
which attempted to create the world's
first multi-colored, vegetarian entree
that wiggles as you eat it.
In order to prevent this, you might
want to try out a famous "hangover
cure," which has been known to include
large amounts of aspirin, getting drunk
all over again and sacrificing small
rodents in the middle of the Quad.
Of course, you could take the easy way
out, and simply not drink in the first
place. After all, there's always the jello.
