## Women's swimming starts off Pac-10 meet with a bang 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
FEDERAL WAY, Wash. — After combining for
seven gold medals at the King County Aquatics Cen
ter in last summer's Goodwill Games, one would
think Janet Evans, Janel Jorgensen, and Summer
Sanders would have fond memories of the pool.
And after Evans won the 500-yard freestyle and
Sanders and Jorgensen tied for the title in the 200

individual medley to open the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships at the same pool last night, the fond
ness could only grow.
Paced by those performances and a victory in the
three-meter diving by Eileen Richetelli, the top
ranked Cardinal opened up an early lead in an effort
to win a fifth straight Pac-10 title.
After the first day, Stanford has 501 points.
Third-ranked California is second with 405, No. 6
UCIJ\ is third at 314.5 and Arizona is fourth at 268.

No. 5 USC (221.5), No. 16 Arizona State (214), Ore
gon State (128), Washington (92) and Washington
State (89) round out the field.
Stanford's Eva Mortensen and Sionainn Marcoux
qualified for the NCAA championships, bringing
Stanford's total of qualified swimmers to 14. Barb
Metz and Jody Smith also added consideration times
in the 500 freestyle, adding that to the events which
they can swim at NCAAs.
A swimmer has to go under the primary time in
one event to qualify for the NCAA meet, but once she
does she only has to surpass the slower consideration
times to swim in additional events. Metz and Smith
had already qualified in other events.
The team of Jorgensen, Sanders, Michelle
Griglione and Suzy Buckovich took second in the 200
freestyle relay to open the meet. Then Evans,
Mortensen and Marcoux went one-three-five in the
500 freestyle.
In the morning qualifying for the 200 IM, Sanders
posted the top time, .01 seconds ahead of Jorgensen.
Jorgensen, the defending NCAA champ in the 100
and 200 butterflies and the 200 IM, expected to get a
lot of competition from her freshman teammate.
Sanders won the 200 butterfly and both IMs at the
Goodwill Games.
The first time they raced together this year, Jor
gensen beat Sanders in the 100 butterfly. The second
time, Sanders returned the favor in a 200 butterfly
race. So in their third meeting, of course, they tied.
Both came in at 2:00.38 to break the Pac-10 meet
record, formerly held by Buckovich, by more than
two seconds.
"It was pretty fun," Jorgensen said. "All season
long we've never really swam next to each other. It's
humorous it turned out the way it did."
Susan Johnson, who hails from only a few min
utes north of the pool, completed the sweep by fin
ishing third in front of family and friends while
Griglione grabbed fifth.
The highlight of the morning preliminaries was
the sixth heat of the 500 freestvle. Evans was in lane

four, and Mortensen and Marcoux were in three and
two. Marcoux set the early pace as the trio pulled
away from the competition, but faltered at the end.
Evans won the heat, and Mortensen came in right
behind her in 4:46.98. That time qualified
Mortensen for the NCAA championships. When
asked about qualifying, Mortensen summed up what
it meant to her: "Relief. I, in a way, didn't care how
fast I swam as long as I made it," she said. "I wanted
to make it in the morning so I didn't have to worry
about it.
"Before the race I wished I could swim with some
one different for a change. On the other hand, I
knew Sionain was going for it, and I knew Janet was
going to be under the cut so I knew during the race
that I was going to make it."
Marcoux didn't go out quite as fast at night and
made her cut then. "I'm excited," the freshman said
about qualifying for her first NCAAs. "I felt pretty
confident but I know I can go faster 5ti11.... I swam it
a lot smarter."
Only Buckovich scored in the 50 freestyle for the
Cardinal, then Anne Mahoney, Lori Heisick, Sanders
and Buckovich nabbed second in the 400 medley
relay.
At the Pac-10 diving championships, in Pasadena,
Calif., Richetelli took first by a large margin. Kristin
Jensen placed third, and Melisa Kuller took fifth as
the Cardinal divers outscored all the other diving
squads.
Yesterday also marked the Stanford debut for
freshman Mary Edwards. She missed the entire
dual-meet season with injuries to both shoulders,
but has returned to action. She swam the 50
freestyle and had the second-fastest time of the
morning at 23.47, but missed qualifying for NCAAs
by a tenth of a second.
Stanford brought more swimmers to the meet
than the allowable number, so Edwards swam
unattached and was unable to swim in the finals of
the 50 freestyle. However, she did swim a time trial
last night, but missed the cut by .07 seconds.


Things are going swimmingly for the women's team. The Cardinal swimmers and divers are going for
yet another Pacific 10 Conference crown.

unattached and was unable to swim in the finals of
the 50 freestyle. However, she did swim a time trial
last night, but missed the cut by .07 seconds.


Things are going swimmingly for the women's team. The Cardinal swimmers and divers are going for
yet another Pacific 10 Conference crown.
FEDERAL WAY, Wash. — After combining for
seven gold medals at the King County Aquatics Cen
ter in last summer's Goodwill Games, one would
think Janet Evans, Janel Jorgensen, and Summer
Sanders would have fond memories of the pool.
And after Evans won the 500-yard freestyle and
Sanders and Jorgensen tied for the title in the 200

individual medley to open the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships at the same pool last night, the fond
ness could only grow.
Paced by those performances and a victory in the
three-meter diving by Eileen Richetelli, the top
ranked Cardinal opened up an early lead in an effort
to win a fifth straight Pac-10 title.
After the first day, Stanford has 501 points.
Third-ranked California is second with 405, No. 6
UCIJ\ is third at 314.5 and Arizona is fourth at 268.

No. 5 USC (221.5), No. 16 Arizona State (214), Ore
gon State (128), Washington (92) and Washington
State (89) round out the field.
Stanford's Eva Mortensen and Sionainn Marcoux
qualified for the NCAA championships, bringing
Stanford's total of qualified swimmers to 14. Barb
Metz and Jody Smith also added consideration times
in the 500 freestyle, adding that to the events which
they can swim at NCAAs.
A swimmer has to go under the primary time in
one event to qualify for the NCAA meet, but once she
does she only has to surpass the slower consideration
times to swim in additional events. Metz and Smith
had already qualified in other events.
The team of Jorgensen, Sanders, Michelle
Griglione and Suzy Buckovich took second in the 200
freestyle relay to open the meet. Then Evans,
Mortensen and Marcoux went one-three-five in the
500 freestyle.
In the morning qualifying for the 200 IM, Sanders
posted the top time, .01 seconds ahead of Jorgensen.
Jorgensen, the defending NCAA champ in the 100
and 200 butterflies and the 200 IM, expected to get a
lot of competition from her freshman teammate.
Sanders won the 200 butterfly and both IMs at the
Goodwill Games.
The first time they raced together this year, Jor
gensen beat Sanders in the 100 butterfly. The second
time, Sanders returned the favor in a 200 butterfly
race. So in their third meeting, of course, they tied.
Both came in at 2:00.38 to break the Pac-10 meet
record, formerly held by Buckovich, by more than
two seconds.
"It was pretty fun," Jorgensen said. "All season
long we've never really swam next to each other. It's
humorous it turned out the way it did."
Susan Johnson, who hails from only a few min
utes north of the pool, completed the sweep by fin
ishing third in front of family and friends while
Griglione grabbed fifth.
The highlight of the morning preliminaries was
the sixth heat of the 500 freestvle. Evans was in lane

four, and Mortensen and Marcoux were in three and
two. Marcoux set the early pace as the trio pulled
away from the competition, but faltered at the end.
Evans won the heat, and Mortensen came in right
behind her in 4:46.98. That time qualified
Mortensen for the NCAA championships. When
asked about qualifying, Mortensen summed up what
it meant to her: "Relief. I, in a way, didn't care how
fast I swam as long as I made it," she said. "I wanted
to make it in the morning so I didn't have to worry
about it.
"Before the race I wished I could swim with some
one different for a change. On the other hand, I
knew Sionain was going for it, and I knew Janet was
going to be under the cut so I knew during the race
that I was going to make it."
Marcoux didn't go out quite as fast at night and
made her cut then. "I'm excited," the freshman said
about qualifying for her first NCAAs. "I felt pretty
confident but I know I can go faster 5ti11.... I swam it
a lot smarter."
Only Buckovich scored in the 50 freestyle for the
Cardinal, then Anne Mahoney, Lori Heisick, Sanders
and Buckovich nabbed second in the 400 medley
relay.
At the Pac-10 diving championships, in Pasadena,
Calif., Richetelli took first by a large margin. Kristin
Jensen placed third, and Melisa Kuller took fifth as
the Cardinal divers outscored all the other diving
squads.
Yesterday also marked the Stanford debut for
freshman Mary Edwards. She missed the entire
dual-meet season with injuries to both shoulders,
but has returned to action. She swam the 50
freestyle and had the second-fastest time of the
morning at 23.47, but missed qualifying for NCAAs
by a tenth of a second.
Stanford brought more swimmers to the meet
than the allowable number, so Edwards swam
unattached and was unable to swim in the finals of
the 50 freestyle. However, she did swim a time trial
last night, but missed the cut by .07 seconds.
