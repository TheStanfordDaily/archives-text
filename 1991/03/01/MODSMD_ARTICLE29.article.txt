# Hobbled Stevens still leads Cardinal
## 
### David Hirning Senior staff writer 
With all that she's gone
through the past few years, and
all she's accomplished, one would
think that Trisha Stevens would
be ready to hang them up at sea
son's end. An incredible career,
but still one that is best left at the
collegiate level.
However, anyone who thinks
that obviously doesn't know
Trisha Stevens.
The Cardinal senior, who last
year led Stanford in scoring and
guided the team to an NCAA title,
has battled with tendinitis in her

knees all season long. But despite
the pain and her post-Stanford
aspirations of medical school,
Stevens is still planning on having
a pro career when she leaves the
Farm. Those who know her have
no doubt that she'll succeed.
Tara VanDerveer, who has con
sidered herself fortunate to coach
Stevens for the last four years,
knows her quite well. But even
the meticulous VanDerveer can't
fully express her feelings about
the senior co-captain. "It's hard to
put into words how incredibly spe
cial Trisha is," VanDerveer said.
Asked to pick one word, the
Cardinal coach came up with

"heart." "She plays through a lot
of things that average players
wouldn't," she said. "Trisha's a
classic â€” she's everything you
want in a player."
To watch Stevens is to see the
size of that heart in everything
she does. Although she cannot
practice much at all because of her
injury, it does not stop her from
being on the sidelines to give an
encouraging word (or a good
natured raspberry) to her team
mates. Even when she is unable to
play, Stevens still tries to give the
young team leadership it needs.
"If I'm sore and I can't do
things the way they should be
done, I lead emotionally and men
tally," Stevens said. "I try to lead
by example in those areas."
Her attitude alone is extremely
important to the Cardinal's suc
cess. "We miss her personality as
much as anything else," Van-
Derveer noted. "She'll tease
Sonja, keep things loose. She's en
upbeat, enthusiastic person."
Of course, the team would
much rather see her out on the
court, where Stevens is scoring
13.2 points per contest despite
averaging just a little over 11
shots and 20 minutes a game. The
6-foot-3 Stevens has numerous
post moves in her repertoire and
knows what to do with the ball

once she gets it.
"She's a 'black hole' out there,"
VanDerveer said. "The ball goes
in, and it doesn't come back out."
And it usually ends up in the
hoop; the conference's leading
shooter last season, Stevens has a
stellar career shooting mark of
53.9 percent.
Stevens' presence on the low
block brought Stanford basketball
to a new level, one that has pro
duced four 20-win seasons and an
NCAA title. "When we got Trisha,
that's when we got good," Van-
Derveer said simply.
Now, hampered by an injury
that limits her ability to jump,
stop quickly, cut . . . everything
basketball players must do,
Stevens still contributes to a Top
10 squad. Without the injury, the
senior would be a lock for All-
America honors.
"Even when she's not healthy,
she's still a force on the court,"
teammate Chris MacMurdo.
"Could you imagine what she
would be like healthy? We're talk
ing 30-40 points per game."
But oh, how VanDerveer,
Stevens, and the rest of the Cardi
nal like to imagine!
This was not the way it was
supposed to be for Stevens, in her
senior vear. Her tendinitis was

Senior Trisha Stevens had been the heart and soul of the Cardinal
throughout her tenure on the Farm. Despite a case of acute tendini
tis that has kept her out of action, Stevens has remained the Inspi
rational leader of the 1991 squad.
something that had developed
throughout her career, stemming
from her days in high school when
she was a three-sport star in bas
ketball, volleyball, and track
(Stevens was a four-time state
champion high-jumper). But it
had never kept her out of practice
for an extended period or forced
her to miss a game.
After last season, Stevens
talked to several people who had
had surgery for the same problem
and had come back much
improved, including former Stan
ford center Jill Yanke and current
Cardinal assistant Amy Tucker.
She decided to try to ease some of
her pain and put some more fun
back into her game.
In Stevens' case, however, the
surgery has had almost the oppo
site effect. In her haste to come
back from the spring operation,
Stevens might have "gone a little
crazy on the (exercise) bike" and
prevented the knees from fully
healing. The result has been a
continuous cycle playing and pain
followed by rest and recovery.
"(Her condition) is totally dif
ferent from last year,' Van-
Derveer said. "She never missed a
game because of it last year.
This year, Stevens has missed
three entire games and played less
than 13 minutes in three more.

She is currently resting up for the
NCAA tournament, playing in
every other game for the last six.
She credits her teammates for
helping her deal with the frustrat
ing situation.
"I didn't even consider the pos
sibility that it could be worse
(after surgery)," Stevens said.
"But although I'm not doing as
well as I could be, (my teammates)
keep me hanging in there."
And somehow, when the Cardi
nal has needed her, Stevens has
been there for them. It will be
hard for anyone to top what she
did in her first game back from
the surgery (she skipped the one
exhibition game), scoring 28
points and pulling down 10
rebounds in the televised season
opener against Tennessee.
"Trisha's a big game player,"
VanDerveer said.
Ever the competitor, Stevens is
looking forward to the NCAA
tournament and the chance to
defend the title that she helped
bring to Stanford last year.
"I think she'll find a way to be
on the court in the tournament,"
MacMurdo said. "But if she can't,
she'll be cheering her butt off
from the sidelines."
Indeed, Stevens is the team's
biggest cheerleader on the bench,
even in street clothes. Watching
her, it's sometimes hard to see the
pain that constantly accompanies
the Philomath, Ore., native. That
is, unless you have the privilege of
knowing Trisha Stevens.
