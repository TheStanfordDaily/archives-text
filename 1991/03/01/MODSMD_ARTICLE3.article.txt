# New investigation to assess Navy's blame on cost issues
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
The Navy has launched yet another
investigation related to Stanford's indi
rect cost practices, this time to determine
if any Navy officials will be forced to walk
the plank for their lax oversight of the
University during the last decade.
Rear Adm. William Miller, the chief of
naval research, announced yesterday that
he had formed a five-person panel to

determine which Office of Naval
Research employees were responsible for
problems highlighted in a Navy report
issued earlier this month.
That report, commissioned by the
Inspector General of the Office of Naval
Research, dismissed Navy regulator Paul
Biddle's claim that Stanford had over
billed the government by $200 million
during the last decade. But the report
found there was "a potential for overpay
ment" resulting from the Navy's lax over

sight.
According to the report, Office of
Naval Research representatives assigned
to Stanford did not consistently follow
standard government procedures in their
dealings with the University during the
last decade.
The Office of Naval Research is
responsible for negotiating with the Uni
versity to determine how much overhead
the government should pay on federally
sponsored research projects here.

Biddle is the current representative of
the Office of Naval Research assigned to
Stanford. He has charged that those who
held his job prior to his arrival in October
1988 were too "cozy" with Stanford offi
cials, allowing the University to overbill
the government.
The newly-created Navy investigative
panel is expected to issue a report by April
25, according to a statement released by
the Navy. The panel "will pursue all rele
vant information, including action of all

officials employed by the Office of Naval
Research from 1980 to the present," the
statement says.
Stanford's indirect cost policies are
also under investigation by the Naval
Investigative Service, the General
Accounting Office and the House Sub
committee on Oversight and Investiga
tions. The Naval Investigative Service is
looking into the possibility of criminal
wrongdoing.
