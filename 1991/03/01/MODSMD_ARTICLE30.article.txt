TONIGHT — Stanford travels across the Bay to Harmon Gym for a
rematch with the Bears After a ceremony for the Cal seniors, the rematch
will begin at 7:40. TV PSN (cable). Radio: KZSU Radio At Fault 90.1 FM
with "invited guest" Brett Battles calling the action
RECORDS — No 10 Stanford (214, 14-1 and Ist in the Pac 10) and Cal
(7-8, 14-11 and sixth
CARDINAL RULES — Although Stanford must win its last three games to
assure itself of an outright conference title and a high seed in the
tournament, all are against teams with sub .500 Pac-10 records. The
Cardinal has been getting superlative play from forward Val Whiting and
guard Sonja Henning in the last few weeks.
INJURY UPDATE — Stanford may be without the services of two top players,
as center Tricia Stevens could see little or no action as she rests
her knees for the NCAA tournament and guard Molly Goodenbour
is extremely doubtful with a stress fracture in her foot.
