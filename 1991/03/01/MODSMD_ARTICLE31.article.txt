# Both on and off the court, Patrick has come a long way
## 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
Tomorrow afternoon, just a
few minutes before the Stanford
men's basketball team takes on
California, senior John Patrick
will walk on the floor at Maples
Pavilion and think back on his
career.
As he stands on the floor with
his father during a ceremony to
honor the Cardinal seniors —
Patrick, Kenny Ammann, Deshon
Wingate and Andrew Vlahov —
Patrick will think of all he's been
through in the last four years, the
highlights and the things he'd
rather forget.
He'll think of the two long
years with no playing time; and
he'll think of how he came on to
start for two years at point guard.
He'll think of the drills, the
two-mile runs and the meetings
that lasted forever; and he'll think
how lucky he was to live out his
dream of plaving college basket
ball.
And maybe, just maybe, as he
stands there on the court before
his final home game, Patrick will
look back on his career. . . . and
remember the time his coach
wanted to kill him.
It all happened way back in
1987, when Patrick was a fresh
man and the Cardinal was in
Hawaii to open the season at the
Maui Classic. Stanford lost to
lowa 78-75 in its opening game,
and, well. ...
"I hadn't gotten to play against
lowa," Patrick says,"(and) I was
upset about the game. I was going
to go blow off some steam before
the game against Chaminade."

And how does one blow off
steam in Hawaii? Very good;
swimming. And so, since Patrick
was fairly sure he wouldn't be
playing anyway, he grabbed his
trunks and headed out.
Unfortunately, Patrick didn't
bother to check what Stanford
coach Mike Montgomery was
doing at the time. If he had,
maybe he would have noticed that
Montgomery was taking a stroll
along the beach.
"I'd just borrowed a man's
snorkeling gear and was headed
into the water, and I guess [Mont
gomery! saw me," Patrick says."I
jumped in (of course!), and I was
underwater, checking out the fish
— there were some great fish —
and all the scenery. I'd never done
that before.
"Then I came up out of the
water, and I was walking back,
and the first thing I saw was
Montgomery, with his hands on
his hips, kind of squinting to see if
it was me. I had flippers on, and I
came walking onto the beach, and
he couldn't believe his eyes. I
knew I'd been nailed." Like cheap
wood.
"I'm sure his attitude was
'Well, I dqn't play,' but we don't
have rules for just the people who
play," Montgomery says. "You just
don't swim when you have a
game."
Especially not 10 minutes
before the bus is supposed to
leave.
Montgomery calmly and
politely (ahem) explained the rule
to Patrick — to his credit, he
didn't tell Patrick to swim back to
Stanford — and that was it.
In an amazing coincidence,

Patrick didn't play much the rest
of the year.
"A lot of people got a kick out of
it, hut it kind of killed my chances
to play freshman year," Patrick
says.
"Don't silvercoat it, Patrick,"
interrupts Montgomery, who goes
right into an impression of the
young Patrick whistling his way
along the beach — and rolls his
eyes in disgust.
"Hey, I've come a long way,
though," Patrick says.
"Oh yeah," Montgomery
replies. "I just say it's a good ol'
freshman story."
"I don't really want to be
remembered by that, though,"
Patrick smiles.
There are probably a few other
things Stanford fans will remem

ber about Patrick They'll remem
ber his two years as a starter at
the point: Last year Patrick aver
aged 7.7 points and 3.8 assists per
game, and the numbers are up to
9.8 and 4.0 this season.
They'll also remember his
marksmanship: Patrick's three
point perecentage of .456 is No. 2
in the Pacific 10 Conference, and
his free-throw percentage of .842
would lead the league if he had
enough attempts.
"I came in here this summer
with Ammann at about six in the
morning every day," Patrick says.
"We'd shoot, and he'd make 90
percent of his three-pointers and
I'd make 80. It was great for me to
shoot with him: He's the most

pure shooter I've ever shot with. .
. .I'm capable of shooting about 50
percent (in games). Kenny's capa
ble of about 80."
More than Patrick's marks
manship, however, the fans at
Maples — and Montgomery —
will remember the improvement
they've seen in him.
"[Patrickl didn't get to play at
all his first two years, because of
the three guys ahead of him (Todd
Lichti, Terry Taylor and Scott
Meinert) and because we weren't
seeing in practice what we needed
to see from him," Montgomery
says."I don't think he felt real
confident in practice."
"I was frustrated (my first two
years), and there were times when
I'd think what it would be like to
be other places," Patrick says."I
think everyone who doesn't get to
play does that. But I was guarding
Lichti every day in practice, and I
knew I was improving.
"I got to where he could still
jump over me and shoot, but I
could stick with him, and I was
getting stronger."
That time turned out to be last
year, after Lichti, Taylor and
Mainert all left — Lichti for the
Denver Nuggets of the NBA.
Talk about a big hole to fill.
"[Patrick'sl junior year there was

a big change — it was basically
him and Kenny," Montgomery
says."And he came on and did a
good job, better than anyone
thought he could do."
Of course, he hadn't really
done it alone. "The guys on the
team had been so supportive, even
the guys who were playing in
front of me," Patrick says.
"That was a really good thing,
because I think on some teams
there's a breakdown between the
guys who play and the guys who
don't and there's some resent
ment. I never felt that here.
"That was a positive experi
ence, and when I look back on it I
wish I'd played — playing is great
— but it was good for me."
Now that the dream is almost
over, Patrick will be looking ahead
to new dreams — playing in
Europe (or, for that matter, any
where else) as long as he can.
While he does that, though, he'll
still look back on these four years
— from the beach in Hawaii to his
final game at Maples.
"My freshman year if you'd
told me we'd go down to UCLA
two straight times and spank
them I would have thought that
was incredible," Patrick says. "As
a whole, the things I'll remember
most about this year are the guys
on the team, how hard we've
worked and that we've stuck
together without pointing fingers.
That would have been easy, since
we had such high expectations."
