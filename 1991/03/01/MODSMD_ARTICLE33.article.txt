# Catcher Tallman brings quiet leadership to Stanford baseball
## 
### Michelle Ghert Staff writer 
Power at the plate has led the Stanford baseball
team to a 16-3 record, 3-0 in the Pac-10. But power
behind the plate has also played a key role in the Car

dinal nine dominance.
Troy Tallman is Stanford's starting catcher for
the second straight season. According to coach Mark
Marquess, the junior from Napa, Calif, is one of the
top catchers in the Pac-10, as well as in the country.
"Not only is he an outstanding defensive catcher,

but we expect greater offensive production from his
this year," Marquess said. "This season he's catching
well and hitting pretty well too."
While Tallman hit a respectable .286 with 10
home runs and 33 RBl's last year, the second half of
his season was tremendous. In his final 36 games,
including nine in the postseason, Tallman hit .345
with seven homers and 25 RBI.
"The thing about starting off the season slow,
that's been pretty much the case since I've been
here," Tallman said. "Freshman year, the whole year
was slow. Last year started off slow too. At one point
I wasn't even hitting .200, and then the second half
I started to hit better, and it kinda snowballed from
there."
Tallman's "slow" start this season has given him
a .273 average with 13 runs scored and 11 RBI.
"He's going to get better," Marquess said. "He's
not in a real groove yet. He's worked hard, and he'll
get better at the bat.
"I'm not real worried where I am right now," Tail
man said. "As long as I can keep driving in runs and
helping the team that way. I think my average will
come up as the season progresses, that seems to be
the pattern in which I hit."
While Tallman feels that he gets more comfort
able at the plate as the season moves on, his confi
dence behind the plate is consistent all year.
"I enjoy being catcher," Tallman said. "You get to
be involved in the entire game. Everyone gets to
work with the catcher. Everyone is looking to him for
the play."
Marquess agrees that Tallman's role as catcher
forces him into a leadership role.
"He's most definitely a team leader," Marquess
said. "He's in a position where you really have to
take that leadership out of him because he's a

catcher, and everybody is really looking to him. He
provides us with that leadership. He works with the
pitchers really well."
