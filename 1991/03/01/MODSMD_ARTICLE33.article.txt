# Catcher Tallman brings quiet leadership to Stanford baseball
## 
### Michelle Ghert Staff writer 
Power at the plate has led the Stanford baseball
team to a 16-3 record, 3-0 in the Pac-10. But power
behind the plate has also played a key role in the Car

dinal nine dominance.
Troy Tallman is Stanford's starting catcher for
the second straight season. According to coach Mark
Marquess, the junior from Napa, Calif, is one of the
top catchers in the Pac-10, as well as in the country.
"Not only is he an outstanding defensive catcher,

but we expect greater offensive production from his
this year," Marquess said. "This season he's catching
well and hitting pretty well too."
While Tallman hit a respectable .286 with 10
home runs and 33 RBl's last year, the second half of
his season was tremendous. In his final 36 games,
including nine in the postseason, Tallman hit .345
with seven homers and 25 RBI.
"The thing about starting off the season slow,
that's been pretty much the case since I've been
here," Tallman said. "Freshman year, the whole year
was slow. Last year started off slow too. At one point
I wasn't even hitting .200, and then the second half
I started to hit better, and it kinda snowballed from
there."
Tallman's "slow" start this season has given him
a .273 average with 13 runs scored and 11 RBI.
"He's going to get better," Marquess said. "He's
not in a real groove yet. He's worked hard, and he'll
get better at the bat.
"I'm not real worried where I am right now," Tail
man said. "As long as I can keep driving in runs and
helping the team that way. I think my average will
come up as the season progresses, that seems to be
the pattern in which I hit."
While Tallman feels that he gets more comfort
able at the plate as the season moves on, his confi
dence behind the plate is consistent all year.
"I enjoy being catcher," Tallman said. "You get to
be involved in the entire game. Everyone gets to
work with the catcher. Everyone is looking to him for
the play."
Marquess agrees that Tallman's role as catcher
forces him into a leadership role.
"He's most definitely a team leader," Marquess
said. "He's in a position where you really have to
take that leadership out of him because he's a

catcher, and everybody is really looking to him. He
provides us with that leadership. He works with the
pitchers really well."

as a role model who is especially
willing to help out.
"He likes to motivate us when
guys come out down for the third
or fourth game in a row," Sugar
man said. "To the younger guys,
especially the catchers like myself
and Bryan Taylor, he gives us
advice and tells us where we're
doing things wrong."
Tallman brushes off compli
ments of his leadership abilities,
attributing his self-assurance to
his three years of experience on
the Farm.
"I think that everybody that's
been in the program for three
years is some kind of a leader in
the fact that they've just been
around longer," Tallman said.
"They've gone through what the
younger guys are just now going
through."
Not considering himself the
"rah-rah" type, Tallman doesn't
yell and scream to encourage the
team.
"I personally don't think
there's a need for that most of the
time," Tallman said. "My whole
approach is that if 1 see some
body's having a hprd time who I
think needs to be prodded, then
I'll go ahead and say 'this is the
way it should be done,' or 'this is
what you can expect from such
and such a team.'"

Tallman's experience with
many teams extends back to high
school and beyond. After batting
.390 in high school, he was
ranked as the seventh-best high
school prospect by Baseball Amer
ica in 1988 and also ranked
among the top six catching
prospects by Collegiate baseball.
He would have been first-round
draft choice in the 1988 June
Major League draft if he hadn't
already signed a national letter
of-intent to play baseball at Stan
ford.
"It has always been a dream
for me to play for a major col
lege," Tallman said. "And then to
get the opportunity to play at
Stanford was really exciting."
At the end of his junior season,
Tallman will against be eligible
for the Major League draft, but he
is trying to remain focused on the
the task at hand.
"I'm trying not to look past the
season too much," Tallman said.
"It's going to be an exciting time.
Hopefully, if things go well and I
have a good year, I will definitely
seek the opportunity to play pro
ball."
As the Cardinal takes on the
University of Arizona in a three
game weekend series, Tallman
will continue to play his leader
ship role behind the plate, and
keep the "snowball" rolling at the
plate.
"He comes to play every game
hard," Marquess said. "He's a
real good example to us."

approach is that if 1 see some
body's having a hprd time who I
think needs to be prodded, then
I'll go ahead and say 'this is the
way it should be done,' or 'this is
what you can expect from such
and such a team.'"

Tallman's experience with
many teams extends back to high
school and beyond. After batting
.390 in high school, he was
ranked as the seventh-best high
school prospect by Baseball Amer
ica in 1988 and also ranked
among the top six catching
prospects by Collegiate baseball.
He would have been first-round
draft choice in the 1988 June
Major League draft if he hadn't
already signed a national letter
of-intent to play baseball at Stan
ford.
"It has always been a dream
for me to play for a major col
lege," Tallman said. "And then to
get the opportunity to play at
Stanford was really exciting."
At the end of his junior season,
Tallman will against be eligible
for the Major League draft, but he
is trying to remain focused on the
the task at hand.
"I'm trying not to look past the
season too much," Tallman said.
"It's going to be an exciting time.
Hopefully, if things go well and I
have a good year, I will definitely
seek the opportunity to play pro
ball."
As the Cardinal takes on the
University of Arizona in a three
game weekend series, Tallman
will continue to play his leader
ship role behind the plate, and
keep the "snowball" rolling at the
plate.
"He comes to play every game
hard," Marquess said. "He's a
real good example to us."
Power at the plate has led the Stanford baseball
team to a 16-3 record, 3-0 in the Pac-10. But power
behind the plate has also played a key role in the Car

dinal nine dominance.
Troy Tallman is Stanford's starting catcher for
the second straight season. According to coach Mark
Marquess, the junior from Napa, Calif, is one of the
top catchers in the Pac-10, as well as in the country.
"Not only is he an outstanding defensive catcher,

but we expect greater offensive production from his
this year," Marquess said. "This season he's catching
well and hitting pretty well too."
While Tallman hit a respectable .286 with 10
home runs and 33 RBl's last year, the second half of
his season was tremendous. In his final 36 games,
including nine in the postseason, Tallman hit .345
with seven homers and 25 RBI.
"The thing about starting off the season slow,
that's been pretty much the case since I've been
here," Tallman said. "Freshman year, the whole year
was slow. Last year started off slow too. At one point
I wasn't even hitting .200, and then the second half
I started to hit better, and it kinda snowballed from
there."
Tallman's "slow" start this season has given him
a .273 average with 13 runs scored and 11 RBI.
"He's going to get better," Marquess said. "He's
not in a real groove yet. He's worked hard, and he'll
get better at the bat.
"I'm not real worried where I am right now," Tail
man said. "As long as I can keep driving in runs and
helping the team that way. I think my average will
come up as the season progresses, that seems to be
the pattern in which I hit."
While Tallman feels that he gets more comfort
able at the plate as the season moves on, his confi
dence behind the plate is consistent all year.
"I enjoy being catcher," Tallman said. "You get to
be involved in the entire game. Everyone gets to
work with the catcher. Everyone is looking to him for
the play."
Marquess agrees that Tallman's role as catcher
forces him into a leadership role.
"He's most definitely a team leader," Marquess
said. "He's in a position where you really have to
take that leadership out of him because he's a

catcher, and everybody is really looking to him. He
provides us with that leadership. He works with the
pitchers really well."
Freshman catcher Jason Sugarman sees Tallman

Troy Tallman will be a key factor in the baseball team's drive for a national title. Tallman is hitting .273
on the year, with 13 runs scored and 11 RBl's.
as a role model who is especially
willing to help out.
"He likes to motivate us when
guys come out down for the third
or fourth game in a row," Sugar
man said. "To the younger guys,
especially the catchers like myself
and Bryan Taylor, he gives us
advice and tells us where we're
doing things wrong."
Tallman brushes off compli
ments of his leadership abilities,
attributing his self-assurance to
his three years of experience on
the Farm.
"I think that everybody that's
been in the program for three
years is some kind of a leader in
the fact that they've just been
around longer," Tallman said.
"They've gone through what the
younger guys are just now going
through."
Not considering himself the
"rah-rah" type, Tallman doesn't
yell and scream to encourage the
team.
"I personally don't think
there's a need for that most of the
time," Tallman said. "My whole
approach is that if 1 see some
body's having a hprd time who I
think needs to be prodded, then
I'll go ahead and say 'this is the
way it should be done,' or 'this is
