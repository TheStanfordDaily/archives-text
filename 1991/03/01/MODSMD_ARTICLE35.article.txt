# Volleyball hopes to end five-match skid against UCLA
## 
### Kevin Jeffery Staff writer 
Will somebody stop the bleeding,
please?
A disastrous five-match losing streak
has sent the Cardinal men's volleyball
team plummeting in the standings of the
Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Associ
ation standings and has left their once
•ertain spot in the postseason regional
tournament up for grabs.
Unfortunately, Stanford faces no easy
task of reversing their nosedive tomor
row night when they challenge sixth
ranked UCLA in Burnham Pavilion.

The streak has seen the Cardinal
digress from owning the WIVA's best
record (4-0) and the nation's number
four ranking, to owning fourth place in
the league's Harry Wilson division and a
No. 8 ranking.
Stanford, at 4-5 in WIVA play (5-6
overall), currently stands behind top
ranked USC, No. 2 Long Beach State,
and No. 5 San Diego State in the Wilson.
Only the top three teams in each of the
league's two division are guaranteed
berths in the postseason WIVA tourna
ment.
That puts the Cardinal's playoff hopes
in jeopardy. Now, rather than contending

for the division title, Stanford is battling
with Hawaii, UCSB, and UC-Irvine for
one of the tournament's two wild card
spots.
The Bruins enter tonight's match as
the Burt DeGroot division leader with a
5-1 WIVA record and a 5-4 overall mark.
Cal-State Northridge, at 5-2, has been
chasing them all year, and currently
trails by just one-half game. UCLA's lone
league setback came at the hands of
unbeaten (and maybe unbeatable) USC.
UCLA boasts one overwhelming
advantage over the Cardinal which will
be more than evident to everyone in
Burnham Pavilion tomorrow, that is.

height. In fact, the Bruins have what may
be the tallest team in NCAA history.
Freshman middle blocker Tim Kelly is
6-foot-10, and in addition to leading the
club in kills and blocks, he is ranked third
nationally with a .474 hitting percentage.
The Bruins also start 6-9 middle blocker
Mike Whitcomb and a pair of 6-7 outside
hitters, Aleksandar Babic and team dig
leader Carl Henkel. Even the Bruin's set
ter, Mike Sealy (6-7), has an inch or two
on every member of the Stanford lineup.
The Cardinal will at least have the
ghosts of ESPN games gone by on their
side. Tomorrow's match will be nation
ally televised (on tape delay) by the sports

network. Last year, in an ESPN-televised
match, Stanford claimed a dramatic, five
game, come-from-behind victory over
eventual national champion USC.
Perhaps they'll also be able reclaim
what is usually considered the advantage
of the home court. The Cardinal have
dropped their last two home matches in
the spacious confines of Maples Pavilion.
A win tomorrow over one of the
WIVA's division leaders would breathe
new life into the Cardinal and give them
a respectable .500 league record. Another
loss at home, and the extension of the
streak, will probably leave them wonder
ing if it will ever end.
