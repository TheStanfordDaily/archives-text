# Tennis to play at doubles tourney
## 
### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
A scary rumor is spreading
around the NCAA men's ten
nis circuit these days. It stands
a little over six feet tall, has
shaggy blonde hair and serves
100-plus mile per hour fire
balls. To most of the NCAA, it
spells disaster. To the Stanford
Cardinal, it spells R-E-L-I-E-F.
For those still watching war
coverage, Jonathan Stark is
back and, if all goes well this
weekend, so is the Stanford
men's tennis team.
Stark will lead a six-member
Stanford contingent into the
Pacific Coast Doubles Tourna
ment in La Jolla, Ca. today
through Sunday. Stark and his
doubles partner, Jared Palmer,
are the defending champions
at the tournament.
After last week's 5-2 semifi
nal loss to USC in the National
Team Indoors, Stark's three
month absence hurt more than
ever. Stark, who has been both
ered by a foot injury since April

of last year, is Stanford's No. 1
singles threat as well as one of
the top two doubles players on
the team. Many consider Stark
to be the best player in the
NCAA. He was ranked No. 1 in
singles (and doubles) by the
Volvo Tennis/Collegiate Rank
ings at the beginning of the
year.
Joining Stark will be Stan
ford's present No. 1 doubles
team of Alex O'Brien and
Jason Yee. Yee and O'Brien are
the defending Pacific 10 Con
ference doubles champions.
Doubles specialist Dan Turbow
will combine with freshman
Chris Cocotos to form another
team, while freshmen Michael
Flanagan and Robert Devins
will round out the squad.
According to Coach Dick
Gould, this tournament will
give all the doubles teams good
match experience as the Cardi
nal preps for a four-match
homestand, which kicks off
Wednesday against West Vir
ginia.
