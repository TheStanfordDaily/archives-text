# Gym hosts Spartans
## 
### Brandi Shipp Staff writer 
After two big away meets, the
Stanford women's gymnastics
team plans to rock Maples Pavil
ion tonight as they host the gym
nasts from San Jose State Univer
sity.
For the first time this season,
Stanford's male and female gym
nasts will be competing together.
While the women face off against
San Jose State, the men will try to
come out with victories over San
Jose State as well as the Univer
sity of Michigan.
The gymnasts expect some
great things to come out of
tonight's competition. "We are
real excited about this weekend.
The girls are going to be throwing
a lot of new skills, and are really
pumped," coach Breck Greenwood
said. The gymnasts of San Jose
State, despite consistently scoring
between 175.0 and 183.0 points,
do not pose as much of a threat for
the Stanford team. The Cardinal
women are coming off of an
incredible exhibition in Oregon
last weekend, which earned them
188.35 points, the highest point
total ever.
With only two weeks to go, the
Stanford team is practicing with
visions of the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Championships in their
heads. "Right now, we are really
training for the Pac-lOs," Green
wood said. "We have decided to up
our difficulty level in prepara
tion."
The team has made some major
overhauls in routines, especially
on bars and floor, which will be
performed for the first time
tonight. Two of the incredible
freshman leaders, Kerri Kanuka
and Kerrie Kelley, both will be
debuting new bar routines in
Maples. Freshman Mollie Brown

floor routine, and injured sopho-

more Erin McCann will be com
peting on floor for the first time
all season.
This added difficulty has
caused the team to make some
sacrifices. They are now training
harder then before, which, in
turn, makes them a little less
rested for meets like tonight's
competition. "We are physically
beat up, but mentally ready,"
Greenwood said. They are betting,
however, that these little sacri
fices now will pay off big later at
the Pac-lOs.
Their ranking in the Pac-10
conference has fluctuated fre
quently throughout the season.
Although they were once as high
as third, they are now in the very
deceiving number seven position.
Having had some good meets
against other Pac-10 teams
throughout the season, including
California, Washington, and Ari
zona, the Stanford women see a
move upward in the ranking well
within their reach. "We have
come pretty close to these teams;
we are looking to move into fifth
or fourth place," Greenwood said.
"That would be a big jump for us."
In terms of tonight, though,
the gymnasts hope to have a good
competition and come out with a
win, while working on their new
skills. With a double dose from
both the Stanford men and
women gymnasts, they hope to see
Maples packed tonight. "Hope
fully, we will have a large crowd
behind us," Kanuka said. "That
always helps to get the team
psyched up."
