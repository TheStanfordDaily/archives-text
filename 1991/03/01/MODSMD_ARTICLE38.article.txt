# Women's tennis squeaks by pesky Badgers

### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
When Teri Whitlinger and
Laxmi Poruri won their match at
No. 2 doubles yesterday, the Car
dinal seemed in control with a 4-2
lead over Wisconsin. Stanford,
winners of 73 straight matches
entering yesterday's action at the
National Team Indoors in Madi
son, Wis., had stumbled but cer
tainly would not fall.

Cardinal 5

Badgers 4

The unranked Badgers had
another idea, though. Their plan
was to capture the remaining
three matches and end the most
remarkable streak in the history
of college tennis.
Laughable, right? Well, let's
put it this way: When Mario Car
ruth pathetically squandered
three match points at 6-5 in the
third set of her marathon struggle
with Stephany Benz, the Cardinal
wasn't exactly in a jovial mood.

Carruth would end up losing 6-3,
1-6, 7-6 (7-3).
Suddenly, it was 4-3 Stanford
and scoreboard watchers began
muttering, "This could be the
upset of the decade." Why? Well
Sandra Birch and Debbie Graham
were down 7-5, 5-2 at No. 1 dou
bles, and coach Frank Brennan
decided "that match was a goner."
Then Brennan's eyes caught the
score at third doubles, and things
got really ugly. "I looked at the
scoreboard, and it read 6-4, 3-0
Wisconsin ... I was all ready to
give my end-of-the-streak
speech."
This time, at least, the coach
could put his notes for that speech
away. The red figures on the
scoreboard represented Wisconsin
in all the matches save one â€”
number three doubles. So it was
actually the Cardinal in control
and the all-important fifth point
seemed secure.
Until Heather Willens and
Emma Woodhouse managed to
drop the second set in a tiebreaker
to Holly Harris and Kristi
Thomas. Meanwhile, Jill Chullino
and Marya Neubauer closed out
Birch and Graham, the nation's

top team, to bring the knot the
overall match at 4-4.
One set at No. 3 doubles was all
that remained. The Cardinal tan
dem took an edge when Wood
house held to push the score to 5-
3. Harris served next and, after
countless deuces, double-faulted
twice in a row to give the Cardinal
the match and a 5-4 escape.
"That last game must have
gone on for 15 minutes," Brennan
said. "It was intense."
Of the day as a whole, Brennan
added: "Wisconsin played real
loose and real well. Meanwhile, we
didn't play all that badly, and I did
not feel like we were thinking
about the streak coming in. I
noticed that we did not warm up
well, but I didn't think it would
come down to this.
"We had good leads all day and
were in a position to salt it away
on a number of occasions, but give
credit to Wisconsin. They had
absolutely nothing to lose. We
were fortunate to win."
Things probably wouldn't have
been anywhere near as frighten
ing for Stanford had Brennan not
held Birch out of singles action.
To be fair, she does have a slight

thigh pull. Were it not for an
underestimation of the Badgers
tenacity, though, Birch would
have been in the lineup.
That may well have prevented
the three singles defeats. Though
Graham, Whitlinger and Poruri
all won in straight sets, Willens,
Carruth and Kylie Johnson all lost
in three. It was the first loss of the
season for each and raised the sea
son total of singles losses for Stan
ford from one to four.
Card notes
Yesterday marked only the eighth
time during the streak that the Cardi
nal was forced to play meaningful dou
bles, i.e. doubles that could determine
the outcome of the match. It was also
only the fifth 5-4 finale (one of those,
versus Pepperdine two years ago, was
deceptive since Stanford led 5-1 after
singles).
The Cardinal meets Oklahoma
State today at 2:30 p.m. (CST). In
other matches yesterday on Stan
ford's side of the draw, Georgia
thumped Pepperdine, 8-1 (the Bull
dogs should meet the Cardial Satur
day); Indiana knocked off USC, 5-3;
and the Cowgirls took out San Diego,
6-2.
