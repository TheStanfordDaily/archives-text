# Track heads to Irvine
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Staff writer 
How would you like to fly to
San Diego, drive up to Irvine
for a track meet, return to San
Diego and fly back to the Bay
Area, all in the same day?
That is what the Stanford
track team had to do last year
due to flight hassles just to
compete against CSU-
Northridge and UC-Irvine.
Despite the horrendous travel
conditions the team won in a
blowout.
This year the travel should
be better, and so should the
competition. On Saturday, the
team will also face a powerful
USC squad. How powerful,
you ask? The last time the Car
dinal men beat the Trojans,
Jesse Owens had yet to win
four gold medals in the 1936
Olympics.
Track coach Brooks John
son considers the Irvine meet a
"historical opportunity to
break the 67-year jinx." John
son also views the meet as a
good opportunity to gauge how
the track program has pro
gressed in developing competi
tive dual meet teams.

The key to victory is to neu
tralize USC's strength in
sprints. "They have great bal
listic people in sprint and field
events," Johnson said.
On the women's side Stan
ford will counter with its ver
sion of a missile, Chryste
Gaines. She will run in three
events, the 100 and 200 meters
and the 4xloo relay. She
expects to run well Saturday
but is concentrating on the
NCAA Indoor Championships
next weekend.
"Mainly, I've been working
on strength, and I've been
working on my start for
indoors," Gaines said.
The men's team plans to
counter the Trojan's explosive
speed with endurance. "We
have to use our middle dis
tance superiority to win,"
Johnson said. He also empha
sized that the team has to
score well in long distance
events in order to win.
Stanford's top long jumper,
Marcus Hickerson, is expected
to compete in Irvine after sit
ting out last weekend's NorCal
Relays to nurse his ham
strings.
