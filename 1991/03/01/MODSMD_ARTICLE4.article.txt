# Prof. overcomes disability, discrimination
## 
### Anita Presser Staff writer 
As a senior at Occidental College, Paul Long
more's academic adviser told him it was pointless to
go to graduate school because disabled people are
never hired as university professors.
Yesterday, Longmore's position as a visiting pro
fessor of history at Stanford was renewed for a sec
ond year.
Longmore, who was disabled by polio as a child
and doesn't have the use of his arms, said society
tends to devalue disabled people. Disabled people
are seen as "incapacitated socially and unable to
have normal relationships, hold a job, be romantic
and sexual — and cut off from life" by their disabil
ities, he said.
His disability doesn't really affect his teaching
and research, he said, but he has students write on
the board for him, and he usually employs a
research assistant to help him with library work.
Rut disabled students haven't always sought
him out.

across campus, and I saw a student in a wheelchair.

association or eye contact with
me," Longmore said.
"At first I was angry with him,
but then I remembered that when
I was in college, I avoided other
disabled students too," Longmore
added.
Most of the disabled students
at Stanford have never had the
opportunity to have friends with
disabilities, he said. In addition,
"To escape the stigma of a disabil
ity, many students with disabili
ties stay away from the Stanford
Disability Resource Center," he
said.
Longmore also said he would
like to see more interaction
among disabled and non-disabled
people. "If we are going to change
[discrimination] among people
with or without disabilities, we all
have to start to think" about dis
abilities, he added.
Stanford offers top services
and accessibility to students with
disabilities, Longmore said. "The
next step is in the area of faculty

and staff [recruitment]. So far,
there has been no affirmative
effort to recruit faculty with dis
abilities," he added.
Longmore said he personally
knows only one other disabled
professor here — Greg Guy in lin
guistics, who has an orthopedic
disability — although he added he
has heard of a few others.
He also said he adheres to the
idea that the disabled community
is a distinct minority that experi
ences the same oppression and
prejudices dealt with by other
minorities. The 70 percent unem
ployment rate in the disabled
community is an example of the
massive discrimination and phys
ical inaccessibility faced by people
with disabilities, he noted.
Disabled Stanford students
"will find it very hard to find jobs
despite their qualifications
because of the bias and discrimi
nation," said Longmore.
Despite the barriers he has
faced, Longmore said he sees his
disability as having a positive
effect on his life. "I like who I am
as a person with a disability," he
said.
