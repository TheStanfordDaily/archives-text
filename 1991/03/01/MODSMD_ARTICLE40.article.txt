# Men's gym hosts meet Will face Michigan, San Jose St.
## 
### Noah Blake Staff writer 
Now that there's no war news
on CNN to watch, going to see the
undefeated Stanford men's gym
nastics team's last home meet
might be a good way to spend your
Friday evening.
The Cardinal will welcome
Michigan and San Jose State to
Maples Pavilion at 7:30 tonight, in
what coach Sadao Hamada
expects to be more of an exhibi
tion than a competition.
"Winning is not a major con
cern of mine, as I know with my
best team on the floor this is no
problem," Hamada said. Indeed,
on Wednesday night against these
same two teams, Stanford had its
best lineup competing for only
three of the six rotations and still
won by almost two points.
Tonight, Hamada's best gym
nasts will compete for the entire
meet, as he wants to put up a
team score that will make the
country stand up and take notice
of the fourth-ranked Cardinal.
"I'd like to see more polished
routines, so we can come up with
bigger scores," said Hamada. "No

one can beat us once we start hit
ting those routines." A brave pre
diction? Yes, but so far this sea
son, his team's performance has
backed up his words.
"I think we could set some
school records tonight, especially
as we'll be really psyched up in
front of the home crowd,"
Hamada said. "It will be a really
good show for anyone who likes
Olympic gymnastics. We have a
lot of exciting routines, some of
which are of Olympic quality. I
expect the crowd will really enjoy
the meet."
Those people who do go to the
meet will have a chance to see the
return of Tim Ryan, perhaps the
Cardinal's best gymnast, who is
almost fully recovered from his
wrist and ankle injuries. Hamada
says that he expects Ryan to be
able to compete in five of six
events tonight and hopes that he
will soon be ready for the all
around.
It sounds like a great deal,
doesn't it? For a couple bucks, you
can see one of the best teams on
campus trying to get their highest
score of the season. And let's be
honest—do you really have any
thing better to do tonight?
