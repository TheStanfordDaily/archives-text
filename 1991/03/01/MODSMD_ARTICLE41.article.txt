You know that a tournament is going to be
a challenge when one of the top players
describes it with an adjective like "brutal."
That's exactly how junior Audrey Wooding
of the Stanford women's golf team character
ized the San Jose State Invitational, which
runs today, Saturday, and Sunday at the Fort
Ord golf course in Monterey.
"It's a very challenging courseâ€”it requires
a lot of concentration," said Wooding.
"It's probably one of the most difficult

courses we play all year. It can really intimi
date you if you let it," added junior Adele
Moore.
The difficulty of the course, combined with
a strong tournament field, will provide a good
test for the sixth-ranked Cardinal women. In
addition to No. 1-ranked host team San Jose
State, the competition includes No. 3 UCLA,
No. 5 Furman, No. 10 Texas, and No. 13 SMU.
The team has a good attitude going into the
match. "As a team, we should finish in the top
three. Individually, four of our players are
capable of finishing in the top ten, and the fifth
is really improving," said Wooding.

Stanford is looking to regain its momentum
from the fall season. The squad had won a
tourney in Seattle, placed second in Albu
querque, and third in their own Stanford tour
nament, but then in their first winter match in
Arizona, the Cardinal finished a disappointing
ninth.
The team, consisting of Wooding, Moore,
Jodi Figley, Stephanie Davis, and Melinda
Daniels, expects a much better performance
this weekend.
"It looks like it'll be a rainy weekend, and
we bear down and play well in the rain," Moore
said.
