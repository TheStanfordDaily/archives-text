# Hearings officer misses elections ruling meeting
## 
### Howard Libit Staff writer 
A special meeting of ASSU
senators scheduled to discuss
last night the controversial
elections rulings of hearings
officer Doreen Musson did not
take place as planned.
About 10 ASSU senators
expected to question Musson,
who has yet to be confirmed in
her position, at 8 p.m. last
night. Musson, however, said
she was told that the meeting
was at 6 p.m. and missed every
one.
"It was a total misunder
standing," Musson said. She
added that she plans to
reschedule an informal meeting
with ASSU senators before
next week's meeting to discuss
her various rulings.

Musson has come under fire
recently for her ruling that can
didates may be held liable —
and could possibly be disquali
fied — if their names appear in
any student publication before
the start of campaign week.
At the end of the last senate
meetings, senators voted not to
approve her appointment.
However, a quorum was not
present, and the vote did not
count. The senate also ex
pressed overwhelming disap
proval for her rulings to date at
the earlier meeting.
Last night Council of Presi
dents member Goodwin Liu
said he does not expect Musson
to be confirmed next week,
adding that dissatisfaction with
her rulings has been biparti
san. "Very few people support
her rulings," he added.
