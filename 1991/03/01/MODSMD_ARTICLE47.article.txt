# Bridge club wishes to eliminate stereotypes

The game of bridge may bring to
mind images of old men and women sit
ting around swapping cards on a Satur
day afternoon, but student members of
the Stanford Bridge Club are seeking to
break down that stereotype.
"It doesn't deserve its reputation as
an old person's game," asserts graduate
student Scott Roy, the Bridge Club's
founder and president.
Although most of the players still
have a full head of hair and their own set
of teeth, they may be considered old by
college campus standards. While there
are a sprinkling of undergraduates,
most of the players are graduate stu
dents. But "we're trying to attract more
undergraduates," Roy says.
Every Wednesday night, club mem
bers cluster around six or seven bridge
tables at the Old Union Clubhouse to
engage in four hours of card exchanges.
From 7 to 11 p.m., queens, kings and
other cards reign over the second floor of
the Clubhouse.
In its first year of existence, the
Bridge Club has already attained an
impressive accomplishment, members
say. Four members of the club have qual
ified for the National Bridge Champi
onship and will travel to Atlantic City
over spring break to compete against
five other college teams from around the
country.
The club members play in groups of
two and change opponents after every
round. The score is kept, and at the end
of the evening, the grand total is tallied

and the winning team announced. Club
members say the game can get quite
competitive.
Perhaps this is why the bridge players
engage in a minimum of small talk. Only
hushed demands for certain cards can be
heard during the rounds, and one post
game conversation runs as follows:
"Good play on the clubs."
"I felt bad about taking your king!"
"That's fine. I understand."
Roy says the atmosphere has poten
tial to be fun. "With more diversity, it
will be fun," Roy says. The club has few
female club members, "probably
because most of our players are from the
math and science departments, which
have many more men than women,"
explains Roy.
He said the Harvard Bridge team, of
which he was president during his
undergraduate days, was both the
"perennial powerhouse" college bridge
team as well as a very social organiza
tion. Members of the club also went out
drinking and dancing together.
Alex Eskin, one of 11 mathematics
graduate students on the team, says he
plays because "it's relaxing and a good
waste of time." He began 10 years ago,
while living in Israel, where bridge is
popular among young people, he adds.
Asst. Mathematics Prof. Jay Bour
land says he plays because "it's a mental
challenge, a puzzle." He explains that
bridge, while easy to learn, is very diffi
cult to master.
Senior Mike Killianey says he began
playing bridge in his dormitory last year.
He joined the club in search of better
bridge players.
