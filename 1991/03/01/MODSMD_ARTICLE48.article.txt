## 
### Connie Chang Editorial staff 
At separate Intersorority and Inter
fraternity Council meetings Wednesday
night, Greek leaders announced plans
for the second annual Greek Week fes
tivities scheduled for March 7-10.
Activities include a speaker on
"Today's Undergraduate and Tomor
row's New World Order," organized
game competitions and a semi-formal
brunch with champagne and a jazz
band.
The festivities give the Greek com
munity "the opportunity to bring the
whole group together," ISC Campus
Affairs official Kerren Hedlund wrote in
a letter to all fraternity and sorority
members. She also urged fraternities
and sororities to "take advantage of this
occasion to fraternize."
Two Greek-only parties are also
planned.
The activities, which last four days,
have been budgeted at $2,800, and most
of the funds will be raised from a two
dollar contribution from each partici
pating fraternity or sorority member.

Much of the remainder will be paid by
the ISC and the IFC.
Rush activities, community service
events and a new alcohol program for
freshmen during Orientation Week were
also discussed at the IFC meeting.
Prospective Freshmen Week coordi
nators Michelle Landrey and Sandy
Bliss, both sophomores, attended the
IFC meeting to discuss their concerns
about conflicting events during the days
Pro Fro Week and Rush coincide.
They urged fraternities to make sure
Rush parties are closed to prospective
freshmen because of liabilities. They
added that the Greek system would be
held accountable if anything happened
to prospective freshmen at a Rush party.
Because of the revised University
alcohol policy, fraternity members can
not allow a person they know to be a
prospective freshman into a fraternity
hosted party, even if that person has
Stanford identification.
Bliss suggested that fraternity and
sorority members host an event like a
Greek barbecue for the prospective
freshmen to "let the Greek System have
[its] say."

Delta Tau Delta IFC delegate Mike
Curry, a sophomore, said response to
the recently proposed alcohol program
for freshmen during Orientation Week
has been positive.
Louise Miller, who heads Project
R a ISC — Risk Reduction of Intoxicants
in the Stanford Community — has
agreed to present the idea to the Office
of Residential Education.
Curry said there is even a possibility
that fraternity and sorority members
who volunteer to lead the workshops
could get academic credit.
IFC Community Service Chair Pete
Blitz, a junior, announced a community
service bulletin board will be hung in
the Haas Public Service Center starting
next quarter. The bulletin board will
post notes of thanks to organizations
that have helped the Greek system and
ask other groups to co-sponsor projects
fraternities and sororities would like to
do.
In its meeting, the ISC announced a
program on date rape for freshmen to be
held in freshman dorms next Tuesday
and an informational sorority rush
meeting the next night.
