### Howard Libit Staff writer

Speaking to about 30 prospective candi
dates, Jenn Pearson, a junior, said, "The Peo
ple's Platform is broadening out this year . . .
but we also want to bring in other groups that
are underrepresented on campus while
maintaining the ideals established by the four
[student of color organizations] who founded
the party."
The party is interviewing potential candi
dates this afternoon in the Tresidder Lounge,
and candidates must submit application forms
by Monday Next week, the People's Platform
will hold a slating primary in which party

members will vote to select Council of Presi
dents and Senate candidates.
After outlining the history of the ASSU and
the People's Platform, party members dis
cussed issues they plan to emphasize during
the election debates next month.
Among the ideas they will propose include
an expansion of multiculturalism, trying to
influence the federal re-evaluation of universi

ties' financial aid and a change of location and
focus for the Women's Center.
The People's Platform plans to create a
coalition involving various student groups,
faculty, administrators, parents and alumni to
"take an active stand" against President
Bush's proposed revision of the 1965 Higher
Education Act, said ASSU senator Naomi
Onaga, a senior.
The party will also support the proposed
move of the Women's Center from its current
location next to the Toyon eating clubs to the
first floor of the Fire Truck House, beneath
the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Community
Center, to "brinr it to the center of campus,"
Pearson said.
Pearson added that she hopes the move will
change the current attitude among some peo
ple that the center is a "quasi-upper-class,
white, feminist group" and help
them understand that it is an
organization that brings together
all women on campus.
Party officials said the People's
Platform will work to make the
concept of multiculturalism a
more significant issue in this
year's election than in those of
past years. Last year, both parties
claimed to support multicultural
ism, and it was "hard to use mul
ticulturalism as a distinguishing
point," said senior Goodwin Liu, a
Council of Presidents member.
"This year it is important not
just to support multiculturalism
but to define how to make it
work," Liu added. "We need to
make multiculturalism accessible
to everyone but not water it
down."
Party members also used the
meeting to defend the People's
Platform against various charges
from other parties.
In response to a question about
political correctness, sophomore

Nicole Johnson said, "Being polit
ically correct means saying the
right thing but not knowing why.
Members of the People's Platform
understand the philosophies,
goals and visions of the party,
have a place in it and do it — not
because they think that it is right
but because they know it is
right."
Members also defended the
party's support of continuing
ASSU Senate debate on national
issues.
"It is really important to look
beyond the Farm and make the
connection between students ai?d
national issues, such as the draft
counseling that occurred during
the war," Pearson said.
