# Month to celebrate women's 'herstory'
## 
### June Cohen Editorial staff 
Marisa Nordstrom is tired of
reading books by men.
"I feel left out — I feel isolated.
It's this false sense of isolation
that's very damaging to many
women," said Nordstrom, a
senior.
Nordstrom's concerns are
among the many that will be
addressed at Stanford during
Women's Herstory Month, which
begins today.
The nationwide celebration will
be observed on campus with two
weeks of events, ranging from a
conference on birth control to
speeches to an open-mike dance.
The events were planned by a
coalition of campus groups
brought together by the Women's
Center and are aimed at acknowl
edging the contributions women
have made in history that are fre
quently omitted from textbooks.
Just the use of the word "her
story" draws attention to the gen
der bias built into our society — a
problem that extends even to the
structure of our language, orga
nizers said.
Some women say that the his
tory taught in school is not
women's history and that their
exclusion isolates them and disen
franchises them from their cul
tural heritage.
"It's important to acknowledge
that women's history is not
taught in mainstream education,"
said Elisabeth Osgood, a junior
involved with the Women's Cen
ter.
Senior Jenna Roberts said
Women's Herstory Month "can't
balance a lifetime of education,
but I think it is really important
to have a week of intensive supple
ment to our educations."
The week's events will include
poetry reading as well as speeches

by nationally renowned leaders
such as Planned Parenthood Pres
ident Faye Wattleton and Winona
LeDuc, a writer and environmen
tal activist.
Asst. History Prof. Judith
Brown said she sees the study of
women's history as a method of
re-evaluating the traditional ways
history has been viewed and
taught.
"I think women's history
throws into question much of the
periodization of history," Brown
said.
"For example, certain dates in
history are viewed as being water
sheds. But the question is raised if
indeed they were watersheds for
women. This opens up the ques
tion for other groups in society as
well," she said.
"To give an example from my
own area of specialization," she
said, "the Renaissance has tradi
tionally been viewed as a period of
great freedom, great individual
ism and as a movement toward
modernization.
"But the question can be asked,
was it really a Renaissance for
women? Did the period not also
see worsening conditions for
women?" Brown said.
Many students are also ques
tioning the perspective through
which many classes — not just
history — are taught on campus,
organizers say.
"Women have always been told
by men what women think and
what women are like," Nordstrom
said.
"Beginning back in my Great
Works class, we would read mate
rial that was clearly sexist and too
often people [would] overlook the
causes. They excuse the sexism by
saying 4 Oh, sure, this is sexist, but
people were just like that then,'"
Nordstrom added.
"People don't look for the causes of oppression.
We just aren't connecting the history of oppression
to what's going on today," she said.
"One thing I'm hoping will come out of this is a
really positive statement about being a woman,"
Osgood said.
"Being a feminist is often seen as a negative thing
— as complaining and dismantling the male hierar
chy. But there's also very positive energy coming
from the movement that exerts a positive view of
being female," Osgood added.
