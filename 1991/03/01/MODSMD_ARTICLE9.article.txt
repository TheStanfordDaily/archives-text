# Gamma Phi Beta sorority to receive national charter
## 
### Connie Chang Editorial staff 
The Gamma Phi Beta sorority will officially
receive its national charter tomorrow â€” for the sec
ond time in its history.
The sorority was first organized in 1906 but was
abolished in 1944 when the University ended the
sorority system.
In 1987, the sorority was formed again, and it has
been considered a "colony" by the Gamma Phi Beta
International Sorority since then. As a colony, the
sorority was affiliated with the international organi
zation and was bound by its rules but had no say in
setting its policies.
At its installation banquet tomorrow, Gamma Phi
Beta will become a full-fledged chapter, allowing it to
act on its own without the approval of the interna
tional organization, said sorority president Pat Stan
ley. In addition, the sorority will now also be allowed
to vote at the biennial Gamma Phi Beta Convention
at which by-laws and various procedures are revised.
In order for a colony to become a chapter, the
international organization must determine that the
sorority is self-sufficient, said Stanley, a junior.
Self-sufficiency includes having enough members
for the sorority to function efficiently and showing
that members have "mastered rituals to promote
ideals of the sorority on campus without the help of
a lot of advisers," she said.
Stanley said getting the charter is a symbolic
achievement because "we have worked hard, and our

International recognizes us as knowing enough to
act as a group."
The sorority currently has 27 members. However,
it has struggled to get pledges in the past two years
and had to hold an informal rush last year to try to
fill its quota, said Allison Sandy, adviser for the
sorority system.
The international organization has not set a defi
nite minimum number of members required to
receive a charter, Stanley said.
Sandy said that through "a long road of hard
work and determination" the sorority has perse
vered, adding that she believes the sorority will con
tinue to grow, not necessarily in numbers, but in par
ticipation on campus.
Members say having a national charter will not
necessarily change the sorority's activities. For
example, Gamma Phi Beta will continue to conduct
for its members weekly workshops that promote cul
tural and social awareness through programs rang
ing from talks on disabilities to hula dancing, they
said.
Gamma Phi Beta Collegiate Leadership Consul
tant Martha Hunter, who is on campus this week to
help with the installation, said the international
organization is always happy to extend its chapters
to other campuses.
The international organization must be invited
onto campuses in order to establish new chapters.
This year, the International also established chap
ters at the University of Rochester, University of
South Dakota and Moorehead University in Texas.
