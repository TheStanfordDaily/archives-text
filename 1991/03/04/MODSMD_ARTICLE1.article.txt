## Allied, Iraqi leaders 'agree on all matters' 
### 
SAFWAN, Iraq (AP) — Allied and Iraqi mil
itary leaders agreed to a tentative cease-fire
and a quick release of war prisoners in a dra
matic meeting of commanders at a captured
desert airstrip in southern Iraq.
"I am very happy to tell you we agreed on all
matters," U.S. Army Gen. Norman
Schwarzkopf told a crowd of soldiers and jour
nalists after the two-hour meeting in a tent
beside the crushed-stone runway.
He announced that a "symbolic release" of
POWs would be made immediately to show
good faith, and that "all detainees," including
several thousand Kuwaiti civilian hostages
held by Iraq, would be treated as war prison
ers.
Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Abdul Amir al-
Anbari, said in New York that Iraq had
released 10 POWs already, among them six
Americans, "including the young lady that was
captured." Pentagon officials said they had
received no confirmation of any releases from
the Red Cross in Geneva.
Schwarzkopf, the U.S. commander in the Persian
Gulf, and other allied chiefs refused to say whether
they had learned how many POWs are held by Iraq.
The U.S. command knows of at least nine Ameri
cans. The only woman U.S. soldier listed as missing
in the war is Army Spc. Melissa Rathbun-Nealy, 20,
of Grand Rapids, Mich.
Schwarzkopf said U.S. troops would withdraw
from occupied southern Iraq as soon as a permanent
cease-fire was signed and Iraq has complied with
U.N. resolutions. Those resolutions say Iraq must,
among other things, rescind its annexation of
Kuwait and accept liability for war damages in the
emirate.
About 12 hours after the meeting in Safwan,
Baghdad Radio announced that Iraq accepted the
tougher U.N. conditions. That acceptance could clear
the way for a permanent cease-fire in the Persian
Gulf war.
In return, the U.N. Security Council yesterday
authorized mercy (lights into Baghdad of food,
medicine and water purification equipment.
In other developments:
• Iran's official radio reported violence between
Iraqis and government forces during demonstra
tions against Saddam Hussein in at least four cities.
Tehran radio said refugees fleeing Iraq for Iran
reported "severe clashes" in the cities of Basra, Al-
Amarah, Nassiriya and Kut. Washington repeatedly
has urged Iraqis to overthrow Saddam, but U.S. offi
cers say they don't know whether civil unrest in Iraq
has become widespread.
• Saddam began the long process of rebuilding his
war-torn nation and restoring his image as a
regional leader to be reckoned with. Baghdad Radio
reported yesterday that he led two meetings dealing
with the restoration of Iraqi communications, the
first report of his activities since Tuesday.
• A woman pilot and three other U.S. soldiers
were killed in a helicopter crash in northern Saudi
Arabia, U.S. military officials said today. Army Maj.
Marie Rossi, 32, of Oradell, N.J., was the first woman
pilot reported to be killed in the Gulf war. Officials in
Saudi Arabia did not provide details of the Saturday
crash, two days after the allies declared a cease-fire.
• French President Francois Mitterrand yester
day proposed an unprecedented meeting of the lead
ers of the U.N. Security Council member nations to
discuss Middle East issues such as the Palestinian-
Israeli conflict.
In Safwan, two Iraqi army lieutenant generals.
Sultan Hasheem Ahmad and Salah Abbud Mahmud,
led the eight-member Iraqi delegation to the tent
rendezvous.
