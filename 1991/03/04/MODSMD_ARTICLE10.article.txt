# Theta Delt fraternity housing threatened
## 
### Connie Chang Editorial staff 
The Theta Delta Chi fraternity,
which has not filled its housing quota
for the past three years, could lose its
house next year if it does not recruit
enough members during this spring's
Rush.
Row Director Jack Chin said the
housed fraternity is "in jeopardy"
because it has had low numbers of
pledges in recent years. To keep its
house, the fraternity must recruit
enough new members this year to sat
isfy the University's quota.
The quota, which changes each
year, will be determined after adminis
trators calculate the total number of
spaces available to undergraduate

men. The overall figure will be higher
next year because of the opening of
Kimball Hall.
Michael Ramsey-Perez, program
and fraternal affairs adviser, said this
year's Rush will be crucial for the ten
housed fraternities because the Uni
versity will be "opening a hundred new
beds for men that will be attractive."
The University may take away a
fraternity house and place it in the
Draw if the fraternity fails to meet its
quota for three out of four years.
The fraternity currently has 32
members and space for 48 men in its
house. Boarders fill the remaining
spots.
Theta Delt Co-president Rob
Tymoczko, a junior, said that he is not
worried about meeting whatever quota

is set and that the fraternity is not in
danger of losing its house.
"All we have to do is have a good
Rush," he said, adding that the Theta
Delts have been preparing for the
event since the beginning of the year
and think they already know enough
people who are interesting in rushing
there.
In the past quarter, the fraternity
has invited most dormitories to its
house for barbecues and parties, said
junior Charlie Lough, the other co
president.
Low pledge numbers in previous
years stemmed from the fraternity's
selectiveness, not from lack of inter
ested students, Lough said. For exam
ple, 12 students were interested in join
ing last year but only eight were

accepted.
Lough said it is his personal goal to
recruit about 20 to 25 men, which
should meet the University's quota.
"We're on track to get that," he added.
If the Theta Delts lose their house,
Chin said it would become another
Row house, probably University-oper
ated unless students propose a self
operative house.
Chin noted that a currently
unhoused fraternity may not occupy
the house even if it meets the quota
because the University has a policy
against adding more housing spaces
for subjectively selective groups.
Ramsey-Perez said he is working
with the Interfraternity Council to
insure that Rush goes well for all fra
ternities.
