## 
### John Louie Staff writer 
A recent decision by John Hopkins Univer
sity to divest $5.3 million in tobacco holdings
may influence the Stanford Board of Trustees'
ongoing discussion of tobacco divestment.
The University will take into consideration
Johns Hopkins' action in its divestment discus
sion, said Gary Malone, director of the Advi
sory Panel on Investment Responsibility, one
of two committees that advises the Board of
Trustees on investments.
Stanford currently holds $18 million in
tobacco stocks.
"We're interested in finding out what's
behind their decision to divest," Malone said.
"But Stanford will continue to [implement] its
own policy and its own process."
The advisory panel and the Special Commit
tee on Investment Responsibility have been
discussing the issue since fall quarter. On Jan.
15, as part of California's anti-smoking cam
paign, State Health Director Kenneth Kizer
sent a letter to University President Donald
Kennedy and the Board of Trustees asking for
complete divestment from tobacco companies.
In a statement issued Feb. 22, Johns Hop
kins announced the holding of tobacco stocks is
incompatible with its "mission to disseminate
information on the treatment and prevention
of disease and illness."
The statement cites Johns Hopkins' School
of Hygiene and Public Health and School of
Medicine as holding esteemed reputations in
their field and says "tobacco products and the
consequences of their use" are having an
increasing effect on public health.
Johns Hopkins "took this action not to pun
ish or hurt tobacco companies or to urge other
universities to follow suit," said Dennis
O'Shea, the university's director of news and
information.
"It was solely because we take very seriously
our mission of public health. The trustees felt
strongly that the divestment policy is very
much in line with . . . reflecting our public
health mission," he said.
Assoc. Director of University Relations Bar
bara Benjamin-Trevino said the Stanford advi
sory panel has not yet made final recommenda
tions. "But [the panel] did bring the issue up .
. . and gave a progress report to the SCIR" of
the Board of Trustees.
The progress report addresses the develop
ment of "a policy that addresses tobacco head
on, but also with an eye to the future," Malone
said.
