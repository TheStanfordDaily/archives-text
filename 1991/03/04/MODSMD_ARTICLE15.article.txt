COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo.
(AP) â€” A United jetliner with 25
people on board crashed in flames
as it approached the Colorado
Springs airport yesterday morn
ing, and there were apparently no
survivors, authorities said.
"We can't even find a chair,"
said El Paso County Sheriff
Bernie Berry. "There's not a great
deal of that airplane left."
United Flight 585 en route
from Denver crashed at 9:55 a.m.
four to five miles south of the air
port, the Federal Aviation Admin
istration in Washington said.
There were 20 passengers on
board and a crew of five.
The FAA and the airline both
said all aboard apparently were
killed. The plane narrowly missed
houses and apartment buildings,
but at least one person on the

ground was injured.
"There does not appear to be
any survivors," said Dick Meyer,
of the FAA's public information
office in Seattle. Chicago-based
United said in a statement that
"at this time there are no reports
of survivors" aboard the twin
engine Boeing 737-200.
"All obviously are presumed
dead," said Sgt. Dean Kelsey, of
the El Paso County Sheriff's
office. However, he said he would
not confirm that until search
efforts had been exhausted.
Meyer said there was no com
munication from the pilot to the
airport control tower indicating
any problem before the crash.
Plane was last inspected yester
day at Denver and had no history
of problems, said Lawrence
Nagin, United senior vice presi
dent at a news conference at com

pany headquarters.
A witness, Army Command
Sgt. Maj. Leo Martinez, said that
the plane banked sharply, veered
and then crashed virtually nose
first.
"I watched and it went verti
cally into the ground," he said.
"There was a huge fireball, black
smoke and orange flame."
Ed Arangio, administrator at
Memorial Hosptial, said a 12-
year-old girl who was in the door
way of her house suffered a head
injury when she was blown back
ward by the force of the crash. She
was treated and released.
The weather was clear but
there were high, gusty winds in
the area at the time of the crash,
Mistretta said. The National
Weather Service said winds were
from the northwest at 23 mph
gusting to 32 mph.
