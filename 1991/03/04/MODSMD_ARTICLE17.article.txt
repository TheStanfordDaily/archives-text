## Keep conserving 
### 
It'll take more than five
days' rain to wash away
the need to cut back

After splashing through
puddles and wringing out
your clothes for the last sev
eral days, the temptation to take a
nice, long, hot shower may be
growing.
But don't let the rain fool you.
Five days of rain after a five-year
drought is merely a drop in the
bucket, so to speak. As Stanford's
Operations Manager David Kaye
put it,"The rain is like pouring a
canteen on a forest fire."
The recent wet spell follows an
announcement by the San Fran
cisco Water Department that its
clients must cut their water usage
another 20 percent, bringing the
level to 55 percent of consumption
for 1987, the last year of normal
rainfall.
In response, the University has
introduced a new rationing plan.
Restrictions include a car-washing
ban on students and faculty, a 90
percent reduction of outside water
ing and the use of only non-potable
water for irrigation.
These steps are admirable, but
they are not enough.
Kaye has said the University
does not want to punish students
for using more than their share of
water and will instead ask that res
ident assistants and fellows
increase drought education.
However, the University has
been telling students to conserve
water for years and the situation
does not seem to be improving.
Currently, there is no real incen
tive for students to conserve. Local
residents are more likely to
respond to water cutbacks because
they are fined if they don't. To the
average Stanford student, water is

free, whether or not it is in short
supply.
The University has started to
install water meters in all campus
buildings and plans to publish the
the usage figures weekly.
Once in place, these meters can
serve a greater purpose than just
informing the campus of the num
ber of gallons by which we are
exceeding our limit.
A reasonable figure for water
usage should be determined for
each campus residence, just like in
local communities. And following
the lead of surrounding municipal
ities, Stanford should fine offend
ers for wasting water.
This fine would be shared by
members of the offending resi
dences. If dorms are using more
than their allotted share of water,
they should pay for the extra gal
lons instead of having the Univer
sity accrue a large fine each month.
Shared responsibility for water
misuse would heighten awareness
much more than a few signs posted
in bathrooms. If people's money
was going down the drain, they
might think twice about running
the water when brushing their
teeth, washing their hands or tak
ing 20- to 30-minute showers.
Collected fines could be used to
pay any overall penalties the Uni
versity may receive, or to put more
water-saving devices in dorms and
other campus buildings. Washing
machines that recycle water and
shower head modifiers that make
it possible to keep water tempera
ture constant while it is turned off
are two options to be explored.
Even if it keeps raining, experts
predict it will take three to four
years of normal rainfall to elimi
nate drought conditions.
In the meantime, each individ
ual has an obligation to conserve
water in this crisis situation and
should shoulder part of the bur
den.
