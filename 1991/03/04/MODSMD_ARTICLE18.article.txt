Giving 353 Campus to the Delts was shortsighted, unfair

The following message
greeted members of 353 Campus
Drive on Thursday morning: "As of
next year, 353 Campus will be the Delt
House. If you are concerned about this,
please come to a meeting tonight at 6:30,
when Jack Chin will explain this deci
sion."
That night our lounge was filled with
concerned residents, former residents,
eating associates and guests. Jack Chin,
acting director of the Row, explained that
the Delta Tau Delta fraternity, which
was relocated to 553 Mayfield House
after the Earthquake of 1989, will be
allowed to occupy 353 Campus starting
in September 1991.
We found Chin's reasons to be unsub
stantiated and contrary to recognized
University policy. Furthermore, we
thought the decision process violated an
integral value of an intellectual commu
nity: the exchange of ideas in open
debate. And more importantly, the deci
sion is a direct affront to the vast major
ity of Stanford students.

The reasons Chin laid out for the deci
sion were:
• The Office of Residential Education
made a commitment to the Delts after
the earthquake to provide housing that
would allow the "sustainability" of their
community. Row management felt that
this community is an "enhancement pro
gram," and according to Chin, the Delt
community was given higher priority
than that of 353 Campus, based on "a
value judgment."
• The members of the Delts were
asked to submit a recommendation to
the committee. According to Chin, it
stated that a more attractive house
would help attract pledges. The Delts
also claimed that the rooms at 553 May
field are too small for them.
Our objections are numerous:
• Res Ed has based this decision on an
unjustified "value judgment." 353 Cam
pus is a self-operative residence where
members enjoy an environment in which
women and men alike feel welcomed
regardless of their political affiliations,

involvements in extracurricular activities
and ethnic and cultural identities. It is
exactly this type of residence that the
University espouses as an integral part
of a Stanford education.
• All women and many men will now
be systematically denied some of the
University's best housing, at 353 Cam
pus.
• 553 Mayfield, the current residence
of the Delts, was formerly the house of
the Delta Upsilon fraternity, and was
occupied by all men, including many ath
letes of large physical stature.
• 353 Campus residents were denied
the right to contribute to deliberations.
We feel strongly that expediency was
achieved by eliminating opposing points
of view.
Our position that this decision is
unjustified and must be reversed is
based on an even greater inconsistency
in Res Ed policy. As Chin himself stated,
Stanford will not increase housing for
groups that subjectively select members.
Granting 353 Campus to the fraternity

does precisely this: the Delts, one such
selective group, will gain 17 housing
spaces.
Again, we do not mean to attack the
fraternity or its right to adequate hous
ing. But we do not feel that their current
housing situation mandates granting 353
Campus at the expense of the majority of
Stanford students.
This issue is relevant to every under
graduate who is concerned that his or
her options for housing are being
restricted by the administration. We
encourage students to let the University
know how they feel.
We think the reasons above demon
strate that this decision was made pre
maturely and is inherently wrong. We
ask that the final decision be reconsid
ered and that all relevant parties be
included in future discussions.
