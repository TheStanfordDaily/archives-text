# Christian Science is a viable alternative to traditional treatment
## 
### 
Maurits van der Veen's article on chil
dren's rights presents some important
points worth debating. Everyone would
agree that arbitrarily denying medical
care to children is negligent, and should
be prosecuted if iryury to the child
results.
But not all parents, specifically those
belonging to the Church of Christian Sci
ence, who choose to use prayer for heal
ing are simply blind followers of religious
dogma. Many pragmatically feel that
prayer can be the most effective method
of healing for their families.

Medicine has proved over its long his
tory that it is capable of healing many
ailments, but it is not effective in curing
every disease. Justifiable belief in physi
cians' power to heal is understandable,
but when this becomes a faith so firmly
entrenched that it denies the power of
other methods to heal, it is a value judg
ment which a pluralistic society should
be reluctant to impose.
The practicality of Christian Science
can be seen when considering the fact
that in Christian Science families, 21 out
of every 100,000 children die before age
15; the national average (as reported by
the National Center for Disease Statis
tics) is 53.
Only nine Christian Science children
have died in the last decade from what
was considered to be a lack of traditional
medical treatment. This is nine too

The majority should not
negate a family's choice of
effective health care just
because it is not in the
mainstream.

many, but society is, essentially, requir
ing Christian Scientists to have a perfect
record in order to practice their religion.
Many of these children would have
died under medical care, since meningi
tis, terminal diabetes and cancer (the
cause of death for most of these chil
dren) are not always curable with
medicine.
To say that parents can pray for their
children in hospitals implicitly asserts

that the parents' beliefs are ineffective
and can be indulged for the sake of free
dom of religion, but removes any real
religious choice since freedom of religion
is nothing without the freedom to prac
tice. Children already do not have the
power to choose their method of health
care, since most children do not choose
to go to a physician.
Children's rights must be protected,
but it is not the mtyority's right to
negate a family's choice of effective
health care just because it is not the
mainstream system. Christian Scientists
have experienced verifiable healings,
with medical diagnosis both before
and after healing. Medicine is effective in
healing, but prayer is a viable, practical
alternative.
