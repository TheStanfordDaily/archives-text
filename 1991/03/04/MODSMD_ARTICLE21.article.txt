GEORGE BUSH SAYS the economy
is in a mild, short-term slowdown.
Most economists recognize it as
some form of recession. For Stanford
seniors, however, it might as well be the
Great Depression.
Many of them are experiencing their
own "great depression," the letdown that
results from the realization that $80,000
and four years at Stanford doesn't guar
antee you any job after college, let alone
the job you want.
The Career Planning and Placement
Center's winter recruiting period is over,
and only a few people I know have job
offers. One of them interviewed with only
one company and got the job, while
another has single-handedly cornered the
market with five offers. The rest of us
have been lucky to get second-round
interviews.
For those others out there striking
much less than gold (perhaps something
closer to chrome) during this process,
you're not alone. Reports are plentiful
about how companies are not hiring, the
job market is tight and many more quali
fied people are seeking the top jobs.
But we go to Stanford. So all this
shouldn't affect us, right? Wrong.
The recession is hitting home, and
Stanford job-seekers are feeling it. It has
not been rare for CPPC recruiters to
receive more than 300 resumes for as few
as seven interview spots.
Even people who have literally lived at
the CPPC for the past four years are
striking out, despite the extensive career
counseling, resume workshops, interview
skill assessments, bidding-strategy ses
sions and other packaging services the

CPPC provides.
For a lot of prospective graduates, job
opportunities are increasingly dependent
on the few initial 30-minute interviews
they can finagle with their limited
amount of bidding points. The lack of
recruiters and available positions have
made the process seem even more con
trived and disconcerting than usual; how
can a company representative determine
the merits of a potential employee solely
from a 30-minute conversation and a sin
gle sheet of paper?
Despite the push toward conformity
through the CPPC interview process —
where resumes, cover letters and inter
view styles make every job candidate the
same person in a different suit — the
recession is making its own plea for indi
viduality.
Without the wealth of positions nor
mally available through the CPPC pro
cess, this year's seniors have been forced
to reahlljMb ttieir own job plans and
determirte what it is they really want to
do. Going with the flow has gone by the
wayside, as have the management con
sulting, investment banking and Silicon
Valley jobs that everybody and his room
mate clamors for.
As "March Madness" rolls around,
most seniors prepare to depart for spring
break without any definite post-gradua
tion plans. Those procrastinators who are
just starting to think about life after June
16 are no further behind many of those
who have been thinking about nothing
else.
It's time to take the CPPC blinders off
and look around for other available
opportunities — graduate schools, travel

options, public service activities or jobs
with companies that don't recruit.
As a primer for those who can't come
up with anything original or realistic,
here are a few possibilities that I thought
up:
• Tower Records. You'll save money
by not having to own business suits, but
that may be more than countered by the
costs of hair products, Morrisey T-shirts
and black nail polish. The same all-black
wardrobe will be just as appropriate for a
job as a Guns 'N' Roses roadie.
• Office of the Provost. I hear they
may be having some openings soon —
knowledge of general accounting prac
tices optional.
• Tresidder Express. Cool job, cool
people and heavy metal music all day
Party on, dude!
• Lie about your age and run for
Congress. If every Stanford senior took
over his or her home district's congres
sional seat, I'm sure we couldn't do any
worse than we're doing with our current
choices.
• Start your own granola comp
any.
Whatever your job outlook is for next
year, just be glad you'll have a choice that
doesn't involve wearing camouflage.
