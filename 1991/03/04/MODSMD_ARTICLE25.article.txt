## Smaller lineup for Stanford beats Cal by 18 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
Even in basketball, bigger
doesn't always mean better —
and, if you won't take our word
for it, just ask the Stanford men's
hoops team.
The Cardinal went with a small
three-guard lineup for most of
Saturday's game against Califor
nia, and the result was a lot of
running, a lot of perfect passes, a
lot of crisp execution and a lot of
Bear-spanking in Stanford's final
regular-season home game.

Cardinal 90
Bears 72

The Cardinal's smaller lineup
ran circles around the Bears dur
ing most of the 90-72 win, slicing
through the Cal press like an Axe
through a Weenie, running its
offense flawlessly (after the first
five minutes) and playing mis
take-free basketball for the first
time in several games.
"Needless to say, I'm pleased,"
said Stanford coach Mike Mont
gomery. "We played hard and we
played smart. .. . We moved well,
guys were going after rebounds,
scrapping for the ball, getting
down the floor on breaks. It's just
so much fun to coach kids when
they play like that."
Montgomery's kids are now
15-12 (8-9 in the Pacific 10 Con
ference) with one regular-season
game remaining, while the Bears
fell to 11-15 (7-10) in spite of cen
ter Brian Hendrick's 24 points
and 13 boards. The Cardinal is in
eighth place in the conference,
only one-half game behind the
five teams tied for third at 8-8.
The win brings Stanford a step
closer to a National Invitation
Tournament berth, but no one
sees a postseason bid as a lock —
or knows what the NIT selection
committee is thinking. "The only

thing I know is I'm in the Bay
Area," Montgomery said. "Other
than that I don't know anything.
There are no guarantees."
There were no guarantees of
anything on Saturday either, for
the Cardinal was coming off three
straight losses, including a mega
disaster at Arizona last Tuesday.
"Coming off Tuesday's ballgame,
we didn't have very much time to
pump up the egos and prepare,"
Montgomery said. "It was tough."
Apparently not too tough, for
Stanford played an almost-error
free game. Almost. After a
pregame ceremony honoring
seniors John Patrick, Kenny
Ammann, Deshon Wingate and
Andrew Vlahov, the Cardinal
came out clanging — Stanford
didn't hit a field goal until the
game was over five minutes old —
and Cal built a quick 16-6 lead.
Forward Brent Williams picked
up three quick fouls to start the
game, however, and that meant
Montgomery had to shift his
lineup. The solution was to bring
Marcus Lollie in to run the point,
bring Kenny Hicks in at off-guard
and shift Patrick from the point to
small forward.
"Deshon normally plays three,
but now it's Brent," Montgomery
said. "When he went out I didn't
have another three. I guess it
turned out to be a blessing in dis
guise."
And then some. With Lollie
sparking the fast break and dish
ing out six of his career-high nine
assists in the first half, the Cardi
nal went on a 32-14 tear to go up
38-30 at intermission. Patrick had
11 points (including three three
pointers) during the run, which
was capped by a sweet Lollie-to-
Wingate bounce pass on a break
for a monster slam.
"We came out and played well
at the start," said Cal coach Lou
"What grey hair?" Campanelli,
"but they responded with a coun
terattack and we never charged

back."
Not that Cal just quit. "Hen
drick was a bitch the whole
game," said Stanford's Adam
Keefe, who spent most of the con
test banging with Hendrick
underneath the hoop. "I didn't see
any life go out of him."
The two centers ended up play
ing to a 24-points-all draw, but it
was Keefe, and not Hendrick, who
got support from his teammates.
"I thought our bench contribution

was was tremendous," Mont
gomery said. "Hicks and Lollie —
we got great efforts from those
two in particular."
All told, Stanford's guards
outscored the Bears' 44-18.
Patrick had 18 and Ammann 13,
and it was Ammann who hit two
threes in the first 90 seconds of
the second half to put Stanford up
by 11. The Bears cut it to six with
16:36 left, but then Campanelli
decided to go into his not-so
vaunted 1-2-1-1, full-court press.
We're not positive about this,
but last we checked we were
pretty sure a press was supposed
to disrupt another team's offense

and create a few turnovers. If
that's still the case (and we
assume it is), Campanelli may
want to tinker with the Bear
"unim-press": In 17 minutes of
swarming, the Bears forced zero
Stanford turnovers and fell com
pletely, hopelessly behind.
In fact, in 17 minutes of flail
ing, Cal touched the ball once in
the backcourt during a press.
And, in 17 minutes of facing
that press, Stanford played flaw
less keep away and kept the game
out of reach: The Cardinal fin
ished the game with only two
turnovers.
"That's a big concentration

thing for us," Montgomery said.
"We didn't make many errant
plays. . . . There's no real explana
tion for that. It's the way we
should play at all times."
With the press shredded and
the Bears in tatters, the only two
things worth watching during the
rest of the game were the nauseat
ing abundance of free throws —
the teams shot 35 of them in the
last 10 minutes of the game — and
the battle between Keefe and
Hendrick underneath.
"It really wasn't what I
expected," said Keefe, who missed
nine of his 15 shots. "We were
both busy throwing up a lot of

bricks."

but last we checked we were
pretty sure a press was supposed
to disrupt another team's offense

and create a few turnovers. If
that's still the case (and we
assume it is), Campanelli may
want to tinker with the Bear
"unim-press": In 17 minutes of
swarming, the Bears forced zero
Stanford turnovers and fell com
pletely, hopelessly behind.
In fact, in 17 minutes of flail
ing, Cal touched the ball once in
the backcourt during a press.
And, in 17 minutes of facing
that press, Stanford played flaw
less keep away and kept the game
out of reach: The Cardinal fin
ished the game with only two
turnovers.
"That's a big concentration

thing for us," Montgomery said.
"We didn't make many errant
plays. . . . There's no real explana
tion for that. It's the way we

With the press shredded and
the Bears in tatters, the only two
things worth watching during the
rest of the game were the nauseat
ing abundance of free throws —
the teams shot 35 of them in the
last 10 minutes of the game — and
the battle between Keefe and
Hendrick underneath.
"It really wasn't what I

nine of his 15 shots. "We were
both busy throwing up a lot of

The Cardinal went with a small
three-guard lineup for most of
Saturday's game against Califor
nia, and the result was a lot of
running, a lot of perfect passes, a
lot of crisp execution and a lot of
Bear-spanking in Stanford's final
regular-season home game.

Men's Basketball

Cardinal 90
Bears 72

The Cardinal's smaller lineup
ran circles around the Bears dur
ing most of the 90-72 win, slicing
through the Cal press like an Axe
through a Weenie, running its
offense flawlessly (after the first
five minutes) and playing mis
take-free basketball for the first
time in several games.
"Needless to say, I'm pleased,"
said Stanford coach Mike Mont
gomery. "We played hard and we
played smart. .. . We moved well,
guys were going after rebounds,
scrapping for the ball, getting
down the floor on breaks. It's just
so much fun to coach kids when
they play like that."
Montgomery's kids are now
15-12 (8-9 in the Pacific 10 Con
ference) with one regular-season
game remaining, while the Bears
fell to 11-15 (7-10) in spite of cen
ter Brian Hendrick's 24 points
and 13 boards. The Cardinal is in
eighth place in the conference,
only one-half game behind the
five teams tied for third at 8-8.
The win brings Stanford a step
closer to a National Invitation
Tournament berth, but no one
sees a postseason bid as a lock —
or knows what the NIT selection
committee is thinking. "The only

thing I know is I'm in the Bay
Area," Montgomery said. "Other
than that I don't know anything.
There are no guarantees."
There were no guarantees of
anything on Saturday either, for
the Cardinal was coming off three
straight losses, including a mega
disaster at Arizona last Tuesday.
"Coming off Tuesday's ballgame,
we didn't have very much time to
pump up the egos and prepare,"
Montgomery said. "It was tough."
Apparently not too tough, for
Stanford played an almost-error
free game. Almost. After a
pregame ceremony honoring
seniors John Patrick, Kenny
Ammann, Deshon Wingate and
Andrew Vlahov, the Cardinal
came out clanging — Stanford
didn't hit a field goal until the
game was over five minutes old —
and Cal built a quick 16-6 lead.
Forward Brent Williams picked
up three quick fouls to start the
game, however, and that meant
Montgomery had to shift his
lineup. The solution was to bring
Marcus Lollie in to run the point,
bring Kenny Hicks in at off-guard
and shift Patrick from the point to
small forward.
"Deshon normally plays three,
but now it's Brent," Montgomery
said. "When he went out I didn't
have another three. I guess it
turned out to be a blessing in dis
guise."
And then some. With Lollie
sparking the fast break and dish
ing out six of his career-high nine
assists in the first half, the Cardi
nal went on a 32-14 tear to go up
38-30 at intermission. Patrick had
11 points (including three three
pointers) during the run, which
was capped by a sweet Lollie-to-
Wingate bounce pass on a break
for a monster slam.
"We came out and played well
at the start," said Cal coach Lou
"What grey hair?" Campanelli,
"but they responded with a coun
terattack and we never charged

Not that Cal just quit. "Hen
drick was a bitch the whole
game," said Stanford's Adam
Keefe, who spent most of the con
test banging with Hendrick
underneath the hoop. "I didn't see
any life go out of him."
The two centers ended up play
ing to a 24-points-all draw, but it
was Keefe, and not Hendrick, who
got support from his teammates.
"I thought our bench contribution

was was tremendous," Mont
gomery said. "Hicks and Lollie —
we got great efforts from those
two in particular."
All told, Stanford's guards
outscored the Bears' 44-18.
Patrick had 18 and Ammann 13,
and it was Ammann who hit two
threes in the first 90 seconds of
the second half to put Stanford up
by 11. The Bears cut it to six with
16:36 left, but then Campanelli
decided to go into his not-so
vaunted 1-2-1-1, full-court press.
We're not positive about this,
