## Smaller lineup for Stanford beats Cal by 18 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
Even in basketball, bigger
doesn't always mean better —
and, if you won't take our word
for it, just ask the Stanford men's
hoops team.
The Cardinal went with a small
three-guard lineup for most of
Saturday's game against Califor
nia, and the result was a lot of
running, a lot of perfect passes, a
lot of crisp execution and a lot of
Bear-spanking in Stanford's final
regular-season home game.

Cardinal 90
Bears 72

The Cardinal's smaller lineup
ran circles around the Bears dur
ing most of the 90-72 win, slicing
through the Cal press like an Axe
through a Weenie, running its
offense flawlessly (after the first
five minutes) and playing mis
take-free basketball for the first
time in several games.
"Needless to say, I'm pleased,"
said Stanford coach Mike Mont
gomery. "We played hard and we
played smart. .. . We moved well,
guys were going after rebounds,
scrapping for the ball, getting
down the floor on breaks. It's just
so much fun to coach kids when
they play like that."
Montgomery's kids are now
15-12 (8-9 in the Pacific 10 Con
ference) with one regular-season
game remaining, while the Bears
fell to 11-15 (7-10) in spite of cen
ter Brian Hendrick's 24 points
and 13 boards. The Cardinal is in
eighth place in the conference,
only one-half game behind the
five teams tied for third at 8-8.
The win brings Stanford a step
closer to a National Invitation
Tournament berth, but no one
sees a postseason bid as a lock —
or knows what the NIT selection
committee is thinking. "The only

thing I know is I'm in the Bay
Area," Montgomery said. "Other
than that I don't know anything.
There are no guarantees."
There were no guarantees of
anything on Saturday either, for
the Cardinal was coming off three
straight losses, including a mega
disaster at Arizona last Tuesday.
"Coming off Tuesday's ballgame,
we didn't have very much time to
pump up the egos and prepare,"
Montgomery said. "It was tough."
Apparently not too tough, for
Stanford played an almost-error
free game. Almost. After a
pregame ceremony honoring
seniors John Patrick, Kenny
Ammann, Deshon Wingate and
Andrew Vlahov, the Cardinal
came out clanging — Stanford
didn't hit a field goal until the
game was over five minutes old —
and Cal built a quick 16-6 lead.
Forward Brent Williams picked
up three quick fouls to start the
game, however, and that meant
Montgomery had to shift his
lineup. The solution was to bring
Marcus Lollie in to run the point,
bring Kenny Hicks in at off-guard
and shift Patrick from the point to
small forward.
"Deshon normally plays three,
but now it's Brent," Montgomery
said. "When he went out I didn't
have another three. I guess it
turned out to be a blessing in dis
guise."
And then some. With Lollie
sparking the fast break and dish
ing out six of his career-high nine
assists in the first half, the Cardi
nal went on a 32-14 tear to go up
38-30 at intermission. Patrick had
11 points (including three three
pointers) during the run, which
was capped by a sweet Lollie-to-
Wingate bounce pass on a break
for a monster slam.
"We came out and played well
at the start," said Cal coach Lou
"What grey hair?" Campanelli,
"but they responded with a coun
terattack and we never charged
