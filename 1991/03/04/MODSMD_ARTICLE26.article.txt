# Bears can't make Cardinal blink
## 
### David Hirning Senior staff writer 
BERKELEY - With 11:05
left in the game and her team
trailing by five, Cardinal point
guard Sonja Henning stared into
the face of an upset-minded Cal
ifornia team. If Stanford came
unraveled, Henning knew it
could potentially cost the team
an outright league crown and
dash its confidence heading
towards the NCAA tournament.
Under Henning's steady gaze,
however, the Bears blinked.
The All-America candidate
dished out a career-high 15
assists (equalling Cal's team
total) to go with 18 points Friday
night, leading her team to the
come-from-behind 93-80 win. It
was the No. 10 Cardinal's second
consecutive road victory in
which they trailed in the second
half.
Combined with USC's 69-62
upset of No. 9 Washington in Los
Angeles on Friday, Stanford's
triumph clinched at least a tie
for the Pacific 10 Conference
title. It also officially assured the
Cardinal of its fourth straight
NCAA appearance (the confer
ence winner gets an automatic
berth, and Stanford would win a
points tiebreaker with the
Huskies).

With two of its big inside play
ers, Trisha Stevens and Val
Whiting, in foul trouble, Stan
ford (22-4, 14-1 in league) could
have thrown in the towel. The
crowd of nearly 1,900 at Har
mon Gym was screaming for the
upset, and Cal junior forward
Trisha Stafford was eating the
Cardinal alive with her potent
outside shooting and deadly pen
etration.
But Henning wouldn't let her
team lose. "Sonja is so poised, so
composed," said Stanford coach
Tara VanDerveer. "I don't think
I've ever seen her flustered."
Instead, it was the Bears (14-
12, 7-9) who were flustered
when Henning put the Cardinal
on top 65-64 with a full-court
sprint and layin at the 9:25
mark. All seven of the senior's
baskets came on layins, as she
repeatedly found seams in the
Cal defense for driving hoops.
"I give credit to their coach,
and they have a great leader in
Sonja Henning," said Stafford,
whose game-high 31 points were
not enough. "She kept her com
posure."
The Bears made one more
run in the see-saw affair (after
leading the entire first half,
Stanford watched the lead
change hands eight times in the
closing 20 minutes), going up by

one on a layup by Theresa
Palmisano with 8:24 remaining.
But a layup by the Cardinal's
Chris MacMurdo and four free
throws by Julie Zeilstra put
Stanford back in command, and
Henning put the finishing
touches on the game-breaking
run with another coast-to-coast
layup.
Henning's 15 assists often
went into the hands of team
mates Stevens and Zeilstra. The
"other Trisha" on the floor,
whom VanDerveer had hoped to
play sparingly but was instead
called on for 27 minutes on her
sore knees, had 20 points and an
astounding six blocked shots.
Zeilstra led the Cardinal with 25
points and chipped in 11
rebounds as well.
"I was yelling — I've never
yelled like that on the court,"
said Zeilstra, commenting on the
team's frustration at falling
behind a team which the Cardi
nal defeated by 34 points in
Maples Pavilion a month ago. "I
felt we weren't playing with the
intensity we needed to."

An adjustment by Stanford in
the second half helped stop
Stafford, who had 17 first half
points and kept the Bears close
with her scoring. The Cardinal
had been pressuring the Bears'
guards on the wings, leaving
Stafford open inside. The Bear
star had a quieter 14 in the sec
ond half.
"We worked a little harder on
Stafford in the second half,"
Zeilstra said. "She had a great
game though."
But it was Henning who had
the night to remember. Her first
assist of her personal-high 15
gave her 700 for her career, mak
ing the Cardinal co-captain only
the 10th player in women's bas
ketball history to accomplish
that feat. She also had five
steals, which gave her a share of
the Pac-10 career record (with
Jennifer Azzi) with 271 total
thefts.
"Henning doesn't have to
score to beat you," Cal coach
Gooch Foster said.
Cal played an inspired game,
partly because it was saying
goodbye to top seniors
Palmisano and Laura Baker. For
those players, it was a last
chance to beat their cross-Bay
rivals, who have defeated Cal the
last eight meetings.

have thrown in the towel. The
crowd of nearly 1,900 at Har
mon Gym was screaming for the
upset, and Cal junior forward
Trisha Stafford was eating the
Cardinal alive with her potent
outside shooting and deadly pen
etration.
But Henning wouldn't let her
team lose. "Sonja is so poised, so
composed," said Stanford coach
Tara VanDerveer. "I don't think
I've ever seen her flustered."
Instead, it was the Bears (14-
12, 7-9) who were flustered
when Henning put the Cardinal
on top 65-64 with a full-court
sprint and layin at the 9:25
mark. All seven of the senior's
baskets came on layins, as she
repeatedly found seams in the
Cal defense for driving hoops.
"I give credit to their coach,
and they have a great leader in
Sonja Henning," said Stafford,
whose game-high 31 points were
not enough. "She kept her com
posure."
The Bears made one more
run in the see-saw affair (after
leading the entire first half,
Stanford watched the lead
change hands eight times in the
closing 20 minutes), going up by

one on a layup by Theresa
Palmisano with 8:24 remaining.
But a layup by the Cardinal's
Chris MacMurdo and four free
throws by Julie Zeilstra put
Stanford back in command, and
Henning put the finishing
touches on the game-breaking
run with another coast-to-coast
layup.
Henning's 15 assists often
went into the hands of team
mates Stevens and Zeilstra. The
"other Trisha" on the floor,
whom VanDerveer had hoped to
play sparingly but was instead
called on for 27 minutes on her
sore knees, had 20 points and an
astounding six blocked shots.
Zeilstra led the Cardinal with 25
points and chipped in 11
rebounds as well.
"I was yelling — I've never
yelled like that on the court,"
said Zeilstra, commenting on the
team's frustration at falling
behind a team which the Cardi
nal defeated by 34 points in
Maples Pavilion a month ago. "I
felt we weren't playing with the
intensity we needed to."

An adjustment by Stanford in
the second half helped stop
Stafford, who had 17 first half
points and kept the Bears close
with her scoring. The Cardinal
had been pressuring the Bears'
guards on the wings, leaving
Stafford open inside. The Bear
star had a quieter 14 in the sec
ond half.
"We worked a little harder on
Stafford in the second half,"
Zeilstra said. "She had a great
game though."
But it was Henning who had
the night to remember. Her first
assist of her personal-high 15
gave her 700 for her career, mak
ing the Cardinal co-captain only
the 10th player in women's bas
ketball history to accomplish
that feat. She also had five
steals, which gave her a share of
the Pac-10 career record (with
Jennifer Azzi) with 271 total
thefts.
"Henning doesn't have to
score to beat you," Cal coach
Gooch Foster said.
Cal played an inspired game,
partly because it was saying
goodbye to top seniors
Palmisano and Laura Baker. For
those players, it was a last
chance to beat their cross-Bay
rivals, who have defeated Cal the
last eight meetings.
