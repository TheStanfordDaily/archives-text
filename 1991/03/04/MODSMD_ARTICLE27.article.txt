# Fewer mistakes equals victory
## 
### Robert Pardington Senior staff writer 
The basketball Big Game usu
ally lacks a little something com
pared to its football counterpart,
but Saturday's California-Stan
ford was missing more "some
thing" than usual. It was basically
an uneventful, grind-it-out game
that the Cardinal won by making
fewer mistakes.
Stanford committed a grand
total of two turnovers on the
game, one in each half. The Car
dinal shot a not-entirely-amazing,
but very good 30 for 39 from the
free throw line. On the game,
Stanford shot an unimpressive,
but steady, 49.1 percent on field
goals.
Basically, the Cardinal just
"out-steadied" the visiting Golden
Bears.
"I just think it was concentra
tion," Stanford Coach Mike Mont
gomery said. "We just didn't make
a lot of errant plays. It wasn't
until the end that we missed some
passes."
This was a game that, taking
Keefe's 24 points and nine re
bounds as a given, was decided in
large part by the play of senior
guards John Patrick and Kenny
Ammann. Patrick and Ammann
combined for 31 points and,
importantly, zero turnovers in
their last home game.
For most of the game, however,
Ammann was joined in the back
court by guard Marcus Lollie.
Patrick moved to small forward
because starting three-man Brent
Williams gathered a quick three
fouls.
With a three-guard lineup most
of the way, the Cardinal had more
than enough ball handling to
break Cal's full-court press. Stan
ford made the Bears' press look
"token," even though it wasn't
intended to be.
"We went to the three guards,

'We went to three
guards and it hap
pened to be a bless
ing in disguise.'

and it happened to be a blessing in
disguise," Montgomery said.
Lollie had a career-high nine
assists, and also went error free,
committing no turnovers. His
penetration and passing kept the
Cardinal offense running
smoothly. Patrick added five
assists to his 18 points.
"We had a veteran club," Patrick
said, explaining why the team was
so mistake-free, "With Lollie in at
point guard, we had three people
who can handle the ball.
"We were executing the offense
well. .. . We were setting screens
for each other."
Montgomery added that the
team "moved the ball well."
"We were doing the things fun
damentally that you need to do,"
he said, "it's the way we should
play all the time."
Although Stanford won by 18
points, Cal was on top by as much
as 10 in the first half. Then the
Cardinal went on a very gradual
but effective run that stretched
until the end of the first half and
picked up right where it left off in
the second period.
There were no really spectacu
lar plays, no out-of-this-world
slam dunks. Just tough, well
played basketball.
"I told the kids that I thought
the thing we did best was that we
played hard and we played
smart," Montgomery said.
That was all it took Saturday to
put Stanford one step closer to a
possible National Invitation Tour
nament berth.
