# Netters Stark and Palmer repeat in LaJolla tourney
## 
### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
Jonathan Stark is back.
Stanford's No. 1 singles and
doubles player tested his stress
fractured foot for the first time
since November at the Pacific
Coast Doubles Tournament this
weekend, and the result was a
defense of his and partner Jared
Palmer's title.
Stark and Palmer, the third
seeded team in the three-day tour
nament, downed top-seeded
Byron Black and Brian McPhie of
USC 6-7, 6-2, 6-3 to capture the
doubles title for the second year in
a row.
While the victory was a wel
come addition to the duo's portfo
lio, the big news was that Stark's
survived the tournament without
a relapse or any apparent pain,
and that Stark and Palmer are
working their way back to last
season's form.
"We're delighted that Jon made
it through the tournament with
his foot in good health," coach
Dick Gould said. "Jared served
well and moved well. It's good to
see them back together."
While it took a few rounds for
the team to work off its rust, it
had points to spare in the early
rounds against mediocre oppo

nents, and by the time the duo
faced Black and McPhie it was
playing well together.
"It's hard stepping in after not
playing for months but Jon did a
very good job," Gould explained.
"They got better each match."
Stanford's three other entries
also competed well. The Cardi
nal's No. 2 team of Alex O'Brian
and Jason Yee were defeated by
Black and McPhie 6-1, 6-0 in the
semifinals after easily handling
Ball State's Dan Kronauge and
Scott Campbell 6-2, 6-3 in the
quarters.
"We were looking forward to
playing them because we had been
playing them close in Louisville
[before the match was called], but
we got off to a really slow start
and they jumped on us early," Yee
said.
Doubles specialist Dan Turbow
and new partner Chris Cocotos
made it to the quarterfinals where
they were defeated by Black and
McPhie 6-1, 6-1. Freshmen
Robert Devens and Mike Flana
gan got a couple matches in before
going down to Cal's Brent Peder
sen and Matt Lucena, the tourna
ment's second seed, in the second
round.
"We've got a lot of work, it's
obvious," Gould said. "But we got
some quality matches in."
