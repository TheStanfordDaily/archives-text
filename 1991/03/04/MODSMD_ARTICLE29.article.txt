# Winning streak ends at 76
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
This is the way the streak ends,
not with a whimper but with a
thunderous, devastating bang.
The Stanford women's tennis
team, winners of an NCAA record
76 straight matches, were bent,
folded, spindled and mutilated by
the Florida Gators in the finals of
the National Team Indoors yes
terday in Madison, Wis.
Not only did the Cardinal lose,
the team was shut out, 6-0. Stan
ford is now 11-1 on the season,
Florida is 11-0 and will take over
the No. 1 ranking on the next
Volvo Tennis/Collegiate poll.
Perhaps the best measure of
the magnitude of this loss, save
the fact that it was Stanford's
first since April 15, 1988, is illus
trated at No. 1 and 2 singles. Atop
the lineup, the Gators have Nicole
Arendt and Andrea Farley — both
are among the top players in the
nation.
At first and second singles,
Stanford has Sandra Birch and

Debbie Graham. They are the top
players in the nation. And yester
day, neither had a prayer in the
world. Arendt smashed Birch, 6-0,
6-2, while Farley thumped Gra
ham, 6-2, 6-4. It was only the sec
ond dual-meet loss in three years
for Graham.
"A lot of the match was dictated
by what Nicole and Andrea did,"
Florida coach Andy Brandi said.
"That took some of the steam
from Stanford."
But it fueled the Florida steam
roller in a big way. Erika Kuttler
blitzed Heather Willens at No. 4,
6-0, 6-2 and Holly Danforth
crushed Kylie Jonhson 6-3, 6-2.
The only fights the Cardinal was
able to put up were at No. 3 and 5.
Both Laxmi Poruri and Teri
Whitlinger captured first sets
before dropping the second. Had
each won, the match would have

been forced into doubles where a
Stanford sweep would have given
the Cardinal the match.
The Gators' Jillian Alexander
quashed that notion when she
finally finished off Poruri 7-6 (7-
4), 5-7, 6-4. Knowing that it was
over, Whitlinger then succumbed
to Holly Lloyd 7-5, 4-6, 6-0. The
loss ended her own personal con
secutive dual-match victory
streak at 46.
Stanford coach Frank Brennan
was very matter of fact in dis
cussing the end of his team's
remarkable run. "There was a lot
of luck [involved]," he said.
"There were a lot of great tennis
players who contributed. It was a
great streak, but there's too much
parity in college tennis to keep it
going forever.
"Now it's time to get on with
the business of winning NCAAs. I
know our women would trade the
streak for an NCAA win in a New
York minute."
It will be a couple of New York


Sandra Birch and coach Frank Brennan were a little perplexed after Stanford's loss to the Gators that
ended the Cardinal's winning streak at 76 games.
months before the national cham
pionships roll around, though. On
the other hand, Florida visits
Stanford this coming Sunday with
a chance to do it all over again.
The Cardinal's road to the
finals of this event was so bumpy,
the team's eventual defeat was
not as shocking as it might other
wise have been. In the opener
Thursday against unranked Wis
consin, Stanford escaped with a 5-
4 win.
Friday, things seemed rela
tively normal as the Cardinal took
out Oklahoma State 5-1. The next
day, though, another Southeast
ern Conference school nearly
stopped the streak at 75.
The Georgia Bulldogs, no
doubt sick and tired of Stanford
after losing to the Cardinal at the
last four NCAA championships,
fell behind 3-0 early. Birch
drubbed Shannan McCarthy, 6-3,
6-2; Graham hammered Caryn
Moss, 6-2, 6-1; and Whitlinger
slipped past Angela Lettiere 6-4,
7-6 (8-6).
But the Bulldogs showed some
moxie in coming back at the bot
tom of the lineup. While Poruri
handled Shawn McCarthy, Shan
nan's twin sister, 6-2, 6-3, Willens
fell to Laura Kimel, 6-4, 6-1 and
Kylie Johnson was pummeled by
Tonya Bogdonas, 6-2, 6-0.
With a precarious 4-2 lead
heading into doubles, the Cardi
nal could have sensed the team
was in trouble. But Poruri and
Whitlinger quickly bailed them
out with a 6-0, 6-4 defeat of
Shawn McCarthy and Maria Sals
gard.
Stanford would end up drop
ping the other two doubles
matches to make the final result a
slightly deceptive 5-4.

Stanford's winning streak is
believed to have been the third longest
in any NCAA sport.
Florida beat Stanford in the
Indoors final back in 1988, one of two
losses the Cardinal suffered that sea

Stanford's winning streak is
believed to have been the third longest
in any NCAA sport.
Florida beat Stanford in the
Indoors final back in 1988, one of two
losses the Cardinal suffered that sea
son.
This is the way the streak ends,
not with a whimper but with a
thunderous, devastating bang.
The Stanford women's tennis
team, winners of an NCAA record
76 straight matches, were bent,
folded, spindled and mutilated by
the Florida Gators in the finals of
the National Team Indoors yes
terday in Madison, Wis.
Not only did the Cardinal lose,
the team was shut out, 6-0. Stan
ford is now 11-1 on the season,
Florida is 11-0 and will take over
the No. 1 ranking on the next
Volvo Tennis/Collegiate poll.
Perhaps the best measure of
the magnitude of this loss, save
the fact that it was Stanford's
first since April 15, 1988, is illus
trated at No. 1 and 2 singles. Atop
the lineup, the Gators have Nicole
Arendt and Andrea Farley — both
are among the top players in the
nation.
At first and second singles,
Stanford has Sandra Birch and

Debbie Graham. They are the top
players in the nation. And yester
day, neither had a prayer in the
world. Arendt smashed Birch, 6-0,
6-2, while Farley thumped Gra
ham, 6-2, 6-4. It was only the sec
ond dual-meet loss in three years
for Graham.
"A lot of the match was dictated
by what Nicole and Andrea did,"
Florida coach Andy Brandi said.
"That took some of the steam
from Stanford."
But it fueled the Florida steam
roller in a big way. Erika Kuttler
blitzed Heather Willens at No. 4,
6-0, 6-2 and Holly Danforth
crushed Kylie Jonhson 6-3, 6-2.
The only fights the Cardinal was
able to put up were at No. 3 and 5.
Both Laxmi Poruri and Teri
Whitlinger captured first sets
before dropping the second. Had
each won, the match would have

been forced into doubles where a
Stanford sweep would have given
the Cardinal the match.
The Gators' Jillian Alexander
quashed that notion when she
finally finished off Poruri 7-6 (7-
4), 5-7, 6-4. Knowing that it was
over, Whitlinger then succumbed
to Holly Lloyd 7-5, 4-6, 6-0. The
loss ended her own personal con
secutive dual-match victory
streak at 46.
Stanford coach Frank Brennan
was very matter of fact in dis
cussing the end of his team's
remarkable run. "There was a lot
of luck [involved]," he said.
"There were a lot of great tennis
players who contributed. It was a
great streak, but there's too much
parity in college tennis to keep it
going forever.
"Now it's time to get on with
the business of winning NCAAs. I
know our women would trade the
streak for an NCAA win in a New
York minute."
It will be a couple of New York


Sandra Birch and coach Frank Brennan were a little perplexed after Stanford's loss to the Gators that
ended the Cardinal's winning streak at 76 games.
months before the national cham
pionships roll around, though. On
the other hand, Florida visits
Stanford this coming Sunday with
a chance to do it all over again.
The Cardinal's road to the
finals of this event was so bumpy,
the team's eventual defeat was
not as shocking as it might other
wise have been. In the opener
Thursday against unranked Wis
consin, Stanford escaped with a 5-
4 win.
Friday, things seemed rela
tively normal as the Cardinal took
out Oklahoma State 5-1. The next
day, though, another Southeast
ern Conference school nearly
stopped the streak at 75.
The Georgia Bulldogs, no
doubt sick and tired of Stanford
after losing to the Cardinal at the
last four NCAA championships,
fell behind 3-0 early. Birch
drubbed Shannan McCarthy, 6-3,
6-2; Graham hammered Caryn
Moss, 6-2, 6-1; and Whitlinger
slipped past Angela Lettiere 6-4,
7-6 (8-6).
But the Bulldogs showed some
moxie in coming back at the bot
tom of the lineup. While Poruri
handled Shawn McCarthy, Shan
nan's twin sister, 6-2, 6-3, Willens
fell to Laura Kimel, 6-4, 6-1 and
Kylie Johnson was pummeled by
Tonya Bogdonas, 6-2, 6-0.
With a precarious 4-2 lead
