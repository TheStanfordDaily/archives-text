# Winning streak ends at 76

### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
This is the way the streak ends,
not with a whimper but with a
thunderous, devastating bang.
The Stanford women's tennis
team, winners of an NCAA record
76 straight matches, were bent,
folded, spindled and mutilated by
the Florida Gators in the finals of
the National Team Indoors yes
terday in Madison, Wis.
Not only did the Cardinal lose,
the team was shut out, 6-0. Stan
ford is now 11-1 on the season,
Florida is 11-0 and will take over
the No. 1 ranking on the next
Volvo Tennis/Collegiate poll.
Perhaps the best measure of
the magnitude of this loss, save
the fact that it was Stanford's
first since April 15, 1988, is illus
trated at No. 1 and 2 singles. Atop
the lineup, the Gators have Nicole
Arendt and Andrea Farley â€” both
are among the top players in the
nation.
At first and second singles,
Stanford has Sandra Birch and

Cardinal 0

Debbie Graham. They are the top
players in the nation. And yester
day, neither had a prayer in the
world. Arendt smashed Birch, 6-0,
6-2, while Farley thumped Gra
ham, 6-2, 6-4. It was only the sec
ond dual-meet loss in three years
for Graham.
"A lot of the match was dictated
by what Nicole and Andrea did,"
Florida coach Andy Brandi said.
"That took some of the steam
from Stanford."
But it fueled the Florida steam
roller in a big way. Erika Kuttler
blitzed Heather Willens at No. 4,
6-0, 6-2 and Holly Danforth
crushed Kylie Jonhson 6-3, 6-2.
The only fights the Cardinal was
able to put up were at No. 3 and 5.
Both Laxmi Poruri and Teri
Whitlinger captured first sets
before dropping the second. Had
each won, the match would have

been forced into doubles where a
Stanford sweep would have given
the Cardinal the match.
The Gators' Jillian Alexander
quashed that notion when she
finally finished off Poruri 7-6 (7-
4), 5-7, 6-4. Knowing that it was
over, Whitlinger then succumbed
to Holly Lloyd 7-5, 4-6, 6-0. The
loss ended her own personal con
secutive dual-match victory
streak at 46.
Stanford coach Frank Brennan
was very matter of fact in dis
cussing the end of his team's
remarkable run. "There was a lot
of luck [involved]," he said.
"There were a lot of great tennis
players who contributed. It was a
great streak, but there's too much
parity in college tennis to keep it
going forever.
"Now it's time to get on with
the business of winning NCAAs. I
know our women would trade the
streak for an NCAA win in a New
York minute."
It will be a couple of New York


Sandra Birch and coach Frank Brennan were a little perplexed after Stanford's loss to the Gators that
ended the Cardinal's winning streak at 76 games.
