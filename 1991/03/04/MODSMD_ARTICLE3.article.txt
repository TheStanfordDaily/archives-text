# $7M teaching initiative announced
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
University President Donald Kennedy
announced $7 million in new programs yes
terday to improve undergraduate teaching
at Stanford.
The package of initiatives — which
includes funds for developing new courses
and cash bonuses for outstanding teachers
— follows up on Kennedy's landmark
speech last April, where he called for a
greater emphasis on teaching in the Uni
versity's second century.
In addition to the new programs,
Kennedy proposed significant modifica
tions to the faculty appointment and pro
motion process in order to place more
weight on teaching ability (please see
related story).
Teaching "just isn't talked about enough
here," Kennedy said in an interview over
the weekend. The initiatives, he said, "will
be another step in getting it talked about."
The new programs were made possible
by gifts to the University, most notably a $5
million donation by Stanford trustee Peter
Bing and his wife, Helen.
The initiatives announced yesterday
include:
• Base-salary additions of $1,000 given
to 20 superior teachers each year in the
School of Humanities and Sciences,
• One-time cash bonuses of $5,000
awarded to up to 10 of the best teachers
each year in Humanities and Sciences,
• Four $10,000 grants given to senior
faculty to carry out innovations in teaching,

• Financial-support
incentives for younger fac
ulty to develop new cours
es and seminars,
• Salary increases for
lecturers in the Freshman
English and the Cultures,
Ideas and Values pro
grams,
• Cash awards for out
standing graduate student

teaching assistants, and
• Increased funding for Peters Seminars,
an existing program in which faculty from
the professional schools teach interdisci
plinary seminars to sophomores.
In addition, it was announced that Apple
Computer Inc. had donated $600,000 in
new computer equipment to be used to
improve undergraduate teaching in scien
tific fields.
The gifts come at an extremely oppor
tune time for the University, which is feel
ing severe financial pressures. Last month,
Provost James Rosse announced to the fac
ulty that a deficit of up to $5.5 million is
likely this year. Furthermore, he said,
department budgets may not keep pace
with inflation next year, allowing for little
new program growth.
Most curricular innovation during the
next few years will be the result of realloca
tion of resources, Kennedy said. "If you
want to do something new, you have to give
up something old."
But the $7 million in gifts will make
