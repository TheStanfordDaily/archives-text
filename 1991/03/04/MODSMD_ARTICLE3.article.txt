# $7M teaching initiative announced
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
University President Donald Kennedy
announced $7 million in new programs yes
terday to improve undergraduate teaching
at Stanford.
The package of initiatives — which
includes funds for developing new courses
and cash bonuses for outstanding teachers
— follows up on Kennedy's landmark
speech last April, where he called for a
greater emphasis on teaching in the Uni
versity's second century.
In addition to the new programs,
Kennedy proposed significant modifica
tions to the faculty appointment and pro
motion process in order to place more
weight on teaching ability (please see
related story).
Teaching "just isn't talked about enough
here," Kennedy said in an interview over
the weekend. The initiatives, he said, "will
be another step in getting it talked about."
The new programs were made possible
by gifts to the University, most notably a $5
million donation by Stanford trustee Peter
Bing and his wife, Helen.
The initiatives announced yesterday
include:
• Base-salary additions of $1,000 given
to 20 superior teachers each year in the
School of Humanities and Sciences,
• One-time cash bonuses of $5,000
awarded to up to 10 of the best teachers
each year in Humanities and Sciences,
• Four $10,000 grants given to senior
faculty to carry out innovations in teaching,

• Financial-support
incentives for younger fac
ulty to develop new cours
es and seminars,
• Salary increases for
lecturers in the Freshman
English and the Cultures,
Ideas and Values pro
grams,
• Cash awards for out
standing graduate student

teaching assistants, and
• Increased funding for Peters Seminars,
an existing program in which faculty from
the professional schools teach interdisci
plinary seminars to sophomores.
In addition, it was announced that Apple
Computer Inc. had donated $600,000 in
new computer equipment to be used to
improve undergraduate teaching in scien
tific fields.
The gifts come at an extremely oppor
tune time for the University, which is feel
ing severe financial pressures. Last month,
Provost James Rosse announced to the fac
ulty that a deficit of up to $5.5 million is
likely this year. Furthermore, he said,
department budgets may not keep pace
with inflation next year, allowing for little
new program growth.
Most curricular innovation during the
next few years will be the result of realloca
tion of resources, Kennedy said. "If you
want to do something new, you have to give
up something old."
But the $7 million in gifts will make


Bing
some curricular innovation possi
ble without sacrificing anything
else. "Being able to put new
money behind change is valuable
because politically you don't have
to deprive one purpose or con
stituency to promote another,"
Kennedy explained.
"The timing couldn't have
been better," said Ewart Thomas,
dean of humanities and sciences.
Thomas was instrumental in
developing many of the new ini
tiatives, which will have the
largest impact on the School of
Humanities and Sciences. The
school accounts for about 80 per
cent of Stanford's undergraduate
teaching.
The Persian Gulf war provided
an example of why curricular
innovations are needed, Thomas
noted. "The war showed us we
don't know too much about other
cultures," he said.
Thomas said he was particu
larly interested in curricular
innovations that would "reduce

the student-faculty ratio," such
as small seminars and opportuni
ties for one-on-one work between
professors and students.

One such initiative is the
strengthening of the Peters Semi
nars program, which is targeted
at sophomores. "That's the time
we would really like to form some
connections between individual
students and individual faculty
members," Kennedy said.
Kennedy added that he would
also like to see an increase in the
number of students who do inde
pendent study or honors work,
activities that involve close work
with an individual professor.
The salary increases and cash
bonuses that will be given to out
standing teachers are "a way of
producing recognition" to those
who are making extraordinary
contributions to undergraduate
education, Kennedy said.
"It's plain to us that we are
somewhat under-rewarding some
of our very best teachers," he
said. "We need to fix that."
Bing, the trustee who donated
$5 million, wanted to "leverage us
into a system where teaching is a
little more recognized in the

salary-setting process," Kennedy
said.
The selection method for fac
ulty recipients of the salary
increases and bonuses has not
been finalized.
Following his speech last April,
Kennedy said, some professors
raised concerns that by calling
attention to Stanford's efforts to
improve its teaching, he was pub
licly announcing that the school
had a problem.
But that's not the case,
Kennedy said. "I'm not asserting
that the quality of undergraduate
education is bad here," he said.
"To the contrary, I think it's good
and getting better. But I think we
can, if we pay some attention to it,
make it better still."
Kennedy said he was not sure
how other research universities
would react to his latest initia
tives.
Some "might take a different
view about the dangers of calling
public attention" to teaching
improvements, he said. "To them,
this initiative may seem unwise. I
hope that's not the general reac
tion."
