# Cardinal women swim to Pac-10 title

FEDERAL WAY, Wash. -
Going into this year's Pacific 10
Conference Women's Swimming
and Diving Championships, the
question was not which team
would win, but by how much
Stanford would prevail. And while
the answer of 276 points made
this the closest meet since then
Cardinal won the initial Pac-10
title in 1987, there was no doubt
at all that the team from the Farm
was clearly superior to the compe
tition.
After opening up a 96-point
lead over third-ranked California
Thursday, the top-ranked Cardi
nal kept rolling through the sec
ond and third days of the meet.
When all was said and done at the
King County Aquatic Center, the
Cardinal outscored the Bears
1640-1364. No. 6 UCLA tallied
1221.5 points for a strong third
place finish while No. 17 Arizona
State took fourth at 910.
Arizona was fifth at 835 and
No. 5 USC (757.5), Oregon State
(374), Washington State (284) and
Washington (279) rounded out the
field.
Sophomore Janet Evans won
three events for the Cardinal to tie
Arizona's Crissy Ahmann-
Leighton for high-point honors.
Lori Heisick, Summer Sanders
and diver Eileen Richetelli each
won twice for the Cardinal.
Stanford also had four more
swimmers qualify for the NCAA
championships over the weekend,
bringing the total to 18, one more
than the team can bring to the
meet.
Friday morning, junior Susan
Johnson posted a qualifying time
in the 100-yard breaststroke and
sophomore Anne Mahoney quali
fied in the 100 backstroke. It was
especially sweet for Johnson, a
Seattle native, because her par
ents worked at the meet as offi
cials and her father was the

starter for the race in which she
qualified.
"I'm very relieved and excited,"
she said. "I wasn't really thinking
about it during the race but when
I know there are more people I
know watching me, it gives me
added incentive."
Junior J.T. Toton qualified in
the 100 breaststroke finals Friday
night and sophomore Katherine
Comanor qualified in the 1,650
freestyle Saturday. While John
son, Mahoney and Toton com
peted at NCAAs last year, this was
a first for Comanor. "Last year I
was happy with the way I swam
but I wasn't really expecting to
qualify," she said. "I thought I
improved a lot this year from last
year so 1 was more expecting to
make it."
"From a team standpoint, it
was a great meet," Janel Jor
gensen said. "The people who
needed to come through did. . ..
That puts us in a great position
for NCAAs. I don't think any
other team has qualified as many
people as we have."
In addition to accomplishing
the goal of qualifying more swim
mers for NCAAs, the Cardinal
also won a few races. Friday began
with the 200 medley relay team
grabbing a second-place finish.
In the next event, the 400 indi
vidual medley, Sanders set a meet
record in the preliminaries but
didn't swim at night because she
was swimming the 100 butterfly
instead that day. That night,
Evans defended her Pac-10 title in
the event with Comanor taking
fifth and Eva Mortensen nabbing
seventh.
Ahmann-Leighton then upset
Jorgensen, the defending NCAA
champ, in the 100 butterfly. It was
then first time Jorgensen had lost
a 100-yard butterfly race in six
years. "It was kind of sad to see
that streak end," she said.
Sionainn Marcoux and Karen
Kraemer finaled in the 200
freestyle to pad the Cardinal lead

before Heisick won the 100
breaststroke. Toton and Johnson
took fourth and seventh, respec
tively.
Mahoney placed second in the
100 backstroke and Dede Trimble
took fifth and then the team of
Mortensen, Evans, Marcoux and
Jorgensen set a new meet record
in winning the 800 freestyle relay.
Saturday was more of the
same. Evans easily won the 1,650
freestyle with Mortensen taking
third, Marcoux sixth, Comanor
seventh, Barb Metz eighth and
Kraemer ninth. When Trimble
won her first-ever Pac-10 title in
the 200 backstroke minutes later,
the meet was clearly over.
Heisick ran away with the 200
breaststroke with Toton and
Johnson getting sixth and sev
enth. "I think the competition was
a lot tougher this year than last
year so I'm really happy I won
both breaststrokes," Heisick said.
Sanders, Jorgensen and senior
Michelle Griglione then swept the
200 butterfly, with Sanders break
ing Mary T. Meagher's long-stand
ing meet record. Sanders, Suzy
Buckovich, Griglione and Jor
gensen won the 400 freestyle relay
At the Pac-10 diving champi
onships, held in rainy Southern
California, Richetelli followed up
her victory in the three-meter
competition Thursday with a nar
row win in the one-meter Friday.
The freshman is now qualified for
the NCAA championships in both
events.
Saturday Richetelli got second
in the platform competition with
teammates Melisa Kuller and
Kristin Jensen taking fourth and
fifth. Kuller was also fourth in the
one-meter competition.
"I think we all swam real well
and it's a good step toward
NCAAs," Sanders said. "I think
I'll start getting more excited
when we get to rest more. But I'm
starting to get excited because
we're all starting to swim well and
feel good in the water."

this the closest meet since then
Cardinal won the initial Pac-10
title in 1987, there was no doubt
at all that the team from the Farm
was clearly superior to the compe
tition.
After opening up a 96-point
lead over third-ranked California
Thursday, the top-ranked Cardi
nal kept rolling through the sec
ond and third days of the meet.
When all was said and done at the
King County Aquatic Center, the
Cardinal outscored the Bears
1640-1364. No. 6 UCLA tallied
1221.5 points for a strong third
place finish while No. 17 Arizona
State took fourth at 910.
Arizona was fifth at 835 and
No. 5 USC (757.5), Oregon State
(374), Washington State (284) and
Washington (279) rounded out the
field.
Sophomore Janet Evans won
three events for the Cardinal to tie
Arizona's Crissy Ahmann-
Leighton for high-point honors.
Lori Heisick, Summer Sanders
and diver Eileen Richetelli each
won twice for the Cardinal.
Stanford also had four more
swimmers qualify for the NCAA
championships over the weekend,
bringing the total to 18, one more
than the team can bring to the
meet.
Friday morning, junior Susan
Johnson posted a qualifying time
in the 100-yard breaststroke and
sophomore Anne Mahoney quali
fied in the 100 backstroke. It was
especially sweet for Johnson, a
Seattle native, because her par
ents worked at the meet as offi
cials and her father was the

starter for the race in which she
qualified.
"I'm very relieved and excited,"
she said. "I wasn't really thinking
about it during the race but when
I know there are more people I
know watching me, it gives me
added incentive."
Junior J.T. Toton qualified in
the 100 breaststroke finals Friday
night and sophomore Katherine
Comanor qualified in the 1,650
freestyle Saturday. While John
son, Mahoney and Toton com
peted at NCAAs last year, this was
a first for Comanor. "Last year I
was happy with the way I swam
but I wasn't really expecting to
qualify," she said. "I thought I
improved a lot this year from last
year so 1 was more expecting to
make it."
"From a team standpoint, it
was a great meet," Janel Jor
gensen said. "The people who
needed to come through did. . ..
That puts us in a great position
for NCAAs. I don't think any
other team has qualified as many
people as we have."
In addition to accomplishing
the goal of qualifying more swim
mers for NCAAs, the Cardinal
also won a few races. Friday began
with the 200 medley relay team
grabbing a second-place finish.
In the next event, the 400 indi
vidual medley, Sanders set a meet
record in the preliminaries but
didn't swim at night because she
was swimming the 100 butterfly
instead that day. That night,
Evans defended her Pac-10 title in
the event with Comanor taking
fifth and Eva Mortensen nabbing
seventh.
Ahmann-Leighton then upset
Jorgensen, the defending NCAA
champ, in the 100 butterfly. It was
then first time Jorgensen had lost
a 100-yard butterfly race in six
years. "It was kind of sad to see
that streak end," she said.
Sionainn Marcoux and Karen
Kraemer finaled in the 200
freestyle to pad the Cardinal lead

before Heisick won the 100
breaststroke. Toton and Johnson
took fourth and seventh, respec
tively.
Mahoney placed second in the
100 backstroke and Dede Trimble
took fifth and then the team of
Mortensen, Evans, Marcoux and
Jorgensen set a new meet record
in winning the 800 freestyle relay.
Saturday was more of the
same. Evans easily won the 1,650
freestyle with Mortensen taking
third, Marcoux sixth, Comanor
seventh, Barb Metz eighth and
Kraemer ninth. When Trimble
won her first-ever Pac-10 title in
the 200 backstroke minutes later,
the meet was clearly over.
Heisick ran away with the 200
breaststroke with Toton and
Johnson getting sixth and sev
enth. "I think the competition was
a lot tougher this year than last
year so I'm really happy I won
both breaststrokes," Heisick said.
Sanders, Jorgensen and senior
Michelle Griglione then swept the
200 butterfly, with Sanders break
ing Mary T. Meagher's long-stand
ing meet record. Sanders, Suzy
Buckovich, Griglione and Jor
gensen won the 400 freestyle relay
At the Pac-10 diving champi
onships, held in rainy Southern
California, Richetelli followed up
her victory in the three-meter
competition Thursday with a nar
row win in the one-meter Friday.
The freshman is now qualified for
the NCAA championships in both
events.
Saturday Richetelli got second
in the platform competition with
teammates Melisa Kuller and
Kristin Jensen taking fourth and
fifth. Kuller was also fourth in the
one-meter competition.
"I think we all swam real well
and it's a good step toward
NCAAs," Sanders said. "I think
I'll start getting more excited
when we get to rest more. But I'm
starting to get excited because
we're all starting to swim well and
feel good in the water."
