# Stanford rolls easily at home
## 
### Noah Blake Staff writer 
If you weren't in Maples
Pavilion last Friday night, you
should have been. It was your
last chance to see the Stanford
men's gymnastics team, a team
steamrolling toward the nation
al championship, compete on
the Farm this season.
In flattening Michigan and
San Jose State, the Cardinal put
it all together, setting school
records left and right. Before
the meet, Stanford was consid
ered a fourth-ranked, promising
team with a chance for the
NCAA title. In the meet, the
team scored a '286.80 which,
according to coach Sadao
Hamada, is the highest score
put up by any team in the
nation this year.
Right now, the Cardinal has
got to be considered one of the
favorites for the NCAA title.
Leading Stanford and bat
tling for the all-around title
were sophomore All-America
Jair Lynch and superfrosh
Mark Booth. Booth scored over
9.7 on five of six events, with
9.85s on floor exercise and high
bar. He won both the floor exer
cise and the vault and finished
only one tenth of a point behind
Lynch, the all-around cham-

pion, with a 58.30.
Lynch had the top score on
high bar, pommel horse, and
parallel bars, with scores of (no
typo here) 9.90, 9.90 and 9.95,
respectively. His parallel bars
routine did receive a perfect 10
from one of the two judges "I've
been around Olympic and World
Championship competitions,"
Hamada said, "and some of the
routines that Jair and Mark are
doing could win an Olympic gold
medal."
Freshman Chris Sey scored a
9.80 on rings to complete a Car
dinal sweep of the individual
event titles, and his 56.80 all
around score placed him third in
the meet.
These scores sound unbeliev
able, and yet Hamada claims
that the that they are not
inflated. "The judging was not
that easy, nor was it that tight
— it was just average," he said.
"And we have witnesses from
back East in Michigan. Their
score is what they are averaging
back home. When they go back,
everyone will ask if Stanford is

really that tough, and they will
have to say, 'Yes.' "
And the scariest part is that
the Cardinal can still get better.
The 1989 national champion,
Cardinal junior Tim Ryan, is
still working his way back into
form after a year of injury.
Hamada believes, however, that
Ryan will be ready for the
NCAAs. "He's still missing a lot
. . . but Tim will be there when
we need him. He's a veteran."
So is senior Tim Wang, who
has been nursing a hamstring
injury. And with seven weeks
left until the NCAA meet,
Hamada has to be thinking
about how good the Cardinal
will be when it has it's Tims
healthy.
But the team is not resting
on its laurels. In addition to
keeping everyone healthy,
Hamada would like to improve
the scores of the team's first
three gymnasts on each event.
According to Hamada, improv
ing these scores is easier to do
than improving the scores of a
Lynch or a Booth.
"Once you are up around 9.9,
how much can you improve?"
Hamada said. "But we can bring
up 9.3s to 9.5s very quickly. If
we bring those guys up, there is
no way that we can lose."
