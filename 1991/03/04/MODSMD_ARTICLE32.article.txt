### George Malone Staff writer 
Today and tomorrow, the
Stanford men's golf team is
taking advantage of an
opportunity.
Coach Wally Goodwin is
letting his top five golfers
catch up on studying and
while he takes another part
of the team to the Sacra
mento State University
tournament to get some
needed tournament experi
ence.
Senior Johan Remmel
gas, sophomores Brad Lan
ning and Edwin Lee, and
juniors Chris Doble and Jeff
Miehe will head for Rancho
Marieta golf course in
Sacramento and begin play
today.
"It's a good chance to get
these guys some experience.
... I can have a look at them
for the sixth spot on the
team in upcoming tourna
ments," coach Wally Good
win said.
"It's just practice, but
we'd like to win it," Edwin
Lee added.
Rancho Marieta is a
tough course and, since it
will probably rain, the team
will have to play tough to do
well.
"We've all been playing in
the rain [this week] — we've
been playing in the wind so
we should be ready for the
weather. It's pretty mental
— the team that keeps its
head in it is going to win,"
Lanning said.
