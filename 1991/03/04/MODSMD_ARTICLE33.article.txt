# Women gymnasts take SJSU
## 
### Brandi Shipp Staff writer 
The Stanford women's gym
nastics team dominated Maples
Pavilion Friday night in their
impressive win over the San Jose
State team.
The pavilion was packed this
weekend as both Stanford's men's
and women's gymnastics teams
shared the floor for their first
meet together this season. With
all of the events going at the same
time, the six-ring circus atmo
sphere did not distract the Cardi
nal women, who led from start to
finish, ending with 185.15 points
over San Jose's 180.1 points.
"This [winl feels good. We per
formed well," coach Breck Green
wood said. The competition was
actually a two-fold victory for the
team. While outscoring the San
Jose State gymnasts, the Stanford
women also premiered revamped
routines with increased levels of
difficulty.
These changes were primarily
in preparation for the Pacific 10
Conference Championships, held
in just two short weeks. Overall,
the team seemed pleased with the
new performances. "We had good
success with the new skills that
we tried tonight," Greenwood
said. "They worked out fairly
well."

both debuted new routines with
added difficulty and scored well.
Kanuka and Kelley led the team
on bars.
On the floor exercise, freshman
Mollie Brown premiered a new
tumbling pass, which helped boost
her score and the overall team
score. The highlight in the floor
exercise, however, was sophomore
Erin McCann's routine.
Slowly recovering from an
ankle injury, McCann was able to
perform her first floor routine of
the season, a definite plus for the
team. McCann will hopefully be
strong enough to be an important
factor in the team's performance
in Pac-lOs in two weeks.
In the balance beam competi
tion, senior Julie Dunhill helped
the team tremendously. "Julie has
done a great job for us on the bal
ance beam over the past two
weeks," Greenwood said. In both
of the last meets, Dunhill was
notified that she would be compet
ing in that event at the last
minute.
Her lack of early notification,
however, has not affected her per
formance. This was proven by her
great performance Friday

evening.
The biggest disappointment for
the team on Friday night was that
an injury that prevented Kanuka
from competing in all-around as
usual- "Kerri Kanuka has an
inflamed tendon in her foot,"
Greenwood explained. "We
decided to rest her to save her
foot."
Every cloud has a silver lining,
though. With Kanuka unable to
compete in most of the events,
Stanford's other top gymnasts got
a chance to bask in the spotlight.
Kelley, usually second to Kanuka,
earned first place honors in the
all-around competition with
incredible performances. "It feels
very good," Kelley said. "I had a
new bar routine that I hit, so its
pretty exciting."
With only one more meet until
the conference championships,
the Stanford women plan to go all
out during the next two weeks.
Although Friday's performance
was a giant step in the right direc
tion, they still see more room for
improvement.
"We need to keep getting
healthy, of course," Greenwood
said. "We also need to be more
aggressive and confident on the
beam." With some new tricks still
in the works, the team seems con
fident about the future. "We are
performing well now, so we'll see
what happens," Greenwood
added.
