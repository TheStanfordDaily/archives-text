# Skeels' single secures Stanford success
## 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
In its attempt to do a pre
drought Lake Lag imitation,
Sunken Diamond proved a very
unhospitable place for the visiting
Arizona Wildcats. The 'Cats usu
ally would feel at home in the
desert-like atmosphere that the
Bay Area has been of late, but the
only thing that came up dry this
weekend were the boys from
Tempe.
Because of the rain, Saturday
saw the first, and only, game of
the scheduled three-game series.
The 450 fans who braved the cold
and wind to catch the contest
were rewarded (?) with an extra
inning Cardinal victory when
Mark Skeels stroked a bases
loaded single in the bottom of the
10th to lift Stanford over Arizona,
4-3.
With his hit, Skeels became the
latest clutch player in the ever
growing list of Cardinal close
calls.
"The good thing about this
team is that it seems to be a differ
ent guy each week (making the big
play)," Stanford coach Mark Mar
quess said. "We are a really bal
anced team and that pleases me."
Skeels was given the oppurtu
nity to play hero after Wildcat
releiver Todd Ingram made the
quintessential pitching faux pas
by balking with men on first and
second with no outs and the score
tied.
Ryan Turner had led off the
inning with a double, and, after
being replaced by pinch runner
David Cornell, was followed on
base by the intentionally walked
David Holbrook. The balk
advanced the runners to second
and third, and Troy Tallman was
also intentially walked in hopes
that Skeels would hit into a dou
ble play.
As Skeels stood in the on-deck
circle, Marquess took the opportu
nity to run out and have a little

Baseball

chat with his number eight hitter.
"I thought that he was going to
tell me that we were going to
squeeze (bunt)," Skeels said.
"[But] he just came out and reas
sured me that I did not have to
take any pitches; that I could
swing away."
Skeels wasted little time fol
lowing his coach's orders. The
book on the switch hitter says
that he likes to take the first fast
ball he gets his eye on, and Ingram
let him see it right away. Skeels
lined the right-hander's first pitch
for the game-winning single, and
the shivering crowd was finally
able to head for their cars.
"I was looking to get a good
pitch to hit that was around the
plate, and he gave it to me,"
Skeels said. "I just tried to hit it
hard."
Any problems with the nerves?
"I was pretty relaxed," Skeels
said. "With no outs the pressure
wasn't on me; it would have been
pretty hard for me to hit into a
triple play."
The Cardinal, ranked No. 1 in
country by Baseball America and
No. 2 in the Collegiate
Baseball/ESPN poll, improved its
record to 17-3 while maintaining a
firm grasp on first place in the
Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division by staying undefeated at
4-0. Arizona dropped to 1-3 in Six-
Pac play, 12-12 overall.
Stanford was leading the game
3-1 in the seventh when Cardinal
starter John Reid allowed men on
second and third with only one
out. Marquess went to his bullpen
and stopper Aaron Dorlarque
quickly defused the situation, only
to create his own problems in the
next inning.
Dorlarque ran into a pack of
Wildcat pinch hitters in the eighth

and Arizona was able to tie the
game, ending the right-hander's
string of 28% innings of scoreless
ball. Wildcat coach Jerry Kindall
used three pinch hitters in the
inning and all three got hits.
After pinch hitter Steve Lock
ett's double up the left field alley
scored leadoff (pinch) hitter R.D.
Long to make the score 3-2, Dor
larque struck out Phil Echeverria
and had two strikes on pinch hit
ter No. 3 Mike Suarez, but Suarez
managed to ground a single just
past first baseman Dave McCarty
to bring in the tying run.
Dorlarque suddenly had to stop
thinking about saving starter
John Reid's win, and concentrate
on the task at hand.
"I went through a little mental
maintenence," Dorlarque said. "I
had to go out there and not lose
sight of the fact I that I still had a
job to do and we had a game to
win."
Dorlarque was able to get out
of the eighth and had little trouble
keeping the Wildcats scoreless
until the Cardinal offense took
over in the bottom of the 10th.

Long to make the score 3-2, Dor
larque struck out Phil Echeverria
and had two strikes on pinch hit
ter No. 3 Mike Suarez, but Suarez
managed to ground a single just
past first baseman Dave McCarty
to bring in the tying run.
Dorlarque suddenly had to stop
thinking about saving starter
John Reid's win, and concentrate
on the task at hand.
"I went through a little mental
maintenence," Dorlarque said. "I
had to go out there and not lose
sight of the fact I that I still had a
job to do and we had a game to
win."
Dorlarque was able to get out
of the eighth and had little trouble
keeping the Wildcats scoreless
until the Cardinal offense took
over in the bottom of the 10th.

Mark Skeels loosens up before knocking in the game winner.
In its attempt to do a pre
drought Lake Lag imitation,
Sunken Diamond proved a very
unhospitable place for the visiting
Arizona Wildcats. The 'Cats usu
ally would feel at home in the
desert-like atmosphere that the
Bay Area has been of late, but the
only thing that came up dry this
weekend were the boys from
Tempe.
Because of the rain, Saturday
saw the first, and only, game of
the scheduled three-game series.
The 450 fans who braved the cold
and wind to catch the contest
were rewarded (?) with an extra
inning Cardinal victory when
Mark Skeels stroked a bases
loaded single in the bottom of the
10th to lift Stanford over Arizona,
4-3.
With his hit, Skeels became the
latest clutch player in the ever
growing list of Cardinal close
calls.
"The good thing about this
team is that it seems to be a differ
ent guy each week (making the big
play)," Stanford coach Mark Mar
quess said. "We are a really bal
anced team and that pleases me."
Skeels was given the oppurtu
nity to play hero after Wildcat
releiver Todd Ingram made the
quintessential pitching faux pas
by balking with men on first and
second with no outs and the score
tied.
Ryan Turner had led off the
inning with a double, and, after
being replaced by pinch runner
David Cornell, was followed on
base by the intentionally walked
David Holbrook. The balk
advanced the runners to second
and third, and Troy Tallman was
also intentially walked in hopes
that Skeels would hit into a dou
ble play.
As Skeels stood in the on-deck
circle, Marquess took the opportu
nity to run out and have a little

Baseball

chat with his number eight hitter.
"I thought that he was going to
tell me that we were going to
squeeze (bunt)," Skeels said.
"[But] he just came out and reas
sured me that I did not have to
take any pitches; that I could
swing away."
Skeels wasted little time fol
lowing his coach's orders. The
book on the switch hitter says
that he likes to take the first fast
ball he gets his eye on, and Ingram
let him see it right away. Skeels
lined the right-hander's first pitch
for the game-winning single, and
the shivering crowd was finally
able to head for their cars.
"I was looking to get a good
pitch to hit that was around the
plate, and he gave it to me,"
Skeels said. "I just tried to hit it
hard."
Any problems with the nerves?
"I was pretty relaxed," Skeels
said. "With no outs the pressure
wasn't on me; it would have been
pretty hard for me to hit into a
triple play."
The Cardinal, ranked No. 1 in
country by Baseball America and
No. 2 in the Collegiate
Baseball/ESPN poll, improved its
record to 17-3 while maintaining a
firm grasp on first place in the
Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division by staying undefeated at
4-0. Arizona dropped to 1-3 in Six-
Pac play, 12-12 overall.
Stanford was leading the game
3-1 in the seventh when Cardinal
starter John Reid allowed men on
second and third with only one
out. Marquess went to his bullpen
and stopper Aaron Dorlarque
quickly defused the situation, only
to create his own problems in the
next inning.
Dorlarque ran into a pack of
Wildcat pinch hitters in the eighth

and Arizona was able to tie the
game, ending the right-hander's
string of 28% innings of scoreless
ball. Wildcat coach Jerry Kindall
used three pinch hitters in the
inning and all three got hits.
After pinch hitter Steve Lock
ett's double up the left field alley
scored leadoff (pinch) hitter R.D.
