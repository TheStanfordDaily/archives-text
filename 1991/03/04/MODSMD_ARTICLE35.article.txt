# Stanford woes continue
## Cardinal drops its sixth straight match 
### Kevin Jeffery Senior staff writer 
Somehow, when you lose a
match like the Cardinal men's vol
leyball team did Saturday, the
misfortunes you've suffered over
the past two weeks don't seem all
that important.
Stanford extended its streak of
futility to six matches by falling to
the UCLA Bruins, but thoughts of
the streak were lost in the emo
tionally wrenching, nationally
televised defeat.
ESPN (which will broadcast
the contest Wednesday on tape
delay) and the capacity Burnham
Pavilion crowd couldn't have
asked for a more dramatic match,
as the Bruins staved off a furious
Cardinal comeback attempt to win
in five games, 15-9, 15-12, 11-15,
11-15, 15-12.
Stanford fell to 4-6 in Western
Intercollegiate Volleyball Associa
tion play, and 5-7 overall. After
holding sole possession of the top
spot in the Wilson division just
three weeks earlier, the team now
stands two full games behind
third place San Diego State.
UCLA upped its record to 6-1
in WIVA, and 6-4 overall, and in
the process extended its DeGroot
division lead over Cal-State
Northridge (5-2).
The Cardinal started out the
match, as coach Ruben Nieves put
it, "like a team who had lost its
last five matches." The Bruins'
substantial height advantage took

its toll early, as their blocking, led
by 6-foot-10 middle blocker Tim
Kelly, successfully stifled Stan
ford's offense.
The Cardinal outside hitters
were, on more than one occasion,
forced to hit around or hit high,
arching balls over the formidable
Bruin frontcourt.
At the same time, Stanford's
blocking was not a factor. UCLA's
outside hitters Dan Landry and
David Swatik were hitting
through or straight over the Car
dinal blockers. In the middle Kelly
was practically unstoppable in the
first two games, and, even after
quieting in the last three, ended
up with a team-high 21 kills for an
impressive .567 hitting percent
age.
Stanford, however, was a dif
ferent club after the intermission.
Beginning in the third game they
were able to avoid Bruin blocking
with a better mix on offense. They
also found success with a defen
sive scheme shifted to concentrate
more on blocking Kelly in the mid
dle and digging UCLA's outside
hitters. But Nieves said the
game's turnaround was not really
a result of tactical changes.
"The biggest difference (after
the second game) wasn't in what

we did, but how we performed. We
played them tough in the second
game. And once realized that we
could play with them, we had a
chance to win the match," said
Nieves.
The Cardinal did play with the
Bruins early in the third game,
and then used a six-point run to
open up an insurmountable 14-8
lead. Again in the fourth game the
visibly fired-up Cardinal broke an
8-8 tie to win the match, and
stirred memories of last year's
ESPN match, another five-set
Burnham Pavilion thriller against
USC.
Unfortunately the fifth-game
jinx struck the Cardinal for the
third time in the 1991 season. The
hurt Saturday, however, was prob
ably worse than in losses to Pep
perdine and Long Beach State
because the Cardinal grabbed the
momentum and a 12-11 lead late
in the game, only to have the
match snatched from their grasp
by a timely Bruin four-point run.
In the process UCLA put an
end to Stanford's invincibility at
Burnham. Since the pavilion's
opening in 1990, the Cardinal
had, until Saturday, won all nine
of its matches there.
Dave Goss led Stanford with a
match-high 32 kills and hit for a
.310 percentage. He also tied
John Bezmalinovic with a team
high three solo blocks. Bob Hill
man added 22 kills and 12 digs,
while Mike Lowe had 21 kills for a
.531 percentage.
