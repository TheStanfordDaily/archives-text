# Track teams win
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Staff writer 
Last year's budget cuts were
expected to devastate the track
team — instead it has gotten
better. Gone is the star athlete
approach. Stanford's new goal,
accelerated by the cuts, is to
build stronger dual-meet
teams.
The results speak for them
selves. Both the men's and
women's teams won Satur
day's quadrangle with USC,
UC-Irvine and Cal State-
Northridge.
For the men it was the first
time in 67 years they beat USC.
As coach Brooks Johnson pre
dicted, the Cardinal used their
distance superiority to break
the Trojans and second place
Northridge.
Mark Mastalir, Dave Strang
and Alex Accetta swept the
1,500 meters. Strang took first
in the 800 and David Scud
amore won a close 3,000
meters by .19 seconds.
Jamie Marek won the pole
vault with a personal record of
16 feet, 7% inches. It was the
second time Marek has set a
personal record this season.
Also doing well in the field
was long jumper Marcus Hick
erson. His distance was not
impressive but the way he won
was. Hickerson grabbed the
lead early and passed on some
jumps in order to run the 400.
While he was setting a personal

best and placing second in the
race, an Irvine jumper leaped
the best distance of the day.
"After the 400 I ran back,
put my jumping stuff back on,
and jumped," Hickerson said.
On his final jump he hit the pit
with a %-inch victory margin.
Like Hickerson, James
Cramton did well in the short
distances. He won the 400 in
47.3 seconds. The race may
have been a letdown because
USC held out two of its best
sprinters, Travis Hannah and
Quincy Watts, for the sprint
relays.
After taking the 400 Cram
ton won the 200. "The 200 was
more difficult for me. I wasn't
particularly ready for the
meet," Cramton said.
On the women's side, Stan
ford crushed the competition,
scoring 67 points. USC was sec
ond with 49. Ashley Black was
a one woman scoring machine
with a victory in the 800 and
second place finishes in the
1,500 and 3,000.
Chryste Gaines dominated
the sprints, winning the 100
and 200 meters. Rhonda Oliver
was runner-up in the 400.
Grabbing top honors in the
field was Debbie Malueg. As
she has been doing all season,
Malueg won the discus and the
shot put. Peggy Odita was sec
ond in the high jump while
Jackie Edwards and Alysia
Hubbard finished 2-3 in the
long jump.
