# Golfers take second place
## 
### George Malone Staff writer 
The Stanford women's golf
team proved this weekend that it
is no fair-weather team.
The squad played on the Fort
Ord-Bayonet course in the San
Jose State Jostens Invitational
tournament in wind and rain
which delayed play for an hour on
Friday and canceled the round
yesterday. And they took second
place.
"It's the toughest course we
play all year, [and] it was raining
like gangbusters," coach Tim
Baldwin said.
"It was gross," junior Audrey
Wooding added.
The women pulled together
and played well, though, beating
several top-20 teams, including
No. 3 UCLA and No. 5 Furman.
The only team to beat the Cardi
nal was top-ranked San Jose
State, which scored a two-round
626, followed by Stanford's 640,
UCLA's 642 and Tulsa's 645.
"In very difficult conditions, we
got consistent play. This was
gutsy, gutsy, tough stuff," Baldwin
said.
"We achieved our main goals.
We wanted to beat UCLA, Tulsa
and Arizona State, but we would
have liked to play the third round
and try to catch San Jose State,"
Wooding said.
Stanford was led individually
by Jodi Figley's and Adele Moore's
159s (for 36 holes), which placed
them at seventh overall. Next
came Audrey Wooding's and
Stephanie Davis' 1625, which
were good enough for 14th. The
team also got solid play from
freshman Melanie Daniels.
"If you took those scores any
other day, I'd be upset," Figley
said.
However, everyone was defi
nitely pleased with the improve
ment from the last tournament.
"We felt that we really had a lot
to prove as a team based on our
poor performance at Arizona,"
Baldwin said.
The team's practice and work
paid off after Arizona paid off,
though. "Everybody realized we
needed to work harder, and it
shows," Figley said.
