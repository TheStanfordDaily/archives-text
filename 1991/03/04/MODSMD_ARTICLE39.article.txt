# New Navy team head appointed
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
The Navy has named a replace
ment for John Ford, the head of a
special negotiating team charged
with resolving Stanford's indirect
cost controversy.
Michael Kuc, a senior Navy
contracting officer, will take over
the leadership of the five-member
team following Ford's unexpected
retirement from the Navy last
week.
The special negotiating team
was first sent to Stanford in
December to address concerns
raised by Paul Biddle, the Navy
representative assigned to the
University since October 1988.
Biddle has alleged that Stanford
benefited by up to $200 million
from a "cozy" relationship with
the Office of Naval Research dur
ing the last decade.
A report released last month by
the Inspector General of the
Office of Naval Research found no
factual basis for Biddle's allega
tions. But it did find the possibil
ity of overpayment due to lax
oversight by Navy officials.
Kuc was a member of the
Inspector General's team that
prepared that report.
That is cause for concern,
according to a congressional
investigator, who spoke on condi
tion of anonymity.
The release date of the Inspec
tor General's report was delayed
several times, she said, which is
reason enough to fear Kuc may
not resolve matters between Stan
ford and the Navy in a timely
manner.
"It could be a repeat perfor
mance," she said.
If Kuc, in his new role, does not
proceed any more efficiently than
the Inspector General team, the
Navy "is in for a lot of trouble,"
she said.
Norm Hanson, a Navy spokes
person, said the change in leader
ship on the Navy team should not
alter the June target for comple
tion of the team's work.
