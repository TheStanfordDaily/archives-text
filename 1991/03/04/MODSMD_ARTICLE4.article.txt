# Kennedy proposes changes in appointments, promotions

### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
When appointing and pro
moting faculty members, Stan
ford should limit the number of
published works that are eval
uated, University President
Donald Kennedy says in an
essay to the community
The proposal, released yes
terday, is one of several made
by Kennedy designed to put a
greater emphasis on teaching
at Stanford. Decreasing pres
sure on faculty to publish large
quantities of research work
will allow them to devote more
time to "activities . . . that ben
efit the education of our under
graduates," Kennedy says.
In the essay, Kennedy also
proposes:
• That teaching accomplish
ments be given greater weight
in decisions to appoint and pro
mote faculty members,
• That some "less usual
forms of scholarship," such as
writing textbooks and design

ing educational computer soft
ware, be considered in schol
arly evaluations, and
• That professors review
their colleagues' teaching skills
on a regular basis.
"The challenge before us, as
I have come to see it," Kennedy
says, "is to make some signifi
cant improvements in the qual
ity of undergraduate education
at Stanford without undermin
ing the excellence that our
attention to scholarly work has
brought us."
In an interview over the
weekend, Kennedy said he was
very disturbed about a trend in
higher education to value the
quantity of scholars' published
works more than the quality of
the individual works.
In a recent survey of thou
sands of scholars nationwide
by the Carnegie Foundation,
more than half of those ques
tioned said the pressure to pub
lish reduced the quality of
teaching. And nearly half of those
surveyed perceived that their pub
lications were just counted, not
qualitatively measured.
"I think there is much more
pressure now in the direction of
more as opposed to better
research," Kennedy said, "and I
think it is particularly true in the
sciences.
"People publish too quickly;
they get their stuff out in bites
that are too small; they publish
the same idea in too many places,
and I believe one way to counter
act that tendency is to say plainly
what we're interested in is quality
not quantity."
Under University rules,
Kennedy's proposal must be sub
mitted to the Advisory Board,
which is made up of seven profes
sors. The board will solicit faculty
opinion on the proposed changes
and report back to Kennedy.
Specific rules limiting the num
ber of scholarly works would have
to be developed discipline by disci
pline, Kennedy said. A candidate
for promotion from associate to

full professor in a scientific field
might be asked to submit his or
her best five published articles, he
said.
"If she wants to, she can sub
mit the whole bibliography of 150
items, but the judgment is going
to be based on the five that she
thinks are the best."
His proposals related to the
evaluation of teaching will have to
go through other channels. A sub
committee of the faculty commit
tee on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement will examine the
proposals and related issues over
the next several quarters,
Kennedy said.
In his essay, Kennedy empha
sizes the need for peer review of
teaching effectiveness, an activity
that does not take place on a regu
lar basis at Stanford. "So accus
tomed have we become to the
principle of peer evaluation in
scholarly life that its absence casts
an implication of disregard for the
unreviewed activity," he says.
Some faculty have expressed
reservations about having their
colleagues sit in on their lectures
or seminars, Kennedy said in the
interview. But "I think we can get
around that problem," he said.
Perhaps the greatest benefit

from increased evaluation of
teaching will be more discussion
among the faculty about what
good teaching is, Kennedy said.
"Serious consideration given to
changes in the appointments and
promotions process may be the
most effective cultural change
agent of all," he said.
