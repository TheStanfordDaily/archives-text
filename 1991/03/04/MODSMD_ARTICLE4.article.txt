When appointing and pro
moting faculty members, Stan
ford should limit the number of
published works that are eval

Donald Kennedy says in an
essay to the community
The proposal, released yes

by Kennedy designed to put a
greater emphasis on teaching
at Stanford. Decreasing pres

quantities of research work
will allow them to devote more
time to "activities . . . that ben
efit the education of our under
graduates," Kennedy says.
In the essay, Kennedy also
proposes:
• That teaching accomplish

in decisions to appoint and pro
mote faculty members,
• That some "less usual
forms of scholarship," such as
writing textbooks and design

ing educational computer soft
ware, be considered in schol
arly evaluations, and
• That professors review
their colleagues' teaching skills
on a regular basis.
"The challenge before us, as
I have come to see it," Kennedy
says, "is to make some signifi
cant improvements in the qual
ity of undergraduate education
at Stanford without undermin
ing the excellence that our
attention to scholarly work has
brought us."

weekend, Kennedy said he was
very disturbed about a trend in
higher education to value the
quantity of scholars' published
works more than the quality of
the individual works.
In a recent survey of thou

more than half of those ques
