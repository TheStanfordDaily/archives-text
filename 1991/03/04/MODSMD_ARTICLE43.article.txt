# Stanford Gospel Choir promotes harmony in music, life
## 
### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Staff writer 
On this past Friday night, like others, music lover
David Doggette fine-tuned his instruments.
"I want to redo this note," he said in his rich bari
tone voice, his finger pressing the key of a piano in
Ujamaa's main lounge.
But Doggette's primary instruments are not per
cussion, brass or woodwind — they are human. And
when Doggette, director of the ASSU-funded Stan
ford Gospel Choir, lifted his hands, about 20 finely
tuned voices resounded in heavenly chorus.
"The choir is really a good way to end the week
because there is so much energy generated when we
sing," said senior Sarah Willburn. "It is really, really
fun."
At Friday practice sessions the choir discusses
issues that are on the minds of members before split
ting into voice groups — sopranos, altos and tenors
— to form a three-part harmony.
The diversity of vocal ranges in the choir is
matched by the diversity of races in the choir. About
one third of the members are non-black. Floyd
Thompkins, associate dean of Memorial Church,
said the multicultural composition of the choir
reflects the "seductive nature of music that is uplift
ing, positive and deals with Jesus."
"This is something that people want to be a part

of. The medium and the message blend together to
make more than song — it builds community,"
Thompkins added.
Andrew Hseih, a senior who is Asian-American,
said he joined the choir during his freshman year
when he was a resident of Ujamaa. "I like to sing,
but more importantly the choir is a great source of
fellowship and ministry."
The first strains of modern gospel music stretch
back to the plantation songs from the 1800s. The
spiritual shouting of 19th century Pentecostal
churches wedded with the circle dances of African
traditions and the influences of the blues forged the
gospel hymns heard today.
"Gospel music is celebratory and communica
tory," Thompkins added. The motto of the Stanford
choir, "Spreading gospel through music," reflects
this.
"In gospel music the words carry spirit and feel
ings and emotions. Without good words you don't
have a good song," Doggette said. The music for one
gospel song he recently wrote was finished in July,
but he did not complete the words until November,
he said.
Doggette, a Seventh-day Adventist, said choir
members should learn the significance of the words
they sing. "People can learn words and sing words
and still be unconscious of the deeper meaning," he
said.
