### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Staff writer 
A Stanford student was injured Sat
urday evening when her bicycle collided
with a pick-up truck at the intersection
of Santa Teresa Street and Lomita
Drive, near Terman Engineering Build
ing.
Chai-Lin Hsu, a senior, suffered a
broken right leg in the accident, which
occurred shortly after 7 p.m. Stanford
Police Sgt. Hilary Karp said Hsu was
riding on Santa Theresa when she was
struck by a black Chevrolet truck driven
by Raul Rivas, a graduate student.
Hsu was transported to Stanford
Hospital, where she underwent surgery

on her broken femur Sunday. A hospital
nurse said Hsu was in good condition
after the surgery, although she will
remain in the hospital until the end of
the week.
An accident report will be filed today,
but as of late last night, the accident was
still under investigation and no charges
had been filed.
Karp said slick road conditions and
poor visibility due to darkness and rain
may have contributed to the accident.
Hsu did not have a bicycle light,
which may have reduced her visibility to
motorists even though a street light is
positioned near the intersection, Karp
said.
Rivas was not injured in the collision

but appeared shaken after the accident.
After the incident, he said a police
officer told him bikers frequently ignore
the stop sign at the intersection.
Whether Hsu failed to stop is also under
investigation, police said.
Rivas said that as he was turning left
onto Santa Theresa, the right front
corner of his truck struck Hsu, throw
ing her from her bicycle. "Before my
lights had shined on her I had hit her,"
he said.
A friend of Hsu later said Hsu was
not wearing a bicycle helmet.
Karp is asking any eyewitnesses of
the accident to call the Stanford police
at 723-9633.
