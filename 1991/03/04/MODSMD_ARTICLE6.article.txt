# New dorm project on target for fall
## 
### J.T.S. Moore Staff writer 
The University announced fur
ther details Friday about Kimball
Hall, the new dormitory slated to
open this fall, including the fact
that it will be a four-class resi
dence.
In addition, administrators
announced the resident fellows
for Kimball â€” John and Angela
Rickford, currently resident fel
lows in Arroyo. John Rickford is a
linguistics professor and his
Angela is the residence dean of
Toyon Hall.
One of the major factors in the
decision to make it a four-class
residence instead of an upper
class-only house was that "People
feel that freshmen enliven a
house," said Housing Center
Director Rodger Whitney.
Another factor is that the sec
ond of the three buildings planned
to be constructed on the site of
Manzanita Park will probably be
an upperclass-only house.
Because the new dormitory will
open more spaces for freshmen,
Trancos, currently an all-fresh
man house, will become a four
class residence, said Robin Hens
ley, who is in charge of new resi
dence planning in the Office of
Residential Affairs.
The decision was made by a
committee from the Res Ed and
approved Friday by Diana Con-

Klin, acting associate dean of stu
dent affairs.
Hensley said there will be
about 110 square feet of living
space in Kimball per resident. The
rooms "will be comparable to
those found in Governor's Cor
ner," she explained.
All of the halls will be coed and
will have single sex bathrooms.
There will be a total of 199 spaces
for students, with 39 singles, 49
two-room doubles, 23 one-room
doubles and four three-room
quads.
Six resident assistants will be
assigned to the dorm. There were
plans for eight originally, but two
positions had to be eliminated
because of budget constraints,
Hensley said.
Kimball will be the first new
undergraduate residence since the
Suites opened in the winter of
1984. Whitney said he expects stu
dent response to Kimball in this
spring's Draw to be similar to that
created by the opening of the
houses in Governor's Corner from
1982 to 1984.
"Governor's Comer went very
high (in student rankings for the
Draw)" Whitney recalled. "It was
new and students wanted to
explore it."
The final budgeted cost for
Kimball is $10.75 million, Hens
lev said.
