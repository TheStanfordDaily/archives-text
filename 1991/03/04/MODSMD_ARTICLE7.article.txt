# Freshmen lesbians face coming out with fear, relief
## 
### Robin Mathison Staff writer 
Rachel Maddow and Saydeah
Howard find the dating scene at
Stanford particularly difficult. As
two of the only openly lesbian
freshmen on campus, they anx
iously wait for others to come out.
When Maddow came out as a
lesbian this winter, she feared
that people would run away from
her in the lunch line. But she said
she was surprised at the over
whelmingly positive support she
received. "It was empowering.
There was a posse of people
behind me."
Maddow added that because of
the special efforts people made
toward accepting her, she now
feels "totally closer to everyone"
in her residence, Paloma.
After debating the issue at
length with her roommate, Mad

dow decided to go public by post
ing a letter in Paloma, an all
freshmen dormitory. She agonized
over her decision while in bed with
the flu, and then "during one of
my palpitations I just got up and
wrote the letter," she said.
Before posting her letter in the
bathroom stalls, Maddow dis
cussed her homosexuality with
several close friends. It would be
"heinous for them go read it in the
bathroom like everyone else," she
explained.
Students admired Maddow's
courage. "Why didn't you tell us
before?" was the only negative
reaction she received, she said.
Maddow said she came out of
the closet in response to several
homophobic comments that she
had heard in her dorm "I wanted
to be there, not to stifle those

comments, but to address them," she
added. "I wanted to attach my face to
those comments and see if they still
wanted to say them."
She said she was surprised that no
one had questioned her sexuality prior
to her coming out as a lesbian. "I
dropped all these hints. I was waiting
for somebody to ask me."
Unlike Maddow, Howard said she
has been out at Stanford "since day
one." By wallpapering her room with
pictures of women and slipping hints
into dorm discussions, Howard tried to
reveal her sexual orientation from the
beginning.
Being a lesbian is just "another part
of me," Howard said. "I wanted the
people I was living with to know."
Although most of her fellow Larkin
residents were accepting, some were
shocked that there was "actually a gay
person in their dorm," she said.
Howard speculates there are many
other gay students in her dorm.
"When you live with someone and
[their homosexuality] is part of their
personality, it's easy to tell," she said.
Like Paloma, Larkin is an all-fresh
men house.
Howard said the most frequent
stereotype she encountered was the
man-hater image. This is inaccurate,
she added, since "you don't hate cate
gories, you hate specific people."
Another stereotype Howard said
she has faced is the misperception that
she is constantly chasing after female
residents.

A minor problem arose in the dorm
when a female friend mistakenly
thought that Howard was interested in
her, but this was quickly resolved, she
said.
Several men in her dorm initially
expressed feelings of competition,
which Howard dismissed as ridiculous.
"It's simple," she explained to them,
"you take the straight women and I'll
take the gay women."
Howard said she set aside time to
talk with her roommate, who has been
very tolerant. Her roommate's biggest
fear is that guys will think that she,
too, is gay, Howard added.
She said she has been out of the
closet since high school, where "every
body knew but nobody talked about
it."
Howard added that she made the
decision to come out since maintaining
a heterosexual appearance was too
frustrating. It was a hassle to avoid
admiring good-looking girls and to
remember to refer to boyfriends
instead of girlfriends, she said.
"I spent my entire junior year of
high school saying 'I am; I'm not.' I
thought it was something I had to
decide," Howard said. "I had a lot of
illusions about what being gay meant."
Coming out was both relieving and
scary, Howard said, and it has made
her much more comfortable with her
self. "I'm in the same state I've always
been. I'm just more aware," she said.
"It's not something I'm dealing
with, it's just another part of life," she
said.
Coming out has also been a positive
experience for Maddow, who said she
feels more comfortable and happy with
herself now. She said she has moved

from vulnerable to confident, and that
everything in her life is now more
coherent.
In the past, Maddow's homosexual
ity had been a barrier to close friend
ships, she said. To prevent people from
realizing she was gay, Maddow shut
herself off from other people.
Coming out has solidified Maddow's
friendships, with both men and
women. "I'm a lot closer to all my
friends," she said. "I don't feel like I've
lost any friends."
Being friends with men is easier
than ever, since "it's a total bonding
experience," Maddow said. "There's no
tension, no pressure. It's wonderful."
The only people whom Maddow has
not informed are her parents. Seeing
no urgent need to tell them, she said
she has decided to wait on it.
Maddow said she first realized she
was a lesbian at the end of high school.
Discovering her sexuality was a pro
cess, not a "wham-bam thing" or a
"divine revelation," she added.
Although Maddow dated a number
of men and had several great relation
ships, she continuously doubted her
sexuality, she said.
"I wasn't living a lie," she said, "It
just didn't really click with me."
Maddow said she initially panicked
about being gay, assuming that it
would ruin her whole life — "I couldn't
have a husband, three kids, and a
house in the suburbs."
Then she said she realized that in
any case she did not want this lifestyle.
At this point, Maddow had intellectu
ally and philosophically decided that
she was a lesbian.
Maddow describes being out as a
very political, "anti-assimilationist"

statement. "I don't want to be per
ceived as something I'm not," she said
about the common assumption that
she is heterosexual. "So I have to go
out of my way and make a statement."
While Maddow agreed the Stanford
community has a positive attitude
toward homosexuality, she said she
fears the censoring effect of politically
correct attitudes on campus.
"A 'PC' agenda is dangerous.
Nobody's allowed to say homophobic
comments so it goes unchecked. . . .
There are no resources to deal with
your feelings," she said.
Maddow said she would prefer if
people who are against homosexuality
felt comfortable enough to express
their hostile feelings, so that she could
address the issue.
She added that she has observed a
real conservatism in the gay commu
nity at Stanford. "I'm disillusioned
there's only two people out in the
freshman class," she said.
Howard also lamented the dearth of
undergraduate lesbians and said most
women who are out at Stanford are
seniors or graduate students.
She said she would like to hold a
brunch for gay and lesbian freshmen
to get to know more gay undergradu
ates. "It would be nice if everybody
knew everybody else's face," Howard
said.
Howard only applied to colleges that
have an active gay community and an
accepting campus attitude, such as
UC-Berkeley and UCLA. She said she
enjoys spending time with other gays
and lesbians because they don't look at
her differently. Sometimes heterosexu
als recognize her only as a lesbian, she
said, and not as a complete being.

iously wait for others to come out.
When Maddow came out as a
lesbian this winter, she feared
that people would run away from
her in the lunch line. But she said
she was surprised at the over
whelmingly positive support she
received. "It was empowering.
There was a posse of people
behind me."
Maddow added that because of
the special efforts people made
toward accepting her, she now
feels "totally closer to everyone"
in her residence, Paloma.
After debating the issue at
length with her roommate, Mad

dow decided to go public by post
ing a letter in Paloma, an all
freshmen dormitory. She agonized
over her decision while in bed with
the flu, and then "during one of
my palpitations I just got up and
wrote the letter," she said.
Before posting her letter in the
bathroom stalls, Maddow dis
cussed her homosexuality with
several close friends. It would be
"heinous for them go read it in the
bathroom like everyone else," she
explained.
Students admired Maddow's
courage. "Why didn't you tell us
before?" was the only negative
reaction she received, she said.
Maddow said she came out of
the closet in response to several
homophobic comments that she
had heard in her dorm "I wanted
to be there, not to stifle those

unusual challenge.
comments, but to address them," she
added. "I wanted to attach my face to
those comments and see if they still
wanted to say them."
She said she was surprised that no
one had questioned her sexuality prior
to her coming out as a lesbian. "I
dropped all these hints. I was waiting
for somebody to ask me."
Unlike Maddow, Howard said she
has been out at Stanford "since day
one." By wallpapering her room with
pictures of women and slipping hints
into dorm discussions, Howard tried to
reveal her sexual orientation from the
beginning.
Being a lesbian is just "another part
of me," Howard said. "I wanted the
people I was living with to know."
Although most of her fellow Larkin
residents were accepting, some were
shocked that there was "actually a gay
person in their dorm," she said.
Howard speculates there are many
other gay students in her dorm.
"When you live with someone and
[their homosexuality] is part of their
personality, it's easy to tell," she said.
Like Paloma, Larkin is an all-fresh
men house.
Howard said the most frequent
stereotype she encountered was the
man-hater image. This is inaccurate,
she added, since "you don't hate cate
gories, you hate specific people."
Another stereotype Howard said
she has faced is the misperception that
she is constantly chasing after female
residents.

A minor problem arose in the dorm
when a female friend mistakenly
thought that Howard was interested in
her, but this was quickly resolved, she
said.
Several men in her dorm initially
expressed feelings of competition,
which Howard dismissed as ridiculous.
"It's simple," she explained to them,
"you take the straight women and I'll
take the gay women."
Howard said she set aside time to
talk with her roommate, who has been
very tolerant. Her roommate's biggest
fear is that guys will think that she,
too, is gay, Howard added.
She said she has been out of the
closet since high school, where "every
body knew but nobody talked about
it."
Howard added that she made the
decision to come out since maintaining
a heterosexual appearance was too
frustrating. It was a hassle to avoid
admiring good-looking girls and to
remember to refer to boyfriends
instead of girlfriends, she said.
"I spent my entire junior year of
high school saying 'I am; I'm not.' I
thought it was something I had to
decide," Howard said. "I had a lot of
illusions about what being gay meant."
Coming out was both relieving and
scary, Howard said, and it has made
her much more comfortable with her
self. "I'm in the same state I've always
been. I'm just more aware," she said.
"It's not something I'm dealing
with, it's just another part of life," she
said.
Coming out has also been a positive
experience for Maddow, who said she
feels more comfortable and happy with
herself now. She said she has moved

from vulnerable to confident, and that
everything in her life is now more
coherent.
In the past, Maddow's homosexual
ity had been a barrier to close friend
ships, she said. To prevent people from
realizing she was gay, Maddow shut
herself off from other people.
Coming out has solidified Maddow's
friendships, with both men and
women. "I'm a lot closer to all my
friends," she said. "I don't feel like I've
lost any friends."
Being friends with men is easier
than ever, since "it's a total bonding
experience," Maddow said. "There's no
tension, no pressure. It's wonderful."
The only people whom Maddow has
not informed are her parents. Seeing
no urgent need to tell them, she said
she has decided to wait on it.
Maddow said she first realized she
was a lesbian at the end of high school.
Discovering her sexuality was a pro
cess, not a "wham-bam thing" or a
"divine revelation," she added.
Although Maddow dated a number
of men and had several great relation
ships, she continuously doubted her
sexuality, she said.
"I wasn't living a lie," she said, "It
just didn't really click with me."
Maddow said she initially panicked
about being gay, assuming that it
would ruin her whole life — "I couldn't
have a husband, three kids, and a
house in the suburbs."
Then she said she realized that in
any case she did not want this lifestyle.
At this point, Maddow had intellectu
ally and philosophically decided that
she was a lesbian.
Maddow describes being out as a
very political, "anti-assimilationist"

statement. "I don't want to be per
ceived as something I'm not," she said
about the common assumption that
she is heterosexual. "So I have to go
out of my way and make a statement."
While Maddow agreed the Stanford
community has a positive attitude
toward homosexuality, she said she
fears the censoring effect of politically
correct attitudes on campus.
"A 'PC' agenda is dangerous.
Nobody's allowed to say homophobic
comments so it goes unchecked. . . .
There are no resources to deal with
your feelings," she said.
Maddow said she would prefer if
people who are against homosexuality
felt comfortable enough to express
their hostile feelings, so that she could
address the issue.
She added that she has observed a
real conservatism in the gay commu
nity at Stanford. "I'm disillusioned
there's only two people out in the
freshman class," she said.
Howard also lamented the dearth of
undergraduate lesbians and said most
women who are out at Stanford are
seniors or graduate students.
She said she would like to hold a
brunch for gay and lesbian freshmen
to get to know more gay undergradu
ates. "It would be nice if everybody
knew everybody else's face," Howard
said.
Howard only applied to colleges that
have an active gay community and an
accepting campus attitude, such as
UC-Berkeley and UCLA. She said she
enjoys spending time with other gays
and lesbians because they don't look at
her differently. Sometimes heterosexu
als recognize her only as a lesbian, she
said, and not as a complete being.
