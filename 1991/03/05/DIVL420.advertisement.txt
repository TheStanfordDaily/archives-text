The VOCOLOT-a bilingual play on the Hebrew word "kolot" meaning voices, and the English word
"vocal" - is an all-women's group composed of a core of four. Drawing from folk, classical, and
Jewish musical idioms, the songs of the VOCOLOT reflect a concern for peace, justice, and
compassion, as expressed in original poetic lyrics and in the retelling of biblical and liturgical
themes.
'...eminently well-crafted [songs] full of the expression of a warm and joyous spirit..."
