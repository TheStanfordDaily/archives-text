# Rainfall doesn't relieve drought
## 
### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Staff writer 
The past six days of rainfall in
the Bay Area, including yester
day's torrential rains, are not
expected to drastically reduce the
effects of five years of drought or
end University water rationing.
Monday's storm brought .8
inches of rain to the Stanford
area, bringing the cumulative
rainfall to just over three inches
since rain began Feb. 27.
But the heavy, intermittent
rains will only slightly impact the
water levels of area reservoirs,
water experts said.
The San Francisco Water
Department supplies Stanford's
water from the Hetch Hetchy
reservoir near Yosemite National
Park. But Greg Tom, deputy man
ager for the San Francisco Water
Department, said water levels in
the reservoir are at 8 percent of
capacity. The normal water level
of Hetch Hetchy is 20 percent.
An additional foot of water
would only bring the level of the
Hetch Hetchy to 10 percent of
capacity, Tom added.
"It would take nearly 21 days
at one inch of rain per day to give
us near-normal levels," he said.
"As it stands we don't plan to stop
or decrease rationing levels to our
customers because the rain we
have had in the past few days is
just not enough."
In compliance with a San Fran
cisco Water Department rationing
plan revised last week, all cus
tomers, including Stanford, must
cut consumption by 45 percent of
the amount used in 1987 â€” the
last normal year of rainfall.
"The rationing of water will
remain in effect," said David
Kaye, Stanford utility manager.
"But the recent rains will keep the

campus green while we are not
irrigating," he said.
In compliance with rationing
provisions, which began last year,
Stanford has curtailed outside
watering by 90 percent, irrigated
plants with non-potable water,
and forbade students and faculty
from washing cars on campus.
Although recent rains have not
been enough to compensate for
the effects of the drought, Tom

said he remained hopeful that
another approaching storm will
bring more water to underfilled
reservoirs.
The National Weather Service
predicted last night that scattered
showers would continue today
with a chance of thunderstorms.
He predicted partly cloudy skies
tomorrow and partial clearing on
Thursday.
