# Not quite a postcard view
## Conference examines Switzerland's dilemmas 
### Viviane Lowe 
Switzerland was created on a mountain meadow
in 1291 when three cowherds swore a solemn oath to
excellence in the production of cheese and chocolate
and the pursuit of watchmaking â€” right?
Not quite. The conference on Switzerland that
took place at Stanford last weekend questioned this
and other postcard views of the country. Instead,
speakers presented an image of a nation struggling
with cultural and linguistic diversity and problems of
national identity in a rapidly changing Europe.
The 700 th anniversary of Switzerland's founding
coincides with Stanford's 100 th, and the commemo
rative conference was an event in the yearlong Cen
tennial Celebration. Speakers discussed Swiss poli
tics, history, literature and science.
Prof. Walter Lohnes, chair of the German Studies
Department and organizer of the conference, said
the event was meant to increase awareness of Swiss
culture in the United States and to promote Swiss
studies in U.S. universities.
In the opening session, Swiss foreign minister
Klaus Jacobi said his country wants to play a more
active role in Europe and throughout the world. As
an example, he cited Switzerland's implementing
economic sanctions against Iraq, an unusual stance
for a traditionally neutral country that is not a mem

ber of the United Nations.
Former Secretary of State and Distinguished
Hoover Institution Fellow George Shultz noted the
importance of Switzerland as a meeting place for the
disarmament talks in 1984 and 1985, when he and
then-President Reagan met their Soviet counter
parts in Geneva.
Switzerland and the United States both "share a
common problem of how to govern over diversity,"
Shultz said.
Many speakers focused on the problem of linguis
tic and cultural diversity. Switzerland has four offi
cial languages: German, French, Italian and Roman
sch. Authors writing in each of these languages gave
readings of their works and commented on the influ
ence of diversity in the creation of a common Swiss
identity.
The conference also marked the establishment of
a chair for Swiss studies at Stanford endowed by the
Swiss government. Similar chairs in German and
Austrian studies are financed by foreign govern
ments. These chairs allow a scholar from the country
to teach for a year at Stanford in the department of
his or her specialty.
This style of nationally endowed chair is unique
within the United States, Lohnes said. "I hope we
can promote more exchange of ideas between univer
sities in different countries," Lohnes said.
