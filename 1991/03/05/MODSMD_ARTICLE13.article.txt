# Dorm groups explore women's needs

Sigmund Freud never under
stood what women wanted. Per
haps Stanford will have better
luck.
In order to determine the most
salient concerns of female stu
dents, the University is coordinat
ing a series of residence-based
"focus groups" to solicit opinions
on women's issues such as dis
crimination and sexual assault.
The series of sessions, which
began last month and will con
tinue through next quarter,
marks the second stage of the
Women's Needs Assessment. Ini
tiated last spring by the Office of
Student Affairs, the assessment is
designed to investigate the quality
of life for women on campus and
determine ways to improve it.
The first phase of the study
began in November, when 600

female students were randomly
selected to attend a meeting
where they shared their thoughts,
feelings and experiences.
Diana Akiyama, chair of the
Women's Needs Assessment
Group and assistant dean of
Memorial Church, said the goal of
the residence-based groups is to
obtain more extensive data on
"what women are thinking, what
their needs are, how these needs
can be met and what needs to hap
pen if these changes are to be
made." .
"We are trying to determine
how it is we can accurately assess
the quality of life at Stanford,"
said Akiyama. "Once we get
results from these focus groups,
we may find we have enough
information to draw conclusions,
or we may have to continue the
study. We won't know until after.
"We're trying to hear from as
many women as possible,"

Akiyama said, "and we're espe
cially trying to get people to come
who wouldn't normally think of
themselves as having an opinion
on women's issues."
Focus groups will be organized
by residential area. For example,
two discussions will be held in
Governor's Corner. Each session
will run for about an hour and a
half, during which participating
women will respond to a set of
fixed questions.
"Ideally, these focus groups will
include no more than 20 women,
in order to insure that all
women's voices are heard,"
Akiyama said.
Focus groups will be facilitated
by female University staff mem
bers, many of whom are members
of the assessment. Even though
some of the facilitators are cam
pus therapists, the groups are not
a form of psychological service,
Akiyama said.
