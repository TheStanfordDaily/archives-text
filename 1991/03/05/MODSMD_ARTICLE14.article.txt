European Community agrees to
restore food aid to Soviet Union
BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) — The 12-mem
ber European Community agreed in principle
yesterday to restore more than $1 billion in
food aid to the Soviet Union.
"There are no more political obstacles on the
way for the help," German Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher told reporters after a
meeting of the EC foreign ministers.
The ministers issued a statement expressing
satisfaction that Soviet authorities had not
interfered with referendums held Sunday in
Latvia and Estonia. Latvians and Estonians
voted overwhelmingly for independence in the
non-binding referendums; Lithuania did the
same thing last month.
Federal court asked to legalize
marijuana for medical use
WASHINGTON (AP) — Two private groups
urged a federal appeals court yesterday to legal
ize marijuana for medical purposes such as
controlling nausea in cancer patients and eye
pressure among glaucoma victims.
The move would allow thousands of patients
who are illegally using the drug to come within
the law, the groups are arguing.
A government lawyer told the court legaliza
tion is unnecessary because, under current law,
doctors can apply to prescribe the drug for
"compassionate" purposes.
But attorneys seeking legalization said the
licensing process for such prescriptions
imposes an unreasonable burden on doctors
seeking to dispense the drug.
Retirement home fire kills nine
COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) - A fire
raced through a retirement home and killed
nine people yesterday as neighbors and employ
ees helped rescue residents by pushing them to
safety in wheelchairs.
Eight residents died in the blaze, and
another died later at a hospital, said Colorado
Springs Police Lt. Ron Resling.
Seven people were hospitalized, including
one in critical condition, most suffering from
smoke inhalation. Eight others were treated,
including four firefighters.
Supreme Court declines to cap
soaring punitive-damage awards
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme
Court refused yesterday to limit skyrocketing
punitive damage awards, saying, judges
and legislatures must decide whether to rein in
the power of juries to punish and deter wrong
doers.
The 7-1 decision, surprisingly one-sided
given previous statements by the justices, is a
disappointment to broad segments of the
American business community, which had
urged a fundamental change to the nation's
legal landscape.
