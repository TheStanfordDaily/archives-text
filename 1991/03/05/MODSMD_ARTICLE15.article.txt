MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) â€” The
largest Sandinista labor union yester
day rejected the emergency austerity
measures of President Violeta
Chamorro, demanded 600 percent
raises and accused the government of
Scheming t<rfir*e 60,000"Civil servantsT
A pro-Sandinista newspaper termed
Chamorro as the "Mother of all Deval
uations" after the announcement Sun
day that the government would cease
printing cordobas. At 25 million cor
dobas to the dollar, the old currency is
worthless, the government said.
The old cordoba was known deri
sively in this economically ravaged
nation of 3 million residents as the

"piggie."
Minister of the Presidency Antonio
Lacayo announced a series of shock
measures Sunday to curb inflation,
which hit 13,000 percent last year.
Lacayo said the government was
devaluing the new gold Pordoba as well
as the old cordoba.
The gold cordoba had been on par
with the U.S. dollar; the rate is now
five to the dollar. The piggie went from
5.2 million to the dollar to 25 million.
The pro-Sandinista daily El Nuevo
Diario said the "brutal devaluation
executed by the government takes our
people to extreme levels of misery.
"If stomachs already felt hunger,

today that hunger extends like an
immense oil spill from which will
emerge corpses just like the ducks we
saw on television" during the Persian
Gulf war.
People emptied shops ancl markets
over the weekend as iiTVrTfiVs of Tfgw
economic measures spread, trying to
get rid of the piggies that have been
the common currency here.
Few people have even seen the gold
cordoba, which was introduced last
August and, until now, kept artificially
on par with the dollar.
Until Sunday's huge devaluation,
the government had been dropping the
value of the cordoba at about 6 percent

a week.
Lacayo said the old cordobas will
cease to be legal tender April 30 and
must be changed for gold cordobas
befpre. then at the new exchange rate,
Lacayo also announced price con-
TroTs on staples and fuel and a 200 per
cent across-the-board pay raise for the
nation's 110,000 public employees.
A union communique said the gov
ernment could face "instability and
chaos that could arise as a form of
resistance to the negative effects of
this economic shock."
Civil service salaries were low even
before the devaluation and lagged far
behind the prices of staples.
