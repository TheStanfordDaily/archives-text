## Time for 'Herstory' 
### 
Although women have
made up one-half of the pop
ulation of nearly every soci
ety throughout history, their con
tributions to culture are conspicu
ously rare in most textbooks and
classrooms. Furthermore, as half
of the population of our own soci
ety, women are conspicuously rare
in positions of leadership and
power.
It would be naive not to
acknowledge the connection be
tween these two tragic deficiencies.
Women's "Herstory" Month
addresses these deficiencies with a
series of lectures and programs
that run through the end of this
quarter. These events focus not
only on women's contributions to
history, but also on the traditional
bias toward recording and analyz
ing only the history that affects the
men in a society.

Even on our campus, where the
contributions of traditionally
under-represented groups are
emphasized, this gender-based his
torical bias is rarely dealt with.
Unfortunately, some of the
month's speakers do seem to have
a certain political slant to them.
The president of Planned Parent
hood, for example, will likely take a
political stand on reproductive and
abortion rights, an issue that
divides women as well as men.
But for the most part, the events
of Herstory Month will challenge
many of the myths that have been
generated by centuries of male
based history.
Women's Herstory Month will
be a step away from this kind of
institutional sexism. In order for
these programs to be effective, it is
important that students of both
genders attend and learn.
