UNIVERSITY OFFICIALS
recently announced that
next year they are moving
Synergy and the Delta Tau Delta
fraternity into Durand and 353
Campus Drive, respectively. These
announcements sparked immedi
ate protests from the residents of
the latter two houses, who claimed
that Synergy and the Delts were
being given unfair priority over
themselves. "
But the protesters' arguments
remain murky, at best.
None of the residents in Durand
or 353 Campus is being dislocated
this year, and as there is no longer
a returning resident priority policy,
none of them had any advantage in
drawing into the same houses
again next year.
Durand and 353 Campus are
hardly known for their strong tra
ditions and house spirit. What are
the current residents claiming will

be lost?
University officials, on the other
hand, have relatively strong argu
ments supporting their decision.
Fraternities and co-operatives pro
vide alternative housing options
for students.
' Honoring a commitment that it
made following the Earthquake of
1989, the University has been
responsive to the needs and prefer
ences of these houses: Durand's
internal design is more conducive
to co-op living, and members of the
Delts prefer the larger rooms and
remote location of 353 Campus.
In return, the University gets
back two houses with excellent
locations that will probably be
more popular than the houses that
are being displaced.
The University has made a wise
decision; it should ignore the
protests and proceed with the
move.
