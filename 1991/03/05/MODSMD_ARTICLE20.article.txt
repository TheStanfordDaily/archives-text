## Understanding hatred 
### 
JOY ABOUT KUWAIT'S liberation
has increasingly been tempered by
reports of violence against Palestini
ans. Many of them supported Saddam
Hussein, and some allegedly collaborated
with the Iraqis against the Kuwaiti resis
tance.
The Kuwaiti government has prepared
plans for the internment and punishment
of most Palestinians living in Kuwait
(many of whom, of course, are innocent),
but some impatient youths don't feel like
waiting for such "justice." As one of them
said on television, "Don't blame us if we
start killing Palestinians."
It is unlikely that only Palestinians
betrayed resistance fighters to the Iraqi
occupiers (nor, certainly, did every Pales
tinian do so), but they seem to be the only
ones punished.
Similarly, the only "punishment" for
collaboration with Iraq that I have seen
was the theft of a lone Palestiniaru&hop
keeper, blamed for selling goods during
the occupation, by a group of armed
Kuwaiti youths. Many Kuwaiti shops
operated during the occupation, but they
are not being held responsible.
Palestinians are being punished
because they are Palestinian, not because
of their actions.
One may wonder how so many Pales
tinians could have been so shortsighted as
to support Saddam. Although they did
not support him for annexing Kuwait,
they have waited so long for someone to
champion their cause that they appar
ently would have support nearly anyone,
regardless of his background or character.
In fact, they could hardly have picked

worse: Saddam was interested in their
cause only to save face, and he was
doomed to fail once President Bush made
it clear he would not mind going to war
over Kuwait.
The long-term aspirations of the Pales
tinians have most likely been hurt rather
than helped by Saddam. As one Arab offi
cial noted, "The Palestinians never miss
an opportunity to miss an opportunity."
Some Palestinians, sadly, even sup
ported the firing of missiles at Tel Aviv.
One Israeli wrote that his support for the
Palestinian cause was replaced by hatred
when he saw some Palestinian kids cheer
ing a Scud attack. He did not think it nec
essary to wonder what experiences had
made them so callous. But then he has
not been subject, year after year, to
oppressive curfews and arbitrary, violent
arrests and imprisonments, nor did he
have to fight in court, as the Palestinians
did, to obtain gas masks to protect his
people.
Instead of trying to understand, he
chose to hate an entire people at the sight
of a few kids cheering while his and their
lives were in danger.
Often even less is needed for someone
to hate another ethnic group. Ethnic
strife erupts around the globe with
depressing regularity; no group seems
immune. Just this weekend, federal
Yugoslav troops were called to Croatia to
protect the Serbian minority. And in the
past year alone, the world has seen
widespread ethnic violence in, among oth
ers, Bulgaria, Romania, the Soviet Union,
Liberia, Rwanda and Somalia.
People are quick to nourish a mortal

hatred for another ethnic group based on
unsubstantiated reports of some isolated
incident. The veracity of those reports is
to be doubted, and the full complexity of
the incidents is never understood. Cer
tainly it is simpler to see matters in black
and white, but it is also dangerous.
The Israeli cited above argued that the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict can be solved
only through outside intervention.
Although I doubt the utility of imposed
solutions, he is at least partially right:
Hating a whole people in return, instead
of trying to understand why one of them
may hate you, will solve nothing. Yet
hatred requires less thought and no self
criticism, so all too often it is the "solu
tion" people choose.
I hope that those Kuwaitis who per
sonally know some Palestinians are not
participating in the violence; it is hard to
hate people you know. The number of
incidents fueling ethnic hatred would be
greatly reduced if people tried to under
stand those incidents and their own role
in them.
As Nobel Peace Prize winner Lester
Pearson once said: "How can there be
peace without people understanding each
other, and how can this be if they don't
know each other?"

how many United World College gradu
ates recognize that last quotation. His
