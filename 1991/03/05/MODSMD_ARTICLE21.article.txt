## Focus on social, not physical implications of disability 
### 
THE FEB. 26 ARTICLE ON Janette
Sampson is misrepresenting the
message many disabled students
(including Sampson) fight hard to com
municate. The article, consistent with
many societal messages, is patronizing to
disabled people by focusing on aspects of
their disability that are relatively irrele
vant to them.
Sampson is quoted as saying, "Most
visually impaired people take care of
themselves." Thus, she attempts to
downplay the physical ramifications of
her disability in order to focus on social
implications.
Many people must feel that if they
were to suddenly become visually
impaired, being a campus tour guide

would be very difficult, and Sampson
certainly merits praise for accomplishing
such a feat. But Sampson is in a differ
ent frame of reference: Being visually
impaired for several years, she has
adjusted to adversity just as anyone else
would —by learning to deal with not
being able to do certain things.
If one were to substitute a type of
adversity faced by another minority,
would we see a headline such as "She
leads campus tours — and is black?"
I would be much more impressed if
The Daily gave more accounts of the
social adversity that Sampson has faced.
Many disabled people agree that the
social ramifications of disability — mis
understanding, awkwardness, devalua-

tion, dehumanization, prejudice and dis
crimination — pose a greater challenge
than mere physical adversity.
Although Sampson's quotes indicate
she is not as concerned with the physical
ramifications of her disability, the
reporter chose to patronize Sampson by
defending her "normalcy" and "ability"
despite her disability.
This reaffirms the article and soci
ety's presupposition that "normalcy" is
an ideal all minority cultures should
want to achieve. It would have been
more accurate to elaborate on Sampson's
real struggles against the manifestations
of societal pressures to be "normal" and
"well-adjusted."
Sampson suggests understanding dif-

ferences by attending events sponsored
by the Disabled Students' Speakers
Bureau — which is run through the Dis
abled Students of Stanford, not the Dis
ability Resource Center as the article
states. The article would have been more
appropriate if it had covered Sampson's
activity as a key member of the Disabled
Students at Stanford.
I encourage examining Sampson's dif
ferences from the majority, but don't
patronize her by ignoring the real adver
sity she faces. Praise her not for adapt
ing to adversity, something we all do, but
admire her for displaying pride in a stig
matized part of her life.
