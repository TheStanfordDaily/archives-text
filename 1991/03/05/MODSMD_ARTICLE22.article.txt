# Stanford students should recommit to environmental cause
## 
### 
It has been almost a year since the
huge celebration of Earth Day 1990.
None of the environmental problems
that were discussed on that day has gone
away. Most of them have gotten worse.
But the enthusiasm for environmen
tal issues has certainly faded. It is time
that Stanford students recommitted
themselves to the protection of the envi
ronment.
The most important and effective way
that this will begin to happen has noth
ing to do with the book "50 Ways to Save
the Earth" or with dorm recycling con
tests or with "short showers save water"
stickers.
Rather, the first step is to eliminate
the stigma placed on the word "environ
mentalism."
The worst thing that has happened to
environmentalism is that it has been
labeled as a liberal, "politically correct,"

reactionary movement.
In fact, environmentalism takes no
political sides. Most environmentally
beneficial programs are also beneficial to
economic and national security.
As examples, a ban on clearcutting of
forests in favor of sustainable forestry
would ultimately save the timber indus
try from its own self-destruction. A
strong national conservation program
would reduce our dependence on foreign
oil and save millions of dollars.
Spending money now to provide bet
ter sewage treatment and to stop the
dumping of toxins into our water will
save us from monumental costs of clean
ing our harbors later.
Stanford students in particular need
to think about these issues because we
are the ones most likely to have powerful
positions in business, media and politics,
and thus will have the ability to bring
about widespread environmental preser
vation, or widespread environmental
destruction.
When people begin to think honestly
and without prejudice about environ
mentalism, they will realize that it is not

a political issue, but an intelligent issue
