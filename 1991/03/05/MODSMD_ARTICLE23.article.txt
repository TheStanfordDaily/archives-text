# Survivor of sexual abuse can seek help through CAPS group
## 
### 
The following "Confidential To " let
ter is the best avenue I could think of
using to reach an anonymous student
who left a note in my mailbox. It was
clear from her note that additional infor
mation about support and campus
resources would be helpful to her. I am
hoping you will see the importance of
publishing my letter to her; I know of no
other way to let her know her needs are
understood and help is available. Thank
you for your sensitivity concerning this
matter.
Confidential to "A Student,"
I read your note with a great deal of
concern. I am troubled that I have no
other way to communicate with you
except through the newspaper.

But I understand your need to remain
anonymous; the emotional, psychological
and spiritual pain of childhood sexual
abuse is deep and confusing. I want to let
you know about a newly formed group
that is for students such as yourself. It is
a support group for survivors of molesta
tion.
The group is facilitated by Gail Nelli
gan, one of the staff psychiatrists at
Counseling and Psychological Services. I
have spoken with her about the group
and assure you that your desire for heal
ing, your pain and your courage to seek
help will be met with sensitivity, profes
sional competence and compassion.
Your efforts to find healing through
support and therapy tell me that you
have already taken an important step —
you are reaching out for help. Please call
Gail Nelligan about her group (723-
3785).
You will continue to be in my
thoughts and prayers. You are blessed
with courage.
I wish you well as you embark on your
journey toward wholeness.
