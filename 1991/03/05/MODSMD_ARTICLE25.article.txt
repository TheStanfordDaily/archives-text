## Greg Cumberford Illusory need for war neglected real national interests 
### 
EUPHORIA. TRIUMPH. Celebra
tion. We all want to see our sons
and daughters, our brothers and
sisters, our friends and acquaintances
returned safely home from the Persian
Gulf to our loving embraces. We want to
honor their dedication and to marvel at
the fact that they survived.
We want their lives to be full of famil
iar sights and sounds. Mercifully, allied
casualties in the Gulf war were low, so
many soldiers, will be returned home.
But in my heart lies a heaviness more
dense and opaque than that which I felt
after the first bombs fell on Baghdad.
This thick weight I carry has a name:
remorse.
I feel remorse because I now dwell in a
society which, for the most part, believes
that war — the systematic killing of fel
low human beings —is still an expedient
and practical way to resolve differences
between nations.
I live in a country whose leaders I fear
will now do everything possible to cele
brate its mercenary heroism, to entrust in
its military the true security of nations,
and to mute public debate over the appro
priateness of a permanent wartime econ
omy.
Where our government expended so
much effort trying not to personalize and
render graphically the war's devastation
of lives, I see that it will now do a great
deal to personalize the bravery and
resolve shown by our armed men and
women.

While many of us need to see and feel
the human dimensions of victory in war, I
detest the huge barrack of silence into
which news of the depredation we have
caused is thrown by military censors.
So many of us — indeed, many who in
other arenas march in the streets to pre
serve the sanctity of life — will never
think to look deeper into our complicity in
this war and will never commit personally
to creating a world in which warfare is
obsolete by any standard.
In neglecting to ask fundamental ques
tions about whose interests drive our
nation's cyclic need to slowly build and
then colossally destroy both our own and
others' arsenals, we resign the human
species to evolutionary obsolescence.

We confine our potential as humans to
enabling an institutional race to see
which nation can "commodify" its natu
ral resources first and divide the rich
from the poor most covertly.
Instead of seeing how deeply humanity
needs to shift its economic and political
resources toward energy efficiency and
conservation, biodiversity, population
growth control and lasting prosperity in
developing nations, our myopic president
has committed the nation's hearts and
psyches — and their wallets — to an eco
nomic need for war.
We will watch him continually talk of
peace, stability and national security over
the next six years, all the while building
the logic of war into his federal budgets,

his research priorities and his policy ini
tiatives. (Watch out, nations of the Andes
. . . you are next.)
If Bush and his administration truly
desire peace and stability for the nation
they serve, they would commit today to
scaling back those sectors of our economy
that require national insecurity to pros
per.
Oil companies would not be given the
green light on increased domestic oil pro
duction — they would be told that energy
efficiency and conservation are the way of
the 21st century and to re-tool, re-train
and re-invest appropriately.
Defense contractors would not be
thrown a life ring in the Persian Gulf —
they would be told that global security
requires an intensive research, develop
ment and production effort to protect and
purify this planet's oceans, soils, forests
and atmosphere.
The armed forces would have their
constitutional mandate broadened to
include environmental security and
would be trained for rapid deployment —
along with similar forces from other
nations — to the areas of the world hard
est hit by climate change, famine and the
toxic effects of numerous waste streams
and spills.
Our vast military organization is, so
far, impotent and blind to these crimes
against human lives — leaving the strug
gles to gestate in under-funded civilian
agencies like the Environmental Protec
tion Agency and the National Science

Foundation.
A good example would be set if Bush
began to array a multinational ecological
restoration force in the Gulf with the
same moral fervor that he summoned to
push back Iraq.
Staggering Persian Gulf losses in
marine mammals, coral reef systems and
sea birds are predicted for the next
decade. Will Bush simply chalk up these
silent victims as an acceptable cost of war
— blaming the entire tragedy on his deci
mated enemy — or will he hold up a new
standard that includes commitments to
environmental restoration before, during
and after our periodic frenzies against
one another?
My remorse stems from the fact that a
sustainable world view, and its implica
tions for our grandchildren, escapes the
man most capable of implementing it,
fresh as he is from glorious victory
against the enemy he and his predecessor
built.
My hope is that we who rejoice over the
next several months upon the return of
our beloved and brave will also have the
foresight to begin the long process of loos
ening our personal bonds — through our
jobs, our tax dollars and our vaunted way
of life — to the illusory need for war.

in environmental earth sciences. Next
quarter he is offering a SWOPSI course
entitled "Military Research at Stanford:
History and Options."
