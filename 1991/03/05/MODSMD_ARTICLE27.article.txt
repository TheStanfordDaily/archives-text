## Picking a Pac-10 All-Bozo team 
### 
Well, since the Pac-10
basketball season will
be over in five days, 1
guess it's time once again to
roll out the annual postseason
awards.
No, not the usual, boring
All-Pac-10 teams; if I did any
thing like that it would imply
that I actually know something
about basketball. No chance.
Instead, the theme for this
year's honors has to be stupid
ity: Whether you call it a year
of insanity, a year of parity, or
just a year of low IQ's, a lot of
things didn't go according to
plan this season in the Pac-10.
And so, in honor of Pac-10
official Rich "You're all a bunch
of chickens—t" Ballesteros, we
now present the first annual
Ballesteros Awards (a.k.a.
"The Richies"), honoring the
sublime, the ridiculous, the
stupid and the screwy in Pac
-10 hoops:

First, the coveted Richie B.
Award for Heinous Refer
eeing: to Ballesteros himself,
for that unbelievably stupid
charge called on John Patrick
with 32 seconds left in the Ari
zona game. If any Stanford
fans (or a certain objective
sportwriter) in Maples had had
a gun, Ballesteros wouldn't be
with us today. (And gee,
wouldn't that be a shame,
huh?)
Along the same line, The
Bill Laimbeer Award for
Flopping goes to Arizona's
Matt Othick for taking that
slight elbow from Patrick,
flying through the air and land
ing on his butt to draw the
charge call from Ballesteros.
Teammate Sean Rooks said
later that Othick deserved an
Academy Award, but he'll just
have to settle for this one.
Next, sponsored by Ameri
can Express, we have The
Don't Ever Leave Home at
All Award: to the Washington
trip, a.k.a. Five Days in Travel
ling Hell. How the heck do 23
people all get booked on a 19-
seat plane?
Subsidiary honors for trav
elling f—-ups include The
Baggage Maulers Trophy to
United, for only misplacing the
entire team's luggage once dur
ing the Washington fiasco; The
Most Expensive Breakfast
Ever Award to the Airport
Hilton at SFO — 10 bucks for
breakfast ain't much fun on
The Daily's $15-a-day food
budget — and The "Can We
Go Home Now, Please?"
Medallion to the Seattle fog,
which almost forced the Stan
ford contingent to spend a fifth
straight night in a hotel at the
end of the trip.
The "Why the Hell is This
Team in the Pac-10?"
Award goes to Washington
State. I'm sorry, but any school
that's more than an hour away
from even a small airport really
doesn't deserve to be in the
conference. It causes infinite
travel problems, and besides,
who wants to go to Pullman
anyway?
The Chutzpah Prize, or
The "Let's See if I Can Fit
My Size 14s into My Mouth"
Award: to UCLA's Don
Mac Lean, who said only a few
hours before the Jan. 16 Stan
ford-UCLA game that there
was no way the Bruins could
lose. Oops.
The "Who Makes Up This
Stupid Schedule?" Trophy:
to Raycom, the Pac-10 office

and anyone involved with
screwing Stanford over on its
conference road trips. There
are four road swings for
each Pac-10 school during the
season, and this year all four of
Stanford's were "extended"
trips that lasted a day longer
than they had to: Thursday
and Sunday games in Oregon,
Wednesday and Saturday in
L.A., Thursday and Sunday in
Washington and Thursday and
Tuesday in Arizona.
Quick: How many other
Pac-10 schools had four
extended road trips? Zero. Had
many had three long trips?
Zero. Three schools had two,
four had one and two had none.
Is it something we said?
The "Naw, It's Nothing
Personal" Golden Whistle:
to referee Ron Richardson, for
calling three technical fouls on
Stanford's Mike Montgomery
in the last three years.
The "Hey, It's Casual"
Plaque for Snappy Dress
ing: to ASU coach Bill Frieder,
who kept coming to postgame
press conferences wearing a T
shirt, slacks and an extremely
grungy towel slung over his
shoulder.
The "Pat, I'd Like to Buy
A Foul" Trophy: to Stan
ford's Adam Keefe, who has
spent the entire season taking
elbows, hands, shoulders and
fists under the hoop. If Keefe
went to the line every time he
was actually fouled instead of
every time a foul was called,
he'd have about 3,000 free
throws this season. At least.
Speaking of fouls, let's have
a hand for the recipients of
The "You Mean a Headlock
is an Illegal Pick?" Plat
inum Handcuffs: the Wash
ington State Cougars, who
used every karate move in the
book to get their guards open
last month in Pullman. Accept
ing for the Cougs will be center
Brian Paine, who also receives
the prized Oaf of the Year
Feedbag full of raw meat.
In a swell coincidence, Paine
and the Cougars will be accom
panied to the award stand by
the three jackasses who refer
eed that game. They'll belhere
to pick up the Pac-10's hfehest
officiating honor: The Larry,
Curly and Moe Plaque for
Stupidity Above and
Beyond the Call.
The "All Right, Shut Up
Already" Coach of the Year*
Award: to WSU's Kelvin
Sampson, simply because he
keeps saying that he deserves
it.
The "My Mom Usually
Picks Out My Clothes, But
She Couldn't Make the
Trip" Silver Hanger: To
Mac Lean for showing up court
side at Maples in a horrendous
maybe-it's-olive-maybe-its
brown suit. Iccchhh.
The "No, It's Supposed
to Look Like That" Scissors
go to Stanford's own Jason
Weaver, for sporting either the
most stylish (or the most
ridiculous, according to Mont
gomery) mohawk in the Pac
-10. Weaver also wins the award
for Hugest Shorts on the
Planet, but that's just an exhi
bition category this year.
And, finally, The Goodbye,
Good Riddance and Don't
Ever Come Back Award: to
the bone spurs that ended
Andrew Vlahov's season. I
never liked bone spurs before,
but now ...
I hate 'em.

Cameron Macky, The Daily's
men's basketball writer, will
soon be receiving the coveted
"Maybe You Should Have
Gone to Class Last Quarter"
Grades. Again.

The "Who Makes Up This
Stupid Schedule?" Trophy:
to Raycom, the Pac-10 office

and anyone involved with
screwing Stanford over on its
conference road trips. There
are four road swings for
each Pac-10 school during the
season, and this year all four of
Stanford's were "extended"
trips that lasted a day longer
than they had to: Thursday
and Sunday games in Oregon,
Wednesday and Saturday in
L.A., Thursday and Sunday in
Washington and Thursday and
Tuesday in Arizona.
Quick: How many other
Pac-10 schools had four
extended road trips? Zero. Had
many had three long trips?
Zero. Three schools had two,
four had one and two had none.
Is it something we said?
The "Naw, It's Nothing
Personal" Golden Whistle:
to referee Ron Richardson, for
calling three technical fouls on
Stanford's Mike Montgomery
in the last three years.
The "Hey, It's Casual"
Plaque for Snappy Dress
ing: to ASU coach Bill Frieder,
who kept coming to postgame
press conferences wearing a T
shirt, slacks and an extremely
grungy towel slung over his
shoulder.
The "Pat, I'd Like to Buy
A Foul" Trophy: to Stan
ford's Adam Keefe, who has
spent the entire season taking
elbows, hands, shoulders and
fists under the hoop. If Keefe
went to the line every time he
was actually fouled instead of
every time a foul was called,
he'd have about 3,000 free
throws this season. At least.
Speaking of fouls, let's have
a hand for the recipients of
The "You Mean a Headlock
is an Illegal Pick?" Plat
inum Handcuffs: the Wash
ington State Cougars, who
used every karate move in the
book to get their guards open
last month in Pullman. Accept
ing for the Cougs will be center
Brian Paine, who also receives
the prized Oaf of the Year
Feedbag full of raw meat.
In a swell coincidence, Paine
and the Cougars will be accom
panied to the award stand by
the three jackasses who refer
eed that game. They'll belhere
to pick up the Pac-10's hfehest
officiating honor: The Larry,
Curly and Moe Plaque for
Stupidity Above and
Beyond the Call.
The "All Right, Shut Up
Already" Coach of the Year*
Award: to WSU's Kelvin
Sampson, simply because he
keeps saying that he deserves
it.
The "My Mom Usually
Picks Out My Clothes, But
She Couldn't Make the
Trip" Silver Hanger: To
Mac Lean for showing up court
side at Maples in a horrendous
maybe-it's-olive-maybe-its
brown suit. Iccchhh.
The "No, It's Supposed
to Look Like That" Scissors
go to Stanford's own Jason
Weaver, for sporting either the
most stylish (or the most
ridiculous, according to Mont
gomery) mohawk in the Pac
-10. Weaver also wins the award
for Hugest Shorts on the
Planet, but that's just an exhi
bition category this year.
And, finally, The Goodbye,
Good Riddance and Don't
Ever Come Back Award: to
the bone spurs that ended
Andrew Vlahov's season. I
never liked bone spurs before,
but now ...
I hate 'em.

Cameron Macky, The Daily's
men's basketball writer, will
soon be receiving the coveted
"Maybe You Should Have
Gone to Class Last Quarter"
Grades. Again.

Well, since the Pac-10
basketball season will
be over in five days, 1
guess it's time once again to
roll out the annual postseason
awards.
No, not the usual, boring
All-Pac-10 teams; if I did any
thing like that it would imply
that I actually know something
about basketball. No chance.
Instead, the theme for this
year's honors has to be stupid
ity: Whether you call it a year
of insanity, a year of parity, or
just a year of low IQ's, a lot of
things didn't go according to
plan this season in the Pac-10.
And so, in honor of Pac-10
official Rich "You're all a bunch
of chickens—t" Ballesteros, we
now present the first annual
Ballesteros Awards (a.k.a.
"The Richies"), honoring the
sublime, the ridiculous, the
stupid and the screwy in Pac
-10 hoops:

First, the coveted Richie B.
Award for Heinous Refer
eeing: to Ballesteros himself,
for that unbelievably stupid
charge called on John Patrick
with 32 seconds left in the Ari
zona game. If any Stanford
fans (or a certain objective
sportwriter) in Maples had had
a gun, Ballesteros wouldn't be
with us today. (And gee,
wouldn't that be a shame,
huh?)
Along the same line, The
Bill Laimbeer Award for
Flopping goes to Arizona's
Matt Othick for taking that
slight elbow from Patrick,
flying through the air and land
ing on his butt to draw the
charge call from Ballesteros.
Teammate Sean Rooks said
later that Othick deserved an
Academy Award, but he'll just
have to settle for this one.
Next, sponsored by Ameri
can Express, we have The
Don't Ever Leave Home at
All Award: to the Washington
trip, a.k.a. Five Days in Travel
ling Hell. How the heck do 23
people all get booked on a 19-
seat plane?
Subsidiary honors for trav
elling f—-ups include The
Baggage Maulers Trophy to
United, for only misplacing the
entire team's luggage once dur
ing the Washington fiasco; The
Most Expensive Breakfast
Ever Award to the Airport
Hilton at SFO — 10 bucks for
breakfast ain't much fun on
The Daily's $15-a-day food
budget — and The "Can We
Go Home Now, Please?"
Medallion to the Seattle fog,
which almost forced the Stan
ford contingent to spend a fifth
straight night in a hotel at the
end of the trip.
The "Why the Hell is This
Team in the Pac-10?"
Award goes to Washington
State. I'm sorry, but any school
that's more than an hour away
from even a small airport really
doesn't deserve to be in the
conference. It causes infinite
travel problems, and besides,
who wants to go to Pullman
anyway?
The Chutzpah Prize, or
The "Let's See if I Can Fit
My Size 14s into My Mouth"
Award: to UCLA's Don
Mac Lean, who said only a few
hours before the Jan. 16 Stan
ford-UCLA game that there
was no way the Bruins could
lose. Oops.
