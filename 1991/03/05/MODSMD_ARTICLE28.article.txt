Due to the continuing (sur
prise!) rain in Northern Califor
nia, the Stanford men's golf
team's and baseball team's plans
are all wet.
The rain soaked the Rancho
Marieta Golf Course in Sacramen
to yesterday, halting the team's
round after seven holes. The Car

dinal will attempt to play 18 holes
again today.
Also, the Stanford baseball
team canceled today's game
against Sacramento State due to
the inclement weather. The con
test will not be made up.
To replace the match, the Car
dinal added a game against San
Jose State to be played at Sunken

weather permitting.
