# Women fencers win West Regional
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
While the Cardinal women's
swim team was continuing its
domination and the women's
team was losing its, the Stanford
fencing teams tried to continue
their own winning ways over the
weekend.
But while the Stanford women
won the Western Regionals for the
eighth consecutive year at Long
Beach State, the Cardinal men
finished second, ending their
streak at two years.
Led by sophomore Lana Kang,
the meet's outstanding woman
fencer, the Cardinal cruised to vic
tories against all of its opponents.
Kang went undefeated in the
team competition to spearhead
the effort.
In the individual competition,
Kang continued her winning ways
against all opponents. Unfortu
nately for her, however, she had to
compete against her Stanford
teammates as well, and ended up
taking third. Seniors Olivia Jud
son and Grace Chang took first
and second to complete the Cardi
nal sweep of the individual compe
tition.
The highlight on the men's side
was the success of the Cardinal
foil team. Led by Stan Brobston,
who took third in the individual
competition, the Stanford men's
foil team won the Western
Regional title.
In a bit of an upset, Long Beach
State's sabre team upset Stanford
to win the title. Thanks to that
win by their sabre team, the hosts

defeated the Cardinal 15-12 for
Stanford's only defeat. Thus the
49ers won the overall men's title
with the Cardinal grabbing sec
ond.
Stanford's sabre team won the
rest of its matches to finish second
and junior Leonard D'Amico went
undefeated in the team competi

tion to earn the outstanding
fencer award for sabre. D'Amico
also went undefeated during the
individual competition to win
that.
Led by David Brody, who took
fourth in the individual competi
tion, the epee team took third.
"Foil did an outstanding job,"

men's coach Zoran Tulum said.
"Epee was holding even with very
strong teams.
Sabre was the only team that
didn't do what I expected. Overall,
I'm not satisfied, especially when
you lose that close, but the fencers
did everything they could."

The Stanford fencing teams competed at the Western Regionals at Long Beach State over the weekend.
While the organization of the tournament may not have been the best, the Cardinal's performance was
certainly worth writing home about as the women won the title and the men took second.
