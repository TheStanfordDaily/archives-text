# Students fight to keep office open

### Sonya Martinez 
A student group has decided to try to
convince the University not to eliminate
the office of Fernando de Necochea,
assistant provost and adviser to the
president on Mexican-American affairs.
The organization, Save Our Latino
Resources, was formed in early January
and includes about 20 students from the
Chicano/Latino community. The group
has met and plans to continue to meet
with administrators to voice concerns
about the effects of closing the office.
During the past week, student
activists met separately with acting Vice
President for Planning and Manage-

ment Raymond Bac
chetti, acting Vice Presi
dent for Student Re
sources Sally Mahoney
and Provost James
Rosse. At the meetings,
they asked administra
tors to review the
office's functions and
reconsider the decision
to close the office, mem
bers said.

The decision to close the office and
lay off de Necochea was announced in
January.
Group member Michael Canul said
closing the office breaks promises the

University made to students in its Uni
versity Committee on Minority Issues
report, but the University doesn't real
ize that students "aren't going to allow
it to detract" from the report.
As another reason for keeping the
office, Canul said de Necochea's office
"supports a lot of student programs and
gives a lot of money to a lot of different
Mexican-American cultural programs"
that promote student leadership and
community service on campus and in
Redwood City.
However, administrators say the cut
back was necessary for budgetary rea-
