# Students fight to keep office open

### Sonya Martinez 
A student group has decided to try to
convince the University not to eliminate
the office of Fernando de Necochea,
assistant provost and adviser to the
president on Mexican-American affairs.
The organization, Save Our Latino
Resources, was formed in early January
and includes about 20 students from the
Chicano/Latino community. The group
has met and plans to continue to meet
with administrators to voice concerns
about the effects of closing the office.
During the past week, student
activists met separately with acting Vice
President for Planning and Manage-

ment Raymond Bac
chetti, acting Vice Presi
dent for Student Re
sources Sally Mahoney
and Provost James
Rosse. At the meetings,
they asked administra
tors to review the
office's functions and
reconsider the decision
to close the office, mem
bers said.

The decision to close the office and
lay off de Necochea was announced in
January.
Group member Michael Canul said
closing the office breaks promises the

University made to students in its Uni
versity Committee on Minority Issues
report, but the University doesn't real
ize that students "aren't going to allow
it to detract" from the report.
As another reason for keeping the
office, Canul said de Necochea's office
"supports a lot of student programs and
gives a lot of money to a lot of different
Mexican-American cultural programs"
that promote student leadership and
community service on campus and in
Redwood City.
However, administrators say the cut
back was necessary for budgetary rea-


de Necochea
sons and some of the functions of
the office will be transferred to
other departments.
Bacchetti, who made the deci
sion to close the office, said he had
to eliminate $1.25 million from
the support staff budget as part of
the University's overall reduction
of $22 million from its operating
budget.
He added that in deciding
which offices to close, there were
two principal considerations: the
size of the office and the Univer
sity's plan to decentralize many
administrative functions. The
President's and Provost's offices
are getting smaller, he said, and
much of their work will be redis
tributed or eliminated.
Rosse said he advised the stu
dents to "get together with peo
ple" from related offices and cre
ate a plan for keeping the func
tions of the office alive in other
locations.
Bacchetti said the goal now is
to determine which of the office's
functions can be relocated and
which can be closed down with
the least effect on the community.
Some contributions have been
secured from corporations, and
$10,000 to $15,000 in program
money is still available, he said.
Most of the $100,000 operating
budget, however, "is just gone,"
he added. "I wish we weren't
doing this."
Students objected that Bac
chetti had not consulted the cam
pus Chicano/ Latino community
before making his decision. "He
was blind. He didn't... try to get
advice from other people who
would be affected," Martin said.
At a meeting with Mahoney,
group members also requested
the rehiring of Silvia Castillo, de
Necochea's secretary, who was
laid off last week, said Adriana
Martinez, a group member who
attended the meeting. Mahoney
refused.
