# Mahoney trying to get back her stroke
## 
### Kevin Roth 
Anne Mahoney feels she has
something to prove.
Called one of the "top two or
three swimmers we've ever
recruited," by coach Richard
Quick, the backstroking Mahoney
was expected to play a pivotal role
in leading the Stanford women's
swimming team to a second con
secutive NCAA title last year.
But it was not to be. The Cardi
nal lost to Texas in the NCAA
finals and Mahoney suffered
through a season-long ordeal she
describes as "awful."
"I swam so bad last year," she
said. "If someone would have told
me how bad I was going to do last
year, I wouldn't ever have believed
them."
Now a sophomore, Mahoney
has worked hard to get her stroke
back, and based on the results, it's
paying off. She is swimming a sec
ond and a half quicker than at this
time last year and may be ready to
once again attain world-class sta
tus.
"I think a lot of people in the
swimming community have given
up on me," she said. "They're
kind of saying, 'Yeah, Anne was
pretty good in high school but
she's all washed up now.'
"And it's not like a vendetta or
something negative that I'm out
to prove, but I just want to show
people that I'm going to recover
from last year, and I'm going to be
swimming fast again."
Anne Mahoney has been swim
ming fast since the age of nine,
when her mother first introduced

her to the sport. "We used to go to
a lake a lot and she didn't want me
to drown so she put me in swim
ming lessons," Mahoney said.
Four years later, the Wichita,
Kan. native qualified for the
Junior Nationals, her first
national-level meet. But she did
more than merely qualify;
Mahoney finished second in the
100-meter backstroke.
This performance not only
perved notice that she was an up
and-comer in the swimming
world, but it also served notice to
herself. For the first time
Mahoney realized that she could
compete beyond the local level.
"I remember watching the
Olympics in '84 thinking that
what I was doing was in no way
connected because there was no
chance that I, or anybody else that
I knew at that time would end up
in the Olympics," she said. "Then,
when I was 13, and went to the
Junior Nationals and got second, I
thought 'wow.' "
Mahoney rose rapidly up the
swimming ladder. When she was
15, she finished second at the
World Championship Trials in
Orlando and qualified for the
American team that would be
swimming at the World Champi
onships in Madrid.
"It was a shock," she said. "I
think I made that team because I
was too stupid to be intimidated."
Intimidated or not, Mahoney
made the most of her first trip out
of the country by finishing sev
enth against many of the women
she'd watched on T.V just two
vears earlier.

"I was the baby
of the team," she
said. "I was scared
to death because I
was with all these
Olympians and
people that I had
just gotten auto
graphs and pic
tures of the year
before."

It seemed inevitable that by the
time the next Olympics rolled
around in 1988, the situation
would be reversed and Mahoney
would be the object of some young
swimmer's awe. But, as Mahoney
said, "things don't always go as
you think they might."
She came in third at the
Olympic Trials, missing the team
by the kind of nightmarish mar
gin that should only be whispered:
seven hundredths of a second.
Seven hundredths of a second
away from Seoul.
"It was really numbing," she
said. "At first it was a huge relief
that it was over because it was so
nerve-wracking. And then I got
really, really upset later."
Going back for her senior year
of high school following the Trials
was probably the toughest part.
As Mahoney put it, she was now
forced to deal with the sometimes
spoken, sometimes unspoken
question of her classmates: "If
you're so good, why didn't you
make the Olympic team?"
"It was just not a good situa
tion," she said. "Here I was, I
could be in the Olympics, but no, I
was in high school."
Of course, as it was her senior

year, high school wouldn't last
much longer, and in spite of inter
est from schools like California
and Alabama, Mahoney knew
early in the recruiting process
what her top college choice would
be. "Nothing stood out in my
mind like Stanford did," she said.
Along with Stanford's aca
demic advantages, Mahoney liked
the idea that she would be just one
of a number of great swimmers on
the team.
"At home, I was the star, and I
wanted to come someplace where
I wasn't the star. And I wanted to
be on a team where the people I
was surrounded with had the
same high expectations and goals
that I did."
But then came last year, when
new surroundings and new train
ing methods conspired to throw
off Mahoney's once-sweet stroke.
"Just like in any sport, when
you come to a school like Stanford
or a team like this one, the adjust
ment can be a little bit tough,'
Quick said. He added that "she
may have been doing a little too
much endurance training."
Quick recommended that
Mahoney concentrate on back
stroke training rather than the
more general approach she had
taken throughout high school.
The distances she swam in prac
tice were also much longer than in
the past.
"It was awful," she said. "I
worked so hard that basically, I
lost all technique in my stroke and


Mahoney
my stroke fell apart."
The disappointing season cul
minated with the NCAA champi
onships, where the Cardinal lost
the closest NCAA meet in history
by 9.5 points and Mahoney's 100-
yard backstroke time was a huge
three seconds off her best. Accord
ing to Mahoney, "Swimming
World magazine made a point to
say that 'Anne Mahoney, three
time indoor national champion in
the 100 back, didn't score a point.'
I felt terrible."
After all the support her team
mates had shown her during the
year, Mahoney felt as if she had let
them down.
"I didn't feel like I was pulling
my share," she said. "They all
were doing great, and I felt like a
dud. I wasn't contributing and I
wasn't helping the team."
But according to teammate
Lori Heisick, throughout it all
Mahoney remained a "really,
really caring person."
"I think she handled it better
than any person I can possibly
imagine," Heisick said. "She
showed she was a real team
player. She was really supportive
of everyone else."
"Anne was most concerned she
hadn't done the job for the team,"
Quick agreed. "Everybody knew
she was trying as hard as she
could. She remained an upbeat,
positive person."
Mahoney praised Quick for his
handling of the situation as well.
"He came up to me after my

100 back [at NCAAs] and he said,
'Anne, I was wrong. We did the
wrong things in your training.' I
was really impressed by that
because someone else would have
said, 'She didn't swim well, but it
was her fault.' He took a lot of the
responsibility."
This year, Mahoney is training
with the sprinters rather than the
distance swimmers and has been
concentrating on getting her
stroke back to where it was. She
credits asst. coach Matt Kredich
with helping her, and says that on
the whole her times and workouts
are "a lot faster" than last year.
Still, the memories of last year
have not been entirely wiped
away.
"If I have a bad workout, it
really stays with me," she said. "I
have those creeping, nagging
doubts. So last year kind of plays
with my mind a little bit. I'm a lit
tle bit scared."
But despite the occasional fear,
Mahoney "won't be happy until
I'm getting best times again" and
would like nothing more than to
get revenge at the NCAAs.
"I feel like I've focused a lot of
my frustration and anger at the
University of Texas because they
beat us last year," she said. "So I
really, really want to beat them."
"I admire Anne a lot," Quick
said. "She went through a lot. Her
concern for the team and for her
own goals was an inspiration to
me.
"I think a lot of people would
have given up," Heisick said. "But
she came into this season ready to
start again. I'm really proud of
her."
