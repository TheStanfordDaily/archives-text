# Mahoney trying to get back her stroke
## 
### Kevin Roth 
Anne Mahoney feels she has
something to prove.
Called one of the "top two or
three swimmers we've ever
recruited," by coach Richard
Quick, the backstroking Mahoney
was expected to play a pivotal role
in leading the Stanford women's
swimming team to a second con
secutive NCAA title last year.
But it was not to be. The Cardi
nal lost to Texas in the NCAA
finals and Mahoney suffered
through a season-long ordeal she
describes as "awful."
"I swam so bad last year," she
said. "If someone would have told
me how bad I was going to do last
year, I wouldn't ever have believed
them."
Now a sophomore, Mahoney
has worked hard to get her stroke
back, and based on the results, it's
paying off. She is swimming a sec
ond and a half quicker than at this
time last year and may be ready to
once again attain world-class sta
tus.
"I think a lot of people in the
swimming community have given
up on me," she said. "They're
kind of saying, 'Yeah, Anne was
pretty good in high school but
she's all washed up now.'
"And it's not like a vendetta or
something negative that I'm out
to prove, but I just want to show
people that I'm going to recover
from last year, and I'm going to be
swimming fast again."
Anne Mahoney has been swim
ming fast since the age of nine,
when her mother first introduced

her to the sport. "We used to go to
a lake a lot and she didn't want me
to drown so she put me in swim
ming lessons," Mahoney said.
Four years later, the Wichita,
Kan. native qualified for the
Junior Nationals, her first
national-level meet. But she did
more than merely qualify;
Mahoney finished second in the
100-meter backstroke.
This performance not only
perved notice that she was an up
and-comer in the swimming
world, but it also served notice to
herself. For the first time
Mahoney realized that she could
compete beyond the local level.
"I remember watching the
Olympics in '84 thinking that
what I was doing was in no way
connected because there was no
chance that I, or anybody else that
I knew at that time would end up
in the Olympics," she said. "Then,
when I was 13, and went to the
Junior Nationals and got second, I
thought 'wow.' "
Mahoney rose rapidly up the
swimming ladder. When she was
15, she finished second at the
World Championship Trials in
Orlando and qualified for the
American team that would be
swimming at the World Champi
onships in Madrid.
"It was a shock," she said. "I
think I made that team because I
was too stupid to be intimidated."
Intimidated or not, Mahoney
made the most of her first trip out
of the country by finishing sev
enth against many of the women
she'd watched on T.V just two
vears earlier.

"I was the baby
of the team," she
said. "I was scared
to death because I
was with all these
Olympians and
people that I had
just gotten auto
graphs and pic
tures of the year
before."

It seemed inevitable that by the
time the next Olympics rolled
around in 1988, the situation
would be reversed and Mahoney
would be the object of some young
swimmer's awe. But, as Mahoney
said, "things don't always go as
you think they might."
She came in third at the
Olympic Trials, missing the team
by the kind of nightmarish mar
gin that should only be whispered:
seven hundredths of a second.
Seven hundredths of a second
away from Seoul.
"It was really numbing," she
said. "At first it was a huge relief
that it was over because it was so
nerve-wracking. And then I got
really, really upset later."
Going back for her senior year
of high school following the Trials
was probably the toughest part.
As Mahoney put it, she was now
forced to deal with the sometimes
spoken, sometimes unspoken
question of her classmates: "If
you're so good, why didn't you
make the Olympic team?"
"It was just not a good situa
tion," she said. "Here I was, I
could be in the Olympics, but no, I
was in high school."
Of course, as it was her senior

year, high school wouldn't last
much longer, and in spite of inter
est from schools like California
and Alabama, Mahoney knew
early in the recruiting process
what her top college choice would
be. "Nothing stood out in my
mind like Stanford did," she said.
Along with Stanford's aca
demic advantages, Mahoney liked
the idea that she would be just one
of a number of great swimmers on
the team.
"At home, I was the star, and I
wanted to come someplace where
I wasn't the star. And I wanted to
be on a team where the people I
was surrounded with had the
same high expectations and goals
that I did."
But then came last year, when
new surroundings and new train
ing methods conspired to throw
off Mahoney's once-sweet stroke.
"Just like in any sport, when
you come to a school like Stanford
or a team like this one, the adjust
ment can be a little bit tough,'
Quick said. He added that "she
may have been doing a little too
much endurance training."
Quick recommended that
Mahoney concentrate on back
stroke training rather than the
more general approach she had
taken throughout high school.
The distances she swam in prac
tice were also much longer than in
the past.
"It was awful," she said. "I
worked so hard that basically, I
lost all technique in my stroke and
