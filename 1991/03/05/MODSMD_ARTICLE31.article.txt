# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
Great performances speak for them
selves. Eighteen points, 15 assists, five
steals. High bar, 9.90; pommel horse, 9.90;
parallel bars, 9.95. Well, maybe they don't
actually speak for themselves, but they do
win Athlete of the Week honors here at The
Stanford Daily.
So, congratulations are in order for
women's basketball's Sonja Henning and
men's gymnastics' Jair Lynch.

Henning, a 5-foot-8 senior from Racine,
Wis., captained the good ship Cardinal to at
least a share of the Pacific 10 Conference
title by almost singlehandedly holding off
California Friday night.
Her aforementioned line not only was
critical in determining the 93-80 final score,
it put Henning all over the record books. She
now has 700 career assists, which makes her
only the 10th woman in the history of the
sport to reach that plateau.
Should Henning pick up 52 more assists
before season's end, she'll surpass former
teammate Jennifer Azzi for the No. 1 spot
on the all-time Cardinal list. However, it will
take just one more steal for her to top Azzi's
school and Pac-10 steals record of 271.
Henning and her teammates head up to
Oregon this weekend to close out the regular
season. They are expected to earn a first
round bye for the NCAA tournament and
should host a second-round game in a little
over two weeks.

Lynch, a 5-4 sophomore from Washing
ton, D.C., posted some unbelievable num
bers as Stanford routed San Jose State and
Michigan in Maples Pavilion Friday. The
Cardinal's score of 286.80 was the highest
scored by any team in the nation this year,
according to coach Sadao Hamada.
The All-American Lynch scored better
than 9.7 on five of the six events and won
the all-around with a score of 58.40
His troika of 9.90-or-better scores in the
high bar, pommel horse and parallel bars

tells, in short, the story of a remarkable
evening. But the highlight was that Lynch's
parallel bars routine received a perfect 10
from one of the judges.
Hamada said some of his star's routine
were of Olympic-gold medal quality.
The fourth-ranked Cardinal is currently
the hottest team in the nation and a favorite
to capture the NCAA title at the national
championships in Penn State this April.
