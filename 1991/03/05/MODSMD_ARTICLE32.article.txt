# Public service for spring break
## Haas Center sponsors vacation alternatives 
### Dan Stearns Staff writer 
For many Stanford students, spring break is a
time to return home, relax in front of the television
and perhaps spend a few days at the beach.
But nearly 100 Stanford students will have an
entirely different type of vacation by participating in
Alternative Spring Break Projects, a social-service
program run through the Haas Public Service Cen
ter.
Seven teams of about 14 members each will scat
ter to parts of California and New Mexico to work in
homeless shelters and mental hospitals, restore
parks and forests, teach junior high school students
about the great outdoors and work at a Zuni Pueblo.
The program, now in its fourth year, is one of
many designed to spark student interest in commu
nity service.
"We take a wide range of people," said project
director Alex Chen, a sophomore. "We want to get
people involved in public service, and keep them
involved."
The participants, selected out of a pool of 120
applicants, were put together to ensure diversity of
age and public-service background. Each team is
assisted by one student leader and one faculty or
staff adviser.

Mike Simon is the student leader for the "Home
lessness in Los Angeles" trip. Simon, a junior, said
his experience last year working with the homelesß
in San Francisco "opened his eyes" to the needs of
the homeless.
Simon's team will spend four nights in Pasadena
at the Union Station Depot, a shelter for the home
less. They will meet with the facility's directors, feed
the homeless and do anything else the shelter needs.
The team will take a one-day excursion to observe
operations at San Diego's St. Vincent De Paul shel
ter. Simon said St. Vincent De Paul is considered a
"model shelter" in the nation.
Junior Steve Williams will also lead a team of stu
dents to help the homeless, but his group will work
in San Francisco. "I'm very excited — there [have
been] months of preparation," said Williams.
Other students will work with park rangers in
Marin County to replant native vegetation that has
been taken over by exotic species. In New Mexico, a
team will travel to a Zuni pueblo and Hopi reserva
tion to do landscape work, take care of children and
observe customs of a different culture.
Other trips include reforestation in Stanislaus
County, an outdoor education camp in Petaluma
with junior high school students and work at Napa
State hospital and at mental-health facilities in
Santa Clara County.
