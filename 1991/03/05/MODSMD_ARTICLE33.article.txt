# Speaker: Look to native cultures for solutions
## 
### Anthony Shih 
The solutions to many environmental prob
lems lie within the Native American way of
life, said Winona LaDuke, a Cree Indian, dur
ing a speech to an audience of about 70 last
night at Kresge Auditorium.
Speaking on a Native American view of the
environmental and feminist movements,
LaDuke called for a "structural change" of
modern industrial society from one that uses
too many resources to one that only takes what
it needs. She added that the "totally racist and
sexist" industrial society has put women into
secondary roles.
LaDuke, a graduate of Harvard and Antioch
Universities, is actively involved in environ
mental issues and land rights and serves as

president of the Indigenous Women Network,
a Native American organization.
She said Native Americans used only those
resources that were needed to survive, a way of
life that directly conflicted with a Western soci
ety that "decimated the Indian populations in
order to denigrate the land."
The ignorance of non-Native Americans to
Native American problems is also a form of
oppression, since "if there are no victims, there
is no crime," she said.
LaDuke pointed to numerous instances of
ecological damage brought about by industrial
ization. She talked at length about the envi
ronmental effects of the damming of Canadian
rivers, which resulted in a devastating
decrease in the native animal population.
She called this hydroelectric project "the

northern equivalent of the deforestation of the
Amazon rain forests." She added that most of
the electricity from the power plants did not
benefit the Native Americans, but were
instead being sold to U.S. utilities like Boston
Edison.
LaDuke also brought up the topic of women
in Native American societies. She said that
they had been seen as the equals of men, but
upon contact with industrialization, they
became the targets of abuse and alcoholism. As
a result of troubles within their homes, "Indi
an women hesitate to join the women's rights
movements."
She challenged the audience to use the
Native American society as a model in making
a long-term change toward a more environ
mentally sound nation.
