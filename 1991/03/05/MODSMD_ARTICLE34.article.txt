### Howard Libit Staff writer 
The University will an
nounce the 1991 commence
ment speaker this morning,
according to Marlene Wine,
special assistant to University
President Donald Kennedy.
Wine said she had planned
to reveal the graduation
speaker's name yesterday but
still needed "one final piece of
information" before making
the announcement.
This year's June 16 com
mencement will honor Stan
ford's 100 th graduating class.
Marian Wright Edelman,
founder and president of the
Children's Defense Fund,
spoke at last year's graduation
ceremony.
Cartoonist Garry Trudeau,
creator of the nationally syndi
cated comic strip "Doones
bury," "Nightline" host Ted
Koppel and Robert Maynard,
editor of the Oakland Tribune,
also spoke at tecerit commence
ments.

Criticism has been levied
against the speaker selections
of the past several years. Many
students complained that Edel
man and Maynard lacked name
recognition and, while ack
nowledging that both were
good speakers, said they
wanted someone their parents
would recognize.
This year's speaker pro
mises to be a great one, said
Dave Asch, one of the Senior
Class Presidents.
"I think that it will be a very
good speaker ... who will offer
a very important message espe
cially relevant to the Centen
nial graduation," Asch said.
While refusing to reveal who
the speaker will be, Asch did
say the speaker "is very
involved in both the national
and local communities, which
will make [commencement]
very exciting. Because this is
the Centennial commencement
ceremony, there will be a lot of
national coverage, which is
something that person de
serves."
