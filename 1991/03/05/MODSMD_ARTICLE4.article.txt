# Probe: Track coaches violated NCAA rules
## Minor errors found in expense accounts 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
A five-month investigation has discov
ered that Stanford's track-and-field coach
unwittingly violated three types of NCAA
rules by treating athletes' and recruits'
families and high school coaches to meals at
University expense.
"The bad news is that [Track Coach
Brooks Johnsonl didn't know the rules
around these events," said Business Prof.
Jerry Porras, Stanford's faculty represen
tative to the Pacific 10 Conference and the
NCAA. "The good news is that he didn't try
to hide it on his expense reports.
"He was mainly operating from igno
rance of the rules," said Porras, who inves
tigated the incidents in an internal probe
along with Senior University Counsel Bob
Fourr.
Fourr and Porras, who had access to all
the track-and-field team's files, poured over
two years of financial records and uncov
ered three types of violations:
• The track team improperly paid for rel
atives of Stanford athletes and recruits to
be entertained at events at the Faculty
Club.
• On at least three occasions, high school
coaches were improperly entertained at off
campus restaurants.

Stanford track coaches paid for Palo Alto
High School coaches who were directors at
the Stanford Invitational track meet. John
son also hosted high-school coaches at a
New York meeting of the Athletics
Congress. In April 1990 he had lunch with
Los Gatos High School track coach Willie
Harmatz at the University's expense.
• On three instances, coaches filed
expense reports to pay the Faculty Club for
lunches where some of the guests listed
weren't in attendance. The investigation
found these errors to be ones of "inadver
tence."
"There was no effort to do anything
clandestine," Johnson said, noting that all
the dinners were clearly documented.
Since the violations were not inten
tional, no administrative action will be
taken against Johnson, said acting Athletic
Director Alan Cummings.
Johnson was also asked to review the
rules for operating expense accounts.
"We use rules violations as a form of
reminder," Cummings said. "This is an
opportunity to remind the coaches of the
importance of the rules. ... I don't expect
there will be any further action taken."
Cummings said the charges were
directed at Johnson and not at his three
full-time assistants. "The princi
pal responsibility rests with him,"
he said.
The allegations were made last
fall by a former Stanford athlete
who had been hired by the depart
ment as an assistant coach. Uni
versity President Donald Ken
nedy then asked the Legal Office
to conduct an investigation.
Porras and Fourr recently sent
a summary of their probe to the
Pac-10, which will review their
findings and will determine in a
few weeks if all the investigation
procedures have been followed.
In addition to the three types
of violations, the inquiry found a
few other minor transgressions.
Johnson was asked to pay back
the University for personal long
distance calls he made from his
office.
"They asked me, 'Did you

make these phone calls?' I said
'yes,'" said Johnson. He added,
"If I had said 'no,' there would
have been no way they could have
determined who had made them."
Although Johnson is reimburs
ing the University for the calls, he
will not be required to pay for the
dinners since he was unaware
that they were not allowed. "The
issue is the violation of rules, not
the expenses from a few occa
sions," Cummings said.
Some other expenses — non
school-related East Coast trips,
12 V-neck sweaters, shoes for
coaches and flying in a "recruit"

who had already graduated from
college — are on the borderline,
the investigators said. These
expenses do not violate NCAA
rules, they said, but should have
been cleared first.
Johnson praised the track-and
field squad for emerging from the
investigation with so few scars.
"I would defy any program to
undergo this same intense
scrutiny for five months and
come so clean," he said, adding
that "it's virtually impossible to
go a week without breaking an
NCAA rule" since the rules seem
to change almost weekly.
