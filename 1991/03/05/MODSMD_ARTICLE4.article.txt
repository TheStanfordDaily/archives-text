# Probe: Track coaches violated NCAA rules
## Minor errors found in expense accounts 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
A five-month investigation has discov
ered that Stanford's track-and-field coach
unwittingly violated three types of NCAA
rules by treating athletes' and recruits'
families and high school coaches to meals at
University expense.
"The bad news is that [Track Coach
Brooks Johnsonl didn't know the rules
around these events," said Business Prof.
Jerry Porras, Stanford's faculty represen
tative to the Pacific 10 Conference and the
NCAA. "The good news is that he didn't try
to hide it on his expense reports.
"He was mainly operating from igno
rance of the rules," said Porras, who inves
tigated the incidents in an internal probe
along with Senior University Counsel Bob
Fourr.
Fourr and Porras, who had access to all
the track-and-field team's files, poured over
two years of financial records and uncov
ered three types of violations:
• The track team improperly paid for rel
atives of Stanford athletes and recruits to
be entertained at events at the Faculty
Club.
• On at least three occasions, high school
coaches were improperly entertained at off
campus restaurants.

Stanford track coaches paid for Palo Alto
High School coaches who were directors at
the Stanford Invitational track meet. John
son also hosted high-school coaches at a
New York meeting of the Athletics
Congress. In April 1990 he had lunch with
Los Gatos High School track coach Willie
Harmatz at the University's expense.
• On three instances, coaches filed
expense reports to pay the Faculty Club for
lunches where some of the guests listed
weren't in attendance. The investigation
found these errors to be ones of "inadver
tence."
"There was no effort to do anything
clandestine," Johnson said, noting that all
the dinners were clearly documented.
Since the violations were not inten
tional, no administrative action will be
taken against Johnson, said acting Athletic
Director Alan Cummings.
Johnson was also asked to review the
rules for operating expense accounts.
"We use rules violations as a form of
reminder," Cummings said. "This is an
opportunity to remind the coaches of the
importance of the rules. ... I don't expect
there will be any further action taken."
Cummings said the charges were
directed at Johnson and not at his three
