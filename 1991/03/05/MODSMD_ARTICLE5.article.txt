# Officials to investigate fight during IM game
## 
### Peter Cousins Staff writer 
The Office of Student Affairs has begun
investigating a fight that erupted Wednes
day night between the Kappa Sigma and
Omega Psi Phi fraternities's intramural
basketball teams.
The scuffle took place at Maples Pavilion
during a playoff round between the two B
league teams.
The initial argument involved a player
from the Omega Psi Phi team who claimed
he was hit by a Kappa Sigma player just
after completing a shot, said sophomore
Joel Miller, the referee. Another member of
the Omega team came to his aid and push
ing and shoving resulted, he added.
At least two players were injured after
both teams swarmed onto the court. "One
Omega was hit in the mouth," Miller said,
but noted that he did not see this occur.
However, Miller said he did see a Kappa
Sigma player being kicked. "The Kappa Sig
was pushed to the floor over in the corner
[of Maples Pavilion] and I saw him being
kicked in the groin."
Miller said he understood the player was
later taken to the hospital.
Intramural sports director Howard Dall
mar said his office has submitted a report to
Michael Jackson, associate dean of student
affairs, who is conducting an investigation

into the matter. Miller and the other ref
eree, senior Tim Howey, also prepared
reports and submitted them to the intra
mural office.
Both teams have been eliminated from
the playoffs as a result of the fight, said stu
dent intramural director Eric Pane, a
senior. He said that since a student may
only compete on one IM team at a time, all
the team members from both fraternities
are ineligible to continue to play intramural
basketball this quarter.
In addition, two players from each team
will not be allowed to compete in any intra
mural activities spring quarter, Pane added.
Jackson acknowledged that his office is
investigating the fight. "We just got the
reports [from the referees and the intramu
ral office] this morning," he said yesterday,
"and we're looking into the incident." Stu
dent Affairs may seek punishments on indi
viduals or groups as a result of the fight,
Jackson said.
Program and Fraternal Affairs Adviser
Michael Ramsey-Perez said he was "dis
turbed about violence in general" and wor
ried that incidents like the fight may "raise
our level of tolerance" for violence.
He also expressed concern that because
Omega Psi Phi is a mostly black fraternity,
the relationship between the Interfrater-
