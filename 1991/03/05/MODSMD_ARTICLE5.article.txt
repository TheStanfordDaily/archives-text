# Officials to investigate fight during IM game
## 
### Peter Cousins Staff writer 
The Office of Student Affairs has begun
investigating a fight that erupted Wednes
day night between the Kappa Sigma and
Omega Psi Phi fraternities's intramural
basketball teams.
The scuffle took place at Maples Pavilion
during a playoff round between the two B
league teams.
The initial argument involved a player
from the Omega Psi Phi team who claimed
he was hit by a Kappa Sigma player just
after completing a shot, said sophomore
Joel Miller, the referee. Another member of
the Omega team came to his aid and push
ing and shoving resulted, he added.
At least two players were injured after
both teams swarmed onto the court. "One
Omega was hit in the mouth," Miller said,
but noted that he did not see this occur.
However, Miller said he did see a Kappa
Sigma player being kicked. "The Kappa Sig
was pushed to the floor over in the corner
[of Maples Pavilion] and I saw him being
kicked in the groin."
Miller said he understood the player was
later taken to the hospital.
Intramural sports director Howard Dall
mar said his office has submitted a report to
Michael Jackson, associate dean of student
affairs, who is conducting an investigation

into the matter. Miller and the other ref
eree, senior Tim Howey, also prepared
reports and submitted them to the intra
mural office.
Both teams have been eliminated from
the playoffs as a result of the fight, said stu
dent intramural director Eric Pane, a
senior. He said that since a student may
only compete on one IM team at a time, all
the team members from both fraternities
are ineligible to continue to play intramural
basketball this quarter.
In addition, two players from each team
will not be allowed to compete in any intra
mural activities spring quarter, Pane added.
Jackson acknowledged that his office is
investigating the fight. "We just got the
reports [from the referees and the intramu
ral office] this morning," he said yesterday,
"and we're looking into the incident." Stu
dent Affairs may seek punishments on indi
viduals or groups as a result of the fight,
Jackson said.
Program and Fraternal Affairs Adviser
Michael Ramsey-Perez said he was "dis
turbed about violence in general" and wor
ried that incidents like the fight may "raise
our level of tolerance" for violence.
He also expressed concern that because
Omega Psi Phi is a mostly black fraternity,
the relationship between the Interfrater-
nity Council and the African-
American Fraternity Society
might be jeopardized by the inci
dent. He said he hopes the inci
dent was not racially motivated.
Ramsey-Perez noted that the
IFC and the African-American
Fraternity Society are planning to
work together on joint projects.
A member of Kappa Sigma,
who wished to remain anony
mous, denied that the incident
had any racial implications or
motivation.
After the fight began, the
Kappa Sigma team came onto the
court, and the Omega Psi Phi
team followed. "I believe the
Kappa Sigma team came onto the
court to prevent a fight from
occurring," Miller said. "I think
some of the Omegas wanted to
stop a fight from happening and

some didn't."
Howey called the situation a
"confusing melee. We [the refer
ees] tried to separate the teams,"
he said, "but the key to ending the
fight was getting the Kappa Sig
mas out of Maples Pavilion."
Miller said the referees managed
to convince the Kappa Sigma
team to leave the gym.
Once the Kappa Sigmas had
left Maples, the referees blocked
the exit so that the Omega Psi Phi
team would not pursue them.
However, some Omega Psi Phi
members apparently ran out
other exit doors to catch the
Kappa Sigma team.
Howey said the other two
games playing in Maples com
pletely stopped to watch the
brawl. "There was dead silence,"
he said.
Howey and Miller agreed that
this quarter has been one of the
most violent in recent years of IM
basketball. "The tempers were
the hottest than I've ever seen on

an IM court," Howey said. Miller
said this basketball season has
been "unbelievably bad" and
added that the violence at the
game had been the most severe he
had ever seen.
Kappa Sigma basketball team
captain Chris Jones said the fight
was the result of overzealous play.
"It was a very intense game," he
said. But, "There's a certain
amount of pushing which occurs
in basketball," he said.
Jones, a senior, said the physi
cal contact which is typically a
part of the game had apparently
been misinterpreted. He
described the fight as "unfortu
nate," but noted that it was only
the result of tempers flaring at
the game itself. He said both he
and his team regard the event as
"over."
Dallmar expressed his disap
pointment over the incident but
recognized that disputes do occur.
"We have 220 teams and 110
games a week," he said.
