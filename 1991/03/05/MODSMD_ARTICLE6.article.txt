# BEYOND THE WAR
## POWs released; chaos reported in Iraqi cities 
### 
(AP) — After a cheeseburger lunch, six
Americans, three Britons and an Italian
headed out from Baghdad to Jordan and a real
taste of freedom yesterday, ending weeks as
prisoners of war.
Iraq's U.N. ambassador said all remaining
allied prisoners could be freed as soon as today.
The U.S. military reciprocated the prisoner
release by announcing that 300 Iraqi prisoners
held by the allies would be freed today or
Wednesday.
In southern Iraqi cities, meanwhile, Islamic
fundamentalists and others bent on ousting
President Saddam Hussein were reported
locked in street battles with Saddam's loyalist

Republican Guard in the angry aftermath of the Per
sian Gulf conflict.
Refugee and exile sources said rioters killed the
provincial governor and mayor of Basra, Iraq's
embattled second city.
Gen. Colin Powell, in Washington, again made
clear that the U.S. administration looks forward to a
Saddam-less Iraq.
"We hope a regime will emerge in Baghdad that is
committed finally to living in peace with its neigh
bors," the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman told a Vet
erans of Foreign Wars convention.
Diplomatic calendars were fast filling up as the
victors in war seek to set the course of peace.
The White House announced President Bush will
meet one-on-one with allied leaders in the coming
weeks to develop a blueprint for long-term stability
in the Persian Gulf.
Arab foreign ministers concluded one meeting in
Saudi Arabia yesterday and planned another for
Syria this week to set an Arab agenda for the peace.
Secretary of State James Baker will leave Washing
ton Wednesday to visit Mideast capitals to discuss
postwar issues with allied leaders.
Yesterday was the fifth day of a cease-fire that
ended the lightning war in which U.S. and allied
forces reversed Iraq's seven-month occupation of
Kuwait and devastated the once-powerful Iraqi
army.
American troops pressed on with cease-fire
chores of locating and removing thousands of land
and marine mines laid by the Iraqis, and other U.S.
soldiers got down to tasks of clean-up and pack-up
preparatory to flights home — under a still-uncer
tain withdrawal timetable.
Sketchy and sometimes confused reports
emerged from southern Iraq about the anti-govern
ment rioting that exploded there over the weekend.
Witnesses said violent protests occurred in at
least eight cities, stretching from Iraq's second
largest city, Basra, northward to the holy city of Kar
bala, 50 miles south of Baghdad, and in some places

the dissidents took over government buildings.
The loyalist Republican Guard forces "are
destroying everything in front of them. If anybody
shouts from a building they knock it down," Jorda
nian photographer Mahar Hakawati, heading from
Basra into Kuwait, told the Associated Press.
The freed prisoners, clad in yellow jumpsuits
bearing the letters "PW," were turned over to Red
Cross officers in Baghdad by Iraqi officers.
Ten ex-POWs began their long journey home yes
terday from Baghdad, freed by the Iraqis as an ini
tial gesture after Sunday's cease-fire meeting
between allied commander Gen. H. Norman
Schwarzkopf and Iraqi generals. The two sides

agreed at that meeting to a complete release of pris
oners.
Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations, Abdul
Amir al-Anbari, said yesterday that all remaining
allied prisoners could be freed as early as today.
"It's a matter of logistics," al-Anbari said on
CNN. "Otherwise we are prepared to repatriate all
so-called coalition POWs tomorrow if the airport
facilities allow. Otherwise definitely all of them, and
I emphasize all of them, American, British and other
members, will be repatriated through the (Red
Cross) in Baghdad either tomorrow or the day after
tomorrow."
