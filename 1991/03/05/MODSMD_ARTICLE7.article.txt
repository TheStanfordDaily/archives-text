The winter quarter recipients
of the James W. Lyons Award for
Service were announced yester
day.
They include senior Goodwin
Liu, seniors Julia Kazaks and
Joanne Lin, senior Michael Mac-
Crystall, medical student Tri
Nguyen and sophomore Nguyen
Hoang, and junior M6nica

Liu was awarded for his "devo
tion to multiculturalism and pub
lic service," including his work as
a member of this year's Council of
Presidents, as a co-director of the
1990 You Can Make A Difference
Conference and as an organizer of
the ASSU Leadership Summit,
said Nadine O'Leary, administra
tive assistant to the Dean of Stu
dent Affairs.
He was nominated for the
award by Catherine Milton of the
Haas Public Service Center and
John Pearson of Bechtel Interna
tional Center. Milton said Liu has
received many non-Stanford
awards, including a Rhodes Schol
arship, but she thought it was

important that he
also receive one
from Stanford.
Kazaks and Lin
were awarded for
their work on the
Stanford Literacy
Improvement Pro
ject. Kazaks said
that until this
year, the project

was fully funded by the Univer
sity. It was eliminated because of
budget cuts, but Kazaks and Lin
re-established it as a voluntary
student organization. Lin said the
project now supports about 35
weekly tutorials for Stanford
employees.
They were nominated for the
award by Soto Resident Fellows
John and Frenchie Perry.
MacCrystall received the
award "for consistent and stead
fast dedication to community ser
vice," O'Leary said. He is the
chair of the Stanford Volunteer
Network, coordinator of Youth
Community Service at Gunn High
School and director of Team, a
program which teaches physical
education to elementary school

students in East
Palo Alto.
He has also vol
unteered for the
Families in Tran
sition program in
East Palo Alto
and was a resi
dent assistant at
EAST House last
year.

MacCrystall was nominated by
senior Fedora Chin and by Victo
ria Deise of the public service cen
ter.
Nguyen and Hoang received
their award for their work on the
Vietnamese-American Conference
at Stanford, which, according to
Hoang, was the first of its kind in
the United States.
The conference dealt with
issues currently facing the Viet
namese-American community,
including problems among Viet
namese youth, building a political
foundation in the United States,
the future of Vietnamese commu
nities overseas and the relation
ship between these communities
