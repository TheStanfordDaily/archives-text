# Drama Prof. Russell dies
## 
### Michael Friedly Senior staff writer 
Douglas Russell, professor of drama and
Stanford graduate, died outside his Stanford
residence yesterday morning. He was 64.
Russell's body was discovered about noon
yesterday in a stream bed across from the
Lucille M. Nixon Elementary School on Stan
ford Avenue. The stream ran behind his May
field Avenue home.
Two joggers found the body and called the
police, said Stanford Police Chief Marvin Her
rington. Police officers then interviewed area
residents, including Russell's wife, Marilyn,
and determined the identity of the body, Her
rington said.
Marilyn Russell saw her husband early yes
terday morning, but she left the house and
returned to find her husband missing, Her
rington said.
"It appears as though — although the coro
ner has yet to do an investigation — the death
was either accidental or a heart attack or a
stroke," Herrington said. Russell
had a heart condition and suf
fered a mqjor heart attack about
10 years ago, some of Russell's
friends said.
Russell's death "is naturally a
shock. No one expected this —
everyone grieves [over] this," said
Drama Department Chair
Michael Ramsaur. "It leaves a
large void. His presence here as a
teacher, a designer and a friend
will be missed," he added.
Assoc. Drama Prof. William
Eddelman, one of Russell's close
friends, praised him for "the
artistic sophistication that he
brought to the department." He
said Russell was one of the top
American experts in the field of
costume history as well as an
authority in art history.
"It's a mqjor loss because we
don't get people that have that
kind of academic knowledge and
depth or the creativity that he
had," Eddelman said. "It's a
loss to Stanford and to the
American theater in general."
"How do you replace somebody

of that character and unique
ness?" Eddelman asked.
Russell received his bachelor's
in speech and drama from Stan
ford in 1949 and his master's here
a year later. After spending a year
on a Fulbright scholarship in
Stratford-on-Avon, England, he
received his master of fine arts
from Yale University in 1961.
He joined the Stanford faculty
that year as an associate profes
sor and became a full professor in
1977. He also taught at the
Carnegie Institute of Technology,
Florida State University and the
American Conservatory Theater
in San Francisco.
Russell taught three times at
the Stanford campus in Vienna,
Austria, before it was closed in
1986 in favor of the Berlin cam
pus.
He fought a losing battle to
keep the campus open. In a letter
to Campus Report, he wrote,
"The cultural experience to be
gained in Vienna [is] superior to
that at any other fully operational
campus."
He was also the author of a
number of books on costume
design, such as "Period Style for
the Theater," which are used as
textbooks by a number of univer

sity drama departments and com
munity theaters.
Russell was teaching History
of Costume and Fashion and
Introduction to Costume Design
and Construction this quarter
and designed the costumes for
"Spring Awakening," a Drama
Department production that
opens Wednesday night in the
Nitery theater.
He is survived by his wife and
his two children.
