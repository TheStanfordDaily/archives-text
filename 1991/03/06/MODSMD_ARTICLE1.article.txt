# BEYOND THE WAR
## Anti-Saddam revolts staged; POWs released 
### 
Saddam Hussein's security forces struggled
today to put down rebellions flaring in north
ern and southern Iraq, and 15 American POWs
— out of Iraqi hands but still in Iraq — waited
for clearer weather so they could leave.
The southern city of Basra, where heavy
fighting had been reported, was said to be back
under the control of pro-Saddam forces. But in
northern Iraq, Kurdish guerrillas claimed to
have seized at least five towns.
The fate of 28 Western journalists who had
gone to southern Iraq to cover the turmoil was still
unknown. They included four reporters from U.S.
news organizations: Neal Conan of National Public
Radio, Chris Hedges of The New York Times, and
Greg Lamotte and Tyrone Edwards of Cable News
Network.
The United States sent more than half a million
troops to fight the Persian Gulf War, and the first of
them could be coming home soon.
Pentagon sources said the 82nd Airborne Division
— among the first trops to go to the gulf — would be
among the first returning, arriving on Thursday.
President Bush is expected to discuss homecom
ing plans in a message to the nation tonight.
In a very different kind of homecoming, the first
of more than 63,000 Iraqi prisoners of war were to be
released today by the allies. Terms of the provisional
cease-fire call for a full prisoner release, but U.S. offi
cials say they will not repatriate any Iraqi soldier
against his will.
Plans call for 294 Iraqi POWs to be flown from
Saudi Arabia to Baghdad aboard a Red Cross plane
that would then bring back what Iraq says are the
last 35 allied prisoners. The exchange was scheduled
for yesterday, but high winds and poor visbility
forced flight delays.
The allied POWs — 15 Americans, nine Britons,
nine Saudis, an Italian and a Kuwaiti — were turned
over to the Red Cross in Baghdad yesterday.
