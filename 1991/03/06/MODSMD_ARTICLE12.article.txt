Environmentalists demand end
to Great Lakes toxic dumping
WASHINGTON (AP) — Government
efforts to rescue the polluted Great Lakes have
failed because they permit continued dumping
of poisonous chemicals into the waters, envi
ronmentalists said yesterday.
A coalition of environmental groups kicked
off a lobbying crusade for a "zero discharge"
federal policy that would phase out legally
accepted use of the lakes as a dumping ground
for toxic chemicals.
"Zero discharge is the only answer," said
Brett Hulsey, associate director of the Sierra
Club's Great Lakes Program. "Until the pollu
tants stop going down the pipes, up the stacks
and into the dumps, the fish on the table will
not be safe to eat, and the Great Lakes wildlife
will be at risk."
Chilean president urges army
to acknowledge past crimes
SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) — President Patri
cio Aylwin received support yesterday from
across the political spectrum for his candid
accounting of human rights violations under
Gen. Augusto Pinochet's former military
regime.
But the armed forces remained silent in the
face of the presidential appeal "to recognize
the pain they caused and lessen it."
In an emotional speech to the nation Mon
day night, Aylwin disclosed that 2,115 people
had been killed for political reasons during
Pinochet's 16 1/2-year reign.
