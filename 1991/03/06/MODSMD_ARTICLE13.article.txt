# Gorbachev, British leader discuss Baltics
## 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) — British Prime
Minister John said Mikhail Gor
bachev reassured him Tuesday that
under Soviet law, talks between Baltic
authorities and the Kremlin could lead
to independence for the Baltic
republics.
Major said that during four hours of
meetings, he outlined Britain's dismay
over the military crackdown in the
Baltics that has left 22 dead since Jan
uary and snags in the European con
ventional weapons treaty.
Major said the bulk of his talks with
the Soviet president focused on the
Persian Gulf War and the need for a
lasting post-war political settlement.
Major said at a news conference that
the Soviet Union agreed it was up to
countries in the region to decide how
best to guarantee their security.
Major's one-day visit to Moscow
was his first trip to the Soviet Union

since succeeding Margaret Thatcher as
prime minister in November. He was
the first western leader to visit
Mosocw since the outbreak of the war
and the violent crackdown in the
Baltics.
Mqjor had breakfast with represen
tatives of the three Baltic republics,
lunch with Gorbachev and dinner with
former Foreign Minister Eduard She
vardnadze. He also held talks with
Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov and
Prime Minister Valentin Pavlov.
"I expressed to President Gor
bachev the dismay that I felt and that
the West generally had felt about the
events in January of this year," Major
said, referring to the deaths in Lithua
nia and Latvia.
Western European countries with
drew offers of badly needed financial
aid to protest the violence. Britain, the
United States and most other Western

countries do not recognize the forced
Soviet annexation of the three Baltic
states in 1940.
"Mr. Gorbachev did indicate today
that at the end of negotiations,
through a constitutional process, the
prospect of independence was there,''
Major said.
"Now that, I think, is a worthwhile
and welcome reassurance and I hope
the Baltic states will accept it as such."
Gorbachev repeatedly said before
the January crackdown that he would
discuss Baltic independence only
under the terms of the Soviet constitu
tion, which requires a nationwide vote
on the issue and an extended period of
negotiations over compensation and
other matters.
Lithuania, which moved the fur
thest toward talks on independence
with the Kremlin, has accused Soviet
officials of foot-dragging. All three

republics have voted in referendums
since Feb. 9 to secede from the Soviet
Union, although Gorbachev has
refused to recognize the results.
Major said he raised with Yazov
British concerns over the Soviet deci
sion to redesignate three army divi
sions as navy amphibious forces. Major
portrayed the move as an apparent
attempt to exempt those forces from
the Conventional Force Agreement
signed in Paris last November.
"The defense minister set out his
response to that, and I think it was a
most useful and worthwhile ex
change," Major said.
Paraphrasing Mrs. Thatcher's
statement after her first talks with
Gorbachev, Major said. "I believe we
can say that the United Kingdom can
continue to do business with Mr. Gor
bachev in a very satisfactory manner."
