## Battles yet to be won 
### 
Dear president bush:
While you've been out win
ning the "mother of all bat
tles," a number of domestic battles
— indeed, a veritable family tree of
them — have been patiently await
ing your return.
These issues include everything
from the budget deficit to the
declining state of education. And
they have two things in common:
they've been plaguing us for a long
time, and they're issues of long
term importance that politicians
are generally afraid to confront.
But you're in a strong position
to deal with them right now. Fol
lowing a victorious and popular
war, Republicans and Democrats
alike are singing your praises.
The overwhelming majority of
Americans say they would vote for
you tomorrow, no matter who ran
against you. Now is the time to
tackle the issues that politicians
have skirted for decades.
Deficit reduction, for example, is

a topic that presidents tend to
overlook in an election year. Since
it involves tough choices — like tax
increases and spending cuts — that
don't pay off until years down the
road, politicians often avoid them.
Following a victorious war over
an oil-hoarding dictator, Ameri
cans are probably more willing
than they ever have been to cut
back their energy use. It would be
seen not only as environmentally
wise, but also as patriotic and pro-
American.
A sound education policy, with
money for primary as well as sec
ondary education, will also pay off
in the long run. It's not too late to
go down in history as the "Educa
tion President."
Harness the popularity of your
presidency and the unity of the
American people to lead a war
against the domestic problems that
have confronted America for years.
The most challenging battles have
yet to be won.
