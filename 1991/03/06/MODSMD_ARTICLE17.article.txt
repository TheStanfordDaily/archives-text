# Helping gays, lesbians
## 
### 
WHEN THOMAS Markowski
and James Leach, a gay
San Francisco couple,
learned they had AIDS, they
decided to set up a $200,000 schol
arship fund to benefit gay and les
bian students.
Over a year later, their dream is
coming to fruition, and it is inspir
ing to watch it bloom.
Gays and lesbians still suffer
massive discrimination, ranging
from gay-bashing to psychological
damage which results from being
forced to remain "in the closet."
And much of this discrimination
has society's stamp of approval.
Ideally, the Markowski-Leach
Fund will help counteract such
damage by making students more
comfortable with coming out.

Organizers say the interest from
the fund will enable them to dis
tribute 13 $1,000 scholarships to
gay and lesbian students at Stan
ford, UC-Berkeley and San Fran
cisco State annually, starting in the
fall of 1992.
Each award could go a long way
toward helping gay students whose
parents withdraw their financial
support because of their son's or
daughter's sexual preference.
Although Stanford may not be
able to participate in the policy
making of the fund because of the
University's non-discrimination
policy, Stanford students will most
likely be able to receive money, just
as students can use ROTC scholar
ships here despite military discrim
ination on the basis of sexual pref
erence.
