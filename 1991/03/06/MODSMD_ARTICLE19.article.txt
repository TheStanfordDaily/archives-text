## Nope, no radicals in here 
### 
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO START writ
ing about the failures of multicultur
alism — about how it has divided the
community more than it has united it —
when I realized that almost everyone I
could think of would agree with me, at
least in part.
I had gleefully envisioned the consti
pated grimaces my column would bring to
the faces of the throngs of outraged radi
cals swarming across campus, "dying" in
White Plaza to bring an end to the war, or
hurling SEAS mugs at people carrying
Bookstore bags. I imagined self-righteous
letters to the editor, and candlelight vigils
at the Claw to call for my death.
But there just aren't that many out
raged radicals out there.
Stanford politics are quietly deceptive.
We see office sit-ins and peace rallies and
hunger strikes, and we come to accept
something just short of militant Marxism
as the campus' prevailing political stance.
And why shouldn't we? The media, the
source of objective truth, confirms it for
us.
It seems as if three-quarters of the
articles, editorials, letters and columns in
The Daily focus on a multicultural or "lib
eral" issue. And The Stanford Review,
instead of developing an articulate, con
servative viewpoint, uses most of its space
to rant about the ever-expanding horrors
of the Loony Left. Even Newsweek and
The Wall Street Journal see fit to com
ment on Stanford's leftist sensibilities.
Our student representatives, mean
while, pass resolutions condemning
everything from unfair labor practices to
the U.S. presence in the Persian Gulf.

Some of them even join revolutionary
Marxist organizations, of which our pro
fessors, when they're not chaining them
selves to Hoover Tower to protest the
presence of Republicans on a good liberal
campus, are the leaders.
And maybe that's also how we'd like to
picture ourselves. We're in college now,
after all. We're supposed to get indignant
at social injustices, shake things up a bit,
and tell the Establishment to go to hell.
It's our turn to change the world, isn't it?
The truth, I think, is somewhat more
sedate. Sure, most of us are pretty liberal;
we recycle, we think war is a bad thing,
and we feel that homosexuals, women
and ethnic minorities aren't getting a fair
shake from society. But the knee-jerk,
fire-breathing, hell-raising variety of lib
eralism that we hear so much about is
largely a myth.
The ASSU Senate, The Daily and the
Council of Presidents may lean precipi
tously to the left, in some people's eyes,
but the predilections of the students in
charge of those organizations, however
prominent, are hardly representative of
the rest of us. Those students are simply
more politically active than most people,
and more vocal.
When one COP member welcomed last
year's freshmen with an angry, pro
foundly radical speech about her percep
tions of social injustice and the need for
multiculturalism, the reception she
received wasn't positive. Maybe she
intended to inspire us with her powerful
words; maybe she meant to make us
uncomfortable, and in that way force us
to think about the issues.

Either way, she failed.
She seriously misjudged her audience.
She expected us to be sympathetic to rad
ical rhetoric, and we weren't; many of us
felt alienated by her implication that we
had somehow helped to oppress her fore
bears. And it was an insult to our intelli
gence that this woman thought she had to
get up on stage and win us over with
anger, rather than reason.
That's why I don't think I'd have to
worry too much about a lynch mob if I
were to write a column critical of multi
culturalism. As long as I had a strong
foundation for my argument, I think that
most people, however committed to a lib
eral agenda, would be willing to listen.
Politics, for all the glamour of radical
rage, are hard-pressed to compete with
thoughtful intellectual discourse.
That may be our loss; we may never
change the world with calm, plodding,
carefully reasoned debate. But I'd like to
think that we will, and that the world will
be better for it.

A typical example of the members of the
audience at last year's Orientation
speech, Ed Heinemann is so much of an
activist that he didn't even show up to
stop his Marxist editors from watering
down his politically incorrect arguments.
