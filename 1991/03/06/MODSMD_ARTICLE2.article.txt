# Fraternity offers plan for housing
## 
### Connie Chang Editorial staff 
The Alpha Epsilon Pi frater
nity yesterday submitted a pro
posal to the University requesting
to become the 11th housed frater
nity on campus.
Six University departments —
including the Office of Residential
Education, the Office of Student
Affairs and the Board of Trustees
— were given a request for per
mission "to construct a 40-bed
house [on campus] that would be
built at no cost to the University."
Alpha Epsilon Pi is among
three unhoused fraternities cur
rently seeking on-campus hous
ing.
The proposal says the frater
nity would like to construct a
house on the "currently vacant,
although zoned for fraternity use,
triangle land between the Kappa
Alpha House, Sigma Alpha
Epsilon House and former Alpha
Delt House (currently the
Enchanted Broccoli Forest)."
The fraternity also suggested
the "land vacated by the destruc
tion of the Synergy and Delta Tau
Delta houses" as alternative
building sites, adding that with
help from its national organiza
tion it could cover the costs of ren
ovating the houses "rather than
seeing them destroyed."
The 5-page proposal contends
the fraternity's request does not
conflict with a University policy
barring more housing for subjec
tively selective groups.
The University policy states,
"the University is committed to
allowing some selective housing,
but does not plan to increase sig
nificantly the proportion of spaces
filled by subjectively selective
means."
The proposal notes that in
1982, the year the policy took
effect, housed fraternities consti
tuted 10.6 percent of all under
graduate housing. This year, fra-'
ternities make up 8.2 percent of
all undergraduate housing.
Thus, an unused 128 spaces
can be allocated to fraternal
groups while maintaining the
1982 proportion, the report
states. The opening of Kimball
Hall this fall may decrease the
percentage further.
Program and Fraternal Affairs
Adviser Michael Ramsey-Perez is
working with Alpha Epsilon Pi,
Sigma Nu and Sigma Phi Epsilon
on proposals to obtain on-campus
housing. He predicted getting per
mission from the University will
be "real tough."
He said he has not heard any
talk among the administration
about amending the policy and
adding or reallocating undergrad
uate housing spaces for fraterni
ties.
