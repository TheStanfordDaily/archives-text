## Chicano, Latino faculty committed to students, culture 
### 
AS MEMBERS OF THE Chicano
and Latino community, we would
like to express our united support
and appreciation to the Chicano faculty
here at Stanford.
The Chicano faculty have served and
supported our entire community on
many levels. First, their advocacy for our
community and our issues has been vital
in the creation of a strong Chicano and
Latino presence here at Stanford.
Through their vision and dedication
to our community, we have been able to
establish, nurture and institutionalize
many resources such as the Stanford
Center for Chicano Research, the Chi
cano Fellows Program and El Centro
Chicano.
In addition, the Stanford Chicano fac
ulty provide a wealth of information that
serves to strengthen and encourage the
growth of our community as a whole and
of each of the individuals that compose
the group. We learn not only from the
classes that they offer but also from
their commitment to active participation
in the community.
In sharing their knowledge and expe

rience, they stress the value and impor
tance of giving back to our community
and working for the betterment of our
people.
Furthermore, our Chicano faculty
members provide students with role
models of achievement and success.
Some of their research opens doors
through which Chicano and Latino his
tories, cultures and issues gain a position
of academic importance. Others explore
and discover new approaches to univer
sal social, economic and political prob
lems.
Because their work is so diverse, the
Chicano faculty are able to offer every
Chicano person something. Their exam
ple of academic freedom and inquiry
allows us to explore whatever questions
we might find interesting, whether they
be Chicano or global issues.
As a result, our Chicano faculty mem
bers are important advisers, advocates
and friends who help each and every one
of us to realize our potential as scholars
and as people, not just as Chicanos.
Moreover, Stanford's Chicano faculty
members have set a high standard for

community service. Because they are
very few in number, much of their time
is taken by academic responsibilities,
pressure to publish and research, and
University committee duties.
In spite of the high demands of their
extensive obligations as faculty mem
bers, they still find the time to advocate,
participate and share. They are a dedi
cated group which has invariably acted
out of commitment and concern for Chi
canos and Latinos here at Stanford.
Graduate School of Business Prof.
Jerry Porras is no exception to this
assessment of Stanford's Chicano fac
ulty. His commitment to the growth of
El Centro Chicano and his diligent ser
vice to our community is inspired by
unselfishness and hope.
Examples of this are his service as
chair of the Search Committee for the
Dean of El Centro Chicano, as a member
of the Interim Advisory Committee and
as the current faculty representative on
El Centro's Guiding Concilio.
Above all, he is a person willing to
support long-term goals and initiatives.
Few people in our community can chal

lenge Porras' exceptional academic and
community achievement. For many Chi
cano and Latino people who aspire to
become business leaders, he is a
paradigm of success and service. He has
shown many that one can both pursue
personal and academic interests and still
take time to serve one's community.
At a time when character assassina
tion and factionalism seem to be the
strategies of some members of our com
munity, it is important that we all sup
port and appreciate our faculty.
Most importantly, Porras, like any
other minority professor, should never be
put to a color test. No one should sug
gest that a Chicano or Latino sacrifices
his or her ethnicity when he or she pur
sues interests that are not "Chicano."
Porras' relentless love for his work
and his people is proof that academic
achievement and service are not mutu
ally exclusive. Those who question this
love should ask whether they themselves
live up to the standards to which they
unfairly hold others.
