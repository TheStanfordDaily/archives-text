# Harms of Persian Gulf war include massive damage to Earth
## 
### 
THE EARTH HAS suffered casual
ties in the Gulf war, ones that will
have serious future repercussions.
The fires burning in the 500 Kuwaiti
oil wells torched by the Iraqis could take
up to four years to extinguish. Anyone
seeing the photos of blackened Kuwaiti
skies can see that timetable is a tragedy.
The fires may cause an equatorial
ozone hole, resulting in an increase in
skin cancer. And though there is dis
agreement over whether the fires will
affect global climate, there is less doubt
that both surface temperature and vital
monsoon rains will be reduced in regions
downwind of Kuwait.

The animals dying and perhaps going
extinct in the oil slicks in the Persian
Gulf are evidence that humans hurt
more than themselves with their foolish
ness.
Our planet is already strained by
human use and abuse, and we cannot
afford to disregard the earth in wartime
as Saddam Hussein did by using oil as a
weapon, and as the Bush administration
did in August by exempting the U.S. mil
itary from required environmental
impact assessments.
In a war fought in large part over oil,
the Pentagon set a terrible example of
fuel efficiency, using the same amount of

energy in one year as used by the entire
U.S. mass transit system in almost 14
years. The military measures its fuel use
not in miles per gallon, but in gallons per
mile.
In addition, the new Bush administra
tion energy policy is an insult to Ameri
cans, particularly to those who fought in
this war or who suffer from pollution
related illnesses.
Contrary to initial reports of perfectly
aimed smart bombs, the coalition bomb
ing raids damaged civilian areas in Iraq
badly. The destroyed infrastructures of
both Iraq and Kuwait are already spark
ing predictions of widespread disease

from lack of safe water supplies.
In thinking about the future, poten
tial enemies must realize that putting
the health of the Earth in further jeop
ardy to achieve political goals is a seri
ously incorrect ordering of priorities that
will undermine any hopes we might have
for improving our quality of life.
