## SLAC 'B-factory' would help explore how universe can exist 
### Chris Patil Editorial staff 
From the lowliest hand-held reflector to the
embarrassingly aberrant Hubble Telescope, mirrors
seem to be inescapably plagued by irregularities.
Flawed, too, is a cosmic "mirror" known as CP
symmetry. Yet rather than causing problems, the
crack in the CP mirror is responsible for the domi
nance of matter over antimatter in our universe.
CP symmetry holds that certain physical phe
nomena should remain unchanged if matter is
changed to antimatter (the C operation) and the
result is then viewed in a mirror (the FJ or "parity,"
operation).
Less than one-millionth of one second after the
"Big Bang," matter and antimatter existed in equal
amounts. During the rapid expansion that followed,
most particles found their antiparticles, and the
pairs annihilated.
If CP symmetry were perfect, only those few par
ticles that could not find partners would have sur
vived the universe's first second. A slight flaw in the
balance, however, allowed a narrow margin of ordi
nary matter to survive and form, over time, the mat
ter-dominated universe that makes our existence
possible.
A desire to study this imbalance has motivated
scientists at Stanford Linear Accelerator Center to
propose construction of a $168 million facility called
an "asymmetric B-factory," explicitly designed to
explore CP violation in the decays of particles known
as B-mesons.
Because current theories of particle physics make
widely different predictions about the decays of B
mesons, study of these particles will develop physi
cists' understanding of fundamental interactions in
nature.
"The standard model description of what hap
pened when the Big Bang occurred is entirely mat
ter-antimatter symmetric," explains Prof. Jonathan
Dorfan, SLAC faculty member and chair of the B
factory project. "There should have been an equal
number of particles and antiparticles.
"Those should have simply annihilated each
other," Dorfan continued, "and it's not obvious why
one should have accreted out a stable universe in
which all the stable elements are made out of mat
ter."
CP violation, which provides a way to distinguish
between a universe of matter and one of antimatter,
"is a necessary ingredient for understanding why
we're here at all," Dorfan explained.
"The theoretical edifice that we have for particle
physics — what we call the 'standard model' — has a
mechanism whereby a neutral K-meson or a neutral
B-meson can actually flip itself into its antiparticle.
This process is called mixing," Dorfan said.
Thus far, the balance between matter and anti
matter in mesonic mixing has been measured only in
K-meson systems. But, observations of K-meson
decays alone cannot distinguish between the uni
verses described by the standard model ind by com
peting theories.
However, the standard model does differ from
other theories in its predictions about decays of B
mesons.
"In certain B decays," Dorfan said, "the standard
model unambiguously predicts an asymmetry. The
superweak (a theory that posits an additional force
to account for CP asymmetry) predicts [this asym
metry] to be absolutely zero."
Since no facility on earth is optimally designed to
study these B-meson decays, SLAC physicists have
proposed modifications to the existing linear acceler
ator that would convert SLAC into an asymmetric B
factory.
The B-factory would retain much of the current
SLAC facility: The 2.2-km long PEP storage ring, as
well as the existing linear accelerator or "linac,"
would be integral parts of the proposed research
installation. During B-factory operation, the PEP

ring would store a beam of high-energy electrons.
The largest change outlined in the proposal is the
construction of a new beam storage ring, which
would be built in the tunnel that houses the PEP
ring. The new ring would house a beam of positrons,
which would travel through their ring in a direction

opposite to that of the electrons.
Physicists will be able to use measurements made
possible by the new facility to determine whether the
standard model of particle physics describes reality
accurately at this previously unexplored level.
The quality of existing facilities at SLAC makes

those who have worked on the proposal confident
that the center will receive the grant.
"SLAC's chances are reasonably good because it's
such a strong technical proposal, and the physics is
so important," said Dr. Elliott Bloom, a SLAC fac
ulty member who has been a B-factory advocate for
many years.
If observations made possible by the B-factory
verify the standard model's predictions, "what we'd
like to do is to categorize the CP violation in the
standard model in excruciating detail," Bloom said.
Because previous studies of CP violation have
been unable to distinguish between the standard
model and other theories, it is possible that the B
factory experiments could force physicists to rethink
some aspects of the theoretical basis of their science.
However, a failure of the standard model to pre
dict one aspect of B-meson decays does not mean
that physicists would need to rebuild their whole
theoretical apparatus.
Regardless of the outcome of the B-factory exper
iments, it is certain that new observations made pos
sible by the facility would provide important insights
about the accuracy of current theories of particle
interactions.
"The theories that go beyond the standard model
tend to invoke new degrees of freedom that come
from very high energies," Bloom concluded. Study of
CP violation "is a way of probing very high energies
without actually building a machine to go to those
energies.
"We might find that there are deviations of the
standard model, which could lead us to a deeper
understanding of new phenomena ."
