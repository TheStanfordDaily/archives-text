# Meson production reaction in the asymmetric B-factory

After electrons and positrons
leave the linac (the linear accelera
tor), they are "bunched" into spatial
ly compact groups and injected into
the storage rings.
Once inside the storage rings, the
particles will only interact under
carefully controlled conditions in a
single site at the intersection of the
rings. A finely tuned system of mag
nets will direct and focus the beams.
When the beams collide, the
positron-electron pairs will annihi
late to form a "virtual photon," a par
ticle with zero mass and momentum
but a large amount of energy.
Because photons — the particles that
compose light — do not ordinarily
exist in such a state, the lifetime of
the virtual photon is short.

The virtual photon decays into a
quark and an antiquark — particles
even more fundamental than the pro
tons and neutrons that make up
atomic nuclei — which at the ener
gies used in the B-factory will exist at
a "resonance" known as the
upsilon(4S).
A resonance is a state in which the
cross-sectional area of the pair is
effectively enhanced.
The upsilon(4S) then decay into a
B-meson and an anti-B-raeson, also
known as a "B-bar."
If the electrons and positrons were
moving with the same energies
before the collision, their momenta
would cancel and the B-meson prod
ucts would not be moving afterward.
Because Band B-bar lifetimes are

short, it would be virtually impossi
ble to measure even comparatively
large differences in the decay times of
the mesons if the particles were sta
tionary.
However, because the B-factory
rings will store beams of different
energies, the particles will collide to
form products that are moving with
respect to the lab. This relative
motion will enable physicists to mea
sure the distance between the Band
B-bar when they decay, translating a
time difference to a more easily mea
sured distance.
Unfortunately, the decay of B
mesons into the "channel" that
exhibits CP violation is rare: Only
one in 10,000 decays gives the
desired products. Because such a

small proportion of collision events is
experimentally significant, designers
of the B-factory plan to construct a
facility that is able to produce large
numbers of events in a short period
of time.
"The key to getting high reaction
rates is to get very high currents in
the storage ring," said Elliott Bloom,
a SLAC physicist who has been a B
factory advocate for many years.
Although the particles in the B
factory ring would circulate at rela
tively low energies — 9 GeV and 3.1
GeV as compared to the present ener
gy of about 30 GeV — the currents
required to give an appreciable reac
tion rate would be 20 times greater
than the currents running in the
existing ring.
