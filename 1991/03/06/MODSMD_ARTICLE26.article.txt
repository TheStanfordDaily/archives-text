# House calls provide frail elderly with needed medical attention
## 
### Lisa Goldman 
Local elderly people who have diffi
culty getting to a hospital, and those
who are intimidated by hospital set
tings, can now receive medical attention
without leaving their homes.
Stanford Medical Center's new
Senior Care Program enables geriatri
cians to make house calls to the elderly,
thus helping patients avoid preventable
health problems and adding a human
touch to the care that the elderly
receive.
The program, which is located at the
Stanford Midpeninsula Health Center
in downtown Palo Alto, is the result of
10 years of planning by Dr. Carol Wino
grad, Stanford's chief of clinical pro
grams in geriatric medicine.
Working with Winograd at the center
are Stanford Hospital geriatricians Ann
Ferris and Cynthia Clinkingbeard.
The idea for the house-call program
originated with an attempt by the Medi
cal Center to bring medical services to
the homes of older people who cannot
visit a doctor when they are ill. Rather
than allow such patients to go without
medical attention, the three geriatri
cians chose to make house calls.
When making house calls, the doc
tors' assessments are not limited to the
patients' medical problems. Doctors also
determine their patients' functional
abilities, including how well they take
care of themselves in terms of eating,
sleeping and general living.
In addition, the program's geriatri
cians take special care to examine the
patients' living conditions, focusing on
factors that range from nutrition to pos
sible physical dangers such as slippery

floors and unsteady banisters.
"You can examine how safe the home
environment is in terms of falls and
iryury risk," Winograd pointed out.
Doctors can also examine the medica
tions that the patients may be taking.
Many older people take medicines for
multiple conditions, and the combina
tions of some drugs can adversely affect
a patient. When geriatricians visit the
patients' homes, they are able to go
through a patient's medicine cabinet
and throw out old medicines or ones
that are not really needed.
Another problem that doctors can
discover during a house call is inconti
nence — a condition in which patients
cannot control their bladders. Although
incontinence affects up to 30 percent of
the elderly, it is often difficult to detect
because patients are unwilling or
embarrassed to mention it.
To counter the patients' reticence,
the geriatricians explicitly offer evalua
tion and treatment for incontinence.
Once doctors have obtained an over
all picture of their patients' lifestyles,
they can create a care plan for each
patient, often with the help of the
patients' support system — friends, rel
atives and neighbors.
The program staff provides consulta
tion and advice about which services are
best suited to the patient. These services
include home care programs, nursing
homes, visiting nurses, therapists, dieti
tians and other resources. If necessary, a
social worker is provided for family
counseling, because, as Ferris noted,
"Aging problems can disrupt whole fam
ilies."
The goal of the program, Ferris
emphasized, "is to maintain indepen

dence through preventative measures."
In other words, the idea is to teach
elderly people how to stay both mentally
and physically healthy.
"It improves the overall well-being of
the elderly by focusing on more than
their medical problems. It also allows
doctors to work with other health care
professionals to offer the best of every
thing — in this way we can coordinate
care for the elderly," Ferris continued.
Compared to the advantages, the dis
advantages of the program are small.
Doctors lack the time to make house
calls to all elderly patients and can only
visit those people who can't bring them
selves to the hospital. Additionally, mak
ing house calls consumes more time,
effort and money than treating patients
in a hospital.
However, the program intends to pre
vent the additional costs of complica
tions that arise when patients are
unaware of health risks in their homes
and lifestyles.
Stanford Senior Care could poten
tially improve doctors' ability to help
patients prevent many of the medical
problems that face elderly people.
"We would like to continue [the pro
gram] on a larger scale — to combine
services and provide good communica
tion," Ferris stated.
Hopefully, the Senior Care house vis
its will provide the elderly — who, as
they grow older, require increasing
amounts of medical attention — with
the reassuring care that a hospital can
not.
"This is an idea whose time has come.
America is aging and there are more
frail people who need special care."

make house calls to provide much needed medical attention to those elderly people
who are either unable to bring themselves to a hospital or intimidated by formidable
hospital settings. In addition to diagnosing their patients' medical problems, the pro

elderly.

all picture of their patients' lifestyles,
they can create a care plan for each
patient, often with the help of the
patients' support system — friends, rel
atives and neighbors.
The program staff provides consulta
tion and advice about which services are
best suited to the patient. These services
include home care programs, nursing
homes, visiting nurses, therapists, dieti
tians and other resources. If necessary, a
social worker is provided for family
counseling, because, as Ferris noted,
"Aging problems can disrupt whole fam
ilies."
The goal of the program, Ferris
emphasized, "is to maintain indepen

dence through preventative measures."
In other words, the idea is to teach
elderly people how to stay both mentally
and physically healthy.
"It improves the overall well-being of
the elderly by focusing on more than
their medical problems. It also allows
doctors to work with other health care
professionals to offer the best of every
thing — in this way we can coordinate
care for the elderly," Ferris continued.
Compared to the advantages, the dis
advantages of the program are small.
Doctors lack the time to make house
calls to all elderly patients and can only
visit those people who can't bring them
selves to the hospital. Additionally, mak
ing house calls consumes more time,
effort and money than treating patients
in a hospital.
However, the program intends to pre
vent the additional costs of complica
tions that arise when patients are
unaware of health risks in their homes
and lifestyles.
Stanford Senior Care could poten
tially improve doctors' ability to help
patients prevent many of the medical
problems that face elderly people.
"We would like to continue [the pro
gram] on a larger scale — to combine
services and provide good communica
tion," Ferris stated.
Hopefully, the Senior Care house vis
its will provide the elderly — who, as
they grow older, require increasing
amounts of medical attention — with
the reassuring care that a hospital can
not.
"This is an idea whose time has come.
America is aging and there are more
frail people who need special care."

Geriatrician Dr. Ann Ferris of the Stanford Senior Care Program examines patient Her
man Zukowsky during a visit to his home in Mountain View. Senior Care geriatricians
make house calls to provide much needed medical attention to those elderly people
who are either unable to bring themselves to a hospital or intimidated by formidable
hospital settings. In addition to diagnosing their patients' medical problems, the pro
gram's physicians provide advice about health issues that specifically affect the
elderly.
