## Rain-drenched baseball to play against slumping Spartans 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
The drought-watchers have paused long enough
in their rain dance to allow the top-ranked Stanford
baseball team to squeeze in a midweek game at
Sunken Diamond.
Although the Cardinal has had four of its last five
games canceled or re-scheduled due to the recent
resurgence of winter, the boys of spring will return
to action today at 2 p.m. against San Jose State. The
non-conference game is, of course, weather permit
ting.
The Spartans were 42-17 a year ago, including
two one-run losses to Stanford, but have lost the
offensive sizzle in 1991. Outfielder Matt Nuez (.279)
leads a helium-hitting San Jose attack that is averag
ing just .242 at the plate.
Pitcher Mark Ringkamp (3-1, 1.08 earned run
average) is the only starter left on a pitching staff
depleted by injuries. And the Spartans haven't
played a game since Feb. 26, when they lost to UC-
Davis 9-6.
"San Jose's record isn't all that impressive, and
they've had a couple of iryuries, but I expect a good
ball game," said Cardinal skipper Mark Marquess.
Although the storms washed out two games in
Stanford's Pacific 10 Conference weekend series
with Arizona, Stanford was able to maintain the top
spot in both the Collegiate Baseball and Baseball
America polls as a result of a 4-3 extra-inning victory
over the Wildcats Saturday.

"We'd rather play now because it might be
tougher later, but what the heck, there is nothing
you can really do about it," said Marquess, lament
ing the lost practice time and condensed schedule
later in the year.
Stanford will complete the Arizona series with a
noon doubleheader on Monday, April 22. That means
both Stanford and Arizona will be playing five games
in four days. Before the makeup game, Stanford will
host UCLA in a three-game series while Arizona will
visit California.
"They will only have 22 players, and we'll have
25, but by then some things could change. There
may be iryuries, or some of their younger pitchers
may develop," said Marquess of the future Arizona
series.
The rain-outs have forced other schedule changes
as well. On March 27, Stanford will play a 1 p.m.
game at UC-Davis to replace a game scheduled for
April 22. On May 1, Stanford will play at San Jose's
Municipal Stadium at 5 p.m., and on May 15, Stan
ford will travel to Sacramento State for a 6:30 game
against the Hornets.
But the rain has meant more than a scheduling
headache for the Stanford front office and a fusilade
of stories proclaiming "the drought is not a myth."
Sophomore right-handed pitcher Brian Sackinsky
will return to the mound today in his first appear
ance since recovering from tendinitis in his pitching
arm. The scheduling changes mean Sackinsky will
have more games to contribute.
"He's throwing with no pain and that's good
news," said Marquess. "He's been throwing a lot on
the side — it's just a matter of game experience
now."
Marquess said Sackinsky will only pitch one
inning in his first outing, joining Willie Adams,
Jamie Sepeda, and Scott Weiss in a pluralist pitching
effort against the Spartans. Adams s Sepeda and
Weiss haven't pitched since the Feb. 22-24 sweep of
Arizona State.
