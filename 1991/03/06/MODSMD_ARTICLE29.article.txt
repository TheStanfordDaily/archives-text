# Football players give scrums and rucks a tryâ€”and have a blast
## 
### 
Football is said to be the king of col
lege athletics. There's tradition,
television exposure, the AP poll
and, of course, the lure of big money.
But four Stanford football players are
finding scrums and tries to be just as
exciting as first downs and field goals.
Rugby may not be a household word in
America, but J.J. Lasley, Chuck Robinson,
Mark Hanson and Kevin Mescher have all
made it the first word in their athletic
vocabularies this quarter.
All four joined rugby, a club sport, at
the close of football season. All are now
tackling and mauling for Stanford's first
team. And they're headed for the West
Coast playoffs.
Football may be. their ticket to the
Farm, but rugby is just plain fun.
"Its 80 minutes with no time outs, no
water breaks. You get to kick, throw
elbows and stomp on people. It's primi
tive, but it's technical," Robinson said. "I
barely understand the rules. I'm just hav
ing fun."
To them rugby is what college sports
are all about.
No pressure, no politics, no game
films, no rankings.

It doesn't matter who you were in high
school, or how highly you were recruited.
There's no animosity over playing time,
and you don't have to kiss up to the
coaches.
It's not a business. The coach isn't
worried about being fired if he doesn't
have a winning record. The players aren't
worried about being benched if they miss
a tackle.
The athletic department isn't obsessed
with getting on T.V And the athletes
aren't obsessed with their personal stats
for the draft.
"In high school you had fun playing
football," Robinson said. "[But then] you
get looked at, then recruited, and by col
lege it's not fun anymore. It's a business

and everybody does their best to fit into
the system.
"Rugby is something I really enjoy."
Collegiate rugby is sport for the sake of
sport. Fifteen guys running around a
field, tackling and hitting each other, try
ing to get the ball into their try-zone. No
stats are kept. Only the team matters.
It's what college football may have
been.
"It's like the old [football] movies.
'Win one for the Gipper,' 'Go team!'
Lasley said. "Now football is such a busi
ness. Rugby reminds me of what football
should be like."
They also like the athleticism involved.
While football requires tremendous abil
ity and continuous preparation, the
action stops after every play. There are
time outs to rest players and discuss game
plans. You can substitute people. Then
put them back in again.
Once you start a half of a rugby game,
there's no halt in the action. It's 40 con
tinuous minutes of trying to score, or pre
venting the other team from doing so.
When the ball hits the ground, the first
person to pick it up gets it. Then takes off.
"The game requires more physical and

mental toughness because you're run
ning at full speed and tackling for 80 min
utes," Robinson said. "And without any
pads it hurts when you get hit. It really
separates the men from the boys."
Stanford's newest rugby aficionados
are also amazed at how often they,
or any player, gets to join the action.
There are positions. But except when
you're in a scrum, they really don't mat
ter. Everyone can tackle. Everyone can
score.
After 15 years of playing specific roles,
of only tackling, only running, or only
catching the ball, the football players are
oveijoyed at the opportunities in rugby
games.
"Anybody on the field can get the ball,
kick the ball or score. That's what I like
the most," Robinson explained. "It's not
structured, like football, where only four
or five guys can get the ball if it's a pass.
"I hadn't run with the ball since high
school. I almost forgot what it was like."
And everybody gets to play. It doesn't
matter if you're a walk-on or the nation's
No. 1 recruit. How you competed in
spring ball isn't considered.

A new coach can't pick "his" players,
and leave the previous coaches' guys
warming the bench.
When it comes time to choosing a
lineup, it's comes down to how dedicated
a player is, how he fits in with the rest of
the team.
And if there isn't room on the first
team, he can play for the second or third
squads. Benches don't exist.
Rugby is 80 minutes of running the
ball through mauling defenders. And
practice is just more of the same.
Add the running back experience to an
hour-plus of constant motion, and Lasley
is getting excited about the upcoming
football season.
"I usually don't get to simulate what
it's like to try to carry the ball with people
hitting me," Lasley said. "In rugby every
time I get the ball they try to get me. It's
making me a better running back, and
I'm getting in tremendous shape."
But despite it's advantages, rugby isn't
a substitute for football, just a comple
ment.
"I've grown up loving football. It's a
way of life," Lasley said.
Rugby is just fun.
