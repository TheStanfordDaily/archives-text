# Auditor threatens criminal referral
## Federal official says access to key indirect-cost documents impeded 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
A federal auditor, frustrated by his
staff's difficulties in gaining access to
some of Stanford's indirect-cost docu
ments, has given University President
Donald Kennedy an ultimatum â€” pro
vide better access or answer to the
Department of Justice.
In a March 4 letter obtained by The
Daily, Joseph Riden, the local branch
manager of the Defense Contract
Audit Agency, threatens to seek crimi
nal charges against University officials
if the situation doesn't improve.
"Should you not rectify the impedi
ments [the agency] is experiencing and
take action to assure they do not reoc
cur, I plan to bring this matter to the
attention of the Department of Justice
for their determination as to whether
to open a criminal investigation,"
Riden says.
The Defense Contract Audit Agency

is the federal agency responsible for
auditing Stanford's indirect-cost
claims. At the request of the Office of
Naval Research and Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich., the audit agency has recently
stepped up its efforts to determine how
fairly Stanford has charged the gov
ernment during the last decade for
indirect costs of research.
The House Subcommittee on Over
sight and Investigations, chaired by
Dingell, and the Office of Naval
Research are currently investigating
Stanford's indirect cost policies. Fed
eral probes into the matter have also
been launched by the Naval Investiga
tive Service and the General Account
ing Office.
Stanford officials said last night
that the University has been doing
everything possible to respond to the
requests of all auditors and investiga
tors in a timely fashion. "We are mak
ing every attempt to make everybody
in the government happy," said Stan

ford spokesperson Richard Kurovsky.
Since October, when the first inves
tigations were launched, Stanford has
received about 3,500 inquiries from
auditors, Kurovsky said.
Riden's letter was apparently
prompted in part by a new policy for
responding to audit requests put in
place by Stanford in mid-January.
Under the policy, government auditors
are told to direct all their inquiries to
one of three officials in the Con
troller's Office. The requests for infor
mation are then tracked on a computer
database.
The policy, Kurovsky said last night,
was prompted by "a traffic jam of audi
tors" seelting information for the vari
ous federal investigations. By central
izing auditors' requests, Stanford was
trying to provide better service, he
added.
But the strategy may have back
fired. "The procedure is not working
well," Riden writes in his March 4 let

ter to Kennedy. "There have been
extensive delays in our receiving data,
caused by the Controller's screening
process."
Furthermore, according to Riden,
under law, the audit agency expects
full access to all Stanford employees.
In a Feb. 28 letter to Kennedy, Riden
cites a failure to gain immediate access
to utility records kept by Operations
and Maintenance employees as a
"prime example" of Stanford's "unco
operativeness and obstructiveness."
University Counsel Debra Zumwalt
responded in a letter Monday to con
cerns raised by Riden in his Feb. 28 let
ter. "It is inevitable that miscommuni
cations, delays and inconveniences will
take place when so many different
agencies are making simultaneous
requests for the same materials from
the same individuals within Stanford,"
she says.
According to Zumwalt, Stan
ford is willing "to identify any
such problem areas and resolve
them in a positive manner."
Riden's letter threatening crimi
nal charges is dated the same day
as Zumwalt's response to his pre
vious letter.
Stanford officials expressed
surprise last night that Riden did
not wait any longer for Stanford's

response to his Feb. 28 letter. Feb.
28 was a Thursday; his latest let
ter was dated the following Mon
day.
According to Riden, Stanford
may be violating a new section of
a federal law that makes it a
crime to obstruct federal audits.
The law, which carries a maxi
mum sentence of five years in
prison and possible fines, is part
of a larger drug-enforcement
statute, but Riden says he
believes it can be used against
Stanford.
In an interview yesterday, Paul

Biddle, the campus representa
tive of the Office of Naval
Research, said federal auditors
have been plagued by access prob
lems at Stanford for years.
"The history of access-to
records problems at Stanford has
been a recurring one" since the
early 1980s, Biddle said.
Kurovsky declined to comment
on Biddle's assertion.
Congressional investigators
said yesterday that they were
extremely troubled by the access
problems pointed out by Riden.
"This seems terribly inconsistent

with Don Kennedy's affirmation
that he's committed to getting to
the bottom of the problem," said
one staff member of the Over
sight and Investigations subcom
mittee, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
The staff member predicted
Dingell and other subcommittee
members would voice serious con
cerns about the matter at a hear
ing on Stanford's indirect cost
policies next Wednesday.
Kennedy, who is in Washing
ton, D.C., was unavailable for
comment last night.
