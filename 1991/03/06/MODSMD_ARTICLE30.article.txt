# Men's tennis takes on Mountaineers
## 
### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
West Virginia probably
scheduled an early March West
Coast tour for good competi
tion, sunny skies and warm
temperatures.
One out of three ain't bad.
The Mountaineers are not
going to get the balmy Califor
nia weather they had hoped for,
but there will be competitive
tennis awaiting when they
step on the courts of the Stan
ford Tennis Stadium this after
noon. Back from a successful
weekend of doubles action,
including the tournament
crown, previously top-ranked
Stanford will provide West Vir
ginia with a tough team chal
lenge.
Stanford, for their part, is
just happy to get in some more
action before competition is
halted for dead week and
finals.
"We really need work in sin
gles and doubles," coach Dick
Gould said. "We'll just try to
get a good, solid effort in and
get through without any
injuries."
Although No. 1 singles play
er Jonathon Stark returned to
action after a stress fracture
last week, he will take the day
off in preparation for the
upcoming weekend's matches
against Kentucky and Miami.
Junior Alex O'Brien will
continue at the No. 1 singles
spot, with the rest of the lineup
similar to the one Stanford
used at the National Team
Indoors two weeks ago. Dan
Turbow will continue compet
ing at No. 2 doubles, but it is
not solidified whether he will
play with Jared Palmer or

Chris Cocotos.
Gould is also looking for
ward to the match to give
O'Brien, who struggled at the
No. 1 spot at the Indoors tour
nament, a chance to rebound.
"I'm anxious to see how
Alex bounces back after three
straight losses," Gould said. "I
think he's the kind of person
who can mentally do that."
Stanford will use the match
to evaluate the play of the bot
tom half of the singles lineup
— Jason Yee, Vimal Patel and
Michael Flanagan. With
Stark's return, someone will
have to be bounced from the
lineup this weekend, and
today's play will contribute to
that decision.
The Cardinal is still looking
for a No. 3 singles team as well.
Currently Flanagan and
Robert Devens have been com
peting at the slot, but Gould
has not yet solidified the spot.
Leading the Mountaineer's
arsenal is Patric Westoo, a
senior from Sweden who is cur
rently ranked 38th in singles in
the Volvo Intercollegiate list
ings. Ronny Mercer and Mark
Booras are West Virginia's
other returning players, and
the remainder of their lineup
consists of transfer students
and freshmen.
While the match is awaited
for the competition it will pro
vide, the Cardinal is basically
looking at the contest with the
19th-ranked Mountaineers as a
warmup for Friday and Satur
day's contests against Ken
tucky and Miami. Both are top
ten teams, and Stanford was
recently given quite a workout
before it subdued the Hurri
canes 5-2 in the quarters of the
Team Indoors.
