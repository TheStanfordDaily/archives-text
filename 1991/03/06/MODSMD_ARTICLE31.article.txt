While the top five players rested, the second
five members of the Stanford men's golf team
were looking mainly for some experience, and
anything else would have been a nice bonus.

Arbor Day present all wrapped up in one.

solidified him as one of our top six players,"
Coach Wally Goodwin said.

The Stanford team, after being rained out

and host their own Stanford Invitational and
the Pac-10's here.
