# Gridiron stars face off in track meet
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Staff writer 
Stanford tailback Glyn Mil
burn and San Jose State running
back Sheldon Canley met in a
press conference yesterday to dis
cuss their upcoming showdown.
However, this time it won't be
on a gridiron but on a track. The
football 40 is a race conceived by
Cardinal track coach Brooks
Johnson to pit top NCAA running
backs in a 40 yard dash. The con
test is a marquee event in the Diet
Pepsi Track Challenge that will be
held at Stanford Stadium, March
28-30.
Milburn is excited about the
race and views it as a chance "to
get a little revenge" for the
pigskin loss to the Spartans in the
fall.
Canley has his own reason for
wanting revenge. Milburn edged
him out for the nation's top all
purpose yard total. The San Jose
State senior also hopes his time in
the 40 will impress pro scouts.
"It's not a 100 (meter). If it
was, I'd probably back out," Can
ley joked as Cardinal football
coach Denny Green added, "Yeaii,
that takes real track legs."

Both Canley and Milburn have
had previous track experience.
Milburn currently runs sprints
and sprint relays. In high school
he ran the 100, 200, four by 100
relay and mile relay.
"Sometimes they made me run
the 400," Milburn said with a
smile; "We only had about four
people on our track team."
Canley raced a lot in high
school and junior college. He does
not run at San Jose State because
they do not have a track program.
Like Milburn, he was a sprinter,
but he also did triple jump and
long jump.
The football 40 will cap three
days of stellar competition. Michi
gan, Indiana and Ohio State will
face Stanford, Oregon and Wash
ington State in several Pacific 10
Conference â€” Big Ten Conference
showdowns. Texas, Arkansas and
Tennessee are also sending teams
to compete in invitational events.
The Track Challenge will also
showcase some of the best high
school athletes in the nation in
the biggest high school meet west
of the Mississippi this year. The
Challenge is going to be televised
nationally by Pacific Sports Net
work.
