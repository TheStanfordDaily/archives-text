# Ruggers tackle Cal
## 
### Michelle Ghert Staff writer 
The Stanford ruggers over
came wind and rain to better
their record to 7-1 by defeating
St. Maiy's 23-19 last Saturday.
The victory was the fifth
straight for the second-place
Cardinal and set up a show
down for first place in the sea
son finale against Cal (8-0) this
Saturday at Maloney Field.
The contest looked like it
would be an easy victory as
tries by J.J. Lasley and Glenn
Jones gave the Cardinal an
early 10-0 lead. Three kicks
increased the lead to 19-0 with
ten minutes left in the first
half, and it appeared that Stan
ford could begin to look to this
week's showdown with Cal.
Apparently, that is exactly
what happened, as St. Mary's
took advantage of some con
centration lapses to score ten
straight points to make it a
respectable game by halftime.
The second half saw Stan
ford trapped deep in its own
end by a revitalized opponent
and a stiff wind, which made
clearance kicks almost impossi
ble. It was a beautiful try by

Glenn Flores, mid-way
through the second half, that
pushed the game out of St.
Mary'B reach at 23-10. The
Cardinal defense then took
over, and the team held on.
Although the win clinched a
playoff berth for the Cardinal,
that was the last thing on the
minds of the rugby team.
It has been nine years since
Stanford has defeated Califor
nia, and last year's 35-0
trouncing at Cal ruined a per
fect season for the Cardinal.
"Last year's loss really
hurt," said team captain Simon
Fleming-Wood, "because it was
the first time in nearly a decade
that we fielded a team capable
of beating Cal. We had counted
on being more hungry, but on
that day they wanted it more."
Ed Stevens, the vice captain,
does not foresee the same fate
for the Cardinal this year. "We
know Cal is better than they
were last year, but they are
essentially the same team," he
points out. "We are a very dif
ferent team, though. We are
bigger, faster and stronger, and
we plan on tackling them so
hard that they don't know
what hit them.U
