# Public service prof. to speak at graduation
## 
### Howard Libit Staff writer 
John Gardner, the Haas Centennial Professor of
Public Service and a Stanford graduate, will be this
year's commencement speaker, University officials

announced yesterday.
Gardner's "extraordinary record
of service as a teacher, foundation
leader, secretary of Health, Educa
tion and Welfare and founder of
Common Cause is an inspiration to
all of us," University President Don
ald Kennedy said in a statement.
"It is a special source of pride
that for this most important of fam
ily affairs, we can produce a distin-

guished speaker who is also a family member," said
Kennedy.
In 1970, Gardner, 78, founded Common Cause, a
prominent citizen's watchdog organization intended
to try to hold the federal government accountable for
its actions. The organization was instrumental in
reforming presidential campaign funding rules after
the Watergate scandal.
He served as secretary of Health, Education and
Welfare for President Lyndon Johnson during the
"Great Society" years of 1965 to 1968. Under Gard
ner, the department began the Medicare program
and played an important role in enforcing the Civil
Rights Act.
Gardner could not be reached for comment yes
terday. This year's commencement will be the second
time Gardner has spoken at a Stanford graduation
ceremony. He also spoke to seniors in 1959.
This year's June 16 commencement ceremony
will honor Stanford's 100 th graduating class, and as
a result, one of the objectives of the selection com
mittee was to find a representative of the Stanford
community, said Elizabeth Lambird, one of the
Senior Class Presidents and a member of the com
mittee.
Lambird and other committee members commit
tee lauded Gardner and his accomplishments.
Gardner is a "nationally, if not internationally,
renowned scholar on leadership and public service in


Gardner
communities, which are two
issues that are particularly
important to graduating seniors.
He will extend an important mes
sage to seniors, parents and
alumni," Lambird said.
As another reason for his selec
tion, Kennedy said, "His present
work is focused on values espe
cially important to Stanford: lead
ership and community."
Sandi Risser, associate director
of the Centennial Celebration,
said, "John Gardner will add
excitement and present the
appropriate messages at the Cen
tennial ceremony."
However, some seniors criti
cized the selection committee for
choosing a speaker who lacks
instant name recognition.
Students similarly criticized
the choice of last year's speaker,
Marian Wright Edelman, founder
and president of the Children's
Defense Fund, and 1988 speaker
Robert Maynard, editor and pres
ident of the Oakland Tribune.
"I am surprised that they went
for 'one of our own' because they
usually attract someone outside
of the University," said John
Fieldman. "Not to minimize the
importance of this person, but I
was under the impression that
with the Centennial they would

go for some monster name."
"I am disappointed," said
Susan Fry. "I thought that they
would get a woman for Stanford's
100 th graduation."
Members of the selection com
mittee defended their choice.
"Name recognition is a prob
lem a lot of years. Unless you
choose a TV celebrity or movie
star not everyone on campus will
have heard of them," Lambird
said.
"Once people read his creden
tials, they will see that Gardner
will be a really great speaker. I
think that people will be pleased,"
she said.
"I really do not think that
name recognition will be a prob
lem," said Marlene Wine, special
assistant to Kennedy "Gardner is
well-known to students through
his work at the [Haas Public Ser
vice Center]."
Yesterday's announcement
had to be delayed much longer
than in most years for several rea
sons, Wine said.
"Part of the delay was because
it was the 100 th graduation and
we spent a lot of time discussing
possible speakers," Wine said.
"Kennedy was also traveling a lot
more this year ... and was not as
available."
Gardner, who earned his bach
elor's and master's degrees at
Stanford and a Ph.D. at UC-
Berkeley, returned to Stanford in
1989.
