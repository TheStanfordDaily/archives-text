### Howard Libit Staff writer 
John Gardner, the Haas Centennial Professor of
Public Service and a Stanford graduate, will be this
year's commencement speaker, University officials

announced yesterday.
Gardner's "extraordinary record
of service as a teacher, foundation
leader, secretary of Health, Educa
tion and Welfare and founder of
Common Cause is an inspiration to
all of us," University President Don
ald Kennedy said in a statement.
"It is a special source of pride
that for this most important of fam
ily affairs, we can produce a distin-

guished speaker who is also a family member," said
Kennedy.
In 1970, Gardner, 78, founded Common Cause, a
prominent citizen's watchdog organization intended
to try to hold the federal government accountable for
its actions. The organization was instrumental in
reforming presidential campaign funding rules after
the Watergate scandal.
He served as secretary of Health, Education and
Welfare for President Lyndon Johnson during the
"Great Society" years of 1965 to 1968. Under Gard
ner, the department began the Medicare program
and played an important role in enforcing the Civil
Rights Act.
Gardner could not be reached for comment yes
terday. This year's commencement will be the second
time Gardner has spoken at a Stanford graduation
ceremony. He also spoke to seniors in 1959.
This year's June 16 commencement ceremony
will honor Stanford's 100 th graduating class, and as
a result, one of the objectives of the selection com
mittee was to find a representative of the Stanford
community, said Elizabeth Lambird, one of the
Senior Class Presidents and a member of the com
mittee.
Lambird and other committee members commit
tee lauded Gardner and his accomplishments.
Gardner is a "nationally, if not internationally,
renowned scholar on leadership and public service in
