The opening of the new Lucille
Salter Packard Children's Hospital
next month will be celebrated with
ceremonies featuring First Lady Bar
bara Bush and Gov. Pete Wilson.
The new facility will also consoli
date the Department of Pediatrics and
the functions of the old Children's
Hospital.
Bush will be the guest of honor in a
gala dinner to be held on April 13 to
benefit the new facility.
The first lady has a special interest
in the treatment of children since she

lost her own daughter, Robin, to
leukemia, said Cheryl Oliver, assistant
director of community affairs at the
hospital.
The inaugural ceremony on April
14 is expected to have 15,000 guests
and will feature Gov. Pete Wilson as a
speaker, Oliver said.
The new building was also designed
to bring the Children's Hospital closer
to the Stanford Hospital, where diag
nostic and laboratory services are per
formed.
The directors of Children's Hospi
tal and the Pediatrics Department
agreed to consolidate the services in
1982, and the Packard foundation

donated $40 million to fund the pro
ject in 1986. An additional $20 million
was raised in a matching-capital cam
paign fund led by Stanford University
Medical Development.
The Lucille Packard Hospital will
continue the Children's Hospital pol
icy of treating every child who needs
care, regardless of ability to pay, said
Diarmuid McGuire, director of com
munity and government affairs. This
policy has become increasingly diffi
cult to uphold without strong commu
nity support, he said.
