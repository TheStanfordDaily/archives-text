The opening of the new Lucille
Salter Packard Children's Hospital
next month will be celebrated with
ceremonies featuring First Lady Bar
bara Bush and Gov. Pete Wilson.
The new facility will also consoli
date the Department of Pediatrics and
the functions of the old Children's
Hospital.
Bush will be the guest of honor in a
gala dinner to be held on April 13 to
benefit the new facility.
The first lady has a special interest
in the treatment of children since she

lost her own daughter, Robin, to
leukemia, said Cheryl Oliver, assistant
director of community affairs at the
hospital.
The inaugural ceremony on April
14 is expected to have 15,000 guests
and will feature Gov. Pete Wilson as a
speaker, Oliver said.
The new building was also designed
to bring the Children's Hospital closer
to the Stanford Hospital, where diag
nostic and laboratory services are per
formed.
The directors of Children's Hospi
tal and the Pediatrics Department
agreed to consolidate the services in
1982, and the Packard foundation

donated $40 million to fund the pro
ject in 1986. An additional $20 million
was raised in a matching-capital cam
paign fund led by Stanford University
Medical Development.
The Lucille Packard Hospital will
continue the Children's Hospital pol
icy of treating every child who needs
care, regardless of ability to pay, said
Diarmuid McGuire, director of com
munity and government affairs. This
policy has become increasingly diffi
cult to uphold without strong commu
nity support, he said.
Other than its physical location and

use of Medical School faculty, the
Children's Hospital is not affili
ated with Stanford. It operates as
an independent, non-profit insti
tution, specializing in treating
children with long-term illnesses
like cystic fibrosis and cancer.
The new facilities, located next
to the shopping center on Welch
Road, will have a physical envi
ronment specially designed for
children. Gardens and terraces
will surround the structure. Each
of the 143 single-occupancy
rooms will have a large window.
This arrangement is a big
change from the current "obso
lete" facilities that are darker and
do not have as many single rooms,
McGuire said.
"We think it will be the most
attractive children's hospital
facility in the world," he said.
A few of the patients who have
been treated in the old hospital

for many years, however, are
more apprehensive about the
move.
The new hospital is "going to
be more institutionalized, incor
porating other nurses that are
not familiar with this setup," said
Jennifer Ortman, 19, who started
her treatment for cystic fibrosis
when she was 10.
But coordinators are striving
to retain the home-like atmo
sphere of the current hospital at
the new place, said Mary Ann
Clancy, assistant director of indi
vidual programs at the hospital.
Founded in 1919 as a convales
cent home for children in San
Francisco, the hospital initially
occupied a wing of the Stanford
family mansion. It was used to
treat diseases like rheumatic
fever, malnutrition and tubercu
losis, McGuire said.
The hospital's affiliation with
the Medical School ensured that
scientific breakthroughs could
benefit children immediately,
McGuire said.
