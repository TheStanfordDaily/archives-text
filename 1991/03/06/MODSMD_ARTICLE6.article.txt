# Advanced computer systems will bring improvements, kill Macbeth
## 
### Jason Bloomstein Senior staff writer 
After cautiously examining other schools' com
puter use, Academic Information Resources is now
finalizing the transition from mainframes to work
stations, meaning more power for Stanford's com
puter users — and new costs and headaches for AIR.
The retirement this June of Macbeth — the last of
the four mainframe computers used since the mid
1980s — will mark a trend away from time sharing
and toward distributed computing.
The mainframes were named after each of Shake
speare's great tragedies — Macbeth, Hamlet, Othello
and Lear.
Under both time sharing and distributed comput
ing, all files are stored on a central computer so users
can work from any remote terminal. But with time
sharing, all application programs, such as compilers
and spreadsheets, are also stored on one mainframe
and are shared by all users.
Distributed programming places copies of soft

ware applications on powerful remote terminals
called workstations, that — like personal computers
— allow users to access their own copy of software.
This substantially speeds up computing because
all users don't share one program. Personal files can
still be accessed from any available workstation on
campus or — by logging into a remote network —
across the nation.
In addition, workstations support more "friendly"
environments, including the use of windows, graph
ics and icons in programs.
For the large number of students who use Mac
beth exclusively to communicate via electronic mail,
the loss of the mainframe will force them to switch
machines.
AIR provides two alternatives: getting an account
on an existing mainframe running the widely used
but complicated operating system UNIX, which
Gorin recommends serious computer enthusiasts
choose. Another possibility is using "Pop server," a
Macintosh-based system dedi
cated solely to electronic mail
exchange.
Although distributed program
ming first established itself as a
popular technology around 1987,
AIR decided to wait for other
places to experiment with the
technology before joining the
trend. AIR was encouraged by
success stories at Stanford's
Computer Science and Electrical
Engineering Departments and at
Carnegie-Mellon University and
MIT, schools "which make it their
business to experiment in new
technology," said Ralph Gorin,
AlR's director.

"AIR is a service organization.
We need to deliver services to
clients," said employee Rich
Alderson. "When experimenting
with new technology, it's harder
to guarantee a level of service."
AIR has also cautiously bought
hardware and software from a
variety of suppliers, including
Sun Microsystems, Next Inc. and
Digital Equipment Corporation,
"so we don't get tied into a pricing
structure and into certain ver
sions of software," Alderson said.
Gorin could not give an exact
figure for the cost of the transi
tion.
Because software applications
are distributed among the various
workstation terminals, AIR must
now buy one copy of an applica
tion for every terminal, as
opposed to buying only one for a

mainframe.
"The real cost is buying soft
ware," Gorin said. "Sometimes
we can achieve an economy of
scale, but sometimes we have to
grit our teeth" and buy several
copies.
The most popular workstation
on campus is the Sparc, largely
because of a grant from its cre
ator, Mountain View-based Sun,
and because of its power. One
Sparc station is more powerful
than the mainframe Macbeth, the
last of the four "tragedies" to be
removed.
Macbeth has lasted longer
than the other three — which
were built by Digital — because it
was built by Systems Concepts
and was two to five times faster.
The transition to workstations
will involve a lot of headaches,

Gorin said. The introduction of a
new technology, even one as
advanced as workstations,
inevitably involves grappling with
new and unexpected problems,
both by AIR staff and by student
and faculty users, he said.
Robert Merithew, a consultant
for AIR for the past few years,
said he has seen an increase in
requests for help since the work
stations replaced the mainframes.
Alderson said workstation
companies are eager for students
to use the new technology
because the prices have come
done so much recently that it is
conceivable for students to pur
chase their own.
The Next computer — which
when originally introduced was
priced at around $8,000 — is now
advertised for nearly $3,200.
