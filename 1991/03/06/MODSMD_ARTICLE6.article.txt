# Advanced computer systems will bring improvements, kill Macbeth

After cautiously examining other schools' com
puter use, Academic Information Resources is now
finalizing the transition from mainframes to work
stations, meaning more power for Stanford's com
puter users — and new costs and headaches for AIR.
The retirement this June of Macbeth — the last of
the four mainframe computers used since the mid
1980s — will mark a trend away from time sharing
and toward distributed computing.
The mainframes were named after each of Shake
speare's great tragedies — Macbeth, Hamlet, Othello
and Lear.
Under both time sharing and distributed comput
ing, all files are stored on a central computer so users
can work from any remote terminal. But with time
sharing, all application programs, such as compilers
and spreadsheets, are also stored on one mainframe
and are shared by all users.
Distributed programming places copies of soft

ware applications on powerful remote terminals
called workstations, that — like personal computers
— allow users to access their own copy of software.
This substantially speeds up computing because
all users don't share one program. Personal files can
still be accessed from any available workstation on
campus or — by logging into a remote network —
across the nation.
In addition, workstations support more "friendly"
environments, including the use of windows, graph
ics and icons in programs.
For the large number of students who use Mac
beth exclusively to communicate via electronic mail,
the loss of the mainframe will force them to switch
machines.
AIR provides two alternatives: getting an account
on an existing mainframe running the widely used
but complicated operating system UNIX, which
Gorin recommends serious computer enthusiasts
choose. Another possibility is using "Pop server," a
