# Carson: King borrowed ideas for famous speech
## 
### Scott McCormack 
Ideas in Martin Luther King
Jr.'s renowned "I Have a
Dream" speech were not en
tirely original, according to the
editor of the King Papers Pro
ject.
Clayborne Carson, project
editor and Stanford history
professor, told about a dozen
students in Arroyo lounge last
night that with "every sen
tence in the speech ... we can
identify the sources."
"You can determine the
sources for all of the ideas in
there," Carson added, "but you
can't say that he took it verba-

Tim from any particular
source."
The papers project, founded
in 1985, is currently studying
the speech and King's other
works while compiling a three
volume definitive look at
King's life.
After the dorm presenta
tion, Carson declined to com
ment further, saying he is not
in the business of publishing
research through the press.
He also said any serious
King scholar is aware that
King borrowed ideas for the"I
Have a Dream" speech. It is
"not a secret. It's really not that
unknown" that King used other
people's work, he added.
Carson noted that an upcom
ing book due to be released this
summer by Keith Miller of the
University of Arizona deals with
the very question of sources in
King's "I Have a Dream" and
other speeches.
Last November, Carson
revealed that some of King's aca
demic papers — including his
1955 doctoral dissertation — con
tained passages "similar or identi
cal to the information presented
in other people's writings."
With regard to the academic
questions, the project staff had
been aware of the plagiarism for
three years before its publication
in the media but kept it secret to
investigate it further.
Carson stressed, however, that
concerns about the"I Have a
Dream" speech do not amount to
plagiarism and must be viewed in
the greater context of the late
civil rights leader's work.
The ultimate importance, he
said, is "what [King] chose to pull
together," not where he got it
from. Carson called King's work a
mosaic. "He just wasn't an origi
nal thinker, but was able to mine

the sources for the nuggets of
cogency that fit his purpose."
King delivered the landmark
speech Aug. 28, 1963 during a
march on Washington, D.C., call
ing for equal civil rights for blacks.
In the speech, he said, "I have a
dream that this nation will rise up
and live out the true meaning of
its creed, 'We hold these truths to
be self-evident: that all men are
created equal.. .
Last night's informal discus
sion, titled "The Historical Roots
of Martin Luther King Jr.,"
focused on the research project's
primary discoveries over the last
two years. All of King's works,
Carson said, "can be seen as
attempts to synthesize what he
has learned from readings and
academics with the ideas that he
has inherited from black Baptist
tradition."
The audience listened to
excerpts from recordings of two
sermons highlighting King's
inner struggle for unity in his
beliefs.
The social gospel helps explain
why King borrowed from other
people's work so freely, Carson
said. There was an understanding
between preachers, he said, that a
person "could borrow passages,
could borrow ideas, but not an
entire sermon. That's the line
[King drew]," he added.
Carson also said the question
of King's sources is just "not an
important enough issue" to war
rant publication yet. He added the
papers project is simply not pre
pared to deal with questions con
cerning the speech at this time.
