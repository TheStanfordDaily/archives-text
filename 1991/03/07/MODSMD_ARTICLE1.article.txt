# BEYOND THE WAR
## Bush proclaims end to war, sets sights on peace 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Bush last
night proclaimed a triumphant end to the Per
sian Gulf war and set his sights on a broader
peace. "The time has come to put an end to
Arab-Israeli conflict," he said, urging compro
mise in the troubled Middle East.
A hero's welcome greeted Bush on Capitol
Hill, exactly one week after he announced a
conditional cease fire in the 42-day conflict.
"As commander in chief," Bush said to a
cheering House chamber, "I can report to you:
our armed forces fought with honor and valor.
As president, I can report to the nation: aggression is
defeated. The war is over."
Bush said he would seize the moment to "close
the gap between Israel and the Arab states, and
between Israelis and Palestinians." Secretary of
State James Baker 111 flies to Saudi Arabia this
morning for the first round of diplomacy.
With Saddam Hussein's army driven out of
Kuwait, Bush announced the first large withdrawal
of American troops from the Gulf.
"This is just the beginning of a steady flow of
American troops coming home," Bush told a joint
session of Congress in a nationally broadcast speech.
The last known American prisoners of the Gulf
war flew to freedom yesterday and a heroes' welcome
from Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf. American para
troopers loaded their gear, meanwhile, for their own
"freedom bird" — the flight home.
The first large contingent of U.S. soldiers to head
home — 900 troops of the 24th Mechanized Infantry
Division — were leaving Saudi Arabia early today for
a Washington-area air base. Part of the 82nd Air
borne Division also was to begin its return journey.
"We're coming home now — proud. Confident.
Heads high. There is much that we must do at home
and abroad. And we will do it. We are Americans,"
Bush said, his voice cracking at times with emotion.
"Tonight in Iraq, Saddam walks amidst ruin,"
Bush said. "His war machine is crushed. His ability
to threaten mass destruction is itself destroyed. . . .
For all that Saddam has done to his own people, to
the Kuwaitis and to the entire world, Saddam and
those around him are accountable."
The speech marked a sweet moment of personal
triumph for Bush. Many congressional Democrats
had second-guessed Bush throughout his seven
month showdown with Saddam, urging him not to
go to war and then not to launch a ground offensive.
In welcoming Bush, House Speaker Thomas Foley
bestowed Democratic congratulations on the presi
dent and the troops for their "brilliant victory of the
Desert Storm operation." Bush was interrupted 22
times by applause.
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said
the victory in the Gulf was "President Bush's finest
hour. . . . Thanks to the brilliant leadership of Presi
dent Bush — who had to make the toughest calls of
his life and our times — the war is over."
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-
Maine, said the war has given Bush "enormous pres
tige" to work for a settlement in the Middle East. "I
am pleased the president is seizing the initiative,"
Mitchell said.
Addressing the longstanding dispute between
Israel and its neighbors, Bush said differences were
"so painful and intractable. Yet, in the conflict just
concluded, Israel and many of the Arab states have
for the first time found themselves confronting the
same aggressor.

"By now, it should be plain to all parties that
peacemaking in the Middle East requires compro
mise," the president declared. "We must do all that
we can to close the gap between Israel and the Arab
states, and between Israelis and Palestinians."
A comprehensive peace must be grounded in U.N.
Security Council resolutions calling on Israel to
withdraw from occupied territories and declaring the
right of all nations in the region to live in peace
within secure borders.
He said other challenges still remain after the
war, and he called for:
• Creation of security arrangements to produce a
stable Gulf. He said "our friends and allies in the
Middle East" must take the lead in regional security
but that the United States "stands ready to work
with them to secure the peace."
• Control of the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction and missiles that deliver them. He said it
would be tragic if a new Mideast arms race began.
"Iraq requires special vigilance. . . . Iraq must not

have access to the instruments of war," Bush said.
• The fostering of economic development to bring
prosperity to all people in the Middle East.
Bush said he dispatched Baker "to listen, to
probe, to offer suggestions and to advance the search
for peace and stability.
Turning from the war, Bush said his first priority
is to end the recession and "get this economy rolling
again."
He said the war had a clear-cut objective with an
imperative to achieve results. "We must bring that
same sense of self-discipline, that same sense of
urgency, to the way we meet challenges here at
home," the president said.
He called on lawmakers to enact his proposals
dealing with anti-crime measures, energy, trans
portation and education. He challenged Congress to
put the transportation and crime measures on his
desk within 100 days, bringing minority Republican
congressmen to their feet.
