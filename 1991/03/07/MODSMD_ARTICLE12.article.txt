again in the face, then lashed him with a whip

Venezuelan DC-9 crash kills 43
CARACAS, Venezuela — A Venezuelan
domestic jet carrying 43 people has crashed in
the mountains southwest of Caracas. Authori
ties said yesterday there apparently were no
survivors.
The DC-9 twin-engine Aeropostal jet disap
peared Tuesday afternoon en route to Santa
Barbara from Maracaibo, a distance of about
135 miles. Authorities feared a hijacking
because no trace of the plane had been found
on the route between the oil city of Maracaibo
and Santa Barbara.
Franklin Rodriguez, manager of the Aero
postal in Maracaibo, said a search team was on
its way to the remote Andean region known as
"Paramo Los Torres," about 350 miles south
west of Caracas.
