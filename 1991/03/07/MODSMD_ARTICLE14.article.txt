## Celebrate teaching 
### 
Monetary rewards
will provide incentives
to improve education

THE PACKAGE OF initia
tives earmarked for the
improvement of undergradu
ate teaching at Stanford should
come as music to the ears of all
Stanford students.
Few announcements could be
more welcomed or timely. In the
middle of a year which has been
plagued by financial difficulties
during the final push in the Cen
tennial Campaign, Stanford's reac
tion to any form of monetary dona
tion could only be one of joy and
gratitude.
The teaching initiative, however,
is cause for celebration. By specifi
cally championing undergraduate
teaching both in words and deeds,
Stanford is not only boldly striking
out towards its next century of
higher education but will also be
blazing the trail for all universities
around the country.
The new program properly
acknowledges teaching as an area
of primary concern to the Univer
sity and is exactly what Stanford
needs.
It is essential to recognize good
teachers. The result will not only
be an increase in the quality of edu
cation provided to the students but
it will also be a boon for the Uni
versity as a whole.
Placing more emphasis on
teaching will attract skilled profes
sors and motivated students.
Specifically, by presenting both
monetary incentive and philosoph
ical encouragement to professors,
the students, the faculty and the
administration will benefit.
The teaching initiatives include
base salary additions given to 20
superior teachers, one-time cash

bonuses of $5000, four $10,0000
grants to facilitate innovations in
teaching, salary increases for CIV
lecturers and Freshman English
instructors and cash awards to out
standing graduate student teach
ing assistants.
These initiatives are thoughtful
and farsighted. By specifically tar
geting programs such as CIV and
Freshman English, courses re
quired of all Stanford undergradu
ates, the effects of the initiatives
will reach all incoming students.
By giving out cash awards, all
members of the faculty will have
incentive to make their teaching
the best it can be. Some student
input should be considered in des
ignating these awards as well as
faculty input to make the awards
the most indicative of the work in
the classroom.
However, some of the improve
ments to undergraduate teaching
will come through policy rather
than just through monetary incen
tive. Kennedy's proposed changes
in appointing and promoting fac
ulty members will further improve
the quality of education at Stan
ford.
Specifically, by limiting the
scholarly works considered when
making appointments, emphasis
will be placed on quality and not
just quantity. The result will be an
overall improvement in the quality
of research.
Furthermore, by changing the
promotional structure, teachers
will be under less pressure to pub
lish and can put more time and
thought into their teaching.
The net effect of these new $7
million initiatives will be a sub
stantial gain for the entire Univer
sity. Both Peter Bing and Kennedy
deserve much praise and recogni
tion for their strive towards a supe
rior undergraduate education.
Stanford should also be grateful to
the other donors of the new pro
gram.
