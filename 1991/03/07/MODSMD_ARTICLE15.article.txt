Charges of 'censorship' ignored pro-war bias of media

/\ ship pervades the Stanford
JL JLcommunity," wrote Ted Lieu, in
a letter to The Daily (Feb. 27). If I
remember correctly, Lieu complained
about the "hypocritical violence" of the
peace demonstrations; he hoped U.S. sol
diers wouldn't return to a "country more
damaged by violence than the countries
they're returning from."
So far, there are only three burned
autos, in comparison with 80,000 dead
and injured children, women and men,
not to mention miles and miles of anni
hilated land.
This spectacular inversion is symp
tomatic of most of Lieu's remarks.
Lieu combines a few specific organiza
tions that tried to criticize the war policy
with the rest of the Stanford community,
which can hardly be accused of any real
interest in the war, much less any criti
cism.
Also, Lieu ignores the massive and
incontrovertible bias overwhelmingly at
work in the U.S. media: 97 percent of all
"experts" interviewed or hired as com-

mentators have or have had professional
affiliations with the U.S. government;
less than 1 percent of all individuals
given prime-time coverage were critical
of the military policy; 27 percent of the
reporting was devoted to Israeli view
points; less than 20 percent went to
Arabs, 19 percent of whom were from
countries supporting the military policy;
there has been no coverage of dead
Arabs, either enemy or "friendly."
It is in the face of this massive
"imbalance" that the small local efforts
of two organizations on campus must be
understood, and Lieu ignores this wider
context.
Speaking of "balance," I must note
that even Lieu concedes that the "panel
discussions were surprisingly balanced,"
though he accuses the organizers of
"skewing" the program. On the one
hand, "the U.S. and Iraqi authorities. . .
are engaging in manipulation and propa
ganda," on the other an examination of
this manipulation is "completely
skewed."
And, on the one hand, "some very

insightful Stanford professors and
Hoover fellows do not share their wis
dom simply because they fear heckling
and unpopularity," on the other they
"should be blamed for failing to speak
their minds."
In these allegations of imbalance, Lieu
clearly shows his allegiance — Hoover
fellows are insightful and wise; critics of
military operations are skewed and
"politically correct" — implying either
that a majority amounts to correctness
or that a minority (and critics of the war
cannot by any count qualify as anything
but) somehow is able to bully a majority
into silence. And Lieu asks these critics
not to "insult the intelligence of the
Stanford community," for whom he evi
dently speaks.
I speak only for myself. If our purpose
was to preserve Kuwait, how can it be
achieved with an ocean sullied by mil
lions of gallons of oil, or homes and cities
blasted by bombs or burning oil fields?
If, as Bush says, "our quarrel is not
with the Iraqi people," why have so

many had to die?
If, as it is said, the Iraqis raped, bru
talized and murdered so many Kuwaiti
children, women and men, how will the
deaths of 80,000 Iraqi children, women
and men pay for those ruined lives?
If, as Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf said,
"they do not value the sanctity of human
life the way we do," why have we slaugh
tered more people in one month than
almost anyone else in history?
Who will profit from the billions of
dollars of debt, the miles of wasteland,
the maimed bodies and scarred minds?
It took 80,000 Iraqi, Kuwaiti, British,
Saudi, French and American deaths to
buy back a border invented by British
politics 60 years ago. If it is "politically
correct" to believe that there was
another way to finance this "line in the
sand," count me in.
Blood won't buy my silence, only the
silence of 80,000 souls, and who wanted
to listen to them anyway?
