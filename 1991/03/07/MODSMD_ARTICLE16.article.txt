# Incompetent leadership exacerbated indirect cost fiasco
## 
### 
IT WAS DIFFICULT DURING THE
war — especially for those of us who
had family members on active duty in
the military — to remain focused on
issues that are important here at home
and to take care of business as usual.
Therefore, I am encouraged by the posi
tive manner in which the Stanford com
munity has responded to the indirect
cost fiasco which, in my opinion, contin
ues to be exacerbated by the incompe
tence and intransigence of the Stanford
leadership of President Kennedy and his
administration.
Recent articles in the campus and
national media indicate to me that the
administration is continuing the kind of

public relations gimmickry that got
Stanford into trouble in the first place.
With respect to the issue of indirect
costs, it is clear that the Stanford
accounting system was not the basic
cause of the problem. However, Kennedy
intimates that it was and appears to be
using accounting methods as a means of
creating a "linkage" to "broader issues."
It seems to me that the long-term
interests of Stanford would be better
served if the community addresses the
problem as a local one. Let's put our own
house in order and not try to tell others
how to clean theirs.
I am appalled (but not really sur
prised) by Kennedy's remarks which

... megalomania is most
certainly not confined to
places like Iraq.

indicate his cavalier attitude toward the
crisis. Now that "repositioning" has
allowed him to consolidate power, the
"president" must feel very confident.
Luckily, however, we live in a democracy.
The next time that Kennedy wants
someone else to pay part of the family's
own wedding expenses I would suggest
that he solicits donations from the Stan
ford community instead of charging the

government.
Scandals, like the one being publicized
at Stanford, teach us the importance of
being vigilant and acting responsibly.
This is especially important when
integrity appears to be in short supply.
My experiences as a graduate student
at Stanford taught me that megalomania
is most certainly not confined to places
like Iraq. The Stanford ship (or yacht) is
sinking and it appears that the captain
would like the crew and passengers to go
down with him.
If Kennedy really loves Stanford, then
why would he want it so?
