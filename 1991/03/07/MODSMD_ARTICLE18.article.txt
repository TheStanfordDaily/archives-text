## Living in guilt 
### 
THE WRITER EDUARDO Galeano
said about Latin American
Catholics, "God is the guilt that
never leaves you."
Indeed God has not allowed me to
leave Him, and although I sometimes try
so hard to leave God behind, the guilt
invariably returns. I have to turn back
and scoop God up, frightened that He
might hurt me.
Guilt is only one part of being a Mexi
can Catholic.
Catholicism penetrates almost every
aspect of the Mexican existence. Catholic
ceremony presides at all the important
rituals of a Mexican's life: baptism, first
communion, quinceanera, wedding and
finally, death itself. Most of the characters
of the extended family — the compadres
and comadres and madrinas and padri
nos — are all acquired through some
Catholic ritual. Culturally, being a Mexi
can means being a Catholic as well.
I sincerely like the ceremonies: the big
weddings, the baptisms and all the fiestas
that are associated with these events. I
even find a quiet peace and solace in the
Sunday Mass and its extravagant ritual.
But I resent the brand of Catholicism,
more Mexican than Roman, with which I
was raised.
For along with the happy childhood
memories of pinatas and quinceaheras
are some equally dreadful memories of an
intense and immature sense of guilt.
As a "good" nine-year-old Mexican girl,
I was sent to catechism study every day
after school. Our catechism teacher, a
very old and stern woman from old Mex
ico, taught us the dogma of the pre-Vati

can II era. The constant stories of hellfire
were supposed to instill in us a fear of
God and to lead us on a path of everlast
ing holiness.
As innocent as I was, I was still con
vinced that I was doomed to Hell — for
having skipped Mass too many times, or
for having committed any number of the
small human errors that Catholics clas
sify as mortal sins.
I would hold on to dear life, terrified of
dying before I was ready for my first con
fession. When, finally, I could go to con
fession, I would go reluctantly, afraid that
the priest would be unwilling to grant me
forgiveness. Feelings of overpowering
shame and guilt tortured me every time.
When I was older I came to resent the
religion that had scarred me so deeply. I
decided that it was an imperialist religion
imposed upon my people in order to sub
jugate them to colonial Spaniards.
Then my friend Sophia in high school
convinced me that God was white and
male, condoned hatred, racism, sexism,
and surely could not be our god. If He did
exist, He didn't exist for us.
I was ready to stomp Catholicism from
my life, but I couldn't. Like Galeano said,
the guilt always comes creeping back. I
would find myself praying to God when I
woke from a bad dream, or when a loved
one was sick or in danger.
I have also realized that Mexican
Catholicism isn't your run-of-the-mill
Catholicism. It incorporates many
aspects of the indigenous Mexican reli
gions; the various indigenous gods were
transformed into Catholic saints, and the
Indian holidays became Catholic holi

days.
Mexican Catholicism, like the Mexican
people, is a hybrid. It is Catholicism made
even more extravagant by the Indian
influences. I have come to realize that
abandoning Catholicism would be aban
doning my culture.
I have decided that if I ever have chil
dren, I will want to baptize them and
introduce them to Catholicism. Not
because I have become a great believer —
I am still an agnostic — but because I
want them to understand Mexican cul
ture and to appreciate it, and Catholicism
goes far in explaining the intricacies of
the Mexican psyche.
But I never, ever want them to believe
in the hellfire and the guilt that
my own childhood.
To be fair, Catholicism, or strands of it,
has changed. The Liberation Theology
Movement has added a more human and
progressive aspect to Catholicism and
religion in Latin America as a whole. The
followers of Liberation Theology have
done much to educate and secure human
rights for the Latin American masses.
But Catholicism has scarred and
scared me so much that it will be a long
time before anything religious will appeal
to me again.
