# Faculty differs over new teaching plan

To some faculty members, University
President Donald Kennedy's plan to place
renewed emphasis and resources on teach
ing only reinforces an existing commitment
to instruction as well as research.
But to others it represents an inconsis
tent effort by the president to make impos
sible changes.
Kennedy announced Sunday a $7 million
program providing economic incentives to
improve teaching and reassert the impor

decisions.
The plan's goal — to "increase the reso
nance between teaching and research" — is
not a novel idea to some professors, includ
ing Dean of Research Robert Byer. "This is
another step in the gradual evolution" of
improved instruction, Byer said. "Research
and teaching are interrelated."
Byer said his research benefits from
interacting with students just as his lec
tures are supplemented by his research
experiences.
Electrical Engineering Prof. Fabian

Pease said careful surveys of students and
peer reviews among faculty have main
tained instruction at the level where "the
School of Engineering is already doing a
good job of undergraduate teaching."
Kennedy's announcement "gives those who
promote teaching added confidence that
they are doing the right thing," he said.
Having a high proportion of big-name
researchers that teach both undergradu
ates and graduates makes Stanford a
unique place to emphasize the importance
of both teaching and research, Byer said.
Such an environment has attracted new
faculty members, including Eric Roberts,
an associate professor of teaching in the
Computer Science Department.
"One of the reasons I came to Stanford
was because of Kennedy's talk last April" in
which he first proposed prioritizing teach
ing, Roberts said. "The position I have
taken is part of moving Stanford into a
framework of teaching."
But Political Science Prof. .John Manley
gives a different view of the University's
academic environment. He said Kennedy's
