# Faculty differs over new teaching plan
## 
### Jason Bloomstein Senior Staff writer 
To some faculty members, University
President Donald Kennedy's plan to place
renewed emphasis and resources on teach
ing only reinforces an existing commitment
to instruction as well as research.
But to others it represents an inconsis
tent effort by the president to make impos
sible changes.
Kennedy announced Sunday a $7 million
program providing economic incentives to
improve teaching and reassert the impor
tance of classroom instruction in hiring
decisions.
The plan's goal — to "increase the reso
nance between teaching and research" — is
not a novel idea to some professors, includ
ing Dean of Research Robert Byer. "This is
another step in the gradual evolution" of
improved instruction, Byer said. "Research
and teaching are interrelated."
Byer said his research benefits from
interacting with students just as his lec
tures are supplemented by his research
experiences.
Electrical Engineering Prof. Fabian

Pease said careful surveys of students and
peer reviews among faculty have main
tained instruction at the level where "the
School of Engineering is already doing a
good job of undergraduate teaching."
Kennedy's announcement "gives those who
promote teaching added confidence that
they are doing the right thing," he said.
Having a high proportion of big-name
researchers that teach both undergradu
ates and graduates makes Stanford a
unique place to emphasize the importance
of both teaching and research, Byer said.
Such an environment has attracted new
faculty members, including Eric Roberts,
an associate professor of teaching in the
Computer Science Department.
"One of the reasons I came to Stanford
was because of Kennedy's talk last April" in
which he first proposed prioritizing teach
ing, Roberts said. "The position I have
taken is part of moving Stanford into a
framework of teaching."
But Political Science Prof. .John Manley
gives a different view of the University's
academic environment. He said Kennedy's
plan can do little to surmount the
overwhelming importance placed
on publishing research findings.
"Stanford is Stanford because
of its emphasis on research — by
placing it before teaching," Man
ley said. In motivating faculty to
reconsider their teaching habits,
Kennedy's plan is "useful
rhetoric, but whether it will
improve education I frankly doubt
it."
Because the quality of a
school's faculty — and therefore
the overall perception of the qual
ity of a school — depends solely on
the amount of research produced,
Manley said, to reemphasize
teaching, "all Stanford has to do is
decide it no longer wants to be
number one."
The proposal contains a provi
sion for considering a professor's
teaching quality when making
appointments and promotions,
which are often based primarily
on past research.
Such a change in the hiring
process could make a serious
impact, said Gilbert Masters, pro
fessor of civil engineering. "In a
university, key decisions are
tenure decisions," he said.
Kennedy's proposal "could change

the way professors do business."
Some faculty members do not
think Kennedy's plan will revolu
tionize the way scholars work
because much of the incentive to
improve teaching is in the form of
monetary compensation. Profes
sors do not necessarily choose to
work at a university for the
money, they say.
Stuart Reges, a lecturer in com
puter science, said he feels that
good teachers in the School of
Engineering are not underpaid
but that compensation could be
improved through more teaching
awards and increased access to
administrators, rather than just
cash bonuses.
Funds for the plan come par
tially from a $5 million grant
given to the University by trustees
Peter and Helen Bing.
Most of the bonuses and extra
funding specifically earmarked in
Kennedy's proposal are for faculty
in the School of Humanities and
Sciences, which gives hope to
expanding some humanities pro
grams and rankles some engi
neers.
Philosophy lecturer Glennys
Young, who teaches in the Cul
tures, Ideas and Values program,
said she hopes a significant
amount of the money will be chan
neled into that program. CIV
teachers, who are primarily lec

turers and do not do formal
research, "work hard and are not
adequately compensated," she
said.
She added that money should
be used to increase CIV instruc
tors' salaries and to increase the
number of sections in order to
reduce class size. I don't know if
the new money will improve CIV
instruction, she said, "but I have
the impression that it might."
Masters said he was concerned
the proposal does not stipulate
salary bonuses for professors in
the School of Engineering. Per
haps with all the large sums of
money that flow through the
school, he said, the University
feels that engineering professors
are adequately compensated and
that a $1,000 bonus, for example,
would "have more leverage" in the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences.
Still others said they were con
cerned Kennedy failed to consult
much of the faculty before he
announced the proposal to the
media.
"It is odd that the president
seems more interested in getting
headlines and consulting the fac
ulty afterward," said Art Prof.
Albert Elsen. "It appears that the
new ideas of the president are
aimed at the press. I am not alone
in finding this curious."

ing Dean of Research Robert Byer. "This is
another step in the gradual evolution" of
improved instruction, Byer said. "Research
and teaching are interrelated."
Byer said his research benefits from
interacting with students just as his lec
tures are supplemented by his research
experiences.
Electrical Engineering Prof. Fabian

Pease said careful surveys of students and
peer reviews among faculty have main
tained instruction at the level where "the
School of Engineering is already doing a
good job of undergraduate teaching."
Kennedy's announcement "gives those who
promote teaching added confidence that
they are doing the right thing," he said.
Having a high proportion of big-name
researchers that teach both undergradu
ates and graduates makes Stanford a
unique place to emphasize the importance
of both teaching and research, Byer said.
Such an environment has attracted new
faculty members, including Eric Roberts,
an associate professor of teaching in the
Computer Science Department.
"One of the reasons I came to Stanford
was because of Kennedy's talk last April" in
which he first proposed prioritizing teach
ing, Roberts said. "The position I have
taken is part of moving Stanford into a
framework of teaching."
But Political Science Prof. .John Manley
gives a different view of the University's
academic environment. He said Kennedy's
plan can do little to surmount the
overwhelming importance placed
on publishing research findings.
"Stanford is Stanford because
of its emphasis on research — by
placing it before teaching," Man
ley said. In motivating faculty to
reconsider their teaching habits,
Kennedy's plan is "useful
rhetoric, but whether it will
improve education I frankly doubt
it."
Because the quality of a
school's faculty — and therefore
the overall perception of the qual
ity of a school — depends solely on
the amount of research produced,
Manley said, to reemphasize
teaching, "all Stanford has to do is
decide it no longer wants to be
number one."
The proposal contains a provi
sion for considering a professor's
teaching quality when making
appointments and promotions,
which are often based primarily
on past research.
Such a change in the hiring
process could make a serious
impact, said Gilbert Masters, pro
fessor of civil engineering. "In a
university, key decisions are
tenure decisions," he said.
Kennedy's proposal "could change

the way professors do business."
Some faculty members do not
think Kennedy's plan will revolu
tionize the way scholars work
because much of the incentive to
improve teaching is in the form of
monetary compensation. Profes
sors do not necessarily choose to
work at a university for the
money, they say.
Stuart Reges, a lecturer in com
puter science, said he feels that
good teachers in the School of
Engineering are not underpaid
but that compensation could be
improved through more teaching
awards and increased access to
administrators, rather than just
cash bonuses.
Funds for the plan come par
tially from a $5 million grant
given to the University by trustees
Peter and Helen Bing.
Most of the bonuses and extra
funding specifically earmarked in
Kennedy's proposal are for faculty
in the School of Humanities and
Sciences, which gives hope to
expanding some humanities pro
grams and rankles some engi
neers.
Philosophy lecturer Glennys
Young, who teaches in the Cul
tures, Ideas and Values program,
said she hopes a significant
amount of the money will be chan
neled into that program. CIV
teachers, who are primarily lec

turers and do not do formal
research, "work hard and are not
adequately compensated," she
said.
She added that money should
be used to increase CIV instruc
tors' salaries and to increase the
number of sections in order to
reduce class size. I don't know if
the new money will improve CIV
instruction, she said, "but I have
the impression that it might."
Masters said he was concerned
the proposal does not stipulate
salary bonuses for professors in
the School of Engineering. Per
haps with all the large sums of
money that flow through the
school, he said, the University
feels that engineering professors
are adequately compensated and
that a $1,000 bonus, for example,
would "have more leverage" in the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences.
Still others said they were con
cerned Kennedy failed to consult
much of the faculty before he
announced the proposal to the
media.
"It is odd that the president
seems more interested in getting
headlines and consulting the fac
ulty afterward," said Art Prof.
Albert Elsen. "It appears that the
new ideas of the president are
aimed at the press. I am not alone
in finding this curious."
