## Keefe is doing it all for Stanford 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
All right, before all the "Adam
knows volleyball" or "Adam
knows hoops" jokes get out of
hand, let's just put this baby to
rest once and for all:
Stanford center/middle blocker/
superstar Adam Keefe is nothing
like Bo Jackson.
In fact, the thought is com
pletely ridiculous. Bo could run
around, over and through Adam
on the football field. And baseball?
Forget it.
On the other hand, can you
imagine Adam posting up Bo
down low? Count it and go to the
line. Adam spiking on Mr. Jack
son? Sorry 'bout the ball print on
your face, 80.
It might be something to dream
about, but don't bet on it ever
happening. Still, people keep try
ing to draw some connection
between the two two-sport stars.
"It comes up," says Keefe, a 6-
foot-9 junior who's performed his
double duty for the men's basket
ball and volleyball teams for the
past three seasons. "There's some

fundamental differences, though.
I'm not nearly as good at any of
the things that I do as he is at
both of the things he does."
Uh-huh. For the record, so far
this basketball season the "not
nearly-as-good" Keefe:
• Has scored more points (21.2
per game) than any two of his
teammates combined — come
Hell, high water or collapsing
defenses, the man is going to get
his 20 even if it kills him;
• Has grabbed more rebounds
(9.7 per game) than any two of his
teammates;
• Has attempted and made
more free throws (169-for-216,
.782) than any three of his team
mates put together;
• Came in second on the team
in the preseason mile run at five
minutes flat — "Not bad for a big
lumbering type of guy," smiles the
220-pounder; and
• Was unanimously named the
District VIII (Arizona, California,
Oregon, Washington, Alaska and
Hawaii) Men's Basketball Player
of the Year on Tuesday.
Bo should be so good. Add in
the fact that Fred Sturm, the
coach of the U.S. national volley
ball team, once said that Keefe
could potentially be the best vol
leyball player of all time — yes,
the best ever — and you've got
one heck of an athletic resume.
And a lot of attention. After
every single basketball game this
season — after spending 40 min
utes banging inside, taking abuse
from just about everybody and
losing a few pounds in the process
— Keefe has had to go through
the equally painful postgame
press conferences. Every single
game.

Everyone, it seems, wants to
talk to Adam — whether it's
about the team, about his future,
or about posing for a ridiculous
picture for a newspaper. "It's nice
to be recognized for what you do,"
he says, "but it brings along a lot
of added burdens. Sometimes that
far outweighs being able to talk to
reporters, and even that's not nec
essarily considered the greatest of
deeds." (It's not?)
The attention, however — both
from the media and from opposing
defenses designed to pound on
him — is more than worth it.
Besides, who can feel sorry for a
man as lucky as Keefe?
"My whole life — I don't know
what it is — every sport I've tried,
I've just picked up really easily,"
Keefe says. "Well, except golf."
Aha! Why? Too much coordina
tion involved? Too intricate?
"Well, I've never played," he
smiles. "I'm sure I could handle it
once I got in there. . . . No, just
kidding."
Sure he is.
Anyway. ... "I was just a nut,"
Keefe says. "That's all I ever did
in my free time, play sports. I
loved to go out and play football,
and there was volleyball in high
school." Keefe was the USA Today
California Athlete of the Year in
1987-88.
But wait — there's more. "I got
asked to pitch and come out for
football in high school, too," he
says.
Bo who?
Keefe didn't try out for either
team — he was kind of busy — but
will still play just about anything.
"For whatever reason, I just have
pretty good hand-eye coordina
tion," he says,"and that's proba

bly more than anything what's
kept me moving on and progress
• — »
ing.
That progression will take him
to the National Basketball Associ
ation — and several million dol
lars — sometime very soon.
The question just about every
Stanford hoops fan is asking,
then, is "Will Keefe be back?" And
the answer is . . . "For the record,
it appears that way," he says. "For
the record, I haven't received one
letter or one phone call from any
pro organization, so people can
talk all they want, but until that
option is made available for me I
don't really have to go about mak
ing that decision."
Off the record? Ask him your
self.
If the situation does come up —
and it hasn't — Keefe will have a
lot of thinking to do. "For the
most part it would be a business
decision," he says. "If someone
was able to guarantee a lot of
money over a substantial number
of years, then that needs to be
looked at and a decision needs to
be made.
"At that point, I think that's
too big an issue to just ignore. All
through my life, even with playing
volleyball, I've always been the
1 type of guy to keep my options
open, not burn too many bridges."
In the meantime, he'll just
. keep playing whatever happens to
come along — and trying to beat
girlfriend Kristin Klein at tennis.
He can't do it yet — she kicks his
butt every time they play — but
then again . . . "I'm coming on
, strong," he grins, "and she's get
ting a little scared to play me."
Don't bet against him.


While Adam Keefe doesn't have the endorsement package Bo
Jackson has, he has also proven himself a great two-sport athlete.
Keefe and the basketball team meet California tonight in an effort
to clinch some postseason hoops action before he changes into
his volleyball uniform.
