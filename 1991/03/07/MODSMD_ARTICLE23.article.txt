# Versatile Weatherford leads Card swimmers
## 
### Amy Wusterbarth Staff writer 
Pure gold. That's what men's swim
ming coach Skip Kenney received last
spring when he signed the nation's No. 1
recruit, Derek Weatherford.
"He's one of those all-star type swim
mers and an all-star person," said Ken
ney, "You can tell he's a champion in and
out of the water."
Like Midas' touch turns things into
gold, Weatherford's touch at the end of a
race usually equals victory. He has more
NCAA qualifying times and more team
best times than anyone on the accom
plished Cardinal squad. He already holds
the deGuerre Pool record in the 200-yard
backstroke and has a faster seasonal
time in the event than world champion
backstroker Jeff Rouse.
Although he likes backstroke best,
Weatherford also holds the best time on
the team in the 400 individual medley,
an event he's swum only once, the 500
freestyle, and he has the fastest split
time in the 400 freestyle relay.
It is this versatility which made the
Ft. Myers, Fla., golden boy such a hot
item last spring. "He's amazing in so
many areas," Kenney said. "It's an excit
ing problem for a coach. Where do I use
him in a dual meet?"
What Kenney has done is use him to
shore up the team's rough spots. Weath
erford swam distance early in the season
and then switched to backstroke and
sprinting. And Weatherford has enjoyed
the transition. "I like the 200 IM
because it's kind of like a sprint," he
said.
Training with super-backstroker
Rouse has helped Weatherford refine his
form. "I'm learning a lot from him kick
ing-wise," said the freshman. "He's
more experienced, but it's kind of a
mutual thing. We both ask each other for
hints on turns or strokes."
Kenney feels Rouse is part of the rea
son Weatherford came to Stanford. "Jeff
is the best, and Derek came to have the
opportunity to train with him. He didn't
shy away. .. . They can go one-two in the
Olympic Trials. They work really well
together."
Whether working with Rouse or with
the rest of the team, Weatherford goes
all out. "He's so good in training that
some of the guys weren't too sure about
him at first," Kenney said. "They hadn't
seen anyone train that hard and that
fast. They're too young to have seen the
Jeff Kostoffs and Sean Murphys (multi
ple NCAA champions and Olympians)

who swam All-America times regularly
in practice. Derek's one of those."
Asst. coach Ted Knapp agrees, "He's
probably one of our top two No. 1
recruits at Stanford in the '80s." The
other one is 11-time NCAA champion
Pablo Morales, the greatest swimmer in
Cardinal, and perhaps NCAA, history.
Being ranked up with the best of the
best surprises Weatherford. The humble
star didn't expect so much, so soon at
Stanford. "I just figured I had nothing to
lose by coming out here. My age-group
coach had taught me everything he
knew, so it was time for a change," said
Weatherford.
In his youth, Weatherford went
through many changes until he began
swimming when at age 8. His family
moved from state to state until they
ended up in Florida. Because they lived
near the ocean, Derek's mother wanted
him to overcome his fear of the water
and learn to swim. He's been part fish
ever since.
When he wasn't swimming he was
often watching the sport on television.
Weatherford was sure he wanted to come
to Stanford after seeing the Cardinal win
multiple NCAA Championships. "I
thought it was just the awesomest place
to go," he said.
However, that desire began to fade as
Texas raced past the Cardinal at NCAAs.
Then he missed his Stanford recruiting
trip because of illness and figured he
probably wouldn't reschedule. Eventu
ally, though, Weatherford visited
because "my parents really wanted me to
come out, they said if I turned down an
opportunity to go see Stanford Univer
sity I must be pretty crazy."
He flew out and, within 24 hours, he
knew that he wanted to be a California
boy. "I laid low for the rest of the week
end and didn't say much to anybody . . .
but I was overwhelmed."
Because of Stanford's academic stan
dards, the nation's top recruits do not
always have the option of coming here.
So Kenney knew he had hit the jackpot
when he signed Weatherford.
"As soon as he got to Stanford he said
to me, 'I want to be the best in the world
or the best that I have the potential to
be. I'll do anything you tell me. When do
we start practice?' What more can you
ask for?," said an impressed Kenney. .
Both Kenney and Knapp note Weath
erford's hard-core work ethic as the key
to his success. "His strokes aren't pic
ture-perfect because he's so mentally
aggressive that he doesn't think of the
finer points," said Knapp.
His technique will come as he gets
closer to peaking, according to Knapp. "A
lot of times swimmers at Derek's level
get strong early and peak as sopho
mores. The fact that Derek is missing
some of those final things and is still as
good as he is really says something about
his potential."
Weatherford's gold mine of success
seems endless. Kenney summed it up by
saying, "He's very coachable, his work
ethic is at the highest level, he's got
great academics, he gets along well with
the guys and he's quick to smile and
enjoy himself. Basically, he's got it all."

ple NCAA champions and Olympians)

who swam All-America times regularly
in practice. Derek's one of those."
Asst. coach Ted Knapp agrees, "He's
probably one of our top two No. 1
recruits at Stanford in the '80s." The
other one is 11-time NCAA champion
Pablo Morales, the greatest swimmer in
Cardinal, and perhaps NCAA, history.
Being ranked up with the best of the
best surprises Weatherford. The humble
star didn't expect so much, so soon at
Stanford. "I just figured I had nothing to
lose by coming out here. My age-group
coach had taught me everything he
knew, so it was time for a change," said
Weatherford.
In his youth, Weatherford went
through many changes until he began
swimming when at age 8. His family
moved from state to state until they
ended up in Florida. Because they lived
near the ocean, Derek's mother wanted
him to overcome his fear of the water
and learn to swim. He's been part fish
ever since.
When he wasn't swimming he was
often watching the sport on television.
Weatherford was sure he wanted to come
to Stanford after seeing the Cardinal win
multiple NCAA Championships. "I
thought it was just the awesomest place
to go," he said.
However, that desire began to fade as
Texas raced past the Cardinal at NCAAs.
Then he missed his Stanford recruiting
trip because of illness and figured he
probably wouldn't reschedule. Eventu
ally, though, Weatherford visited
because "my parents really wanted me to
come out, they said if I turned down an
opportunity to go see Stanford Univer
sity I must be pretty crazy."
He flew out and, within 24 hours, he
knew that he wanted to be a California
boy. "I laid low for the rest of the week
end and didn't say much to anybody . . .
but I was overwhelmed."
Because of Stanford's academic stan
dards, the nation's top recruits do not
always have the option of coming here.
So Kenney knew he had hit the jackpot
when he signed Weatherford.
"As soon as he got to Stanford he said
to me, 'I want to be the best in the world
or the best that I have the potential to
be. I'll do anything you tell me. When do
we start practice?' What more can you
ask for?," said an impressed Kenney. .
Both Kenney and Knapp note Weath
erford's hard-core work ethic as the key
to his success. "His strokes aren't pic
ture-perfect because he's so mentally
aggressive that he doesn't think of the
finer points," said Knapp.
His technique will come as he gets
closer to peaking, according to Knapp. "A
lot of times swimmers at Derek's level
get strong early and peak as sopho
mores. The fact that Derek is missing
some of those final things and is still as
good as he is really says something about
his potential."
Weatherford's gold mine of success
seems endless. Kenney summed it up by
saying, "He's very coachable, his work
ethic is at the highest level, he's got
great academics, he gets along well with
the guys and he's quick to smile and
enjoy himself. Basically, he's got it all."
Pure gold. That's what men's swim
ming coach Skip Kenney received last
spring when he signed the nation's No. 1
recruit, Derek Weatherford.
"He's one of those all-star type swim
mers and an all-star person," said Ken
ney, "You can tell he's a champion in and
out of the water."
Like Midas' touch turns things into
gold, Weatherford's touch at the end of a
race usually equals victory. He has more
NCAA qualifying times and more team
best times than anyone on the accom
plished Cardinal squad. He already holds
the deGuerre Pool record in the 200-yard
backstroke and has a faster seasonal
time in the event than world champion
backstroker Jeff Rouse.
Although he likes backstroke best,
Weatherford also holds the best time on
the team in the 400 individual medley,
an event he's swum only once, the 500
freestyle, and he has the fastest split
time in the 400 freestyle relay.
It is this versatility which made the
Ft. Myers, Fla., golden boy such a hot
item last spring. "He's amazing in so
many areas," Kenney said. "It's an excit
ing problem for a coach. Where do I use
him in a dual meet?"
What Kenney has done is use him to
shore up the team's rough spots. Weath
erford swam distance early in the season
and then switched to backstroke and
sprinting. And Weatherford has enjoyed
the transition. "I like the 200 IM
because it's kind of like a sprint," he
said.
Training with super-backstroker
Rouse has helped Weatherford refine his
form. "I'm learning a lot from him kick
ing-wise," said the freshman. "He's
more experienced, but it's kind of a
mutual thing. We both ask each other for
hints on turns or strokes."
Kenney feels Rouse is part of the rea
son Weatherford came to Stanford. "Jeff
is the best, and Derek came to have the
opportunity to train with him. He didn't
shy away. .. . They can go one-two in the
Olympic Trials. They work really well
together."
Whether working with Rouse or with
the rest of the team, Weatherford goes
all out. "He's so good in training that
some of the guys weren't too sure about
him at first," Kenney said. "They hadn't
seen anyone train that hard and that
fast. They're too young to have seen the
Jeff Kostoffs and Sean Murphys (multi
ple NCAA champions and Olympians)

who swam All-America times regularly
in practice. Derek's one of those."
