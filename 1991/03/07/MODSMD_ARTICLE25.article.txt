# Spartans surprise sleepy Stanford
## 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
Stanford's baseball game against San
Jose State couldn't be postponed
because of rain, but it should have been
canceled due to lack of interest.
A paltry 147 fans showed up at
Sunken Diamond yesterday, equaling
the biggest accomplishment of the after
noon for the top-ranked Cardinal: mak
ing it to the ballpark. The unranked
Spartans made all the big plays, spank
ing sedated Stanford 7-4.

The small crowd was justifiable for a
game that was scheduled as a make-up
just two days earlier, but the loss to
unheralded San Jose was hard to swal
low for Stanford coach Mark Marquess.
"I wasn't pleased — we didn't play
well," said a steamed Marquess after the
loss. "We had one hit after five innings
and we had no offense all day.
"They played better than we did and
they hit the ball. I give them credit; they
deserved to win," he continued.
Stanford lost its fourth non-confer
ence game of the year, falling to 17-4.
The Spartans, 43-17 a year ago, are now
6-9.
Stanford had no extra-base hits, no
players with multiple hits, and let a two
run lead slip away in the eighth, as
relievers Andrew Lorraine, John Lynch
and Aaron Dorlarque were collectively
and individually ineffective at shutting

down the usually light-hitting Spartans.
With Stanford leading 4-2 in the
eighth, Lorraine, a freshman left-han
der, loaded the bases with a single, hit
batter, balk and walk. He was replaced
by Lynch, who struck out one batter,
but let two runs score with two worst
timing-possible wild pitches.
In the ninth Lynch walked one batter
and was replaced by Dorlarque, who had
his 28-inning scoreless streak snapped
Saturday against Arizona.
Dorlarque looked like he was going to
make it out of the inning, inducing a
strikeout and infield groundout after a
single by Jason Bugg.
But Spartan right fielder Ken Hen
derson slapped a three-run home run
just over the fence in right, giving San
Jose a 7-4 lead.
"He had already thrown two pitches
that I should have hit, but he gave me
one more over the plate," said Hender
son, whose home run was his first of the
season.
"We've been competitive all year and
this win really gives us a lift," Hender
son continued. "We could just as easily
be 11-3 and this shows we can beat
anybody."
The Spartans scored a run in the first
off starter Willie Adams, but Stanford
tied the game in the second on a run
scoring single to left by Chris Kemper.
Henderson singled in a run off Jamie
Sepeda in the third to put the Spartans
back in front 2-1, while Stanford did not
awake offensively until the seventh.
Roger Burnett and David McCarty
led off the seventh with back-to-back
singles, as Burnett extended his hit
streak to 12 games. After Jeffrey Ham
monds grounded out and Ryan Turner

walked, David Holbrook lofted a bases
loaded sacrifice fly to left, scoring Bur
nett.
Troy Tallman and Mark Skeels fol
lowed with run-scoring singles, giving
Stanford a temporary 4-2 lead.
After San Jose rallied in the top of
the ninth, Stanford was retired in order
in the bottom half. Spartan ace Mark
Ringkamp came on to record his first
save of the year.
Eight Stanford pitchers had turns on
the mound, with sophomore right-han
der Brian Sackinsky making his first
appearance of the season in the seventh
inning. He pitched just one inning and
threw eight pitches, retiring the three
batters he faced.
The baby-faced power-pitcher was
10-1 last year and won two games in the
College World Series, but missed the
first 20 games of 1991 with tendinitis in
his pitching arm.
Stanford, which leads the Pacific 10
Conference with a 4-0 record, visits sec
ond-place and nationally sixth-ranked
USC (5-1) tomorrow in the start of a
three-game series.
Card notes
Former Cardinal right fielder Paul
Carey watched the Stanford game from the
stands yesterday as he prepares for spring
training with the Baltimore Orioles.
Carey, who holds the Stanford career
records in games, at bats, hits, runs batted in
and home runs, recently had his contract
purchased by the Orioles and reports to
camp in Sarasota, Fla., Sunday.
Carey played for the independent Miami
Miracle on the A level last year.

his pitching arm.

Card notes
Former Cardinal right fielder Paul
Carey watched the Stanford game from the
stands yesterday as he prepares for spring
training with the Baltimore Orioles.
Carey, who holds the Stanford career
records in games, at bats, hits, runs batted in
and home runs, recently had his contract
purchased by the Orioles and reports to
camp in Sarasota, Fla., Sunday.
Carey played for the independent Miami
Miracle on the A level last year.
