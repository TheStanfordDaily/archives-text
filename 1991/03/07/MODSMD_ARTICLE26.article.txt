"[West Virginia 1 was weakened by a
couple of injuries, but it was definitely a
good win for us," coach Dick Gould said.
"This was a good test for us," asst.
coach John Whitlinger added. "It gave
us some good practice before (Kentucky
and Miami] this weekend."
Stanford jumped out to an early lead
in all its matches. According to Gould,
that was the crucial difference. "It
always helps to get ahead early. Our
guys got an early jump and that was
very important."
Freshman Michael Flanagan jumped
out so quickly at No. 6 singles that the
match was decided before either player
had a chance to settle down. Flanagan,
whose mother was on the scene from
Dallas, Texas, double-bageled David
Gibbs, 6-0, 6-0.

Jason Yee also got off to a quick start,
beating Juron Bergwall at No. 4 singles,
6-3, 6-2. "I came up with a few key
shots on big points. That was really the
difference," Yee said.
At No. 1 singles, Alex O'Brien started
slowly but, as usual, the Cardinal junior
finished with a bang, downing Patric
Westoo 6-4, 6-1.
Freshman Vimal Patel was fourth off
the courts with a 6-2, 7-6 triumph over
Rodrigo Gonzalez at No. 5 singles. Once
again, however, Patel had trouble clos
ing out the match, after leading 5-2 in
the second set. "Vimal has gotten into a
habit of letting second sets slip away. It
almost happened again," Gould said.
Glenn Solomon, who often finds him
self in the unenviable position of having
to clinch dual matches, did it again with
a drawn-out 6-3, 4-6, 6-2 win over
Manolo Moure at No. 3 singles. "I felt a
little sluggish in the second set. I wasn't
setting up (my feet) quick enough,"
Solomon said. "Then Coach (Gould) told
me to start attacking more. That usu
ally helps me to set up quicker. Needless
to say, putting the pressure on him
worked."
Although the match had already been
clinched with Stanford leading 5-0, the
most thrilling contest of the day took
place at No. 2 singles. Stanford sopho
more Jared Palmer eventually came out
on top of the marathon match, edging

Mark Booras 7-6, 3-6, 7-6.
Palmer actually had two match
points in the 10th game of the third set
hut could not break Booras' serve at 4-5.
In the third-set tiebreaker, Booras
jumped out to a 5-1 lead and had a
match point with Palmer serving at 5-6.
Palmer, however, came up with some big
shots (as usual), including a forehand
passing shot on match point, to take the
tiebreaker 8-6 and the match.
"Jared was struggling with his serve
all day, but he did a good job of staying in
there," Gould said. "The fact that he
came back from 5-1 down in the third
set tiebreaker is a tribute to a tremen
dous competitive effort."
The Cardinal showed its stength —
and depth — in doubles. O'Brien and
Yee quickly dispatched of Westoo and
Gonzalez at No. 1, 6-1, 6-3. Dan Turbow
teamed up with freshman Chris Coco
tos, who was filling in for Palmer, to
overpower Moure and Bergwall 6-3, 6-3
at No. 2 doubles. Freshmen Robert
Devens and Flanagan played better on
the big points to down Booras and
Gibbs, 6-4, 7-5.
The victory moved Stanford, which
still is ranked No. 1 in the country, to 6-
1 on the season. The Cardinal now pre
pares for two home matches against
14th-ranked Kentucky Saturday and
12th-ranked Miami Sunday.
