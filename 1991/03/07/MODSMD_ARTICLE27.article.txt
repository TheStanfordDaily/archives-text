# Henning pointing the way to NCAA Tournament
## 
### David Hirning Senior staff writer 
The word is out. The Stanford com
munity will have one final chance to
catch the biggest hit of the season, a
show that has drawn rave reviews in
city after city up and down the West
Coast. Mark it on your calendar: March
16, Maples Pavilion.
Be sure you don't miss the encore
performance of The Sonja Henning
Farewell Tribute Tour.
On that date, according to solid pre
tournament speculation, Henning will
bring her talents to Maples one final
time for a second-round NCAA tourna
ment game. For Stanford fans, it will be
a tearful goodbye. But for the rest of the
league, and the country, it is more of a
great relief.
Four years of Sorya is enough for
anyone on the other side of the ball.
Towards the end of this season, it has
almost become a cliche. Stanford wins,
and after the game the opposing coach
and players sit in the interview room
and babble, "Sonja, Sonja. ..." A few
samples:
Harold Rhodes, Washington State: "I
think the difference was that we didn't
have anyone that could stop Sonja Hen
ning."
Marianne Stanley, after the Cardinal
beat her USC squad: "I thought that
Tammy Story (her point guard) did a
great job against Henning, who I believe
is the best point guard in the country."
Gooch Foster, California: "In my esti
mation, Sonja Henning is the best point
guard in the country. When you're play
ing against Sonja, you have to do every
thing right."
The coach you see fighting back tears
in the corner is not an opponent but the
Cardinal's own Tara VanDerveer, who
will lose perhaps the best point guard in
Stanford history at season's end. "I
don't like to think about Sonja and
Trisha (Stevens) graduating, unless I

want to put myself in pain," VanDerveer
said.
When she's not in agony, VanDerveer
is busy stumping for Henning to be
Pacific 10 Conference Player of the Year.
The senior co-captain from Racine, Wis.
has a shot, and is a lock for her third
straight All Pac-10 selection. The team
has even produced a video promoting
her for All-America.
The signs are everywhere . . . liter
ally. It was Henning that the Athletic
Department chose as its cover girl for
the Stanford basketball billboard on El
Camino Real. She's in demand for auto
graphs after every game. Call her the
spark, the glue, the key . . . just be sure
to call on her when the game's on the
line.
After Henning pulled victory from
the jaws of defeat last Friday at Califor
nia, scoring 18 points and\lishing out a
conference-record 15 assists, Van-
Derveer distilled all the lofty praise into
this simple statement: "Sonja is the rea
son our team is winning. She's carrying
this team on her 5-foot-7 frame."
Henning is Stanford women's bas
ketball. "She walked on the court fresh
man year and became the starting point
guard," VanDerveer says, and she has
provided a consistency at the
that is usually only found in the NBA

ranks. This year, Henning has started
every game and is averaging 36 minutes
a contest.
Henning is the epitome of a "Most
Valuable Player" (and, indeed, has been
the Cardinal's MVP every year the
award has been given during her
tenure), doing just about everything on
the court: she runs the offense, orches
trates the fast break, passes, scores,
defends, rebounds... .
Rebounds? At 5-7? Don't ask how,
but the senior is averaging nearly six
boards a game, third on the team behind
a pair of 6-3 forwards (Val Whiting and
Julie Zeilstra) that are supposed to
rebound. But Henning does it, just as
she does everything else: seemingly
without effort.
This is not always to her advantage,
and VanDerveer thinks it may be one
reason why Henning has not received
the recognition she deserved before this
year. "Sonja is so smooth out there on
the court that you don't notice every
thing she does. She'll get 22 points, and
I won't know where they came from."
Another explanation for past neglect
could have been Henning's scoring.
After averaging 10.8 points per game
her freshman year, Henning's numbers
actually dropped in the following two
seasons, to 10.1 and then to an 8.8 aver
age last season. After gathering pre-sea
son All-America honors before her
sophomore year, Henning was virtually
ignored at the national level last season.
Of course, Henning was surrounded
by four pretty decent scorers last year,
including national Player of the Year
Jennifer Azzi. It's sometimes hard to
shine playing in the same backcourt as
the brightest star in the women's game.
Henning averaged nearly seven assists a
game last year dishing to stars Azzi,
Katy Steding, Stevens and Zeilstra.
Oh, yes, Henning also led her team to
a 32-1 season last year and its first-ever

Senior Sonja Hennlng has often been overlooked by fans in her four years on the
Farm, but coaches have always spoken highly of her. Now, going into the final two
regular-season games of her career, the recognition is finally coming and she is a
leading All-America candidate.
NCAA title. She was one of only
three juniors on the U.S. National
Team the following summer. So
she must be doing something
right.
This year, Henning has turned
up her scoring, but not to garner
any more awards. It's simply that
for the young squad to be success
ful, Henning needs to contribute
more points.
"I'm in a different role this
year," Henning said "We've
always had Jennifer and Katy —
great outside shooters — and I
didn't need to shoot. This year, I
have to look to score more."
And just like that, she has:
Henning is second on the team in
scoring this year with a 15.7 aver
age, good enough to be in the top
10 in the Pac-10 (she's 10th
entering tonight's game).
It could be said that Henning
was not known for her shot when
she came to Stanford, but count
less hours outside practice shoot
ing with Azzi and Steding has

paid off. This year, Henning has a
.474 percentage from the field
and leads the team with 40 per
oent average from three-point
range, good for fifth in the confer
ence.
But setting up her teammates
is still what Henning excels at,
and she is tops in the Pac-10 in
assists at 7.5 per game. "When
you think about what makes a
great player, it's making everyone
else you play with look better,"
VanDerveer said. "Sonja brings
out the best in other people on
our team."
Zeilstra, who is averaging 20
points a game this year partly
because Henning gets her the
ball, testifies, "Sonja is just an
amazing passer. I don't know
what else to say."
Says forward Chris Mac-
Murdo, "I think we're all getting
a little spoiled playing with Sonja,
because she's so good. When
you're out on the court, you don't
have to think, because she does
the thinking for you. Things just
run smoothly when she's out
there."
