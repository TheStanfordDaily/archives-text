# Other universities plan to watch Stanford's progress

### Miranda Doyle Staff writer 
Stanford's announcement of
a $7 million teaching initiative
has captured attention at uni
versities nationwide as part of
a larger discussion of how to
balance teaching and research.
However, representatives of
some universities cautioned
that Stanford's plan may be
difficult to implement without
a clear definition of good teach
ing.
Both James Wilkinson,
director of Harvard Univer
sity's Danforth Center for
Teaching and Learning, and

Yale University Prof. William
Bennett expressed concern
over the methods used to mea
sure teaching ability. "It is a
good goal, but there are prob
lems defining and documenting
good teaching," Wilkinson said.
With research, he said,
schools can look at published
work in making appointment
and promotion decisions. But it
is more difficult to determine
who is a good teacher. For
example, teachers with small
classes may have an advantage
over those with large classes
because they can be more effec
tive, he added.
Bennett, who chairs Yale's
teaching and learning committee,
said he hopes Stanford will be
careful about using student eval
uations. "Undergraduates do not
have the real knowledge to evalu
ate teaching," he said, adding that
a teacher's showmanship or the
difficulty of the material covered
may influence student opinion.
University President Donald
Kennedy's announcement of the

programs and proposed changes
in appointing faculty members is
"pretty revolutionary," Bennett
said.
Stanford is "moving into the
limelight" with its new plans to
improve undergraduate teaching,
Wilkinson said.
Bennett said he believes an
increased focus on teaching
throughout the country would be
a positive change. "The adminis
tration (at Yale) likes to encour
age good teaching, but does not
[make promotions] based on
teaching ability," he said.
Justin Harmon, director of
communication at Princeton, said

he has seen an increase in public
discussion of teaching recently. "A
number of research universities
are looking now at balancing
research and teaching," Harmon
said. "Princeton is among them."
Princeton is offering awards
for imaginative teaching and
offering a fellowship to reward
senior faculty who would like to
spend more time on teaching, he
said.
Wilkinson said an increase in
attention toward teaching at
research universities is a nation
wide trend, but added that Stan
ford's announcement is "spectac
ular."
