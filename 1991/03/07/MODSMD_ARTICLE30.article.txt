# Students to attend national public outreach conference
## 
### Marci Shore 
As Dead Week approaches, many students will be
busy this weekend doing term papers and problem
sets. But a group of about 25 will travel down south
today to New Orleans to do something cool.
Members of various campus groups will be
attending a national public service conference spon
sored by the Campus Outreach Opportunity League,
known as COOL for short.
The Minnesota-based organization was started in
1984 and sponsors annual student-run conferences
on community service and human relations.
The Stanford contingent includes members of the
Black Student Union, Stanford Students Speaking
About Race and Culture, the Spoon Hunger Relief
Network and various tutoring programs. Some stu
dents attended the conference last year; others said
they became involved mainly through word-of
mouth.
The four-day conference is titled "Open Minds
Open Doors" and will feature workshops, a jazz show
and a public service opportunities fair.
At an organizational meeting for the trip, Greg
Ricks, multicultural educator for Residential Educa

tion, urged the students to collect information at the
conference on topics such as coalition building, social
change and student activism. Some Stanford stu
dents will also be conducting workshops, he said.
"Community service offers a common ground for
students from all different backgrounds to come
together and work on a variety of issues. There
exists an incredible marriage between public service
and multicultural understanding," he said.
Sophomore Nicole Johnson, member of the BSI
and the Stanford Project on National Service, echoed
his sentiments. "A large part of what [the organiza
tion] is doing is breaking down the stereotype of
community service," she said.
Julie Plaut, a senior, said, "Part of [the organiza
tion's] idea is to take things beyond service and deal
with social change. But the organization is deter
mined not to take a specific political side."
Ricks said he sees the conference as a special
opportunity for Stanford students to interact with
students from other colleges across the country.
The conference espouses no specific political ide
ology or affiliation, said Bill Hoogterp, the league's
executive director. "We consider ourselves pre-pohti
cal," he said.
