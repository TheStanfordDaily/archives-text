# Tree crushes cars

### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Staff Writer 
A 100-foot oak tree split at
its base, toppled a neighboring
tree and crashed down on four
parked cars yesterday after
noon in the Governor's Corner
parking lot.
No one was injured, said
Stanford Police Deputy Tony
Navarra, one of the first offi
cers to arrive at the lot near the
corner of Santa Teresa Street
and Campus Drive West.
Eyewitnesses said both trees
fell shortly before 3:30 p.m.
"Can you imagine if some
body had tried to get in their
car when those trees came
down? My God," said Herb

Granger, a University mainte
nance worker, as he looked at
the foliage-covered cars.
Navarra said, "So many jog
gers run by here that had the
trees fallen the other way while
someone was running by, they
could have been seriously
hurt."
Herb Fong, grounds and
custodial manager for Opera
tions and Maintenance, said
the tree split because of "exten
sive rotting inside." He pointed
to rotting wood in the tree's
exposed interior and to fungi
growth at the base of the tree.
"It would have eventually
fallen down," Fong said of the
150-year-old tree. "It was a
time bomb."
