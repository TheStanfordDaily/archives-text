# INTERMISSION
## THE 						STANFORD DAILY'S REBELLIOUS WEEKLY Pullin' muscles for Michelle II 
### 
BY GOSH, IT'S TRUE. PAULA ABDUL MUST BE A
genius — oppositcs really do attract. Abbott and
Costello. Gere and Roberts. Peanut butter and pickles.
It even applies to relationships. Men and women, for
example. But it goes deeper than that. Most relationships at
Stanford (they do exist, you know) are between an East
Coaster and a West Coaster. No one knows why; it just hap
pens. So where does that leave the Midwesterners? Well,
they've always got their farm animals.
Standing humbly before her with a single, small daisy
(when I say it with flowers, I'm a man of few words), I beg
My True Like Michelle to perpetuate the trend with me. I ler
round, West Coast eyes gaze upon my round, East Coast
body, and she seductively whispers three simple words into
my very excited ear:
"Get in shape."

Whoo-tWiee, talk about getting dissed.
But I knew it was coming. I am a bit pudgy these days,
deep in that East Coast put-on-ten-pounds-for-winter rut,
and that's no way to impress Michelle. Hell, I'm so out of
shape, those Ford Center water fountains don't even get
turned on when I stand in front of them.
I'm surprised they even let me into California looking
like I do; Qdifornians usually cry out "Grody!" at the first
sign of flab. You know what they say: No West for the reary.
Yes, "fit and firm" is the universal West Coast style.
(Except for pizza — insert "pineapple and Canadian
bacon") And whether you're like wire or, like, wider, the
outsider (outsize-r?) soon feels the need to fit in, accent on
fit.
Thus, all for Michelle, I begin my descent into health.
And the first thing to change is diet. I grew up on junk food;
I'll miss junk food. Pretzel sticks. Potato sticks. Pixie Stix.
Smarties. Dum-Dums. Cheez Whiz. Cheez Doodles. Cheez
Puffs. Cocoa Puffs. Fudgesicles. Doo Dads. Pringles.
Twinkies. Whole milk. (Only in California is whole milk
considered a dessert) Fluffernutters. I used to live on
Fluffernutters. Californians don't even know what Fluff is.
They epitomize it, sure. They just don't know what it is.
And what delicacies do I sample in return? Sprouts.
Yogurt. Granola. Berries. Leaves. Twigs. Anything as long as
it's naturally tasteless. Northern Californians take the name
"NoCal" way too religiously.
But it's breakfast that I'll miss the most. Ever since I was
old enough to grab things from supermarket shelves and
stuff them under my jacket, I've chosen my cereals based on
three qualities: the name, the free prize inside and the tele
vision commercial character. Now, all three are jeopardized.
I'm giving up Super Honey Smacks, Smurfberry Crunch
and Chocolate-Frosted Sugar Bombs for ... Mueslix. I'm
giving up Wacky Wall Walkers ("Collect all 8 colors!"), Bak
ing Soda Submarine Divers and Secret Spy Rub-off Games
for yogurt coupons. Worst of all, I'm giving up Dig'em,
Lucky, Tony, Toucan and that silly Rabbit for Wilfred Brim
ley.
Food was easy. Exercise is tougher, but more important.
I've already discussed the benefits of being an athlete.
Health. Babes. Enough influence over alumni donations to
usurp the best housing on campus for your fraternity.
With this in mind, I try swimming: good for the legs,
chest and buttocks. But I see two types of older swimmers
at Stanford pools: obese 70-year old women who take up
the entire lane treading water in slow motion, and scrawny,
bald 30-year old men with black moustaches and bodies
that couldn't handle the strain of a real exercise.
1 don't want to end up as one of those men in 10 years.
And I sure don't want to end up as one of those women in
50 years. Thus I decide to live deGuerre-free life.
So I try skiing: good for the back, thighs and buttocks.
But after a day of hopeless, helpless haplessness, I realize 1
lack three essentials for proper skiing: 1) No lip balm.
What's the use of finally being healthy enough to kiss
Michelle if I leave half my lips in a freeze-dried, wind-burnt,
bloody clump on the slope? Besides, at this rate I'll never get
that "Suzy Chapstick" endorsement deal. 2) No hot pink
and blue day-glo outfit. After a day watching other skiiers,
I'm positive that's all you really need to ski well. 3) No snow.
This is key. Or it was, up until about a week ago. Now I'm
looking for another excuse.
So I try aerobics: good for the arms, legs and - again! -
buttocks; I'm getting the strange feeling that everything
works out in the end. But if I have to resort to aerobics, then
I'm really stretching it.
So I consider boxing: good for the arms and chest. Not
as good for the face. There must be something better than
this Slam-Fist diet program.
So I try skateboarding. I put on some Southern Califor
nia poser-clothes, grow my hair out to loelsteinesque pro
portions, get really blond and skinny and gangly-looking as
if I'm into that weirdo puberty thing, and hang out with my
gang in front of the bookstore, muttering "Don't ask me
nuttin", I just skateboard here," to passers-by. But I don't feel
healthy. I feel like a dip.
Finally, I try running. I dig through my closet and find
my old high school running shoes. "Lies! Lies!" my shoes
shout at me as I wipe the dust off of them. Their sarcastic


Chris Harris
Thank God
for Harris!
tongues flap at me, "You ain't a run
ner! It's a lie! Lies! Lieff..l slip each
one on, muffling their taunts, and
head for the Dish, remembering the
good ol' days when "Welp, gotta run!"
was only a figure of speech.
As I climb through the gate, who
should catch up and overtake me, but
My True Like Michelle. "Hi!" I say,
sniffing and sucking in my gut and
raising my arms a little so that she can

smell just how in shape I am. "I was
just taking my daily run up to the
Dish."
"Lfff! ... Lifffl! ..." I casually
stomp really hard, clear my throat,
and smile back at Michelle. She gives
me a weird look, then keeps jogging.
About 30 feet closer to the hill, I
pass Michelle already on her way back
down. She gives me an even weirder
look as I wonder if I should pick up
the pace.
Whoo-whee, talk about getting
dished.
Finally, I get back home, cursing
the wise-ass who made up the term

"fun run,"and look in the mirror. Not
only am I not any skinnier, but I've got
that sickly yellow look from too much
exertion. Great. Paunch and Jaundice.
Sounds like I'm in the middle of a bad
"CHiPs" parody.
Safe at home, I reconsider this
whole "health and fitness" trend.
Maybe it'll pass. And I'd hate to be
caught healthy if that happens.
The more I rationalize, the more
I'm sure that extra pounds will soon
be the"in" thing. After all, next to
today's "lean" look, "out of shape" is
certainly much more hip. And more
thigh. And more stomach ...

So I consider boxing:
good for the arms and
chest. Not as good for
the face.

Anyway, I'm not out of shape. A
circle's a shape. And people call me a
square every day of my life.
So do not despair, ye miss-fits of
the California Way! There may yet
come a dav when even we find our lit
tle niche at Stanford. Or crevice. Or

chasm.
Besides, someday soon I know
Michelle will come around and take
me — all of me — for who I am. One
crisp evening, she'll stop by and hold
me close. She'll stare into my little
piggy eyes, moving slowly forward.
"Little Mermaid" music will swell in
the background, and ... and ...
Whoo-whee, talk about getting
kissed.

Lies! Lies! Chris Harris is actually
pretty skinny. He is also, unlike some
other humor columnists, secure enough
not to need to change his column title
and picture every week.

good ol' days when "Welp, gotta run!"
was only a figure of speech.
As I climb through the gate, who
should catch up and overtake me, but
My True Like Michelle. "Hi!" I say,
sniffing and sucking in my gut and
raising my arms a little so that she can

smell just how in shape I am. "I was
just taking my daily run up to the
Dish."
"Lfff! ... Lifffl! ..." I casually
stomp really hard, clear my throat,
and smile back at Michelle. She gives
me a weird look, then keeps jogging.
About 30 feet closer to the hill, I
pass Michelle already on her way back
down. She gives me an even weirder
look as I wonder if I should pick up
the pace.
Whoo-whee, talk about getting
dished.
Finally, I get back home, cursing
the wise-ass who made up the term

"fun run,"and look in the mirror. Not
only am I not any skinnier, but I've got
that sickly yellow look from too much
exertion. Great. Paunch and Jaundice.

The more I rationalize, the more

today's "lean" look, "out of shape" is
certainly much more hip. And more
thigh. And more stomach ...

So I consider boxing:
good for the arms and
chest. Not as good for
the face.

Anyway, I'm not out of shape. A
circle's a shape. And people call me a
square every day of my life.
So do not despair, ye miss-fits of
the California Way! There may yet
come a dav when even we find our lit

chasm.
Besides, someday soon I know
Michelle will come around and take
me — all of me — for who I am. One
crisp evening, she'll stop by and hold

Lies! Lies! Chris Harris is actually

BY GOSH, IT'S TRUE. PAULA ABDUL MUST BE A
genius — oppositcs really do attract. Abbott and
Costello. Gere and Roberts. Peanut butter and pickles.
It even applies to relationships. Men and women, for
example. But it goes deeper than that. Most relationships at
Stanford (they do exist, you know) are between an East
Coaster and a West Coaster. No one knows why; it just hap
pens. So where does that leave the Midwesterners? Well,
they've always got their farm animals.
Standing humbly before her with a single, small daisy
(when I say it with flowers, I'm a man of few words), I beg
My True Like Michelle to perpetuate the trend with me. I ler
round, West Coast eyes gaze upon my round, East Coast
body, and she seductively whispers three simple words into
my very excited ear:
"Get in shape."

Whoo-tWiee, talk about getting dissed.
But I knew it was coming. I am a bit pudgy these days,
deep in that East Coast put-on-ten-pounds-for-winter rut,
and that's no way to impress Michelle. Hell, I'm so out of
shape, those Ford Center water fountains don't even get
turned on when I stand in front of them.
I'm surprised they even let me into California looking
like I do; Qdifornians usually cry out "Grody!" at the first
sign of flab. You know what they say: No West for the reary.
Yes, "fit and firm" is the universal West Coast style.
(Except for pizza — insert "pineapple and Canadian
bacon") And whether you're like wire or, like, wider, the
outsider (outsize-r?) soon feels the need to fit in, accent on
fit.
Thus, all for Michelle, I begin my descent into health.
And the first thing to change is diet. I grew up on junk food;
I'll miss junk food. Pretzel sticks. Potato sticks. Pixie Stix.
Smarties. Dum-Dums. Cheez Whiz. Cheez Doodles. Cheez
Puffs. Cocoa Puffs. Fudgesicles. Doo Dads. Pringles.
Twinkies. Whole milk. (Only in California is whole milk
considered a dessert) Fluffernutters. I used to live on
Fluffernutters. Californians don't even know what Fluff is.
They epitomize it, sure. They just don't know what it is.
And what delicacies do I sample in return? Sprouts.
Yogurt. Granola. Berries. Leaves. Twigs. Anything as long as
it's naturally tasteless. Northern Californians take the name
"NoCal" way too religiously.
But it's breakfast that I'll miss the most. Ever since I was
old enough to grab things from supermarket shelves and
stuff them under my jacket, I've chosen my cereals based on
three qualities: the name, the free prize inside and the tele
vision commercial character. Now, all three are jeopardized.
I'm giving up Super Honey Smacks, Smurfberry Crunch
and Chocolate-Frosted Sugar Bombs for ... Mueslix. I'm
giving up Wacky Wall Walkers ("Collect all 8 colors!"), Bak
ing Soda Submarine Divers and Secret Spy Rub-off Games
for yogurt coupons. Worst of all, I'm giving up Dig'em,
Lucky, Tony, Toucan and that silly Rabbit for Wilfred Brim
ley.
Food was easy. Exercise is tougher, but more important.
I've already discussed the benefits of being an athlete.
Health. Babes. Enough influence over alumni donations to
usurp the best housing on campus for your fraternity.
With this in mind, I try swimming: good for the legs,
chest and buttocks. But I see two types of older swimmers
at Stanford pools: obese 70-year old women who take up
the entire lane treading water in slow motion, and scrawny,
bald 30-year old men with black moustaches and bodies
that couldn't handle the strain of a real exercise.
1 don't want to end up as one of those men in 10 years.
And I sure don't want to end up as one of those women in
50 years. Thus I decide to live deGuerre-free life.
So I try skiing: good for the back, thighs and buttocks.
But after a day of hopeless, helpless haplessness, I realize 1
lack three essentials for proper skiing: 1) No lip balm.
What's the use of finally being healthy enough to kiss
Michelle if I leave half my lips in a freeze-dried, wind-burnt,
bloody clump on the slope? Besides, at this rate I'll never get
that "Suzy Chapstick" endorsement deal. 2) No hot pink
and blue day-glo outfit. After a day watching other skiiers,
I'm positive that's all you really need to ski well. 3) No snow.
This is key. Or it was, up until about a week ago. Now I'm
looking for another excuse.
So I try aerobics: good for the arms, legs and - again! -
buttocks; I'm getting the strange feeling that everything
works out in the end. But if I have to resort to aerobics, then
I'm really stretching it.
So I consider boxing: good for the arms and chest. Not
as good for the face. There must be something better than
this Slam-Fist diet program.
So I try skateboarding. I put on some Southern Califor
nia poser-clothes, grow my hair out to loelsteinesque pro
portions, get really blond and skinny and gangly-looking as
if I'm into that weirdo puberty thing, and hang out with my
gang in front of the bookstore, muttering "Don't ask me
nuttin", I just skateboard here," to passers-by. But I don't feel
healthy. I feel like a dip.
Finally, I try running. I dig through my closet and find
