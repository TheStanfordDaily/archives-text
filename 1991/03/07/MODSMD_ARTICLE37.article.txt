□ Tatoos are
no longer
taboo.

When you think
of tattoos,
what comes to
mind?
Hell's Angels. Harley
Davidsons. ZZ Top. Big,
burly, bearded men who
drive from town to town on
their bikes and hang out in
bars. Dark, seedy bars. With
mud wrestling competitions.
How about Stanford students? That's
right, Stanford students.
With tattoos?
Impossible. Unfathomable. Ridiculous.
Think again.
A surprisingly large number of Farm
dwellers are crossing into the realm of the
"biker world." And an even more surpris
ingly large number of these "daring"
image-breakers are women.
So what's the deal? Are these former
valedictorians and National Merit Scholars
simply rebelling against their virtuous
childhoods? Against society? Against tradi
tion?
Or is there something more to it?
To find out, all you need to do is ask.
Plenty of people are willing — even excited
— to talk about tattoos. Especially their
own.
As Laura Schiff found out. Schiff, a
senior majoring in communication, is in

the proccss of putting together a five
minute documentary film about women
who have tattoos. And she says she had no
trouble finding people to talk.
"It's incredible how many people on
this campus have tattoos," Schiff said.
"When I was trying to find people to
include in my film, 1 never had to go very
far to look for them. I found people so
readily who fit the image I wanted to por
tray."
Schiff found that getting tattoos is "not
just a form of rebellion, or a form of beau
tification either. People are taking their
ideas and literally incorporating them into
their bodies, frequently for very strong
political or ideological reasons.... People
take their tattoos very seriously. Everyone I
spoke to thought long and hard about it —
their tattoos are very meaningful to them."
Indeed, though tattoos themselves are
only skin-deep, the reasons people get
them run far deeper. People usually decide
to get tattoos for very personal reasons,
and the opinions of others are disregarded
as inconsequential.
In fact, some students got tattoos
specifically to show that they don't care
what others think.
"I thought of it as a way to challenge
stereotypes," said junior Jen Sey, who has a
flower tattooed on her ankle. "People just
generally assume things about people with
tattoos and I don't really fit any of them.
"Some of my friends from home were
pretty shocked, because I've changed quite
a bit," Sey continued. "All they remember is
me in my high school picture wearing a
cashmere sweater and pearls."
Junior Monikka Stallworth "doesn't
really worry" about what others think
about her tattoo, which is a flower and a

heart located on the front of her hip.
Besides, she points out, "It's not in a
spot where it can be seen — if I want
people to know, they will. If not, they
won't. It's not like everyone can see it."
This strategic placing of tattoos so
they can be selectively seen — or not
seen — is common. Freshman
Christopher Sey put his tattoo on his
shoulder blade so it could be hidden
under his tank top in gymnastic meets.
He says he also chose his shoulder so
he didn't "have to look at it all the time
— just in case I start thinking, T
messed up.' "
But junior Liz Noteware, on the
other hand, wants people to see her
tattoo.
"I wanted it to show with real
clothes," said Noteware, "which is why
I didn't want to get it on my butt or my
hip — even ankle tattoos are too
inconspicuous."
Noteware has a tattoo of a fist
inside a female gender symbol on her
right shoulder blade, so "other people
can see it." In fact, she's "started to buy
all kinds of tattoo-friendly clothing so
it will show."
And how do people react to seeing a
tattoo on their friend's previously
flesh-colored body part? In different
ways, yes, but all within a range of
reactions.
Jen Sey, for one, says she's encoun
tered disbelief. "People say it looks like
it was drawn in with Crayola Markers.
The first day I got it, one of my friends
tried to rub it off. He just kept rubbing
it and saying, 'It's not coming off!" I
said, 'You idiot, it's a tattoo.'"
Senior Jennifer Pearson agrees, and
adds that women seem more receptive
to the idea of tattoos. "My female
friends are all really supportive," Pear
son began, "but sometimes people —
mostly guys — just come up and touch
it and say 'What did you do that for?"'
"Women think it's pretty cool,"
agreed Noteware, "but men are always
like, 'It'll hurt too much.' They're
pretty wimpy about that kind of
thing."
This gender-specific response was
almost exactly echoed by len Sey, who
finds that "guys don't like it so much,
but girls always think it's cool. My
male friends said 'I liked you better
before.' I told them to get used to it."
Of course, not all men feel this way.
Obviously Christopher Sey doesn t
mind tattoos. And freshman Jason
Cohen, who has a rose tattoo himself,
thinks tattoos — especially on women
— are "excellent."
Many students also find that people
are genuinely interested in their tat
toos, even intrigued by them. Stall

worth says "Half of my friends —
mostly women — are really jealous.
They really want one but they aren't
bold enough to do it."
Which brings up the question:
What gives people the courage to actu
ally go into a tattoo parlor and choose
the design that will adorn their bodies
for the rest of their lives?
For most students it wasn't com
pletely a spur-of-the-moment, throw
caution-to-the-winds decision. They
had thought about getting a tattoo for
a long time, put it off for a long time,
and then finally just done it when the
occasion arose.
"It wasn't a rebellious act or any
thing," said Stallworth. "A few of my
friends had gotten tattoos a year or so
ago, and I thought they were really
pretty, but I was just too freaked out to
do it. Then last summer, me and my
friend made a pact with each other

that we would get them over Christ
mas break. So we both went. It was a
friendship thing."
One freshman, who asked not to be
identified in case her parents — who
"don't have a clue" — read the article,
also got her tattoo with a friend.
"I went in to hold my friend's hand
as she got a second one and ended up
getting one myself," she said. "I walked
out twice before I did it. I lied about
my age — I was only 17, and you have
to be 18. I smoked three cigarettes —
even though I don't smoke — and I
had them sterilize the needle twice in
front of me."
Pearson, who got her tattoo several
weeks ago had "wanted to do it tor a
long time and finally got the inspira
tion and the guts ... I think the war
pushed me over the edge."
Pearson designed her tattoo to
"incorporate certain symbols which

were meaningful to me." Her tattoo
depicts a dove flying over a female gen
der sign which encircles a globe with
purple continents, representing
women's suffrage.
Many Stanford students, like Pear
son, have chosen to design their own
tattoos, incorporating symbols such as
doves, peace signs and yin-yangs.
"I didn't want to just get a heart,"
one freshman said, "so I got my own
insignia, which combines a peace sign
inside a heart with a falling star com
ing out of the bottom and a flower
growing out of the top. To me it repre
sents love, peace, beauty and hope."
However, not everyone chooses
meaningful designs for their tattoos.
Another freshman, who chose not to
be identified, said she "wanted some
thing pretty, something feminine. I
didn't want a symbol. I didn't want it
to stand for anything. I just wanted it

for myself."
At Belmont Tattoo Emporium (see
story, page 3), which seems to be the
most common place for Stanford stu
dents to have tattoos done, boards of
sample designs cover the faded pink
walls of the waiting room.
The tattoos range from huge illus
trations shaped to cover one's entire
back and buttocks, to tiny pictures
smaller than a thumbnail. And the
designs themselves run the gamut
from Elmer Fudd and flower bouquets
to grim reapers on Harleys and naked,
masturbating women.
Apparently, these designs adorn the
bodies of many Stanford students, as
the Belmont store's tattoo artist Dave
McLeod said he's "done a lot of people
from Stanford — a couple of women
— the [men's] swim team — one of
the football players."
And now for the big question: Does

it hurt?
The consensus among those inter
viewed is that yes, it does hurt. But the
final product is well worth the fleeting
pain.
Stallworth, for instance, found tat
tooing "really painful," but she looked
at it as "kind of like ear piercing. You
know it'll hurt, but you want it so bad,
that you don't mind."
Noteware, on the other hand, com
pared tattooing to childbirth. "It was
45 minutes of the worst pain ever. I did
Lamaze breathing to get through it.
But the minute it was over, I was ready
to get another one."
"Tattoos are very addictive," Note
ware added, "I'm trying to resist the
urge to get a lot more."
But, no matter how happy they are
with their tattoos, most students find
that their parents don't share this
excitement.

only skin-deep, the reasons people get
them run far deeper. People usually decide
to get tattoos for very personal reasons,
and the opinions of others are disregarded
as inconsequential.
In fact, some students got tattoos
specifically to show that they don't care
what others think.
"I thought of it as a way to challenge
stereotypes," said junior Jen Sey, who has a
flower tattooed on her ankle. "People just
generally assume things about people with
tattoos and I don't really fit any of them.
"Some of my friends from home were
pretty shocked, because I've changed quite
a bit," Sey continued. "All they remember is
me in my high school picture wearing a
cashmere sweater and pearls."
Junior Monikka Stallworth "doesn't
really worry" about what others think
about her tattoo, which is a flower and a

heart located on the front of her hip.
Besides, she points out, "It's not in a
spot where it can be seen — if I want
people to know, they will. If not, they
won't. It's not like everyone can see it."
This strategic placing of tattoos so
they can be selectively seen — or not
seen — is common. Freshman
Christopher Sey put his tattoo on his
shoulder blade so it could be hidden
under his tank top in gymnastic meets.
He says he also chose his shoulder so
he didn't "have to look at it all the time
— just in case I start thinking, T
messed up.' "
But junior Liz Noteware, on the
other hand, wants people to see her
tattoo.
"I wanted it to show with real
clothes," said Noteware, "which is why
I didn't want to get it on my butt or my
hip — even ankle tattoos are too
inconspicuous."
Noteware has a tattoo of a fist
inside a female gender symbol on her
right shoulder blade, so "other people
can see it." In fact, she's "started to buy
all kinds of tattoo-friendly clothing so
it will show."
And how do people react to seeing a
tattoo on their friend's previously
flesh-colored body part? In different
ways, yes, but all within a range of
reactions.
Jen Sey, for one, says she's encoun
tered disbelief. "People say it looks like
it was drawn in with Crayola Markers.
The first day I got it, one of my friends
tried to rub it off. He just kept rubbing
it and saying, 'It's not coming off!" I
said, 'You idiot, it's a tattoo.'"
Senior Jennifer Pearson agrees, and
adds that women seem more receptive
to the idea of tattoos. "My female
friends are all really supportive," Pear
son began, "but sometimes people —
mostly guys — just come up and touch
it and say 'What did you do that for?"'
"Women think it's pretty cool,"
agreed Noteware, "but men are always
like, 'It'll hurt too much.' They're
pretty wimpy about that kind of
thing."
This gender-specific response was
almost exactly echoed by len Sey, who
finds that "guys don't like it so much,
but girls always think it's cool. My
male friends said 'I liked you better
before.' I told them to get used to it."
Of course, not all men feel this way.
Obviously Christopher Sey doesn t
mind tattoos. And freshman Jason
Cohen, who has a rose tattoo himself,
thinks tattoos — especially on women
— are "excellent."
Many students also find that people
are genuinely interested in their tat
toos, even intrigued by them. Stall

worth says "Half of my friends —
mostly women — are really jealous.
They really want one but they aren't
bold enough to do it."
Which brings up the question:
What gives people the courage to actu
ally go into a tattoo parlor and choose
the design that will adorn their bodies
for the rest of their lives?
For most students it wasn't com
pletely a spur-of-the-moment, throw
caution-to-the-winds decision. They
had thought about getting a tattoo for
a long time, put it off for a long time,
and then finally just done it when the
occasion arose.
"It wasn't a rebellious act or any
thing," said Stallworth. "A few of my
friends had gotten tattoos a year or so
ago, and I thought they were really
pretty, but I was just too freaked out to
do it. Then last summer, me and my
friend made a pact with each other

that we would get them over Christ
mas break. So we both went. It was a
friendship thing."
One freshman, who asked not to be
identified in case her parents — who
"don't have a clue" — read the article,
also got her tattoo with a friend.
"I went in to hold my friend's hand
as she got a second one and ended up
getting one myself," she said. "I walked
out twice before I did it. I lied about
my age — I was only 17, and you have
to be 18. I smoked three cigarettes —
even though I don't smoke — and I
had them sterilize the needle twice in
front of me."
Pearson, who got her tattoo several
weeks ago had "wanted to do it tor a
long time and finally got the inspira
tion and the guts ... I think the war
pushed me over the edge."
Pearson designed her tattoo to
"incorporate certain symbols which

were meaningful to me." Her tattoo
depicts a dove flying over a female gen
der sign which encircles a globe with
purple continents, representing
women's suffrage.
Many Stanford students, like Pear
son, have chosen to design their own
tattoos, incorporating symbols such as
doves, peace signs and yin-yangs.
"I didn't want to just get a heart,"
one freshman said, "so I got my own
insignia, which combines a peace sign
inside a heart with a falling star com
ing out of the bottom and a flower
growing out of the top. To me it repre
sents love, peace, beauty and hope."
However, not everyone chooses
meaningful designs for their tattoos.
Another freshman, who chose not to
be identified, said she "wanted some
thing pretty, something feminine. I
didn't want a symbol. I didn't want it
to stand for anything. I just wanted it

for myself."
At Belmont Tattoo Emporium (see
story, page 3), which seems to be the
most common place for Stanford stu
dents to have tattoos done, boards of
sample designs cover the faded pink
walls of the waiting room.
The tattoos range from huge illus
trations shaped to cover one's entire
back and buttocks, to tiny pictures
smaller than a thumbnail. And the
designs themselves run the gamut
from Elmer Fudd and flower bouquets
to grim reapers on Harleys and naked,
masturbating women.
Apparently, these designs adorn the
bodies of many Stanford students, as
the Belmont store's tattoo artist Dave
McLeod said he's "done a lot of people
from Stanford — a couple of women
— the [men's] swim team — one of
the football players."
And now for the big question: Does

it hurt?
The consensus among those inter
viewed is that yes, it does hurt. But the
final product is well worth the fleeting
pain.
Stallworth, for instance, found tat
tooing "really painful," but she looked
at it as "kind of like ear piercing. You
know it'll hurt, but you want it so bad,
that you don't mind."
Noteware, on the other hand, com
pared tattooing to childbirth. "It was
45 minutes of the worst pain ever. I did
Lamaze breathing to get through it.
But the minute it was over, I was ready
to get another one."
"Tattoos are very addictive," Note
ware added, "I'm trying to resist the
urge to get a lot more."
But, no matter how happy they are
with their tattoos, most students find
that their parents don't share this
excitement.
□ Tatoos are
no longer
taboo.

When you think
of tattoos,
what comes to
mind?
Hell's Angels. Harley
Davidsons. ZZ Top. Big,
burly, bearded men who
drive from town to town on
their bikes and hang out in
bars. Dark, seedy bars. With
mud wrestling competitions.
How about Stanford students? That's
right, Stanford students.
With tattoos?
Impossible. Unfathomable. Ridiculous.
Think again.
A surprisingly large number of Farm
dwellers are crossing into the realm of the
"biker world." And an even more surpris
ingly large number of these "daring"
image-breakers are women.
So what's the deal? Are these former
valedictorians and National Merit Scholars
simply rebelling against their virtuous
childhoods? Against society? Against tradi
tion?
Or is there something more to it?
To find out, all you need to do is ask.
Plenty of people are willing — even excited
— to talk about tattoos. Especially their
own.
As Laura Schiff found out. Schiff, a
senior majoring in communication, is in

the proccss of putting together a five
minute documentary film about women
who have tattoos. And she says she had no
trouble finding people to talk.
"It's incredible how many people on
this campus have tattoos," Schiff said.
"When I was trying to find people to
include in my film, 1 never had to go very
far to look for them. I found people so
readily who fit the image I wanted to por
tray."
Schiff found that getting tattoos is "not
just a form of rebellion, or a form of beau
tification either. People are taking their
ideas and literally incorporating them into
their bodies, frequently for very strong
political or ideological reasons.... People
take their tattoos very seriously. Everyone I
spoke to thought long and hard about it —
their tattoos are very meaningful to them."

it will show."
And how do people react to seeing a
tattoo on their friend's previously
flesh-colored body part? In different
ways, yes, but all within a range of
reactions.
Jen Sey, for one, says she's encoun
tered disbelief. "People say it looks like
it was drawn in with Crayola Markers.
The first day I got it, one of my friends
tried to rub it off. He just kept rubbing
it and saying, 'It's not coming off!" I
said, 'You idiot, it's a tattoo.'"
Senior Jennifer Pearson agrees, and
adds that women seem more receptive
to the idea of tattoos. "My female
friends are all really supportive," Pear
son began, "but sometimes people —
mostly guys — just come up and touch
it and say 'What did you do that for?"'
"Women think it's pretty cool,"
agreed Noteware, "but men are always
like, 'It'll hurt too much.' They're
pretty wimpy about that kind of
thing."
This gender-specific response was
almost exactly echoed by len Sey, who
finds that "guys don't like it so much,
but girls always think it's cool. My
male friends said 'I liked you better
before.' I told them to get used to it."
Of course, not all men feel this way.
Obviously Christopher Sey doesn t
mind tattoos. And freshman Jason
Cohen, who has a rose tattoo himself,
thinks tattoos — especially on women
— are "excellent."
Many students also find that people
are genuinely interested in their tat
toos, even intrigued by them. Stall

worth says "Half of my friends —
mostly women — are really jealous.
They really want one but they aren't
bold enough to do it."
Which brings up the question:
What gives people the courage to actu
ally go into a tattoo parlor and choose
the design that will adorn their bodies
for the rest of their lives?
For most students it wasn't com
pletely a spur-of-the-moment, throw
caution-to-the-winds decision. They
had thought about getting a tattoo for
a long time, put it off for a long time,
and then finally just done it when the
occasion arose.
"It wasn't a rebellious act or any
thing," said Stallworth. "A few of my
friends had gotten tattoos a year or so
ago, and I thought they were really
pretty, but I was just too freaked out to
do it. Then last summer, me and my
friend made a pact with each other

that we would get them over Christ
mas break. So we both went. It was a
friendship thing."
One freshman, who asked not to be
identified in case her parents — who
"don't have a clue" — read the article,
also got her tattoo with a friend.
"I went in to hold my friend's hand
as she got a second one and ended up
getting one myself," she said. "I walked
out twice before I did it. I lied about
my age — I was only 17, and you have
to be 18. I smoked three cigarettes —
even though I don't smoke — and I
had them sterilize the needle twice in
front of me."
Pearson, who got her tattoo several
weeks ago had "wanted to do it tor a
long time and finally got the inspira
tion and the guts ... I think the war
pushed me over the edge."
Pearson designed her tattoo to
"incorporate certain symbols which

were meaningful to me." Her tattoo
depicts a dove flying over a female gen
der sign which encircles a globe with
purple continents, representing
women's suffrage.
Many Stanford students, like Pear
son, have chosen to design their own
tattoos, incorporating symbols such as
doves, peace signs and yin-yangs.
"I didn't want to just get a heart,"
one freshman said, "so I got my own
insignia, which combines a peace sign
inside a heart with a falling star com
ing out of the bottom and a flower
growing out of the top. To me it repre
sents love, peace, beauty and hope."
However, not everyone chooses
meaningful designs for their tattoos.
Another freshman, who chose not to
be identified, said she "wanted some
thing pretty, something feminine. I
didn't want a symbol. I didn't want it
to stand for anything. I just wanted it

for myself."
At Belmont Tattoo Emporium (see
story, page 3), which seems to be the
most common place for Stanford stu
dents to have tattoos done, boards of
sample designs cover the faded pink
walls of the waiting room.
The tattoos range from huge illus
trations shaped to cover one's entire
back and buttocks, to tiny pictures
smaller than a thumbnail. And the
designs themselves run the gamut
from Elmer Fudd and flower bouquets
to grim reapers on Harleys and naked,
masturbating women.
Apparently, these designs adorn the
bodies of many Stanford students, as
the Belmont store's tattoo artist Dave
McLeod said he's "done a lot of people
from Stanford — a couple of women
— the [men's] swim team — one of
the football players."
And now for the big question: Does

it hurt?
The consensus among those inter
viewed is that yes, it does hurt. But the
final product is well worth the fleeting
pain.
Stallworth, for instance, found tat
tooing "really painful," but she looked
at it as "kind of like ear piercing. You
know it'll hurt, but you want it so bad,
that you don't mind."
Noteware, on the other hand, com
pared tattooing to childbirth. "It was
45 minutes of the worst pain ever. I did
Lamaze breathing to get through it.
But the minute it was over, I was ready
to get another one."
"Tattoos are very addictive," Note
ware added, "I'm trying to resist the
urge to get a lot more."
But, no matter how happy they are
with their tattoos, most students find
that their parents don't share this
excitement.
