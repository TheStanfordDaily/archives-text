no longer
taboo.

When you think
of tattoos,
what comes to
mind?
Hell's Angels. Harley
Davidsons. ZZ Top. Big,
burly, bearded men who
drive from town to town on
their bikes and hang out in
bars. Dark, seedy bars. With
mud wrestling competitions.
How about Stanford students? That's
right, Stanford students.
With tattoos?
Impossible. Unfathomable. Ridiculous.
Think again.
A surprisingly large number of Farm
dwellers are crossing into the realm of the
"biker world." And an even more surpris
ingly large number of these "daring"
image-breakers are women.
So what's the deal? Are these former
valedictorians and National Merit Scholars
simply rebelling against their virtuous
childhoods? Against society? Against tradi
tion?
Or is there something more to it?
To find out, all you need to do is ask.
Plenty of people are willing — even excited
— to talk about tattoos. Especially their
own.
As Laura Schiff found out. Schiff, a
senior majoring in communication, is in

the proccss of putting together a five
minute documentary film about women
who have tattoos. And she says she had no
trouble finding people to talk.
"It's incredible how many people on
this campus have tattoos," Schiff said.
"When I was trying to find people to
include in my film, 1 never had to go very
far to look for them. I found people so
readily who fit the image I wanted to por
tray."
Schiff found that getting tattoos is "not
just a form of rebellion, or a form of beau
tification either. People are taking their
ideas and literally incorporating them into
their bodies, frequently for very strong
political or ideological reasons.... People
take their tattoos very seriously. Everyone I
spoke to thought long and hard about it —
their tattoos are very meaningful to them."
Indeed, though tattoos themselves are
only skin-deep, the reasons people get
them run far deeper. People usually decide
to get tattoos for very personal reasons,
and the opinions of others are disregarded
as inconsequential.
In fact, some students got tattoos
specifically to show that they don't care
what others think.
"I thought of it as a way to challenge
stereotypes," said junior Jen Sey, who has a
flower tattooed on her ankle. "People just
generally assume things about people with
tattoos and I don't really fit any of them.
"Some of my friends from home were
pretty shocked, because I've changed quite
a bit," Sey continued. "All they remember is
me in my high school picture wearing a
cashmere sweater and pearls."
Junior Monikka Stallworth "doesn't
really worry" about what others think
about her tattoo, which is a flower and a
