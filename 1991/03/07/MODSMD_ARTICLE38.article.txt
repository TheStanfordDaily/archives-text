# FROM THE EDITORS

We know what you're thinking.
You want to know if we, June and Mara, the daring duo, the fearless
purveyors of truth and justice, the editors who will do anything for a story,
got tattoos.
After all, you think, we investigated people's love lives, we went cafe
hopping and we told you all about our teddy bears.
Of course we got tattoos. Right?
We're not telling..
Look, we know you're dying to know, but so are our parents — so no
dice.
Sorry.
However, as compensation for keeping that secret from you, our ador
ing readers, we will share with you something else: stuff to do.
Cool beans.
Since we're feeling pretty rebellious (don't read into this, it won't help),
the things we'd do this weekend all have something to do with, well, being
rebellious.
In our effort to snub society's norms, we'd see "Spring Awakening," a
play that was banned for 20 years after it was first released, due to its
"taboo" subjects, (that was taboo not tattoo) The Drama Department is
presenting this show on its 100 th anniversary, and yet much of its subject
matter is still appropriate. The show will be performed at the Nitery at 8
p.m. Wednesday through Saturday, with an 11 p.m. show on Friday.
To start off the actual weekend, we'd go over to the Palo Alto Square on
Saturday or Sunday to catch one of the two exclusive showings of "Berke
ley in the Sixties".
This feature-length documentary received an Academy Award nomina
tion and is supposed to be full of lots of cool riots and stuff. It only plays
at the Square at 11 a.m., but is being featured in San lose all week, so you
can sleep late, if need be.
Then, later that night, for a really bizarre change, we'd check out
Momix, an innovative modern dance troupe that uses light, sound and
each other's bodies to create their acts.
On Friday and Saturday, at 8 p.m. and midnight, Ensemble '91 will
perform their "One Act Festival," which involves what they call "Rough
and Immediate Theater."
Sounds intriguing, does it not?
One other thing we'd do though it's not all that strange, is go to Memo
rial Auditorium to hear John Lee Hooker, the legendary blues guitarist on
Monday.
An absolute must-see, Hooker has awed greats such as the Rolling
Stones and Eric Clapton and truly defines soul. Tickets are 15$ with SUID.
A few words for the road ...
First of all, we'd like to bring to your attention the fact that two articles
in today's Intermission make a reference to Marshmallow Fluff.
Also, farewell and fare-forward to Chris Harris, our beloved punster (of
"Michelle, The Girl I Like," fame). Better watch your back, 'cause we just
might rope you into sticking around and writing for another quarter
(what's Washington got that Intermission doesn't?)
And, if you found yourself shocked by today's tattoo story, or indig
nant, or perhaps a wee bit self-righteous — think back to Joel Stein's col
umn last week.
It began, "No one does anything shocking anymore. Nothing outra
geous. Nothing really crazy..
If you read it and said, "Yeah! Ya know, he's right!" then do something
about it.
If your life is boring, do something interesting.
If you feel restrained, let loose.
Be an active participant in your own life.
If you don't, who will?
Think ab6ut it.
