# USW accuses SLAC lab of hiring discrimination
## 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
The University is expected today to
release a response to a United Stanford
Workers grievance over alleged discrimina
tory practices and nepotism at the Stanford
Synchotron Radiation Laboratory.
The grievance, which was submitted
more than a week ago to the University's
employee relations office, says the radiation
laboratory is in violation of the union con
tract because it has failed to employ signifi
cant numbers of minorities and women,
according to USW Field Representative
Ruben Serna.
In addition, Serna said preference in hir
ing practices and treatment has been given
to relatives and acquaintances of some lab
oratory workers.
Laboratory administrators denied the
charges. "The grievance is unfounded,"
said Ron Gould, personnel director at the
laboratory.

Gould said the grievance has been
reviewed by employee relations and he
expects the University report to discredit
the USW's claims.
The radiation laboratory is affiliated
with the Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter but is independent from it.
The grievance states the laboratory
should employ more women and minorities
and provide equal treatment for all 130
workers, 15 of whom are union members,
Serna said.
Laboratory Director Arthur Bienenstock
said the "statistics don't bear up" the accu
sation of discriminatory hiring practices.
Although neither Gould nor Bienenstock
could provide figures, Bienenstock said the
radiation laboratory employs "a significant
number" of women and minorities.
Serna said that of the 15 union mem
bers, one is Chicano/Latino, one is black
and none are women.
One worker, who asked to
remain anonymous, said the labo
ratory is secluded from normal
operating procedures. Job open
ings often are not posted, he said,
adding that some positions are
granted to relatives or acquain
tances of laboratory managers.
"They don't want to recognize
people for their abilities," he said.
Many qualified applicants, the
worker said, are turned away
without consideration.
Another worker, who also
wished to remain anonymous,
said, "I think every worker here
would like to voice a complaint,
but they don't want to say any
thing for fear of losing their job."
Serna also said he thinks many
workers are aware of discrimina
tory practices.
"It's a nice little cozy situa
tion," he said of the laboratory.
"You have to toe the line with the
clique" to stay in managerial
favor, he claimed.
Serna mentioned a survey last
year of all SLAC managers and
employees, including those at the
radiation laboratory, that
reported that SLAC manages
through "threats and intimida
tion." The survey was conducted
by an independent agency.
