# INTERVIEW
## Dave McLeod Wants to Tattoo You 
### June Cohen Mara Winokur 
It's not at all what one
would expect. The
room is bright — if
bare. There are no bikers,
no beers and no brawls.
No dark, wood-paneled
bar lines the wall. The
purpose of the shop is
revealed only by the hun
dreds of drawings posted
on the otherwise bare,
stark walls.
A faint buzzing can be heard
behind a door, and this, combined
with the coffee table adorned with ash
trays and magazines, reminds one of a
dentist's office.
Silence falls over the room as the
drilling stops and the door opens.
Instead of the large, hulking,
bearded man one might expect, a
medium-built man emerges, and
smiles.
His name is Dave McLeod, and he
is the sole tattoo artist at the Belmont
Tattoo Emporium — a place on El
Camino that more and more Stanford
students are becoming familiar with
(see front cover).
McLeod's long black hair is tied
back in a ponytail with a brightly col
ored scarf. Large gold hoops dangle
from both earlobes, and two smaller
hoops pierce his left nostril. Clad in
black jeans and a white T-shirt, Dave
McLeod looks like a high school rebel,
or a pirate.
But his arms, literally covered with
a collage of images, betray his true pro
fession.
The intertwining pictures extend
from hand to shoulder — making it
difficult to distinguish between indi
vidual designs — but upon close
inspection, the vivid pictures become
clear: flowers wrap around sleek pan
thers and tigers on his forearms; a
sparrow hovers in perpetual motion
on his inner arm, forever soaring
towards the sinister skull on his right
bicep. Above his left elbow, the word
"Sweets" is engraved on a billowing
ribbon wrapped around a rose and a
heart; the Golden Gate Bridge adorns
the back of his right hand.
Tattooing requires great artistic
skill and a steady hand; McLeod has

both. Having worked at Belmont Tat
too for five years, McLeod traces pre
designed stencils onto customers' skin
and then engraves the permanent
design with tattoo needles and ink.
McLeod is not a talker; he is a doer.
He's used to people coming in, getting
tattoos and leaving, and he seemed
surprised by our interest in him, his
career, and his somewhat colorful past.
Intermission: How did you decide you
wanted to become a tattoo artist?
David McLeod: Weli, my grandfather
had a lot of tattoos; my father had 'em
too. I've just always been drawing
them. My mom used to go crazy 'cause
I'd come home from school and I'd
have drawn them all up and down my
arm.

The most popular tattoos
people ask for are hearts
and roses... and skulls —
stuff like that— reapers,
you know.

I: When did you get your first real tat
too?
DM: When I was 17. I got Yosemite
Sam tattooed on my arm.
I: Why Yosemite Sam?
DM: He was my favorite cartoon char
acter.
McLeod turns his back to us, fur
rowing his brow as he leans over a
table and copies a tattoo, designed by a
customer, onto carbon paper. He lifts
the image up and, satisfied with the
outcome, sits down, business-like,
positioning himself in front of the
young woman who is seated across
from him.
McLeod presses the newly inked
picture against the woman's lower
stomach, and prepares the needle and
ink to engrave the tattoo.
I: How many tattoos do you have now?
Could you even number them?
DM: Oh, I must have about 100 by
now. I add new ones all the time. My
arms are covered, and I've got some on
my back, some on my arms, some on
my legs and one on my neck.

I: Do you have a favorite?
DM: It's still the first one I had put on.
I: Who tattoos you?
DM: I put 'em on myself mostly.
I: Really?
DM: Sure, 1 do it all the time.
I: Do you have anyone's initials tat
tooed on you?
DM: No ... no ... no one's initials,
just my daughter's name. Her name is
Tanisha — her name is on my back.
I: Does she have any tattoos?
DM: Nah. She's too little — she's only
four!
I: If she wants a tattoo when she gets
older, would you tattoo her?
DM: Sure I would. If she wants one I'll
do it... when she's 18.
I: Why 18?
DM: It's the law.
McLeod sets to work, concentrating
on the picture with an almost demonic

look in his eye. But his work is artistic
and accurate. Me traces the lines
exactly, seemingly unshaken by pres
sure, relaxed after the thousands of tat
toos he's etched over the past five
years.
I: In the age of AIDS, how do you pro
tect against spreading infection?
DM: Well, first of all, the kind of nee
dles we use aren't the kind they have all
the problems with in hospitals. The
kind they use in hospitals are hollow,
so they hold blood. These are pointed
needles. And they're all sterilized and
everything — if they weren't, we
wouldn't be in business.
I: Do government inspectors come in
to check up?
DM: Oh, sure, they come in all the
time. But they always came in. What
people don't realize is that AIDS has
been around since '66. And it's been
bad since '78 — it's been bad since I
was in high school.
I: How does one become a tattoo
artist? And how did you start working

here?
DM: Well, I've been working here for
about five years now. I've known my
boss since he opened the place in '77.1
asked him if I could work for him —
and he said 'Sure — I'll train you.'
I: What were you doing before that?
DM: I worked in a high school before
this — doing custodial work at night.
I: Have you done any other kind of
artistic work? Drawing? Painting?
DM: Well, mostly I've just wanted to
draw tattoos. I do a lot of drawing. I
could probably paint — I've never
done it — but I'm sure I can.
I: Have you ever had anyone chicken
out halfway through a tattoo?
DM: Nah. I've only had one person get
up and run. And that was before I
started doing the tattoo.
I: Who designs all the tattoos, and do
you keep getting new ones?
DM: My boss draws all of 'em, but I
can draw all of 'em too. He draws new
ones a lot. Then I make a stencil of the

drawing, so we can use it.
I: Do you get more men or women
coming in?
DM: I get more women — lately. So
far today I've done three women and
one man. I have four more women
coming in at 7 p.m. Women are getting
more into it these days.
I: Have you noticed any other change
in the type of people you get in for tat
toos?
DM: Oh, sure. Used to be the only
people who got them were bikers and
biker-chicks — nowadays everyone's
gettin' them. It's almost a trendy thing:
People see their friends' tattoos and are
like, 'Well, you got one — I gotta get
me one.'
I: What's the most popular design peo
ple ask for?
DM: Hearts and roses mostly.
I: Does that go for men too?
DM: Oh sure, hearts and roses ... and
skulls — stuff like that — reapers, you
know.
