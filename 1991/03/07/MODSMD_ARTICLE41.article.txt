## Timeless teenage passions awaken onstage 
### 
"Spring Awakening," produced
by the Stanford Department of
Drama, stars Adam Tobin,
Peter Edmonston and Karen
Weitzman
"I believed I was suffering from an
external defect."
"I was a little ashamed, that's all."
These words could easily have been
spoken by any modern American teen
ager concerned with his or her devel
oping sexuality. In actuality, however,
this dialogue is from a play written
decades before our time, years before
most of our grandparents were even
born.
The play is Frank Wedekind's
"Spring Awakening," and the setting is
a provincial German town in 1891.
The Stanford Department of
Drama's production, as adapted by
Chris Salter and Ryan Page, deals with
a group of adolescents growing up
under the constraints of a painfully
repressive society. Due to the sensitiv
ity of the many issues touched upon in
the play, including homosexuality,
child abuse and religion, it was banned
under charges of obscenity for almost

two decades after first publication.
In honor of the 100 th anniversary
of "Spring Awakening," director Salter
and dramaturge Page decided to
restore many of the controversial
scenes that, to this day, are usually cut
from the play.
"There is something to be said for
Wedekind's willingness to explore the
dangerous and unknown places that
we all share," said Salter, a Ph.D. stu
dent in the department. This seems
especially true when one considers the
conservative era in which Wedekind
wrote.
"This play is definitely not for the
squeamish," said cast member Renee
Brown, "It deals with a lot of offensive
issues that people don't like to think
about."
The story of "Spring Awakening"
focuses of the experiences of two 16-
year-old schoolboys, Melchior, played
by sophomore Adam Tobin, and his
pressured friend Moritz, played by
sophomore Peter Edmonston. Their
characters, along with that of Wendln,
(sophomore Karen Weitzman), lead
the cast through a series of bizarre
scenes that express their growing
emotional and sexual identities.
The cast credits their abilities to
portray powerful feelings to three
weeks of preparation rehearsals. This
time was devoted to practicing various
physical and emotional exercises in

order to develop the passions they
would soon be acting out on stage.
"Instead of starting with the script,
we worked backwards and developed
our emotional characterizations first,"
said Zander Teller, another cast mem
ber.
As an audience member, one can't
help but watch "Spring Awakening"
with a certain amount of uncomfort
able identification with the pressures
and questions the young adults on
stage have. The work is guaranteed to
generate thought-provoking ideas on
the similarities between the lives, loves
and sexualities of youth past and
present.
