# Love and laughter — in a Russian dialect
## 
### 
*A Night of Russian One-Acts,"
directed by Anne Kauffman
Two bizarre love triangles domi
nated the stage of Memorial Audito
rium's Little Theater Tuesday and
Wednesday night, as senior Anne
Kauffman presented "A Night of
Russian One-Acts." Two symbolist
works — Aleksandr Blok's "The Fair
ground Booth" and Nikolai Evreinov's
"A Merry Death" — offered the audi
ence a visual feast of flamboyancy,
while challenging the mind with

absurd plots.
Although the plays were quite dis
tinct in style, the versatile cast man
aged to present both with flair, espe
cially the male actors, who stole both
shows.
In"The Fairground Booth," Craig
Grossman infused humor and energy
into the role of the bumbling play
wright frustrated with the actor's
mutinous execution of his work. And
Douglas Heise should have worn him
self out slithering and skipping around
the stage as a hyperactive Harlequin,
but somehow maintained his indefati
gability as Pierrot in the next play. In
this role, he convincingly portrayed a
husband vacillating between dismay at
his wife's cuckoldry and ambivalence
over his friend's looming death.
Equally compelling was Blake Mas
ters as the larger-than-life Harlequin (a
different one), bounding from his
deathbed to exhort his fellow "stage
mates" to "live every day as if it were
your last." He and Lee Newman as his
lover proved a powerful duo to balance
the angst-ridden Pierrot.
Fiery props and grotesque wooden
figures added a surreal dimension to
the dynamic tone set by the cast. The
one element which tripped up Anne
Kauffman's presentation was the
choreography.
While the dancing could have
added another dimension to both
shows' vibrant imagery, it failed to do
more than elevate the actors' heart
rates.
The one exception was the hilarious
dance of love — in which dark, danc
ing bodies emerged from the back
ground to shadow Master's and New
man's caricature of illicit passion in "A
Merry Death." Newman proved as
adept at tangoing with a plastic rose in
mouth, as she did at wailing, "Help,

I'm bleeding cranberry juice," during a
farcical moment in the first play.
Though the Russian works were
both performed in English, their dia
logue still proved cryptic at times.
During intermission, these reviewers
turned to their Russian neighbors,
Palo Alto residents Nora and Josef, for

an explanation of the play's deeper
message. But, unfortunately they too
were stumped. "We didn't understand
the English!" they exclaimed, adding
that, upon returning home, they
planned to read the plays in their orig
inal.
