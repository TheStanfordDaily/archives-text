# STAGE
## Innovative, creative movement from Momix 
### 
Momlx, an acrobatic modern
dance company, is being pre
sented on campus by the
Lively Arts at Stanford.

Momix has been described as witty,
acrobatic, innovative and spellbinding.
And, maybe even a little weird.
Momix, taking the stage at Memo
rial Auditorium today and tomorrow
at 8 p.m., is a modern dance company
which defies categorization, combin
ing dance, acrobatics, mime and any
thing else the off-beat choreographers
dream up, in their varied repertoire.
Momix performs a different pro
gram at every performance, and their
Stanford shows, tonight and tomor
row, are no exception.
Tonight's performance includes
"Spawning," a piece set to Peter
Gabriel's "Mercy Street," which fea
tures three virtually naked women sen
sually interacting with enormous egg
like balloons, elegantly releasing their
spawn.
"Skiva" is another innovative piece
to be performed tonight, in which two
dancers perform gravitational wonders
on skis — minus the snow.
Tomorrow night's winner promises
to be "Circle Walker," the piece pic
tured in the photograph, which fea
tures a man and an object — a huge
sculpture in fact — maneuvering
around the stage together. "Elva" is
another innovation: Set to Elvis Pres
ley's "Blue Suede Shoes," the piece
focuses on a television set mounted to
the body of a dancer.
