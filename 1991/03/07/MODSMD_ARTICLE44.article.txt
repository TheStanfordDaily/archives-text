# Unconventional theater in the basement of Crothers

Ensemble '91, a group of
undergraduate 'dramophiles,'
is performing in Crothers Pub
this weekend.

Ensemble } 91 s goal is
not simply to entertain
but also to aim for
'heightened awareness 1
among its audience

Crothers Pub, in the basement of
Crothers Memorial Hall, is a dimly lit,
gloomy sort of room. With thick
wooden pillars and dark corners, it
resembles a medieval dungeon more
than it does a pub. One could almost
describe it as macabre.
Which makes it more or less the
perfect stage for Ensemble '91,
a group of undergraduate
"dramophiles" who perform with the
intent to disturb and to provoke
thought among their audience.
This weekend, at 8 p.m. on Friday
and Saturday, and at midnight on Sat
urday, Ensemble '91 will be presenting
a "One Act Festival," including "On
Utopias," a collage of texts based on
Helene Cixous' "Laugh of Medusa";
"Heartpiece," by Heiner Muller; and

Bertold Brecht's "The Exception and
the Rule."
Ensemble '91's goal is not simply to
entertain but also to aim for "height
ened awareness" among its audience
members. "A night of entertainment is
great," explains the group's director,
first-year graduate student Babak
Ebrahimian, "but what's the use if you
haven't thought or felt."
Accordingly, the group is perform
ing some pretty thought-provoking,
controversial material. "On Utopias" is
about sexual abuse; the Muller play is a
black humor "clown piece" that looks
at issues of violence and war; "The
Exception to the Rule" is about racial
and capitalist exploitation.
Not exactly easily digestible stuff.
But Ebrahimian is no stranger to
controversy, having raised something
of a stir himself in the Drama Depart
ment. After all, most first-year gradu
ate students "don't walk right in and
start an ensemble," said Ebrahimian.
Ebrahimian became familiar with
the ensemble as a dramatic medium
while an undergraduate at Cornell
University, and was surprised to find it
missing at Stanford. An ensemble, he
explains, differs from the traditional
method of putting on a production
where the cast is put together and lim
ited through the process of auditions.
No one has been "cut" from
Ensemble '91. The group has been lim
ited instead through what Ebrahimian
refers to as "casualties." Some mem
bers left the group because they were
uncomfortable with the techniques
used (which include extreme intimacy

or "sensualization" among group
members and the use of electric
shock), while others were uncomfort
able with the controversial nature of
the material being performed.
The end result of this "casualty"

process is that the survivors form a
very tighdy knit, cohesive unit whose
members are completely comfortable
with each other.
Ensemble '91 calls what they do
"Rough and Immediate Theater." And

their "One Act Festival" is just that:
The sets are (appropriately) Spartan,
the stage is intimate and the messages
are powerful and provocative.
