## Shakepeare spin-offs can be 'hep' 
### 
"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
are Dead," starring Gary Old
man, Tim Roth and Richard
Dreyluss
It was a Saturday night.
So I says to myself, I says, "What
would be the 'hep' thing to do tonight?
Toboggan? Braid my armpits? Scoop
up the field mice and pop them on the
head?"
No. The hep thing to do was to
drive into the City and catch the 10:10
p.m. showing of "Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern are Dead." Even "hep
per," to see it in a theater in Japantown.
Without shoes.
So I went.
I sat down with the somewhat
sparse Sprockets-like audience and
immediately joined in their mocking
laughter of the previews. We weren't
here to see prep school kids overthrow
their Arab kidnappers; no, we were
here for theater. A 20th century inter
pretation of Shakespeare (or at least
two minor characters from "Hamlet").
Tres hep.
And I brought a particularly hep
crowd with me — one male, one
female, knowing the asymmetry would
garner hepster approval.
The film opened to some particu
larly hep blues, and my hep male
acquaintance turned to me and said,
"Isn't this "Seamus" (hepster pronun
ciation: /shamus/) from the first side
of Pink Floyd's "Meddle"?"
"Right, right, right," I quickly
responded, then slunk down in my
chair, pressed my palms together in
front of my mouth and prepared

myself for a hep experience.
The plot was already ruined by the
title; that's hep.
And now, my hep friends, the
review.
If "Pretty Woman" made you sick,
if "Ghost" made you question the
mentality of America, if you think all
culture was forever lost when Robert
Duvall indulged in a discussion with a
car frame in "Days of Thunder," go see
"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern"
(hereafter heply referred to as "Ross
and Gil").
It's not about plot. It's about meta
physical indulgences. It's about death
and meaninglessness and our reliance
upon the rules and paths which seem
to be indelibly written.
Tom Stoppard, an English play
wright, wrote this script 24 years ago,
and it translates to film surprisingly
well. But this is Stoppard's first turn at
directing, and although he does an
impressive job, his inexperience isn't
entirely unnoticeable.
His relentless creativity, however, is
what makes this film work. (What a
heply Zen-like observation.) He
doesn't pander to the audience, throw
ing in Lone Ranger-paced music and
sex every 20 minutes.
The acting also helps carry the film.
Richard Dreyfuss plays The Player
with particular insight, and Gary Old
man and Tim Roth (Ross and Gil,
respectively) do an impressive job as
well.
If you want an experience that will
leave you skipping home thinking
about how nifty life is, while secretly
and bitterly wishing you were sleeping
with Julia Roberts, then don't see
"Ross and Gil."
If, however, you are interested in a
truly hep experience, one that keeps
you on your toes for the more than two
full hours, one that entertains while
also engages your mind, see this film.

It might even make you appreciate
Shakespeare.
