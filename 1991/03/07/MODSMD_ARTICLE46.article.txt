# Three kids, a pirate and a secret treasure
## 
### 
"Shipwrecked," starring Stian
Smestad, Louisa Haigh and
Gabriel Byrne
When it comes to making formula
movies, Disney always seems to put

together the right ingredients.
The latest Disney concoction,
"Shipwrecked," contains a simple and
predictable storyline that never moves
too quickly, but nonetheless warms its
audience's hearts.
The movie tells the story of a Nor
wegian boy named Hakon Hakonsen
(Stian Smestad), who takes a position
as a "ship's boy" to pay off his father's
debt and save the family home. Hakon
starts out as the runt on the ship and
gradually develops into a worthy sea
man, but not before he has danger
ously befriended a stowaway orphan
named Mary (Louisa Haigh).
While at sea, the ship is taken over

by an evil pirate, Merrick (played by
Gabriel Byrne), disguised as a British
Navy officer, whom Hakon discovers
smuggling guns in the ship's cargo.
Before Merrick can pursue his plans,
the stormy sea overcomes the vessel
and disposes of its occupants, leaving
Hakon stranded by himself on a desert
island.
Combining more subdued ele
ments of "Indiana Jones" and "Robin
son Crusoe," Hakon risks near death to
discover a treasure that he learns
belongs to Merrick, and then builds a
fortress to protect him from Merrick's
inevitable return. While touring a
nearby island, Hakon discovers Mary
and his brotherly shipmate Jens
(Trond Peter StamsO Munch), and the
three eventually take on the pirates in a
battle for the treasure and a new ship.
Despite a steady plot that may
move too slowly for adults who have
seen their share of pirate films, "Ship
wrecked" keeps the wind in its sails
with strong performances by all three
main characters. Competent direction
and cinematography make good use of
beautiful settings in Norway, England,
Australia and two Fiji islands.
No fancy stunts, no unexpected
plot twists and no big-name actors,
but "Shipwrecked" finds smooth sail
ing just the same.
