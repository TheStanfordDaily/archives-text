# Oliver Stone's 'Doors' lacks depth, credibility
## 
### 
"The Doors," starring Val
Kilmer, Frank Whaley, Kevin
Dillon and Meg Ryan
"Cinema returns us to anima, reli
gion of matter, which gives each thing
it's special divinity and sees gods in all
things and beings."
— Jim Morrison
For lip-synching, I give it a 30.
But, if you want an entertaining,
informative look at the Doors, stay
home and listen to your discs.
Yeah, I know Val Kilmer looks a lot
like Jim Morrison. But if you really

want to sec Morrison, rent "Live at the
Hollywood Bowl."
The problem with these two-plus
hours of rambling footage is the shal
lowness of Oliver Stone's conception.
It is, as Morrison says in the quote
above, a pedantic attempt to see a god
in the life of a performer.
In fact, the whole movie seems like
an elementary school primer on the
life of a rock star.
Early in the movie, Morrison sings
a few bars of his lyrics to future key
board player, Ray Manzarek, for the
first time. Manzarek immediately
drops his jaw, dumbfounded.
"This is great, man. Really great.
Gee, wouldn't it be swell if we formed
a rock-and-roll band?"
"Sure," replies Jim, "Let's call it the
Doors. I read it in a Blake poem; it's
really deep, trust me."
"We'll make a million dollars,
man."
And thus, Stone smoothly
maneuvers the audience from point A
to point B.
At another particularly patronizing
point, Stone lays a bunch of existential
texts in front of Kilmer in order to
convince us of the groups' intellectual
authenticity. Then, to hammer the
point home, he has Krieger spew arti
ficial lines like, "It'll sound great with a
couple of solos; like Coltrane does in
'Love Supreme?'
In other words, the writing is really
trite. And the dialogue and plot, at
points, become thoroughly unbeliev
able.
I will admit, however, that I didn't
totally hate the movie. The acting,
though constrained by the poor script,
was good; the cinematography was
entrancing; and the cuts of music were
crisp. All of this adds up to a somewhat
enjoyable — although disappointingly
empty — experience.
It's not the worst movie I've ever sat
through by a long shot, but its defi
nitely not worth going to the theater.
If Stone wanted to idolize Morri
son, he should have used his talent to
compile a two-hour film of videos. It
would have been great. But I guess
that's hard to sell to movie companies.
I would have gone.
