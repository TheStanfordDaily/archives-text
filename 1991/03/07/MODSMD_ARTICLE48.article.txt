Unequal Sisters:
A Multi-Cultural Reader in U.S. History
Edited by Ellen Dußois and Vicki Ruiz
Routledge, 462 pages, $18.95
"Unequal Sisters" is a collection of informative
and perceptive essays on women of color in American
history. The book includes topics ranging from fam
ily violence to discrimination to activism.
One of the book's most interesting pieces, "The
Pocahontas Perplex," discusses the perceptions of
Native American women in American culture.
Another focuses on "The Black Community and the
Birth Control Movement."
Written mainly by professors, the essays reflect
many aspects of U.S. women's history which are not
covered by conventional textbooks.
The editors also provide good selected bibliogra
phies on African-American, Native American, Asian-
American and Latina women.
Ain't I a Woman! —
A book of women's poetry from around the world
Edited by Illona Linthwaite
Peter Bedrick Books, 182 pages, $6.95
Although not all the poetry in this collection is
fantastic, most of it is pretty good. And it's interesting
to have Sappho's poetry from 600 B.C. Greece juxta
posed with 20th century Nigerian writers.
Covering amazing geographical and temporal dis
tance, certain themes recur. Ideas of motherhood,
marriage, love and sex appear in contrast with images
of racism and colonialism.
Women of Mexico:
The Consecrated 8c the Commoners
Bobette Gugliotta
Floricanto Press, 191 pages, $14.95
By looking at individual women in their social and
cultural context, Gugliotta aims to provide a more
complete view of Mexican history.
Focused on the years between the conquest and
1900, one of the book's most interesting chapters
deals with nuns and their role in the church.
Other sections discuss the Mexican women in
Hapsburg Empress Carlota's court and the female
Spanish colonists. Photos of some period costumes
are included.
