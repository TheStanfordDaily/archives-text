"The anthology is meant to engage the reader's total per
son. I do not believe that 'distance' and 'objectivity' alone help
us come to terms with our issues. ... Total feeling and emo
tional immersion, the shocking drench of guilt or anger or
frustration, wakes us up to some of our realities."
â€” Gloria Anzaldua
In her latest book, Chicana feminist Gloria Anzaldua has
truly succeeded in assembling a collection of stories, poems
and essays by women of color that sparks both the intellect
and the spirit.

One of the major issues explored in
the text, and one that is currently
receiving attention in academic and
other circles, is that of the division
within the feminist movement
between white women and women
of color.

The contributors come from a variety of ethnic, social,
economic, linguistic and academic backgrounds. With writ
ing that is both imaginative and profound, they cover an
incredible range of topics from sexual abuse, family dynam
ics and friendship to broader themes such as anger and love,
division and unity, oppression and empowerment, death
and rebirth.
One of the major issues explored in the text, and one
that is currently receiving attention in academic and other
circles, is that of the division within the feminist movement
between white women and women of color.
The debate centers on how to balance diversity and
unity, how to acknowledge and celebrate the differences
that exist among women in terms of race, class, sexual pref
erence and other factors without jeopardizing the unity cre
ated by their common experience of gender oppression.
Anzaldua's contributors advocate the forging of alliances
and the development of a more inclusive feminist ideology
that will truly incorporate women of all perspectives.
In a sense, this book is an initial attempt at doing just
that. It is an attempt to bridge many of the borders that exist
not only between members of the feminist community but
throughout society as well. Through this literary mestizaje,

Anzaldua presumably intends to effect a similar cultural
integration, particularly of women.
Many of the selections clearly aim to foster a greater
understanding between people of different cultures. Yet
there are other pieces containing generalizations and accu
sations that are very alienating, particularly for white read
ers.
However, upon reading the essay by UC-Berkeley pro
fessor Norma Alarc6n, it becomes clear that it is these
"uncomfortable" sections of the book that initiate genuine
cross-cultural understanding. As Alarc6n insists, it is only
by "coming to terms with the sense of alienation, of not
belonging, of having your world thoroughly disrupted ..."
that white women can begin to appreciate and share in the
struggle of women of color.
This is one of the book's many achievements. Another is
its brilliant chapter on innovative ways of "doing" literary

theory. The articles in this section provide fresh and illumi
nating arguments in favor of the idea of "criticism from
within."
This notioh proposes that works of literature, particu
larly those in literary traditions that have historically been
marginalized, be analyzed by criteria relevant to the literary
tradition to which they belong rather than judged according
to prescriptive Western theories.
In keeping with this idea, it seems inappropriate if not
impossible to evaluate "Haciendo Caras" within a tradi
tional or popular literary framework. Rather, this work and
others like it (such as Anzaldua's previous books "Border
lands/La Frontera" and "This Bridge Called My Back")
must be allowed to "speak for themselves."
In this way, the voices of these women, passionate voices
filled with rage and joy and pride, voices that have for so
long been silenced and ignored, will at last be heard.
