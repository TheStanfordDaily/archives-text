# Academic theme houses feature culture, language
## 
### Paul Yee 
Junior Wee-Lee Lim has one thing to
say about the East Asian Studies Theme
House: "It's not a geek house."
Lim is one of the about 270 students
who live in Stanford's six academic
theme houses, which provide program
ming, classes and other activities related
to foreign cultures and languages.
Although EAST House is in Gover
nor's Corner, the other five — the Italian
House, French House, American Studies
House, Haus Mitteleuropa and Slavian
skii Dom — are located on the Row.

Slavianskii Dom — Russian for
"Slavic House" — focuses on the cul
tures of the Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe. Haus Mitt residents learn about
central European nations, particularly
Germany. And despite its name, EAST
House deals with all of Asia, not just
China, Japan and Korea.
Many residents say they enjoy the
challenge of learning in a residential set
ting.
Living in Slavianskii has "definitely
helped my language ability in Russian,"
