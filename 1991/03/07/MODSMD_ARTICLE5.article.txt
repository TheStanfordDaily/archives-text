# Academic theme houses feature culture, language
## 
### Paul Yee 
Junior Wee-Lee Lim has one thing to
say about the East Asian Studies Theme
House: "It's not a geek house."
Lim is one of the about 270 students
who live in Stanford's six academic
theme houses, which provide program
ming, classes and other activities related
to foreign cultures and languages.
Although EAST House is in Gover
nor's Corner, the other five — the Italian
House, French House, American Studies
House, Haus Mitteleuropa and Slavian
skii Dom — are located on the Row.

Slavianskii Dom — Russian for
"Slavic House" — focuses on the cul
tures of the Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe. Haus Mitt residents learn about
central European nations, particularly
Germany. And despite its name, EAST
House deals with all of Asia, not just
China, Japan and Korea.
Many residents say they enjoy the
challenge of learning in a residential set
ting.
Living in Slavianskii has "definitely
helped my language ability in Russian,"

Members of academic theme houses immerse themselves dally In their particu
lar fields of interest. At Slavianskii Dom, this includes posted Russian labels
throughout the house.
said junior Natasha Brubaker.
"It's exposed me to different
things about Russian and East
European life that I probably
wouldn't have found if I was liv
ing somewhere else," she said.
"One of the missions of aca
demic theme houses is to make
intellectual life part of everyone's
daily experience," said senior Ted
Wong, resident assistant of the
French House.
Robin Hensley, acting co-direc
tor of Residential Education, said
academic theme houses differ
from ethnic theme houses like
Ujamaa and Okada as they focus
on a particular academic area
rather than an ethnic community.
Ethnic theme houses provide
residents ways to explore their
cultural backgrounds and are also
"designed to be supportive com
munities for people of color," she
said.
The number of residents in
academic theme houses ranges
from 31 in Haus Mitt to 63 in
EAST House. Each house's staff

consists of one RA, one or two res
ident fellows and two to five
theme associates.
Theme associates tend to be in
charge of theme-related program
ming, while RAs have the same
duties as RAs in other dorms,
Wong said.
A different experience
Many residents say they
decided to live in academic theme
houses to find a different housing
experience than dormitories pro
vide.
"I was tired of living in [dormi
tories], and I wanted to get more
involved with German culture,"
said Haus Mitt resident Patrick
Shainin, a junior. "It's a nice,
small, comfortable house with
people with similar interests."
Academic theme houses also
are home to international stu
dents and emigres. Junior Greg
Bass, who moved away from the
Ukraine eight years ago, said Sla
vianskii is "a place where I
belong."
"I think the way people are
being exposed to the theme is very
unobtrusive, but persuasive nev
ertheless. Nobody comes away
without learning something," he

added.
The houses work jointly with
the Housing Center to "give prior
ity (in the Draw) to students who
have genuine interest in the
theme," Hensley said.
Fedora Chin, a senior, said
being a theme associate at EAST
House is "a way to maintain a
connection to East Asia" — some
thing she would not have done
otherwise.
Some students say that
although they originally chose to
live in academic theme houses
because of better food and facili
ties, they have discovered other
benefits of the houses during
their stay.
Dina Viggiano, Italian House
RF and senior lecturer for the
French and Italian Department,
said one walk-on "has become one
of the most enthusiastic [resi
dents] of the house. He always
says, 'The atmosphere took me!' "
Residential learning
Each theme house provides
various seminars, speaker series
and film programs to expose resi
dents to different aspects of the
house's theme.
This quarter, the Italian House

offers a weekly one-hour seminar
on Italian photojournalism. Resi
dents of the French House were
able to take a class focusing on the
films of French director Eric
Rohmer. And American Studies
House residents have been taking
a seminar about media in the
United States.
In January, Slavianskii held
"unhappy hours" in which resi
dents discussed the Soviet inter
vention in Lithuania. Residents
wrote a letter to Soviet president
Mikhail Gorbachev condemning
his use of force in the Baltic
states.
To improve the language abili
ties of its residents, the French
House, the Italian House and
Haus Mitt offer conversation
classes of various levels to their
residents and other interested
students.
Theme associates also desig
nate weekly "language tables"
and "language days" to give stu
dents a chance to practice their
skills.
All of the houses except Haus
Mitt also require residents to par
ticipate in theme projects.
Theme projects
Residents of the French, Ital
ian, American Studies and EAST
Houses complete projects individ
ually or in small groups dealing
with a topic related to their
house's theme.

For example, French House
residents Rennie Crocker and
Holly Miller, both sophomores,
recently presented a project on
Cqjun culture in Louisiana. As the
audience enjoyed homemade
gumbo, the two showed slides,
played music and demonstrated a
Ccyun dance.
"I'm from Louisiana, but I
learned a lot," said Miller. She
called the presentations "a differ
ent way to get to socialize."
Instead of doing individual pro
jects, Slavianskii residents join
one of five different theme
groups, which meet for the entire
academic year. This year's themes
include current events, food, envi
ronment, culture and resistance
through literature.
Senior Jon Kissane, a Slavian
skii theme associate, heads the
group dealing with Eastern Euro
pean environmental issues. The
group writes letters to U.S. and
Eastern European politicians and
organizations advocating the
clean-up of the environment.
The academic theme houses
also offer less serious ways of
learning.
Residents of French House can
enjoy wine tasting and French
bedtime stories. Italian House
residents have Friday happy
hours where they play various
games, such as Italian Pictionary
and an Italian version of the TV
game show "Hollywood Squares."
