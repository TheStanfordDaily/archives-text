I know I don't want to say Patricia Volk's
book is good. I'm just not sure how to explain
that it's not bad.
The book is a collection of short pieces that
center around families and relationships. One
might wonder what is so bad about that, aside
from the fact that 95 percent of all fiction is
about families and relationships.
Nothing is inherently so bad about it. It's
just that after reading the book, I didn't care
about these families and relationships.
It didn't bother me that people involved in
relationships cheated on one another. It didn't
bother me that a grandmother couldn't
remember the names of her family members.
Nothing bothered me, because these characters
were lost in their own little worlds, and weren't

about to let me in, even if Patricia said please.
As a result, I didn't care about any of them, and
considered taking the book back.
I'm disagreeing with the New York Times
Book Review here. They thought Patricia Volk
was hilariously comic, piercing the ribs and
wounding the heart. I thought she was pretty
funny at times, but she didn't come anywhere
near my ribs.
Perhaps I'm missing some deep, philosoph
ical points about life and love and all that is
good and right with the world ... I guess I
could be. But how many ways can you interpret
"I feel suspended. I feel weightless. I feel like a
banana coin in jello."?
Just about that many.
The story in which that amazing quote
appears is "Syzygy," which is a really great
Scrabble word that means the rare alignment of
the Earth, the sun and the moon that produces
an extra gravitational pull. (Ahh, now the ref
erence to weightlessness takes on a new signifi

cance...)
The story involves a woman and a man she
used to date/go with/go out with/sleep with/be
in love with. They walk around the Lower East
Side of New York, look at cassette recorders, eat
lunch and tell each other they've never loved
anyone else quite the same way, even though
they're both involved with other people.
Then they go their separate ways, and as
she's fixing her frozen fried chicken that night,
she has a flash of brilliant insight that tells her
something old has ended and therefore, some
thing new is just beginning.
Now, I realize this is a short story, but short
should not mean skimming the surface of peo
ple's lives. It's possible to provide characters
that make themselves known.
There are some that do assert themselves;
they do so by trying to make their children feel
guilty for not keeping in touch. Or they force
themselves on other people, either by having
sex with them or announcing loudly in an air

port that they would gladly donate either kid
ney to their sister, and throw in a spleen for
good measure.
This is not to say that Volk's book is com
pletely unworthy of reading. She makes a few
good points, though they're lodged in among
the dolphins and the banana coins and the
Waldorf salad and are sometimes hard to see.
In"The Air of My Youth," she writes, "The
only thing that makes you remember a smell is
smelling it" OK, this may not seem like a big
revelation. But she's talking about the memo
ries smells carry with them, and how a person
might not be able to recall a memory, ever,
unless he or she smells something reminiscent
of it.
In "Seams," she tells us brides cry because
"they know love is strongest when you're scared
of losing it." All people might think they know
that, but that certainly doesn't stop anyone
from acting dumb about matters of the heart.
In "Which is Better?" a main character asks,

quite originally, "Which is better? The touch of
someone who is responding to you out of pas
sion without thinking, or the touch of someone
who is doing what they think they are supposed
to be doing? A man who loves you enough to
tell the truth, or a man who loves you enough
not to hurt you? Real lemonade, or fake?"
Volk realizes that "There are times you go
through with something simply because it is
inevitable. And at those times what you go
through happens with the kind of velocity that
is described at length in the laws of physics. It is
that same thrust that, when a car stops short,
keep you moving forward regardless, over the
steering wheel, clear through the windshield,
and out onto the hood."
Patricia Volk has her points about life, and
tries to make them in 15 short stories. I can't
truly say she's completely succeeded. I must
admit she makes the little things count, but by
the time the reader gets to the big things, she's
already finished the story.
