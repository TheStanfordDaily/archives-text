# Buying beads and baubles
## 
### Jenny Johnston 
A short-haired girl with a black
leather jacket and a pierced nose asks a
* l saleslady about earrings — perhaps a
Pbit more defiantly than the situation
warrants — while a little girl and her
grandmother inspect alphabet beads.
Meanwhile, an initially disinter
ested man entwines himself in a hefty
discussion about beads, culture and
Africa, while the rest of the customers
mill about, designing their purchases
between conversation with the
employees.
Where is this eclectic group gath
ered? Would you believe at a bead
store?
Palo Alto has a store for everything
— gourmet coffee, Peruvian sweaters
and tribal artwork. So it's not surpris
' ing that, just off campus, there's a shop
k just for beads.
You may wonder where this
L entrancing store is. You may also won
-5 der what this entrancing store is. The
. Bead Shop is right at your fingertips
[ on an apathetic little street off of Uni
versity Avenue.
As for what it is, well, here's the
idea: You go in and choose your beads,
which you place, most conveniently
and quaintly, in different compart
ments of a muffin tin, according to
price.
Next, you choose your medium,
whether it be thread, wire, leather, bar
rette posts or bare metal hoops. And
then, either on the spot or in the com
fort of your home, you create your
own soul-stirring jewelry, just as you

like it.
"As you like it" may be preppy —
with highly polished silver and alpha
bet beads for monogrammed baubles
— or ethnic, with amber, Indonesian
silver and Ethiopian crosses.
The Bead Shop has been in busi
ness for seven years, and its merchan- i
dise is amazingly varied. .
Once you've chosen the perfect m
combination, you can make a necklace
for your roommate, anklets for your <*
friends, a bracelet for your love inter
est, pins for your parents, barrettes for <■
your sister and hoop earrings, post
earrings, dusters, clip-ons or all of the
above for yourself — it's a bit over
whelming.
But if you feel insecure about the
overwhelming, never fear. Pamphlets
posted around the store tell you how
jewelry-making works, and the sales
people, wearing their own creations,
will happily explain anything cryptic
within those pages.
There is one problem with this
store, however — leaving. {
On my way out I had the misfor- -
tune of opening an innocent-looking \
drawer. As I stared into a dazzle of (
wooden Indian beads, painted with >
stars in brilliant earthy colors and fill- V
ing me with vague suggestions of the
Orient, I heard two fellow customers
urgendy planning to return in days,
equipped with hundreds of dollars.
I only wish I could do the same.

The Bead Shop is located on Hamilton
Avenue in Palo Alto, just south of the
intersection with Emerson Avenue.
