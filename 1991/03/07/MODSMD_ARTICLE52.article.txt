# Hooker – baddest of all blues stars
## 
### Alex Gregory 
An old black man in a black suit,
with a black hat pushed down so low
over his forehead that the brim met his
shades, walked slowly onstage.
As he began to strum the anti
quated Gibson hollow-body guitar
slung around his waist, the other per
formers onstage took five steps back
and gave the old man the spotlight at
the Rolling Stones' concert last sum
mer.
Eric Clapton, Keith Richards and
Mick Jagger knew that John Lee
Hooker was the baddest of them all,
and on March 11, you, too, can hear
the gruff voice and churning guitar
that have inspired more than two gen
erations of musicians.
If you know who Hooker is, you
probably have tickets already.
Still, there are many who don't, and
if you fall into this category, borrow a
tape or CD from the nearest blues fan
you can find. If you don't know any
blues fans, the Coffee House has some
tunes from Hooker's latest album,
"The Healer,'' on the jukebox.
You might have seen Hooker on
MTV with Bonnie Raitt, playing the
blues duet "In the Mood." Maybe you
remember him from the movie "The

Blues Brothers" — he was the street
musician in the black section of
Chicago who barked, "A-HAW HAW
| HAW HAW." With just that rumbling
. chant, he could blow any other musi
cian off the stage.
When it comes to that intangible
commodity called SOUL, John Lee
Hooker has cornered the market. His
voice is tough and beautiful at the
, same time, and he can instantly shift
gears from bad-ass boogie to crooning
[ blues ballads. The emotion in every
, note he sings is nothing less than
l thunderous.
r As for his leathery fingers, they are
. as strong and agile as ever, and could
give any guitarists in the audience a
serious lesson. He isn't flashy or exces
! sively fast, but when Hooker gets into
. a groove he is locked there. Anyone
! who can keep their feet still during
. "Boom Boom," "Boogie Chillen" or

"Think TVvice Before you Go" proba
bly isn't doing very much breathing
either.
Hooker's music covers the entire
spectrum of emotions, but he claims
that the creative process isn't necessar
ily "blue." In an interview by Bruce
Pollock in "Guitar For the Practicing
Musician," Hooker talks about com
posing the blues:
"A lot of people think blues singers
write when they're sad and lonely.
They think you've gotta be down to
write the blues — hungry, broke. It's
not true. I write when I've got a good
feeling, when I'm happy. Sometimes
you feel something deep down and
write to get it out, get it off your chest.
But I cannot write a song when I'm
feeling blue."
In an age of slick, synthesized, over
polished marshmallow fluff, Hooker's
Stanford appearance will be a journey
into a world where music is raw and
powerful and it comes from the soul.
Hooker is the Humphrey Bogart of
music, the baddest dude around —
come see for yourself.
