### Howard Libit Staff writer 
The People's Platform announced its
slate of Council of Presidents members
and undergraduate senators for the
spring election at an open meeting in El
Centro Chicano last night.
Sophomores Mike Curry and Nicole
Johnson and juniors Mae Lee and Jen
nifer Pearson will be the slate of candi
dates for the COP
The 10 undergraduate senators on
the People's Platform slate include
junior Tara Holeman, sophomores
Pamay Bassey and M. Harrison Hsieh
and freshmen Ronald Berry, Notah

Begay, Ronald Brown, Russel Calleros,
Ying-Ying Goh, Travis Katz and Virginia
Rosas.
The People's Platform did not reveal
its slate of graduate senators at the
meeting because the list has not yet
been completed, said senior David
Brown, a current senator.
Almost 75 people voted to narrow the
list of undergraduate senators from the
15 interested candidates to the final
group of 10. Any student who signed in
at the meeting was eligible to vote.
Before the meeting began, freshman
Zachary Sweeney predicted that "this
vote will be swayed by the large number
of Larkin residents in attendance." As it

turned out he was right: five of the 10
senate candidates selected live in
Larkin, an all-freshman dorm.
The senatorial candidates made short
presentations and briefly answered
questions before people voted. All
stressed similar themes, including
redefining and expanding multicultural
ism, increasing minority recruitment of
students and faculty and focusing on
financial aid issues.
Students not elected to the People's
Platform slate were encouraged to still
run with the party's support, but they
will not have the party's logo next to
their name, Brown said.
The People's Platform held the
meeting despite previous rulings
from elections hearings officer
Doreen Musson, a graduate stu
dent, who has said the candidates'
names must be kept secret until
April 10, the beginning of the
campaign period.
"I really don't think (this
meeting violated Musson's rul
ings)," said senior Goodwin Liu, a
member of the COP
