# Hearings officer nominee questioned

### Miranda Doyle Staff writer 
ASSU hearings officer nominee
Doreen Musson last night said she may
have gone too far in making a controver
sial ruling that could punish students
who declare their candidacy for this
spring's elections before April 10.
Musson met with a total of four peo
ple last night and Tuesday night to
answer questions about her rulings in
preparation for an expected vote on her
confirmation at tonight's senate meet
ing.
"I may have overstated (the enforce
ment policyl," Musson said. Her ruling
calls for the investigation and possible
disqualification of candidates if their

names appear in student publications
before the official beginning of election
campaigns.
She said the Elections Commission
will depend on the candidates' honesty
rather than conduct extensive investiga
tions if their names are disclosed to the
press.
Graduate Senator Douglas Bone said
he was concerned that under Musson's
original ruling candidates might be dis
qualified even if they did not solicit pub
licity.
After Musson's clarification, how
ever, Bone said he was "a little more
comfortable" with the ruling.
Tuesday night, Musson discussed her
interpretation of a change in the ASSU
Bylaws that limits the number of fliers a

candidate can use in a campaign. The
revised bylaw states that each senate
candidate may use 500 fliers and each
Council of Presidents slate may use 750.
During Tuesday's meeting, Musson
said these numbers are the limits for all
paper that candidates use for their cam
paigns, not just fliers.
If she is confirmed, her rulings will
take effect immediately.
Bone was the only senator who
attended last night's meeting; none
appeared at the Tuesday meeting. Two
senate associates did attend Tuesday.
Musson, a graduate student, said sne
was disappointed with the turnout. "I
was hoping that through senators' ques
tioning I would be able to clarify Imy
ruling]."
