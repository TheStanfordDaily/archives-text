# Kennedy braces for hearing on indirect costs
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
Five days from now, just before 10
a.m. EST, University President Donald
Kennedy — bathed in camera flashes
and television lights — will enter room
2123 of the Rayburn House Office
Building in Washington, D.C.
There, in front of what is widely
regarded as the most powerful subcom
mittee of the U.S. House of Representa
tives, Kennedy will be forced to confront
what he says has become the most diffi
cult issue in his 10 years as Stanford's
president.
What follows won't be pretty.
"There may very well be questions
that are essentially designed to be per
sonally embarrassing," Kennedy says.
Questions like, " 'Did you know that
your wedding reception was being

charged to the taxpayers, Dr. Kennedy?'
.. . You've just got to deal with the per
sonal side of the assault as calmly and as
confidently as you can," Kennedy says.
Those launching the "assault" will be
members of the House Subcommittee on
Oversight and Investigations, chaired by
Michigan Democrat John Dingell.
Kennedy and Stanford's indirect-cost
practices will be on the receiving end.
The one-day hearing won't mark the
end of the controversy that has erupted
over Stanford's use of federal research
funds.
How much the University will be able
to charge the government for indirect
costs in the future is the subject of ongo
ing negotiations with the Office of Naval
Research, the federal agency that over
sees the University's use of federal
research funds. The negotiations are not
slated for completion until June. Stan-

'Part of the quality of a good chief executive is
that he or she sees around those corners. And,
you know, the stark fact is I didn't see around
this one.'
— University President Donald Kennedy

ford has literally millions and millions of
dollars riding on the outcome.
Nor is the hearing meant to generate
new legislation or to appropriate funds
to government agencies. The Dingell
subcommittee is fact-finding in nature.
It specializes in bringing to light what it
believes are breakdowns in federal law
and federal oversight — and it often
does so with theatrical flair.

What is likely to emerge from
Wednesday's hearing are a series of new
revelations about what has been
included in Stanford's indirect-cost
pools, some long lectures by Dingell on
the need for stricter management of fed
eral funds — and a lot of bad publicity
for Kennedy and Stanford.
The Dingell hearing won't be the first
time Kennedy has had to answer to

members of Congress. During the two
and-a-half years he spent as commis
sioner of the Food and Drug Administra
tion during the Carter years, Kennedy
testified before congressional commit
tees on dozens of occasions.
He garnered a lot of praise for his
work at the FDA, including a New York
Times editorial that lauded his efforts at
building morale within the agency. But
during his tenure as commissioner,
Kennedy also had to steer the agency
through some of the toughest fights it
had ever faced, including an attempted
ban on saccharin and investigations of
liquid-protein diets.
"I've testified before congressional
committees a lot," Kennedy says, "some
times under hostile circumstances. You
start right off by saying what's wrong
and saying, 'We're sorry, we goofed up and
we'll fix it."
Kennedy is to adopt a similar
posture Wednesday. In recent weeks, he
has acknowledged that there are both
"real and perceived shortcomings" in
Stanford's indirect-cost accounting sys
tem and that Stanford's credibility has
suffered in some circles.
In retrospect, he says, he is partly to
blame.
"I think that there are certain areas
where the chief executive officer really
needs to push people and say, 'No, God
damn it, I predict this will be a problem
area,'" Kennedy says.
"Part of the quality of a good chief
executive is that he or she sees around
those corners. And, you know, the stark
fact is I didn't see around this one."
Cost-accounting pools
Nevertheless, Kennedy steadfastly
maintains that most of the controversy
has resulted not from wrongdoing, but
from, the difficulty in explaining a cost
accounting system based on pooled
accounts.
All operating costs from Hoover
House, including some that benefit
Kennedy and his family personally, are
placed in a single pool, a fraction of which
is allocated to the government as an indi
rect cost of research. The amount is based
on past statistical studies.
Such a system has left the University
vulnerable to an item-by-item examina
tion of what goes into the Hoover House
account.
For example, Kennedy says, a lot of
confusion resulted from the disclosure by
congressional investigators that flower
arrangements were included in the Uni
versity's indirect cost claims. But, "in five
minutes, my experience is, you can satisfy
most reasonable people about the reason
ableness of that charge," he says.
"But you've got to have a patient per
son with a basic sympathy with the objec
tives of the government in sponsoring
fundamental research and of universities
as an appropriate place to do it. You've got
to have a person who understands that
it's an important objective to invest in the
next generation of science as well as in
the current one. And if you have all of
those things together, then you have an
understanding. But it's not easy."
Taking heavy flak
Despite such efforts at explanation,
Stanford's credibility — and Kennedy's
— has suffered since the first federal
investigations began last fall.
"We're taking some very heavy flak,"
Kennedy acknowledges. "But let's
remember that we need to measure
results in the long term. In the long term,
Stanford will be judged on whether it was
appropriately responsive to the inquiry,
whether it confessed error where confes
sion was in order, whether it made full
disclosures and undertook corrective
action and whether it supported the right
policies and put them in place. That's
what we're going to be judged on in the
long run."
Kennedy compares the present public
reaction to Stanford's indirect-cost con
troversy to the public response that
accompanied Stanford's 1988 decision to
replace its Western Culture program with
Cultures, Ideas and Values, a program
that includes more works by women and
minorities. At the time of the decision,
several people in academia, including
then-Secretary of Education William
Bennett, accused Stanford of selling out
to radical students and "trashing" the
West.
"Remember that in the CIV contro
versy," Kennedy says, "there were people
who were very anxious to embarrass
Stanford, and they enjoyed a field day in
the early stages. But as we purposely
went about our business, as the faculty
debated and decided the issue, the more
reasonable and appropriate the changes
looked. It's my hope and belief that that's
exactly what's going to happen here."
Confusion, anger, embarrassment
Interviews with faculty members and
students during the past week suggest
that such a reversal will be an uphill bat
tle. Stanford community members
express confusion, anger and embarrass

ment over the issue.
Graduate students doing research on
campus worry about the effect the contro
versy will have on their ability to obtain
federal grant money. They fear Stanford's
competitiveness has been endangered.
Undergraduates say they have been
frustrated in their attempts to explain to
friends at other schools what is happen
ing here. Stanford's indirect-cost contro
versy has been largely overshadowed by
the war in the Persian Gulf, some stu
dents say, but the issue remains a source
of discussion and jokes.
Several students say their image of
Kennedy has been tainted by the contro
versy. "He hasn't givep a lot of reassur
ances to the students that everything's
going to be OK," says senior Joey Feld
man, a resident assistant in Madera. "It's
very difficult to defend the University and
his actions when he hasn't told us much."
In recent visits to dormitories and in
other meetings with students, Kennedy
says, there has been less criticism than he
anticipated. "I haven't been asked a sin
gle question about Hoover House 'scan
dal' issues," he says.
"I like to think it's because [students]
have made a judgment about that, and
it's a sophisticated judgment. It may be
they're polite. I suppose it's some of
each," he says.
Loss of confidence
Faculty members, too, have been reluc

tant to criticize Kennedy publicly. But pri
vately many say they are deeply con
cerned by the cloud that is hanging over
Stanford. Some faculty, including Engi
neering Prof. William Spicer, say there
has been a loss of confidence in Kennedy's
leadership.
And a small number of students and
faculty have even suggested what was
surely unthinkable several months ago:
that Kennedy should resign.
Graduate student Robert Miller put
the matter most bluntly is a recent letter
to the editor in The Daily: "President
Kennedy, to save the name of this great
university and the funding that is its
lifeblood, you should resign."
Kennedy says he's heard that sug
gested "maybe three times — and no
times at all from people I know.
"If I thought for one minute that my
resignation from this institution would
save its economic lifeblood, I'd be gone in
a New York second," he says.
"Were it to become plain to me or to
the Board (of Trustees) that I'm part of
the problem and not part of the solution
— I have no wish to be part of the prob
lem."
'Too long at the party'
Kennedy maintains that when the
time does come for him to step down, this
controversy will be largely forgotten and
won't handicap his future career choices.
"In a situation like this," he says, "where

there's a lot of media attention, your ten
dency is always to overestimate the tem
perature and prospective duration. I
think the more time people have to reflect
on it and learn about what's really hap
pening, the more it will be seen as a set of
issues about cost accounting."
For the past several years, Kennedy
says, he has had a standard answer when
asked when he might step down: He plans
to see Stanford through its Centennial
Campaign and then evaluate whether or
not he would like to do "one more differ
ent thing" before retiring.
Stanford's billion-dollar fund-raising
campaign will wind down in the fall, by
which time Kennedy will be 60. Over the
summer, he says, he'll be "looking around
here to decide whether I've stayed too
long at the party."
"As my thinking has evolved over the
last year," he says,"it has been in the
direction of feeling that it would be good
for me to put more rather than less time
in here to assure continuity and so forth."
Kennedy says he would like to see
Stanford through its next few years,
given the challenges presented by a tight
budget and his efforts to place a greater
emphasis on undergraduate teaching at
Stanford.
'Very, very remote'
One job Kennedy says he has little
desire to hold is U.S. senator. Despite
recurring rumors that he intends to run

for political office, such a possibility is
"very, very remote," Kennedy says.
"That's just never been an intention of
mine," he says. "I've denied it every time
it comes up. People never believe you
when you deny stuff. It is as absolutely as
remote a possibility now as it ever was."
Returning to government as the head
of a department or agency is more likely,
he says."I suppose at some point if that
opportunity came along and things were
sailing along fine here, that's the kind of
thing I might consider.
"On the other hand, so many interest
ing things are happening here academi
cally that the idea of just returning to
teach is very appealing. I mean I really
like to teach and I was good at it. In many
ways, the happiest future I envision for
myself is just going back to teaching."
'Aspect of personal harassment'
The present, however, remains uncom
fortable.
Being the subject of so much media
attention lately hasn't been easy.
Kennedy has been frustrated by the tone
of some newspapers' coverage of the indi
rect-cost controversy, particularly that of
the San Jose Mercury News.
"When you're accused of what amount
to personal abuses and when you're the
subject of rather bad, but nevertheless
unflattering, political cartoons in your
regional paper, that sort of attention is
not emotionally comfortable for anybody,
and it's not emotionally comfortable for
me or my family," Kennedy says. "There's
an aspect of personal harassment about
it.
But, ultimately, Kennedy says, there is
a lot more riding on Wednesday's hearing
than his reputation. He and other admin
istrators see the event as further evidence
of an increasingly troubled partnership
between scientific research universities
and the government.
For decades, in addition to funding
research projects at universities, the gov
ernment has been committed to support
ing the infrastructure of the institutions
— the roads, buildings, libraries and
administrative overhead that comprise a
university's "indirect costs."
During the last several years, as fed
eral budget pressures have intensified,
that commitment to support universities'
infrastructure has been less evident,
administrators say.
'Don't throw the baby out'
Stanford administrators say this
pressing policy issue has now been lost in
the flood of revelations about Hoover
House flower arrangements, antique pur
chases, dry cleaning bills and linen pur
chases that have dominated the press
accounts of the controversy thus far.
"I'm more worried about that than
anything else," Kennedy says. "My whole
objective in preparing for the hearing and
representing the institution will be to say,
'Look, if there are defects in the way
we're doing our work, and particularly if
a disparity has arisen between what the
government expects and what we can
deliver, we will fix that.
" 'But don't throw the baby out with
the bath water. Don't decide that univer
sities somehow ought to be punished for
these evolved disparities. Fix disparities,
but continue the policy of fully funding
the indirect as well as the direct cost of
research.' That's the only way we're
going to retain science capacity in the uni
versities and continue to deliver on that
commitment."
Dingell subcommittee staffers believe
Kennedy's fears are misplaced. Their
hearing, they say, is not about assessing
government's commitment to research
universities. Rather, it is to make sure
Stanford is spending taxpayers' money
wisely.
"We want to separate the legitimate
costs of research from what we as taxpay
ers feel has nothing to do with research,"
says one staffer, speaking on condition of
anonymity. "It's pretty basic. We just
don't want to pay for antiques. Stanford
wants full-cost recovery. We want full
accountability to the taxpayers."
It is possible that "somewhere down
the road" government support for
research couid be jeopardized as a result
of the Stanford hearing, the staffer con
cedes. But "that's just some of the collat
eral damage," she says.

you know, the stark fact is I didn't see around
this one.'
— University President Donald Kennedy

ford has literally millions and millions of
dollars riding on the outcome.
Nor is the hearing meant to generate
new legislation or to appropriate funds
to government agencies. The Dingell
subcommittee is fact-finding in nature.
It specializes in bringing to light what it
believes are breakdowns in federal law
and federal oversight — and it often
does so with theatrical flair.

What is likely to emerge from
Wednesday's hearing are a series of new
revelations about what has been
included in Stanford's indirect-cost
pools, some long lectures by Dingell on
the need for stricter management of fed
eral funds — and a lot of bad publicity
for Kennedy and Stanford.
The Dingell hearing won't be the first
time Kennedy has had to answer to

members of Congress. During the two
and-a-half years he spent as commis
sioner of the Food and Drug Administra
tion during the Carter years, Kennedy
testified before congressional commit
tees on dozens of occasions.
He garnered a lot of praise for his
work at the FDA, including a New York
Times editorial that lauded his efforts at
building morale within the agency. But
during his tenure as commissioner,
Kennedy also had to steer the agency
through some of the toughest fights it
had ever faced, including an attempted
ban on saccharin and investigations of
liquid-protein diets.
"I've testified before congressional
committees a lot," Kennedy says, "some
times under hostile circumstances. You
start right off by saying what's wrong
and saying, 'We're sorry, we goofed up and
we'll fix it."
Kennedy is to adopt a similar
posture Wednesday. In recent weeks, he
has acknowledged that there are both
"real and perceived shortcomings" in
Stanford's indirect-cost accounting sys
tem and that Stanford's credibility has
suffered in some circles.
In retrospect, he says, he is partly to
blame.
"I think that there are certain areas
where the chief executive officer really
needs to push people and say, 'No, God
damn it, I predict this will be a problem
area,'" Kennedy says.
"Part of the quality of a good chief
executive is that he or she sees around
those corners. And, you know, the stark
fact is I didn't see around this one."
Cost-accounting pools
Nevertheless, Kennedy steadfastly
maintains that most of the controversy
has resulted not from wrongdoing, but
from, the difficulty in explaining a cost
accounting system based on pooled
accounts.
All operating costs from Hoover
House, including some that benefit
Kennedy and his family personally, are
placed in a single pool, a fraction of which
is allocated to the government as an indi
rect cost of research. The amount is based
on past statistical studies.
Such a system has left the University
vulnerable to an item-by-item examina
tion of what goes into the Hoover House
account.
For example, Kennedy says, a lot of
confusion resulted from the disclosure by
congressional investigators that flower
arrangements were included in the Uni
versity's indirect cost claims. But, "in five
minutes, my experience is, you can satisfy
most reasonable people about the reason
ableness of that charge," he says.
"But you've got to have a patient per
son with a basic sympathy with the objec
tives of the government in sponsoring
fundamental research and of universities
as an appropriate place to do it. You've got
to have a person who understands that
it's an important objective to invest in the
next generation of science as well as in
the current one. And if you have all of
those things together, then you have an
understanding. But it's not easy."
Taking heavy flak
Despite such efforts at explanation,
Stanford's credibility — and Kennedy's
— has suffered since the first federal
investigations began last fall.
"We're taking some very heavy flak,"
Kennedy acknowledges. "But let's
remember that we need to measure
results in the long term. In the long term,
Stanford will be judged on whether it was
appropriately responsive to the inquiry,
whether it confessed error where confes
sion was in order, whether it made full
disclosures and undertook corrective
action and whether it supported the right
policies and put them in place. That's
what we're going to be judged on in the
long run."
Kennedy compares the present public
reaction to Stanford's indirect-cost con
troversy to the public response that
accompanied Stanford's 1988 decision to
replace its Western Culture program with
Cultures, Ideas and Values, a program
that includes more works by women and
minorities. At the time of the decision,
several people in academia, including
then-Secretary of Education William
Bennett, accused Stanford of selling out
to radical students and "trashing" the
West.
"Remember that in the CIV contro
versy," Kennedy says, "there were people
who were very anxious to embarrass
Stanford, and they enjoyed a field day in
the early stages. But as we purposely
went about our business, as the faculty
debated and decided the issue, the more
reasonable and appropriate the changes
looked. It's my hope and belief that that's
exactly what's going to happen here."
Confusion, anger, embarrassment
Interviews with faculty members and
students during the past week suggest
that such a reversal will be an uphill bat
tle. Stanford community members
express confusion, anger and embarrass

ment over the issue.
Graduate students doing research on
campus worry about the effect the contro
versy will have on their ability to obtain
federal grant money. They fear Stanford's
competitiveness has been endangered.
Undergraduates say they have been
frustrated in their attempts to explain to
friends at other schools what is happen
ing here. Stanford's indirect-cost contro
versy has been largely overshadowed by
the war in the Persian Gulf, some stu
dents say, but the issue remains a source
of discussion and jokes.
Several students say their image of
Kennedy has been tainted by the contro
versy. "He hasn't givep a lot of reassur
ances to the students that everything's
going to be OK," says senior Joey Feld
man, a resident assistant in Madera. "It's
very difficult to defend the University and
his actions when he hasn't told us much."
In recent visits to dormitories and in
other meetings with students, Kennedy
says, there has been less criticism than he
anticipated. "I haven't been asked a sin
gle question about Hoover House 'scan
dal' issues," he says.
"I like to think it's because [students]
have made a judgment about that, and
it's a sophisticated judgment. It may be
they're polite. I suppose it's some of
each," he says.
Loss of confidence
Faculty members, too, have been reluc

tant to criticize Kennedy publicly. But pri
vately many say they are deeply con
cerned by the cloud that is hanging over
Stanford. Some faculty, including Engi
neering Prof. William Spicer, say there
has been a loss of confidence in Kennedy's
leadership.
And a small number of students and
faculty have even suggested what was
surely unthinkable several months ago:
that Kennedy should resign.
Graduate student Robert Miller put
the matter most bluntly is a recent letter
to the editor in The Daily: "President
Kennedy, to save the name of this great
university and the funding that is its
lifeblood, you should resign."
Kennedy says he's heard that sug
gested "maybe three times — and no
times at all from people I know.
"If I thought for one minute that my
resignation from this institution would
save its economic lifeblood, I'd be gone in
a New York second," he says.
"Were it to become plain to me or to
the Board (of Trustees) that I'm part of
the problem and not part of the solution
— I have no wish to be part of the prob
lem."
'Too long at the party'
Kennedy maintains that when the
time does come for him to step down, this
controversy will be largely forgotten and
won't handicap his future career choices.
"In a situation like this," he says, "where

there's a lot of media attention, your ten
dency is always to overestimate the tem
perature and prospective duration. I
think the more time people have to reflect
on it and learn about what's really hap
pening, the more it will be seen as a set of
issues about cost accounting."
For the past several years, Kennedy
says, he has had a standard answer when
asked when he might step down: He plans
to see Stanford through its Centennial
Campaign and then evaluate whether or
not he would like to do "one more differ
ent thing" before retiring.
Stanford's billion-dollar fund-raising
campaign will wind down in the fall, by
which time Kennedy will be 60. Over the
summer, he says, he'll be "looking around
here to decide whether I've stayed too
long at the party."
"As my thinking has evolved over the
last year," he says,"it has been in the
direction of feeling that it would be good
for me to put more rather than less time
in here to assure continuity and so forth."
Kennedy says he would like to see
Stanford through its next few years,
given the challenges presented by a tight
budget and his efforts to place a greater
emphasis on undergraduate teaching at
Stanford.
'Very, very remote'
One job Kennedy says he has little
desire to hold is U.S. senator. Despite
recurring rumors that he intends to run

for political office, such a possibility is
"very, very remote," Kennedy says.
"That's just never been an intention of
mine," he says. "I've denied it every time
it comes up. People never believe you
when you deny stuff. It is as absolutely as
remote a possibility now as it ever was."
Returning to government as the head
of a department or agency is more likely,
he says."I suppose at some point if that
opportunity came along and things were
sailing along fine here, that's the kind of
thing I might consider.
"On the other hand, so many interest
ing things are happening here academi
cally that the idea of just returning to
teach is very appealing. I mean I really
like to teach and I was good at it. In many
ways, the happiest future I envision for
myself is just going back to teaching."
'Aspect of personal harassment'
The present, however, remains uncom
fortable.
Being the subject of so much media
attention lately hasn't been easy.
Kennedy has been frustrated by the tone
of some newspapers' coverage of the indi
rect-cost controversy, particularly that of
the San Jose Mercury News.
"When you're accused of what amount
to personal abuses and when you're the
subject of rather bad, but nevertheless
unflattering, political cartoons in your
regional paper, that sort of attention is
not emotionally comfortable for anybody,
and it's not emotionally comfortable for
me or my family," Kennedy says. "There's
an aspect of personal harassment about
it.
But, ultimately, Kennedy says, there is
a lot more riding on Wednesday's hearing
than his reputation. He and other admin
istrators see the event as further evidence
of an increasingly troubled partnership
between scientific research universities
and the government.
For decades, in addition to funding
research projects at universities, the gov
ernment has been committed to support
ing the infrastructure of the institutions
— the roads, buildings, libraries and
administrative overhead that comprise a
university's "indirect costs."
During the last several years, as fed
eral budget pressures have intensified,
that commitment to support universities'
infrastructure has been less evident,
administrators say.
'Don't throw the baby out'
Stanford administrators say this
pressing policy issue has now been lost in
the flood of revelations about Hoover
House flower arrangements, antique pur
chases, dry cleaning bills and linen pur
chases that have dominated the press
accounts of the controversy thus far.
"I'm more worried about that than
anything else," Kennedy says. "My whole
objective in preparing for the hearing and
representing the institution will be to say,
'Look, if there are defects in the way
we're doing our work, and particularly if
a disparity has arisen between what the
government expects and what we can
deliver, we will fix that.
" 'But don't throw the baby out with
the bath water. Don't decide that univer
sities somehow ought to be punished for
these evolved disparities. Fix disparities,
but continue the policy of fully funding
the indirect as well as the direct cost of
research.' That's the only way we're
going to retain science capacity in the uni
versities and continue to deliver on that
commitment."
Dingell subcommittee staffers believe
Kennedy's fears are misplaced. Their
hearing, they say, is not about assessing
government's commitment to research
universities. Rather, it is to make sure
Stanford is spending taxpayers' money
wisely.
"We want to separate the legitimate
costs of research from what we as taxpay
ers feel has nothing to do with research,"
says one staffer, speaking on condition of
anonymity. "It's pretty basic. We just
don't want to pay for antiques. Stanford
wants full-cost recovery. We want full
accountability to the taxpayers."
It is possible that "somewhere down
the road" government support for
research couid be jeopardized as a result
of the Stanford hearing, the staffer con
cedes. But "that's just some of the collat
eral damage," she says.

Five days from now, just before 10
a.m. EST, University President Donald
Kennedy — bathed in camera flashes
and television lights — will enter room
2123 of the Rayburn House Office
Building in Washington, D.C.
There, in front of what is widely
regarded as the most powerful subcom
mittee of the U.S. House of Representa
tives, Kennedy will be forced to confront
what he says has become the most diffi
cult issue in his 10 years as Stanford's
president.
What follows won't be pretty.
"There may very well be questions
that are essentially designed to be per
sonally embarrassing," Kennedy says.
Questions like, " 'Did you know that
your wedding reception was being

charged to the taxpayers, Dr. Kennedy?'
.. . You've just got to deal with the per
sonal side of the assault as calmly and as
confidently as you can," Kennedy says.
Those launching the "assault" will be
members of the House Subcommittee on
Oversight and Investigations, chaired by
Michigan Democrat John Dingell.
Kennedy and Stanford's indirect-cost
practices will be on the receiving end.
The one-day hearing won't mark the
end of the controversy that has erupted
over Stanford's use of federal research
funds.
How much the University will be able
to charge the government for indirect
costs in the future is the subject of ongo
ing negotiations with the Office of Naval
Research, the federal agency that over
sees the University's use of federal
research funds. The negotiations are not
slated for completion until June. Stan-

posture Wednesday. In recent weeks, he
has acknowledged that there are both
"real and perceived shortcomings" in
Stanford's indirect-cost accounting sys
tem and that Stanford's credibility has
suffered in some circles.
In retrospect, he says, he is partly to
blame.
"I think that there are certain areas
where the chief executive officer really
needs to push people and say, 'No, God
damn it, I predict this will be a problem
area,'" Kennedy says.
"Part of the quality of a good chief
executive is that he or she sees around
those corners. And, you know, the stark
fact is I didn't see around this one."
Cost-accounting pools
Nevertheless, Kennedy steadfastly
maintains that most of the controversy
has resulted not from wrongdoing, but
from, the difficulty in explaining a cost
accounting system based on pooled
accounts.
All operating costs from Hoover
House, including some that benefit
Kennedy and his family personally, are
placed in a single pool, a fraction of which
is allocated to the government as an indi
rect cost of research. The amount is based
on past statistical studies.
Such a system has left the University
vulnerable to an item-by-item examina
tion of what goes into the Hoover House
account.
For example, Kennedy says, a lot of
confusion resulted from the disclosure by
congressional investigators that flower
arrangements were included in the Uni
versity's indirect cost claims. But, "in five
minutes, my experience is, you can satisfy
most reasonable people about the reason
ableness of that charge," he says.
"But you've got to have a patient per
son with a basic sympathy with the objec
tives of the government in sponsoring
fundamental research and of universities
as an appropriate place to do it. You've got
to have a person who understands that
it's an important objective to invest in the
next generation of science as well as in
the current one. And if you have all of
those things together, then you have an
understanding. But it's not easy."
Taking heavy flak
Despite such efforts at explanation,
Stanford's credibility — and Kennedy's
— has suffered since the first federal
investigations began last fall.
"We're taking some very heavy flak,"
Kennedy acknowledges. "But let's
remember that we need to measure
results in the long term. In the long term,
Stanford will be judged on whether it was
appropriately responsive to the inquiry,
whether it confessed error where confes
sion was in order, whether it made full
disclosures and undertook corrective
action and whether it supported the right
policies and put them in place. That's
what we're going to be judged on in the
long run."
Kennedy compares the present public
reaction to Stanford's indirect-cost con
troversy to the public response that
accompanied Stanford's 1988 decision to
replace its Western Culture program with
Cultures, Ideas and Values, a program
that includes more works by women and
minorities. At the time of the decision,
several people in academia, including
then-Secretary of Education William
Bennett, accused Stanford of selling out
to radical students and "trashing" the
West.
"Remember that in the CIV contro
versy," Kennedy says, "there were people
who were very anxious to embarrass
Stanford, and they enjoyed a field day in
the early stages. But as we purposely
went about our business, as the faculty
debated and decided the issue, the more
reasonable and appropriate the changes
looked. It's my hope and belief that that's
exactly what's going to happen here."
Confusion, anger, embarrassment
Interviews with faculty members and
students during the past week suggest
that such a reversal will be an uphill bat
tle. Stanford community members
express confusion, anger and embarrass

ment over the issue.
Graduate students doing research on
campus worry about the effect the contro
versy will have on their ability to obtain
federal grant money. They fear Stanford's
competitiveness has been endangered.
Undergraduates say they have been
frustrated in their attempts to explain to
friends at other schools what is happen
ing here. Stanford's indirect-cost contro
versy has been largely overshadowed by
the war in the Persian Gulf, some stu
dents say, but the issue remains a source
of discussion and jokes.
Several students say their image of
Kennedy has been tainted by the contro
versy. "He hasn't givep a lot of reassur
ances to the students that everything's
going to be OK," says senior Joey Feld
man, a resident assistant in Madera. "It's
very difficult to defend the University and
his actions when he hasn't told us much."
In recent visits to dormitories and in
other meetings with students, Kennedy
says, there has been less criticism than he
anticipated. "I haven't been asked a sin
gle question about Hoover House 'scan
dal' issues," he says.
"I like to think it's because [students]
have made a judgment about that, and
it's a sophisticated judgment. It may be
they're polite. I suppose it's some of
each," he says.
Loss of confidence
Faculty members, too, have been reluc

tant to criticize Kennedy publicly. But pri
vately many say they are deeply con
cerned by the cloud that is hanging over
Stanford. Some faculty, including Engi
neering Prof. William Spicer, say there
has been a loss of confidence in Kennedy's
leadership.
And a small number of students and
faculty have even suggested what was
surely unthinkable several months ago:
that Kennedy should resign.
Graduate student Robert Miller put
the matter most bluntly is a recent letter
to the editor in The Daily: "President
Kennedy, to save the name of this great
university and the funding that is its
lifeblood, you should resign."
Kennedy says he's heard that sug
gested "maybe three times — and no
times at all from people I know.
"If I thought for one minute that my
resignation from this institution would
save its economic lifeblood, I'd be gone in
a New York second," he says.
"Were it to become plain to me or to
the Board (of Trustees) that I'm part of
the problem and not part of the solution
— I have no wish to be part of the prob
lem."
'Too long at the party'
Kennedy maintains that when the
time does come for him to step down, this
controversy will be largely forgotten and
won't handicap his future career choices.
"In a situation like this," he says, "where

there's a lot of media attention, your ten
dency is always to overestimate the tem
perature and prospective duration. I
think the more time people have to reflect
on it and learn about what's really hap
pening, the more it will be seen as a set of
issues about cost accounting."
For the past several years, Kennedy
says, he has had a standard answer when
asked when he might step down: He plans
to see Stanford through its Centennial
Campaign and then evaluate whether or
not he would like to do "one more differ
ent thing" before retiring.
Stanford's billion-dollar fund-raising
campaign will wind down in the fall, by
which time Kennedy will be 60. Over the
summer, he says, he'll be "looking around
here to decide whether I've stayed too
long at the party."
"As my thinking has evolved over the
last year," he says,"it has been in the
direction of feeling that it would be good
for me to put more rather than less time
in here to assure continuity and so forth."
Kennedy says he would like to see
Stanford through its next few years,
given the challenges presented by a tight
budget and his efforts to place a greater
emphasis on undergraduate teaching at
Stanford.
'Very, very remote'
One job Kennedy says he has little
desire to hold is U.S. senator. Despite
recurring rumors that he intends to run

for political office, such a possibility is
"very, very remote," Kennedy says.
"That's just never been an intention of
mine," he says. "I've denied it every time
it comes up. People never believe you
when you deny stuff. It is as absolutely as
remote a possibility now as it ever was."
Returning to government as the head
of a department or agency is more likely,
he says."I suppose at some point if that
opportunity came along and things were
sailing along fine here, that's the kind of
thing I might consider.
"On the other hand, so many interest
ing things are happening here academi
cally that the idea of just returning to
teach is very appealing. I mean I really
like to teach and I was good at it. In many
ways, the happiest future I envision for
myself is just going back to teaching."
'Aspect of personal harassment'
The present, however, remains uncom
fortable.
Being the subject of so much media
attention lately hasn't been easy.
Kennedy has been frustrated by the tone
of some newspapers' coverage of the indi
rect-cost controversy, particularly that of
the San Jose Mercury News.
"When you're accused of what amount
to personal abuses and when you're the
subject of rather bad, but nevertheless
unflattering, political cartoons in your
regional paper, that sort of attention is
not emotionally comfortable for anybody,
and it's not emotionally comfortable for
me or my family," Kennedy says. "There's
an aspect of personal harassment about
it.
But, ultimately, Kennedy says, there is
a lot more riding on Wednesday's hearing
than his reputation. He and other admin
istrators see the event as further evidence
of an increasingly troubled partnership
between scientific research universities
and the government.
For decades, in addition to funding
research projects at universities, the gov
ernment has been committed to support
ing the infrastructure of the institutions
— the roads, buildings, libraries and
administrative overhead that comprise a
university's "indirect costs."
During the last several years, as fed
eral budget pressures have intensified,
that commitment to support universities'
infrastructure has been less evident,
administrators say.
'Don't throw the baby out'
Stanford administrators say this
pressing policy issue has now been lost in
the flood of revelations about Hoover
House flower arrangements, antique pur
chases, dry cleaning bills and linen pur
chases that have dominated the press
accounts of the controversy thus far.
"I'm more worried about that than
anything else," Kennedy says. "My whole
objective in preparing for the hearing and
representing the institution will be to say,
'Look, if there are defects in the way
we're doing our work, and particularly if
a disparity has arisen between what the
government expects and what we can
deliver, we will fix that.
" 'But don't throw the baby out with
the bath water. Don't decide that univer
sities somehow ought to be punished for
these evolved disparities. Fix disparities,
but continue the policy of fully funding
the indirect as well as the direct cost of
research.' That's the only way we're
going to retain science capacity in the uni
versities and continue to deliver on that
commitment."
Dingell subcommittee staffers believe
Kennedy's fears are misplaced. Their
hearing, they say, is not about assessing
government's commitment to research
universities. Rather, it is to make sure
Stanford is spending taxpayers' money
wisely.
"We want to separate the legitimate
costs of research from what we as taxpay
ers feel has nothing to do with research,"
says one staffer, speaking on condition of
anonymity. "It's pretty basic. We just
don't want to pay for antiques. Stanford
wants full-cost recovery. We want full
accountability to the taxpayers."
It is possible that "somewhere down
the road" government support for
research couid be jeopardized as a result
of the Stanford hearing, the staffer con
cedes. But "that's just some of the collat
eral damage," she says.

Five days from now, just before 10
a.m. EST, University President Donald
Kennedy — bathed in camera flashes
and television lights — will enter room
2123 of the Rayburn House Office
Building in Washington, D.C.
There, in front of what is widely
regarded as the most powerful subcom
mittee of the U.S. House of Representa
tives, Kennedy will be forced to confront
what he says has become the most diffi
cult issue in his 10 years as Stanford's
president.
What follows won't be pretty.
"There may very well be questions
that are essentially designed to be per
sonally embarrassing," Kennedy says.
Questions like, " 'Did you know that
your wedding reception was being

charged to the taxpayers, Dr. Kennedy?'
.. . You've just got to deal with the per
sonal side of the assault as calmly and as
confidently as you can," Kennedy says.
Those launching the "assault" will be
members of the House Subcommittee on
Oversight and Investigations, chaired by
Michigan Democrat John Dingell.
Kennedy and Stanford's indirect-cost
practices will be on the receiving end.
The one-day hearing won't mark the
end of the controversy that has erupted
over Stanford's use of federal research
funds.
How much the University will be able
to charge the government for indirect
costs in the future is the subject of ongo
ing negotiations with the Office of Naval
Research, the federal agency that over
sees the University's use of federal
research funds. The negotiations are not
slated for completion until June. Stan-

'Part of the quality of a good chief executive is
that he or she sees around those corners. And,
you know, the stark fact is I didn't see around
this one.'
— University President Donald Kennedy

ford has literally millions and millions of
dollars riding on the outcome.
Nor is the hearing meant to generate
new legislation or to appropriate funds
to government agencies. The Dingell
subcommittee is fact-finding in nature.
It specializes in bringing to light what it
believes are breakdowns in federal law
and federal oversight — and it often
does so with theatrical flair.

What is likely to emerge from
Wednesday's hearing are a series of new
revelations about what has been
included in Stanford's indirect-cost
pools, some long lectures by Dingell on
the need for stricter management of fed
eral funds — and a lot of bad publicity
for Kennedy and Stanford.
The Dingell hearing won't be the first
time Kennedy has had to answer to

members of Congress. During the two
and-a-half years he spent as commis
sioner of the Food and Drug Administra
tion during the Carter years, Kennedy
testified before congressional commit
tees on dozens of occasions.
He garnered a lot of praise for his
work at the FDA, including a New York
Times editorial that lauded his efforts at
building morale within the agency. But
during his tenure as commissioner,
Kennedy also had to steer the agency
through some of the toughest fights it
had ever faced, including an attempted
ban on saccharin and investigations of
liquid-protein diets.
"I've testified before congressional
committees a lot," Kennedy says, "some
times under hostile circumstances. You
start right off by saying what's wrong
and saying, 'We're sorry, we goofed up and
we'll fix it."
Kennedy is to adopt a similar
posture Wednesday. In recent weeks, he

as an appropriate place to do it. You've got
to have a person who understands that
it's an important objective to invest in the
next generation of science as well as in
the current one. And if you have all of
those things together, then you have an
understanding. But it's not easy."
Taking heavy flak
Despite such efforts at explanation,
Stanford's credibility — and Kennedy's
— has suffered since the first federal
investigations began last fall.
"We're taking some very heavy flak,"
Kennedy acknowledges. "But let's
remember that we need to measure
results in the long term. In the long term,
Stanford will be judged on whether it was
appropriately responsive to the inquiry,
whether it confessed error where confes
sion was in order, whether it made full
disclosures and undertook corrective
action and whether it supported the right
policies and put them in place. That's
what we're going to be judged on in the
long run."
Kennedy compares the present public
reaction to Stanford's indirect-cost con
troversy to the public response that
accompanied Stanford's 1988 decision to
replace its Western Culture program with
Cultures, Ideas and Values, a program
that includes more works by women and
minorities. At the time of the decision,
several people in academia, including
then-Secretary of Education William
Bennett, accused Stanford of selling out
to radical students and "trashing" the
West.
"Remember that in the CIV contro
versy," Kennedy says, "there were people
who were very anxious to embarrass
Stanford, and they enjoyed a field day in
the early stages. But as we purposely
went about our business, as the faculty
debated and decided the issue, the more
reasonable and appropriate the changes
looked. It's my hope and belief that that's
exactly what's going to happen here."
Confusion, anger, embarrassment
Interviews with faculty members and
students during the past week suggest
that such a reversal will be an uphill bat
tle. Stanford community members
express confusion, anger and embarrass

ment over the issue.
Graduate students doing research on
campus worry about the effect the contro
versy will have on their ability to obtain
federal grant money. They fear Stanford's
competitiveness has been endangered.
Undergraduates say they have been
frustrated in their attempts to explain to
friends at other schools what is happen
ing here. Stanford's indirect-cost contro
versy has been largely overshadowed by
the war in the Persian Gulf, some stu
dents say, but the issue remains a source
of discussion and jokes.
Several students say their image of
Kennedy has been tainted by the contro
versy. "He hasn't givep a lot of reassur
ances to the students that everything's
going to be OK," says senior Joey Feld
man, a resident assistant in Madera. "It's
very difficult to defend the University and
his actions when he hasn't told us much."
In recent visits to dormitories and in
other meetings with students, Kennedy
says, there has been less criticism than he
anticipated. "I haven't been asked a sin
gle question about Hoover House 'scan
dal' issues," he says.
"I like to think it's because [students]
have made a judgment about that, and
it's a sophisticated judgment. It may be
they're polite. I suppose it's some of
each," he says.
Loss of confidence
Faculty members, too, have been reluc

tant to criticize Kennedy publicly. But pri
vately many say they are deeply con
cerned by the cloud that is hanging over
Stanford. Some faculty, including Engi
neering Prof. William Spicer, say there
has been a loss of confidence in Kennedy's
leadership.
And a small number of students and
faculty have even suggested what was
surely unthinkable several months ago:
that Kennedy should resign.
Graduate student Robert Miller put
the matter most bluntly is a recent letter
to the editor in The Daily: "President
Kennedy, to save the name of this great
university and the funding that is its
lifeblood, you should resign."
Kennedy says he's heard that sug
gested "maybe three times — and no
times at all from people I know.
"If I thought for one minute that my
resignation from this institution would
save its economic lifeblood, I'd be gone in
a New York second," he says.
"Were it to become plain to me or to
the Board (of Trustees) that I'm part of
the problem and not part of the solution
— I have no wish to be part of the prob
lem."
'Too long at the party'
Kennedy maintains that when the
time does come for him to step down, this
controversy will be largely forgotten and
won't handicap his future career choices.
"In a situation like this," he says, "where

there's a lot of media attention, your ten
dency is always to overestimate the tem
perature and prospective duration. I
think the more time people have to reflect
on it and learn about what's really hap
pening, the more it will be seen as a set of
issues about cost accounting."
For the past several years, Kennedy
says, he has had a standard answer when
asked when he might step down: He plans
to see Stanford through its Centennial
Campaign and then evaluate whether or
not he would like to do "one more differ
ent thing" before retiring.
Stanford's billion-dollar fund-raising
campaign will wind down in the fall, by
which time Kennedy will be 60. Over the
summer, he says, he'll be "looking around
here to decide whether I've stayed too
long at the party."
"As my thinking has evolved over the
last year," he says,"it has been in the
direction of feeling that it would be good
for me to put more rather than less time
in here to assure continuity and so forth."
Kennedy says he would like to see
Stanford through its next few years,
given the challenges presented by a tight
budget and his efforts to place a greater
emphasis on undergraduate teaching at
Stanford.
'Very, very remote'
One job Kennedy says he has little
desire to hold is U.S. senator. Despite
recurring rumors that he intends to run

for political office, such a possibility is
"very, very remote," Kennedy says.
"That's just never been an intention of
mine," he says. "I've denied it every time
it comes up. People never believe you
when you deny stuff. It is as absolutely as
remote a possibility now as it ever was."
Returning to government as the head
of a department or agency is more likely,
he says."I suppose at some point if that
opportunity came along and things were
sailing along fine here, that's the kind of
thing I might consider.
"On the other hand, so many interest
ing things are happening here academi
cally that the idea of just returning to
teach is very appealing. I mean I really
like to teach and I was good at it. In many
ways, the happiest future I envision for
myself is just going back to teaching."
'Aspect of personal harassment'
The present, however, remains uncom
fortable.
Being the subject of so much media
attention lately hasn't been easy.
Kennedy has been frustrated by the tone
of some newspapers' coverage of the indi
rect-cost controversy, particularly that of
the San Jose Mercury News.
"When you're accused of what amount
to personal abuses and when you're the
subject of rather bad, but nevertheless
unflattering, political cartoons in your
regional paper, that sort of attention is
not emotionally comfortable for anybody,
and it's not emotionally comfortable for
me or my family," Kennedy says. "There's
an aspect of personal harassment about
it.
But, ultimately, Kennedy says, there is
a lot more riding on Wednesday's hearing
than his reputation. He and other admin
istrators see the event as further evidence
of an increasingly troubled partnership
between scientific research universities
and the government.
For decades, in addition to funding
research projects at universities, the gov
ernment has been committed to support
ing the infrastructure of the institutions
— the roads, buildings, libraries and
administrative overhead that comprise a
university's "indirect costs."
During the last several years, as fed
eral budget pressures have intensified,
that commitment to support universities'
infrastructure has been less evident,
administrators say.
'Don't throw the baby out'
Stanford administrators say this
pressing policy issue has now been lost in
the flood of revelations about Hoover
House flower arrangements, antique pur
chases, dry cleaning bills and linen pur
chases that have dominated the press
accounts of the controversy thus far.
"I'm more worried about that than
anything else," Kennedy says. "My whole
objective in preparing for the hearing and
representing the institution will be to say,
'Look, if there are defects in the way
we're doing our work, and particularly if
a disparity has arisen between what the
government expects and what we can
deliver, we will fix that.
" 'But don't throw the baby out with
the bath water. Don't decide that univer
sities somehow ought to be punished for
these evolved disparities. Fix disparities,
but continue the policy of fully funding
the indirect as well as the direct cost of
research.' That's the only way we're
going to retain science capacity in the uni
versities and continue to deliver on that
commitment."
Dingell subcommittee staffers believe
Kennedy's fears are misplaced. Their
hearing, they say, is not about assessing
government's commitment to research
universities. Rather, it is to make sure
Stanford is spending taxpayers' money
wisely.
"We want to separate the legitimate
costs of research from what we as taxpay
ers feel has nothing to do with research,"
says one staffer, speaking on condition of
anonymity. "It's pretty basic. We just
don't want to pay for antiques. Stanford
wants full-cost recovery. We want full
accountability to the taxpayers."
It is possible that "somewhere down
the road" government support for
research couid be jeopardized as a result
of the Stanford hearing, the staffer con
cedes. But "that's just some of the collat
eral damage," she says.
