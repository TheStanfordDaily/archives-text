# Kennedy braces for hearing on indirect costs
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
Five days from now, just before 10
a.m. EST, University President Donald
Kennedy — bathed in camera flashes
and television lights — will enter room
2123 of the Rayburn House Office
Building in Washington, D.C.
There, in front of what is widely
regarded as the most powerful subcom
mittee of the U.S. House of Representa
tives, Kennedy will be forced to confront
what he says has become the most diffi
cult issue in his 10 years as Stanford's
president.
What follows won't be pretty.
"There may very well be questions
that are essentially designed to be per
sonally embarrassing," Kennedy says.
Questions like, " 'Did you know that
your wedding reception was being

charged to the taxpayers, Dr. Kennedy?'
.. . You've just got to deal with the per
sonal side of the assault as calmly and as
confidently as you can," Kennedy says.
Those launching the "assault" will be
members of the House Subcommittee on
Oversight and Investigations, chaired by
Michigan Democrat John Dingell.
Kennedy and Stanford's indirect-cost
practices will be on the receiving end.
The one-day hearing won't mark the
end of the controversy that has erupted
over Stanford's use of federal research
funds.
How much the University will be able
to charge the government for indirect
costs in the future is the subject of ongo
ing negotiations with the Office of Naval
Research, the federal agency that over
sees the University's use of federal
research funds. The negotiations are not
slated for completion until June. Stan-

'Part of the quality of a good chief executive is
that he or she sees around those corners. And,
you know, the stark fact is I didn't see around
this one.'
— University President Donald Kennedy

ford has literally millions and millions of
dollars riding on the outcome.
Nor is the hearing meant to generate
new legislation or to appropriate funds
to government agencies. The Dingell
subcommittee is fact-finding in nature.
It specializes in bringing to light what it
believes are breakdowns in federal law
and federal oversight — and it often
does so with theatrical flair.

What is likely to emerge from
Wednesday's hearing are a series of new
revelations about what has been
included in Stanford's indirect-cost
pools, some long lectures by Dingell on
the need for stricter management of fed
eral funds — and a lot of bad publicity
for Kennedy and Stanford.
The Dingell hearing won't be the first
time Kennedy has had to answer to

members of Congress. During the two
and-a-half years he spent as commis
sioner of the Food and Drug Administra
tion during the Carter years, Kennedy
testified before congressional commit
tees on dozens of occasions.
He garnered a lot of praise for his
work at the FDA, including a New York
Times editorial that lauded his efforts at
building morale within the agency. But
during his tenure as commissioner,
Kennedy also had to steer the agency
through some of the toughest fights it
had ever faced, including an attempted
ban on saccharin and investigations of
liquid-protein diets.
"I've testified before congressional
committees a lot," Kennedy says, "some
times under hostile circumstances. You
start right off by saying what's wrong
