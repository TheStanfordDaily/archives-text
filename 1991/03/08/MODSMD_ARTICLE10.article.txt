# Frat awaits response to proposal
## 
### Connie Chang Editorial staff 
The Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity has not yet
received a University response to its new proposal
for on-campus housing, and administrators have not
set a definite timetable for evaluating it.
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs Michael Jackson
said the University will formally respond to the pro
posal. However, he said the University is currently
only considering new housing proposals that further
its goal of guaranteeing four years of housing for
undergraduates.
The administration's current priority is to
increase coeducational housing facilities on campus
open to all students, he said.
Acting Dean of Student Affairs Norm Robinson
said the "University has been trying to make it clear
that there isn't going to be an expansion of the num
ber of housed fraternal groups," following a 1982
policy against increasing subjectively selective group
housing.
At the same time, he said, the University is "hon
oring the commitment it has made" that housed fra
ternities will not be eliminated unless they do not
meet University housing standards. For fraternities,
those standards include filling housing quotas and
maintaining good behavior as a house.
Fraternity members remain hopeful. Fraternity
President Steve Lyons said the fraternity wants to
"keep the issue on the table because we know we're

right, and that's gotta come out."
The proposal Alpha Epsilon Pi submitted Tues
day is an updated version of a proposal written three
years ago by the fraternity's founders. The frater
nity has submitted a housing proposal each year for
the last three years.
This year, Alpha Epsilon Pi submitted a copy of
the proposal to Stanford trustee John Friedenrich at
his request. Lyons said Friedenrich called and asked
for a copy because he thought it "made sense and the
University should look into it."
Friedenrich is out of town this week and could not
be reached for comment.
Bob Hamrdla, assistant to University President
Donald Kennedy, said the trustees will review the
proposal if Kennedy recommends such action. The
board primarily deals with requests for policy
changes, not individual requests that may be in con
flict with current University policy, he added.
Lyons accused the University of being "hypocriti
cal and closed-minded" because its policy is to treat
students as adults, "but you're not really an adult if
[the University] is telling you where to live and that
it's not good to live with all guys."
He claimed the University has been "phasing out"
housed fraternities for the last 10 years.
Robinson denied the University wants to elimi
nate housed fraternities. He said the number of
housed fraternities will remain the same "as long as
[the fraternities] comply with the standards that
apply to other residences."
