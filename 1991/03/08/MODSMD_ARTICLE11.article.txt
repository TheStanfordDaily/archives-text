Would stray kangaroos wan
dering around campus allow
Stanford to regain the top spot
in the U.S. News and World
Report college poll? After all,
no other university in the
nation has them.
The Hammer and Coffin
Society plans to purchase kan
garoos with money earmarked
for Council of Presidents'
salaries if its slate is elected in
the upcoming spring election.
The society, composed of the
leaders of the Chaparral,
released their COP and under
graduate senatorial slates for
the spring election yesterday.
The "Click Here for Fee
Refund" COP slate is com
posed of sophomore Srinivas
Kumar, junior Amy Arends and

seniors David Levin and
Michael Schreiber.
Undergraduate senatorial
candidates who have completed
their nomination petitions are
freshman Anthony Sirna and
junior David Hyatt. Others are
still collecting the required sig
natures and may be added to
the slate.
Besides the purchase of kan
garoos, the party's platform
includes the prohibition of
zone defense in intramural
basketball and the investing of
ASSU funds in high-risk, high
yield securities, Schreiber said.
"Let other groups argue
about multiculturalism, stu
dent services and universal
student IDs," Schreiber said.
"Everyone knows that they are
important, and if there is some
thing we could do about them
we would."
