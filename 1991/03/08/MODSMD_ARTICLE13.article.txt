More costs plague B-l bomber
WASHINGTON (AP) — Congressional
investigators say the B-1B bomber, a plane the
Air Force contends is "ready to go to war now,"
is several years and more than $1 billion from
being cured of serious problems.
Officials of the General Accounting Office
told a House panel Wednesday that the $30 bil
lion supersonic aircraft program is plagued by
engine, radar and anti-icing problems.
The GAO, the investigative arm of
Congress, estimates that it will cost more than
$1 billion to solve the problems, including
about $830 million for the radar system and
from $200 million to $700 million for the
engines and anti-icing system.
"These three problems are not close to
being solved," Nancy Kingsbury of the GAO
testified to the House Government Operations
Cqmmittee. She said the agency does not
expect the work to be completed until after
1994 and perhaps as late as 2000.
Albania tries to stem exodus
VIENNA, Austria (AP) — Albanian authori
ties yesterday clamped military control on three
mtyor ports to halt a chaotic exodus and stepped
up security in the capital of Tirana after at least
one person was killed in clashes with police.
The move came as Italy, overwhelmed by
thousands of Albanians flooding its eastern
ports, asked Tirana to stop the flow of refugees
and pledged more aid to Europe's poorest
nation.
Tens of thousands of Albanians have fled
Albania the past week, many across the Adriatic
Sea for Italy and others overland to neighboring
Yugoslavia.
Former Indian prime minister
accused of thwarting elections
NEW DELHI, India (AP) — Two leading
political parties yesterday accused former
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of retracting a
public commitment for new elections and try
ing to take power "through the back door."
The accusations, and subsequent denials by
Gandhi's Congress Party, deepened the politi
cal impasse caused by Prime Minister Chandra
Shekhar's sudden resignation Wednesday.
All major parties, including the Congress,
have said they favor holding general elections
in an attempt to determine a clear ruler. The
last elections, in 1989, yielded a hung Parlia
ment and both governments formed since then
have been headed by parties in a minority.
