# End of U.S. military aid to E1 Salvador proposed

WASHINGTON (AP) - Eight
Democratic senators and 30 congress
men proposed yesterday a cutoff of all
U.S. military aid to El Salvador.
"For the past decade, the United
States has armed, trained and
financed an army responsible for
abducting, torturing and killing thou
sands of Salvadorans," said Brock
Adams, D-Wash., chief Senate sponsor
of the legislation.
"A decade and 70,000 deaths later,
it's time to bring the new world order
to El Salvador and change the course

of U.S. policy toward that country,"
Adams said .
Last year, Congress approved $85
million in military aid to El Salvador
but included a stipulation that made
half of it contingent on improvements
in that country's human rights policy.
In January, President Bush said
that he had determined enough
improvement had been made to free up
the other $42.5 million and plans to
release it next week.
Sens. Tom Harkin of lowa, Ted
Kennedy and John Kerrv of Mas

sachusetts, Paul Simon of Illinois,
Alan Cranston of California, Barbara
Mikulski of Maryland, and Paul Well
stone of Minnesota joined Adams as
Senate co-sponsors of the cutoff bill.
"We've seen what allied actions can
do in the Middle East," Harkin told
reporters. "It's time we use the United
Nations, just as we did in the Middle
East, not to conduct war but to build
peace in El Salvador. The best way to
do that is quit funding their military,"
he said.
Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash.,

meanwhile, spearheaded the House
group.
"The United States has been a will
ing accomplice in this war and these
abuses, providing over a billion dollars
to the Salvadoran military over the
past 10 years," he said. "We have per
petuated and even institutionalized
war in El Salvador."
Bush's announcement in January
that he intends to send more military
aid to El Salvador sent a signal to its
army that "all is well and business as
usual can resume," McDermott said.
