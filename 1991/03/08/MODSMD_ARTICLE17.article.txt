Controversy inevitably
abounds with speaker
choice for graduation

IT MUST BE ONE OF THE
toughest job profiles there is.
Wanted: Stanford Commence
ment speaker. Must be fitting,
funny and famous. Must be all
things to all people.
Qualifications will be second
guessed for months. Don't call us;
we'll call you.
John Gardner faces what is, to
say the least, a challenging task.
We at Stanford seem to want a lot
from our graduation speakers;
what's more, we all want different
things.
Some want inspiration — an
important message that will touch
the graduates and send them along
a guided path. Others just want to
be entertained.
Many maintain it is the gradua
tion speech that matters, not the
speaker. The speech itself and the
way it is delivered are the primary
concerns.
But for others, what matters is
the persona of the speaker. They
want a recognizable person of
stature, someone who can match
the pomp and circumstance of the
Commencement ceremony.
We would all like to see someone
whose philosophy and actions have
had an impact on the world in
which we live. But Stanford stu
dents will never agree on whose
impact has been important or posi
tive.
Campus groups will inevitably
complain about the selection of any
person whose actions or politics
they dislike.
So child advocacy and public ser
vice are about as controversial as
we're going to get.
The choice of Commencement

speaker has more armchair quar
terbacks than the decision to "go
for it" on fourth down at Big
Game. It's a decision that everyone
feels qualified to make. It's a posi
tion that few are deemed qualified
to handle.
Gardner may be such a person.
He shaped the domestic policy of
the Johnson administration, guid
ing the president's war on poverty
and his Great Society program.
Gardner went on to found Com
mon Cause, an organization
designed to lobby for the interests
of the American citizen.
He was subsequently awarded
the Presidential Medal of Freedom,
the nation's highest civilian award.
The Los Angeles Times wrote of
Gardner at the time, "It is difficult
to think of an American, in or out
of the public life, who has had a
more positive influence on the
nation's political institutions in so
short a time."
The Wall Street Journal noted,
"Few private citizens have had as
lasting an impact on the
governmental system as he."
Gardner is also a Stanford grad
uate and a Stanford professor —
fitting criteria for a Centennial
Commencement speaker.
Gardner may come as close as
anyone to fitting the demanding
criteria that Stanford imposes on
its Commencement speakers.
Inevitably, many will complain.
Gardner may come to realize the
truth of the maxim: "Half of 'em
are for you. Half of 'em are against
you. The ones who are against you
are a lot louder."
Hopefully he will take it all in
stride.
Hopefully he will realize that,
like wearing the heavy robes under
the sweltering June heat, it's all
just part of the job.
Nonetheless, his task will be dif
ficult.
We wish him the best of luck.
