Achievements of wrestling team should be recognized

The pacific 10 conference
Wrestling Championships were
last week? Did anyone know? If
you read The Daily, chances are that you
didn't.
The Daily made no preview of the
event.
It's highly likely that you have never
been to a wrestling meet and never plan
to go to one. For some reason, the Stan
ford community has never been too
interested in its wrestling team and The
Daily's efforts, or, rather, lack of efforts,
help to perpetuate this apathy.
It is no wonder that the Pac-10
wrestling tournament held in Burnham
Pavilion on Feb. 23 and 24 attracted
more of the opposing teams' fans than it
did our own.
Having played football at Stanford
and wrestled until a season-ending
injury, I am acutely aware of the hard
work that athletes endure in order to
prepare for competition. But if hard

work, determination and the many hours
of relentless preparation were rewarded
by fan participation, the stands would
have been packed for the Pac-10
Wrestling Championships.
I am not trying to sell you on attend
ing Stanford's wrestling meets, but only
trying to give due recognition to the Car
dinal wrestling team, something that
The Daily ignored. Although The Daily
was generous enough to tuck a half-col
umn on the tournament's results into
the sports section, captioned, "Wrestlers
end five-year drought," its negative con
notation did not reflect the accomplish
ments of the Stanford wrestling pro
gram.
If The Daily were consistent in its
sports coverage, it would have titled
another article on the same page, "Gym
nasts finish second to last," instead of
"Gymnasts take third."
Equally frustrating was the fact that
the article made no mention of the

exceptional performance by Matt
Topham, second-place finisher in his
weight class. The underdog Topham
earned a match in the finals by decisively
defeating a nationally ranked wrestler.
In the finals, Topham battled against the
nation's third-ranked wrestler and lost
by the narrow margin of 9-7.
At a University loaded with Pac-10
placers and All-American athletes,
Topham's performance and the perfor
mances of Pac-10 champions Steve Bud
die and Steve Yarbrough may not raise
too many eyebrows, but there is some
thing that sets them apart — they are
not on athletic scholarships. Unfortu
nately, the wrestling program doesn't
have any.
Therefore, the fact that Stanford took
sixth in one of the most competitive
wrestling conferences in the nation,
against schools that all have wrestling
scholarships, is a tremendous accom-

plishment and a great tribute to Coach
Chris Horpel, one of the best wrestling
coaches in the nation.
The hundreds of hours Stanford
wrestlers spend in the weight and
wrestling rooms epitomize desire, hard
work and love of a sport to its fullest
extent. The Daily's lack of coverage robs
Horpel and his wrestlers of even this
limited recognition.
It is likely the Stanford wrestling
team will be a top-15 finisher at the
NCAA Division I championships, a tour
nament that will host the best wrestlers
in the country. Perhaps The Daily will
take the courtesy to cover the NCAA
tournament and the performances of
Topham, Yarbrough and Buddie, to let
them know their efforts and exceptional
accomplishments are not completely
unrecognized.
