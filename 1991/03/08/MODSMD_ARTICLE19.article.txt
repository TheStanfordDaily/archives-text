# Silly whinings ignore Gardner's impressive list of contributions
## 
### 
I found it distressing to read in The
Daily article announcing the selection of
John Gardner as the 1991 Commence
ment speaker that some students (one
actually was willing to be quoted) wanted
more of a "name" speaker. Another, in
the spirit of politically correct thinking,
complained that it wasn't a woman.
These silly remarks sr.y a deal
more about the ignorance of the whining
student(s) than about the quality of the
choice, which is a superb one.
It is hard to imagine more of a
"name" speaker than Gardner. His many
contributions to Stanford over the years
are worthy of recognition. It is even

more difficult to think of a speaker who
might have something more useful to say
to an audience of Stanford graduates and
parents.
Gardner is, incidentally, an excellent
speaker, fully in his prime. I heard him
speak to a large public gathering last
year, and I was very impressed.
To the unhappy students, I would
only say, "If you want a 'name' act for
entertainment, buy a ticket to the Circle
Star Theater or the Oakland Coliseum.
Kenny Rogers and Jose Canseco are
worth every nickel you will pay to see
them.
If you want to learn something from a
wise man of great public accomplish
ment, attend your graduation in June.
And think twice before you sound off
next time.
