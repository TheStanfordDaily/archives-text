# Med School gets more applicants

The Stanford School of
Medicine, along with medical
schools across the country, experi
enced a dramatic increase in appli
cations this year.
The number of applications to
the Stanford Medical School has
increased about 17 percent, from
4,189 applications in 1989-90 to
4,895 this year, said Judy Colwell,
assistant director of the Medical
School's Office of Admissions.
Statistics released Dec. 8 by the
Association of American Medical
Colleges show the number of
applications rose by 18.6 percent
nationally.
Although there is no clear
explanation for this jump, school
administrators around the coun
try are pointing to changes in the
job marketplace, the new format
of the Medical College Admission
Test and even the Persian Gulf
war to explain the increase.
The increase means tougher
competition for the fixed number
of spots at top medical schools.
Stanford administrators predict
they will offer admission to 4 per
cent of the applicants in order to
fill the 86 first-year positions
available next year, Colwell said.
The Harvard School of Med
icine has seen a 14 percent in
crease in applications, said Dr.
Gerald Foster, the dean of admis
sions. He added that despite the
larger number, the quality of the
average applicant has not dimin
ished.
Foster said he believes that
more students are applying to
medical schools for the "right rea
sons" and that they realize the
"intrinsic value" of the profession.
At the UC-San Francisco Medi
cal School, applications are up by
15 percent, said Fred Pena,
administrative assistant at the
schools' office of admissions.
Pena said he thinks changes in
the format of the Medical College
Admission Test may be behind the
increased number of applicants
there.
Starting next year, UC-San
Francisco and many other top
schools will require applicants to
submit results from the new ver
sion of the test. "I understand
that there is more writing
involved" on the new test, Pena
said. "This may have generated
some panic" and resulted in more
applications this year, he added.
Stanford's policy is to accept
either version of the test and will
continue to do so until September
1993, officials said.
Pena also said more people
might have applied because of
fears about the possibility of being
drafted to serve in the Gulf war.
Some students may have applied
because graduate students are
allowed to defer military service
until the end of the term during
which they are drafted, he added.
