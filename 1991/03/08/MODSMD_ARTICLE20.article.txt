# Editorials on housing and 'Herstory' were completely ridiculous
## 
### 
Tell me that Tuesday's (March 5) edi
torials were jokes. Daily editorials are
often absurd, but Tuesday's "Time for
Herstory" and "A Wise Housing Swap"
took the cake.
The first editorial asserted that bring
ing Faye Waddleton to speak at Stanford
was "unfortunate" because she "will
likely take a political stand on reproduc
tive and abortion rights." God forbid
that a speaker sparks discussion, or
worse, controversy. (Eeek, not that!) God
forbid that a woman who speaks during
Women's History Week address issues
central to women's history.
The second editorial, though address

ing a completely different issue, was
equally inane. First, it declared Durand
and 353 Campus Drive "hardly known
for their strong traditions and house
spirit." By what standards does the Daily
edit board judge the traditions and spirit
of these dorms?
Residents of 353 Campus have delin
eated convincing arguments against the
University's decision and offered viable
solutions, and what has the Daily to say
about it? "Ignore the protests and pro
ceed with the move," i.e., ignore student
concerns and proceed without scruples
— so that Delta Tau Delta fraternity
members can have more spacious rooms?
Perhaps the next Daily editorial could
call on the University to allot housing
according to size. Small (and quiet) stu
dents could be assigned to Lagunita
Court with its tiny rooms and thin walls.
