# Kofi Bruce & Andrew Katz
## A 						Stanford Easter 
### 
IN THE BEGINNING THERE was
the word, and the word was FINALS.
J.S. Christiansen and his 12 friends
were seated around a table in the History
Corner preparing for their religious stud
ies final exam. On the table before them
lay two large pizzas and a case of beer.
J.S. stood, raised his beer, looked out at
all his friends, and said, "Take this beer
and divide it amongst yourselves, for I tell
you that from now on, I will not drink any
more beer until spring break."
After he had thanked them all for com
ing to the study group, he took up the
pizza and passed the box around saying,
"About $30 of my money went toward
this pizza, so when you take the test, you
better remember that I paid for you."
Downing another swig of his brew, J.S.
then said ominously, "One of you will
blow the curve tomorrow." They all
denied this possibility and returned home
to sleep.
The day of the exam, J.S. pulled away
from his friends, knelt down in the corner
of the Physics Tank, and prayed to the
God of Partial Credit (Fleet Street). When
he finished, he rejoined his friends who
were sleeping, and said to them, "Why are
you sleeping? Wake up and sign the
Honor Code so that you do not enter into
temptation."
During the test, a crowd entered, led
by Judas, one of J.S.'s 12 friends. He sat
down next to J.S., leaned over, and began
to kiss his butt. J.S. said to him, "Judas,
would you try to cheat bv kissing up to
me?"
Once the test was over, angry Judas
went to the teaching assistant and told

him that J.S. had cheated on the exam.
The TA seized J.S. and led him away to
Professor Pilate's office. The TA and the
professor grilled J.S. about Buddhism,
blindfolding him and making him recite
the Bhagavad-Gita from memory.
After conferring with Dean Herod,
they decided to bring J.S. in front of the
entire class for judgment. Pilate asked
them, "This man received a perfect score
on the exam, thus setting the curve. There
have been allegations, however, that he
cheated. Should I eliminate his score and
give him a D-, or should I allow his grade
to stand?" The students responded, "Cru
cify him! Give him a D-!!"
And thus Pilate killed J.S.'s grade
point average.
During spring break all of the students
rested according to the commandment,
drinking the fruit of the vine and dancing
and singing unto the Lord.
On the first day of spring quarter,
J.S.'s friends went for a walk and saw
Mary, Joanna and the women from J.S.'s
dorm. The women told them that they
had gone to J.S.'s room and had found it
empty. J.S.'s roommate had said to them,
"Why do you look for J.S. here? Me has
transferred."
The 12 friends did not buy a word of
the women's story and walked away call
ing it an idle tale.
Later that day two of the women
walked through White Plaza, speaking of
all that had happened. J.S. drew near to
them and followed them. They could not
recognize him because he had gone gra
nola over the break. He approached them
asking about their conversation. They

responded, "Are you the only one on cam
pus who has not heard the things that
have happened here?"
J.S. asked, "What things?"
The women replied, "Concerning J.S.
of Naranja, who was a great student, and
how his religious studies class delivered
him up to be condemned to Academic
Death."
Upon reaching the dorm, the women
invited J.S. to dinner where they recog
nized him for who he was. When they
began to question him about it, he shoved
the remaining bread in his mouth and
vanished.
The two women went to J.S.'s friends
and told them what had occurred. As they
stood around talking about it, J.S. walked
into the room and addressed his stunned
friends, saying, "Thus it is written that
my GPA should suffer for your unchecked
Honor Code violations. But realize that
one week after the exam, I rose again at
UC-Berkeley."
The moral of our obscure little tale is
this: "Stress not, that you be not stressed.
For if you suffer Academic Death, you can
always be reborn at UC-Berkeley."
Whatever.

Kofi Bruce and Andrew Katz are
resigned to the fact that this column
made very little sense. They would like to
thank Luke (as in Matthew, Mark, Luke
and John) for his immense help with the
story line and much of the dialogue.

them and followed them. They could not
recognize him because he had gone gra
nola over the break. He approached them
asking about their conversation. They

responded, "Are you the only one on cam
pus who has not heard the things that
have happened here?"
J.S. asked, "What things?"
The women replied, "Concerning J.S.
of Naranja, who was a great student, and
how his religious studies class delivered
him up to be condemned to Academic
Death."
Upon reaching the dorm, the women
invited J.S. to dinner where they recog
nized him for who he was. When they
began to question him about it, he shoved
the remaining bread in his mouth and
vanished.
The two women went to J.S.'s friends
and told them what had occurred. As they
stood around talking about it, J.S. walked
into the room and addressed his stunned
friends, saying, "Thus it is written that
my GPA should suffer for your unchecked
Honor Code violations. But realize that
one week after the exam, I rose again at
UC-Berkeley."
The moral of our obscure little tale is
this: "Stress not, that you be not stressed.
For if you suffer Academic Death, you can
always be reborn at UC-Berkeley."
Whatever.

Kofi Bruce and Andrew Katz are
resigned to the fact that this column
made very little sense. They would like to
thank Luke (as in Matthew, Mark, Luke
and John) for his immense help with the
story line and much of the dialogue.
