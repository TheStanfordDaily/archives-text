Dear Bug,
Why does the Coffee House
shut down at midnight when the
place is almost always packed at
closing time ?
I discovered two key things in
attempting to respond to this
question: 1) The intrigue and
romance involved in the actual
answer pales in comparison to the
elaborate, overblown schemes I
had previously concocted, and 2)
Wrigley's Spearmint Gum is Pure
Chewing Satisfaction.
So, since I don't get paid until I
churn out a certain number of
characters, I'll go with my half
baked, totally unsubstantiated
theories first, and save the facts
for the end.
• Theory #1: The Coffee House
does not close down at midnight.
As the bells toll 12 times and the
innocent, ordinary contingent of
the crowd wearily treks home, the
"regulars" remain for a series of
macabre spectacles to which few
are allowed to bear witness.
I mean, isn't it a little strange
how eager they are to usher you
out of the place? One can only
imagine what twisted, malevolent
rituals transpire while the rest of
the campus sleeps.
Garbed as beasts, the partici
pants, bewitched by the miasma of
evil that emanates from this
orgiastic ceremony of sinister
intent, can hardly be described as
human. Howling, they prance in a
circle, in the center of which the
Alchemist-King of their insidious
sect sacrifices a newborn babe to
the pagan god Baal.
The familiar coffee pots are
substituted by decanters filled
with human blood; the soothing
strains of the newly-purchased
jukebox replaced with the cries of
human torment.
• Theory #2: Legend has it that
the Coffee House was originally
established, in the late Gothic
period, the hands of Baron Von
Stajnfiord's Fairy Godmother.
The late Baron used the Coffee

House to woo a local princess, but
only had until midnight before the
cashiers were transformed back
into mice, the ever-present chess
players into cute, furry bunnies.
Unless he won her over by the
12th stroke of the church clock,
the entire building would be
transmogrified into the giant,
stinking orange pumpkin from
which it had sprung.
And even though the Baron
made a complete ass out of him-,
self that fabled evening and never
received the princess' favor, the
spell the Fairy Godmother cast
still applies.
If anyone is in the building at
midnight — Shazam! — the Cof
fee House is suddenly a colossal
rotting vegetable that will eventu
ally find its way into those myste
rious Food Service meat sauces.
• Theory #3: The artistes that
frequent the Coffee House are to
blame. Indeed, these philosopher
revolutionaries, these Bohemian
keepers of the avant-garde, these
misunderstood souls forever
doomed to wallow in the torment
of ultimate "hip-ness," lie at the
crux of the matter.
As the witching hour
approaches, the sheer volume of
malcontent, of angst, builds to
such an alarming level that to
keep the place open is to risk aes
thetic doom. With so many berets,
black jumpsuits, clove cigarettes
and copies of "Zen and the Art of
Motorcycle Maintenance" in the
same room, something bad, albeit
"complex," is bound to happen.
• Theory #4: It all has to do
with that crazy indirect cost thing
we've all been hearing so much
about.
• Ihe Truth: The correct
answer is far simpler. The lad who
answered the phone at the Coffee
House, upon hearing the ques
tion, responded, "Because we
want to go home." That's basically
it, folks.
No devilish incantations. No
dance of death.
Pretty dumb, eh?
