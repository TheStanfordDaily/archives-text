"Women are reminded . . . that they are not sup
posed to appear in pedal pushers, shorts, jeans or
bathing suits on campus below the post office. This
includes the Quad . . . both inside and outside," read
a Daily article about Miss Elva Brown, chief coun
selor for women.
According to Brown, "It has never been the
acceptable practice or good taste for college women
to appear in playclothes on the Quad or downtown."
(What's the matter? Don't you think those cute little
sailor suits should be worn all the time? I know I do.)

The world-famous war correspondent and natu
ralist Ernest Baynes spoke on campus of the impor
tance of "our animal allies in the Great War."
Baynes spoke of the great contribution of the
homing pigeon to the war effort in sending informa
tion. "Large maps or moving picture films went into
a knapsack over the breast of the animal, strapped
on over the shoulders," he said. (Modeling the latest
in war fashion, Polly is equipped with a Gucci purse
and matching Polo gas mask.)
Animals such as donkeys, camels and even Scot
tish collies were used to transport supplies to the
front. (Can you imagine Lassie toting a machine
gun? "All right, Timmy. I'm sick of saving your
butt." Rat-a-tat-tat-tat. )
