## Stanford waits for tournament news 
### 
Ybu can see it on the faces
of students across cam
pus. It's there in the low
mumble emanating from the
classroom and the computer
cluster. A sense of impending
doom hovers over Stanford, as
we await Sunday's heralding of
the heinous tradition.

No, I'm not talking about
Dead Week. I'm talking about
the NCAA tournament.
Sunday morning, those
friendly folks at the Selection
Committee unleash the men's
and women's brackets on the
unsuspecting public, guaran
teeing that they will be the
most hated people in the land
for at least the next few days,
until the games actually start.
That's where I come in. I
have decided to warn you, our
reader, and to prepare you for
the shock that comes with such
querulous decision-making.
Because it's a proven fact that
Stanford basketball always
gets screwed by the NCAA.
Sorry, but there is no way to
couch the situation in less
offensive terms.
Maybe it's the drug-testing
suit that several Stanford ath
letes won against the NCAA
several years ago. Maybe it's
our academic reputation.
Maybe we win too many tennis
and swimming titles. But they
really don't like us.
The Cardinal women's
coach Tara VanDerveer told me
she's having trouble sleeping
these days, she's so excited
about the tournament. Funny,
I too am losing sleep, but not in
anticipation. In dread.
First, the real bombshell:
the men ain't making the
Sweet 64. Hopefully, the car

nage in Tucson a few weeks ago
kept you from getting any
unwarranted hopes up. Bar
ring a major national catastro
phe that wipes out the entire
Top 25, Keefe and Co. will be
playing the entertaining NIT
game the next few weeks.
Cheer up. The No. 9 Cardi
nal women will definitely be
one of the top 16 seeds, get a
bye, and host a second-round
NCAA game in Maples, most
likely on March 16. Beyond
that . . . the picture is a little
hazy. But given past history,
I'm not too optimistic on the
team's destination.
Wait a minute'? Hey, Dave,
are you on drugs? Stanford
won the title last year, remem
ber?
I know, I know. That's part
of the problem. Things were
too perfect last season. Stan
ford, ranked No. 2 or 3 all year
and 27-1 going into the tour
ney, pulled the No. 1 seed in the
West Region, which it hap
pened to host. The Cardinal
wiped the floor with the teams
the NCAA sacrificed to them at
Maples and then went to
Knoxville, Tenn. for the Final
Four.
Meanwhile, the Cardinal
found the path to the title
cleared for them, as two top
contenders lost in their region
al. Undefeated, No. 1-ranked
Louisiana Tech unexpectedly
fell, and gracious Final Four
host school Tennessee bowed
out early as well. From there,
the championship was like
picking cherries.
But the Cardinal had an
incredibly talented team last
year. This season eerily
reminds me of two years ago,
when the team was just very,
very good. That year, Stanford
did not have the advantage of a
home regional. Still, an unde
feated conference season, 26-2
record, and No. 4 ranking
should have been enough for
the top seed in the West, right?
Sorry. You could almost hear
the NCAA snickering in the

Hirning
background when it was
announced that the Cardinal
would instead be given a No. 2
seed and sent into the Midwest
Regional to take on Player of the
Year Venus Lacey and her fear
some Louisiana Tech squad — on
the Lady Techsters' home floor.
Stanford played well, blowing
out lowa in the regional semis,
but then fell to the defending
national champions, 85-75.
"That was terrible," said Van-
Derveer, remembering the night
mare that the NCAA visited on
her team.
That same season, the NCAA
nailed the Stanford men's team as
well, sending the No. 13-ranked,
third-seeded Cardinal across the
country (to Greensboro, N.C., of
all places) and matching it with
lightning-quick, upset-minded
Siena in the first round. Even you
freshmen remember the horrify
ing result: NCAA-Siena 80, Stan
ford 78.
Just a coincidence? So's the
fact that the Pope's Catholic,
then.
VanDerveer has fielded many
questions about the Eastern bias
in college basketball recently,
specifically in the women's game.
Teams east of the Mississippi.

dominate the polls (voted on by a
mtyority of Eastern sportswrit
ers), holding all eight spots ahead
of the Cardinal and most behind
it.
VanDerveer does believe there
is a poll bias against schools in the
West, but hopes that the NCAA
selection committee doesn't share
it. She notes that many teams
ranked ahead of the Cardinal
haven't played as tough a sched
ule and have an inflated ranking
— including top-ranked Penn
State.
"Who've they played?" Van-
Derveer queried of the Nittany
Lions. "You could be ranked first
or second, and you might not get
[in the) top three seeds, because of
the power ratings.
"The West sometimes doesn't
get the publicity, we don't have
the numbers of schools, and the
heart of basketball is back there
(in the East)," she said, "but we
kind of put it on the map last year.
The West kind of has an inferior
ity complex, but we don't need it.
We can play with anybody."
VanDerveer believes that the
Cardinal deserves the No. 1 seed
in the West, despite the ranking to
the contrary. She does have her
team's murderous schedule to
wave in the Committee's face:
Stanford has played eight teams
in the Top 20, has beaten No. 4
Georgia, and has lost to just one
school not in the top 12 in the

country.
Then there are the distance
and economic factors. The 1989
West Regional was in Texas (iron
ically the site of the Mid-West
Regional this year — geography is
relative in the NCAA's world), lout
this year the fine town of Las
Vegas will host it. VanDerveer and
others believe the NCAA would
only be making sense by putting
Stanford and perhaps Washington
where their fans could more easily
attend the game.
But it may simply come down
to this: two years ago, Stanford
was nobody. Now, it is the defend
ing champ. The crucial question
is: Will Stanford's title last year
be respected, or will it be viewed
as a flash in the pan?
"We have to earn the respect,"
VanDerveer admitted. "But if we
win it again this year, we can
establish ourselves."
But can Stanford repeat and
duplicate what everyone expects
UNLV to do on the men's side?
This is a classic vicious cycle. It's
possible, but not without a little
luck, and a little help from the
NCAA, in my opinion. And we
know how likely the latter is.
But with the tournament
seemingly wide open this year
(season-long No. 1 Virginia lost
last weekend in the semis of its
conference tournament), Van-
Derveer fears no one.
