## Stanford waits for tournament news 
### 
Ybu can see it on the faces
of students across cam
pus. It's there in the low
mumble emanating from the
classroom and the computer
cluster. A sense of impending
doom hovers over Stanford, as
we await Sunday's heralding of
the heinous tradition.

No, I'm not talking about
Dead Week. I'm talking about
the NCAA tournament.
Sunday morning, those
friendly folks at the Selection
Committee unleash the men's
and women's brackets on the
unsuspecting public, guaran
teeing that they will be the
most hated people in the land
for at least the next few days,
until the games actually start.
That's where I come in. I
have decided to warn you, our
reader, and to prepare you for
the shock that comes with such
querulous decision-making.
Because it's a proven fact that
Stanford basketball always
gets screwed by the NCAA.
Sorry, but there is no way to
couch the situation in less
offensive terms.
Maybe it's the drug-testing
suit that several Stanford ath
letes won against the NCAA
several years ago. Maybe it's
our academic reputation.
Maybe we win too many tennis
and swimming titles. But they
really don't like us.
The Cardinal women's
coach Tara VanDerveer told me
she's having trouble sleeping
these days, she's so excited
about the tournament. Funny,
I too am losing sleep, but not in
anticipation. In dread.
First, the real bombshell:
the men ain't making the
Sweet 64. Hopefully, the car

nage in Tucson a few weeks ago
kept you from getting any
unwarranted hopes up. Bar
ring a major national catastro
phe that wipes out the entire
Top 25, Keefe and Co. will be
playing the entertaining NIT
game the next few weeks.
Cheer up. The No. 9 Cardi
nal women will definitely be
one of the top 16 seeds, get a
bye, and host a second-round
NCAA game in Maples, most
likely on March 16. Beyond
that . . . the picture is a little
hazy. But given past history,
I'm not too optimistic on the
team's destination.
Wait a minute'? Hey, Dave,
are you on drugs? Stanford
won the title last year, remem
ber?
I know, I know. That's part
of the problem. Things were
too perfect last season. Stan
ford, ranked No. 2 or 3 all year
and 27-1 going into the tour
ney, pulled the No. 1 seed in the
West Region, which it hap
pened to host. The Cardinal
wiped the floor with the teams
the NCAA sacrificed to them at
Maples and then went to
Knoxville, Tenn. for the Final
Four.
Meanwhile, the Cardinal
found the path to the title
cleared for them, as two top
contenders lost in their region
al. Undefeated, No. 1-ranked
Louisiana Tech unexpectedly
fell, and gracious Final Four
host school Tennessee bowed
out early as well. From there,
the championship was like
picking cherries.
But the Cardinal had an
incredibly talented team last
year. This season eerily
reminds me of two years ago,
when the team was just very,
very good. That year, Stanford
did not have the advantage of a
home regional. Still, an unde
feated conference season, 26-2
record, and No. 4 ranking
should have been enough for
the top seed in the West, right?
Sorry. You could almost hear
the NCAA snickering in the
