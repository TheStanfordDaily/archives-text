# Cal beats hoopsters; late rally falls short
## 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
The Stanford men's basketball
team spent the first half of last
night's game at California dig, dig,
digging itself a deep, comfy grave.
Then, after making sure it was
just deep enough, the Cardinal
jumped in, starting pulling some
dirt on top of itself. . . and decided
that maybe it wasn't ready to die
just yet.
Too late.

Golden Bears 75

Cardinal 70

A horrendous first-half perfor
mance killed the Cardinal last
night, and even a gutsy, hard
fought comeback in the last 15
minutes of the game couldn't save
Stanford. Down 50-30, Stanford
went on a 20-8 run and eventually
cut the Bears' lead to three with
93 seconds left, but could get no
closer.
"We just dug ourselves too big a
hole," said Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery, whose team finished
the regular season at 15-13 after
losing four of its last five games.
"I thought Cal played very, very
well, particularly in the first half."
"I'm very proud of this team,"
said coach Lou Campanelli of Cal
ifornia, which finished its season
at 13-15 (after losing five of its
last six). "They really responded
well — they showed a tremendous
amount of character."
Hut not without a little help.
Stanford had turned the ball over
only two times in the Cardinal's
90-72 win over Cal last Saturday,
but last night — especially in the
first half — Stanford couldn't
have held onto the ball even if it
had been coated with krazy glue.
Stanford had 14 turnovers in
the first half alone (23 for the
game), and even when they didn't
turn the ball over they weren't
doing much: The Cardinal hit a
measly eight of its 22 shots in the
first half.
"Cal played very, very, very
aggressively," Montgomery said.
"They made it difficult to move

the ball and hard to get the ball
cleanly in the post."
The Bears came out fired up
and swarming, due in part to a
pregame ceremony honoring the
team's five graduating seniors. All
five started, and the fire showed:
The Bears scored the first five
times down the court, built a
quick 18-9 lead and cruised to a
38-24 cushion at the half.
"The crowd really has helped
us out a lot in the last four years,"
said Roy Fisher, who led Cal with
22 points in spite of missing about
50 dunks. "We wanted to give
them a good show."
"I just love Cal's crowd," Mont
gomery said. "They give you such
a lift and make it difficult to play:
It affects everything in the gym."
By the way, Harmon Arena holds
1000 fewer fans than Maples
Pavilion, but the fans make
Maples sound like a mausoleum.
Speaking of which, the Cardi
nal would have been completely
dead at halftime if it hadn't been
for Adam Keefe, who scored 16 of
the team's 24 first-half points.
Keefe was 4-for-8 from the field
and everyone else was 4-for-14.
Yuck.
From Cal's point of view at the
half, then, the only things going
wrong with the game were (1)
Keefe going nuts; and (2) the fact
that the Bears had been called for
12 fouls and the Cardinal only
five. Lucky for the Bears, then,
that they were about to get a lot of
help (which would take care of
both problems at once) from the
ever-intelligent officiating crew.
Let's put this in simple terms:
Stanford was whistled for more
fouls in the first four minutes
after intermission than in the
entire first half. Three of those
fouls were on Keefe, giving him
four for the game. One of them
might have actually been a good
call.
And, to top it off, the Cardinal
picked up two technicals in those
four minutes: one on Montgomery
for walking away from a ref and
not saying anything (we are not
making this up) and the other on
Keefe for — are you ready for
this? — clapping his hands twice.
Yes, we're all having trouble
figuring it out.
With 16:16 left and the score

46-30, Stanford's Kenny
Ammann was whistled for a foul
on a pick. Dubious at best, but
that's not the point: In the few
seconds after the play, Keefe
walked near official Booker
Turner, clapped his hands
and picked up a T.
Hello? "I clapped twice," Keefe
said. "I don't think I was near his
face, and I didn't say a thing. I

asked him what I did, and he said
'You clapped twice.' I guess I
should have clapped once or three
times."
That probably wouldn't have
helped anyway, because only four
minutes later Keefe was out of the
game. After a scramble for the ball
at Stanford's end of the floor,

Like the rest of the Cardinal basketball team, point guard John
Patrick had a subpar game last night against Cal. Patrick finished
with only five points and one assist while picking up four personal
fouls.
Deshon Wingate found Keefe with
a pass in the paint. Keefe took a
dribble, brought the ball up and
hit Cal center Andre Reyes in the
gut with the ball. Reyes went fly
ing. Body contact? None.
Charging. Five fouls. See ya.
At least it wasn't the official
under the basket, three feet away
from the play with the best view,
who made the call. No, it had to be
the clown 30 feet away, behind the
play and screened by three of four
players. (Objectivity? Us? Come
on.)
Keefe waved goodbye to the ref
as he left the floor, started to
laugh as he got to the bench and
took a seat in the stands to watch
the last 12 minutes of the game.
Stanford was down 52-38, and 21

of those points were Keefe's. Good
night, right?
Hardly. "I didn't know how
they'd react," Keefe said, "but it
really set them off. It seemed to
trigger something."
In a big way. Stanford, sparked
by two freshmen (Brent Williams
and Jason Weaver) and two sopho
mores (Peter Dukes and Paul Gar
rett) outscored the Bears 12-6 in
the next five minutes to make it
58-50. Campanelli called a ner
vous timeout, and he probably
wondered what the heck was
going on. Jason Weaver? Five
points in five solid minutes. Peter
Dukes? Ten points and three
assists in the last eight minutes of
the game.
Stanford kept coming back. A
great inside move from Weaver
cuts the lead to six with 4:30 to go.
A three from Dukes at the top of
the key cuts it to three with 2:38

left. Then after Cal pushes the
lead back to six on a Sean Harrell
(16 points) free throw, Dukes
swings off a pick, gets the ball out
front and screams down the lane.
He goes up for the hoop, hears a
whistle, watches the ball kiss off
the glass and in. The call?
Blocking foul on Cal's Rich
Branham. Count it, go to the line
and make the free throw. Ninety
three seconds left, 71-68 Cal,
momentum completely on Stan
ford's side. . . .
And that was it. Harrell would
make two more free throws,
Fisher would add one after a Mar
cus Lollie miss, and on Stanford's
next time down the floor the Car
dinal missed three shots. The last
was a bank from Dukes that was
all but through the net when it
rolled out, and Harrell ended up
with the ball and a foul from Lol
lie. His free throw made it 75-68,

and after one last Stanford miss
the Bears ran out the clock — for
some reason, Stanford didn't even
bother to foul and put the Bears
on the line in the last 48 seconds.
"In the first half we didn't do a
lot to help ourselves," Keefe said,
"but the way we came back I think
we showed a lot of the character of
this team."

The Stanford men's basketball
team spent the first half of last
night's game at California dig, dig,
digging itself a deep, comfy grave.
Then, after making sure it was
just deep enough, the Cardinal
jumped in, starting pulling some
dirt on top of itself. . . and decided
that maybe it wasn't ready to die
just yet.
Too late.

Golden Bears 75

Cardinal 70

A horrendous first-half perfor
mance killed the Cardinal last
night, and even a gutsy, hard
fought comeback in the last 15
minutes of the game couldn't save
Stanford. Down 50-30, Stanford
went on a 20-8 run and eventually
cut the Bears' lead to three with
93 seconds left, but could get no
closer.
"We just dug ourselves too big a
hole," said Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery, whose team finished
the regular season at 15-13 after
losing four of its last five games.
"I thought Cal played very, very
well, particularly in the first half."
"I'm very proud of this team,"
said coach Lou Campanelli of Cal
ifornia, which finished its season
at 13-15 (after losing five of its
last six). "They really responded
well — they showed a tremendous
amount of character."
Hut not without a little help.
Stanford had turned the ball over
only two times in the Cardinal's
90-72 win over Cal last Saturday,
but last night — especially in the
first half — Stanford couldn't
have held onto the ball even if it
had been coated with krazy glue.
Stanford had 14 turnovers in
the first half alone (23 for the
game), and even when they didn't
turn the ball over they weren't
doing much: The Cardinal hit a
measly eight of its 22 shots in the
first half.
"Cal played very, very, very
aggressively," Montgomery said.
"They made it difficult to move

the ball and hard to get the ball
cleanly in the post."
The Bears came out fired up
and swarming, due in part to a
pregame ceremony honoring the
team's five graduating seniors. All
five started, and the fire showed:
The Bears scored the first five
times down the court, built a
quick 18-9 lead and cruised to a
38-24 cushion at the half.
"The crowd really has helped
us out a lot in the last four years,"
said Roy Fisher, who led Cal with
22 points in spite of missing about
50 dunks. "We wanted to give
them a good show."
"I just love Cal's crowd," Mont
gomery said. "They give you such
a lift and make it difficult to play:
It affects everything in the gym."
By the way, Harmon Arena holds
1000 fewer fans than Maples
Pavilion, but the fans make
Maples sound like a mausoleum.
Speaking of which, the Cardi
nal would have been completely
dead at halftime if it hadn't been
for Adam Keefe, who scored 16 of
the team's 24 first-half points.
Keefe was 4-for-8 from the field
and everyone else was 4-for-14.
Yuck.
From Cal's point of view at the
half, then, the only things going
wrong with the game were (1)
Keefe going nuts; and (2) the fact
that the Bears had been called for
12 fouls and the Cardinal only
five. Lucky for the Bears, then,
that they were about to get a lot of
help (which would take care of
both problems at once) from the
ever-intelligent officiating crew.
Let's put this in simple terms:
Stanford was whistled for more
fouls in the first four minutes
after intermission than in the
entire first half. Three of those
fouls were on Keefe, giving him
four for the game. One of them
might have actually been a good
call.
And, to top it off, the Cardinal
picked up two technicals in those
four minutes: one on Montgomery
for walking away from a ref and
not saying anything (we are not
making this up) and the other on
Keefe for — are you ready for
this? — clapping his hands twice.
Yes, we're all having trouble
figuring it out.
With 16:16 left and the score

46-30, Stanford's Kenny
Ammann was whistled for a foul
on a pick. Dubious at best, but
that's not the point: In the few
seconds after the play, Keefe
walked near official Booker
Turner, clapped his hands
and picked up a T.
Hello? "I clapped twice," Keefe
said. "I don't think I was near his
face, and I didn't say a thing. I

asked him what I did, and he said
'You clapped twice.' I guess I
should have clapped once or three
times."
That probably wouldn't have
helped anyway, because only four
minutes later Keefe was out of the
game. After a scramble for the ball
at Stanford's end of the floor,


Rajiv Chandrasekaran - Daily file
Like the rest of the Cardinal basketball team, point guard John
Patrick had a subpar game last night against Cal. Patrick finished
with only five points and one assist while picking up four personal
fouls.
Deshon Wingate found Keefe with
a pass in the paint. Keefe took a
dribble, brought the ball up and
hit Cal center Andre Reyes in the
gut with the ball. Reyes went fly
ing. Body contact? None.
Charging. Five fouls. See ya.
At least it wasn't the official
under the basket, three feet away
from the play with the best view,
who made the call. No, it had to be
the clown 30 feet away, behind the
play and screened by three of four
players. (Objectivity? Us? Come
on.)
Keefe waved goodbye to the ref
as he left the floor, started to
laugh as he got to the bench and
took a seat in the stands to watch
the last 12 minutes of the game.
Stanford was down 52-38, and 21

of those points were Keefe's. Good
night, right?
Hardly. "I didn't know how
they'd react," Keefe said, "but it
really set them off. It seemed to
trigger something."
In a big way. Stanford, sparked
by two freshmen (Brent Williams
and Jason Weaver) and two sopho
mores (Peter Dukes and Paul Gar
rett) outscored the Bears 12-6 in
the next five minutes to make it
58-50. Campanelli called a ner
vous timeout, and he probably
wondered what the heck was
going on. Jason Weaver? Five
points in five solid minutes. Peter
Dukes? Ten points and three
assists in the last eight minutes of
the game.
Stanford kept coming back. A
great inside move from Weaver
cuts the lead to six with 4:30 to go.
A three from Dukes at the top of
the key cuts it to three with 2:38

left. Then after Cal pushes the
lead back to six on a Sean Harrell
(16 points) free throw, Dukes
swings off a pick, gets the ball out
front and screams down the lane.
He goes up for the hoop, hears a
whistle, watches the ball kiss off
the glass and in. The call?
Blocking foul on Cal's Rich
Branham. Count it, go to the line
and make the free throw. Ninety
three seconds left, 71-68 Cal,
momentum completely on Stan
ford's side. . . .
And that was it. Harrell would
make two more free throws,
Fisher would add one after a Mar
cus Lollie miss, and on Stanford's
next time down the floor the Car
dinal missed three shots. The last
was a bank from Dukes that was
all but through the net when it
rolled out, and Harrell ended up
with the ball and a foul from Lol
lie. His free throw made it 75-68,

and after one last Stanford miss
the Bears ran out the clock — for
some reason, Stanford didn't even
bother to foul and put the Bears
on the line in the last 48 seconds.
"In the first half we didn't do a
lot to help ourselves," Keefe said,
"but the way we came back I think
we showed a lot of the character of
this team."

The Stanford men's basketball
team spent the first half of last
night's game at California dig, dig,
digging itself a deep, comfy grave.
Then, after making sure it was
just deep enough, the Cardinal
jumped in, starting pulling some
dirt on top of itself. . . and decided
that maybe it wasn't ready to die
just yet.
Too late.

Golden Bears 75

Cardinal 70

A horrendous first-half perfor
mance killed the Cardinal last
night, and even a gutsy, hard
fought comeback in the last 15
minutes of the game couldn't save
Stanford. Down 50-30, Stanford
went on a 20-8 run and eventually
cut the Bears' lead to three with
93 seconds left, but could get no
closer.
"We just dug ourselves too big a
hole," said Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery, whose team finished
the regular season at 15-13 after
losing four of its last five games.
"I thought Cal played very, very
well, particularly in the first half."
"I'm very proud of this team,"
said coach Lou Campanelli of Cal
ifornia, which finished its season
at 13-15 (after losing five of its
last six). "They really responded
well — they showed a tremendous
amount of character."
Hut not without a little help.
Stanford had turned the ball over
only two times in the Cardinal's
90-72 win over Cal last Saturday,
but last night — especially in the
first half — Stanford couldn't
have held onto the ball even if it
had been coated with krazy glue.
Stanford had 14 turnovers in
the first half alone (23 for the
game), and even when they didn't
turn the ball over they weren't
doing much: The Cardinal hit a
measly eight of its 22 shots in the
first half.
"Cal played very, very, very
aggressively," Montgomery said.
"They made it difficult to move

the ball and hard to get the ball
cleanly in the post."
The Bears came out fired up
and swarming, due in part to a
pregame ceremony honoring the
team's five graduating seniors. All
five started, and the fire showed:
The Bears scored the first five
times down the court, built a
quick 18-9 lead and cruised to a
38-24 cushion at the half.
"The crowd really has helped
us out a lot in the last four years,"
said Roy Fisher, who led Cal with
22 points in spite of missing about
50 dunks. "We wanted to give
them a good show."
"I just love Cal's crowd," Mont
gomery said. "They give you such
a lift and make it difficult to play:
It affects everything in the gym."
By the way, Harmon Arena holds
1000 fewer fans than Maples
Pavilion, but the fans make
Maples sound like a mausoleum.
Speaking of which, the Cardi
nal would have been completely
dead at halftime if it hadn't been
for Adam Keefe, who scored 16 of
the team's 24 first-half points.
Keefe was 4-for-8 from the field
and everyone else was 4-for-14.
Yuck.
From Cal's point of view at the
half, then, the only things going
wrong with the game were (1)
Keefe going nuts; and (2) the fact
that the Bears had been called for
12 fouls and the Cardinal only
five. Lucky for the Bears, then,
that they were about to get a lot of
help (which would take care of
both problems at once) from the
ever-intelligent officiating crew.
Let's put this in simple terms:
Stanford was whistled for more
fouls in the first four minutes
after intermission than in the
entire first half. Three of those
fouls were on Keefe, giving him
four for the game. One of them
might have actually been a good
call.
And, to top it off, the Cardinal
picked up two technicals in those
four minutes: one on Montgomery
for walking away from a ref and
not saying anything (we are not
making this up) and the other on
Keefe for — are you ready for
this? — clapping his hands twice.
Yes, we're all having trouble
figuring it out.
With 16:16 left and the score

46-30, Stanford's Kenny
Ammann was whistled for a foul
on a pick. Dubious at best, but
that's not the point: In the few
seconds after the play, Keefe
walked near official Booker
Turner, clapped his hands
and picked up a T.
Hello? "I clapped twice," Keefe
said. "I don't think I was near his
face, and I didn't say a thing. I

asked him what I did, and he said
'You clapped twice.' I guess I
should have clapped once or three
times."
That probably wouldn't have
helped anyway, because only four
minutes later Keefe was out of the
game. After a scramble for the ball
at Stanford's end of the floor,

Like the rest of the Cardinal basketball team, point guard John
Patrick had a subpar game last night against Cal. Patrick finished
with only five points and one assist while picking up four personal
fouls.
Deshon Wingate found Keefe with
a pass in the paint. Keefe took a
dribble, brought the ball up and
hit Cal center Andre Reyes in the
gut with the ball. Reyes went fly
ing. Body contact? None.
Charging. Five fouls. See ya.
At least it wasn't the official
under the basket, three feet away
from the play with the best view,
who made the call. No, it had to be
the clown 30 feet away, behind the
play and screened by three of four
players. (Objectivity? Us? Come
on.)
Keefe waved goodbye to the ref
as he left the floor, started to
laugh as he got to the bench and
took a seat in the stands to watch
the last 12 minutes of the game.
Stanford was down 52-38, and 21

of those points were Keefe's. Good
night, right?
Hardly. "I didn't know how
they'd react," Keefe said, "but it
really set them off. It seemed to
trigger something."
In a big way. Stanford, sparked
by two freshmen (Brent Williams
and Jason Weaver) and two sopho
mores (Peter Dukes and Paul Gar
rett) outscored the Bears 12-6 in
the next five minutes to make it
58-50. Campanelli called a ner
vous timeout, and he probably
wondered what the heck was
going on. Jason Weaver? Five
points in five solid minutes. Peter
Dukes? Ten points and three
assists in the last eight minutes of
the game.
Stanford kept coming back. A
great inside move from Weaver
cuts the lead to six with 4:30 to go.
A three from Dukes at the top of
the key cuts it to three with 2:38

left. Then after Cal pushes the
lead back to six on a Sean Harrell
(16 points) free throw, Dukes
swings off a pick, gets the ball out
front and screams down the lane.
He goes up for the hoop, hears a
whistle, watches the ball kiss off
the glass and in. The call?
Blocking foul on Cal's Rich
Branham. Count it, go to the line
and make the free throw. Ninety
three seconds left, 71-68 Cal,
momentum completely on Stan
ford's side. . . .
And that was it. Harrell would
make two more free throws,
Fisher would add one after a Mar
cus Lollie miss, and on Stanford's
next time down the floor the Car
dinal missed three shots. The last
was a bank from Dukes that was
all but through the net when it
rolled out, and Harrell ended up
with the ball and a foul from Lol
lie. His free throw made it 75-68,

and after one last Stanford miss
the Bears ran out the clock — for
some reason, Stanford didn't even
bother to foul and put the Bears
on the line in the last 48 seconds.
"In the first half we didn't do a
lot to help ourselves," Keefe said,
"but the way we came back I think
we showed a lot of the character of
this team."
