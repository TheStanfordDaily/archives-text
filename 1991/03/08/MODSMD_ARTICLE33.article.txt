# Swimmers seize lead at Pac-10s
## Stanford rebounds from poor dual-meet season 
### Uri Attia Editorial staff 
Fans of the Cardinal men's swimming team could
only have one reaction after Stanford burst out to an
early lead in the Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships: It's about time.
After winning the Pac-10 meet for a record-tying
nine consecutive years, the Cardinal swimmers had
performed uncharacteristically poorly in 1991. They
finished the year with a 2-6 dual meet record, win
ning only one out of five Pac-10 contests.
The swimmers were not performing up to their
usual standards and the diving team, which lost its
number-one diver at the beginning of the year in
sophomore Mark Kraus, could not pick up the slack.
To some, it may have appeared as though Stan
ford's tenure in the sun was ending. Teams like USC
and UCLA were hungry for victory after so many
years having elapsed since their last Pac-10 crowns.
There was a sense that Stanford was no longer the
invincible juggernaut that had plowed its way to
countless conference crowns. However, the team has
always found a way to raise itself up a notch when
Pac-10's come around, and this year is proving to be
no exception.

The Cardinal relied upon incredibly strong per
formances in the relay events and a victory in the 50-
yard freestyle by sophomore Erik Maurer to put the
team in first place with 309 points. USC and UCLA
finished the first of three days with 220 and 219
points, respectively, good for second and third place.
Rounding out the field were Cal (169 points), Ari
zona (167), Arizona State (156), and Washington
(70.5).
In the 200-yard freestyle relay, Stanford eclipsed
the Pac-10 meet record it set last year with a time of
1:18.96. In the 400-yard medley relay, the Card won
for the sixth time in the last seven years in 3:15.65.
Alex Kostich and Andy Lloyd took second and
third in the 500-yard freestyle with times of 4:21.18
and 4:23.66. Winning the race was Arizona's Marius
Podkoscielny, who was clocked at 4:18.68.
In the 200 individual medley, Trip Zedlitz finished
second in 1:47.66. It took a Pac-10 record 1:47.88 by
Cal's Scott Jaffe to beat him.
John DeGroot touched the wall in 20.20, losing
only to teammate Maurer's 20.10 and to Arizona
State's Troy Dalbv, who took second with a time of
20.16.
In the diving portion of the meet, held last week
in Pasadena, sophomore Brad Wightman finished in
third placf l while freshman Darrvl Sagel took sixth.
