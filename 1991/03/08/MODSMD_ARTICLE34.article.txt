# Women's basketball trounces Oregon, takes Pac-10 title
## 
### David Hirning Senior staff writer 
In a game where Tara Van-
Derveer went solo, farming her
assistant coaches out for recruit
ing trips, it turned out she could
have left her first-string home as
well. Showing NCAA tournament
form, Stanford just plain left the
Oregon Ducks at the gate in a
103-60 romp in Eugene, Ore. that
clinched the Pacific 10 Conference
title outright.
"(The title) is great for
(seniors) Trisha Stevens and
Sonja Henning, because it's their
third straight Pac-10 title," Van-
Derveer said. "We were deter
mined to win the title outright,
and we did that tonight."
Last year, the Cardinal was
forced to share the conference
crown with Washington, which
handed Stanford its only loss of
the year. Two years ago, the Car
dinal went undefeated in the con
ference.
It was the kind of game in
which Stanford (23-4, 16-1) com
pletely dominated in the first half
and took a 36-point lead into

intermission . . . and then it got
worse. The Ducks (12-15, 5-12)
could manage just 18 points in the
first half.
After a 10-0 run gave the Car
dinal a 29-10 lead, VanDerveer
pulled most of her starters
(including Sonja Henning, in a
rare early rest), and played them
only sparingly the rest of the
game. All five starters still scored
in double figures.
All-America candidate Hen
ning led the Cardinal with 19
points, and fellow senior and
roommate Trisha Stevens added
15 points and 11 rebounds to pace
the Cardinal attack. For Stevens,
her second double-double (the
first coming in the season opener
against Tennessee) was extra-spe
cial as it came before a crowd of
friends and relatives from her
nearby hometown of Philomath,
Ore.

All told, Stanford outre
bounded the Ducks 46-34 and
shot a brisk 49 percent on the
game (55 percent in the first half).
The Ducks could managed just 33
percent from the field for the
game.
The Cardinal bombed the
Ducks from long-range, hitting 9-
of-22 treys (41 percent). Fresh
man Christy Hedgpeth led the
way with 3-of-5 shooting from the
19-9 line, and Henning hit on 3-
of-6.
VanDerveer also took the
opportunity to see more of her
bench. Sophomore forward Chris
MacMurdo had 10 points and
seven rebounds, and Martha
Richards and Angela Taylor
chipped in five points each.
Another star off the bench was
Molly Goodenbour, who had not
played for two weeks because of a
stress fracture. The reserve guard
saw 13 minutes of action and had
six points and four rebounds to
show for it.
"It was a total team effort,"
VanDerveer said. "Whoever we
put in did the job."

Stanford parlayed its hot first
half shooting into a 54-18 half
time advantage, as Oregon man
aged just seven field goals in the
opening 20 minutes (shooting an
abysmal 25 percent). Stanford led
at one point by 47 before settling
for the final margin, the second
biggest win of the year for the
Cardinal.
Card notes
