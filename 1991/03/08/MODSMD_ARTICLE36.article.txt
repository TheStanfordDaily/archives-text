# Freshman Adams excels for baseball
## 
### Michelle Ghert Staff writer 
As the No.l-ranked Stanford baseball
team takes on the USC Trojans in a
three-game series at Dedeaux Field, the
Cardinal will rotate its pitching lineup
of three starters.
Nothing unusual.
What makes the lineup unusual is
the fact that along with two senior
starters, the third starter is a freshman.
Freshman Willie Adams has exceeded
his expectations for the season, pitching
his way to the third spot on the Cardinal
starting lineup behind seniors John
Reid and Scott Weiss.
"I knew I was going to throw a lot
this year," Adams said. "But I didn't
know I was going to be one of the
starters. It's really been a surprise."
The 6-foot-7 right-hander from La
Mirada, California has amassed a 4-0
record on the season with a 3.48 ERA.
Coach Mark Marquess expected
Adams to be a good collegiate pitcher at
some point in the season, but didn't
expect him to get off to such a good
start.
"It's very unusual, especially at this
level, to make the adjustment as quickly
as Willie has," Marquess said. "He's
pitched extremely well all season."
Marquess feels that Adams had sev
eral advantages coming out of high
school. Coming from Southern Califor
nia, considered a very good baseball
area, Adams experienced better compe
tition in high school than most colle
giate freshmen. Adams has also com
peted internationally as he played on
the United States Junior National Team
this past summer and was selected to
compete for the U.S. at the World Cham
pionships in Havana, Cuba.

"Playing for the U.S. has given Willie
valuable experience." Marquess said.
Still, experience alone does not earn a
starting position on the top collegiate
baseball team in the country. It is
Adams' ability to control three or four
pitches effectively that has distin
guished him as a starting-quality
pitcher. Marquess considers Adams to
be a more polished pitcher than most
freshmen.
"Most freshmen have their best pitch
being a fastball, and that's the only
pitch they can control effectively," Mar
quess said. "Willie came to us with the
ability to not only throw the fastball for
a strike, but a curveball, a split and a
changeup. That's very unusual, and
that's what has made him successful."
Despite Adams' early success, Mar
quess expects to see some improvement
this season.
"He's got great size," Marquess said.
"I think his fastball will increase in
velocity."
Adams agrees that his "great size"
gives him an advantage on the mound.
"My height puts me closer to the
plate when I let go of the ball," Adams
said. "This shortens the distance they

(the batters) have to see it. Pitching has
a lot to do with throwing downhill and
being taller, I pitch on a different plane."
Adams' height and ability were
noticed by more than just the top colle
giate teams in the country. Upon gradu
ating from high school where he
recorded a 1.56 ERA in his senior sea
son, he was drafted by the Detroit
Tigers in the June 1990 Draft. After
being one of the most highly-recruited
preps in the nation, Adams came to
Stanford by a clear-cut decision.
"I was pretty set on the (Six-) Pac,"
Adams said. "I chose Stanford because
there's no better combination of great
facilities, great coaching, top academics
and a number one baseball program."
Although Adams has undergone a
very smooth transition from high school
to collegiate baseball, he finds collegiate
baseball to be more work with a much
greater time committment.
"We practice four hours a day,"
Adams said. "It's a lot of time to spend
with the same people but I really like the
team, and we get a lot more done in
practice than we did in high school."

Freshman Willie Adams' maturity has surprised his coaches. Adams has posted a 4-0
record and a 3.48 ERA this year and will start for the Cardinal this Sunday. Stanford
will play USC in a battle for Six-Pac supremacy.
As a senior, Yee has been a part of
three NCAA championship teams
at Stanford. Last year, Yee's fore
hand smash on match point in a
No. 3 doubles match clinched the
5-2 victory over Tennessee in the
NCAA finals. "But this year it's
going to be especially difficult,"
Yee said. "We have some amazing

talent, but there are some tough
teams out there, the toughest I've
seen (since I've been here)."
In the immediate future,
though, Yee's thoughts are cen
tered on this weekend and the
Cardinal's two home matches
against Kentucky Saturday and
Miami Sunday. "They're two great
teams," Yee said. "There's going
to be some good tennis out there
this weekend. I'm looking forward
to it."

freshmen.
"Most freshmen have their best pitch
being a fastball, and that's the only
pitch they can control effectively," Mar
quess said. "Willie came to us with the
ability to not only throw the fastball for
a strike, but a curveball, a split and a
changeup. That's very unusual, and
that's what has made him successful."
Despite Adams' early success, Mar
quess expects to see some improvement
this season.
"He's got great size," Marquess said.
"I think his fastball will increase in
velocity."
Adams agrees that his "great size"
gives him an advantage on the mound.
"My height puts me closer to the
plate when I let go of the ball," Adams
said. "This shortens the distance they

(the batters) have to see it. Pitching has
a lot to do with throwing downhill and
being taller, I pitch on a different plane."
Adams' height and ability were
noticed by more than just the top colle
giate teams in the country. Upon gradu
ating from high school where he
recorded a 1.56 ERA in his senior sea
son, he was drafted by the Detroit
Tigers in the June 1990 Draft. After
being one of the most highly-recruited
preps in the nation, Adams came to
Stanford by a clear-cut decision.
"I was pretty set on the (Six-) Pac,"
Adams said. "I chose Stanford because
there's no better combination of great
facilities, great coaching, top academics
and a number one baseball program."
Although Adams has undergone a
very smooth transition from high school
to collegiate baseball, he finds collegiate
baseball to be more work with a much
greater time committment.
"We practice four hours a day,"
Adams said. "It's a lot of time to spend
with the same people but I really like the
team, and we get a lot more done in
practice than we did in high school."


Vijay Ramakrishnan — Daily
Freshman Willie Adams' maturity has surprised his coaches. Adams has posted a 4-0
record and a 3.48 ERA this year and will start for the Cardinal this Sunday. Stanford
will play USC in a battle for Six-Pac supremacy.
As a senior, Yee has been a part of
three NCAA championship teams
at Stanford. Last year, Yee's fore
hand smash on match point in a
No. 3 doubles match clinched the
5-2 victory over Tennessee in the
NCAA finals. "But this year it's
going to be especially difficult,"
Yee said. "We have some amazing

talent, but there are some tough
teams out there, the toughest I've
seen (since I've been here)."
In the immediate future,
though, Yee's thoughts are cen
tered on this weekend and the
Cardinal's two home matches
against Kentucky Saturday and
Miami Sunday. "They're two great
teams," Yee said. "There's going
to be some good tennis out there
this weekend. I'm looking forward
to it."
