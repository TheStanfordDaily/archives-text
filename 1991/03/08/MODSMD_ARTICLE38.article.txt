# Swimmers prepare for NCAA champs
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
After a No. 1 national rank
ing, a 10-0 dual-meet season,
and a dominating victory at the
Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships, it would seem the
Stanford women's swim team
is ready for the NCAA champi
onships. But after falling by a
mere 9% points to Texas at last
year's nationals, one can
understand why the Cardinal
is trying to prepare even more.
In an effort to load the
lineup with a bit more point
scoring potential, several Car
dinal swimmers will hit the
water at deGuerre Pool for the
Stanford Invitational tomor
row at noon.
A team is allowed to take 18
swimmers to the NCAA meet.
Since divers are only counted
as half a swimmer, the Cardi
nal will take a total of 17 swim
mers and two divers to Indi
anapolis for the meet, which
runs March 21-23. Stanford
already has a total of 18 swim
mers qualified, but that won't
stop a few more swimmers
from attempting to join them.
NCAA rules also state that a
swimmer can compete in up to
three events at NCAAs, so a
couple Cardinal women who
have already qualified in one or
two events will attempt to add
another race to their lineup by
coming under the NCAA quali
fying standards tomorrow.
While the lineup is pretty
sketchy, freshmen Mary
Edwards, Mary Kelsey and
Heather Marks plan to try to
qualify. Edwards just returned
to action at Pac-lOs last week
end after being hampered with
tendinitis and bursitis in both
shoulders all year.
In her first race of the sea
son, she swam a 23.47 in the
50-yard freestyle, 0.10 seconds
shy of the NCAA standard.
Later in the meet she swam a
23.44 to again just miss, and
will swim either the 50
freestyle, the 100 freestyle or
both in an effort to hit the

NCAA qualifying standard.
Kelsey will probably swim a
200 freestyle tomorrow. She is
coming off a good Pac-10 meet
where she recorded lifetime
best times. Marks also missed
qualifying at the Pac-10 meet
and will probably swim the 50
or 100 freestyle.
Sophomore Lori Heisick,
who has won Pac-10 titles in
both breaßtstrokes in each of
her two years on the Farm, will
also swim a 50 freestyle in an
effort to have a third event for
NCAAs. Sophomore Anne
Mahoney, the 1991 Pac-10 run
ner-up in the 100 backstroke,
will likely try to add the 50
freestyle, the 200 backstroke or
both to the 100 backstroke on
her NCAA list.
Junior Dede Trimble, who
has qualified in both the 100
and 200 backstrokes, and
junior J.T. Toton, who has
qualified in both breaststrokes,
will both try to achieve an
NCAA qualifying time in the
200 individual medley. Fresh
man Summer Sanders, a dou
ble winner at Pac-lOs, is also
thinking about trying to get a
qualifying time in the 50
freestyle for the U.S. Long
Course Nationals, which take
place in four weeks.
California will probably also
send a contingent of swimmers
to the Invitational to look for
qualifying times. The third
ranked Bears are trying to
become the first-ever non-
Stanford, Texas or Florida
team to finish in the top three
at the NCAA championships.
