# Yee leads Card against Kentucky, Miami
## 
### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
When senior Jason Yee came to
Stanford, tennis stardom was the
furthest thing from his mind. Oh,
Yee could hit the ball over the net,
all right. He was ranked 33rd in
the country before entering Stan
ford. But even Yee admits he was a
little wary on some of the "finer
points" of the game.
"Before I came (to Stanford), I
hadn't really had any formal
coaching or training on the funda
mentals," Yee said. "I wasn't
expecting that much my first few
years. I knew I was at a great uni
versity with one of the best tennis
programs in the country. I just
wanted to see what I could do to
improve."
What a difference four years
can make. Yee went from not play
ing his freshman year (at all) to
become one of Stanford's four Ail-
Americans last season, his junior
year, and to win a starting spot on
the Cardinal squad in both singles
and doubles this season.
Finding out how much Yee has
improved is not difficult. Just ask
some of his teammates. "I went
through the juniors with Jason,"
senior Glenn Solomon said. "He
was always a great athlete, even
back then, but he was missing out
on some of the finer points of the
game. Things sure have changed.
"Jason is definitely the most
improved player in college tennis.
I don't think anyone would even
doubt that. It's just a credit to his
great heart and the coaching here
at Stanford."
"Jason is a classic example of a
guy who went from near the bot
tom of the ladder his freshman
year to win a top spot in both sin
gles and doubles his senior sea
son," senior Dan Turbow added.
"A player of lesser character
wouldn't have been able to do
that, especially on a team with
this much talent. He's a class act
all the way."
Yee, who is majoring in
mechanical engineering (not a
typo, he's one of those rare mam
mals, an athlete-ME), has won
special praise for his doubles play.
Yee's quick hands and speed have
made him a natural in doubles.
Last season, Yee teamed with
junior Alex O'Brien to advance to
the quarterfinals of the NCAA
doubles championships, earning

him All-America honors. Earlier
in the season, Yee and O'Brien
won the Pacific 10 Conference
doubles title.
This season, Yee and O'Brien
began the year ranked No. 2 in the
country, behind the Stanford duo
of Jonathan Stark and Jared
Palmer, in the Volvo Tennis/Colle
giate Rankings. Presently, Yee and
O'Brien are ranked sixth in the
Volvo standings and will compete
for one of the top two spots in the
doubles lineup this year. Yee has
played No. 4 singles in the recent
dual matches.
"Jason's an absolutely unbe
lievable doubles player," partner
O'Brien said. "He makes it very
easy for me. If I hit a good return
or a good shot, he's all over the
net. He finishes off points and
closes off the net as well as any
one.
"He's got amazingly quick
hands, no doubt about it. That's
one of the reasons why he's
one of the top doubles players in
the country," coach Dick Gould
added.
But Yee is not flawless. He still
needs to work on a few areas of his
game, especially his consistency.

"I can play really well at times,
but I have some off days when
nothing seems to go right," Yee
said. "I need to work on being
more aggressive but also on cut
ting down on the errors. If I can
do that, I think I can move to
another level."
According to Gould, "moving to
another level" may not be that dif
ficult for Yee, especially consider
ing his work ethic and attitude.
"Jason always gives it his best,"
Gould said. "No matter how he
feels that day, you know Jason's
going to give you his best compet
itive effort. He never stays down
for long, and that's an attitude

built for success. It sets a nice
example for the younger players
on the team."
Yee is undecided about his
future. He has an extra year of eli
gibility and is seriously consider
ing staying on the Farm for an
another year. "If I ever play pro
fessional tennis, it would only be
for fun. The traveling and the
experience is something I would
really enjoy," Yee said.
Yee, who Gould calls a "team
player all the way," was apprehen
sive about guaranteeing another
team NCAA championship in May.

After playing only sparingly during his freshman year, senior Jason Yee has emerged as one of the Car
dinal's top players at both singles and doubles.
With high school well behind
him, Adams is looking towards a
bright future in collegiate ball.
"I expect him to be one of the
top pitchers not only on our team,

but in the conference and in the
country if he progresses," Mar
quess said.
By earning a starting spot on
the mound, Adams is on his way
to realizing these expectations.
"To be a starter at this level as
a freshman says a lot about your
ability," Marquess said. "Willie
has a tremendous amount."

By earning a starting spot on
the mound, Adams is on his way
to realizing these expectations.
"To be a starter at this level as
a freshman says a lot about your
ability," Marquess said. "Willie
has a tremendous amount."
When senior Jason Yee came to
Stanford, tennis stardom was the
furthest thing from his mind. Oh,
Yee could hit the ball over the net,
all right. He was ranked 33rd in
the country before entering Stan
ford. But even Yee admits he was a
little wary on some of the "finer
points" of the game.
"Before I came (to Stanford), I
hadn't really had any formal
coaching or training on the funda
mentals," Yee said. "I wasn't
expecting that much my first few
years. I knew I was at a great uni
versity with one of the best tennis
programs in the country. I just
wanted to see what I could do to
improve."
What a difference four years
can make. Yee went from not play
ing his freshman year (at all) to
become one of Stanford's four Ail-
Americans last season, his junior
year, and to win a starting spot on
the Cardinal squad in both singles
and doubles this season.
Finding out how much Yee has
improved is not difficult. Just ask
some of his teammates. "I went
through the juniors with Jason,"
senior Glenn Solomon said. "He
was always a great athlete, even
back then, but he was missing out
on some of the finer points of the
game. Things sure have changed.
"Jason is definitely the most
improved player in college tennis.
I don't think anyone would even
doubt that. It's just a credit to his
great heart and the coaching here
at Stanford."
"Jason is a classic example of a
guy who went from near the bot
tom of the ladder his freshman
year to win a top spot in both sin
gles and doubles his senior sea
son," senior Dan Turbow added.
"A player of lesser character
wouldn't have been able to do
that, especially on a team with
this much talent. He's a class act
all the way."
Yee, who is majoring in
mechanical engineering (not a
typo, he's one of those rare mam
mals, an athlete-ME), has won
special praise for his doubles play.
Yee's quick hands and speed have
made him a natural in doubles.
Last season, Yee teamed with
junior Alex O'Brien to advance to
the quarterfinals of the NCAA
doubles championships, earning

him All-America honors. Earlier
in the season, Yee and O'Brien
won the Pacific 10 Conference
doubles title.
This season, Yee and O'Brien
began the year ranked No. 2 in the
country, behind the Stanford duo
of Jonathan Stark and Jared
Palmer, in the Volvo Tennis/Colle
giate Rankings. Presently, Yee and
O'Brien are ranked sixth in the
Volvo standings and will compete
for one of the top two spots in the
doubles lineup this year. Yee has
played No. 4 singles in the recent
dual matches.
"Jason's an absolutely unbe
lievable doubles player," partner
O'Brien said. "He makes it very
easy for me. If I hit a good return
or a good shot, he's all over the
net. He finishes off points and
closes off the net as well as any
one.
"He's got amazingly quick
hands, no doubt about it. That's
one of the reasons why he's
one of the top doubles players in
the country," coach Dick Gould
added.
But Yee is not flawless. He still
needs to work on a few areas of his
game, especially his consistency.

"I can play really well at times,
but I have some off days when
nothing seems to go right," Yee
said. "I need to work on being
more aggressive but also on cut
ting down on the errors. If I can
do that, I think I can move to
another level."
According to Gould, "moving to
another level" may not be that dif
ficult for Yee, especially consider
ing his work ethic and attitude.
"Jason always gives it his best,"
Gould said. "No matter how he
feels that day, you know Jason's
going to give you his best compet
itive effort. He never stays down
for long, and that's an attitude

built for success. It sets a nice
example for the younger players
on the team."
Yee is undecided about his
future. He has an extra year of eli
gibility and is seriously consider
ing staying on the Farm for an
another year. "If I ever play pro
fessional tennis, it would only be
for fun. The traveling and the
experience is something I would
really enjoy," Yee said.
Yee, who Gould calls a "team
player all the way," was apprehen
sive about guaranteeing another
team NCAA championship in May.

After playing only sparingly during his freshman year, senior Jason Yee has emerged as one of the Car
dinal's top players at both singles and doubles.
With high school well behind
him, Adams is looking towards a
bright future in collegiate ball.
"I expect him to be one of the
top pitchers not only on our team,

but in the conference and in the
country if he progresses," Mar
quess said.
By earning a starting spot on
the mound, Adams is on his way
to realizing these expectations.
"To be a starter at this level as
