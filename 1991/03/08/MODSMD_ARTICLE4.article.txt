# Kennedy strikes back at audit agency charge
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
University President Donald Kennedy
fired back yesterday at the federal auditor
who earlier this week accused Stanford of
obstructing his agency's access to key indi
rect-cost documents.
"As a former head of a federal regulatory
agency, I think I know what is reasonable
and fair behavior on the part of the govern
ment toward a regulated entity. This is nei
ther reasonable nor fair," Kennedy said in a
statement.
In a March 4 letter to Kennedy, Joseph
Riden, the local branch manager of the
Defense Contract Audit Agency, threatened
to seek criminal charges against University
officials if Stanford did not provide freer
access to documents relevant to its audit of
Stanford's indirect costs of research.
"Should you not rectify the impediments

[the agency] is experiencing and take action
to assure they do not reoccur, I plan to
bring this matter to the attention of the
Department of Justice," Riden wrote.
"There have been extensive delays in our
receiving data."
The agency has stepped up its audit
efforts at Stanford at the request of the
Office of Naval Research and the House
Subcommittee on Oversight and Investiga
tions, both of which are among the govern
ment agencies probing Stanford's indirect
cost practices.
In his statement, Kennedy notes that
Riden threatened Stanford with criminal
charges "only one business day" after he
had issued a complaint about the delays in
receiving documents.
In a Feb. 28 letter to Kennedy, Riden
cites several cases where he believes Stan-
ford's response to his agency's
requests was unacceptable.
University Counsel Debra
Zumwalt responded to Riden's
concerns in a March 4 letter,
offering "to identify such problem
areas and resolve them in a posi
tive manner." Riden apparently
had not received Zumwalt's letter
when he threatened criminal
charges.
In his statement, Kennedy also
complains that Riden's letter was
distributed to reporters before it
was delivered to the University.
In a letter sent to Riden yester
day, Zumwalt writes that "by
avoiding sensationalism and mak
ing a mutual commitment to
cooperation and professionalism,
we can satisfy the needs of [the
Defense Contract Audit Agency]
during a period which will neces
sarily be stressful for all con
cerned."
Kennedy served as the com
missioner of the Food and Drug
Administration from 1977 to
1979.
