# Men's Tennis vs. Kentucky, Miami
## 
### 
SATURDAY - 1 p.m. at Stanford Tennis Stadium against 14th-ranked
Kentucky.
SUNDAY _ 1 p.m. at Stanford Tennis Stadium against 12th-ranked Miami.
RECORDS - Stanford (6-1, ranked No 1 in the country)
NOTES - Stanford beat Miami 5-2 in the National Team Indoors Feb 22,
and the Hurricanes are looking for revenge. The men's team will play
concurrently with the top-ranked women in both dual matches this week
end. The women's team will compete against Arizona Saturday and
Florida (yes, the same team that broke the Cardinal women's 76-match
winning streak with a 6-0 pasting last week) Sunday. Stanford students
can watch all the action for two dollars.
