# Netters face Florida, ASU, Arizona

"We were really pleased we could
come back," Sandra Birch said after
the Cardinal rediscovered its winning
ways over the weekend. "If you lose,
you can get so dejected that you don't
play well ... We used it as motiva
tion. "
Stanford coach Frank Brennan
echoed a similar sentiment. "I think
that was wonderful," he said. "We
proved we could come back. And, of
course, the only way you can come
back is to lose one."
What of the loss, though, coach?
Didn't it take you off guard? "I don't
know if shocked is the right word. We
were surprised," Brennan said. Then
he paused for a moment. "I guess we
were shocked."
That was then, April 1988, the last
time the Stanford women's tennis
team suffered the agony of defeat.
UCLA performed the deed back when
the Cardinal was only the two-time

defending NCAA champion.
It only took 24 hours for Stanford
to come back, rout USC 5-1, and start
a winning streak that culminated with
a third consecutive national title. In
the NCAA final that year, the Cardinal
played without its top player, Tami
Whitlinger, and with an injured Eleni
Rossides at fifth singles.
Somehow, though, Stanford
upended the heavily favored, No. 1-
ranked, 29-0 Gators on a sunny Sun

day in Los Angeles in one of the
biggest upsets in the annals of the
sport.
Sixty wins in a row would follow
over the course of two-plus seasons.
The third-longest winning streak in
collegiate athletics brought two more
national crowns to the Ralph
Rodriguez Clubhouse. And then it was
over.
A what-the-hell-is-going-on
here 5-4 win over Wisconsin a
week ago Thursday quickly peeled
away the Stanford-is-unbeatable
veneer. Last Saturday against
Georgia (of whom Brennan said
"each one of them would cut off
their pinky to beat us"), the Car
dinal was again pushed to 5-4.
The National Team Indoors
were obviously abuzz with the
goings on. Junior Debbie Graham
recalled the reaction during the
match with the Badgers: "When
we were losing to Wisconsin,
every single team was watching . .
.and they were all beaming.
"Bill Zaima (the UCLA coach),
who you never see smile, was
smiling," she remembered. For
years, all of college tennis has
been trying to get Stanford, or as
Graham succintly put it, "Every
one hated us."
And, "they" weren't the only
ones to sense the Cardinal was
vincible. "We" began to think so as
well. Discussing the Wisconsin
match, Brennan said, "Not only
did it get other people maybe
thinking the mystique was evapo
rating, it got our team thinking,
'Where's Meredith McGrath?
Where's Lisa Green.' "
Suddenly, the Stanford swag

ger that had been so much a part
of The Streak was gone. "My feel
ing is we were scared. We were not
confident we were going to win at
every position," Brennan said.
Graham echoed a similar senti
ment. She noted the team had
gotten used to clinching every
match in singles. When that
didn't happen against Wisconsin
and Georgia, the Stanford players
began to feel tight. "People
weren't focusing in on their
match," she said. "They were
focusing too much on other
matches."
Very well then, one can better
understand how it happened but
they still leaves the question of
how the Cardinal is handling its
first defeat since the president
signed his letters "Ronald Rea
gan" and the United States hadn't
won a war since WW 11.
The answer seems to be: about
as well as can be expected. A lot of
communication has been going on
between players and coaches and
among the players themselves
ever since the defeat and subse
quent trip home.
Brennan and Lele Forood, the
team's assistant coach, have
focused on not making a big deal
out of the defeat and trying to
help individual players under
stood what they need to do better
on the court. The result has been
a lack of back-biting and blame
laying and a new, rejuvenated

desire to get back to the top.
"I thought the girls looked a lit
tle different" in practice this
week, Brennan said. "They looked
a little spunkier. I think you have
to have that."
Said Graham: "Everyone is a
lot more fired up, a lot more
psyched to play. We're ready to
show everybody who should be
No. 1."
Graham and Brennan both
spoke of how the defeat removed
the pressure The Streak brought
upon the team and said they were
not looking back, but ahead.
Even sophomore Heather Wil
lens, who could have let the emo
tional baggage of dropping all four
matches weigh her down, put a
positive spin on things. "We're out
for revenge," she said of facing
Florida Sunday, exactly one week
after the debacle.
"The pressure is off us and on
them," Willens said.
Brennan noted that the loss, as
resounding and crushing as it
may have been, should not be
blown completely out of propor
tion. True, Stanford may no
longer step on the court certain of
victory. But that's normal, the
last few years of perfection have
been the aberration.
In other words, it's the end of
the women's tennis world as
we've grown to know it and the
Cardinal, for its own part, feels
fine.
