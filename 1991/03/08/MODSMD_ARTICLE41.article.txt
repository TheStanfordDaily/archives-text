"We were really pleased we could
come back," Sandra Birch said after
the Cardinal rediscovered its winning
ways over the weekend. "If you lose,
you can get so dejected that you don't
play well ... We used it as motiva
tion. "
Stanford coach Frank Brennan
echoed a similar sentiment. "I think
that was wonderful," he said. "We
proved we could come back. And, of
course, the only way you can come
back is to lose one."
What of the loss, though, coach?
Didn't it take you off guard? "I don't
know if shocked is the right word. We
were surprised," Brennan said. Then
he paused for a moment. "I guess we
were shocked."
That was then, April 1988, the last
time the Stanford women's tennis
team suffered the agony of defeat.
UCLA performed the deed back when
the Cardinal was only the two-time

defending NCAA champion.
It only took 24 hours for Stanford
to come back, rout USC 5-1, and start
a winning streak that culminated with
a third consecutive national title. In
the NCAA final that year, the Cardinal
played without its top player, Tami
Whitlinger, and with an injured Eleni
Rossides at fifth singles.
Somehow, though, Stanford
upended the heavily favored, No. 1-
ranked, 29-0 Gators on a sunny Sun

day in Los Angeles in one of the
biggest upsets in the annals of the
sport.
Sixty wins in a row would follow
over the course of two-plus seasons.
The third-longest winning streak in
collegiate athletics brought two more
national crowns to the Ralph
Rodriguez Clubhouse. And then it was
over.
