# Gymnasts battle top teams
## No. 1 Penn State will be at UCLA meet 
### Noah Blake Staff writer 
Whoever made up the NCAA Division I
men's gymnastics schedule should get a
raise. Why? Because this Saturday night, in
the den of the UCLA Bruins, four of the top
six teams in the country will meet in a com
petition that will determine the frontrun
ner for this year's national championship.
Stanford could very well emerge as that
top squad. The Cardinal enters this battle
royal coming off of the highest recorded
team score in the country this year
(286.80), a score that the team garnered a
week ago in thrashing Michigan and San
Jose State at Maples Pavilion.
Add to this score the expected improve
ment from senior Tim Wang and junior Tim
Ryan, both of whom are more fully recov
ered from injuries which hampered their
performances last week, and the Cardinal
looks very tough to beat on paper. As coach
Sadao Hamada puts it,"I am confident that
if the guys perform up to their potential,
they will not lose."
Unlike in previous meets, the Stanford
team may very well need to realize this

potential in order to defeat the squads that
it will face. One of these teams is host
UCLA, who last week scored 284.00, the
second-highest score recorded this year.
The Bruins have traditionally been the
Cardinal's nemesis in the Pac-10 and have
shown marked improvement since a loss
two weeks ago to Arizona State, whom the
Cardinal has defeated twice.
Oklahoma will enter the meet ranked
second in the nation, and because Hamada
knows so little about the Sooners, he is con
cerned about how well they could perform.
Penn State holds the number-one spot in
the nation, and thus must be respected
despite the loss they suffered two weeks ago
at the hands of Ohio State, whom Stanford
beat a week earlier.
One couldn't ask for a more significant
competition. In six weeks, at the NCAA
championships, these four teams will most
likely be battling it out once again, this time
with the national title at stake. Whichever
team wins tomorrow night will have the
upper hand going into the NCAAs and will,
for at least six weeks, be able to claim that
they're the best in the country. And no one
will be able to disagree.
