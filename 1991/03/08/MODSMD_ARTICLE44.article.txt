# Spikers look to end slide

"All we can do from here is take it one
game at a time," said men's volleyball
coach Ruben Nieves.
That sounds like a coach whose team
is suffering through a painful, extended
losing streak.
Check that. That is a coach whose
team is suffering through a painful,
extended losing streak.
In just a five-week span, Stanford has
dropped six consecutive Western Inter
collegiate Volleyball Association matches
and has fallen from first to fourth place
in the Wilson division standings.
Tomorrow night the Cardinal will try
to end that six-match drought when they
face division rival Long Beach State at 6
p.m. in Maples Pavilion. Unfortunately,
the 49ers enter the match with the
nation's highest win total and a No. 2
ranking.
Pending the results of Thursday's
match against Ball State, Long Beach
stands at 17-2 overall. They are 7-1 in
WIVA play and hot on the heels of top
ranked, unbeaten USC in the Wilson
division race.
Nieves and his ninth-ranked Cardinal
can, though, look to the clubs' contest
earlier this season for a measure of con
fidence. Their mid-February match in

Long Beach was a five-game classic, as
Stanford played some of its best volley
ball of the year.
Outside hitters Dave Goss and Dun
can Blackman set Cardinal team highs
with 36 kills in that match, but Long
Beach's one-man attacking machine
Brent Milliard had led the match with
41.
Tomorrow Stanford will have to con
tain Hilliard and Ail-American middle
blocker Brett Winslow, whose blocking
was the key to the decisive fifth game in
Long Beach's earlier victory. Hilliard
enters the match averaging 7.4 kills per
game for a .357 hitting percentage, while
Winslow is hitting .433 with 4.5 kills and
1.4 blocks per game.
Stanford is currently in a four-way
battle for the tournament's last three
spots. Either Pepperdine (3-5) or UC
Santa Barbara (4-6) will finish third in
the DeGroot division and grab an auto
matic berth, and the Cardinal have
already fallen to both schools and would
lose a head-to-head tie-breaker for a wild
card spot.
So it looks as if Stanford will have to
beat out 2-4 Hawaii for the final tourna
ment berth. The Cardinal does hold the
tie-breaker edge over the Rainbows, hav
ing knocked them off twice at Burnham
Pavilion early in the season.
