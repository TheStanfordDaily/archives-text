# Oliver's 'team approach' leads track
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Staff writer 
Track is a very individual sport. You
warm up, race, cool down and go home,
right? Not for Rhonda Oliver. To her
track is a team sport.
The sophomore sprinter would
rather praise her teammates than talk
about herself.
"I was really proud. In the past cou
ple of weeks everybody's really shined.
We had a lot of people [set personal
records]. I think that's the best part
about it," Oliver said.
Although Oliver does not like to
praise herself, her coaches and team
mates do not hesitate to laud her contri
butions. "She's very competitive â€” shy
and friendly, but very aggressive," coach
Brooks Johnson said. "Off the track
she's very unassuming, very caring.
That's a good combination."
According to teammate Dana Weeks,
what stands out about Oliver is not only
her speed butalso her attitude and team
approach.
"I really look up to her because she
works so hard at practice. She's very
supportive and doesn't just think about
herself. She thinks about everyone else
on the team.
"She has the kind of kindness that
makes you want to be her friend. You
feel compelled to go up and meet her.
She seems like a good character despite
the fact that she runs so fast," Weeks

said. "A lot of good runners you're
intimidated by."
Oliver's teammates are not the only
people who find her so approachable. In
the middle of an interview, a friend of
hers who was on the verge of tears came
over to her.
Oliver stopped the interview for a few
minutes to give her friend a big hug and
console her after listening to her
dilemma. She gave her some advice and
promised to be with her in a few min
utes. After the interview Oliver went
over to comfort her friend some more.
Weeks summed up the attitude that
many of Oliver's friends have of her.
"She's a dude," Weeks said.
The "dude" started running as a
youth in Texas, partly to follow in her
brother's footsteps.
"My brother played football and ran
track, and we'd always go see him per
form. When I got into middle school I
knew I wanted to be in sports because I
kind of wanted to be like him. I didn't
intentionally concentrate on track. I
just happened to be good at it,"the
Tyler, Texas native said.
By eighth grade she was so good that
she was beating high school runners.
She decided then to continue track
through high school. As a senior, she
won the 200 meters at the Texas State
Championships.
After high school Oliver found that
life at Stanford required a big adjust
ment.

"I didn't really know anyone out here
except the coaches and people on the
team. I have no relatives near here.
Learning to live on your own, making
new friends, concentrating on classes
are big adjustments. Later on, it's easier
to focus on track, once you get adjusted
to the environment," Oliver said.
Her renewed focus has paid dividends
already this year. A few weeks ago Oliver
provisionally qualified for the NCAA
Indoor Championships. Sometimes, not
enough athletes run under the stiff
NCAA automatic qualification time to
make a full field. If this occurs, runners
who make the provisional mark may be
invited to compete in the NCAA Cham
pionships.
Although she did not make the final
cut, Oliver is pleased with her progress
on the track. She hopes to compete after
college, possibly in the Olympics.
"If I don't try it out I'll still have a
part of me that will wonder if maybe I
could have (made it)," Oliver said.
After track, Oliver hopes to pursue a
career in business or politics. She even
tually wants a family and plans to
travel, since she's never been outside
the United States. #
But for now, Oliver is concentrating
on track, specifically on the home meet
this weekend against California, San
Francisco State and Cal State-Hayward.
She wants to get closer to her goal of
qualifying for the NCAA Outdoor
Championships.
