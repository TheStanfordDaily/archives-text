# Freshman Kanuka leads women's gym at Hobee's Invitational
## 
### Brandi Shipp Staff writer 
They call her Nuke. Her petite, 5-foot-1 stature
seems harmless, but they still call her Nuke. Why?
Because her explosive performances have been burn
ing trails all season.
Although only a freshman, Kerri Kanuka has
been one of the top competitors for the Stanford
women's gymnastics team throughout the season.
With the end of the season nowhere in sight, she has
already smashed two Stanford records, earning a 9.8
on floor and a 9.7 on the uneven bars.
This spectacular gymnast hails from Regina,
Saskatchewan, in Canada. Kanuka did not enter the
gymnastics world until she was more than 6 years
old, when her dad saw her do a round-off and decided
to enroll her in a class. It certainly did not take long.
She "flipped over it"from the start.
By the tender age of 7, Kanuka was competing
against other gymnasts. First it was city competi
tions. Then province competitions. Then into West
ern Canada competitions. She started competing in
the Canadian Nationals at the age of 10.
When she was 14, she reached a turning point in
her life. After a very disheartening 11th place at the
Canadian Nationals in 1986, she seriously ques
tioned her future in gymnastics.

"I was really confused. I wasn't happy with the
way that I had done, and I knew that I could do much
better," Kanuka said. "I decided that I would either
quit or focus all of my attention [to gymnastics] and
become much, much better."
This confusion lead to an important decision in
J.S.'s career. At the young age of 14, she packed her
bags and left home, heading for Ontario. It was
there that she found what she wanted, under the
direction of her new coach, Leonid Grakovsky.
Finally, Kanuka had found the intensity that she
had been looking for. "It was an incredible growing
experience; the adjustment was difficult, but I found
myself so into the gymnastics and wanting to learn
more."
This move, though hard for her and her family,
proved to be a good decision. When she moved, her
goal had been to make the national team. She did
that in 1987, less than a year later. Since then,
Kanuka's gymnastics career has been overwhelm
ingly impressive. She has been a member of the
Canadian National Team more than three times,
including 1989 and 1990; she competed for Canada
at the world Championships in Stuttgart, West Ger
many, where the team placed sixth; she competed, in
1990, in both the Romanian and Bulgarian Invita
tionals.
It was at the Romanian Invitational in April of
1990 that Kanuka had the second major turning

point in her career. While taking off for a double
back, she tore her achilles tendon. "It was disas
trous," Kanuka said.
After the surgery, Kanuka was out of gymnastics
for a total of three months, including six weeks in a
cast. Even this serious injury did not break her
spirit or her desire for success. "I was still in the
gym everyday," Kanuka said. "I worked my upper
body strength and did bars with a cast on."
To add to the complex situation, Kanuka had
signed to come to Stanford right before leaving for
Romania. "I was so scared to tell Breck [Greenwood,
Stanford coach] about the injury. I was scared that
he would not want me to come anymore, but he was
scared that I had decided it was time to retire from
gymnastics."
Luckily for Stanford gymnastics fans, this didn't
happen. Greenwood still wanted Kanuka to come in
the fall, and she was ready to come. Choosing Stan

ford over other gymnastics powerhouses like Ari
zona State and Penn State, Kanuka arrived with new
"I had new motivation after I tore my Achilles; I
had an urge to be competitive again.' Her decision
to come to Stanford was inspired, primarily , because
of the perfect balance between gymnastics and aca
demics. "I'm not going to be doing gymnastics for
ever, so my schooling is a top priority, too," Kanuka
said. .
Her move into the world of collegiate gymnastics
forced her to retire from international competitions.
"It was too difficult to balance college gymnastics
with international gymnastics," Kanuka said,
don't have seven hours a day to devote to being in
the gym, which is what I would need." She competed
in her last international competition last December.
And the rest is history. She feels that her decision
to come to the Farm was one of her best. "I really
love the team. We get along really well, we've got a
lot of energy, and it's a lot of fun. We have the ability
to excel to great lengths," Kanuka said. "The facili
ties are excellent, too. It's a great environment to
train in."
Despite her retirement from international gym
nastics, Kanuka still sets her goals high. "Right now,
my goal is to go to Nationals, either on my own or as
a team."
Chances are, she'll do it.

myself so into the gymnastics and wanting to learn
more."
This move, though hard for her and her family,
proved to be a good decision. When she moved, her
goal had been to make the national team. She did
that in 1987, less than a year later. Since then,
Kanuka's gymnastics career has been overwhelm
ingly impressive. She has been a member of the
Canadian National Team more than three times,
including 1989 and 1990; she competed for Canada
at the world Championships in Stuttgart, West Ger
many, where the team placed sixth; she competed, in
1990, in both the Romanian and Bulgarian Invita
tionals.
It was at the Romanian Invitational in April of
1990 that Kanuka had the second major turning

point in her career. While taking off for a double
back, she tore her achilles tendon. "It was disas
trous," Kanuka said.
After the surgery, Kanuka was out of gymnastics
for a total of three months, including six weeks in a
cast. Even this serious injury did not break her
spirit or her desire for success. "I was still in the
gym everyday," Kanuka said. "I worked my upper
body strength and did bars with a cast on."
To add to the complex situation, Kanuka had
signed to come to Stanford right before leaving for
Romania. "I was so scared to tell Breck [Greenwood,
Stanford coach] about the injury. I was scared that
he would not want me to come anymore, but he was
scared that I had decided it was time to retire from
gymnastics."
Luckily for Stanford gymnastics fans, this didn't
happen. Greenwood still wanted Kanuka to come in
the fall, and she was ready to come. Choosing Stan

ford over other gymnastics powerhouses like Ari
zona State and Penn State, Kanuka arrived with new
"I had new motivation after I tore my Achilles; I
had an urge to be competitive again.' Her decision
to come to Stanford was inspired, primarily , because
of the perfect balance between gymnastics and aca
demics. "I'm not going to be doing gymnastics for
ever, so my schooling is a top priority, too," Kanuka
said. .
Her move into the world of collegiate gymnastics
forced her to retire from international competitions.
"It was too difficult to balance college gymnastics
with international gymnastics," Kanuka said,
don't have seven hours a day to devote to being in
the gym, which is what I would need." She competed
in her last international competition last December.
And the rest is history. She feels that her decision
to come to the Farm was one of her best. "I really
love the team. We get along really well, we've got a
lot of energy, and it's a lot of fun. We have the ability
to excel to great lengths," Kanuka said. "The facili
ties are excellent, too. It's a great environment to
train in."
Despite her retirement from international gym
nastics, Kanuka still sets her goals high. "Right now,
my goal is to go to Nationals, either on my own or as
a team."
Chances are, she'll do it.
