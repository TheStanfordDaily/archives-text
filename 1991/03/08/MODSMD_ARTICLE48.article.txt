# Panel discusses media and war
## Journalists criticize government, networks for coverage 
### Matt McNeil Staff writer 
Several respected journalists spoke about the
powers and responsibilities of the U.S. media to an
audience of at least 60 in Cubberley Auditorium last
night.
The discussion, titled "The Media: The American
Agenda," focused mainly on the role of the media
during the Persian Gulf war.
Rollin Post, a political reporter at San Francisco
television station KRON, led off the discussion by
saying television has more impact than any other
media because of its immediacy and visual "shock
value."
He reinforced his point with several historical
television images which helped shape public opinion,
including one picture of U.S. Marines burning a Viet
namese village.
Post cautioned, however, that the dramatic and
immediate impact of television has dangers as well
because it demands no critical thinking. This is espe
cially dangerous, he said, because for 60-65 percent
of Americans, television is their only source of news.
Phyllis Crockett, a White House correspondent
for National Public Radio, discussed the restricted

access and "spoon-feeding" the military imposed on
the military during the Gulf war.
She criticized the implementation of press pools
and "briefing-room reporting," especially since the
government "has a history of not telling us the whole
truth."
Crockett also said she was displeased with the
network coverage of the war. The military had not
only defeated the Iraqis but "had won another rous
ing victory" over the media, she added.
Flora Lewis, senior foreign affairs columnist at
The New York Times, said that now, as throughout
history, "information is power."
She said that although the media were upset with
the "tremendous difficulty of access" to information
during the Gulf war, the public "accepted very eas
ily" government censorship for security reasons.
Lewis said she thinks the military could tell jour
nalists "what the other side already knows" without
any compromise of troop safety.
She concluded with the observation people are
responsible for thinking critically about news. "If
you're a couch potato, you'll get mashed potatoes,
she said.
The discussion was sponsored by Stanford-in-
Government, the ASSU Speakers Bureau and The
Daily.
