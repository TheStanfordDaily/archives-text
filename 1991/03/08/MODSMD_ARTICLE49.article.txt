# Student animal lovers strive to raise awareness
##

Jocelyn Lee encourages every
member of the Stanford commu
nity to respond to American
Express's advertisements using
the company's business reply
cards.
No, she's not American
Express's dream representative.
In fact, Lee doesn't even want stu
dents to check the box that reads
"Please send me more informa
tion." Instead, Lee, who has cut
up her own charge card, would
love it if every student replied by
scrawling on the response slip,
"Discontinue the sale of fur
coats."
As founder and president of
Students Concerned for Animal
Welfare, Lee, a sophomore, is
deeply involved in the organiza
tion's current campaign to try to
get American Express to stop dis
playing fur coats and offering
them for sale in its mailings.
"We're a group of animal lovers
who get really upset about animal
mistreatment. We're not a radical
group," said Lee, a sophomore.
Lee stressed the importance of
the distinction between animal
welfare and animal-rights
activists. "People for animal
rights, on the extreme, feel that
animals should not be used by
humans. However, we who advo
cate animal welfare feel that ani
mal use is an integral part of
today's society, and we should do
our best to make sure that they
are treated as humanely as possi
ble," she said.

lAie added that the 50-member
organization primarily aims to
spread awareness. "The central
goal of our group is education. We
don't tell people to take a stand on
issues," Lee said.
The group's presentations this
quarter have focused on the use of
animals in cosmetic and product
testing, biomedical research and
fur coats.
The group'B education sessions
have attracted several students.
Sophomore Nicole Bazan said she
joined primarily because she
"wanted to learn more about the
issues and get information about
animal treatment," she said.
Bazan said she feels the video
and speaker presentations attract
ed her most and further confirmed
her previous opinions about the
treatment of animals. "I know the
statistics and have seen graphic
proof," she said. The group "has
given me a much broader view of
the actual spectrum of issues
involved in animal welfare."
Members said they feel there
are many misperceptions about
their year-old organization.
"When people hear the words 'ani
mal rights,' they automatically
assume you're a vegetarian or are
against biomedical research," Lee
said. "Some people even think
that animal-rights activists don't
want a cure for AIDS."
Because Stanford has extensive
biomedical research facilities, Lee
said, "people are willing to over
look us. They assume we advocate
abolition rather than reform."
When she arrived at Stanford,
Lee was surprised groups promot

ing animal welfare hadn't already
been formed. However, Lee said
she now understands because she
has learned "how central biomedi
cal research is to Stanford's exis
tence."
Lee said the group is not

against biomedical research. Ear
lier this year, members took a tour
of animal research laboratories on
campus, where the people were
"very welcoming," she said. "We
really haven't received any antag
onism."

The group's largest undertak
ing this quarter was co-sponsor
ing last night's speech by Ingrid
Newkirk, director of People for
the Ethical Treatment of Ani
mals, the largest animal-rights
organization in the country.
