Elections issues dominated the debate
during last night's ASSU Senate meeting,
as senators rejected the nomination of the
proposed hearings officer and two contro
versial constitutional amendments.
The senate voted against confirming
elections hearings officer Doreen Musson,
who had come under fire recently for sev
eral election rulings. The most controver
sial stated that candidates could be held
responsible — and possibly be disqualified
— if their names appeared in a student pub
lication before April 10, the official begin
ning of the one-week campaign.
Despite an impassioned speech during
the open forum about the nature of democ

racy, only four senators voted to confirm
Musson, a graduate student. Four others
were opposed, and 11 senators abstained.
Musson needed to be approved by two
thirds of the senate to become hearings offi
cer.
The hearings officer is responsible for
interpreting the election rules.
After Musson left and the senate consid
ered her confirmation, several senators
criticized her rulings. Some said they were
worried she was taking the election too seri
ously.
Deputy Senate Chair Beth Morgan, a
sophomore, said Musson "takes the bylaws
to their almost illogical extreme. ... It con
cerns me that she is so willing to put the
First Amendment at risk."
