## 
### Miranda Doyle Howard Libit Staff writers 
Elections issues dominated the debate
during last night's ASSU Senate meeting,
as senators rejected the nomination of the
proposed hearings officer and two contro
versial constitutional amendments.
The senate voted against confirming
elections hearings officer Doreen Musson,
who had come under fire recently for sev
eral election rulings. The most controver
sial stated that candidates could be held
responsible — and possibly be disqualified
— if their names appeared in a student pub
lication before April 10, the official begin
ning of the one-week campaign.
Despite an impassioned speech during
the open forum about the nature of democ

racy, only four senators voted to confirm
Musson, a graduate student. Four others
were opposed, and 11 senators abstained.
Musson needed to be approved by two
thirds of the senate to become hearings offi
cer.
The hearings officer is responsible for
interpreting the election rules.
After Musson left and the senate consid
ered her confirmation, several senators
criticized her rulings. Some said they were
worried she was taking the election too seri
ously.
Deputy Senate Chair Beth Morgan, a
sophomore, said Musson "takes the bylaws
to their almost illogical extreme. ... It con
cerns me that she is so willing to put the
First Amendment at risk."
Some senators did show sup
port for Musson during the
debate, if only because she was
simply following rules established
by the senate itself.
"The senate body should
change the laws if it does not like
them," said graduate senator
James Vera. "Attack the rules —
not the person reading them."
After Musson was not con
firmed, senators said they were
confused about how to find a new
hearings officer. Elections Com
missioner Raul Lopez, who
selected Musson after a series of
interviews, warned senators
before the vote that he would not
conduct another search. After the
meeting, he promised to stick by
that decision.
At the end of the meeting, Mor
gan nominated four students for
hearings officer: senator Jason
Moore, Steven Krauss, last year's
elections commissioner, and
sophomores Andy Katz and Kofi
Bruce. The senate will consider

the issue at its next meeting.
A hearings committee that will
rule on bylaw questions has not
yet been formed. Senate Chair
Solina Kwan, a junior, informed
Lopez that he is responsible for
forming this committee, and he
promised to do so as soon as possi
ble.
Lopez, who said he was sur
prised that Musson was rejected,
expressed concerns about the
impartiality of any new hearings
officer appointed by the senate.
"A new hearings officer might
have some affiliation with one
party or the other. I will be a bit
suspicious of the next person,"
said Lopez, a graduate student. "I
would like to question the next
person and have veto power."
Few people sounded surprised
by the results of the vote. "It was
expected. It was a vague vote on a
vague candidate," said COP mem
ber Goodwin Liu, a senior. "She
did not lay out clearly what she
would do if she were in office. She
needed to be more specific," he
added.
But some senators were upset
by the way the confirmation pro
cess was handled.

"She has had several open ses
sions and not a single member of
the People's Platform was in
attendance," said graduate sena
tor John Overdeck. "Essentially,
nobody gave her a chance. The
entire thing was conducted by
hearsay."
"The result of this will be
chaos, which is what some people
want," Overdeck added. "There
can no longer be a campaign-rules
violation because there is no com
mittee to judge it as one."
In other business last night,
senators voted down bills to place
two constitutional amendments
on the spring ballot. One would
have limited the scope of the
ASSU Senate debate to matters
"directly affecting Stanford stu
dents." Overdeck, who wrote the
bill with graduate senator Dou
glas Bone, said he will now collect
signatures to place the bill on the
ballot.
At its next meeting the senate
will consider a related bill that
would require the senate to deter
mine the student body's opinion
before voting on issues not
directly related to Stanford.
