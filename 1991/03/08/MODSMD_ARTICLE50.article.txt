# National group's president criticizes cruelty
## 
### Kathy Ardalan Staff writer 
Before a large crowd in
Kresge Auditorium last night,
the president of People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals
criticized the abuse of animals
in research — throughout the
world and at Stanford.
"It's about time that people
know what a pig has to go
through to become an Oscar-
Meyer wiener," said Ingrid
Newkirk, president of the
largest animal-rights group in
the United States. The pro
gram was organized by Stu
dents Concerned for Animal
Welfare, a year-old campus
group, and the Palo Alto
Humane Society.
Newkirk, author of "101
Ways to Save the Animals,"
said the goal of the animal
rights movement is to curb
"human aggression and human
greed."
She criticized circuses and
parades, asking how society

can call itself civilized while
forcing animals to perform
unnatural acts.
Researchers who use ani
mals to test their products
"don't want to stop and don't
want to be honest about what
they do," she claimed.
The audience was shown a
graphic, controversial 10-
minute video of baboons
undergoing traumatic head
injuries in research at the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania.
Newkirk said officials at the
National Institutes of Health
were angered that activists had
the footage.
Pressure from her organiza
tion has forced several compa
nies to go "cruelty-free,"
Newkirk said. For example,
instead of testing its new per
fume on rats, Benetton now
uses other methods.
Finally, Newkirk challenged
animal research at Stanford. In
1987, the University reported
to the government only half
the actual number of animals

killed in research, she said.
She questioned why the uni
versity would discourage soft
ware that would allow students
to dissect frogs on the com
puter, rather than in real life.
She further challenged Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy
for supporting research in the
cosmetic industry.
Newkirk said she has
received positive response to
her book has been positive,
leading her to believe there has
been a change from "viewing
animals as cheap burglar
alarms to fellow citizens of the
planet."
She said this change in atti
tude began in 1980 when
activist Paul Watson sailed
around the Atlantic Ocean in
pursuit of a boat illegally
killing whales. He caught and
sank the boat in what Newkirk
called one of the first events in
the animal-rights movement.
Newkirk encouraged all con
cerned citizens to try to make a
difference.
