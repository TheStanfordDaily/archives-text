# Property holders want tax exemption
## 
### Sarah Morisseau Staff writer 
Stanford faculty and staff living on
University-owned land may become
exempt from property taxes and may
even receive refunds for taxes paid in
the past, if a case before the California
Supreme Court is upheld.
The case involves a request by UC-
Irvine faculty and staff that people liv
ing on that university's campus be
exempt property taxes. Lower courts
have ruled in their favor, saying the land
is used for university purposes and
should be exempt under the California
Constitution.
Stanford, in response to a request
from the Stanford Campus Residential
Leaseholders' Association, has filed a
similar claim with Santa Clara County,
said Sean Flavin, legal consultant for
the group.
Faculty and staff housing would not
only become exempt from future prop
erty taxes, but tax money for the last
four years would also be refunded, he

said.
The Stanford proposal differs from
the UC-Irvine one in that it also
requests refunds for taxes on physical
improvements made to the houses, not
just taxes on the land itself, Flavin said.
Improvements include remodeling,
additions and other changes that raise
the property value.
"If the faculty in the Irvine case suc
ceed, [Stanford 1 will be exempt from
paying taxes on land, but not on
improvements. The question will still
remain if improvements at Stanford will
be exempt," Flavin said. That issue
might have to be resolved in court, he
added.
Property taxes are assessed by Santa
Clara County and support a variety of
services, including the Palo Alto Unified
School District and police, fire and road
services. All Palo Alto homeowners and
leaseholders must pay property taxes.
However, Stanford residents' tax
money does not go to Stanford police,
fire or road departments. Instead, fac
ulty and staff with houses on campus

must pay an additional tax for these ser
vices based on the size of their property.
Jon Barwise, a former Stanford phi
losophy professor who headed a Univer
sity task force to decide those charges
for the 19905, estimates the average
additional tax is $125 per year.
He said faculty and staff "are paying
real estate taxes on land they don't own
— land that Stanford owns — and then
they're not getting the services they're
paying for. It's a double whammy type of
thing."
"The sentiment is that [the county]
should be helping us by paying for police
and fire or give us our money back," said
Barwise, who is now a professor at Indi
ana University.
But Education Prof. Henry Levin,
who lives on campus, said he doesn't see
this as an adequate reason for request
ing the exemption
"There's a loophole in the law that
allows us to do this. . . . But the whole
purpose of taxation is for the common
