## U.S. troops return; Iraqis to be freed 
### 
As a trickle of American troops arriving
home swelled to a joyous flood today, the U.S.
military announced plans for the mass repatri
ation of more than 60,000 Iraqi prisoners of
war. The freed Iraqis will return to a homeland
gripped by rebellion, where dissenters face the
threat of death.
One arriving American soldier bent to kiss
the ground after a C-141 transport plane carry
ing 104 troops touched down early today at
Hunter Army Airfield in Savannah, Ga. A wait
ing crowd cheered wildly, and a huge banner
read, "Welcome Home Heroes."
A far grimmer homecoming awaited the
Iraqi POWs, whose repatriation is to begin
Monday. The uprising against Saddam
Hussein was said to have spread to his cap
ital, and the government said anyone
involved is a "traitor" who will pay dearly.
The U.S. military command said today
an agreement reached by allied and Iraqi
officials yesterday calls for several hundred
Iraqis per day to be sent home by bus and
truck from holding camps in northern
Saudi Arabia.
The anti-Saddam uprising has caused
chaos in southern Iraq, where about three
dozen foreign journalists have disappeared.
The U.S. Central Command in the Saudi
capital of Riyadh said in a statement today
that Iraqi officials did not admit to any
knowledge of the journalists' whereabouts.
But the Iraqis promised to hand over any
foreign journalists they found to the Red
Cross, the statement said.
One Red Cross official said about 20 of
the missing journalists would be freed
today, but the Bush administration said it
knew nothing of such a plan.
The Iraqis are also promising to release
an estimated 30,000 Kuwaitis abducted
during the nearly seven-month Iraqi occu
pation of the emirate.
The first 1,000 of them were freed yes
terday, and some were arriving home today
in Kuwait City, where they expressed fury
at their former captors.
"It was like hell," said Hami Jamal, a 27-
year-old computer engineer who was taken

from his house by Iraqi troops three weeks
ago. "We drank swamp water for days. And
for what crimes? For being Kuwaitis."
With the passing of the Persian Gulf
War, Secretary of State James Baker 111
turned his attention to another Middle
East quarrel — the Arab-Israeli conflict.
En route to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where
he was to hold meetings today, Baker told
reporters that the United States is pre
pared to meet with Palestinian Arabs in
Israel.
Barring a new outbreak of fighting in
the Gulf, U.S. troops will begin leaving at
the rate of 5,000 a day, Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney said yesterday.
At that rate, most of the 540,000 U.S.
soldiers sent to the Gulf would be home by
the Fourth of July, the date President Bush
has set as "a special day of celebration for
our returning troops."
Saddam may have more to fear from top
Iraqi officials than from civil unrest.
According to U.S. intelligence assessments,
there are signs of discontent among Sad
dam's inner circle — political and military
allies who would be best positioned for a
strike against him.
Official Iraqi media, which at first
ignored the unrest, made their first overt
reference to it yesterday, in the form of
threats against dissidents.
"Everybody who tries to undermine the
security of the revolution is a traitor and a
mercenary," said the Al-Thawra newspaper.
"All of them shall regret it. They will pay."
