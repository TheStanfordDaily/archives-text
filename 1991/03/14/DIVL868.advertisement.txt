(formerly Survey of the Energy Industries)
A comprehensive overview of the primary sources of energy: oil, natural
gas, coal, nuclear and hydroelectric, and emerging solutions such as
solar, wind, geothermal, cogeneration and conservation. The course will
provide a basic technical understanding of how each resource generates
energy. The history of development of each resource and an evaluation
of economic, environmental, technical, and political factors that effect
supply and demand for each resource will be discussed.
There will be five field trips and attendance at three is mandatory.
• San Ardo Oil Field (Oil and Gas)
• Auburn Dam Site (Hydro) and Rancho Seco (Nuclear and Solar)
• Altamont Pass Windfarms (Wind)
• Palo Alto Landfill (Gas) and Stanford University Cogeneration
