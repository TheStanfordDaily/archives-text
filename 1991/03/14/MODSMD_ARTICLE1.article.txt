# House subcommittee lambastes Stanford
## Hearing reveals more embarrassing charges, hints of 'criminal liability' 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
WASHINGTON — Stanford got pum
meled yesterday by Rep. John Dingell and
his House Subcommittee on Oversight and
Investigations.
Moments after banging his gavel to open
a long-awaited hearing on Stanford's indi
rect cost policies, the Michigan Democrat
offered the 200 spectators and reporters
packed in the congressional hearing room a
blunt assessment of what was to follow:
"What we will hear today is a story of
taxpayer dollars going to bloated overhead
rather than to scientific research," Dingell
said. "It is a story of excess and arrogance,
compounded by lax governmental over
sight."
By the time he banged his gavel to close
the hearing, Dingell had listened to seven
hours of testimony from 10 federal officials
and five Stanford administrators, but had
heard nothing that altered his conclusion.
"The record today does you and the Uni
versity no credit," Dingell said at the end of
a scathing address to University President
Donald Kennedy, the hearing's final wit
ness.
In between Dingell's opening comments
and his closing lecture, federal auditors
voiced serious concerns about Stanford's
accounting system and disclosed dozens
more embarrassing items that the Univer

sity had included as indirect costs of
research in its bills to the government dur
ing the last decade — most notably
$185,872 for administrative costs of the
Stanford Shopping Center in 1986 and
1987.
The shopping center charges were a
direct violation of federal rules, much like
bills for the depreciation of the 72-foot
yacht Victoria, which several months ago
congressional investigators disclosed had
been included in Stanford's indirect cost
claims.
Investigators also revealed at yester
day's hearing several thousand dollars of
improper charges for alumni functions,
public relations activities and advertising
costs from past years. Such charges, Dingell
said, raise a "serious question of criminal
liability."
Kennedy later countered that he was
quite worried about "loose allegations"
about Stanford officials made by subcom
mittee members.
Upon leaving the hearing room yester
day, an exasperated Kennedy became the
center of a media mob scene. In a brief
interview with The Daily a few minutes
later, he said the hearing had been "pretty

charges rather than on larger pol
icy issues.
Inside the hearing room,
Kennedy acknowledged that the
University's accounting system
has shortcomings and pledged to
"make Stanford a model for uni
versity contracting relationships
with the government."
Yesterday's hearing was an
important chapter in the contro
versy that has erupted over Stan
ford's indirect cost policies, but it
was by no means the final one.
University and Navy officials are
several weeks away from complet
ing a review of past accounting
agreements, called memoranda of
understanding, and from deter
mining how much Stanford can

bill the government in the future.
Stanford has millions of dollars
in indirect cost recovery riding on
the those negotiations with the
Navy. The uncertainty of the
outcome was underscored yester
day when the Defense Contract
Audit Agency publicly recom
mended that Stanford's indirect
cost rate be dropped to 52 percent
— a drastic reduction from the 78
percent the University originally
proposed for this year.
The audit agency serves in an
advisory capacity to the Office of
Naval Research, which negotiates
with Stanford to determine the
University'B indirect cost rate.
Each percentage point in the
indirect cost rate translates into
roughly $1.25 million in income
for the University. If the indirect
cost rate dropped to 52 percent,
Stanford would lose $30 million in

expected revenue this year alone.
Dingell noted that he looked at
the Defense Contract Audit
Agency's recommendation "with
approval."
But in an interview last night,
Assoc. Vice President for Public
Affairs Larry Horton said he
would consider such an outcome
"astonishing and quite unfair."
The audit agency's recom
mended rate of 52 percent rests
on its contention that most of the
memoranda of understanding
between Stanford and the govern
ment are flawed or inadequate
and should be eliminated.
A Navy report released last
month found that Office of Naval
Research officials had not sought
required legal or audit reviews of
the vast majority of these agree
ments. Stanford has about 90 cur
rent memoranda of understand
ing, far more than any other
school.
Subcommittee members, as
well as federal auditors who testi
fied yesterday, portrayed Stanford
as an overly aggressive contractor
that took advantage of the Navy's
lax oversight during the 1980s.
"Stanford does not bear this
blame alone," said Norman Lent,
R-N.Y. The performance of the
Office of Naval Research "was
nothing short of pitiful," he said.
Milton Socolar of the General
Accounting Office said that when
deciding what costs to charge the
government, "Stanford was tak
ing advantage of every opening
that presented itself." The Navy,
he said, did nothing to stop the
University.
Rear Adm. William Miller, the
chief of naval research, testified
that due to poor performance by
his organization, he had "consid
erable doubts" about the accuracy
of the indirect cost rates negoti
ated with Stanford during the
1980s.
Dingell praised the efforts of
Paul Biddle, the campus represen
tative of the Office of Naval
Research who arrived at Stanford
in October 1988 and touched off
several federal investigations with
his allegations of massive over
billing and "coziness" between

Stanford and past Navy officials.
The majority of the discussion
yesterday, however, centered on
individual accounting errors and
controversial charges, especially
those associated with Lou Henry
Hoover House, the residence of
Kennedy and his family. In
December,the subcommittee dis
closed that Hoover House floral
arrangements, antique purchases
and cedar-lined closets had been
included in an accounting pool
that is charged in part to the gov
ernment.
Because several research func
tions are held at Hoover House
each year, Stanford has been
allowed to bill the government for
23 percent of all Hoover House
operating charges. Nevertheless,
the University withdrew these
expenses in January, saying they
were too difficult to explain to the

public.
Government auditors testify
ing yesterday added to the list of
hard-to-explain Hoover House
charges: a $1,200 fruitwood com
mode, the unspecified cost of
enlarging Kennedy's bed, $7,000
in new sheets for the larger bed,
$1,530 for personal laundry ser
vices and $3,000 for two Voltaire
chairs.
Kennedy insisted the Hoover
House charges were "technically
allowable," but his argument did
not impress Rep. Ron Wyden, D-
Ore. "I don't see this as a debate
about technical rules," Wyden
said. "The taxpayers see these
charges are wrong."
Wyden, a 1971 graduate of
Stanford, said the hearing
marked "a very sad day for one of
the world's greatest universities."
Dingell was also critical of the

Hoover House charges. He asked,
"What do any of these charges
have to do with the furtherance of
federally funded science, Ameri
can competitiveness or cures to
dreaded diseases?"
"The mischarging reflects an
attitude that may permeate all too
many universities when dealing
with federal money," Dingell said.
"That attitude is unacceptable."
The subcommittee has already
begun looking at the practices of
Harvard Medical School.
Dingell and other subcommit
tee members compared the cur
rent situation at Stanford to the
defense contractor scandals of the
mid-1980s. It was Dingell's sub
committee that found out that the
Pentagon had paid $640 for a toi
let seat and that General Dynam
ics had billed the Pentagon for
country club dues.

Damian Marhefka — Daily
Rep. John Dingell, D-Mlch., the powerful chair of the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investiga
tions, led the charge against Stanford in yesterday's congressional hearing. The tale told by federal
auditors and Stanford officials, he said, "is a story of excess and arrogance, compounded by lax gov
ernmental oversight."
WASHINGTON — Stanford got pum
meled yesterday by Rep. John Dingell and
his House Subcommittee on Oversight and
Investigations.
Moments after banging his gavel to open
a long-awaited hearing on Stanford's indi
rect cost policies, the Michigan Democrat
offered the 200 spectators and reporters
packed in the congressional hearing room a
blunt assessment of what was to follow:
"What we will hear today is a story of
taxpayer dollars going to bloated overhead
rather than to scientific research," Dingell
said. "It is a story of excess and arrogance,
compounded by lax governmental over
sight."
By the time he banged his gavel to close
the hearing, Dingell had listened to seven
hours of testimony from 10 federal officials
and five Stanford administrators, but had
heard nothing that altered his conclusion.
"The record today does you and the Uni
versity no credit," Dingell said at the end of
a scathing address to University President
Donald Kennedy, the hearing's final wit
ness.
In between Dingell's opening comments
and his closing lecture, federal auditors
voiced serious concerns about Stanford's
accounting system and disclosed dozens
more embarrassing items that the Univer

sity had included as indirect costs of
research in its bills to the government dur
ing the last decade — most notably
$185,872 for administrative costs of the
Stanford Shopping Center in 1986 and
1987.
The shopping center charges were a
direct violation of federal rules, much like
bills for the depreciation of the 72-foot
yacht Victoria, which several months ago
congressional investigators disclosed had
been included in Stanford's indirect cost
claims.
Investigators also revealed at yester
day's hearing several thousand dollars of
improper charges for alumni functions,
public relations activities and advertising
costs from past years. Such charges, Dingell
said, raise a "serious question of criminal
liability."
Kennedy later countered that he was
quite worried about "loose allegations"
about Stanford officials made by subcom
mittee members.
Upon leaving the hearing room yester
day, an exasperated Kennedy became the
center of a media mob scene. In a brief
interview with The Daily a few minutes
later, he said the hearing had been "pretty
much" what he expected, but expressed dis
appointment that so much attention had

charges rather than on larger pol
icy issues.
Inside the hearing room,
Kennedy acknowledged that the
University's accounting system
has shortcomings and pledged to
"make Stanford a model for uni
versity contracting relationships
with the government."
Yesterday's hearing was an
important chapter in the contro
versy that has erupted over Stan
ford's indirect cost policies, but it
was by no means the final one.
University and Navy officials are
several weeks away from complet
ing a review of past accounting
agreements, called memoranda of
understanding, and from deter
mining how much Stanford can

bill the government in the future.
Stanford has millions of dollars
in indirect cost recovery riding on
the those negotiations with the
Navy. The uncertainty of the
outcome was underscored yester
day when the Defense Contract
Audit Agency publicly recom
mended that Stanford's indirect
cost rate be dropped to 52 percent
— a drastic reduction from the 78
percent the University originally
proposed for this year.
The audit agency serves in an
advisory capacity to the Office of
Naval Research, which negotiates
with Stanford to determine the
University'B indirect cost rate.
Each percentage point in the
indirect cost rate translates into
roughly $1.25 million in income
for the University. If the indirect
cost rate dropped to 52 percent,
Stanford would lose $30 million in

expected revenue this year alone.
Dingell noted that he looked at
the Defense Contract Audit
Agency's recommendation "with
approval."
But in an interview last night,
Assoc. Vice President for Public
Affairs Larry Horton said he
would consider such an outcome
"astonishing and quite unfair."
The audit agency's recom
mended rate of 52 percent rests
on its contention that most of the
memoranda of understanding
between Stanford and the govern
ment are flawed or inadequate
and should be eliminated.
A Navy report released last
month found that Office of Naval
Research officials had not sought
required legal or audit reviews of
the vast majority of these agree
ments. Stanford has about 90 cur
rent memoranda of understand
ing, far more than any other
school.
Subcommittee members, as
well as federal auditors who testi
fied yesterday, portrayed Stanford
as an overly aggressive contractor
that took advantage of the Navy's
lax oversight during the 1980s.
"Stanford does not bear this
blame alone," said Norman Lent,
R-N.Y. The performance of the
Office of Naval Research "was
nothing short of pitiful," he said.
Milton Socolar of the General
Accounting Office said that when
deciding what costs to charge the
government, "Stanford was tak
ing advantage of every opening
that presented itself." The Navy,
he said, did nothing to stop the
University.
Rear Adm. William Miller, the
chief of naval research, testified
that due to poor performance by
his organization, he had "consid
erable doubts" about the accuracy
of the indirect cost rates negoti
ated with Stanford during the
1980s.
Dingell praised the efforts of
Paul Biddle, the campus represen
tative of the Office of Naval
Research who arrived at Stanford
in October 1988 and touched off
several federal investigations with
his allegations of massive over
billing and "coziness" between

Stanford and past Navy officials.
The majority of the discussion
yesterday, however, centered on
individual accounting errors and
controversial charges, especially
those associated with Lou Henry
Hoover House, the residence of
Kennedy and his family. In
December,the subcommittee dis
closed that Hoover House floral
arrangements, antique purchases
and cedar-lined closets had been
included in an accounting pool
that is charged in part to the gov
ernment.
Because several research func
tions are held at Hoover House
each year, Stanford has been
allowed to bill the government for
23 percent of all Hoover House
operating charges. Nevertheless,
the University withdrew these
expenses in January, saying they
were too difficult to explain to the

public.
Government auditors testify
ing yesterday added to the list of
hard-to-explain Hoover House
charges: a $1,200 fruitwood com
mode, the unspecified cost of
enlarging Kennedy's bed, $7,000
in new sheets for the larger bed,
$1,530 for personal laundry ser
vices and $3,000 for two Voltaire
