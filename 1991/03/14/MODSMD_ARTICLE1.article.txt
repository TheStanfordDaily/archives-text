# House subcommittee lambastes Stanford
## Hearing reveals more embarrassing charges, hints of 'criminal liability' 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
WASHINGTON — Stanford got pum
meled yesterday by Rep. John Dingell and
his House Subcommittee on Oversight and
Investigations.
Moments after banging his gavel to open
a long-awaited hearing on Stanford's indi
rect cost policies, the Michigan Democrat
offered the 200 spectators and reporters
packed in the congressional hearing room a
blunt assessment of what was to follow:
"What we will hear today is a story of
taxpayer dollars going to bloated overhead
rather than to scientific research," Dingell
said. "It is a story of excess and arrogance,
compounded by lax governmental over
sight."
By the time he banged his gavel to close
the hearing, Dingell had listened to seven
hours of testimony from 10 federal officials
and five Stanford administrators, but had
heard nothing that altered his conclusion.
"The record today does you and the Uni
versity no credit," Dingell said at the end of
a scathing address to University President
Donald Kennedy, the hearing's final wit
ness.
In between Dingell's opening comments
and his closing lecture, federal auditors
voiced serious concerns about Stanford's
accounting system and disclosed dozens
more embarrassing items that the Univer

sity had included as indirect costs of
research in its bills to the government dur
ing the last decade — most notably
$185,872 for administrative costs of the
Stanford Shopping Center in 1986 and
1987.
The shopping center charges were a
direct violation of federal rules, much like
bills for the depreciation of the 72-foot
yacht Victoria, which several months ago
congressional investigators disclosed had
been included in Stanford's indirect cost
claims.
Investigators also revealed at yester
day's hearing several thousand dollars of
improper charges for alumni functions,
public relations activities and advertising
costs from past years. Such charges, Dingell
said, raise a "serious question of criminal
liability."
Kennedy later countered that he was
quite worried about "loose allegations"
about Stanford officials made by subcom
mittee members.
Upon leaving the hearing room yester
day, an exasperated Kennedy became the
center of a media mob scene. In a brief
interview with The Daily a few minutes
later, he said the hearing had been "pretty
much" what he expected, but expressed dis
appointment that so much attention had
been focused on individual controversial
