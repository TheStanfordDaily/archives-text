# Attempted auto theft thwarted
## 
### Dan Stearns Staff writer 
Two residents of East Palo Alto
were caught by Stanford Police
yesterday morning after they
allegedly tried to steal a car in the
parking lot of Stanford Hospital.
John Walton, 22, and James
Hardeman, 19, were arrested and
placed in North County Jail on
charges of burglary and
attempted auto theft. Bail has

been set at $5,000 for each sus
pect.
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer said a hospital security
officer spotted the two suspects
prying down a window of a 1971
Buick on the fourth level of the
hospital parking structure at 9:20
a.m. The lot is at the corner of
Campus Drive and Roth Way.
Niemeyer said the suspects fled
on foot but were captured minutes
later by Stanford Police units.

"That type of car is pretty easy
to get into," said Niemeyer. "I
don't know the exact figures, but
we have had a lot of problems with
auto burglaries and vehicle theft
in the last year."
A police detective investigating
the Feb. 22 robbery at the Medical
Center branch of the Stanford
Federal Credit Union determined
that the two suspects were not
those who robbed the credit
union, Niemeyer said.
