Federal judge allows media
access to campus crime reports
SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) â€” A federal
judge ruled yesterday in a case closely watched
by advocates of media access to government
information that Southwest Missouri State
University may not keep campus crime reports
private.
The ruling by U.S. District Judge Russell
Clark was a victory for the editor of the stu
dent newspaper at the university who had sued
to gain access to campus crime reports.
University spokesperson Paul Kincaid, a
defendant in the lawsuit, said it was not imme
diately known if the ruling would be appealed.
The school's Board of Regents will discuss the
decision at its meeting Friday, he said.
"This is a precedent-setting case which
could affect thousands of schools in Missouri
and across the country," Kincaid said.
"Because of that, the regents' decision is even
more difficult and important."
Los Angeles police chief won't
resign in face of brutal scandal
LOS ANGELES (AP) - Police Chief Daryl
Gates won't resign despite the escalating cam
paign urging he quit because of the videotaped
officer beating that made his department a
national disgrace, a spokesperson said yesterday.
"He has promised his troops that he is going
to stay here and provide the leadership to
restore the shine and gleam of that badge," said
Lt. Fred Nixon, department spokesperson.
In a speech to officers at the Police
Academy, a combative Gates never mentioned
resigning. He said in the past that the scandal
won't drive him out of his $169,000-a-year job.
"My heart is in this organization," Gates
said on the eve of expected grand jury indict
ments against officers whose brutal throttling
of motorist Rodney King was televised to the
world on network TV
Ten die in fiery rush-hour crash
HUNGERFORD, England (AP) - Forty
five cars and trucks slammed together in the
fog early yesterday in a fiery pileup that killed
10 people and injured 25, police said.
The rush-hour crash left charred hulks of
melted metal scattered over the London-bound
lanes of the M-4 highway about 70 miles west
of London, closing one side of the major east
west artery and creating a huge traffic jam.
Witnesses said a fireball erupted after the
initial crash at 6:50 a.m., which occurred in
heavy fog. Firefighters doused the burning
vehicles with foam and used special equipment
to cut bodies from the charred wreckage.
Police originally said 13 people were killed,
but later reduced the number to 10 and said
there had been confusion at the mortuary.
