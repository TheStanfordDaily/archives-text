# Bush says Iran
## must not take Iraqi territory 
### 
OTTAWA (AP) — President Bush, on a whirlwind
journey of postwar diplomacy, cautioned Iran yester
day against seizing Iraqi territory in the aftermath
of the Persian Gulf war. "That would be the worst
thing they could do," he said.
Bush also accused Iraq of violating terms of a con
ditional cease-fire by using combat helicopters to
attack rebel forces. "That's one thing that has got to
be resolved before we're going to have any perma
nence to any cease-fire," Bush said.
At a news conference with Canadian Prime Minis
ter Brian Mulroney, Bush said it was "impossible to
have normalized relations" with Iraq as long as Sad
dam Hussein remains in power. Yet he said he was
concerned about instability in the region that might
result from the internal unrest in Iraq.
Bush said there was no evidence that Iran was
trying to get a foothold in Iraq but emphasized that
"Iran must not and should not try to annex any of
the territory of Iraq."
Saddam's forces have been battling for control of
Iraq, fighting Shiite loyalists in the south and con
fronting Kurdish rebels in the north.
Bush touched down in Canada on the first leg of a
five-day trip that also will include sessions on the
island of Martinique in the Caribbean with French
President Francois Mitterrand and in Bermuda with
British Prime Minister John Major. France and
Great Britain — and Canada to a lesser extent — all
committed forces to Operation Desert Storm, the
allied campaign that routed Iraqi troops from
Kuwait.
Aside from talks on the Persian Gulf war, Bush
and Mulroney signed an agreement to reduce acid
rain and to cooperate in reducing other air pollu
tants. At that ceremony, Mulroney spoke enviously
of Bush's postwar popularity rating of 91 percent.
Mulroney, whose popularity has fallen below 20
percent, suggested that Bush share some of his rat
ings. "We can then, George, divide by two and we
both come out ahead."
Their joint news conference was dominated by
questions about the Persian Gulf, and Bush's deter
mination to seek peace among Israel and its Arab
neighbors.
Bush said Secretary of State James Baker 111 had
found an improved diplomatic climate on his trip to
Middle Eastern capitals, but the president stopped
short of saying that either Israeli or Palestinian lead
ers were ready-to make significant changes in their
long-held positions.
"I can't tell you about radically shifting posi
tions," Bush said. On the other hand, he said, "I
haven't seen anything pessimistic coming out of the
Baker reports."
The president said the threat to Israel is "signifi
cantly diminished because of what happened to
Iraq," and that he hopes it means "that we won't
have ever increasing arms sales" to the Jewish state.
However, Bush did not embrace Mulroney's idea
for tighter curbs on global arms sales.
