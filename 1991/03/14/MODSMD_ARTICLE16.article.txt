# Exxon to pay $1 billion for spill
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Exxon
Corp. agreed yesterday to pay
$900 million to complete the 1989
Exxon Valdez oil spill cleanup off
the coast of Alaska as part of a set
tlement that includes four guilty
pleas and a record $100 million
criminal fine.
Attorney General Dick Thorn
burgh announced the deal, saying
it settled all state and federal
claims arising from the 11 million
gallon oil spill in Prince William
Sound.
Thornburgh said the settle
ment required "by far the largest
single amount ever paid as a
result of environmental viola
tion."
The criminal fine, he said,
"sends an important signal that
assessments for environmental
spoilage cannot simply be
answered by paying damages."
That fine is in addition to the
$900 million settlement.
The settlement, announced by
Thornburgh and Alaska Gov. Wal
ter Hickel, obliges Exxon to reim

burse* state and federal cleanup
efforts from the $900 million fund
that it will pay over the next
decade. Thornburgh said he did
not know if Exxon could deduct
any of the payment from its taxes.
Private lawsuits are not pre
cluded by the settlement with
Exxon, which already has paid
$2.5 billion to clean up the spill.
Exxon Corp. and its shipping
subsidiary also agreed to plead
guilty to four misdemeanor
charges of environmental crimes
stemming from the spill of 11 mil
lion gallons of oil from the tanker
Exxon Valdez into Prince William
Sound.
The consent decree, which
must be approved by a federal
judge in Alaska, also includes a
clause under which Exxon would
pay an additional $100 million for
any unforeseen environmental
damage.
The criminal fine is 20 times
the previous record for a criminal
environmental conviction. The
earlier record fine was paid by

Allied Chemical Corp. in 1976 for
spilling chemicals into Virginia's
James River, officials said.
Thornburgh acknowledged
that by accepting misdemeanor
pleas instead of going to trial on
the indictment that also charged
felony crimes, the Justice Depart
ment was avoiding testing novel
legal claims during a lengthy
criminal trial.
William Reilly, head of the
Environmental Protection
Agency, said the settlement
ensures that "the funds will be
available years earlier than any
recovery that could have beon
secured through full litigation."
The settlement will "allow us
to turn our full attention finally to
the tasks of restoration" in Prince
William Sound, Reilly said.
The National Wildlife Federa
tion praised some aspects of the
deal, but said it couldn't say
whether the settlement was ade
quate for the cleanup until scien
tific studies of the environmental
damage were made public.
