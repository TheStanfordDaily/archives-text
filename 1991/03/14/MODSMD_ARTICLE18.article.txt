## Reform the senate 
### 
Make the ASSU Senate
the representative body
it was meant to be

AS THE ASSU ELECTIONS
approach, an alarming num
ber of Stanford students
regard the candidates' campaigns
with little more than disinterest.
Signs of apathy abound. The
prevailing attitude is that students
who vote do so merely to obtain
their fee refund, that candidates
are elected on little meaningful cri
teria, and that the ASSU will
remain unresponsive to student
concerns, taking unpopular
stances on international issues
while real student needs are left
untouched.
Students see the ASSU elections
at best as an irrelevancy, and at
worst as an irritation.
It doesn't have to be this way.
The ASSU is a potentially powerful
organization. It controls an endow
ment of over $2 million, and is the
nominal voice of one of the bright
est and most respected student
bodies in the nation.
What has gone wrong? Perhaps
the greatest problem is that the
ASSU senators are unaccountable
to the students whom they suppos
edly represent.
Few, if any, students know how
any senator voted on any issue this
year. That is at least in part
because no senator represents
them. Senators are elected in the
spring by the general student body,
then left to act as the spirit moves
them the rest of the year.
Consider the following sugges
tion:
Instead of having twenty at
large senate spots representing the
general student body, the ASSU
could divide the campus into dis
tricts for representation. Each dis

trict could elect a senator.
The residence is an ideal unit of
representation. Representatives
could easily report to their con
stituents every week, and receive
input for future decisions. Elec
tions would be held twice a year, at
the beginning of fall quarter and in
the middle of winter quarter, to
foster accountability to students.
Large residences like Roble Hall
could elect several representatives.
The smaller Row Houses could
elect a representative together.
Under this system, students
could better choose among the can
didates, since they would know
each of them and their views. And
the weekly reports and feedback at
house meetings would restore a
long-lost sense of accountability to
students.
Like any suggestion, this one is
open to criticism. For example, the
size of the senate would increase
dramatically, making it more
unwieldy.
But by enforcing certain parlia
mentary rules, forming alliances
on each issue and electing speakers
among themselves, representatives
could still conduct meetings effi
ciently.
Consider the advantages of a
student government that was truly
representative of and responsive to
student needs.
A credible ASSU could lobby the
administration for substantive
changes. President Kennedy has
proven responsive to student con
cerns when they are clear and well
articulated. An accountable ASSU
could more rightfully claim to rep
resent student opinion and exert
pressure on the administration.
Students would no longer feel
the need the muffle their own stu
dent government with measures
like the Overdeck bill. A govern
ment that truly spoke for students
would be a welcome voice on cam
pus.
