Catholicism is truing hard to respond to its critics

Delia ibarra's recent col
umn, "Living in Guilt," captured
my attention for several reasons.
Apart from my own personal affiliation
with Catholicism from within a Mexican-
American context, I have had the oppor
tunity during my time here at Stanford
to pursue my academic interests in that
field, and this exposure has given me
new insights into our experiences in reli
gion.
Thus, while I sympathize with
Ibarra's painful past, I feel it is impor
tant to share some of these insights
which acknowledge that God and
Catholicism encompass more than she
suggests.
There is no doubt in my mind that
guilt has figured prominently in the
Catholic Church's dealing with its peo
ple, and I do not wish to minimize the
experience of guilt which has scarred so
many lives (my own included).

But I do not think it is fair to equate
God with guilt. To say that it is "the
guilt that never leaves you" contradicts
the very act of love that God and Jesus
shared with us. No, I think that we must
recognize the difference between a
human, and therefore fallible, church
and a divine, caring God who chose to
share in our humanity through Jesus.
I do agree with Ibarra about the
strong Catholic presence in our culture
and its "hybrid" nature. Virgilio Eli
zondo, a Catholic theologian, speaks of
this nature as a mestizaje: the process
(which was shamelessly violent at times)
that brought two cultures together in a
painful but life-giving birth, the product
being Mexican and Chicano Catholicism.
The Roman Church, while slow to
respond to our people and our particular
needs, has not ignored us. From the mid
18th century when Pope Benedict XIV
officially recognized Mexico's special

place as a chosen nation because of Our
Lady of Guadalupe's (the Virgin Mary)
apparition nedr Mexico City, to 1983
when the U.S. Catholic bishops recog
nized "the Hispanic community among
us as a blessing from God," the Catholic
Church has gone beyond the Spanish •
subjugation that Ibarra notes.
To be sure, the church's treatment of
our people has left much to be desired.
Pastors have often misunderstood the
richness of our popular religiosity (man
das, altarcitos, bendiciones, com
padrazco, etc.) The hierarchy has made
it difficult for Chicanos to be in
leadership positions, and social justice
has not alleviated much of our people's
poverty.
The response among Latinos has
ranged from becoming less active in
parishes to leaving the Catholic Church
for a Protestant religion.
However, the church is trying to

respond. Taking a lead from the U.S.
bishops who said that "Hispanic Catholi
cism is an outstanding example of how
the Gospel can permeate a culture to its
very roots," church leaders in many com
munities have made a commitment to
our people. Through programs like Cur
sillos, Movimiento Familiar Cristiano,
Comunidades de Base and lay ministry,
our people are claiming a place within
the church.
If we, as a people, want these condi
tions to continue to improve, then we
have a responsibility to stand up for our
selves. This does not mean that we
should passively accept — or forget —
those actions which have caused past
hurts.
But it does mean that perhaps we
should find the strength to do something
positive about it.

Benefits for gay, lesbian faculty will not be too expensive

THE FEB. 27 DAILY EDITORIAL
supporting a policy of benefits par
ity for gay and lesbian faculty and
staff was a positive development. In clos
ing, the editorial suggested that adminis
trative support would not be coming
soon because of the assumed great cost
of this policy. However, there was no doc
umentation at all for this assumption,
and I question whether it is correct.
Even if we assume that 10 percent of
the total faculty and staff is gay or les
bian, only a small proportion of these
will have registered committed partners
who do not otherwise have retirement or
medical benefits through their own
employment, and a still smaller number
will have children who can benefit from
the tuition grant program.
To these few, the principle of equal

Cost considerations do not meaningfully argue
against a policy of nondiscrimination. What con
crete information we do have suggests that the
increased costs are likely to be slight.

benefits is extremely important, but to
Stanford, the cost increase is a drop in
the bucket. What concrete information
we do have suggests that the increased
costs are likely to be slight.
According to the Subcommittee on
Benefits Parity of OUTAS (the Out at
Stanford), the acting director of the ben
efits administration at Stanford has a
copy of the pioneering investigative work

commissioned by the San Francisco City
Council for Mayor Art Agnos. This trea
tise, titled "The Mayor's Task Force on
Families: Domestic Partners," showed
that medical benefits can be provided
equally to all employees of the city of
San Francisco at about $3 more per
month than what the city employees are
paying currently.
The editorial was right to argue that

the principle of nondiscrimination
should not be suppressed by economic
considerations. But even the cost consid
erations are unlikely to argue against a
policy of nondiscrimination against gay
and lesbian faculty.

Catholicism is truing hard to respond to its critics

Delia ibarra's recent col
umn, "Living in Guilt," captured
my attention for several reasons.
Apart from my own personal affiliation
with Catholicism from within a Mexican-
American context, I have had the oppor
tunity during my time here at Stanford
to pursue my academic interests in that
field, and this exposure has given me
new insights into our experiences in reli
gion.
Thus, while I sympathize with
Ibarra's painful past, I feel it is impor
tant to share some of these insights
which acknowledge that God and
Catholicism encompass more than she
suggests.
There is no doubt in my mind that
guilt has figured prominently in the
Catholic Church's dealing with its peo
ple, and I do not wish to minimize the
experience of guilt which has scarred so
many lives (my own included).

But I do not think it is fair to equate
God with guilt. To say that it is "the
guilt that never leaves you" contradicts
the very act of love that God and Jesus
shared with us. No, I think that we must
recognize the difference between a
human, and therefore fallible, church
and a divine, caring God who chose to
share in our humanity through Jesus.
I do agree with Ibarra about the
strong Catholic presence in our culture
and its "hybrid" nature. Virgilio Eli
zondo, a Catholic theologian, speaks of
this nature as a mestizaje: the process
(which was shamelessly violent at times)
that brought two cultures together in a
painful but life-giving birth, the product
being Mexican and Chicano Catholicism.
The Roman Church, while slow to
respond to our people and our particular
needs, has not ignored us. From the mid
18th century when Pope Benedict XIV
officially recognized Mexico's special

place as a chosen nation because of Our
Lady of Guadalupe's (the Virgin Mary)
apparition nedr Mexico City, to 1983
when the U.S. Catholic bishops recog
nized "the Hispanic community among
us as a blessing from God," the Catholic
Church has gone beyond the Spanish •
subjugation that Ibarra notes.
To be sure, the church's treatment of
our people has left much to be desired.
Pastors have often misunderstood the
richness of our popular religiosity (man
das, altarcitos, bendiciones, com
padrazco, etc.) The hierarchy has made
it difficult for Chicanos to be in
leadership positions, and social justice
has not alleviated much of our people's
poverty.
The response among Latinos has
ranged from becoming less active in
parishes to leaving the Catholic Church
for a Protestant religion.
However, the church is trying to

respond. Taking a lead from the U.S.
bishops who said that "Hispanic Catholi
cism is an outstanding example of how
the Gospel can permeate a culture to its
very roots," church leaders in many com
munities have made a commitment to
our people. Through programs like Cur
sillos, Movimiento Familiar Cristiano,
Comunidades de Base and lay ministry,
our people are claiming a place within
the church.
If we, as a people, want these condi
tions to continue to improve, then we
have a responsibility to stand up for our
selves. This does not mean that we
should passively accept — or forget —
those actions which have caused past
hurts.
But it does mean that perhaps we
should find the strength to do something
positive about it.

Benefits for gay, lesbian faculty will not be too expensive

THE FEB. 27 DAILY EDITORIAL
supporting a policy of benefits par
ity for gay and lesbian faculty and
staff was a positive development. In clos
ing, the editorial suggested that adminis
trative support would not be coming
soon because of the assumed great cost
of this policy. However, there was no doc
umentation at all for this assumption,
and I question whether it is correct.
Even if we assume that 10 percent of
the total faculty and staff is gay or les
bian, only a small proportion of these
will have registered committed partners
who do not otherwise have retirement or
medical benefits through their own
employment, and a still smaller number
will have children who can benefit from
the tuition grant program.
To these few, the principle of equal

Cost considerations do not meaningfully argue
against a policy of nondiscrimination. What con
crete information we do have suggests that the
increased costs are likely to be slight.

benefits is extremely important, but to
Stanford, the cost increase is a drop in
the bucket. What concrete information
we do have suggests that the increased
costs are likely to be slight.
According to the Subcommittee on
Benefits Parity of OUTAS (the Out at
Stanford), the acting director of the ben
efits administration at Stanford has a
copy of the pioneering investigative work

commissioned by the San Francisco City
Council for Mayor Art Agnos. This trea
tise, titled "The Mayor's Task Force on
Families: Domestic Partners," showed
that medical benefits can be provided
equally to all employees of the city of
San Francisco at about $3 more per
month than what the city employees are
paying currently.
The editorial was right to argue that

the principle of nondiscrimination
should not be suppressed by economic
considerations. But even the cost consid
erations are unlikely to argue against a
policy of nondiscrimination against gay
and lesbian faculty.
