# University, IFC review fraternity party fight
## 
### Connie Chang Editorial staff 
In their first collaborative
effort, members of the Office of
Student Activities and the Inter
fraternity Council judicial board
met Tuesday to discuss issues of
party planning and protocol in
light of arrests made at a Theta Xi
party two weeks ago.
At the meeting, each group pre
sented its preliminary report on
the events that took place at the
fraternity house Feb. 22. Final
drafts will be submitted to the
University tomorrow with recom
mendations for disciplinary action
and future prevention. Names of
students involved will be deleted.
The University is expected to
formally respond to the Student
Activities and IFC recommenda
tions early next week.
In its written proposal, the IFC
Judicial Council ordered Theta Xi
to submit a specific party plan
ning policy to the IFC, "at which
time the social suspension will be
lifted and the fraternity placed on
social probation for the remainder
of this academic year." A social
probation would mean the frater
nity has to get Student Activities'
approval before holding any social
functions.
The fraternity has been on sus
pension since Feb. 25 and has not
been allowed to hold any social
events.
Student Activities, the Stan
ford Police and the IFC are work
ing together to gather informa
tion for the ongoing investigation
but each will act separately in
determining corrective measures.
Program and Fraternal Affairs
Adviser Michael Ramsey-Perez,
who is preparing the final Student
Activities report, said the Univer
sity and IFC positions are comple
mentary to each other. The Uni
versity is obligated to make sure
students are safe, and the IFC is
interested in practicing self-regu
lation, he said.
The reports will be submitted
to acting Dean of Student Affairs
Norm Robinson and Assoc. Deans
Michael Jackson and Diana Con
klin. They will decide whether to
punish the fraternity, students
arrested for being drunk in public
and students involved in the fight.
Copies of the reports will also be
sent to University President Don
ald Kennedy.
For the first time, the Univer
sity will apply the new alcohol pol
icy to a group of students. Ram
sey-Perez said letters of repri
mand were sent earlier in the
quarter to individual students
who have been arrested by the
police for alcohol violations.
IFC President Erik Jorgensen,
a senior, said he hopes the Univer
sity doesn't "make an example of
the [Theta Xis] in any way."
But overall, he said the council
has "been really pleased with the
University's cooperation." IFC
delegates were allowed to be pre
sent at interviews Student Activi
ties administrators conducted
with 29 Theta Xi members.
"This is in accordance with
what we wanted to accomplish
and what seemed fair," Jorgensen

said.
The IFC Judicial Council has
been working to be recognized as a
self-regulating body for the Greek
community since its establish
ment at the beginning of this year,
said IFC Vice President Keith
Rabois, head of the five-man
council.
Rabois, a senior, said the coun
cil does not make decisions on
matters that are covered by other
University offices, such as issues
of residential policy. But it deals
"with everything else," he said.
In this case, the council is pri
marily concerned with whether
Theta Xi followed IFC guidelines
and took precautionary measures
in planning the party. Rabois said
the IFC concluded "the actual
fight was an incident that could
have occurred anywhere on cam
pus."
Rabois said the University is
also "looking into sorority respon
sibilities" as part of its investiga
tion. According to the Intersoror
ity Council alcohol policy, sorori
ties that co-sponsor parties where
alcohol is served must assist fra
ternities in party planning.
