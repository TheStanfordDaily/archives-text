# University, IFC review fraternity party fight

In their first collaborative
effort, members of the Office of
Student Activities and the Inter
fraternity Council judicial board
met Tuesday to discuss issues of
party planning and protocol in
light of arrests made at a Theta Xi

probation would mean the frater

approval before holding any social
functions.
The fraternity has been on sus
pension since Feb. 25 and has not
been allowed to hold any social
events.
Student Activities, the Stan
ford Police and the IFC are work

Adviser Michael Ramsey-Perez,
who is preparing the final Student
Activities report, said the Univer

versity is obligated to make sure
students are safe, and the IFC is
interested in practicing self-regu

The reports will be submitted
