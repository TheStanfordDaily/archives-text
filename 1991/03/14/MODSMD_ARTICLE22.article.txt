## Time to teach for Stanford 
### 
AFTER 10 QUARTERS at Stanford,
I am finally taking a course that I
truly don't want to end. When I
filled out the course evaluation this week,
all I could think of was, "More!" Like
most students at the close of a quarter, I
usually seek the light at the end of the
tunnel. This time, the light's burning my
eyes.
The reason is simple: great teaching.
The professor of this particular class is
inspired and inspirational, combines wit
with wisdom, and challenges students to
seek questions as well as answers.
In short, he is what Stanford should
aim to be.
Unfortunately, the consuming drive
for groundbreaking research and the all
important tenure positions prevents
Stanford from being all it can be. We only
hear about the problem when a popular
teacher falls victim to the publish-or-per
ish syndrome, but the impact of a
research focus takes its toll daily on stu
dents who attend "elite" universities like
Stanford.
Stanford is far from alone in deserving
criticism for overemphasis of research at
the expense of quality undergraduate
teaching. The entire academic system fos
ters an inequity between teaching and
research that catches students in the mid
dle — of nowhere.
Many professors appreciate the strong
interrelationship between teaching and
research, as characterized by Dean of
Research Robert Byer in last week's
Daily. Byer explained how his research
benefits from intellectual interaction
with students, just as his lectures are sup

plemented by his research experiences.
Unfortunately, many other professors
view things differently. Some see teaching
as a tiresome chore associated with get
ting paid for doing research at a big-name
university, while others simply do not
have enough interaction with students to
realize the mutual benefits of such give
and take.
In a lecture class of 100 or more stu
dents, how are the professor and the stu
dent supposed to benefit from each
other's contributions? All too often, the
professor never meets more than five to
10 students, and the students must suffer
through the continuously excruciating
exercise of staying awake through dull
lecture periods.
Just in time to change the University's
course for its second century, here comes
Donald Kennedy, Ewart Thomas, and
Donald and Helen Bing to the rescue.
Putting some money where its mouth
is, the University announced $7 million
in new programs to re-emphasize the
proper balance between teaching and
research and provide incentives for those
professors who excel in the art of teach
ing. More importantly, Kennedy has chal
lenged the perennial publish-or-perish
focus underlying tenure decisions, a
sacred process that provides universities
with many great writers and researchers
but few great speakers and teachers.
Of all the initiatives, Kennedy's pro
posal to limit the quantity of research
items to be considered in tenure decisions
may have the most vital impact on the
quality of undergraduate education. By
making research quality more important

than research quantity, and supplement
ing that with a consideration of teaching
ability and teaching innovation, Kennedy
may help change the course of University
instruction forever.
The initiatives are bold steps that will
be successful only if Kennedy gets a little
help from his friends (and enemies) in the
faculty. Some professors have expressed
reservations about the techniques that
will be used to judge teaching quality,
especially the prospect of having col
leagues sitting in on their lectures or sem
inars. For people who make a living
dishing out "constructive criticism" that
is no less subjective, they seem awfully
afraid of getting some themselves.
To be fair, faculty research is vitally
important. But teaching is the foundation
upon which universities were organized.
The major source of university income is
student tuition, and it's time Stanford
undergraduates got their $20,000 worth.
Ask students and most of them will tell
you: We want teachers, not leechers.

Tim Marklein is a senior in political sci
ence who loves Stanford, but nevertheless
sees the need for improvement. His col
umn usually appears every Monday.
