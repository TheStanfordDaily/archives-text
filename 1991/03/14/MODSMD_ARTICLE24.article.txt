## Paul Baer and Hanna Rosin It is shortsighted to forget mistakes, casualties of Iraq war 
### 
PARENTS ATTENDING THE
Founder's Day ceremony this
weekend shuffled by a die-in staged
outside Memorial Auditorium. Disturbed
and annoyed by the paint-smeared stu
dents, their wailing voices meant to rep
resent the plight of Iraqi parents, par
ents asked "Why are they protesting?
The war'B over."
To the Stanford parents and much of
this country, our clean and complete vic
tory over Iraq, because of its total suc
cess, precludes the need for any ques
tioning or challenging of the war, and
probably of many future foreign policy
endeavors of our now battle-tested presi
dent.
In this infectious wave of post-war
satisfaction, anything messy is likely to
be erased. Most notably, the first thing
forgotten is that the war was won at the
high cost of hundreds and thousands of
Iraqi lives.
Our victory is also occasion to erase
from our memory other messy facts. The
first of these is the Vietnam syndrome.
"The specter of Vietnam has been
buried forever in the desert sands of the
Arabian Peninsula," Bush declared. Now
smashed under the ground by the Gulf
war, the Vietnam syndrome can no
longer be used as a "liberal tool" to pre
vent engagement in military operations

overseas. Now that the specter is buried
and forgotten, the United States can
build up a glorious history without a
dark side to drag it down.
Fitting with this trend, the next real
ity victory erased was opposition to the
war. "There is no opposition to this war,"
Bush insisted in his first press confer
ence after declaring a cease fire.
He has, of course, in less confident
moments, acknowledged the existence of
a peace movement, but victory makes it
easier to deny.
There was in fact, by historical stan
dards, a huge peace movement which
arose in opposition to the war, with over
100,000 people marching in Washington,
D.C. and San Francisco, as well as on col
lege campuses across the country.
This opposition was considered
annoying and unpatriotic by many sup
porters of the war. The definition of
unpatriotic and un-American dissent
stretched so far as to include CNN
reporter Peter Arnett's broadcasts from
Baghdad. According to many of the war's
supporters, truths which do not fit into
the plot of the government-sanctioned
story are better left deleted.
We are only now starting to learn how
carefully the storyline was laid out dur
ing the war and what important facts
were omitted. The New York Times

reported in the week after the cease-fire
that Bush planned to wage war from as
early as the week following the Aug. 2
invasion, making it unlikely that any
efforts of diplomacy were taken very
seriously. As time passes and the task of
covering up facts becomes less urgent,
more will emerge to complicate the story
In the meantime, this post-war gloat
ing which suppresses anything that •

might dampen spirits does not bode well
for the future of U.S. foreign policy in
the Middle East and elsewhere.
General Schwarzkopf's initial meeting
with Iraqi military officials was por
trayed as positive and pleasant, ignoring
the hard realities of a post-war settle
ment. The attitude was that now that we
have won the war, we can impose the
solution. Thus, Schwarzkopf's stated

objective at the meeting was: "I'm here
to tell them exactly what we expect them
to do."
For Schwarzkopf, our victory proves
we can continue to intervene in the
region without changing any of the
underlying assumptions of our policies.
In tackling the Arab/Israeli conflict then
we will proceed from these same assump
tions and from the false confidence that
diplomatic gains in the Middle East are
as easily won as the Persian Gulf war.
There are still many of us who believe
there is a great job left to do — that the
motivations behind the war must be
challenged, that the lack of diplomacy
must be questioned as setting a bad
precedent for future conflict resolution,
and that the assumptions of U.S. foreign
policy in general must be seen in a criti
cal light.
We respect everyone's right to form
an opinion about the war and about the
future of foreign policy, but we hope
everyone will take the time to form this
opinion when not under the influence of
the victory.
