## Stanford outruns Houston 93-86 in NIT opener 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
The Stanford men's basketball team
shot down Houston's run-'n'-gun
offense last night, as the Cardinal
runned-'n'-gunned the Cougars over
and over and over again at Maples Pavil
ion.

| Cougars 86

The running came courtesy of a
relentless Stanford fast break, led by
point guard Marcus Lollie and his
career-high 10 assists. The gunning
came courtesy of Kenny Ammann, who
scored a career-high 29 points.
The win, however, came courtesy of
the entire team.
"This was our best team game of the
year," said center Adam Keefe, who had
his customary 22 points. "We were run
ning the break, setting screens and run
ning our offense as well as we ever
have."
"That was one of our better ball
games," agreed Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery, whose team is now 16-13
and headed for the second round of the
NIT either Monday or Tuesday. The site
and opponent will be announced some
time tonight.
"I think Houston's a fine basketball
team," Montgomery said. "It's a great
win for us."
"When we drew Stanford, I said we
were going to the toughest place in the
tournament," coach Pat Foster of Hous
ton, which was led by guards Derrick
Daniels (23 points, six rainbow treys)
and Byron Smith (22 points, four treys
and a lot of ridiculous shots). The
Cougars made a school-record 14 threes
— three of which came in the final
minute to make the score close.
Houston probably should have fig
ured it wasn't going to be their night
even before the game started: Stan
ford's Andrew Vlahov, who has been out
for the last six weeks with an ankle
injury but started practicing again Mon
day, was the first Stanford starter intro
duced.

As he ran on the floor for his first
game since January, the crowd — a full
student section and a good three or four
people from the community — gave Vla
hov an instantaneous standing ovation.
The noise was so loud the next three
players' introductions were completely
drowned out.
"It was really nice," said Vlahov, who
scored eight points and had seven
rebounds in 35 minutes. "It feels good to
get that support from students and the
community."
The Cardinal took that excitement
and built a quick 24-11 lead. Then, after
the Cougars got over their jet lag and
tied it at 26-all, 7-foot-1 center Alvaro
Teheran twisted an ankle and left the
game for good, leaving Keefe a little
more room in the middle to roam. The
result was a 15-5 runnin* run (including
a fantastic, diving Peter Dukes pass on a
break to Vlahov for a layup) that put the
Cardinal up 10 at the half.
Houston got no closer than seven in
the second, despite Smith and Daniels
hitting threes from about half-court
with three or four defenders in their jer
seys.
"Getting off to a good start really
helps us out," Montgomery said. "(The
guys) came out excited, everyone was
moving the ball well and had a lot of
fun."
"They played awfully well," Foster
said. "They played better at both ends of
the floor than we did. They got the loose
balls, outrebounded us, and did all the
things you have to do to win."
Like, say, shoot like crazy: Ammann
was 10-for-15 (5-for-9 from beyond the

three-point arc), and Stanford finished
the game shooting an unbelievable 60
percent.
Or, perhaps, rebound like crazy: The
Cardinal had 37 boards (led by Deshon
Wingate's 13) to Houston's 26.
Or pass beautifully: Led by Lollie,
Stanford had 24 assists, its third-high
est total of the season. "The team
passed really well," said Ammann, who
had five dishes. "Everyone was just
looking for each other all the time."
That might have explained
Ammann's unconscious night, but he
claimed there was another, more impor
tant factor: "Well, I had Drew setting
some great picks for me," Ammann said.
"I think we've got the chemistry back on
the team that we've been missing for
the last six weeks."
Well, maybe. "Oh, he played?" Keefe
grinned. "I guess I noticed: He was all
right, taking his usual bad shots."
"In the middle of the game I turned
to the guys on the bench and said 'It's
like he's never been out of there,' "
Montgomery said. "In terms of his pres
ence and the little things he does, it
made a big difference."
"It's nice to have our workhorse
back," Ammann added.
"(Vlahov) really anchored them,"
Foster said. "He'll be an even bigger fac
tor in the next game."
That next game will most likely be
on Monday night — and most likely will
be on the road, thanks to last night's
anemic crowd. Wherever, whenever and
whoever, however, the Cardinal likes its
chances — sort of. "There's no team we
can't beat," said Ammann, "but there's
no .team we can't lose to either."

his customary 22 points. "We were run
ning the break, setting screens and run
ning our offense as well as we ever
have."
"That was one of our better ball
games," agreed Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery, whose team is now 16-13
and headed for the second round of the
NIT either Monday or Tuesday. The site
and opponent will be announced some
time tonight.
"I think Houston's a fine basketball
team," Montgomery said. "It's a great
win for us."
"When we drew Stanford, I said we
were going to the toughest place in the
tournament," coach Pat Foster of Hous
ton, which was led by guards Derrick
Daniels (23 points, six rainbow treys)
and Byron Smith (22 points, four treys
and a lot of ridiculous shots). The
Cougars made a school-record 14 threes
— three of which came in the final
minute to make the score close.
Houston probably should have fig
ured it wasn't going to be their night
even before the game started: Stan
ford's Andrew Vlahov, who has been out
for the last six weeks with an ankle
injury but started practicing again Mon
day, was the first Stanford starter intro
duced.

As he ran on the floor for his first
game since January, the crowd — a full
student section and a good three or four
people from the community — gave Vla
hov an instantaneous standing ovation.
The noise was so loud the next three
players' introductions were completely
drowned out.
"It was really nice," said Vlahov, who
scored eight points and had seven
rebounds in 35 minutes. "It feels good to
get that support from students and the
community."
The Cardinal took that excitement
and built a quick 24-11 lead. Then, after
the Cougars got over their jet lag and
tied it at 26-all, 7-foot-1 center Alvaro
Teheran twisted an ankle and left the
game for good, leaving Keefe a little
more room in the middle to roam. The
result was a 15-5 runnin* run (including
a fantastic, diving Peter Dukes pass on a
break to Vlahov for a layup) that put the
Cardinal up 10 at the half.
Houston got no closer than seven in
the second, despite Smith and Daniels
hitting threes from about half-court
with three or four defenders in their jer
seys.
"Getting off to a good start really
helps us out," Montgomery said. "(The
guys) came out excited, everyone was
moving the ball well and had a lot of
fun."
"They played awfully well," Foster
said. "They played better at both ends of
the floor than we did. They got the loose
balls, outrebounded us, and did all the
things you have to do to win."
Like, say, shoot like crazy: Ammann
was 10-for-15 (5-for-9 from beyond the

three-point arc), and Stanford finished
the game shooting an unbelievable 60
percent.
Or, perhaps, rebound like crazy: The
Cardinal had 37 boards (led by Deshon
Wingate's 13) to Houston's 26.
Or pass beautifully: Led by Lollie,
Stanford had 24 assists, its third-high
est total of the season. "The team
passed really well," said Ammann, who
had five dishes. "Everyone was just
looking for each other all the time."
That might have explained
Ammann's unconscious night, but he
claimed there was another, more impor
tant factor: "Well, I had Drew setting
some great picks for me," Ammann said.
"I think we've got the chemistry back on
the team that we've been missing for
the last six weeks."
Well, maybe. "Oh, he played?" Keefe
grinned. "I guess I noticed: He was all
right, taking his usual bad shots."
"In the middle of the game I turned
to the guys on the bench and said 'It's
like he's never been out of there,' "
Montgomery said. "In terms of his pres
ence and the little things he does, it
made a big difference."
"It's nice to have our workhorse
back," Ammann added.
"(Vlahov) really anchored them,"
Foster said. "He'll be an even bigger fac
tor in the next game."
That next game will most likely be
on Monday night — and most likely will
be on the road, thanks to last night's
anemic crowd. Wherever, whenever and
whoever, however, the Cardinal likes its
chances — sort of. "There's no team we
can't beat," said Ammann, "but there's
no .team we can't lose to either."

Junior Adam Keefe makes a good post move to beat Houston center Alvaro Teheran
for two points. Keefe finished with 22 points to lead Stanford into the second round of
the NIT with a 93-86 win over the Cougars.
The Stanford men's basketball team
shot down Houston's run-'n'-gun
offense last night, as the Cardinal
runned-'n'-gunned the Cougars over
and over and over again at Maples Pavil
ion.

The running came courtesy of a
relentless Stanford fast break, led by
point guard Marcus Lollie and his
career-high 10 assists. The gunning
came courtesy of Kenny Ammann, who
scored a career-high 29 points.
The win, however, came courtesy of
the entire team.
