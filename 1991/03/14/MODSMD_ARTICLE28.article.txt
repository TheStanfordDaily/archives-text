# No. 11 Cardinal women ready to rebound against Titans
## 
### David Hirning Senior staff writer 
When the Stanford women's basket
ball team was given the No. 2 seed in the
West for the 1991 NCAA tournament, it
not only got a first-round bye, it got a bye
against surprises.
Victimized in past years by bad seed
ings and stacked tournament fields, the
defending national champion Cardinal
finds itself in a regional this year that
looks pleasantly familiar: Stanford has
played five teams in the West Regional
during the regular season. What's more,
it has beaten all five.
In fact, the bracket is set up such that,

if the Cardinal wins its second-round
game this Saturday against Cal State-
Fullerton and the seedings hold up, it will
not see an unfamiliar team until the
NCAA final, Mar. 31 in New Orleans.
"I think it's a really good seeding,"
coach Tara VanDerveer said. "I think it's
to our advantage playing teams we've
already seen. We've seen how we match
up."
Stanford has a 7-1 overall mark
against these clubs: it has beaten top
seeded Georgia, 82-79 in Maples; split
with third-seeded Washington, with each
team winning on the road; downed
fourth-seeded Long Beach State 79-72
away; swept No. 5 seed USC; and topped

No. 8 seed UNLV 81-67 at home.
Because of this, and also in reaction to
a season-ending 87-61 loss to Oregon
State (which may have cost Stanford the
No. 1 seed), VanDerveer has contem
plated a few changes for the Cardinal. She
has plans to juggle her lineup in the wing
positions, seeking more rebounding and
defense.
" The Beavers got all our coaches'
attention," she said. "That was a shock.
We're not going to win in the NCAAs with
the play we saw (in Corvallis)."
Sophomore Angela Taylor has the
inside track at starting at the off guard,
and Ann Adkins, Chris MacMurdo or
Kelly Dougherty could go at the small for
ward, VanDerveer said.
There have also been some strategic
changes. "We've been working on some
things that are going to surprise some
people," said forward Julie Zeilstra.
In addition, the Cardinal suffers from
injuries that make it a different team
than when Stanford last saw some of its
potential opponents. Trisha Stevens
aggravated her knee injury with a month
left in the season and plays with constant
pain; Molly Goodenbour suffered a stress
fracture in her foot and missed most o r
the last two weeks; Zeilstra sat out the
loss to OSU with sore Achilles' tendons.
"I've never had the injury situation
this bad at the end of the season before,"
VanDerveer said. "It's very frustrating to
not have people healthy."
Zeilstra had a cortisone shot Sunday to
relieve the pain, and sat out practice Mon
day and Tuesday. She vowed to he ready
to go in Saturday's game, however.
"I'm definitely playing," Stanford's
leading scorer said. "I don't care what
they say."
The Cardinal's hobbled condition will
be a factor throughout the tournament,
especially should one of the big inside
players — Zeilstra, Stevens and Val Whit
ing — get in foul trouble. This exact sce
nario finished off Stanford against Ore
gon State, a vastly inferior team to many
squads in the West Regional.
The Cardinal will also have to guard
against taking teams lightly or looking
ahead. This will be particularly easy to do
this weekend, because a rematch with
rival Washington waits in the regional
semis if the Huskies win as well. Wash
ington handed Stanford its only loss at
home in the last three years earlier this
season.
Should the Cardinal win that game,
potential matchups with regular-season
foes Georgia and Tennessee could occur
in the regional final and Final Four semis.
But although Stanford players and
VanDerveer have talked of welcoming
another shot at the Huskies, the still
smarting Cardinal is not taking anyone
for granted now. "After just getting beat
by 26, there's no way we could overlook
(Saturday's opponentl," VanDerveer said.
The loss highlighted some weaknesses
that have plagued Stanford all year long:
rebounding and competitiveness. "Last
year's team was extremely competitive,"

VanDerVeer said. "It wasn't more tal
ented this year's squad). The thing
that concerns me is are we tough enough,
are we competitive enough."
Last year, the Cardinal won five tour

nament games and brought home a
national championship to the Farm. In
the next three weeks, VanDerveer will
find out just how this team measures up
to that achievement.

There have also been some strategic
changes. "We've been working on some
things that are going to surprise some
people," said forward Julie Zeilstra.
In addition, the Cardinal suffers from
injuries that make it a different team
than when Stanford last saw some of its
potential opponents. Trisha Stevens
aggravated her knee injury with a month
left in the season and plays with constant
pain; Molly Goodenbour suffered a stress
fracture in her foot and missed most o r
the last two weeks; Zeilstra sat out the
loss to OSU with sore Achilles' tendons.
"I've never had the injury situation
this bad at the end of the season before,"
VanDerveer said. "It's very frustrating to
not have people healthy."
Zeilstra had a cortisone shot Sunday to
relieve the pain, and sat out practice Mon
day and Tuesday. She vowed to he ready
to go in Saturday's game, however.
"I'm definitely playing," Stanford's
leading scorer said. "I don't care what
they say."
The Cardinal's hobbled condition will
be a factor throughout the tournament,
especially should one of the big inside
players — Zeilstra, Stevens and Val Whit
ing — get in foul trouble. This exact sce
nario finished off Stanford against Ore
gon State, a vastly inferior team to many
squads in the West Regional.
The Cardinal will also have to guard
against taking teams lightly or looking
ahead. This will be particularly easy to do
this weekend, because a rematch with
rival Washington waits in the regional
semis if the Huskies win as well. Wash
ington handed Stanford its only loss at
home in the last three years earlier this
season.
Should the Cardinal win that game,
potential matchups with regular-season
foes Georgia and Tennessee could occur
in the regional final and Final Four semis.
But although Stanford players and
VanDerveer have talked of welcoming
another shot at the Huskies, the still
smarting Cardinal is not taking anyone
for granted now. "After just getting beat
by 26, there's no way we could overlook
(Saturday's opponentl," VanDerveer said.
The loss highlighted some weaknesses
that have plagued Stanford all year long:
rebounding and competitiveness. "Last
year's team was extremely competitive,"

VanDerVeer said. "It wasn't more tal
ented this year's squad). The thing
that concerns me is are we tough enough,
are we competitive enough."
Last year, the Cardinal won five tour

nament games and brought home a
national championship to the Farm. In
the next three weeks, VanDerveer will
find out just how this team measures up
to that achievement.
