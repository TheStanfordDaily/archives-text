# Minority fellowship policy unsettles students, faculty
## 
### Connie Chang Editorial staff 
A new graduate fellowship policy that gives
departments money for enrolling minority stu
dents has upset some students and faculty mem
bers concerned with the University's commit
ment to affirmative action.
The policy of the School of Humanities and Sci
ences, implemented two weeks before March
admission decisions were made, gives depart
ments a certain amount of money for every
minority student they admit, said Karlene Dickey,
associate dean of Graduate Administration.
The new policy transfers the cash equivalent of
a two-year fellowship to humanities departments
for each minority student they admit for a regular
four-year stay at Stanford. Science and social-sci
ence departments receive the cash equivalent of a
one-year fellowship for each minority student,
Dickey said.
The money goes into the departments' general
funds.
In addition, the new fellowship program, which
has a smaller budget than the previous policy,
requires each department to meet its own minor
ity enrollment quota rather than having Human
ities and Sciences meet an overall quota, said
Mary Pratt, chair of the Modem Thought and Lit
erature program.
If a department exceeds its quota, it must

enroll fewer minority students the next year,
Pratt said.
The former policy stated that for each fellow
ship granted to a minority applicant, the depart
ment would receive funding for an additional fel
lowship that could be used for a non-minority
applicant.
The new policy is aimed to increase the per
centage of minority students, not their absolute
numbers, which was encouraged by the old policy,
said Dean of Undergraduate Studies Thomas
Wasow. He added that the percentage increase is
"possible only if minority students were admitted
in place of white students."
In an unpublished letter submitted to The
Daily March 7, the Graduate Student Review
Club — representing students in the English
Department and the Comparative Literature and
Modern Thought and Literature programs —
wrote that the new policy "dehumanizes minority
graduate students, assigning them a monetary
value and transforming them into a way [for
departments to acquirel badly needed funds dur
ing a period of budgetary crisis."
While club members prefer the old policy,
which they said "reduced the possibilities of
'reverse racism,' " Wasow said the new policy still
provides an "incentive to departments to act affir
matively."
