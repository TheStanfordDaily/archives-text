# Minority fellowship policy unsettles students, faculty
## 
### Connie Chang Editorial staff 
A new graduate fellowship policy that gives
departments money for enrolling minority stu
dents has upset some students and faculty mem
bers concerned with the University's commit
ment to affirmative action.
The policy of the School of Humanities and Sci
ences, implemented two weeks before March
admission decisions were made, gives depart
ments a certain amount of money for every
minority student they admit, said Karlene Dickey,
associate dean of Graduate Administration.
The new policy transfers the cash equivalent of
a two-year fellowship to humanities departments
for each minority student they admit for a regular
four-year stay at Stanford. Science and social-sci
ence departments receive the cash equivalent of a
one-year fellowship for each minority student,
Dickey said.
The money goes into the departments' general
funds.
In addition, the new fellowship program, which
has a smaller budget than the previous policy,
requires each department to meet its own minor
ity enrollment quota rather than having Human
ities and Sciences meet an overall quota, said
Mary Pratt, chair of the Modem Thought and Lit
erature program.
If a department exceeds its quota, it must

enroll fewer minority students the next year,
Pratt said.
The former policy stated that for each fellow
ship granted to a minority applicant, the depart
ment would receive funding for an additional fel
lowship that could be used for a non-minority
applicant.
The new policy is aimed to increase the per
centage of minority students, not their absolute
numbers, which was encouraged by the old policy,
said Dean of Undergraduate Studies Thomas
Wasow. He added that the percentage increase is
"possible only if minority students were admitted
in place of white students."
In an unpublished letter submitted to The
Daily March 7, the Graduate Student Review
Club — representing students in the English
Department and the Comparative Literature and
Modern Thought and Literature programs —
wrote that the new policy "dehumanizes minority
graduate students, assigning them a monetary
value and transforming them into a way [for
departments to acquirel badly needed funds dur
ing a period of budgetary crisis."
While club members prefer the old policy,
which they said "reduced the possibilities of
'reverse racism,' " Wasow said the new policy still
provides an "incentive to departments to act affir
matively."
Wasow said the old policy was
in place before the Committee on
Graduate Studies set a goal two
years ago to "double minority stu
dent enrollment over five years
without a growing graduate
enrollment."
Ewart Thomas, dean of
Humanities and Sciences, said
the old policy was not always
practiced and that "special deals"

were made with separate depart
ments regarding admittance of
minority graduate students.
Several departments have
tried to increase diversity by hav
ing separate admissions pools for
whites and minorities, which
allows admissions decisions to be
1 made based on the most qualified
applicants in each pool, he added.
But after the announcement of
the new policy, some faculty mem
bers expressed their disapproval
to the school administrators.
The new policy has forced the
j History Department to discon
tinue its practice of having sepa

rate admission pools, according to
Judith Brown, an associate pro
fessor in that department.
She said less money is provided
to fund fellowships for all gradu
ate students under the new policy,
so fewer fellowships can be
offered to minority applicants.
There is no regulation regarding
usage of the funds once a depart
ment receives them.
Brown said separate pools
were important for minority
applicants because "certain
aspects of their record would not
put minority applicants at a com
petitive level" with white stu
dents, citing sporadic undergrad
uate attendance and low test
scores as examples.
She said she has already seen a
change in her department's
admission of minority students
for the coming school year — the
number of minority students
offered fellowships this year is
almost half of last year's number.
Pratt said the new policy has
not affected admission of minor
ity students to her program this
year, but will have an effect on
next year's admissions decisions.
She said that under the old pol
icy, administrators could offer a
certain number of fellowships to
minority students based on how
many students they expected to
accept the fellowships, without
being penalized if the number of
acceptances exceeded the pro
gram's quota.
The new policy penalizes
departments and programs for
"over-enrolling" minority gradu
ate students by having their quo
tas for the following year propor
tionately decreased, she said.
Pratt said under the old policy,
her program used the extra fel
lowships to increase its minority
graduate student enrollment,
which has given it one of the best
records in the school for acting
affirmatively.
