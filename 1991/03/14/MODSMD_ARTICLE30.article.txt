# Stanford humiliated by Beavers
## 
### David Hirning Senior staff writer 
Apparently saving the worst for
last, the tournament-bound Stanford
women's basketball team ended the
regular season with a whimper, suffer
ing a 87-61 humiliation at the hands of
Oregon State in Corvallis last Satur
day.
"We stunk up the joint," Cardinal
coach Tara VanDerveer said. "We were
totally outplayed in every phase of the
game."
The loss was the Cardinal's worst
defeat since it fell 86-59 to Washington
three years ago, and it put a damper on
Stanford's Pacific 10 Conference title
and individual accolades that came on
the trip. The Cardinal had sewn up its
third straight conference crown two
days before with a blowout of Oregon,
and learned earlier in the day that
point guard Sor\ja Henning was chosen
the Pac-10 Player of the Year. Team
mates Julie Zeilstra and Trisha
Stevens also made the All-Pac-10
team.
Unfortunately, Zeilstra could not
celebrate her first all-conference selec
tion by playing against OSU. The
junior forward was forced to miss her
first game of the year to rest her
extremely sore Achilles' tendons.
"It was so frustrating," said Zeil
stra, of watching the loss from the
bench. "I wanted to play, but Tara
thought it was best to rest me."
With the Pac-10 titie already won,
the Cardinal mav have lacked an

incentive against the Beavers. "It was
a combination of Oregon State playing
a championship game and Stanford
going through the motions," Van-
Derveer said.
The title clinching also affected the
decision to rest Zeilstra, VanDerveer
said. Both she and Zeilstra herself
expect the 6-foot-3 power forward to
be ready for Saturday's second-round
NCAA tournament game.
The Beavers were definitely pleased
to hear of Zeilstra's absence, however.
It was she who destroyed OSU earlier
in the year at Maples Pavilion, scoring
a then-personal high 27 points and
leading Stanford with 13 rebounds.
Without its leading scorer, the Car
dinal seemed lost. Stanford shot its
lowest percentage of the season from
both the field (.433) and the line (.588),
and was murdered on the boards by 25
(55-30).
How badly did the Cardinal miss
Zeilstra? The rebounding margin the
first time the teams met was 55-34,
Stanford (a 46-board swing). Most of
the rebounding damage was done by
the Beaver front-line tandem of
Natalia Mattick and Judy Shannon,
who had 16 and 15 boards, respec
tively.
"Our whole team was outre
bounded by two players," VanDerveer
said incredulously.
The pair also finished with 42
points between them; add Margo Eva
shevski's 20 points and the Beavers
had all they needed to beat Stan
ford on the night.
Perhaps the one bright spot for
the Cardinal was Trisha Stevens,
whose knees withstood 37 min
utes of pounding to lead Stanford
with 16 points and also had eight
rebounds. Val Whiting had
another double-double with 12
points and 13 rebounds, but shot
just 4-for-16 from the field.
At first, the Cardinal seemed
to be on its way to a carbon-copy
of Thursday's rout. Stanford
jumped out to an early 12-point
lead and had little trouble stop
ping the OSU attack.
But the Beavers came back
with a vengeance, tying the game
at 19 and then leading the final
eight minutes of the half. After
trailing by only two at half, how
ever, the Cardinal fell behind 51-
42 midway through the second
period.
When Stanford then made an
11-2 run to tie it at 53, the come
back seemed imminent. But with
Whiting on the bench with four
fouls, the bottom fell out: the Car
dinal was outscored 34-8 the rest
of the way.
An ugly ending to an ugly
game for Stanford, which hopes
to rebound this weekend.

and learned earlier in the day that
point guard Sor\ja Henning was chosen
the Pac-10 Player of the Year. Team
mates Julie Zeilstra and Trisha
Stevens also made the All-Pac-10
team.
Unfortunately, Zeilstra could not
celebrate her first all-conference selec
tion by playing against OSU. The
junior forward was forced to miss her
first game of the year to rest her
extremely sore Achilles' tendons.
"It was so frustrating," said Zeil
stra, of watching the loss from the
bench. "I wanted to play, but Tara
thought it was best to rest me."
With the Pac-10 titie already won,
the Cardinal mav have lacked an

incentive against the Beavers. "It was
a combination of Oregon State playing
a championship game and Stanford
going through the motions," Van-
Derveer said.
The title clinching also affected the
decision to rest Zeilstra, VanDerveer
said. Both she and Zeilstra herself
expect the 6-foot-3 power forward to
be ready for Saturday's second-round
NCAA tournament game.
The Beavers were definitely pleased
to hear of Zeilstra's absence, however.
It was she who destroyed OSU earlier
in the year at Maples Pavilion, scoring
a then-personal high 27 points and
leading Stanford with 13 rebounds.
Without its leading scorer, the Car
dinal seemed lost. Stanford shot its
lowest percentage of the season from
both the field (.433) and the line (.588),
and was murdered on the boards by 25
(55-30).
How badly did the Cardinal miss
Zeilstra? The rebounding margin the
first time the teams met was 55-34,
Stanford (a 46-board swing). Most of
the rebounding damage was done by
the Beaver front-line tandem of
Natalia Mattick and Judy Shannon,
who had 16 and 15 boards, respec
tively.
"Our whole team was outre
bounded by two players," VanDerveer
said incredulously.
The pair also finished with 42
points between them; add Margo Eva
shevski's 20 points and the Beavers
had all they needed to beat Stan
ford on the night.
Perhaps the one bright spot for
the Cardinal was Trisha Stevens,
whose knees withstood 37 min
utes of pounding to lead Stanford
with 16 points and also had eight
rebounds. Val Whiting had
another double-double with 12
points and 13 rebounds, but shot
just 4-for-16 from the field.
At first, the Cardinal seemed
to be on its way to a carbon-copy
of Thursday's rout. Stanford
jumped out to an early 12-point
lead and had little trouble stop
ping the OSU attack.
But the Beavers came back
with a vengeance, tying the game
at 19 and then leading the final
eight minutes of the half. After
trailing by only two at half, how
ever, the Cardinal fell behind 51-
42 midway through the second
period.
When Stanford then made an
11-2 run to tie it at 53, the come
back seemed imminent. But with
Whiting on the bench with four
fouls, the bottom fell out: the Car
dinal was outscored 34-8 the rest
of the way.
An ugly ending to an ugly
game for Stanford, which hopes
to rebound this weekend.

Apparently saving the worst for
last, the tournament-bound Stanford
women's basketball team ended the
regular season with a whimper, suffer
ing a 87-61 humiliation at the hands of
Oregon State in Corvallis last Satur
day.
"We stunk up the joint," Cardinal
coach Tara VanDerveer said. "We were
totally outplayed in every phase of the
game."
The loss was the Cardinal's worst
defeat since it fell 86-59 to Washington
three years ago, and it put a damper on
Stanford's Pacific 10 Conference title
and individual accolades that came on
the trip. The Cardinal had sewn up its
third straight conference crown two
days before with a blowout of Oregon,
and learned earlier in the day that
point guard Sor\ja Henning was chosen
the Pac-10 Player of the Year. Team
mates Julie Zeilstra and Trisha
Stevens also made the All-Pac-10
team.
Unfortunately, Zeilstra could not
