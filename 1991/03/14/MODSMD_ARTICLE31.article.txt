# Trojans sweep baseball in L.A.
## 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES - Friday
night was Comedy Night at
Southern California's Dedeaux
Field, but by Sunday nobody on
Stanford's previously top
ranked baseball team was
laughing or even cracking a
smile.
Fans were invited to tell
their favorite jokes over the
public address between innings
Friday. The jokes were lame.
For instance, what do Fred
Flintstone and Saddam Hus
sein have in common? They
both look out the window and
see rubble.
But if bad comedy makes
you uncomfortable, be thank
ful you weren't in Southern
California for the baseball
games.
Unfortunately for Stanford,
the Friday night jokes were the
highlight of a three-game
series sweep in which the Car
dinal was laughed out of the
park by previous No. 6 USC, 9-
5, 11-5 and 9-5. While the Tro
jans giggled their way into first
place in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence, Stanford's season took a
sudden nosedive.
"It's critical. Anytime you
get swept it's critical, but we're
not beaten emotionally," said
Stanford coach Mark Mar
quess, who apparently couldn't
watch anymore and was ejected
in the ninth inning of Sunday's
loss after hopelessly arguing a
strike call. "You know, the
physical mistakes, they'll hap
pen. But this weekend we
walked an awful lot of their
batters, and we made a lot of
errors, which is something we
had been very good about ear
lier."
Stanford (17-7 overall, 4-3
in league play) has now lost
four games in a row and slipped
into a tie for second in the
Pacific 10 Conference South
ern Division with UCLA,
behind USC. The Cardinal, a
unanimous No. 1 selection last
week, slipped to No. 4 in the
Baseball America poll and No.
5 in the Collegiate Baseball
rankings because of the sweep.
Stanford will have plenty of

time to think about its four
game slide. The Cardinal
doesn't play its next game until
Saturday, March 23, at Califor
nia, then returns home March
24 for a 1 p.m. game against
the Bears. March 27 Stanford
travels to St. Mary's, then
completes the spring break sea
son March 29-31 at the Oscar
Meyer Baseball Classic in Min
neapolis.
"I hope it will be good for
us," said right fielder Steve
Solomon. "It will give us a
chance to think about what we
have to do. The last handful of
games we haven't been playing
very well."
All the infield starters had
errors except catcher Troy
Tallman. Stanford, which had
only 18 errors in 21 games
coming into the series, was
credited with six in three
games, despite some generous
scoring decisions.
"The really big thing that
hurts are the errors. We missed
ground balls and fly balls. Take
me for example," said
Solomon, who let a Jeff Cirillo
triple dribble off his glove in
Sunday's loss. "Things don't
get better for you when you
allow the other team four outs
in an inning."
The Trojans drubbed Stan
ford in every outing and out
played the Cardinal in every
phase of the game: runs 29-15,
hits 35-22, errors 5-6, and most
importantly walks, 19-12.
In the opener, USC teed off
on Stanford starter John Reid
for nine runs, scoring three
run bursts in the fourth and
seventh innings with the help
of a season-high three Stanford
errors. The Trojans scored
three unearned runs, taking a
commanding 9-3 lead before
Stanford scored twice in the
eighth inning.
The woes continued on Sat
urday, as Willie Adams, Aaron
Dorlarque and Jamie Sepeda
combined for 11 walks and 11
runs in an 11-5 Stanford loss.
The Cardinal scored four runs
in the first inning with the
assistance of a bases-loaded
wild pitch that scored all three
runners.
But Stanford managed only
four hits after the first inning
while the Trojans pounded out an
11-run, 13-hit attack, aided by
more critical Stanford walks, wild
pitches and timely mistakes.
Sunday's rubber game was a
fitting finale for the Trojan domi
nation. Stanford scored three
unearned runs to tie the game 5-5
in the fourth, but Ryan Turner's
double was Stanford's only hit for
the rest of the game.
Meanwhile, USC knocked out
Stanford starter Scott Weiss with
three runs in the seventh. He was
relieved by John Lynch, who in a
stretch of three batters had two
walks, an error, a wild pitch, and
allowed two runs to score.
Lynch's outing typified the Stan
ford performance for the week
end.

"Too many guys are falling
behind and not being aggressive,"
said Tallman. "J.R. (Reid) strug
gled on Friday and that kind of
set the tone for the weekend."
Marquess juggled the lineup to
try to spark some offense, but the
result was no different from the
previous two defeats. Second
baseman Chris Kemper moved
from the ninth spot in the order
to lead-off, Tallman batted second
and Solomon moved to fifth. Tony
Detter started for David Holbrook
as the designated hitter.
"We tried to mix up the lineup,
but it still didn't do the job," said
Solomon. "Now we have two
weeks off and we'll be dwelling on
this series."
Sophomore right-hander Brian
Sackinsky, pitching in only his
second outing of the season Sun
day after being sidelined by ten
dinitis, was the most — and
almost only — effective pitcher in
three games. Sackinsky allowed
one hit and no runs in one and
two-thirds innings and displayed

good control.
USC (20-7, 8-1) climbed to No.
2 in this week's Baseball America
poll, but more importantly has a
three-game lead over defending
Six-Pac champ Stanford in the
league standings.
"This was a very big series for
us," said Trojan coach Mike Gille
spie. "We realize we're only a
third of the way through the sea
son, but if you're going to be a
contender, you have to deal with
Stanford, no question about it.
This was just fabulous for our
chances."
"Among the things that Stan
ford is awesome about is good
defense," continued Gillespie.
"This just didn't seem to be
them."
With 23 games to play, the Car
dinal is tied with UCLA (5-4) for
second, while llth-ranked Ari
zona State (18-11, 5-5) is just one
game back. California (3-6) and
Arizona (1-6) round out the Six-
Pac.

of a season-high three Stanford
errors. The Trojans scored
three unearned runs, taking a
commanding 9-3 lead before
Stanford scored twice in the
eighth inning.
The woes continued on Sat
urday, as Willie Adams, Aaron
Dorlarque and Jamie Sepeda
combined for 11 walks and 11
runs in an 11-5 Stanford loss.
The Cardinal scored four runs
in the first inning with the
assistance of a bases-loaded
wild pitch that scored all three
runners.
But Stanford managed only
four hits after the first inning
while the Trojans pounded out an
11-run, 13-hit attack, aided by
more critical Stanford walks, wild
pitches and timely mistakes.
Sunday's rubber game was a
fitting finale for the Trojan domi
nation. Stanford scored three
unearned runs to tie the game 5-5
in the fourth, but Ryan Turner's
double was Stanford's only hit for
the rest of the game.
Meanwhile, USC knocked out
Stanford starter Scott Weiss with
three runs in the seventh. He was
relieved by John Lynch, who in a
stretch of three batters had two
walks, an error, a wild pitch, and
allowed two runs to score.
Lynch's outing typified the Stan
ford performance for the week
end.

"Too many guys are falling
behind and not being aggressive,"
said Tallman. "J.R. (Reid) strug
gled on Friday and that kind of
set the tone for the weekend."
Marquess juggled the lineup to
try to spark some offense, but the
result was no different from the
previous two defeats. Second
baseman Chris Kemper moved
from the ninth spot in the order
to lead-off, Tallman batted second
and Solomon moved to fifth. Tony
Detter started for David Holbrook
as the designated hitter.
"We tried to mix up the lineup,
but it still didn't do the job," said
Solomon. "Now we have two
weeks off and we'll be dwelling on
this series."
Sophomore right-hander Brian
Sackinsky, pitching in only his
second outing of the season Sun
day after being sidelined by ten
dinitis, was the most — and
almost only — effective pitcher in
three games. Sackinsky allowed
one hit and no runs in one and
two-thirds innings and displayed

good control.
USC (20-7, 8-1) climbed to No.
2 in this week's Baseball America
poll, but more importantly has a
three-game lead over defending
Six-Pac champ Stanford in the
league standings.
"This was a very big series for
us," said Trojan coach Mike Gille
spie. "We realize we're only a
third of the way through the sea
son, but if you're going to be a
contender, you have to deal with
Stanford, no question about it.
This was just fabulous for our
chances."
"Among the things that Stan
ford is awesome about is good
defense," continued Gillespie.
"This just didn't seem to be
them."
With 23 games to play, the Car
dinal is tied with UCLA (5-4) for
second, while llth-ranked Ari
zona State (18-11, 5-5) is just one
game back. California (3-6) and
Arizona (1-6) round out the Six-
Pac.

LOS ANGELES - Friday
night was Comedy Night at
Southern California's Dedeaux
Field, but by Sunday nobody on
Stanford's previously top
ranked baseball team was
laughing or even cracking a
smile.
Fans were invited to tell
their favorite jokes over the
public address between innings
Friday. The jokes were lame.
For instance, what do Fred
Flintstone and Saddam Hus
sein have in common? They
both look out the window and
see rubble.
But if bad comedy makes
you uncomfortable, be thank
ful you weren't in Southern
California for the baseball
games.
Unfortunately for Stanford,
the Friday night jokes were the
highlight of a three-game
series sweep in which the Car
dinal was laughed out of the
park by previous No. 6 USC, 9-
5, 11-5 and 9-5. While the Tro
jans giggled their way into first
place in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence, Stanford's season took a
sudden nosedive.
"It's critical. Anytime you
get swept it's critical, but we're
not beaten emotionally," said
Stanford coach Mark Mar
quess, who apparently couldn't
watch anymore and was ejected
in the ninth inning of Sunday's
loss after hopelessly arguing a
strike call. "You know, the
physical mistakes, they'll hap
pen. But this weekend we
walked an awful lot of their
batters, and we made a lot of
errors, which is something we
had been very good about ear
lier."
Stanford (17-7 overall, 4-3
in league play) has now lost
four games in a row and slipped
into a tie for second in the
Pacific 10 Conference South
ern Division with UCLA,
behind USC. The Cardinal, a
unanimous No. 1 selection last
week, slipped to No. 4 in the
Baseball America poll and No.
5 in the Collegiate Baseball
rankings because of the sweep.
Stanford will have plenty of

time to think about its four
game slide. The Cardinal
doesn't play its next game until
Saturday, March 23, at Califor
nia, then returns home March
24 for a 1 p.m. game against
the Bears. March 27 Stanford
travels to St. Mary's, then
completes the spring break sea
son March 29-31 at the Oscar
Meyer Baseball Classic in Min
neapolis.
"I hope it will be good for
us," said right fielder Steve
Solomon. "It will give us a
chance to think about what we
have to do. The last handful of
games we haven't been playing
very well."
All the infield starters had
errors except catcher Troy
Tallman. Stanford, which had
only 18 errors in 21 games
coming into the series, was
credited with six in three
games, despite some generous
scoring decisions.
"The really big thing that
hurts are the errors. We missed
ground balls and fly balls. Take
me for example," said
Solomon, who let a Jeff Cirillo
triple dribble off his glove in
Sunday's loss. "Things don't
get better for you when you
allow the other team four outs
in an inning."
The Trojans drubbed Stan
ford in every outing and out
played the Cardinal in every
phase of the game: runs 29-15,
hits 35-22, errors 5-6, and most
importantly walks, 19-12.
In the opener, USC teed off
on Stanford starter John Reid
for nine runs, scoring three
run bursts in the fourth and
seventh innings with the help
of a season-high three Stanford
errors. The Trojans scored
three unearned runs, taking a
commanding 9-3 lead before
Stanford scored twice in the
eighth inning.
The woes continued on Sat
urday, as Willie Adams, Aaron
Dorlarque and Jamie Sepeda
combined for 11 walks and 11
runs in an 11-5 Stanford loss.

runners.
But Stanford managed only

more critical Stanford walks, wild
pitches and timely mistakes.

LOS ANGELES - Friday
night was Comedy Night at
Southern California's Dedeaux
Field, but by Sunday nobody on
Stanford's previously top
ranked baseball team was
laughing or even cracking a
smile.
Fans were invited to tell
their favorite jokes over the
public address between innings
Friday. The jokes were lame.
For instance, what do Fred
Flintstone and Saddam Hus
sein have in common? They
both look out the window and
see rubble.
But if bad comedy makes
you uncomfortable, be thank
ful you weren't in Southern
California for the baseball
games.
Unfortunately for Stanford,
the Friday night jokes were the
highlight of a three-game
series sweep in which the Car
dinal was laughed out of the
park by previous No. 6 USC, 9-
5, 11-5 and 9-5. While the Tro
jans giggled their way into first
place in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence, Stanford's season took a
sudden nosedive.
"It's critical. Anytime you
get swept it's critical, but we're
not beaten emotionally," said
Stanford coach Mark Mar
quess, who apparently couldn't
watch anymore and was ejected
in the ninth inning of Sunday's
loss after hopelessly arguing a
strike call. "You know, the
physical mistakes, they'll hap
pen. But this weekend we
walked an awful lot of their
batters, and we made a lot of
errors, which is something we
had been very good about ear
lier."
Stanford (17-7 overall, 4-3
in league play) has now lost
four games in a row and slipped
into a tie for second in the
Pacific 10 Conference South
ern Division with UCLA,
behind USC. The Cardinal, a
unanimous No. 1 selection last
week, slipped to No. 4 in the
Baseball America poll and No.
5 in the Collegiate Baseball
rankings because of the sweep.
Stanford will have plenty of

time to think about its four
game slide. The Cardinal
doesn't play its next game until
Saturday, March 23, at Califor
nia, then returns home March
24 for a 1 p.m. game against
the Bears. March 27 Stanford
travels to St. Mary's, then
completes the spring break sea
son March 29-31 at the Oscar
Meyer Baseball Classic in Min
neapolis.
"I hope it will be good for
us," said right fielder Steve
Solomon. "It will give us a
chance to think about what we
have to do. The last handful of
games we haven't been playing
very well."
All the infield starters had
errors except catcher Troy
Tallman. Stanford, which had
only 18 errors in 21 games
coming into the series, was
credited with six in three
games, despite some generous
scoring decisions.
"The really big thing that
hurts are the errors. We missed
ground balls and fly balls. Take
me for example," said
Solomon, who let a Jeff Cirillo
triple dribble off his glove in
Sunday's loss. "Things don't
get better for you when you
allow the other team four outs
in an inning."
The Trojans drubbed Stan
ford in every outing and out
played the Cardinal in every
phase of the game: runs 29-15,
hits 35-22, errors 5-6, and most
importantly walks, 19-12.
In the opener, USC teed off
on Stanford starter John Reid
for nine runs, scoring three
run bursts in the fourth and
seventh innings with the help
of a season-high three Stanford
errors. The Trojans scored
three unearned runs, taking a
commanding 9-3 lead before
Stanford scored twice in the
eighth inning.
The woes continued on Sat
urday, as Willie Adams, Aaron
Dorlarque and Jamie Sepeda
combined for 11 walks and 11
runs in an 11-5 Stanford loss.
The Cardinal scored four runs
in the first inning with the
assistance of a bases-loaded
wild pitch that scored all three
runners.
But Stanford managed only
four hits after the first inning
while the Trojans pounded out an
11-run, 13-hit attack, aided by
more critical Stanford walks, wild
pitches and timely mistakes.
Sunday's rubber game was a
fitting finale for the Trojan domi
nation. Stanford scored three
unearned runs to tie the game 5-5
in the fourth, but Ryan Turner's
double was Stanford's only hit for
the rest of the game.
Meanwhile, USC knocked out
Stanford starter Scott Weiss with
three runs in the seventh. He was
relieved by John Lynch, who in a
stretch of three batters had two
walks, an error, a wild pitch, and
allowed two runs to score.
Lynch's outing typified the Stan
ford performance for the week
end.

"Too many guys are falling
behind and not being aggressive,"
said Tallman. "J.R. (Reid) strug
gled on Friday and that kind of
set the tone for the weekend."
Marquess juggled the lineup to
try to spark some offense, but the
result was no different from the
previous two defeats. Second
baseman Chris Kemper moved
from the ninth spot in the order
to lead-off, Tallman batted second
and Solomon moved to fifth. Tony
Detter started for David Holbrook
as the designated hitter.
"We tried to mix up the lineup,
but it still didn't do the job," said
Solomon. "Now we have two
weeks off and we'll be dwelling on
this series."
Sophomore right-hander Brian
Sackinsky, pitching in only his
second outing of the season Sun
day after being sidelined by ten
dinitis, was the most — and
almost only — effective pitcher in
three games. Sackinsky allowed
one hit and no runs in one and
two-thirds innings and displayed

good control.
USC (20-7, 8-1) climbed to No.
2 in this week's Baseball America
poll, but more importantly has a
three-game lead over defending
Six-Pac champ Stanford in the
league standings.
"This was a very big series for
us," said Trojan coach Mike Gille
spie. "We realize we're only a
third of the way through the sea
son, but if you're going to be a
contender, you have to deal with
Stanford, no question about it.
This was just fabulous for our
chances."
"Among the things that Stan
ford is awesome about is good
defense," continued Gillespie.
"This just didn't seem to be
them."
With 23 games to play, the Car
dinal is tied with UCLA (5-4) for
second, while llth-ranked Ari
zona State (18-11, 5-5) is just one
game back. California (3-6) and
Arizona (1-6) round out the Six-
Pac.
