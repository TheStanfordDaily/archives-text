# Trojans sweep baseball in L.A.

LOS ANGELES - Friday
night was Comedy Night at
Southern California's Dedeaux
Field, but by Sunday nobody on
Stanford's previously top
ranked baseball team was
laughing or even cracking a
smile.
Fans were invited to tell
their favorite jokes over the
public address between innings
Friday. The jokes were lame.
For instance, what do Fred
Flintstone and Saddam Hus
sein have in common? They
both look out the window and
see rubble.
But if bad comedy makes
you uncomfortable, be thank
ful you weren't in Southern
California for the baseball
games.
Unfortunately for Stanford,
the Friday night jokes were the
highlight of a three-game
series sweep in which the Car
dinal was laughed out of the
park by previous No. 6 USC, 9-
5, 11-5 and 9-5. While the Tro
jans giggled their way into first
place in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence, Stanford's season took a
sudden nosedive.
"It's critical. Anytime you
get swept it's critical, but we're
not beaten emotionally," said
Stanford coach Mark Mar
quess, who apparently couldn't
watch anymore and was ejected
in the ninth inning of Sunday's
loss after hopelessly arguing a
strike call. "You know, the
physical mistakes, they'll hap
pen. But this weekend we
walked an awful lot of their
batters, and we made a lot of
errors, which is something we
had been very good about ear
lier."
Stanford (17-7 overall, 4-3
in league play) has now lost
four games in a row and slipped
into a tie for second in the
Pacific 10 Conference South
ern Division with UCLA,
behind USC. The Cardinal, a
unanimous No. 1 selection last
week, slipped to No. 4 in the
Baseball America poll and No.
5 in the Collegiate Baseball
rankings because of the sweep.
Stanford will have plenty of

time to think about its four
game slide. The Cardinal
doesn't play its next game until
Saturday, March 23, at Califor
nia, then returns home March
24 for a 1 p.m. game against
the Bears. March 27 Stanford
travels to St. Mary's, then
completes the spring break sea
son March 29-31 at the Oscar
Meyer Baseball Classic in Min
neapolis.
"I hope it will be good for
us," said right fielder Steve
Solomon. "It will give us a
chance to think about what we
have to do. The last handful of
games we haven't been playing
very well."
All the infield starters had
errors except catcher Troy
Tallman. Stanford, which had
only 18 errors in 21 games
coming into the series, was
credited with six in three
games, despite some generous
scoring decisions.
"The really big thing that
hurts are the errors. We missed
ground balls and fly balls. Take
me for example," said
Solomon, who let a Jeff Cirillo
triple dribble off his glove in
Sunday's loss. "Things don't
get better for you when you
allow the other team four outs
in an inning."
The Trojans drubbed Stan
ford in every outing and out
played the Cardinal in every
phase of the game: runs 29-15,
hits 35-22, errors 5-6, and most
importantly walks, 19-12.
In the opener, USC teed off
on Stanford starter John Reid
for nine runs, scoring three
run bursts in the fourth and
seventh innings with the help
of a season-high three Stanford
errors. The Trojans scored
three unearned runs, taking a
commanding 9-3 lead before
Stanford scored twice in the
eighth inning.
The woes continued on Sat
urday, as Willie Adams, Aaron
Dorlarque and Jamie Sepeda
combined for 11 walks and 11
runs in an 11-5 Stanford loss.
The Cardinal scored four runs
in the first inning with the
assistance of a bases-loaded
wild pitch that scored all three
