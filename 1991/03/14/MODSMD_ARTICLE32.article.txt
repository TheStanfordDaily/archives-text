# Griglione hoping to make NCAAs fun
## Senior wants to end her collegiate career on a winning note at NCAAs 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Going into her senior season on
the Cardinal women's swim team,
Michelle Griglione has one simple
goal. True, she does really want
the Cardinal to win the NCAA
title. And finishing high in her
events would also be nice.
But on the whole, Griglione
just wants to have some fun.
Not to say that she isn't work
ing as hard as her teammates,
because she is. Or that she doesn't
care how NCAAs turn out,
because she does. It's just that
after her junior season, fun is high
on her list of priorities.
"I've been really happy,"
Griglione says of this year. "I
think that was my goal for the
year: to be happy. After last year I
wasn't happy."
Griglione was quite far from
happy, in fact. As a sophomore she
won an NCAA title in the 400-
yard individual medley, recorded
runner-up finishes in the 200 but
terfly and the 200 IM and led the
Cardinal to the NCAA champi
onship.
Last year, however, things
weren't as fun. Her individual
results were not as good and Stan
ford was edged by a scant 9.5
points for the NCAA crown. Even
though she stopped out all of
1987-88 to train for the Olympics
and missed making the team by

.25 seconds, last year was the
toughest for her to take.
"I thought I swam absolutely
horribly," she says. "Period. I
think what made it worse was I
was putting more time into it and
withstanding more pain than I
ever had. To swim the way I did
made it 10 times worse.
"The team situation didn't
really help either. It seemed like
everything combined to make it
the worst year possible. I think it
was worse than the Olympic year.
That year I was swimming
respectably, I just didn't luck out."
Not that she really knows why it
was so bad.
"I've had a lot of theories," she
says, "but I think in the past year
I've become less and less sure.
One of my theories was that I was
doing a lot of distance training,
and I don't think that did much
for me. It didn't do much for my
psyche either.
"At some point I literally hated
the workouts, and I'm not a per
son who hates workouts. . . .
There was no possible way I could
be positive about some of those
sets, and that's bad. Believe me, I
tried to be positive."
But that year is definitely

behind her. Now she is doing less
distance training, her results have
been better and, yes, she is hap
pier.
"This year it's been a lot
shorter," she says. "I've been
doing a lot.of stroke work. One
day I'll work on my butterfly and
then the next I'll work on my
backstroke. And I did a lot more
sprinting throughout the year.. ..
I've had a really, really good time
this year, which is a nice way to
leave."
And she has also been very suc
cessful. In helping the Cardinal to
a 10-0 dual-meet record, she has
won 100 freestyle, 200 freestyle,
100 backstroke, 200 backstroke,
200 butterfly and 200 IM races at
one point or another. She grabbed
fifth in the 200 IM and completed
a Cardinal sweep by finishing
third at the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships two weeks ago.
Part of the reason is her mental
state. In addition to feeling more
comfortable with her training pro
gram, she is putting a lot less
pressure on herself. "I had pres
sure Olympic year. Then I pres
sured myself into going so hard
sophomore year," she says. "So I

had a lot of pressure then, but it
all sort of popped after my junior
year. I thought it would be nice to
be able to relax and not put any
demands on.
"I didn't lower my expecta
tions, but I just think I was a little
more relaxed and wasn't as
stressed if things didn't go my
way from day to day or from week
end to weekend."
But, going into the NCAA
Championships, which begin a
week from today in Indianapolis,
she has no idea what to expect. "If
I were a freshman, yeah, I'd say
how I'm going to do great. But
after all I've been through. . . .
I'm not even going to touch that
question," she says.
"I don't know what to expect
anymore. I think 1 just want to
improve on last year. That's what
I want to do. I think the only real
goal I have for nationals is for us
to win, and I think I'm going to
have to meet some level of expec
tation to achieve that."
But win or lose, Griglione will
be having fun. "I just really, really
enjoyed my four years here, and I
especially enjoyed my time with
the girls here," she says.
It looks like she's met her goal.
