# Swimming at NCAAs
## 
### 
WHEN - March 21-23 at the IU
Natatorium in Indianapolis.
SWIMMING UPDATE - Stanford
and Texas are the class of the
field. Again. The Cardinal beat
the Lady Longhorns 158.5-141.5
in a dual meet last month, but
NCAAs should be a war. Key
races: Lori Heisick (Stanford)
versus Dorsey Tierney (Texas)
in the breaststrokes, the Cardi
nal backstrokers versus the field
and the performance of the
relays. Stanford needs to win
the medley relays and has to
stay close to Texas in the sprint
freestyle relays.
DIVING UPDATE - The Cardinal s
Eileen Richetelli just might be
the nation's best. Kristin Jen
sen and Melisa Kuller will at
tempt to join her by qualifying
at the zone meet this weekend
in Tempe, Ariz. If one of them
qualifies, and that is very likely,
Stanford's divers should be able
to outscore Texas'.
