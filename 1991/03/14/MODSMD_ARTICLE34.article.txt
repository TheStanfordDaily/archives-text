# Men's swim squad surprises all with Pac-10 victory
## 
### Amy Wusterbarth Staff writer 
I he men s swimming team left the competition
floundering high and dry in a state of shock last
weekend at the Pacific-10 Conference Champi
onships in Long Beach, Calif. The Cardinal left
everyone in its wake with a score of 877.5 while
UCLA placed second with 561.5. With the Stanford
victory (after a miserable 2-6 dual-meet season)
came a new Pac-10 record for most consecutive team
championships.
The Cardinal has won Pac-lOs for the last 10
years under the tutelage of coach Skip Kenney. "This

win was really special because it was totally unex
pected, it set a new Pac-10 record and we had a very
young team who gained and showed a lot of matu
rity," said Kenney
"It was the best swim meet that I've ever coached
from top to bottom," said Kenney. "I was witness to
swimming. . . that in 25 years of coaching I've never
seen."
To many, like Kenney, the meet was full of sur
prises. Coming in with the worst dual-meet record of
his Stanford career, he had his doubts. "I was con
cerned that we hadn't done enough right during the
dual-meet season," said Kenney.
Throughout the season people doubted and ques

tioned, but the Stanford swimmers never lost faith.
"Losing never affected us much because we still
believed, we still focused on (Pac-10s]," said fresh
man Brian Retterer.
Nevertheless, they astonished others. "If we'd
betted, you'd own my car, my house. . . chuckled
Kenney. "It was an unbelievable group effort, espe
cially when you look back at what they've overcome
this year. Not one person missed. That's incredible in
any sport. I've never had so many pleasant sur
prises."
"It started last week with the divers. Darryl
(Sagel, a freshman) dove over his head, maybe it was
a sign of things to come." Sagel placed sixth, seventh
and eighth on the one-meter, three-meter and plat
form. Teammate Brad Wightman captured third,
fourth and seventh, respectively.
Retterer's performance last weekend was one of
the biggest surprises. According to teammate Derek
Weatherford, "Brian swam out of his mind." His
time of 1:45.15 in the 200-yard backstroke was the
fourth fastest American time in history.
Kenney said Retterer's race was, "one of those
things you can coach but never be a part of. . . . He's
no longer an age-group swimmer, he's an Olympic
contender — all in one little meet. I've never seen
anybody improve that much."
In the 200 backstroke Retterer did the first 150
yards under American-record pace. With these phe
nomenal performances, the freshman from Nevada
even motivated world champion Jeff Rouse.
"Jeff knew that Brian had been going out so fast,
so he wanted to go all out too," said Kenney. Even
swimming unshaved with a broken wrist, Rouse fin
ished only .2 seconds off of his last year's NCAA-win
ning time and broke a meet record in the 100 back
stroke.
Retterer was relaxed about his meet of a lifetime.
"Going to Pac-lOs for the first time, I expected to be
overwhelmed. But it was just the same guys as dur
ing the season. You look over on the blocks and say
'Hey I beat you in duals so I'm sure not going to let
you beat me here.'
"Everyone swam really fast and it pumped me
up," said Retterer. It seemed to be another fresh
man, Trip Zedlitz who set the mood for the meet.
"Trip swam so fast and so inspiring. Everyone
saw that and we were all so excited," said Retterer.

Zedlitz dropped over two seconds off of his 200 indi
vidual medley and also had best times in the 100 and
200 backstroke.
"It's been an intense year — a new program, new
ideas. Throughout the year I swam fairly well but I
knew I could do better. It's encouraging to see it all
come together," said Zedlitz.
Zedlitz was another big surprise for Kenney. "It
was just amazing, he was within half a finger of
being a Pac-10 Champion — this kid from Oklahoma
City!"
The high-speed momentum, which began with
Zedlitz, carried throughout the three-day competi
tion. "I'd have trouble sleeping at night, waiting to
see them swim again," said Kenney.
If there could be a meet highlight, it would have to
be the 100 and 200 backstrokes. In addition to Ret
terer and Zedlitz's personal bests, Weatherford had a
lifetime best. This is especially notable because
unlike Retterer and Zedlitz, Weatherford has not
shaved yet.
In the finals of the 200 backstroke, five of the six
competitors were Cardinal men. Kenney acknowl
edges veteran Rouse as the driving force behind the
"B-core". "I'd have to give the credit to Jeff Rouse
and his work ethic," said Kenney. "He'd stay after
practice to work on his technique and the others
would follow his lead."
Many of the "others" are members of the unstop
pable rookie squad. "This may be premature to say,
but this year's freshman class looks like it'll be the
best class ever at Stanford," said Kenney. "They're
more amazing than I'd ever thought they'd be.
They've really taken a quantum leap."
A win at NCAAs in two weeks would be another
pleasant surprise for Kenney. The team's stiffest
competition should come from USC who will have 10
competitors and Texas with 12. Stanford is taking a
full team of 15.
"We won't lose the meet but another team might
win. They'll have to earn it though; we're going to
put up a fight," said Retterer.
Relays should be a key in Austin. On the first day
the Cardinal 400 medley "B" relay team swam the
third-fastest time in the nation. "Our relays are bet
ter, or at least even with Texas," said Kenney.
"We'll be in the hunt. Our guys believe we have a
chance to win and that's what counts," said Kenney.

A win at NCAAs in two weeks would be another
pleasant surprise for Kenney. The team's stiffest
competition should come from USC who will have 10
competitors and Texas with 12. Stanford is taking a
full team of 15.
"We won't lose the meet but another team might
win. They'll have to earn it though; we're going to
put up a fight," said Retterer.
Relays should be a key in Austin. On the first day
the Cardinal 400 medley "B" relay team swam the
third-fastest time in the nation. "Our relays are bet
ter, or at least even with Texas," said Kenney.
"We'll be in the hunt. Our guys believe we have a
chance to win and that's what counts," said Kenney.

When the Cardinal men's swim team got on the blocks for at the Pac-10 Championships last weekend,
USC was considered a favorite to win the meet. But after three days of unbelievable swimming, the Car
dinal came away with its 10th consecutive league title and the Trojans finished fourth.
I he men s swimming team left the competition
floundering high and dry in a state of shock last
weekend at the Pacific-10 Conference Champi
onships in Long Beach, Calif. The Cardinal left
everyone in its wake with a score of 877.5 while
UCLA placed second with 561.5. With the Stanford
victory (after a miserable 2-6 dual-meet season)
came a new Pac-10 record for most consecutive team
championships.
The Cardinal has won Pac-lOs for the last 10
years under the tutelage of coach Skip Kenney. "This

win was really special because it was totally unex
pected, it set a new Pac-10 record and we had a very
young team who gained and showed a lot of matu
rity," said Kenney
"It was the best swim meet that I've ever coached
from top to bottom," said Kenney. "I was witness to
swimming. . . that in 25 years of coaching I've never
seen."
To many, like Kenney, the meet was full of sur
prises. Coming in with the worst dual-meet record of
his Stanford career, he had his doubts. "I was con
cerned that we hadn't done enough right during the
dual-meet season," said Kenney.
Throughout the season people doubted and ques

tioned, but the Stanford swimmers never lost faith.
"Losing never affected us much because we still
believed, we still focused on (Pac-10s]," said fresh
man Brian Retterer.
Nevertheless, they astonished others. "If we'd
betted, you'd own my car, my house. . . chuckled
Kenney. "It was an unbelievable group effort, espe
cially when you look back at what they've overcome
this year. Not one person missed. That's incredible in
any sport. I've never had so many pleasant sur
prises."
"It started last week with the divers. Darryl
(Sagel, a freshman) dove over his head, maybe it was
a sign of things to come." Sagel placed sixth, seventh
and eighth on the one-meter, three-meter and plat
form. Teammate Brad Wightman captured third,
fourth and seventh, respectively.
Retterer's performance last weekend was one of
the biggest surprises. According to teammate Derek
Weatherford, "Brian swam out of his mind." His
time of 1:45.15 in the 200-yard backstroke was the
fourth fastest American time in history.
Kenney said Retterer's race was, "one of those
things you can coach but never be a part of. . . . He's
no longer an age-group swimmer, he's an Olympic
contender — all in one little meet. I've never seen
anybody improve that much."
In the 200 backstroke Retterer did the first 150
yards under American-record pace. With these phe
nomenal performances, the freshman from Nevada
even motivated world champion Jeff Rouse.
"Jeff knew that Brian had been going out so fast,
so he wanted to go all out too," said Kenney. Even
swimming unshaved with a broken wrist, Rouse fin
ished only .2 seconds off of his last year's NCAA-win
ning time and broke a meet record in the 100 back
stroke.
Retterer was relaxed about his meet of a lifetime.
"Going to Pac-lOs for the first time, I expected to be
overwhelmed. But it was just the same guys as dur
ing the season. You look over on the blocks and say
'Hey I beat you in duals so I'm sure not going to let
you beat me here.'
"Everyone swam really fast and it pumped me
up," said Retterer. It seemed to be another fresh
man, Trip Zedlitz who set the mood for the meet.
"Trip swam so fast and so inspiring. Everyone
saw that and we were all so excited," said Retterer.

Zedlitz dropped over two seconds off of his 200 indi
vidual medley and also had best times in the 100 and
200 backstroke.
"It's been an intense year — a new program, new
ideas. Throughout the year I swam fairly well but I
knew I could do better. It's encouraging to see it all
come together," said Zedlitz.
Zedlitz was another big surprise for Kenney. "It
was just amazing, he was within half a finger of
being a Pac-10 Champion — this kid from Oklahoma
City!"
The high-speed momentum, which began with
Zedlitz, carried throughout the three-day competi
tion. "I'd have trouble sleeping at night, waiting to
see them swim again," said Kenney.
If there could be a meet highlight, it would have to
be the 100 and 200 backstrokes. In addition to Ret
terer and Zedlitz's personal bests, Weatherford had a
lifetime best. This is especially notable because
unlike Retterer and Zedlitz, Weatherford has not
shaved yet.
In the finals of the 200 backstroke, five of the six
competitors were Cardinal men. Kenney acknowl
edges veteran Rouse as the driving force behind the
"B-core". "I'd have to give the credit to Jeff Rouse
and his work ethic," said Kenney. "He'd stay after
practice to work on his technique and the others
would follow his lead."
Many of the "others" are members of the unstop
pable rookie squad. "This may be premature to say,
but this year's freshman class looks like it'll be the
best class ever at Stanford," said Kenney. "They're
more amazing than I'd ever thought they'd be.
They've really taken a quantum leap."
A win at NCAAs in two weeks would be another
