# Volleyball falls to No. 2 Long Beach

Seven, and still counting. . . .
The Cardinal men's volleyball
team stretched its streak of futil
ity to seven matches Saturday
night in a 15-13, 15-11, 13-15, 15-
8 loss to second-ranked Long
Beach State.
Stanford has not tasted victory
in six weeks (their last win came
on Groundhog Day), and won't
get a chance to for two more
weeks as they break for finals
until a March 23 match against
California.
As has lately often been the
case, the Cardinal played a higher
ranked team very tough, but
wasn't able to put together a big
run at the end of a game when it
had to. Every time Stanford
grabbed a lead, the 49ers had a
decisive answer.
The six-week drought has seen
the Cardinal drop to 5-8 overall,
and 4-7 in Western Intercollegiate
Volleyball Association play. They
now stand in fourth place in the
WIVA's six-team Wilson Division,
behind top-ranked USC, Long
Beach State and San Diego State.
In completing a season sweep
of the Cardinal, Long Beach
lengthened their winning streak
to five matches, and improved to
19-2 and 8-1 in league play. The
49ers knocked off Stanford earlier
in the season in a five-game match
in Southern California.
The loss intensified the precar
iousness of Stanford's playoff
hopes. With only five league
matches remaining, they will
likely have to win two or three of
those matches to beat out Hawaii

and UC-Irvine for a berth in the
eight-team, WIVA postseason
tournament.
The ninth-ranked Cardinal
started quickly in Saturday's first
game, containing the 49ers' top
weapon, outside hitter Brent
Hilliard, with great blocking
movement by middle blocker John
Bezmalinovic. They jumped to a
seemingly insurmountable 10-5
advantage, only to watch Long
Beach answer with a demoralizing
10-3 run to claim the game.
The Cardinal looked strong
again in game two, staking an
early lead (6-1) with great outside
blocking. The 49ers, however, put
together two opportune six-point
runs, and the second one gave
them a decisive 14-8 lead.
Long Beach looked as if they
would be able to finish off a three
game sweep when they claimed an
11-7 lead on the hitting, digging,
and serving of Hilliard. But the
Cardinal dramatically salvaged
the game 15-13, and was hoping
to improve on its valiant, nearly
successful effort in the clubs'
February match, in which Stan
ford staved off in both the third
and fourth games before suc
cumbing 15-12 in the fifth.
Unfortunately the Cardinal did
not have to worry about fifth
game heroics as hitting errors
plagued their chances to win their
first match in Maples Pavilion this
season.
The Cardinal's March 23
match against Cal will not count
in overall standings as the Bears
are not NCAA-sanctioned. Stan
ford will play its next WIVA match
March 28 at Loyola Marymount.


Duncan Blackman had one of the best matches of his career Satur
day night, pounding out 28 kills and recording 12 digs. Despite his
heroics, however, the ninth-ranked Cardinal fell to No. 2 Long Beach
State in four close games.
