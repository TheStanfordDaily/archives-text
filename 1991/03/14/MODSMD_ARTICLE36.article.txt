# Tennis wins two

Sometimes it's not such a
good thing when predictions
come true. Stanford men's ten
nis coach Dick Gould learned
that the hard way this past
weekend when he predicted
two 5-4 matches and very
nearly got just that.
Despite being forced to dou
bles in both of its pre-Dead
Week matches, the top-ranked
Cardinal still recorded two
wins, downing 14th-ranked
Kentucky 5-4 and 12th-ranked
Miami 6-3. Stanford was tied
3-3 after singles play in both
contests.
"I don't feel real confident
with our singles lineup right
now," Gould said. "With the
injury to Jonathan [Stark],
guys have had a chance to step
up. Some have stepped up and
some haven't."
Unlike its singles, Stan
ford's doubles play was nearly
impeccable, especially with the
addition of Stark, who played
No. 1 doubles with Jared
Palmer in both matches. "The
Miami coach came up to me
after the match and asked me if
our doubles was that good or if
theirs was just that bad. I told
him it was probably us," asst.
coach John Whitlinger said.
"Our No. 1 and No. 2 teams
are especially solid. We're still
experimenting with different
combinations at No. 3."
Against Kentucky, Stanford
lost all three of its top singles

matches. The match at No. 1
singles provided the only real
drama as Alex O'Brien, ranked
No. 21 by the Volvo Tennis/Col
legiate Rankings, lost a
marathon three-setter to John
Yancey, ranked No. 41, 7-5, 6-7,
6-4.
Jason Yee, Vimal Patel and
Michael Flanagan each won
their singles matches in
straight sets at No. 4, No. 5 and
No. 6, respectively.
Stanford undoubtedly had
an edge going into doubles, but
when the No. 3 team of Chris
Cocotos and Dan Turbow lost
in a three-set match, 4-6, 6-3,
6-2, the Cardinal found itself
down 4-3.
Stark and Palmer picked up
the slack, however, playing a
"technically great" match,
according to Gould. Stark was
especially impressive as both
his service and his return game
looked in tip-top form. And, as
usual, Palmer had his fair
share of shots which most play
ers wouldn't dream of attempt
ing.
The tone of that No. 1 dou
bles match was set early when
Kentucky's lan Skidmore liter
ally had to duck after Stark hit
his first serve of the match into
Skidmore's body. "[The serve]
almost killed him," Whitlinger
said. Stark and Palmer won
the match 6-1, 6-4.
O'Brien and Yee clinched
the match at No. 2 doubles
with a solid 6-3, 6-3 win over
