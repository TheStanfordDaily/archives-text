# Tennis wins two
## 
### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
Sometimes it's not such a
good thing when predictions
come true. Stanford men's ten
nis coach Dick Gould learned
that the hard way this past
weekend when he predicted
two 5-4 matches and very
nearly got just that.
Despite being forced to dou
bles in both of its pre-Dead
Week matches, the top-ranked
Cardinal still recorded two
wins, downing 14th-ranked
Kentucky 5-4 and 12th-ranked
Miami 6-3. Stanford was tied
3-3 after singles play in both
contests.
"I don't feel real confident
with our singles lineup right
now," Gould said. "With the
injury to Jonathan [Stark],
guys have had a chance to step
up. Some have stepped up and
some haven't."
Unlike its singles, Stan
ford's doubles play was nearly
impeccable, especially with the
addition of Stark, who played
No. 1 doubles with Jared
Palmer in both matches. "The
Miami coach came up to me
after the match and asked me if
our doubles was that good or if
theirs was just that bad. I told
him it was probably us," asst.
coach John Whitlinger said.
"Our No. 1 and No. 2 teams
are especially solid. We're still
experimenting with different
combinations at No. 3."
Against Kentucky, Stanford
lost all three of its top singles

matches. The match at No. 1
singles provided the only real
drama as Alex O'Brien, ranked
No. 21 by the Volvo Tennis/Col
legiate Rankings, lost a
marathon three-setter to John
Yancey, ranked No. 41, 7-5, 6-7,
6-4.
Jason Yee, Vimal Patel and
Michael Flanagan each won
their singles matches in
straight sets at No. 4, No. 5 and
No. 6, respectively.
Stanford undoubtedly had
an edge going into doubles, but
when the No. 3 team of Chris
Cocotos and Dan Turbow lost
in a three-set match, 4-6, 6-3,
6-2, the Cardinal found itself
down 4-3.
Stark and Palmer picked up
the slack, however, playing a
"technically great" match,
according to Gould. Stark was
especially impressive as both
his service and his return game
looked in tip-top form. And, as
usual, Palmer had his fair
share of shots which most play
ers wouldn't dream of attempt
ing.
The tone of that No. 1 dou
bles match was set early when
Kentucky's lan Skidmore liter
ally had to duck after Stark hit
his first serve of the match into
Skidmore's body. "[The serve]
almost killed him," Whitlinger
said. Stark and Palmer won
the match 6-1, 6-4.
O'Brien and Yee clinched
the match at No. 2 doubles
with a solid 6-3, 6-3 win over
Scott Hulse and Andy Potter.
"[Yee] stepped up and played one
of the best matches I have ever
seen him play," Gould said.
Against Miami, Stanford once
again had trouble at the top spots
in singles, with the exception of
Palmer who started slow but
came back to whip Dean Cohen 7-
6, 6-0 at No. 2 singles.
"I've been starting slow lately.
It takes me a few games or maybe
even a set to get into the match.
That should change as the year
progresses," Palmer said.
O'Brien played two tight sets
at No. 1 but lost to Conny Falk,
who is ranked No. 14 nationally,
6-3, 6-4.
Yee and Patel once again came
through in singles. Yee fought

back from a 6-1 pasting in the
first set to top Krnie Lingen at
No. 4 singles, 1-6, 6-3, 6-4. Patel
had an easier time, crushing
Miami's No. 5 Pat Baker 6-1, 6-2.
"[Yee and Patel J had a great
weekend. Yee especially stepped it
up and played some great tennis.
He won all four of his matches in
singles and doubles for us, and we
really needed Ithose wins),"
Gould said.
Tied at 3-3 going into doubles,
Stanford simply hurricaned over
Miami, winning all three doubles
matches in straight sets.
Stark once again looked
impressive in doubles, particu
larly considering he has not
played competitive tennis since
last November. But Stark's play
did not surprise Palmer. "John
has been practicing with the team
lately, so we knew he was ready
going in. The only thing that is

'John has been prac
ticing with the team
lately, so we knew he
was ready going in.'

surprising about [the way Stark
has played! is how sharp he is,
especially after not playing com
petitively for so long. But that's
just the type of competitor John
is," Palmer said.
Stanford, 8-1 after this week
end, will play Fresno State at
Stanford Tennis Stadium March
27, which is during Spring Break.
The Bulldogs return their whole
starting lineup, and Whitlinger
promises an exciting match.
"Any time a team returns so
many starters, they are a definite
threat. It should be an exciting
match," Whitlinger said.
