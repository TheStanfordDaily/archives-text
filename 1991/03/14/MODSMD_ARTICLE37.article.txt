# Women crush ASU, Arizona

### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
The big one wasn't to be, but
the little ones proved that the
Titans of tennis are still tough to
top.
Stanford's much-anticipated
rematch with Florida last Sunday
was canceled by a deluge Mother
Nature should be proud of. Still,
the Cardinal managed to get in
back-to-back routs of the Arizonas
on the weekend and reasserted
itself as a nearly unstoppable
force on the women's tennis
scene.
Friday's 8-0 shellacking of the
Sun Devils coupled with Satur
day's 7-1 rout of the Wildcats
pushed Stanford to 13-1 on the
season, 5-0 in Pacific 10 Southern
Division play. Arizona State fell to
9-6, 2-3 while Arizona stands at
10-6, 3-3.
There was something of an
edge in the air as the Cardinal
took to the courts Friday for the
first time since the team's 76-
match winning streak came to an
end against Florida March 3 at the
National Team Indoors. Quickly,
though Stanford established that
any edge on the courts belonged
with the Cardinal women.
All 12 sets in singles sported
sixes for Stanford's starters.
Junior Debbie Graham and
sophomore Heather Willens were
particularly impressive as they
recorded wins of 6-0, 6-1 and 6-1,

6-0, -respectively. None of their
teammates had much trouble,
though. Sandra Birch's 6-4, 6-3
triumph over Krista Amend was
the closest match.
In doubles, freshman Laxmi
Poruri and senior Teri Whitlinger
took the day off so Willens and
Emma Woodhouse moved up to
No. 2. They were extended to
three sets by Meredith Geiger and
Jennifer Rojohn but gritted out
the 5-7, 6-3, 7-6 (7-5) win to com
plete the shutout.
Saturday served up much of
the same. Arizona's Danielle
Scott, the nation's 14th-ranked
player, could manage just a single
game off Birch in a 6-1, 6-0
blowout. Scott won the first game
before dropping the next 12. Gra
ham whitewashed Banni Redhair
6-0, 6-0 in 50 minutes. Again, no
singles match was even close.
Birch and Graham thrashed
Scott and Redhair 6-2, 6-1 — their
second straight triumph in which
they dropped just three games.
Willens and Woodhouse again
slotted in at second doubles with
Poruri-Whitlinger taking the day
off. There the Stanford duo suc
cumbed to Alix Creek and Jane
Yates 6-4, 6-2. The loss was the

only blemish on the Cardinal's
ledger for the abbreviated week
end.
Stanford was disappointed that
Florida was flooded out and that
the Gators could not remain in
the area for a possible Monday
meeting. The Cardinal will now
have to wait for NCAAs in May for
an opportunity to avenge its lone
defeat of the 19905.
Over spring break, though, the
team will face third-ranked Geor
gia, a team which it narrowly
defeated at Indoors. The Bulldogs
have been eliminated by Stanford
at the last four national champi
onships and will be gunning for
the Cardinal when the teams meet
on March 26.
Georgia is led by junior Shan
nan McCarthy, who is ranked fifth
on the latest Volvo Tennis/Colle
giate poll. McCarthy considered
attending Stanford but chose
Georgia largely because she felt
the team concept was stronger in
Athens.
In the first meeting between
Stanford and Georgia, the Bull
dogs recorded impressive wins at
fourth and sixth singles as well as
first and third doubles. Freshman
sensation Laura Kimel upended
Willens, and the Bulldogs' Tonya
Bogdonas smashed Kylie Jonh
son.
After the Georgia match, the
Cardinal will immediately head
south for tilts against Pepperdine
and San Diego.


Rajiv Chandrasekaran — Daily
Sandra Birch, In her second year of playing at No. 1 singles, has helped the Cardinal to a near-perfect
start this season. She and the team bounced back from a loss to Florida to drub Arizona State and Ari
zona over the weekend. A rematch with Florida scheduled for Sunday was rained out, however, so the
Cardinal will have to wait until May for revenge.
