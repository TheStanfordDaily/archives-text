# Men gymnasts take second
##

Stanford professors sometimes com
plain that when varsity athletes go away
to games or meets, they miss important
information that they need to know.
Well, professors, don't worry about the
Stanford men's gymnastics team mem
bers; they learned plenty on their trip
last weekend to Los Angeles.
Going into last Saturday night's cru
cial meet on the UCLA campus, the Car
dinal knew that this competition would
be its toughest of the season, since top
ranked Penn State and No. 2 Oklahoma
would join UCLA in trying to stop Stan
ford's iseason-long winning streak. But
the Cardinal didn't know quite where it
stood in relation to the country's best
teams, and what it found out was both
disappointing and encouraging.
Oldahoma finished ahead of second
place Stanford, 286.3 to 284.8, and con
sequently can claim supremacy in col
lege gymnastics, at least for now.
Although the level of difficulty in the
Sooners' routines, according to Cardinal
coach Sadao Hamada, is slightly below
Stanford's, Oklahoma is more consistent
right now. And consistency made the dif
ference last Saturday night.
The Sooners missed only four rou
tines, and as each miss came on a seper
ate event, none of them was counted in
the overall team score (on each event, six
gymnasts compete, but only five rou
tines are counted in the overall team
score).
Meanwhile, the Cardinal missed 12
routines, including four on the meet's
first event, parallel bars, normally one of
the team's best events.
The score differential on parallel bars
was two points, more than the margin of

victory for the entire meet. Hamada
attributed Stanford's problems on paral
lel bars to nerves, but he does not accept
this as an excuse.
"You can't be nervous on the first
event, as my guys were," he said. "You
have to be ready to perform, from the
meet's first event to the last."
Yet Hamada believes that the Cardi
nal will be ready when it faces the Soon
ers again, which will probably be in the
NCAA Western Regionals. "Oklahoma
was outstanding. . . . They are very pol
ished right now, but we are trying to
peak for the NCAAs," he said. "I' m not
too worried, even though they were bet
ter than I expected. . . . Once we get
more consistent, and hit our routines, no
one can beat us."
And Hamada has good reason to be
confident. In the meet, junior Tim Ryan
competed in the all-around for the first
time this year, putting up a strong 56.00
despite two misses.
Tim Wang, who has also been ham
pered by injury, finished just behind
Ryan with a 55.90. As a team, the Cardi
nal posted season highs on the floor
exercise and the vault. And perhaps
most importantly, Stanford is still hun
gry-
"After the meet, I could see that the
guys were not satisfied with second
place," Hamada said. "I hope that they
will remember how they felt, and can use
this meet in a positive way."
The race for the NCAA championship
in gymnastics looks like a two-team
affair. UCLA and Arizona State,
although perennial western powers, are
not in Stanford and Oklahoma's class,
nor are Ohio State or Penn State, last
week's number one team, which crashed
and burned in last Saturday competition
(280.1 â€” fourth place).
