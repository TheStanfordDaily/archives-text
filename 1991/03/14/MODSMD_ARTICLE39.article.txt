### Gretchen Atwood Staff writer 
As gray storm clouds threatened rain
Saturday, the Stanford track team pro
vided the thunder and lightening in the
form of Dave Strang and Jackie
Edwards.
At the home meet against San Fran
cisco State, Cal State-Hayward and Cal
ifornia women, Edwards led the Cardi
nal to dominating dual-meet victories
with four individual top honors.
Edwards started the day with a 20-
foot half-inch long jump, good for first
place.
"1 didn't jump that until the last
meet last year so I'm a bit ahead,"
Edwards said.
She has also been on a tear in the
triple jump. She beat out teammates
Dana Weeks and Alysia Hubbard with
an effort of 39 feet one-quarter inch.
Last weekend Edwards provisionally
qualified for the NCAA Outdoor Cham
pionships with a leap of 40-10&
Against SFSU, Hayward and Cal the
Jackie Edwards show continued with
victories in the 100 and 200 meters.
Edwards also ran a leg on the 4 x 100
relay team.
She took the hand-off from Melanie
Etz while a few steps behind Cal's
Joslyn Mack. Cal's team was still ahead
when Edwards passed the baton to Hub
bard. In a burst of speed Hubbard made
up several paces around the curve.
Anchor Rhonda Oliver then passed Cal's
Denise Ervin on the homestretch for the
win.
The victory was especially impressive
considering the team's regular anchor,
Chryste Gaines, was in Indianapolis for
the NCAA Indoor Championships.
Entering the meet she was seeded ninth
in the 55 meters. She finished fourth
with a time of 6.80 seconds, just .06 sec

onds off Carlette Guidry's winning time.
Gaines was pleased with her fourth
place finish, but was not satisfied with
her race.
"It didn't seem like the best I could
have run. There was a false start and it
kind of threw me. If there hadn't been
one I would have been more in tune with
the race. I wish I could have won, but
who doesn't," Gaines said.
"She got better with each round. To
make progress in that kind of rarefied,
pressurized circumstance is pretty
impressive," coach Brooks Johnson
said.
While Gaines was running in the
NCAA Indoor Championships, Dave
Strang was aiming for an NCAA Out
door Championship qualifying time in
the 800. He made it with a time of
1:47.41.
"It felt good to go fast under those
conditions, cold and windy," Strang
said. He now plans to concentrate on
getting his 1,500 time under the NCAA
qualifying mark.
Other notable performances included
Mark Mastalir provisionally qualifying
for the NCAAs with a 3:44.01 in the
1,500. Debbie Malueg provisionally
qualified for NCAAs in the discus and
won the shot put.
Jason Martin and Fred Carter fin
ished 1-2 in the men's 3,000 steeple
chase. Peggy Odita won the high jump,
and Ashley Black took first in the
women's 3,000.
The Stanford women are now 6-0 in
dual meets this season and the men are
5-0. The team has several weeks to pre
pare for the Stanford Invite/Diet Pepsi
Track Challenge that will be held at
Stanford Stadium March 28-30.
The Track Challenge will feature
some of the top athletes in the world.
Seoul Olympians and former Stan
ford standouts PattiSue Plumer and

Jeff Atkinson will compete in the
women's and men's invitational mile,
respectively.
Plumer holds the American record in
the 5,000 meters and was a three-time
All-American in the 3,000. Atkinson fin
ished 10th in the 1,500 at Seoul and gar
nered All-America honors twice.
The Track Challenge will also feature
two of the top three collegiate women
sprinters. Texas' Guidry is expected to
take on Stanford's Gaines in the 100 for
a rematch of sorts of their race in Indi
anapolis.
"I should have the advantage because
I'm already in tune with outdoor races
(this season). You train altogether dif
ferently indoors," Gaines said. She
hopes to qualify for the NCAA Outdoor
Championships in the 100 and 4 x 100
relay.
The Track Challenge is the brain
child of Johnson. The meet was con
ceived as a way for track, as a non-rev
enue sport, to be more self-sufficient.
"Right now football and basketball by
and large are required to support non
revenue sports. Its not fair to the young
people they coach and their staffs. Its an
inordinate amount of pressure to, not
only take care of your own program, but
someone else's program as well."
Other attractions of the meet include
the Pacific 10 Conference â€” Big Ten
Conference showdowns. Athletes from
Stanford, Oregon and Washington State
will make up the Pac-10 all-star squad.
The Big Ten team will be composed of
athletes from Ohio State, Michigan,
Michigan State and Indiana.
The interconference races should
spice up the already hot competition
provided by track powers Texas, Ten
nessee and Arkansas.
