# Rice quits post, heads for Farm
## Soviet expert to teach next fall 
### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Staff writer 
Condoleezza Rice, President
Bush's special assistant on
national security affairs, has
stepped down from her high-rank
ing post in Washington to resume
teaching at Stanford.
Rice, a Soviet specialist and
arms control expert, left her gov
ernment position this week and
has now returned to campus. Next
fall, Rice, an assistant professor of
political science, will once again
teach her undergraduate political
science class on the role of the mil
itary in politics.
"I didn't feel like I could go on
in Washington and keep the
integrity of my academic career,"
Rice said in a telephone interview
yesterday."It was the right time
in the cycle to leave. But it was a
wonderful two years," she added.
In 1988 Bush appointed Rice as
director of Soviet and Eastern
European affairs for the National
Security Council. The council con
sists of White House appointees

who track global events and keep
the president and his staff
informed.
Rice, 36, quickly climbed Wash
ington's political ladder. Following
her initial appointment, she was
promoted to Special Assistant to
the President for National Secu
rity Affairs and Senior Director
for Soviet Affairs.
During her two years in Wash
ington she was involved in key
meetings between Bush and
Soviet President Mikhail Gor
bachev. She also took part in dis
cussions on German unification
and on plans for the Soviet con
version to a free-market economy.
Last June, Rice was a member
of Gorbachev's entourage during
his visit to many parts of the
United States, including Stanford.
Rice's decision to give up her
White House position and return
to the Stanford classrooms where
she first began teaching in 1981
evoked positive responses from
faculty.
"It's great to have her back
because she is a super teacher,"
said Stephen Krasner, Political
Science Department chair. "She
has had a wonderful experience,
and that experience can be a bene
fit to both students and faculty in
the classroom," he added.
Rice's departure coincides with
growing domestic unrest and
increased use of military force in
the Soviet Union — particularly
in the Baltic states — factors
which are testing Gorbachev's
political strength.
But Rice said her departure
will not significantly bear upon
events in the Soviet or U.S. policy
in the region.
"The events in the Soviet
Union will unfold over a period of
time. It was not likely that by

being in Washington I would have
been able to see the Soviet
Union's problems through this
period," she said.
"I'm just happy to be back,"
she added. Another incentive for
returning to the University was to
work closely with graduate stu
dents whom she had closely super
vised before going to the nation's
capital, Rice said.
Those close to Rice in Washing
ton said she planned to return to
Stanford last December but
stayed to complete her two-year
term.
A former secretary for Rice in
Washington said there were "no
rankled feelings" between Rice
and her colleagues on the Security
Council. The secretary, who asked
not to be identified, said many
staff members were "sorry to see
Rice leave."
Another secretary, Nancy Max
field, said Rice left because of her
love for teaching and students,

"Everyone here really wanted hei
to stay, but Dr. Rice is a teacher
and she wanted to get hack to
teaching."
