## 
### Deborah Claymon Staff writer 
In case you hadn't noticed,
Stanford sailing is taking the
West Coast by storm. After see
ing his team climb to ninth in
the national rankings, the high
est for Stanford in five years,
coach Blake Middleton is confi
dent that "the team will keep
moving forward, determined to
peak by Pacific Coast Champi
onships in early May." En route
to that goal, Stanford will com
pete on both a regional and
national level in the next weeks.
Beginning with North Series
5, a team race regatta and
North 6 hosted by Stanford at
Redwood City, Stanford senior
teams of Rick Rosen and
Rebecca Bryson, and Dave
Dowd and Paula Gani hope to
repeat their dominant perfor
mance from South Series 5 and
6 at Santa Barbara.
Together Rosen and Dowd
smothered the 30-boat competi
tion, unhesitatingly taking the
series for Stanford, and leaving
California, USC and the defend

ing national champions, UC-
Irvine in the Cardinal's wake.
Garnering the South Series was
an important boost, showing
Stanford's ability to be the best
in California.
In addition, Stanford
charged to fourth place at the
Charleston Intersectional, fin
ishing behind current No. 1
Brown, Old Dominidn and sec
ond-ranked Navy. Coming away
from a second at the Sugar
Bowl regatta over Christmas,
Middleton felt that success at
Charleston was "almost more
impressive."
Stanford is preparing for the
Old Dominion Team Race
Regatta in Virginia in two
weeks, the last major national
competition for the Cardinal
before nationals. For the last
five years, Stanford has quali
fied for nationals in Team Rac
ing. A collegiate team race pairs
three boats from each school.
The best combined results of
the three determines the overall
finish.
"The complicated tactics
involve a lot of practice and

thought into what kind of boat
handling works in certain situa
tions. A lot of Stanford's strat
egy has come down through the
ranks, as past team members
teach the new sailors," said
Dowd.
"In the next weeks, it will be
very important for the team to
pull together in practice, learn
ing to work with the maneuvers
of the other boats," added Mid
dleton.
Stanford will also send a
team to the Ranier Cup Inter
sectional in Seattle during
Spring Break.
It looks as though Stanford
will dominate on the West Coast
in women's racing as well. The
Stanford women's team is cur
rently ranked 10th in the
nation. Lead by sophomores
Haley King and Catherine Ivey,
with crews Jen Yeh and Amy
Lightner, Stanford finished a
close second to UC-Irvine
recently at UCLA. King enthu
siastically said she is "psyched
to dominate at Pacific Coast
Championships."
