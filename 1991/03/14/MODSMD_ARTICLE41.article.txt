## New solar car's designers set sights on world speed record 
### Lisa Goldman 
Stanford students armed with a revolutionary
idea and a lot of hope are seeking to etch their names
in the record books. This spring, they will try to
break a world speed record in their new solar car,
Sunburner.
The Stanford Solar Car Project is currently build
ing its second solar vehicle, which will employ a con
centrator array — a novel design that uses many
mirrors to concentrate sunlight on a line of solar
cells.
The array will not be completed in time for the
Phoenix "Solar and Electric 500," which project
designers originally planned to be Sunburner's first
competition. Although Sunburner will not partici
pate in the race, it will run alongside competing cars,
allowing designers to test its electric battery.
Sunburner is expected to be fully functional by
the beginning of June, when the project designers
will attempt to break the world speed record for a
solar car. To do so, Sunburner will need to reach a
speed higher than 48.1 mph — the record currently
held by General Motors Corp.'s Sunßaycer.
Because the concentrator array will increase the
the percentage of incident sunlight that the car's
cells can convert to energy, Sunburner will have a
higher solar cell efficiency than last year's model,
SunSurfer.
SunSurfer utilized cells with an efficiency of
about 14 percent; that is, the cells absorbed 14 per
cent of the power available from sunlight. Because
high-efficiency cells are so expensive, the project's
builders have chosen to use a computer-tracked mir
ror to direct sunlight onto a smaller number of these
cells, rather than attach cells over the entire top of
the vehicle.
The elements of the concentrator array — mir
rors, solar cells and tracker — will all be attached to
the car. The mirrors will cover the surface of a long,
scooped trough on top of the car, and will focus sun
light on the designated cell area.
Although designed to have an efficiency of 25 per

cent, the cells' actual efficiency will be closer to 19
percent — still an improvement over last year. The
decrease is a result of power losses in the wiring
needed to construct the array, the packaging of the
set-up and the fact that the mirrors are not 100 per
cent reflective.
The orientation of a car with respect to the sun
constantly changes, both because of road curvature
and the motion of the Earth relative to the sun. Con
sequently, the mirrors will need to be correspond
ingly adjusted to optimally concentrate the sunlight.
A computer tracking system, called a "sun-seeker,"
will shift the mirrors to absorb maximum energy
from the sun.
The tracking system, developed by NASA, relies
on a computer that determines from the light inci
dent on a single cell how much power the array is
absorbing from the sun. The sun-seeker uses this
information to gently shift the mirrors in the best
direction to gain optimum amounts of energy.
The solar cells will convert light reflected from
the mirrors into electric current, which will either
power the car's electric motor or recharge an electric
battery. The entire array weighs just 60 pounds —
much less than if the car's entire top was covered
with solar cells. The total vehicle is expected to
weigh 400 pounds — 200 pounds lighter than Sun-
Surfer.
By concentrating sunlight on more efficient cells,
the designers of Sunburner are hoping to double the
car's power output to 2,000 watts.
"The ideal standard is 2,300 watts, but in an
actual race we will probably produce 2,000," noted
Stefan Heck, the project's coordinator.
The Stanford students who work on the project
face a special challenge because skeptics — from
competitors to Department of Energy employees —
have told them that their venture is impossible and
that there is no way it can work.
"We are out to prove that our car can work against
all odds," Heck stated. "Our trick is to combine solar
technology with a lot of composite experience and
accurate tracking."

The hardest thing about the project is "convinc
ing ourselves that this idea is going to work. We feel
that the car is going to function —or we wouldn't
have put in so much work," noted Jae Jung, a fresh
man designer.
On a grander scale, the car will pave the way for
the development of vehicles like it. Solar power
plants already use concentrator arrays, but auto
manufacturers have never tried the idea on a car.
The Stanford students are finding out that taking
this chance is already paying off.
"It's a really great way to get to know and apply

advanced technology," Heck emphasized. "The wor
is done entirely by students, from engineers t
philosophers. There's something for everyone."
The project is open to anyone who wishes to join
and relies on donations of car parts and money. Th
projected cost of the finished vehicle is $500,000.
With their record-breaking goal in sight, the stu
dents are making their project an unforgettable oni
If the year-long Sunburner project achieves its goal
it will furnish proof that the "impossible" idea of
solar car concentrator array may not be so impossi
ble after all.

cells, rather than attach cells over the entire top of
the vehicle.
The elements of the concentrator array — mir
rors, solar cells and tracker — will all be attached to
the car. The mirrors will cover the surface of a long,
scooped trough on top of the car, and will focus sun
light on the designated cell area.
Although designed to have an efficiency of 25 per

cent, the cells' actual efficiency will be closer to 19
percent — still an improvement over last year. The
decrease is a result of power losses in the wiring
needed to construct the array, the packaging of the
set-up and the fact that the mirrors are not 100 per
cent reflective.
The orientation of a car with respect to the sun
constantly changes, both because of road curvature
and the motion of the Earth relative to the sun. Con
sequently, the mirrors will need to be correspond
ingly adjusted to optimally concentrate the sunlight.
A computer tracking system, called a "sun-seeker,"
will shift the mirrors to absorb maximum energy
from the sun.
The tracking system, developed by NASA, relies
on a computer that determines from the light inci
dent on a single cell how much power the array is
absorbing from the sun. The sun-seeker uses this
information to gently shift the mirrors in the best
direction to gain optimum amounts of energy.
The solar cells will convert light reflected from
the mirrors into electric current, which will either
power the car's electric motor or recharge an electric
battery. The entire array weighs just 60 pounds —
much less than if the car's entire top was covered
with solar cells. The total vehicle is expected to
weigh 400 pounds — 200 pounds lighter than Sun-
Surfer.
By concentrating sunlight on more efficient cells,
the designers of Sunburner are hoping to double the
car's power output to 2,000 watts.
"The ideal standard is 2,300 watts, but in an
actual race we will probably produce 2,000," noted
Stefan Heck, the project's coordinator.
The Stanford students who work on the project
face a special challenge because skeptics — from
competitors to Department of Energy employees —
have told them that their venture is impossible and
that there is no way it can work.
"We are out to prove that our car can work against
all odds," Heck stated. "Our trick is to combine solar
technology with a lot of composite experience and
accurate tracking."

The hardest thing about the project is "convinc
ing ourselves that this idea is going to work. We feel
that the car is going to function —or we wouldn't
have put in so much work," noted Jae Jung, a fresh
man designer.
On a grander scale, the car will pave the way for
the development of vehicles like it. Solar power
plants already use concentrator arrays, but auto
manufacturers have never tried the idea on a car.
The Stanford students are finding out that taking
this chance is already paying off.
"It's a really great way to get to know and apply

advanced technology," Heck emphasized. "The wor
is done entirely by students, from engineers t
philosophers. There's something for everyone."
The project is open to anyone who wishes to join
and relies on donations of car parts and money. Th
projected cost of the finished vehicle is $500,000.
With their record-breaking goal in sight, the stu
dents are making their project an unforgettable oni
If the year-long Sunburner project achieves its goal
it will furnish proof that the "impossible" idea of
solar car concentrator array may not be so impossi
ble after all.
