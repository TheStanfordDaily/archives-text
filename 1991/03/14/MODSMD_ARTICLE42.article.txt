# Through a beer glass darkly
## 
### Richard N. Zare, Ph. D 
Pour yourself a beer and look
closely at the glass filled with |
rising bubbles. Careful exami- #
nation shows that the bubbles
are seldom uniformly distributed
throughout the liquid. Instead, |
streamers appear from certain \
small spots on the surface of the
glass.
Further inspection reveals that
the bubbles rapidly grow in size
as they rise, the volume of each
bubble often doubling or more.
Moreover, the bubbles accelerate;
that is, their speed increases as
they travel upwards.
Why?

As beer has been among us for r
several millennia, you would think
that we would have already learned
all there is to know about this curious
brew. Yet, just one glass of beer
reveals a remarkable interplay between
gases, liquids, solids, temperature,
pressure and gravity — an interplay that
is still not completely understood.
An understanding of beer bubbles
must begin with an understanding of
gas. All beer contains molecules of car
bon dioxide (CO2), which are given off
during the fermentation process that >
converts sugar to alcohol. J
If fresh beer were kept in an open J
container, the CO2 molecules would J|
escape into the atmosphere and
the beer would "go flat." When
beer is sealed in a bottle or a can,
there is nowhere for the trapped

COj molecules to go.
Instead, some CO a molecules collect
under the cap or lid. The pressure rises
inside the beer bottle or can until it reaches
two or three times the pressure of the
atmosphere outside the container.
Under these conditions an equilibrium
is established in which the number of CO,
molecules leaving the beer equals the num
ber of CO 2 molecules entering the beer. The
colder the beer, the more CO a molecules are
dissolved in the liquid.
Pop off the cap from a beer bottle or pull
the tab on a beer can and — fizzzzz —
trapped CO a gas begins to rush outwards.
The equilibrium is broken. Pour a cold beer
into a warm glass and bubbles appear.
Bubbles do not arise spontaneously
from individual molecules of carbon dioxide
dissolved in the beer. Visible bubbles start
from invisible clusters — or "microbub
bles" — of CO 2 molecules. These microbub
bles grow on rough spots on the glass sur
face called "nucleation sites" where the
COj molecules can attach themselves and
come together.
Thus, the formation of beer bubbles is
very similar to the formation of rain in
clouds in which the rain droplets grow on
dust particles.
Indeed, we can promote the bubbling of
beer by artificially introducing nucleation
centers, for example, by shaking into a
glass of beer some sugar, salt or pepper
(ugh!).
Alternatively, we can let the surface of
the glass serve the same function. At the
sites of rough patches or microcracks, bub
bles form as CO a molecules have a chance
to accumulate. Often these nucleation sites
produce a whole string of bubbles that
gracefully stream upwards.

But, what makes the bubbles grow as
they rise? It might be supposed at first that
the change in pressure accounts for this
behavior, but this cannot be so.
The correct explanation for bubble
growth is that bubbles accumulate more
carbon dioxide as they ascend through the
beer. In other words, bubbles act as nucle
ation centers for themselves.
What causes a bubble to rise? The
answer of course is that the density of a
bubble is less than the density of the sur
rounding beer. Archimedes' principle tells
us that this buoyancy force is proportional
to the volume of the beer displaced by the
spherical bubble, and thus depends on the
cube of the bubble's radius.
As the bubble rises, it encounters resis
tance to its motion, called drag. Because
the bubble is growing in size as it climbs
the beer glass, the drag force increases with
the size of the bubble, but less rapidly than
the bubble's volume.
If a bubble had a fixed size, it would
reach a constant velocity for which the
buoyancy force would exactly counterbal
ance the drag force. The same principle dic
tates that a falling person — a body with a
fixed size — will hit the ground with the
same velocity whether they jump from an
airplane or the Empire State Building.
However, the bubble's growing radius
causes the buoyancy force to increase
faster than the drag force, and this imbal
ance causes the bubble to accelerate as it
rises.
This explains why a string of bubbles
rising from a nucleation site on the beer
glass never appears uniform. The bubbles
near the bottom are smaller, more closely
spaced and rise more slowly than those
near the bottom.
Well, here's suds in your eye. Bottoms
up!
