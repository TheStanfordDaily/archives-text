# Through a beer glass darkly
## 
### Richard N. Zare, Ph. D 
Pour yourself a beer and look
closely at the glass filled with |
rising bubbles. Careful exami- #
nation shows that the bubbles
are seldom uniformly distributed
throughout the liquid. Instead, |
streamers appear from certain \
small spots on the surface of the
glass.
Further inspection reveals that
the bubbles rapidly grow in size
as they rise, the volume of each
bubble often doubling or more.
Moreover, the bubbles accelerate;
that is, their speed increases as
they travel upwards.
Why?

As beer has been among us for r
several millennia, you would think
that we would have already learned
all there is to know about this curious
brew. Yet, just one glass of beer
reveals a remarkable interplay between
gases, liquids, solids, temperature,
pressure and gravity â€” an interplay that
is still not completely understood.
An understanding of beer bubbles
must begin with an understanding of
gas. All beer contains molecules of car
bon dioxide (CO2), which are given off
during the fermentation process that >
converts sugar to alcohol. J
If fresh beer were kept in an open J
container, the CO2 molecules would J|
escape into the atmosphere and
the beer would "go flat." When
beer is sealed in a bottle or a can,
there is nowhere for the trapped

Salt thrown into a beer provides nucleation cen
ters for C0 2 bubbles, in much the same way as
an airborne dust particle nucleates a raincloud.
