# Panel treats RU486 controversy
## 
### Monica Uddin Staff writer 
Addressing a large crowd in
Kresge Auditorium on Saturday, a
five-member panel spoke about
the issues surrounding the newly
developed abortifacient, RU4B6.
The drug, generically called
mifepristone, terminates preg
nancy up to seven weeks following
conception. It is currently avail
able only in France, where it was
originally developed by the
French pharmaceutical company
Roussel-Uclaf.
The interdisciplinary forum,
titled "RU4B6 Now," was pre
sented by the National Organiza
tion for Women, Zero Population
Growth, the RU4B6 Task Force
and the Stanford Pro-Choice
Alliance.
Uta Landy, president of
Planned Parenthood Affiliates,
was the first panel member to
speak at the conference. She
claimed that one of the major
obstacles to bringing RU4B6 into
the United States is the unwilling
ness of Roussel-Uclaf to partici
pate in "controversial political
processes."
When the Health Ministry of
France first approved the drug in
September 1988, protests from
the French Catholic Church and
pro-life groups resulted in Rous
sel-Uclafs decision to suspend its
distribution.
Two days later, however, the
French government ordered
RU4B6 back on the market,
declaring it"the moral property of
all women."
Landy criticized the Bush
administration for its anti-abor
tion stance and its failure to sup
port reproductive choice for
American women. Both the
Netherlands and the United King
dom will soon have RU4B6,
mainly because of their govern
ments' support, she said.
"We need to create a climate of
support" for the new drug in
order to ensure the production of
RU4B6 in the United States, she
added.
Carol Ruth Silver, president of

Every Child a Wanted Child and
Saturday's conference moderator,
cited the traditional fear that con
traceptive developers have when
bringing a new product to market.
Companies want to avoid the
potential liability of users claim
ing negative side effects and the
threat of product liability litiga
tion, she said. Such concerns act
as an additional obstacle to the
production of RU4B6 outside of
France.
Although extensive testing of
RU4B6 is currently underway in
other parts of the world, such as
China, India, Hong Kong and
Cuba, further testing must be
done in the United States before
the drug can be legally distributed
in this country.
A U.S. drug company must first
obtain a license from Roussel-
Uclaf, present a protocol for a
series of tests to the Food and
Drug Administration, and then
submit an application for permis
sion to manufacture the drug to a
complex FDA approval process.
In June 1989, the FDA banned
the import of RU4B6 in to the
United States for private use.
Although some experts ques
tion the safety of the new drug,
the evidence to date suggests that
RU4B6 is both reliable and effec
tive.
Dr. Michael Policar, director of
the Women's Center at San Fran
cisco General Hospital, confirmed
that the chemical structure of
RU4B6 is similar to many of the
hormones that are naturally syn
thesized by the body or synthetic
hormones such as the progestin in
birth control pills.
The drug is not a "bizarre new
structure" likely to go off like a
"time bomb" in 30 years, he said.
RU4B6 is a synthetic steroid
that acts much like progesterone,
a hormone produced by the
ovaries that is necessary for sus
taining pregnancy. The drug locks
into progesterone receptors in the
cells of the uterus, but because it
does not function like proges
terone, the lining of the uterus
breaks down and is dispelled.
After an initial 600-milligram

oral dosage of RU4B6 is taken, a
patient must return to the doc
tor's office two days later to
receive a second drug, prostaglan
din, which induces the uterus to
contract and expel the embryo.
Some of the benefits of using
RU4B6 include its 96 percent effi
cacy rate and the avoidance of sur
gical invasion.
Although it was originally
thought that the drug would also
afford greater privacy to the
patient, its administration cur
rently requires at least four visits
to the doctor's office for proper
supervision.
Some of the drug's other draw
backs include side effects such as
nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.
Although RU4B6 is primarily
known as an abortifacient, it may
have potential for applications
other than terminating pregnan
cies. Studies have shown improve
ments in breast cancer patients
who are treated with RU4B6. Fur
ther studies involving the treat
ment of Cushing's disease, a fatal
disease characterized by hyper
tension, osteoporosis, diabetes
and infections, have also proved
encouraging.
Outside the medical realm, Sat
urday's panelists dealt with politi
cal, social and global implications
of the new drug. Tom McMahon,
director of the Population/Envi
ronment Balance Group, focused
on the threat of overpopulation to
the future of our biosphere.
Criticizing the myth that popu
lation increase is good and neces
sary for continued, healthy eco
nomic growth, McMahon stressed
the importance of achieving "a
balance between our population
and our environment."
U.S. Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-
Calif., the final speaker of the
afternoon, expressed her outrage
at the fact that the introduction of
RU4B6 to the United States has
become a political rather than a
health issue. She encouraged
audience mefnbers to write to
their political representatives so
that the government is made
aware of the strong public support
for domestic RU4B6 production.
