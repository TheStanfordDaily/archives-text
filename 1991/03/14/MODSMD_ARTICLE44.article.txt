# At last, prepare for the Seventh coming
## 
### Mark Kogowsky Editorial staff 
Macintosh users, beware: S-Day is
scheduled for May 13. The S stands for
System 7.0, the long-awaited update to
the basic software that allows the Mac to
run. It has been hailed as a great revolu
tion in personal computing and promis
es to change the way you interact with
your Mac.
It's also about a year behind schedule
and may be incompatible with much of
your existing software. But when it
becomes available (Apple promises no
later than June 30), you will be able to
pick up a copy for nothing. Most autho
rized Apple dealers will allow you to
duplicate the disks gratis. If you want a
complete set of manuals, though, be pre
pared to plunk down $50.
But before you make the jump, you'll
need to answer some difficult questions:
1) Can I do this?
2) Do I need to do this?
3) Do I want to do this?
The answer to the first question is
fairly straightforward: If you have a Mac
Plus, SE, SE/30, LC or any member of
the Mac II series, and it has two or more
megabytes of random access memory,
you can make the jump. Mac 128 and
512 owners are out of luck.
I know — all of the techno-freaks out
there are saying the Mac Plus and SE,
along with the original Mac 11, can't run
System 7. Wrong: they can't run all of
System 7, but much of the gee-whizbang
stuff won't require special hardware.
If you have one of the aforemen
tioned machines and lack the appropri
ate memory, then buy the memory. One
megabyte SIMMs are going for around
$40 from mail-order houses and
Microdisc will gladly install them for

$25. For under $200, you
can take your machine up
to at least four megs, a
level at which most peo
ple will be comfortable
for some time.
Whether you need Sys
tem 7 depends on what
you do with your Mac and
how comfortable you are
with it. The average stu
dent who does occasional

word processing and plays games now
and then does not need to make the
jump. She may want to, but it will not
have a major effect on how she relates to
her computer. (We'll get back to desire in
a moment.)
Those of you whose Macintoshes are
used for high-end graphics work or
desktop publishing — and just about
anyone on a network — may feel that
you've needed System 7 for years: You
use the Find File desk accessory at 4:45
p.m. to search for something on your
server's 600-megabyte hard disk, and it
takes 20 minutes for the thing to hunt
down the letter you just have to put in
the mail by 5.
With System 7, Find File will tell
your server that you're looking for that
file. With the server doing the searching,
minutes will often be reduced to sec
onds. This is just one of hundreds of
examples of what the next generation
can do to increase your productivity .
More dramatic changes — like the
ability of applications to communicate
with one another and dynamically
update information in each other's doc
uments — will mean quantum leaps in
computing power. A new way of display
ing type on the screen should bridge the
gap between what you see and what the
printout actually looks like. Though the

Macintosh has supposed
[ ly done this from day one,
users know just how
I untrue that is.
If you feel like your Mac
. intosh is not getting the
job done quickly enough,
or is simply unable to do
the things you need it to
do, System 7 may hold the
, answers.
That brings us to the

gray area between need and want. Many
Mac users are basically getting their
computers to perform up to an adequate
level. Sure, they would like to do more,
but they feel comfortable with the way
things work now.
The transition to System 7 is going to
knock these people out of their comfort
zones in a hurry. Frequent application
crashes, the failure of some of your
favorite startup documents to work,
confusion between old fonts and new
fonts and so on, promise to give the
average user more than a few three-
Advil headaches.
A lot of people will decide to wait a
few months for everything to settle
down before switching to System 7. A lot
of others will go to the store May 13 —
the rumored introduction date — and
load up the new system immediately.
They need to have the latest, the
hottest; they want to run all the new
toys.
Besides, they figure, System 7 is so
late almost all software has already
been updated and will be released as
soon as Apple does its thing. To an
extent they are right, but the transition
still will not be easy. In a future install
ment, Computer Corner will examine in
more detail a sample transition to Sys
tem 7.

System 7. Wrong: they can't run all of
System 7, but much of the gee-whizbang
stuff won't require special hardware.
If you have one of the aforemen
tioned machines and lack the appropri
ate memory, then buy the memory. One
megabyte SIMMs are going for around
$40 from mail-order houses and
Microdisc will gladly install them for

$25. For under $200, you
can take your machine up
to at least four megs, a
level at which most peo
ple will be comfortable
for some time.
Whether you need Sys
tem 7 depends on what
you do with your Mac and
how comfortable you are
with it. The average stu
dent who does occasional

word processing and plays games now
and then does not need to make the
jump. She may want to, but it will not
have a major effect on how she relates to
her computer. (We'll get back to desire in
a moment.)
Those of you whose Macintoshes are
used for high-end graphics work or
desktop publishing — and just about
anyone on a network — may feel that
you've needed System 7 for years: You
use the Find File desk accessory at 4:45
p.m. to search for something on your
server's 600-megabyte hard disk, and it
takes 20 minutes for the thing to hunt
down the letter you just have to put in
the mail by 5.
With System 7, Find File will tell
your server that you're looking for that
file. With the server doing the searching,
minutes will often be reduced to sec
onds. This is just one of hundreds of
examples of what the next generation
can do to increase your productivity .
More dramatic changes — like the
ability of applications to communicate
with one another and dynamically
update information in each other's doc
uments — will mean quantum leaps in
computing power. A new way of display
ing type on the screen should bridge the
gap between what you see and what the
printout actually looks like. Though the

Macintosh has supposed
[ ly done this from day one,
users know just how
I untrue that is.
If you feel like your Mac
. intosh is not getting the
job done quickly enough,
or is simply unable to do
the things you need it to
do, System 7 may hold the
, answers.
That brings us to the

gray area between need and want. Many
Mac users are basically getting their
computers to perform up to an adequate
level. Sure, they would like to do more,
but they feel comfortable with the way
things work now.
The transition to System 7 is going to
knock these people out of their comfort
zones in a hurry. Frequent application
crashes, the failure of some of your
favorite startup documents to work,
confusion between old fonts and new
fonts and so on, promise to give the
average user more than a few three-
Advil headaches.
A lot of people will decide to wait a
few months for everything to settle
down before switching to System 7. A lot
of others will go to the store May 13 —
the rumored introduction date — and
load up the new system immediately.
They need to have the latest, the
hottest; they want to run all the new
toys.
Besides, they figure, System 7 is so
late almost all software has already
been updated and will be released as
soon as Apple does its thing. To an
extent they are right, but the transition
still will not be easy. In a future install
ment, Computer Corner will examine in
more detail a sample transition to Sys
tem 7.
