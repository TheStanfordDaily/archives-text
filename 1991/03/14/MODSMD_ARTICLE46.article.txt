# Büg annoyed by boring, insipid questions

I've been getting a few complaints
of late. People seem to think that I've
taken some artistic liberties, bent the
truth, perhaps even colored the facts
with my own Up-With-People,
Lassie's-coming-home outlook on life.
Well, they said Van Gogh was crazy.
They also said Charles Manson was
missing some dots on his dice, but
maybe that's not such a good example.
What do you want, the Shell Answer
Man? Mr. Goodwrench, maybe? I'm
sorry; I'm not going to wear overalls.
Plus, I've had to suffer the ignobil
ity of having the less "tidy" bits of my
articles remorselessly edited. I won't
stand for this journalistic McCarthy
ism, even if it means I may be silenced
for my views.
I can see it now: One day I'll just
"vanish." Oh, you laugh about it now,
but someday I'll join the ranks of fel
low martyrs Amelia Earhart, Jimmy
Hoffa and Gavin McCloud. (No, wait
— he's still alive.) My eight children —
fatherless! My pet monkeys, Herbie
and Bobo — without a home!

And then who is going to stimulate
your mind, expand your awareness
and titillate your naughty bits? Who
else can render your humdrum, mail
order existence at all bearable? "Who
can take a nothing day and suddenly
make it all seem worthwhile?"
Maybe I'm just overreacting. I
haven't been the same since the day
they canceled "Joanie Loves Chachi."
Dear Bug,
What exactly is "White Flower
Day"? Is it an annual holiday recog
nized by Congress? And is Macy's the
only institution which celebrates this
event?
— Victim of Madison Avenue
Because this was the first letter I've
received through the mail, I immedi
ately grabbed the phone and dialed
Macy's. Unfortunately, when I heard
the prerecorded message mention
"manacles" and "squirming love
python" in the same sentence, I real
ized I had, in my haste, mistakenly
phoned the Women's True Confessions
900 number. And you know some
thing? They really are confidential and

one-on-one.
After hanging up with my new
friend "Lacy," I called Macy's and
posed your question to Phyllis in Cus
tomer Service. And while Phyllis' area
of expertise wasn't nearly as intriguing
and well-rounded as Lacy's, Phyllis
was able to inform me that White
Flower Day is a special sale that occurs
semi-annually at the store.
The holiday, alas, has nothing what
soever to do with the legislative branch
of our upstanding U.S. government.
Long ago, the salespeople would wear

white carnations on their bodies to
mark the occasion, hence the name.
Dear Bilg,
Where does the R in the abbrevia
tion for Mrs. come from ?
Upon hearing this question, Terrie
at the Green Library Reference Desk
had this to say: "It's from mistress."
Then she carted out a dictionary to
prove it.
Can't you people think of anything
a little more interesting and/or diffi
cult? If I get one more question I can
answer in a sentence or two, I'm going
to maim passers-by in the Quad.
Another "Why does White Plaza
stink?" and I'll start setting campus
monuments aflame.
And I thought you were "electric
youth."
