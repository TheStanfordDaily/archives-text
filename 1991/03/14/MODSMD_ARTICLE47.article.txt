# Treasure Hunt
## 
### 
All right Skipper, you've tracked
me down. There's nowhere to run to,
baby, nowhere to hide.
We're five weeks deep into this
thing and some of you are getting
awfully close. So close that I can smell
your breath. So close that it hurts
just to see you smile.
Did I mention the reward? It's a
$75 gift certificate to the conve
niently located, art deco-swathed,
Cajun cuisine eatery, "Crawdad and
Company." Just think, $75. That's a
lot of crawdads.
Stop drooling on my page; I've
spent a lot of time on this. You make
me sick.
Look, I know it's Dead Week; I
know you're busy. But only the strong
survive. Just ask Nitro.
So it's Dead Week — stop whining.
Go shout out your window or some
thing to convince people that this
school is really such a nightmare. Get
a grip; Mrs. Walker's eighth-grade
biology class took me more time than
my pathetic excuse for 13 units.
But anyway, you can consider this
a study break from your long, labori
ous hours of studying. I have a right

mind to teach you a lesson and send
you to Korea, where you can spend 12
hours a day slaving over little plastic
toys that deep down you know will
never work and will only serve to give
small children their first taste of dis
appointment.
Me, bitter? Hey, I've got three
papers to write and I'm sitting
around trying to figure out a neato
study break for you pathetic mon
grels who wouldn't know the differ
ence between art and "Married With
Children."
Now for clue numero five.
Pay attention, I'll be talking
quickly.
Clue Number Five
Our hero and his lovely wife Ida
return from a long day of work doing
whatever it is a hero and his wife
named Ida do for a living. Anyway,
they get home and decide to watch
some tele, as such people as our hero
and his lovely (Did I mention tal
ented?), yes, lovely and talented wife
Ida would be apt to call it. So they sit

down to watch
tele, and they flip
through the chan
nels more than
twice and finally
settle upon ABC.
Then, after watch-

ing several min
utes of "Coach," they flip through the
channels once more, this time back
wards, hoping that by doing so they
will be able to fool the television (or,
as such people as our hero and his
lovely and talented (Did I mention
philanthropic?), yes, lovely, talented
and philanthropic wife Ida are apt to
call it, the tele) into providing a
higher form of entertainment. Not
that our hero (who still remains
nameless for obvious reasons, which
you will no doubt discover upon the
disclosure of the Treasure Hunt,
either by virtue of your discovering
the place of hiding, or by virtue of our
printing the result if and when a dif
ferent person (who, in effect, might
actually be you, being that I've
already referred to someone else as
person A, so you could very well be
this other person, hereafter referred
to as person B, or better yet, person
not A, for certainly, using this logic,
you could be person C, or D, or some
other letter or number or strange
symbol even) discovers the place of
hiding) wouldn't call it a TV, for he
has probably done so in the past, and
probably will do so again in the

future, but suffice it to say that he,
and his lovely, talented and philan
thropic (Did I mention sharp-witted?)
yes, lovely, talented, philanthropic
and sharp-witted wife Ida usually
referred to the aforementioned tech
nological innovation as a tele. Well,
anyway, after finding nothing but
snow and an irritating static noise on
channel 25, our hero and his lovely,
talented, philanthropic, sharp-witted
(Did I mention thoroughly nimble for
her age?) yes, lovely, talented, philan
thropic, sharp-witted and thor
oughly-nimble-for-her-age wife Ida
flipped stations (this time, forward,
once again hoping that a directional
change would somehow disconcert
the tele (as they were apt to call it)
into changing its programming) until
they reached channel 21, and once
again saw nothing but snow and
heard nothing but static, at which
point our hero and his lovely, tal
ented, philanthropic, sharp-witted
and thoroughly nimble-for-her-age
(did I mention unfathomably horny)
yes lovely, talented, philanthropic,
sharp-witted, thoroughly nimble-for
her-age and unfathomably horny wife
Ida jumped into bed and made love
like rabbits until they collapsed in a
disgusting heap of sweat and flesh at
2 p.m. the very next day.
Happy Dead Week. See you and
your little friend Toto sometime next
quarter.

Clue Number Five
Our hero and his lovely wife Ida
return from a long day of work doing
whatever it is a hero and his wife
named Ida do for a living. Anyway,
they get home and decide to watch
some tele, as such people as our hero
and his lovely (Did I mention tal
ented?), yes, lovely and talented wife
Ida would be apt to call it. So they sit

down to watch
tele, and they flip
through the chan
nels more than
twice and finally
settle upon ABC.
Then, after watch-

ing several min
utes of "Coach," they flip through the
channels once more, this time back
wards, hoping that by doing so they
will be able to fool the television (or,
as such people as our hero and his
lovely and talented (Did I mention
philanthropic?), yes, lovely, talented
and philanthropic wife Ida are apt to
call it, the tele) into providing a
higher form of entertainment. Not
that our hero (who still remains
nameless for obvious reasons, which
you will no doubt discover upon the
disclosure of the Treasure Hunt,
either by virtue of your discovering
the place of hiding, or by virtue of our
printing the result if and when a dif
ferent person (who, in effect, might
actually be you, being that I've
already referred to someone else as
person A, so you could very well be
this other person, hereafter referred
to as person B, or better yet, person
not A, for certainly, using this logic,
you could be person C, or D, or some
other letter or number or strange
symbol even) discovers the place of
hiding) wouldn't call it a TV, for he
has probably done so in the past, and
probably will do so again in the

future, but suffice it to say that he,
and his lovely, talented and philan
thropic (Did I mention sharp-witted?)
yes, lovely, talented, philanthropic
and sharp-witted wife Ida usually
referred to the aforementioned tech
nological innovation as a tele. Well,
anyway, after finding nothing but
snow and an irritating static noise on
channel 25, our hero and his lovely,
talented, philanthropic, sharp-witted
(Did I mention thoroughly nimble for
her age?) yes, lovely, talented, philan
thropic, sharp-witted and thor
oughly-nimble-for-her-age wife Ida
flipped stations (this time, forward,
once again hoping that a directional
change would somehow disconcert
the tele (as they were apt to call it)
into changing its programming) until
they reached channel 21, and once
again saw nothing but snow and
heard nothing but static, at which
point our hero and his lovely, tal
ented, philanthropic, sharp-witted
and thoroughly nimble-for-her-age
(did I mention unfathomably horny)
yes lovely, talented, philanthropic,
sharp-witted, thoroughly nimble-for
her-age and unfathomably horny wife
Ida jumped into bed and made love
like rabbits until they collapsed in a
disgusting heap of sweat and flesh at
2 p.m. the very next day.
Happy Dead Week. See you and
your little friend Toto sometime next
quarter.
