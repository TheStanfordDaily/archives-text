# Dead Week blues are gonna make you scream of spleens, baby
## 
### Ken Wharton Staff writer 
YES, IT'S THAT TIME of year again,
when you realize that maybe you
shouldn't have gone through winter
quarter with the philosophy "The sooner
you get behind, the longer you have to
catch up."
Sure, it seemed to make a lot of sense
at the time, but somehow the days have
slipped by; now, just as it feels like
midterms have barely ended, it's already
Dead Week.
But that doesn't mean that the cam
pus is dead. In fact, because this is the
week when people have the most to do, it
is also the week with the most complex
procrastination techniques.
Under all the pressure, people are very

susceptible to random ideas and com
ments, such as, "Hey, let's drive to L.A.
for a Fatburger!" As a result, the campus
is usually crawling with people doing
stupid things as an excuse not to study.
At this point, many of you are probably
asking yourself "Who could I get to drive
me to L.A.?" while the rest of you, having
actually eaten a Fatburger, are merely
wondering what the "Dead" in Dead Week
is supposed to mean.
As far as I know, it's called "Dead
Week" because it has traditionally been
the time of year when students cash in on
the fact that a simple, unfortunate acci
dent involving your roommate and a com
mon household appliance gets you
straight A's for the quarter. (Plus, if you
act now, Res Ed will throw in 12 free back
rubs from the Bridge!)

Incidentally, this is also how the
Scream got started.
Actually, I find simply screaming at the
top of my lungs every midnight a little
boring, so lately I've been screaming
actual words instead. I think I'll do the
"Internal Organs" theme tonight
("Spleen! Pancreas! Small Intestine!"),
and save "Euphemisms for Vomiting"
until Friday.
But despite all the fun, Dead Week will
always be known for work. Fantastically
huge amounts of work. I mean, we're
talking about more work than the Uni
versity put into disguising the indirect
cost items as something legitimate.
As far as I can tell, there are four dif
ferent methods that people use to get all
of this done:
Nerding Out: This is used by the

same people who started studying for
finals around New Year's. During Dead
Week, they move all of their personal
belongings to the library and stake out a
territorial claim, much in the same man
ner as many wild animals. After they get
used to the smell, they sit down with their
books and commence to stress out to the
point where they get absolutely nothing
accomplished.
Cramming: After spending all of
Dead Week recovering from Fatburger
related injuries, you may realize that
despite attending more than half of your
classes, you've retained less factual infor
mation than a Radio Baghdad broadcast.
Using this method, you would then spend
30 consecutive hours learning everything
you missed during the quarter, and would
then proceed to fall asleep during the

final.
ZEN: Who needs to study? Get lots of
sleep, walk into the final, attain a strong
peace of mind, and then write down what
ever comes to you. (Note: Reading the
actual questions not only fails to help, but
is often counter-productive. In fact, this
method works best when you don't even
know which final you're taking.)
Stopping Out: This is the easiest
option, and very attractive as well,
assuming you have $7,000 lying around.
But, if you survive your finals, you
have spring break to look forward to.
That's right, 10 fun-filled days with noth
ing to do but sit in the sun and reflect on
how wonderful life is, how you love wast
ing time, and how you shouldn't have
written an essay about booger shooting
techniques for your physics final.
