# Students lobby for more aid
## 
### Howard Libit Staff writer 
Five Stanford students are planning to partici
pate along with college students from around the
country in a congressional hearing next week to
secure more money from the government.
The students will testify Monday before the joint
Subcommittee on Higher Education at a hearing on
the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act of
1965.
The testimony is part of a lobbying effort by the
United States Student Association to increase fed
eral financial aid. The association is a student lobby
ing organization created in 1947 to promote educa
tion interests. More than 300 students governments,
including the ASSU, currently belong.
The Higher Education Act must be reauthorized
by Congress every five years, and association mem
bers say they believe the act may undergo significant
structural changes in this year's revision.
The association said in a statement that it will
lobby Congress to reject the recently released White
House financial aid proposal, which, among other
provisions, calls for significant cuts in grants and
loans to low- and middle-income students.
The proposed reductions will cut at least $3 mil
lion in aid from Stanford students alone, said senior
Naomi Onaga, an ASSU senator and one of the stu
dents going to testify. Onaga is currently vice chair of
the student association's California division and a
former member of its board of directors.

Onaga will fly to the nation's capital tomorrow
with freshman Danny Ruderman, juniors Brian
Hooker and Jennifer Pearson and first-year gradu
ate student Maureen Porter. They are one of nine
groups the association has invited to participate.
The congressional hearing will come at the end of
a four-day association conference designed to
address many legislative concerns facing students
including the education budget, racism on campus
and the Civil Rights Act of 1991.
The Stanford delegation will spend little time
actually participating in the conference, however,
because it will need to coordinate with the other stu
dent groups to try to present a cohesive message dur
ing the hearing, Hooker said.
Stanford was chosen to testify because it is a pri
vate institution, Pearson said. Nearly all the other
groups are from state student associations.
"We will remove the myth that Stanford students
do not use financial aid," Pearson said.
Student opinion has been solicited by the group
for use in their testimony, Onaga said. The group has
distributed written surveys to 1200 students and is
still accepting written statements to submit to the
congressmen at the hearing. The survey information
will not be compiled until the end of this week.
Limited funding has put huge constraints on the
group's efforts, Onaga said.
To work more effectively in the future, the associ
ation plans to open a permanent "lobby office" in the
ASSU to provide a "direct link to students," Pearson
said.
