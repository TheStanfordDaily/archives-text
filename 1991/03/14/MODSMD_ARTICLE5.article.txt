# Rainfall replenishes dehydrated lakebed

After being dry for three years,
Lake Lagunita is on the rise again.
Because of recent rainfall and
high water levels in a local creek,
the University is starting to fill
the lake, said Michael Ramsey-
Perez, program and fraternal
affairs adviser.
Although the current rise in
the lake level is due mostly to
direct rainfall, Stanford Utilities
Manager David Kave said, the
University did divert water into
the lake on two occasions last
week.
The diverted water came from
nearby San Francisquito creek
because the creek was running
high, Kaye said. The University
will continue to divert water as
long as there is adequate rainfall,
he added.

One reason for channeling
creek water into the lake is "to
recharge the ground water in the
aquifers in order to replenish
some of the water in (Stanford's)
wells," Kaye said.
Aquifers are underground
rivers and lakes that are fed by
ground water and help fill the
University's wells.
Ramsey-Perez said if the water
were not diverted from the creek,
it would just flow into the Bay.
Kaye warned lake lovers not to
grow too attached to the resur
gent lake because unless it rains
heavily, the water will soon
recede.
In past years, the lake has been
filled both by rainfall and by the
University channeling water from
other sources. However, due to the
drought, the lake has not been
filled since the 1987-1988 school
year.
