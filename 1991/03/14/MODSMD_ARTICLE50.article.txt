Haas named model for service
Organizers of a nationwide community-service
conference have named Stanford's Haas Public
Service Center one of seven outstanding models of
public service in higher education.
Haas Asst. Director Megan Sweezey said she
was notified of the selection last Friday by the
conference's sponsor, the Collaborative for Com
munity Service and Development at the Univer
sity of Massachusetts in Boston. The Collabora
tive is that university's equivalent of Haas.
The organization will present the model com
munity service programs to other colleges and
I universities at its second annual conference April
4-5. This year's program is titled "Beyond 1,000
Points of Light: Values, Priorities and Strategies
for Community Service in the '905."
Conference organizer Jeff Beane said official
notification will be sent through the mail this
week. He declined to say which other colleges and
universities were selected.
Sweezey said she expects Haas Director
Catherine Milton to represent the center and its
2,000 student workers at the conference.

Sorority gets national chapter
The local Chi Alpha Pi sorority has been
accepted by the national Chi Omega sorority and
will become an official chapter June 1, said soror
ity president Shanie Geddes.
During the past month, Chi Alpha Pi was offi
cially recognized by the University and the Inter

sorority Council. On March 7, it was accepted by
Chi Omega, Geddes said.
Currently, the sorority includes 41 members,
she said. On April 16, at the end of Rush, both
current and new members will pledge Chi Omega
and the sorority will become a colony, she said.
The colony period — designed for sorority
members to learn about national group policies,
procedures and values — will be a sort of pledge
period for the whole group, she said.

Law Review president elected
Tony West, a second-year law student, has been
elected president of the Stanford Law Review and
will take office in the middle of next month.
He replaces current president Shauna Jackson
and will be the Law Review's second consecutive

"It's going to be a lot of work but one of the
most exciting challenges of my life," West said.
As president, West will be responsible for all
administrative, editorial and financial aspects of
the journal.
The Law Review is published six times a year
and is staffed by nearly 150 students. It is a collec

West is a 1987 graduate of Harvard University,
where he earned a bachelor's degree with honors.
He entered Stanford Law School in September
1989.
