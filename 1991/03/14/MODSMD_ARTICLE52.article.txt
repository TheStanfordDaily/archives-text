# Drunk-in-public charges filed after party
## 
### Connie Chang Editorial staff 
Police will press charges against five stu
dents who attended a Feb. 22 Theta Xi party
and were arrested for being drunk in public,
regardless of the University's response to rec
ommendations from the Office of Student
Activities and the Inter fraternity Council.
"The criminal justice side has nothing to do
with the University," said Stanford Police
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
Niemeyer said freshman Hon Joseph was
arrested at the Pearce Mitchell houses near
Theta Xi about 11 p.m., and police suspect he
consumed alcohol at the fraternity party.
Sophomores James George and Richard
Waters, freshman Matthew Jones and senior
Stanley Brobston, were arrested at or near the
fraternity house after police ended the party at
about 1 a.m.
Police also plan to press charges against
Ignacio Sanchez, not from Stanford, who was
arrested at Synergy where he was found
passed out on a couch. Residents said he uri
nated on the carpet near the staircase.
Other students at the Theta Xi party said
they saw him there.

A videotape the police recorded upon arriv
ing at the party may be used as evidence
against two of the arrested students,
Niemeyer said.
The usual sentence for this misdemeanor is
a small fine and some community service
work.
Police officials are also using accounts from
their own investigation and a preliminary Stu
dent Activities report to determine what
action will be taken against participants in the
fight that occurred at the fraternity.
The preliminary Student Activities account
is based on information gathered from 29
Theta Xi members and two witnesses unaffili
ated with Stanford.
Although police officers arrived after those
involved in the fight had left, Niemeyer said
felony charges can still be filed against the stu
dent injured in the fight and another partici
pant who is not affiliated with Stanford and
has yet to be positively identified.
The Stanford student, junior Jason Beattie,
was admitted to Stanford Hospital with a frac
tured skull after the party and was kept
overnight. He could not be reached for com
ment yesterday.
The other participant came with a group of
friends who knew the members of the band

Theta Xi hired to perform that night, the Stu
dent Activities report says.
Niemeyer said Beattie and the other partic
ipant will probably be charged with assault
with the intent to commit bodily harm.
Student Activities reported that after
bumping into each other, exchanging some
words and possibly shoving, Beattie and the
friend of the band began fighting.
In the report, Beattie said he was taken
from behind and knocked to the ground.
Another student said Beattie initiated an
attack.
Niemeyer said the police are not seeking to
place blame on either side. Police believe both
"factions — Stanford and outsider — are
equally to blame," he said, adding that "being
intoxicated and trying to act tough was a cata
lyst for the fight."
According to the Student Activities report,
Beattie was taken home by friends before the
police arrived at the house. After discovering
blood leaking from his ear, Beattie's friends
took him to the hospital.
The report says the students re-encoun
tered the band's friends at the hospital. The
other main participant in the fight was also
injured but left before seeing a doctor.
