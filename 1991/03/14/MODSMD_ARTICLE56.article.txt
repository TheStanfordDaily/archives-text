# Four slates to vie for COP
## 
### Miranda Doyle Staff writer 
This spring, four Council of Presidents slates
and 46 senatorial candidates will appear on the
ASSU elections ballot, according to a preliminary
list issued by Elections Commissioner Raul
Lopez.
The list includes two COP slates that have not
previously been announced:
• The Students First COP slate includes grad
uate student John Overdeck, junior John Louie
and sophomores Beth Morgan and Benny San
doval. The slate is called "Students First."
• An independent student slate, named "Four
Play," consists of junior Uri Attia and sopho
mores Sarah Ferroni, Brad Cleveringa and Pete
Huyck.
The two other slates were announced last
week.
"Stand and Deliver," the People's Platform

slate, is made up of senior Mae Lee, junior Jen
nifer Pearson and sophomores Nicole Johnson
and Mike Curry.
Seniors Michael Schreiber, David Levin and
Srinivas Kumar and junior Amy Arends will run
under the title "Click Here For Fee Refund." The
slate is sponsored by the Hammer and Coffin
Society, composed of the leaders of the Chaparral.
Lopez said there are usually only two or three
COP slates. Having four this year "very likely
means that we are going to have a runoff elec
tion," he said.
Thirty-one students declared their intention to
run for the 10 voting senate positions and 10 non
voting positions. Lopez said he considers the
number of undergraduate senate candidates
small.
Fifteen graduate students are also on the bal
lot for the 10 graduate positions.
There are currently 14 fee requests on the bal
lot.
