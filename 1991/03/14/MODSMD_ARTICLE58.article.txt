## THE
						STANFORD DAILY'S PSYCHOTIC WEEKLY Reversing roles for Parents' Weekend 
### 
I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHY I was so nervous.
After all, they were my parents, the ones who reared me,
who took care of me when I was sick. The same ones
who fed me chick peas against my will, who never bought
me a dog, who wouldn't let me go to Suzie Weiner's sev
enth-grade party just because her parents weren't going to
be home....
But this wasn't bitterness I was feeling. Nor was it some
sort of vague suburban teenage angst. I had been through
all of that.
This was nervousness. I was nervous because my parents
were coming to Stanford for Parents' Weekend.
"First time?" mutters the voice in my head that sets up
stupid jokes for me.
"Nope. Been nervous lots of times."
There was no need for me to be nervous. I see my par
ents every break; they call all the time, usually when I've got
a couple of chicks waiting up in the 10ft.... Would you
believe some friends sitting around a Nintendo game?...
How about a big paper due the next day? Anyway, I had seen
these cats before.

But this was different. They were coming to my school.
And I had to show them around.
And I had to pick them up at the airport. I was picking
my parents up. I couldn't wait to get there and bitch. Lob the
old "Don't your friends' parents ever drive you guys any
where?" line right back over the proverbial badminton net.
I parked my car at the airport and walked three miles to
the United Airline terminal.
There they were, just as I suspected. I was 10 minutes late
and they were already at the pay phone, talking at my room
mate. This lob thing just wasn't going to happen.
I hug them. First my mom, then my dad, then my sister.
(Her name is Lisa and you can currently see her in the role
of "Daffy," one of several flowers in a play now running at
the Wardlaw Hartridge Lower School.) I foresee a lot of
hugging.
They tell me how long my hair is and how they packed
heavy rain gear because they had been listening to the news.
They then break into a 15-minute joint soliloquy about how
wonderful that Topol guy is.
We drive back to the school, and my parents keep saying
how much it looks like Queens College. They think this is
very funny and use it between every stop sign. It makes me
nervous.
Before dropping them off at the hotel, I bring them to
my dorm. My mother hugs everyone, including the resident
fellows. My father wants to bring all the luggage in so that it
isn't stolen by one of the many toothpaste-hungry bandits
hiding in the shrubs of the Governor's Corner parking lot.
I then give them keys to the car. I refrain from telling
them not to drink, but if they do, to call me. It all feels so
strange. So surreal. So much like a "Charles in Charge"
dream sequence.
Then my Mom asks me if she has to go to the Founders'
Day Ball. I tell her no, as long as she sends a gift. She is con
fused. So am I.
It was so disorienting. I didn't understand my role. Was
I supposed to be a child, an adult or a tour guide? (For
weeks I had practiced walking backwards, pointing to my
right and saying, "Now on your 1eft....")
It wouldn't have been so bad if it weren't for the fact that
my Dad subscribes to The Daily. "So, is Louis Jackson's
League of Revolutionary Voters going to be indicted for
indirect charges in the upcoming ASSU refund elections?"
Throughout the weekend he managed to ask this question
in 28 different permutations, like some sort of Stanfordized
Beckett play.
The next day I give the tour. This is Aoxomoxoa, the
American Indian Theme House, and this i5....
"Who lives there?"
Mostly American Indian students, Mom.
She then starts to ask me things about Little Rock and
the Warren Court era and my Dad starts quoting John Wag
ner articles and throwing the word multiculturalism in ran
domly.
After two hours of this, I come to a sudden realization: It
is officially Dead Week. And I am dead.
My parents, meanwhile, want to go to Alcatraz, and they
heard something about a tactful dome at some museum
somewhere, and there's always that really twisty street
Finally it was Monday, and I plan my revenge. I make
them sit through some electrical engineering classes. I'm
not actually taking any; I'm just bitter about the walk up
Nob Hill.
Then, just as suddenly as they came, they left. And now
I have this empty feeling inside, like someone took away all
my Human League albums. I don't know who I am. I'm a
man without an identity. Kind of like Bob Hamrdla.
But that's all right for now. For my short time on this Isle
Paridiso I can accept my role as both child and adult. And
maybe even for the rest of my life. It's like some kind of sick
Hugh Hefner fantasy.
I can deal with it, though, as long as I can find some way
to cancel my dad's Daily subscription.

Joelstein cannot, for future reference, be used as a noun. His
column will now appear weekly in this very location, due to
the quick and unfortunate dismissal of Chris Harris from this
fine university; Thank God.
