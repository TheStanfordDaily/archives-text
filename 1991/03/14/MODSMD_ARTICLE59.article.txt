# Taking the Bungee Plunge
## 
### June Cohen 
June Ellen Cohen, a junior at Stanford University and Intermission editor of The
Stanford Daily, fell to an untimely death while bungee jumping on Saturday morn
ing.
Cohen, 21, was the beloved daughter of both Billy Crystal's brother's golf partner
and a former Revlon girl. A dedicated Daily reporter and editor, she was always
willing to go that extra mile for a story.
Cohen is survived by her family and her roommate, whom she sincerely hopes
will get straight A's as a result of this tragedy. Cohen's final words were, "Did you get
the picture, Chris? It'll make a great Intermission cover!"
She will be sorely missed.
OK, so 1 didn't die.
But I really thought I might.
A panoramic view of Napa Valley unfolded
around me as the hot-air balloon lifted off the
ground. However, all I could feel was a sense of
impending doom as the 120-foot bungee cord,
attached to harnesses around my waist and
chest, started to feel like a dead weight.
Standing on the tiny platform outside the
balloons basket, I clung desperately to the rail
ing for support. And then I made an almost
fatal mistake.
I looked down.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
Oh my GOD.
Whose idea was this anyway?

"How do you feel?" the man controlling the balloon asked me.
"Scared," I replied, exhaling rapidly, trying to avoid hyperventilating.
"That's all right. Everyone does."
"Small wonder," I thought, as the balloon, which was harnessed to the ground
to control its vertical and lateral movement, approached its maximum height of
300 feet.
No, I wasn't scared.
I was petrified.
Every instinct in my body was screaming, "This is stupid! Life is a good thing.
You shouldn't be doing this."
The whole idea of bungee jumping is counterintuitive. Thousands of years of
natural selection has produced a higher form of homo sapiens who know better
than to fling themselves to their deaths.
Yet there I was, about to dive face-first out of a hot air balloon towards the
very distant — and very hard — ground.
And there was no backing out.
Thousands — maybe even millions — of Daily readers were depending on my
story. Daily photographers were running around on the ground trying to get the
perfect angle to photograph my jump.
I was the only one up in the balloon.
It was all up to me.
Down below, the ground crew began their booming countdown," 5 — 4 — 3
— 2—"
I don't remember 1.
The next thing I knew I was in the air, holding my body in a graceful swan
dive, just as I had been instructed. To my bewilderment, I didn't feel like I was

felling. I felt suspended in air — and
time — arms and legs outstretched,
motionless, weightless.
When I had fallen the full length of
the cord, I flipped over smoothly and
rebounded several times as though I
were on the end of a rubber band. I
was slightly disconcerted by my inabil
ity to determine at any one point
whether I was ascending or descend
ing.
Then I was just swinging back and
forth on the end of the cord, back
arched, head thrown back, whooping
and laughing out loud as they lowered
the balloon to the ground.
I had done it.
Not only had I overcome my fear
(Did I mention that it took me until
this summer to dive off" the 15-foot

diving board?), I had experienced an
awe-inspiring sensation of
exhilaration I'd hardly known was
possible.
And I wanted to do it again. And
again. And again.
But bungee jumping isn't the most
accessible sport.
Not for the weak-of-stomach or the
empty-of-pocket, bungee jumping is
clearly geared towards thrill seekers
with money to spare.
Driving into the parking lot, my
friend and I got the distinct feeling
that our incomes were significandy
smaller than those of our fellow
jumpers. Our little hatchback was
overwhelmed by the six Jeep Cherokee
Chiefs already parked in the dirt clear
ing, and our fellow jumpers seemed to
exude a certain yuppie-with-money
to-spare air.
And, although most of the jumpers
were in some sense thrill-seekers, it
wouldn't really be accurate to say

bungee jumping is a risk-takers sport.
Of the approximately 70,000 jumps to
date in the United States, there's never
been a death or serious injury, accord
ing to the staff at Total Rebound, a
(new) company that arranged for our
bungee-jumping excursion.
And while some people are put off
by the idea of a hot-air balloon, this is
actually one of the only legal ways to
bungee jump. Bungeeing off of bridges
is rather common, but isn't legal
unless you actually own the bridge
you're jumping from.
The hot-air balloon used by Total
Rebound was specifically designed for
the sport of bungee jumping and is
approved by the Federal Aviation
Association (apparently, other compa
nies have closed for not receiving this
approval).
Attached to the balloon are three
intertwined bungee cords that are con
nected to the jumper on the other end.
The jumper has harnesses securely fas

tened around her waist and chest, and
the bungee cord is attached between
them, in the middle of her stomach.
The cords are attached to the harness
and the balloon by two carabineers
(metal mountain-climbing clips) on
each end, and the weakest link in the
multi-support system supports several
thousand pounds.
Some companies, such as Bungee
Adventures, arrange bungee jumping
from other high places such as cranes,
and use somewhat shorter cords.
Set up in an open field in Vallejo
(around an hour and a half from cam
pus), Total Rebound's balloon will be
inflated every weekend morning
throughout the spring. But the system
shuts down if the wind comes up, and
this could happen as early as 10 a.m.
— so if you plan to make the trip, be
sure to arrive early.
One jump with Total Rebound will
cost you $69; a jump with the 250-foot
cord goes for $79 and two jumps are
$99.
