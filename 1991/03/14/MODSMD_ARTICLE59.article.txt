# Taking the Bungee Plunge
## 
### June Cohen 
June Ellen Cohen, a junior at Stanford University and Intermission editor of The
Stanford Daily, fell to an untimely death while bungee jumping on Saturday morn
ing.
Cohen, 21, was the beloved daughter of both Billy Crystal's brother's golf partner
and a former Revlon girl. A dedicated Daily reporter and editor, she was always
willing to go that extra mile for a story.
Cohen is survived by her family and her roommate, whom she sincerely hopes
will get straight A's as a result of this tragedy. Cohen's final words were, "Did you get
the picture, Chris? It'll make a great Intermission cover!"
She will be sorely missed.
OK, so 1 didn't die.
But I really thought I might.
A panoramic view of Napa Valley unfolded
around me as the hot-air balloon lifted off the
ground. However, all I could feel was a sense of
impending doom as the 120-foot bungee cord,
attached to harnesses around my waist and
chest, started to feel like a dead weight.
Standing on the tiny platform outside the
balloons basket, I clung desperately to the rail
ing for support. And then I made an almost
fatal mistake.
I looked down.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
Oh my GOD.
Whose idea was this anyway?

"How do you feel?" the man controlling the balloon asked me.
"Scared," I replied, exhaling rapidly, trying to avoid hyperventilating.
"That's all right. Everyone does."
"Small wonder," I thought, as the balloon, which was harnessed to the ground
to control its vertical and lateral movement, approached its maximum height of
300 feet.
No, I wasn't scared.
I was petrified.
Every instinct in my body was screaming, "This is stupid! Life is a good thing.
You shouldn't be doing this."
The whole idea of bungee jumping is counterintuitive. Thousands of years of
natural selection has produced a higher form of homo sapiens who know better
than to fling themselves to their deaths.
Yet there I was, about to dive face-first out of a hot air balloon towards the
very distant — and very hard — ground.
And there was no backing out.
Thousands — maybe even millions — of Daily readers were depending on my
story. Daily photographers were running around on the ground trying to get the
perfect angle to photograph my jump.
I was the only one up in the balloon.
It was all up to me.
Down below, the ground crew began their booming countdown," 5 — 4 — 3
— 2—"
I don't remember 1.
The next thing I knew I was in the air, holding my body in a graceful swan
dive, just as I had been instructed. To my bewilderment, I didn't feel like I was
