# Need to Destress? Regress
## 
### Sarah Morisseau 
The Primal Scream just ain't what
it's cracked up to be.
It's OK, but you can't do it before
midnight — or any time besides Dead
Week — without getting The Look.
You know the one — people cock
their heads to the right, purse their lips
together and give you that disapprov
ing look, that Church Lady look.
So much for feeling better.
Instead of feeling like a ton of
bricks has been lifted from your shoul
ders, you feel more like somebody just
called you stupid and hit you over the
head with a nice-sized anvil.
And that's when you get that
incredible desire to be six again, to
have "big problems" like avoiding naps
and convincing your parents that first
graders don't need bedtimes.
That's when you want to go play in
a park, eat a softee ice cream cone and
laugh at a knock-knock joke, instead
of a political cartoon.
So do it.
Be a kid again.
Laugh, skip, dance. Do something
fun, just for fun. And if that's too
unproductive for you pre-profession
als, then be a kid for the sake of reliev
ing stress.
It works. Just be sure to have fun
doing it.
• Go play in the oval around 11
p.m., when the sprinklers are on. Bring

some friends and dance, cartwheel or
somersault until you're soaked and
laughing so hard you can't stand up
straight. And don't you dare think
about the water shortage.
• Color. Splurge a little and buy
yourself the Crayola 64-pack with the
built-in crayon sharpener.
There are all kinds of groovy colors
like periwinkle, cornflower and burnt
umber. Coloring books are optional...
walls and textbooks do just fine, just
like they did 15 years ago.
• Get a hippity-hop. You remember
— the big plastic ball things with a
head and handles that you sit on and
bounce.
Leave the bike or rollerblades at
home and hippity-hop to class,
through White Plaza and the Quad.
Have races through the dorm, bounc
ing off doors and disturbing all the
type-A personalities on your hall.
• Play legos. Build a spaceship and
fly it to the moon. Design a castle and
terrorize it with a ferocious dragon.
Civil engineers, construct a city —
without accounting for traffic conges
tion.
• Play hide-and-seek. Good hiding
spots: the Rodin Sculpture Garden, the
Claw, the roof of Meyer Library, on top
of the Thinker and, best of all, the
stacks at Green Library. The big, fero
cious purple chairs will eat "It" up and

put her to sleep before she has a chance
to find you.
• Watch "Sesame Street." It's on
every weekday. You're bound to learn
something.
• Go fly a kite. No insult intended.
• Eat kid food. Put away the granola
and salads, make yourself some Kool-
Aid and gorge yourself on Oreos.
Kool-Aid moustaches are key. And
remember, "a kid'll eat the middle of

an Oreo first and save the chocolate
cookie outside for last!"
• Read "Where the Wild Things
Are." Read it loudly. Roar Max's terri
ble roars and gnash your terrible teeth.
• Bug your little brother. If he's not
here, call Don Kennedy and ask him
about indirect cost policies.
• And if all else fails, call your
mommy.
