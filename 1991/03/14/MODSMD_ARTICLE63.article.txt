Something's
brewing at the
Tied House

To an East Coast beer-lover, the
decidedly West Coast concept of a
microbrewery seems ideal — what
could be better than a quality restau
rant that brews its own beer?
Unfortunately, it seemed like an
unreachable ideal. Oh sure, there were
a lot of microbreweries, but none of
them met my expectations. Either the
food was good but the beer wasn't, or
the beer was good but the food wasn't;
or both were good but the place was
one big pick-up joint. I was beginning
to think my expectations were too
high.
But then I went to the Tied House.
Looking more like a warehouse
than a dining establishment, the Tied
House is essentially one big room —
including the kitchen — with a lofted
ceiling. Spacious but crowded, the din
ing room has a casual, comfortable
atmosphere that is ideal for having
dinner with one friend or drinking
beer with several.
Did someone mention beer?
All brewed on the premises, the
beer at the Tied House is some of the
best in the Bay Area. Each night there

are nine different choices and all of
them are worth trying. My particular
favorites were the amber and the pas
sion. Amber was a reddish, full-bodied
brew (no, I don't know what full-bod
ied beer is, but it sounds good), some
what like Bass Ale; passion is a bit paler
and has a unique, fruity taste. Rumor
(actually the bartender) has it that the
stout is exceptionally good as well, but
being a person of small body, I quit
before I could get to it.
I figured, after being so pleased
with the quality of the drink, that the
food wouldn't hold up in comparison,
but I was wrong. In fact, I think I can
say with some certainty that the food
complemented the beer perfectly.
Which is, I believe, the point.
The appetizers ranged from garlic
bread with beer cheese to quesadillas
to fried calamari. It would be difficult
to say which best suited a pitcher, but
even more difficult to say which best
suited me. They were all fantastic, and
I was tempted to forget the main
course and just get more.
Good thing I didn't.
The entrees are not only delicious,
but fairly inexpensive as well (about
$10 each). My recommendation would
be the beer-mustard chicken and the
teriyaki grilled thresher shark.
Although both were served with
slightly oily vegetables and uninspiring
rice, they were good nonetheless.

I also sampled the smoked sausage
plate, which featured two types of
sausage (one spicy, one turkey) with
assorted cheeses, vegetables and grilled
onions. Though tasty, the platter was
advertised as being "enough for two,"
which it wasn't.
Which actually was OK, because it
left me room for the peanut butter pie.
Don't miss the peanut butter pie.
Frozen, with hot fudge poured lavishly
on top, the pie is so good, you can't
help but feel guilty. I did. But I'd do it
again.
And actually, I did — later that
week.

Wining and din
ing at Cafe Pro
Bono

Cruising down California Avenue,
you'd never notice Cafe Pro Bono,
tucked away on Birch Street. But just
because you may have missed it
doesn't mean it should be missed.
Cafe Pro Bono, a restaurant despite
what its name projects, is a peaceful,
romantic place to wine and dine that
special someone. Owned by Kurt
Unger, this establishment is composed
of a tiny, dimly lit dining room
adorned with posters — including one

of the consummate Hollywood couple
Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler.
Unger contributes to the feeling of
companionship through his warm,
personable manner and his ability to
maintain a wonderful rapport with his
customers — all of his customers.
Since the restaurant is small, Unger
can not only talk to everyone, but is
also able to cater to individual needs or
whims. He truly wants everyone to be
happy, at least while they are at Cafe
Pro Bono.
And once the food is served, one
can't help but be happy.
Cafe Pro Bono serves Italian cuisine
with a touch of California, and it does
it well. The appetizers were all fantastic
— from the traditional carpaccio to
the out-of-the-ordinary eggplant with
provolone in olive oil. Not to mention
the warm goat cheese salad and the
heart of palm vinaigrette.
For main courses, Cafe Pro Bono
has several daily specials (from $7.95
to $14.95) that change quite often. All
are as wonderful as the appetizers, and
are so artfully arranged on the plates
that they are as pleasant to look at as
they are to eat. Well, almost.
And the desserts. Oh, the desserts.
The desserts are exquisite; they're
all are made fresh by the chef, on loca
tion. There's no "right" decision, but if
you're a chocolate lover, do not miss
the chocolate decadence; it's a must.
