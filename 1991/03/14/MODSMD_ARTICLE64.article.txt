"Hamlet" is being produced by
American Conservatory Theater

For American Conservatory The
ater's "Hamlet," Paul Erskine has cre
ated a suspenseful musical score.
Drums beat erratically, and foreboding
notes rise up like apparitions. The pace
is threatening, the sound spellbinding,
and, if the essence of the music had
carried through, this "Hamlet" would
have been remarkable. But the haunt
ing introduction is followed by perfor
mances that lack mystery and duplic
ity.
Hamlet, played by Byron Jennings,
is not a tormented instigator, but a vic
tim who accepts his fateful course
without resistance or questioning. Jen
nings simply "gives in" to his part, and
appears to have no inner conflict. This
lack of emotional range can be seen in
the appearance of Hamlet's father's
ghost; the image is arresting, but seems
to have little effect on Hamlet himself.
Similarly, Claudius, played by
Lawrence Hecht, is poker-faced and
unemotional. The kitsch flag hanging
above the castle doors carries his

image, and it's clear he's stolen his
brother's crown and wife. But
Claudius' rise to power seem to be less
of a personal triumph than a social
one; he lacks the drive and energy of a
true manipulator.
Complete scenes are lacking drive
as well: The elaborate play within a
play is striking artistically, but its sig
nificance is obscured because
Claudius' reaction comes too late.
Most disappointing by far, though,
is the "To be or not to be" soliloquy,
for Hamlet reads it from a book. It's
not until the line "To sleep — per
chance to dream," that he puts down
the book.
There are some interesting twists to
this version of "Hamlet," however.
Most noticeably, the play is set in con
temporary Denmark.
And director John Fletcher uses
special effects to help convey the
drama. When Polonius (played by
Michael Winters, who skillfully injects
humor into a traditionally pedantic
role) is murdered, a symbolic death
figure, draped in black gauze, sits
motionless at the edge of Gertrude's'
bed.
Fletcher strives to be daring; unfor
tunately, at times, he sacrifices content
for novelty. After Erskine's haunting
score, I had higher hopes of where it all
might lead.
