John Champagne's first novel, "The Blue
Lady's Hands," was praised by Booklist as
being "the most accessible gay fiction since
Christopher Bram's 'Surprising Myself."'
I have read neither "The Blue Lady's
Hands" nor "Surprising Myself," so I don't
know how accessible they are. I do know,
however, that even though Will, the main
character in "When the Parrot Boy Sings," is a
homosexual male who cleans apartments and
makes collages, and I am a heterosexual
female who tries not to clean and failed cut
ting and pasting, I understood him, sympa
thized with him, and at times found myself
cheering him on.
The story is set in New York City, "years
ago, when no one really wanted to think
about how serious the [AIDS] situation was."
Champagne tells the whole story in Will's
voice, and Wdl is an amazing storyteller.
He lives in a house in Brooklyn with
Sylvia, an alcoholic lesbian. Will usually lies
to people about his profession, because "I
think of all the different things I do to earn
money, the day care and the cleaning and the
plant sitting ... and I'm afraid that if I say all

those things, I'll sound as if I don't really do
anything. So I usually lie, or else I say I'm an
artist."
Will wants a relationship; Will wants love;
Will wants people to stop eating meat and
start working for the good of everyone.
Of course, if Will's wants were realities,
there wouldn't be a book.
Will hates gay bars, but he keeps going to
them, "hoping that someone will give me a
break and talk to me so that I can deal with
that agony instead, the stupid questions
which I never know how to answer..."
In a gay bar one night he meets Dennis
and Scott, two older lovers who take him in as
their "Marxist child" and care for him in a
non-sexual way, though they admit they have
ulterior motives.
The book chronicles Will's relationship
with these two men, and his thoughts about
past lovers, Sylvia, love, passion and commit
ment.
But Will also finds time to talk about other
things.
"I wasn't the least bit surprised the day
that man went crazy and killed all those peo
ple at McDonald's. Anyone who has eaten
there often enough knows what kinds of
things go on in that place."
Will's problems with relationships are
manifested through his two mythical alter
egos, Fish Baby and Parrot Boy. Fish Baby is

intelligent and clairvoyant, but helpless on
land.
Parrot Boy chains himself to the floor
beside Fish Baby and watches over her when
she sleeps at night. He has arms and legs, but
no voice. He can only moan a horrid sort of
song.
"Whoever hears it recognizes the song of
the Parrot Boy, and no one ever forgets. And
as awful as it is for him, he loves the sound of
his voice. No words could ever hope to com
municate the meaning of his song. And if by
some miracle the Fish Baby could teach him
to speak, he would still sing his song in the
monstrous sounds of his parrot voice."
OK, so Will isn't a happy boy. But who is,
really?
This book moves easily from one chapter
to the next; it's not easy to put down. There's
no larger-than-life plot; this is just a story,
and a damn good one. After Will meets Den
nis and Scott, there's a degree of suspense
throughout the rest of the book. Will it end
like a romance novel, or a Woody Allen farce?
(Well, I'm not going to give that away — I've
already quoted most of the novel.)
Will (a great name, open to all sorts of
interpretation by English majors) has an
imaginative mind and an innocent heart, and
that's what makes this a great book- The
reader forgets Will's occupation and his sex
ual orientation and can concentrate on his
thoughts and feelings.
