Spring break books
The Joy Luck Club
Amy Tan
Ballantine Books, 332 pages, $5.95
This former bestseller is told in a series of short
chapters that alternate in perspective among two
generations, two continents and numerous charac
ters.
The stories center around four Chinese women,
who immigrate to the United States, and their Amer
ican-born daughters. The mothers meet weekly to
play mahjong; they call themselves the Joy Luck
Club.
Tan successfully combines several important
themes: mother-daughter relationships, the immi
grant experience and the generation gap. "The Joy
Luck Club" is delightful reading.
Presumed Innocent
Scott Turow
Warner Books, 421 pages, $5.95
Another former bestseller, also made into a hit
movie, "Presumed Innocent" is a truly great read. A
detective story, complete with corruption, adultery
and murder, Scott Turow's novel is full of likable and
sympathetic characters.
The suspense in this book makes it nearly impos
sible to put down. The only places where Turow fails
occur when he decides to muse on the meaning of
life, in the form of monologues by the book's first
person narrator.
Fortunately, these pseudo-profound passages are
few and far-between. And the last plot twist is guar
anteed to surprise even the most suspicious reader.
The Secret Pilgrim
John LeCarrt
Alfred A. Knopf, 335 pages, $21.95
John LeCarr£ is the best of the bunch. Agreed, spy
novels aren't great literature; plots are often pre
dictable, characters generally formulaic, and the
good guys always win.
The end of the Cold War has done wonders for
the genre, however. Now authors have to focus on
something besides KGB agents and nuclear weapons.
Still, these themes have been around for so long it's
hard to see them go.
