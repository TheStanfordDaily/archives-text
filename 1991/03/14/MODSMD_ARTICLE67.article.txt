A History of the World in 10' A Chapters
Julian Barnes
Vintage International, 307 pages, $9.95
Reviewed by Michael Drout
I don't like Julian Barnes; I think he's a
postmodern pain in the rear. And I thought
his "Flaubert's Parrot" was one of the most
pretentious, boring books I'd ever read.
So I wasn't expecting to enjoy Barnes'
latest book, "The History of the World in
10J4 Chapters," nearly as much as I did.
The book is a partially connected collec
tion of stories, essays and historical treat
ments of events that center around the myth
of Noah's ark. At times it seems as though
Barnes were given some kind of bizarre
assignment to write 10 pieces that each con
tained references to woodworms, the ark
and shipwrecks, but the book is nonetheless

fairly compelling.
"Parenthesis" is the best chapter in the
book. It is an essay on love and is truly the
most intelligent, thorough and engaging
writing on the topic that I have ever read.
In this piece all of Barnes' stylistic jazz
comes together. Image, metaphor, repeti
tion, literary reference and even reference to
stories from the earlier pieces in the book all
work in concert to create a well-argued and
genuinely moving essay. If "Parenthesis"
isn't included in next year's "Best American
Essays," I'll be shocked.
Another of the better stories in the book
is "The Stowaway," a description of the del
uge and Noah's ark from the point of view
of a woodworm. It's typically deconstruc
tionist and anti-religious in a predictable
way: Noah isn't very nice, man isn't very
nice, the Bible isn't quite correct... ad nau
seum. Still, the story is rather amusing.
"The Visitors," on the other hand, is a

chilling short story about a terrorist attack
on a tour group on the island of Crete that
leaves a reader both furious and torn. Prob
ably the most traditional of all the stories in
the book, it focuses on the torments of a
man caught between conflicting desires to
resist, to save life and to be true to himself.
This powerful story is followed by "The
Wars of Religion," an incredibly boring
account of woodworms put on trial by a
16th century French ecclesiastical court.
While it's understandable that Barnes
wishes to further his deconstructionist
agenda, and is using this farcical trial ar a
method to do so, the story is duller than
Umber to Eco at his most didactic. Tearing
out these pages would probably improve the
value of the book.
Perhaps the most difficult piece to clas
sify in"The History of the World in 10!4
Chapters" is "Shipwreck!" a hybrid of his
tory, essay, fiction and art criticism. "The

Wreck of the Medusa," the subject of a
famous painting, is followed from a histori
cal fiction perspective. The painting itself is
analyzed through an art history perspective
with only a bit of jargon. This is the most
intellectually challenging part of thf book,
though there are many.
Barnes has a large and powerful bag of
linguistic and technical tricks that he
doesn't hesitate to use. He is extremely
learned and doesn't hesitate to toss in refer
ences which readers without a strong CIV
background may miss. This virtuosity is,
strangely enough, most effective in the three
essays but feels overdone in the short sto
ries.
M A History of the World in 10'/$ Chap
ters" is a fairly difficult read that only
rewards in some of its chapters. That's not
to say it's a bad book, just possibly more
work than it's worth.
