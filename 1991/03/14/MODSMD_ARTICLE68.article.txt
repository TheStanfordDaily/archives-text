More than a collection of stories and
novels, Allan Gurganus' "White People" is a
collection of voices. And familiar voices, at
that. Three of the stories in Gurganus' sec
ond book are based on his own family and
his childhood in North Carolina.
"Bryan's" (i.e., Gurganus') father, the
World War II veteran who can't find any
thing worse than tent caterpillars to fight
anymore, puzzles sadly over the way his
eldest son — the artist-writer — turned out
and reflects that "At some point, you have
to decide with children whether you're
going to kill them or let them go."
Of all Gurganus' characters, it is this
voice that rings truest. "... It was right that

[Bryan] should be [at his brother's wed
ding], but I won't even begin to describe the
person, the creature, he brought along with
him. Everyone who saw this particular per
son immediately got very disturbed. This
particular person somehow managed to get
in and spoil about half of Bradley and
Elaine's wedding pictures... ."
But Gurganus' genius is not restricted to
the realm of the autobiographical. The sec
ond story in the volume takes the form of a
letter written by an older woman, and Gur
ganus' skill in capturing the voices of the
elderly is uncanny.
While visiting Africa with "Father Flana
gan's Tour of the World," this woman wit
nesses the death of an old photography
enthusiast and his wife, who are killed try
ing to photograph a mass revolutionary
uprising. "If I don't get this Africa business
laid out in the open," she tells the daughter
of the couple (rather prophetically, per

haps), "I know my dreams and housework
will stay like they are now, a big mess."
Yet, the voices of Gurganus' "white peo
ple" aren't always so convincing or so mov
ing. In one story, a dead Civil War soldier
visits his mother in a dream to reassure her
that "I am in my place here." The letter
from Walt Whitman to the grieving mother,
an actual letter that forms a sort of epigram
to the story, does not redeem it, and the
story's 19th century sentimentality does
nothing to illuminate 20th century lives, no
matter how hard it tries.
Humor, on the other hand, does redeem
a great deal of the collection. Gurganus has
mastered the understated humor of the dra
matic monologue, poking fun at his charac
ters — not uncritically, but always with the
utmost respect.
Nor is he afraid of a less subtle brand of
fun that verges on the Gothic. In "Cau

casian Nativity," the narrator relates how he
was born unexpectedly during a ladies'
bridge tournament, and how the fire truck
and ambulance that were called to the scene
by two separate panicking Southern ladies
collided at the corner in front of the house,
leaving the hostess to act as midwife in the
disaster that had been her immaculate
kitchen.
"White People" stands as a testament to
its author's faith in the value of storytelling,
in its power to make people know and love
each other and ourselves a little better.
Despite their sometimes overbearing senti
mentality, Gurganus' stories justify that
faith.
When the last voice signs off, saying,
"There, I've told you. I'll feel better. Thank
you very much," the reader feels a bit like
Bryan's father upon the receipt of a drawing
his son has done of him.
