Who needs a
plot when
you've got
action?
"The Hard Way,"
starring Michael J. Fox
and James Woods
If you want good action, acceptable
comedy and a non-threatening plot,
go see "The Hard Way."
If you want an Academy Award
winner, save your $6.50.
"The Hard Way" definitely falls
into that category my Dad so thought
fully labels as "a shoot-'em-up hum
dinger." This is only to be expected
from director John Badham, who
packs his resume with such action clas
sics as "Bird on a Wire" and "Blue
Thunder." But, besides the brutal car
crashes and the slow-motion leaps
from high places, the film also adds a
comedic twist worthy of a few heartfelt
guffaws.
Michael J. Fox plays Nick Lang, a
Hollywood movie star anxious to pre
pare for his next role by experiencing
the life of a New York cop.
Lang subsequently latches on to
tough guy Lt. John Moss, played by
James Woods, who is a very unwilling
subject for the study. Throughout the
film, we watch Lang's attempt to "be"
Moss by copying every, and I do mean
every, move he makes.
The Fox-Woods combination
works fairly well as the two play off
each other in an amusing love-hate
relationship. Although Woods' forte is
usually straight drama, he pulls off
some particularly funny scenes. In one
incident, for example, Woods attempts
to work out a tiff he's having with his
girlfriend by play-acting with Fox,
who, by the way, can mimic a female
very convincingly.
Oh ... did I mention that Penny
Marshall plays a small role in the film?
I thought I'd better credit her appear
ance in case there were any diehard
"Laverne and Shirley" fans out there
ready to spend some money to see
Penny again.
So that's the good stuff. I could go

on about the stuff that's not so good,
such as the film's tendency to drag and
its focus on action rather than plot but
I don't think that's really necessary. By
now, I'm sure it's clear that "The Hard
Way" is a movie to go see for some
mindless, shallow and, dare I say ...
fun entertainment. Definitely
escapism at its best.

The 'nasty' truth
about a German
town
"The Nasty Girl,"
starring Lena Stoltz.
Set in a small town in Germany
during World War 11, "The Nasty Girl"
chronicles one woman's lifelong quest
for the truth behind her city's involve
ment with the Nazis.
Lena Stoltz plays Sonya Wegmus,
the "nasty girl" who shakes up her lit
tle German town by uncovering the
city's history during the Third Reich.
Based on a true story, the movie
traces Sonya's life as she develops from
a cute, playful girl into an awkward,
bright adolescent and then a charis
matic woman. Developments in her
own life provide the background for
her unsettling discoveries about the
involvement of the town's clergy with
the Nazi movement.
During Sonya's teenage years, her
single-minded intellectual curiosity is
sparked by one of her teachers. She
diligently researched an essay contest
topic regarding the Third Reich in her
town in high school, but was forced to
leave the essay unfinished due to lack
of information.
A marriage and two children later,
Sonya returns to the academic world
to write a book on the essay she could
not complete as a teen-ager.
Her quest for the truth becomes an
obsession, and only undaunted persis
tence and patience lead her to the
'nasty' facts about members of her
community.
