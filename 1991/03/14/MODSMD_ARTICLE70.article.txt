# Lots O' things to be happy about at Stanford
## 
### June Cohen the late-night Daily crew Editorial staff 
Smiling during Dead Week can be dangerous.
"What are you so damn happy about?" people
growl, peering out from behind their computers.
"I bet you're done, aren't you? Aren't you?" they
snarl angrily as they stomp past you on their way

to Meyer Library.
They resent your happiness. They want
you to share their complete and abject mis
ery.

Don't do it.
Keep smiling. No matter how bad things are, no
matter how stressed you feel, there are still things
to be happy about.
Usually.
You just have to look a little harder for them.
The inspiration for this article, a pocket-sized
book called "14,000 Things to be Happy About,"
by Barbara Ann Kipfer, was entertaining, but the
entries were somewhat obscure, like "six" and"the
University of Alabama" and worst of all, "tuition."
(What school do her kids go to?)
So here's a few pockets of happiness you have
access to right here at Stanford. They just might get
you through to vacation with a smile —
albeit a forced one — on your lips. And

remember, these are just ideas. Don't
feel compelled to restrict your sources
of happiness to the suggestions offered
here.
And don't look for "sex;" it's
not on the list.

So here's a few pockets of happiness you have
access to right here at Stanford. They just might get
you through to vacation with a smile —
albeit a forced one — on your lips. And

remember, these are just ideas. Don't
feel compelled to restrict your sources
of happiness to the suggestions offered
here.
And don't look for "sex;" it's
not on the list.

Smiling during Dead Week can be dangerous.
"What are you so damn happy about?" people
growl, peering out from behind their computers.
"I bet you're done, aren't you? Aren't you?" they
snarl angrily as they stomp past you on their way

to Meyer Library.
They resent your happiness. They want
you to share their complete and abject mis
ery.

Don't do it.
Keep smiling. No matter how bad things are, no
matter how stressed you feel, there are still things
to be happy about.
Usually.
You just have to look a little harder for them.
The inspiration for this article, a pocket-sized
book called "14,000 Things to be Happy About,"
by Barbara Ann Kipfer, was entertaining, but the
entries were somewhat obscure, like "six" and"the
University of Alabama" and worst of all, "tuition."
(What school do her kids go to?)
So here's a few pockets of happiness you have
access to right here at Stanford. They just might get
you through to vacation with a smile —
albeit a forced one — on your lips. And

remember, these are just ideas. Don't
feel compelled to restrict your sources
of happiness to the suggestions offered
here.
And don't look for "sex;" it's
not on the list.
