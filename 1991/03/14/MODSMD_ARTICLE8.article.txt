# NCAA violations difficult to avoid, track coach says
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Staff writer 
Admitting he committed sev
eral NCAA violations, Stanford
track coach Brooks Johnson said
that NCAA rules are often diffi
cult to interpret and that it is "vir
tually impossible not to run afoul"
of the association's guidelines.
Business Prof. Jerry Porras, a
Stanford faculty representative to
the NCAA, announced last week
that Johnson was involved with
three minor violations involving
the improper entertainment of
high school coaches and families.
The five-month investigation
turned up the violations, which
were committed over a two-year
period.
"We got singled out and right
fully so because we broke the
rules," Johnson said in an inter
view earlier this week. When deal
ing with ambiguous NCAA rules,
"you're going to get that kind of
problem," he added.
One violation concerned
improper entertainment of high
school coaches at off-campus
restaurants. For instance, John
son has taken several local high
school track coaches to dinner at
the Mac Arthur Park Restaurant.
Johnson said he never tried to
hide the fact that he had taken the
coaches out for dinner and did not
consider it a recruiting violation
because the dinner was an organi

zational meeting concerning the
Stanford Invitational. The invita
tional involves both high school
and college track athletes and
occurs over spring break.
"I can't put on a Stanford
Invite without a high school sanc
tion. You talk to these people
about how the high school aspect
of the meet will be conducted,"
Johnson said.
He added that in general NCAA
rules are difficult to follow
because they can be interpreted
differently by various NCAA rep
resentatives.
"I once called the NCAA up and
said, 'Can the Puma shoe com
pany pay to send our athletes to
[the Athletic Congress] national
championships?' Between Mon
day and Thursday I got three dif
ferent interpretations. So they
don't even know how to interpret
the rules," he said.
Another violation involved tak
ing athletes' parents and siblings
out to lunch on University money.
Here again, Johnson said, the
rules were ambiguous.
"Let's say an athlete's parents
join the booster club. I take them
to lunch as parents, it's illegal. I
take them to lunch and put down
boosters, its perfectly legal â€” the
exact same people," Johnson said.
He added that he feels he has been
"penalized for telling the truth"
while other athletic programs that
are doing the same thing are not

being investigated.
Johnson said he hopes the
investigation and the negative
press it has generated will not
affect the performance of the
track team.
Several track athletes said they
do not believe the findings wiil
hamper progress or hurt team
morale.
"It wasn't viewed as the end of
the world by anybody," said senior
Chris Rae, a distance runner. "We
will accomplish what we want to
get done and be a successful part
of the community"
Team members have known
about the investigation for several
months. Johnson "wanted us to
know so if we heard anything we
would know the truth," said
junior Jodie Bilotta.
Still, Bilotta said the publicity
was a bit of a shock. "I first saw it
on the front sports page of the
Peninsula Times Tribune. It was
kind of weird. Track is so low on
the totem pole. It's like 'Why us?"'
she said.
"Not to make light of the viola
tions, but they are so minor. Why
would they waste their time on
this when other programs are
doing so much worse?" she added.
Johnson expects the track pro
gram to ultimately benefit from
the investigation. "If we violate
the rules we are not enhancing
our program by doing that," he
said.
