# Police break up 'Calcutta'
## Illegal gambling pool was Toyon tradition 
### Peter Robison Staff writer 
Stanford Police raided a Toyon Hall eating club
Tuesday night, breaking up a basketball gambling
pool and turning away 150 students who had
planned to place bets.
Police also seized a Macintosh computer and
computer disks that they say may contain infor
mation about the pool and about bets made on
teams in the NCAA men's basketball tournament.
The gambling pool had been a long-standing
Toyon tradition, with last year's pot reaching
$30,000. Police officials estimated that this year's
payoff might have been as high as $50,000.
Police made no arrests but did not rule out the
possibility of pressing charges against the pool's
three student organizers, whose names were not
released.
"We can't say yet if we plan to press charges,"
said Sgt. Del Bandy, the officer in charge of the
raid. "We will know for sure after we look fat the

evidence] in the computer."
The pool, known as "Calcutta," has been held
annually at Toyon for at least 10 years, according
to Toyon residents who participated in the past.
This year's meeting took place at Barristers, one
of the Toyon Eating Clubs.
"This was a very large operation, very sophisti
cated and very illegal," Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer said. He added that the pool was
extremely well-planned, leading him to character
ize the organizers as "typical Stanford entre
preneurs."
Niemeyer said he spoke to another police offi
cer who specializes in bookmaking cases and "was
very impressed" by the organization of the pool.
The organizers would have accepted checks as
payment, Niemeyer said, a procedure that is "very
unusual for this kind of operation."
A police report of the incident will be sent to
the district attorney's office, Niemeyer noted.
Bandy said running a gam
bling pool would be a felony in
violation of California Penal Code
337 A, Section 1, which prohibits
bookmaking.
Despite the raid, Toyon resi

dents still consider the pool a
dorm tradition.
"It's been going on for a long
time," said one Toyon resident, a
junior.
"I had always thought [a police
raid] was a possibility," said a
sophomore Toyon resident. "But
so many people knew about [the
pool] that we figured the police
had known about it for years and

were just liberal about it."
But this is the first year the
police were aware of the pool,
Niemeyer said. An anonymous
source tipped off the Santa Clara
County Sheriffs Office Tuesday
afternoon. The tip was then
relayed to the Stanford Police,
Niemeyer added.
Three uniformed police offi
cers and two plainclothes officers

arrived at Barristers about 7:40
p.m., Bandy said, 20 minutes
before the source had said the
gambling would begin.
The police intentionally
arrived early because they did not
intend to make large-scale
arrests, Bandy said. "Our intent
was to inform people [about the
pool's illegality] and stop it from
happening," he said.
