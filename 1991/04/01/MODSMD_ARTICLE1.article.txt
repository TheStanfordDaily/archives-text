# Schwarzkopf to speak at Commencement
## Gardner cancels appearance because of scheduling conflict 
### Cecil St. Thomas Editorial staff 
The 100 th class of graduating seniors
had better not pout anymore, because
Stormin' Norman is coming to town.
John Gardner, the designated gradua
tion speaker, has canceled his June 16
speech because of "scheduling conflicts,"
and in his place the University has secured
the appearance of Norman Schwarzkopf,
central commander of the Persian Gulf war
allied forces.
Schwarzkopf said in a telephone inter
view yesterday from his Washington, D.C.
home that he is "very touched" that an aca
demic institution has invited him to speak.

"l want to tell all the youngsters out there
to be proud of our country, and the only way
to become proud Americans is through edu
cation."
Schwarzkopf explained that it is not
enough that the United States compete well
in the battle Held. "We want our kids to do
well in math and science, in geography, in
history . . . especially our own history."
The military hero added that American
history is about "democracy and freedom
from aggression." The Gulf war, he said, is
a new page of this history but not a new
chapter because "it is a continuation of the
democratic tradition established by our
founding fathers."
Gardner, who is the Haas Centennial

Professor of Public Service and a Stanford
graduate, said he has to go to Cambridge,
Mass., in June to "take care of some family
business" and could not attend the Stan
ford graduation. "I deeply regret this
scheduling conflict. I think the graduates
will enjoy Norman a lot."
Gardner denied that he was pressured to
cancel his appearance by complaints that
his name is not instantly recognizable.
Many graduating seniors have said that
Gardner holds no special appeal for them or
their parents because he is not a nationally
renowned character.
Senior Class President Elizabeth Lam
bird defended the graduation speaker selec
tion committee's original choice. "Gard

ner's got an impressive resume. What more
could you want?"
Gardner served as secretary of Health,
Education and Welfare under President
Lyndon Johnson. In 1970 he founded Com
mon Cause, a citizen watchdog organiza
tion intended to hold the federal govern
ment accountable for its action.
Lambird did, however, acknowledge that
the University "pulled it off real well" in
getting Schwarzkopf as a last-minute
replacement. "This time no one is going to
complain about obscurity," she said.

versity President Donald Kennedy, said
