# Stanford contests several facts from hearing
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
At a congressional hearing last month, Rep.
John Dingell rattled off an embarrassingly long
list of lush Hoover House purchases that had
been included in Stanford's indirect cost billings
during the last decade. Dingell's numerous exam
ples of "luxuries masquerading as overhead" sub
sequently received a great deal of play in the
press.
But several of Dingell's assertions were not all
they appeared to be, Stanford officials said last
week.
In a "fact sheet" released to the press, the Uni
versity contested a handful of Dingell's state
ments about what had been included in the
Hoover House account, 23 percent of which is
charged to the government under an agreement
with the Navy.

Among Stanford's objections:
• "A pair of George II lead urns at a 'special
price' of $12,084," mentioned by Dingell in his
opening statement.
The urns were purchased by Stanford in 1987
for $1,284, one-tenth of the amount Dingell
stated, and returned two weeks later. University
officials produced documentation showing the
transactions. The urns were never included in
Stanford's indirect cost billing, they say.
• "$7,000 in sheets for [University President
Donald Kennedy's] enlarged bed," another item
mentioned in the Michigan Democrat's opening
remarks.
Stanford officials say they can find no evidence
of such a purchase. The closest they've come is a
bill for $184.04 from Neiman-Marcus in 1987. It
is possible that Dingell was referring to one of
many purchases of tablecloths
and napkins for Hoover House
events, Stanford officials say.
More than $20,000 was spent on
table linens at the president's res
idence during the last decade.
• "An early 19th-century Ital
ian fruitwood commode at
$1,200."
Dingell, who has compared
Stanford's situation to the
defense contractor overbillings of
the mid-1980s, said Stanford's
purchase of the commode made
"Secretary Weinberger look poor
with his $600 toilet seat."
The commode in question is a
chest of drawers in Hoover House,
not a toilet as Dingell's statement

implied, Stanford officials say.
They released a photo of the piece
of furniture last week. Part of one
year's depreciation of the com
mode was charged to the govern
ment, totaling $28.
Staff members of the subcom
mittee have declined to comment
on Stanford's contentions. They
say Stanford has much larger con
cerns right now and should not be
bickering about individual contro
versial items.
At the hearing, federal auditors
recommended that Stanford's
indirect cost rate be knocked
down from 78 to 52 percent — a
move that would cost the Univer
sity about $30 million a year.
Stanford's future rate is currently
the subject of negotiations with
Navy representatives.
"That's what Stanford should
be focusing on," said one congres
sional investigator, who spoke on
the condition of anonvmitv Con

testing individual items "is just an
attempt to throw the hound off
the scent," she said.
Stanford officials say they are
not trying to make excuses or
divert attention from larger
issues, but would like the record
to be accurate.
"The only point I'm trying to
make is that members of the
Stanford family shouldn't reach
conclusions about what's going on
at Stanford on the basis of incor
rect reports in newspapers,"
Kennedy said in an interview last
week.
Several of the purchases in
question have received prominent
attention in newspapers and mag
azines in the Bay Area and across
the country.
In a recent editorial, the San
Francisco Examiner declared that
Kennedy was the "Leona Helms
ley of university presidents." A
Los Angeles Times column com

pared Kennedy to Imelda Marcos.
A political cartoon in the San Jose
Mercury News depicted Kennedy
and his wife Robin in a bed that's
labeled as "a federally subsidized
Stanford research facility."
And a column in Newsweek by
Robert Samuelson said Kennedy's
handling of Stanford's contro
versy revealed "a loose morality
found all too often among the
elite." Samuelson concluded:
"Sleaze knows no class."
Larry Horton, associate vice
president for public affairs, said
such attacks on Kennedy probably
would not have occurred had
errors in the hearing not been
widely reported as facts in the
press.
"We're not trying to find
excuses," Horton said. But some
press reports have left the public
with a "terrible misimpression,"
he explained. "The mere notion of
$7,000 dollar sheets rattles and

jars all sensible people."
Reporters should have been
more diligent about checking
their facts, Kennedy said.
"A lot of those errors have sim
ply been repeated in the press
without any attempt at verifica
tion," he said. "It seems to me
that journalists are under some
obligation to verify things."
In January, Stanford voluntar
ily withdrew more than $500,000
in indirect costs from the past
decade, including all expenses
associated with Hoover House.
The withdrawal was prompted by
revelations that Stanford had
included thousands of dollars in
flower arrangements, cedar-lined
closets and a refurbished piano in
the account which is charged in
part to the government.
Kennedy maintains that such
Hoover House charges are "tech
nically allowable," but are too dif
ficult to explain to the public.

A political cartoon in the San Jose
Mercury News depicted Kennedy
and his wife Robin in a bed that's
labeled as "a federally subsidized
Stanford research facility."
And a column in Newsweek by
Robert Samuelson said Kennedy's
handling of Stanford's contro
versy revealed "a loose morality
found all too often among the
elite." Samuelson concluded:
"Sleaze knows no class."
Larry Horton, associate vice
president for public affairs, said
such attacks on Kennedy probably
would not have occurred had
errors in the hearing not been
widely reported as facts in the
press.
"We're not trying to find
excuses," Horton said. But some
press reports have left the public
with a "terrible misimpression,"
he explained. "The mere notion of
$7,000 dollar sheets rattles and

jars all sensible people."
Reporters should have been
more diligent about checking
their facts, Kennedy said.
"A lot of those errors have sim
ply been repeated in the press
without any attempt at verifica
tion," he said. "It seems to me
that journalists are under some
obligation to verify things."
In January, Stanford voluntar
ily withdrew more than $500,000
in indirect costs from the past
decade, including all expenses
associated with Hoover House.
The withdrawal was prompted by
revelations that Stanford had
included thousands of dollars in
flower arrangements, cedar-lined
closets and a refurbished piano in
the account which is charged in
part to the government.
Kennedy maintains that such
Hoover House charges are "tech
nically allowable," but are too dif
ficult to explain to the public.
At a congressional hearing last month, Rep.
John Dingell rattled off an embarrassingly long
list of lush Hoover House purchases that had
been included in Stanford's indirect cost billings
during the last decade. Dingell's numerous exam
ples of "luxuries masquerading as overhead" sub
sequently received a great deal of play in the
press.
But several of Dingell's assertions were not all
they appeared to be, Stanford officials said last
week.
In a "fact sheet" released to the press, the Uni
versity contested a handful of Dingell's state
ments about what had been included in the
Hoover House account, 23 percent of which is
charged to the government under an agreement
with the Navy.

Among Stanford's objections:
• "A pair of George II lead urns at a 'special
price' of $12,084," mentioned by Dingell in his
opening statement.
The urns were purchased by Stanford in 1987
for $1,284, one-tenth of the amount Dingell
stated, and returned two weeks later. University
officials produced documentation showing the
transactions. The urns were never included in
Stanford's indirect cost billing, they say.
• "$7,000 in sheets for [University President
Donald Kennedy's] enlarged bed," another item
mentioned in the Michigan Democrat's opening
remarks.
Stanford officials say they can find no evidence
of such a purchase. The closest they've come is a
bill for $184.04 from Neiman-Marcus in 1987. It
is possible that Dingell was referring to one of
many purchases of tablecloths
and napkins for Hoover House
events, Stanford officials say.
More than $20,000 was spent on
table linens at the president's res
idence during the last decade.
• "An early 19th-century Ital
ian fruitwood commode at
$1,200."
Dingell, who has compared
Stanford's situation to the
defense contractor overbillings of
the mid-1980s, said Stanford's
purchase of the commode made
"Secretary Weinberger look poor
with his $600 toilet seat."
The commode in question is a
chest of drawers in Hoover House,
not a toilet as Dingell's statement

implied, Stanford officials say.
They released a photo of the piece
of furniture last week. Part of one
year's depreciation of the com
mode was charged to the govern
ment, totaling $28.
Staff members of the subcom
mittee have declined to comment
on Stanford's contentions. They
say Stanford has much larger con
cerns right now and should not be
bickering about individual contro
versial items.
At the hearing, federal auditors
recommended that Stanford's
indirect cost rate be knocked
down from 78 to 52 percent — a
move that would cost the Univer
sity about $30 million a year.
Stanford's future rate is currently
the subject of negotiations with
Navy representatives.
"That's what Stanford should
be focusing on," said one congres
sional investigator, who spoke on
the condition of anonvmitv Con

testing individual items "is just an
attempt to throw the hound off
the scent," she said.
Stanford officials say they are
not trying to make excuses or
divert attention from larger
issues, but would like the record
to be accurate.
"The only point I'm trying to
make is that members of the
Stanford family shouldn't reach
conclusions about what's going on
at Stanford on the basis of incor
rect reports in newspapers,"
Kennedy said in an interview last
week.
Several of the purchases in
question have received prominent
attention in newspapers and mag
azines in the Bay Area and across
the country.
In a recent editorial, the San
Francisco Examiner declared that
Kennedy was the "Leona Helms
ley of university presidents." A
