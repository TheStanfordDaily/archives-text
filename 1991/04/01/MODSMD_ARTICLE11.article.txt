# Start spreading the news: Card captures NIT
## 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
NEW YORK - When the Stanford
men's basketball team hit the road two
weeks ago to continue play in the National
Invitation Tournament, the Cardinal had
one clearly-defined destination and about
one thousand obstacles in its way.
The destination? Madison Square Gar
den and the NIT title.

Cardinal 78

Sooners 72

Stanford wins NIT title.
The odds? Let's put it this way: To
become NIT champion, the Cardinal would
have to win more road games in 10 days
than it had in the previous three months. It
would have to deal with an odyssey that
eventually covered five states, six airports,
four (or was it five?) hotels, three time
zones and included taking finals and writ
ing papers in hotels in Madison, Wis., Car
bondale, 111., St. Louis and New York.
And — just to put everything in its
proper perspective — to capture the NIT
title, the Cardinal would have to win more
postseason games in two weeks than Stan
ford had won in the last 75 years.
No problem.
Stanford won its first postseason cham
pionship in 49 years last Wednesday, down
ing the Oklahoma Sooners 78-72 in the NIT
finals in New York's Madison Square Gar
den. The victory, which capped a remark
able five-game postseason run, raised the
team's final record to 20-13.

"It's a little bit unbelievable to win five
straight like we have and be the champi
ons," said Stanford coach Mike Mont
gomery after all five of his starters scored in
double figures against the Sooners. The win
was the 100 th of Montgomery's five-year
career at Stanford.
"We've played very, very well in this
tournament," Montgomery said. "We
played so much better basketball in this
tournament than we did in January and
February. It just seemed to come together
for us."
Indeed it did. Consider that:
• The Cardinal's five-game winning
streak was the team's longest of the season;
• Stanford was 3-9 on the road in the
regular season, 4-0 in the NIT;
• After shooting .481 from the floor in
the regular season, the Cardinal shot .596
in its first three NIT games (a 93-86 win
over Houston at home, an 80-72 win at Wis
consin and a 78-68 win at Southern Illinois)
and finished the tournament hitting at a
.528 clip; and
• The Cardinal defense held its final two
opponents, Massachusetts and Oklahoma,
to a miserable .403 shooting performance
and kept the Sooners 26 points below their
season scoring average.
Not bad. "Every game of the tournament
was just a better and better team effort,"
said guard Kenny Ammann, who had 22
points in the title game and was named to
the all-tourney team. "I can't imagine a bet
ter way to go out. This was more fun than
the NCAAs ever would've been: No media
pressure, no attention, just going on the
road not knowing where we'd play next.
"We knew if we played like we were capa
ble, we'd keep playing. If not, we'd go home.

Andrew Vlahov and coach Mike Montgomery share a celebratory moment after the Cardinal's 78-72 victory In the Nation
al Invitation Tournament Championship game. Stanford's glorious run in the NIT was due in large part to Vlahov's return
from injury.
. .. This was a lot of fun. It's the way bas
ketball should be."
Ammann was joined on the all-NIT team
by Andrew Vlahov, who had 34 points, 22
rebounds and 11 assists in the final two
games. In the Cardinal's 73-71 squeaker
over UMass in the semifinals in New York,
Vlahov went 12-for-12 from the line,
including two shots with 5.7 seconds left
that sealed the win.
"I don't even want to imagine what it
would have been like tonight without (Vla
hov)," said Montgomery after the title
game. "He does so much for us: He plays
smart, he's so strong, he's such a team
leader. ... I don't know that the MVP
shouldn't go to our trainer."
That would be team trainer Dake
Walden, who deserves a great deal of credit
for Vlahov's return: After the senior for
ward had surgery to remove two bone spurs
from his right ankle in January, Walden got
him back into game shape faster than any
one thought possible. In the five NIT
games, Vlahov averaged 12 points and
seven rebounds in 34 minutes each time
out.
With all due respect to Walden and Vla
hov, however, center Adam Keefe already
had the tournament MVP award locked up.
Keefe scored 23 per game in the NIT, pulled
down 11 boards a contest and led the team
in scoring in three of the games, including a
career-high 33 points and 14 rebounds at
Wisconsin. His tournament performance
helped him break school single-season
records for field goals (252), points (709),
points per game (21.5), free throws made
(203), free throws attempted (252), and
minutes played (1,204, or 36.5 per game).
Ironically, in the finals against the Soon
ers Keefe had the least points among the
five starters, as Oklahoma's
sagging/pounding zone held him to 12, his
third-lowest total of the season. Keefe was
so annoyed he couldn't stop grinning after
ward.
"People have said all year that we're a
one-player team, and tonight we proved
that's not true," Keefe said. "That's why we
won this game: Everyone had to come
together. This was a complete, sound vic
tory and we couldn't be happier."
"They're an outstanding team, a tough
team," agreed Oklahoma coach Billy
Tubbs, who watched most of the game on
ESPN after catching two ultra-quick tech
nicals in the first half. "They played real
well and deserve a lot of respect."
Stanford may get some of that respect
now, after spending long stretches of the
season not living up to preseason expecta
tions. "I saw the basketball team the last
three weeks that we expected to have all
along," Montgomery said.
He didn't see it, however, in the first half
of the title game. The Sooners (who fin
ished the season 20-15) rode the inside
game of center Brian Sallier and the outside
game of guard Brent "Shoot-it-as-soon-as
you-touch-it" Price to a 39-34 advantage at
the half. Price and Sallier each had 17
points in the first half, while at the other
end the Cardinal was making only 11 of its
first 28 shots and turning the ball over 12
times against the Sooners' 2-3 zone.
Oklahoma pressed most of the game, but
— just as it had done all tournament — the

Cardinal handled the press easily. In the
first half, though, Stanford would usually
beat the press, set up in the halfcourt. . .
and then turn the ball over.
"The first half I don't think was really
characteristic of how we'd played the last
few games," Montgomery said.
Even with the woes, two things did go
right for the Cardinal in the first half. The
first was that Vlahov and Deshon Wingate
were absolutely crushing Oklahoma for
wards Kermit Holmes and Jeff Webster.
The Sooner forwards, who normally score
33 a game, were a stellar 0-for-12 in the
first half (a remarkable second-half recov
ery got them up to 2-for-19).
The second plus for Stanford was that
Tubbs received an early boot courtesy of an
overly-anal official. With the score tied at
26 and 4:38 left in the half, Keefe caught a
pass in the paint, turned to the hoop, low
ered his shoulder and practically impaled
Holmes, who fell to the floor. No call was
made, and after Keefe missed the shot,
Sooner Terry Evans fouled Vlahov going for
the rebound.
Tubbs, apparently, was rather perplexed
about the no-call on Keefe's charge — if
Holmes had been hit any harder he would
have ended up in the 14th row — and pro
ceeded to politely inquire as to what was up.
Technical No. 1. Then Tubbs asked what
the technical was for. Technical No. 2. Bye.
"That's one of the most disappointing
things that's ever happened to me," Tubbs
said. "I don't think I deserved either techni
cal. I did not use profanity, I did not holler
at the official. I think I deserved a better
fate than that."
Tubbs' idea to improve the officiating? "I
would suggest they take a urine specimen."
Meanwhile, back on the court, Vlahov
was hitting both his free throws, John
Patrick was hitting all four of the technical
free throws, and then, only 12 seconds later,
Ammann was swishing a three from the left
side to make it 35-26.
And so, with the momentum firmly on
Stanford's side. . . the Cardinal decided not
to score for the next 4:26.
The Sooners, on the other hand, went on
a slightly-peeved 13-0 tear to take the lead
at the half. Price had nine of those 13, and
scored five quick ones at the start of the sec
ond to up the Sooner lead to 46-37. (Price
was then completely shut down by Marcus
Lollie the rest of the game.) A 20-2 run.
Eighteen minutes left.
And so, with the momentum firmly on
Oklahoma's side. . . . the Sooners got
outscored 18-6 in the next six minutes.
Wingate had seven points during that
stretch, as Oklahoma switched from its 2-3
zone to a 1-3-1 trap to try to stem the flow.
After a Lollie turnover the first time down,
though, the Cardinal picked the 1-3-1 apart
to go on a 7-0 run that made it 55-52 Stan
ford with eleven minutes to go.
Six minutes later it was 60-all, and then
the next seven possessions decided the
game. Wingate hit Keefe for a layup —
Keefe's only points of the half — to make it
62-60. Then, after a Sooner miss and a trav
eling violation by Wingate, Oklahoma's
Mike Harris tried to pass the ball in to Web
ster.
I'll take that! Keefe got one huge mitt on

the ball, which ended up in Lollie's hands,
and then at the other end Ammann and
Vlahov played a two-man game in the left
corner. Vlahov kicked it from the post to
Ammann, who put it right back inside.
Evans doubled down to guard Vlahov, leav
ing Ammann open for the return pass, just
beyond the three-point line. . . .
Swish. Five-point lead.
Five seconds later Evans passed the ball

near midcourt, looking for Roland Ware,
and found Vlahov instead. Vlahov was
fouled from behind by Ware, and the two
free throws made it 67-60 with 3:12 to go.
The Sooners got no closer than three the
rest of the way.
NIT champs. "I just can't tell you what a
great win this is for us," Montgomery said.
"It's just very gratifying for the kids. This
is something they'll never forget."

Even with the woes, two things did go
right for the Cardinal in the first half. The
first was that Vlahov and Deshon Wingate
were absolutely crushing Oklahoma for
wards Kermit Holmes and Jeff Webster.
The Sooner forwards, who normally score
33 a game, were a stellar 0-for-12 in the
first half (a remarkable second-half recov
ery got them up to 2-for-19).
The second plus for Stanford was that
Tubbs received an early boot courtesy of an
overly-anal official. With the score tied at
26 and 4:38 left in the half, Keefe caught a
pass in the paint, turned to the hoop, low
ered his shoulder and practically impaled
Holmes, who fell to the floor. No call was
made, and after Keefe missed the shot,
Sooner Terry Evans fouled Vlahov going for
the rebound.
Tubbs, apparently, was rather perplexed
about the no-call on Keefe's charge — if
Holmes had been hit any harder he would
have ended up in the 14th row — and pro
ceeded to politely inquire as to what was up.
Technical No. 1. Then Tubbs asked what
the technical was for. Technical No. 2. Bye.
"That's one of the most disappointing
things that's ever happened to me," Tubbs
said. "I don't think I deserved either techni
cal. I did not use profanity, I did not holler
at the official. I think I deserved a better
fate than that."
Tubbs' idea to improve the officiating? "I
would suggest they take a urine specimen."
Meanwhile, back on the court, Vlahov
was hitting both his free throws, John
Patrick was hitting all four of the technical
free throws, and then, only 12 seconds later,
Ammann was swishing a three from the left
side to make it 35-26.
And so, with the momentum firmly on
Stanford's side. . . the Cardinal decided not
to score for the next 4:26.
The Sooners, on the other hand, went on
a slightly-peeved 13-0 tear to take the lead
at the half. Price had nine of those 13, and
scored five quick ones at the start of the sec
ond to up the Sooner lead to 46-37. (Price
was then completely shut down by Marcus
Lollie the rest of the game.) A 20-2 run.
Eighteen minutes left.
And so, with the momentum firmly on
Oklahoma's side. . . . the Sooners got
outscored 18-6 in the next six minutes.
Wingate had seven points during that
stretch, as Oklahoma switched from its 2-3
zone to a 1-3-1 trap to try to stem the flow.
After a Lollie turnover the first time down,
though, the Cardinal picked the 1-3-1 apart
to go on a 7-0 run that made it 55-52 Stan
ford with eleven minutes to go.
Six minutes later it was 60-all, and then
the next seven possessions decided the
game. Wingate hit Keefe for a layup —
Keefe's only points of the half — to make it
62-60. Then, after a Sooner miss and a trav
eling violation by Wingate, Oklahoma's
Mike Harris tried to pass the ball in to Web
ster.
I'll take that! Keefe got one huge mitt on

the ball, which ended up in Lollie's hands,
and then at the other end Ammann and
Vlahov played a two-man game in the left
corner. Vlahov kicked it from the post to
Ammann, who put it right back inside.
Evans doubled down to guard Vlahov, leav
ing Ammann open for the return pass, just
beyond the three-point line. . . .
Swish. Five-point lead.
Five seconds later Evans passed the ball

near midcourt, looking for Roland Ware,
and found Vlahov instead. Vlahov was
fouled from behind by Ware, and the two
free throws made it 67-60 with 3:12 to go.
The Sooners got no closer than three the
rest of the way.

monster performance on the glass helped key Stanford's triumph in the NIT champi
onship game.
NEW YORK - When the Stanford
men's basketball team hit the road two
weeks ago to continue play in the National
Invitation Tournament, the Cardinal had
one clearly-defined destination and about
one thousand obstacles in its way.
The destination? Madison Square Gar
den and the NIT title.

Men's Basketball

Cardinal 78

Sooners 72

Stanford wins NIT title.
The odds? Let's put it this way: To
become NIT champion, the Cardinal would
have to win more road games in 10 days
than it had in the previous three months. It
would have to deal with an odyssey that
eventually covered five states, six airports,
four (or was it five?) hotels, three time
zones and included taking finals and writ
ing papers in hotels in Madison, Wis., Car
bondale, 111., St. Louis and New York.
And — just to put everything in its
proper perspective — to capture the NIT
title, the Cardinal would have to win more
postseason games in two weeks than Stan
ford had won in the last 75 years.
No problem.
Stanford won its first postseason cham
pionship in 49 years last Wednesday, down
ing the Oklahoma Sooners 78-72 in the NIT
finals in New York's Madison Square Gar
den. The victory, which capped a remark
able five-game postseason run, raised the
team's final record to 20-13.

"It's a little bit unbelievable to win five
straight like we have and be the champi
ons," said Stanford coach Mike Mont
gomery after all five of his starters scored in
double figures against the Sooners. The win
was the 100 th of Montgomery's five-year
career at Stanford.
"We've played very, very well in this
tournament," Montgomery said. "We
played so much better basketball in this
tournament than we did in January and
February. It just seemed to come together
for us."
Indeed it did. Consider that:
• The Cardinal's five-game winning
streak was the team's longest of the season;
• Stanford was 3-9 on the road in the
regular season, 4-0 in the NIT;
• After shooting .481 from the floor in
the regular season, the Cardinal shot .596
in its first three NIT games (a 93-86 win
over Houston at home, an 80-72 win at Wis
consin and a 78-68 win at Southern Illinois)
and finished the tournament hitting at a
.528 clip; and
• The Cardinal defense held its final two
opponents, Massachusetts and Oklahoma,
to a miserable .403 shooting performance
and kept the Sooners 26 points below their
season scoring average.
Not bad. "Every game of the tournament
was just a better and better team effort,"
said guard Kenny Ammann, who had 22
points in the title game and was named to
the all-tourney team. "I can't imagine a bet
ter way to go out. This was more fun than
the NCAAs ever would've been: No media
pressure, no attention, just going on the
road not knowing where we'd play next.
"We knew if we played like we were capa
ble, we'd keep playing. If not, we'd go home.


Ken Beer — Daily
Andrew Vlahov and coach Mike Montgomery share a celebratory moment after the Cardinal's 78-72 victory In the Nation
al Invitation Tournament Championship game. Stanford's glorious run in the NIT was due in large part to Vlahov's return
from injury.
. .. This was a lot of fun. It's the way bas
ketball should be."
Ammann was joined on the all-NIT team
by Andrew Vlahov, who had 34 points, 22
rebounds and 11 assists in the final two
games. In the Cardinal's 73-71 squeaker
over UMass in the semifinals in New York,
Vlahov went 12-for-12 from the line,
including two shots with 5.7 seconds left
that sealed the win.
"I don't even want to imagine what it
would have been like tonight without (Vla
hov)," said Montgomery after the title
game. "He does so much for us: He plays
smart, he's so strong, he's such a team
leader. ... I don't know that the MVP
shouldn't go to our trainer."
That would be team trainer Dake
Walden, who deserves a great deal of credit
for Vlahov's return: After the senior for
ward had surgery to remove two bone spurs
from his right ankle in January, Walden got
him back into game shape faster than any
one thought possible. In the five NIT
games, Vlahov averaged 12 points and
seven rebounds in 34 minutes each time
out.
With all due respect to Walden and Vla
hov, however, center Adam Keefe already
had the tournament MVP award locked up.
Keefe scored 23 per game in the NIT, pulled
down 11 boards a contest and led the team
in scoring in three of the games, including a
career-high 33 points and 14 rebounds at
Wisconsin. His tournament performance
helped him break school single-season
records for field goals (252), points (709),
points per game (21.5), free throws made
(203), free throws attempted (252), and
minutes played (1,204, or 36.5 per game).
Ironically, in the finals against the Soon
ers Keefe had the least points among the
five starters, as Oklahoma's
sagging/pounding zone held him to 12, his
third-lowest total of the season. Keefe was
so annoyed he couldn't stop grinning after
ward.
"People have said all year that we're a
one-player team, and tonight we proved
that's not true," Keefe said. "That's why we
won this game: Everyone had to come
together. This was a complete, sound vic
tory and we couldn't be happier."
"They're an outstanding team, a tough
team," agreed Oklahoma coach Billy
Tubbs, who watched most of the game on
ESPN after catching two ultra-quick tech
nicals in the first half. "They played real
well and deserve a lot of respect."
Stanford may get some of that respect
now, after spending long stretches of the
season not living up to preseason expecta
tions. "I saw the basketball team the last
three weeks that we expected to have all
along," Montgomery said.
He didn't see it, however, in the first half
of the title game. The Sooners (who fin
ished the season 20-15) rode the inside
game of center Brian Sallier and the outside
game of guard Brent "Shoot-it-as-soon-as
you-touch-it" Price to a 39-34 advantage at
the half. Price and Sallier each had 17
points in the first half, while at the other
end the Cardinal was making only 11 of its
first 28 shots and turning the ball over 12
times against the Sooners' 2-3 zone.
Oklahoma pressed most of the game, but
— just as it had done all tournament — the

Cardinal handled the press easily. In the
first half, though, Stanford would usually
beat the press, set up in the halfcourt. . .
and then turn the ball over.
"The first half I don't think was really
characteristic of how we'd played the last
few games," Montgomery said.
Even with the woes, two things did go
right for the Cardinal in the first half. The
first was that Vlahov and Deshon Wingate

said guard Kenny Ammann, who had 22
points in the title game and was named to
the all-tourney team. "I can't imagine a bet
ter way to go out. This was more fun than
the NCAAs ever would've been: No media
pressure, no attention, just going on the
road not knowing where we'd play next.
"We knew if we played like we were capa

Andrew Vlahov and coach Mike Montgomery share a celebratory moment after the Cardinal's 78-72 victory In the Nation
al Invitation Tournament Championship game. Stanford's glorious run in the NIT was due in large part to Vlahov's return
from injury.
. .. This was a lot of fun. It's the way bas
ketball should be."
Ammann was joined on the all-NIT team
by Andrew Vlahov, who had 34 points, 22
rebounds and 11 assists in the final two
games. In the Cardinal's 73-71 squeaker
over UMass in the semifinals in New York,
Vlahov went 12-for-12 from the line,
including two shots with 5.7 seconds left
that sealed the win.
"I don't even want to imagine what it
would have been like tonight without (Vla
hov)," said Montgomery after the title
game. "He does so much for us: He plays
smart, he's so strong, he's such a team
leader. ... I don't know that the MVP
shouldn't go to our trainer."
That would be team trainer Dake
Walden, who deserves a great deal of credit
for Vlahov's return: After the senior for
ward had surgery to remove two bone spurs
from his right ankle in January, Walden got
him back into game shape faster than any
one thought possible. In the five NIT
games, Vlahov averaged 12 points and
seven rebounds in 34 minutes each time
out.
With all due respect to Walden and Vla
hov, however, center Adam Keefe already
had the tournament MVP award locked up.
Keefe scored 23 per game in the NIT, pulled
down 11 boards a contest and led the team
in scoring in three of the games, including a
career-high 33 points and 14 rebounds at
Wisconsin. His tournament performance
helped him break school single-season
records for field goals (252), points (709),
points per game (21.5), free throws made
(203), free throws attempted (252), and
minutes played (1,204, or 36.5 per game).
Ironically, in the finals against the Soon
ers Keefe had the least points among the
five starters, as Oklahoma's
sagging/pounding zone held him to 12, his
third-lowest total of the season. Keefe was
so annoyed he couldn't stop grinning after
ward.
"People have said all year that we're a
one-player team, and tonight we proved
that's not true," Keefe said. "That's why we
won this game: Everyone had to come
together. This was a complete, sound vic
tory and we couldn't be happier."
"They're an outstanding team, a tough
team," agreed Oklahoma coach Billy
Tubbs, who watched most of the game on
ESPN after catching two ultra-quick tech
nicals in the first half. "They played real
well and deserve a lot of respect."
Stanford may get some of that respect
now, after spending long stretches of the
season not living up to preseason expecta
tions. "I saw the basketball team the last
three weeks that we expected to have all
along," Montgomery said.
He didn't see it, however, in the first half
of the title game. The Sooners (who fin
ished the season 20-15) rode the inside
game of center Brian Sallier and the outside
game of guard Brent "Shoot-it-as-soon-as
you-touch-it" Price to a 39-34 advantage at
the half. Price and Sallier each had 17
points in the first half, while at the other
end the Cardinal was making only 11 of its
first 28 shots and turning the ball over 12
times against the Sooners' 2-3 zone.
Oklahoma pressed most of the game, but
— just as it had done all tournament — the

Cardinal handled the press easily. In the
first half, though, Stanford would usually
beat the press, set up in the halfcourt. . .
and then turn the ball over.
"The first half I don't think was really
characteristic of how we'd played the last
few games," Montgomery said.
Even with the woes, two things did go
right for the Cardinal in the first half. The
first was that Vlahov and Deshon Wingate
were absolutely crushing Oklahoma for
wards Kermit Holmes and Jeff Webster.
The Sooner forwards, who normally score
33 a game, were a stellar 0-for-12 in the
first half (a remarkable second-half recov
ery got them up to 2-for-19).
The second plus for Stanford was that
Tubbs received an early boot courtesy of an
overly-anal official. With the score tied at
26 and 4:38 left in the half, Keefe caught a
pass in the paint, turned to the hoop, low
ered his shoulder and practically impaled
Holmes, who fell to the floor. No call was
made, and after Keefe missed the shot,
Sooner Terry Evans fouled Vlahov going for
the rebound.
Tubbs, apparently, was rather perplexed
about the no-call on Keefe's charge — if
Holmes had been hit any harder he would
have ended up in the 14th row — and pro
ceeded to politely inquire as to what was up.
Technical No. 1. Then Tubbs asked what
the technical was for. Technical No. 2. Bye.
"That's one of the most disappointing
things that's ever happened to me," Tubbs
said. "I don't think I deserved either techni
cal. I did not use profanity, I did not holler
at the official. I think I deserved a better
fate than that."
Tubbs' idea to improve the officiating? "I
would suggest they take a urine specimen."
Meanwhile, back on the court, Vlahov
was hitting both his free throws, John
Patrick was hitting all four of the technical
free throws, and then, only 12 seconds later,
Ammann was swishing a three from the left
side to make it 35-26.
And so, with the momentum firmly on
Stanford's side. . . the Cardinal decided not
to score for the next 4:26.
The Sooners, on the other hand, went on
a slightly-peeved 13-0 tear to take the lead
at the half. Price had nine of those 13, and
scored five quick ones at the start of the sec
ond to up the Sooner lead to 46-37. (Price
was then completely shut down by Marcus
Lollie the rest of the game.) A 20-2 run.
Eighteen minutes left.
And so, with the momentum firmly on
Oklahoma's side. . . . the Sooners got
outscored 18-6 in the next six minutes.
Wingate had seven points during that
stretch, as Oklahoma switched from its 2-3
zone to a 1-3-1 trap to try to stem the flow.
After a Lollie turnover the first time down,
though, the Cardinal picked the 1-3-1 apart
to go on a 7-0 run that made it 55-52 Stan
ford with eleven minutes to go.
Six minutes later it was 60-all, and then
the next seven possessions decided the
game. Wingate hit Keefe for a layup —
Keefe's only points of the half — to make it
62-60. Then, after a Sooner miss and a trav
eling violation by Wingate, Oklahoma's
Mike Harris tried to pass the ball in to Web
ster.
I'll take that! Keefe got one huge mitt on

the ball, which ended up in Lollie's hands,
and then at the other end Ammann and
Vlahov played a two-man game in the left
corner. Vlahov kicked it from the post to
Ammann, who put it right back inside.
Evans doubled down to guard Vlahov, leav
ing Ammann open for the return pass, just
beyond the three-point line. . . .
Swish. Five-point lead.
Five seconds later Evans passed the ball

near midcourt, looking for Roland Ware,
and found Vlahov instead. Vlahov was
fouled from behind by Ware, and the two
free throws made it 67-60 with 3:12 to go.
The Sooners got no closer than three the
rest of the way.
NIT champs. "I just can't tell you what a
great win this is for us," Montgomery said.
"It's just very gratifying for the kids. This
is something they'll never forget."

Senior Deshon Wingate jams one home over Oklahoma's Kermit Holmes. Wingate's
monster performance on the glass helped key Stanford's triumph in the NIT champi
onship game.
NEW YORK - When the Stanford
men's basketball team hit the road two
weeks ago to continue play in the National
Invitation Tournament, the Cardinal had
one clearly-defined destination and about
one thousand obstacles in its way.
The destination? Madison Square Gar
den and the NIT title.

Men's Basketball

Cardinal 78

Sooners 72

Stanford wins NIT title.
The odds? Let's put it this way: To
become NIT champion, the Cardinal would
have to win more road games in 10 days
than it had in the previous three months. It
would have to deal with an odyssey that
eventually covered five states, six airports,
four (or was it five?) hotels, three time
zones and included taking finals and writ
ing papers in hotels in Madison, Wis., Car
bondale, 111., St. Louis and New York.
And — just to put everything in its
proper perspective — to capture the NIT
title, the Cardinal would have to win more
postseason games in two weeks than Stan
ford had won in the last 75 years.
No problem.
Stanford won its first postseason cham
pionship in 49 years last Wednesday, down
ing the Oklahoma Sooners 78-72 in the NIT
finals in New York's Madison Square Gar
den. The victory, which capped a remark
able five-game postseason run, raised the
team's final record to 20-13.

"It's a little bit unbelievable to win five
straight like we have and be the champi
ons," said Stanford coach Mike Mont
gomery after all five of his starters scored in
double figures against the Sooners. The win
was the 100 th of Montgomery's five-year
career at Stanford.
"We've played very, very well in this
tournament," Montgomery said. "We
played so much better basketball in this
tournament than we did in January and
February. It just seemed to come together
for us."
Indeed it did. Consider that:
• The Cardinal's five-game winning
streak was the team's longest of the season;
• Stanford was 3-9 on the road in the
regular season, 4-0 in the NIT;
• After shooting .481 from the floor in
the regular season, the Cardinal shot .596
in its first three NIT games (a 93-86 win
over Houston at home, an 80-72 win at Wis
consin and a 78-68 win at Southern Illinois)
and finished the tournament hitting at a
.528 clip; and
• The Cardinal defense held its final two
opponents, Massachusetts and Oklahoma,
to a miserable .403 shooting performance
and kept the Sooners 26 points below their
season scoring average.
Not bad. "Every game of the tournament
was just a better and better team effort,"
said guard Kenny Ammann, who had 22
points in the title game and was named to
the all-tourney team. "I can't imagine a bet
ter way to go out. This was more fun than
the NCAAs ever would've been: No media
pressure, no attention, just going on the
