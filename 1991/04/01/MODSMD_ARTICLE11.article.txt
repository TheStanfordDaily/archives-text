# Start spreading the news: Card captures NIT

NEW YORK - When the Stanford
men's basketball team hit the road two
weeks ago to continue play in the National
Invitation Tournament, the Cardinal had
one clearly-defined destination and about
one thousand obstacles in its way.
The destination? Madison Square Gar
den and the NIT title.

Cardinal 78

Sooners 72

Stanford wins NIT title.
The odds? Let's put it this way: To
become NIT champion, the Cardinal would
have to win more road games in 10 days
than it had in the previous three months. It
would have to deal with an odyssey that
eventually covered five states, six airports,
four (or was it five?) hotels, three time
zones and included taking finals and writ
ing papers in hotels in Madison, Wis., Car
bondale, 111., St. Louis and New York.
And — just to put everything in its
proper perspective — to capture the NIT
title, the Cardinal would have to win more
postseason games in two weeks than Stan
ford had won in the last 75 years.
No problem.
Stanford won its first postseason cham
pionship in 49 years last Wednesday, down
ing the Oklahoma Sooners 78-72 in the NIT
finals in New York's Madison Square Gar
den. The victory, which capped a remark
able five-game postseason run, raised the
team's final record to 20-13.

"It's a little bit unbelievable to win five
straight like we have and be the champi
ons," said Stanford coach Mike Mont
gomery after all five of his starters scored in
double figures against the Sooners. The win
was the 100 th of Montgomery's five-year
career at Stanford.
"We've played very, very well in this
tournament," Montgomery said. "We
played so much better basketball in this
tournament than we did in January and
February. It just seemed to come together
for us."
Indeed it did. Consider that:
• The Cardinal's five-game winning
streak was the team's longest of the season;
• Stanford was 3-9 on the road in the
regular season, 4-0 in the NIT;
• After shooting .481 from the floor in
the regular season, the Cardinal shot .596
in its first three NIT games (a 93-86 win
over Houston at home, an 80-72 win at Wis
consin and a 78-68 win at Southern Illinois)
and finished the tournament hitting at a
.528 clip; and
• The Cardinal defense held its final two
opponents, Massachusetts and Oklahoma,
to a miserable .403 shooting performance
and kept the Sooners 26 points below their
season scoring average.
Not bad. "Every game of the tournament
was just a better and better team effort,"
said guard Kenny Ammann, who had 22
points in the title game and was named to
the all-tourney team. "I can't imagine a bet
ter way to go out. This was more fun than
the NCAAs ever would've been: No media
pressure, no attention, just going on the
road not knowing where we'd play next.
"We knew if we played like we were capa
ble, we'd keep playing. If not, we'd go home.

al Invitation Tournament Championship game. Stanford's glorious run in the NIT was due in large part to Vlahov's return
from injury.
