# Water loss prompts Roble Pool closure
## 
### Alexa Lee Staff writer 
Losing more than 3,000 gal
lons of water a day, Roble Pool
has been cited as the latest cul
prit hindering the University's
efforts to conserve water, and
will be closed this quarter.
Drought restrictions
prompted Acting Athletic
Director Alan Cummings to
make the final decision to close
the pool after he learned of
severe water leakage from
cracks and pipes.
"We simply cannot continue
to waste that kind of water,"
said Shirley Schoof, assistant
director of the Department of
Athletics.
While it only costs the Uni
versity $700 a quarter to fill it,
Roble Pool requires a lot of
water to remain in operation â€”
132,000 gallons. "It's not the
operating costs that we are
more concerned with,"
explained Cummings, "but the
loss of water. "
"It's definitely got some
problems that have to be

fixed," said Ted Knapp, a pool
manager and assisting swim
ming coach for the University.
He added that the 60-year-old
pool "has surface cracks, and
possibly main line leakage
problems."
Those problems, Knapp esti
mated, can amount to repair
costs from $50,000 to
$100,000, which would likely
be covered by University and
department funding. Officials
are still "entertaining different
methods for repair and evalu
ating how to best cut costs," he
added.
Meanwhile, plans have been
made to relocate swimming
classes, normally held in Roble
Pool during spring. Classes will
now take place in deGuerre,
the only other pool on campus.
Students taking swimming will
be sharing the facility with the
varsity swimming teams, the
varsity water polo team, intra
mural players and recreation
swimmers.
