# Water loss prompts Roble Pool closure
## 
### Alexa Lee Staff writer 
Losing more than 3,000 gal
lons of water a day, Roble Pool
has been cited as the latest cul
prit hindering the University's
efforts to conserve water, and
will be closed this quarter.
Drought restrictions
prompted Acting Athletic
Director Alan Cummings to
make the final decision to close
the pool after he learned of
severe water leakage from
cracks and pipes.
"We simply cannot continue
to waste that kind of water,"
said Shirley Schoof, assistant
director of the Department of
Athletics.
While it only costs the Uni
versity $700 a quarter to fill it,
Roble Pool requires a lot of
water to remain in operation â€”
132,000 gallons. "It's not the
operating costs that we are
more concerned with,"
explained Cummings, "but the
loss of water. "
"It's definitely got some
problems that have to be

fixed," said Ted Knapp, a pool
manager and assisting swim
ming coach for the University.
He added that the 60-year-old
pool "has surface cracks, and
possibly main line leakage
problems."
Those problems, Knapp esti
mated, can amount to repair
costs from $50,000 to
$100,000, which would likely
be covered by University and
department funding. Officials
are still "entertaining different
methods for repair and evalu
ating how to best cut costs," he
added.
Meanwhile, plans have been
made to relocate swimming
classes, normally held in Roble
Pool during spring. Classes will
now take place in deGuerre,
the only other pool on campus.
Students taking swimming will
be sharing the facility with the
varsity swimming teams, the
varsity water polo team, intra
mural players and recreation
swimmers.
Women's swim coach
Richard Quick said the shut down
of Roble Pool would probably not
hinder team workouts. "It won't
affect us, except for the fact that
the pool will be more crowded,
especially for individual work

outs," said Quick.
But water polo player Chris
Wallin, a freshman, said so many
swimmers in one pool will cause
problems. There are already space
conflicts among the teams, he
said. "It would be impossible to
add more swimmers being that it
is already cramped."
Swim instructor Sharon Dono
van noted that scheduling prob

lems might force the University
to cut enrollment in swimming
classes as well as require the
classes to work around team prac
tices.
Schoof noted that health
improvement water aerobics
classes have been canceled for
spring. "We are going to make do
but it is not going to be easy," she
said.

As for the future of Roble Pool,
officials say they are still unsure
when the pool will reopen.
"Our intention is to get all the
bids and estimates for repair, see
if we are in a good position from
the water standpoint, and then
make a decision of whether or not
to open the pool for the summer,"
Cummings said.
