# Candidates' errors hamper election process
## 
### Howard Libit Staff writer 
Missed deadlines and mistakes in signa
ture-gathering by ASSU candidates are
needling Elections Commissioner Haul Lopez,
who in recent weeks has put a student's senate
candidacy on hold and proposed a new penalty
for late petitions.
Sophomore Pamay Bassey's candidacy,
which is endorsed by the People's Platform,
was put on hold a few days before spring break
as the absentee ballot was being prepared and
distributed for the spring election.
Bassey's nomination petition contained two

pages of signatures, but one page had the
crossed-out name of a special fee request
group at the top, she said.
Bassev added she is committed to running
"regardless of any difficulty," and would run
as a write-in candidate if disqualified.
Lopez said Bassey's candidacy would be
determined soon â€” by a committee that does
not exist.
According to Lopez, an ASSU Hearings
Committee was supposed to have been formed
at the beginning of the school year, but the
ASSU Nominations Committee has not gotten
around to selecting any members. Lopez said
the committee will be formed this Thursday at

the ASSU senate meeting.
Lopez has also disqualified one page of sig
natures from the Students First Council of
Presidents' petition because it did not have
any of the candidates' names at the top. The
slate still had enough signatures to appear on
the ballot.
The absentee ballot is for students who will
be off campus during the April 17-18 election
but still want to vote. Several organizations
missed the deadline for special fee requests
and do not appear on the ballot, such as ASSU
Legal Counseling and Tuesday Films.
In addition, Lopez said the
March 20 deadline for constitu
tional amendments and referenda
passed without a single submis
sion, and none appears on the
absentee ballot.
The final ballot, for students
voting during the normal polling
hours, will be completed after
petitions for special fee requests
and constitutional amendments
are submitted by a tentative late

deadline of this Friday.
Lopez said he will propose a
$20 penalty for late special fee
petitions that are submitted by
Friday. He said he is not sure if
senate action is needed to insti
tute the late penalty.
No late petitions for COP or
senate candidates will be
accepted.
Lopez was upset by the failure
of several groups to meet dead
lines because "people are not tak
ing the process seriously and it
breaks the continuity of the pro
cess."
"But we will not let paperwork
get in the way of a good election

and will not be slowed down by
someone else's mistakes," added
Lopez, a third-year graduate stu
dent in electrical engineering.
In other election news, Lopez
said he will nominate junior
Jason Moore for hearings officer
at this Thursday's senate meet
ing. The senate rejected the previ
ous nominee, graduate student
Doreen Musson, at its last meet
ing.
Lopez had vowed not to nomi
nate another candidate after
Musson was rejected, but said he
reversed his decision after Moore
approached him about taking the
position.
