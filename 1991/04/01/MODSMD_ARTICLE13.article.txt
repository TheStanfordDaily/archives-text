# Candidates' errors hamper election process

Missed deadlines and mistakes in signa
ture-gathering by ASSU candidates are
needling Elections Commissioner Haul Lopez,
who in recent weeks has put a student's senate
candidacy on hold and proposed a new penalty
for late petitions.
Sophomore Pamay Bassey's candidacy,
which is endorsed by the People's Platform,
was put on hold a few days before spring break
as the absentee ballot was being prepared and
distributed for the spring election.
Bassey's nomination petition contained two

pages of signatures, but one page had the
crossed-out name of a special fee request
group at the top, she said.
Bassev added she is committed to running
"regardless of any difficulty," and would run
as a write-in candidate if disqualified.
Lopez said Bassey's candidacy would be
determined soon â€” by a committee that does
not exist.
According to Lopez, an ASSU Hearings
Committee was supposed to have been formed
at the beginning of the school year, but the
ASSU Nominations Committee has not gotten
around to selecting any members. Lopez said
the committee will be formed this Thursday at

the ASSU senate meeting.
Lopez has also disqualified one page of sig
natures from the Students First Council of
Presidents' petition because it did not have
any of the candidates' names at the top. The
slate still had enough signatures to appear on
the ballot.
The absentee ballot is for students who will
be off campus during the April 17-18 election
but still want to vote. Several organizations
missed the deadline for special fee requests
and do not appear on the ballot, such as ASSU
Legal Counseling and Tuesday Films.
