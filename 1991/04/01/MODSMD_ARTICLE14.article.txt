# Rep. Campbell aims for Senate
## 
### Eric Young Senior staff writer 
Rep. Tom Campbell, a Stanford
law professor, has set his sights on
the Senate seat of retiring Demo
crat Alan Cranston.
Vying for the six-year Senate
seat, Campbell called for a "new
conservatism" in America. Camp
bell, who is considered by many to
be a moderate Republican,
explained that new conservatism
has three main pillars: fiscal aus
terity, environmental protection
and a woman's right to choose an
abortion.

"l look forward to a dialogue
with people throughout Califor
nia. Together we will make this
new conservatism a reality," he
said in a March 19 speech
announcing his candidacy. Elec
tions will be held in 1992.
Until three years ago, Camp
bell, 38, taught regularly at Stan
ford Law School. In November
1988 he eked out a victory over
Democrat Anna Eshoo, a San
Mateo County supervisor, for a
seat in the House of Representa
tives. Currently, he sits on the
Judiciary Committee and the Sci
ence, Space and Technology Com

mittee.
While in office, Campbell has
held frequent meetings in his dis
trict, the 12th, which includes
parts of San Mateo, Santa Clara
and Santa Cruz counties. In Jan
uary he earned both strong cen
sure and praise in his home dis
trict when he voted to authorize
President Bush to use force in the
Persian Gulf.
For the race to the Senate he
counts in his camp such local
heavyweights as George Schultz,
former Secretary of State and
senior fellow of the Hoover Insti


Tom Campbell
tution, and David Packard, a
fund-raising and business giant.
Campbell's attempt to land the
Senate seat — a political plum for
both parties as the Republicans
try to win control of the Senate in
1992 — will cost an estimated $15
million. To get his name known
outside the 12th district, Camp
bell has begun to canvass the
state.
Campbell said stopping deficit
spending will be his top priority in
the Senate. "We need leaders with
the courage to say, 'Let's cut
spending, and I will shoulder my
fair share of the cuts.'"
Regarding the environment, he
pledged to "make the coastline
safe from offshore oil drilling, pre
serving our deserts and ensuring
the safety of our ground water."
Campbell introduced a bill March
7 with Reps. Tom Lantos, D-
Burlingame, and Leon Panetta,
D-Monterey, to extend state con
trol over offshore drilling.
Campbell said he supports a
woman's right to choose an abor
tion because it is a "moral and
religious issue." Campbell is a
Roman Catholic.
