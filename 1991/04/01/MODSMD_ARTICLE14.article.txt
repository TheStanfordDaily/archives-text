### Eric Young Senior staff writer 
Rep. Tom Campbell, a Stanford
law professor, has set his sights on
the Senate seat of retiring Demo
crat Alan Cranston.
Vying for the six-year Senate
seat, Campbell called for a "new
conservatism" in America. Camp
bell, who is considered by many to
be a moderate Republican,
explained that new conservatism
has three main pillars: fiscal aus
terity, environmental protection
and a woman's right to choose an
abortion.

"l look forward to a dialogue
with people throughout Califor
nia. Together we will make this
new conservatism a reality," he
said in a March 19 speech
announcing his candidacy. Elec
tions will be held in 1992.
Until three years ago, Camp
bell, 38, taught regularly at Stan
ford Law School. In November
1988 he eked out a victory over
Democrat Anna Eshoo, a San
Mateo County supervisor, for a
seat in the House of Representa
tives. Currently, he sits on the
Judiciary Committee and the Sci
ence, Space and Technology Com

mittee.
While in office, Campbell has
held frequent meetings in his dis
trict, the 12th, which includes
parts of San Mateo, Santa Clara
and Santa Cruz counties. In Jan
uary he earned both strong cen
sure and praise in his home dis
trict when he voted to authorize
President Bush to use force in the
Persian Gulf.
For the race to the Senate he
counts in his camp such local
heavyweights as George Schultz,
former Secretary of State and
senior fellow of the Hoover Insti
