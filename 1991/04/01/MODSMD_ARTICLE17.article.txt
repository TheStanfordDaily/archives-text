# Stanford Unity Party dissolved
## 
### Howard Libit Staff writer 
As the People's Platform, Stu
dents First and Hammer and Cof
fin Society announce their slates
for the ASSU spring election, one
party has quietly disappeared
from the scene.
What ever happened to the
Stanford Unity Party?
According to members, the
party has disbanded because
almost everyone on last year's
slate will be going abroad next
year.
A group of freshmen began the
party before last year's ASSU
election and placed a slate of 10
undergraduate senators on the
ballot, two of whom were elected
to non-voting positions. The party
did not endorse a Council of Pres
idents or graduate senatorial
slate.
The party was formed because
there was a "need on campus for
more constructive dialogue," said
Charles Hokanson, a senate can
didate in last year's election. "We
also wanted to change the way the
campus perceived the role of the
ASSU."
There was also a perception
that neither the People's Platform
nor Students First truly repre
sented the students' views,
according to party members.
"We saw both [parties] as being
too polarized," said Dan Karp,
another former senate candidate.
"We felt that there was a need for
a group to represent the main
stream views."
Members of the other parties
on campus, however, said they
were not impressed by the short
lived party's participation in last
year's election.
"In real terms the [party] had
little or no impact in the sense
that they did not garner many

Members of the party contend that even
though their candidates did not fare well at
the polls their ideas were heard and incorpo
rated into the student community.

votes or even offer a COP slate,"
said senior Goodwin Liu, a mem
ber of the COP "Their ideas also
did not have a significant impact
because they were similar to those
of the People's Platform.
"It was a pretty bold attempt
by some young students to forge a
new middle ground but they did
not think deeply enough about
the issues," Liu added.
Members of the party, however,
contend that even though their
candidates did not fare well at the
polls their ideas were heard and
incorporated into the student
community.
"In getting our ideas activated
into Stanford politics, we were
very successful and that is what's
most important," said Karp.
Mike Curry, an elected Stan
ford Unity Party senator, claimed
that many of the party's ideas
formed the basis of proposals
implemented by this year's COR
including the November leader
ship summit, the Centennial Cul
ture Fest in May and the
strengthening of the dorm repre
sentatives program.
"Our main philosophical idea
was altering the concept of multi
culturalism to include new groups
— not just the four communities
of color," Curry said.
Some members of the party
said they decided to work on indi
vidual issues this year and forgo
further partisan politics.
For example, Hokanson is on
the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies and is co-chair of the

dorm representatives program.
He has also worked on the Sub
committee on Residential Educa
tion.
"The question we asked our
selves was, 'Do we feel that creat
ing a party would be the best use
of our efforts?' Our answer was
'no,'" Curry said. "We decided
that it would be more worthwhile
to work directly on the issues."
Curiy, however, has joined the
People's Platform and is on its
COP slate for this year's election.
Unlike Curry, senator Allison
Alter said she does not agree com
pletely with the beliefs of existing
parties and refuses to work on
another campaign.
Several members attributed
the early demise of the party to
the disappointing results of last
year's election.
"It is difficult to maintain a
strong party when only two of 10
people are elected to the senate,"
Curry said. "It would be hard to
build up an organization that
would have a significant following
on campus."
Alter, however, maintained
that the party's serious third
party candidacy has laid the
groundwork for others who might
want to run in upcoming elec
tions,
"If a third party wanted to run
they would have a really good
shot," Alter said. "It is a large
time commitment and requires a
lot of hard work, but it is defi
nitely a worthwhile learning expe
rience."
