Filmmaker John Hughes' next
movie is set at Stanford and will
be filmed on campus during fall
quarter 1991. Hughes intends to
cast several Stanford students in
secondary roles.
The film, titled "Educated in
Romance," will feature Christian
Slater as a rebellious drama stu
dent and Winona Ryder as his con
servative, intellectual love inter
est.
Slater and Ryder's roommates
will be portrayed by actual Stan
ford students, according to
Hughes, who is one of Holly
wood's leading directors of young
adult films.
Auditions for these parts and
for 100 extras are open to cur
rently enrolled Stanford students
and will be held today and tomor
row at noon at Dinkelspiel Audito
rium.
Stanford's academic reputa
tion and the campus' striking
architecture were the convincing
factors for Hughes in selecting the
University for the film's location.
"I wanted a school with credi
bility," Hughes said, "but not one
that was too serious. Stanford
seems to have a sense of humor."
He decided to use actual Stan
ford students in the roles of Ryder
and Slater's roommates because
he "wanted to capture the feel of
the campus — represent actual
students and get their feedback on
certain situations," he said.
"Slater will play frisbee golf,
drink beer at the campus Coffee
House. All the things that actual
students do around here," said
Hughes.
