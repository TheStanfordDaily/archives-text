PLO refuses to hand over arms
BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) — The Palestine
Liberation Organization says its guerrillas in
Lebanon will not hand over their arms by the
end of next month as dictated by a government
order, Beirut newspapers reported yesterday.
PLO representative Zeid Wehbe said the
decision by President Elias Hrawi's govern
ment to disband all private armies in Lebanon
should not apply to the PLO.
"We tell them that we are not a militia and
our arms are linked to regional and interna
tional considerations as long as the Israeli
occupation of our land is in place," Wehbe said
in a speech on Saturday.
Pope hails Easter as day of light
after the dark 'shadow of war'
VATICAN CITY (AP) - Pope John Paul II
said Sunday that the Persian Gulf war had cast
a dark shadow over humanity but that Easter,
marking the resurrection of Jesus Christ, was a
day of "light, strength and hope."
In his Easter address to tens of thousands of
people packed into St. Peter's Square, the pon
tiff called on world leaders to solve disputes
peacefully.
He also appealed for compassion for the
downtrodden peoples of the world, singling out
the Palestinians and the Kurds.
Hijackers of plane surrender
ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) — A hijacker, believed
to be armed with grenades, surrendered today
after releasing all passengers and crew members
aboard an Air Algeria jet, authorities said.
The hijacker gave himself up after several
hours of negotiations with Interior Minister
Mohamed Salah Mohammedi.
The man, who was not identified, sought a
postponement of Algerian elections scheduled
for June, a government official said.
Minimum wage increases today
WASHINGTON (AP) — The minimum
wage increases by 45 cents an hour today to
$4.25, but labor advocates already are pressing
for more.
About 3 million Americans earn the mini
mum wage, and millions of higher-paid work
ers may benefit as well when the minimum
increases from $3.80 an hour this week. But
workers' advocates contend the increase still is
far too paltry to lift low-wage workers out of
poverty.
