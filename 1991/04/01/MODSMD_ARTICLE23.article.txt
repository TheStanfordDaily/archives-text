# East Bloc military pact ended
## 
### 
VIENNA, Austria (AP) — The
once-mighty Warsaw Pact, a sym
bol of the Cold War and Soviet
domination, flipped into history
yesterday as a military alliance.
One Hungarian newspaper
called the occasion "the winning
of the Third World War."
The end of the Warsaw Pact
comes less than 18 months after
demonstrators climbed atop sec
tions of the Berlin Wall in protests
that began the collapse of Com
munism across the Soviet bloc.
The ties that bound the Soviet
Union's military to its Eastern
European satellites for 36 years
were formally severed.
Eastern European officials said
the end of the six-nation pact will
lead to changes in the Western
NATO alliance, and that the for
mer Warsaw Pact nations would

seek new security agreements.
"Its importance lies not only in
the fact that we became indepen
dent, but it also gives us a chance
to establish a good, new type of
relationship with the Soviet
Union," Hungarian Foreign Min
ister Geza Jeszenszky said on
state radio.
But the end of the pact was
barely noted in the other pact
nations — Poland, Czechoslo
vakia, Romania and Bulgaria —
which already had been busy for
months easing themselves away
from Moscow's control.
Albania left the pact in 1962,
and East Germany ceased to exist
following German reunification in
October.
The 16-nation North Atlantic
Treaty Organization and Warsaw
Pact members signed a non

aggression agreement last year.
in the Soviet Union, Gen.
Pyotr Lushev and Gen. Vladimir
Lobov yesterday gave up their
titles as Warsaw Pact commander
and chief of staff, respectively.
But Lobov said in a Tass inter
view that he hoped the Soviets
would continue cooperating with
their Eastern European neigh
bors.
Lobov said the Warsaw Pact
committee of defense ministers,
its joint command, and its mili
tary, scientific and technical coun
cil all were scheduled to be dis
banded.
The Warsaw Pact continues to
exist as a political organization,
but the Eastern European coun
tries have urged that it fully end
by early next year.
