# Drought won't affect consumer products greatly
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — One-quarter of Amer
ica's food and half of its fruits and vegetables are
grown in California. So in this fifth year of the
longest drought in a century, it's natural to wonder
what will happen to all those crops.
Will produce prices skyrocket? Will there still be
almonds in Almond Joy?
Don't worry.
Even with recent rain and snow, the drought is
still bad. But food experts say consumer items like
produce and processed foods made from any of Cali
fornia's 200 different crops won't be affected.
Any cutbacks will be in rice, cotton and other
annual field crops that use a lot of water and are less
valuable than consumer items like fruits, vegetables
and nuts, said Emil Loe of the California Depart
ment of Agriculture.
"Irrigation water will be used to protect those
crops of higher value," Loe said. "We don't want to
lose (fruit) trees and vines."
Growers of those consumer crops also may buy
water from cotton, wheat, corn and rice farmers who
would get government compensation if they can't
plant this year. And there are other solutions, includ
ing pumping well water and deciding that this is the
year to drastically prune some trees.
Since most seasonal crops aren't planted yet, it's
too early to assess the drought's exact impact on the
1991 food supply.
But national supermarket executives and federal
officials, who deal with droughts, freezes and disease
every year in one growing region or another, say the
dry spell in California won't affect the abundance
Americans expect at their grocery stores.
First of all, the United States is unmatched as a
country when it comes to growing and transporting
food.
Secondly, California has always depended on irri
gation for farming and developed an extremely flexi
ble system for getting water to crops and livestock
and allocates most of its fresh water to that purpose.
Cows, for example, are big water users. Not only
do they drink 28 gallons of water a day and get
washed with an additional 50 gallons daily, but they
eat two of the thirstiest crops grown — alfalfa and
cotton seed.
California is the second largest producer of milk
in the country and its herds are the largest in the
world. But Bob Feenstra, executive director of the
state's Milk Producer Council, said: "We have an
adequate water pool. We pump."
David Ikari, branch chief for the state Bureau of
Milk Stabilization, said there are plenty of crops that
cows can eat besides alfalfa and cotton.
