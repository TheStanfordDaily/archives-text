## Don't knock the NIT 
### 
OK, SO IT WASN'T THE
NCAA tournament. Then
again, it wasn't a first-round
loss to Siena, either.
In fact, coach Mike Montgomery
and the men's basketball team
deserve a lot of credit for winning
the National Invitation Tourna
ment last week.
So "We're number 65" doesn't
make you want to jump up and
down in celebration. (How many
fingers do you hold up when you're
screaming that, anyway?)
But let's face it: Sometime in
early March, Andrew Vlahov was
in street clothes and his fellow
seniors, Kenny Ammann, John
Patrick and Deshon Wingate, were
losing at California. The season
was grinding to a halt, mediocre at
best.
But then God let Andrew heal
and also gave us a home game

against Houston. Suddenly, a glim
mer of hope arose; the season could
be salvaged.
Well, it was more than salvaged.
How easily the Cardinal, like those
of you who scoff at the NIT, could
have put in a half-hearted
approach to the tournament, say
ing to themselves, "It's only the
NIT."
But no, they played their hearts
out. At home against Houston, at
Wisconsin, at Southern Illinois and
then twice in New York City.
The seniors on the team finished
their careers with five consecutive
wins and the opportunity to play in
Madison Square Garden.
And Montgomery reached the
100-victory plateau at Stanford —
in style — earning respect for his
ability to prepare his team.
And we get a championship ban
ner to boot.
