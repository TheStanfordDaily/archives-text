CONDOLEEZZA RICE should
be welcomed with open arms
upon her return to Stan
ford's Political Science Depart
ment.
An expert on arms control and
the Soviet Union, Rice has decided
to resign from her position as Spe
cial Assistant to the President for
National Security Affairs and
Senior Director of Soviet Affairs
and will instead teach a class on
the role of the military in politics.
Rice's return to Stanford pro
vides an exceptional opportunity
for students to learn about the
inner-workings of American gov
ernment. A dedicated and talented
teacher, she will be able to share
many intriguing experiences with
students. As a full-time faculty
member, Rice will be able to con
tribute much more to education
than she could have had she joined
the public-speaking circuit.
The curriculum in a discipline

such as political science is often
quite theoretical and abstract, and
it is important that a pragmatic
approach exist to complement this.
It is in this vein that the teaching
of former politicians and high
ranking bureaucrats such as Rice
is vital; former participants in the
political arena can apply theory
and abstraction to the real world.
The Political Science Depart
ment at Stanford has been faulted
with having a left-of-center persua
sion. Rice, who worked for Presi
dent Bush since 1988, will be a wel
come conservative addition, coun
terbalancing the current perspec
tives.
What's more, Rice's return will
help allay minority claims of
underrepresentation. The addition
of a black female faculty member
will be an important expansion in
minority and female faculty repre
sentation.
