## John Wheeler Vietnam veteran urges discussion of war, national service 
### 
WITH THE UNITED STATES'
dramatic victory in the Gulf war,
the issue of military service is
out of the closet again. Debates sur
rounding the draft, the volunteer mili
tary and the issue of eligibility have
regained the nation's attention. During
the Vietnam War, I saw these issues
wrench many students.
Every generation should discuss these
issues, but obstacles tend to get in the
way — obstacles such as myths about
the military and the tendency of politi
cians to avoid the topic. Americans will
confront the topic only when citizens 17
to 26 years of age force it onto the
national agenda.
I offer these ideas from a journey of
immense pain and with the hope of
learning from readers' responses. My
graduating class of the U.S. Military
Academy bore the most casualties of all
the classes in Vietnam. As if in a night
mare, I saw friend after friend fall in
battle.
We veterans were made to feel like a
national embarrassment. Graduate
schools and employers avoided us. I was
the only veteran in my law school class;
the school'B other veteran was drafted
into Vietnam mid-term. Instead of being
given readmission when he returned, he
had to apply again. In my business
school class, 70 draftable men graduated
six months early by following a special
program. This had the practical effect of
enabling some to make a timely move to
a draft-deferred job. It seemed the smart
ones skirted military service.
To face the wounds of war, I chaired
construction of the national Vietnam
Veterans' Memorial. I came to under
stand that Americans had placed all
their guilt and anger about Vietnam onto
the veterans.
From this experience I discovered
three broad categories of what is worth
dying for, who shall do the dying and
what is worth living for. The categories

are: politics, personal values of bypassing
military service and the responsibilities
of women.
The political health of our country. In
electing presidents, Americans seem to
want above all someone competent in
matters of national security.
American voters think top leaders
themselves ought to have been willing to
get in harm's way for the national com
munity. Striking evidence in favor of this
are the eight U.S. senators who are Viet
nam veterans, three times the number
one would expect from the proportion of
veterans in the population. In addition,
some politicians have falsely claimed to
be Vietnam veterans.
The voters' preference has integrity. It
sends the message that politicians
should not send others to face what they
were unwilling to face themselves, and
that war is best led by those who have
fought. The lesson for those who may
aspire to public office is that military
service is a wise step.
The person you become. Military ser
vice changes your life forever. To many
citizens, the military seems to crush the
true self. The opposite is true. You forego
material possessions and falsity of ego so
that your buddies become the center of
your life. The group helps you to under
stand the good person you really are.
I had no car, house, dress-up clothes
or social status. We dealt in the basics:
love, fear and pain. I learned that we
exist to give love and receive love, and
that each act of love adds to a sum that
never diminishes.
Dying neither was nor is the worst
thing; abandonment or loss of love is.
The North Vietnamese, like Saddam
Hussein, systematically killed babies.
Stopping such thugs is worth dying for.
The positive bias of voters for veterans
suggest that most Americans appreciate
this.
It is an unbalanced society in which
the elite get safe havens during times of

war and contrive to leave military service
to others during times of peace. We do
this by treating the subject in strictly
economic terms, using pay and education
as a lure for military involvement, as if
there were no ethical, moral or spiritual
issue.
It is disingenuous to think that those
drawn by these blandishments are supe
rior to those who would be drafted; for
the "volunteer army," training manuals
had to be geared down by several grade
levels.
This leaves scars. Since 1975 numer
ous writers have revealed the ambiva
lence, sense of loss and shadow of guilt
they bear for bypassing military service.
Some speculate that a soldier was killed
in the place they avoided.
The responsibility of women. Most of
battle is an arena where sex makes little
difference. Plenty of American soldiers
have been killed by female guerrillas. At
West Point, a woman — my classmate's
daughter — was the brigade commander
for the class of 1990. Women's marks
manship, agility and ability to fly heli
copters are all as good as, or better than,
men's.
Male-only draft registration is tainted
— the core ideas of the women's move
ment are compromised. There is some
responsibility for young women to say,
"Wait a minute. This is wrong."
New political consequences will
appear. Currently, a woman candidate for
president would not be faulted for lack of
military experience, but that will be less
true as women from reserve and
academy background move into political
life.
A basis for discussion. I suggest a
draft for one-fourth of the military. The
culture is ready for female casualties —
indeed, two female soldiers were killed in
Iraq's Scud missile attack on an army
barrack.
The draft would select women and
men equally, with no barriers to role in

battle. Selection would be by lottery as
begun in 1969, with equal pay for volun
teers and those drafted. Everyone would
stand up to the risks of the draft. Volun
teer opportunities would be only moder
ately reduced. Thus, some respectable
number of national leaders would have
military experience, and they would have
a significant number of sons and daugh
ters in uniform.
Another alternative is national ser
vice, with the military as one option.
Congress and the president have grap
pled with this for years. The major prob
lem is the huge expense and perhaps
impossibility of putting each whole
cohort of youth to work. But individual
choice remains: volunteer for the mili
tary or another major commitment like
the Peace Corps.
The status quo separates the bosses
from the sacrifice. In the Gulf war, only
three of the over 500 congressmen and
top federal officials had a relative at risk.
No son of Bush was in Vietnam or the
Gulf. Dan Quayle's use of family influ
ence to skip service in Vietnam is well
known. Secretary of Defense Dick
Cheney never even served, stretching
various deferments out for nine years.
Nothing will change unless the youth
call for change. It is possible. Youth ener
gized the recent decades' successes in the
women's, environmental and civil rights
movements.
One step is campuswide debate.
Another is to announce, as members of a
new and closely watched body of voters,
that it bothers you to live in a country
that gives elites a pass and thinks it can
only buy self-giving instead of inspiring
it.

this.
It is an unbalanced society in which
the elite get safe havens during times of

war and contrive to leave military service
to others during times of peace. We do
this by treating the subject in strictly
economic terms, using pay and education
as a lure for military involvement, as if
there were no ethical, moral or spiritual
issue.
It is disingenuous to think that those
drawn by these blandishments are supe
rior to those who would be drafted; for
the "volunteer army," training manuals
had to be geared down by several grade
levels.
This leaves scars. Since 1975 numer
ous writers have revealed the ambiva
lence, sense of loss and shadow of guilt
they bear for bypassing military service.
Some speculate that a soldier was killed
in the place they avoided.
The responsibility of women. Most of
battle is an arena where sex makes little
difference. Plenty of American soldiers
have been killed by female guerrillas. At
West Point, a woman — my classmate's
daughter — was the brigade commander
for the class of 1990. Women's marks
manship, agility and ability to fly heli
copters are all as good as, or better than,
men's.
Male-only draft registration is tainted
— the core ideas of the women's move
ment are compromised. There is some
responsibility for young women to say,
"Wait a minute. This is wrong."
New political consequences will
appear. Currently, a woman candidate for
president would not be faulted for lack of
military experience, but that will be less
true as women from reserve and
academy background move into political
life.
A basis for discussion. I suggest a
draft for one-fourth of the military. The
culture is ready for female casualties —
indeed, two female soldiers were killed in
Iraq's Scud missile attack on an army
barrack.
The draft would select women and
men equally, with no barriers to role in

battle. Selection would be by lottery as
begun in 1969, with equal pay for volun
teers and those drafted. Everyone would
stand up to the risks of the draft. Volun
teer opportunities would be only moder
ately reduced. Thus, some respectable
number of national leaders would have
military experience, and they would have
a significant number of sons and daugh
ters in uniform.
Another alternative is national ser
vice, with the military as one option.
Congress and the president have grap
pled with this for years. The major prob
lem is the huge expense and perhaps
impossibility of putting each whole
cohort of youth to work. But individual
choice remains: volunteer for the mili
tary or another major commitment like
the Peace Corps.
The status quo separates the bosses
from the sacrifice. In the Gulf war, only
three of the over 500 congressmen and
top federal officials had a relative at risk.
No son of Bush was in Vietnam or the
Gulf. Dan Quayle's use of family influ
ence to skip service in Vietnam is well
known. Secretary of Defense Dick
Cheney never even served, stretching
various deferments out for nine years.
Nothing will change unless the youth
call for change. It is possible. Youth ener
gized the recent decades' successes in the
women's, environmental and civil rights
movements.
One step is campuswide debate.
Another is to announce, as members of a
new and closely watched body of voters,
that it bothers you to live in a country
that gives elites a pass and thinks it can
only buy self-giving instead of inspiring
it.

WITH THE UNITED STATES'
dramatic victory in the Gulf war,
the issue of military service is
out of the closet again. Debates sur
rounding the draft, the volunteer mili
tary and the issue of eligibility have
regained the nation's attention. During
the Vietnam War, I saw these issues
wrench many students.
Every generation should discuss these
issues, but obstacles tend to get in the
way — obstacles such as myths about
the military and the tendency of politi
cians to avoid the topic. Americans will
confront the topic only when citizens 17
to 26 years of age force it onto the
national agenda.
I offer these ideas from a journey of
immense pain and with the hope of
learning from readers' responses. My
graduating class of the U.S. Military
Academy bore the most casualties of all
the classes in Vietnam. As if in a night
mare, I saw friend after friend fall in
battle.
We veterans were made to feel like a
national embarrassment. Graduate
schools and employers avoided us. I was
the only veteran in my law school class;
the school'B other veteran was drafted
into Vietnam mid-term. Instead of being
given readmission when he returned, he
had to apply again. In my business
school class, 70 draftable men graduated
six months early by following a special
program. This had the practical effect of
enabling some to make a timely move to
a draft-deferred job. It seemed the smart
ones skirted military service.
To face the wounds of war, I chaired
construction of the national Vietnam
Veterans' Memorial. I came to under
stand that Americans had placed all
their guilt and anger about Vietnam onto
the veterans.
From this experience I discovered
three broad categories of what is worth
dying for, who shall do the dying and
what is worth living for. The categories

are: politics, personal values of bypassing
military service and the responsibilities
of women.
The political health of our country. In
electing presidents, Americans seem to
want above all someone competent in
matters of national security.
American voters think top leaders
themselves ought to have been willing to
get in harm's way for the national com
munity. Striking evidence in favor of this
are the eight U.S. senators who are Viet
nam veterans, three times the number
one would expect from the proportion of
veterans in the population. In addition,
some politicians have falsely claimed to
be Vietnam veterans.
The voters' preference has integrity. It
sends the message that politicians
should not send others to face what they
were unwilling to face themselves, and
that war is best led by those who have
fought. The lesson for those who may
aspire to public office is that military
service is a wise step.
The person you become. Military ser
vice changes your life forever. To many
citizens, the military seems to crush the
true self. The opposite is true. You forego
material possessions and falsity of ego so
that your buddies become the center of
your life. The group helps you to under
stand the good person you really are.
I had no car, house, dress-up clothes
or social status. We dealt in the basics:
love, fear and pain. I learned that we
exist to give love and receive love, and
that each act of love adds to a sum that
never diminishes.
Dying neither was nor is the worst
thing; abandonment or loss of love is.
The North Vietnamese, like Saddam
Hussein, systematically killed babies.
Stopping such thugs is worth dying for.
