# Sororities will get housing
## 
### Bubbles Smith Staff writer 
Stanford sororities will once again be housed,
following a University decision last week revers
ing the previous restriction on fraternity and
sorority housing.
In addition, fraternities including Alpha
Epsilon Pi and Sigma Nu will be allowed to build
houses on Stanford land, Acting Dean of Student
Affairs Norm Robinson announced Friday.
"We're just sick and tired of fighting against
the fraternities. If they want to build houses and
have the money to do it, they might as well go
ahead," Robinson said. "It appears the Greek sys
tem is growing stronger and stronger, and there's
nothing we can do about it."
Several University administrators had previ
ously stated that housing Greek groups was
against the University's goal of providing four
years of guaranteed housing for all students.
The end of the sorority housing ban came as a
result of the decision on fraternity housing,
Robinson said.
"We knew we couldn't just let the men have
houses and exclude the women because of the dis

crimination charges," he explained.
All Stanford sororities lost University housing
and recognition in 1944 after several problems
between sorority women and women living in
dorms. An unconfirmed rumor cites a double sui
cide as the reason for the sororities' demise. Sup
posedly, two women jumped off Hoover Tower
after failing to receive bids for their favorite
groups.
The sororities were allowed to return to cam
pus in the early 1980s, but only after agreeing to
remain unhoused.
That agreement was recently discovered
invalid, and the University must return sorori
ties' original houses to them, effective fall 1991.
Those houses will be taken out of the spring hous
ing Draw if the groups declare intention to buy
them within the next month.
If they can purchase the houses at current
market value, the Alpha Phi sorority will take
over Slavianskii Dom, the Delta Gammas will
move into Storey House, the Delta Delta Deltas
will reside in Haus Mitteleuropa and the Gamma
Phi Betas will own Roth House.
