## PC or not, think for yourself 
### 
OVER THE PAST YEAR, THE
national media have become
increasingly interested in the
growing influence of the so-called "politi
cally correct" doctrine throughout the
country, particularly in academia. Unfor
tunately, most reports are alarmist rather
than informative, focusing on the occa
sional excesses of PC activists rather than
the ideas they defend.
Allegiance to any dogma inhibits criti
cal thought, producing a reluctance to
challenge the views of fervent believers in
the doctrine and an unwillingness to con
sider that others may subscribe to only
certain parts of the doctrine.
Hence arises the assumption that
those who disagree with even a single
tenet are not only wrong, but also are
morally and intellectually inferior. This,
in turn, breeds support for censorship
and belief in guilt by accusation or even
suspicion.
The current PC doctrine is only the
latest dogma whose excesses have caused
hurt and damage. Those in power tradi
tionally impose their own beliefs as an
unchallengeable doctrine.
The most instructive recent example of
the dangers of dogmas came from the
political right, not the left, as recalled by
the recent movie "Guilty by Suspicion."
Thanks to Sen. Joseph McCarthy and
friends, guilt by insinuation and denunci
ation paralyzed political and intellectual
life in this country for several years.
Even today, federal law contains provi
sions against people suspected of being
"communist sympathizers," and the FBI
has a long track record of investigating

those whose opinions challenge the doc
trine of the U.S. government. Curiously,
neo-Nazis seem much more acceptable to
the FBI than, for instance, environmen
tal activists.
A classic example of guilt by insinua
tion was provided by George Bush during
the 1988 campaign: He implied that
membership in the American Civil Liber
ties Union sufficed to make someone
politically incorrect. What is the ACLU
but an association whose express purpose
is to defend the Bill of Rights?
Apparently Bush and his ilk would
have rights only for those whose views
they find agreeable. This lowers them to
the same level as those at the other end of
the PC spectrum, those whose over-zeal
ousness they deplore and attack.
Virtually none of the attacks on the PC
doctrine discusses the actual ideas
involved. At the same time, the beliefs
(purportedly endangered) the attacker
trumpets are merely a litany of the sup
posed cornerstones of American society,
reduced to symbols stripped of any mean
ing beyond that which is convenient.
Historically, those in power have held
the monopoly on political correctness.
Whoever fails to meet their narrow crite
ria for correctness are ignored, smeared
or worse. Rulers who are willing to con
sider an opposing viewpoint with an open
mind are few and far between.
Today, possibly for the first time, those
with opposing views have composed a
body of political ideas with enough sup
port to get it discussed (and sometimes
imposed) on a national scale. It is nause
ating to hear those who have traditionally

been "politically correct" lament the fact
that they are now being opposed with
their own weapons.
No body of ideas should be accepted
unquestioningly, and everyone should
oppose the harmful effects of zealousness
in spreading the current PC canon (or
any other).
But those who attack this canon most
vehemently rarely are, as they claim, dis
interestedly warning against attempted
indoctrination. Too often, they simply
find these new ideas unsettling. After all,
these same people rarely are heard
protest ing the banning of books or oppos
ing laws circumscribing the civil rights of
groups to which they do not belong â€”
that they leave to the ACLU.
The excesses which accompany the
imposition of any doctrine should be
fought not for political reasons only, but
by all those who have not yet lost their
capacity for critical thinking.
If enough people dare to examine the
ideas composing a doctrine on their indi
vidual merit, the specter of indoctrination
will dissolve on its own, its absence
missed by few (I hope).

Maurits van der Veen is considered polit
ically incorrect by most people he knows,
including, occasionally, himself. His col
umn will return to Tuesday next week.
