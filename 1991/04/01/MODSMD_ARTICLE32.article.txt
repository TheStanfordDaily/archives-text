To house or not to house: voices from both sides of frat debate

I AM WRITING ON BEHALF OF
the University in response to the
Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity's recent
document titled "Proposal to Stanford
University," which I received on March
7. That proposal seeks "permission from
Stanford University to construct on its
premises a 40-bed house that would be
built at no cost to the University."
Although the proposal is quite thor
ough, I must point out that the Univer
sity has made it clear for some time now
that there will be no expansion in the
number of housed fraternal groups.
While this means that no more frater
nities or sororities will be housed, it does
provide for the continued occupancy of
houses by the currently housed fraterni
ties under a "grandfather" status as long
as those groups meet the terms and con
ditions of fraternity occupancy.
Although the issue of additional hous
ing has been foreclosed, the University is
committed to working with fraternal stu
dent groups to try to find ways to allevi
ate some of the difficulties that non-resi
dential groups face.

'There will be no
expansion in the num
ber of housed fraternal
groups.'

I know that Assoc. Dean of Student
and Campus Affairs Michael Jackson,
and others who work directly with fra
ternities and sororities, are eager to
explore with Alpha Epsilon Pi and the
representatives of the other non-residen
tial groups the possible solutions to this
problem, including the development of
some type of lodge.
I know that this is not the answer
that Alpha Epsilon Pi wanted, but I hope
that they will take advantage of the
opportunity to help find ways to make
life better for our non-residential frater
nities and sororities.

IN HIS LETTER TO STEVE LYONS,
the president of the Alpha Epsilon Pi
fraternity, Acting Dean of Student
Affairs Norman Robinson misrepre
sented official Stanford University policy
regarding the existence of housed frater
nities in order to justify rejecting the fra
ternity's request to "construct a 40-bed
house that would be built at no cost to
the University"
He wrote, "the University has made it
clear for some time now that there will
be no expansion of the number of housed
fraternal groups." However, official Stan
ford University policy actually states,
"the University is committed to allowing
some selective housing, but does not plan
to increase significantly the proportion
of spaces filled by subjectively selected
means."
When that policy was adopted in
1982, there were 13 subjectively selective
housed fraternities, which constituted
10.6 percent of available housing spaces
— 524 fraternity beds out of 4,903 avail
able. Currently, there are only 10 housed
fraternities, which occupy only 8.2 per-

cent of housing spaces — 434 beds out of
5,263.
Thus, the University policy clearly
indicates that more housed fraternities
should be permitted on campus — up to
at least 128 spaces. The proportion of
subjectively selective housing would
decline even further should any other
presently housed groups lose University
recognition and will definitely decline
with the opening of Kimball Hall.
In fact, should the Theta Delta Chi
fraternity lose its house, a possibility
reported recently in The Daily, the open
ing of Kimball Hall would lower the pro
portion of selective housing to 7 percent
— 384 beds out of 5,462 — which is a
full one-third reduction in the proportion
of selective housing over just the past
eight years.
Robinson is deceiving the Stanford
community as to the rationale behind
rejecting Alpha Epsilon Pi's proposal. We
demand that he reevaluate his decision
in light of the true University policy.
Student opinion clearly supports the
fraternity's proposal. On March 7, the

ASSU Senate endorsed by a vote of 11-4
a bill that calls upon the Board of
Trustees and the administration of the
University to "allow the Alpha Epsilon
Pi fraternity to construct and occupy a
house on campus at its own expense."
We, therefore, expect that a revalua
tion will lead to the proposal's accep
tance and hope that those in positions of
leadership within the Stanford commu
nity will utilize their resources to make
this possible.
