## Barnstorming to the Big Apple 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
NEW YORK — Once upon a
time, a crew of barnstormers who
play the roundball crisscrossed
the country in search of glory.
Their story started out on a
farm out in California where the
young men plied their trade in a
barn called Maples. Seems a bit
odd considering that their logo is
of a mighty evergreen, but no
matter ...
First, some Texans came to
shoot down the young men on
their own territory. 'Stead, the
Cardinal- and White-clad cavalry
routed the gunslingers from
Houston and marched on to Madi
son. Wisconsin, that is.
There, the barnstormers were
Badgered by a hostile house but
managed to melt the cheeseheads.
A second triumph earned the
squad an opportunity to head Illi
nois way. Awaiting them was the
nasty bark of the Saluki.
Lesser clubs might have crum
bled, but not these heroes. Their
vagabond shoes were longing to
stray and yet another victory
earned them that right.
So they were off to the strange
land known by a stranger
moniker: the Big Apple. A city of 8
million. A most extraordinary
barn called Madison Square Gar
den, which fancies itself "The
World's Most Famous Arena."
Surely, the barnstormers
would be intimidated now. On
their turf, they had been fearsome
throughout the year. When it
came time to head for points else
where, though, the men in Cardi
nal and White often stood small.
A raggedy band of followers
were on hand to see if the barn
stormers had the stuff that had
been lacking among their lot for
nearly half a century. Deep down,
they loved the men in Cardinal
and White. Deep down, they knew
their charges had but a slim
chance to come out on top.
In a strange twist of fate, their
little faith would go rewarded this
time. The miraculous joyride
across the Great 48 came to be
thanks in large part to the ring
master of the Cardinal and White,
a gentle giant from the land down
under.
The leader had been hobbled by
a bad wheel a month before the
team's transcontinental tour and
had been feared lost for the
remainder of the campaign. But
through the wonders of the pow
ers that be and a medicine men
known as Dake, the leader —
Drew, they call him — was able to
rejoin his mates for a run at the
brass ring.
With Drew conducting, the
orchestra began to make its
sweetest music in some years. No
longer was the opposition able to
collapse on the Redhead, a warrior
of biblical proportions who natu
rally goes by Adam, and suddenly
the Cardinal and White jugger
naut was not so easily brought to
a halt.
But a corps of Minutemen was
rough and ready and felt capable
of doing just that. When our barn
stormers blitzed them early,
outscoring the Minutemen by a
three-to-one margin, the New
Englanders could have simply
folded.
Instead, they mounted a furi
ous rally that nearly ended the
tour of the Californians two days
too early. The men of Stanford
would have none of that, however.
With the same blend of timely
marksmanship and heady strat
egy that had brought them to
Madison Square, the Cardinal and
White vanquished the men of
Massachusetts.
There was no time to relish the
triumph, though, for there was
one last show to put on — Sooner
rather than later. The grand finale
would pit the men of Stanford
against the run 'n' stun Okla
homans, lightning lads who felt
they had something to prove after
a disappointing year. They pin
pointed the Cardinal and White in
their sights — and had no inten
tion of letting them escape.
When the contest began, it
quickly became apparent that this
last battle would be quite a war.
Momentum see-sawed back and
forth, to and fro' until the Okla
homans field general became the
first casualty. The Cardinal and
White seized the opportunity to
gain some ground only to have it
— and more — swiped back in an
instant.
Finally, the naysayers would be
proved correct and the Cardinal
and White would be defeated, it
seemed. But looks once again
deceived as the Stanford squad
soared on a Wingate and a prayer,
which ended with a resounding
Ammann.
This time they would not crum
ble. This time they would stare
down the ghosts of failures past.
This time they would answer the
call.
Forty-nine years may seem like
an eternity, but in a fabulous fort
night these brave barnstormers
washed it away for now and forever.

quickly became apparent that this
last battle would be quite a war.
Momentum see-sawed back and
forth, to and fro' until the Okla
homans field general became the
first casualty. The Cardinal and
White seized the opportunity to
gain some ground only to have it
— and more — swiped back in an
instant.
Finally, the naysayers would be
proved correct and the Cardinal
and White would be defeated, it
seemed. But looks once again
deceived as the Stanford squad
soared on a Wingate and a prayer,
which ended with a resounding
Ammann.
This time they would not crum
ble. This time they would stare
down the ghosts of failures past.
This time they would answer the
call.
Forty-nine years may seem like
an eternity, but in a fabulous fort
night these brave barnstormers
washed it away for now and forever.
