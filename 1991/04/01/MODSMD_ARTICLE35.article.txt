## Barnstorming to the Big Apple 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
NEW YORK — Once upon a
time, a crew of barnstormers who
play the roundball crisscrossed
the country in search of glory.
Their story started out on a
farm out in California where the
young men plied their trade in a
barn called Maples. Seems a bit
odd considering that their logo is
of a mighty evergreen, but no
matter ...
First, some Texans came to
shoot down the young men on
their own territory. 'Stead, the
Cardinal- and White-clad cavalry
routed the gunslingers from
Houston and marched on to Madi
son. Wisconsin, that is.
There, the barnstormers were
Badgered by a hostile house but
managed to melt the cheeseheads.
A second triumph earned the

A raggedy band of followers
were on hand to see if the barn
stormers had the stuff that had
been lacking among their lot for
nearly half a century. Deep down,
they loved the men in Cardinal
and White. Deep down, they knew
their charges had but a slim
chance to come out on top.
In a strange twist of fate, their
little faith would go rewarded this
time. The miraculous joyride
across the Great 48 came to be
thanks in large part to the ring
master of the Cardinal and White,
a gentle giant from the land down
under.
The leader had been hobbled by
a bad wheel a month before the
team's transcontinental tour and
had been feared lost for the
remainder of the campaign. But
through the wonders of the pow
ers that be and a medicine men
known as Dake, the leader —
