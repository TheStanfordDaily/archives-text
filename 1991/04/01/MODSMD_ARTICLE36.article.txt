# Double take: Swim teams toppled by Texas twice
## 'Indy 700' drowns women

INDIANAPOLIS - Going into
the NCAA Championships,
women's swimming coach
Richard Quick said he hoped the
meet didn't come down to the last
race. It didn't, but it didn't really
end the way Quick wanted it to
either.
A year ago Texas won the 400-
yard freestyle relay, the meet's
final race, to win the team title at
the closest NCAA meet in history.
This year they had no need for
such heroics. The Lady
Longhorns had a terrific third
day, erasing a six-point Stanford
lead to win their seventh crown in
eight years.
Texas finished with 746 points,
the highest total ever, while the
Cardinal finished second at 653.
Florida scored 353 points to get
past California for third. "It was
really disappointing," sophomore
Lori Heisick said. "The encourag
ing things were that we scored
more points than we did last year;
everyone contributed at least one
good race ... and we were good,
but Texas was better."
But while the Cardinal came
up short of an NCAA team title
for the second consecutive year,
Stanford swimmers won eight of
the 18 races to receive some con
solation. And for the second
straight year, a freshman from
the Farm took home Swimmer of
the Year honors.
Following in the footsteps of
teammate Janet Evans, Summer
Sanders won three events, all in
NCAA-record time. "Well, it's
hard to be excited and upset at
the same time," Sanders said.
"I'm pleased with my swims,

but I'm upset that we didn't get
the title.. . . It's just so close, and
we've been working so hard. I'm
happy with second — anyone
would be happy with second —
but when you're that close, you
want to win."
Sanders opened the meet by
breaking Tracy Caulkins' Ameri
can record in the 200 individual
medley. Sanders swam a 1:57.02,
eclipsing Caulkins' mark by .04
seconds and beating defending
champ, and Stanford teammate,
Janel Jorgensen by 1.63 seconds.
Despite the record, Sanders
doesn't want to put herself in
Caulkins' class.
"I remember going to the '84
Olympics and watching Tracy
Caulkins," Sanders said. "She's
my idol. . . . She's the best IMer
ever."
Jorgensen didn't mind losing
to her teammate, saying she was
just glad she and Sanders beat
everyone else. "I think that was
kind of the goal-plan," she said. "I
was just going out trying to do
what's best for the team. We were
trying to go one-two."
Sanders again went one-two
with a defending NCAA cham
pion the following day in the 400
IM. Sanders won in 4:05.19,
under the NCAA record of
4:07.59 set by Evans last year.
Evans finished as the runner-up.
Sanders also broke Mary T.
Meagher's NCAA record in win
ning the 200 butterfly on the
meet's final day.
Evans successfully defended
her titles in the 500 and 1,650
freestyles to win the fourth and
fifth individual NCAA crowns of
her career. She set an University
of Indiana Natatorium record in
the preliminaries of the 500

before going slightly slower in the
finals. In the 1,650 she was on
pace to break her own American
record through 1,000 yards but
fell off a touch for the final third
of the race.
"I just wanted to go out and
see what I could do," Evans said.
"That race is hard for me — it's
just 66 laps, back and forth, and
nothing ever changes for me.
Sometimes I feel in that race that
I wish someone would push me."
Evans won the race by nearly 14
seconds.
Stanford's sixth individual
title was claimed by Heisick in the
100 breaststroke. Heisick had the
fastest time in the nation in that
event last year but finished sec
ond at NCAAs before winning the
title this season.
"I went into it this year with a
completely different attitude that
I wanted to place as high as I
could for the team," she said. "I
think that took a lot of pressure
