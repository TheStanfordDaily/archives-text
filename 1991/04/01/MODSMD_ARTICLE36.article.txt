# Double take: Swim teams toppled by Texas twice
## 'Indy 700' drowns women

INDIANAPOLIS - Going into
the NCAA Championships,
women's swimming coach
Richard Quick said he hoped the
meet didn't come down to the last
race. It didn't, but it didn't really
end the way Quick wanted it to
either.
A year ago Texas won the 400-
yard freestyle relay, the meet's
final race, to win the team title at
the closest NCAA meet in history.
This year they had no need for
such heroics. The Lady
Longhorns had a terrific third
day, erasing a six-point Stanford
lead to win their seventh crown in
eight years.
Texas finished with 746 points,
the highest total ever, while the
Cardinal finished second at 653.
Florida scored 353 points to get
past California for third. "It was
really disappointing," sophomore
Lori Heisick said. "The encourag
ing things were that we scored
more points than we did last year;
everyone contributed at least one
good race ... and we were good,
but Texas was better."
But while the Cardinal came
up short of an NCAA team title
for the second consecutive year,
Stanford swimmers won eight of
the 18 races to receive some con
solation. And for the second
straight year, a freshman from
the Farm took home Swimmer of
the Year honors.
Following in the footsteps of
teammate Janet Evans, Summer
Sanders won three events, all in
NCAA-record time. "Well, it's
hard to be excited and upset at
the same time," Sanders said.
"I'm pleased with my swims,

but I'm upset that we didn't get
the title.. . . It's just so close, and
we've been working so hard. I'm
happy with second — anyone
would be happy with second —
but when you're that close, you
want to win."
Sanders opened the meet by
breaking Tracy Caulkins' Ameri
can record in the 200 individual
medley. Sanders swam a 1:57.02,
eclipsing Caulkins' mark by .04
seconds and beating defending
champ, and Stanford teammate,
Janel Jorgensen by 1.63 seconds.
Despite the record, Sanders
doesn't want to put herself in
Caulkins' class.
"I remember going to the '84
Olympics and watching Tracy
Caulkins," Sanders said. "She's
my idol. . . . She's the best IMer
ever."
Jorgensen didn't mind losing
to her teammate, saying she was
just glad she and Sanders beat
everyone else. "I think that was
kind of the goal-plan," she said. "I
was just going out trying to do
what's best for the team. We were
trying to go one-two."
Sanders again went one-two
with a defending NCAA cham
pion the following day in the 400
IM. Sanders won in 4:05.19,
under the NCAA record of
4:07.59 set by Evans last year.
Evans finished as the runner-up.
Sanders also broke Mary T.
Meagher's NCAA record in win
ning the 200 butterfly on the
meet's final day.
Evans successfully defended
her titles in the 500 and 1,650
freestyles to win the fourth and
fifth individual NCAA crowns of
her career. She set an University
of Indiana Natatorium record in
the preliminaries of the 500

before going slightly slower in the
finals. In the 1,650 she was on
pace to break her own American
record through 1,000 yards but
fell off a touch for the final third
of the race.
"I just wanted to go out and
see what I could do," Evans said.
"That race is hard for me — it's
just 66 laps, back and forth, and
nothing ever changes for me.
Sometimes I feel in that race that
I wish someone would push me."
Evans won the race by nearly 14
seconds.
Stanford's sixth individual
title was claimed by Heisick in the
100 breaststroke. Heisick had the
fastest time in the nation in that
event last year but finished sec
ond at NCAAs before winning the
title this season.
"I went into it this year with a
completely different attitude that
I wanted to place as high as I
could for the team," she said. "I
think that took a lot of pressure


Summer Sanders
off me." Heisick's time of 1:01.37
breaks the school and Pacific 10
Conference record she set last
year by .01 seconds.
Texas opened the meet by win
ning the 200 freestyle relay, but
Evans then countered with the
500 freestyle for Stanford. The
Cardinal racked up the points in
that event as Karen Kraemer took
seventh, Eva Mortensen ninth,
Sionainn Marcoux 11th and Barb
Metz 12th.
The sweep by Sanders and Jor
gensen and a lifetime-best time by
J.T. Toton in the 200 IM plus a
Cardinal victory in the 400
medley relay by Jorgensen,
Heisick, Sanders and co-captain
Suzy Buckovich sandwiched
Leigh Ann Fetter's fourth consec
utive NCAA title for Texas in the
50 freestyle. Buckovich grabbed
fifth in that race but the quality of
the Longhorn depth gave Texas
an 11-point lead after day one.
While Stanford had all 17
swimmers score individual points
for the first time ever, the Lady
Longhorns' depth carried them
through the meet. They had 14
swimmers score at least 25 indi
vidual points, and 15 swimmers
and both their divers scored at
least a dozen points.
Much like they had done
Thursday, Texas had a great
morning session Friday and
appeared poised to extend their
lead. But Stanford had its best
session of the meet that night to
grab a six-point advantage.
Sanders and Evans went one-two
in the 400 IM while Laurie Gan
drud took ninth, Heisick captured
the 100 breaststroke and the Car
dinal team of Jorgensen, Krae
mer, Mortensen and Evans won
the 800 freestyle relay.

Jorgensen, the defending
NCAA champ, placed second in
the 100 butterfly to Arizona's
Crissy Ahmann-Leighton, while
Buckovich and Michelle Griglione
took fourth and sixth, respec
tively. Kraemer added a fifth in
the 200 freestyle and Toton and
Susan Johnson scored in the 100
breaststroke. Sophomore Anne
Mahoney also helped with a
fourth-place finish in the 100
backstroke and Dede Trimble
took sixth in the same race.
Stanford also got a boost in the
diving competition. Through the
first two days of the meet, fresh
man Eileen Richetelli outscored
Texas' divers 28-0 with a sixth in
the one-meter and a fourth in the
three-meter.
"I was pretty happy with my
springboard results, especially my
three-meter," she said. "I knew
that my points would count a lot
to the team score."
Texas took the 200 medley
relay and Jodi Wilson won the 100
backstroke to keep the Lady
Longhorns close Friday Florida
freshman Nicole Haislett won the
200 freestyle and Ahmann-
Leighton became the first woman
from somewhere other than
Texas, Stanford or Florida to win
an individual swimming title since
1989 when she blazed through the
100 butterfly.
Ahmann-Leighton provided
perhaps the highlight of the meet,
breaking Mary T. Meagher's
American record by swimming a
52.36, .06 seconds under the pre
vious standard. "I'm really still in
shock right now," she said. "That
record has been looming over me
for a long time.
"Mary T. is everybody's idol.
Everybody wants to be like her. I
feel honored. Everybody thought
that record would stand for years.
. . . But for someone to beat a
Mary T. or a Tracy Caulkins, it's

going to take a lot more than one
American record or one NCAA
title."
Then came Saturday morning.
Stanford had 17 swimmers com
peting in prelims, placing eight in
the finals (top eight) and five
more in the consolation finals
(ninth through 16th). Texas,
meanwhile, had 18 swims and
produced 13 finalists and four
consolation finalists. Both Lady
Longhorn divers also made the
top eight, and Texas didn't slow
down for the evening session.
Beth Barr won the 200 back
stroke, Fetter set a pool record in
capturing her third straight 100-
freestyle title and Dorsey Tierney
won the 200 breaststroke in
NCAA-record time. "I felt like the
team really came together both
this morning and tonight," third
year Lady Longhorn coach Mark
Schubert said. "I just felt like it
was probably the best night ses
sion we've had since I've been
coaching at Texas."
Evans did win the 1,650
freestyle and Sanders grabbed the
200 butterfly, but the meet was
long over before the Lady
Longhorns closed it by winning
the 400 freestyle relay. Trimble
took third in the 200 backstroke,
Jorgensen was fourth in the 100
freestyle and Kraemer, Marcoux
and Mortensen took ninth
through 11th in the 1,650. Pam
Minthorn and Griglione added
third- and sixth-place finishes in
the 200 butterfly, while Heisick
was third and Toton seventh in
the 200 breaststroke, but it was
not enough to offset the Lady
Longhorns' performance.
One-meter champion Krista
Wilson of SMU was named Diver
of the Year, her mentor, Jim Still
son, was named Diving Coach of
the Year and the Mustangs' Steve
Collins was the Swimming Coach
of the Year
