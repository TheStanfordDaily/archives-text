# Men take a dive in Austin
## 
### Amy Wusterbarth Staff writer 
The Stanford men's swimming
team won the NCAA Champi
onship in Austin, Texas last
week. The Stanford men's swim
ming and diving team did not.
With a ten point lead after the
swimming events, the Cardinal
fell behind as Texas diver Jason
Rhodes captured first place on
the three-meter springboard and
second place on the ten-meter
platform to give the Longhorns a
476-420 victory over Stanford.
But swimming coach Skip
Kenney does not blame the
divers. "I really believe Rick
ISchavone] is the best diving
coach in the nation but I haven't
given him the scholarship money
he needs," said Kenney.
Texas did not capture its
fourth consecutive national
championship easily. After the
first day of competition Stanford
was in fourth place but they
steadily closed the gap with con
sistently strong performances
and personal best times from all
the swimmers.
In the end, Stanford walked
away with five school records,
four American records, four
national age group records and an
eighth consecutive year individ
ual title in the 100 yard back
stroke.
Coming off of a 2-6 season,
Stanford had everyone shaking
their heads in disbelief. "I've
never been so proud of a group
after what they've gone through
. . . the obstacles and hurdles
this season," said Kenney.
"They've had a lot of adversity
this season but they never
stopped believing in themselves.
They were just unbelievable,"

said Kenney.
The swimmers incredible
tenth consecutive win at Pac-10's
foreshadowed their success at
NCAAs. "Pac-10's was a spring
board for NCAAs. We took this
meet by storm," said freshman
Derek Weatherford. "Nobody
really swam slower than they did
at Pac-10's. Everyone did exactly
what they needed to do."
Junior Jeff Rouse echoed his
teammate's sentiments. "We
couldn't have done anything bet
ter. Everyone swam amazingly
and I don't know what I'd
attribute it to, maybe just a team
goal to swim really fast."
Coach Kenney's words of wis
dom seemed to help the men
focus on their task. "Skip told us
it was like a three-day war with
six sessions (morning preliminar
ies and evening finals). They were
like little battles where you just
try to beat the guy next to you,"
said Weatherford.
As they did in most dual meets
this season, Rouse and Weather
ford churned out fantastic perfor
mances. In Weatherford's best
event, the 200 backstroke, he
broke an American record in the
morning preliminary heat with a
1:44.39.
"I've wanted that record for a
couple years. I thought I could do
better at night and get a faster
time though," said Weatherford.
Unfortunately in the evening
finals, he had to settle for a silver
medal.
Capturing the bronze in the
200 backstroke was teammate
Rouse. Junior Josh Mikesell
placed sixth.
The unstoppable backstrokers
also plowed their way to several
top finishes in the 100 back
stroke. Rouse and freshmen

Brian Retterer and Weatherford
placed first, fifth and sixth,
respectively. Rouse's win marked
the eighth year the Cardinal has
won that event.
In the backstroke leg of the
400 Medley Relay, Rouse broke
an American and NCAA record
with a 46.65, despite a still
injured wrist. Since breaking his
wrist six weeks ago, he has con
centrated on the 100 because he
did not think he would have the
endurance for the 200.
"I thought I could (break the
national record), I just needed to
get out fast and hold on," said
Rouse. He kicked underwater for
most of the length of the pool
before popping up for a few
strokes above water where he
"relied on experience."
In addition to his stellar back
stroke performances, Weather
ford knocked two seconds off of
his personal record in the 200
Individual Medley, making him
