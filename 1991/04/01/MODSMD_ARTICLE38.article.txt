# Sans Trisha and Z, heroic hoopsters come up short

NEW ORLEANS — There is a
cliche in sports about the postsea
son that says a team should
"dance with who brung ya."
Unfortunately for the Cardinal
women's basketball team, two key
players who "brung 'em" to the
NCAA tournament were forced to
sit out the big dance with crip
pling injuries.

Women's Basketball

Lady Vols 68

Cardinal 60

Unable to overcome the
untimely loss of two veteran
starters, post players Trisha
Stevens and Julie Zeilstra, Stan
ford couldn't hold a surprising
halftime lead and bowed to even
tual champion Tennessee in the
NCAA semifinals, 68-60.
Stevens came to the Bayou
Country in a full-leg cast, courtesy
of a ruptured tendon suffered in
the West Regional. But although
the Cardinal (26-6) overcame that
blow to reach the Final Four,
when the sore-ankled Zeilstra
pulled a calf muscle in warmups
just minutes before the game with
the Lady Volunteers and joined
Stevens as an end-of-the-bench
wallflower, it was just too much to
absorb.
The defeat dashed Stanford's
hopes of becoming the first team
to repeat as women's basketball
champions since Cheryl Miller
and USC accomplished the feat in
the 1983 and 1984. Instead, Ten
nessee won its third overall title
by besting Virginia in the first
ever overtime final, 70-67.
Considering that the No. 11
Cardinal wasn't even supposed to
be in the Final Four in the eyes of
many, the fact that Stanford still
led for over half the game and very
nearly beat a full-strength Ten
nessee team is close to remark
able.
"You're disappointed, but peo
ple played their guts out," Cardi
nal coach Tara VanDerveer said.

"We got [Tennessee] in trouble,
but we had nobody to put inside. I
told (assistant coach) Amy
(Tucker), have you looked down
the bench lately?"
What VanDerveer found there
was a bunch of young players with
little championship experience
who wanted another shot at the
Lady Vols after falling to Ten
nessee twice in regular season.
The Cardinal was confident of
winning in the week prior to the
game, and the loss of Zeilstra
seemed only to increase the
squad's motivation.
"Because of our success, it's
like this team needs an extra chal
lenge," said VanDerveer, whose
team trailed in both West
Regional games into the second
half. "It was a challenge when
Julie went down — it was like
being [behind] in the beginning of
the game."
The only other game Zeilstra
has missed in past three years
because of injury was Stanford's
final regular season game at Ore
gon State. The Cardinal lost that
one 87-61, and that was with
Stevens playing 37 minutes.
The Cardinal came out playing
aggressive, no-tomorrow basket
ball, while Tennessee appeared to
assume it had a bye into the final.
Sporting a starting lineup of a
senior, three sophomores and a
freshman, Stanford stuck close to
the Lady Vols and jumped on top,
22-20, behind two slicing drives
for layups by forward Chris Mac-
Murdo. Three straight baskets by
freshman Kelly Dougherty, who
filled in for Zeilstra, and the Car
dinal had a seven-point lead at
intermission, 28-21.
"We just had to go out and
play," said Val Whiting, who was
the victim of extra defensive pres
sure and countless hard-luck rolls,
going a miserable 0-for-6 from the
field in the first half. "I was a litle
surprised we were playing so
aggressively, missing Julie . . . but
Kelly and Chris can do the job."
Dougherty, who emerged as a
dangerous post player in the
regional, had her career highs in
both scoring and rebounding,
with 15 points and eight boards.

After playing only sparingly all
season, the 5-11 forward from
Leavenworth, Kan. showed her
big-play ability in the postseason
when the Stanford front line was
hurting.
"When I saw Julie go down, I
was thinking the same thing I did
when Trisha went down,"
Dougherty said. "The team
needed me then, and I stepped up.
Today, I just had to step up that
much more."
But after tying its own record
for fewest points in a half of a
semifinal game, set in the first
women's Final Four in 1982, Ten
nessee came out a different team
after halftime. Fresh from being
castigated by coach Pat Summitt
for her first half performance (no
field goals, two fouls, two
turnovers), Ail-American center
Daedra Charles began to play like
one. She got her team going with
two jumpers, and began to assert
herself on the boards. She fin
ished with 18 points and nine
rebounds.
"The first half belonged to
Stanford. I definitely think they
disrupted us," Summitt said.
"The second half was our half. We
played the way we had played to
get to this point. I have to compli
ment Daedra for being able to re
focus and come to play for us in
the second half."
Whiting could do little on
Charles defensively after picking
up her third foul just three min
utes into the second half, and Van-
Derveer had no one else to match
up with the 6-foot-3 center. "I've
never played in a game before
without both Trisha and Julie,"
said Whiting, who finished with
10 points (on 4-of-18 shooting)
and seven rebounds. "It's tough
playing against Daedra anyways."
But Stanford had a Kodak Ail-
American of its own in point
guard Sonja Henning, and she
nearly managed to hold off the
