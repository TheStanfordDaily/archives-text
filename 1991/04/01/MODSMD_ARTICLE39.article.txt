# Gymnasts take 2nd at Pacific 10 meet
## 
### Noah Blake Staff writer 
Upsets are what make sports
worth watching, but don't tell
that to UNLV's men's basketball
teams. And don't tell it to Stan
ford's men's gymnastics team
either.
Although they were favored to
win the Pac-10 championships
over spring break, the Cardinal
men finished a disappointing sec
ond behind their traditional
nemesis, the UCLA Bruins.
What happened? Quite simply,
according to coach Sadao
Hamada, the Bruins hit their rou
tines, and the Cardinal did not. To
explain the defeat, Hamada
pointed specifically to problems
on the parallel bars and high bar,
normally solid events for the
team.
Despite a solid performance by
sophomore All-America Jair
Lynch, and the best showing yet
this season by junior Tim Ryan,
who continues his comeback from
a year of injury, Stanford fell to
UCLA by nearly a two point
deficit.
The Cardinal has now finished
second in two consecutive meets,
and finds itself at a crossroads.
Stanford has enough difficulty in
its routines to win the NCAA
championship, but the team is
still searching for the consistency
that will put it over the top.
Technically, the second place
finish to UCLA at Pac-10's means
nothing, as the nationally second
ranked Cardinal is still seeded
ahead of the Bruins for the NCAA
western regionals, which will take

place this weekend in Norman,
Oklahoma. Technically Stanford
does not have to win the regionals,
since the top four teams will go on
to the NCAA finals.
But, in actuality, if this tal
ented Stanford team is going to
realize its goal of a national
crown, the gymnasts must prove
to both themselves and the
nation's top powers that they can
perform consistently enough to
win under pressure. The only
meet left for them to do this
before the NCAA finals is the
meet in Norman.
And avenging the upset to
UCLA will not be enough, as the
Cardinal needs to stage an upset
of its own. Host Oklahoma, the
nation's top-ranked team, will
likely be favored in both the
regionals and the finals, and
Hamada thinks that consistency
is the Sooners' strength. In other
words, it is unlikely that the Okla
homa team will defeat itself, and
thus it is up to Stanford to beat
the Sooners.
It may be easier for the Cardi
nal to defeat Oklahoma in the
finals, which will be held at Penn
State, as opposed to the regionals,
because of the Sooners' home gym
advantage. But next weekend the
Stanford gymnasts must erase the
painful Pac-10 championship
defeat from their minds, and the
easiest way to do this is with a
solid, consistent performance.
With at least a strong second
place showing in the Sooners' den,
the Cardinal will prepare itself to
take Oklahoma in the finals on a
neutral floor. Perhaps then Stan
ford will like upsets a lot more.
