# Semester system to start next year
## Fall classes will begin in late August 
### Ari Richter Editorial staff 
Summer vacation is going to be
a little shorter this year.
University President Donald
Kennedy last week announced
Stanford will change from the
quarter to the semester system
next fall, shortchanging students
and faculty of more than a
month's vacation.
Kennedy told The Daily,
"Money's tight. We simply cannot
afford to hold four academic terms
each year."
In addition, the change will
save the University the extra
expense of having students on
campus early for next Septem
ber's Centennial events, he added.
Since classes will have already
started, the University will not
have to absorb the extra room and
board costs it had expected.
Also considered were frequent
complaints from hundreds of stu
dents who claim the current sys
tem makes it difficult to find sum
mer jobs and puts them on a dif
ferent schedule than most of their
friends, Kennedy said.
For students, the new schedule
means less time sunbathing in
Bora Bora or interning in Wash
ington, D.C. since fall-semester
classes will begin Aug. 28. For fac
ulty, the change means less time
away from students.
Sophomore David Morgan said
he was angry about the decision:

"I was all set to work for a con
gressman. . . and now, forget it.
Since we have to be back at school
by late August, I can only work for
eight weeks; no one will take me
for such a short time."
Equally disturbed, History
Prof. Barton Bernstein said,
"Great. Now I'll be able to spend
even more time in rooms with hid
den blackboards, defective micro
phones and broken clocks."
Kennedy suggested the calen
dar change would enhance the
University's recently redoubled
commitment to teaching, saying,
"Longer terms will allow profes
sors to go into further depth than
they would otherwise be able."
The new calendar's fall
semester exams will still take
place before Christmas vacation,
though a week later than in the
past, and spring semester will
begin Jan. 16, 1992 with exams
taking place in mid-May, Kennedy
explained.
Thus, the 1992 and subsequent
summer vacations will be normal
length, he added.
When asked about consequen
tial changes to academic require
ments, Kennedy responded, "Stu
dents will still be required to accu
mulate 180 units, but the number
of units for each class will be
increased to reflect the new term
lengths."
