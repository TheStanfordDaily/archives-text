# Thousands answer Pepsi Challenge
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Staff writer 
The monsoon season ended
just soon enough for the Stan
ford Invitational Diet Pepsi
Track Challenge over the week
end. This brainchild of Cardinal
track coach Brooks Johnson was
long on quantity and quality as
over 3,500 athletes, including
two Olympians and many
national champions, competed
in balmy weather at Stanford
Stadium. Several personal
records were set and an 11 -year
old stadium record broken dur
ing the meet.
Washington State's Samuel
Kibiry broke this vintage record
in the men's invitational mile.
Ray Brown, one of the
nation's top half-milers, helped
set an early swift pace in the
event, while Olympian Jeff
Atkinson, the American record
holder in the indoor 1,500
meters, and former 5,000 meter
national champion Matt Guisto
led the field.
Atkinson was a few steps
behind until Brown dropped out
on the third of four laps. For a
short while Atkinson held the
lead but on the last lap he was
overtaken by Stanford's Mark
Mastalir, Guisto, Kibiri and Indi
ana's Robert Kennedy.
Kibiri, who hails from Kenya,
pulled away from the pack with
a strong last 200 to finish in a
blistering 3:57.84. Kennedy fin
ished 2nd and Guisto 3rd. Both
broke the four minute mile bar
rier — the first time at the sta
dium that three people have

gone under four minutes in the
same race. Mastalir placed
fourth with a personal best of
4:00.85.
"Brooks told me to go out and
not run for respectibility; run for
the win. That's what 1 did when
I took the lead with a lap to go.
Those guys may be more fit than
I am but I gave myself a chance
(to win)," Mastalir said.
The women's mile was not
nearly as close, as 1988
Olympian and former Stanford
Ail-American PattiSue Plumer
broke for the lead at the start
and kept building on it. She
crossed the finish in 4:31.53.
"Given the effort I would
have liked to go under 4:30. It's
not a particularly fast track,
especially for distances," Plumer
said, "It has real wide tuns and
a soft track, which is great for
training. When you go to a really
good track its fun because all of a
sudden you get a bunch of PRs."
She said that racing here
after competing here in college
makes her nervous. "On one
hand I get extra nervous because
its my home stadium and I
always feel like I have an obliga
tion to run well here. On the
other hand I train here almost
every day so its hard to connect
that this is a race rather than
just a workout," Plumer said.
Besides the Olympians the
main attraction was the Pacific
Ten Conference versus Big Ten
Conference dual meet. Stars
from both conferences faced off
in field and track events with the
Pac-10 winning on the men's
side, 110-86, and the women's,

77-69.
Stanford's Chryste Gaines
won the women's 100 in a
scorching time of 11.67 seconds.
Jim Cramton was the lead-off
runner on the Pac-10's victori
ous mile relay team and Marcus
Hickerson won the men's long
jump.
Jackie Edwards just missed
her goal of 41 feet in the triple
jump as she leaped 40'11". She
finished second to Idaho's Jackie
Ross but garnered first place
points in the dual meet since
Idaho belongs to the Big Sky
Conference.
Edwards, however, was not
pleased with her jumps. On one
particular leap, she cleared 41
feet but landed off balance and
planted her hand behind her in
the pit, shaving at least half a
foot from her jump.
"All I could do was look back
at my hand and say 'Oh please
hand come back,'" Edwards
said.
Debbie Malueg also placed
well in the field as she finished
third in the shot put and fourth
in the discus. The winner in both
events was former Stanford
thrower Pam Dukes. Her 183'4"
toss in the discus was a personal
best.
Helping the Pac-10 cause was
Washington State's Augustin
Olobia, the national indoor 55
meter champion, lie won both
the 100 and 200 meters.
Top scorers for the Big-10
included teammates Mark
Croghan and Arnita Green of
Ohio State. Croghan is the 3,000
steeplechase national champion

and won that race easily on Sat
urday. Green was the lead-off
runner on the winning mile
relay team.
One of the highlights of the
meet was to be the University
Football 40. Two false starts,
however, probably slowed most
of the runners' starts. Michigan
State's Tico Duckett won with
Stanford's Jon Volpe coming in
second. Glyn Milburn pulled up
with a hamstring injury.
Although the Diet Pepsi
Track Challenge was the main
attraction Saturday, several
Stanford athletes performed
well in Friday's events. The Car
dinal men's distance medley
team of Alex Accetta, Cramton,
Dave Strang and Chris Rae won
easily. Accetta, however, was not
totally pleased with his lead leg.
"I should have beat the guy
handily but I went too early. I
should have started (my kick) at
100 (meters left in the leg)
instead of 300. I haven't run a
half mile in a while so its a shock
to my system but I did OK," he
said.
Stanford's women's distance
medley squad of Susan Helfter,
Rhonda Oliver, Ashley Back and
Melanie Bloch also won easily.
Dave Scudamore and Gary
Stoltz finished 1-2 in the 10,000
meters. In the field Stanford's
Ail-American heptathlete Peggy
Odita won the high jump and
Toby Norwood placed second in
the shot put.
Next for several of Stanford's
top athletes is one of the biggest
meets of the season, the Texas
Relavs.

Stoltz finished 1-2 in the 10,000
meters. In the field Stanford's
Ail-American heptathlete Peggy
Odita won the high jump and
Toby Norwood placed second in
the shot put.
Next for several of Stanford's
top athletes is one of the biggest
meets of the season, the Texas
Relavs.
The monsoon season ended
just soon enough for the Stan
ford Invitational Diet Pepsi
Track Challenge over the week
end. This brainchild of Cardinal
track coach Brooks Johnson was
long on quantity and quality as
over 3,500 athletes, including
two Olympians and many
national champions, competed
in balmy weather at Stanford
Stadium. Several personal
records were set and an 11 -year
old stadium record broken dur
ing the meet.
Washington State's Samuel
Kibiry broke this vintage record
in the men's invitational mile.
Ray Brown, one of the
nation's top half-milers, helped
set an early swift pace in the
event, while Olympian Jeff
Atkinson, the American record
holder in the indoor 1,500
meters, and former 5,000 meter
national champion Matt Guisto
led the field.
Atkinson was a few steps
behind until Brown dropped out
on the third of four laps. For a
short while Atkinson held the
lead but on the last lap he was
overtaken by Stanford's Mark
Mastalir, Guisto, Kibiri and Indi
ana's Robert Kennedy.
Kibiri, who hails from Kenya,
pulled away from the pack with
a strong last 200 to finish in a
blistering 3:57.84. Kennedy fin
ished 2nd and Guisto 3rd. Both
broke the four minute mile bar
rier — the first time at the sta
dium that three people have

gone under four minutes in the
same race. Mastalir placed
fourth with a personal best of
4:00.85.
"Brooks told me to go out and
not run for respectibility; run for
the win. That's what 1 did when
I took the lead with a lap to go.
Those guys may be more fit than
I am but I gave myself a chance
(to win)," Mastalir said.
The women's mile was not
nearly as close, as 1988
Olympian and former Stanford
Ail-American PattiSue Plumer
broke for the lead at the start
and kept building on it. She
crossed the finish in 4:31.53.
"Given the effort I would
have liked to go under 4:30. It's
not a particularly fast track,
especially for distances," Plumer
said, "It has real wide tuns and
a soft track, which is great for
training. When you go to a really
good track its fun because all of a
sudden you get a bunch of PRs."
She said that racing here
after competing here in college
makes her nervous. "On one
hand I get extra nervous because
its my home stadium and I
always feel like I have an obliga
tion to run well here. On the
other hand I train here almost
every day so its hard to connect
that this is a race rather than
just a workout," Plumer said.
Besides the Olympians the
main attraction was the Pacific
Ten Conference versus Big Ten
Conference dual meet. Stars
from both conferences faced off
in field and track events with the
Pac-10 winning on the men's
side, 110-86, and the women's,

77-69.
Stanford's Chryste Gaines
won the women's 100 in a
scorching time of 11.67 seconds.
Jim Cramton was the lead-off
runner on the Pac-10's victori
ous mile relay team and Marcus
Hickerson won the men's long
jump.
Jackie Edwards just missed
her goal of 41 feet in the triple
jump as she leaped 40'11". She
finished second to Idaho's Jackie
Ross but garnered first place
points in the dual meet since
Idaho belongs to the Big Sky
Conference.
Edwards, however, was not
pleased with her jumps. On one
particular leap, she cleared 41
feet but landed off balance and
planted her hand behind her in
the pit, shaving at least half a
foot from her jump.
"All I could do was look back
at my hand and say 'Oh please
hand come back,'" Edwards
said.
Debbie Malueg also placed
well in the field as she finished
third in the shot put and fourth
in the discus. The winner in both
events was former Stanford
thrower Pam Dukes. Her 183'4"
toss in the discus was a personal
best.
Helping the Pac-10 cause was
Washington State's Augustin
Olobia, the national indoor 55
meter champion, lie won both
the 100 and 200 meters.
Top scorers for the Big-10
included teammates Mark
Croghan and Arnita Green of
Ohio State. Croghan is the 3,000
steeplechase national champion

and won that race easily on Sat
urday. Green was the lead-off
runner on the winning mile
relay team.
One of the highlights of the
meet was to be the University
Football 40. Two false starts,
however, probably slowed most
of the runners' starts. Michigan
State's Tico Duckett won with
Stanford's Jon Volpe coming in
second. Glyn Milburn pulled up
with a hamstring injury.
Although the Diet Pepsi
Track Challenge was the main
attraction Saturday, several
Stanford athletes performed
well in Friday's events. The Car
dinal men's distance medley
team of Alex Accetta, Cramton,
Dave Strang and Chris Rae won
easily. Accetta, however, was not
totally pleased with his lead leg.
"I should have beat the guy
handily but I went too early. I
should have started (my kick) at
100 (meters left in the leg)
instead of 300. I haven't run a
half mile in a while so its a shock
to my system but I did OK," he
said.
Stanford's women's distance
medley squad of Susan Helfter,
Rhonda Oliver, Ashley Back and
Melanie Bloch also won easily.
Dave Scudamore and Gary
Stoltz finished 1-2 in the 10,000
meters. In the field Stanford's
Ail-American heptathlete Peggy
Odita won the high jump and
Toby Norwood placed second in
the shot put.
