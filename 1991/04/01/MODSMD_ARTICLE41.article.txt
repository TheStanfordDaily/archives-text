# Shellshocked Stanford survives West Regional

LAS VEGAS — The moment
Trisha Stevens crashed to the
floor of the Thomas and Mack
Center just 31 seconds into Stan
ford's West Regional semifinal
game here, her college career
ended by a torn tendon, a return
trip to the Final Four for the Car
dinal women looked about as
likely as hitting three 7's on a slot
machine.
But with her team's inspira
tional leader sidelined, Stanford
coach Tara VanDerveer gambled
with young players and found the
winning combination that pro
pelled the Cardinal to a pair of
come-from-behind wins. The 73-
47 trouncing of the Washington
Huskies, followed by a 75-67
upset of top-seeded Georgia, sent
the team on to New Orleans with
the chance to win a second consec
utive national championship.
Although initially rattling the
defending champions, the injury
to Stevens may have proved a cat
alyst for Stanford. The Cardinal
had rolled over and played dead in
its final regular season game, sur
rendering a 34-8 run to lose by 26
at Oregon State, then trailed early
while looking sluggish in a 91-67
victory over Cal State-Fullerton in
the second round of the NCAA
tournament.
But after shooting a dismal 31
percent and falling behind by as
much as nine points to the
Huskies in the first half, Stanford
put the pieces back together with
a superb effort in the closing 20
minutes. A Christy Hedgpeth
three-pointer to open the second
half cut the deficit in half (from
six to three), and the Cardinal
shot 58 percent the rest of the

way, closing the contest with a
strangely familiar 34-8 run that
buried Washington.
"The whole thing with Trisha
was in a way motivational," said
forward Chris MacMurdo, who
replaced Stevens and made her
only shot and both her free throws
as well as grabbing five rebounds
against the Huskies. "I felt like
the whole team got closer in that
one game."
The Cardinal comeback was
paced by sophomore Val Whiting,
who led all players with 17 points
and 14 rebounds for her usual
double-double. Hedgpeth chipped
in 12, while fellow freshman Kelly
Dougherty provided inspiration
off the bench with a then-career
high 13 points.
"I thought Stanford's young
players were the best thing they
had going for them," Washington
coach Chris Gobrecht said.
"Dougherty kept them in the
game in the first half."
The victory avenged Stanford's
last-second 69-68 loss to the
Huskies on Feb. 9 which broke the
Cardinal's 42-game home win
streak. It was Washington's worst
loss since it fell by an identical
margin to Auburn in the regional
finals last season.
Good omens abounded before
Stanford's regional final game
against third-ranked Georgia, an
87-77 winner over Long Beach
State in the other semifinal.
Stevens' surgery, which she
decided to have in Las Vegas the
next morning in the hopes of com
ing to the game, was successful.
Later that day, on the way to see
her center in the hospital, Van-
Derveer put three dollars in a slot
machine and saw three 7's come
up — a one thousand dollar wind
fall.

The Cardinal didn't start Sat
urday's game so auspiciously,
however, and again shot less than
40 percent (39) and trailed at the
half, this time by five. Stanford,
missing Stevens' presence inside,
gave up numerous layups to the
Lady Dogs' Stacey Ford and Lady
Hardmon while Georgia forward
Tammye Jenkins controlled the
boards with nine rebounds.
To make matters worse, junior
foward Julie Zeilstra was clearly

struggling with her bad Achilles
tendons, a condition so serious
that she very nearly did not suit
up (she was cleared to play 11
minutes before tipoff). The prob
lem had forced the Cardinal's
leading scorer (20 points per
game) to miss the Oregon State
loss, and Zeilstra had not played
two games in one weekend in
almost a month before the
regional.
But even when Southeastern

Conference champion Georgia
upped the lead to 12 with just
under 12 minutes to go in the
game, the Cardinal refused to
panic. Senior point guard Sonja
Henning, who had her first career
triple-double with 19 po'nts, 10
assists and 10 rebounds against
Fullerton, calmly directed a Stan
ford resurgence.
Just five minutes later, five

rival Washington and high-powered Georgia to earn a trip to New Orleans.
