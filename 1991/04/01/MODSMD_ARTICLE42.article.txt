# Never-say-die Cardinal never stopped believing

### Tyson Vaughan Senior staff writer 
NEW ORLEANS — Going into the home
stretch of Stanford's title-defending season,
Coach Tara VanDerveer liked to talk about
her team's attitude, always praising the
players' selflessness and enthusiasm.
Throughout the NCAA tournament they
supported her words with action on the
court. The message was clear: This was a
team with heart.
In the regional semifinals, the Cardinal
players faced their Pacific 10 Conference
nemesis Washington. Within the first
minute of the game they watched senior co
captain Trisha Stevens go down with a col
legiate career-ending knee injury. Shell

shocked, they struggled for 20 minutes,
falling behind 30-24 by halftime.
But they came together in the second
half behind the emotion of playing for their
downed leader, outscoring the Huskies by
an incredible margin of 49-17 to claim a 73-
47 victory.
Stanford next faced a Georgia team that
was heavily favored despite having previ
ously met defeat at Maples. VanDerveer
called them "the most talented team in the
country." With 12 minutes left in the con
test, the Cardinal found itself down by 12
points.
Once again, the players dug deep and
pulled out the upset, 75-67. Sonja Hogg,
architect of Louisiana Tech's paradigmatic
women's basketball program, wrote in a

(New Orleans) Times-Picayune column
that the Cardinal won "because they
wanted to defend their title so badly."
In the Final Four, Stanford's amazing,
shrinking front line found itself without
the inside services of leading scorer Julie
Zeilstra against perhaps the most physi
cally dominant team in the country, Ten
nessee. When center Val Whiting came out
with two fouls in the first half, it looked like
the Cardinal was hopelessly outmanned.
Yet, Stanford hung tough for a few min
utes, playing inspired basketball against
the frustrated Lady Vols. Then the Cardi
nal really put it together three minutes
before halftime, going on a 6-0 run to put
themselves up 28-21 at intermission.
Eventually, despite all their emotion and

their desire to repeat as champions, Stan
ford's players simply found themselves
overmatched, finally falling, 68-60.
"There are some real strong young
women on this team," said VanDerveer
afterward. "They didn't get discouraged.
They didn't give up. They paid the price to
win, but it wasn't enough."
"We played our hearts out," said Chris
MacMurdo. "I'm just sorry we couldn't fin
ish better for Trisha and Sonja. They're
two of the best people I've ever known."
When MacMurdo's frontcourt mate
Kelly Dougherty was asked if she was proud
of her career-best performance, she replied,
"I feel proud of our whole team. We played
hard. We kept at it. That's our attitude:
never say die."
