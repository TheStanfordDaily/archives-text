# Three KOs
## Netters display championship form in a trio of dominant wins 
### Gretchen Atwood Staff writer 
Experience may be on the side
of the Stanford women's tennis
team. Talent and Lady Luck may
be there as well, but Mother
Nature surely isn't.
Several weeks ago, rainstorms
caused the cancelation of the
team's rematch with now top
ranked Florida. And last Tues
day's match with the third-ranked
Georgia Bulldogs was nearly
rained out as well.
But after a rainy morning, the
sun split through the clouds and a
rainbow appeared over deGuerre
Pool. As the weather returned to
typical spring form, so did the
Cardinal netters.
The result was what Stanford
tennis fans have gotten used to
over the past few years: crushing
top teams and clinching team
match victories in singles play.
Many people may have antici
pated a closer match since the
Bulldogs pushed the team to 5-4
in the semifinals of the National
Team Indoor Championships.
This time, however, team co-cap
tain Sandra Birch was back in the
lineup and Debbie Graham's
shoulder was healthy. Also, the
team felt like they had something
to prove after losing to Florida.
"Our attitude was that no one
was going to have it easy. We
wanted to tell Georgia that when
you come here for nationals, we're

going to be tough on our home
courts," Graham said. "We
wanted to prove what we have
been in the past. The win really
helped our confidence."
Most of the matches were tight
at the beginning. Birch, ranked
third in the collegiate singles poll,
was down 2-1 in the first set
against fifth-ranked Shannan
McCarthy. Then the momentum
shifted and Birch won the set
after a 20-minute rain delay.
McCarthy began to fall apart in
the second set and Birch cruised
6-2 for the victory.
Graham also cruised. She beat
Caryn Moss 6-0, 6-1, which sur
prised her a bit considering the
circumstances. She had worked
out in the morning because she
didn't think the match would be
played. Then it cleared up but she
was stuck at Tower Records
because her car would not start.
"I was stuck there for 45 min
utes. I couldn't get a hold of any
one. They delayed the match for
me and (coach) Frank (Brennan)
had to pick me up. I ran on to the
court and only warmed up for
about five minutes. I played really
well, it was weird," Graham said.
Her lack of nerves also sur
prised her during the rain delay.
"Usually I get uptight during rain
delays, but I didn't and I still had
the momentum," she added.
One player who definitely ben
efited from the delay was senior
co-captain Teri Whitlinger. She

what we have been in
the past. The win real
ly helped our confi
dence.'

was down 4-1 in the first set
against Angela Lettiere but, after
the rain delay, stormed back to
win nine straight games and even
tually take the match 6-4, 6-4.
Heather Willens was stretched
to three sets before closing out her
match against Laura Kimel 2-6, 6-
1, 6-3. "Neither of us played that
well. It came down to mental
toughness. I was a little nervous
because it was my first match
after losing four straight at
National Indoors," Willens said.
Stanford clinched the team vic
tory with Laxmi Poruri's 6-2,6-1
trouncing of Shawn McCarthy.
The team's only loss was at num
ber six singles. Kylie Johnson
dropped a close three-setter to
Tonya Bogdonas 4-6, 7-5, 6-4. The
doubles matches were canceled.
The netters also played Pepper
dine and the University of San
Diego last week. They swept Pep
perdine 6-0 despite heavy winds
and Willens having to play with
blistered feet, which she got dur
ing her match with Kimel. The
team also crushed San Diego 6-0.

Senior Sandra Birch and her teammates were awesome over spring break. The No. 2-ranked Cardinal
netters easily thrashed Georgia, San Diego and Pepperdine.
