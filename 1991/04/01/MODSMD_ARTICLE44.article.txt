# No baloney for Card nine at Oscar Mayer Classic
## But Gophers keep Stanford from taking title 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
Yesterday's 9-3 loss to host Minnesota
cost the Stanford baseball team both its
20th win of the season and the champi
onship of the Oscar Mayer Baseball Clas
sic. However, the loss wound up a week
end that saw the 19-9 Cardinal win two
out of three games and let the team for
get about the slump they had brought to
the land of a thousand lakes.
Stanford went into the Minneapolis
Metrodome the unhappy owners of a five
game skid, and found No. 25 ranked
Notre Dame the perfect thing to make
them smile again. The Cardinal opened
the tournament with a 7-3 victory over
the Fighting Irish by scoring four runs
in the bottom of the eighth inning to
break a 3-3 tie and give starter John
Reid his fourth win of the season.
After beating Arizona on March 2, the
Cardinal had waited 27 days for a win,
and with two outs in the eighth, second
baseman Chris Kemper made sure that
the team would wait no longer. Kemper's
two-run double made the score 5-3, and
two batters later Steve Solomon doubled
hgme two more to seal the victory.
Reid began the game by giving up
four hits in the first four innings, but
then no-hit the Irish until reliever Scott
Weiss took over, picking up a career high
10 strikeouts along the way.
Saturday highlighted the return of
injured starter Brian Sackinsky The
right-handed sophomore made his first
start of the year after missing half the
season with an arm injury. Sackinsky
lasted only 3.1 innings and gave up eight
hits before bowing out to eventual win
ner Aaron Dorlarque, but the story of
this game was not the pitching.
The Cardinal scored seven runs in the
first two innings on the way to a season
high 20 hits and was never challenged by
the Bruins. Every member of the Stan
ford lineup got at least one base hit, and
five starters had multi-hit games.
Ryan Turner led the offensive attack
with a homer and two doubles, driving in
five runs. Shortstop Roger Burnett also

had four hits, and Solomon and center
fielder David Cornell each had three.
UCLA also had its way with the Stan
ford pitching staff, collecting 18 hits off
Sackinsky, Dorlarque and Weiss, but
Dorlarque still managed improve his
record on the year to 4-1.
"Aaron had a good fastball, but poor
location," Stanford head coach Mark
Marquess said. "His arm seems to feel
fine though."
But the day belonged to Turner. The
senior left fielder went 4 for 5 and effec
tively erased the memory of his pre-tour
nament slump that saw the career .305
hitter batting in the low ,200s.
"Ryan worked extremely hard to get
out of his slump by taking extra batting
practice," Marquess said. "He's really
coming into his own. You can tell he is
hitting well because he's hitting the ball
to all fields."
Turner wound up hitting .615 and
driving in seven runs over the weekend,
but his two hit one RBI performance in
the championship game was not enough
to stop the Gophers. Behind a complete
game gem by Scott Bakkum, Minnesota
was able to win its second game of the
weekend and take the tournament title
for the first time in its seven-year exis
tence.
Behind 3-1 in the fourth, Stanford
had a chance to break the game open
with the bases loaded and no outs, but
only managed two runs. Bakkum walked
in a run, and then Solomon hit into a
double play (scoring a run) and Burnett
flied out, leaving the game tied and the
Gophers breathing a sigh of relief.
Stanford let the game get away in the
next three innings as starter Willie
Adams was unable to get out the lead-off
runners in the fourth and fifth and gave
up three runs. Tim Moore came in as
relief, but could do no better, giving up
three earned runs in the sixth.
"We couldn't stop [Minnesota]; they
did a great job of executing," Marquess
said. "We hit the ball hard, but the prob
lem was we hit it right at them."
