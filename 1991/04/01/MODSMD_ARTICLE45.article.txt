# Stanford sharp in Pac-10 openers

Neither wind nor rain could stop the
Stanford Cardinal.
Dead Week and finals couldn't either.
Two weeks off, exams and numerous
rained out practices apparently took no
toll on the men's tennis team. The
third-ranked squad picked up right
where it had left off at the conclusion of
the preseason — with dominating victo
ries.
Stanford rolled its season record up
to 11-1 by taking all three of its matches
during Spring Break. The Cardinal
bageled Fresno State 9-0 Wednesday
March 27, opened up league play with a
7-1 victory over Arizona last Friday and
downed pesky Arizona State 7-2 Satur
day.
Coach Dick Gould was extremely
pleased with the Cardinal's showing.
"I was really impressed with the com
petitiveness of all the guys after Dead
Week, finals and tons of rain," Gould
said. "As a coach I'm looking for a team
that competes well, can stay in the
matches and can play focused. [Stan
ford] did so on all three occasions."
The Sun Devils proved to be Stan

ford's toughest opponent during last
week's play. With recuperating
Jonathan Stark out of the singles
lineup, the bottom of the order moved
up a notch against a competitive ASU
squad. And was forced into a number of
three-set matches.
Playing at No. 1 singles, Alex O'Brien
was taken to three sets, as was Jared
Palmer at No. 2. Jason Yee, competing
at No. 3 after two matches at No. 4 sin
gles, was also stretched to the limit
before pulling out another singles vic
tory for the Cardinal. Michael Flanagan
was defeated 6-3, 6-4 at No. 4, while
Vimal Patel went down in three in the
fifth slot. Glenn Solomon pulled out a 6-
4, 6-4 victory to send the Cardinal into
doubles with a 4-2 advantage.
"We were struggling against Arizona
State but everyone stayed in their
matches," Gould explained. "We could
easily have been down 2-4 after singles,
but we were up 4-2 because of the guys'
great mental approach and competitive
ness."
The highlight of the match was
Stark-Palmer's doubles performance in
the No. 1 match. The duo demolished
the Sun Devil's David Lomicky and
Brian Gyetko — one of the nation's top
teams. Playing together for the first

time since the two-week layoff, Stark
and Palmer cruised to a rapid 6-1, 6-2
victory, clinching the match for the Car
dinal and setting the pace for the
remaining two doubles squads.
O'Brien-Yee and Patel-Chris Cocotos'
wins wrapped up a 7-2 conference vic
tory.
Friday, Stanford had little trouble
with the Wildcats. O'Brien ran up a 6-4,
6-4 victory at No. 1 singles, but Palmer
took it down to the bitter end before
pulling out a 7-6, 5-7, 7-6 cliff-hanger at
No. 2. Stark, playing in only his second
singles competition since returning
from a stress-fracture, looked dominat
ing in a 6-2, 6-3 win at No. 3.
"After a shaky showing in February
Alex played very well," Gould said. "He
had three tough, gutsy, competitive
matches. Jared also did a nice job at No.
2."
Flanagan cruised to a 6-1, 6-4 victory
at No. 5 singles, and Patel wrapped up
the team 'W' with a 1-6, 6-1, 6-4 see-saw
win. The Cardinal's lone singles defeat
came when Yee was downed in three —
a 6-4, 3-6, 6-2 loss — in the No. 4 match.
Stanford's No. 2 and 3 doubles teams of
O'Brien and Yee and Cocotos and Patel
had no trouble racking up two more
wins for the Cardinal.
