# Volleyballers spike losing streak
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
It was almost a very good spring
break for the men's volleyball team.
The squad brought a seven-match
losing streak into finals week, but hoped
a two-week break and matches against
weaker teams from California and Ohio
State would help them get a break from
their woes. They did just that; however,
the cure ended up being only temporary.
Stanford beat the club team from Cal
15-5, 15-6, 15-7 March 23 in a match
that does not count on the squad's
record, then officially ended the losing
streak with an 11-15, 15-12, 12-15, 15-
10, 15-11 victory over the 14th-ranked
Buckeyes exactly a week ago.
But when the Cardinal returned to
Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Asso
ciation play last Thursday at No. 12
Loyola Marymount, the momentum
proved to be not quite enough. The Car
dinal dropped a heart-breaking 15-9, 14-

16, 15-9, 8-15, 17-15 decision to the
Lions, then fell to No. 3 San Diego State
15-11, 15-13, 15-10 Saturday.
Stanford, now 6-10 overall, 4-9 in the
WIVA and ranked ninth, plays at
fourth-ranked Cal State-Northridge
tonight to complete the three-match
Southern California swing.
After the break for finals, Stanford
hosted the Golden Bears and beat them
handily for the second time this year.
Two days later, the Cardinal looked to
end its losing streak against Ohio State,
in the third contest of a five-match West
Coast trip for the Buckeyes.
Stanford started slowly, trying sev
eral different lineups before finally
pulling out games four and five. Duncan
Blackman had a match-high 29 kills,
four aces and 12 digs to lead Stanford.
Freshman middle blocker Joe
Burghardt also shined, recording 11
kills, eight digs, six blocks and a .600
hitting percentage in his first official
start.

But then the Cardinal hit the road to
meet an LMU team that Stanford had
swept earlier in the season. Chuck Don
lon and Sio Saipaia had 26 kills each,
hitting .553 and .380, respectively, to
lead the Lions. Burghardt again was the
Cardinal hero, recording 16 kills, eight
digs, 10 blocks and hitting .448. The
Cardinal fought back strongly from a
two-games-to-one deficit, but fell just
short in the quick-scoring fifth game.
Saturday, Stanford again did a lot of
things right without getting a win to
show for it. The Cardinal hit .411 as a
team, including posting a .556 mark in
the first game, but still fell in three
straight. The Aztecs hit .518 for the
entire contest and pounded at a .667 clip
in the first game.
Dave Goss hit .500 with 28 kills and
Blackman hit .467 with 20 kills to pace
the Cardinal attack. But San Diego
State's hitters were even hotter than
Stanford's and the Cardinal defense
could not stop them.
