## 
### Miranda Doyle Staff writer 
The newly appointed ASSU
financial manager Michael Risch
will be responsible for an operat
ing budget of about $350,000 next
year, but with three years of expe
rience in the ASSU, he knows
what he is getting into.
"I have been given a tremen
dous charge," said Risch, a junior
majoring in economics and public
policy. He said he plans to make
his responsibilities as financial
manager top priority, decreasing
his course load to take on the
almost full-time position.
Risch will be in charge of over
seeing the ASSU operating bud
get, his professional and student

staff of eight, six business pro
jects, the fee refund system and
the disbursement of funds to stu
dent organizations.
Risch was an office supervisor
for the Council of Presidents his
freshman year. He then helped
with the business projects. This
year, he manages the lecture notes
service and the linen service.
Risch will assume his new posi
tion at the beginning of summer.
This quarter, he will be the associ
ate financial manager of the
ASSU, and will work with the cur
rent financial manager, Torrence
Boone, to learn about his new
position.
"I have had a great mentor.
Torrence is very well respected,"
Risch said.

Boone said Risch has done an
"excellent job" as project man
ager. "We project record revenues
for lecture notes this year," Boone
said. "It is a credit to Mike."
A number of well-qualified stu
dents applied for the position,
Boone said, but Risch was chosen
because he "has a lot of the quan
titative and analytical skills" that
are important as well as experi
ence with the ASSU. Risch was
appointed after interviews with
Boone, members of the senate and
the COR
Besides his work with the busi
ness projects, Risch is the finan
cial manager at the Phi Sig self
operative and coordinates the
local government internships at
Haas Public Service Center.

Risch said he plans to pick up
more specific goals as he learns
about the position, but would like
to make the business projects
more visible.
"Most students do not see the
ASSU beyond lecture notes or
Sunday Flicks," he said. "I want
people to know what the ASSU
does."
Risch said he will also try to
handle expected budget cuts with
out cutting services and answer
senate questions about the finan
cial effects of bylaw changes.
Risch added that he is very
excited about being financial man
ager. The job is on "a different
scale" from his experience as stu
dent body treasurer in high
school, he said.
