### Virginia Broke Staff writer 
Hundreds of defective condoms
were accidentally distributed last
month in the annual condom rat
ing contest, according to an
employee of the Ye Olde Safer Sex
Shoppe, which sponsors the event.
"This was totally unplanned,"
said shop manager Portia Dove.
"It's especially disastrous because
we found out so late in the term
and couldn't get the news out
until after the break."
The culpable condoms, unlu
bricated "Spartans," were manu
factured by Ishitzu, a Japanese
firm based in Pittsburgh, Pa.
Juniors Anthony Trueman and
Joanne McClure said they discov
ered the faulty prophylactics dur
ing a room-decorating prank con
ceived during a poker game.
"We decided to turn our RA's
room into a 'condominium'," of
water-filled condoms, Trueman
joked. "But the Spartan just
couldn't hold water."
McClure added, "It was pretty
messy."
The pair contacted the shop
after they found many of their
friends had also discovered holes
in the Spartan condoms they
received in the contest packets.

Ishitzu spokesman Ralph
Perkins said the faulty batch was
a result of miscommunication
between Sex Shoppe employees
and his firm.
"It's hard when a screwup like
this happens," Perkins said.
"We thought the condoms
were only going to be tested in a
'dry run.' We had no idea they
might actually be used for protec
tion."
Dove said condom contest
donation requirements were
straightforward. "We said con
doms would be tested for appear
ance, taste, texture and durabil
ity."
Dove estimates that roughly
900 Spartans were distributed in
the February give-away. ASSU
Legal Services has been con
tracted to probe the glitch.
Although most students do not
use the contest condoms for con
traception, Dove said, "There are
some Stanford students who actu
ally have sex. They may be at risk
if they used a Spartan."
John Dorman, director of pub
lic relations and outreach for
Cowell Student Health Center,
said there has not been an
increase of pregnancy tests on
account of the snafu, although it
may be too soon to tell.
