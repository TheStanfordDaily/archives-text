# Hoover Tower to be refurbished
## 
### Peter Robison Staff writer 
Construction has begun on a
$650,000 renovation of Hoover
Tower's lobby and exhibit rooms
that will be accompanied by sev
eral new displays.
The remodeling is targeted for
completion by June 1 and will
coincide with the building's 50th
anniversary on June 20.
The renovation will not affect
access to the Hoover Institution's
library, but the exhibit rooms,
which are adjacent to the lobby,
will be closed until the work is
completed, said Charles Palm,
deputy director of the Institution.
The project is something that
had to be done, Palm said,
because the "exhibit spaces
haven't been refurbished since
the mid-19605." The money for
the project was provided by a gift
from the Margaret W. and Her
bert Hoover Jr. Foundation.

Plans for the main lobby include the construc
tion of a circular reception counter to replace
the desks now being used.

Plans for the main lobby
include the construction of a cir
cular reception counter to replace
the desks now being used. Display
cases will be placed at each corner
of the lobby and will feature spe
cial historical objects related to
the larger showings in the two
adjacent exhibit rooms.
The lobby will also be
repainted, and improved lighting
will be installed to emphasize the
architectural detail of the domed
ceiling.
The Herbert Hoover and the
Lou Henry Hoover exhibit rooms
will be repainted, and new light
ing, drapes and carpeting will be
added.

The new display cases and
exhibits will contain documents
and artifacts from the Institu
tion's collections. Items to be dis
played in the Herbert Hoover
Room range from President
Hoover's fishing gear to a Peru
vian funeral plaque that was
given to him during a 1928 "good
neighbor" tour in Latin America.
The Lou Henry Hoover Room
will focus on the interests of
Hoover's wife, which included
scholarship, volunteerism and
humanitarian work. It will also
feature her collections of Chinese
porcelain, Belgian lace and silver
from many countries.
