# '20/20' was 'extremely unfair,' Kennedy says
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
"20/20's" vision of Stanford's indirect
cost controversy was far from perfect, Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy charged
in an interview last week.
"I think the program was extremely
unfair," Kennedy said of the March 15 seg
ment that ran on the ABC's weekly news
program.
"I think the producer of that program
was a bit like the scientist who has a
hypothesis when he starts and believes in it
so strongly that it determines the out
come," he said.
The segment, titled "Your tax dollars at
work," focused on many of the controver
sial items that have been included in Stan
ford's indirect cost recovery claims during
the last decade — receptions at Hoover
House, the 72-foot yacht Victoria and par
ties held before football games at Lake
House, the University-owned residence of
Robert Freelen, vice president for public
affairs.
Bill Willson, who produced the piece for
"20/20," said he stands by his story.
Kennedy, he said, was given ample time on
camera to defend Stanford's practices.
In a speech to alumni in Los Angeles,
Kennedy compared Stanford's treatment

by the show to that of a "mugging."
"I think it was a mugging," he explained
to The Daily last week, "because they had
selected a victim and did not go into the
issue planning to do an objective piece of
reporting, but rather to make an institu
tion look bad."
The segment on Stanford ran during the
same episode as Barbara Walters' much
publicized interview with Gen. Norman
Schwarzkopf, leader of the allied forces in
the Persian Gulf war. The interview with
Schwarzkopf garnered "20/20" its highest
ratings in five years and made it the third
most-watched show on television that
week.
"I'm a great admirer of Schwarzkopf,"
Kennedy said. "He's quite a terrific person.
Obviously he attracted a large audience, so
it was a very unfortunate contrast for us to
have a piece that was almost adoring in its
character next to one that was a strong hit
piece."
Kennedy said the segment on Stanford
was riddled with errors, most notably the
assertion that a $1,610 shower curtain for
his personal bathroom had been included in
the University's indirect cost bills to the
government.
"20/20" displayed an unidentified hand
written document of the charge. "All we
know is that it wasn't a Stanford voucher."

Kennedy said. Willson said the document
was from an auditor's worksheet, but
would not provide any other specifics.
An invoice given to The Daily by Stan
ford shows that the $1,610 charge appears
to be for three items: the shower curtain
and two window shades. According to the
vendor, the total cost of the shower curtain
was no more than $225.
Stanford officials said a letter was faxed
to "20/20" on the day of the broadcast stat
ing that the shower charge was incorrect.
Larry Horton, associate vice president for
public affairs, said he first learned that the
shower curtain would be part of the broad
cast earlier that day during casual conver
sation with Willson. Willson said he did not
receive the letter until after the broadcast
had run.
"We had to patrol constantly to make
sure the error-load in the ultimate produc
tion was as low as it was," Kennedy said.
The show also contained several mis
leading juxtapositions of images and narra
tive, Kennedy said. When discussing liquor
charges from receptions at Freelen's home,
racks of wine in a local liquor store were
displayed, leaving the viewer with the
impression that vast quantities of liquor is
stored in Freelen's residence, Kennedy
said.

While correspondent Stone Phillips
spoke of Hoover House receptions, the
footage shown was of a recent alumni func
tion in Washington, D.C. The function was
held in the "elegant surroundings" of the
Senate caucus room, not in Hoover House
as the viewer was led to believe, Kennedy
said.
Furthermore, Kennedy said, the event
was paid for by the Stanford Club of Wash
ington and not with Hoover House funds.
Willson said "20/20" would have pre
ferred to shoot actual receptions at Hoover
House, but were told they were not allowed
to do so.
Kennedy said if he had to do it over
again, he would reconsider allowing
"20/20" to interview him inside Hoover
House "and take all the loving shots that
they wanted of the interior."
He never considered refusing an inter
view, however.
"It does you absolutely no good to run,"
he said. "Have you seen a '20/20' program
when the chief executive officer refuses to
go on television? They do what they call the
ambush shot. They get the shot of your der
riere going into the office door as you're
fleeing the cameras to avoid being inter
viewed. It's sort of a 'heads, I win; tails, you
lose' proposition."

assertion that a $1,610 shower curtain for
his personal bathroom had been included in
the University's indirect cost bills to the
government.
"20/20" displayed an unidentified hand
written document of the charge. "All we
know is that it wasn't a Stanford voucher."

Kennedy said. Willson said the document
was from an auditor's worksheet, but
would not provide any other specifics.
An invoice given to The Daily by Stan
ford shows that the $1,610 charge appears
to be for three items: the shower curtain
and two window shades. According to the
vendor, the total cost of the shower curtain
was no more than $225.
Stanford officials said a letter was faxed
to "20/20" on the day of the broadcast stat
ing that the shower charge was incorrect.
Larry Horton, associate vice president for
public affairs, said he first learned that the
shower curtain would be part of the broad
cast earlier that day during casual conver
sation with Willson. Willson said he did not
receive the letter until after the broadcast
had run.
"We had to patrol constantly to make
sure the error-load in the ultimate produc
tion was as low as it was," Kennedy said.
The show also contained several mis
leading juxtapositions of images and narra
tive, Kennedy said. When discussing liquor
charges from receptions at Freelen's home,
racks of wine in a local liquor store were
displayed, leaving the viewer with the
impression that vast quantities of liquor is
stored in Freelen's residence, Kennedy
said.

While correspondent Stone Phillips
spoke of Hoover House receptions, the
footage shown was of a recent alumni func
tion in Washington, D.C. The function was
held in the "elegant surroundings" of the
Senate caucus room, not in Hoover House
as the viewer was led to believe, Kennedy
said.
Furthermore, Kennedy said, the event
was paid for by the Stanford Club of Wash
ington and not with Hoover House funds.
Willson said "20/20" would have pre
ferred to shoot actual receptions at Hoover
House, but were told they were not allowed
to do so.
Kennedy said if he had to do it over
again, he would reconsider allowing
"20/20" to interview him inside Hoover
House "and take all the loving shots that
they wanted of the interior."
He never considered refusing an inter
view, however.
"It does you absolutely no good to run,"
he said. "Have you seen a '20/20' program
when the chief executive officer refuses to
go on television? They do what they call the
ambush shot. They get the shot of your der
riere going into the office door as you're
fleeing the cameras to avoid being inter
viewed. It's sort of a 'heads, I win; tails, you
lose' proposition."
