# Card to play NCAA hoops champion
## Source: Montgomery may head for Notre Dame at season's end

When the Stanford men's basketball team
downed Oklahoma last Wednesday to capture
the championship of the National Invitation
Tournament, everyone assumed the Cardi
nal's season was over.
Everyone was wrong.
Next Saturday at 1 p.m., in a made-for-CBS
showdown at the Oakland Coliseum, Stanford
will play the NCAA champion, which will of
course be Kansas or Duke. The winner will be
declared National Champion Champion.
"Obviously, we're very excited," coach Mike
Montgomery said. "When we lost (Andrew)
Vlahov to injury, our NCAA hopes were
dimmed. Now we'll have the chance to prove
we can play with anybody "
Said star center Adam Keefe: "Bring 'em

on. I would've liked to play UNLV, but this is
just such a great way to end my college
career." For those of you who missed it, Keefe
announced Thursday that he would turn pro
fessional and enter the National Basketball
Association draft this June.
Stan Billiken, a spokesman for the NIT,
said he dropped the gauntlet of challenge at
the NCAA because "we're tired of playing sec
ond fiddle. We used to be the number one post
season tournament and we want to show
everyone what the NIT tradition is all about."
CBS analyst Billy Packer, who worked with
Billiken to make the fantasy matchup a real
ity, added: "It's a great day for college basket
ball. The kids really want to keep playing and,
besides, this game should draw a great televi
sion audience. People are excited about seeing
future pros like Adam Keefe while they're still
in school."

Ironically, Keefe's departure may not be the
only major loss Stanford will suffer at season's
end. Current Notre Dame coach Digger Phelps
is being quietly forced out and a source close to
the Fighting Irish said Montgomery is near
the top of a short list of possible replacements.
Stanford's coach said he would not com
ment about any career moves until after next
weekend's game. But it is clear that a victory
over the NCAA champion would be quite the
feather in Montgomery's cap. His reputation
for running a clean program and succeeding
despite academic restrictions would seem to
work out well at Notre Dame.
Though the Cardinal will not know its
opponent until after tonight's NCAA title
game, both Duke and Kansas provide intrigu
ing matchups for Stanford. A Blue Devil-Car-
