# Kennedy apologizes for indirect cost 'mess'

### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
Saddled with overwhelming
negative publicity about Stan
ford's indirect-cost policies, Uni
versity President Donald
Kennedy offered an apology to
members of "the Stanford family"
in a speech during spring break.
"If you are embarrassed or
angry over what has been said
about us, you're in good com
pany," he told alumni in Los
Angeles on March 23. "I take full
responsibility for the manage
ment of the institution, and I am
sorry to have let you down."
Kennedy also announced that
the University would begin a
management audit "to determine
how we got into this mess and
what should be done to assure
that it does not recur." The exam
ination, Kennedy said, "will start

â–  Kennedy calls '20/20'
segment 'extremely
unfair,' back page

right in the president's office and
work down."
In an interview with The Daily
last week, Kennedy said he had
not established a firm timetable
for the review, but said he hoped
it would be completed by the end
of spring quarter.
"Bad outcomes don't necessar
ily mean systems are wrong or
defective," Kennedy said. "But
you certainly have to ask yourself
the question if you get a bad out
come. What went wrong? Is there
something that we can do to fix
this? I think it's plain there are
areas where we slipped up."
Kennedy's comments came

less than two weeks after he testi
fied in front of a hostile House
Subcommittee on Oversight and
Investigations, chaired by Rep.
John Dingell, D-Mich. In a seven
hour hearing on March 13,
Kennedy received several
scathing lectures from congress
men on the need for more respon
sible management of federal
research funds.
Kennedy and the controversy
have received widespread atten
tion in the local and national
media, including a March 15 seg
ment on "20/20," the ABC weekly
news program.
"When several congressmen
are highly critical of an institu
tion, where it gets national televi
sion exposure, you have to con
clude that it's damaging to an
institution's reputation,"
