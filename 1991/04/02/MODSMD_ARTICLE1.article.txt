# Greek lodge may be built

Following the denial of a proposal to allow the
Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity to build a house, Univer
sity officials are once again considering establishing
a lodge for unhoused Greek organizations.
Sororities, all of which are unhoused, support the
idea of establishing a lodge, which would be used as
a recreational center and meeting place. However, at
least three unhoused fraternities, including Alpha
Epsilon Pi, oppose it. Members of those fraternities
say building a lodge would foreclose the possibility of
having more housed fraternities.
Administrators have discussed the idea of a lodge
for several years. The lodge could be used for holding
chapter meetings, storing files and hosting small
functions. But questions of funding and location
have not yet been resolved, said acting Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Norm Robinson.
Although no formal plans or proposals have been
developed, a preliminary design committee of frater
nity and sorority members and alumni advisers has
been established, said Allison Sandy, an adviser for
sororities at the Office of Student Activities.
A committee organized last spring to plan the
lodge contacted an architect who prepared drawings
to be used with a proposal, said Sandy. The proposal
was never submitted to University administrators
because of difficulties finding funding.
Intersorority Council President Erin Scalley said
funding would have to be a joint effort between
alumni and students. "In order to get a lodge, we'd
have to work for it," she said.
Sororities would support building a lodge because
"having some sort of space would be really helpful,"
she said. "When the idea has been thrown out
before, all the sororities have been supportive."
However, several unhoused fraternities feel quite
differently. Alpha Epsilon Pi, Sigma Nu and Sigma
Phi Epsilon each oppose the concept of a lodge
because it would likely prevent them from gaining
campus housing, said Interfraternity Council Presi
dent Erik Jorgensen.
"A lodge would be the final nail in the coffin to the
open dialogue about fraternal housing," said Jor
gensen.
