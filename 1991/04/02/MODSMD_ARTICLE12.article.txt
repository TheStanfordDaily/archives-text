# U.S. accuses 52 companies of aiding Saddam
## Two American firms cited 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Two American busi
nesses are among 52 "front" companies around the
world that helped Saddam Hussein's family hide bil
lions of dollars skimmed from Iraq's oil revenues,
the Treasury Department said yesterday.
The department also identified 37 individuals
around the world it said acted as middlemen for the
Iraqi government.
The Treasury said all transactions falling under
U.S. jurisdiction with the companies and middlemen
are equivalent to doing business with the Iraqi gov
ernment and are prohibited without its permission.
Violations carry criminal penalties of up to $1 mil
lion for both companies and individuals and prison
terms of up to 12 years.
Civil penalties of up to $250,000 also may be
imposed, the Treasury said in a statement.
The two U.S. companies are Bay Industries Inc.,
an engineering firm in Santa Monica, Calif., and
Matrix Churchill Corp., a machine tools company in
Cleveland, Ohio.
There were no answers to repeated phone calls to
Bay Industries in Santa Monica and no. immediate
comment from Matrix Churchill.
Treasury agents seized the assets of Bay Indus
tries on March 22, along with those of Anees Wadi
and his wife Shamsaban al-Hayderi. The govern
ment alleged that all three had helped Saddam pro
cure arms for Iraq. The department seized Matrix
Churchill's assets last September.
The Treasury also listed Iraqi Airways offices in
Los Angeles; Southfield, Mich, and New York City as
being among the front companies.
The Treasury named 49 other Iraqi front compa
nies, more than 30 of which are based in Britain.
Others are located in Egypt, Brazil, Germany, Italy
and Honduras.
"Exposing these companies and individuals
strikes a blow at Iraq's subterranean network in the
world of arms trading and clandestine financial oper
ations," Treasury Deputy Secretary John Robson
said in the statement.
The department also identified 160 merchant
ships owned or controlled by the Iraqi government.
It said U.S. companies and individuals are prohibited
from using the ships, subject to the same penalties as
doing business with the front companies and agents.
Today's announcement was part of an ongoing
investigation by the U.S. and Kuwaiti governments
into Iraq's worldwide financial and arms trading
network. The probe found that Saddam, who took
power in 1979, is one of the world's richest men.
The investigation determined that the Iraqi pres

ident's family skimmed $10 billion in oil profits since
1981 and used the money to buy pieces of companies
in Europe and the United States.
Iraqi investors working for Saddam have pur
chased nearly $1 billion in shares of publicly traded
companies, including French media giant Hachette
SA, according to the chief investigator, Jules Kroll.
The Treasury and State departments and the
FBI, in cooperation with Kuwaiti authorities and
Kroll, have been investigating Saddam's finances

since Iraq invaded Kuwait last Aug. 2, a U.S. govern
ment source said last week.
The results of the investigation likely will be used
in war reparations claims against Iraq by Kuwait,
Saudi Arabia and Israel.
The Treasury said recently it has seized or is
preparing to seize an estimated $1 billion to $1.5 bil
lion of assets in the United States owned by Saddam
or the Iraqi government.
