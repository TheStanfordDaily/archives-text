# Moscow food stores close in light of price-hike panic-buying

MOSCOW (AP) — Food stores in the
Soviet capital closed yesterday to curb
panic-buying on the eve of whopping
nationwide price hikes. City officials
warned of unrest, and bakers boosted out
put for an avalanche of shoppers.
"We haven't had time to unload the
bread from one truck to another!" said
Nina Vorokina, controller at a major bread
store on Novoarbat Prospect.
Long lines also formed outside bakeries
in the cities of Irkutsk, Tashkent and
Leningrad.
Today, prices across the Soviet Union
double for milk; triple for beef, pork and
mutton and quadruple for rye bread.
Increases ranging from 250 percent to
1,000 percent were for such consumer
goods as television sets, refrigerators,
clothes, shoes and baby carriages.
A man's wool blend suit was to rise from
107 rubles to 245 rubles, nearly equal to the
average monthly salary of 270 rubles. A
color television will cost 1,218 rubles, up
from 755 rubles, and the price of a sofa will
nearly double to 346 rubles.
In the market, a kilogram (2.2 pounds)
of beef will rise from 2 rubles to 7 rubles;
cheese from 3.20 rubles to 6.40 rubles, and
the cost of 10 eggs will double to 2.60
rubles.
The price hikes were the government's
most decisive steps in 30 years to close the
gap between the low prices it charges con
sumers and rising production costs.
But the prevailing mood among Moscow
shoppers was that the economy would gain
little from the changes, nor would they ben
efit from the complex system of wage hikes
and other compensation that Soviet Presi
dent Mikhail Gorbachev ordered to ease

resulting tensions.
"It may help the economy — but it is
making our lives harder," said Lyubov
Biryukova, who is on maternity leave from
her job at a Moscow brewery. "All this com
pensation is not enough."
Most food stores and farmers' markets
in the Soviet capital were closed yesterday.
Employees said they expected to post new
prices on freshly delivered goods overnight.
The Communist Party newspaper
Pravda also published a presidential order
threatening to punish state-owned stores
that exceeded new centrally set prices.
Gorbachev faces trouble on other fronts:
—He and Prime Minister Valentin
Pavlov will meet tomorrow with striking
coal miners, who have been demanding that
both men resign.
—Soviets could be angered by a Gor
bachev decree Sunday charging them four
times more to exchange rubles for limited
amounts of foreign currency for travel
abroad.
— Russian Federation President Boris
Yeltsin backed off insisting that an extraor
dinary session of the Russian Congress of
People's Deputies pass a constitutional
amendment strengthening his job and
allowing direct popular elections to it.
Under a compromise forced by hard-line
Communists, Yeltsin suggested the
congress turn the issue over to the smaller
Supreme Soviet legislature. The congress
then would amend the constitution if
needed.
— Leaders of the reformist Moscow City
Council, who have advocated more sweep
ing economic changes than Gorbachev,
complained that he had taken away their
power by transferring control of local police
to the national government.
