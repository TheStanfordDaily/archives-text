## No heroes in this cast 
### 
Cheap gains and interest
politics add garishness
to indirect cost tragedy

The curtain has gone
down on the most climactic
act of the indirect costs
drama. And what a strange cast of
characters there has been.
There don't seem to be any good
guys in this production. Whether
it's the University administration
or Congress or the press, everyone
seems to be more concerned with
self-interest and self-preservation
than with a rapid and fair solution
to the controversy.
The hearing before the House
Subcommittee on Oversight and
Investigations had all the hoopla
and intellectual substance of a
three-ring circus. Congressmen
spent most of the day trying to
outdo each other at condemning
University President Donald
Kennedy, competing for sound
bites on the evening news.
The press has limited its cover
age to the "sexy" discoveries of
expenditures on the president's
mansion, failing to report that the
great majority of the claims Paul
Biddle has made against Stanford
— more than 95 percent of them,
in fact — remain unsubstantiated.
That fact also escaped the atten
tion of "20/20's" Bill Willson,
whose documentary exemplified
the maxim that you don't realize
how biased the media can be until
it covers something you know
about. The show did not bother to
explain even the most fundamental
issue of the debate: pooled costs.
During the 20-minute broadcast
the words "pooled costs" did not
cross correspondent Stone
Phillips' lips.
The press has also been slow to
report that several of the allega

tions made by Rep. John Dingell
and his subcommittee were
untrue. For example, it seems that
one $12,084 purchase Dingell "dis
covered" was actually only $1,248,
and that the government was
never billed for the purchase any
way.
Then there is Kennedy, who is
increasingly becoming the fall guy
for the whole debacle.
Whether or not his expenditures
at Hoover House conformed to the
letter of federal law, Kennedy is
having a hard time convincing peo
ple that life at the president's man
sion hasn't been characterized by a
decadence that rivals "The Last
Days of Pompeii."
Students and alumni have every
right to be upset. In a decade of
tuition increases and severe budget
cutbacks, it is disturbing to see the
administration lavishing money on
the president's house, on enlarging
his bed and on trips to Lake Tahoe
for the trustees and their friends.
But calling for Kennedy's resig
nation is premature. It is only too
easy to blame a single person for
what cooler heads concede is the
result of an arcane and confusing
system of cost-recovery rules
which results in questionable pro
cedures at many of the nation's
most reputable schools.
Kennedy's resignation would
solve nothing, and it would cost the
University the services of a well
liked president whose commitment
to undergraduate education and
success at raising money from
alumni have been the source of
praise.
However, the cost-recovery
problem needs to be dealt with
immediately. That means getting
the University's house in order.
Negative publicity is impeding
fund raising, and the University
will have to demonstrate quickly
that it has the situation under con
trol.
