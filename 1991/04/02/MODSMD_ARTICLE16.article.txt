Kennedy's letter is 'slick 9 rather than straightforward

DEAR MR. KENNEDY: Thank you
for your March 7 letter, which had
attached to it a copy of your
February 19 address to the Stanford
Alumni Association.
I regret that I am not only unper
suaded by your address, I am troubled by
its "slickness." It could have been writ
ten by President Nixon's Watergate
advisers or President Reagan's Iran-Con
tra advisers.
No one doubts any of the following:
• Stanford is a great university, which
does great scientific research,
• Accounting for and recovering for
indirect costs is legal and sensible,
• Mistakes sometimes occur in every
accounting and billing system, which, if
promptly admitted and corrected, are
normally — and should be — overlooked.
Likewise, almost everyone agrees that

the United States is a great nation, the
leaders of which must make many tough,
discretionary decisions, and sometimes
they err in their judgment when making
those decisions. Very few people hold
those errors against the leaders if they
are promptly admitted and corrected.
The problem with your speech — and
the aspect of it that I find "Nixonian" —
is twofold:
First, you imply, but don't say, that
Stanford's accounting errors are few and
innocent. Equating the book "Huckle
berry Finn" with expensive furnishings
for Hoover House, unless the govern
ment agreed to both, is inappropriate.
You say the government agreed to a
method of allocating library costs, but
you don't say the government agreed to
a method of allocating Hoover House
costs. You should either state all the rele

vant facts or not rely upon this compari
son.
Your statement about the yacht being
a "flat-out mistake" implies the mistake
was innocently made. But you don't say
whether it was or not.
By giving only a few examples, you
imply there were only a few; the govern
ment says Stanford owes many millions
of dollars for its faulty accounting prac
tices.
Second, you engage in an ad
hominem attack upon "a new resident
representative" — i.e., the government's
auditor. Such a tactic is a sure sign of a
weak case.
If Stanford's accounting practices
were clearly contrary to legal require
ments you should do one of two things:
• Resign, if you knew of and approved
the relevant decisions. Stanford is more

important than you are, just as the U.S.
presidency was more important than
Nixon.
• Fire the people who made the deci
sions if you didn't know and approve of
those decisions.
If the accounting decisions made by
Stanford were correct — or believed in
good faith to be correct when they were
made — fight like hell to support the
people who made those decisions. We
don't want a government to apply sec
ond-thought criteria either to aggrandize
itself or to intimidate the recipients of its
largess.
My problem with your speech is that
it follows neither course, leaving me with
the impression you are trying to hide or
avoid some unpleasant fact.
