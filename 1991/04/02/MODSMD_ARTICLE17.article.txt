# U.S. should aim for democracy, not property rights in Gulf

IMAGINE DRIVING THE ragged
remnant of Adolf Hitler's army back
into a bombed-out Germany, then
stopping at the border and saying,
"Hitler can still have the place if he can
kill enough people to keep control."
President Bush is a wimp. The Saudis
and the Egyptians wanted to take Bagh
dad; only the West balked. But that is
not the half of it.
Bush is an enemy of democracy. What
made this war worth fighting in the first
place is that it would inevitably lead to
democracy in Iraq. If only we (the
United States) would subtly help it
along, instead of opposing it.
A few weeks ago, the representatives
of all of the opposition forces inside Iraq
voted unanimously to turn Iraq over to
democratic institutions if they get the
chance. Even Saddam Hussein has been
promising democratic reform. It is not

the Arabs who think that Arabs don't
want democracy. It is Bush who does not
want democracy.
All along, Bush has been explicit in
his hope that the number-two man in
the Baath Party would kill Saddam and
leave the Baath power structure intact.
He thinks continued totalitarianism is
the only way to keep the country from
splintering.
What a sick, sick man.
Widespread division of power in the
country would be good. No group would
be able to lord it over the others and the
only alternative would be representative
government. The different parts of the
country might well want to form states,
with perhaps more power than our
states have, but there is no reason to
believe that these states would not want
a federal structure to deal with their
common concerns, especially if the inter-

totalitarianism is the only
way to keep the country

national community conditioned aid on
it.
The Democrats could have played an
important role in this conflict by using
their energy to make clear from the
beginning that the United States would
not fight a war like this without turning
the defeated country over to the will of
its people. Instead, they completely abdi
cated responsibility with their brainless
opposition to a morally imperative war.
Historically, the objectionable thing

about U.S. foreign policy is that our
interventions in the Third World have
almost always been to overthrow democ
racies or governments that were liberal
izing as soon as they started to threaten
U.S. business interests.
Instead of being against intervention
ism, the Democrats should have been
interventionist, and insisted that we
fight for democracy — not property
rights in the Persian Gulf. They could
have successfully insisted that we should
not fight a war like this without turning
the defeated country over to the will of
its people
No one's hands are clean. We all
—war supporters and protesters alike —
stand by, just like this president with the
90 percent approval rating, nodding at
the death throes of a people.
