## Bloodied bait for sharks 
### 
IF THERE WERE ANY DOUBTS
about the reelection chances of Rep.
John Dingell, they were answered
March 20. On that day, the Michigan
Democrat and his House Subcommittee
on Oversight and Investigations col
leagues took enough potshots at Stanford
to create their own Congressional sound
bite highlight reel.
Unfortunately for Stanford, the sub
committee hearing was not a long
awaited shot at redemption regarding the
indirect cost controversy. There was
really no chance for the University to
explain its side of the story. Political
grandstanding makes no room for a fair
hearing of the facts.
Instead, University President Donald
Kennedy could only serve as bloodied bait
for a team of congressional sharks hungry
to redeem the reputation of their institu
tion. Despite his extensive Washington,
D.C. experience as chief of the Food and
Drug Administration, Kennedy was
ripped to shreds.
In retrospect, perhaps Stanford should
not have offered such a tasty morsel for
the representatives to devour. But then
again, Stanford expected a legitimate
investigation of facts, not a media circus
staged for the sake of Gallup Poll points.
With the savings-and-loan debacle and
other embarrassing blemishes on
Congress' record this year, the hearing
was seized as an opportunity for congres
sional leaders to pretend they are clamp
ing down on government cost overruns
and a supposed corruption of the system.
How relieved these politicians must be
to read editorials roasting Kennedy,

rather than one of their own fat cats, on
the same skewer as Leona Helmsley. How
comforting it must be to see Kennedy's
face and Stanford's famed tower lam
pooned in political cartoons, instead of
agonizing over caricatures of their own
members with little pudgy fists stuck in
S&L cookie jars.
After all, any heat drawn by Stanford
cools the dust billowing in their own clos
ets.
The public and national media may be
fooled, but those who understand the
indirect cost controversy realize that
Stanford cannot and should not be the
lone scapegoat.
The problem does not rest principally
with Stanford or any other particular uni
versity. More directly, the problem lies
with government regulators who set
broadly and vaguely defined rules that
need to be elabprated by memoranda of
understanding between government
agencies-rtntf university- research groups
— a practice which investigators then
claim leaves too much room for interpre
tation and abuse.
The ex post facto approach currently
being used, where investigators claim
past agreements are improper and
invalid, should be replaced by an attempt
to clarify rules for future research
charges. Attempts to embarrass a presti
gious educational institution in front of a
confused public should be passed up in
favor of a valid effort to solve a national
problem.
Months of investigation have only
found a yacht here, some flowers there, a
wedding reception and some other

improper charges — several thousands of
dollars but nothing close to the $200 mil
lion alleged to have been overbilled to the
government. The investigation has
exposed some flaws in Stanford's
accounting system, but the findings do
not substantiate the unwarranted allega
tions of criminal misconduct thrown
around in recent weeks.
Several of the charges have also been
outrageously unfair, if not downright
false. While Dingell fired away at Stan
ford's "$12,084" lead urns and "$7,000"
sheets, a more careful investigation of the
facts revealed that the sheets cost only
$184.04 and the urns a mere one-tenth of
Dingell's stated sum.
~ The University's explanation that the
\jrjjs\vere not even included in Stanford's
indirect cost billing apparently made no
difference to congressional "investiga
tors." Apparently, Dingell and his posse
were more interested in putting on a tar
and-feathering revue for the voting public
rather than a hearing that uncovers the
truth.
Considering how long the investiga
tion has continued, the embarrassment it
has caused for Stanford and the hypocrisy
of the entire drama, it's time for investi
gators to put up or shut up.
