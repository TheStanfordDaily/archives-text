Student activism in social issues challenges 'ivory tower' image

Throughout the indirect
cost controversy, the media has
painted Stanford's president, its
faculty and its students as patrons of a
country club. The "20/20" piece high
lighted our lavish shopping center, tall
palm trees and made-to-order weather.
"That's just '20/20,'" I thought.
"They're out to get us."
True, the "20/20" segment was unfair,
as much of the press has been lately.
Most students here are not intellectual
snobs nor greedy careerists. We have
outgrown the "me" generation of the
1980s. Volunteerism is on the rise, and
so is social awareness and responsibility.
But the coverage has made me think
about why we at Stanford are perceived
negatively, why the government and the
media love to "stick it to us" — even
beyond the context of indirect cost.
Clearly, we haven't escaped the country
club image. Why?
Last quarter's debate about what is a
"student issue" underscored our ten
dency to think of Stanford as distinct

from (superior to? more comfortable
than?) the "real world." While we con
tinue the debate here, the public's per
ceptions and criticisms are that we Stan
ford students care about little beyond
our own campus, that we concern our
selves only with what is easiest, nearest,
most gratifying and most uncontrover
sial.
Some students, but not enough to
change our public image, have reached
beyond Campus Drive to work on the
social issues of our day — poverty, home
lessness, education, racism, environmen
tal degradation, health care — all of
which transcend Stanford and our imme
diate community.
Why the hesitation among students to
act on issues outside of Stanford? Don't
we do that already? Tutoring schoolchil
dren in East Palo Alto is not much dif
ferent from lobbying against cuts in
financial aid in Washington, D.C., or
advocating higher funding for kinder
garten through 12th grade in Sacra
mento — if you see the broader social,

political and economic fabric in which
resource allocations and public policy are
made.
No social conditions exist in isolation
in this nation. Without a link to the
broader determinants of injustice and
inequity, our local political action and
community service can be warped.
Recall the eager volunteer who, while
working in a soup kitchen one day, says
"Gee! What a great experience. I hope
my children have a chance to do this
some day ..."
In light of Governor Pete Wilson's
push to cut public school funding by $2
billion, around 100 Stanford students
will travel to Sacramento on Wednesday,
April 3 to express our concern about Cal
ifornia's budget deficit and the needs of
K-12 education.
In helping to organize the lobbying
effort, I have made dozens of calls to key
staff members and policy-makers in
Sacramento. They are surprised — and
heartily encouraged — that students

from an elite private institution care
enough about K-12 education to spend a
day in Sacramento.
Why do students care about California
public schools?
First, hundreds of Stanford students
are engaged in community service in
East Palo Alto and other neighboring
public schools. Through volunteer work,
students see firsthand the urgent need
for long-term funding strategies that will
ensure predictable, adequate funding for
California's schools and other social ser
vices.
Second, around one-third of Stanford
students come from California. Many of
us have siblings who are students and
parents who are educators — all of
whom would suffer from inadequate
school funding.
Third, California public schools edu
cate one-eighth of the nation's children.
The schools nurture thousands of would
be college students.

Fourth, education is the backbone of a
healthy economy and a strong, participa
tory democracy. It is a prevention strat
egy that, when adequately funded, can
spare taxpayer dollars for crime control,
corrections institutions, drug treatment
programs and public health care.
Never mind whether this is a "student
issue" or not. Do you care about
Ravenswood? Do you care about the next
generation of Stanford freshmen? Do
you care about one-eighth of the nation's
children?
Then come along with us to the state
capital!
Obviously, we are not going to Sacra
mento for the sake of transforming Stan
ford's image. But we should not merely
chuckle about our country-club status.
We should examine what that image tells
us about ourselves, what we care about
and what we are prepared and willing to
defend.

Never mind whether this is a "student
issue" or not. Do you care about
Ravenswood? Do you care about the next
generation of Stanford freshmen? Do
you care about one-eighth of the nation's
children?
Then come along with us to the state
capital!
Obviously, we are not going to Sacra
mento for the sake of transforming Stan
ford's image. But we should not merely
chuckle about our country-club status.
We should examine what that image tells
us about ourselves, what we care about
and what we are prepared and willing to
defend.
