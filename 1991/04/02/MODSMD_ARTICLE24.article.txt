Matadors 3 ,
Cardinal 2

The Cardinal's last Western
Intercollegiate Volleyball Associa
tion victory came exactly two
months ago, when they downed
Hawaii to lift their league record
to 4-0.
Last night they dropped their
10th straight WIVA match, falling
in a dramatic five-game match to
fourth-ranked Cal State-
Northridge at Matador Arena 15-
12, 4-15, 13-15, 15-13, 15-13.
The loss completed an 0-3
Southern California road trip for
the Cardinal, which had previ
ously snapped a seven-match
overall losing streak with a victory
over Ohio State. They lost a three
game match to third-ranked San
Diego State Friday, and fell to
12th-ranked Loyola Marymount
in five games last Wednesday.
Stanford will finish the year
with an 0-6 record on the road in

the southern half of the state,
having been swept in a three
match February swing as well.
Any Cardinal fan had to expect
the worst when the match
reached the rally-scored fifth
game, as Stanford has been win
less in four five-set league
matches this season. Even whop
ping statistical advantages in
their favor (11 more blocks, .362
versus .296 hitting percentage)
couldn't help the Cardinal break
the five-set jinx.
Stanford pounded out an
incredible .667 hitting percentage
to dominate the second game, and,
after escaping with a hard-fought
third-game victory, looked as if
they were going to grab their first
road win since early January. The
Matadors, however, rode the hit
ting of outside hitter Neil Coff
man (34 kills) and middle blocker
Coley Kyman (28) to their ninth
WIVA win.
The Matadors improved to 17-6
and 9-5 in league, and moved into
a virtual tie for the DeGroot Divi
sion lead with UCLA (8-4).The
Cardinal now stands 6-11 overall
and 4-10 in WTVA play.
Stanford's hopes to reach the
postseason WIVA tournament
have never before looked so grim.
The Cardinal dropped into fifth
place in the Wilson Division for
the first time this season. The top
three teams in each of the league's
two divisions, plus two wild cards
qualify.


Outside hitter Dave Goss dives after a ball for the Cardinal. Goss had 23 kills, seven digs and nine blocks last night by the Cardinal still fell
to Cai State-Northridge, 15-13 in the fifth game. Stanford's 0-5 record in five-game matches this season has made qualifying for the WIVA
Tournament a difficult proposition.
