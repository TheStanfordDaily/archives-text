# NIT isn't a Not Important Tourney
## 
### 
Nobody cares about the
NIT. Come on, haven't
you heard? Winning the
National Invitation Tourna
ment means nothing. It means
you're the world's strongest
wimp, or its tallest midget, or
its best mediocre basketball
team.
Oh, sorry, I forgot: Winning
the NIT does mean a little
something. The champions
each y«'flr get to take home the
Edwara A. Kelleher Memorial
Award, a silver cup that looks
just like that thing they give
the men's champion at Wim
bledon.

That and $6.50 gets you a
cup of coffee in New York.
Face it, it's worthless! The
tournament has no value what
soever and, of course, it should
be canceled. How do I know?
Well I, don't . . . but Mike
Francesa said so, so it's gotta
be true.
You've all seen Mike. He's
the CBS analyst/quasi-pudge
who sits with Pat O'Brien dur
ing basketball games and then,
during halftime, tells everyone
what's going on. (Now that's a
job. Why isn't there anything
like this listed at the CPPC?)
What I'm annoyed about
happened last week, after Stan
ford beat UMass 73-71 in the
semis of the NIT at Madison
Square Garden. Francesa was
at the game, and afterward, on
his radio show on WFAN, he
said the NIT was a joke.
Nobody cared, he said; it
was obvious, because no one
showed up at the Garden to
watch. The announced atten
dance was something like
8,500, which would have been
close if they'd been counting
fans, writers, bands, ushers
and the 6,000 rats running
around.
So, Francesa said, since the
people of New York don't care
enough to watch the NIT, it
should (obviously!) be can
celled. It makes perfect sense:
New York is the center of the
universe (the people are really
friendly, too!), and anything
that isn't popular there should
clearly be eliminated.
Nobody cares. I wonder
what Francesa was
doing the week before
the finals. He probably wasn't
hanging out in Madison, Wis.,
waiting for the second-round
game between Stanford and
Wisconsin.
If he had been there, he
probably would have asked the
hundreds of students lining up

outside the gym two hours
before the game why they were
there. "Come on!" Mike would
say in his splendid NewYork
ese. "It's the NIT! Who gives a
f---?"
Actually, it's probably a good
thing he wasn't there. He
would've been confused by
everyone standing out in the
cold. He would've been fright
ened when the gates opened
and all the students ran like
crazv to get to their seats. He
probably would've been
amazed that Wisconsin's 150-
member band bothered to
show up and play their guts out
for two deafening hours.
And he probably wouldn't
have believed that 11,309 roar
ing Cheeseheads actually cared
enough to come watch their
ti>am play in the postseason for
only the fourth time in 90
years; that they cared enough
to make more noise than I'd
ever heard before when the
Badgers were losing 26-9; that
they kept screaming like mad
even though their team never
got closer than eight points
down.
Nobody.
Certainly not the folks of
Carbondale, 111. Not a bit. Well,
except for the town's store
owners, almost every one of
whom put a sign in the window
wishing good luck to the
Salukis (it's an Egyptian dog —
don't ask). And except for the
local radio station, which wrote
a country song for the occasion,
for Pete's sake, and played it
over and over the day of the
game:
Hello Stanford! We'd like to
welcome you.
Goodbye Cardinal! Ya came
a long long way to lose. . . .
You get the idea.
No, the NIT just wasn't
news at all in Carbondale,
except maybe to the 9,000 folks
who packed and rocked the
Arena that night; except to one
small section of students who
abused players and refs ad
infinitum; and except for one
fan who spent the entire game
running up and down the
aisles, screaming at everyone
to get louder and occasionally
calling a certain mild-man
nered sportswriter (who was
foolishly wearing a Stanford
basketball shirt) a name I don't
think I'd be allowed to print.
(Well. . . nah.)
But hey, what do people in
Carbondale know?
Francesa made one point
that's valid: Nobody in
New York really cares
about the NIT, unless Fordham
or St. John's or someone from
the area is playing. When three
of the final four are from west
of the Mississippi, forget it. But
does no one care?
Andrew Vlahov probably
cared. After all, when you're
forced to sit on the sidelines for


Cameron
Macky
two months you really don't care
what tournament you're in, as
long as you just get to play.
Deshon Wingate probably
cared, because he played one of
the best games of his life — 13
points, 13 boards and unbeliev
able defense — in the finals.
Adam Keefe, Marcus Lollie,
John Patrick, Kenny Ammann
and the rest of the team probably
cared. In fact, the team cared so
much that it played its best bas
ketball of the entire year during a
supposedly meaningless tourna
ment.
And, after it was all done —

after everyone stayed up all night
celebrating the meaningless title,
after everyone toasted an obvi
ously worthless victory, and after
flying home — several hundred
completely disinterested Stanford
fans were waiting for the team to
come home.
And, as the bus pulled up to
Maples, as the players smiled out
the windows at the huge mob, all
those fans — who, of course,
really didn't care about the NIT
— cheered . . . and cheered some
more . . . and cheered some more.
I wondeT what Francesn would
have thought.

Cameron Macky has had the dis
tinct privilege of being The
Daily's men's basketball writer.
