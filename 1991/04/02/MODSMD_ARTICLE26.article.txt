### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Going into this season, the Stanford
wrestling team had high expectations. They
had two wrestlers who were thinking about
earning All-America honors and coach Chris
Horpel was talking about a top-20 finish.
But, as often happens in the world of
sports, things didn't quite work out. Seniors
Steve Buddie and Steve Yarbrough placed in
the top 12 at the NCAA Championships at
lowa over break, but each came up one match
short of attaining All-America honors.
Additionally junior Matt Topham, Stan
ford's other NCAA qualifier, lost a narrow
decision in the first round to the tournament's
11th seed. So Stanford ended up just a couple
of breaks away from attaining its goals in set
tling for a 31st-place finish in the 100-plus

team field.
"This was a year when we had two real
stars," Horpel said. "I expected more than
what happened so I was a little disappointed.
But it's the nature of our sport, more so than
almost any other, that you have to prove it
each time or your season is over. "
Buddie, at 167 pounds, and Yarbrough, at
177, came into NCAAs after winning their
respective classes at the Pacific 10 Conference.
Yarbrough was seeded fifth and Buddie sixth
at lowa.
But after advancing into the final 12, both
lost in an effort to reach the final eight, and
grab All-America honors. "They wrestled well
but they wrestled a little better at the Pac-10
Championships," Horpel said. "There they
were wrestling at home and they wrestled
their best, whereas at the NCAA Champi
onships there were more distractions.

"They were seeded to make the top six and
earn All-America status and I think it was the
first time they had been in that situation
where they were supposed to win. I looked
back and I think this was only the second time
we've had people go to this who are supposed
to be All-Americans. I think they weren't
quite at their best — they were close, but it's
those little things that make the difference."
Topham, a junior, earned his trip to lowa by
placing second in the 158-pound class at Pac
10s. "I felt that Topham was a little over
whelmed by the whole thing since this was his
first time qualified, but on the other hand he
wrestled pretty well," Horpel said. "He lost 2-
1 and was in the process of completing a take
down when time ran out.
"I'm really encouraged and he's really
encouraged to see what he can do next year."
