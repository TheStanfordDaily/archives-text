# Baseball opens quarter against USF
## 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
It would be nice if history
always repeated itself.
Last year the Stanford baseball
team won two out of three games
at the Oscar Mayer Baseball Clas
sic, ending the weekend with a
loss in the championship game.
This year's squad also won two
out of three, its only loss coming
against Minnesota for the champi
onship. Last year's team
rebounded from the loss by win
ning 15 games in a row. This year
. . . well, its anyone's guess.
The Cardinal nine begin spring
quarter on the field today at the
University of San Francisco with
the hope of repeating some of the
success that the team enjoyed this
time last year. Ranked No. 6 by
Baseball America and No. 9 in the
ESPN/Collegiate Baseball, it
would appear that 19-9 Stanford
would have little trouble starting
a win streak against the 6-23
Dons, but as the team learned in
its loss to Division II UC-Davis
last week, looks can be deceiving.
"This year has shown that we
can get beat by anybody on any
given day," Stanford coach Mark
Marquess said. "(USF) has beaten
some good teams, and they play
real well up there."
They probably could not play
any worse than they did down
here. These two teams met once
before, a 10-0 shell-shocking at
Sunken Diamond that saw soph
more Tim Moore pick up his first
win of the season. But that victory
was in February, a month that
Stanford ended 16-3, earning
themselves the No 1 ranking in
both national polls. March was
not so kind. The month started off
with a win over Arizona, but since
then the team has gone 2-6, slow
ing making its way towards the
wrong end of the polls.
"We haven't been playing well

in any of the stages of the game,"
Marquess said. "We haven't hit
well, we haven't pitched well. This
game goes in stages â€” we played
well in the begining of the year,
and now we are not."
The two wins this past week
end in Minnesota ended a five
game losing streak, and though
the team lost on Sunday, there
were many reasons to happy with

their spring break. The biggest
was Ryan Turner's return to
form. Marred all season with hit
ting problems, Turner burst out
of his slump by going 10 for 18
with two home runs, three dou
bles, eight RBI and five runs
scored. The effort raised the
senior's average 60 points to .309,
and according to Turner was due
to a little adjustment with his

patience.
"I hadn't been waiting on the
ball," Turner said. "I was catching
the ball out front too much, and
this was causing me to hit a lot of
grounders. It was just a matter of
controling my left shoulder so I
didn't dive through the ball."
Marquess makes no bones
