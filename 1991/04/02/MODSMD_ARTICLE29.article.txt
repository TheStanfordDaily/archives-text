# Men's netters host Northwestern
## 
### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
After coming off its second
toughest road trip of the season
last weekend and heading into its
toughest this weekend, the Stan
ford men's tennis team conceiv
ably could have a letdown this
afternoon against Northwestern
at Stanford Tennis Stadium.
Coach Dick Gould is trying to
make sure that doesn't happen.
"We had some good competitive
efforts (in wins over Arizona and
Arizona State last weekend).
We're going to try to sustain that
competitive concentration,"
Gould said. "We can't afford to be
careless."
Despite Gould's warning, Stan
ford will face a Northwestern
team that is much weaker than
last year's squad which finished

the season ranked No. 17 in the
Volvo Tennis/Collegiate Rankings.
Northwestern lost four of its top
six players, including Todd Mar
tin, who was ranked No. 1 in the
nation most of the season.
But as Asst. Coach John
Whitlinger said, "We can't look
past Northwestern (to UCLA and
USC this weekend). We have to
play [today] as well."
Sophomore Jared Palmer, who
has played No. 2 for the Cardinal,

will not play today because of a
sore shoulder. "It's nothing seri
ous," Gould said. "We want to rest
him for this weekend."
Jonathan Stark, who has been
injured most of the season, will
play singles today and probably
will play singles in at least one of
the matches this weekend on the
Los Angeles road trip.
UCLA, Stanford's opponent
Friday, has replaced the Cardinal
atop the Volvo Tennis/Collegiate

Team Rankings. USC, Stanford s
opponent Saturday, sits second in
the rankings. Stanford is ranked
third. USC beat a Stark-less Stan
ford in the semifinals of the
National Team Indoors earlier
this season but was eliminated by
UCLA in the finals.
"Today's match (against
Northwestern) is a good interim
match. We want to keep these
guys focused. We want to make
sure they stay sharp," Gould said.
