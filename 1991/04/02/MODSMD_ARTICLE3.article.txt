# Rabbi challenges traditions

Rabbi Einat Ramon is a pio
neer. Just as her Israeli prede
cessors worked the soil and cre
ated a haven for the Jewish peo
ple, Ramon — the first Israeli
female rabbi — is now tilling the
fields of Jewish thought.
As a rabbi, she hopes to
excite the spirituality of her peo
ple. As a feminist, she wants to
challenge old ideas about the
role of women in Judaism and in
Israeli society. As a leader with
innovative ideas, she strives to
"create something that was not

broad perspective on Israeli
Judaism.
"Israel needs a much more
revolutionary approach toward
religion. We need to have non-
Orthodox religion in Israel so
that secular Jews will be able to
define their own Judaism,"
Ramon says.

Hebrew University in Jeru

faith conference that she says
literally changed her life. When
she met a woman who was
studying to be a minister, an
epiphany occurred, she says.
She made the decision to be a
rabbi.
Through this profession,
Ramon says she hopes to realize
her goal of defining a new aspect
of Judaism.

Ramon's path to becoming a
rabbi in 1989 was bumpy and
intricate.
She said that ironically, the

Israeli Reform and Conserva
tive movements of Judaism —
although they were pushing for
progress and change from the
Orthodox tradition — told her,
"Israel [is] not ready to have
female rabbis yet."

Ramon did not abandon her
goal. Since the U.S. Conserva

women for rabbinical school,
Ramon moved to the United
