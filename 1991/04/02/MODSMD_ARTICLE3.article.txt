# Rabbi challenges traditions
## 
### Julie Cantor 
Rabbi Einat Ramon is a pio
neer. Just as her Israeli prede
cessors worked the soil and cre
ated a haven for the Jewish peo
ple, Ramon — the first Israeli
female rabbi — is now tilling the
fields of Jewish thought.
As a rabbi, she hopes to
excite the spirituality of her peo
ple. As a feminist, she wants to
challenge old ideas about the
role of women in Judaism and in
Israeli society. As a leader with
innovative ideas, she strives to
"create something that was not
there before."
A Stanford graduate student
in religious studies, Ramon
say 8, "I see myself between two
worlds — between American
Jewish culture and Israeli secu
lar culture. . . . I'm trying to
combine these experiences."
Delving into the field of reli
gious thought, Ramon's ulti
mate goal is to formulate a new,
broad perspective on Israeli
Judaism.
"Israel needs a much more
revolutionary approach toward
religion. We need to have non-
Orthodox religion in Israel so
that secular Jews will be able to
define their own Judaism,"
Ramon says.
While studying at the
Hebrew University in Jeru
salem, she attended an inter
faith conference that she says
literally changed her life. When
she met a woman who was
studying to be a minister, an
epiphany occurred, she says.
She made the decision to be a
rabbi.
Through this profession,
Ramon says she hopes to realize
her goal of defining a new aspect
of Judaism.
Road to ordination
Ramon's path to becoming a
rabbi in 1989 was bumpy and
intricate.
She said that ironically, the

Israeli Reform and Conserva
tive movements of Judaism —
although they were pushing for
progress and change from the
Orthodox tradition — told her,
"Israel [is] not ready to have
female rabbis yet."

Ramon did not abandon her
goal. Since the U.S. Conserva
tive movement readily accepts
women for rabbinical school,
Ramon moved to the United

States.
Last year at UC-Berkeley,
Ramon served as the rabbi in res
idence at Hillel, a campus Jewish
student organization. Currently,
she is beginning her doctoral the
sis in modern Jewish thought,
and she is also teaching an inten
sive course about Judaism for
people in the community.
Through that class, Ramon
hopes to give people "a fuller pic
ture of what Judaism is. It focuses
on culture, ethics, theological
issues and traditions."
Although she says she wants to
"gain experience" as a rabbi and
as a teacher in America, this
Israeli hopes to return to her
homeland with her husband, a
Reform rabbi, in the future.
Living in America has given
Ramon a new perspective about

living as a minority. In Israel, she
explains, everyone celebrates the
Jewish holidays. Here, however,
many people are unaware of
them.
She has been exposed to a vari
ety of cultural ideas in the United
States. Ramon says she realizes
that "living as a minority, you
really see the variety of cultures"
that exist — cultures she did not
recognize when she lived as a
member of the majority in Israel.
Ramon says she wants to help
Israeli Jews find an identity. She
adds that she sees people "gradu
ally becoming more detached,
more confused" about spiritual
life today.
In Israel, she wants to divide
her time between rabbinical work
and academia. She said she envi
sions herself working with people
and leading services, but she also
would like to write and interpret
Jewish texts.

Ramon's experiences during
her adolescence in Israel, as well
as the life circumstances of her
predecessors, served as the cata
lyst for her rabbinical passion.
Bombarded with anti-Semitism
and hatred, Ramon's great-grand
parents were disillusioned with
human nature and dissatisfied
with religion, she says.
For solace, they followed the
Zionist movement to Palestine.
People involved in the movement
began to create a safe haven for
Jews as they reacted to the big
otry they faced in their past.
Ramon's grandparents continued
to work toward the creation of
Israel in 1948.
The Zionist movement her par
ents followed movement also
included the ideas of socialism.
Her parents were dedicated to
incorporating Zionist socialism
into the Jewish homeland.
Although the progress of
Ramon's parents' generation was
tremendous in helping to ensure

the existence of Israel, Ramon
says she adamantly feels her par
ents became myopic in their
vision and isolated themselves
from the outside world.
"My generation was brought
up into a confused reality," she
explains with a veiled Israeli
accent. Ramon recalls that
because she was raised in the
socialist youth movement, she
was expected to teach other
Israeli students about the Israeli
living environment called the kib
butz.
These living groups are social
ist in nature, and they strive for
equality in their community. Yet
she says she felt that "it was
anachronistic" to teach about
these ideals because she saw
inequalities within the commu
nity.
"Women were still in the
kitchen," she says. But when peo
ple on the kibbutz pushed for
equality, she saw hypocrisy.

Rabbi Einat Ramon is a pio
neer. Just as her Israeli prede
cessors worked the soil and cre
ated a haven for the Jewish peo
ple, Ramon — the first Israeli
female rabbi — is now tilling the
fields of Jewish thought.
As a rabbi, she hopes to
excite the spirituality of her peo
ple. As a feminist, she wants to
challenge old ideas about the
role of women in Judaism and in
Israeli society. As a leader with
innovative ideas, she strives to
"create something that was not
there before."
A Stanford graduate student
in religious studies, Ramon
say 8, "I see myself between two
worlds — between American
Jewish culture and Israeli secu
lar culture. . . . I'm trying to
combine these experiences."
Delving into the field of reli
gious thought, Ramon's ulti
mate goal is to formulate a new,
broad perspective on Israeli
Judaism.
"Israel needs a much more
revolutionary approach toward
religion. We need to have non-
Orthodox religion in Israel so
that secular Jews will be able to
define their own Judaism,"
Ramon says.
While studying at the
Hebrew University in Jeru
salem, she attended an inter
faith conference that she says
literally changed her life. When
she met a woman who was
studying to be a minister, an
epiphany occurred, she says.
She made the decision to be a
rabbi.
Through this profession,
Ramon says she hopes to realize
her goal of defining a new aspect
of Judaism.
Road to ordination
Ramon's path to becoming a
rabbi in 1989 was bumpy and
intricate.
She said that ironically, the

Israeli Reform and Conserva
tive movements of Judaism —
although they were pushing for
progress and change from the
Orthodox tradition — told her,
"Israel [is] not ready to have
female rabbis yet."

Ramon did not abandon her
goal. Since the U.S. Conserva
tive movement readily accepts
women for rabbinical school,
Ramon moved to the United

States.
Last year at UC-Berkeley,
Ramon served as the rabbi in res
idence at Hillel, a campus Jewish
student organization. Currently,
she is beginning her doctoral the
sis in modern Jewish thought,
and she is also teaching an inten
sive course about Judaism for
people in the community.
Through that class, Ramon
hopes to give people "a fuller pic
ture of what Judaism is. It focuses
on culture, ethics, theological
issues and traditions."
Although she says she wants to
"gain experience" as a rabbi and
as a teacher in America, this
Israeli hopes to return to her
homeland with her husband, a
Reform rabbi, in the future.
Living in America has given
Ramon a new perspective about

living as a minority. In Israel, she
explains, everyone celebrates the
Jewish holidays. Here, however,
many people are unaware of
them.
She has been exposed to a vari
ety of cultural ideas in the United
States. Ramon says she realizes
that "living as a minority, you
really see the variety of cultures"
that exist — cultures she did not
recognize when she lived as a
member of the majority in Israel.
Ramon says she wants to help
Israeli Jews find an identity. She
adds that she sees people "gradu
ally becoming more detached,
more confused" about spiritual
life today.
In Israel, she wants to divide
her time between rabbinical work
and academia. She said she envi
sions herself working with people
and leading services, but she also
would like to write and interpret
Jewish texts.

Ramon's experiences during
her adolescence in Israel, as well
as the life circumstances of her
predecessors, served as the cata
lyst for her rabbinical passion.
Bombarded with anti-Semitism
and hatred, Ramon's great-grand
parents were disillusioned with
human nature and dissatisfied
with religion, she says.
For solace, they followed the
Zionist movement to Palestine.
People involved in the movement
began to create a safe haven for
Jews as they reacted to the big
otry they faced in their past.
Ramon's grandparents continued
to work toward the creation of
Israel in 1948.
The Zionist movement her par
ents followed movement also
included the ideas of socialism.
Her parents were dedicated to
incorporating Zionist socialism
into the Jewish homeland.
Although the progress of
Ramon's parents' generation was
tremendous in helping to ensure

the existence of Israel, Ramon
says she adamantly feels her par
ents became myopic in their
vision and isolated themselves
from the outside world.
"My generation was brought
up into a confused reality," she
explains with a veiled Israeli
accent. Ramon recalls that
because she was raised in the
socialist youth movement, she
was expected to teach other
Israeli students about the Israeli
living environment called the kib
butz.
These living groups are social
ist in nature, and they strive for
equality in their community. Yet
she says she felt that "it was
anachronistic" to teach about
these ideals because she saw
inequalities within the commu
nity.
"Women were still in the
kitchen," she says. But when peo
ple on the kibbutz pushed for
equality, she saw hypocrisy.
