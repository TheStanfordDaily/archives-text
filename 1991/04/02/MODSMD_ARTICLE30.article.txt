# Tennis vs. Northwestern
## 
### 
TODAY — 1:30 p.m. at Stanford
Tennis Stadium.
RECORD — Stanford (11-1,
ranked third by the Volvo Ten
nis/Collegiate Rankings).
NOTES — Today's match repre
sents the first chance most of
the campus will have to watch
Stanford superstar Jonathan
Stark play singles. Stark was
ranked No. 1 in both singles
and doubles coming into the
season but has been sidelined
with a foot injury. If you have
not seen Stark compete, you are
missing one of the great serve
and-volley players in the game
of tennis today. His blend of
power and touch is unmatched
in college tennis. As coach Dick
Gould said, "He will make his
mark in the tennis world upon
leaving Stanford."
