# Duke tops Kansas

INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -
Finally, Duke's destiny is not
disappointment.
Finally, Mike Krzyzewski
doesn't have to answer any
more questions about winning
the big one.
Finally, the Duke Blue Dev
ils are NCAA champions.
The Blue Devils ended six
years of frustration with a 72-
65 victory over Kansas Monday
night, their first national title
in five championship-game
appearances and nine Final
Four trips.
When the game ended,
Duke's Brian Davis faced his
cheering fans with a sign that
summed it all up: "UNLV
DYNASTY" was crossed out
and written below was "DUKE
DESTINY."
The scoring and rebounding
of Christian Laettner and the
passing and court smarts of
Bobby Hurley gave Duke the
victory one year after a 30-
point loss to UNLV in the
championship game.
It also capped a run of five

Final Four appearances since
1986, including the last four
years. No school had been to
the Final Four as many times
as Duke without taking home a
title.
"We are much more mature
than the previous teams that
have come here," Krzyzewski
said. "We've won a lot of games
in March. It feels good to win
one in April."
Now that yoke has to be
borne by Houston with five.
Coach K finally has that final
net as a souvenir.
"I'm not sure if anyone
played harder for 80 minutes to
win a national title,"
Krzyzewski said. "Our two
keys guys throughout the year
— Christian and Bobby —
came through again tonight."
"As much as it was failure
for us doing what we wanted to
do," Kansas coach Roy
Williams said, "it was Duke
doing all things they needed to
do to win. They had an answer
for everything we did."
