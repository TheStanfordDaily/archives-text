# Crew opens season
##

Last week while many Stanford
students basked in the sunshine
of various tropical hotspots, the
men's and women's crew teams
faced the Palo Alto rain and a long
week of workouts and races.
Immediately after final exams,
the Cardinal headed up to Sacra
mento. Braving 37-degree
weather and a sideways rain
storm, Stanford handily swept all
the men's and women's races.
According to men's coach Wies
law Kujda, the Cardinal was suc
cessful because they were "still
fresh" â€” their Hell Week had not
begun yet.
After a week of two-a-days, the
exhausted rowers battled a tough
UC-Santa Barbara team at Red
wood Shores last Saturday.
Despite their fatigue, the Cardinal
women walked away undefeated
and the men finished the day 2-3.
Kujda seemed happy with the
men's performances though, not
ing that by the end of the week tbe
men were so tired that "they had
problems even walking."
The strenuous practice ses
sions affected the women as well.
"We were happy to just get away
with a win considering how good

they were," said women's coach
John Davis. "Santa Barbara is
much better this year."
The varsity women rowed hard
but they were a bit out of control,
according to Davis. Toward the
end, UCSB threatened to pull out
in front, but it was Stanford
which crossed the line first.
Clear weather made a huge dif
ference for the rowers last Satur
day. The varsity women rowed
eight-and-a-half seconds faster
against Santa Barbara than they
had against Oregon State.
Both of these races proved to be
good practice for the women.
"Santa Barbara and Oregon State
are decent but not heavyweights,"
said Davis.
The Cardinal lost several tough
competitors last year but seems to
have some strong underclassmen
moving up in the ranks. "We have
a strong sophomore class," said
Davis. "This season could go
either way."
The men also used last week's
races as experience-builders. "We
basically tried to scrimmage with
fWjdAV WhTT kyouHg
team, these smaller races provide
crucial race experience.
"We just want to gain speed
from week to week," said Kujda.
