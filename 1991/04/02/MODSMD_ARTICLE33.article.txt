# Sophomores win research scholarships
## 
### June Mølgaard Editorial staff 
Three sophomores are doing
what some would consider a
dream — performing doctoral
level research years ahead of their
peers.
Julie Appiah is studying the
recent political history of Ghana,
Zoran Cn\ja is investigating the
prospects for the convertibility of
East European currencies and
Siddhartha Mukherjee is explor
ing the emergence of new post
colonial literatures.
As this year's winners of the
Chappell-Lougee awards, these
three students were given scholar
ships of up to $2,500 and can now,
with faculty support, pursue in
depth research on topics of per
sonal intellectual interest.
The Chappell-Lougee awards
were established in 1987 in mem
ory of Harold Chappell and in
honor of his daughter, History
Prof. Carolyn Lougee, former
dean of Undergraduate Studies

and currently an associate dean of
Humanities and Sciences.
Undergraduate Research
Opportunities, which administers
the scholarships, has requested
freshman advisers to act as "tal
ent scouts" for potential candi
dates, but freshmen and sopho
mores studying in Humanities
and Sciences can also apply for the
award themselves or be nomi
nated by faculty.
"Setting up an undergraduate
research program was our num
ber one priority — and getting
students involved as early as pos
sible," said Lougee.
And that is clearly what this
year's Chappell-Lougee award
winners were looking for.
Mukheijee, who came to Stan
ford from New Delhi, India, has
long been interested in the issues
confronting the post-colonial,
multilingual writer. His Fresh
man English paper, addressing
the emergence of a new body of lit
erature and its effects on history,
won the Boothe Prize, and he was

encouraged to pursue the topic
further.
"The post-colonial writer
defines a space for himself, from
which he begins to write. I want to
explore this space," Mukherjee
said.
Working with Akhil Gupta,
assistant professor of anthropol
ogy, and Shankar Raman, a gradu
ate student in English, his studies
have taken a tutorial structure.
Equipped with a reading list of
primary texts, biographies, mem
oirs and texts on post-colonial the
ory, his project will last for three
quarters and will culminate in a
final research paper.
Appiah, who is half Ghanaian
and feels that classes offered on
African-American history are
often too broad, decided to do her
own research on her people.
"Most African-Americans don't
know about their own past and
origins. I'm lucky — I know I am
half Ghanaian. In this way I will
be able to learn more about the
history of where my people come

from."
She hopes to use the award
money to attend a conference on
African history in St. Louis in
November. Appiah, who has never
been outside the United States, is
also considering eventually con
tinuing her research in Ghana.
Crrya, who is Yugoslavian, has
a particular interest in mathemat
ics and economics. Troubled by
the economic future of Eastern
European countries, he intends to
examine the prospects for the con
vertibility of their currencies.
Using Yugoslavia and its cur
rency, the dinar, as an example,
Crnja will study the specific cir
cumstances confronting East
European economies after many
years of command control.
Facing problems such as infla
tion and an overvalued currency,
Yugoslavian banks have run out of
foreign reserves. "They won't get
out of the economic set-up so
quickly," Crnja predicts.
