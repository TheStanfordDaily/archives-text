# Career adviser dies at 40
## 
### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Staff writer 
James Patterson, a counselor at the
Career Planning and Placement Center
and a highly respected mentor and campus
organizer, died of AIDS March 25 at a Red
wood City hospital. He was 40.
Patterson, an assistant director for engi
neering and science counseling and pro
grams, joined the CPPC in 1983. During
his years there he garnered the respect of
students and staff for his friendliness, com
mitment to excellence and genuine interest
in people.
"James was much more than a staff
member," recalled A 1 Levin, assistant direc
tor for counseling resources at the CPPC.
"He interacted with so many people that
the entire Stanford community was his
workplace."
Patterson was active in campus organi
zations and served as an adviser for the
Stanford chapter of Omega Psi Phi, an
African-American fraternity. He recently
received an award for being an outstanding
adviser to the fraternity.
He was also instrumental in the estab
lishment of a group bringing together black
male administrators and staff.
In addition to his involvement at Stan
ford, Patterson was a member of several
Bay Area civic groups and wrote many pub
lications on career planning and minority
issues in education.
Born in Brooklyn, N.Y. in 1951, Patter
son was raised in Maryland and went on to
receive his bachelor's degree from Coppin
State College in Baltimore in 1974. In 1975
he received a master's from the University
of Michigan and in 1984 earned a doctorate
there.
Friends and colleagues at Stanford
expressed sadness over news of Patterson's

death. They described him |
as an unselfish person who 1
was always willing to
extend a helping hand to
others.
Assoc. Dean of Student
Affairs Michael Jackson
said Patterson sought to
foster a positive campus
community â€” something
he achieved through his

dedication to students and campus organi
zations.
"James was a sterling example of a per
son who served as a mentor and friend to
Stanford students, faculty and staff," Jack
son said. "He brought joy and lighthearted
ness to the community and to people with
whom he came into contact."
"I'm going to miss him a great deal. He
was a good friend, and it will be a big loss.
He was larger than life," Jackson added.
Rik Robinson, a fifth-year senior who
received occupational advice from Patter
son, described him as a valuable resource
for himself and other students, particularly
those who are black.
"If you ever had something to talk
about, he was there for you. He went above
and beyond the role of an adviser. ... He
was a friend," Robinson said, adding that
he appreciated Patterson's help, concern
and understanding.
Jackson said Patterson "left a legacy of
compassion and friendship and walked that
extra mile to help others. We need to live up
to that legacy and strive to build and bring
together the African-American community
and the Stanford community."
Patterson is survived by his mother,
Emma Patterson; four brothers, Harry Jr.,
Lenwood, Robin and Winter; and three sis
ters, Odette Compton, Spring Ferguson
and Emma Crosby.
