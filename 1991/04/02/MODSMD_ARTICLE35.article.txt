Stanford graduate becomes
Israeli military chief
Stanford graduate Ehud Barak
became Israel's new military chief of
staff yesterday.
Barak received a master's degree in
engineering-economic systems and a
doctorate in systems analysis from
Stanford.
According to Bruno Wassertheil,
president of Dateline Jerusalem — a
Palo Alto organization that provides
news from Israel — Barak was pro
moted to Lieutenant General when he
was appointed to the new post yester
day morning.
Barak, 49, has been the deputy
chief of staff for the last four years. He
succeeds Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron.
Barak wanted to be a fighter pilot,
but failed the vision test and joined the
paratroopers. He fought in the 1967
Six-Day War and the 1973 Yom Kippur
War. During the 1980s, Barak served
as intelligence chief.
He has been awarded the nation's
highest military medal and four other
citations, making him the most deco
rated soldier in the Israel Defense
Force.
Barak's Stanford degrees make him
one of Israel's most extensively edu
cated generals.

New director appointed
for Stanford News Serv ice
Terry Shepard, currently director of
the news bureau and deputy associate
chancellor for public affairs at the

University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champiagn, has been named director
of the Stanford News Service, effective
April 15.
"I'm pleased and looking forward to
it," said Shepard, who was appointed
last month. Stanford "is the best uni
versity in the nation with the best
news service in the nation, and so I'll
have the best job in the nation," he
said.
Shepard brings with him a lengthy
list of credentials, including a bache
lor's and master's degrees in journal
ism from the University of Illinois.
Shepard began his journalism career
at the Milwaukee Journal, serving as a
reporter and editor before moving to
the foreign desk of the Los Angeles
Times in 1981. He later became the
Times' Sunday news editor.
In addition to overseeing the
department, Shepard will personally
cover the faculty senate, said News
Service staff member Mary Ann Sea
well. "We're delighted to have him and
think he'll be excellent for the job,"
she said.
Shepard will take over from acting
director Kathleen O'Toole, who was
filling in for the previous acting direc
tor, Eileen Walsh.
Walsh, currently on maternity
leave, replaced Robert Beyers, who
retired last year after 28 years of ser
vice.
"I hope to maintain a tradition of
openness and candor at Stanford, but
let the community, nation and world
know more about the work, teaching
and research being done" here, Shep
ard said.

Campus publication seeks
to promote debate
Last year, graduate student Ravi
Chandra felt a need to promote differ
ing opinions and debate on campus.
The first issue of Envision magazine,
published last month, is a step toward
fulfilling his goal.
Chandra, who founded the new
magazine, said he wants "to fill a vac
uum in campus dialogue to balance
views and promote debate."
He added that the main campus
publications — The Daily and The
Stanford Review — are "reactionary."
He said he and other Envision coordi
nators want to promote new views
rather than react to events, he added.
In the first issue, which came out
March 7, Envision included articles on
financial aid, gospel music, prenatal
care and the diversification of faculty.
There was also a review of a play.
Editor Valerie Mih said Envision
has something for everyone. "We try
and focus on diversity."
Chris Sullivan, who contributed to
the publication, said he likes the idea
of an alternative paper that is "more
receptive to a variety of perspectives."
Both Mih and Chandra say they are
optimistic about Envision's future but
admit that its success depends on the
interest it generates on campus. "We
want this to be a paper where a lot of
people are involved," Mih said.
Envision is financed by advertise
ments and funds from the ASSU Pub
lications Board. The next issue is
planned for later this quarter.
