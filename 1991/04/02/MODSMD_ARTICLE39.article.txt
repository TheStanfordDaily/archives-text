# Mills president hopes for Stanford links
## She wants to increase dialogue, but no plans have been laid 
### June Cohen Editorial staff 
The new president of Mills College,
Janet McKay, hopes to expand the rela
tionship between the all-women's school
and Stanford, but University adminis
trators are still in the dark about her
plans.
McKay, who was appointed president
of the Oakland school last month, said
she wants to increase academic opportu
nities and stimulate intellectual dia
logue between Mills and nearby univer
sities such as Stanford and UC-Berke
ley.
However, McKay, who is currently
vice provost of Princeton University, has
not yet detailed any specific plans to
Stanford administrators.
McKay said one of her goals is to
encourage interschool dialogue and
exchange geared toward designing a
university curriculum that adequately
covers women's issues.
She pointed to the "spectacular"
achievements — a $3 million program
— of the University of Maryland as an
example of way for a school to success
fully revise its curriculum to include
feminist viewpoints. She suggested the
possibility of Mills working on such cur
riculum revisions with UC-Berkeley and

Stanford because "it's a lot easier to do
that type of curricular thinking in a
group."
However, Dean of Undergraduate
Studies Tom Wasow said Stanford
already has a strong feminist studies
program. "As far as I know, we're the
first school in the country to adopt a
gender studies requirement. I think it's
a field where we have much to offer."
"Stanford would enter into a formal
ized relation only for mutual benefits,"
Wasow continued. He said he does not
know enough about Mills to determine
whether such a relationship will be ben
eficial to the two schools.
Discussing one area in which a rela
tionship could be beneficial, McKay said
research institutions have trouble
attracting women to their graduate pro
grams, particularly in the fields of sci
ence and engineering. Expanding rela
tionships with Mills could help Stanford
and UC-Berkeley attract more women,
she added.
At the same time, such a program
could help Mills students be "better able
to pursue graduate programs at Stan
ford," she said.
Another possibility would be estab
lishing an relationship like the "3/2"
engineering program that once existed
between Stanford and Mills. Under that

program, Mills undergraduates spent
three years there for a liberal arts edu
cation, followed by two years in an engi
neering program at Stanford, according
to an official at Mills' registrar's office.
McKay said the "3/2" program is "the
kind of relationship we'd like to encour-
u
age.
Wasow said Stanford is "always
interested in new ideas lhat will provide
improvements in educational opportu
nities for our students." He added that
he "would be receptive to better specifi
cations."
McKay said increased interschool
relations would also benefit the Mills
faculty, who "would welcome more
opportunities to participate in academic
pursuits and create discussion groups
with other campuses."
She also said she is especially Inter
ested in programs for older students
who are returning to school or who are
interested in continuing a lifelong edu
cation.
But Wasow said this older population
is one that Stanford has not targeted at
the undergraduate level.
"Any such program would require
significant adjustments in the patterns
we operate on," said Wasow. "I'm cer
tainly not precluding the possibility, but
it would require a lot of discussion."
