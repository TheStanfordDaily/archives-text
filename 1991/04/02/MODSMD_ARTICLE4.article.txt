# History majors to face more classes
## 
### Jill Daniels Staff writer 
Thanks to Stanford alumni,
students declaring majors in his
tory beginning this fall will face
more rigorous requirements.
Starting in 1991-92, students
majoring in history will be
required to take a minimum of 12
courses instead of 10 and partici
pate a senior research seminar.
Other changes include increas
ing the number of required writ
ing-intensive courses from six to
eight and abandoning the lan
guage requirement.
The Committee on Undergrad
uate Studies adopted the new pro
gram after conducting a survey
which found that Stanford history
graduates believe the major is too
easy.
Students who declare the
major before next fall can fulfill
the current requirements. History
majors currently must take one
introductory seminar and two
upper-level small-group courses
as part of the 10 required courses.
The new seminar will allow
students to examine primary his
torical documents, reinterpret
events based on secondary sources
or explore historiography, the
study of how historians' interpre
tations change perceptions of
events.
Seminar participants will pre
sent their research findings orally
and write a 20-page paper, said
Richard Roberts, associate profes
sor of history.
Roberts was one of six mem
bers of the Committee on Under
graduate Studies who reviewed
the history curriculum last sum
mer. Based on the results of a sur
vey sent to about 1,500 alumni
who have graduated as history
majors since 1970, the committee

determined that the mqjor should
be more rigorous.
The committee, composed of
five faculty members and one stu
dent, approved the new require
ments in late February
Reactions of current and
prospective history majors were
mixed.
According to senior history
major Christina Pisani, the
changes "sound good. A lot of stu
dents don't take courses beyond
the (introductory) small-group
requirements."
But junior Margaret Richen
said "I don't think getting rid of
the language requirement is the
greatest idea." She added that
studying a foreign language would
be helpful for history majors who
want to study abroad.
The department also changed
its distribution requirements to
correct for what was perceived to
be a Eurocentric bias. Under the
new system, requirements will
focus on more non-Western cul
tures.
"I think the changes are a bad
idea and will diffuse the major
away from concentrating on the
important historical movements
by creating more requirements in
non-Western areas," said one
freshman who plans to declare
this year.
Maria Reiling, the student rep
resentative on the committee, said
the changes should give "real sub
stance and satisfaction to history
majors."
In addition, Reiling said she
thinks more students might be
drawn to the more challenging
curriculum.
Roberts said, "I think students
will be excited because it means
we are taking them more seri
ously."
