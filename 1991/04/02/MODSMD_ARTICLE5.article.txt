# Staff position added to Row
## Program assistants will help RAs, plan programs 
### Brian Gerber Staff writer 
While some students may have only recently got
ten the terms RA, RF, RCC and AA straight, a new
position has been introduced for the 18 non-theme
Row houses next year — the program assistant.
Program assistants will be students who help res
ident assistants and other house officers develop
programs and activities.
Acting Row Director Jack Chin said Row resi
dence staffs need more help with programming. One
reason is that each house has only one RA, and none
has a resident fellow.
Another reason is that residents in upperclass
housing have more diverse interests and needs than
those in freshman dorms, he added.
Chin said that in these Row houses "it's a chal
lenge for educational programs to take place" and
that the program assistants will help tailor programs
to students' needs. They can also help take a load off
the RAs, who will be paid less next year due to Uni
versity budget cuts.
Taking the position of program assistant will give
students the opportunity to develop leadership

skills, and the experience could serve as a stepping
stone for a student aiming to become an RA, Chin
added.
The program will operate on a trial basis for the
1991-92 school year.
One program assistant position is available for
each non-theme Row house. Students can apply for
the job in houses where they are currently living or
have previously lived.
While there is no monetary compensation for the
position, a program assistant, like an RA or a resi
dent computer coordinator, is exempt from the Draw.
The new position will not be introduced in the
theme Row houses because they already have resi
dent fellows and theme associates. Program assis
tants will also not be placed in fraternities because
those houses are not a part of the Draw, Chin said.
Program assistant applications can be picked up
at the Row Office and are due Friday. The applica
tion, which is shorter than the one for RAs, focuses
on applicants' dorm programming experience and
asks them to elaborate on programming ideas of
their own.
The names of the program assistants for next
vear will be announced next week.
