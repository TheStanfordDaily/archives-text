# Pond to help decrease flooding
## 
### Peter Cousins Staff writer 
The puddles that flooded Palm
Drive during recent rains may
soon be a thing of the past.
As the first stage in a plan to
reduce flooding in that area, a new
man-made pond near the intersec
tion of Palm Drive and Arboretum
Road was completed late last
month.
The pond was constructed
instead of a proposed pump sta
tion that would have served the
same purpose — but for 20 times
the cost. The station would have
been part of the University's mas
ter storm-drain system but would
have cost an estimated $2 million.
The pond was built for roughly
$100,000.
Tom Richman, an engineer
with Facilities Project Manage
ment, explained the system: "We
collected the puddles along Palm
Drive and made one big puddle in

the arboretum."
Richman said the pond is
designed to prevent peak flooding.
The cubic volume of water going
into the pond exceeds the cubic
volume of water going out, drain
ing potential flood areas. Richman
expects that, due to evaporation
and absorption of the water into
the soil, 70 percent of the water
entering the pond will exit.
When the pond is full, excess
water will spill over a redwood
dam and enter a channel through
the arboretum. Ultimately the
water will enter the Palo Alto
storm drain.
Recent rains have filled the
pond up to the dam, Richman
said. "It's working better than
imagined."
The pond also features several
vernal pools, or basins that fill
with rainwater and form tempo
rary ponds and wetlands. As the
pools dry up, wildfiowers bloom in
concentric circles around the

shrinking bodies of water.
According to Stuart Weiss, a
research assistant with the Center
for Conservation Biology, vernal
pools — once common in the
Santa Clara Valley — were almost
entirely wiped out in the area long
ago.
The center will be using the
new pond as a educational
resource, Weiss said. Researchers
at the center are planting the
seeds of native grasses and wild
flowers around the pools.
Because of the absence of ver
nal pools locally, Weiss expects to
travel to Solano County or the
Central Valley, where the pools
still exist, to collect additional
seeds of plants specific to vernal
pools. He said that three or four
years after seeding, the pools will
have "sorted themselves out" and
will be very similar to "natural"
vernal pools.
