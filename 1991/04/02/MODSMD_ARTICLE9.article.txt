# Bible studiers learn lessons for life

### Sarah Morisseau Staff writer 
Surrounded by potato chips and pretzels,
the 10 or 15 people sitting on top of the desks,
on the floor and on the beds are ready to study.
The subject isn't Shakespeare or quantum
theory, but just "how things are going."
This "study session" isn't going on any
transcripts. It's not even for a class. But to
some Stanford students, these are the most
important lessons in life.
The participants in these sessions are
among the hundreds of graduate and under
graduate students who gather once a week —
sometimes even more often — to discuss the
Bible. And they say the Bible is more impor
tant than problem sets, papers and upcoming
midterms.
"The Bible is higher up on my priority list
than reading a [Cultures, Ideas and Values]
book. I know that it matters. It's not some
thing temporal — it's eternal," said freshman
Mark Hagfors. "Ask me after the final and I
won't remember anything about Dante, but
I'll remember what I learned in Bible study."
According to Lisa Kirazian, a junior who
leads several undergraduate Bible study
groups, "God and people are going to last
[longer] than your resume or grades."
Freshman Matt Thompson said, "I go to
Bible study not with the idea that I'm losing
out on time to do other work, but that I'm
really learning something worthwhile."
"My grades, my career, the rest of my life
make no difference compared to my commit
ment to God," Thompson said. "The Bible
study has some meaning. It's something I can
hold on to, something to stand on. It makes all

my other work gain more meaning and
strength."
But why is this book more important than
all the others, especially those related to
classes?
"It's a guidebook for life," said graduate
student Steve Everett. He added that the Bible
helps him "put things in perspective. School
isn't the big thing in life."
Many students who join non-denomina
tional Bible studies say the groups' big draw is
developing a friendship with God. And the way
to do that is through reading and studying the
Bible.
"Studying the Bible makes you realize that
what ultimately makes you happy is not your
grades, but your relationship with God and
with other people," Kirazian said.
Graduate student Awele Ndili said he "had
always thought about God as being far away
and remote, but through studying the Bible
I've found that he's a personal God who wants
to talk to you, get to know you and be your
friend."
As participants push the homemade choco
late chip cookies into the middle of the group,
the discussion gets going. Here, many stu
dents say, is the heart of the Bible study, which
often involves a modern-day application of the
Bible. Students say these discussions can lead
to great friendships.

"My most meaningful relationships are
ones with people (at Bible study)," Thompson
said. "When I go to Bible study we're account
able to each other. We tell each other what's
going on, we hurt for each other, we're happy
for each other when things go well."
Freshman Jun Lee said, "If you play bas
ketball with a person, you get to know them
that way. I think studying the Bible is a lot the
same, you're learning about your friends in a
totally new way. It's like an added face."
Ndili said he met his only real friends at
Stanford through Bible studies. Ndili is Nige
rian, and he came to the United States for the
first time in September. "It's like I have a
thousand and one brothers and sisters now,"
he said.
The cookies eaten, the milk gone, the dis
cussion winds down and the group starts get
ting ready to go home. But the discussion
doesn't stop when the door closes behind the
last to leave.
"The issues brought up are ones which
come up in our everyday lives. It doesn't leave
them when they walk out the door," said
Kirazian.
"In a sense, I go to Bible study in order to
leave," Thompson said. "I go to replenish and
prepare. When I leave I'm ready to do more
than just survive."
