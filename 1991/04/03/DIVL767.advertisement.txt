MEET NEW PEOPLE...
MAKE NEW FRIENDS!
You and your friends are invited to brunch in
the home of a local Stanford alum! It's a
great chance to get off-campus and to meet
new students, alums and faculty. Alumni have
volunteered to host groups of 5-10 students
to brunch in their homes on Sunday, April 21.
Sign-up between April 1 and 5, in the lobby at
Bowman Alumni House. Space is limited, so
hurry! This event is for undergrads only.
There will be a separate brunch for grads.
For more information,
call Carolyn at 725-STAN.
