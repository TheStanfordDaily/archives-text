Two roads diverged in a wood and I —
I took the one less traveled by.
And that has made all the difference.
n years past, Off The Farm
M 0 has pointed you to attrac-
V tions, sights and day trips
K in San Francisco, the
B Peninsula, the East Bay
and greater California.
You may have read about the Monterey
Aquarium, the Haight District, the Santa
Cruz Boardwalk, Disneyland or Yosemite.
All great places to visit when you want to
get away from Stanford.
But the Robert Frost in us aches for
something more.
We want to visit Chinatown, but we
want to see more than the regular shops
and restaurants.
We want to check out the Santa Cruz
Mystery Spot, where they say gravity has
gone screwy.
We want to explore the worlds of
witchcraft, body piercing, stargazing and
the blues.
And finally, we want to look at San
Francisco's tackiest tourist attractions
through new eyes — those of Joel Stein,
to be precise.
Come with us as we venture into new
venues, as we trod new trails, as we go
Off the Beaten Path.
Happy Trails,
5
