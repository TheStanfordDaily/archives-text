### 
Coffee, you dispel the worries
of the great, . . . you are the drink
of the friends of God . . .
You are the common man's gold,
and like gold,
you bring to every man
the feeling of
luxury and nobility.
Where coffee is served, there is grace,
splendour, friendship
and happiness.
You flow through the body
as freely as life's blood,
refreshing all that you touch."
(Sheikh Ansari, Sixteenth-century)
