# Course reader printers subject to copyright laws, court rules
## 
### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Staff writer 
A federal court ruling which limits
commercial printers from photocopy
ing published texts has delayed the
production of spring course readers at
some universities across the country.
But while the ruling has the poten
tial to inconvenience faculty and stu
dents here, it is still unclear what
effect it will ultimately have.
A New York district court ruled last
Thursday that Kinko's Graphics Cor
poration, based in Ventura, Calif.,
infringed on the copyrights of text
book publishers by printing items
such as course readers. The court deci
sion ended a 1989 lawsuit brought by

eight book publishers against Kinko's.
The court effectively rejected
Kinko's claims that the use of the
material in course readers was legal
under copyright law because it served
educational purposes. The judge said
Kinko's product created a copyright
infringement because "a significant
portion of the original work was
copied."
"This is a sad day for the educa
tional community," said Kurt Koenig,
Kinko's vice president and counsel, in
a prepared statement after the court
decision last week.
Although the freshness of the court
ruling has made it too early to defini
tively assess its impact at Stanford,
professors and staff speculated that

the ruling could:
• Delay the printing of course read
ers until copyright privileges are
granted by the publishers,
• Make it difficult for instructors to
provide recent course readings
because of the time it takes to receive
clearance from publishers,
• Force students to purchase entire
books instead of using course readers
with selected pieces,
• Place a heavier burden on the
reserves system at the University
libraries, and
• Increase the cost of copies, as
expenses of obtaining publisher
approval and other fees are passed on

Although this notice says photocopying materials for teaching and scholarship is permissible, a court recently ruled
that a commercial printer infringed on the copyrights of textbook publishers by producing items such as course
readers. Some Stanford professors speculate the ruling could delay the printing of course readers until copyright
privileges are granted, or force students to buy entire books.
