# Course reader printers subject to copyright laws, court rules
## 
### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Staff writer 
A federal court ruling which limits
commercial printers from photocopy
ing published texts has delayed the
production of spring course readers at
some universities across the country.
But while the ruling has the poten
tial to inconvenience faculty and stu
dents here, it is still unclear what
effect it will ultimately have.
A New York district court ruled last
Thursday that Kinko's Graphics Cor
poration, based in Ventura, Calif.,
infringed on the copyrights of text
book publishers by printing items
such as course readers. The court deci
sion ended a 1989 lawsuit brought by

eight book publishers against Kinko's.
The court effectively rejected
Kinko's claims that the use of the
material in course readers was legal
under copyright law because it served
educational purposes. The judge said
Kinko's product created a copyright
infringement because "a significant
portion of the original work was
copied."
"This is a sad day for the educa
tional community," said Kurt Koenig,
Kinko's vice president and counsel, in
a prepared statement after the court
decision last week.
Although the freshness of the court
ruling has made it too early to defini
tively assess its impact at Stanford,
professors and staff speculated that

the ruling could:
• Delay the printing of course read
ers until copyright privileges are
granted by the publishers,
• Make it difficult for instructors to
provide recent course readings
because of the time it takes to receive
clearance from publishers,
• Force students to purchase entire
books instead of using course readers
with selected pieces,
• Place a heavier burden on the
reserves system at the University
libraries, and
• Increase the cost of copies, as
expenses of obtaining publisher
approval and other fees are passed on

Although this notice says photocopying materials for teaching and scholarship is permissible, a court recently ruled
that a commercial printer infringed on the copyrights of textbook publishers by producing items such as course
readers. Some Stanford professors speculate the ruling could delay the printing of course readers until copyright
privileges are granted, or force students to buy entire books.
to the purchaser.
The ruling marks a reinterpre
tacion of the 1976 federal Copy
right Act. Under the provisions of
Section 107 of that act — known
as the Fair Use clause — faculty
members were permitted to make
multiple copies of copyrighted
materials for class use without
permission from the publisher.
Now Kinko's and other
copiers, including those located
on the Stanford campus, must
first obtain written permission
from textbook publishers and pay
fees for using the published mate
rial. And some legal experts said
they fear the new interpretation
of the act could mark the end of

fair use privileges.
While some observers heralded
the court ruling as a victory for
book publishers, officials at
Kinko's and faculty members at
other Bay Area schools called the
decision necessary for the pub
lishers but inconvenient for pro
fessors and students.
"Professors across the country
depend on Kinko's [and other
copiers] to help provide them with
up-to-date course materials for
their students. Professors and
students . . . will suffer because of
this decision," Koenig said.
Additionally, officials at
schools such as UC-Santa Cruz
and UC-Davis — which along
with Stanford operate on the
quarter system — anticipated
complications because of the deci
sion's proximity to the start of
spring classes.

Adrianna Ross, corporate com
munications director for Kinko's,
said this academic quarter will see
the most significant problems.
"But in the long run all opera
tions should return to normal."
She also said the company is cur
rently considering appealing the
decision.
For Mary Beth Saffo, a profes
sor of biology at UC-Santa Cruz,
where Kinko's supplies nearly
half of course readers, problems
are beginning to mushroom.
"Because of the suddenness of
the notice, there was no way for
me to plan ahead for my classes,"
Saffo said. "Many of the readers
that I had planned to pick up
today I couldn't. The people at
Kinko's could not sell it to me or
give it away."
" There were lots of irate pro
fessors in Kinko's today," Saffo

added.
At Stanford, however, a situa
tion as severe as the one at UC-
Santa Cruz is not expected. In
addition to Kinko's, Copy mat and
other off-campus photocopier
centers, Stanford students and
staff also have access to the Uni
versity-owned private copiers.
"This ruling is not going to
impact us directly at all," said
Roger Reynolds, director of
course materials at the Book
store's copy facility. "We have
been clearing copyrights all
along."
Reynolds explained that the
Bookstore is part of a licensing
agreement established between
the University and a consortium
of 25 publishers. Non-university
photocopy concerns like Kinko's
do not enjoy this right, he said.
