Hostages may be released
NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — The foreign min
ister of Switzerland, the intermediary between
Iran and the United States, arrived yesterday
in Tehran amid growing signs that Western
hostages held by pro-Iranian radicals in
Lebanon could soon be freed.
Tehran radio, monitored in Nicosia, said
Rene Felber would meet during his three-day
visit with Iranian President Hashemi Rafsan
jani and Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati.
British businessman Roger Cooper was
released from a Tehran prison yesterday after
nearly 5% years in prison on espionage charges.
The release of Cooper was seen as a further
sign that Rafsanjani, who is believed to want to
improve ties with the West and close the chap
ter on Iran's involvement in terrorism, was
ready to order the release of the hostages.
Sources in Tehran, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said Iranian officials sensed an
unprecedented "seriousness" in Washington to
solve the hostages issue in a "comprehensive
way." What the officials mean, the sources said,
is that Washington has promised to help
unfreeze billions of dollars of Iranian assets.
Sino-Soviet dispute near resolution
BEIJING (AP) — Soviet and Chinese offi
cials agree on 90 percent of their common bor
der and expect to sign an agreement soon on
the entire boundary, the Soviet Union's foreign
minister said yesterday.
"We have made great progress on the border
talks," Alexander Bessmertnykh told reporters at
the end of his three-day visit. "The progress is
very impressive and we shall finish it quite soon."
Bessmertnykh arrived in Beijing Sunday
night, mainly to prepare for Chinese Commu
nist Party leader Jiang Zemin's trip to Moscow.
Asked if the border agreement would be
signed before Jiang's Moscow trip, Bessmert
nykh said: "We will see. We will try."
Drive to oust Yeltsin abandoned
MOSCOW (AP) — Hard-line Communists
yesterday dropped their drive to dump Russian
leader Boris N. Yeltsin, in yet another sign of a
stalemate between reformers and conserva
tives in Soviet politics.
"Let's agree on the fact that the situation in
Russia is serious. And our duty is to stop disin
tegration in all spheres of Russia's life," Rus
sian Communist Party leader Ivan Polozkov
told a meeting of the Russian congress.
