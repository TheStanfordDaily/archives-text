# L.A. Mayor Bradley asks police chief to resign

### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) - Mayor
Tom Bradley called yesterday for the
resignation of embattled Police Chief
Daryl F. Gates, one month after the
videotaped police beating of a black
motorist shamed the city.
"I simply will not stand by as our
city is being torn apart," Bradley said
during a news conference. "Chief
Gates, now is the time for you to do the
right thing for your officers, for your
department, for the public you serve."
Bradley, who had hesitated to
directly ask that Gates quit despite
persistent outrage and daily calls for
the police chiefs ouster, informed
Gates of his decision during a face-to
face meeting at City Hall.
Gates refused to step down, Bradley
said.
"He said, 'Mayor, I think you're

wrong, and I will not resign," Bradley
said.
Bradley doesn't have the power to
fire Gates, who has civil service protec
tion, but the Police Commission can
remove him. Gates has been steadfast
in his determination not to quit before
cleaning up the department he's led
for 13 years of his 43 years with the
department.
Momentum for Gates' ouster has
been building since the March 3 club
bing of Rodney King. Hours before the
mayor's announcement, the American
Civil Liberties Union said it had
20,000 signatures asking Gates to
resign.
The King beating, captured on
video by a bystander in suburban Lake
View Terrace, was repeatedly shown to
millions on television and led to con

demnation by President Bush and civil
rights groups.
"I'm glad the mayor has responded
to the overwhelming cry for Police
Chief Gates to resign. Each day
another organization has stepped for
ward to ask for it," said Ramona Rip
ston, executive director of the ACLU of
Southern California.
"I think the mayor is cautious by
nature and he wanted to be sure that
when he did it it was what the commu
nity wants, what the city as a whole
wanted," Ripston said.
Several investigations were under
way in the King incident. In addition
to Justice Department probes, a blue
ribbon citizens panel selected by
Bradley began a probe on Monday, and
Gates appointed another panel last
week.

Earlier yesterday, leaders of a newly
formed group of black law enforce
ment officers claimed there was
widespread racism within the Police
Department.
"Silence is complicity, and we have
agreed to break that silence in an
effort to gain the community's trust
and support," said Officer Carl McGill,
head of the 100-member African
American Peace Officer Association.
"We are also calling upon our fellow
officers of all colors to uphold their
oath of service by following our lead,"
said McGill. The Los Angeles Police
Department has more than 8,300 offi
cers.
The group was formed prior to the
King beating.
