ANKARA, Turkey (AP) â€” Fearing another large
Kurdish refugee wave, Turkish officials yesterday
urged the U.N. Security Council to take up discus
sion of the Iraqi Kurds forced out of their homes by
fighting.
The Foreign Ministry instructed the Turkish
ambassador to the United Nations to ask the council
to convene on the issue, officials said.
Iraqi Ambassador Rafi Dhaham al-Tikriti and the
ambassadors of the permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council were summoned to the Foreign
Ministry and told of the request. The permanent
members are China, France, the Soviet Union,
Britain and the United States.
Officials in the capital, Ankara, say more than
200,000 refugees are massed on the border waiting
to cross into Turkey, but have been blocked by Turk
ish soldiers.
The stream of refugees has grown in recent days
as Saddam Hussein's troops drove the rebels out of
many cities they had seized in recent days.
Turkish officials are worried of the huge financial
and social burdens of another major refugee wave.
In 1988, an estimated 60,000 Iraqi Kurds arrived
after an Iraqi chemical-weapons offensive, and about
half of the refugees remain in Turkey. The rest have
gone to Iran or returned home.
A statement from the government's National
Security Council said, "The lives of over 200,000 peo
ple, mostly women and children, assembled on the
(Turkish-Iraqi) border with the intention of taking
refuge in our country are in mortal danger.
