## Don't let frats build 
### 
Selling campus land to
highest bidder would
create risky precedent

IT'S THE SAME OLD fight, but
this time the tactics have
changed.
For several years, unhoused fra
ternities have been trying to con
vince the University to let them
have campus housing.
Administrators have continually
responded that the number of
housed fraternities will not be
expanded, according to a 1982 pol
icy which states, "The University
is committed to allowing some
selective housing, but does not
plan to increase significantly the
proportion of spaces filled by sub
jectively selective means."
In the most recent battle,
though, the Alpha Epsilon Pi fra
ternity members are trying out a
new weapon: They are not asking
to be given an existing University
house, but to build one at no cost to
Stanford. And they claim the pro
portion of fraternity housing would
still be less than it was when the
policy was written, since some fra
ternities have lost houses and more
spaces are opening up in dorms.
But the University is sticking to
its guns, as it should.
Allowing University land to go
to the highest bidder would set a
dangerous precedent. Should any
group that can raise enough money
be allowed to build a house on cam
pus? If the University allows the
fraternity to build, it puts itself in
danger of having to yield to

requests from any special interest
groups.
And although constructing the
Alpha Epsilon Pi house would add
40 beds to the undergraduate
housing pool, the negatives would
outweigh the positives.
At the same time, however,
administrators must be honest
about their intentions for the
Greek system. They have denied
time and time again that they are
trying to "phase out" housed fra
ternities.
But a policy and practice allow
ing fraternity houses to be taken
away and not given back will, in
effect, put an end to the fraterni
ties.
If the University is committed to
some selective housing, as the pol
icy states, then it should allow
unhoused fraternities to take the
houses of other groups which are
not meeting their quotas.
If the University questions the
merits and benefits of housed fra
ternities, it should say so and open
debate on the issue.
The only opinions that have
been expressed are those of a few
key administrators and vocal fra
ternity members. The views of
other students and faculty mem
bers could, and should, help deter
mine the future of Stanford's
Greek system. An ASSU poll on
the issue, or the inclusion of a
question on the spring ballot, could
gauge the reactions of the student
body.
As for the Alpha Epsilon Pis,
there is a solution. If they can't
build a house on campus, they can
always use the money to buy a
house close by.
