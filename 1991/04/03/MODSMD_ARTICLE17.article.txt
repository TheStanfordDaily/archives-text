## No April fooling about it 
### 
OK, I ADMIT IT. I BOUGHT IT. All
of it. When I picked up The Daily
on Monday and read the front
page, I started getting ready to shake
Gen. Norman SchwarzkopPs hand. I
scratched Storey House from my Draw
card. I even imagined Winona Ryder and
Christian Slater camping out for Fiction
Writing.
I soon discovered that I'd been had, of
course, but I appreciated the humor. And
the real news that followed was almost as
funny (and far-fetched) as the fake. Stan
ford wins NIT? Tom Campbell decides to
run for Senate? Don Kennedy apologizes
for indirect cost mess? Un-huh.
I might well have believed that the
whole issue was a joke if I hadn't kept
reading, past the April foolishness and
the sports, to page 16, where I found the
headline "Senior killed in jump off
bridge." The wording makes it sound like
a miscalculation with a bungee cord, but
the plain fact is that a Stanford student
stopped his car on the Golden Gate
Bridge, went to the rail and killed himself
by jumping into the Bay.
It's certainly the type of article we'd all
like to think is meant as a joke, however
poor such humor would be. None of us
wants to hear that someone our age has
died. And none of us wants to think that
someone at Stanford, the idyllic play
ground at which we've chosen to spend a
good chunk of our childhoods, would
want to commit suicide.
Some people I've talked to about the
incident have just shaken their heads,
said it's horrible and changed the sub
ject. But others have been less charitable,

saying that suicide is stupid, or spiteful,
or cowardly, a drastically permanent solu
tion to a temporary problem. Life is good,
isn't it? Why end it? The pain will pass,
they say. Call the Bridge. Talk about it.
You'll get over it.
But I think we have to realize that
sometimes life isn't so good, and that
there are some wounds the Bridge just
can't heal.
I didn't know the student who killed
himself, nor do I know anything about
him. All I can do is offer my condolences
to his family and friends. I have, however,
once had a more direct experience with
suicide and its trauma, when, during my
sophomore year of high school, a fresh
man hung himself from the rafters over
the stage in the school auditorium.
Needless to say, all hell broke loose.
Students cried, and held vigils, and went
to the memorial service. Affluent, well
educated parents, who thought they had
provided a lovely, loving community,
wanted to know what had gone wrong.
School ground to a halt. The adminis
tration quickly organized counseling
groups and schoolwide assemblies, and
our teachers, only too willing to help, gave
their class sessions over to discussions of
our feelings about the death. Very few
teachers, before or since, have spent 45
minutes asking me how I felt.
Our classes that week were a time to
shed tears and show our grief, but they
were also a time to vent our anger. Sev
eral of our teachers told us that suicide
was a selfish, hateful act, intended only to
hurt the survivors. And the nature of the
death, in public, where he would be found

by his friends and teachers, certainly
seemed like an elaborate, dramatic way to
flip us all off.
A rumor spread that the student had
killed himself because he had a meeting
that morning with his parents and his
guidance counselor and couldn't face up
to it. On hearing this, our feelings were
confirmed: The death was a waste,
frivolous and misguided.
But in our rush to comfort ourselves,
to make the pain of losing a friend or a
classmate or a student go away, we forget
who the real victim is. The kid who hung
himself may have been angry and may
not have been thinking straight, but
that's hardly enough to make someone
want to die; the fact is that he was pro
foundly, terribly depressed.
Despair may be temporary, but it
doesn't seem that way to someone con
sumed by it. There's nothing impulsive or
imaginary about an emotion that brings
someone to jump off a bridge. We may not
share those emotions, but we'd better
learn to understand them, before the fact,
so that we won't have to lament them
afterward.
