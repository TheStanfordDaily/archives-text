## Ex-senator calls for fundamental changes in ASSU 
### 
THE DAILY'S DEAD WEEK issue
offered a reasoned and intelligent
set of suggestions for altering the
ASSU elections, claiming that represen
tation by residence would greatly
improve the effectiveness of the student
government. While I'm inclined to agree
with such a proposal, this is the second
time in as many years that The Daily has
made this suggestion, and it sure doesn't
look like anyone's interested.
As a former ASSU senator and service
project director, I think the problem with
the representation-by-dorms suggestion
is that it implies that membership rather
than mission is what's wrong with the
ASSU. I don't believe this is the case —
many of the current senators and Coun
cil of Presidents members could actually
serve some useful purpose, provided a
few fundamental changes were made in
the ASSU's role on campus.

Get rid of the ASSU political parties.
The parties, such as The People's Plat
form, were only legalized a few years
ago. Before that, any sharing of
resources between senate candidates was
grounds for disqualification. These days,
the self-appointed illuminati who run
each party make their picks as to whom
their candidates are; each party gets
about half the senate, and the two sides
bicker for the next year. The experiment
with ASSU political parties should be
terminated immediately.
Get rid of senate alternates. As if 20
senators weren't enough bureaucracy to
endure, the alternate system gives us 20
more senators, except that these ones
don't vote as often. There are two big
problems here. First, the system encour
ages absenteeism, since senators can
blow off meetings without endangering
the quorum. Worse, there's no account

ability to the students. The only reason
for senate alternates is to give 20 more
people resume-packing material.
Adopt the Overdeck bill. Do you think
President Bush or Saddam Hussein
cared about the ASSU's war-related res
olutions? The ASSU exists to serve the
students, not to pretend to represent
them in world affairs.
Make the "real" ASSU fees refund
able. The ASSU gets its funds not from
the line marked "ASSU fees" on every
one's University bill, but from Sunday
Flicks profits, interest from student
group funds and a totally non-refundable
$150,000 which it gets from the Dean of
Student Affairs. If students really want
to take their money away from the
ASSU, then they should be able to; tak
ing money away from student groups
with the current refund system does
nothing to the ASSU.

Moreover, if the ASSU's elected repre
sentatives knew their funding depended
entirely on their performance, I think
we'd see an exponential improvement.
Reduce the COP to three members.
Most slates I've ever talked to admitted
they had a member on board just to have
four people. At $5,000 per year per mem
ber, the other three could pick up the
slack and save the students some money.
Revive the "ASSUNews." One thing
the Chapparal's COP slate of yesteryear
actually did was to buy a one-page ad in
The Daily every other week and use it as
the "ASSU News," which included the
results of all senate debates and tallies of
the roll-call votes. When we get rid of
that $5,000 COP salary, an objective and
factual "ASSU News" would be a very
good thing on which to spend it.
