# Reader condemns military mindset, its ramifications
## 
### 
IN THE APR. 1 DAILY, John Wheeler
writes, "Military service changes
your life forever. ... [II learned that
we exist to give love and receive 10ve...
[and that thel North Vietnamese, like
Saddam Hussein, systematically killed
babies. Stopping such thugs is worth
dying for."
I am prepared to bet everything I own
that the U.S. Armed Forces managed to
"systematically kill" more babies in Iraq
than Saddam ever dreamed of doing, not
to mention the dead babies of Panama,
Vietnam, Korea, Hiroshima, Dresden
and the like.
If stopping "thugs" is such a moral
imperative, where is Wheeler's condem
nation of Guatemala, the People's
Republic of China and Taiwan, all of
whom receive U.S. dollars at the expense

of the lives of babies in Harlem and Los
Angeles?
Where is Wheeler's disgust for the
CIA, which not only funds and superin
tends, but also devises and staffs schools
of torture, such as those in El Salvador
and Chile?
Wheeler singles out Saddam, but Sad
dam is symptomatic of the military syn
drome. The military mind made Saddam
possible in the first place; now we are
supposed to trust the very machinery
which created him to take care of him,
even though the same strategies being
used to achieve his downfall are the
same ones that were used to empower
him.
Yesterday, it was the United States
and Saddam versus Iran; today, the
United States and Syria versus Saddam;

tomorrow, who knows? Thus, the mili
tary pretends to extinguish what it
merely perpetuates.
Wheeler flatters himself by saying
only one way to stop Saddam existed, but
that's because, like Saddam, the military
mind is essentially disposed to violence
in achieving its own "rightful" interests.
Simplify the Middle East all you want,
bomb "them" to kingdom come, and see
what it gets you in 10 to 20 years â€”
more of the same.
No wonder Wheeler can write, "the
culture is ready for female casualties." It
always was; it just didn't want them in
the arena reserved for male heroism.
Well, I am not ready for either female or
male casualties, not for the reasons in
Wheeler's rhetorical inventory.
It is obscene to use the word "love" in

describing the effects of an institution in
which the primary means of achieving its
ends is the slaughter of human beings.
Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf said, "They
do not value the sanctity of human life
the way we do," but it's not the sanctity
of human life to which he refers, only
the sanctity of particular lives.
If Wheeler wants to put his life on the
line for love, he should join the Peace
Corps; better yet, he should go to Detroit
or East Palo Alto and work for justice
and fair opportunities for all children.
And there is a better alternative to
mandatory military service. How about
mandatory community service? How
about experience with suffering and lives
rather than macho hysteria and murder?
