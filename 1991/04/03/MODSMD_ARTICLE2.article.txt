# New vice president appointed
## 
### Peter Cousins Staff writer 
The search to fill the newly cre
ated vice presidency for Human
Resources has ended with the
appointment of Barbara Butter
field, currently vice president for
Human Resources at the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania.
Butterfield will officially take
her post May 1. As vice president,
she will oversee employee rela
tions, management development
and employee benefits.
Provost James Rosse called the
new position an "upgrade"
designed to replace the acting
director who currently heads
Human Resources Services. After
Butterfield takes over, the depart
ment will become independent of
its current home â€” the Office of

Administrative Resources.
Rosse described Butterfield's
task as "putting the (Human
Resources] organizations back on
their feet," adding that she may
need to change the department's
size to better serve the Univer
sity's needs. In addition, as part of
the University's ongoing reorga
nization, some Human Resources
programs will be decentralized
and integrated into specific
departments.
Butterfield is no stranger to
reorganization. While human
resources director at Pennsylva
nia, she successfully reduced costs
by $2 million.
Despite her past successes,
Butterfield said conditions at
Stanford will require special
methods. "The environment here
is very different" than at Pennsvl

vania, she said, adding that using
the same cost-reduction methods
she has used there "would be a
disservice to Stanford."
But Butterfield said she will
employ the same type of "strategic
planning" she uses in her current
job to analyze objectively what
course of action will be best for
Stanford.
Butterfield said she hopes to
discover the "vision Stanford has
for itself" and then help the Stan
ford community fulfill that vision.
She said she expects to start to
accomplish this goal through
meetings with Human Resources
staff, the deans and other Univer
sity employees.
"This is a long-term project,"
she said, stressing she isn't antici
pating overnight results.
Butter field said several factors
contributed to her decision to
come to Stanford. "I've always
had a predisposition to private
universities," she said, adding
that she considers Stanford to be
the "most beautiful and personal
of the private universities."
She added that during a visit to
campus, she felt a real sense of
"colleagueship" among the Uni
versity's employees and discov
ered their real sense of commit
ment and concern.
However, Butterfield said the
"cracking blow" that influenced
her decision to accept the offer
was the requests of Vice President
of Administrative Resources Su
Schaffer and four Stanford deans.
She added that she was impressed
with the "coordination" of their
appeals.

Butterfield said she will arrive
in Stanford in late April but will
continue to officially work for
Pennsylvania until May 1. "This
will smooth my entry into Stan
ford while smoothing my exit"
from Pennsylvania, she said.
