## Stern-faced Malueg leads Card in Texas 
### Gretchen Atwood Staff writer 
The wind swirled and
whipped repeatedly inside the
bowl of Stanford Stadium. On
this sunny and breezy spring
afternoon the throwers of the
Cardinal track and field team
were practicing the discus.
Senior Debbie Malueg was
in the ring. She planted her
feet at the back of the ring, her
arm slightly outstretched in
front of her and her fingers
curled around the edge of the
one kilogram disc. She paused.
Then in one fluid motion she
whipped her body around one
and a half times and let the disc
fly. It rocketed in a graceful arc
across the field, landing well
beyond the orange cone mark
ing 160 feet.
"That felt good," Malueg
said with a smile. According to
her teammates and coach Jed
Goldfried that is as much of a
reaction as you'll see from
Malueg after a throw.
"She does tend to stay
pretty mellow and taciturn.
She stays inside of herself —
not a lot of external excite
ment," Goldfried said.
Although she does appear
calm, Malueg concedes that she
feels the pressure. "You don't
really want to let the competi
tors know if you're worried
about them. I guess its my
meet face so I look calm all the
time," Malueg said.
Besides the discus Malueg
also participates in the shot
put, an event in which she
placed third in the Pacific 10
Conference last year. This year
the former Oregon state champ
in both discus and shot put is
steadily focusing her sights on
the conference meet and, hope
fully, the NCAA Champi
onships. Her seriousness in the
ring, however, does not keep
her from having fun during
practice.
While sophomore Pat Stow
ell was taking discus practice
he lost control of his momen
tum and finished outside of the
ring. This brought chuckles
from Malueg and other throw
ers waiting their turn.
Stowell turned to Goldfried
and said, "Tell her to quit
laughing at me." After Gold
fried did, Malueg said, "I'm not
the only one [who is laugh
ing]." This reply elicited sev
eral "Ooooh"s from team
mates.
"They've got this weird sib
ling-like relationship," said
Goldfried. "It's very bizarre.
She's the older sister. He's the

younger brother. They fight
like cats and dogs. They're big
pain-in-the-asses to each
other."
Malueg and Stowell both
insist they are good friends and
help each other in the ring.
Stowell said that the throwers
encourage each other and there
are no big rivalries on the
team. He said that Malueg has
an understood leadership role.
"Because she works so hard
she's definitely a role model to
all the young people," Stowell
said.
The role Malueg wants to
assume next is that of qualifier
for the NCAA Championships.
Several weeks ago Malueg
threw far enough to provision
ally qualify for NCAAs, but she
probably has to throw over 170
feet to make the Championship
field. She hopes to do that in
the next month of competition.
This week should be a big
test for Malueg as the Texas
Relays begin. Some of the best
throwers in the country will be
there, including a stellar trio
from UCLA.
The prospect of top-level
competition doesn't phase
Malueg, however. "I'd like to
get some PRs (personal
records) there. I'm throwing
really well in practice so I think
its time for me to hit good
throws in meets," Malueg said.
She is keying on the three
home meets after Texas Relays
for some of her best throws. "I
like competing at home the
best. I'm used to the ring. . .
and I get to sleep in my own
bed," Malueg said.
Goldfried is cautiously opti
mistic about Malueg's chances
of qualifying during the home
meets. "She's worked very
hard. You can't fault her for
that. She's killing herself,"
Goldfried said.
He said her technique and
grace are her strengths. "She's
fluid and graceful. She really
flows. That's why she is better
in the discus. She's not particu
larly quick and powerful but
she's very strong for her
weight."
Getting the chance to com
pete in her home state of Ore
gon at the NCAAs is extra
incentive for Malueg. "All our
high school state meets were at
that field so it would be nice to
go back and do well there," she
said.
It would cap off a season
which did not start well for her.
Goldfried is in his first year as
the Stanford throw coach and
Malueg said the adjustment to
a new coach took some time.
