# Batsmen overpower hapless Dons
## 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
USF is no USC, but a win is a
win, and the Stanford baseball
team had no trouble getting No.
20 yesterday at the University of
San Fransisco's Benedetti field.
Scoring two runs in the first, the
Cardinal was never threatened
the entire game, relying on solid
pitching to defeat the Dons 8-1.
"It might sound stupid to say
our pitchers shut down a 6-24
team like USF," said second base
man Chris Kemper, "but any time
the other team only scores one
run, you know your pitchers are
doing a good job."
Reliever Jamie Sepeda com
bined with starter Steve Worrell
and closer Scott Wiess to pitch a
four-hitter and strike out 11.
Sepeda picked up the win to stay
undefeated on the season at 2-0,
but the real story on the mound
was the return of Worrell.
The lefthander last saw action
February 13, 1990 against San
Jose State before undergoing
surgery to remove bone chips in
his left elbow. The 13-plus months
of rehabilition showed as the
junior walked four in 4.1 innings,
but with 22 games to be played
this April, Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess is happy to get all
the pitching depth he can get.
"(Worrell) was a little wild, but
after more than a year he did
really well," said Marquess. "We
have a lot of games back-to-back

'Worrel was a little
wild, but after more
than a year he did
really well.'
— Mark Marquess

(coming up), so he could see some
action."
The victory was a solid effort
by the Cardinal as the team scored
in five innings, evenly spacing its
eight runs among 12 hits. Stan
ford scored twice in the first,
fourth, and seventh innings, with
solo runs in the second and sixth.
The Dons were not able to get on
the board until the seventh when
5-foot-8 mighty mite Tony
Sylvestri blasted the first home
run of his career to left field.
There were no errors committed
by either side.
"It was a pretty well-played
game," Marquess said. "We scored
eight runs, but we didn't have any
big innings. It wasn't that (USF)
played badly; we just got some
timely hits."
The Cardinal opened up an
early 2-0 lead when a Ryan
Turner ground out to second
scored Kemper and was followed
by a Steve Solomon bunt single
that brought home first baseman
Dave McCarty. Solomon, who
went 3-for-5 on the day, later
scored in the seventh when his

double to left was followed by a
xerox shot by shortstop Roger
Burnett, giving Stanford a com
fortable 8-0 lead.
The Cardinal could manage no
more runs after Don starter Ted
Langowski (0-9) was replaced by
Tim Dilullo. Dillullo came on in

the seventh following the back-to
back doubles and gave up only one
hit over the last three innings.

Southern Division weekend series
