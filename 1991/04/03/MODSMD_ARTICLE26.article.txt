## 
### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
Despite some lingering injuries, third
ranked Stanford sent notice to second-ranked
USC and top-ranked UCLA that this week
end's matches in Los Angeles will not be cake
walks.
The notice came in the form of a 7-1 thrash
ing of Northwestern yesterday at Stanford
Tennis Stadium. "It was a good businesslike
match," coach Dick Gould said. "We played
tentative in some spots, but overall it was a
good effort."
The Cardinal swept the six singles matches
against the Wildcats, with the only loss coming
in No. 1 doubles.
Alex O'Brien, presently ranked No. 8 by the
Volvo Tennis/Collegiate Rankings, led the
charge with a 6-2, 3-0 (retired) victory over
Northwestern's No. 1 Steve Herdoiza. O'Brien
overpowered Herdoiza from the baseline in the
first and was leading 3-0 in the second when
Herdoiza retired because of a foot injury.
"I've gotten a little confidence back (after
some earlier losses)," O'Brien said. "I'm start
ing to figure out ways to win, whether that
means coming up or staying back or mixing it
up. I'm adapting my game and starting to do
what I need to [do to] win."

After O'Brien's victory, Vimal Patel made it
2-0 with a 6-3, 6-0 trouncing of Geoff Young at
No. 5 singles. Glenn Solomon followed suit at
No. 6 singles, crunching Wisconsin's four-time
high school state champion Marc Eisen 6-1,6-
0.
Jonathan Stark started slow but made the
match 4-0 with a 7-5, 6-1 triumph over Giora
Payes at No. 2 singles. As usual, Stark, who
has been injured most of the seaon, came up
with the big points when he needed them. "I
didn't serve that well. It seemed like I got
down love-30 in every game. But when I
needed the point, I usually came up with a big
serve," Stark said.
Despite being sick, Jason Yee clinched the
match at 5-0 with a 6-4, 7-6 win over Todd
Occomy at No. 3 singles. "Jason really stayed
focused out there," Gould said. "That was an
impressive win, considering [Yee] was sick."
In the day's most exciting match, freshman
Michael Flanagan outlasted Anthony Roy 6-4,
6-7, 6-4 at No. 4 singles. After winning the
first set, Flanagan rolled out to a 3-0 lead in
the second before Roy inched his way back into
the match. "When I got up 3-0 in the second, I
had a chance to break in the next game but
didn't. After that, I kind of lost my concentra
tion, and he started playing better," Flanagan
said.

Roy went up 4-3 in the third but Flanagan
refused to die. "At 3-4, coach [John]
Whitlinger and I decided that I should start
mixing up coming in and staying back. I
wouldn't serve-and-volley every time. I didn't
want to let him get in a groove. It seemed to
work well."
With the match in the bag, freshmen Chris
Cocotos and Patel moved up to play No. 1 dou
bles. But inconsistency plagued the duo as
Herdoiza and Payes took advantage of some
unforced errors and won the match 6-3, 6-4.
Dan Turbow and Billy Wright, playing
together for the first time, looked impressive
at No. 2 doubles as the senior-freshman combo
overpowered Occomy and Young 6-3, 6-2.
Stanford and Northwestern did not play the
No. 3 doubles match.
Stanford's No. 2 singles player, Jared
Palmer, did not play because of a sore shoulder.
With the win, Stanford improved its record
to 12-1 and now looks forward to its toughest
road trip of the season against UCLA Friday
and USC Saturday. "It's a huge road trip,"
Stark said. "We're ranked behind both of them
right now, and we especially want to beat USC
because we already have a loss to them. A suc
cessful road trip will be a big boost for us, def
initely."
