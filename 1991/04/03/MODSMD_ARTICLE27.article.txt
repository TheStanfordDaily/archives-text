# No NCAA titles doesn't mean no success
## 
### 
Chalk it up as a huge 'W' for Stanford ath
letics. There may not be any new NCAA
Champion trophies. No national cham
pionship rings on order. But it was an
extremely successful winter anyway for those
scholar-athletes known as The Cardinal.
"What's that?" you say. "How was it a tri
umphant quarter athletically? We're oh-for
the year. We've have no national champi
onships. There's no way we're going to reach
our average of four-a-year now!"
So what.
Lack of a title does not a failure make.
Far from it.
Collegiate athletic success can be measured
in more ways than the number of national
champion plaques piling up in the athletic
department.
An NIT championship, a NCAA semi-final
berth, two NCAA runner-up finishes and a
whole mess o' Pac-10 titles is a pretty fair
showing, I would say. A darned good showing,
actually.
Okay, so the NIT isn't the NCAA Final
Four. The winner is the best team after the 64
who were invited to compete in the NCAAs. All
televisions were tuned into CBS's complete
coverage of the 63 NCAA games (Did they
finally end?). And nobody cares (or knows)
who wins the tourney in the Big Apple.
Fine.
The tournament uses the same ball, the
same court and the same rules and regulations
as is utilized in the Other Tourney. There was
even the same ref throwing out Billy Tubbs in
Madison Square Garden and Dean Smith in
Indy.
It is a national tournament, with talented
squads, exciting players and (occasional) tele
vision coverage. And, as some of the players
pointed out, it's the fun of playing for a title
without the pressure of NCAAs.
Only two Division I teams ended the year
with post-season victories, and Stanford is one
of them.
If that isn't enough for you, Maples Pavil
ion now has a new fixture. A banner hanging
from the rafters, only the third national title of
either sex in Stanford basketball history. The
first men's championship banner to be put up
in 49 years\
So what if it wasn't an NCAA title. It was a
darned good achievement.
But it just wasn't good enough for some of
you.
While their counterparts were playing some

of the best basketball of their lives, the
women's basketball team battled its way back
to the NCAA Final Four.
Ranked 11th, seeded only second in the
West Regional and given little respect, the Car
dinal downed Cal-State Fullerton, annihilated
conference nemesis Washington and held off
top-seed Georgia to gain the right to defend its
championship crown in New Orleans.
This team , of course, did it all without last
season's Player of the Year Jennifer Azzi and
All-Pac-10 and All-Tournament forward Katy
Steding. The Cardinal then defeated the Lady
Dawgs without center Trisha Stevens, who
ruptured a tendon, and had starting forward
Julie Zielstra sidelined as well for the semi
final battle with Tennessee. And Stanford still
led for most of the game's first 30 minutes.
No, losing in the semi-finals is not the same
thing as scoring a second-straight NCAA
crown, but it's definitely deserving of a basket
full of accolades. Another great showing by a
Stanford squad.
The recognition, however, seemed to be
missing when Stanford students returned
from spring break this week.
For the second consecutive year the
women'B swim team touched in after Texas,
once again finishing second to the dominating
Longhorns at the national championships.
And while second is really nothing to sneer at,
the Cardinal's performance was first-rate in
itself.
Pacific 10 Champion Stanford stroked to
eight of the meets' 18 titles and had one of its
flock sprint away with Swimmer of the Year
honors. The Cardinal also happened to break
numerous records along the way.
Freshman Summer Sanders won three
events — the 200 individual medley, the 400
IM and the 200 butterfly — garnering Swim
mer of the Year accolades. Janet Evans
defended her 600 and 1,650 freestyle titles,
and Lori Heisick cruised to victory in the 100
breaststroke. Stanford also won two relays.

Sanders not only took the most individual
events of any swimmer in the country, she set
a new American record in the 200 IM and
broke the old NCAA marks in the 400 IM and
200 butterfly.
But second's just not good enough, huh?
The men's team emulated the women's
squad, also taking national runner-up honors
behind Texas. But once again, it's not the tro
phy, or lack thereof, that should really matter,
but the overall performance. And, like their
female counterparts, the men's showing was
impressive.
After winning only two dual meets the
entire season, Stanford swept through the
Pac-10 Championships, cruising to its 10th
consecutive title, a conference record. And
while nabbing only one individual event, the
Cardinal swam consistently and strongly
enough to lead Texas at the conclusion of the
swimming events, only to be eclipsed by a
Longhorn diver. (Unfortunately for the Cardi
nal it's still the swimming and diving champi
onships. . . .)
JefT Rouse not only submarined to victory
in the 100 backstroke, he also set a new Amer
ican record in the event during his leg of the
400 medley relay. Freshman Dereck Weather
ford then broke the American record in the
200 back.
But it doesn't really matter, because the
Cardinal was only second.
The wrestling team was another "loser,"
failing to capture a national, or even confer
ence crown. It "only" finished 32nd out of the
100-plus squads at NCAAs.
The fact that the sport was dropped from
the athletic department's payrolls, however,
doesn't matter, does it? The minor detail that
Stanford no longer has scholarships. Or a
coach's salary.
Oh yea, Steve Buddie and Steve Yarbrough
did take down Pac-10 individual titles, in the
167 and 177-pound classes. They were the first
Cardinal wrestlers to capture individual con
ference events since Jeff Bradley won the 134-
pound class in 1986. But who cares, right?
We're only talking about an all-conference
meet. No gold rings involved.
Too bad Stanford sports couldn't do any
thing right this winter.

Debbie Spander really doesn V care that it was
"only" an NIT victory. A national champi
onship is a national championship. So what if
it's the "ugly cousin" of the NCAAs.
