# 1991 NIT CHAMPS
## 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
T|he feeling began just moments before Stanford's first
round National Invitation Tournament win against
Houston, as the starting lineups were introduced.
"Starting at forward: a senior, number 30, Andrew
Vlahov!!" The deafening roar that signaled Vlahov's
return after a six-week absence turned into a two-week joyride
that led from Maples Pavilion to Wisconsin to Illinois and,
finally, to New York. From Madison, Wis., to Madison Square
Garden, the 1991 Cardinal won more postseason games than
all its predecessors combined — and it was one heck of a ride.

Bombing
the Badgers
MADISON, Wis., Mar. 18 -
The journey's first stop was Wis
consin, where 11,000 roaring
Cheeseheads, the World's Loudest
Band and a bombs-away Badger
team all greeted the Cardinal on a
cold Monday night. What the
hosts didn't know, however, was
that all the noise in the world
wasn't going to stop Adam Keefe.
Keefe had a career-high 33
points and also pulled down 14
rebounds (one short of his career
best) to lead Stanford to a surpris
ingly easy 80-72 win over the Bad
gers in the second-round game.
Keefe hit eight of his first nine
shots — thanks largely to a thor
oughly-confused Wisconsin
defense, which didn't seem to
have any clue where the ball was
going — to kick the Cardinal up to
a 26-9 lead. The Badgers, who
turned the ball over eight times in
the first eight minutes, never got
closer than the final score.
"Stanford is so tough," said
Wisconsin coach Steve Yoder after
his team finished the season at 15-
15. "They're very, very good, and
we just didn't measure up to their
standards."
Not at all. The Cardinal
crushed the Badgers on the
boards, 30-20, despite forward
Andrew Vlahov's sitting out most
of the first half with three fouls.
Badger center Patrick Tompkins
(the Big Ten's leading rebounder
at six-foot-five!) did manage to
pull down 12 boards, but that was
it.
The Badgers as a whole got
only four offensive rebounds the
entire night — not too great when
you consider they missed a com
bined 30 shots from the field and
foul line. Stanford, meanwhile,
was sizzling its way to a 28-for-51
(.549) performance, right on the
heels of a 30-for-50 (guess) mark
against Houston the previous
round.
"The last two games we've
played really well," said Stanford
coach Mike Montgomery, whose

team upped its record to 17-13.
"Probably as well as we've played
any two games back-to-back all
year."
Just about everyone got into
the act: Deshon Wingate had 11
points and eight boards; Kenny
Ammann had 14 points (5-for-7
from the floor); John Patrick had
eight assists — most of them to
Keefe; Paul Garrett, subbing for
Vlahov, put in 11 solid minutes;
and Marcus Lollie went 7-for-8
from the line in the closing min
utes to help hold off a mini-surge
by the Badgers.
"It was just one of those nights
when the offense was working like
clockwork," Keefe said. "We were
setting screens and passing the
ball to the right place at the right
time every time. It was great."
"I really sensed some excite
ment in everyone this week,"
Montgomery said. "We wanted to
be here, we were very aggressive
early on, and that was the key to
the game."
The Cardinal would need to
hold on to that excitement — to
take care of its finals, which would
be faxed and Fed-Exed back and
forth all week; to write all its
papers (two computers were
brought along); and to get ready
for its next game.
The word came at midnight
Wisconsin time: It was on to
Southern Illinois.
Shocking
the Salukis
CARBONDALE, 111., Mar. 21 -
A quick flight from Madison to St.
Louis, a 90-minute bus ride and a
two-day wait were up next, as the
Cardinal took its finals and tried
to prepare for the Southern Illi
nois Salukis, who came into the
game at 18-13 (10-2 at home).
In the two days of waiting, it
became perfectly clear that an
NIT quarterfinal game was the
biggest thing to happen in Car
bondale in quite a while: The win
ner would be headed to New York,
and the entire town rallied behind
SIU. Signs in stores, songs on the
radio, a packed, steaming 9000-
strong house that Thursday night
at the Arena. . .
No dice. Stanford led the entire

way against the Salukis — some
times just barely holding on to the
lead, but holding on nonetheless
— and finally pulled away in the
last six minutes for a 78-68 vic
tory — and a trip to Madison
Square Garden.
"We didn't want to end our
careers in friggin' Carbondale,"
said Vlahov, who hit seven of his
10 shots. "Our mission was to get
to New York. Mission accom
plished."
Keefe had 24 to again lead all
scorers (he broke the school sin
gle-season scoring record in the
process), but, just like three
nights earlier, everyone on the
floor contributed: Patrick had 12
points. Wingate poured in 16 (7-
for-10), and grabbed 11 rebounds.
Lollie handled the Saluki pressure
like it wasn't even there. And the
entire team harrassed SIU into
shooting a disastrous .378 (28-for
-74) from the field.
"This was our best team effort
of the year," Ammann said.
"Freaky (that would be Wingate,
for those of you who haven't been
paying attention all year) played
the best game, I think, of his
career."
"It seemed like every time we
were on the verge of collapse,
when we needed something, we
were able to make a bucket,"
Montgomery said.
The Cardinal had to, because
the Salukis (despite shooting like
the basket was six inches too
small), refused to go away. After
getting rid of most of Stanford's
11-point first-half lead — the Car
dinal hit eight of its first 10 shots
— SIU got it down to 41-39 with
16 minutes to go. A Keefe layup
got the lead up to four, but then
SlU's Chris Lowery hit a three to
make it 43-42.
The crowd went nuts. The
much, much-smaller Salukis were
controlling the boards, they were
on a 10-4 run, the momentum —
and the game? — were all theirs.
Then, after Ammann turned the
ball over, Lowery was left alone at
the top of the key. As he shot,
9000 people drew in their collec
tive breath, ready to explode. . . .
. . . and the ball clanged off the
front of the rim.
The Salukis got no closer, as
Stanford went on a 23-11 run
(capped by a beautiful no-look
pass from Lollie to Keefe for a
dunk) to make it 66-53. All over.
"They're a very, very good
team," said SIU guard Sterling
Mahan, who finished his career
with a 12-point effort. "We kept
getting close, but we could never
get over the hump."
The Cardinal, however, did —
and was on its way to New York.
"This is fantastic for us," Mont
gomery said. "This'll be a great
experience for the kids."
A reporter asked Keefe if he
was disappointed to be playing in
the NIT instead of the NCAA
tourney. "Right now?" Keefe
smiled. "This is the biggest thing
in my life."
Cinderella
takes a fall
NEW YORK, Mar. 25 - And it
would get bigger.
The NlT's Cinderella was next
for Stanford, as the Cardinal took
on Massachusetts in the semifi
nals. The Minutemen had won
three games on the road — by a
total of nine points — to get to the
Garden. Destiny's darlings?
Not against Stanford. The Car
dinal roared to a 24-8 lead and,
although UMass clawed, pounded,
scraped and bit its way back to
actually take the lead with five
minutes left in the game, the Car
dinal took the lead right back on a
three-pointer from Patrick. The
Minutemen got within one only
once the rest of the way and fell,
73-71.
"I thought our big men caused
them lots of problems," Mont
gomery said. "Our interior pass
ing, the big guys moving the ball,
has been getting better and better
all year."
The big guy doing most of that
passing was Vlahov, who racked
up eight assists to go along with
his 20 points and 11 rebounds —
just missing the chance to be the

first Stanford player in history to
record a triple-double. Keefe (sur
prise) led all scorers with 24, to go
along with his 10 rebounds.
Even more importantly, how
ever, Vlahov — who normally hits
65 percent of his free throws —
was 12-for-12 from the line. The
last two of those free throws came
with 5.7 seconds left, built the
lead to four and put the game out
of reach.
"The pressure down the
stretch didn't really faze me too

much, because we've
been in close games all
year," Vlahov said.
"Provided that all five
of us are on the same
wavelength we'll be all
right."
They all were at the
start of the game, as
they built that 24-8
lead. "Early in the
game I was thinking
'Uh-oh, it's gonna be
30,'" said UMass
coach John Calipari.
Keefe had eight points
in the early run, and
nothing the Minute
men did could slow
him down.
"I didn't know
what we were gonna
do," Calipari said "I
wanted to throw a
chair at him."
That probably
would have been ille
gal, so Calipari did the
next best thing: He
put zaftig (look it up)
reserve center John
Tate on Keefe — and
Keefe got only one
hoop the rest of the half

"Tate did a good job banging
me around," Keefe said. "He used
his fouls wisely — he usually got
me before I got the ball."
Tate's D, along with the unbe
lievable zoning of Rafer Giles, got
the Minutemen right back in the
game. Giles, a reserve guard aver
aging 9.8 ppg, had 13 in the last 10
minutes of the half to cut Stan
ford's lead to 35-31.
Keefe shook Tate off to score
eight of the Cardinal's first 11 in
the second half, and Stanford
built it back up to 54-45 with 12
minutes left. At that point, Keefe
had 22 and Stanford was in con
trol. . . . but Keefe would get only

one more hoop, the Minutemen
would march right back on Jim
McCoy's 13 second-half points,
and it would be up to Patrick and
Vlahov to save the game.
It was Patrick who hit the
three with five minutes left to put
the Cardinal up for good, and it
was Vlahov who grabbed an air
ball from Ammann and hit a layup
to make it 69-66 with only 40 sec
onds left. UMass had to foul, and
Stanford didn't miss.
"In the last two weeks, when

ever we've needed a play, we've
made it," Montgomery said.
"I think this is great," Keefe
added. "It seems things are just
falling into place."
Once every
49 years
NEW YORK, Mar. 27 - Two
days later, it all fell into place one
final time.
After a shaky end to the first
half — during which the Okla
homa Sooners went on a 13-0 run

to take a 39-35 lead — the Stan
ford team that had shone in the
NIT came back to life.
Screens were set perfectly.
Passes were made on time. The
Sooner press was broken with
ease, rebounds raced to Cardinal
hands, and the Stanford D held
Oklahoma 26 points below its sea
son scoring average.
And, when it was done, the
game, the NIT championship and
a lot of vindication all belonged to
Stanford, 78-72.
"I can't think of a better way to
go out," said Ammann, who was
5-for-10 beyond the three-point
line in ringing up 22 points. "This
is the way basketball should be."
Ammann made the all-tourna
ment team in his final games at
Stanford. Vlahov did the same.
Wingate, who had 13 huge boards,]
13 points and harassed the Sooner
forwards until they left the game!
snarling, should have.
Patrick, also in his last game,!
had 13 points to go along with his'
four assists. Lollie shredded the
Oklahoma press and completely!
shut down Sooner sharpshooter -
Brent Price in the second half.
And, of course, Keefe was.
named the NlT's Most Valuable
Player for his 23 points, 11 boards!
and 40 minutes each night — but,'
during the title game, he was just •
one of five players, working!!
together perfectly. " People have 1 ;
said all year that we're a one- >
player team, and tonight we
proved that's not true," he said. ■
"This was a complete, sound vie-'
torv and we couldn't be happier."
When Stanford fans look backj
on the 1990-91 men's basketball*
team, they'll think of a squad that
won more postseason games than 1
every other Stanford team in his
tory combined; they'll think of a
team that won more road games
in one 10-day stretch than it had
won all year; they'll remember a
senior forward who wanted to
play so badly he decided not even
surgery could keep him away. ... '
1
And, more than anything else,
they'll remember a team that
brought home its first national
title — of any kind — in almost ■
half a century. ,
"It's just very gratifying for the
kids," Montgomery said. "This is
something they'll never forget."
