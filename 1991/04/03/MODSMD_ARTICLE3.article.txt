# Junior testifies for student aid

When more than 200 students descended on the
Capitol two weeks ago, they cheered as 10 had the
chance to testify before a panel of legislators and pre
sent them with a list of ways to improve student
financial aid.
As Congress rewrites the Higher Education Act
later this year, organizers of (he student lobby hope
they may have exerted an important influence.
"I think we gave them an opinion which they
could not have found anywhere else," said junior
Brian Hooker, one of five Stanford students to go to
Congress and the only one to testify.
The hearing was arranged by the United States
Student Association, an educational lobby. The
group's legislative director, Selena Dong, felt that

j the personal testimony of Hooker
1 and the other students could help
achieve their primary goal: to
graphically illustrate the potential
— and the recent deterioration — of
federal financial aid.
As an example of the personal
importance of financial aid, Hooker
said in an interview yesterday,"I am
on a full minority scholarship. The
only way I could come here would be

on a full scholarship."
At the hearing, one student said he donated blood
for money to ease college expenses. Others said they
were forced to take out large private loans. He and
the others outlined, in front of a spirited audience,

proposals for strengthening and
reorganizing by the joint House
and Senate education subcommit
tees.
A total of $18 billion in student
loans and grants is dispensed
every year. Since the federal gov
ernment pays for over 80 percent
of those funds, the lobbying effort
could affect most aid applicants at
public and private colleges.
Hooker said he and the other stu
dents hoped to convince the mem
bers of Congress to protect that

sum, streamline the program and
make students aware it was avail
able.
The group had a series of goals.
Members want a higher rate of
direct grants, rather than loans,
for underprivileged students. In
1975, 80 percent of federal aid
was in the form of grants. That
number sank to 49 percent bv
1988.
The result is that more and
more loans traditionally reserved
for the middle class now go to the
poorest students. In this case, the
middle class would get the worst
of the deal — few federal loans
would be left for them, Hooker

said.
Meanwhile, the poorer stu
dents suffer disproportionately
from fees and taxes levied on the
aid itself. The student association
wants the government to elimi
nate the fees and provide tax-free
grants and loans. They also want
the aid applications simplified
and the programs more widely
publicized, Hooker said.
Government loans are often
dispensed by private banks which
serve as intermediaries and
charge fees of their own. Hooker
explained that direct loans from
the government would remove
much of the bureaucracy and

leave more money for the stu
dents.
Additionally, the lobby wants
to stop aid that is restricted by
links to selective-service registra
tion and other factors. One
female student testified that, for
some aid programs, women have
to prove each year that they do
not need to register for the draft.
College work-study programs
have also been problematic,
Hooker said. Some students have
been employed below minimum
wage through the program, orga
nizers say. Some are penalized
because of outside jobs when
applying for grants and loans.
