## Cystic fibrosis may be eased by calcium 
### Julie Makinen Staff writer 
Most people know that calcium
is important for maintaining
healthy teeth and bones. What
many aren't aware of, however, is
that calcium is also involved in a
host of other bodily functions.
Stanford researchers have
recently found that calcium, along
with one of its associated
enzymes, may hold the secret for
preventing some of the devastat
ing effects of cystic fibrosis.
Cystic fibrosis is an inherited
metabolic disorder which affects
the functioning of the body's
mucous tissues and sweat glands.
Most of the disease's complica
tions arise when mucous secre
tions in the respiratory and diges
tive tracts become abnormally
thick, sticky and concentrated.
When this happens, patients may
develop pneumonia, emphysema
and respiratory infections which
culminate in death.
The primary cause of cystic
fibrosis symptoms is the inability
of cells to properly release chloride
ions.

"Chloride regulates the degree
of hydration of the mucus,"
explained Dr. John Wagner, a post
doctoral fellow in medicine and
cell biology.
In the trachea, there is a layer
of airway tissues covered with
mucus. Normally, two enzymes
(protein kinase C and cyclic-AM P
dependent protein kinase) regu
late the release of chloride from
these tissues. When chloride is
released, salts and water travel
with it, moistening the mucus.
In cystic fibrosis patients, a
genetic defect interferes with the
action of normal cyclic-AMP
dependent protein kinase. Conse
quently, insufficient amounts of
chloride are released, and the
mucus dehydrates and thickens.
However, Wagner and his col
leagues have discovered a way to
restore proper chloride regulation
to cystic fibrosis-affected cells of
the airway
Wagner and Dr. Phyllis Gard
ner, associate professor of
medicine, have discovered that
the body has another enzyme
which can regulate chloride
release. This enzyme is called

multifunctional calcium/calmod
ulin-dependent protein kinase,
and the levels of this enzyme are
controlled by the calcium levels
inside of cells. Cystic fibrosis does
not seem to disrupt this enzyme
pathway.
If the level of calcium could be
raised in the airway tissues, the

calcium-dependent kinase could
be prompted to release chloride.
Wagner and Gardner stress
that this new finding is not a
treatment but, Gardner said, it
"provides direction as to where to
look next. This discovery suggests
that a molecular detour may exist
which would allow a bypass of the
cystic fibrosis defect."
