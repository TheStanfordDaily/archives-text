# What is cystic fibrosis?
## 
### 
Cystic fibrosis is a recessive
genetic disorder which disturbs
the functioning of the body's
mucous membranes and sweat
glands. It is the most common
inherited disorder among Cau
casians, affecting one out of
every 2,000; the disease rarely
afflicts people of African or
Asian descent.
Cystic fibrosis interferes
with the body's ability to moist
en the mucus which lines the
respiratory and gastrointesti
nal tracts.
In a patient's respiratory
tract, mucus may accumulate
in the lungs, blocking the
bronchi and making breathing
difficult. This buildup and
resulting blockage may lead to a
chronic cough, recurrent pneu-

monia, emphysema, respiratory
infection and lung disease.
In the digestive tract, accu
mulated mucus can interfere
with the passage of digestive
enzymes and block the absorp
tion of nutrients. This can lead
to malnutrition, which com
pounds the problems of the res
piratory tract.
Currently, there is no cure
for cystic fibrosis; doctors can
only treat the various symp
toms which develop. Treatment
may include prescriptions of
pancreatic enzyme supple
ments, various physical thera
pies to drain accumulated
mucus in the lungs, antibiotics
to fight lung infection and a
diet high in calories and pro
tein.
