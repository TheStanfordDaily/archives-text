# New Mac printers offer quality — for less
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Part of the success of Apple Computer dur
ing the past decade is due to the company's
steady stream of innovative, new products that
are cheaper than the products they replace.
The company's two new printers — the
Stylewriter and the Personal LaserWriter LS —
are two such devices. Both are priced under
$800, and they are likely to be quite popular. If
you're in the market for a personal printer for
the Mac, these new output devices are worth
serious consideration. Just be prepared to wait
a while before taking delivery.
For students, the $353 Stylewriter is likely
to be the most popular choice. Priced at just
$36 more than the venerable Imagewriter 11,
the Stylewriter provides near-laser quality text
output at a fraction of the cost.
The Stylewriter uses ink jet technology, a
method which sprays tiny droplets of ink on
the page to form characters and graphics. With
a resolution of 360 dots per inch, the Stylewrit
er actually puts down more individual dots
than most laser printers. Since ink runs,
though, the printout is not as precise as the
toner-based printouts produced by lasers.
Furthermore, ink, being wet, cannot be
printed in large dense regions. If you fill a
three-inch circle with black and print it, pre
pare to let the page dry for a while.
You should also consider getting cotton
bond paper, which produces much better
results with ink jet printers. While the
Hewlett-Packard Deskwriter, a popular Mac
ink jet that costs twice as much as the
Stylewriter, can handle xerographic papers,
Apple's latest needs cotton bond to shine.

With the right paper, text
quality is truly superb thanks to
TrueType, the new font-scaling
technology that will be built
into System 7.0. If you're fed up
with the little jaggies on output
from your I mage writer, you'll
no doubt love the Stylewriter's
crisp letterforms. And as the
type gets larger, the characters
look better and better.
The Stylewriter is not, how-

ever, known as the "Swift writer," and with
good reason. In best-quality mode, it's about as
quick as the Imagewriter. But in its "faster"
mode (the Stylewriter has no draft mode), it
can't keep up with it's dot-matrix predecessor.
Nor, for that matter, can it keep up with the
Deskwriter, which is more than twice as fast.
Still, for the price, the Stylewriter will rele
gate the Imagewriter to special-purpose pur
chases only. If you need to print multi-part
forms (those with carbons), or if you have to
have tractor-fed paper, then the Imagewriter is
the way to go. If you want high-quality text, a
compact package and a very quiet printer, the
Stylewriter is a nice low-cost option.
Those with $776 to drop at Microdisc should
seriously consider the LaserWriter LS. Far and
away the cheapest laser ever offered by Apple,
it is also one of the least expensive laser print
ers sold by anyone, any where.
The LS also includes TrueType and the
same high-quality Canon engine found in
countless personal laser printers. It will print
text as nicely as most $6,000 machines.
What the LS lacks is networkability and
Postscript. In an office environment, the baby
laser is not the ideal choice because it cannot be

shared between two or more
computers. For the single user,
however, the LS provides rela
tively speedy output of text
filled pages. It slows down a
great deal with graphics
because it has no internal pro
cessor.
Most laser printers, you see,
have built-in computers which
generate the page image. Your
Macintosh simply sends a series

muviiii'voii ollllp tjviiuo u uv/i tuo
of commands to the printer and it does the
dirty work of figuring out which dots go where.
The LS and Stylewriter (and, of course, the
Imagewriter) rely on the Mac to tell it where to
put down toner or ink.
That means that speedier Macs will print
more quickly than slower ones and, if your
Mac doesn't have enough memory, some pages
won't print at all. Memory being cheap these
days, LS and Stylewriter owners might want
to consider moving up to two or more
megabytes.
Because the LS does not come with
Postscript, it won't work with some high-end
graphics programs like Adobe Illustrator. It
also won't work with the thousands of existing
Postscript fonts. But most graphics and page
layout software will print just fine on the LS
and all major type vendors have committed to
making fonts available in TrueType.
Clearly, the availability of laser technology
at such a low price is a major boon to con
sumers. Combined with the low-cost Macs, it
further demonstrates Apple's willingness to
provide high-end equipment at reasonable
prices. Now, if only they'd make the upgrade
from an SE to an SE/30 more affordable . . .
