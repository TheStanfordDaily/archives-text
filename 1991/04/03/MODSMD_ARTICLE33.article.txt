# Catalytic converters, cats catch Bugs' eyes

Q, My car has a "catalytic con
• verier." I know it has some
tmng to do with reducing exhaust
emissions, but I don't really know
what it is or how it works. Can
you help me?
A .Sure. Many technical im
• provements have been made
in automobile engines since the
late '60s and early '70s, when we
started to realize that we were
choking ourselves to death. The
improvements can be arbitrarily
divided into three categories:
• Things done before fuel is
burned,
• Things done while fuel is
burning, and
• Things done after fuel is
burned.
Catalytic converters fall into
the third category: They process
exhaust gases after they leave the
combustion chamber, but before
they hit the tailpipe.
A catalytic converter is com
posed of a ceramic catalyst and all
the hardware necessary to insure
that exhaust gases pass thor
oughly and evenly through the
catalyst.
The catalyst itself is a sub
stance that accelerates the rate at
which a chemical reaction occurs.
An oxidation catalyst causes the
carbon monoxide and hydrocar
bons which result from incom
plete combustion to be converted
to carbon dioxide and water.
More sophisticated systems
also include a catalyst that can
bring about chemical changes in
the nitrogen-containing compo
nents of exhaust emissions.
Converters now in use contain
noble metals — usually platinum,
palladium or rhodium — adsorbed
onto small, very porous, ceramic
pellets made from an aluminum
containing compound. The aver
age converter uses about 0.05 troy
ounce of platinum, which is worth
about $20.
While today's catalytic convert
ers require the use of essentially
lead-free gasoline, an occasional
tank-full of leaded gasoline is not
a catastrophic occurrence. The
deactivating effect of a single dose
of lead will be temporary, since
resumed running on unleaded
gasoline will vaporize the lead and
send it spewing safely from the
tailpipe.
Q, Why do cats purr ?
A .Why do bees bumble? They
•just do! Of course, this is

just a sarcastic way of saying that
we Bugs don't know either. Bill
Kliban has some great sketches of
the "purr-box" residing in the
necks of cats, with pitch and vol
ume knobs, but this highly infor
mative anatomical drawing fails
to show the true meaning behind
purring.
Much research has gone into
studying cat behavior, and the sci
entists who performed these stud
ies concluded that cats do indeed
purr. (We wonder where they
spent the remaining $149,999
worth of their grant money.) For
tunately, they also determined
that cats purr when they are
happy ($149,998 remaining). Fur
thermore, most members of the
cat family purr, and even lions and
leopards make a low, gurgling
sound that resembles a purr
($130,000 left).
The scientists' conclusions
were worth about $125,000.
Purring seems to be a signal given
by suckling kittens to tell their
mother that all is well. Purring
works well for this function, as it
does not require that the kittens
open their mouths while nursing.
Purring, as the researchers
were quick to uncover, persists
into adulthood. In mature cats,
purring is used to convey one of
four basic meanings to other cats:
• Reassuring the young. A
mama cat purrs as she approaches
her kittens and continues during
nursing, creating a great feeling of
security.
• Soliciting play. A young cat
often purrs as it nears an adult
with which it wants to play.
• Reassuring an inferior. A
cat that is dominant in the social
hierarchy often purrs as it
approaches an inferior or younger
cat, especially when the dominant
cat is in a friendly, non-aggressive
mood.
• Appeasing a superior. An
inferior, sick or weakened cat fre
quently purrs when confronted by
a threatening cat.
