Palmer to deliver Jordan lecture
Jeffrey Palmer, associate professor of biology
at Indiana University, will give the ninth annual
David Starr Jordan Memorial Lecture at 5 p.m.
tomorrow in the Medical Center's Fairchild
Auditorium.
His topic will be "Eubacterial Inheritance of
Eukaryotic Cells: Genomes, Genes and Introns."
After the talk, University President Donald
Kennedy will present the 1990 David Starr Jor
dan Award to Palmer. The prize was created by
Stanford, Cornell and Indiana universities in
memory of Jordan, the scientist who served as
Stanford's first president.
The Jordan Award, which is international in
scope, is presented every two or three years to a
young scientist who is making innovative contri
butions to the fields of evolution, ecology, popu
lation biology or organismal biology.
Palmer is most renowned for his contribu
tions to molecular plant evolutionary biology,
and is the world's leading authority on the struc
ture and evolution of the chloroplast genome.
Genentech to test AIDS vaccine
*
Human clinical trials of an AIDS vaccine
developed by a Bay Area research firm will soon
begin at the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases. The vaccine — which is
related to gpl2o, a protein found in HIV — was
produced by Genentech, Inc., of South San
Francisco.
Last June, Genentech reported in the journal
"Nature" that its gpl2o vaccine protected two
chimpanzees from infection with HIV The suc
cess in non-human primates prompted the com
pany to launch the first human clinical trial of
the drug in November 1990. Unlike the upcom
ing study, the initial trial was conducted in a
small number of HIV-positive patients. Its pur
pose was to determine whether the vaccine could
extend the latency period of the AIDS virus.
