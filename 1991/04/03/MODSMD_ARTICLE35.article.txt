# Hunters a major force in wildlife maintenance
## 
### Nancy Volkers Staff writer 
Dave Constantino has been hunting for 30 years.
He may search for deer or duck, but to him, the ulti
mate find is tranquility.
Constantino enjoys the opportunity that hunting
gives him to experience the beauty of the mountains,
the warmth of the sun unobscured by smog and the
air unpolluted by the harsh sounds of rush-hour
traffic.
"The ultimate goal in hunting isn't to go out and
kill something," says Constantino, a member of the
Burlingame-based Golden Ram Sportsman's Club.
"If I go out for a weekend hunting and don't even see
anything, that doesn't ruin my weekend at all."
Though many hunters may not share Con
stantino's view, every hunter must contribute to the
maintenance of wildlife. Hunters' licensing fees and
taxes fund fish and game agencies in all 50 states.
These agencies acquire and manage wild lands, relo
cate animals and protect habitats.
"Hunters are really the ones that primarily sup
port wildlife," Constantino said, "and I think the
public doesn't realize that."
Since the turn of the century, hunting has col
lected more than $5 billion in taxes and fees for con
servation, according to the National Shooting Sport
Foundation.
The passage of the Pittman-Robertson Act in
1937 resulted in a federal tax on hunting licenses
and guns. According to the Sportsmen's Council of
Northern California, the act will give state wildlife
agencies $800 million this year — 80 percent of their
combined annual budgets.
Pittman-Robertson funds have been used to pur
chase over 4 million acres of habitat, establish gun
safety instruction nationwide and undertake such
projects as animal relocation, habitat reconstruction
and the construction of access roads into wild lands.
Money raised by the act's tax has also been used to
fund $1.7 billion in wildlife research.
In 1950, Congress passed the Dingell-Johnsori
Act, which gave state agencies funds from a 10 per

cent tax on certain fishing tackle. Since its passage,
the act has brought these agencies $500 million to be
used for fish restoration and management projects.
In 1984, Congress enlarged funding sources, provid
ing an additional $80 million a year for such projects.
Besides the state fish and game agencies, many
organizations — such as the Sheep Foundation and
Ducks Unlimited — have been founded to protect
particular animals. The Sheep Foundation raised
$75,000 one year by sponsoring a hunt (by bid) for
bighorn sheep. The foundation was started by two
hunters who contributed $2 million to set up the
institution.
Although hunters bear the brunt of supporting
national wildlife management through taxes and
fees, the practice of hunting is not universally con
doned: In California last year, an attempt was made
to prohibit hunting altogether. Although that didn't
occur, legislators did pass Proposition 117, a law that
bans mountain lion trophy hunting
Nick Tacito, president of the Golden Ram Sports
man's Club, said that the failure of the attempted
ban on hunting proves a point about the depth of the
issue.
"The big question that was thrown back [to pro
ponents of the overall ban] was, well fine, you stop
hunting. Who's going to take care of all the land and

donate all the money? Where's that going to come
from if we stop hunting?
"Well, they didn't have an answer."
Opponents of hunting cite both ecological and
emotional reasons for their view. Some feel hunters
upset the natural balance; others feel hunting is sim
ply inhumane.
Regulated recreational hunting has never elimi
nated or endangered a single wildlife species, how
ever, according to the Sportsmen's Council of North
ern California (SCNC). The historic slaughters of
the passenger pigeon, bison and sea otter involved
mainly market hunters.
In fact, sport hunters overwhelmingly supported
the early restrictions on commercial hunting, per
haps to try and increase the distance between the
two camps.
But many erroneously equate the hunter out to
kill a buck with the hunter out to make one.
Though sport hunting has not endangered
wildlife, the destruction of habitats has. Clear-cut
ting forests, draining marshes and polluting all
reduce wildlife habitat. With less space, animals
have less food and less shelter.
By reducing the habitat, humans also force the
reduction of a species' carrying capacity; that is, how
many animals can comfortably live in an area.
Destruction of habitat leads to unneeded animal
death and endangerment.
Regulated hunting crops wild populations to just
under their carrying capacity, which, according to
the SCNC, produces a population better suited to
breeding and feeding than a population at or above
its carrying capacity.
While some opponents of hunting concentrate on
the broad ecological issues, others feel that killing is
simply cruel and should not be done, especially for
sport.
But hunting advocates emphasize that it is impor
tant to remember that hunters have poured more
money into wildlife management than any other
group, and continue to be actively involved in
improving America's environment.

ing an additional $80 million a year for such projects.
Besides the state fish and game agencies, many
organizations — such as the Sheep Foundation and
Ducks Unlimited — have been founded to protect
particular animals. The Sheep Foundation raised
$75,000 one year by sponsoring a hunt (by bid) for
bighorn sheep. The foundation was started by two
hunters who contributed $2 million to set up the
institution.
Although hunters bear the brunt of supporting
national wildlife management through taxes and
fees, the practice of hunting is not universally con
doned: In California last year, an attempt was made
to prohibit hunting altogether. Although that didn't
occur, legislators did pass Proposition 117, a law that
bans mountain lion trophy hunting
Nick Tacito, president of the Golden Ram Sports
man's Club, said that the failure of the attempted
ban on hunting proves a point about the depth of the
issue.
"The big question that was thrown back [to pro
ponents of the overall ban] was, well fine, you stop
hunting. Who's going to take care of all the land and

donate all the money? Where's that going to come
from if we stop hunting?
"Well, they didn't have an answer."
Opponents of hunting cite both ecological and
emotional reasons for their view. Some feel hunters
upset the natural balance; others feel hunting is sim
ply inhumane.
Regulated recreational hunting has never elimi
nated or endangered a single wildlife species, how
ever, according to the Sportsmen's Council of North
ern California (SCNC). The historic slaughters of
the passenger pigeon, bison and sea otter involved
mainly market hunters.
In fact, sport hunters overwhelmingly supported
the early restrictions on commercial hunting, per
haps to try and increase the distance between the
two camps.
But many erroneously equate the hunter out to
kill a buck with the hunter out to make one.
Though sport hunting has not endangered
wildlife, the destruction of habitats has. Clear-cut
ting forests, draining marshes and polluting all
reduce wildlife habitat. With less space, animals
have less food and less shelter.
By reducing the habitat, humans also force the
reduction of a species' carrying capacity; that is, how
many animals can comfortably live in an area.
Destruction of habitat leads to unneeded animal
death and endangerment.
Regulated hunting crops wild populations to just
under their carrying capacity, which, according to
the SCNC, produces a population better suited to
breeding and feeding than a population at or above
its carrying capacity.
While some opponents of hunting concentrate on
the broad ecological issues, others feel that killing is
simply cruel and should not be done, especially for
sport.
But hunting advocates emphasize that it is impor
tant to remember that hunters have poured more
money into wildlife management than any other
group, and continue to be actively involved in
improving America's environment.
