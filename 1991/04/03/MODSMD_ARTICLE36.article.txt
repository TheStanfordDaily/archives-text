# Latvian official talks at Hoover
## 
### Joanna Sosinska Staff writer 
In a Hoover Institution speech
yesterday afternoon, Latvian For
eign Minister Janis Jurkans
stressed the importance of West
ern support for the political and
economic struggle of the Baltic
states to regain their indepen
dence.
Jurkans was appointed foreign
minister last May after the newly
elected Latvian legislature
declared the republic's indepen
dence from the Soviet Union. Dur
ing the previous two years,
Jurkans was a key member of the
Popular Front of Latvia, which
spearheaded the independence
campaign and currently holds a
majority of the seats in the legisla
ture.
He emphasized that the
restoration of Latvia's indepen
dence depends on three factors:
the unity of the people in Latvia,
backing from democratic forces in
the Soviet Union and Western
support.

"The Soviet Union today can
not ignore Western help," he said.
"By helping the Baits, [Western
ers] are helping the democratic
process of the Soviet Union."
Since assuming office, Jurkans
has traveled extensively in Europe
and North America presenting
foreign governments with
Latvia's "shopping list" of inter
ests. His meeting with President
Bush last July marked the first
time a Latvian government offi
cial has ever been received at the
White House.
Almost 50 years after Stalin
seized the Baltic states of Latvia,
Lithuania and Estonia and incor
porated them into the Soviet
Union, all three republics have
declared independence in an effort
to achieve national and interna
tional recognition as sovereign
states.
"During the period of the
Soviet occupation, 1940 to the pre
sent, several generations have
been maimed and tortured in the
futile building of the socialist and
communist system that brought

[Latvia! to political and economic
decay," Jurkans said.
In an effort to restore Latvian
nationalism and halt the eco
nomic decline, the Latvian
Supreme Council proposed a dec
laration of independence last May.
"The declaration opened the gates
to a transitional period of negoti
ating and working out concrete
steps to solve the differences with
the Soviet Union," Jurkans said.
However, the struggle for inde
pendence faces conservative Com
munist opposition, Jurkans said.
Under extreme pressures from
the army, the KGB and the Soviet
Parliament, Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev has been
forced to take military steps
against the Latvian independence
movement.
"Russia's government realizes
the inevitability of the breakup of
the existing unions," Jurkans
said, explaining that the recent
bloodshed in the Baltic republics
is not an attack on the states
themselves, but rather an attack
on democracy.
