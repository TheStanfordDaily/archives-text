# School, hospital try to reclaim lost tax funds
## 
### Peter Cousins Staff writer 
The University and Stanford Hospital
claim they have lost more than $2 million
because their payroll-tax service firm failed
to correctly pay their taxes according to its
contract.
On March 19, the University and the
hospital filed a joint breach-of-contract law
suit against Hamilton Taft and Co., a San
Francisco-based payroll-tax service firm,
for the company's failure to pay taxes and
resulting late-payment fines.
However, Stanford's attempt to recover
the lost tax funds has been temporarily
thwarted because Hamilton Taft has filed
for bankruptcy. The petition for
bankruptcy was heard in court March 26,
one week after the lawsuit was filed.
Hamilton Taft was contracted by the
hospital and the University to process
employee withholding taxes and to pay the
appropriate amounts to the various govern
ment agencies. Stanford gave the company
money to pay the taxes.
Withholding taxes are the portions of an
employee's wages that are taken by the
employer and given to the government to

pay income and social security taxes.
The company was also employed by Fed
eral Express, Tandem Computers and
Neiman-Marcus, which have also filed law
suits.
Senior University Counsel Susan
Hoerger said the University recently
incurred late-payment penalties when
Hamilton Taft did not pay the Internal Rev
enue Service. Although the firm had paid
the IRS for previous late-payment penal
ties, the University last month received a
bill for almost $297,000 as a penalty for
taxes which Hamilton Taft had still not
paid.
The hospital is suing to recover about
$1.7 million in employee withholding taxes
which the firm apparently did not pay
Although the University has contracted
with Hamilton Taft since 1982 and the hos
pital has done business with the firm since
1983, only tax payments and penalties
accrued since last July are in question,
Hoerger said.
Hamilton Taft's bankruptcy claim will
postpone the suit against the firm until its
bankruptcy is resolved. "There was an
automatic stay of all civil litiga
tion as of the filing of the petition
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy,"
Hoerger said.
In response to a motion by
Stanford and other parties, a
court appointed a trustee to
determine whether Hamilton
Taft's assets are sufficient to
meet its liabilities, Hoerger said.

The University claims the con
tract obliged Hamilton Taft to pay
taxes when due, but Hamilton
Taft claims the firm had the right
to defer payment so long as it paid
any penalties.
Edward Donahue, attorney for
Hamilton Taft, called the dispute
a disagreement over "whether
Hamilton Taft had the right to
defer the payment of taxes."
While University officials assert
that the delayed payment consti
tutes a breach of contract, Don
ahue said Hamilton Taft believes

it acted within the terms of the
agreement.
"There has been a lot of misun
derstanding," he said. "We don't
know if [the potential misinter
pretation of the contract] was an
innocent mistake by Stanford or
not," he said, adding that it is pos
sible the University decided after
the filing of the lawsuit to inter
pret the contract in a manner
supportive of its legal position.
"We're hopeful that once the
trustee completes his investiga
tion we can come up with a solu

tion that solves this litigation,"
Donahue said. He outlined two
possible scenarios that could
occur once the bankruptcy nears
resolution.
The trustee may decide to liq
uidate Hamilton Taft's assets to
pay off its liabilities, including
those owed to the University, he
said. The company would then
cease to exist, he explained.
However, Donahue said that he
thought it would be in the best

interest of the University and
other former Hamilton Taft
clients to negotiate a settlement
which leaves Hamilton Taft as a
solvent firm. "The best case sce
nario would be that after the
trustee lays the facts on the table
Hamilton Taft can continue to
exist as a going concern."
Donahue added that he hoped
in the latter case the University
would consider returning to
Hamilton Taft for payroll tax ser
vices.
