# School, hospital try to reclaim lost tax funds
## 
### Peter Cousins Staff writer 
The University and Stanford Hospital
claim they have lost more than $2 million
because their payroll-tax service firm failed
to correctly pay their taxes according to its
contract.
On March 19, the University and the
hospital filed a joint breach-of-contract law
suit against Hamilton Taft and Co., a San
Francisco-based payroll-tax service firm,
for the company's failure to pay taxes and
resulting late-payment fines.
However, Stanford's attempt to recover
the lost tax funds has been temporarily
thwarted because Hamilton Taft has filed
for bankruptcy. The petition for
bankruptcy was heard in court March 26,
one week after the lawsuit was filed.

Neiman-Marcus, which have also filed law
suits.

incurred late-payment penalties when
Hamilton Taft did not pay the Internal Rev

the IRS for previous late-payment penal
ties, the University last month received a
bill for almost $297,000 as a penalty for
taxes which Hamilton Taft had still not
paid.
The hospital is suing to recover about
$1.7 million in employee withholding taxes
which the firm apparently did not pay
Although the University has contracted
with Hamilton Taft since 1982 and the hos

1983, only tax payments and penalties
accrued since last July are in question,
Hoerger said.

postpone the suit against the firm until its
bankruptcy is resolved. "There was an
