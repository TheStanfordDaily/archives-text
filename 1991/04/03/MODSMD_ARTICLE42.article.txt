# CHINATOWN
## 
### Mike Laris 
Images in San Francisco's Chin â–  vn
range the political and economic spe m
from Hong Kong to the mainland.
At dozens of street corners, very old 1-
nese women sell naked pictures of y
young Chinese women. America is the d
of opportunity, locals say. In the Pe 's
Republic, people are arrested for less.
Down the street, as in Hong K s
downtown shopping district, came, s,
stereos and video equipment are peu ed
from glittering, mirrored stores. Some j o
ple ask if consumer electronics are harming
Chinatown as a cultural sanctuary. "Is a : r
tune cookie really more Chinese?" is a c<>
mon rebuttal.
In an alley next to Louies Dim Sum,
women rummage through the garbage for
cabbage and cans. A blond-haired child is
urged by his mother to go give the women
his empty can. Broad smiles, but only for a
moment.
Bright lights and Chinese-language pop
music shower the entrance to China
Golden Book Store. Downstairs to the real
entrance. Rorce T.K. Lo changes the video
disk and compact disk every few minutes
He rearranges the overseas Chinese videos.
His top-rented video? Action films starring
Chow Yun Fat as "maybe a bad guy" who
lives in a "freaky society." Chow has starred
in parts one, two and three of "A Better
Tomorrow."
Chinese language comics and romance
have subtitles on the cover to give the fla
vor. "The Bible for Stylish Lovers" is for
teenagers, says Lo. "Maybe I can see it too
but just for fun."
Magazines about politics are on a small
shelf. One pictures brightly lit Beijing over
passes with citizens milling around tanks
and armored personnel earners. There is a
Chinese edition of U.S. News and World
Report. Another magazine's cover has a car
toon of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping cry
ing on his knees as Marx's right arm is being
torn off.
And at the ABC Bakery, on the way out
of town, there are Santa Claus sugar cookies
in the window. These could go well with a
can of Victorious Elephant Coconut Fla
vored Grass Jelly drink, found a few doors
down.



A San Francisco trolley rolls
through Chinatown, blending
the best of the East and
West.
