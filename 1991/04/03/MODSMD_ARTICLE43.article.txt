# How's that for a spring chicken?

### 
Stella Kung seizes a Chinese
* /§ silky chicken from its cage as
matter-of-factly as she would
JL. grab one of her shoes in the
morning. She passes the plump bird,
named for its white, furry feathers, to an
anxious customer who squeezes it, check
ing its body for health and thickness.
Good enough. They place the chicken,
head first, into a brown paper bag with
holes punched through for air and staple
the top three times.
As a chicken merchant at one of China
town's two birds-for-dinner shops, Kung
sells more than 150 silky chickens, red
chickens, pigeons, partridges, quail and
pheasant each day. She and her husband
Minton have sold fowl from the back of a
truck in San Francisco for 20 years and
finally opened a store on Grant Ave. last
year.
"Three thousand years ago, only a king
can eat this kind of chicken," Kung said
through a window in the glass barrier that
keeps renegade birds from making a free
dom flight.
Ming Kee Game Birds sees a steady
stream of Chinese-speaking regulars, hit
ting rush hour at about 5 p.m. with cus
tomers making the last stop on their din
ner-time ingredients list. They leave carry

ing pink and white plastic bags of cabbage,
onions and pheasant.
Customers say the birds taste sweeter
than store-bought meat, and many faces
reflect regal, decadent excitement as buyers
make their picks. Most are cooking for their
own families, Kung said. Although restau
rant owners come in, they are usually on
personal business.
"If they kill them and clean them for
selves, that's OK," she said. "Its not worth
for the customers."
Ray Tan, a nee and noodle cook who
immigrated from Canton three years ago,
described the preparation process with a
brown paper bag dangling at his side.
"Cut chicken." He slides his finger across
his throat. "Let the blood go out."
Dip head in boiling water. Dip feet in
boiling water. Begin peeling back rough
skin. "This is hard to take it off."
"Then use knife to cut the stomach."
Remove byproducts. Keep the heart.
Remove feathers. "Wash it 'til clean. Cut
in four pieces."
Steam the meat in a clay pot with
chopped Ginseng, a Chinese root that will
fortify your body and make you virile, he
said. It costs about $20 an ounce and is
sold in herb and jewelry stores. It's power
ful and must be used with caution, he said.

And, he added, don't eat it when you are sick or you will get much
worse.
Self-butchered meat and mystical roots jar images of Asia. Ven
dors on Taipei's Snake Alley slit snake's throats and drip the warm
blood into shot glasses to enhance male potency. And on winter
afternoons in Hangzhou, hungry, smiling women walk briskly with
puppies in hand.
But rudely (or thankfully) San Francisco squeezes back into the
picture. A local kid, Paul McCarthy, speaking between terrorist
water attacks on cable car tourists, says he saw a bus driver prevent
a woman from traveling with her live chicken. No animals, the bus
driver said.
But this culture clash was short-lived.
"She got off. She took a knife and went 'Guhh.' She just stabbed
it. I just saw it come back on the bus dead," said the 14-year-old.
She also said she gets her share of vegetarian visitors.
" 'Aweee. You eat that?'" they say.
Her response, "Yea. We raise them for food."
And although animal lovers probably shudder, naturalists have
nothing to fear. According to Kung, "All the birds, no chemical.
Regular food."
But there's a good chance not all of Kung's birds are free of for
eign substances. According to Kung, one Stanford student walked
into her shop last year and picked a plump, strong, Chinese silky
chicken. Kung stapled the bag and handed it over. But, she said, the
student wanted more than freshness. Within minutes, the silky
chicken landed in a Stanford laboratory for an experiment. So
much for sweet flavor.
