April Pearson — Daily
Senior Amy Rosenfeld and
tour guide Sean Dexter stand
up straight — in different
directions.
After mentally noting how tall they are in relation to each other
the two switch places, only to discover that the person who was
taller only seconds before is now noticeably shorter. "1 got shorter
all of a sudden," one woman cried.
This first demonstration takes place just inside the perimeter of
the Mystery Spot, where the force is the weakest. But as the group
starts up a very steep hill toward the center of the circle, the feeling
that something is not quite right intensifies.
"Inside the mystery spot we start leaning," explains the guide,
UC-Santa Cruz student Sean Dexter. And he is right. At the center
of the spot stands a little house, built at an angle on the hillside so
that it leans to the left. But Dexter and the rest of the people who
venture into the area lean to the right.
"We all lean. Everybody leans at the Mystery Spot," Dexter says
ominously
The Mystery Spot was first discovered in 1937 when some sur
veyors who were planning to build a summer home discovered that
their compasses didn't work within a small area of the hillside. Soon
they noticed that everything, including themselves, was leaning.

Even the trees grew twisted and crooked inside the spot.
In the half century since its discovery, hundreds of experts —
including physicists from Stanford, UC-Santa Cruz and even
Moscow University — have tried to explain the unseen force which
causes everything to lean toward the southwest. But none, not even
scientists from Lockheed with advanced laser technology, have been
able to determine conclusively what is causing this phenomenon.
There have been plenty of guesses, though.
One of the major theories advanced as to the secret of the Mys
tery Spot is that there is a meteorite buried under the ground which
is skewing the forces of gravity. This theory relies on an idea
advanced by Albert Einstein that forces of magnetism and gravity
can combine to change light waves.
A second theory posits that there is carbon dioxide gas seeping
out of the ground which creates a boundary of refraction causing
objects to look like they are leaning, similar to the effect of placing
a pencil in a glass of water.
Our guide was a bit skeptical about both theories, noting that
holes dug in the ground around the area have turned up no evi
dence of a meteor. Further, he said, if the wind blew, it would shift
any gas outside of the spot. Yet, the boundaries of the spot never
change.

o
And neither theory explains the effect the spot had on a group of
students from the Berkeley School for the Blind.
"They got really weirded out," Dexter said, explaining that
the students felt "funny" and during the experiments with the
i concrete blocks, they literally felt shorter on one side than the

other. "So it's not just optical," he concluded

Even the most skeptical visitors to the spot get at least
slightly "weirded out" as the mystery intensifies inside the
crooked little house which stands at the center of the cir
cle.

A golf ball placed on a board which is leaning at

a 40-degree angle out one window rolls up and off the

"higher" end of the board. A person hanging from a

handle in the doorway hangs at a different angle than

the person standing right next to him. And an 18-

pound weight hung from the ceiling feels 10 pounds

lighter if pushed in the direction of the force

Most visitors come to the Mystery Spot skeptical, Dexter said,
but very few leave unconvinced that there is indeed something

weird going on in the Santa Cruz Mountains.
Margo Petrencsik, who came all the way from Pennsylvania with
her family to check out the place she'd heard about as a kid, said
she was "a little skeptical" at first. "But there's got to be something
here. It's not man-made — it's natural. That's what it is."
If you're feeling a little out of sorts after you leave the Mystery
Spot, about a mile down Ocean Street on the way back to Highway
17 is the perfect cure: Marianne's ice cream shop. Home to Mari
anne's 71 original flavors of scrumptious ice cream, sherbet and
frozen yogurt (including Babe Ruth and Banana & Friends), the
store is an ice-cream lover's paradise.
To reach the Santa Cruz Mystery Spot, take 280 south to High
way 17. Get off at the Ocean Street exit in Santa Cruz, turn left at
the third traffic light (Water St.), make another quick left onto Mar
ket Street and follow the signs to the spot (about 3 miles). Mari
anne's is located at 1020 Ocean Street in Santa Cruz.

Amy Rosen/eld is a senior majoring in International Relations. She
spends her weekends at tourist spots, hoping to get a job from one of them
