m inding witches in the Bay Area is pretty simple. Finding someone
EJ who is willing to be called a witch is another matter. Of course,
m considering the bad press they've been getting for the past 400
years, that's not too surprising. — — -
"When you say 'witch/ people immediately think I'm going to kill their children
and drink their cat's blood," said Susan Levitt, a tarot expert and author who con
ducts classes in "Goddess Religion and Ritual Magick" at Bay Area bookstores.
Another woman, who asked to remain anonymous, commented, "I really prefer
calling [witchcraft] 'spirituality and the goddess' or even 'women's understanding
of nature.'"

Such is the current jargon of the Bay Area witchcraft scene. Now that we know
to vocabulary for the subject, let's get a few more things straight.
We're not talking about black cats.
Nobody zips around on broomsticks.
And no one I talked to cackled. Not even once.
This sort of Halloween spookiness, the professionals insisted, is simply not
witchcraft. In fact, depending on who you ask or what books you read, witchcraft
is basically just any number of variations upon an ancient theme of Pagan ritual
and worship that stretches back over thousands of years.
With roots that reach into the beliefs of a host of cultures — including ancient
Greece and Egypt, the Celts, the Norse and even some Native American tribes —
the "celebration of the goddess" forms the basis of most contemporary witchcraft
and Paganism. And almost everyone agrees that whatever you choose to call it,
it's undergoing quite a renaissance.
