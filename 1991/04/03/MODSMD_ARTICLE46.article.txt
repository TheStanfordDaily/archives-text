The basis for modern witchcraft grew
out of the feminist movement of the '60s
and '70s. But instead of seeking simply to
meet women's political needs, witchcraft
and Paganism became outlets "for a trans
formation of the level of spirit," said Levitt.
The first feminist witch's organization,
the Susan B. Anthony Coven #1, was
founded by noted Bay-Area practitioner
Zsuzsanna Budapest in 1971. With its focus
upon a nurturing "mother-goddess," a
return to the Pagan and goddess ritual
became, for many women a very real alter
native to the traditional patriarchal reli
gions.
Interest ran at a sort of low boil, and the
movement grew slowly until the mid
1980s, when that momentous event that
launched the "New Age" burst upon the
scene: Shirley MacLaine published her
book "Out on a Limb."
Until then, Levitt noted, "it had always
been a 'get thee behind me, Satan' situation.
And now it's turned into this — a fad!"
While the new breed of witches can
often still be characterized as "people who
survived Catholic school" — those looking
for an alternative to traditional spirituality
— witchcraft has also become an alterna
tive means of channeling energy into envi
ronmentalism, philosophy, even "therapy

and psychology," said Levitt.
Indeed, now you can walk into almost
any respectable bookstore and, once you
get past the usual dross of pricey designer
crystals and positive-attitude refrigerator
magnets ("1 deserve to be happy and suc
cessful" and the like), you can find a wealth
of information on goddess ritual and mag
ick. (That "k" is important — it distin
guishes the whole "pagan-ritual scene" from
the sort of "magic" more closely associated

with men in greasy tuxedos pulling rabbit'
out of hats.)
Certain standard titles are almost alway
available, like the all-purpose "The Hoi
Book of Women's Mysteries" or "Th
Grandmother of Time," both by Budapest
Other books, dealing more specifically witl
the new-breed witchcraft and goddess rit
ual, cover subjects ranging from "healing
the earth" to "unleashing your totemic sub
conscious potential".
Of course, if you're only out for the
cheap thrills of spell casting and the like,
almost everyone agrees that there are no
guarantees for success. Almost every book 1
picked up came equipped with a very pre
cise, very visible disclaimer. This, of course,
is another one of the fundamental differ
ences between the "new" witchcraft/Pagan
ism and its more ancient counterparts: the
modern witch has learned to avoid messy
litigation and legal fees.
Interested in what modern paganism can
do for you? Anxious to try a little of your
own witchcraft? Or would you just like to
see professionals explain how it's done? As
hobbies go, it's cheaper than bungee jump
ing — and healthier too.

Crystals are believed by many to have magical healing
powers. If you are down on your luck in love, a glit
tering yellow sunstone might help turn the trick.
