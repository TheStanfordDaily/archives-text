Then again, it was Febru

Lacking both a destination
and a map, I did what any
savvy traveler would do. 1
stopped at the Sonoma Visi

Visitors' Review 1 had to buy a
map for $2.95.
From the Visitor's Center 1
drove into downtown Sono
ma and out East Napa Street.
Incidentally, if you're plan
ning to tour only in Sonoma,
don't buy a map. There is one
painted on the side of a build
ing just before you approach
the town square.
My traveling companion
studied the map in search of
our first target. Each cluster of
grapes on the map symbol
ized a winery.
There were 270 grape clus
ters.
It was at this point that I
realized that any place that
can grow a grapevine claims
to be a winery.
The Buena Vista Winery
was our first stop. We had
intended to check out the

Sebastiani Vineyards first, but I missed the turn. After sauntering
up a narrow road lined by immense eucalyptus trees, I reached the
gravel parking lot for Buena Vista. The winery was having a wine
sale that day, but it did not seeni overly crowded.
The cellars and the tasting room were rustic, stone buildings
built into the side of a hill. The whole area was shaded by oak and
eucalyptus trees. The place was subdued and did not seem overly
commercial except for the Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream vendor. With
the tour of the cellars closed due to renovation, there was not much
to do except go in the tasting room.
The bottom floor contained every bit of wine paraphernalia nec
essary for a drunken rampage in the country. The top floor was a
small art gallery. The day 1 was there, they were exhibiting pastel

drawings. Only the one of a classical carousel was worth the aver
age price of $1000. Needless to say, 1 did not bring home any art
work.
After my friend grabbed a swig of a light Pinot Noir, we struck out
for our next destination.
From Sonoma we took highway 12-121 east to Napa and then
highway 29-121 north into the Napa Valley. Our next destination
was the V. Sattui Winery just below the town of St. Helena. It was
here where my fantasy about wine country bought the farm.
All of my delusions of quaintness were destroyed at V. Sattui by
the bumper-to-bumper traffic, packed parking lot and walkie
talkie-toting parking attendants. The main building, a large, vine
covered stone winery looked lust right. It was surrounded on three
