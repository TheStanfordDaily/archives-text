Lacking both a destination

map for $2.95.
From the Visitor's Center 1
drove into downtown Sono
ma and out East Napa Street.
Incidentally, if you're plan
ning to tour only in Sonoma,
don't buy a map. There is one
painted on the side of a build
ing just before you approach
the town square.
My traveling companion
studied the map in search of
our first target. Each cluster of
grapes on the map symbol
ized a winery.
There were 270 grape clus
ters.
It was at this point that I
realized that any place that
can grow a grapevine claims
to be a winery.
The Buena Vista Winery
was our first stop. We had
intended to check out the

Sebastiani Vineyards first, but I missed the turn. After sauntering
up a narrow road lined by immense eucalyptus trees, I reached the
gravel parking lot for Buena Vista. The winery was having a wine
sale that day, but it did not seeni overly crowded.
The cellars and the tasting room were rustic, stone buildings
built into the side of a hill. The whole area was shaded by oak and
eucalyptus trees. The place was subdued and did not seem overly
commercial except for the Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream vendor. With
the tour of the cellars closed due to renovation, there was not much
to do except go in the tasting room.
The bottom floor contained every bit of wine paraphernalia nec
essary for a drunken rampage in the country. The top floor was a
small art gallery. The day 1 was there, they were exhibiting pastel

drawings. Only the one of a classical carousel was worth the aver
age price of $1000. Needless to say, 1 did not bring home any art
work.
After my friend grabbed a swig of a light Pinot Noir, we struck out
for our next destination.
From Sonoma we took highway 12-121 east to Napa and then
highway 29-121 north into the Napa Valley. Our next destination
was the V. Sattui Winery just below the town of St. Helena. It was
here where my fantasy about wine country bought the farm.
All of my delusions of quaintness were destroyed at V. Sattui by
the bumper-to-bumper traffic, packed parking lot and walkie
talkie-toting parking attendants. The main building, a large, vine
covered stone winery looked lust right. It was surrounded on three

sides by acres of vineyards. A big part of the
V. Sattui experience is suppose to be pic
nicking on the grounds. However, the place
was just crawling with people. The gourmet
cheese shop and deli was well-stocked, but
the crowds were similar to those you might
find in a Leningrad supermarket just after it
has gotten some fresh meat.
In other words, if you are going to come,
don't come on the weekends.
With my pastoral image of wine country
now shattered, I creeped along in traffic
towards Calistoga. The town, not the bever
age. As soon as I was north of St. Helena the
situation began to improve. The wineries
were larger and more distinctive.
It was late afternoon by the time we fin
ished lunch at Bosko's, an Italian restaurant
in Calistoga. We headed south to our final
stop, the Beringer Vineyards.

Our first glimpse of the Rhine House, the
semi-Gothic looking mansion at Beringers,
told us we had finally found a winery that
rivaled our imaginations. Though there was
no picnicking allowed on the grounds, the
winery did provided tours until 4:30 p.m.
Each tour ended with complimentary wine
tasting in the Rhine House. It was in the
Rhine House that wine and related acces
sories were for sale.
Beyond the distinguished architecture of
the winery, what caught my eye was the
stunning stained and painted glass in the
mansion. Throughout the house there were
detailed images of wildlife and northern
California scenery.
Closing time came at Beringers before we
had fully explored the estate. However, as
we drove south into the waiting traffic, we
left with a sweet taste in our mouths
encouraging us to return again to the valley

Sonoma is known for more
than its grapes. Here, the
scenery is beautiful — even
in the rain.
