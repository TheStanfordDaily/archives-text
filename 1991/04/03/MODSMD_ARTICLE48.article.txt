# HOME, SWEET HOME

### Mike Friedly Lindsey Pedersen 
magine that
I M some friends
M invite you to
■JL spend the week
end in their Victorian
house overlooking Mon
terey Bay, where you eat
breakfast with them in the
mornings, wander their
gardens and play with their
horses during the after
noons and you spend the
nights in one of their five
guest rooms.
Now imagine paying
$100 per night for virtually
the same experience at a
bed-and-breakfast place
called the Apple Lane Inn
near Santa Cruz.

Bed-and-Breakfast inns pro
vide an alternative to the
impersonal atmosphere of
hotels and motels, furnishing
their guests with far more than
simply a place to sleep and eat
on vacation. For many people,
these inns are the focus of the
vacation itself.
The advantages of bed-and
breakfast inns are obvious. The
atmosphere is far less sterile
and sanitized and far more
comfortable than hotels. They
are cozy and give personal
attention, whereas hotels are
strictly for the convenience of
travelers.
They are different from
hotels and inns by their small
size and the fact that they are
only allowed to serve breakfast
to their guests because of
health regulations.
We stayed overnight at the
Apple Lane Inn, a bed-and
breakfast inn located about 10
miles south of Santa Cruz in
Aptos that has more than two
acres of land for their horses,

rooster and five hens, gardens, gazebo and red barn.
As the name implies, the focus of this 114-year-old inn is apples.
From apple-scented soap in the rooms, baked apples and apple
muffins in the dining room for breakfast and decorative apple
knick-knacks in the living room, the owners preserve the original
flavor of the country farmhouse, whose original owners used to
press cider from the apples of their own orchard.
Breakfast on the weekends is served promptly at 9 a.m., giving
the guests plenty of time afterward to spend with the inns horses,
playing darts in the inns wine cellar or frolicking in the sun at the
Boardwalk in nearby Santa Cruz.
A number of other bed-and-breakfasts inns also offer breakfast in
bed.

Most of the guests of the hed-and-breakfast inn are middle-aged
couples, although Apple Lane Inn also hosts college students and
families, according to co-owner Douglas Groom. The average guest
is a "middle-age, romantic woman who takes her husband out for

the weekend," Groom says.
Groom and his wife, Diana, the co-owner and innkeep

er, bought the bed-and-breakfast inn last year, three
years after their wedding. The Apple Lane regularly

hosts weddings (about 30 last year) and special
occasions in its gardens and gazebo.

We stayed in the Pineapple Room, a
modest room dominated by a surprising
ly comfortable antique four-poster queen
bed and pine armoire, with pineapples
adorning the bedposts and walls. The
room was small but comfortable with its
private bath and teddy bear sitting on the
bed to greet the guests.
For travelers used to impersonal

hotels, the lack of privacy in a
bed-and-breakfast inn is some
thing that has to be gotten used
to, from the paper-thin walls to
the creaky, hardwood floors
that echo throughout the
house. But the lack of privacy
is a trade-off for the personal
experience that cannot be
found at hotels.
The rooms, which cost
between $70 and $115 per
night, are generally more
expensive than hotel rooms,
but few hotels can also provide
the gardens, animals and per
sonal feel that the Apple Lane
can produce.
The Apple Line Inn is stan
dard in terms of the size,
according to Douglas Groom,
although they vary tremen
dously in terms of the experi
ence. The urban elegance of
some such inns in San Francis
, co, for example, is sharply con
t trasted by the feel of a Victori
an farmhouse such as Apple
Lane.
But all offer the kind of per-

sonal touch that executive hotels and cheesy rent-by-the-hour
motels cannot. And if a bed-and-breakfast inn is not elegant
enough, the Grooms also rent their yacht, Whither Thou Goest,
during the winter to a company that provides a "boat and breakfast"
service on San Francisco Bay.

Mike Friedly and Lindsev Pedersen spent the weekend together at a bed
and-breakfast inn. Don't tell their mothers.
