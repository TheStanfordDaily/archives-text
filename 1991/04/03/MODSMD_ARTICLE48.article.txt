### Mike Friedly Lindsey Pedersen 
magine that
I M some friends
M invite you to
â– JL spend the week
end in their Victorian
house overlooking Mon
terey Bay, where you eat
breakfast with them in the
mornings, wander their
gardens and play with their
horses during the after
noons and you spend the
nights in one of their five
guest rooms.
Now imagine paying
$100 per night for virtually
the same experience at a
bed-and-breakfast place
called the Apple Lane Inn
near Santa Cruz.
