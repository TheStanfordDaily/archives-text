# STAR STRUCK
## 
### Joel Stein 
A 1 hen I was just a little tyke, no
" 1/1 7 taller than the crab grass that
V v grew on my lawn, 1 would lie
outside with my other little tyke friends and
stare at the sky.
Inevitably, one of them, in a sudden
burst of creativity, would look up at the
clouds and say, "1 see a sheep." Then, with
their pathetic little "I just figured out what
Mr. Hooper meant" look on their faces, they
would turn to me and ask, "What do you
see, Nebuchadnezzar?"
Placing a blade of grass in my little
fourth-grade nothing mouth, 1 would sit up
and say, "A cloud. All right? 1 see a cloud.
Looks like a cumulus-nimbus. Now leave
me the hell alone."
But the stars — ah, the stars were my
love. 1 could gaze at the stars until my neck
was so stiff my Adam's apple looked like the
almost-bald Fisher Price figure with the
green full-body turtleneck.
Ever)' night, up until my 12th birthday
(the year when 1 was permanently psycho
logically scarred by that Skylab scare), I
would sneak out of my room, grab a bottle
of Jack Daniels and go outside to stare at
the stars.
1 knew nothing about the Greeks or their
little stories, so I invented my own. 1 think
1 still remember them. Let's see, 1 . . . [Fade
out to cheesy, sit-com dream segment
music.]
The sky. 1 hate the sky. The only thing I
hate more than the sky is the earth. And
Mrs. Wilconky. But 1 guess it's better than
that stupid Voyagers show. And besides,
even when 1 do manage to press 12 and 28
at the same time, the Playboy Channel does
that split V-hold thing, which creates those
semi-erotic Picassoesque images which
must be very damaging to the psyche of a
child my age.
So once again I'm left trying to look at
the stars. The only thing it looks like to me
is a huce, black stucco house which some

one has been picking and picking and pick
ing ... Or maybe it looks like some Clam-
Boat-Platter-smudged connect-Ihe-dots,
concocted by an ether-indulged Howard
Johnson employee. Either way it's not much
more exciting than trying to figure out if
Lady Elaine Fairchild is gonna hook up

with Chef Brockett
But after a ■

couple more
sloshes of J.D.,
things seem a lot
clearer. 1 see
Fred Rogers
himself. And
wait — 1 can't
believe it, but it
looks like he's
robbing a 7-
Eleven. And
there's Greg in
his new car and
he keeps slam
ming the door
on Marsha's
head. And look,
there are my
parents and
they're being
riddled with
bullets by a gang

of angry candy-store owners for not letting me
have any dessert — Bang! Bang! Bang . . .
[Fade back in.]
Now, after years of maturation and sev
eral thousand dollars worth of therapy, 1 see
completely different patterns in the stars. 1
see peace, harmony and lots of yonic
imagery. In fact, sometimes the whole sky
lights up like one huge, celestial Georgia
O'Keefe painting. I'm still working it all
out.
Most of all, when 1 look at the stars, I see
love. I see a love which encompasses every
thing. A love which reaches from the giant
heads of the great universities to the little

peons who will be watching them make
license plates when this whole indirect-cost
thing is over. A love so strong that not even
that really big scary guy and his really little
scary friend, who are always at Encina,
could bench press. A love which says that I
gotta get out and start enjoying 'cause life's
too short.

Yes, things have changed a lot since I
was that naive, curious child who looked at
the stars, but one thing remains constant —
the overwhelming beauty of it all. Why, 1
could stay up all night just staring at the
majesty of the heavens if it weren't for the
smog and the homework and the fact that
its so damn cold out there.
So, for some parting advice, I'll just tell
you what my Uncle Casey always said,
"Joel, keep your ears to the ground and
keep looking at the stars." My Uncle Casey
wasn't too bright.

Joel Sicin is still a long-haired Jew.
