# Most ethnically diverse freshman class admitted
## 
### Peter Robison Staff writer 
After seven years as dean of undergradu
ate admissions, Dean Jean Fetter is getting
the job down to a science — describing this
year's search for freshmen as "probably the
smoothest in any year we've done."
Acceptance letters went out last Friday,
March 29, the earliest date ever for Stan
ford. Fetter said the admissions office usu
ally aims for an April 2 or April 3 mailing
date, and "it's always an incredible chal
lenge" to meet that deadline.
The newly admitted class is also the
most ethnically diverse ever — 45 percent
of the admitted students are of black, Chi
cano/Latino, Asian-American or Native
American heritage. That is a large increase
from Fetter's first year as dean of admis
sions in 1985, when about 28 percent of the
admitted students were members of those
groups.
Fetter called this year's process "a par
ticularly nostalgic reading period. . . . Each

entering class has been memorable, but this
one has a particular place in my heart
because it is my last."
The total number of applicants increased
by 4.5 percent this year to 13,528, despite
the nationwide decrease in number of high
school graduates. Of the pool of applicants,
2,639 (19.5 percent) were admitted, a slight
decrease from last year when 20 percent of
the applicants were offered admission.
The academic caliber of this year's
admitted students remains high — 46 per
cent of them have grade point averages of
4.0, and 43 percent have combined SAT
scores of 1,400 or above.
Slightly more women were admitted this
year — 46 percent of the admitted class is
female, up from 44 percent in 1990.
The percentage of admitted students
coming from California continued to
increase. The share of Californians this
year is 36.2 percent, up from 30 percent two
years ago. New York is the next-highest rep-
resented state at 6.8 percent.
Now, Fetter and her admis
sions staff must endure what she
called "a very nervous time" as
they wait for the admitted stu
dents to make their decisions on
whether to attend Stanford. She
said about 80 percent of them
wait until the May 1 deadline to
decide.
