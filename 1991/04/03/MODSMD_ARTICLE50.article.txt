# NORTHERN CALIFORNIA'S OTHER DISNEYLAND
## 
### John Louie 
The last time a "Vortex"
attraction opened in
the Bay Area, there
was hardly any excitement. A
small dance club in sleepy Palo
Alto, the Vortex (now called
The Edge) soon closed due to
lack of interest.
This year, another Vortex
hits Northern California. And
this time, the attraction
promises to leave visitors out
of breath.


Great America
You can't hold on to your seat
in Great America's new Vortex
rollercoaster. Thrill-seekers
ride this 55.5 million attrac
tion standing up.
