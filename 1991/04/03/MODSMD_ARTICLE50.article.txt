# NORTHERN CALIFORNIA'S OTHER DISNEYLAND
## 
### John Louie 
The last time a "Vortex"
attraction opened in
the Bay Area, there
was hardly any excitement. A
small dance club in sleepy Palo
Alto, the Vortex (now called
The Edge) soon closed due to
lack of interest.
This year, another Vortex
hits Northern California. And
this time, the attraction
promises to leave visitors out
of breath.


Great America
You can't hold on to your seat
in Great America's new Vortex
rollercoaster. Thrill-seekers
ride this 55.5 million attrac
tion standing up.
Vortex is the new stand-up, looping
roller coaster at the Great America theme
park in Santa Clara. Since Shockwave
closed at Southern California's Magic
Mountain three years ago, Vortex is the only
stand-up coaster west of the Mississippi
River.
Even if its riders were seated, Vortex
would offer quite a ride. The $5.5 million
twisting, looping coaster offers a ride of 134
seconds, a 91-foot initial ascent and speeds
of up to 45 miles per hour. With only a
padded shoulder harness to clutch, riders
rocket along a weaving track which threads
its way back through the 360-degree
straight loop.
Great America boasts 33 rides and
attractions within its 100 acres. Because the
theme park is family-oriented, true thrill
seeking die-hards may not find Great Amer
ica as breathtaking as parks like Magic
Mountain or Six Flags Great America in Illi
nois. Fortunately, however, the number of
thrill rides at Great America compensates
for the short ride lengths and should be
enough to satisfy even the most daring.
Vortex joins a family of roller coasters at
Great America which originated in 1979
with Tidal Wave, a large blue coaster which
serves as one of the parks centerpieces.
Deceptively tame in appearance, the coaster

operates like Knott's Berry Farms Mon
tezuma's Revenge, in which riders rocket
out of the station into a straight loop and
then let gravity take them through the loop
again, this time backwards. The initial
acceleration out of the station (zero to 55
miles per hour in under five seconds) is so
quick that the first loop is over before one
realizes it.
Great America also boasts The Demon, a
black steel coaster that offers two straight
loops, a tunnel and a two-loop corkscrew,
and the Grizzly, the largest wooden roller
coaster in Northern California. Another
ride, The Edge, plummets riders 60 feet in
2.5 seconds of freefall.
Despite the state-wide drought, Great
America offers two water rides designed to
splash and soak its riders. Rip-Roanng
Rapids takes six riders through turbulent
white waters and Whitewater Falls, which
opened last season, plummets boats over a
50-foot waterfall. Like Magic Mountain's
Tidal Wave, Whitewater Falls is designed so
the boat's spray upon impact rains back
down upon passengers a second later, leav
ing everyone completely soaked.
The theme park also has various carni
val-iike rides, such as Skyhawk, which lets
riders operate the individual cars' barrel
rolls and Revolution, a 360-degree swing

ing ship.
For those with weaker hearts, Great
America presents many calmer attractions,
ranging from Carousel Columbia, the
worlds largest double-decker carousel, to
an Imax Theater, which boasts a 70-foot by
96-foot screen. This season debuts Blue
Planet, a 42-minute film providing a mov
ing portrait of our planet Earth.
And for those with even weaker hearts,
there are a variety of children's ndes in
Smurf Woods. (Attempting to squish one
self into one of the tiny roller coaster cars of
Blue Streak, however, may be problematic.)
Great America may not fully satiate
those who love losing their stomachs and
flirting with dangerous speeds; for that,
you'll have to go to Southern California.
Still, some of the rides at Great America are
enough to take your breath away.
Great America is open weekends in the
spring and daily from May 31 to Sept. 2 from
10 a.m. The park is located in Santa Clara off
Highway 101. Admission is $20.95 for adults
and $10.45f0r children. For more information,
call (408) 988-1800.
