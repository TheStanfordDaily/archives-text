# GIMME A BREAK
## 
### Amy Gillett 
So you say you want a game of pool?
And Tresidder Union game room is not
pool hall enough to satisfy your hunger for
filling small nets with striped or solid balls?
It's time to take a short trip Off the Farm.
To save you some time, energy and very
possibly your life I've done some prelimi
nary research.
First, 1 checked the yellow pages under
Pool Halls. That heading referred me to Bil
liard Parlors. "How classy, billiards!" 1
naively mused. With the word "parlor," my
mind continued to play tricks on me, and I
saw a vision of 19th century Russian aristo
crats waltzing around a palatial St. Peters
burg hall. Catherine the Great glanced

down on them from an oil-painting on the
wall.
Antonio's Nut House, located one mile
from campus on California Avenue is the
closest billiard parlor to campus — and the
farthest cry from my mental image of a par
lor
Behind the fully stocked bar and the
large bartender eager to serve but unable to
add ("I can serve the stuff really well, 1 just
can't figure the tab!"), I witness a pair of
framed underpants with red hearts. As the
sign underneath them says, these are "Mon
ica's panties."
But where is Monica?
1 see few women in the Nuthouse.
Maybe they are all gathered in the bath
room, asking themselves the same question
weighing on my mind, "Who the hell is

Monica? And why are her underwear
framed?"
1 enter the bathroom — and am greeted
at the entrance by a pink metal box pro
truding from the wall. How tasteful, how
feminine — it's a pink condom dispenser!
The back room, which contains two
pool tables and a few pinball machines, is
full of men. They are drinking beer and
crowded around the tables. Some are
watching, others are playing, but both the
active and passive participants react with
loud "Oohs," "Aww's," and unprintable
expletives after every shot.
A young player, who resembles Boris
Becker but has the temper of John McEn
roe, tears at his reddish-golden locks, howls
"shoulda had it!" at the ceiling and swings
his cue perilously close to others every lime
he misses a shot.
I sit down in a black saddle-like seat to
observe. Soon I become mesmerized — I
never before realized that pool is such a fab
ulous spectator sport! After half an hour,
one of the players politely tells me to move
— I'm in the way of his shot.
As I try to get up from the seal, 1 feel
extra resistance pulling me down. A force
stronger than gravity, it is the same pull you
encounter after having sat on a large wad of

chewing gum, then trying to get up. Strenuously ripping myself
from the seat, I hear a distinct tearing noise. Although I have left
the seat, a part of my pants has not been so fortunate.
I look at the saddle. Why hadn't 1 noticed the large spikes in the
back of it before sitting down? And why hadn't 1 had the foresight
to coordinate my underwear with my pants? Now 1 had to walk
around with two patches of blue underwear peering though my
black pants. My friend Jon, who has accompanied me to the Nut
House for moral support and protection, offers little solace. "Ha!"
he guffaws, "You're obviously not a regular here!"
As I make my way to the door, hand discreetly covering under
wear exposure points, I notice a man with a long gray beard swing
ing a rattle to the obscene country music playing loudly in the
background. (And 1 had thought the place was called Antonio's Nut
House because the floor was covered with peanut shells!) There are
more Rumpelstiltskin types sitting at the bar, perhaps discussing
the gold nuggets they found earlier in the day.
Jon and 1 decide to play pool, but, upon investigation, we dis
cover that the wait is too long. In fact, it is potentially endless - as
one man challenges another, the winner plays the loser's best
friend, the loser's best friend wins and challenges the first man's
long-standing nemesis, who wins and insists on playing the first
winner three out of five.
These men thus form a vicious circle of winners and losers that
certainly cannot be broached by someone like me who employs the
strikc-hard-and-pray-nothmg-bounces-off-the-table strategy and
whose one accurate call ever was "White ball in the corner pocket."
Several women sit at the bar, but only a couple of women have
made it near the four pool tables. Perhaps they were scared off by
the large number of men waving around long wooden sticks and
raving about "angles" and "table sizes." Instead of analyzing this sit
uation further, I refer you to Freud's Dora: A Case Study in Hvstena.
My excursion to the Nuthouse may very well have been worth
the trip to the seamstress that I will now have to make. For its jovial
atmosphere, refreshingly unPalo-Alto-like decor and motley clien
tele — a blend of young townsmen, local relics and Stanford stu
dents, 1 recommend Antonio's Nuthouse.

iAm_y Gillett wakes up after nights of unsettling dreams and thinks she
has been transformed into a monstrous Bug. She has only recently
stopped writing about it in The Daily.

Antonio's Nut House in Palo
Alto features a fully stocked
bar and friendly service —
as well a game of pool, if the
regulars will let you.

So you say you want a game of pool?
And Tresidder Union game room is not
pool hall enough to satisfy your hunger for
filling small nets with striped or solid balls?
It's time to take a short trip Off the Farm.
To save you some time, energy and very
possibly your life I've done some prelimi
nary research.
First, 1 checked the yellow pages under
Pool Halls. That heading referred me to Bil
liard Parlors. "How classy, billiards!" 1
naively mused. With the word "parlor," my
mind continued to play tricks on me, and I
saw a vision of 19th century Russian aristo
crats waltzing around a palatial St. Peters
burg hall. Catherine the Great glanced

down on them from an oil-painting on the
wall.
Antonio's Nut House, located one mile
from campus on California Avenue is the
closest billiard parlor to campus — and the
farthest cry from my mental image of a par
lor
Behind the fully stocked bar and the
large bartender eager to serve but unable to
add ("I can serve the stuff really well, 1 just
can't figure the tab!"), I witness a pair of
framed underpants with red hearts. As the
sign underneath them says, these are "Mon
ica's panties."
But where is Monica?
1 see few women in the Nuthouse.
Maybe they are all gathered in the bath
room, asking themselves the same question
weighing on my mind, "Who the hell is

Monica? And why are her underwear
framed?"
1 enter the bathroom — and am greeted
at the entrance by a pink metal box pro
truding from the wall. How tasteful, how
feminine — it's a pink condom dispenser!
The back room, which contains two
pool tables and a few pinball machines, is
full of men. They are drinking beer and
crowded around the tables. Some are
watching, others are playing, but both the
active and passive participants react with
loud "Oohs," "Aww's," and unprintable
expletives after every shot.
A young player, who resembles Boris
Becker but has the temper of John McEn
roe, tears at his reddish-golden locks, howls
"shoulda had it!" at the ceiling and swings
his cue perilously close to others every lime
he misses a shot.
I sit down in a black saddle-like seat to
observe. Soon I become mesmerized — I
never before realized that pool is such a fab
ulous spectator sport! After half an hour,
one of the players politely tells me to move
— I'm in the way of his shot.
As I try to get up from the seal, 1 feel
extra resistance pulling me down. A force
stronger than gravity, it is the same pull you
encounter after having sat on a large wad of

chewing gum, then trying to get up. Strenuously ripping myself
from the seat, I hear a distinct tearing noise. Although I have left
the seat, a part of my pants has not been so fortunate.
I look at the saddle. Why hadn't 1 noticed the large spikes in the
back of it before sitting down? And why hadn't 1 had the foresight
to coordinate my underwear with my pants? Now 1 had to walk
around with two patches of blue underwear peering though my
black pants. My friend Jon, who has accompanied me to the Nut
House for moral support and protection, offers little solace. "Ha!"
he guffaws, "You're obviously not a regular here!"
As I make my way to the door, hand discreetly covering under
wear exposure points, I notice a man with a long gray beard swing
ing a rattle to the obscene country music playing loudly in the
background. (And 1 had thought the place was called Antonio's Nut
House because the floor was covered with peanut shells!) There are
more Rumpelstiltskin types sitting at the bar, perhaps discussing
the gold nuggets they found earlier in the day.
Jon and 1 decide to play pool, but, upon investigation, we dis
cover that the wait is too long. In fact, it is potentially endless - as
one man challenges another, the winner plays the loser's best
friend, the loser's best friend wins and challenges the first man's
long-standing nemesis, who wins and insists on playing the first
winner three out of five.
These men thus form a vicious circle of winners and losers that
certainly cannot be broached by someone like me who employs the
strikc-hard-and-pray-nothmg-bounces-off-the-table strategy and
whose one accurate call ever was "White ball in the corner pocket."
Several women sit at the bar, but only a couple of women have
made it near the four pool tables. Perhaps they were scared off by
the large number of men waving around long wooden sticks and
raving about "angles" and "table sizes." Instead of analyzing this sit
uation further, I refer you to Freud's Dora: A Case Study in Hvstena.
