## SUNG BLUE 
### Jason Bloomstein 
The very idea of Bono, on the album
"Rattle and Hum," exhorting the
Edge to "play the blues" strikes ter
ror in the heart of all true blues fans. The
very idea of U2 actually scratching the sur
face of a long and arduous history of this
unique type of music seems preposterous.
But the blues, while retaining its fervor in
clubs in the Bay Area and across the nation,
has also permeated many forms of contem
porary music.
The blues is essentially black folk music
with Afncan origins. It is said to have
evolved from spirituals, or black soul
music, but emphasizing the solo voice as
opposed to a chorus and relying on riffs of
three lines with four bars each.
Music histonans often classify the blues
into three basic genres. In country blues,
which emerged from the South around the

turn of the century', a male voice accompa
nied by one or more acoustic steel string
guitars travels around between melodies'
embellished verses. Clarence Lofton, Hud
die Ledbetter and Bill Broonzy are identi
fied as some of the greats.
Classic blues employs a New Orleans
style jazz band and a female vocalist,
including songs by Ma Rainey and Bessie
Smith from the early 1900s. While Smiths
songs are usually sad, her music is not nec
essarily the rule of blues â€” the music can
be, and often is, joyous and boisterous.
Perhaps the most well-known form of
the blues emerged in post-World War 11
Chicago. Heady favontes such as Howlin'
Wolf, Muddy Waters and Little Walter
assimilated electronic amplification into the
blues rifts, spearheading an instrumental
group with their strong voices. The postwar
era encouraged musicians to move north
