# PIERCING
## INSIGHTS 
### Omar Wasow 
people wear earrings where
g don't have ears. Really. People
cute golden hoops in nipples,
scrotums, labia, foreskins, cliton and ure
thrae (not all on the same person, silly).
Yup, pierced scrotums.
Got your attention?
Believe it. Just about every soft part of
the body can be pierced. Some people even
have just about every soft part of their bod
ies pierced. There's the little overhang on
your bellybutton (not to marginalize the
'outies' of the world), your lip, the skin just
below your anus, the head of your (or
someone else's) penis — the list goes on,

though 1 won't.
Known as "body modification," each of
these rites of passage has a long history in
countries and cultures from Aztec Mexico
to Victorian England.
"Why," you ask, "would anyone want to
pierce their body ... let alone their geni
tals?" Good question.
Still, you'd be surprised — perhaps even
persuaded — by the various intelligent rea
sons people give. In life, the only thing that
is truly yours — argue some devotees — is
your body. One way of declaring that bag of
flesh and bones your own is to adorn it to
your liking.

Another oft-cited reason for body pierc
ing and modification is enhanced sensation
to a particular part of the body. Many men,
or so I've heard, love the greater sensitivity
of their post-pierced nipples — you can fig
ure out the effects on other organs. Others
point to a spintual dimension of piercing.
Sophomore Jed Friedman explains, "I
got my nose pierced as a distinguishing
mark to raise myself above the faceless
masses." Though the first split second "hurt
like hell," it was only tender for a day.
Friedman got the pierce at Body Manipula
tions in San Francisco's Haight District and
describes the piercers as "very friendly and


Rajiv Chandrasekaran Dally
professional."
In fact, the experience was sufficiently tolerable that he is plan
ning to pierce the corner of his lower lip.
For Jennifer Price, another nose-pierced sophomore, "it wasn't
like some super-excruciating pain but it hurt and was over in a sec
ond." Since the pierce, Price has been "surprised how much it mat
ters to other people."
"People want to make a big deal out of it," she says, "when for
me it was a risk that 1 took. 1 didn't think that it mattered and so I
did it to reinforce that it didn't matter."
Price says now "1 pay a lot more attention to my nose, which is
neat . . . It's kind of personified."
One senior got a nipple pierce about a year ago. She says she was
enticed by the sensual and attractive appeal of a ring dangling from
her breast. Over the past year the nipple has become infected a few
times and only stopped being tender after several months. Never
theless, she is "quite tickled by it,"and finds her lovers are
delighted by the surprise.
Still, not all pierces have happy endings. Jim Haljun, another
sophomore, was the proud owner of a bellybutton pierce. Unfortu
nately, over winter break a doctor informed him that if he didn't
remove it, an infection might spread to his liver. Deciding it was
better to lose the pierce than die, Haljun has stopped wearing his
gold hoop.
Nevertheless, he urges "anyone thinking about it to try it." For
Haljun, the appeal of the navel pierce lies in "testing boundaries
and calling into question definitions of what bodies are and what
you can do with them."
Haljun also calls the fact the pierce "wierded out his parents" a
plus.
Mark Seitchik, an employee at Gauntlet — the other major
piercing establishment in San Francisco — says people get pierces
for many different reasons. He sees "eroticism, aesthetics, stimula
tion and fashion" as the main reasons for piercing. Seitchik — who
has had pierces in such places as his neck, scrotum, nose, ear and
eyebrow — agrees that "of course the pierces are painful, but the
pain is relative."
"Some people are surprised when the pierce is over" he says,
"and others even say it feels good." In fact, some folks get pierces
just for the sensation — they don't bother with jewelry.
At Gauntlet, each body piercing session costs $25 and the jew
elry prices range from $30 to $100.
A nose pierce seems fairly straightforward and inexpensive.
Almost anyone ought to be able to survive what senior Rachel Kahn
describes as "a sharp pain that really only lasts for a few seconds."
Moreover, everyone I talked to is enthusiastic about their pierces
and even Haljun is happy he tried it.
As Seitchik argues, "You can't fake it. If you went through it, you
went through it, there's no two ways about it." Consequently, "if
you've experienced it, at least you know what its like," he says.
Considering body modification has been occurring throughout
the world in various times, places and cultures, perhaps it is our
American society that is strange.
Of course, with make-up and plastic surgery maybe we've cre
ated new ways express a deeply human need to declare one's body
one's own.
Maybe not.
Either way, "its your body," as Seitchik says. "Do with it what
you like."

Omar Wasow has funny hair and more than seven holes in his head. Wert
not telling where else he's pierced.

Yup, pierced scrotums.
Got your attention?
Believe it. Just about every soft part of
the body can be pierced. Some people even
have just about every soft part of their bod
ies pierced. There's the little overhang on
your bellybutton (not to marginalize the
'outies' of the world), your lip, the skin just
below your anus, the head of your (or
someone else's) penis — the list goes on,

though 1 won't.
Known as "body modification," each of
these rites of passage has a long history in
countries and cultures from Aztec Mexico
to Victorian England.
"Why," you ask, "would anyone want to
pierce their body ... let alone their geni
tals?" Good question.
Still, you'd be surprised — perhaps even
persuaded — by the various intelligent rea
sons people give. In life, the only thing that
is truly yours — argue some devotees — is
your body. One way of declaring that bag of
flesh and bones your own is to adorn it to
your liking.

Another oft-cited reason for body pierc
ing and modification is enhanced sensation
to a particular part of the body. Many men,
or so I've heard, love the greater sensitivity
of their post-pierced nipples — you can fig
ure out the effects on other organs. Others
point to a spintual dimension of piercing.
Sophomore Jed Friedman explains, "I
got my nose pierced as a distinguishing
mark to raise myself above the faceless
masses." Though the first split second "hurt
like hell," it was only tender for a day.
Friedman got the pierce at Body Manipula
tions in San Francisco's Haight District and
describes the piercers as "very friendly and

professional."
In fact, the experience was sufficiently tolerable that he is plan
ning to pierce the corner of his lower lip.
For Jennifer Price, another nose-pierced sophomore, "it wasn't
like some super-excruciating pain but it hurt and was over in a sec
ond." Since the pierce, Price has been "surprised how much it mat
ters to other people."
"People want to make a big deal out of it," she says, "when for
me it was a risk that 1 took. 1 didn't think that it mattered and so I
did it to reinforce that it didn't matter."
Price says now "1 pay a lot more attention to my nose, which is
neat . . . It's kind of personified."
One senior got a nipple pierce about a year ago. She says she was
enticed by the sensual and attractive appeal of a ring dangling from
her breast. Over the past year the nipple has become infected a few
times and only stopped being tender after several months. Never
theless, she is "quite tickled by it,"and finds her lovers are
delighted by the surprise.
Still, not all pierces have happy endings. Jim Haljun, another
sophomore, was the proud owner of a bellybutton pierce. Unfortu
nately, over winter break a doctor informed him that if he didn't
remove it, an infection might spread to his liver. Deciding it was
better to lose the pierce than die, Haljun has stopped wearing his
gold hoop.
Nevertheless, he urges "anyone thinking about it to try it." For
Haljun, the appeal of the navel pierce lies in "testing boundaries
and calling into question definitions of what bodies are and what
you can do with them."
Haljun also calls the fact the pierce "wierded out his parents" a
plus.
Mark Seitchik, an employee at Gauntlet — the other major
piercing establishment in San Francisco — says people get pierces
for many different reasons. He sees "eroticism, aesthetics, stimula
tion and fashion" as the main reasons for piercing. Seitchik — who
has had pierces in such places as his neck, scrotum, nose, ear and
eyebrow — agrees that "of course the pierces are painful, but the
pain is relative."
"Some people are surprised when the pierce is over" he says,
"and others even say it feels good." In fact, some folks get pierces
just for the sensation — they don't bother with jewelry.
At Gauntlet, each body piercing session costs $25 and the jew
elry prices range from $30 to $100.
A nose pierce seems fairly straightforward and inexpensive.
Almost anyone ought to be able to survive what senior Rachel Kahn
describes as "a sharp pain that really only lasts for a few seconds."
Moreover, everyone I talked to is enthusiastic about their pierces
and even Haljun is happy he tried it.
As Seitchik argues, "You can't fake it. If you went through it, you
went through it, there's no two ways about it." Consequently, "if
you've experienced it, at least you know what its like," he says.
Considering body modification has been occurring throughout
the world in various times, places and cultures, perhaps it is our
American society that is strange.
