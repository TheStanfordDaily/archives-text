# Stanford to receive accreditation review
## 
### Matt McNeil Staff writer 
Don't hold your breath for the results, but
Stanford this week will face its decennial
accreditation review by a 15-member panel of
faculty members and administrators from uni
versities across the country.
Every university must undergo this proce
dure once every ten years, and 1991 marks the
occasion for Stanford's review by the Western
Association of Schools and Colleges.
The review board, chosen by the association
and Stanford, consists of members represent
ing various areas of university functioning,
from undergraduate education to library oper
ation.
Team chair David Saxon said the question

with Stanford will not be whether the univer
sity will be accredited.
Instead, Saxon, president emeritus of the
University of California system, said the pro
cess is a chance for Stanford to get an outside
perspective on current issues with which it is
concerned.
These issues were culled from a lengthy
self-study designed to investigate all aspects of
University policy, including topics as contro
versial as the federal probes into Stanford's
indirect-cost policies.
Saxon complimented the University on the
study, saying Stanford has done a "wonderful
job" of collecting information for the
accreditation team. The study exhibited "great
candor," he added, in pointing out areas of

weakness or those of potential controversy.
Stanford has selected six specific areas from
the self-study on which it would like the team
to focus, Saxon said.
Included among these issues are budget
repositioning, the process by which depart
ments select curricula, the teaching and
research environment and the revision of dis
tribution and writing requirements.
One issue which will receive special atten
tion, Saxon said, will be the extent to which
current ethnic and gender diversity programs
are working.
The panel is looking for more input, and
any students interested in presenting topics to
the team should contact accreditation liaison
officer Margaret Dieppa at 723-2496.
