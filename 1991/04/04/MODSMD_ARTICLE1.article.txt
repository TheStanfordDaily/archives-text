# Stanford still faces big-money issues in cost controversy
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
The spotlights have dimmed,
the theatrics have been toned
down and the real action is now
taking place in the wings — but
Stanford's indirect cost drama
plays on.
The next several scenes will be
crucial to the University's long
term financial health. About $30
million in annual revenue are at
stake. Administrators pray the
University's already-fragile oper
ating budget won't be shattered.
The controversy thus far has
centered around what the Univer
sity has included in its indirect
cost claims to the government —
depreciation on a yacht, adminis
trative costs of the Stanford Shop
ping Center and various other
charges that federal auditors and
investigators say are unallowable

and inappropriate.
The focus now shifts to how
Stanford charges the government
for the indirect costs of research
here — the complicated, arcane
accounting rules that govern how
much research universities can
seek in reimbursement for things
like utilities, library use, roads
and administrative overhead.
"They aren't very sexy issues,
but they are where the money is,"
says University President Donald
Kennedy.
The government, for example,
reimburses Stanford more than
$12 million a year for the opera
tion of University libraries. It
pays about $9 million in Stanford
utility bills each year. The money
in both cases is intended to cover
costs Stanford faculty incur while
conducting federal research here.

The indirect cost controversy at Stanford has already taken a toll on
the University's operating budget. Indirect cost recovery accounts
for the second largest source of income in the operating budget. But
the worst may be yet to come.
