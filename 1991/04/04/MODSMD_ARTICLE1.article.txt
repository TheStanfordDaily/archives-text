# Stanford still faces big-money issues in cost controversy
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
The spotlights have dimmed,
the theatrics have been toned
down and the real action is now
taking place in the wings — but
Stanford's indirect cost drama
plays on.
The next several scenes will be
crucial to the University's long
term financial health. About $30
million in annual revenue are at
stake. Administrators pray the
University's already-fragile oper
ating budget won't be shattered.
The controversy thus far has
centered around what the Univer
sity has included in its indirect
cost claims to the government —
depreciation on a yacht, adminis
trative costs of the Stanford Shop
ping Center and various other
charges that federal auditors and
investigators say are unallowable

and inappropriate.
The focus now shifts to how
Stanford charges the government
for the indirect costs of research
here — the complicated, arcane
accounting rules that govern how
much research universities can
seek in reimbursement for things
like utilities, library use, roads
and administrative overhead.
"They aren't very sexy issues,
but they are where the money is,"
says University President Donald
Kennedy.
The government, for example,
reimburses Stanford more than
$12 million a year for the opera
tion of University libraries. It
pays about $9 million in Stanford
utility bills each year. The money
in both cases is intended to cover
costs Stanford faculty incur while
conducting federal research here.

The indirect cost controversy at Stanford has already taken a toll on
the University's operating budget. Indirect cost recovery accounts
for the second largest source of income in the operating budget. But
the worst may be yet to come.
The allegation that first sur
faced back in the fall — that the
University had overbilled the gov
ernment by as much as $200 mil
lion or $300 million during the
last decade — wasn't based on
such controversial charges as
flower arrangements at Hoover
House. It was instead based on
perceived flaws in the methodol
ogy Stanford uses to charge the
government for library use.
Federal rules provide a
"default" methodology for univer
sities to calculate the govern
ment's fair share of library costs,
utility costs and so forth. But uni
versities are also allowed to con
duct "special studies" and enter
into "memoranda of understand
ing" with regulators, thereby
overriding the default rules. Stan
ford has routinely — many say
aggressively — opted to use these
studies and understandings.
The end result is supposed to
be an allocation method that more
accurately reflects what costs the
government incurs for university
based research. But critics of
Stanford, including Navy official
Paul Biddle and the Defense Con
tract Audit Agency, say these
agreements have been far too gen
erous, allowing the University to
recover millions of dollars more
than what is equitable.
Herein lies the real contro
versy.
Negotiating teams from Stan
ford and the Navy are close to
completing a review of all the
studies and agreements that have
bound the parties' relationship
during the last decade. Navy offi
cials say the review should be
completed by next Friday. Robert
Byer, Stanford's dean of research,
says that target may be overly
optimistic.
The review was originally
scheduled to wrap up April 1, but
that date was pushed back due to
the March 13 House Subcommit
tee on Oversight and Investiga
tions hearing that required the
presence of key Stanford and
Navy officials.
The conclusion of the review
will be an important milestone in
the ongoing saga. The two parties
will come one giant step closer to
agreeing on how much Stanford
can charge the government in the
future.
Stanford originally proposed
an indirect cost rate of 78 percent
for this year. Due to fallout from a
host of federal investigations, the
rate now sits — provisionally — at
70 percent. The sudden drop has
wrecked havoc on Stanford's
finances. Each one-point drop
translates into a $1.25 million loss
in revenue for the University as a
whole. Thus, although a final ver
dict has yet to be rendered, Stan
ford has already lost more than
$12 million in expected revenue
this year.
Uncertainty about the ultimate
outcome of the negotiations has
produced fear, anxiety and a
delayed budgeting timetable for
University administrators.
Provost James Rosse normally
presents the upcoming year's bud
get to the Board of Trustees at
their April meeting; he won't do
so until June this year.
"There's just too much uncer
tainty," Rosse says.
Kennedy sounds a similar
chord. "We'll come out some
where," he says. "At the moment I
don't know where it is. I don't
really have a prediction."
For the time being, Kennedy
says, the University has based its
financial forecasting on the 70
percent rate now in place. "We're
sort of accommodating our fore
casts to this year's provisional
rate because it's the only number
we've got," he says.
Several administrators, how
ever, say privately that the rate
could wind up in the mid- to
upper-60 percent range. Esti
mates from government sources
start at that point and tail off
rather rapidly.
Stanford administrators were
shocked at last month's hearing
when a Defense Contract Audit
Agency official recommended the
rate be knocked down to 52 per
cent. Navy negotiators are cur
rently considering that proposal.
William Massy, Stanford's chief
financial officer, says the audit
agency's recommendation is way

out of line. If such a rate were to
be adopted, the effects on the Uni
versity would be cataclysmic.
"We would be laying people off
left and right," Massy says."It
would be impossible for Stanford
to continue as a major research
institution."
The audit agency's proposal
assumes that all of Stanford's
memoranda of understanding
with the government will be ter
minated, forcing the University to
revert back to the government's
default formulas.
Such an outcome is "highly
implausible," Kennedy says.
After working all of last week
end, Massy says, the University
issued a rebuttal to the audit
agency's report. Applying "a fairly
stringent test," Massy says, the
University could only find two
points of possible unallowable
costs. "We found that their calcu
lations were riddled with errors,"
he says.
Massy reports that the Univer
sity's progress thus far in the
negotiations has been encourag
ing. "I think we've made a very
good showing," he says.
The special studies and memo
randa of understanding that are
the centerpiece of the current
negotiations have come under
heavy fire recently from several
government agencies and officials.
A Navy report that was
launched to look into's Biddle's
allegations of overpayment found
that most of these agreements
had neither been audited nor
received the legal review required
by Navy regulations.
In testimony before Dingell's
subcommittee, Rear Adm.
William Miller, the chief of naval
research, said he had considerable
doubt about the equitv of the
agreements. "We believe that it is
very likely that, in fact, the Gov
ernment was overbilled for the
research performed at Stanford
during (the last) decade," he said.
Furthermore, he said, Stan
ford's four major special studies
did not meet his agency's stan
dards. "In every case," he said,
"we have concluded and have
informed the University that we
do not consider the special studies
as they exist today to be adequate
basis for our continuing business
relationship."
Accordingly, the University is
in the process of submitting new
studies to the government. Oral
proposals were made to the Navy
negotiating team two weeks ago,
Massy says. Early next week, the
University will submit final writ
ten proposals for these studies.
A closer look at the utilities
study highlights many of the
issues central to the negotiations.
In 1981 an outside consultant
conducted a study for Stanford to
determine how much of the Uni
versity's utilities should be
charged to federal research. The
study focused on the use and
energy consumption of 10 build
ings and then projected the
results to include the more than
600 buildings on campus.
In written testimony to the
House Subcommittee on Over
sight and Investigations, officials
from the General Accounting
Office strongly criticized the
study.
"While the definition of 'statis
tically sound' may be open to
interpretation, we do not believe
that 10 out of 660 buildings on
campus is a statistically sound
sample," the accounting office
said.
"It is a judgmental sample and
small sample," Massy says. "But I
think those buildings were repre
sentative at the time when the
sample was taken."
The study also included a com
puter simulation which altered
the angle of the sun to determine
the effects of heating and cooling
loads, Massy says.
The challenge presented by the
utility study, according to Byer,
Stanford's dean of research, is "to
somehow find a way that's repre
sentative without sampling every
building on campus." The more
buildings one includes in the sam
ple, the higher the cost. The ques
tion that must be asked, Byer
says, is "What error rate are you
willing to live with at what costs?"
Stanford has agreed to a much
larger sample in the utility study
it is now proposing to the govern
ment.
