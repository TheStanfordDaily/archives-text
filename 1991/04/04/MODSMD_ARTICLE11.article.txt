## Voters to decide how ASSU should debate off-campus issues 
### Miranda Doyle Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate will be required to gather
student opinion before debating off-campus
issues if voters approve a constitutional
amendment two senators hope to put on this
spring's ballot.
The proposed accountability amendment is
the latest stage of an on-going discussion in
the ASSU over what range of issues the senate
and Council of Presidents should debate.
Senator Mike Curry, a sophomore, said he
expects the senate to vote tonight on the bill,
which he co-wrote with senator Naomi Onaga,
a senior. If the bill to place the amendment on
the ballot does not receive a two-thirds
approval, Curry said he plans to get the 2,000
signatures necessary to place it on the ballot.
The proposed amendment would require
the senate and COP to "consult with the Stan
ford student body" in at least two ways when
considering state, national or international
issues. Methods it includes are dorm or phone
polls, open forums and debates or passage of a
referendum in a general election.
Curry said he sees his and Onaga's amend

ment as a counterproposal to senator John
Overdeck's proposed amendment, which will
appear on the spring ballot and limits the
ASSU to debating campus issues.
"Instead of [limiting the ASSU's] scope as
the solution, [the new proposal] puts forward a
process for gathering student input and makes
the ASSU accountable to students," Curry
said.
He added that requiring student input is
better than "limiting what the ASSU can
think about" because he believes there are
appropriate outside issues, such as federal
financial aid cuts.
He said he was not sure whether the issue
of financial aid would be considered an outside
issue under the Overdeck amendment. "The
bill is unclear. It creates confusion," he said.
"[The accountability bill] admits to the fact
that you cannot create a strict definition for all
outside issues."
The Overdeck amendment says a campus
issue is one that affects at least one student in
a significantly different way than it would if
the person were not a Stanford student.
Curry added that including the opinions of
students "prevents senators and the COP

from making blanket statements without any
sort of legitimacy."
Overdeck said Curry's accountability
amendment does not conflict with his pro
posed constitutional amendment. "In a way, I
am in favor of the spirit of the bill," he said.
However, Overdeck was critical of the pro
posal, saying that "it does not go far enough."
Under the accountability amendment, the sen
ate has to report student opinion but is not
required to follow it.
Deputy senate chair Beth Morgan said she
does not believe the Curry and Onaga bill can
replace the Overdeck amendment. "It is vital
that we have student opinion, but [the
accountability amendment] does not define
what the senate can speak on," she said.
Overdeck also said he believes the bill is
ambiguous and poorly written. It does not
specify the percentage of students to be polled
and says that phone polls are "encouraged"
over dorm polls.
"The constitution should say what the
ASSU should or should not do, not what is
preferable.... I wish [the authors] had taken
more time with the wording," Overdeck said.
