action in the war.
The names of the soldiers were withheld

Germany.
In the first incident Tuesday, four soldiers
approached an area containing cluster
bomblets. One soldier picked one up and as
he tried to put it down, it exploded in his

New navy homeports no longer
necessary according to GAO
WASHINGTON (AP) - The General

The recommendation is outlined in a draft
report the congressional watchdog agency sub
mitted to Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney
last month.
