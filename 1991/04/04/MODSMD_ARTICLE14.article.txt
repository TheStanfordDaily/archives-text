# Security Council passes cease-fire resolution

### 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) - The Security Coun
cil adopted yesterday a resolution forcing a defeated
Iraq to its knees and dictating destruction of its
chemical, germ and nuclear warfare capabilities.
If Iraq accepts the resolution, a cease-fire in the
Persian Gulf war automatically takes effect.
Iraq's U.N. envoy called the resolution "outra
geous" and "one-sided" but did not indicate that his
government would refuse to comply with it. Under
pressure, Baghdad accepted all previous council res
olutions.
"This resolution is tough but it is fair," U.S.

Ambassador Thomas Pickering said.
A provisional truce has prevailed on the battle
field since the ground war ended in late February.
The resolution, approved 12-1, would strip Iraq of
its biological and chemical weapons, nuclear
weapons grade materials and most ballistic missiles
under U.N. supervision.
Among other provisions, the measure calls for
U.N. peacekeeping troops to be deployed in the
region, making possible the withdrawal of the allied
troops that defeated Iraq.
Fighting ended Feb. 28 between Iraqi and allied

armies after Saddam's forces were driven from
Kuwait. But the destruction of much of the Iraqi
ruler's army encouraged revolts by Kurds in north
ern Iraq and Shiites in the south.
France urged the Security Council to get involved
in efforts to halt the civil war, but President Bush
said yesterday he had no intention of permitting U.S.
forces to get involved in Iraq's civil strife.
"I do not want to see us get sucked into the inter
nal struggle in Iraq," Bush told reporters in Florida,
where he was vacationing.
President Francois Mitterrand had said earlier
that the Security Council should condemn Iraq for
its repressive actions against Kurdish rebels or risk
losing political and moral authority.
He said the U.N.-ordered embargo on trade with
Iraq should not be lifted until Baghdad halts repres
sive measures.
Iraq announced yesterday the capture of the
northern city of Suleimaniyah — the last sizeable
town held by the rebels — and a rebel spokesperson
in Syria confirmed the city had fallen.
The spokesperson, Kamal Fuad of the Patriotic
Union of Kurdistan, also said government troops
had recaptured Zakho, on the Turkish border. Iraqi
authorities had announced capture of the town on
Monday.
International relief officials say up to 3 million,
civilians have fled their homes in northern Iraq, and
many fled to the rugged northern mountains, where
they face hunger and exposure.
If Iraq rejects yesterday's resolution, the U.N.-,
imposed trade embargo would continue. The
embargo was ordered four days after Iraq seized
Kuwait on Aug. 2.
Iraqi Ambassador Abdul Amir al-Anbari.
denounced the measure.
"It is the most outrageous violation of the U.N.
Charter," he said. "The Security Council has by far
exceeded its authority, it has acted illegally, and I
believe it is so one-sided that it is going to destabilize
the region rather than introduce peace into it."


Members of the U.N. Security Council vote yesterday to demand the destruction of Iraq's chemical
weapons In exchange for a permanent cease-fire in the Gulf war.
