# Gorbachev accords concessions to coal miners
## 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) â€” The government
granted economic concessions to strik
ing coal miners yesterday, but Presi
dent Mikhail Gorbachev rejected their
demand that he resign, according to an
independent news agency.
The Interfax news agency said the
government agreed to double miners'
pay, increase other compensation and
make more miners eligible for early

retirement. Other, unspecified eco
nomic demands remained unresolved,
the report said.
The miners will consult their work
collectives before deciding whether to
end the monthlong strike, Interfax
said. Miners' representatives who met
with Gorbachev refused to discuss the
issues with reporters.
The strike has grown to include an

estimated 300,000 of the nation's 1.2
million miners and reflected the grow
ing working-class discontent with Gor
bachev and his political and economic
policies.
The strike has forced some blast
furnaces to close, cut heating supplies
to some cities and stopped the delivery
of coke and pig iron to machine-build
ing factories. It also is hurting facto

ries producing nickel, copper and phos
phorus, as well as automobile plants
and railroads.
Miners have beep striking in part
because the Soviet government failed
to fulfill promises of improved living
and working conditions it made to set
tle their last walkout, in the summer
of 1989.
