WHAT WAS ONCE KNOWN
as one of Stanford's easier
majors will be getting a lit
tle tougher next fall.
There was a 'time when a stu
dent completing the history Cul
tures, Ideas and Values track was
well on the way to completing the
history major. One-third of the 10
courses required for the major is
covered in CIV; add some advanced
placement credits and one could fill
half the requirements during
freshman year.
No more. After consulting with
recently graduated history majors,
many of whom found the require
ments too easy, the History
Department has instituted a num
ber of changes. These include
increasing the required number of
courses to 12, requiring more writ
ing-intensive and small-group
courses and dropping the foreign
language requirement.
The department should be com
mended not only for what it did but
for how it went about it. Getting

feedback from alumni makes
sense, since graduates of a depart
ment know best what they wish
they had done. Asking for alumni's
input in making curricular deci
sions is a good use of a valuable
resource.
However, the department has
made a bad move in requiring even
more courses with a non-Western
focus. Stanford students already
take a three-course CIV sequence
and are required to study a foreign
culture in greater depth.
By adding more non-Western
requirements of its own, the his
tory department is jumping on a
trendy academic bandwagon.
There shouldn't be any easy
majors at Stanford. For a depart
ment to have easy requirements
helps nobody: Students in other
majors resent it, and it discredits
the efforts of sincerely interested
majors. Other departments at
Stanford should follow the History
Department's lead.
