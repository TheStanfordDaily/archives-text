# Worthwhile review
## 
### 
ONCE A DECADE, THE Uni
versity comes up for accredi
tation review by the Western
Association of Schools and Col
leges.
Obviously, Stanford is at no risk
of losing its accreditation. But the
association's OK is more than just
a rubber stamp.
This is one of the few chances
the University has to obtain an
outsiders' perspective from a panel
of experts, comprised of faculty and
administrators from across the
country.
Although the reviewers have
praised Stanford's self-study of its
policies, a fresh perspective can
help the University to gauge its
progress in areas ranging from
"repositioning" to multicultural

ism to undergraduate education.
The panel can also draw compar
isons to other universities, as it has
gone through the same comprehen
sive process at schools across the
country.
The review team is talking to
people involved in all facets of
Stanford life and would like inter
ested students to contact them for
feedback on the University. This is
a good opportunity for students to
share their opinions and their
insights on the school's positives
and negatives, and perhaps influ
ence future policies.
We strongly urge the administra
tion to heed the conclusions of the
accreditation board, and to consid
er them in the formation of Uni
versity policy.
