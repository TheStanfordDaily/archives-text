# University charging cost studies to U.S. â€” federal auditors miffed
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
Federal auditors feel Stanford
has added insult to injury.
The University is apparently
asking the government to pick up
part of the tab for new, expensive
cost studies that Stanford must
perform to keep its indirect-cost
rate from plummeting.
Recently, the Navy indicated
that cost studies Stanford had
been using for the last decade
were no longer acceptable. The
studies, which the Navy previ
ously agreed to, allow the Univer
sity to recover more indirect costs
from the government than would
otherwise be possible under fed

eral rules.
Several government officials
have charged that Stanford used
these studies to overcharge the
government by millions of dollars
during the past 10 years. Stanford
denies that claim but has agreed
to conduct new studies to justify
the equity of its charges.
According to letters written by
Paul Biddle, the resident repre
sentative of the Office of Naval
Research, and Robert Lloyd, the
regional audit manager of the
Defense Contract Audit Agency,
the cost of Stanford's new studies
is between $3 million and $5 mil
lion, with additional charges of
several million dollars every two
years to update the studies.
"The costs are neither fully nor
partially allocable to the govern
ment," Lloyd writes in a March 25
letter to Biddle. Lloyd calls the
University's estimate of $3 mil
lion to $5 million "outrageous."
Stanford officials won't com
ment in detail on the issue, saying
they cannot discuss matters
under negotiation. According to
University Counsel Debra
Zumwalt, it is perfectly legal to

charge costs of such studies to the
government.
Biddle and Lloyd don't see it
that way. "That's hogwash," Bid
die said in an interview. "If it's
been done in the past, it was
improper then."
Stanford "is now asking the
government to throw millions
more down the hole," writes
Lloyd.
Biddle's letter, dated March 27,
is addressed to Michael Kuc, the
head of the Navy negotiating team
trying to restore business prac
tices with Stanford. "I would not
allow Stanford such bountiful
plunder from the federal trea
sury," Biddle says.
