## What grapes mean to me 
### 
WHEN MY FATHER CAME to this
country, he started out as a farm
worker in Texas, then headed
west to California. He migrated with the
seasons and worked in places like Stock
ton, Watsonville, Salinas and Gilroy.
I grew up hearing stories about what
life as a farm worker was like. My father
would speak of toiling under the hot Cali
fornia sun from sunup to sundown, for
almost no pay.
To my brother, my sister and myself,
the stories seemed as unbelievable as the
stories other parents tell their children
about walking five miles in the snow to
get to school. Growing up in Los Angeles
gave us little reference from which to
understand him. It took me many years
before I could appreciate his stories.
As I have gotten older and become
more acquainted with the story of other
farm workers, I have come much closer to
understanding my father's life.
Farm workers are one of the most des
titute groups in California. Many of them
are illegal aliens who work for extremely
low wages. They are paid by the bushel,
rather than given a fixed salary, and have
no workers' rights or benefits. Usually,
they are hired by a "contractor" who acts
as a middleman between them and the
grower — and takes a percentage of their
pay.
Farm workers are exposed to danger
ous levels of pesticides and, of course, are
seldom compensated for any injuries that
they suffer on the job. Efforts to create a
union or to organize in any way are usu
ally countered with threats to call the
"Migra" — the Immigration and Natural

ization Service.
This sometimes results in the deporta
tion or detention of all farm workers
involved, regardless of their immigration
status: The authorities carry them all off
and then sort them later. Conditions have
not changed substantially since my father
was a farm worker.
Most people boycott grapes to protest
the danger that harmful levels of pesti
cides pose to the consumer. As of now,
there is conflicting evidence regarding
that danger. However, there is little doubt
that pesticides are very harmful to the
farm workers.
I boycott grapes because I know that
the only power farm workers have is to
appeal to people like me, people who will
try to do their part, however small, by
threatening to affect the agribusiness
man's profits. I don't eat grapes and I
urge my friends not to either, but it is
hard to convince people, especially in the
face of the powerful advertising cam
paigns which the growers set up to get
Americans to eat their grapes.
The organizers of the grape boycott
have little political clout; they represent
the most neglected segment of Califor
nia's population. The California agribusi
nessmen control the strongest lobbying
group in California (that is why they get
all the water). Until now, the boycott has
consisted of a small group of dedicated
people who do what they can to fight the
strongest political lobby in California.
I have read a lot recently about farm
workers' children getting cancer in
McFarland, Calif. Then I am reminded
that I am a farm worker's child, and I

thank God that my father never worked
in McFarland.
Today, my father lives in Los Angeles
and is looking forward to retiring in a few
years. He owns our home in Los Angeles,
which is a source of pride for him, and
lives more or less comfortably. Recently I
convinced him to stop buying grapes for
the family. He didn't know there was a
boycott — well, he did know, he confessed.
He just didn't know if he should support
it. I explained to him that it was to protest
the working conditions of farm workers
and the use of pesticides. He proceeded to
tell me about his youth and his life as a
farm worker and said of course, he would
support it.
Three years ago, my father was diag
nosed with a cancerous tumor in one of
his kidneys. "Very unusual," commented
the doctor, since my father didn't drink
and was still relatively young.
I do not know whether my father got
cancer from the pesticides to which he
was exposed as a farm worker, or whether
I won't get it like the children in McFar
land. But it is hard not to wonder and be
afraid.
