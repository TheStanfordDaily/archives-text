## Donald Kennedy We've learned to hold ourselves to a higher standard 
### 
Editor's note: President Donald
Kennedy recently described the Univer
sity 's position in the indirect cost contro
versy. What follows is much of that
address.
NEVER IN MY TIME AT Stanford,
and that is now nearly 31 years,
has the University been more in
the news. In exactly one week, beginning
on the evening of March 9, Stanford was
the subject of an uplifting "NBC Nightly
News" essay on our initiative to improve
the quality of teaching, then the focus of
a widely reported and damaging congres
sional hearing on indirect research costs
and then — on a Friday night that
should have been the 13th — a mugging
victim on the ABC program "20/20."
There was one other elevating television
appearance: Very late on the day of the
hearing, the men's basketball team beat
Houston on ESPN. But our won/lost per
centage for the week was pretty bad.
The subject of indirect cost recovery is
not newly controversial; it has been so
for years. And it is important: For a
quarter of a century it has been the gov
ernment's policy not only to support the
direct costs of faculty research programs,
but also to reimburse the universities for
those more general costs we incur
because we are in the research business.
All this has attracted interest from
the Subcommittee on Oversight and
Investigations of the House Committee
on Energy and Commerce. Early this fall
its chairman, John Dingell, sent us a let
ter announcing that an investigation of
indirect costs in universities would begin
with Stanford, and assigning the General
Accounting Office to open an audit.
The results are as you have observed.
Information about mistakes in our
accounting systems — some of them, like
the yacht given to our sailing program,
highly embarrassing — have appeared
prominently in the press. So have certain

expenditures for the University-owned
residence, Hoover House, which are
plainly unrelated to research. The media
activity reached a crescendo at the hear
ing itself, on March 13.
We prepared carefully and thought
fully for the hearing, and in technical
terms we performed with dignity and —
I thought — clarity. Now let me tell you
what it was really like.
We did our best to bring forward our
strongest case, in an atmosphere that we
knew beforehand would be highly adver
sarial. In short, we knew we were headed
into the woodshed. But I don't think any
of us quite foresaw the severity of the
whipping. After it was over, we got some
expressions of understanding and even
compassion from the press — but almost
nothing favorable in print, and worse
still on television.
Ironically, the lesson is one we already
know well and observe scrupulously in
other contexts. Our obligation is not to
do all the law permits, but to do what is
right. Technical legality is not the guid
ing principle. Even in matters as arcane
as government cost accounting, we must
figure out what is appropriate and act
accordingly. Over the years, we have not
hesitated to reject numerous lawful and
attractive business proposals, gifts and
even federal grants because they came
with conditions we thought would be
inappropriate for Stanford. Yet, with
respect to indirect cost recovery, we pur
sued what was permissible under the
rules, without applying our customary
standard of what is proper. The expenses
for Hoover House — antique furniture,
flowers, cedar closets — should have
been excluded, and they weren't.
Indeed, this investigation has brought
to light some real infirmities in our
accounting system. Decisions about
which pools draw indirect costs are made
at a macro level, and the person incur
ring an expense has no idea that that

expense will be paid for out of accounts
that draw indirect cost payments from
the government. I should have been
aware of this and corrected the problem.
But while Hoover House expenses clearly
didn't belong in accounts that drew indi
rect cost reimbursements, you should
know that some of the reports about
them have been egregiously inaccurate.
There is one aspect of our testimony
about which I have no regrets. It is our
forceful resistance (which one subcom
mittee member called "stonewalling") to
suggestions of criminal wrongdoing on
the part of Stanford officers. Neither I
nor the University's attorneys have seen
any evidence of deliberate, wrongful con
duct on the part of anyone at Stanford.
The problems that have surfaced so
far, and to which the subcommittee gave
such relentless attention — the Hoover
House expenditures, the mistakes like
the yacht classification and the Stanford
Shopping Center administrative costs —
add up to a tiny fraction of Stanford's
indirect cost reimbursement for the last
decade. Let me say again that this fact
does not diminish their seriousness. But
the attention they have been given
makes them seem symptoms of larger,
possibly insidious problems. Thus we
have been accused of being overly
aggressive reimbursement-seekers in
other areas as well.
In fact, we have been aggressive, and I
believe properly so, in one area — the
construction and renovation of buildings
with private funds for frontier scientific
research. The rise in Stanford's indirect
cost rate over the past decade is due
almost entirely to space-related costs; it
came about not because of administra
tive expenses and parties at Hoover
House, but because we built or reno
vated badly needed science facilities on
campus.
We do have a problem, and we're tak
ing it seriously. In January, I ordered

several actions.
• First, we asked for a thorough
review of those systems by the public
accounting firm of Arthur Andersen and
Co;
• Second, we appointed an outside
advisory panel of distinguished experts
in management, government accounting
and education to review Arthur Ander
sen's work and help us with the imple
mentation of suggested changes. The
panel met in Washington, D.C. last week,
and it was a very productive session; and
• Third, we ordered the removal of all
indirect cost claims submitted for the
operation of Hoover House and two
other University houses for the fiscal
years since 1981.
Now we are taking several new initia
tives as well.
• Arthur Andersen will review all
questioned areas for the years about
which Stanford and the government
have not come to final agreement. They
will work to identify transactions that do
not meet standards of appropriateness
before Stanford makes any further sub
missions of costs to the government;
• Arthur Andersen will also help us
expedite the government audits now
underway, so that they can be completed
and all outstanding issues resolved as
soon as possible; and
• Stanford will undertake a manage
ment audit to determine how we got into
this mess and what should be done to
assure that it does not recur. That exam
ination will start right in the President's
Office and work down.
This situation has obviously been very
difficult for Stanford. As president, I
bear the responsibility for the quality of
what we do, and I owe you an expression
of deep regret and apology that we have
not met our historical standards in this
affair.

far, and to which the subcommittee gave
such relentless attention — the Hoover
House expenditures, the mistakes like
the yacht classification and the Stanford
Shopping Center administrative costs —
add up to a tiny fraction of Stanford's
indirect cost reimbursement for the last
decade. Let me say again that this fact
does not diminish their seriousness. But
the attention they have been given
makes them seem symptoms of larger,
possibly insidious problems. Thus we
have been accused of being overly
aggressive reimbursement-seekers in
other areas as well.
In fact, we have been aggressive, and I
believe properly so, in one area — the
construction and renovation of buildings
with private funds for frontier scientific
research. The rise in Stanford's indirect
cost rate over the past decade is due
almost entirely to space-related costs; it
came about not because of administra
tive expenses and parties at Hoover
House, but because we built or reno
vated badly needed science facilities on
campus.
We do have a problem, and we're tak
ing it seriously. In January, I ordered

several actions.
• First, we asked for a thorough
review of those systems by the public
accounting firm of Arthur Andersen and
Co;
• Second, we appointed an outside
advisory panel of distinguished experts
in management, government accounting
and education to review Arthur Ander
sen's work and help us with the imple
mentation of suggested changes. The
panel met in Washington, D.C. last week,
and it was a very productive session; and
• Third, we ordered the removal of all
indirect cost claims submitted for the
operation of Hoover House and two
other University houses for the fiscal
years since 1981.
Now we are taking several new initia
tives as well.
• Arthur Andersen will review all
questioned areas for the years about
which Stanford and the government
have not come to final agreement. They
will work to identify transactions that do
not meet standards of appropriateness
before Stanford makes any further sub
missions of costs to the government;
• Arthur Andersen will also help us
expedite the government audits now
underway, so that they can be completed
and all outstanding issues resolved as
soon as possible; and
• Stanford will undertake a manage
ment audit to determine how we got into
this mess and what should be done to
assure that it does not recur. That exam
ination will start right in the President's
Office and work down.
This situation has obviously been very
difficult for Stanford. As president, I
bear the responsibility for the quality of
what we do, and I owe you an expression
of deep regret and apology that we have
not met our historical standards in this
affair.

Editor's note: President Donald
Kennedy recently described the Univer
sity 's position in the indirect cost contro
versy. What follows is much of that
address.
NEVER IN MY TIME AT Stanford,
and that is now nearly 31 years,
has the University been more in
the news. In exactly one week, beginning
on the evening of March 9, Stanford was
the subject of an uplifting "NBC Nightly
News" essay on our initiative to improve
the quality of teaching, then the focus of
a widely reported and damaging congres
sional hearing on indirect research costs
and then — on a Friday night that
should have been the 13th — a mugging
victim on the ABC program "20/20."
There was one other elevating television
appearance: Very late on the day of the
hearing, the men's basketball team beat
Houston on ESPN. But our won/lost per
centage for the week was pretty bad.
The subject of indirect cost recovery is
not newly controversial; it has been so
for years. And it is important: For a
quarter of a century it has been the gov
ernment's policy not only to support the
direct costs of faculty research programs,
but also to reimburse the universities for
those more general costs we incur
because we are in the research business.
All this has attracted interest from
the Subcommittee on Oversight and
Investigations of the House Committee
on Energy and Commerce. Early this fall
its chairman, John Dingell, sent us a let
ter announcing that an investigation of
indirect costs in universities would begin
with Stanford, and assigning the General
Accounting Office to open an audit.
The results are as you have observed.
Information about mistakes in our
accounting systems — some of them, like
the yacht given to our sailing program,
highly embarrassing — have appeared
prominently in the press. So have certain

expenditures for the University-owned
residence, Hoover House, which are
plainly unrelated to research. The media
activity reached a crescendo at the hear
ing itself, on March 13.
We prepared carefully and thought
fully for the hearing, and in technical
terms we performed with dignity and —
I thought — clarity. Now let me tell you
what it was really like.
We did our best to bring forward our
strongest case, in an atmosphere that we
knew beforehand would be highly adver
sarial. In short, we knew we were headed
into the woodshed. But I don't think any
of us quite foresaw the severity of the
whipping. After it was over, we got some
expressions of understanding and even
compassion from the press — but almost
nothing favorable in print, and worse
still on television.
Ironically, the lesson is one we already
know well and observe scrupulously in
other contexts. Our obligation is not to
do all the law permits, but to do what is
right. Technical legality is not the guid
ing principle. Even in matters as arcane
as government cost accounting, we must
figure out what is appropriate and act
accordingly. Over the years, we have not
hesitated to reject numerous lawful and
attractive business proposals, gifts and
even federal grants because they came
with conditions we thought would be
inappropriate for Stanford. Yet, with
respect to indirect cost recovery, we pur
sued what was permissible under the
rules, without applying our customary
standard of what is proper. The expenses
for Hoover House — antique furniture,
flowers, cedar closets — should have
been excluded, and they weren't.
Indeed, this investigation has brought
to light some real infirmities in our
accounting system. Decisions about
which pools draw indirect costs are made
at a macro level, and the person incur
ring an expense has no idea that that

expense will be paid for out of accounts
that draw indirect cost payments from
the government. I should have been
aware of this and corrected the problem.
But while Hoover House expenses clearly
didn't belong in accounts that drew indi
rect cost reimbursements, you should
know that some of the reports about
them have been egregiously inaccurate.
There is one aspect of our testimony
about which I have no regrets. It is our
forceful resistance (which one subcom
mittee member called "stonewalling") to
suggestions of criminal wrongdoing on
the part of Stanford officers. Neither I
nor the University's attorneys have seen
any evidence of deliberate, wrongful con
duct on the part of anyone at Stanford.
