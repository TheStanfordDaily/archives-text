## Card women's hoops has reached the elite 
### 
Last weekend, women's
college basketball put on
a party, a celebration of
how far the sport has come in
the last 10 years. And if you're
gonna throw a party, you
couldn't pick a better place
than New Orleans, the site of
this year's women's Final Four.
And, speaking of coming a
long way, what better place for
the Stanford team to signal its
arrival as one of the elite pro
grams in the game?

True, Stanford did much to
establish itself as a national
power one year ago, when it
went to the Final Four for the
first time and won the whole
enchilada. But, as the saying
goes, one championship does
not a dynasty make.
The Cardinal may have won
it all last year, but many on the
national scene saw this as an
almost freak accident. Stan
ford? A women's basketball
school? It must be an aberra
tion — an anomaly, if you will.
As a result, no one expected the
Cardinal to be back any time
soon.
But, lo and behold, who
showed up in New Orleans this
year but the "flash-in-the-pan"
Cardinal. All those doubters
from the previous year had to
swallow their gum.
No, VanDerveer's troops
didn't quite win it all again this
year — but then, neither did
UNLV's men, and the Rebels
had almost everybody back
from last year's dominating
squad. The fact that Stanford
even made it to the Final Four
with a chance to repeat is far
more of an incredible achieve
ment than it was for UNLV.
Consider:
• The Cardinal lost the best
player in the country in Jen
nifer Azzi, who graduated and
took with her a bundle of tro
phies, all-conference and All-
America honors. Irreplaceable.
• Stanford also said a tearful
goodbye to Katy Steding, the
sharp-shooting small forward
who could hit the three-pointer
(led the Pacific 10 Conference
as a senior at 46 percent) and
rebound (better than 6.5 per
game, second on the team).
• Center Trisha Stevens
never came back from off-sea
son knee surgery like she was
expected to, and spent most of
the year struggling to play
through pain. Then, when the
team needed her leadership
most, Stevens' right knee ten
don gave out in the NCAA
regionals. She was done for the
year.
• Power forward Julie Zeil
stra, the other veteran post
player on the squad, played
with pain of her own early in

the year. A cortisone shot to
her bad Achilles tendons elimi
nated the ache for a while in
the mid-season, but the pain
returned with a vengeance at
the season's end.
Consider all that, and then
consider this: Stanford was 4
minutes, 45 seconds away from
a second consecutive national
championship.
Don't ask me exactly how,
even though I was there to see
it happen. I watched as the
Cardinal shook off the rowdiest
of crowds to knock off a moti
vated Washington team in
Seattle by four.
I watched, mouth open, as
the team rallied from 17 down
in Los Angeles without the
injured Stevens to come all the
way back and best UCLA, 91-
77, just one week after drop
ping its first home game in
three years.
I watched in horror as
Stevens went down against
Washington, and in wonder as
Stanford came back to bury the
Huskies and avenge the sea
son's only home loss. Two
nights later, with Stevens on
the sidelines in a cast and Julie
Zeilstra hobbling around on
ankles that should have joined
Stevens on the bench, the Car
dinal up and beat a top-seeded
Georgia team that had already
made reservations for New
Orleans.
As the Stanford Band broke
into "When the Saints Go
Marching In," I watched with
joy as the team cut down the
nets after that game. I saw
unassuming sophomore Val
Whiting mobbed by teammates
as she was named the
regional's Most Outstanding
Player.
I saw the team put the sev
ered net around the neck of
Stevens, who watched on
crutches, and as the players
hugged, I had to blink a few
tears before remembering that
I was there to be objective and
report the game.
I had a great time in New
Orleans, but nothing could top
the feeling of watching Stan
ford go out on the court and
scare the bejeezus out of a Ten
nessee team that was watching
Virginia videos the night before
the game. They didn't have
Stevens, they didn't have Zeil
stra, but they had a unity that
I don't think any other team in
New Orleans, or in the nation,
quite possessed.
They played defense. They
rebounded. They did it for
Trish and Z, they did it for
Sonja, and they did it for them
selves. Because, in the end,
when nobody else gives you a
shot, all you have is your belief
in yourself.
They led with 4:45 to go,
and lost by eight to the team
that won it all. They may not
have Zeilstra back next year,
Stevens and Henning will
never put on the Cardinal and
White again, but Stanford will
be back.
There is no doubt about it.

Last weekend, women's
college basketball put on
a party, a celebration of
how far the sport has come in
the last 10 years. And if you're
gonna throw a party, you
couldn't pick a better place
than New Orleans, the site of
this year's women's Final Four.
And, speaking of coming a
long way, what better place for
the Stanford team to signal its
arrival as one of the elite pro
grams in the game?

True, Stanford did much to
establish itself as a national
power one year ago, when it
went to the Final Four for the
first time and won the whole
enchilada. But, as the saying
goes, one championship does
not a dynasty make.
The Cardinal may have won
it all last year, but many on the
national scene saw this as an
almost freak accident. Stan
ford? A women's basketball
school? It must be an aberra
tion — an anomaly, if you will.
As a result, no one expected the
Cardinal to be back any time
soon.
But, lo and behold, who
showed up in New Orleans this
year but the "flash-in-the-pan"
Cardinal. All those doubters
from the previous year had to
swallow their gum.
No, VanDerveer's troops
didn't quite win it all again this
year — but then, neither did
UNLV's men, and the Rebels
had almost everybody back
from last year's dominating
squad. The fact that Stanford
even made it to the Final Four
with a chance to repeat is far
more of an incredible achieve
ment than it was for UNLV.
Consider:
• The Cardinal lost the best
player in the country in Jen
nifer Azzi, who graduated and
took with her a bundle of tro
phies, all-conference and All-
America honors. Irreplaceable.
• Stanford also said a tearful
goodbye to Katy Steding, the
sharp-shooting small forward
who could hit the three-pointer
(led the Pacific 10 Conference
as a senior at 46 percent) and
rebound (better than 6.5 per
game, second on the team).
• Center Trisha Stevens
never came back from off-sea
son knee surgery like she was
expected to, and spent most of
the year struggling to play
through pain. Then, when the
team needed her leadership
most, Stevens' right knee ten
don gave out in the NCAA
regionals. She was done for the
year.
• Power forward Julie Zeil
stra, the other veteran post
player on the squad, played
with pain of her own early in

the year. A cortisone shot to
her bad Achilles tendons elimi
nated the ache for a while in
the mid-season, but the pain
returned with a vengeance at
the season's end.
Consider all that, and then
consider this: Stanford was 4
minutes, 45 seconds away from
a second consecutive national
championship.
Don't ask me exactly how,
even though I was there to see
it happen. I watched as the
Cardinal shook off the rowdiest
of crowds to knock off a moti
vated Washington team in
Seattle by four.
I watched, mouth open, as
the team rallied from 17 down
in Los Angeles without the
injured Stevens to come all the
way back and best UCLA, 91-
77, just one week after drop
ping its first home game in
three years.
I watched in horror as
Stevens went down against
Washington, and in wonder as
Stanford came back to bury the
Huskies and avenge the sea
son's only home loss. Two
nights later, with Stevens on
the sidelines in a cast and Julie
Zeilstra hobbling around on
ankles that should have joined
Stevens on the bench, the Car
dinal up and beat a top-seeded
Georgia team that had already
made reservations for New
Orleans.
As the Stanford Band broke
into "When the Saints Go
Marching In," I watched with
joy as the team cut down the
nets after that game. I saw
unassuming sophomore Val
Whiting mobbed by teammates
as she was named the
regional's Most Outstanding
