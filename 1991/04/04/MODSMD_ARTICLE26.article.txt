# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
While we rested on Maui, in
Ixtapa and outside Palm Springs
they worked. Hard.
In venues far and wide, Stan
ford's athletes had little time to
catch some rays and catch up on
sleep during spring break. Four
teams, as a matter of fact, were
competing for national champi
onships.
While only one of those
squads, men's basketball, cap
tured a crown — and it wasn't
from the NCAA — the efforts of
those athletes did not go unrec

ognized. With that said, The
Stanford Daily recognizes as it's
Athletes of the Week (Spring
Break Edition) Summer
Sanders and the entire men's
basketball team.
Sanders, a 5-foot-9 freshman
from Roseville, Calif., helped the
women's swim team to a second
place finish at the NCAA Cham
pionships in Indianapolis.
Named Swimmer of the Year
for her efforts, Sanders won
three events — all in NCAA
record time. To start things off,
Sanders broke Tracy Caulkins'
American record in the 200-yard
invididual medley.
The next day, Sanders cap
ture the event she loves to hate
— the 400 IM. Not only did she
continue her mastery over Janet
Evans in the event, but she also
broke the NCAA record Evans
set last year by over two seconds,
finishing in 4:05.19.
To cap off a brilliant meet,
Sanders eclipsed Mary T.
Meagher's collegiate mark in the
200 butterfly while winning that
event.

Men's basketball finished the
season with a five-game winning
streak en route to capturing the
National Invitational Tourna
ment — the team's first title

since winning the NCAA event
back in 1942.
Stanford did it by winning
four straight on the road (after
capturing just three games away
from Maples this year) and five
postseason games.
After winning in hostile Wis
consin and Southern Illinois,
Stanford earned a trip to the
NIT Final Four.
Unintimidated by the hoopla
and a decidedly pro-Mas
sachusetts crowd, the Cardinal

shot down the Minutemen in the
NIT semifinals 73-71.
In the championship game,
the Cardinal met the run-and
gun Sooners of Oklahoma. After
leading early, the Cardinal found
itself trailing by nine with 18
minutes left in the game.
Thanks to the monstrous
rebounding of Deshon Wingate,
the sweet shooting of Kenny
Ammann and the always superb
play of Adam Keefe, Stanford
came back to win the game.
