# Sailors' spring break a smashing success
## 
### Deborah Claymon Staff writer 
Although Seattle was probably not most
Stanford students' dream locale for spring
vacation, for the Cardinal sailors it was just
fine, thank you. Stanford dominated the
Rainier Cup Intersectional, charging ahead of
the rest of the Pacific Coast competition.
Seniors Rick Rosen and Rebecca Bryson
surged past the tough fleet without hesitation
to win the A division. But Stanford showed its
full potential with sophomore Rusty Lhamon
and Senior Sydney Roberts sailing to a strong
first in the B division. Freshman Scott Sellers
and sophomore Britt Johnson were close
behind, taking second in B.
Hawaii and California took second and
third respectively in the 10 school fleet.
Although there was light wind, Stanford
gained great experience towards national com
petition, sailing in 420'2, the boats to be used
at Nationals in New Orleans in June.

'No other team in the country
has such depth.'

"The Rainier Cup not only marks a great
win, but shows the team's ability to sail in any
condition, in any boat and sail well," said
coach Blake Middleton.
After a disappointing first weekend at the
Old Dominion University Invitational Team
Race Regatta, Rosen was especially enthusias
tic about the Rainier victory. "It was a nice
way to end the break and get the team charged
for Pacific Coast Championships," he said.
Stanford's teams of Rosen and Bryson,
along with Geoff McDonald, Dave Dowd and
Paula Gani, and Brady Sih and Matt Dunbar
comprised a competitive contingent for the
team race in Norfolk, hosted by ODU.

However, unusual conditions kept Stanford
from its goal. Stanford finished sixth out of
eight. "Sailing in a fleet of top teams, we just
could not afford to make the errors on the
water that put us behind," said Dowd.
Stanford's next team race regatta will be the
Pacific Coast Team Eliminations April 20-21.
Further battling on the West Coast, Stan
ford showed its depth, placing fifth at the
South Series hosted by USC at the Los Ange
les Yacht Club. Lhamon and Roberts, and
Brett Adams and Britt Johnson managed the
shifty wind conditions in fiat water well,
against a competitive fleet including defending
national champions UC-Irvine.
"No other team in the country has such
depth," according to Middleton. "Back to back,
Stanford was able to sail successfully in three
competitive regattas around the country."
Currently ranked ninth, Middleton is confi
dent that this success not only shows Stan
ford's competitive edge but also the strong
dedication of a top national team.
