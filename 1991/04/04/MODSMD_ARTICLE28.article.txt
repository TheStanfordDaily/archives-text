For the fifth year in a row Stan
ford's synchronized swimming
team finished second to Ohio
State at the Collegiate Synchro
nized Swimming Championships
in Tucson, Ariz.
Considering that Ohio State
has a varsity program with many
swimmers receiving scholarships,
Stanford did exceptionally well for
what was supposed to be a
rebuilding year. Junior Michelle
Ghert said, "Our swimming really
came together at the end of the
season. Routines were really on,
especially in the finals."
In the senior figures, junior
Melinda Downey took seventh
place while freshman Debbie
Downes finished in 11th place.
Ghert, freshman Georgia Bauman
and freshman Kristna Evans fin
ished in 18th, 19th and 21st place
respectively. In the junior figures,
juniors Rekha Rao and Mandy
Schivell finished in fourth and
fifth place.
In the team routines, Bauman,
Schivell, Rao, Ghert, Evans,
Downey and Downes combined to
take third place. Ghert said, "We
really pulled our talent and expe
rience levels together. The judges

Our swimming really

end of the season.'

said our team routine was the best
junior-senior routine they had
ever seen."
Downey finished third in the
solo routines while the duet team
of Downes and Bauman finished
second behind Ohio State. In the
trio routines, Bauman, Downes
and Downey took second place
while Ghert, Evans and Schivell
finished eight hundreths of a
point behind the fourth place
team.
While Ohio State is graduating
its top four swimmers, Stanford is
not losing anyone. Depending on
admissions, Stanford has a good
chance to add to their core of
seven swimmers and again pro
vide some stiff competition for
Ohio State's team of 16.
With All-Americans Downing,
Downes, Bauman and Ghert
returning, coaches Andy Maisel
and Vickey Weir are looking for
ward to another successful sea
son.
