# Stanford's costly controversy
## 
### 
March 6, 1990
Paul Biddle, the resident representative of the
Office of Naval Research, writes a letter to his
superior in the Navy alleging that Stanford's
indirect cost practices during the past decade
had been marred by "fraud" and "abuse."
May 30, 1990
Tipped off by an unnamed source, The San
Jose Mercury News files a Freedom of Informa
tion Act Request, seeking copies of all memo
randa written since 1988 by Office of Naval
Research and Stanford officials on the subject
of overhead charging practices and rates.
Aug. 20,1990
Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., writes Kennedy to
inform him that the House Energy and Com-

merce Commit
tee's subcommit
tee on Oversight
and Investigations
will begin a probe
into indirect cost
practices at Stan
ford. Dingell notes
that he has
requested the
General Account
ing Office to assist
with the investiga
tion.
Late July, 1990
The Navy notifies
Stanford that the
FOIA request has
been filed by the
Mercury News.
Stanford was noti
fied of the request

so that it could exercise its right to review pro
prietary information that is exempt under law
from disclosure.

July 25, 1990
University President Donald Kennedy asks
Internal Audit Director Peter Millington to over
see a review of the University's cost recovery
practices during the last decade. Kennedy says
he is concerned that the audit and negotiation
process with the Navy has not been completed
for several years. A target date of Sept. 28 is set
for completion of the internal audit.
Sept. 12, 1990
The University announces that its indirect cost
policies are being investigated by three federal
agencies: the House Subcommittee on Over
sight and Investigations, the General Account
ing Office, and the Inspector General of the
Office of the Chief of Naval Research. Stan
ford's indirect cost rate is provisionally frozen at
74 percent; Stanford had proposed a rate of 78.
percent for 1990-91.
Sept. 13, 1990
The first press reports of the investigations
appear in the San Jose Mercury News, the San
Francisco Chronicle and The Wall Street Jour
nal.
Sept. 19-21, 1990
Allegations that Stanford overbilled the govern
ment by $200 or $300 million during the last
decade first surface in local papers. The press
reports attribute the information to unnamed
congressional investigators. (Much later, it is
learned the information was disclosed by staff
members of the Dingell subcommittee based
on an estimate made by Biddle.)
Sept. 27, 1990
(Fall quarter classes begin.)
"I do not expect a discovery of any wrongdoing
on our part," Kennedy says in an interview with
The Daily. Later that day, in a speech to the Fac
ulty Senate, Kennedy says,"I believe we have
nothing to fear from a fair and thorough exami
nation."
Oct. 11, 1990
Officials from the General Accounting Office
arrive on campus and meet with Kennedy as
they begin their investigation.
Oct. 17, 1990
The results of Stanford's internal audit are
released to the public. The self-study concludes
there has been no wrongdoing on the part of
the University and that the government owes
Stanford $13 million.
Nov. 19, 1990
"20/20" producer Bill Willson visits Stanford to
determine whether the controversy is worthy of
a segment on the ABC weekly news program.
Willson says he is undecided when he leaves.
Nov. 26, 1990
Provost James Rosse reports to the Faculty
Senate that the University faces an $8 million
operating budget shortfall for the year. The gap
is due in part to the lower provisional indirect
cost rate.
Nov. 29, 1990
An interview with Biddle runs in The Daily. The
story marks the first time the Navy regulator has
spoken to the press since the controversy
began. Biddle details his allegations about
"coziness" between Stanford and Navy officials
which he says allowed the University to overbill
the government.
Dec. 5, 1990
The revelation that Stanford billed the govern
ment for depreciation on the 72-foot yacht Vic
toria is reported in The Daily and The San Jose

Mercury News.
The University
says the billing
was an account
ing error. Dingell
remains less than
convinced.
"Clearly at this
time Stanford
does not even
know what is
being charged to
the government
until the govern
ment identifies the
mischarge on an
item-by-item
basis," he says in
a letter to federal
auditors, urging
them to step up
audit activity on
campus. "I'm very
confident that
we're going to
come up with a lot
of charges like

this," a congressional investigator tells The
Daily.

Dec. 14, 1990
The San Jose Mercury News and The Los
Angeles Times report that congressional investi
gators have discovered Stanford included bills
for a cedar-lined closet, flower arrangements
and the refurbishing of a pianq at Hoover
House in its indirect cost claims. The costs are
part of an accounting pool, part of which is
charged to the government as an indirect cost
of research.
Dec. 18, 1990
The Chief of Naval Research assigns a special
five-person team to examine Biddle's concerns
and restore the Navy's working relationship with
Stanford. The team effectively takes over Bid
die's negotiating responsibilities. Biddle is

named as one of the five
members of the Navy team.
The team will review all the
memoranda of understanding
between Stanford and the
Navy.
Kennedy releases a six-page
statement in an effort to reas
sure the Stanford community.
'We believe that virtually all
transactions will be found to
have been treated in accord
with applicable federal rules,
and under clearly made and
understood agreements with
the government," he says.
Dec. 20, 1990
The Navy's special team
knocks two points off Stan
ford's provisional indirect cost
rate, to 72 percent. The move,
made to protect government

interests while the investigations continue,
costs the University $2.5 million in revenue for
1990-91.
Jan. 10,1991
The Daily reports that the University has hired
two Washington, D C. attorneys to help prepare
for an impending hearing before Dingell.
Jan. 14, 1991
Kennedy says in an interview in The Daily that
the University is considering eliminating contro
versial Hoover House purchases from its indi
rect cost claims. "If there are expenses that are
easily subject to public misunderstanding, I'd
rather get rid of them than take the risk that
we'll lose some of the support we need so
badly to function," he says. Kennedy hints that
improvements may be needed in Stanford's
accounting system. "The presence of an army
of auditors and our own extraordinarily energet
ic efforts to satisfy them has taught us a number
of things — not a dramatic number, but some
things — in our system that we didn't know
about," he says. Kennedy says he's agreed to
be interviewed for the "20/20" broadcast.

Jan. 23,1991
Stanford announces that it will withdraw
more than $500,000 in past controver
sial charges to government. While
insisting the charges are legal under
government rules, the University with
draws all operating costs from Hoover
House and two other University-owned
residences. "We expect this initiative to
put us on the swiftest path toward reso
lution of the Questions that have been
raised about accountability for indirect
federal research funds," Kennedy says.
The University also announces it has
hired Arthur Andersen and Co. to evalu
ate its accounting system and has
formed an outside panel to advise
Kennedy on indirect cost issues. Later
the same day, congressional investiga
tors reveal that thousands of dollars of

antiques, linens, wine, dry cleaning and
catering bills have been included in Stanford's
indirect cost claims.
Jan. 29, 1991
The San Jose Mercury News reports that the
Naval Investigative Service has begun a crimi
nal investigation into possible wrongdoing
between Stanford and Navy officials. The review
was apparently prompted by a letter Biddle sent
to the Inspector General of the Office of Naval
Research. In the letter, Biddle claims there is
"the likelihood of criminal conspiracy, criminal
acts, civil violations and ethics infractions" that
resulted from a "cozy" relationship between
Stanford and Navy officials before his arrival in
October 1988

Feb. 2, 1991
Stanford's decision to hire
public relations heavyweight
Frank Mankiewicz is made
public.
Feb. 5, 1991
Stanford releases a two-and
a-half-inch thick justification
of the study it uses to charge
the government for indirect
costs associated with the
University's libraries. Biddle
and federal auditors had
attacked the study for being
too generous to Stanford.
Feb. 7,1991
The Inspector General of the
Office of the Chief of Naval
Research completes

his review. He dis
counts Biddle's $200 million overcharge
estimate, but says that due to lax over
sight by the Navy, the government may
have been overcharged. The report dis
misses Biddle's claim that Stanford and
Navy officials had been too cozy
Kennedy says he is "quite gratified" with
the report's findings.
In a separate development, the Univer
sity's provisional indirect cost rate falls
two more points, to 70 percent.
Later in the day, Rosse announces to
the Faculty Senate that the University
will likely incur a deficit for 1990-91, per
haps as large as $5.5 million.
Feb. 13, 1991
The Navy informs Stanford that its
library study is no longer acceptable,
Biddle says in an interview with The
Daily. The Navy team found the study
was "so materially flawed" they declared
it invalid, Biddle says.
Separately, the House Subcommittee
on Oversight and Investigations says it

will hold a hearing on Stanford on March 15.
Feb. 14,1991
Revelations surface in the press that a 1987

reception held to introduce Kennedy's new
bride was charged in part to the government
Stanford announces it will withdraw the bill.
Feb. 15, 1991
Biddle alleges that efforts to restore the busi-

ness relationship
between Stanford and
the Navy are tainted by
"coziness." He criticizes
the head of the Navy
team, John Ford, for
being too easy on Stan
ford. Biddle urges that
all memoranda of under
standing between Stan
ford and the govern-

ment be terminated. Biddle's position is backed
by a Feb. 5 letter from the Department of Health
and Human Services, an agency that plays a
similar role to the Navy at other research univer
sities.
Feb. 19, 1991
In a speech to Stanford alumni in Washington,
D.C., Kennedy says the University will likely alter
its accounting system to examine Hoover
House charges on an item-by-item basis. He
says he "should have been more alert to this
policy issue."
Feb. 21, 1991
A second federal agency recommends that all
memoranda of understanding between Stanford
ang the Navy be terminated. A Feb. 13 letter
from the Defense Contract Audit Agency is
made public.
Feb. 21, 1991
Kennedy reports to the Faculty Senate that the
fallout from the indirect cost controversy hasn't
been too severe. "Our friends are still very
strongly our friends," he says.
Feb. 23, 1991
John Ford, the head of the Navy's negotiating
team at Stanford, announces his retirement,
surprising both University and Navy officials.
Feb. 28, 1991
The Navy announces it will begin an investiga
tion into the past performance of Office of Naval
Research officials responsible for overseeing
Stanford.
March 4, 1991
The House Subcommittee on Oversight and
Investigations announces it is moving the Stan
ford hearing date up two days, to March 13.
Separately, the Navy names a new leader for its
negotiating team.
March 6, 1991
A federal auditor claims Stanford is blocking
access to key documents and threatens
Kennedy with criminal charges. The letter, writ
ten by Joseph Riden of the Defense Contract
Audit Agency, is leaked to the press.

March 7, 1991
Kennedy fires back at Riden, the federal auditor
threatening Stanford. "As a former head of a
federal regulatory agency, I think I know what is
reasonable and fair behavior on the part of the
government toward a regulated entity,"
Kennedy says. "This is neither reasonable nor
fair."
March 8, 1991
In an interview with The Daily, Kennedy says he
should have seen this controversy coming.
"Part of the quality of a good chief executive is
that he or she sees around those corners. And,
you know, the stark fact is I didn't see around
this one," he says.

March 13, 1991
Stanford gets pum
meled for its indi
rect cost practices
in a hearing before
the Dingell subcom
mittee. "What we
will hear today is a
story of taxpayer
dollars going to
bloated overhead
rather than to scien
tific research," Din
gell says in his
opening statement.
"It is a story of
excess and arro
gance, compound
ed by lax govern
mental oversight."
Federal auditors

reveal a long list of new unallowable and ques
tionable charges including administrative costs
of the Stanford Shopping Center and the
enlargement of Kennedy's bed. Dingell says
these charges raise a "serious question of crim
inal liability." The Defense Contract Audit Agen
cy recommends Stanford's indirect cost rate be
dropped to 52 percent. "I think this is a very sad
day for one of the world's great universities,"
says Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a 1971 graduate
of Stanford.
March 15, 1991
The "20/20" segment on Stanford's indirect cost
policies airs on the same show as Barbara Wal
ters' interview with Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf.
The show is "20/20's" most-watched in five
years and garners the ABC news program third
place in the weekly ratings. Kennedy subse
quently calls the broadcast "extremely unfair,"
saying Stanford was a "mugging victim" on a
"hit piece "
March 23,1991
In a speech to alumni in Los Angeles, Kennedy
apologizes for the indirect cost "mess." "I take
full responsibility for the management of the
institution, and I am sorry to have let you
down."





March 6, 1990
Paul Biddle, the resident representative of the

process with the Navy has not been completed
for several years. A target date of Sept. 28 is set
for completion of the internal audit.
Sept. 12, 1990
The University announces that its indirect cost
policies are being investigated by three federal
agencies: the House Subcommittee on Over
sight and Investigations, the General Account
ing Office, and the Inspector General of the
Office of the Chief of Naval Research. Stan
ford's indirect cost rate is provisionally frozen at
74 percent; Stanford had proposed a rate of 78.
percent for 1990-91.
Sept. 13, 1990
The first press reports of the investigations
appear in the San Jose Mercury News, the San
Francisco Chronicle and The Wall Street Jour
nal.
Sept. 19-21, 1990
Allegations that Stanford overbilled the govern
ment by $200 or $300 million during the last
decade first surface in local papers. The press
reports attribute the information to unnamed
congressional investigators. (Much later, it is
learned the information was disclosed by staff
members of the Dingell subcommittee based
on an estimate made by Biddle.)
Sept. 27, 1990
(Fall quarter classes begin.)
"I do not expect a discovery of any wrongdoing
on our part," Kennedy says in an interview with
The Daily. Later that day, in a speech to the Fac
ulty Senate, Kennedy says,"I believe we have
nothing to fear from a fair and thorough exami
nation."
Oct. 11, 1990
Officials from the General Accounting Office
arrive on campus and meet with Kennedy as
they begin their investigation.
Oct. 17, 1990
The results of Stanford's internal audit are
released to the public. The self-study concludes
there has been no wrongdoing on the part of
the University and that the government owes
Stanford $13 million.
Nov. 19, 1990
"20/20" producer Bill Willson visits Stanford to
determine whether the controversy is worthy of
a segment on the ABC weekly news program.
Willson says he is undecided when he leaves.
Nov. 26, 1990
Provost James Rosse reports to the Faculty
Senate that the University faces an $8 million
operating budget shortfall for the year. The gap
is due in part to the lower provisional indirect
cost rate.
Nov. 29, 1990
An interview with Biddle runs in The Daily. The
story marks the first time the Navy regulator has
spoken to the press since the controversy
began. Biddle details his allegations about
"coziness" between Stanford and Navy officials
which he says allowed the University to overbill
the government.
Dec. 5, 1990
The revelation that Stanford billed the govern
ment for depreciation on the 72-foot yacht Vic
toria is reported in The Daily and The San Jose

Mercury News.
The University
says the billing
was an account
ing error. Dingell
remains less than
convinced.
"Clearly at this
time Stanford
does not even
know what is
being charged to
the government
until the govern
ment identifies the
mischarge on an
item-by-item
basis," he says in
a letter to federal
auditors, urging
them to step up
audit activity on
campus. "I'm very
confident that
we're going to
come up with a lot
of charges like

this," a congressional investigator tells The
Daily.

Dec. 14, 1990
The San Jose Mercury News and The Los
Angeles Times report that congressional investi
gators have discovered Stanford included bills
for a cedar-lined closet, flower arrangements
and the refurbishing of a pianq at Hoover
House in its indirect cost claims. The costs are
part of an accounting pool, part of which is
charged to the government as an indirect cost
of research.
Dec. 18, 1990
The Chief of Naval Research assigns a special
five-person team to examine Biddle's concerns
and restore the Navy's working relationship with
Stanford. The team effectively takes over Bid
die's negotiating responsibilities. Biddle is

named as one of the five
members of the Navy team.
The team will review all the
memoranda of understanding
between Stanford and the
Navy.
Kennedy releases a six-page
statement in an effort to reas
sure the Stanford community.
'We believe that virtually all
transactions will be found to
have been treated in accord
with applicable federal rules,
and under clearly made and
understood agreements with
the government," he says.
Dec. 20, 1990
The Navy's special team
knocks two points off Stan
ford's provisional indirect cost
rate, to 72 percent. The move,
made to protect government

interests while the investigations continue,
costs the University $2.5 million in revenue for
1990-91.
Jan. 10,1991
The Daily reports that the University has hired
two Washington, D C. attorneys to help prepare
for an impending hearing before Dingell.
Jan. 14, 1991
Kennedy says in an interview in The Daily that
the University is considering eliminating contro
versial Hoover House purchases from its indi
rect cost claims. "If there are expenses that are
easily subject to public misunderstanding, I'd
rather get rid of them than take the risk that
we'll lose some of the support we need so
badly to function," he says. Kennedy hints that
improvements may be needed in Stanford's
accounting system. "The presence of an army
of auditors and our own extraordinarily energet
ic efforts to satisfy them has taught us a number
of things — not a dramatic number, but some
things — in our system that we didn't know
about," he says. Kennedy says he's agreed to
be interviewed for the "20/20" broadcast.

Jan. 23,1991
Stanford announces that it will withdraw
more than $500,000 in past controver
sial charges to government. While
insisting the charges are legal under
government rules, the University with
draws all operating costs from Hoover
House and two other University-owned
residences. "We expect this initiative to
put us on the swiftest path toward reso
lution of the Questions that have been
raised about accountability for indirect
federal research funds," Kennedy says.
The University also announces it has
hired Arthur Andersen and Co. to evalu
ate its accounting system and has
formed an outside panel to advise
Kennedy on indirect cost issues. Later
the same day, congressional investiga
tors reveal that thousands of dollars of

antiques, linens, wine, dry cleaning and
catering bills have been included in Stanford's
indirect cost claims.
Jan. 29, 1991
The San Jose Mercury News reports that the
Naval Investigative Service has begun a crimi
nal investigation into possible wrongdoing
between Stanford and Navy officials. The review
was apparently prompted by a letter Biddle sent
to the Inspector General of the Office of Naval
Research. In the letter, Biddle claims there is
"the likelihood of criminal conspiracy, criminal
acts, civil violations and ethics infractions" that
resulted from a "cozy" relationship between
Stanford and Navy officials before his arrival in
October 1988

Feb. 2, 1991
Stanford's decision to hire
public relations heavyweight
Frank Mankiewicz is made
public.
Feb. 5, 1991
Stanford releases a two-and
a-half-inch thick justification
of the study it uses to charge
the government for indirect
costs associated with the
University's libraries. Biddle
and federal auditors had
attacked the study for being
too generous to Stanford.
Feb. 7,1991
The Inspector General of the
Office of the Chief of Naval
Research completes

his review. He dis
counts Biddle's $200 million overcharge
estimate, but says that due to lax over
sight by the Navy, the government may
have been overcharged. The report dis
misses Biddle's claim that Stanford and
Navy officials had been too cozy
Kennedy says he is "quite gratified" with
the report's findings.
In a separate development, the Univer
sity's provisional indirect cost rate falls
two more points, to 70 percent.
Later in the day, Rosse announces to
the Faculty Senate that the University
will likely incur a deficit for 1990-91, per
haps as large as $5.5 million.
Feb. 13, 1991
The Navy informs Stanford that its
library study is no longer acceptable,
Biddle says in an interview with The
Daily. The Navy team found the study
was "so materially flawed" they declared
it invalid, Biddle says.
Separately, the House Subcommittee
on Oversight and Investigations says it

will hold a hearing on Stanford on March 15.
Feb. 14,1991
Revelations surface in the press that a 1987

reception held to introduce Kennedy's new
bride was charged in part to the government
Stanford announces it will withdraw the bill.
Feb. 15, 1991
Biddle alleges that efforts to restore the busi-

ness relationship
between Stanford and
the Navy are tainted by
"coziness." He criticizes
the head of the Navy
team, John Ford, for
being too easy on Stan
ford. Biddle urges that
all memoranda of under
standing between Stan
ford and the govern-

ment be terminated. Biddle's position is backed
by a Feb. 5 letter from the Department of Health
and Human Services, an agency that plays a
similar role to the Navy at other research univer
sities.
Feb. 19, 1991
In a speech to Stanford alumni in Washington,
D.C., Kennedy says the University will likely alter
its accounting system to examine Hoover
House charges on an item-by-item basis. He
says he "should have been more alert to this
policy issue."
Feb. 21, 1991
A second federal agency recommends that all
memoranda of understanding between Stanford
ang the Navy be terminated. A Feb. 13 letter
from the Defense Contract Audit Agency is
made public.
Feb. 21, 1991
Kennedy reports to the Faculty Senate that the
fallout from the indirect cost controversy hasn't
been too severe. "Our friends are still very
strongly our friends," he says.
Feb. 23, 1991
John Ford, the head of the Navy's negotiating
team at Stanford, announces his retirement,
surprising both University and Navy officials.
Feb. 28, 1991
The Navy announces it will begin an investiga
tion into the past performance of Office of Naval
Research officials responsible for overseeing
Stanford.
March 4, 1991
The House Subcommittee on Oversight and
Investigations announces it is moving the Stan
ford hearing date up two days, to March 13.
Separately, the Navy names a new leader for its
negotiating team.
March 6, 1991
A federal auditor claims Stanford is blocking
access to key documents and threatens
Kennedy with criminal charges. The letter, writ
ten by Joseph Riden of the Defense Contract
Audit Agency, is leaked to the press.

March 7, 1991
Kennedy fires back at Riden, the federal auditor
threatening Stanford. "As a former head of a
federal regulatory agency, I think I know what is
reasonable and fair behavior on the part of the
government toward a regulated entity,"
Kennedy says. "This is neither reasonable nor
fair."
March 8, 1991
In an interview with The Daily, Kennedy says he
should have seen this controversy coming.
"Part of the quality of a good chief executive is
that he or she sees around those corners. And,
you know, the stark fact is I didn't see around
this one," he says.

March 13, 1991
Stanford gets pum
meled for its indi
rect cost practices
in a hearing before
the Dingell subcom
mittee. "What we
will hear today is a
story of taxpayer
dollars going to
bloated overhead
rather than to scien
tific research," Din
gell says in his
opening statement.
"It is a story of
excess and arro
gance, compound
ed by lax govern
mental oversight."
Federal auditors

reveal a long list of new unallowable and ques
tionable charges including administrative costs
of the Stanford Shopping Center and the
enlargement of Kennedy's bed. Dingell says
these charges raise a "serious question of crim
inal liability." The Defense Contract Audit Agen
cy recommends Stanford's indirect cost rate be
dropped to 52 percent. "I think this is a very sad
day for one of the world's great universities,"
says Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a 1971 graduate
of Stanford.
March 15, 1991
The "20/20" segment on Stanford's indirect cost
policies airs on the same show as Barbara Wal
ters' interview with Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf.
The show is "20/20's" most-watched in five
years and garners the ABC news program third
place in the weekly ratings. Kennedy subse
quently calls the broadcast "extremely unfair,"
saying Stanford was a "mugging victim" on a
"hit piece "
March 23,1991
In a speech to alumni in Los Angeles, Kennedy
apologizes for the indirect cost "mess." "I take
full responsibility for the management of the
institution, and I am sorry to have let you
down."





March 6, 1990
Paul Biddle, the resident representative of the
Office of Naval Research, writes a letter to his
superior in the Navy alleging that Stanford's
indirect cost practices during the past decade
had been marred by "fraud" and "abuse."
May 30, 1990
Tipped off by an unnamed source, The San
Jose Mercury News files a Freedom of Informa
tion Act Request, seeking copies of all memo
randa written since 1988 by Office of Naval
Research and Stanford officials on the subject
of overhead charging practices and rates.
Aug. 20,1990
Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., writes Kennedy to
inform him that the House Energy and Com-

merce Commit
tee's subcommit
tee on Oversight
and Investigations
will begin a probe
into indirect cost
practices at Stan
ford. Dingell notes
that he has
requested the
General Account
ing Office to assist
with the investiga
tion.
Late July, 1990
The Navy notifies
Stanford that the
FOIA request has
been filed by the
Mercury News.
Stanford was noti
fied of the request

so that it could exercise its right to review pro
prietary information that is exempt under law
from disclosure.

July 25, 1990
University President Donald Kennedy asks
Internal Audit Director Peter Millington to over
see a review of the University's cost recovery
practices during the last decade. Kennedy says

Oct. 11, 1990
Officials from the General Accounting Office
arrive on campus and meet with Kennedy as
they begin their investigation.
Oct. 17, 1990
The results of Stanford's internal audit are
released to the public. The self-study concludes
there has been no wrongdoing on the part of
the University and that the government owes
Stanford $13 million.
Nov. 19, 1990
"20/20" producer Bill Willson visits Stanford to
determine whether the controversy is worthy of
a segment on the ABC weekly news program.
Willson says he is undecided when he leaves.
Nov. 26, 1990
Provost James Rosse reports to the Faculty
Senate that the University faces an $8 million
operating budget shortfall for the year. The gap
is due in part to the lower provisional indirect
cost rate.
Nov. 29, 1990
An interview with Biddle runs in The Daily. The
story marks the first time the Navy regulator has
spoken to the press since the controversy
began. Biddle details his allegations about
"coziness" between Stanford and Navy officials
which he says allowed the University to overbill
the government.
Dec. 5, 1990
The revelation that Stanford billed the govern
ment for depreciation on the 72-foot yacht Vic
toria is reported in The Daily and The San Jose

Mercury News.
The University
says the billing
was an account
ing error. Dingell
remains less than
convinced.
"Clearly at this
time Stanford
does not even
know what is
being charged to
the government
until the govern
ment identifies the
mischarge on an
item-by-item
basis," he says in
a letter to federal
auditors, urging
them to step up
audit activity on
campus. "I'm very
confident that
we're going to
come up with a lot
of charges like

this," a congressional investigator tells The
Daily.

Dec. 14, 1990
The San Jose Mercury News and The Los
Angeles Times report that congressional investi
gators have discovered Stanford included bills
for a cedar-lined closet, flower arrangements
and the refurbishing of a pianq at Hoover
House in its indirect cost claims. The costs are
part of an accounting pool, part of which is
charged to the government as an indirect cost
of research.
Dec. 18, 1990
The Chief of Naval Research assigns a special
five-person team to examine Biddle's concerns
and restore the Navy's working relationship with
Stanford. The team effectively takes over Bid
die's negotiating responsibilities. Biddle is

named as one of the five
members of the Navy team.
The team will review all the
memoranda of understanding
between Stanford and the
Navy.
Kennedy releases a six-page
statement in an effort to reas
sure the Stanford community.
'We believe that virtually all
transactions will be found to
have been treated in accord
with applicable federal rules,
and under clearly made and
understood agreements with
the government," he says.
Dec. 20, 1990
The Navy's special team
knocks two points off Stan
ford's provisional indirect cost
rate, to 72 percent. The move,
made to protect government

interests while the investigations continue,
costs the University $2.5 million in revenue for
1990-91.
Jan. 10,1991
The Daily reports that the University has hired
two Washington, D C. attorneys to help prepare
for an impending hearing before Dingell.
Jan. 14, 1991
Kennedy says in an interview in The Daily that
the University is considering eliminating contro
versial Hoover House purchases from its indi
rect cost claims. "If there are expenses that are
easily subject to public misunderstanding, I'd
rather get rid of them than take the risk that
we'll lose some of the support we need so
badly to function," he says. Kennedy hints that
improvements may be needed in Stanford's
accounting system. "The presence of an army
of auditors and our own extraordinarily energet
ic efforts to satisfy them has taught us a number
of things — not a dramatic number, but some
things — in our system that we didn't know
about," he says. Kennedy says he's agreed to
be interviewed for the "20/20" broadcast.

Jan. 23,1991
Stanford announces that it will withdraw
more than $500,000 in past controver
sial charges to government. While
insisting the charges are legal under
government rules, the University with
draws all operating costs from Hoover
House and two other University-owned
residences. "We expect this initiative to
put us on the swiftest path toward reso
lution of the Questions that have been
raised about accountability for indirect
federal research funds," Kennedy says.
The University also announces it has
hired Arthur Andersen and Co. to evalu
ate its accounting system and has
formed an outside panel to advise
Kennedy on indirect cost issues. Later
the same day, congressional investiga
tors reveal that thousands of dollars of

antiques, linens, wine, dry cleaning and
catering bills have been included in Stanford's
indirect cost claims.
Jan. 29, 1991
The San Jose Mercury News reports that the
Naval Investigative Service has begun a crimi
nal investigation into possible wrongdoing
between Stanford and Navy officials. The review
was apparently prompted by a letter Biddle sent
to the Inspector General of the Office of Naval
Research. In the letter, Biddle claims there is
"the likelihood of criminal conspiracy, criminal
acts, civil violations and ethics infractions" that
resulted from a "cozy" relationship between
Stanford and Navy officials before his arrival in
October 1988

Feb. 2, 1991
Stanford's decision to hire
public relations heavyweight
Frank Mankiewicz is made
public.
Feb. 5, 1991
Stanford releases a two-and
a-half-inch thick justification
of the study it uses to charge
the government for indirect
costs associated with the
University's libraries. Biddle
and federal auditors had
attacked the study for being
too generous to Stanford.
Feb. 7,1991
The Inspector General of the
Office of the Chief of Naval
Research completes

his review. He dis
counts Biddle's $200 million overcharge
estimate, but says that due to lax over
sight by the Navy, the government may
have been overcharged. The report dis
misses Biddle's claim that Stanford and
Navy officials had been too cozy
Kennedy says he is "quite gratified" with
the report's findings.
In a separate development, the Univer
sity's provisional indirect cost rate falls
two more points, to 70 percent.
Later in the day, Rosse announces to
the Faculty Senate that the University
will likely incur a deficit for 1990-91, per
haps as large as $5.5 million.
Feb. 13, 1991
The Navy informs Stanford that its
library study is no longer acceptable,
Biddle says in an interview with The
Daily. The Navy team found the study
was "so materially flawed" they declared
it invalid, Biddle says.
Separately, the House Subcommittee
on Oversight and Investigations says it

will hold a hearing on Stanford on March 15.
Feb. 14,1991
Revelations surface in the press that a 1987

reception held to introduce Kennedy's new
bride was charged in part to the government
Stanford announces it will withdraw the bill.
Feb. 15, 1991
Biddle alleges that efforts to restore the busi-

ness relationship
between Stanford and
the Navy are tainted by
"coziness." He criticizes
the head of the Navy
team, John Ford, for
being too easy on Stan
ford. Biddle urges that
all memoranda of under
standing between Stan
ford and the govern-

ment be terminated. Biddle's position is backed
by a Feb. 5 letter from the Department of Health
and Human Services, an agency that plays a
similar role to the Navy at other research univer
sities.
Feb. 19, 1991
In a speech to Stanford alumni in Washington,
D.C., Kennedy says the University will likely alter
its accounting system to examine Hoover
House charges on an item-by-item basis. He
says he "should have been more alert to this
policy issue."
Feb. 21, 1991
A second federal agency recommends that all
memoranda of understanding between Stanford
ang the Navy be terminated. A Feb. 13 letter
from the Defense Contract Audit Agency is
made public.
Feb. 21, 1991
Kennedy reports to the Faculty Senate that the
fallout from the indirect cost controversy hasn't
been too severe. "Our friends are still very
strongly our friends," he says.
Feb. 23, 1991
John Ford, the head of the Navy's negotiating
team at Stanford, announces his retirement,
surprising both University and Navy officials.
Feb. 28, 1991
The Navy announces it will begin an investiga
tion into the past performance of Office of Naval
Research officials responsible for overseeing
Stanford.
March 4, 1991
The House Subcommittee on Oversight and
Investigations announces it is moving the Stan
ford hearing date up two days, to March 13.
Separately, the Navy names a new leader for its
negotiating team.
March 6, 1991
A federal auditor claims Stanford is blocking
access to key documents and threatens
Kennedy with criminal charges. The letter, writ
ten by Joseph Riden of the Defense Contract
Audit Agency, is leaked to the press.

March 7, 1991
Kennedy fires back at Riden, the federal auditor
threatening Stanford. "As a former head of a
federal regulatory agency, I think I know what is
reasonable and fair behavior on the part of the
government toward a regulated entity,"
Kennedy says. "This is neither reasonable nor
fair."
March 8, 1991
In an interview with The Daily, Kennedy says he
should have seen this controversy coming.
"Part of the quality of a good chief executive is
that he or she sees around those corners. And,
you know, the stark fact is I didn't see around
this one," he says.

March 13, 1991
Stanford gets pum
meled for its indi
rect cost practices
in a hearing before
the Dingell subcom
mittee. "What we
will hear today is a
story of taxpayer
dollars going to
bloated overhead
rather than to scien
tific research," Din
gell says in his
opening statement.
"It is a story of
excess and arro
gance, compound
ed by lax govern
mental oversight."
Federal auditors

reveal a long list of new unallowable and ques
tionable charges including administrative costs
of the Stanford Shopping Center and the
enlargement of Kennedy's bed. Dingell says
these charges raise a "serious question of crim
inal liability." The Defense Contract Audit Agen
cy recommends Stanford's indirect cost rate be
dropped to 52 percent. "I think this is a very sad
day for one of the world's great universities,"
says Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a 1971 graduate
of Stanford.
March 15, 1991
The "20/20" segment on Stanford's indirect cost
policies airs on the same show as Barbara Wal
ters' interview with Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf.
The show is "20/20's" most-watched in five
years and garners the ABC news program third
place in the weekly ratings. Kennedy subse
quently calls the broadcast "extremely unfair,"
saying Stanford was a "mugging victim" on a
"hit piece "
March 23,1991
In a speech to alumni in Los Angeles, Kennedy
apologizes for the indirect cost "mess." "I take
full responsibility for the management of the
institution, and I am sorry to have let you
down."





March 6, 1990
Paul Biddle, the resident representative of the
Office of Naval Research, writes a letter to his
superior in the Navy alleging that Stanford's
indirect cost practices during the past decade
had been marred by "fraud" and "abuse."
May 30, 1990
Tipped off by an unnamed source, The San
Jose Mercury News files a Freedom of Informa
tion Act Request, seeking copies of all memo
randa written since 1988 by Office of Naval
Research and Stanford officials on the subject
of overhead charging practices and rates.
Aug. 20,1990
Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., writes Kennedy to
inform him that the House Energy and Com-

merce Commit
tee's subcommit
tee on Oversight
and Investigations
will begin a probe
into indirect cost
practices at Stan
ford. Dingell notes
that he has
requested the
General Account
ing Office to assist
with the investiga
tion.
Late July, 1990
The Navy notifies
Stanford that the
FOIA request has
been filed by the
Mercury News.
Stanford was noti
fied of the request

so that it could exercise its right to review pro
prietary information that is exempt under law
from disclosure.

July 25, 1990
University President Donald Kennedy asks
Internal Audit Director Peter Millington to over
see a review of the University's cost recovery
practices during the last decade. Kennedy says
he is concerned that the audit and negotiation
process with the Navy has not been completed
for several years. A target date of Sept. 28 is set
for completion of the internal audit.
Sept. 12, 1990
The University announces that its indirect cost
policies are being investigated by three federal
agencies: the House Subcommittee on Over
sight and Investigations, the General Account
ing Office, and the Inspector General of the
Office of the Chief of Naval Research. Stan
ford's indirect cost rate is provisionally frozen at
74 percent; Stanford had proposed a rate of 78.
percent for 1990-91.
Sept. 13, 1990
The first press reports of the investigations
appear in the San Jose Mercury News, the San
Francisco Chronicle and The Wall Street Jour
nal.
Sept. 19-21, 1990
Allegations that Stanford overbilled the govern
ment by $200 or $300 million during the last
decade first surface in local papers. The press
reports attribute the information to unnamed
congressional investigators. (Much later, it is
learned the information was disclosed by staff
members of the Dingell subcommittee based
on an estimate made by Biddle.)

"Clearly at this
time Stanford
does not even
know what is
being charged to
the government
until the govern
ment identifies the
mischarge on an
item-by-item
basis," he says in
a letter to federal
auditors, urging
them to step up
audit activity on
campus. "I'm very
confident that
we're going to
come up with a lot
of charges like

this," a congressional investigator tells The
Daily.

Dec. 14, 1990
The San Jose Mercury News and The Los
Angeles Times report that congressional investi
gators have discovered Stanford included bills
for a cedar-lined closet, flower arrangements
and the refurbishing of a pianq at Hoover
House in its indirect cost claims. The costs are
part of an accounting pool, part of which is
charged to the government as an indirect cost
of research.
Dec. 18, 1990
The Chief of Naval Research assigns a special
five-person team to examine Biddle's concerns
and restore the Navy's working relationship with
Stanford. The team effectively takes over Bid
die's negotiating responsibilities. Biddle is

named as one of the five
members of the Navy team.
The team will review all the
memoranda of understanding
between Stanford and the
Navy.
Kennedy releases a six-page
statement in an effort to reas
sure the Stanford community.
'We believe that virtually all
transactions will be found to
have been treated in accord
with applicable federal rules,
and under clearly made and
understood agreements with
the government," he says.
Dec. 20, 1990
The Navy's special team
knocks two points off Stan
ford's provisional indirect cost
rate, to 72 percent. The move,
made to protect government

interests while the investigations continue,
costs the University $2.5 million in revenue for
1990-91.
Jan. 10,1991
The Daily reports that the University has hired
two Washington, D C. attorneys to help prepare
for an impending hearing before Dingell.
Jan. 14, 1991
Kennedy says in an interview in The Daily that
the University is considering eliminating contro
versial Hoover House purchases from its indi
rect cost claims. "If there are expenses that are
easily subject to public misunderstanding, I'd
rather get rid of them than take the risk that
we'll lose some of the support we need so
badly to function," he says. Kennedy hints that
improvements may be needed in Stanford's
accounting system. "The presence of an army
of auditors and our own extraordinarily energet
ic efforts to satisfy them has taught us a number
of things — not a dramatic number, but some
things — in our system that we didn't know
about," he says. Kennedy says he's agreed to
be interviewed for the "20/20" broadcast.

Jan. 23,1991
Stanford announces that it will withdraw
more than $500,000 in past controver
sial charges to government. While
insisting the charges are legal under
government rules, the University with
draws all operating costs from Hoover
House and two other University-owned
residences. "We expect this initiative to
put us on the swiftest path toward reso
lution of the Questions that have been
raised about accountability for indirect
federal research funds," Kennedy says.
The University also announces it has
hired Arthur Andersen and Co. to evalu
ate its accounting system and has
formed an outside panel to advise
Kennedy on indirect cost issues. Later
the same day, congressional investiga
tors reveal that thousands of dollars of

antiques, linens, wine, dry cleaning and
catering bills have been included in Stanford's
indirect cost claims.
Jan. 29, 1991
The San Jose Mercury News reports that the
Naval Investigative Service has begun a crimi
nal investigation into possible wrongdoing
between Stanford and Navy officials. The review
was apparently prompted by a letter Biddle sent
to the Inspector General of the Office of Naval
Research. In the letter, Biddle claims there is
"the likelihood of criminal conspiracy, criminal
acts, civil violations and ethics infractions" that
resulted from a "cozy" relationship between
Stanford and Navy officials before his arrival in
October 1988

Feb. 2, 1991
Stanford's decision to hire
public relations heavyweight
Frank Mankiewicz is made
public.
Feb. 5, 1991
Stanford releases a two-and
a-half-inch thick justification
of the study it uses to charge
the government for indirect
costs associated with the
University's libraries. Biddle
and federal auditors had
attacked the study for being
too generous to Stanford.
Feb. 7,1991
The Inspector General of the
Office of the Chief of Naval
Research completes

his review. He dis
counts Biddle's $200 million overcharge
estimate, but says that due to lax over
sight by the Navy, the government may
have been overcharged. The report dis
misses Biddle's claim that Stanford and
Navy officials had been too cozy
Kennedy says he is "quite gratified" with
the report's findings.
In a separate development, the Univer
sity's provisional indirect cost rate falls
two more points, to 70 percent.
Later in the day, Rosse announces to
the Faculty Senate that the University
will likely incur a deficit for 1990-91, per
haps as large as $5.5 million.
Feb. 13, 1991
The Navy informs Stanford that its
library study is no longer acceptable,
Biddle says in an interview with The
Daily. The Navy team found the study
was "so materially flawed" they declared
it invalid, Biddle says.
Separately, the House Subcommittee
on Oversight and Investigations says it

will hold a hearing on Stanford on March 15.
Feb. 14,1991
Revelations surface in the press that a 1987

reception held to introduce Kennedy's new
bride was charged in part to the government
Stanford announces it will withdraw the bill.
Feb. 15, 1991
Biddle alleges that efforts to restore the busi-

ness relationship
between Stanford and
the Navy are tainted by
"coziness." He criticizes
the head of the Navy
team, John Ford, for
being too easy on Stan
ford. Biddle urges that
all memoranda of under
standing between Stan
ford and the govern-

ment be terminated. Biddle's position is backed
by a Feb. 5 letter from the Department of Health
and Human Services, an agency that plays a
similar role to the Navy at other research univer
sities.
Feb. 19, 1991
In a speech to Stanford alumni in Washington,
D.C., Kennedy says the University will likely alter
its accounting system to examine Hoover
House charges on an item-by-item basis. He
says he "should have been more alert to this
policy issue."
Feb. 21, 1991
A second federal agency recommends that all
memoranda of understanding between Stanford
ang the Navy be terminated. A Feb. 13 letter
from the Defense Contract Audit Agency is
made public.
Feb. 21, 1991
Kennedy reports to the Faculty Senate that the
fallout from the indirect cost controversy hasn't
been too severe. "Our friends are still very
strongly our friends," he says.
Feb. 23, 1991
John Ford, the head of the Navy's negotiating
team at Stanford, announces his retirement,
surprising both University and Navy officials.
Feb. 28, 1991
The Navy announces it will begin an investiga
tion into the past performance of Office of Naval
Research officials responsible for overseeing
Stanford.
March 4, 1991
The House Subcommittee on Oversight and
Investigations announces it is moving the Stan
ford hearing date up two days, to March 13.
Separately, the Navy names a new leader for its
negotiating team.
March 6, 1991
A federal auditor claims Stanford is blocking
access to key documents and threatens
Kennedy with criminal charges. The letter, writ
ten by Joseph Riden of the Defense Contract
Audit Agency, is leaked to the press.

March 7, 1991
Kennedy fires back at Riden, the federal auditor
threatening Stanford. "As a former head of a
federal regulatory agency, I think I know what is
reasonable and fair behavior on the part of the
government toward a regulated entity,"
Kennedy says. "This is neither reasonable nor
fair."
March 8, 1991
In an interview with The Daily, Kennedy says he
should have seen this controversy coming.
"Part of the quality of a good chief executive is
that he or she sees around those corners. And,
you know, the stark fact is I didn't see around
this one," he says.

March 13, 1991
Stanford gets pum
meled for its indi
rect cost practices
in a hearing before
the Dingell subcom
mittee. "What we
will hear today is a
story of taxpayer
dollars going to
bloated overhead
rather than to scien
tific research," Din
gell says in his
opening statement.
"It is a story of
excess and arro
gance, compound
ed by lax govern
mental oversight."
Federal auditors

reveal a long list of new unallowable and ques
tionable charges including administrative costs
of the Stanford Shopping Center and the
enlargement of Kennedy's bed. Dingell says
these charges raise a "serious question of crim
inal liability." The Defense Contract Audit Agen
cy recommends Stanford's indirect cost rate be
dropped to 52 percent. "I think this is a very sad
day for one of the world's great universities,"
says Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a 1971 graduate
of Stanford.
March 15, 1991
The "20/20" segment on Stanford's indirect cost
policies airs on the same show as Barbara Wal
ters' interview with Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf.
The show is "20/20's" most-watched in five
years and garners the ABC news program third
place in the weekly ratings. Kennedy subse
quently calls the broadcast "extremely unfair,"
saying Stanford was a "mugging victim" on a
"hit piece "
March 23,1991
In a speech to alumni in Los Angeles, Kennedy
apologizes for the indirect cost "mess." "I take
full responsibility for the management of the
institution, and I am sorry to have let you
down."
