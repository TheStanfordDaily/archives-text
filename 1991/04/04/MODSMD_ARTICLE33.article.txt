# Women's Center plans move
## 
### June Cohen Editorial staff 
Tucked away in a corner of campus, the Women's
Center has gone unnoticed by much of the Stanford
community, its organizers say.
But a long-awaited relocation to the middle of
campus, tentatively planned for next fall, is expected
to raise awareness and use of the Center's resources.
While plans for the move are not yet definite, the
ground floor of the Fire Truck House is the prospec
tive site for the relocation of the Women's Center,
currently located at the Toyon Eating Clubs.
The Fire Truck House now provides office space
for around 200 student groups, including Students
for Environmental Action at Stanford and several
singing groups.
According to Robert Abrams, a member of SEAS,
the Fire Truck House is usually locked and is inac
cessible to both community members interested in
campus groups and those students involved in the
groups themselves. He said most of the groups only
use the space for storage and filing.
For the past three years, members of the
Women's Center have been pushing for a more cen
tral location for the center to increase its visibility
and accessibility to the Stanford community.
"We're hoping that the move will increase aware
ness of and involvement in women's issues among
the wider Stanford community," said junior Jennifer
Pearson, a member of the collective who has been
working on moving plans with the Tresidder Union
Program Board Committee.
"Stanford is looked at as kind of a model for cul
tural centers," said Pearson. "It's kind of notable
that the Women's Center doesn't have a dean and,
while women comprise almost half of the campus, we
just don't have the visibility of other groups."
As envisioned by its members, the relocated
Women's Center would bring all campus groups con
cerned with women's issues together under one roof.
Covering the entire ground floor of the Fire Truck
House, with the exception of one office used by XTV,
the center would include working office space, a

social space with couches and room to show films and
an area that could be used for women's self-defense
classes.
"We're hoping to create a social as well as working
center," said Pearson. "We want to expand and
broaden the services and resources we provide."
"By including all the women's groups on campus,
we hope to attract groups that haven't traditionally
been involved in the Women's Center [to] make it
more pluralistic," said Pearson.
The Center has sent letters out to 32 campus
groups concerned with women's issues that may be
interested in relocating to the Fire Truck House, said
Quynh Tran, coordinator of the Women's Center.
Pearson said the center hopes to house such
diverse groups as the Rape Education Project, the
Society of Women Engineers, the Pro-Choice
Alliance and the University's sororities in the same
office space.
Tresidder has jurisdiction over office space in the
Old Firehouse, the current Women's Center and The
Knoll, and some of the displaced groups could be
houses in the other two locations.
"We're still in the planning and hoping stage,"
said Nanci Howe, director of the Office of Student
Activities at Tresidder.
"We're coming up with a plan which will then be
evaluated by the Tresidder Union Board," said
Howe. "We're trying to come up with a plan that the
groups currently occupying the Firehouse will be
comfortable with."
To insure that the needs of all student groups are
met, Tresidder Union officials sent letters to the
organizations currently using the office space asking
them to comment on the possibility of having to
move out. Responses are due today.
While some concern about alternative office space
has been expressed by those groups, most support
the idea of the Women's Center.
"While the Firehouse is certainly more convenient
for us, it jvould be absolutely no problem to move up
to the Knoll," said Liz Noteware, a member of Mixed
Company, a singing group currently using Fire
Truck House office space.
