## THE
						STANFORD DAILY'S INSOMNIAC WEEKLY 'Blood mixed with salt water is blue' 
### 
This was the best war ever, i mean, don't
get me wrong, World War II was a good war and
all, but it was too damn serious. There were no T
shirts with cool puns on Hitler's name ("One-balled
Fetlrer, Catch Him!"), no Boggle-type drinking games
involving the possible slurs you can make out of "Hiro
hito," no "Nazis Are lust Nerds in Knickers" bumper
stickers.
Then there was Korea and Vietnam and it was like we
forgot how to fight a good war. Even with cool, invigo
rating, aromatic weapons like Napalm, and enemies
with silly names and Colonel Sandersesque facial hair,
Vietnam was no fun.
In the '80s we gave it a go with Grenada, Libya and
Panama, but no matter how exciting it seemed at first, I
seemed to find myself turning back to "Entertainment

Tonight" so I could stare at Mary Hart's gams and mark
down Andrew Rigley's birthday on my official Liz Smith
calendar.
But this time we finally got it right.
When I went home to my suburban town for spring
break, I quickly discovered that my family was not hip to
the resurging, '90s-style, Irvin Berlinesque wave of neo
patriotism. We were the only house in the neighborhood
sans flag, yellow ribbon and quaintly misspelled message
to our returning heroes and "heroins."
Not knowing what to do, I headed off to the mall.
I had always read that war boosts the economy, but
never understood why. After all, if the New World Order
was costing us $200 million a day, how could we possibly
be turning a profit?
But, ah, my friends, I had made the classical eco
nomic blunder; I had failed to calculate Indirect Mall
Profits.
At first, I saw only the mundane. Racks of run-of-the
mill (though often expensive, Perry Ellis), American
flag, "Love-It-or-Leave-It," leftover-McCarthy-era
apparel. Even the shirt with Macaulay Culkin making
that Jonah the Whale "Ohmigosh" face and saying "Bend
over Saddam, here we come" seemed like normal,
charming American wit.
But then I walked into Toys 'R' Us. Toys 'R' Us has
always been a sort of magical place for me, where poles
are painted bright random colors and giraffes named
Jeffrey spell their names funny.
But now Toys 'R' Us was selling Desert Storm Action
Figures and board games, and assured me that the Nin
tendo game would come out before the summer, but
they were still watching tapes of CBS coverage to figure
out how to depict massive strategic bombing without
showing anyone die.
They even had color, glossy playing cards with key
players and vital statistics on the back. I was embar
rassed. Little kids were out there trading two patriots
missiles for a Colin Powell and my parents were too
cheap to invest in a lousy yellow ribbon. I had to do
something.
Driving home I bought a bumper sticker from a guy
who had painted a "q" over the "n" on his leftover "Nuke
Iran" stickers. I smiled appreciatively at his American
ingenuity.
Heck, I thought, turning the radio up, this war is
good for everybody.
This war was even good for the Iraqis. After all, it
wasn't them we were mad at, it was their leader. We were
just helping them out of a tough situation, giving 'em
some incentive and, unfortunately, we had to use a little
force. They would understand.
It was like "Ghost" and "Pretty Woman" all wrapped
up in one. It had real, honest-to-God American heroes;
fat, bald, "look-like-they-should-be-in-a-hammock
with-a-beer" heroes. And a black guy to boot. What
could be more American that that?
As I fastened my four-foot tall "Bart Simpson holding
Hussein's severed head" lawn jockey in place, I realized
what a truly great war it was. I was inspired.
I realized what we needed was another war, a new
raison d'etre, a war just as good as this one. I started to
fax President Bush my ideas. Those pesky Dominican
Republicans could use a good thrashing. Better yet, we
already have a war: The War On Drugs.
Sure, it wasn't as flashy as Desert Enema or Operation
Population Control or whatever it was called, but it
would work just fine. First we'd bomb New York's Wash
ington Square Park. Sure the NYU kids would be mad,
but soon enough they'd realize it was for their own good.
I searched through my collection of "People" maga
zines for more good ideas. Sandwiched between a piece
on Prozac and one on cosmetic ribs someone had
shoved a photocopy of a Lenny Bruce script.
On seeing the bodies of dead Air Force men float up
besides his WWII navy tanker, Lenny Bruce made the
following observation:
"Blood mixed with salt water is blue."
Yeah, but it sure does sting.
Doesn't it feel good to be a winner again America?

When Joel Stein thinks about small, rodent-like creatures,
he touches himself. His column will appear here from time
to time.
