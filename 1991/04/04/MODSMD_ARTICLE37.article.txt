# MIDNIGHT

the ball in plenty of time.

Bowling?

how to score a
Geary and closes at 2 a.m. on weekdays
and 4 a.m. Friday and Saturday.
There are also a few pool halls
closer to campus, such as Executive
Billiards, at 2644 Broadway in Red
wood City, and Town & Country Bil
liards in San Mateo. Executive will stay
open until 2 a.m. when there are cus
tomers, and you can cue up at Town &
Country until 1 a.m. on weekdays and
2 a.m. on weekends.
In addition, there are pool tables all
over campus, from Lambda Nu to
Donner, and they're free. Plus, you
don't need a car to get there.
What? You say you don't like the
idea of a smoke-filled billiard hall full
of strangers? You're the creative, out

doorsy type. You like fresh air, excite
ment, the cold. You live in a co-op, for
gosh sake! Then how about that old
Stanford stand-by, frisbee golf?
You've probably seen people play
ing it, if you haven't done so yourself.
The idea is the same as golf, but the
"balls" are frisbees and the "holes" are
objects around campus, such as the
Thinker, the third bollard from the
right behind the post office and the
circle in the center of the Quad.
While there are a few standard
"courses," created by students past that
have been passed on through the years,
there's no rule to what can or can't be
a hole. Or what is or isn't a legal shot.
Or where you can or can't go. In fact,
there are almost no rules at all.
Except one. You can't play until
midnight, at the earliest.
OK, so what if you're not really into
going out, but you can't sleep at night

because you have too much to do. You
know, you've spent all day doing your
homework, but you still have miscella
neous errands to accomplish. Like
your laundry. You remember, the
laundry? That pile of decaying fabric
in the corner? Yes, that's it.
So? Do your laundry.
But don't settle for the dorm laun
dry room — broaden your horizons.
Bailey's Wash-n-Dry, at 570 North
Shoreline Blvd. in Mountain View, is a
great place to meet other insomniacs
while cleaning your clothes. Open 24
hours a day, Bailey's is a cheery place
to watch your dirty clothes spin
around. And around. And around.
Just a suggestion.
Or, you could finally copy those
notes you've had for three weeks, the
ones your friend wants back for the
midterm next week. Kinko's is always
open, and what better place to photo
copy, fax, make flyers or collate? And
you thought Palo Alto wasn't respon
sive to a college student's needs.
You could even go shopping. Hon
estly! Just because the stores are closed
doesn't mean you can't pick up that
pair of jeans you desperately need. J.
Crew, L.L. Bean and Victoria's Secret
all accept orders around the clock. If
you're lucky, you might even hit a sale.
And does this sound familiar? It's
two in the morning and you realize
you forgot your roommate's birthday.
Don't worry though, it's not too late.
Floating Fantasies, at 421-1639, will
deliver balloons, flowers and singing

telegrams all night long. And if these
things are too mundane, too ordinary,
too inexpensive for you, they also rent
blimps.
No discussion of late-night activi
ties would be complete without men
tioning the college student's favorite
pasttime — eating. And, though it
seems unlikely, there are a few places
to grab a bite after 10 p.m.
For example, Frankie, Johnny and
Luigi, Too is open until 1 a.m. on
weekdays and 2 a.m. on weekends. It's
only 15 minutes away and has pizza
that far exceeds anything Domino's
could whip up in 30 minutes or less.
Not to mention their pasta dishes (like
the Linguine Amatriciana) and their
great heroes.
And don't forget to capitalize on
the generous 15 percent discount they
give Stanford students. All that food
and savings too.
But if it's atmosphere you crave,
where else could you go besides Lyons?
Far superior in quality to its next-door
neighbor, Denny's, Lyons is complete
with poor fluorescent lighting and
vinyl booths.
And the food! Go for the Pyramid
Breakfast — only available after mid
night, it's an absolute must-have.
For $2.95 you get your choice of
any three breakfast items in any com
bination. You can have two French
toasts, two pancakes and a bagel; or
two eggs, two pieces of bacon and an
English muffin. The possibilities are
endless. Go crazy.
