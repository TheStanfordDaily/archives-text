Inspired by the most ridiculous photo to cross our desk in a long time,
we decided to highlight a few new and different theater pieces on cam
pus and in the community this week.
The goofy photo above pictures the stars of "Hitchhiker's Guide to the
Galaxy," a decade-old play given life once more by Menlo Player's Guild.
Witty and off-beat, it opens at the Burgess Theater in Menlo Park tomor
row and runs through April 27.
Another attention-grabbing theater choice is "Did You Come or Fake
It?" a shocking, daring, but safe-sex script presented by Mothertongue
Feminist Theater Collective at Josie's Cabaret and Juice Joint on 16th St.in
San Francisco.
This racy show will be performed April 4-7 at 8 p.m. Tickets are $8-15.
Several plays featuring strong social commentaries are opening or play
ing in the area this month as well.
"Fierce Love," a new play about the lives and times of black gay men is
being performed for two days only (April 5 & 6) by Pan Afro Homos at the
New Langton Arts in San Francisco.
And the struggle of one woman against breast cancer is explored in
"Purple Breasts," a play that his been performed in the Bay Area for some
time. A discussion will follow at Fairchild Auditorium in the Medical Cen
ter where it is being performed.
On the lighter side, "Noserings, Motorcycles and Tattoos," featuring
Dee Russell, is a witty and wry solo performance that explores urban life
with a touch of despair and social commentary.
Russell's show will only be performed on April 17 8c 18, but you can get
your $6 tickets now. Call 626-5416 for information.
Also light-hearted, a one-woman show featuring comedienne Nora
Dunn opens at the Improv in San Francisco on Friday at 9 p.m.
And, finally, closer to home, "Footprints on the Moon," a series of
vignettes on the early days of space exploration, including the pros and
cons of space food, will be presented right on campus in Dinkelspiel Audi-

torium at 2 p.m. on Saturday.
Tickets for this Lively Arts presentation are $6,

Take care and don't stay up too late,
