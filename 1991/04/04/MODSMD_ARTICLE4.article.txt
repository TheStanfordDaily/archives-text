# Waste collection company to run recycling program
## 
### David Miming Senior staff writer 
The Stanford Recycling Center has
merged with the University's on-campus
waste collection corporation, a move
designed to save money and allow more
widespread recycling.
The merger, which took effect April 1,
means Peninsula Sanitary Services, Inc.
will provide the capital and equipment nec
essary to step up recycling efforts, relieving
the University of the funding responsibility.
The corporation has exclusively handled

Stanford waste since World War 11.
The University and the corporation have
come to terms on a six-month contract, dur
ing which the company will assess the
future costs of recycling at Stanford. The
recycling center's total budget for the 1990-
91 school year is $287,000. Of the total bud
get, $151,000 comes directly from Univer
sity coffers.
The move, which was slated to occur this
fall, when the recycling center would have
left the jurisdiction of the ASSU, was
moved up six months because the
Center's program manager, Barb
Voss, unexpectedly resigned.
"In many ways it's a real natu
ral move," said Voss, who left the
University-funded position for
personal reasons the day the
merger was completed. "It's what
I hoped would happen. We've
worked closely with [the com
pany] on a number of projects.
They've also done a curbside col
lection program in the faculty and
staff [residences] and cardboard
collection on campus."
Turning its recycling over to
its waste manager will not only
save Stanford about $50,000
annually by streamlining collec
tion, processing and transporta
tion, but will also result in an
overall increase in the amount of
waste that is diverted from land
fills and recycled.
The latter advantage makes
sense environmentally, but it's
also the law.
Stanford, along with all other
municipalities in California, must
recycle or reduce 25 percent of its
waste stream by 1995, and 50 per
cent by the year 2000, or face stiff
fines. Known as A 8939, the state
law, passed in 1989, has forced
many communities to confront an
issue that is often relegated to the
back burner in times of recession
induced belt-tightening.
One source of additional recy
cling is a new program for high
density polyethelyne plastic. Pri
marily found in milk jugs and

juice containers, the material is
now being collected by the recy
cling center in green barrels
marked for "cans" or at its drop
off center on Pampas Lane off
Serra Street.
The high density plastic
"amounts to almost 30 percent of
the plastics waste stream and uses
a lot of space in landfills," said
Louie Pellegrini Jr., vice president
and general manager of Peninsula
Sanitary Services. "This will sig
nificantly aid Stanford's effort to
recycle 25 percent of all its waste
by the year 1995."
High density polyethelyne is a
prime example of a hard-to
recover, recyclable material that
the recycling center could not
handle before the merger. "Given
the processing equipment we
have, [high density polyethelyne]
is really difficult," Voss said. But
Peninsula Sanitary Services
already has the equipment in
place, she added.
The campus can now add high
density polyethelyne to a recy
cling list that includes glass, alu
minum, newspaper, tin, two-liter
soda bottles, cardboard, white
paper, computer paper, junk mail
and magazines. In addition, the
corporation handles wood waste,
yard clippings, cement and appli
ances.
The merger also eliminates the
duplication and competition that
sometimes occurred between the
two organizations. "[The waste
management corporation] has a
contract that gives it rights to all
the waste at Stanford," said
Sharon Hartwell, data manager at
the recycling center. "With the
onset of recycling, it was harder to

facilitate the cooperation between
us and [the corporation]."
Voss said she sees the merger
as more practical as it will help
recover a larger percentage of
waste.
"At times we were competing
against each other, which is
destructive because [the corpora
tion's waste collectors! know
where the recyclables are," she
said. "It's a lot more unified for
the waste hauler to be involved in
waste reduction."
Before the merger, there were
concerns that the new arrange
ment would reduce the number of
students currently employed by
the recycling center and that the
recycling program would lose its
community focus.
But the corporation has agreed
to retain Stanford student work
ers and has reserved two-thirds of
all collection and processing crew
positions for students.
"One of our concerns is that
students stay involved," Voss said.
"It's a community institution.
The Pellegrinis are a local family,
and as a firm they are ethically
committed to the environment
and recycling."
Voss noted that with the pres
sures of state law and the budget
woes of many California universi
ties, privatization of recycling
may be the wave of the future. "At
a certain point, to be cost-effective
you need to be high-tech," she
said.
Stanford is recycling about 27
percent of its waste, but the
growth of the center has made the
program too large for ASSU book
keeping services.
