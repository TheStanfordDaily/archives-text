# Serving that late-night Lyon's crowd
## 
### Intermission staff 
A familiar face appears from
behind the glass cabinets displaying
fruit pies.
A tall, slim figure in a kelly green
apron stands behind the counter, sur
veying the room silently. His eyes pass
over the usual late-night Lyon's crowd
without reacting. Teenagers with blue'
hair and leather jackets; older couples
with insomnia; workers with night
jobs starting their day; college students
ending a long night. All register the
same disinterested gaze in Kris' slate
gray eyes.
Squinting slightly, his eyes come to
rest on us. Recognizing our faces, he
smiles and heads our way. But we're
not convinced he means it.
Every night owl on campus would
recognize Kris. Most have received
French toast or milkshakes from him.
But few know much about him. He
remains, by choice, a background fig
ure, doing his job and leaving.
Kris (whose full name is Kris
Hansen, but nametag reads SIRK) just
bides his time as a waiter, deriving far
more pleasure from his true passion
and second job: singing in a country
western band.
He couldn't really take time out to
talk with us. He rarely even has time
for a cigarette break these days. But we
caught him for a few short exchanges
as he made his way between the
kitchen and his tables, shuttling end
less pyramid breakfasts to hungry, but
rarely appreciative, customers.
Kris looks rather haggard as he dis
tributes water to the six of us.
Intermission: So, I guess we didn't
pick the best time to interview you. It
looks pretty busy.
Kris: No, probably not.
I: Well, we'll just throw out questions
as wc go. We can hang for quite awhile.
K: Just a moment, I'll be back.
He departs.
I: So it's going pretty well so far, I
think.
Kris returns, pen in hand, to take
our orders.
K: Are you going to have your usual?
I: Actually, I'm going to have my alter
nate usual.
K: Your alternate usual? I don't
remember which one that was.

I: That would be the wimpy pyramid.
K: The wimpy pyramid. Oh, yes, that's
the bagel, fruit and orange juice.
I: Exactly.... How do you like being a
waiter at Lyon's?
K: How do I like being a waiter? I
don't.
I: Good answer. Good answer.
Perhaps, as our format, after each
person orders, he can throw in a ques
tion.
K: OK.
I: I'll have French toast, bacon and
orange juice ... and, do you ever get
any sleep?
K: No, I don't. I didn't get much sleep
today. I only had 23 hours...
I: Twenty-three hours of sleep!
K: No, 1 was up 23 hours yesterday.
And the neighbor lady decided to have
a child care center in there right
behind my window.
I: So when do you sleep?
K: When I get off in the morning I try
to. Today I was not successful.
I: How long have you been a waiter?
K: Three-and-a-half years.
I: We're going to try to squeeze in
another question.
K: Yeah, go ahead.
I: Have you ever spilled any food or
drink on the lap of one of your cus
tomers?
K: Yery close to it. I had a fruit cup,
which is top heavy, and went to lay it
down and this lady was pretty well
dressed up. I was working day shift
then. It toppled over. Fortunately, she
was quick and caught it.
I: Were you embarassed about that?
K: Yeah, I turned about three (shades)
of red.
I: Did she give you a decent tip?
K: Apparently not beause I don't
remember it. (laughs)
I: What's the largest tip you've ever
gotten, aside from us?
K: Ah, a $10 tip from a fairly large
party.
I: So it wasn't really that good of a tip.
K: It was average. I don't get great tips
basically because of my attitude. I'm
too serious most of the time.

I: Do students tip better than the aver
age, or worse?
K: Um, they're varied. It's all varied
right across the board, from the
wealthy to the poor. In fact, I've
noticed the poor people, the people
who are really hurting, who don't have

much to call their own or whatever,
they tend to tip more than the people
with a lot of money, the people driving
the Cadillacs and with the big dia
mond rings — that's the reason they
got them, because they don't tip.
(laughs)

I: It's really not that bad. Have you ever
eaten Lyon's' food?
K: Have I ever eaten Lyon's' food? Yes,
out of necessity They only cost me 30
cents an hour out of my wages. So I eat
two meals a day here.
I: So what's your favorite?
K: (laughing) Well, I'm so sick of it all
I don't have a favorite anymore. Lately
my favorite's been chicken pasta.
I: Wliat's the weirdest thing that's ever
happened to you on the night shift?
K: On the night shift? The weirdest
thing? One time I hadn't been here 10
minutes and I put a blueberry muffin
on the cook's window — that's the area
where the cooks put the food. You
know I put a blueberry muffin there
because I was going to go pick up later.
1 was taking care of other orders. So
when I went to go pick it up it was
gone and I hit the ceiling and the walls
and the windows. And they had to sus
pend me for a couple days. That was
probably the first winter when I was
here.
I: So who took it?
K: I really don't know to this day. I
have a feeling one of the cooks took it.
I: Were they trying to get on your
nerves?
K: Maybe they were just hungry ...
I: Can you usually tell if your cus
tomers are Stanford students? Are
there identifying characteristics?
K: Well, yeah, sort of.
I: Such as?
K: They bring their books in. (laughs)
I: Have you heard about the indirect
cost controversy at Stanford?
Kris hadn't heard of the whole indi
rect cost thing. He headed back to the
kitchen to pick up orders. We sum
moned another night shift waiter, Rus
sell, over to the table.
I: Could you talk a little bit about what
it's like working with Kris?
Russell: Oh, it's pretty good. He's
always busy. He's always doing the best
he can. He's a pretty good waiter,
except for he doesn't like being a
waiter.
I: Does that show?
R: A little bit, yeah. Yeah, but I mean
he's a good waiter. I mean it kinda
shows. Have you ever noticed how he's
not, like, really joyful?

I: Well he usually is around us.
R: Well, yeah. Certain people. Right.
Russell leaves and Kris returns, laden
down with breakfast fare.
I: Is it in vogue today not to write stuff
down? It seems a lot of people are
doing that.
K: I don't know. I haven't seen that
myself.
I: Who's your favorite musical per
former?
K: I like Conway Twitty.
I: Are there any performers you think
are terrible? What about Madonna?
Would you ever do a Madonna song ?
K: No. At least not in her range
(laughs).
I: Did you want to be a singer since you
were young?
K: Yes.
I: Did you have an idol?
K: I've had a number of them through
out the years ... I didn't really turn
solid country until after I got married.
I: Do you get a lot of really weird peo
ple coming in here in the middle of the
night?
K: Yeah, we get all kinds of people.
I: Like us, for instance. Are there peo
pie you find really anoying?
K: Yes. No. I mean yes.
I: Are there some regulars you say, 'Oh
no, not them again,' to yourself when
they show up?
K: Oh, yeah. Then there's times when I
go up to somebody and say, 'Oh, how
are you doing,' and I'm smiling, but
I'm really gritting my teeth. It's not
necessarily because of the person
themself. It's because I don't feel like
waiting on another customer at that
moment.
I: Have you ever done that with us?
K: Uh, no (laughs). Well, actually,
there have been a few times in the past
— it hasn't happened lately. I used to
have time at the counter, to sit at the
counter and smoke. If I didn't fee;
had sat down long enough and some
body walked in — it doesn't matte
who it is, whether it's a regular who I
have good terms with or whoever. I get
teed off.

behind my window.
I: So when do you sleep?
K: When I get off in the morning I try
to. Today I was not successful.
I: How long have you been a waiter?
K: Three-and-a-half years.
I: We're going to try to squeeze in
another question.
K: Yeah, go ahead.
I: Have you ever spilled any food or
drink on the lap of one of your cus
tomers?
K: Yery close to it. I had a fruit cup,
which is top heavy, and went to lay it
down and this lady was pretty well
dressed up. I was working day shift
then. It toppled over. Fortunately, she
was quick and caught it.
I: Were you embarassed about that?
K: Yeah, I turned about three (shades)
of red.
I: Did she give you a decent tip?
K: Apparently not beause I don't
remember it. (laughs)
I: What's the largest tip you've ever
gotten, aside from us?
K: Ah, a $10 tip from a fairly large
party.
I: So it wasn't really that good of a tip.
K: It was average. I don't get great tips
basically because of my attitude. I'm
too serious most of the time.

I: Do students tip better than the aver
age, or worse?
K: Um, they're varied. It's all varied
right across the board, from the
wealthy to the poor. In fact, I've
noticed the poor people, the people
who are really hurting, who don't have

much to call their own or whatever,
they tend to tip more than the people
with a lot of money, the people driving
the Cadillacs and with the big dia
mond rings — that's the reason they
got them, because they don't tip.
(laughs)

I: It's really not that bad. Have you ever
eaten Lyon's' food?
K: Have I ever eaten Lyon's' food? Yes,
out of necessity They only cost me 30
cents an hour out of my wages. So I eat
two meals a day here.
I: So what's your favorite?
K: (laughing) Well, I'm so sick of it all
I don't have a favorite anymore. Lately
my favorite's been chicken pasta.
I: Wliat's the weirdest thing that's ever
happened to you on the night shift?
K: On the night shift? The weirdest
thing? One time I hadn't been here 10
minutes and I put a blueberry muffin
on the cook's window — that's the area
where the cooks put the food. You
know I put a blueberry muffin there
because I was going to go pick up later.
1 was taking care of other orders. So
when I went to go pick it up it was
gone and I hit the ceiling and the walls
and the windows. And they had to sus
pend me for a couple days. That was
probably the first winter when I was
here.
I: So who took it?
K: I really don't know to this day. I
have a feeling one of the cooks took it.
I: Were they trying to get on your
nerves?
K: Maybe they were just hungry ...
I: Can you usually tell if your cus
tomers are Stanford students? Are
there identifying characteristics?
K: Well, yeah, sort of.
I: Such as?
K: They bring their books in. (laughs)
I: Have you heard about the indirect
cost controversy at Stanford?
Kris hadn't heard of the whole indi
rect cost thing. He headed back to the
kitchen to pick up orders. We sum
moned another night shift waiter, Rus
sell, over to the table.
I: Could you talk a little bit about what
it's like working with Kris?
Russell: Oh, it's pretty good. He's
always busy. He's always doing the best
he can. He's a pretty good waiter,
except for he doesn't like being a
waiter.
I: Does that show?
R: A little bit, yeah. Yeah, but I mean
he's a good waiter. I mean it kinda
shows. Have you ever noticed how he's
not, like, really joyful?

I: Well he usually is around us.
R: Well, yeah. Certain people. Right.
Russell leaves and Kris returns, laden
down with breakfast fare.
I: Is it in vogue today not to write stuff
down? It seems a lot of people are
doing that.
K: I don't know. I haven't seen that
myself.
I: Who's your favorite musical per
former?
K: I like Conway Twitty.
I: Are there any performers you think
are terrible? What about Madonna?
Would you ever do a Madonna song ?
K: No. At least not in her range
(laughs).
I: Did you want to be a singer since you
were young?
K: Yes.
I: Did you have an idol?
K: I've had a number of them through
out the years ... I didn't really turn
solid country until after I got married.
I: Do you get a lot of really weird peo
ple coming in here in the middle of the
night?
K: Yeah, we get all kinds of people.
I: Like us, for instance. Are there peo
pie you find really anoying?
K: Yes. No. I mean yes.
I: Are there some regulars you say, 'Oh
no, not them again,' to yourself when
they show up?
K: Oh, yeah. Then there's times when I
go up to somebody and say, 'Oh, how
are you doing,' and I'm smiling, but
I'm really gritting my teeth. It's not
necessarily because of the person
themself. It's because I don't feel like
waiting on another customer at that
moment.
I: Have you ever done that with us?
K: Uh, no (laughs). Well, actually,
there have been a few times in the past
— it hasn't happened lately. I used to
have time at the counter, to sit at the
counter and smoke. If I didn't fee;
had sat down long enough and some
body walked in — it doesn't matte
who it is, whether it's a regular who I
have good terms with or whoever. I get
teed off.

Omelets, pancakes, french fries, milkshakes. It's all in a night's work for Kris
Hansen, Lyon's most recognizable late night waiter.
A familiar face appears from
behind the glass cabinets displaying
fruit pies.
A tall, slim figure in a kelly green
apron stands behind the counter, sur
veying the room silently. His eyes pass
over the usual late-night Lyon's crowd
without reacting. Teenagers with blue'
hair and leather jackets; older couples
with insomnia; workers with night
jobs starting their day; college students
ending a long night. All register the
same disinterested gaze in Kris' slate
gray eyes.
Squinting slightly, his eyes come to
rest on us. Recognizing our faces, he
smiles and heads our way. But we're
not convinced he means it.
Every night owl on campus would
recognize Kris. Most have received
French toast or milkshakes from him.
But few know much about him. He
remains, by choice, a background fig
ure, doing his job and leaving.
Kris (whose full name is Kris
Hansen, but nametag reads SIRK) just
bides his time as a waiter, deriving far
more pleasure from his true passion
and second job: singing in a country
western band.
He couldn't really take time out to
talk with us. He rarely even has time
for a cigarette break these days. But we
caught him for a few short exchanges
as he made his way between the
kitchen and his tables, shuttling end
less pyramid breakfasts to hungry, but
rarely appreciative, customers.
Kris looks rather haggard as he dis
tributes water to the six of us.
Intermission: So, I guess we didn't
pick the best time to interview you. It
looks pretty busy.
Kris: No, probably not.
I: Well, we'll just throw out questions
as wc go. We can hang for quite awhile.
K: Just a moment, I'll be back.
He departs.
I: So it's going pretty well so far, I
think.
Kris returns, pen in hand, to take
our orders.
K: Are you going to have your usual?
I: Actually, I'm going to have my alter
nate usual.
K: Your alternate usual? I don't
remember which one that was.

I: That would be the wimpy pyramid.
K: The wimpy pyramid. Oh, yes, that's
the bagel, fruit and orange juice.
I: Exactly.... How do you like being a
waiter at Lyon's?
K: How do I like being a waiter? I
don't.
I: Good answer. Good answer.
Perhaps, as our format, after each
person orders, he can throw in a ques
tion.
K: OK.
I: I'll have French toast, bacon and
orange juice ... and, do you ever get
any sleep?
K: No, I don't. I didn't get much sleep
today. I only had 23 hours...
I: Twenty-three hours of sleep!
K: No, 1 was up 23 hours yesterday.
And the neighbor lady decided to have

pend me for a couple days. That was
probably the first winter when I was
here.
I: So who took it?
K: I really don't know to this day. I
have a feeling one of the cooks took it.
I: Were they trying to get on your
nerves?
K: Maybe they were just hungry ...
I: Can you usually tell if your cus
tomers are Stanford students? Are
there identifying characteristics?
K: Well, yeah, sort of.
I: Such as?
K: They bring their books in. (laughs)
I: Have you heard about the indirect
cost controversy at Stanford?
Kris hadn't heard of the whole indi
rect cost thing. He headed back to the
kitchen to pick up orders. We sum
moned another night shift waiter, Rus
sell, over to the table.
I: Could you talk a little bit about what
it's like working with Kris?
Russell: Oh, it's pretty good. He's
always busy. He's always doing the best
he can. He's a pretty good waiter,
except for he doesn't like being a
waiter.
I: Does that show?
R: A little bit, yeah. Yeah, but I mean
he's a good waiter. I mean it kinda
shows. Have you ever noticed how he's
not, like, really joyful?

I: Well he usually is around us.
R: Well, yeah. Certain people. Right.
Russell leaves and Kris returns, laden
down with breakfast fare.
I: Is it in vogue today not to write stuff
down? It seems a lot of people are
doing that.
K: I don't know. I haven't seen that
myself.
I: Who's your favorite musical per
former?
K: I like Conway Twitty.
I: Are there any performers you think
are terrible? What about Madonna?
Would you ever do a Madonna song ?
K: No. At least not in her range
(laughs).
I: Did you want to be a singer since you
were young?
K: Yes.
I: Did you have an idol?
K: I've had a number of them through
out the years ... I didn't really turn
solid country until after I got married.
I: Do you get a lot of really weird peo
ple coming in here in the middle of the
night?
K: Yeah, we get all kinds of people.
I: Like us, for instance. Are there peo
pie you find really anoying?
K: Yes. No. I mean yes.
I: Are there some regulars you say, 'Oh
no, not them again,' to yourself when
they show up?
K: Oh, yeah. Then there's times when I
go up to somebody and say, 'Oh, how
are you doing,' and I'm smiling, but
I'm really gritting my teeth. It's not
necessarily because of the person
themself. It's because I don't feel like
waiting on another customer at that
moment.
I: Have you ever done that with us?
K: Uh, no (laughs). Well, actually,
there have been a few times in the past
— it hasn't happened lately. I used to
have time at the counter, to sit at the
counter and smoke. If I didn't fee;
had sat down long enough and some
body walked in — it doesn't matte
who it is, whether it's a regular who I
have good terms with or whoever. I get
teed off.
