A glimpse
inside 'open
door' China
"Iron and Silk," starring Mark
Salzman, Pan Qingfu and
Vivian Wu
"Iron and Silk" is an odd little
movie that borders on being really
dorky. However, its insightful story set
during China's "open door" period
sustains one's interest and somewhat
redeems the film.
The movie is based on a book by
Mark Salzman, who stars in the pro
duction. The plot details Salzman's
experience as an English teacher and
karate student in China from 1982-84.
This Yale graduate's blonde hair and
bright blue eyes distinctly mark him as
a foreigner wherever he goes, and he
soon learns that the cultural differ
ences between the East and the West
are still too deep to override.
So far, so good. Interesting "true
story" plot, lots of impressive-looking
kung-fu moves, cool music ... What
more could you ask for in a movie?
How about believable acting?
Yup, that's pretty important. I don't
think I realized how important until I
saw Salzman and other characters on
the screen delivering lines that lacked a
subtlety akin to a bunch of fourth

graders in their first play.
Director Shirley Sun (a Stanford
graduate) also made the questionable
decision to cast Salzman's English stu
dents from real-life Chinese English
students. Again, an appealing idea
with a disastrous result. The student's
overexaggerated reactions may annoy
even the most passive of moviegoers.
Despite all its obvious problems,
"Iron and Silk" is still a likable film
with educational value. The fact that
its filming was completed in 1989, only
one day before government troops
marched into Tiananmen Square,
makes its message especially poignant.
If anything, the film is valuable for giv
ing us our last glimpse into a now
restricted China.

Courtroom pits
father against
daughter
"Class Action," starring Gene
Hackman and Mary Elizabeth
Mastrantonio
So "Class Action" is slightly on the
predictable side. It's a typical Holly
wood formula picture, happy ending
and all.
You'll feel manipulated by the
seemingly endless tragedies that befall

the main characters. But you'll cry
anyway, if you have a tendency toward
such blatant sentimental displays of
emotion. And against your better
judgment you will like this film — it's

sort of the "Pretty Woman" syndrome.
Michael Apted directed this court
room drama that pits father against
daughter in a class action suit that
revolves around defectively produced

cars that explode upon impact. But,
when the verdict comes in, more than
the legal issue is resolved.
Gene Hackman is the gritty legal
defender. As a former hippie and civil
liberties activist, he has devoted his life
to fighting for the rights of the injured,
jilted and ignored. But oftentimes he
has neglected the wants and needs of
his family in the process.
Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio plays
the daughter, a tough corporate lawyer
with intense feelings of hostility
toward her father. And she wants more
than a victory for the defense. She aims
to beat her father at his own legal game
while getting revenge for his years of
infidelity to her mother.
The plot is trite at times, but the
performances by Hackman and Mas
trantonio are compelling. And while
the story focuses on the relationship
between the father and daughter, the
courtroom action proves to be the
most interesting.
But, a new dimension is added to
the commonplace theme of good ver
sus evil when father must fight against
daughter in front of the judge. Sure,
the good guys win. But you could have
guessed that. It's a movie, after all.

Hollywood and
the red scare
'Guilty by Suspicion," starring
Robert De Niro, George Wendt
and Annette Bening
In the '50s, the Cold War was being
fought in the United States. Anti-com
munist hysteria was at its peak when
the House Committee on Un-Ameri
can Activities decided to undertake a
full-scale investigation of communism

in motion pictures. Some 40 filmmak
ers suspected of leftist sympathies were
subpoenaed to prove their patriotism
by naming people in Hollywood who,
the committee claimed, were commu
nists.
"Guilty by Suspicion" recreates this
humiliating era when filmmakers were
forced to inform on their spouses and
friends in order to stay off of the black
list and continue working in Holly
wood. The anguish experienced by the
film community is personified by
Robert De Niro, who plays an up-and
coming director.
When DeNiro comes under investi
gation for being a member of the
Communist Party, he is torn between
betraying the trust of his friends and
giving into the pressure of the com
mittee. The unsubstantiated claims
made by the committee serve to
destroy his career.
Irwin Winkler makes his directorial
debut with this tragic depiction of the
exploitation of anti-communist hyste
ria. He skillfully and frighteningly
details the panic created in the indus
try by the threat of state censorship.
Annette Bening plays De Niro's
lcval and understanding ex-wife. Her
life is also turned upside down as she is
forced to watch her friends and family
suffer through this fearful time.
"Guilty by Suspicion" is a gripping
account of the terror experienced by
the film community in the face of
threatening state censorship. The
anguish and despair exhibited in De
Niro's performance is chilling. You'll
leave the theater cherishing your First
Amendment rights but suspicious of
the government's ability to usurp them
on a whim.
