Stranger in a Strange Land
Robert A. Heinlein
G.P. Putnam's Sons, 525 pages,
$24.95
When a shorter version of
this novel was first published in
the 1960s, it attracted an enor
mous readership, and its popu
larity has continued.
Unfortunately, Heinlein, like
most acclaimed science fiction
authors, has a poor grasp of
style. And this earlier, longer
version is even preachier than
the first. Still, "Stranger in a
Strange Land" has an appeal all
its own.
The Ghost From the Grand
Banks
Arthur C. Clarke
Spectra, 274 pages, $19.95
One of the most respected
science fiction writers today,
Arthur C. Clarke has kept him
self busy since creating "2010,"
writing other upbeat novels.
Clarke's latest work involves
two competing technological
schemes designed to raise the
Titanic from the ocean depths.
