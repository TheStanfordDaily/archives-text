"A Man Without Words" is the
story of the frustration, the determina
tion and the ultimate triumph of Ilde
fonso, a man with no knowledge of
spoken, signed or written language, or
even of the concept of language.
Born deaf and raised in the poverty
of rural Mexico, Ildefonso was consid
ered a "dummy" by his own parents.
Thus, despite his intelligence and
desire to learn to communicate, he was
not allowed to attend school and
instead was forced to work and beg for
money to help support his family.
Ildefonso remained locked in his
prison of silence and solitude for 27
years, using only spontaneous gestures
to convey his most basic needs. Then
he met Susan Schaller. Schaller, a pub
lic health educator fluent in American
Sign Language, had taken a temporary
position as an interpreter for a reading
class for deaf students at a Los Angeles
community college.
Upon her arrival, Schaller encoun
tered a chaotic classroom filled with
students at various levels of language
competence. But her attention was
immediately drawn to the dark and
silent figure sitting in the corner. She
began the seemingly impossible task of
introducing Ildefonso to the magical
beauty and complexity of language.

Although Schaller is neither deaf
nor a linguist, the combination of her
own curiosity, patience and dedica
tion, and most importantly, her sin
cere concern for Ildefonso, provided
the motivation and the ingenuity nec
essary to achieve such a formidable
task.
In "A Man Without Words,"
Schaller narrates the story of this long
and difficult process from the point of
view not only of Ildefonso's teacher
but also of his friend. She shares in his
agony and frustration, she tries con
stantly to imagine his lonely world of
utter silence, a world devoid of the
labels and concepts that are so com
fortingly familiar to those who have
grown up surrounded by language.
Schaller also experiences the joy
and excitement of Ildefonso's success,
and she describes his accomplishments
in an engaging style full of vivid
images and powerful metaphors.
Despite such brilliant moments,
Ildefonso's journey remained arduous
and his progress painstakingly slow. At
times he expressed anger and resent
ment at having been denied access to
language for so many years, and he was
often mystified by the evils of the
world introduced to him through signs
and symbols.
Schaller often questioned her own
role in this painful process, wondering
if Ildefonso's loss of innocence and his
struggle to emerge from his isolated
yet sheltering refuge was justifiable or
even humane. She was reassured by

Ildefonso's eagerness and persistence,
which affirmed that the benefits of her
help far outweighed any of the neces
sary harms.
After working together for a
semester, personal and professional
circumstances forced Schaller and
Ildefonso to go their separate ways.
However, Schaller pursued her interest
in "languageless" adults. Only after she
had already succeeded in teaching sign
language to Ildefonso did she become
aware of linguistic theories claiming it
was impossible for people to truly
learn language beyond adolescence.
To the contrary, Schaller returned
to California seven years later to find
that Ildefonso had defied the theories
and had become a fluent signer. He
then introduced her to his brother
Mario and an entire group of friends
who also were deaf and without lan
guage, thereby further disproving the
opinions of scholars that such individ
uals are exceedingly rare linguistic
oddities.
"A Man Without Words" is not only
a fascinating and inspiring story of the
personal transformation of a man and
his teacher.
On a broader scale, the book pro
vides countless insights into the very
nature of language and communica
tion. It illustrates how even the sim
plest linguistic act is in fact an amaz
ingly complex phenomenon, and it
explores the extent to which language
has the power to shape human percep
tions, thoughts and identities.
