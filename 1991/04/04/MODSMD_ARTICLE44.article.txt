The Difference Engine
William Gibson and Bruce Sterling

Most science fiction readers pay attention
when they hear the name William Gibson. And
they should; with his first novel, the Canadian
author won the coveted Hugo and Nebula
awards — a wholly unique accomplishment.
Gibson's "Neuromancer" has arguably had
more impact on the science fiction world than
any other book.
Co-author Bruce Sterling, author of
"Islands in the Net" and one of the more tal

ented science fiction writers to emerge from the
1980s, was a member of the "cyberpunk"
movement founded by Gibson. Cyberpunk is a
field often dominated by its gimmicks: potent
weapons, violence and consciousness-altering
machines and drugs.
"The Difference Engine" is the first novel on
which these two writers have collaborated; it
does neither much credit. The novel is set in an
alternate universe in which Great Britain, hav
ing constructed primitive computers by the
year 1855, has added the Information Age to
the Industrial Revolution and has maintained
its position as the world's strongest nation.
The story is told in four segments; the first
involves Sybil, a not-too-bright woman who

becomes involved with a man possessing a
potent, untested computer program. After he is
murdered, the narrative switches abruptly to
the story of Dr. Mallory, a paleontologist who
accidentally acquires the program.
This program is sought by the Manhattan
Communards, radical leftists who engineer a
takeover of London. Mallory spearheads an
operation against the New Yorkers, and then
the story shifts to late 1855, when Oliphant, a
British spy, attempts to clear up the domestic
disaster left by the invasion.
Oliphant seeks out Sybil, who becomes cru
cial in restoring benign factions to power in
England. The final segment is written as collec
tion of historical documents which concludes,

incongruously, with a third-person narrative.
The relation between politics and technol
ogy appears as one of the book's themes; both
have examined it before, and they take it
nowhere new. Another familiar subject is that
of artificial consciousness, a common Gibson
motif. Unfortunately, this topic seems to have
been tacked onto the book, mostly through its
disconcerting final passage, an afterthought.
Although the overarching plot of the book is
intriguing, it is difficult to comprehend. The
authors attempt to portray the covert political
maneuverings which affect the power structure
by telling three separate stories, each tangential
to the main plot. The point, of course, is that it
is in this manner that history appears as we ere

ate it. Nevertheless, this tactic obscures the
novel's actual focus. Furthermore, the individ
ual stories might have been better written.
In"The Difference Engine," the authors
have devised an ingenious, intriguing story —
one they populate with two-dimensional fig
ures and veil with incidental plots. Gibson has
written this novel before; then, it was much
more daring, probing and entertaining.
Readers willing to make the effort to com
prehend what motivates the events in the novel
may find it enjoyable, even worthwhile. Unfor
tunately, those hoping for a work of speculative
fiction that is serious, innovative or even highly
entertaining will have to await new writings, or
possibly new writers.
