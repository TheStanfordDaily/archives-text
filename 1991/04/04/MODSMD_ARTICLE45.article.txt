Dylan's genius
shines in work

unreleased
Bob Dylan
"The Bootleg Series, volumes 1-3"
For 30 years, Bob Dylan has been
putting out studio albums, live
albums, greatest hits albums, even a
retrospective boxed set. What's left?
Try nearly four hours worth of pre
viously unreleased recordings.
"The Bootleg Series, volumes 1-3"
contains 58 songs, at least half of

which have never been heard in any
form, except on the rarest of low-qual
ity, bootleg compilations. As for those
songs which have been heard, the ver
sions found here are just as rare.
Imagine finding 40 previously
unseen paintings by Picasso, some
made with great care on expansive
canvasses, others sketched on paper
napkins. Some reveal the master at his
simplest and most unpretentious; oth
ers uncover yet another dimension of
his genius.
In"The Bootleg Series," the Dylan
fan can find just this type of variety.
Listen to the first three songs,
recorded in 1961, when Dylan was just
starting, and hear him struggle to find
a sound with which he's comfortable.
Then listen to "Last Thoughts on

Woodie Guthrie," a seven-minute,
spoken poem, and unveil Dylan's mas
tery of the language as he describes not
only his idol, but also himself.
Many of the songs in"The Bootleg
Series" are outtakes, songs which were
recorded at the sessions for a particular
album but which, for one reason or
another, did not get included in the
final pressing.
"House Carpenter" and "Let Me
Die In My Footsteps," from the 1962
sessions for "The Freewheelin' Bob
Dylan," are special gems, as is "Talkin'
Bear Mountain Picnic Massacre
Blues," probably Dylan's first in a long
line of satirical pieces derived from
newspaper clippings.
The selection from the outtakes of
"The Times They Are A-Changin'" is
equally fruitful, including "Only A
Hobo," "Moonshiner" and "Seven
Curses," all of which can take a place
next to Dylan's more famous master
pieces.
In addition to the outtakes in"The
Bootleg Series" are a number of rare
live performances and alternate ver
sions of more celebrated songs. One
particular thrill is the version of

"Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues,"
recorded live at Carnegie Hall in 1963.
An acoustic version of "Subterranean
Homesick Blues" and the original ver
sions of "Tangled Up In Blue" and
"Idiot Wind" are also Dylan necessi
ties.
More than half of the collection is
filled with songs from the 19605, as it
should be, since — the 1974 album
"Blood On The Tracks" notwithstand
ing — Dylan was at his best in his first
decade of recording. But even the
songs included from the 1980s are
admirable, both for their differences
and their similarities to the earlier
works.
Certainly, by the sessions for the
1983 album "Infidels," the listener
finds Dylan's voice much harsher than
it was two decades before. But, at the
same time, the listener also finds Dylan
stretching out in new directions, once
or twice even letting his music share
the spotlight normally reserved for his
lyrics. In particular, "Foot of Pride,"
"Blind Willie McTell" and "Series of
Dreams" stand out among these recent
works.
