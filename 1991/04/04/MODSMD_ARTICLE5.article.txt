# Evans will leave Stanford

### Chris Grader Editorial staff With AP wire reports 
After winning three gold medals in
the 1988 Summer Olympics at the age
of 17, Janet Evans decided to enroll at
Stanford "to swim faster." Now, heading
into the 1992 Olympics, Evans has
decided to leave school for the same rea
son.
Evans announced that she will stop

out for all of the 1991-92 school year to
train for the Olympic trials and, assum
ing she makes the team, the Barcelona
Olympics. The announcement came last
night on the first day of the U.S. Long
Course Nationals, held at the King
County Aquatic Center in Federal Way,
Wash. Evans will remain at school for
spring quarter, according to roommate
Benny Sandoval.
"Due in part to NCAA restrictions, I
have decided to give up my eligibility in

order to train for the Olympics next
year," Evans said. "This is a hard deci
sion because I love Stanford and I love
my teammates. It will be hard not swim
ming for Stanford.
"Stanford and (coach) Richard Quick
have done a lot for me. But this is a per
sonal decision, and I feel this is what's
best for my future." Evans will likely
retire after the Olympics and said she
will not swim collegiately again.
The NCAA enacted legislation
Jan. 9 limiting mandatory prac
tice time for athletes to 20 hours a
week in season and eight hours a
week out of season. When the plan
was originally proposed, Evans,
who trains about 35 hours a week,
threatened to sue the NCAA if it
was enacted.
But the form of the legislation

passed by the NCAA allows ath
letes in individual sports to prac
tice on their own in addition to
the 20 or right hours a week, and
that coaches in some sports,
including swimming, may be pre
sent during those extra hours of
practice.
Those loopholes were thought
to give swimmers like Evans the
chance to train as much as they
want to. At the time Assoc. Ath

letic Director Cheryl Levick said
she felt the legislation, as enacted,
would "allow Olympians to train
and stay at Stanford."
But Evans has now decided
otherwise. "I don't want to spend
the rest of my life worrying if I'm
spending an hour extra a day and
am I going to get banned by the
NCAA," Evans said.
In addition to the new rules,
the timing of the Olympic trials
may have played a role in Evans'
decision.
In 1988 the Olympic trials
were held in August, about six
weeks before the Games. But
some swimmers and coaches felt
that it might have hurt their
Olympic performance by having
to prepare for two meets so close
together. Next year the Olympic
trials will be held in late March, to
give the chosen swimmers more
time to prepare for the Games.
With the change, however, the
trials will now be only three weeks
after the NCAA Championships
and many collegiate swimmers
are thinking about not swimming
for their schools in order to pre
pare exclusively for trials.
Evans, a sophomore, has won
five individual NCAA titles in her
first two seasons at Stanford
while leading the Cardinal to a
pair of runner-up finishes. A year
ago she broke American records in
winning the 500-yard and 1,650
freestyles. She also won the 400
individual medley in NCAA
record time, anchored the NCAA
champion 800 freestyle relay
squad and was named NCAA
Swimmer of the Year. A week ear
lier she won the Sullivan Award,
this country's most prestigious
amateur athletic award, for the
1989 year.
At this year's NCAA Champi
onships, March 21-23 in Indi
anapolis, Evans again won the
500 and 1,650 freestyles and
anchored the winning 800
freestyle relay team. She also fin
ished second to freshman team
mate Summer Sanders in the 400
IM and was the second-highest
point scorer, behind Sanders.
By leaving college, Evans is eli
gible to accept money from the
U.S. Swimming Federation and
the U.S. Olympic Committee, Ray
Essick, executive director of the
U.S. Swimming Federation, said.

Essick said Evans would be eli
gible to receive $36,000 from the
swimming federation this year
and $3,000 from the USOC. She
said she planned to accept money,
thus making her ineligible to com
pete in college swimming again.
Evans did say, however, that
she will return to the Farm to
complete her education. Sandoval,
her roommate both last year and
this year, affirmed Evans' love for
Stanford. "She likes it a lot," San
doval said. "We always have a
great time together. I'm positive
she really likes it here."
What Evans said overshad
owed what she did, as she won the
800-meter freestyle on the first
day of the meet. She finished in
8:30.75, more than 10 seconds
ahead of runner-up Kimberly
Small, who swims for the Univer
sity of Miami.
At the age of 15, Evans burst
on the swimming scene at the
1987 U.S. Long Course Nationals
by setting world records in the
800-meter and 1500-meter
freestyles. She then went on to
win the 400-meter and 800-meter
freestyles and the 400-meter IM
at the Seoul Olympics.
She continues to be unbeatable
in the distance freestyles and won
both the 400-meter and 800-
meter races at the World Champi
onships in January. She also
placed fourth in the 400-meter IM
at that meet.
She is currently the world
record-holder in the 400-meter,
800-meter and 1500-meter
freestyles. She also holds Ameri
can records in the 500-, 1000- and
1650-yard freestyles and the 400-
meter IM.
Melvin Stewart, who broke the
world record to win the 200-meter
butterfly in January's world
championships, also announced
he was leaving school for a year.
Stewart, who won the NCAA 200-
yard butterfly title for Tennessee
last week, is giving up his senior
year of eligibility.
Stewart, who swims for the Las
Vegas Gold club team, can win a
$100,000 prize offered by Bob
Stupak, owner of a Las Vegas
hotel and casino, if he sets a world
record in any U.S. national meet.
Stupak is offering the money to
any member of the Las Vegas Gold
team who sets a world mark.
