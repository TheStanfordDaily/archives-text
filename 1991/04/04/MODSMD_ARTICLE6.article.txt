# Top San Jose cop retires, joins Hoover
## 
### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Staff writer 
For more than 15 years, Joseph McNamars
enforced the law in San Jose. But next month the
former San Jose police chief — armed with a doctor
ate from Harvard University — will give up police
work for policy work as a research fellow at the
Hoover Institution.
McNamara, 56, resigned unexpectedly Tuesday
from his head post at the San Jose Police Depart
ment, citing a history of heart problems and advice
from his doctor to take a less stressful job.
McNamara could not be reached for comment yes
terday. But an official at Hoover said McNamara will
study domestic public policy issues that relate to law
enforcement and housing.
"We look forward to his coming here as a research
fellow," said Charles Palm, deputy director of
Hoover. "McNamara's public policy experience, abil
ity to articulate issues and the fact that he has inter
esting opinions will stimulate discussion and
thought."
The son of a police officer,
McNamara started his law
enforcement career as a New York
City police officer in 1957. He jug
gled duties as a daytime patrol
officer in Harlem with undergrad
uate studies in police science.
McNamara earned a doctorate in
public administration from Har
vard in 1973.
In 1976 he became chief of the
San Jose Police Department.
While there, McNamara was cred
ited for San Jose's low crime rate
— one of the lowest for a city its
size.
Known to speak out on issues
he feels deeply about, McNamara
gained national attention for his
support of gun control. As chief,
he also suggested the partial
legalization of drugs. Just days
before his resignation, McNa
mara called for Los Angeles Police
Chief Daryl Gates to step down
because of the beating of a black
motorist by police there last
month.

McNamara's departure sad
dened city residents, including
San Jose Mayor Susan Hammer,
who said she felt that during his
tenure San Jose possessed "the
best police department in the
country."
His departure "is a tremen
dous loss to the city," Hammer
said. But, she said, "Joe can bring
his experience from San Jose to a
policy level at Hoover."
McNamara's liberal image
stands in contrast to Hoover's
reputation as a bastion of conser
vatism.
But Palm said, "Politics are not
a criterion for selection at Hoover.
Our scholars are free to express
themselves and their views."
News of McNamara's appoint
ment as one of nearly 120 fellows
and senior fellows at Hoover was
met with praise. John Bunzel, a
senior research fellow at the
think tank, said McNamara will
be "enormous credit to the
Hoover Institution."
Bunzel got to know McNamara
more than a decade ago when
Bunzel served as the president of
San Jose State University.
