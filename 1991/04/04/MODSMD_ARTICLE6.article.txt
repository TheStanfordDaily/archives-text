For more than 15 years, Joseph McNamars
enforced the law in San Jose. But next month the
former San Jose police chief — armed with a doctor
ate from Harvard University — will give up police
work for policy work as a research fellow at the
Hoover Institution.
McNamara, 56, resigned unexpectedly Tuesday
from his head post at the San Jose Police Depart
ment, citing a history of heart problems and advice
from his doctor to take a less stressful job.
McNamara could not be reached for comment yes
terday. But an official at Hoover said McNamara will
study domestic public policy issues that relate to law
enforcement and housing.
"We look forward to his coming here as a research
fellow," said Charles Palm, deputy director of
Hoover. "McNamara's public policy experience, abil
ity to articulate issues and the fact that he has inter
esting opinions will stimulate discussion and
thought."
