# Fighting for funding
## Students join rally for school budgets 
### Howard Libit Staff writer 
SACRAMENTO - More
than 40 Stanford students lob
bied and rallied yesterday as
part of a statewide effort to
fight proposed funding cuts for
elementary and secondary
schools.
The students joined more
than 8,000 people who demon
strated in front of the state
Capitol and listened to speak
ers such as Rev. Jesse Jackson

and former Gov. Jerry Brown,
who urged increasing tax rev
enues and making fewer cuts to
the state's public schools.
The "Save Our Children"
rally attracted students, par
ents and teachers from pri
mary schools, high schools and
colleges who protested Gov.
Pete Wilson's proposed cuts in
next year's education budget.

tion 98 for one year to fund other
areas of the budget. Proposition
98, passed by voters in 1988,
guarantees that 40 percent of the
state budget will go to public
schools. If it is suspended, fund
ing for schools next year will
increase by only $233 million
instead of $1.8 billion.
Instead of cutting from the
education budget, many people at
the rally wanted to repeal Propo
sition 13, passed in 1977, which
set a low cap on property taxes.
Such taxes are the primary means
of raising education funds locally.
In a speech before the rally,
Jackson described Proposition 13
as a Scud missile and said, "We
must blow it out of the sky."
Many people at the rally said
they were surprised to see stu
dents from a private university
involved, because the budget only
affects public schools. But Stan
ford students said they want their
message to be heard because pub
lic education is an important
issue.
"We want to impress upon the
legislators and key staff that
Stanford students care about
[kindergarten through 12th
grade] schools," said Council of
Presidents member Goodwin Liu

Tuesday night as he was planning
the Stanford group's participa
tion.
Liu said many Stanford stu
dents are concerned about the
state's public schools because a
third of them are from California
and many volunteer in East Palo
Alto and other nearby schools.
Many attended these public
schools and have siblings still
attending them, he added.
Before the rally, about 12 Stan
ford students joined other college
students in speaking to various
members of the state Assembly
and Senate and their key staff,
emphasizing the importance of
public schools and the need for
more funding.
Among the politicians lobbied
were Assemblyman Byron Sher,
whose district includes Stanford;
Roger Magar, education consul
tant to the Assembly Republican
Caucus; Bill Furry, principal con
sultant to the Minority Ways and
Means Committee; and Julie Mac-
Donald, minority fiscal consultant
to the senate education commit
tee.
"We are saying that we will
accept the costs of better educa
tion in California," Liu said. "The
biggest thing the legislators are
afraid of is losing votes and we
told them that this is what the
voters want."
Public schools throughout the
state need more money to keep up

with the growing number of chil
dren, especially immigrant chil
dren who often have special
needs, Liu said.
Senior David Brown, an ASSU
senator and another organizer of
the Stanford contingent, said
Tuesday that he was upset by
"Gov. Wilson's attempts to bust
the teacher's union in the Rich
mond school district by refusing
to bail out the district unless the
teachers give up their right to col
lective bargaining."
The demonstration was loud
and supportive, as people filled
the plaza and park on the street in
front of the Capitol. More than
100 school buses were lined up
along the streets and balloons
printed with the saying "Save Our
Children" could be seen every
where.
Parent-teacher association rep
resentatives from all over the
state attended, as well as students
from many University of Califor
nia campuses and from MEChA, a
Chicano/Latino student organiza
tion.
In a widely applauded speech,
Jackson made several references
to the money spent on the Persian
Gulf war and the lack of money
spent on education.
"Mr. Bush, the war for educa
tion is a just war," Jackson said,
referring to President Bush's jus
tification for using force in the
Gulf. "Today there is a sound

commitment to liberate the chil
dren of Kuwait. . . . Let's liberate
America's children."
A common theme among
speakers was a call for increased
taxes on the state's rich. Former
Gov. Brown noted that the richest
1 percent of people receive tax
breaks worth $70 billion.
"California can afford to invest
in education by taking back tax
breaks," Brown said in an inter
view with The Daily after the
rally.
Brown also said he felt the
entire rally was important
because it "solidified opposition to
Pete Wilson."
Many of the student groups in
attendance were from special pro
grams of state schools. For exam
ple, the award-winning Pacer
Posse Marching Band from Grant
High School in Sacramento
played for the crowd. Band mem
bers said they hoped that their
funding would not be cut.
The neighborhood of the school
is "very diverse" and "there could
be a lot of tensions but the band
bonds the community together,"
said junior Tushumba Williams.
"Programs like this are an
oasis" that bring kids in to school
each day, said Cathy Stone, coor
dinator of Grant's special pro

"We are saying that we will
accept the costs of better educa
tion in California," Liu said. "The
biggest thing the legislators are
afraid of is losing votes and we
told them that this is what the
voters want."
Public schools throughout the
state need more money to keep up

with the growing number of chil
dren, especially immigrant chil

needs, Liu said.
Senior David Brown, an ASSU
senator and another organizer of
the Stanford contingent, said
Tuesday that he was upset by
"Gov. Wilson's attempts to bust
the teacher's union in the Rich

to bail out the district unless the
teachers give up their right to col
lective bargaining."
The demonstration was loud
and supportive, as people filled
the plaza and park on the street in

Brown also said he felt the

SACRAMENTO - More
than 40 Stanford students lob
bied and rallied yesterday as
part of a statewide effort to
fight proposed funding cuts for
elementary and secondary
schools.
The students joined more
than 8,000 people who demon
strated in front of the state
Capitol and listened to speak
ers such as Rev. Jesse Jackson

and former Gov. Jerry Brown,
who urged increasing tax rev
enues and making fewer cuts to
the state's public schools.
The "Save Our Children"
rally attracted students, par
ents and teachers from pri
mary schools, high schools and
colleges who protested Gov.
Pete Wilson's proposed cuts in
next year's education budget.

tion 98 for one year to fund other
areas of the budget. Proposition
98, passed by voters in 1988,
guarantees that 40 percent of the
state budget will go to public
schools. If it is suspended, fund
ing for schools next year will
increase by only $233 million
instead of $1.8 billion.
Instead of cutting from the
education budget, many people at
the rally wanted to repeal Propo
sition 13, passed in 1977, which
set a low cap on property taxes.
Such taxes are the primary means
of raising education funds locally.
In a speech before the rally,
Jackson described Proposition 13
as a Scud missile and said, "We
must blow it out of the sky."
Many people at the rally said
they were surprised to see stu
dents from a private university
involved, because the budget only
affects public schools. But Stan
ford students said they want their
message to be heard because pub
lic education is an important
issue.
"We want to impress upon the
legislators and key staff that
Stanford students care about
[kindergarten through 12th
grade] schools," said Council of
Presidents member Goodwin Liu

Tuesday night as he was planning
the Stanford group's participa
tion.
Liu said many Stanford stu
dents are concerned about the
state's public schools because a
third of them are from California
and many volunteer in East Palo
Alto and other nearby schools.
Many attended these public
schools and have siblings still
attending them, he added.
Before the rally, about 12 Stan
ford students joined other college
students in speaking to various
members of the state Assembly
and Senate and their key staff,
emphasizing the importance of
public schools and the need for
more funding.
Among the politicians lobbied
were Assemblyman Byron Sher,
whose district includes Stanford;
Roger Magar, education consul
tant to the Assembly Republican
Caucus; Bill Furry, principal con
sultant to the Minority Ways and
Means Committee; and Julie Mac-
Donald, minority fiscal consultant
to the senate education commit
tee.
"We are saying that we will
accept the costs of better educa
tion in California," Liu said. "The
biggest thing the legislators are
afraid of is losing votes and we
told them that this is what the
voters want."
Public schools throughout the
state need more money to keep up
