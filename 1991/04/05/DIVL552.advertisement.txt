AN INVITATION TO
NOMINATE CANDIDATES FOR
THE JAMES W. LYONS
AWARD FOR SERVICE
The James W. Lyons Award for Service (formerly the Dean's Award for
Service) was established to recognize and applaud service contributions
made by students from a variety of schools, departments, teams, clubs,
residences, and community projects. Any enrolled student is eligible for
this recognition.
Selections are made on the basis of nominations from members of the
Stanford community: faculty, staff, and students. Nominations can be
made in the form of a letter addressed to Norman Robinson, Acting
Dean of Student affairs, 323 Old Union (3010 Student Affairs). The
deadline for submitting nominations for spring quarter awards is:
MONDAY, APRIL 15, 1991 â€” 5:00 p.m.
The Service Award program is a nice way of expressing appreciation to
some of the amazing student-citizens in our midst. I hope you will think
of this program when you encounter such students.
