LSAT
LSAT Preparation for June 10 Exam
Prepare now for the NEW FORMAT
The LSAT has changed {but not by much). What's
NEW? All sections last 35 minutes. There are two
logical Reasoning sections, one Reading Comp, one
Problem Sets, one experimental. And the scale is
changed! 120 to 160.
Be the first in your dorm with a 160! After our April 13 class,
we meet Tuesday evenings. Enrollment is limited to 12 persons.
The class fee is $500.
