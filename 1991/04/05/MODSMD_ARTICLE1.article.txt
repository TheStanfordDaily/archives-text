# Budget knife to slice academic programs
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
The University plans to eliminate
several academic programs within the
next few years as part of a sweeping new
round of budget cuts, Provost James
Rosse reported yesterday to the Faculty
Senate.
In his grimmest assessment to date
of Stanford's troubled financial situa
tion, Rosse said it would be necessary to
"change the scope and priorities of the
University to fit developing budget real
ities."
Only 14 months ago, Rosse
announced that a $22 million "reposi
tioning" effort would create balanced
operating budgets this year and in years
to come. Those cuts primarily targeted
administrative and student support ser
vices, leaving academic programs virtu
ally untouched.
But a rapidly deteriorating budget
climate has made academic cuts a near
certainty, and has led administrators to
consider a one-time infusion of endow
ment funds into the operating budget.
It remains unclear how severe future

academic program cuts will have to be.
Budget planners are anxiously awaiting
the outcome of current negotiations
with the Navy over how much overhead
Stanford will be allowed to charge the
government on federal research grants
in upcoming years.
Indirect costs from these grants
account for about 30 percent of the Uni
versity's operating budget. Budget-plan
ners are almost certain the indirect-cost
rate will be lower than in past years, but
they have no way of knowing how much
lower it will be. Each percentage point
in the rate translates into almost $1 mil
lion in revenue.
Rosse won't finalize plans for next
year until the indirect-cost negotiations
have been completed. But yesterday he
offered a general assessment of what
may follow.
The University, he said, will likely
finish this year with a deficit of more
than $5.5 million. The shortfall comes
on top of $8 million in one-time cuts
made earlier this year.
Next year's budget "will require sub
stantial holdbacks and other short-term
actions," Rosse said. The University will

likely face yet another deficit, he said in
an interview prior to the meeting.
The operating budget the following
academic year, 1992-93, "will be sub
stantially reduced compared to the cur
rent year," he said. He declined to quan
tify what he meant by "substantially
reduced," other than to indicate that
academic programs will very likely be
cut.
Deans and other officials will first
look to cut those academic programs
that no longer attract many students,
Rosse said in an interview following the
meeting. "We can do a lot by making
sure we've cleaned out the under
brush," he said.
The next step will involve an assess
ment of the strengths and weaknesses
of Stanford's various academic pro
grams, Rosse explained. "Things we do
well but not as well as others" are more
likely to be cut, he said.
Rosse noted that it has been 15 years
since the last "thoroughgoing review of
academic programs at this institution."
