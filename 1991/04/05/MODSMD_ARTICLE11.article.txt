# ASSU prepares for spring election
## 
### Miranda Doyle Howard Libit Staff writers 
The ASSU Senate last night com
pleted preparation for the spring elec
tion by approving the remainder of the
election staff and placing several consti
tutional amendments on the ballot.
In addition, the Council of Presidents
announced that its campus-wide "State
of the Association" address Tuesday will
be followed by a explanation of the indi
rect-cost controversy presented by Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy.
The senate unanimously approved
junior Jason Moore as hearings officer.
Sophomores Andrew Katz and Kofi
Bruce and graduate student Doreen
Musson were named to the Hearings
Commission.
The announcement by Senate Chair
Solina Kwan that Elections Commis
sioner Raul Lopez now has a "complete
staff" was greeted with applause by the
senators. They had previously rejected
Musson as hearings officer amid contro
versy over a ruling on disclosing candi
dates' names and had struggled to com
plete preparations for the election.
In a related vote, Lopez's proposal to
place additional polling sites at dormito
ries was approved. But the action was
met with some criticism by senators
who wanted some locations to have
more computers and longer hours. A
final schedule for polling sites will be
completed by Wednesday, Lopez said.
The senate also voted 15-4 to place a
constitutional amendment on the ballot
requiring a poll of student opinion
before the ASSU debates non-campus
related issues.

The amendment, written by senators
Mike Curry and Naomi Onaga, was pro
posed as an alternative to graduate sen
ator John Overdeck's bill limiting the
scope of senate debate to campus issues.
The Overdeck amendment will also be
on the ballot.
According to the Curry-Onaga
amendment, the opinion of the Stanford
student body must be measured
through at least two of three methods:
passage of a referendum, phone polls
and forums and debates. Only after tak
ing these measure can the senate debate
these issues.
COP member Goodwin Liu, a senior,
announced that the State of the Associ
ation address will be given Tuesday at
7:30 p.m. at a location to be announced.
The entire student body will be invited.
The "State of the Association" is usu
ally presented at a senate meeting, but
according to COP member Ingrid Nava,
a senior, the COP wants to provide their
perspective on the "state of the student
body in a larger forum."
Several senators from the Students
First party said they were extremely
upset over the decision of the COR
which is composed of People's Platform
members. Overdeck, a member of the
Students First COP slate, said he
objected because there would not be an
opportunity for a rebuttal by his party.
But COP member Jamie Green, a
senior, maintained that the address was
"not a partisan thing" and would not
affect the campaign process.
The most bitter debate of the evening
occurred over a bill proposed by senator
David Brown, a senior, to allow flexibil
ity in the use of discretionary accounts.
Although the vote was 12-8 in favor of

the measure, it failed to garner the two
thirds support necessary for a bylaw
change.
The bill would have allowed the sen
ate to allocate funds from the ASSU dis
cretionary account to organizations
which are eligible to apply for special
fees. Normally, discretionary funds are
not made available to these groups.
"Discretionary funds are discre
tionary funds. They should not be
restricted," Brown said. He added that
he introduced the bill because of a
nearly two-hour senate debate last
month over whether the bylaws allowed
the allocation of $200 to the Women's
Herstory Month celebration, an activity
sponsored by the Women's Center. The
center receives special fees.
Overdeck was among those who
opposed Brown's bill. "There are very
set, good and proper channels for money
to be spent. . . . Just because the money
is in a slush fund doesn't mean that we
should lose control over it,"he said.
Graduate senator Larry Augustin
proposed an amendment which would
have had the opposite effect of Brown's
bill. Augustin wanted to specifically pro
hibit organizations receiving special fees
from getting discretionary funds. The
senate rejected his amendment.
Guidelines for the ASSU lobby office
were approved 13-4-3. The bill estab
lished a structure for the office, which
will work with the United States Stu
dent Association to lobby for issues such
as increased federal financial aid.
Also last night, the senate rejected a
plan to pay the University to mail
autumn and winter quarter grade
reports next year.
