Members of Stanford's Jewish com
munity have formed a new group
designed to give students more control
over planning social and cultural events
on campus.
Law student and organizer David
Forst said the group was created last
week in response to a "big burst of Jew
ish enthusiasm on campus."
The group will be independent of Hil
lel, an international Jewish student
organization that encompasses Jewish
religious, social, political and educa
tional institutions on most campuses,
said Hillel Rabbi Ari Cartun.
"The only difference (between Hillel
and the student group) is that [the new
group] is totally student-run. There is no
official staff," Cartun said.
The new organization will have a
"side-by-side relationship with Hillel.
It's not going to be Hillel on top and the
students underneath their direction.
Hillel will be handling the religious
activities and the students will be work
ing on social and cultural activities,"
Forst said.
"Hillel is organized from the top
down; adults pull most of the strings. We
felt there was enough enthusiasm to cre
ate a student-run organization," he
added.
Similar student groups have been
formed at other universities throughout

the country, Cartun said.
Some students involved with the
group said their role in community plan
ning had been too small because Hillel is
mainly run by adults.
In addition to bringing together Jew
ish students already active in Hillel, the
new organization hopes to bring more
students to the Jewish community.
"One of the primary goals is to pro
vide the Jewish students on campus with
a sense of community," Forst said.
According to both Forst and Hillel
Programming Director Liz Perez, the
biggest question facing organizers of the
new group was how its six directors and
seven activity chairpersons would be
elected.
Any registered Hillel member will be
allowed to vote for the candidates for
these positions.
The organization will still keep close
ties with the Hillel Foundation, which
will fund the organization and will also
grant the students use of the Hillel
offices and resources.
Students will also work in conjunc
tion with the Hillel program director.
In addition to social events, the stu
dent union will also sponsor monthly
"town meetings," during which Jewish
students will get together to discuss
activities.
"We're trying to encompass the entire
Jewish community," said sophomore
Bruce Wollman, who also helped orga
nize the new group.
