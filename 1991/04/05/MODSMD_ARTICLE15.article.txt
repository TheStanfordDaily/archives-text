Pennsylvania senator dies at 52
WASHINGTON (AP) — With a fortune
counted in the millions and a clean-cut, patri
cian style, Sen. Henry John Heinz 111 seemed
an unlikely fighter for the nation's steel work
ers and disabled and senior citizens.
But in two decades as a Republican member
of Congress from Pennsylvania, he pressed
their causes persistently and often achieved
striking results.
Heinz, 52, was killed yesterday in the colli
sion of a light plane and a helicopter in the
state where he had been an unsurpassed vote
getter since 1971.
"The people of Pennsylvania have lost a
great leader and the nation has lost a great sen
ator," said President Bush in a Statement.
Salvadorean peace talks begin
MEXICO CITY (AP) — Leftist guerrilla
leaders and representatives of El Salvador's
rightist government met here today for the
newest round of talks aimed at ending that
country's civil war.
This time, after 11 years of war and 75,000
deaths, an aura of hope surrounds the talks.
"The chances are good," Schafik Handal,
one of the guerrilla leaders, told reporters
before going into the first session at a Mexico
City hotel.
