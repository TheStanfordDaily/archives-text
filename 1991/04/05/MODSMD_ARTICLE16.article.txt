# Japanese, U.S. leaders discuss trade, war

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi
dent Rush headed for a California
meeting with Japanese Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu on yester
day as both leaders sought to
shore up relations strained by the
Persian Gulf War and long-run
ning trade disputes.
They were conferring in New
port Beach at a time of mounting
anti-Japanese sentiment in
Congress. Some lawmakers are
complaining that Tokyo was too
slow in contributing to Operation
Desert Storm, and U.S. critics also
are pointing to what they see as a
new Japanese assault on the U.S.
auto market as well as restrictive
barriers to U.S. goods.
Bush has not been critical of
Tokyo's war contribution, but he
was expected to be firm with
Kaifu on trade matters, adminis
tration officials said in advance of
Thursday's meeting.
Before leaving for California,
Bush attended a memorial service
for Lee Atwater, the former
Republican Party chairman who
died last week.

Trade frictions between the
United States and Japan intensi
fied last month when Japanese
officials ordered a display of
American-grown rice removed
from a U.S. exhibit at an agricul
tural exhibition in Japan. ,
Japan has a virtual ban on all
foreign rice, even though
Japanese consumers pay a pre
mium for the domestically grown
product, a staple of the Japanese
diet.
U.S. automakers, hard hit by
the recession, have also com
plained recently that their
Japanese competitors are steadily
increasing their share of the U.S.
automobile market.
Kaifu, who recently said that
Western criticism of his country
"makes me gnash my teeth,"
arrived in Newport Beach a day
before the president and had
breakfast Thursday with Vice
President Dan Quayle.
Kaifu sought the quick Califor
nia summit after the war forced
Bush to postpone plans to visit
Japan.
