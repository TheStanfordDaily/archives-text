# Hopes for a short recession dampened

WASHINGTON (AP) - The
number of Americans filing new
unemployment claims jumped to
the highest level in eight years
last month, the government said
yesterday in a report dampening
hopes of a quick end to the reces
sion.
Meanwhile, a private study
said a smaller percentage of job
less Americans received benefits
in 1990 than during any other
recession year since World War 11.
The bleak jobless claims data
from the Labor Department
showing applications topping a
half-million for the third straight
week — followed more favorable
recent reports indicating re
bounds in consumer spending and
the housing industry.
"For those who might have

been hoping for a quick end to
recession, I think that notion
should be shattered," said Allen
Sinai, chief economist at the
Boston Co.
"It can be a long time between
the first signs of life and when the
economy actually starts to
recover," Sinai said.
The separate study showing
that only 37 percent of the
nation's jobless received unem
ployment benefits last year
brought renewed calls for Bush
administration action.
The study, based on Labor
Department figures, was compiled
bv the Center on Budget and Pol
icy Priorities, a liberal research
organization that studies govern
ment social programs.
President Bush needs to "take

a trip beyond the Beltway and dis
cover the naked truth about
unemployment in 1991," Rep.
Tom Downey, D-N.Y., who has
introduced legislation to shore up
the unemployment insurance sys
tem, said as the report came out.
"These are human tragedies —
working Americans and their fam
ilies coping with the financial and
psychological strains of unem
ployment," Downey said.
His legislation would force
states to ease eligibility require
ments, so more laid-off workers
could qualify for assistance, and
reinstitute the extended benefits
program, so that the unemployed
people could receive benefits
longer than the current 26-week
limit.
With jobs so scarce, Downey

and others have complained,
Americans who get laid off need
more than 26 weeks to find
another source of income.
The separate study on unem
ployment insurance said the 37
percent of jobless Americans
receiving coverage last year was
the lowest in a recession year
since such figures were first com
piled in 1946. "This low level of
protection ... is unparalleled,"
the report said.
The report is the latest in a
string of criticisms of the unem
ployment insurance system,
which was created in the 1930s as
a cushion for jobless Americans
during lean economic times and as
a way to keep money flowing
through the economy.
