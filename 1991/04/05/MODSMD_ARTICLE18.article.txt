LOS ANGELES (AP) - Police
Chief Daryl F. Gates was forced
yesterday to take a 60-day paid
leave of absence while investiga
tions into the videotaped beating
of black motorist Rodney King
proceed.
"I feel that I have been dis
graced and defamed," Gates said
after emerging from an 80-minute
closed-door Police Commission
meeting. "I have no idea why this
is happening. I'm very controlled.
I always have been."
Commissioners Daniel F. Gar
cia, Samuel L. Williams and
Melanie E. Lomax made the deci
sion without giving a specific rea
son. The five-member commission
has one vacancy and the newest
commissioner was absent.
"We emphasize this action is
not punitive in nature and results
in no loss of pay or benefits for
Chief Gates," the commission said
in a statement. "More impor
tantly, it should not be taken by
the public as reflecting any con
clusion as to whether the chief
should be charged or disciplined in
the future."
Commissioners appointed Ass
istant Chief David Dotson, 57, as
interim chief.
"I'm not going to make any
comments regarding the actions
of this board," Dotson said. "My
role is to manage this department
in this interim period and I'm

going to do that."
Gates, 64, said earlier he would
not openly defy the commission if
members tried to put him on
leave. "I would not dispute their
authority. I understand that could
be insubordination."
In asking for Gates' resigna
tion on Tuesday, Mayor Tom
Bradley said the chiefs response
to the March 3 beating plunged
the nation's second-largest city
and its Police Department into cri
sis.
'It is my hope that today's
Police Commission action will give
us all time to bridge the differ
ences that have grown between us
since the Rodney King incident,"
Bradley said on his afternoon
return from Sacramento.
King, 25, was released from a
hospital earlier this week and
went into seclusion, his attorney
said, adding his client wasn't
"doing too well."
"He can't talk very well
because he has problems with
facial muscles. It is difficult to talk
to him because he gets memory
lapses, " lawyer Steve told
the Associated Press in an inter
view at his Beverly Hills office.
" This is a time of healing for
the city of Los Angeles to restore
credibility and to show minority
communities that the LAPD will
clean house," said Lerman.
Meanwhile, the president of

the 8,100-member Los Angeles
Police Protective League said offi
cers were so angry that they
might authorize "some job
action," such as a work slowdown
or sickout.
Mass meetings will be called to
discuss the issue "if this ridicu
lous situation is allowed to con
tinue," said Lt. George Aliano, the
union president.
"1 can tell you that my . . . loy
alty is with Chief Gates, and I feel
certain that in the hearts and
minds of all the members, with
very, very few exceptions in the
department, that Daryl Gates is
their chief," said Deputy Chief
William Booth, a 37-year depart
ment veteran who served as its
main spokesman for almost 14
years.
Cmdr. George Marrison, who
has worked with Gates for 35
years, was wearing a ribbon of
black tape over his badge.
"It's symbolic of mourning,"
Marrison said. "It's easier than
losing my temper over the irre
sponsible actions of the Police
Commission."
The American Civil Liberties
Union, ringleader in the campaign
to oust Gates, said the furlough
will help soothe wounds opened
when a plumbing parts salesman
with a new camera videotaped the
police beating of a black man.
