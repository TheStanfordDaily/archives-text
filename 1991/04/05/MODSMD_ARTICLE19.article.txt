SACRAMENTO (AP) - SherifTs
deputies armed with explosives and
guns stormed an electronics store yes
terday in an attempt to save an esti
mated two dozen hostages held eight
and a half hours by four gunmen.
Three gunmen and three hostages
were killed during the bloody assault,
according to Sheriff Glen Craig.
At least 13 hostages were wounded.
The fourth gunman was also seriously
wounded, the sheriff said.
The gunmen were members of an
Asian youth gang called the "Oriental
Boys," and had demanded safe passage
to Thailand, Craig said.
Several deputies had been hiding
inside the store for two hours before
the assault, getting into position, Craig
said. The officers got in through a
storeroom, he said.
The order to begin the attack came
about five minutes after the gunmen
had shot a hostage in the leg â€” the sec
ond hostage to be wounded.
"We didn't think we had the luxury
to wait any longer," Craig said. "We
couldn't sit here all night and let them
shoot people one at a time."
One gunman "walked . . . down the
line shooting hostages" as the officers
opened fire, Craig said. "They were

systematically being shot. All of the
hostages were on the floor at the time
our people went in."
Investigators initially said robbery
appeared to be the gunmen's motive.
But Craig said the gunmen "never
went near the money till, there was
never a demand for money. It does not
appear to be a robbery. We're not cer
tain of the motive."
The gunmen had demanded guns,
bullet-proof vests and a helicopter.
As the attack began by officers hid
ing inside the store, dozens of armed
officers rushed the brightly lit Good
Guys store amid bursts of gunfire, and
an explosion blew out the glass in the
store's front door. As the glass shat
tered, a young woman, her hands tied
behind her back, cowered near the
store front seeking shelter. She sur
vived the ordeal.
Craig said officers did not attack
until all of the hostages in front of the
store were lying down and would be
less subject to crossfire.
Craig was asked if he was comfort
able with decision to attack. "You are
never comfortable," he said.
There were about 30 people inside
the store when the gunmen entered
about 1:30 p.m. The gunmen released

eight people unharmed. A ninth
hostage, store employee Sean Mcln
tyre, was shot in the leg and allowed to
leave to deliver a message of demands
to authorities.
Gunshots were heard periodically
from inside the store. Craig said some
were fired to test a bulletproof vest
which the gunmen obtained from offi
cers in exchange for the first three
hostages they released.
During the siege, several hostages
were ordered to lie on the floor or
kneel. They were apparently deliber
ately placed near the large glass front
doors in order to make them visible to
surrounding officers.
Negotiators communicated with the
assailants, who apparently spoke little
English, by telephone from a nearby
command post. Officers said Thai
interpreters had been called to the
scene.
Craig described the gunmen as
young. "They are not teen-agers, but
they are young," Craig said. "They are
very serious. It's not a lark. It's not
funny."
Ken Thungc, a speaker of Thai and
an interpreter, said the gunmen asked
for bulletproof vests and a beverage
made from ginger root. Thungc said he

spoke with the assailants by phone
from the command post.
Employees at the store at the
crowded Florin Mall reported the inci
dent as a robbery attempt. Several
workers managed to flee to safety
through a back door as the incident
began, according to officers.
"I'm very relieved to be out of
there," said employee Matt Dennis, 20,
who was in the store warehouse when
the incident began.
Another employee limped away
from the scene in bare feet, hugged a
woman and then was led away by offi
cers. Tears were streaming down his
face. "It was awful," he said.
Company spokeswoman Michele
Rasmussen said the Good Guys "is
extremely concerned about the welfare
of our customers and our employees
and is currently contacting crisis coun
selors to assist in any way possible."
Sacramento sheriffs deputies and
Highway Patrol officers, their guns
drawn, surrounded the store, about
eight miles from the state Capitol. A
special weapons team patrolled the
roof of the store. Dozens of squad cars
crowded the parking lot of the shop
ping center, located near Florin Road.
