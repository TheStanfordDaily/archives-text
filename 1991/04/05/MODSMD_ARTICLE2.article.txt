Likely scenarios for Stanford's operating budget in upcoming years

1990-91 James Rosse expects a deficit in excess of $5.5
million at the end of the year despite the one-time cuts of
$8 million announced in November and completion of the
University's $22 million "repositioning" effort.

p' 1991-92 "Substantial holdbacks and other short-term
actions" will be necessary, Rosse says. The University is
likely to incur another deficit.

1992-93 Large scale permanent reductions — including
the elimination of some academic programs — will likely
be necessary. The budget will be "substantially reduced"
pared to the 1990-91 year, Rosse says.
