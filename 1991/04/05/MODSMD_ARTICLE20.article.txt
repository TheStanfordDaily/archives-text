Still at it
Ace Barnes, 62, of Odessa, Texas, an employee of Boots and
Coots works with fellow Texan Mike Petrus of Denison to tight
en bolts on the flange of a damaged well head spewing oil yes
terday in the Great Burgan Oil Field, Kuwait. Workers have to
be careful not to create a spark which could set fire to the
geyser of oil. Experts estimate it will take up to two years to
stop other wells that aren't on fire from spewing oil onto the
ground. So far, fires and oil escapes have been stopped at only
seven wells.
