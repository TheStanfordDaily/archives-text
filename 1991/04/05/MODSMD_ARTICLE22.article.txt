## Row PAs not needed 
### 
Next year, the office
of Residential Education
will introduce a new posi
tion, that of program assistant, or
PA, on a trial basis in the non
theme Row houses. Because the
position will be unpaid, it is not
terribly objectionable; however, it
is frivolous. The PA position will
not accomplish anything.
Many people draw into Row
houses as an alternative to dorm
life. As a result, the notorious
absence of programming in these
houses results from from a lack of
dorm interest rather than any
logistical obstacles facing a resi
dent assistant.
The PA is supposed to help the
non-theme RA facilitate programs.
But very few Row RAs are cur
rently over-taxed; what's more, the
appeal of Row houses for most res
idents is the absence of Res Ed

influence. Any help that PAs may
offer the non-theme Row RAs will
be ineffective as long as there
remains little to no enthusiasm on
the part of the residents.
Res Ed should tailor its changes
more to the general wants and
needs of the students. The intro
duction of PAs in non-theme Row
houses will not have any noticeable
consequence. Many other resi
dences, however, would greatly
benefit from a strengthening of
their Res Ed staffs.
Res Ed should concentrate on
residences such as larger, four
class or freshmen dorms where the
RAs make the biggest impact. It
seems a shame to waste the PAs; if
money is the issue, non-paid PAs
would make able substitutes for
the RAs these larger dorms stand
to lose.
