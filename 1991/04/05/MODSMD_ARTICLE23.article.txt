THE CREATION OF A Greek
lodge is a good idea. Although
certain fraternities oppose it,
they are resisting a valuable oppor
tunity.
The lodge has the potential for
offering unhoused Greek organiza
tions a useful gathering place. For
these groups, the Greek lodge is a
desperately needed resource, a
communal space at which fraterni
ties and sororities would be able to
hold meetings and store files.
At present, the members of the
unhoused fraternities and sorori
ties face several practical problems
in the continuous management of
their organizations. The lodge
would be a helpful step in the alle
viation of these groups' difficulties.
Almost all other student groups
have some sort of limited space
made available to them by the Uni
versity. Currently, there is no such
facility available to the unhoused

Greek organizations on campus.
Not only would the lodge pro
vide individual groups a place for
storage, it would also consolidate
the storage of different organiza
tions, which might, in turn, pro
mote a greater sharing of materials
within the Greek community in
the future.
By opposing the idea of a lodge,
fraternities such as Alpha Epsilon
Pi, Sigma Nu and Sigma Phi
Epsilon are only hurting them
selves. A Greek lodge seems like a
fair compromise between the Uni
versity and the Greek system.
A Greek lodge does not necessar
ily preclude housing the unhoused
fraternities in the future, and it
improves the current situation.
For sororities and other fraterni
ties which have not voiced a desire
to become housed, the Greek lodge
would be an invaluable addition.
