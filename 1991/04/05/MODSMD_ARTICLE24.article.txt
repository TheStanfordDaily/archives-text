Damage to Iraq too great; calls for democracy futile

IN HIS APR. 2 LETTER TO The
Daily, Alexander Rawls attacked
President Bush for doing nothing to
bring democracy to Iraq. Did Rawls
really expect that a man who cheered on
Contra terrorists in Nicaragua and
invaded Panama, who supports a brutal
military establishment in El Salvador
and provides covert aid to Pol Pot's
forces in Cambodia would regard bring
ing democracy to Iraq as a primary objec
tive?
Bush knows full well that a demo
cratic Iraq would set a dangerous prece
dent in that part of the world. The rulers
of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey
and Egypt, who tolerate little or no pop
ular opposition in their own countries,
would have every reason to feel threat
ened by a democracy close to their bor
ders, and Washington has every reason

to avoid offending them.
These countries are much-needed
allies in the U.S. effort to establish and
maintain a controlling military presence
in the Persian Gulf region. This long
sought goal was a primary reason for our
intervention against Iraq, along with a
desire to ensure that oil profits from the
Gulf states would continue to be
invested in ways that would benefit our
economy.
An even more compelling reason why
democratic change is unlikely to take
place in Iraq is that the U.S. assault on
that country — what Rawls calls "a
morally imperative war" — has virtually
precluded Iraq's development for years
to come. Rawls seems sublimely unaware
that U.S. bombing killed some 150,000
Iraqis and destroyed everything that
makes civilized existence possible.

The people of Iraq have little food, no
clean water, no energy supply, no medical
equipment and no medicine. They and
their children, who made up more than
60 percent of the population before the
war, now face cholera and typhoid epi
demics.
American opposition to Saddam Hus
sein may have persuaded the Iraqi peo
ple that they would be supported in a
rebellion, but now they have neither the
physical nor the psychological strength
to overthrow an entrenched military dic
tator. The Iraqis are actually in a Catch
-22 situation. Bush has declared that no
U.S. reconstruction aid will go to Iraq
until Saddam is thrown out of office. But
without such aid, the people will be too
weak to do anything but scrounge for
survival.

Rawls calls opposition to this war
"brainless," but it was those who pre
ferred the use of long-term economic
pressure rather than a military attack to
get Iraq out of Kuwait who were in
touch with reality. The only thing the
war accomplished was the restoration to
power of Kuwait's ruling dynasty.
Otherwise, as the war's opponents
predicted, the results have been physical
devastation, the pollution of an entire
region and continued suffering for hun
dreds of thousands of human beings.
Our only hope is that when all the costs
are reckoned, the American people will
realize that it couldn't have been other
wise — that massive and indiscriminate
slaughter is not the way to achieve moral
ends.
