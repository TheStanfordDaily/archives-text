# Military victory not enough; Kurds desperate for help
## 
### 
THE PERSIAN GULF WAR HAS
demonstrated many things. It has
proven America's almost exclusive
reliance on military force as the means
to resolve political problems. It has
reduced Saddam Hussein's position as a
regional strongman. It has proven the
lengths to which the United States will
go in order to secure the profitable and
advantageous status quo in the oil
region.
It has also proven that the primacy
given in the U.S. war rationale on the
subject of human rights was yet again
cynically and flippantly used as an expe
dient excuse. American policy-makers
should be ashamed to speak of a "new
world order" in the light of the current
U.S. policy.
The hypocrisy of U.S. policy is mind
boggling and upsetting. Kuwait is tortur
ing and deporting a majority of resident

foreigners. It was on the backs of these
same people, whom the United States
went to such lengths to defend, that the
wealth of Kuwait was built. The United
States should require a change in
Kuwaiti practices before any further
reconstruction aid is given.
The most tragic of all is the plight of
the Kurds. The "gassing of his own peo
ple" (Saddam's use of mustard gas on
Kurdish insurgents) was one of the most
moving justifications for American inter
vention in Iraq. But after offering tacit
support to the rebelling Kurds, the
United States has abandoned them in
the face of their impending defeat —
defeat likely to be followed by imprison
ment, torture and execution.
The Kurds are once again the sacrifi
cial victims in the fallout of Western
intervention in Middle Eastern affairs.
Saddam is not going to be overthrown in

the near future, and he still has enough
deadly military power to crush the rebel
lions which are the legacy of war.
American and allied responses to the
plight of the Kurds call to mind the
actions of the Red army, which stopped
on the other side of the Vistula and
watched the agonizing defeat of the Pol
ish freedom fighters to the Nazis in War
saw.
While the United States can only
intervene so much, the least it should do
is offer logistical support to help the flee
ing Kurds to reach safety in Turkey. It
should also propose international aid to
Turkey to help them accommodate the
refugees.
France and Turkey have asked the
United Nations to address the issue. The
Security Council preferred to address
other, more pressing issues such as the
cease-fire terms. But resolving the

revolts would be an integral part of
achieving a lasting cease-fire agreement.
The United States needs to face up to
some serious issues and ask some painful
questions. Why did 100,000 Iraqis have
to die in a war that was "against Saddam
Hussein and not the Iraqi people?" Have
U.S. actions made peace and stability any
more likely? How can the United States
now be so callous to the plight of the
Kurds when it so insensitively exploited
their predicament for its own aims?
Americans cannot walk with pride
simply on the basis of having demon
strated superior military capabilities.
Americans can only walk with pride if
the outcome of that use of force brings
some benefit and is backed up by actions
in line with the reasons given as to why
the force was used in the first place.
