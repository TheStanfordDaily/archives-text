# Kofi Bruce & Andrew Katz
## Testosterone 'n' trail mix 
### 
WE ARE SO BIG. On the first Sat
urday of spring break, we, along
with two of our drawmates, went
off into the woods to do manly-man
things. We left behind all traces of politi
cal correctness and the banalities of eti
quette to become one with nature.
We threw away our country club mem
berships and became card-carrying mem
bers of the Mother Nature Fan Club. We
went beyond GRANOLA; we were TRAIL
MIX. Hell, we were even bordering on
NUTS AND BERRIES.
We took off from campus at our day
break departure time (actually 4 p.m.).
We were headed for the Tassajara Hot
Springs (also the home of a Zen retreat).
We arrived only to find that the road was
blocked by a gaggle of Jamesburg resi
dents.
They informed us that we could not go
up to the Springs because the trails were
was coming (not just a storm — an ARC
TIC storm).
But we were tough. No girly-men
Jamesburg residents were going to tell us
what to do — snow or no snow. Our friend
Steve looked over the men, women and
children standing in our way, turned to us
and said, "How many are there? We can
take 'em!"
But then we recalled the wise words of
the North Face salesman who said, con
cerning the warmth of our sleeping bags,
"A five-below bag does not mean you will
be comfortable. It just means that you
won't die." So we turned around and
went South to BIG SUR.
We arrived at around 8:30 p.m., only to
find torrential rains and complete dark

ness waiting for us at the gateway to the
wilderness. But were we daunted? NO!
Who needs daunts anyway (Dave Barry)?
For five hours we hiked in the dark, in
the rain, uphill, with 80 pounds on our
backs, with the wind in our face, without
knowing where we were. And we liked it.
We liked it just fine.
We ate rice and beans, swallowed
whole granola bars and ate trail mix that
included freeze-dried pears. And we liked
it. We loved it. Cleaning ourselves con
sisted of wiping ourselves with wet leaves.
And we liked it. We were cold, wet, snivel
ing college students with indigestion,
nasty gas and crotch rot. And we liked it.
We liked it just fine.
We were not just BIG. We were HUGE.
With our manly-man odors wafting
through the tent, we did guy stuff. We
burped, farted, smoked pipes, scratched
in unsavory places, picked forbidden
zofi-fcs'of rmr -boates, did Shots of whiskey
and talked about WOMEN.
These discussions grew quite explicit,
and by the last day it was clear that we
shared many of the same desires. Each
one of us is drawn to the same part of a
female's body. The warmth and softness
of this region soothe us in our most des
perate moments. Its significance, how
ever, goes beyond that of a mere piece of
anatomy. It symbolizes what men want
(and need) most from women.
Let us explain ourselves before any
would-be judges for the Women's Cen
ter's Objectifier Hall of Shame paste up
our photographs, or before machete
wielding Aurora editors hack off our
heads. (Wonderful tergiversation, huh?)
We concluded: Men are looking for a

piece 0f... a ... a.. . LAP
LAP?!
No, we don't mean the Luscious Area
of Pelvis. After days of deep soul search
ing, we sincerely concluded that all we
want is a lap in which to lay our tired
heads.
We dream of having our hair stroked,
our faces caressed. We long to be told dur
ing moments of stress everything will be
all right.
Freudians might see this as a lust to
return to the womb. They can kiss our
subconscious.
When we finally had the opportunity
to revel in savory and perverse fantasies
about naked JIiLL-0 wrestling and star
ring roles in Coors. commercials, we
couldn't do it.
We may have been doing manly-man
things in the forest, but we were still cold,
wet, tired, hungry and lonely. At our most
macho, what we really wanted was a little
comfort and compassion.
The Moral of the Story (for the analyt
ically impaired) is don't judge people
based upon appearances. Manly-men can
really be sensitive guys. And that dude
who sits in the corner of your 11:00 class,
eying you up and down — he may just be
looking for a piece of lap.

Lately, Kofi Bruce has been getting more
lap than Andrew Katz. Andrew is way
cheezed.
