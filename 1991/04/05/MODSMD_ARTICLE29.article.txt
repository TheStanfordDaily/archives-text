SINCE THE INDIRECT RESEARCH
cost controversy broke out several
months ago, I have been collecting
information about it from various
sources. In learning more about the con
troversy and how the complex account
ing system works, I have gained an
appreciation for how the anomalies —
the so-called "improper" charges — in
the accounting system could have
occurred.
In a nutshell, Stanford calculates indi
rect costs for research by creating pools
of costs associated with a particular cate
gory (like the library), and then a single
percentage based on past statistical stud
ies (e.g. 25 percent for the libraries) is
applied to the entire pool to determine
the amount to be charged as indirect
research costs.
The key concept here is that an
AVERAGED number is used to calculate
the indirect costs, instead of the more
accurate but much more costly and time
consuming process of sorting through all
the items in each cost pool to determine
if an item should be charged to spon-

sored research.
You are probably wondering about the
so-called Hoover House scandal and all
the other "embarrassing revelations."
There are several reasons for these
anomalies in the accounting system.
First, all operational expenses for the
Hoover House were placed in the Gen
eral and Administrative pool, and these
expenses were evaluated individually for
their appropriateness as University
expenditures but not separately as gov
ernment-reimbursable expenditures.
As a result, many items which are
technically allowable but seem inappro
priate (flowers, furniture purchases or
repairs, etc.) have appeared in this pool.
This is a shortcoming of the system
Stanford has readily recognized and
taken concrete steps to rectify — it has
withdrawn nearly $700,000 in past indi
rect costs.
Second, some of the problems are due
to accounting errors, such as $184,000
for the depreciation on a yacht and
$185,000 for administrative expenses for
the Stanford Shopping Center. Stanford

has admitted to these mistakes and recti
fied all of them. These errors may, at
first glance, seem outrageous, but in
light of the fact that Stanford has to log
in nearly 3 million transactions that go
through 17,000 accounts in the system
each year, it doesn't seem too outrageous
after all.
Finally, some of the much-publicized
items revealed at the House subcommit
tee hearing are actually errors made by
federal investigators. For example, Stan
ford has never charged the government
$7,000 for sheets for President
Kennedy's bed. And the allegation that
Stanford billed the government for
Kennedy's wedding reception is totally
false.
These examples highlight an aspect of
the controversy that really irritates me:
the media sensationalism characterized
by personal attacks on Kennedy and his
family, which border on personal harass
ment.
The other disturbing aspect of the
controversy is the superficial, and almost
nonexistent, analysis of the broader pol

icy issues associated with indirect
research costs at universities nationwide
by both the House subcommittee and the
news media. What are the implications
of a severe cutback on government sup
port of indirect research costs on the
future of scientific research at Stanford
and elsewhere?
Since I am no expert on the indirect
costs issue, I don't know whether Stan
ford's indirect cost rate of 70 percent is
too high or not, but I do want to bring a
few important facts to your attention:
• In regards to the two main con
tentions made by Paul Biddle — that
Stanford had overcharged the govern
ment by as much as $200 million in indi
rect costs over the past decade and that
there was a "cozy" relationship between
the Office of Naval Research and Stan
ford that benefited the University at the
expense of the taxpayer — the Inspector
General of the Office of Naval Research,
after investigating these allegations for
six months, has found these allegations
BASELESS;
• Stanford's indirect cost rate is not

outside the range of rates charged by
comparable institutions; instead "it is
near the front edge of a fairly tight clus
ter of rates"; and
• Most importantly, Kennedy has
taken concrete steps to improve Stan
ford's accountability for taxpayer's
money: Stanford has hired Arthur
Andersen & Co. to review the situation
and recommend appropriate changes-
Throughout the present controversy,
Stanford has recognized and admitted to
its shortcomings, apologized for them
and taken concrete actions to rectify
them. I sincerely believe that Kennedy
deserves both our moral and financial
support to meet the challenges facing
Stanford now and in her next century.
As an indication of my faith in Stan
ford, I pledge to it 78 percent of my life
time savings to date — a number Stan
ford surely deserves!
