# Students yelp: Hey BÃ¼g, where are you?

### John Ott Staff writer 
Delirious from lack of sleep and
three family-size bags of pork rinds,
and with my deadline for this week's
Bug just two hours away, I desperately
turn to fellow investigator Scooby-Dii
for aid. I can't help but wonder how
those juvenile sleuths and their zany
mutt would have handled the case. . .
Lightning crackles in the night sky
as the Mystery Machine lurches to a
halt on a bleak, forlorn beach. Shaggy,
Thelma, Daphne, Fred and their dog
Scooby climb out of the van.
Thelma: Well, gang, here we are at
my aunt's secluded beach mansion.
Out of nowhere appears a mysteri
ous old man, the caretaker of the man
sion.
Caretaker: You kids planning to
stay here tonight?
Daphne: Why, yes. Why do you ask?
Caretaker: Last night the legendary
Swamp Yeti Zombie came and system
atically butchered and devoured all 38
inhabitants of the mansion. Nothing
left but gristle and bone. He slinks
away.
Thelma: Oh God. . . .
Fred: We better split up and look for
clues. . ..

Thelma: But Fred. . . .
Fred: Don't worry about your aunt,
she'll eventually decompose. Now
Shaggy, you and Scooby search the
beach while Thelma, Daphne and I
make some . . . er . . . repairs inside the
Mystery Machine.
Shaggy: Just wait one second there,
Fred. You always get to go off with the
girls. It's not fair, and this time I'm not
going to play along. Besides, Scooby's a
terrible kisser.
Fred: Not even for a Scooby Snack?
Fred laughs maniacally, knowing that
he can use Shaggy's terrible chemical
addiction to his advantage.
Shaggy: What? Where? Come on
man, I haven't had a fix in two days.
I'll do anything you say. Fred tosses
Shaggy a Scooby Snack, which he
greedily devours.
Daphne: Hey look, gang, I found a
note!
Thelma: Jinkies! What's it say?
The note, written in blood, reads as
follows:
Dear Bug,
What are those stylized fish shapes
I always see on the back of cars ?
Caretaker: (who has mysteriously
reappeared) They say the Swamp Yeti

Zombie drives a car with one of them
little fishies on it.
Fred: Well there's only one thing to
do. We've got to set a trap for this mon
ster. Shaggy, you and Scooby go out and
lead the evil, voracious, human-eating
Swamp Yeti Zombie over here.. .
Shaggy: I told you, I'm not going to
be your slave anymore, you Aryan pup
pet master, you junkie pimp! I've had
it, I'm . . .
Fred: Oh shut up or I'll beat you to
a pulp, you skinny wastoid. I'm not
taking any flak from someone who is
convinced his dog talks to him.
Suddenly the Swamp Yeti Zombie
appears and makes after them.
Shaggy: Zoinks! Run for your lives!
The creature chases the kids
around the beach to cheesy disco
music. During the commotion Thelma
trips and her glasses fly off her face.
She gets down on all fours and
searches for them.
Thelma: My glasses! I can't see
without my glasses!
Just then the monster trips over
Thelma and falls to the ground. The
music fades out and the gang sur
rounds their fallen foe.
Daphne: Now, let's pull off the mask
and see who this villain really is.
The mask is removed to reveal a

familiar visage.
All (in unison): It's Ricky
Schroeder!
Fred: So what's with the fish,
Ricky?
Ricky: Those stylized fish shapes
you see on the back of cars are put
there by their owners, who are mem
bers of the Lutheran Church. The fish
has been a traditional symbol for Jesus
in Christianity for centuries. It's a lot
like hanging a crucifix on one's wall, or
wearing a Star of David around one's
neck.
Thelma: Gosh. But why the brutal
murders?
Ricky: Ever since "Silver Spoons"
bottomed out I've been in the dumps.
Then, one day a voice on the television
told me not to take it anymore, to go
out and KILL, KILL, KILL!
Shaggy: Who's voice?
Ricky: Papa Smurfs. And I would
have gotten away with it if it weren't
for you meddling kids! He pulls out a
gun and shoots everyone five or six
times in the stomach, then lurches
away back into the swamp. . . .

The Bug plans to plead "insanity by
inundation in television culture" if
and when Mr. Schroeder sues him
silly.
