The Stanford Daily
"AXE REGAINED!" screamed the three-inch tall headline. In a style
almost as breathless as that of the "Immortal 21" themselves, The Daily
recounted how the good, intelligent, red Stanford students outwitted
the bad, stupid, blue-and-gold UC-Berkeley weenies and stole back the
[Stanfordl Axe. The Axe had been trapped in the hellhole across the Bay
for 31 years.
UC-Berkeley had been showing off the Axe at a rally when — a la
Operation Desert Storm — the 21 struck. Posing as photographers,
they convinced the Axe guardians to pose for a picture. Shooting them
with ink instead of film and dropping a tear gas bomb, they grabbed the
Axe and ran like heck, leaving UC-Berkeley looking similar to Kuwait.

The Stanford Daily
A majority of Stanford students do not believe the voting age should
be lowered from 21 to 18, a Daily poll discovered. Fifty-four percent did
not believe 18-year-olds were mature enough to vote.
Reasoning of students pro and con were reprinted:
"No, 18-year-olds have not been away from home long enough. . . .
College students are too much withdrawn to be capable to vote." (With
drawn? Hey, we're apathetic and would be proud of it, if we cared
enough to be proud about anything.)
"Yes, you can force maturity on them by giving them the responsi
bility of voting. It would be possible to give a TV program on mature
voting to everyone each week." (It could be hosted by Madonna, and
you'd get a spanking if you didn't watch.)
"No. Personally, I don't want to see politics active on the campus like
in Europe." (You mean in Europe they also have meaningless elections
in which the only reason people vote is to get money for pizza?)
