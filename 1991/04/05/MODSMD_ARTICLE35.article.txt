# TREASURE HUNT
## 
### 
Well kids, it's spring quarter.
For some of us it's a time of joy, a
time of peace, a time to get your
roommate stinking drunk and
stick his head in the nearest toi
let and flush until his hair does
that cute little Ed Grimley thing.
For most of us, it's 12 units
and bike rides through our own
little 90-degree rollerblading
Valotte hell. But for others, it's a
desperate, last ditch attempt to
squeeze in 18 units of electrical
engineering and convince your
adviser that the smudge in
Courses and Degrees is really
that non-Western asterisk thing.
But enough about me already,
let's get down to this Treasure
Hunt thing. By the way, is any
body actually doing this, or am I
making a bigger fool of myself
than A 1 Pacino did in that sorrv

Vatican City plea for a Zagnut
bar? (Like I've actually gone to
the trouble of physically placing
a prize out there. You and your
pathetic "I've got the golden
ticket" dreams make me want to
vomit up a delicious, freshly
made cajun dish prepared by
local gourmet restaurant Craw
dad and Company, conveniently
located in the local Palo Alto
area.)
But, as Adrian Zmed once
said after making an embarrass
ing noise during rehearsal, the
show must go on. So here it is:
Clue Number Six.
If you have found le text, you
know that you are looking for
just two more things, one of
which is that magical mystical
instruction that Debby Harry so
entranced us with in the earlv

'80s. So here 'tis. Just let your
fingers do the talking.
The first letter of the
word following Grand,
which might just head the
new fraternity lodge.
The first letter of the
module that is not
Godzilla.
The first letter of the
street where you will find
a perfect family of happy,
yet frightening, bubble
like, paper mache-like
statues, replete with dog.
The first letter of the
girl who used to be "my"
drug, but is now suffering
from nearsightedness.
The first letter of the
hotel chain where the

championship winning
men's basketball team
stayed in during their
harrowing, con-infested
New York experience.
The second letter of
what is confusion, accord
ing to enigmatic local
graffiti artists.
The second letter of the
Commencement speaker
that we managed to bring
to, er, keep at, Stanford.
Well, until next week, amuse
yourself with your little books
and labs and whatever else you
do to make yourself feel impor
tant. Meanwhile, I will be scur
rying about campus with my
water gun, looking for women
sunbathing on their stomach
with their bikinis untied.
I love spring quarter.
