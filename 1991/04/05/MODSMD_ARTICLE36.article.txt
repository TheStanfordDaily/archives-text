## Cardinal returns to Six-Pac action by hosting USC 
### Tyson Vaughan Senior staff writer 
April is the cruellest month.
After a wet March, the Cardi
nal baseball players might be a bit
rusty. But from the looks of April,
they'd better have some WD-40
handy. Rains postponed five
Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division games from last month
to this month. As a result, Stan
ford has played only seven Six-Pac
games so far, and now faces a total
of 20 games in the next 30 days.
The scheduling gods are not
exactly allowing the batsmen to
gradually get up to speed, either.
Today through Sunday they face
No. 2 USC at Sunken Diamond.
The Trojans are in first place in
the Six-Pac with a 14-1 conference
record. After opening their confer
ence season with a loss, they have
since gone 14-0, one game short of
the record set by last year's Cardi
nal squad.
Stanford is ranked No. 6 by
Baseball America and No. 9 by
ESPN/Collegiate Baseball. The
team is in second place in the Six-

Pac at 4-3.
USC is responsible for all three
of the Cardinal's conference
losses, taking Stanford's pitchers
for a 29-run ride.
With the Trojans steamrolling
into Sunken Diamond and the
Cardinal essentially just starting
to get going, and considering that
USC's sweep of Stanford kicked
off their winning streak, the Car
dinal would like nothing better
than to return the favor to the

Trojans.
A sweep of USC would put the
batsmen in good position to take
over first place in the Six-Pac and
give them valuable momentum
heading into what will probably be
the longest month of their coller
giate careers.
"The guys are anxious to play,"
said coach Mark Marquess.
"They've had a good rest. They're
looking forward to playing." He
paused and added, "Course, they
might not feel that way in a few
weeks."
Marquess said that USC's
experience gives them an edge.
"Exerience really counts for a lot

in this conference," he said. "They
have a veteran squad — mostly
juniors and seniors. They've been
throwing real well, they're good
defensively — they're solid."
So what're you gonna do to
beat a team that's hot like USC,
coach?
"We have to pitch well to con
trol them because they're a good
offensive team. We'd like to get
ahead early. If they get ahead
they're real, real tough.
"We haven't been as consistent
as we were early in the 6eason. We
just have to make sure that we
play up to our capability in all
phases of the game."
