# Patel adapting to college tennis
## 
### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
Going from the cr&me-de-la
creme of junior tennis to suc
cess on the Farm is supposed to
be natural. Just keep up those
grades, maintain that age
group ranking, and a spot on
the national champion squad
will be yours.
In reality, it's harder than it
looks.
Just ask Vimal Patel.
The freshman from Ken
tucky was ranked in the top
five nationally from the age of
16. Going pro was always in the
back of his mind, but spending
some time developing with a
championship-caliber college
squad seemed the right thing
to do. Stanford was ideal.
The scholarship came
through as hoped, as did a spot
in the starting singles lineup.
It seemed so easy.
But looks can be deceiving.
Team tennis is more diffi
cult that it appears to junior
players weaned on "me first,"
and serve-and-volley is a whole
different ballgame.
This first year with the Car
dinal is turning out to be one
huge learning experience for
Patel.
"It's a big transition from
junior to college [tennis],"
Patel reflected. "This year I'm
just getting a lot of experience.
I'm still getting used to team
play versus the individual ten
nis I've played my whole life,
and better caliber tennis over
all."
Playing for the benefit of 10
others — and an NCAA title —
doesn't seem too difficult at
first sight. But for an athlete
inundated since pee-wee com
petition with a strategy of play
ing only for himself, it takes
some getting used to. And some
mental adjustment.
At the Rich Macci Tennis
Academy, where Patel spent his
junior and senior years of high
school, the concept of a friendly
foe didn't exist. It was win or
be beaten, even in practice.
"Individual to team play is a
big thing for me. I'm my own
person, and [team playl is a
very different approach," Patel
said.
"At the Academy the past
two years you had to win every
thing for yourself. There was
no camaraderie. Everything
was extremely competitive," he
continued. "Here you work for
the team good. It's one of the
hardest things for me."
While Patel is adapting to
the new mode of competition —
his 10-2 singles record has
helped the Cardinal to a I' 2-1
record, there's also a new style
of play to pick up. No more
overpowering your opponent
from the baseline, it's serve
and volley if you want success
in the collegiate, and profes
sional ranks.
Patel, like most of collegiate
tennis' precocious freshman, is
being forced to adapt.
"My junior game won't
uphold me in college," Patel
said. "It's much more serve
and volley. Once you get to a
certain level of play everyone
can hit the ball well. The differ

ence is mental toughness and
who can play the net well.
"I'm just starting to play the
net more. Coaches (Dick)
Gould and (John) Whitlinger
are really helping me learn
serve-and-volley."
Although Patel has chalked
the season up as a learning
experience, Gould is excited
about the play - and progress
— of one of his newest pro
teges. While agreeing that

'This year I'm just
getting a lot of
experience. I'm
still getting used
to team play ver
sus the individual
tennis I've played
my whole life,
and better caliber
tennis overall.'

Patel has a ways to go in his
game, especially with his serve,
Gould is impressed with the
freshman's performance.
"He's a very talented player
with quick hands and feet,"
Gould said. "He has a flat shot
— like Jimmy Conners — that
can be very potent. When he's
on he's unbeatable.
"When you watch him play
when he's on it's a thing of
beauty."
While Gould stresses that
Patel's serve is far from per
fect, he also likes what he sees
in Patel's developing serve
and-volley game.
"I really like the way he
takes the ball early," Gould
explained. "The advantage is it
gets you up to the net. Vimal
also has a very good return of
serve."
The intense yet friendly
player has the actions to hack
up the compliments. He
cracked the starting singles
lineup in the beginning of the
season, and has been consis
tently playing at the No. five
and six spots. His record in
dual matches is tops on the
team. He recently began com
peting in doubles as well with
Chris Cocotos, and it looks like
he may stay.
Team play may be new, but
Patel has already become a nec
essary component in Stan
ford's NCAA drive.
"Vimal has been a big factor
already. He's going to be very
important to our success this
year," said Gould.
Win or lose, Patel is thor
oughly enjoying his first year
as a Cardinal, both on the court
and off.
He can't say enough about
the opportunities gained from
playing — and practicing —
with the team. Whether it's
learning from others' actions,
receiving advice, or getting moral
support, Patel loves playing for
Stanford.
"It's great when you have guys
like Jonathan (Stark), Jared
(Palmer) and Alex (O'Brien) on
your team to be able to compare
yourself with them when they
were freshmen and to get advice,"
Patel said. "And it's the best prac
tice you can get in the whole U.S.
Basically it's like practicing with

the pros. It's really helpful.
"I also really like the fact that
when my own teammates beat me
in practice they're exposing my
weaknesses and showing me what
I need to work on."
As for the classroom, well, it's
tough, but not as impossible as
Patel feared. And while he still
wants to make it on the pro cir
cuit, Patel has picked up an inter
est in medicine, and is now a pre
med.
The clincher, however, is the
possibility of winning an NCAA
title. Stanford is the three-time
defending national champion.
While the Cardinal is currently

ranked third after a loss to USC
at the National Team Indoors in
February, the team is a favorite to
make it a four-peat.
Patel can't wait.
"I really want to win a title.
Glenn [Solomon] has been here
four years and has had a title
every year," Patel said. "It would
be incredible to come in as a
freshman and have the team win
NCAAs."
A national championship
crown definitely looks possible,
and Patel is one of the reasons
why.
The learning process isn't so
bad after all.

Patel has a ways to go in his
game, especially with his serve,
Gould is impressed with the
freshman's performance.
"He's a very talented player
with quick hands and feet,"
Gould said. "He has a flat shot
— like Jimmy Conners — that
can be very potent. When he's
on he's unbeatable.
"When you watch him play
when he's on it's a thing of
beauty."
While Gould stresses that
Patel's serve is far from per
fect, he also likes what he sees
in Patel's developing serve
and-volley game.
"I really like the way he
takes the ball early," Gould
explained. "The advantage is it
gets you up to the net. Vimal
also has a very good return of
serve."
The intense yet friendly
player has the actions to hack
up the compliments. He
cracked the starting singles
lineup in the beginning of the
season, and has been consis
tently playing at the No. five
and six spots. His record in
dual matches is tops on the
team. He recently began com
peting in doubles as well with
Chris Cocotos, and it looks like
he may stay.
Team play may be new, but
Patel has already become a nec
essary component in Stan
ford's NCAA drive.
"Vimal has been a big factor
already. He's going to be very
important to our success this
year," said Gould.
Win or lose, Patel is thor
oughly enjoying his first year
as a Cardinal, both on the court
and off.
He can't say enough about
the opportunities gained from
playing — and practicing —
with the team. Whether it's
learning from others' actions,
receiving advice, or getting moral
support, Patel loves playing for
Stanford.
"It's great when you have guys
like Jonathan (Stark), Jared
(Palmer) and Alex (O'Brien) on
your team to be able to compare
yourself with them when they
were freshmen and to get advice,"
Patel said. "And it's the best prac
tice you can get in the whole U.S.
Basically it's like practicing with

the pros. It's really helpful.
"I also really like the fact that
when my own teammates beat me
in practice they're exposing my
weaknesses and showing me what
I need to work on."
As for the classroom, well, it's
tough, but not as impossible as
Patel feared. And while he still
wants to make it on the pro cir
cuit, Patel has picked up an inter
est in medicine, and is now a pre
med.
The clincher, however, is the
possibility of winning an NCAA
title. Stanford is the three-time
defending national champion.
While the Cardinal is currently

ranked third after a loss to USC
at the National Team Indoors in
February, the team is a favorite to
make it a four-peat.
Patel can't wait.
"I really want to win a title.
Glenn [Solomon] has been here
four years and has had a title
every year," Patel said. "It would
be incredible to come in as a
freshman and have the team win
NCAAs."
A national championship
crown definitely looks possible,
and Patel is one of the reasons
why.
The learning process isn't so
bad after all.
Going from the cr&me-de-la
creme of junior tennis to suc
cess on the Farm is supposed to
be natural. Just keep up those
grades, maintain that age
group ranking, and a spot on
the national champion squad
will be yours.
In reality, it's harder than it
looks.
Just ask Vimal Patel.
The freshman from Ken
tucky was ranked in the top
five nationally from the age of
16. Going pro was always in the
back of his mind, but spending
some time developing with a
championship-caliber college
squad seemed the right thing
to do. Stanford was ideal.
The scholarship came
through as hoped, as did a spot
in the starting singles lineup.
It seemed so easy.
But looks can be deceiving.
Team tennis is more diffi
cult that it appears to junior
players weaned on "me first,"
and serve-and-volley is a whole
different ballgame.
This first year with the Car
dinal is turning out to be one
huge learning experience for
Patel.
"It's a big transition from
junior to college [tennis],"
Patel reflected. "This year I'm
just getting a lot of experience.
I'm still getting used to team
play versus the individual ten
nis I've played my whole life,
and better caliber tennis over
all."
Playing for the benefit of 10
others — and an NCAA title —
doesn't seem too difficult at
first sight. But for an athlete
inundated since pee-wee com
petition with a strategy of play
ing only for himself, it takes
some getting used to. And some
mental adjustment.
At the Rich Macci Tennis
Academy, where Patel spent his
junior and senior years of high
school, the concept of a friendly
foe didn't exist. It was win or
be beaten, even in practice.
"Individual to team play is a
big thing for me. I'm my own
person, and [team playl is a
very different approach," Patel
said.
"At the Academy the past
two years you had to win every
thing for yourself. There was
no camaraderie. Everything
was extremely competitive," he
continued. "Here you work for
the team good. It's one of the
hardest things for me."
While Patel is adapting to
the new mode of competition —
his 10-2 singles record has
helped the Cardinal to a I' 2-1
record, there's also a new style
of play to pick up. No more
overpowering your opponent
from the baseline, it's serve
and volley if you want success
in the collegiate, and profes
sional ranks.
Patel, like most of collegiate
tennis' precocious freshman, is
being forced to adapt.
"My junior game won't
uphold me in college," Patel
said. "It's much more serve
and volley. Once you get to a
certain level of play everyone
can hit the ball well. The differ

ence is mental toughness and
who can play the net well.
"I'm just starting to play the
net more. Coaches (Dick)
Gould and (John) Whitlinger
are really helping me learn
serve-and-volley."
Although Patel has chalked
the season up as a learning
experience, Gould is excited
about the play - and progress
— of one of his newest pro
teges. While agreeing that

'This year I'm just
getting a lot of
experience. I'm
still getting used
to team play ver
sus the individual
tennis I've played
my whole life,
and better caliber
tennis overall.'
