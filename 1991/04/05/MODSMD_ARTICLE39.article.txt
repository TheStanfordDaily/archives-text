# Women netters take on USC, UCLA
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
The Stanford women's tennis
team is a victim of its own success.
Because the squad almost never
loses, few spectators come out to
watch the Cardinal play. People
figure, "Oh, it'll just be another
blowout. I'll read about it in the
paper."
Once a year, though, spectators
come from far and wide to see the
women in action. The occasion is
the weekend when the UCLA Bru
ins and USC Trojans stride into
town looking to knock off Stan
ford.
While USC probably doesn't
have the horses to beat the 16-1
Cardinal, the match with the Tro
jans today will provide one of the
more interesting confrontations
of the weekend. Trisha Laux, who
plays No. 1 singles for USC, is cur
rently ranked second nationally
according to the latest Volvo Ten
nis/Collegiate poll.
One notch behind her in the
rankings is senior Sandra Birch,
who happens to play No. 1 for the
Cardinal. "OK," you say, "what's
so unusual about a matchup
between top five players at a Stan
ford match?"
Easy, Birch, with one more
NCAA individual championship
and three more team titles than
Laux, has not beaten her in four
tries. If Sandra Birch has an arch
nemesis in college tennis, the 5-
foot,-2 senior from Roswell, Ga. is
it.
"She gets intimidated, gets
defensive [when playing Lauxl,"
said coach Frank Brennan. "Then
Laux starts stepping up and
drilling."
And drill she does. Despite her
lack of physical stature, Laux can
hit the ball a ton — as hard as
anyone in the collegiate ranks.
But despite Birch's lack of luck
against Laux, Brennan thinks this
time will be different. "Sandra is
playing great right now. The
coaching staff came up with some
plans (for the match). Sandra will
implement them . . . and she will
win."
Birch offered her own, slightly

different opinion. "My game isn't
at its peak," she said. "But, I'm
mentally ready." She said her
strategy is to take the aggressive
stance.
"Each time I've played her, she
gets into a groove and makes me
move around the court," Birch
said, explaining that she is force to
become a "counterpuncher."
This time, Birch plans to "take
it to her, come in if I can, really be
aggressive." She said she will try
to play up the middle to prevent
Laux from playing the angles —
which makes the Trojan star dou
bly deadly.
When UCLA visits Saturday,
the Bruins will have a shot at
stopping Stanford. The only ques
tion is how they'll try to do it.
Coach Bill Zaima has done his
best impression of the late Billy
Martin recently, seeming by
pulling his lineup out of a hat.
Consider the following: Against
Arizona, Zaima went with an
order of Kim Po, Iwalani McCalla,
Stella Sampras (Pete's older sis
ter), Cammie Foley, Kirsten
Dreyer and Mamie Ceniza. A day
later versus Arizona State, Zaima
sent out McCalla, Ceniza, Po,
Dreyer, Sampras and Foley,
respectively.
If one considers the relatively
interchangeability of UCLA's
players, it is easier to understand
Zaima's juggling. It is, however,
unusual to alter the lineup so
drastically — especially at this
late stage in the season.


Tracy Allen — Daily file
After a great freshman season at No. 6 singles, Heather Willens has
moved up to No. 4 in the lineup this season. Willens and the Cardi
nal will meet Pac-10 foes USC and UCLA this weekend at the Stan
ford Tennis Stadium.
