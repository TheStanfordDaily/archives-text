# Kennedy won't resign
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
University President Donald
Kennedy vowed yesterday to
remain at Stanford's helm and
guide the University through the
controversy that has erupted over
its indirect cost policies.
"I hope you all know that I
would never prolong my own stay
in the presidency against Stan
ford's best interest," Kennedy
said in a speech to members of the
Faculty Senate.
"But I have good support from
the Board (of Trustees), from
most of the University's friends —
and, I believe, from most of my
faculty colleagues. ... I am cer
tain that with your support and
help Stanford can move through
this difficult period."
Yesterday's address marked the
first time Kennedy has appeared
before the senate since the March
13 hearing of the House Subcom
mittee on Oversight and Investi
gations. At the hearing, Rep. John
Dingell, D-Mich., and other con
gressmen castigated Kennedy for
irresponsible management of fed-

eral research funds.
The hearing
and subsequent
press accounts
focused heavily
on controversial
indirect-cost
charges related to
Kennedy's Uni
versity-owned
residence — such

as flowers, antiques and reception
expenses — that had been
included in an account billed in
part to the government. Newspa
per columnists have since com
pared Kennedy to Leona Helmsley
and Imelda Marcos.
In the aftermath of the hear
ing, several faculty members have
privately suggested that Kennedy
should step down.
Political Science Prof. John
Manley voiced that sentiment
publicly at yesterday's meeting.
"Stanford is currently burning,"
Manley said. "I think it is in the
best interest of Stanford for you
to consider resigning."
