# Collegiate swimming fears an exodus

### 
FEDERAL WAY, Wash. (AP) â€” A tidal wave
has hit college swimming because of a new
NCAA rule which drastically changes the way
athletes train. It's already swept away the col
legiate career of Olympic champion Janet
Evans and coaches say more big names will fol
low.
For its part, the NCAA says the rule is being
misinterpreted and that Evans and other
world class swimmers can still get in as much
supervised pool time as they like.
But the impact is something different and
has left college programs shaking.
"Isn't it sad that someone who is as excel
lent a student as Janet Evans has to quit col
lege to pursue her dream?" Texas women's
coach Mark Schubert asked. "I think it bor
ders on criminal."
Said Evans, competing in the U.S. Long
Course Nationals: "1 think the NCAA is going
to have to get its act together."
Evans of Stanford and Melvin Stewart of
Tennessee, both world record-holders, said
Wednesday they were leaving school to better
prepare for the 1992 Olympics.
Both blamed the new NCAA rule, which
takes effect in August. They said it cuts a
world-class swimmer's supervised workout
schedule, which usually averages 35-40 hours
per week.
But while college swimming officials criti
cized the new rule, the NCAA says the 20-hour
rule is being misinterpreted.

"That limit refers to the amount of time
that a coach can require a student athlete to
participate in his or her sport," NCAA
spokesman Jim Marchiony said Thursday.
"Swimmers can voluntarily practice as many
hours as they want. The coach may be present
during voluntary individual workouts when
the student athlete uses the institution's facil
ities. The coach just can't require you to spend
more than 20 hours a week."
Jeff Dimond, a spokesman for U.S. Swim
ming, the sport's national governing body, said
swimming's interpretation was passed down
through college athletic directors to coaches.
He said the key passage in Marchiony's inter
pretation was "voluntary individual work
outs," which swim coaches have been told
means "they can't conduct a closed, organized
practice" after 20 hours, Dimond said. "Even
though it's an individual sport, a thing that's
often overlooked is the team aspect of practice
and workouts is crucial."
If Marchiony's statement means, however,
that coaching can be conducted past the 20-
hour limit, "that's a change from what we've
been hearing," Dimond said.
No matter how the rule is viewed, the major
impact appears to be on swimming. Track and
field stars have been leaving school for years to
t run for clubs where they could earn money
and also train for Olympic competition.
The defections of Evans and Stewart from
the college ranks have taken center stage at

the biggest meet on the 1991 U.S. Swimming
calender. But eight races were contested and
two up-and-coming U.S. stars nearly broke
world records at the King County Aquatic
Center.
Anita Nail, a 14-year-old high school fresh
man from Towson, Md., twice shattered the
American record in the women's 200-meter
breaststroke Thursday at the U.S. Spring
Nationals swimming meet.
Nail's 2:27.08 in the night finals bettered
her U.S. record of 2:27.89 set in the morning
preliminaries. She bettered the American
mark of 2:29.78 set by Amy Shaw, of Mission
Viejo, Calif, at the 1987 Pan Pacific meet in
Brisbane, Australia.
Nail's 2:27.08 was the second fastest time
in history. East Germany's Silke Hoerner
holds the world record of 2:26.71, set in 1988.
"I wanted to go that fast," Nail said. "I'm
excited. Tonight I felt a little sore but I loos
ened up.
"This morning 1 didn't feel as tight."
Nail said she was confident she could swim
fast times in the meet. "I wanted to but I
wasn't sure if it was possible to swim this
fast," she said.
Stanford graduate Jill Johnson placed third
and sophomore Lori Heisick took fifth.
Nail's swimming reputation is growing fast.
So is her stature. She is a 5-foot-SH, 123-
