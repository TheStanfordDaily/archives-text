# Collegiate swimming fears an exodus
## 
### 
FEDERAL WAY, Wash. (AP) — A tidal wave
has hit college swimming because of a new
NCAA rule which drastically changes the way
athletes train. It's already swept away the col
legiate career of Olympic champion Janet
Evans and coaches say more big names will fol
low.
For its part, the NCAA says the rule is being
misinterpreted and that Evans and other
world class swimmers can still get in as much
supervised pool time as they like.
But the impact is something different and
has left college programs shaking.
"Isn't it sad that someone who is as excel
lent a student as Janet Evans has to quit col
lege to pursue her dream?" Texas women's
coach Mark Schubert asked. "I think it bor
ders on criminal."
Said Evans, competing in the U.S. Long
Course Nationals: "1 think the NCAA is going
to have to get its act together."
Evans of Stanford and Melvin Stewart of
Tennessee, both world record-holders, said
Wednesday they were leaving school to better
prepare for the 1992 Olympics.
Both blamed the new NCAA rule, which
takes effect in August. They said it cuts a
world-class swimmer's supervised workout
schedule, which usually averages 35-40 hours
per week.
But while college swimming officials criti
cized the new rule, the NCAA says the 20-hour
rule is being misinterpreted.

"That limit refers to the amount of time
that a coach can require a student athlete to
participate in his or her sport," NCAA
spokesman Jim Marchiony said Thursday.
"Swimmers can voluntarily practice as many
hours as they want. The coach may be present
during voluntary individual workouts when
the student athlete uses the institution's facil
ities. The coach just can't require you to spend
more than 20 hours a week."
Jeff Dimond, a spokesman for U.S. Swim
ming, the sport's national governing body, said
swimming's interpretation was passed down
through college athletic directors to coaches.
He said the key passage in Marchiony's inter
pretation was "voluntary individual work
outs," which swim coaches have been told
means "they can't conduct a closed, organized
practice" after 20 hours, Dimond said. "Even
though it's an individual sport, a thing that's
often overlooked is the team aspect of practice
and workouts is crucial."
If Marchiony's statement means, however,
that coaching can be conducted past the 20-
hour limit, "that's a change from what we've
been hearing," Dimond said.
No matter how the rule is viewed, the major
impact appears to be on swimming. Track and
field stars have been leaving school for years to
t run for clubs where they could earn money
and also train for Olympic competition.
The defections of Evans and Stewart from
the college ranks have taken center stage at

the biggest meet on the 1991 U.S. Swimming
calender. But eight races were contested and
two up-and-coming U.S. stars nearly broke
world records at the King County Aquatic
Center.
Anita Nail, a 14-year-old high school fresh
man from Towson, Md., twice shattered the
American record in the women's 200-meter
breaststroke Thursday at the U.S. Spring
Nationals swimming meet.
Nail's 2:27.08 in the night finals bettered
her U.S. record of 2:27.89 set in the morning
preliminaries. She bettered the American
mark of 2:29.78 set by Amy Shaw, of Mission
Viejo, Calif, at the 1987 Pan Pacific meet in
Brisbane, Australia.
Nail's 2:27.08 was the second fastest time
in history. East Germany's Silke Hoerner
holds the world record of 2:26.71, set in 1988.
"I wanted to go that fast," Nail said. "I'm
excited. Tonight I felt a little sore but I loos
ened up.
"This morning 1 didn't feel as tight."
Nail said she was confident she could swim
fast times in the meet. "I wanted to but I
wasn't sure if it was possible to swim this
fast," she said.
Stanford graduate Jill Johnson placed third
and sophomore Lori Heisick took fifth.
Nail's swimming reputation is growing fast.
So is her stature. She is a 5-foot-SH, 123-
pounder who has grown four
inches during the past year.
Her previous fastest 200-meter
breaststroke time was 2:30.53 last
December.
World record-holder Stewart
failed in his bid to win the
$100,000 being offered by Las
Vegas, Nev., hotel and casino
owner Bob Stupak to any member
of the Las Vegas Gold Swim Team
to set a world record.
Stewart, a Tennessee junior
who plans to pass up his final year
of college eligibility to prepare for
the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona,
Spain, was clocked in 1:56.83 in
the men's 200-meter butterfly. He
set his world record of 1:55.69 at
the World Championships.
Nicole Haislett, a Florida
freshman, won the 100-meter
freestyle in 55.42. Sophomore
Janel Jorgensen was fourth, just
ahead of Angel Myers Martino.
Senior Suzy Buckovich was ninth.
Martino, a graduate student at
Alabama, was the first U.S. swim
mer in history to be disqualified
for a positive steroids test and has
just returned from suspension.
Her disqualification from the 100-
meter butterfly at the 1988 U.S.
Olympic Trials gave Jorgensen a
spot on the Olympic team. Mar

tino has denied taking steroids
and said the test results were
false.
Janie Wagstaff, a high school
junior from Mission Hills, Kan.,
twice broke the meet record in the
women's 200-meter backstroke.
She swam 2:09.09 in the finals
after going 2:10.23-in the prelimi
naries. Her 2:09.09 was the sec
ond-fastest women's 200-meter
backstroke time ever.
Betsy Mitchell holds the world
and American record of 2:08.60.
Stanford sophomore Lea Love
less was third, junior Dede Trim
ble was fifth and senior Jody
Smith placed 16th.
Freshman Pam Minthorn
placed second to Texas junior
Erika Hansen in the 200-meter
butterfly.
While college swimming has
lost some stars during Olympic
years, a mass exodus may occur
now that Evans and Stewart have
left.
"The dam may be about to
break," Dimond said. "We're all
upset at the NCAA. They have
delivered a major blow to what
has been a very successful pro
gram."
Says Stanford women's coach
Richard Quick: "The new rules
are very clear to me. A swimmer
can only do coach-supervised
training 20 hours a week."
Texas men's coach Eddie Reese
said he planned to recommend to

some of his swimmers that they
take the year off to get ready for
the Olympics.
"There's no way a distance
swimmer can get it done on 20
hours a week," said Reese, whose
teams have won four NCAA titles
in a row.
Ted Tow, the NCAA's associate
executive director, said Ke wasn't
surprised that Evans and Stewart
decided to leave school.
"It's not the function of college
athletics to prepare world-class
athletes," said Tow, in San Diego
for the NCAA President's Com
mission meetings. "The function
of collegiate athletics is just that
— to function within the con
straint of academics.
"You'll always find some out
standing athletes who chose not
to function within the official
framework."
Evans, who will bypass her
final two years at Stanford, added:
"If these new rules would have
been in effect when I got out of
high school, I would never have
gone to college."
Evans said the Stanford
women's swimming team had a
cumulative 3.0 grade point aver
age and she had a 4.0 GPA during
the fall quarter.
"It's absolutely ridiculous,"
Evans said.
Evans accused the NCAA of
taking the easy way out.

FEDERAL WAY, Wash. (AP) — A tidal wave
has hit college swimming because of a new
NCAA rule which drastically changes the way
athletes train. It's already swept away the col
legiate career of Olympic champion Janet
Evans and coaches say more big names will fol
low.
For its part, the NCAA says the rule is being
misinterpreted and that Evans and other
world class swimmers can still get in as much
supervised pool time as they like.
But the impact is something different and
has left college programs shaking.
"Isn't it sad that someone who is as excel
lent a student as Janet Evans has to quit col
lege to pursue her dream?" Texas women's
coach Mark Schubert asked. "I think it bor
ders on criminal."
Said Evans, competing in the U.S. Long
Course Nationals: "1 think the NCAA is going
to have to get its act together."
Evans of Stanford and Melvin Stewart of
Tennessee, both world record-holders, said
Wednesday they were leaving school to better
prepare for the 1992 Olympics.
Both blamed the new NCAA rule, which
takes effect in August. They said it cuts a
world-class swimmer's supervised workout
schedule, which usually averages 35-40 hours
per week.
But while college swimming officials criti
cized the new rule, the NCAA says the 20-hour
rule is being misinterpreted.

"That limit refers to the amount of time
that a coach can require a student athlete to
participate in his or her sport," NCAA
spokesman Jim Marchiony said Thursday.
"Swimmers can voluntarily practice as many
hours as they want. The coach may be present
during voluntary individual workouts when
the student athlete uses the institution's facil
ities. The coach just can't require you to spend
more than 20 hours a week."
Jeff Dimond, a spokesman for U.S. Swim
ming, the sport's national governing body, said
swimming's interpretation was passed down
through college athletic directors to coaches.
He said the key passage in Marchiony's inter
pretation was "voluntary individual work
outs," which swim coaches have been told
means "they can't conduct a closed, organized
practice" after 20 hours, Dimond said. "Even
though it's an individual sport, a thing that's
often overlooked is the team aspect of practice
and workouts is crucial."
If Marchiony's statement means, however,
that coaching can be conducted past the 20-
hour limit, "that's a change from what we've
been hearing," Dimond said.
No matter how the rule is viewed, the major
impact appears to be on swimming. Track and
field stars have been leaving school for years to
t run for clubs where they could earn money
and also train for Olympic competition.
The defections of Evans and Stewart from
the college ranks have taken center stage at

the biggest meet on the 1991 U.S. Swimming
calender. But eight races were contested and
two up-and-coming U.S. stars nearly broke
world records at the King County Aquatic
Center.
Anita Nail, a 14-year-old high school fresh
man from Towson, Md., twice shattered the
American record in the women's 200-meter
breaststroke Thursday at the U.S. Spring
Nationals swimming meet.
Nail's 2:27.08 in the night finals bettered
her U.S. record of 2:27.89 set in the morning
preliminaries. She bettered the American
mark of 2:29.78 set by Amy Shaw, of Mission
Viejo, Calif, at the 1987 Pan Pacific meet in
Brisbane, Australia.
Nail's 2:27.08 was the second fastest time
in history. East Germany's Silke Hoerner
holds the world record of 2:26.71, set in 1988.
"I wanted to go that fast," Nail said. "I'm
excited. Tonight I felt a little sore but I loos
ened up.
"This morning 1 didn't feel as tight."
Nail said she was confident she could swim
fast times in the meet. "I wanted to but I
wasn't sure if it was possible to swim this
fast," she said.
Stanford graduate Jill Johnson placed third
and sophomore Lori Heisick took fifth.
Nail's swimming reputation is growing fast.
So is her stature. She is a 5-foot-SH, 123-
pounder who has grown four
inches during the past year.
Her previous fastest 200-meter
breaststroke time was 2:30.53 last
December.
World record-holder Stewart
failed in his bid to win the
$100,000 being offered by Las
Vegas, Nev., hotel and casino
owner Bob Stupak to any member
of the Las Vegas Gold Swim Team
to set a world record.
Stewart, a Tennessee junior
who plans to pass up his final year
of college eligibility to prepare for
the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona,
Spain, was clocked in 1:56.83 in
the men's 200-meter butterfly. He
set his world record of 1:55.69 at
the World Championships.
Nicole Haislett, a Florida
freshman, won the 100-meter
freestyle in 55.42. Sophomore
Janel Jorgensen was fourth, just
ahead of Angel Myers Martino.
Senior Suzy Buckovich was ninth.
Martino, a graduate student at
Alabama, was the first U.S. swim
mer in history to be disqualified
for a positive steroids test and has
just returned from suspension.
Her disqualification from the 100-
meter butterfly at the 1988 U.S.
Olympic Trials gave Jorgensen a
spot on the Olympic team. Mar

tino has denied taking steroids
and said the test results were
false.
Janie Wagstaff, a high school
junior from Mission Hills, Kan.,
twice broke the meet record in the
women's 200-meter backstroke.
She swam 2:09.09 in the finals
after going 2:10.23-in the prelimi
naries. Her 2:09.09 was the sec
ond-fastest women's 200-meter
backstroke time ever.
Betsy Mitchell holds the world
and American record of 2:08.60.
Stanford sophomore Lea Love
less was third, junior Dede Trim
ble was fifth and senior Jody
Smith placed 16th.
Freshman Pam Minthorn
placed second to Texas junior
Erika Hansen in the 200-meter
butterfly.
