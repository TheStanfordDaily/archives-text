# Track team tours Texas
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Staff writer 
One of the biggest and best track meets in
the country started Wednesday and kicks into
high gear today. Unfortunately for the Stan
ford track team the results from the Texas
Relays thus far are a bit disappointing.
All-American heptathlete Peggy Odita failed
to place in the seven-event competition. Coach
Brooks Johnson said the reasons for the
senior's sub-par performances were unclear.
He cited the early-morning start and time
difference between California and Texas as
possible factors but said the results were prob
ably due to "general malaise."
Despite the early disappointment the team
has reason for optimism. Senior Debbie
Malueg competes in the shot put today. She
placed third at the Pacific 10 Conference meet
last year in the event.
Sophomore Jamie Marek will face stiff com
petition in the pole vault. Marek has shown
promise, taking first while vaulting a personal
record of 16 feet, seven and three-quarter
inches in a meet against USC, UC-Irvine and
Cal State-Northridge earlier this year.
Qualifying begins for the women's 4xloo
- relay team. The squad placed last at the
Diet Pepsi Track Challenge over spring break
because of a missed hand-off between sopho
more Rhonda Oliver and senior Alysia Hub
bard. The team will challenge for a top finish
this weekend.
The long jump also begins today and Cardi
nal senior Marcus Hickerson hopes for a top
place finish. Hickerson said he has been ready
for this meet for several weeks.
He has won several competitions including
the Diet Pepsi Track Challenge but has not yet
jumped 25 feet this year. It was at the Texas
Relays last year that Hickerson emerged as a
top contender in the Pac-10 with a leap of 25
feet, five and a half inches.
Another event in which Stanford is expected
to place highly is the men's distance medley.
Last year the Cardinal squad won the Texas
Relays. Johnson believes that teams from
Arkansas, Georgetown and Arizona will chal
lenge for the distance medley title today.
The team may also face opposition from the
elements. It rained Thursday in Austin and
may slow the competitors if it keeps up.
