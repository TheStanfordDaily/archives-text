# Spikers challenge UC-Irvine tomorrow

After 10 consecutive league
losses, the Cardinal men's volley
ball team will face the threat of
post-season elimination as they
match up with UC-Irvine tomor
row night at Burnham Pavilion.
A loss would all but eliminate
ninth-ranked Stanford's chances
to earn one of the eight berths in
the April 24-27 Western Intercol
legiate Volleyball Association
tournament.
If Loyola Mary mount defeated
Hawaii (2-10 in conference) late
last night in the Islands, it would
force the Cardinal (6-11 overall, 4-
10 in WIVA play) to beat Irvine
and then perform the seemingly
impossible task of knocking off
unbeaten, top-ranked USC, just to
keep their hopes alive.
Coach Ruben Nieves and his
players, however, are taking the
same approach they have
throughout the extended losing
streak: one match at a time.
"I've been proud of the way our
this team has handled the losing
streak. I think we have been pre
pared for each match, and
throughout the streak, we've
always been competitive and in
most every match," he said.
They certainly were in the
three matches of last weekend's
Southern Californian road trip.
Two of the matches went five
games, and in the last one, against
Cal State-Northridge, the Cardi
nal held a 2-1 lead in games.
"The Northridge match was
one of our two best matches of the
year. All season we've been ham
pered by our inconsistency, but we
played a very steady match down
there," Nieves said.
"Yet in many ways that match
reflects our entire season. We
were in a position to win, but in
crunch time they made the big
plays and we didn't. The streak
has hurt a lot more because we've
lost so many of those close
matches that we had an opportu
nity to win," he said.

Stanford received another dose
of bad news this week when it
learned that NIT Tournament
MVP and expected middle blocker
Adam Keefe opted not to join the
team for the end of its season.
Keefe cited numerous personal
reasons for his decision, according
to Nieves.
But in the past two weeks the
Cardinal's middle blocker position
has received an enormous boost
from the emergence of freshman
Joe Burghardt. Burghardt
started in the squad's unofficial
match against a club team from
California, and has been in the
starting lineup since.
"In the last five matches Joe
has played as well as any of our
starters. He's given us great
blocking, but more importantly,
he has been getting a lot of kills
with very few hitting errors.
That's why he's hitting well over
.400 (actually .495) right now,"
Nieves said.
The 18th-ranked UC-Irvine
Anteaters enter Saturday's match
on the brink of elimination, as
well. Their WIVA record is 3-10,
and they too, will likely have to
win the remainder of their
matches to stay in the playoff pic
ture.
Irvine is led by middle blocker
Steve Florentine, currently rinth
in WIVA blocking with 1.41 per
game.

Freshman setter Canyon Ceman has done a good job for the Cardinal this season
after earning the starting role. Stanford will attempt to revive flagging playoff hopes
against the UC-lrvine Anteaters tomorrow night in Burnham Pavilion.
