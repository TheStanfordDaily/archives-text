# Men take on Oklahoma at regionals
## 
### Noah Blake Staff writer 
This weekend's NCAA western regionals is the
Stanford men's gymnastics team's biggest meet of
the season — and yet to be the favorite to win the
national championship, the Cardinal may not even
have to win.
Make no mistake, second-ranked Stanford must
perform more consistently then it has in its last two
meets in order to boost team confidence. But a
regional win is not a necessity.
Provided the Cardinal finishes among the top
four teams this weekend, it will earn a ticket to the
NCAA finals at Penn State. After last season's disap
pointing finish, coach Sadao Hamada is understand
ably cautious about guaranteeing a trip to Pennsyl
vania. However, he will admit that an "average per
formance" by the team would probably be good
enough to make the finals.

'We have not been consistent
enough. But if we can hit the
same number of routines as Okla
homa, we will win.'
— Sadao Hamada

Not that Hamada will be satisfied with an average
performance. The Cardinal has had two of those con
secutively, and the team must gain momentum
before it goes to the finals. But a victory this week
end may be too much to ask.
The regionals are in Norman, Okla. Interestingly
enough, Norman is the home of the Oklahoma Soon
ers, the No. 1 team in the country. Add to this the
fact that senior Tim Wang and junior Tim Ryan will
not be 100 percent for the regionals, and the problem
is clear.
In the finals, the Cardinal will presumably be
healthier, and in addition will not have to deal with
thousands of screaming Sooner faithful. Although
the finals will provide Stanford with a better oppor
tunity to win, the regionals are equally important,
because the team has a chance to show the country
that it is consistent as well as loaded with talent.
Talent has certainly not been the problem this
year, as sophomore Jair Lynch (third-ranked nation
ally in all-around, first on parallel bars, second on
high bar) and freshman Mark Booth (first on floor
exercise, tied for third on high bar) have led a power
ful Cardinal team through the season.
But Stanford has missed too many routines, and
Hamada feels that this inconsistency must be elimi
nated if the team is to win it all. "We have not been
consistent enough," he said. "But if we can hit the
same number of routines as Oklahoma, we will win."
Although Stanford must perform more consis
tently this weekend to build confidence and momen
tum, the team does not need to beat Oklahoma. The
Cardinal can wait until finals, when they will face
the Sooners on a neutral floor, for that.

Jair Lynch and his Cardinal teammates have been practicing to improve their consis
tency the past few weeks. Second-ranked Stanford will receive a progress report this
weekend at the NCAA west regionals in Oklahoma.
