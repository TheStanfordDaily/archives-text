# Crew teams head to San Diego meet
## 
### Amy Wusterbarth Staff writer 
The men's basketball and
swim teams proved that, even
though they did not have stel
lar regular-season records,
they could still pull off big post
season wins. Hopefully, the
men's crew team can do the
same.
Coming off of a 2-3 defeat to
Santa Barbara last weekend
the men are facing even stiffer
competition this weekend at
the San Diego Crew Classic on
Mission Bay.
T)ie women rowers will also
wrangle with many of the
toughest teams in the nation as
they try to maintain their per
fect record in San Diego.
Last year, the Cardinal
women finished seventh in the
nation. This weekend they will
face Wisconsin, which placed
fourth at Nationals last year
and Syracuse, which placed
sixth. Virginia — 1990's small
school champion — will be
looking for a victory over the
Cardinal as well.
According to women's coach
John Davis, California will also
be a big threat. "They beat us
all season last year and then we
came on strong at the end,"
said Davis. "They're out for
blood this year."
The women got good prac
tice over spring break by racing
two formidable teams — Ore
gon State and Santa Barbara.
Back-to-back victories gave the
young Cardinal squad a boost
of confidence going into this
weekend's regatta.
The men's competition
should be just as stiff. "We'll be
meeting the best crews in the
country," said men's coach
Wieslaw Kujda. The Cardinal
will be at the starting line with
Harvard, Navy and other t< p
schools.
The men are gearing up for
this event even though their
main focus is the Pacific 10
Conference Championships in
Mav "Pac-lOs are the be-all

'We just want to go
down and feel out
the competition.'

and end-all for us," freshman
Chris Fruhauf said. "If we can
prove ourselves in San Diego it
should say something about
what we can do at Pac-lOs."
This may be hard to do
though, because Kujda's strat
egy is for the men to "gain
speed from week to week" and
peak at Pac-lOs rather than try
to start strong and maintain
their speed. With this in mind,
Kujda said, "If we make the
final (in San Diego), I'll be
happy."
The Cardinal will be facing
schools who make San Diego
the focus of their season, doing
two-week tapers ahead of time.
In contrast, the Stanford men
have been practicing hard all
week.
"Wies told us that the team
that wins San Diego loses Pac
lOs," said varsity coxswain,
Matt "Rollie" Rollefson. "We
just want to go down and feel
out the competition, compete
against fast crews and go a lit
tle faster than we did in the last
race. That's kind of the plan for
the whole season."
Going faster than they did
in the last race shouldn't be too
hard for the varsity men. Los
ing to an arguably weaker
Santa Barbara squad, the Car
dinal was a bit rushed and not
quite relaxed enough, Rollie
said.
"We didn't row our kind of
race and they rowed theirs. We
weren't efficient. But when we
get to Pac-lOs we'll be right up
there in front," Rollie said.
The varsity, junior varsity,
novice and freshman divisions
will each have two heats on
Saturday. The top three finish
ers in each heat will then race
in the finals on Sunday.
