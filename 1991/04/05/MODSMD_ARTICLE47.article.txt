# Twelve more schools targeted
## Government to review overhead cost practices 
### 
WASHINGTON IAP) - The Hush administration
is targeting 12 mt\jor universities for audits of fed
eral research programs following questions about
Stanford University's billing of luxury costs to the
government.
Investigators from the Department of Health and
Human Services have begun financial reviews of the
overhead costs of programs at four of the schools
under a new long-range auditing plan, officials said.
Development of the plan began about a year ago,
but officials said its implementation was speeded by
the General Accounting Office's inquiry at Stanford,
which was found to have billed the government for
items such as an antique commode, a cedar-lined
closet and depreciation on a yacht.
The HHS inspector general's office has begun
audits at Yale University, the University of Pennsyl
vania, Johns Hopkins University and Dartmouth
College, said Judy Holtz, a spokeswoman for the
office.
At Harvard Medical School in Cambridge, Mass.,
GAO investigators met with university officials
Wednesday as part of an investigation of that
school's research spending. Jan Goldstein, a regional
manager for the agency in Boston, said Harvard
Medical School attracted attention because it was
charging the government a high rate for overhead
expenses.
"Do they just have higher rates because this is
Boston and costs are higher here, or are they mis
charging something?" Goldstein asked.
The HHS inspector general's office is contacting
eight to 10 other schools about upcoming audits, she
said, but she could not identify them until they had

been notified, Holtz said.
The schools were selected based on their share of
federal grants, their overhead rates and on their
location because the inspector general wanted to
include institutions in various regions of the coun
try, said one official who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
Johns Hopkins, Yale and Pennsylvania were
among top recipients of federal money in 1989,
according to the inspector general's office.
Johns Hopkins topped the list with $411 million.
Yale was 11th with $146 million and Pennsylvania
was 14th with $133 million.
The GAO plans to conduct inquiries at three
other schools: Harvard Medical School, Mas
sachusetts Institute of Technology and the Univer
sity of California, Berkeley — all of which have high
overhead costs, said Cliff Fowler, a GAO official
involved in the inquiries.
Schools are allowed to bill the government for cer
tain costs — overhead — that are not earmarked
specifically for a particular sponsored project but
result from combined or joint use, such as costs for
utilities, library services and building depreciation.
Johns Hopkins and Pennsylvania had overhead
rates of 65 percent, and Yale, 68 percent, of their
direct research program costs, the inspector general
said.
Dartmouth was not on the list of the top '20 recip
ients, but it was selected for an audit because the
inspector general's office had already been asked by
another government agency to help in a different but
related accounting review of the school, the official
said.
