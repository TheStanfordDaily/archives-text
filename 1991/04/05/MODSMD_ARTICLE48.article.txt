# Sexist, violent graffiti in dorm disturbs Donner residents
## 
### Kim McCreery 
Residents of Donner got quite a shock earlier this
week when they walked into their basement pool
room and found graffiti many considered sexist and
offensive covering the walls.
Samples include:
"Rednecks must die."
"If a woman says no, she means yes!"
"You're all f—ing slaves."
"Have you banged a box today?"
Several residents of the all-freshman dormitory
said they are angry about the incident. "A majority of
the people here are outraged. That's men and
women," said resident Laura Battaglia. She called
one of the comments "very threatening because it
condoned rape."
During winter quarter, students got permission
and art supplies from the dorm to repaint the decay
ing pool room. Similar projects have been successful
in other residences, such as Lagunita, where student
art helped to add some zest to older recreational
rooms.
Students had been encouraged to decorate the
room with leftover paint in whatever manner they
chose. But over spring break, the project apparently
degenerated when a group of students added the
offensive graffiti to the murals.
A "very thorough" dorm meeting was held
Wednesday night to discuss the incident, said Resi
dent Fellow Linda Paulson. No decisions were made
regarding repainting or punishment of the students
involved, but Paulson said "I hope the students
responsible will be able to clean the room up and I
hope they'll be responsible for restoring it to its orig
inal condition. We are working right now with the
Resident Management Office to make sure that that
happens."
Battaglia said, "Our meeting got a lot of feelings
out in the open, but I don't think the RAs handled it
very well."
Resident Assistant Adrian Miller, a senior, said
the meeting was held partly to let the students

involved come forward and explain their actions.
Miller would not release any names, but he said most
have been identified.
He also explained that one of the main issues the
meeting addressed is determining of what is art and
what is not art. "It brought up the whole issue of
First Amendment freedom of expression," he said.
"But some of the words were offensive to a lot of stu
dents and we've got to take that into consideration."
Paulson said she was offended when she saw the
graffiti. "I was saddened that it was in my house. It
was violent and it was a congregation of violent sen
timents that were coupled with anti-female senti
ments and I just didn't know that people in my dorm
felt that way."
RA Lisa Heckler, a senior, said she was disturbed
by more than just the sentiments in the graffiti.
"The room was destroyed, and it is a very violent,
unwelcome place," she said. "That goes beyond the
misogyny in some of the quotes."
Many students living in Donner, especially
women, said they are dealing with anger and fear
about the motives of the students who painted the
obscenities. Battaglia said, "I didn't realize what
hate I live with. It's very confusing."
Resident Ellen Coffey described the comment
about "rednecks" as "sick and very threatening."
She said it showed violence she thought was disgust
ing. She said, "I don't understand what caused it.
That's what's so scary about it all."
She added that she used to like to play pool, but
she no longer goes into the pool room because she
wants to avoid the graffiti.
Christine Nash said he thinks the graffiti had
"sexist undertones" and showed "blatant disre
spect." She added that she was offended "that these
people thought they had the right to take a room
that was commonly ours. It was obviously meant to
exert anger.
"I'm angry that I live with these people," Nash
said. "And I don't feel comfortable." She said that
the quote about "If a woman says no, she means yes"
was taken from Rousseau and that some Donner res

idents excused the quote because they said they
learned it in their Cultures, Ideas and Values class.
A few students don't seem to be too worried
about the problem, as long as it gets cleaned up. Res
ident Won Rhee said, "It offended me, but there's
not much I can do about it now. I have to live with it
for a while, but it's not a hassle."
Estimates of the damage won't be available until

maintenance workers uncover more information
about the type of paint used and the extent of repairs
the room will need.
At the meeting, it was proposed that the students
repaint the pool room with new murals, in which
case the damage would be only the cost of the new
paint, residents said.
