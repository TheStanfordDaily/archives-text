# New Asian-American fraternity forms
## 
### Robin Mathison Staff writer 
A group of Asian-American students has
started a new fraternity, Lambda Phi
Epsilon, which was officially recognized by
the University this week as a new student
organization.
The fraternity will focus on Asian-Ameri
can issues, but members say they encourage
men of all races to join. Lambda Phi Epsilon
plans to hold an informal rush this spring
and hopes to become a full voting member of
the Interfraternity Council.
Sophomore Mike Yun decided to try to
bring the fraternity to Stanford in February
after meeting chapter members from UC-
Berkeley and UC-Santa Barbara. He said he
was impressed by their support and close
ness.
"We're definitely not here to separate our
selves from the rest of the community," said
senior Hanns Lee, one of four founding
members.
"We intend to be a visible group on cam
pus," Lee said. "We're not here to make an
Asian male group that is exclusive. Our cam
pus-wide activities, parties and such, are for
everyone."
Yun, now fraternity president, contacted
three interested friends and began to con
struct a constitution explaining the group's
goals. Yun worked with Program and Frater
nal Affairs Adviser Michael Ramsey-Perez
throughout March to ensure that the pro
posal met University guidelines.
Late last month, Ramsey-Perez approved
the fraternity's 13-page constitution, estab
lishing Lambda Phi Epsilon as a provisional
fraternity so members could begin planning

an informal Rush.
To be permanently recognized by the Uni
versity as a fraternity, its constitution has to
be approved by Nanci Howe, assistant direc
tor of Tresidder Union and then by Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Michael Jackson
and Acting Dean of Student Affairs Norman
Robinson.
To become an official member of the IFC,
Lambda Phi Epsilon would have to approved
bv current IFC members. IFC Chair Erik
Jorgensen said the first step would be for
council officials to inform the new fraternity
of IFC rules and social policies and to see
whether the group's goals are compatible
with these policies.
Jorgensen called the Asian-American fra
ternity "a great idea" and said the IFC
always welcomes "new dimensions." He
added that the University usually will recog
nize any fraternity that the IFC recognizes.
Yun's main goal for the fraternity is
"tight brotherhood," he said. Some of his
other goals include contributing a lot to the
community in terms of social events and
social services. "We hope to be seen as profes
sional in our manners and be seen as respon
sible. We hope to have a lot of fun, too," he
said.
Lambda Phi Epsilon's four members —
Yun, Lee and seniors Don Chin and Alan
Tien — will be responsible for shaping the
fraternity this spring. They will hold an
informal Rush with information sessions,
small dinners, a barbecue-sports day and a
party.
"We're really going to be looking at the
rushees for what they want to see in the fra
ternity," said Lee. "That's going to be the
most unique aspect of our Rush."

The group seeks enthusiastic new mem
bers who want to work hard to develop the
fraternity, said Yun.
"We hope that people of all ethnic groups
will want to join," said Lee.
Yun said he harbors only two fears about
the future of Lambda Phi Epsilon: negative
preconceptions and logistical problems. He
worries that people may misjudge his frater
nity as segregationist, since the national
chapter of Lambda Phi Epsilon was founded
in 1981 mostly by Asian-Americans.
"That's not what we want. It's a name
we've already been given when we haven't
even done anything. After people see what
we're about and what we do they'll see we're
not a separate entity from the Greek sys
tem," he said.
Chin said the fraternity "will provide a
role model in the way of identity and will
support other Asian organizations."
Sophomore Bridgit Evans, a member of
Alpha Kappa Alpha, a predominantly black
sorority, praised Lambda Phi Epsilon for
addressing Asian-American issues. "Certain
needs are met [in an ethnic fraternity] that
aren't met in other organizations. . . . Yet
they have a responsibility to do a lot of
awareness work to make people understand
the significance of that organization," she
said.
Lambda Phi Epsilon has been established
nationally at UCLA, and chapters have
expanded to UC-Berkeley, UC-Santa Bar
bara, UC-Davis, UC-Irvine and the Univer
sity of Texas at Austin. A colony, the name
for a newly instituted national chapter, has
recently been founded at Sacramento State
University.
