# Fund raising unaffected by controversy
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
Contrary to reports in
Bay Area newspapers last
week, negative publicity sur
rounding the indirect-cost
controversy seems to have
had little effect on the Uni
versity's fund-raising eff
orts.
Contributions from last
month "were nearly identi
cal" to March of a year ago,
according to Centennial
Campaign director John
Wirth. Furthermore, he
said, while February contri
butions were down from the
previous year, they were higher
than in February 1989.
"There's no trend," Wirth said
in an address yesterday to the Fac
ulty Senate.
A story in The Peninsula Times
Tribune last week said Stanford
donors had been turned off by the
indirect-cost controversy. But,
Wirth said, there's no hard evi
dence to support that conclusion.
He called the story "creative jour
nalism."
In recent telephone solicita

tions, Wirth said, only 8 percent of
those contacted raised questions
about the controversy over Stan
ford's use of federal research
funds. Of those who did mention
the controversy, half said they
support Stanford, according to
Wirth.
The negative publicity sur
rounding Stanford peaked in mid-
March following the one-day hear
ing by the House Subcommittee
on Oversight and Investigations
and a segment on the ABC News
program "20/20."
