# Stanford students win Truman award
## 
### Peter Cousins Staff writer 
Two Stanford students have
been selected to receive
$30,000 Truman scholarships
for the next four years of their
educations.
History major Joanne Lin
and public policy major Allen
Thorpe were chosen in the
nationwide competition last
month. Both will graduate in
1992.
Harry S. Truman scholar
ships are awarded annually to
juniors committed to careers in
public service, including gov
ernment positions. The schol
arship was created in memory
of the former president.
Lin said she was "pleased"
to learn she was a recipient of
the scholarship. She added that
she is honored but is feeling a
"huge burden" of positive pres
sure. "It's been a real boost to
my confidence."
The initial encouragement
to apply for the scholarship
came from a faculty member in
the History Department, Lin
added. She described the appli
cation form as "pretty exten
sive" and said it included an
essay on public policy, ques
tions regarding her goals in
public service and public policy
and a resume of her activities
in public service.
Thorpe, a former assistant

advertising manager for The
Daily, is currently attending
the Stanford-in-Florence pro
gram and could not be reached
for comment.
After being approved by the
University selection commit
tee, Lin and Thorpe were eval
uated at state and regional
selections. They were then
selected as scholarship recipi
ents. About 80 other applicants
from across the country also
won the scholarship.
Economics Prof. Gavin
Wright, a member of the selec
tion committee at Stanford,
said the scholarship applicants
have consistently been
"remarkable young people."
The task of the committee,
headed by Political Science
Prof. Hubert Marshall, is to
name the University's nomi
nees for the scholarships from
the Stanford applicants.
Robert McGinn, professor of
Values, Technology, Science
and Society, said he was glad
the scholarship exists because
it gives "a boost to people who
seem highly qualified."
Lin has taken part in several
programs in public policy while
a Stanford student. While
attending Stanford-in-Wash
ington, she interned on the
Select Committee on Children,
Youth and Families of the
House of Representatives and
with Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan.
