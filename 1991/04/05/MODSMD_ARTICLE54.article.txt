# Teahouse to reopen as late-night snack bar
## 
### Marie Bui Staff writer 
The Teahouse in Wilbur Hall opens again
today, but the managers will not be selling the
usual fare of egg rolls, chow mein and fortune
cookies. They will be giving them away.
Head manager Don Chin, a senior, said he
has not yet obtained the license from the
county Health Department that is required to
charge for food. Tomorrow's open-house,
scheduled from 4 to 7 p.m., is a "happy hour to
celebrate its reopening," Chin said.
He said he hopes students will wander in
and observe the $10,000 worth of changes in
the Teahouse, which include a new ceiling,
floor and an improved oven hood. In addition,
the electrical system, which was cited as a
health and safety violation last quarter, has

been modified. The wires still look the same,
though, he added.
Although the small cinder-block room
appears unchanged, it is now defined as a
"snack bar," which allows it to operate under
less stringent regulations than "a commercial
kitchen." Customers can still consume their
noodles sitting down — on the floor. Chin
expects to buy tables and chairs later.
The Teahouse was cited at the end of winter
quarter for violations ranging from fire haz
ards to plain dirt. Flammable paper fans hung
on the walls and hot-plate cords were frayed.
Funding for the renovations was provided
by the Housing Facilities Projects. Revenue
from sales next year may be reinvested in the
Teahouse.
Chin and the 10 other managers hope to
have the snack bar open for business next

week, from 10 p.m. to midnight, Sunday
through Thursday.
"Around that time people get hungry. It's a
good place for a study break," said Chin,
explaining the demand for a late-night snack
bar.
The Teahouse has been satisfying cravings
of Stanford students since 1971. Founded by
the Asian American Student Association to
help raise money for that organization, the
Teahouse is now autonomous and not-for
profit. Sales only cover costs.
Although AASA no longer profits directly
from Teahouse sales, member organizations
can take over the place for a night to raise
money. For example, the Korean American
Student Association could volunteer workers
and keep the net profits for one night, with the
managers' permission.
