# Stanford coalition demands University diversify faculty

### Marci Shore Staff writer 
The stereotype of white, male law pro
fessors in tweed may be a thing of the
past, if the Coalition for a Diversified Fac
ulty convinces universities to adopt more
stringent affirmative action policies.
As part of the national movement's
Day of Action, the Stanford chapter of the
coalition gathered yesterday to release its
new petition asking the law school to take
a more aggressive affirmative action pol
icy. The group also celebrated the recent
hiring of two targeted minority professors

at the Law School.
Displaying a rainbow of balloons and
banners exclaiming "This is only the
beginning" and "What a great start!",
coalition members encouraged passers-by
to sign the petition. The coalition's new
affirmative action plan demands the
administration increase targeted group
minority hiring according to a specific
timetable and proportions as well as allow
for more student input in faculty hiring.
The guidelines stipulate that the per
centage of minority law school faculty
should reflect the ethnic composition of
the larger of either the student body or

the general population.
Paul Brest, dean of the Law School,
said he was unfamiliar with the coali
tion's plan and declined to comment. He
added that the Law School faculty is cur
rently drafting an affirmative action plan
which will be submitted for comment to
the entire student body next week.
The two new professors, who were
hired during the past few weeks, are
Janet Halley, who is a lesbian, and Kim
Taylor, a black woman currently head of
the public defender's office in Washing
ton, I).C. Law students signed brightly
colored banners with the messages "SLS

Welcomes Kim Taylor" and "Welcome
Janet Halley." Both will take their posi
tions next September.
Stanford's Coalition for Diversified
Faculty formed two years ago, when "dif
ferent communities at the law school who
had similar concerns" about the disad
vantages of a homogeneous faculty
decided to come together, said John
Young, a third-year law student active in
the coalition.
"We need to have some type of mecha
nisms to ensure that this progress contin
ues," said Young. Even if two of the aver
age of three hires per year were from tar

geted minority groups, it would be 10
years before the law school faculty would
reflect the population, he explained.
The coalition includes a variety of law
school associations, including the Asian-
American, Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian,
Native American, Stanford Latino and
Black Law Students' Associations, as well
as the Women of Stanford Law.
Members seek to make the faculty rep
resentative of the diverse student body.
"The most important thing is that all the
different groups are united together â€”
