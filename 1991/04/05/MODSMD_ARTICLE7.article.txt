# Econ major to be intensified
##

More math and more courses are on
the horizon for future economics mtyors
if proposed changes are approved by the
department's faculty.
The proposal would eliminate the
qualitative economic policies and per
spectives track, and the minimum num
ber of units needed to fulfill the major's
core requirements would jump from 45
to 55. All majors would have to take a
writing course on economic policy. Also,
the senior research paper requirement
would be abolished.
While final details are still being
worked out, department officials say the
new curriculum will most likely be
implemented for the 1992-93 academic
year.
In light of the recently increased
requirements for both the economics

and history majors, Dean of Undergrad
uate Studies Thomas Wasow said, "those
two majors . . . are on the light side, so
that if these changes take place, it's
bringing them more into line with some
other majors."
Wasow said he looks favorably on
departments re-examining their curric
ula, and "if in the judgment of experts in
the field, that involves adding units,
that's fine. If arguments can be made for
reducing units, I'm in favor of that, too."
Under the current system majors
have a choice between two tracks â€”
quantitative economics, and economic
perspectives and policies. The quantita
tive track requires finishing Calculus 43,
while the more qualitative perspectives
and policies track focuses on economic
problems and issues without extensive
use of math.
The proposed changes are pri
marily in response to comments
of graduating majors during the
past several years, said Audrey
Carlson, the undergraduate assis
tant in the department.
Many students wrote that the
major was "too easy," Carlson
said.
The department also discov
ered that more than one-third of
the students majoring in eco
nomics also had a second major,
she added.
Professor Gavin Wright, the
department chair, said the goal of
the new curriculum is "to go back
to a unified system in which all
students have a strong math
background."
Wright said the department
discovered that requiring all eco
nomics majors to take math
through Calculus 41 or the equiv
alent would effect only 25 percent
of the students. "It's within
reach, something everyone could
achieve with only one or two addi
tional courses," Wright said.
In a survey conducted by the
department, Stanford students

were found to have a much
stronger background in math
than was previously believed. "A
large number of students enter
Stanford with advanced place
ment in math and many go on to
take to higher" level courses,
Carlson said.
Carlson said that by increasing
the requirements for the major,
the department expects the num
ber of major? to decrease signifi
cantly.
Wright added that in surveying
a half-dozen other major universi
ties, the department found that
virtually all of them required
more overall courses and had
more stringent math require
ments than Stanford.
Reactions of many current
majors seem to be overwhelm
ingly in favor of the proposed
changes.
Senior Lizzu Castaneda said,
"1 definitely think it is a good
change. Of the people I know
majoring in economics, we have
all agreed (the) qualitative (track)
was useless." She added that
many students found it difficult
to get a job because students were
not prepared for the technical
qualifications demanded by many
employers.
