### Joanna Sosinska Staff writer 
Tom Seligman was appointed yester
day as the new director of the Stanford
Museum of Art, which has been sched
uled to reopen in 1994.
Seligman will be in charge of Art
Gallery exhibits and oversee the rebuild
ing and fund raising for the museum,
which was extensively damaged in the
Earthquake of 1989 and has been closed
since.
A $12 million budget has been desig
nated for seismic renovations, new heat
ing and lighting systems, lighting con
trol and the addition of some exhibition
spaces.
His appointment also marks the first
time in Stanford's history that the
museum will have a full-time director.
While previous directors have had
only part-time involvement in museum
affairs, "The museum has matured to
the point where it needs a full-time

administrator," said Wanda Corn, cur
rently acting director of the museum
and chair of the Art Department.
Corn has been acting director since
September 1989, when Lorenz Eitner,
the previous director, retired.
Although a full-time director was
sought immediately after Eitner's
retirement, the effort was halted by the
Earthquake of 1989, Corn said.
Seligman is currently the deputy
director of the Fine Arts Museum of San
Francisco, where he has worked for the
past 18 years. He graduated from Stan
ford in 1965 with a degree in political
science and then attended the Academy
of Art in San Francisco. While serving in
the Peace Corps in Liberia, he was direc
tor of the African Museum at Cutting
ton College, Liberia.
He will take part in a May 14 cere
mony representing both Leland Stan
ford Jr.'s birthday and the hundredth
anniversary of the date the museum
cornerstone was laid. Seligman will not

assume the directorship, however, until
Aug. 1.
"I look forward to returning to a com
munity which nourished me, and I hope
to nourish others and contribute to the
continued excellence at Stanford,"
Seligman said.
Seligman's appointment was made
by Ewart Thomas, dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences and Carolyn
Lougee, the associate dean. The School
of Humanities and Sciences oversees the
museum's operations.
He "is a very dynamic leader and I
hope we will work actively to make the
museum a greater part of the education
here," said Lougee. "He won't just put
art on exhibits and on walls. He will
come up with creative ways of present
ing art."
Seligman said, "The challenges are to
get to know the University and the key
players in the administration and the
faculty with the objective to have
them [incorporate the museum]
into the fabric of the University."
He also said he hopes to be able
to expand the museum's collec
tion. "There is a unique opportu
nity in 1991 because donors may
give art works to museums and
take the full value of the art as a
tax deduction," said Seligman.
This is a marvelous time for
development of collections, espe
cially those given as gifts, he
added.
Loutree said the museum has

primarily been used by students
in archeology and art. "It could be
useful to many more depart
ments," said Lougee.
Seligman said he hopes to
teach African art in the Art
Department after the museum
reopens. "I'm a workaholic and
I'm very interested in Africa.
LWhetherl I'll be able to work
depends on too many unknowns
at this time," he said.
The museum is a nationally
recognized architectural monu
ment. It was founded by Jane
Stanford and contains art the
Stanford family gathered as a pri
vate collection. Leland Stanford
Jr. had hoped to be a museum
curator.
