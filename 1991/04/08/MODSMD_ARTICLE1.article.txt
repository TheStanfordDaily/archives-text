Twenty months ago, the relationship
between Stanford and the Hoover Insti
tution was at a low point. After a decade
of disputes over the institution's proper
role in the University, the notoriously
outspoken W. Glenn Campbell had just
been pressured to step down as Hoover
director by the Board of Trustees.
But today, Stanford and Hoover are
cooperating to an extent unknown in
recent years, a development that has
outraged long-time critics of the rela-

tionship but has been applauded by most
University officials, Hoover scholars and
Stanford faculty.
For years, individuals from Stanford
and Hoover debated Hoover's perceived
conservative agenda and its academic
independence from the University. Stan
ford-Hoover ties weathered a number of
faculty petitions and accusations, includ
ing a fight over Campbell's bid to locate
the Ronald Reagan Library and Policy
Center on campus in 1986-87, as well as
a number of smaller fights over appoint-

ments and oversight at Hoover.
But since Campbell's resigna
tion after a 30-year tenure, such
issues have not been raised and
Stanford-Hoover relations have
quietly improved.
Campbell's successor, John
Raisian, has been cited by Hoover
scholars as the main reason for
improved relations with the Uni
versity.
Hoover, founded as a resource
center in 1919 to house extensive
library and archival materials,
gained independence from the
University in 1959. Following the
wishes of President Herbert
Hoover, the Board of Trustees
declared the center "an indepen
dent institution within the frame
of Stanford University."
That independence is the crux
of the issue for Hoover critics like
Political Science Prof. John Man
ley and English Prof. Ronald Reb
holz, who argue that Hoover's
spending and appointments
should be brought under normal
academic control, or the institu
tion should be totally separated
from the University.
During the 1980s, Manley and
Rebholz sponsored several contro
versial bills in the Faculty Senate
calling for studies of the relation
ship between Hoover and Stan
ford.
But now, "I don't feel any ten
sion [with the University] at all,"
said senior research fellow
Charles Hill. "I attribute that to
John Raisian, who is doing a spec
tacular job."
University President Donald
Kennedy added, "John Raisian
has done a wonderful job, and
Stanford faculty has taken the ini
tiative to work more closely with
Hoover."
Greater involvement with
University policy
As the cold war with Hoover
winds down, the Institution has
played a greater role in University
affairs. Last year Raisian was
given a position in the newly-cre
ated University Cabinet, a body
that sets University policy on
issues including indirect cost
recovery and budget "reposition
ing."
The other members of the cab
inet are the deans of each of the
University's seven schools, along
with the provost, the dean of
research and the director of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter. The Cabinet is chaired by
Kennedy and is the highest level
of policy organization within the
L^niversity.
Provost James Rosse said the
President's Office and the
Provost's Office are the principal
decision-making bodies of the
University, but they operate with
the "consent, guidance and votes"
of the cabinet.
1 loover "is a part of the Univer
sity, so it needs to be a part of the
University's decisions," Rosse
said.
Kennedy added that Hoover's
involvement "is helpful, as is
[Raisian 'sj very constructive and
collegial attitude."
According to Raisian, Hoover
has "never had an involvement
like that in recent decades," in
which the Institution takes part
in"the general business of the
University" rather than just the
issues that relate to Hoover.
However, Manley and Rebholz
object to Hoover's greater involve
ment, maintaining that it is detri
mental to Stanford's reputation.
"The problem," Manley said, "is
that this University is committed
to professional, apolitical activi
ties, and yet it is trying to exist
with a think tank that pushes its
own causes and uses the Univer
sity's good name to do that."
Rebholz said that despite its
new director, Hoover has not
essentially changed its mission,
"which was defined by Herbert
Hoover as fighting socialism and
promoting capitalism."
Campbell vs. Kennedy?
Campbell, who now holds the
position of "counselor for life" at

Hoover, blames Kennedy for
strained Hoover-Stanford rela
tions during the last decade.
"We had excellent relations
with the University in the 19705,"
Campbell said, "and that didn't
cease until Kennedy started mak
ing accusations against me."
Campbell said he thinks
Kennedy instigated faculty criti
cism of Hoover to undermine his
position and force him to resign.
Now, he said, critics like Manley
and Rebholz "are President
Kennedy's problem. He unleashed
them, and now he needs to re
leash them."
The former Hoover director
also does not take their criticism
seriously "I've not met either of
them in my life, and I have no
desire to meet them," he added.
"They're jokes. I wouldn't debate
them under any circumstances."
Kennedy dismissed Campbell's
charge, saying "it will amuse
Manley and Rebholz to learn that
I once had them leashed."
Campbell said there is less ten
sion now between Hoover and
Stanford, but the overall situation
"won't improve until the current
president ceases to be president.
John Raisian is a nice man, but
unfortunately he is dealing with
someone who is very arrogant,
and that man's name is Donald
Kennedy."
A valuable resource
Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy, unlike Manley and
Rebholz, downplays the impor
tance of Hoover's ideology and
focuses instead on its value as a
research facility.
Abernethy, who teaches
African politics, said he relies very
heavily on Hoover's library. A
divorce from Hoover would make
it more difficult to carry out
research, he noted.
He added that he only objects
to Hoover when it attempts to
"significantly increase its policy
goal on campus." For that reason,
he opposed Hoover's attempts to
place the Reagan Library and the
Reagan Policy Center on campus
in 1986.
Abernethy emphasized that his
opposition to the library was not
ideologically motivated. "I'm not
fundamentally unhappy with
[Hoover], but I did become mobi-

lized against it when an effort was
made to expand the responsibili
ties of Hoover locally."
He said the University needs to
be a place where people with many
political positions can debate
them — "it improves the quality
of discussion."
Stephen Krasner, chair of the
Political Science Department for
the past six years, said closer rela
tions with Hoover are "absolutely
a very positive development" and
a benefit for the University as a
whole. The new closeness "is a big
plus for the faculty and the stu
dents," he said.
Critics like Manley and Reb
holz "don't capture the complex
ity of the situation," he said.
Hoover does not have a single
agenda, as the critics assert, he
added.
"It's inaccurate to classify
[Hoover] as a right-wing institu
tion" because it has a diverse
group of scholars who pursue
their own agendas, he said.

In a February 1988 Viewpoint
published in The Daily, Manley
contended that "No university
can tolerate within its midst a
highly autonomous, politically
active think tank, whether that
think tank espouses the view of
Adam Smith or Karl Marx."
But Raisian does not plan to
bring Hoover under normal aca
demic control. "My relationship
with the president is perfect as it
is now. I would do nothing to
change it."
He characterizes the Stanford-
Hoover relationship in plainer
terms than its critics. "Stanford is
about teaching and research,"
Raisian said, while Hoover is
about research that has a public
policy focus. "There is an overlap
of research there. We should
exploit that . . . whenever we can
and develop the interests and
opportunities that we share."
Kennedy agrees. "Hoover
brings wonderful scholars and
valuable archives to this place,"
he said. "As long as Stanford can
work with Hoover, it's good for
everyone, and everyone except
John Manley recognizes that."
But Campbell said the relation
ship is not equally beneficial.
"Stanford needs the Hoover Insti
tution more than Hoover needs
Stanford," he argued. "Particu
larly now, because the University
is in trouble. I know all about
receptions and overhead."
Joint appointments create
tension
One of the main sources of ten
sion between Stanford and
Hoover has been the issue of joint
appointments — professors who
split time between Hoover and the
University, with each institution
paying half of the salary.
Currently, one-fifth of all
Hoover fellows — 11 — hold joint
appointments at Stanford.
In the past, individual depart
ments have clashed with Hoover
over the appointments. In the
most serious case, senior fellow
Bruce Bueno de Mesquita was
denied a joint appointment to the
political science department.
However, Bueno de Mesquita
eventually received a courtesy
appointment, which means he is
permanently assigned to Hoover
but participates in research at

Stanford.
Four other Hoover fellows hold
courtesy appointments.
Kennedy capsulized the Uni
versity's current position. "There
will be more, rather than fewer,
joint appointments, and there will
be more, rather than less, interac
tion with Hoover," he said.
However, Raisian said he is
wary of having too many joint
appointments because Hoover
could lose some of its indepen
dence from Stanford.
"I would never want to move
toward a position of having only
joint appointments," he said. "1
don't see the mission of the
Hoover Institution as being a col
lection of joint appointments."
Instead, Raisian emphasized
the importance of courtesy
appointments as a way of improv
ing relations with the University.
Manley said that although he does
not dispute the individual quality
of many of the scholars who hold
the appointments, he is dismayed

at the "way Hoover uses [the
appointments |."
He added that joint appoint
ments are detrimental to the Uni
versity because Hoover uses them
to "buff its image and increase its
legitimacy" at the expense of
Stanford's reputation.
But senior fellow Gerald Dorf
man, who holds a joint appoint
ment with the department of con
tinuing studies, said his two posi
tions make him "more a part of
the University."
When Raisian took over, Dorf
man added, "Hoover people and
University people began to work
together for the first time."
Dorfman noted that there has
been "a soothing going on here,"
and Raisian has been "an impor
tant figure" in easing the tension.
He is "just the right kind of per
son to fill the job. He's a friendly,

decent, very even-tempered guy."
Hoover's smoother style
For Hoover critics, that is
exactly the problem. They argue
that Hoover's conservative
agenda has not changed, but its
style — its ability to "package" its
research differently, which
Raisian said is one of his goals —
has changed.
"If anything, having a
smoother director like Raisian is
bad for us," Manley said. "Hoover
will still be Hoover, no matter how
'nice' its director is."
Rebholz agreed. "The status
quo under Raisian is pretty much
the status quo under Campbell,"
he said.
"In some ways," Manley said,
"I was sorry to see Glenn Camp
bell go. He was so candid about
Hoover's goals that it gave us
ammunition against it." Now, he
said, its reports will be "sanitized"
to present a better picture.

"When we get the annual
reports it's doubtful we'll find out
anything at all," Rebholz said.
"We won't find out exactly what
they're up to because we won't
have Campbell as our source of
truth."
Financing called an issue
Manley and Rebholz also criti
cize the financial relationship
between Stanford and Hoover.
They said the closer relations are
designed to satisfy the large com
panies and foundations that con
tribute to both Stanford and
Hoover.
Rebholz said money "is the real
reason for rejecting separation."
In an letter to The Daily two
years ago, Manley wrote: "Neither
Kennedy nor the Board of
Trustees has the guts [to consider
separating from Hoover] for one
reason — the big donations from
companies like Hewlett-Packard
to both Stanford and Hoover.
They are frightened-from eVienat
ing that money from Stanford."
Hoover has a $125 million
endowment and an annual budget
of $18 million, Raisian said. Of its
total annual budget, $4 million
comes from the University for the
maintenance of Hoover's library
and archives; the remaining $14
million comes from private
sources and income from the
endowment.
Several major individuals and
foundations donate to both Stan
ford and Hoover. In his 1989
annual report, Campbell thanked
Hoover's "long-time, loyal con
tributors," including the John M.
Olin Foundation and the Pew
Memorial Trust.
The two are contributors
to both Stanford and Hoover, said
Elizabeth Sloan, director of com
munications in the Office of
Development.
Campbell also noted in his
report that funds to build the Lou
Henry Hoover Building at the
Institution in 1964 came from
contributors that included long
time Stanford donor David
F^cick&rd
In May 1986, Packard donated
$70 million to fund the Univer
sity's new Children's Hospital,
according to Richard Bennett,
associate campaign director in the
Office of Development. It was the
largest gift from a private donor
in Stanford history.
John Ford, vice president for
development, denied that the
fund-raising overlaps have an
impact on the University's policy.
"The Office of Development is a
service organization," he said.
"We are here to raise money for
the Universitv and its affiliates,

and there are good programmatic
reasons to do that. To the degree
that Hoover is an academic orga
nization, we are here to help thenv
raise money."
Kennedy also dismissed Man-*
ley's accusation that a fear of los-;
ing donations helps determine
University policy toward Hoover,t
saying such a suggestion is;
"entirely without foundation." •
Charles Palm, Hoover's deputy"
director, said that although he"
would not speculate on the Uni
versity's motivations for closer
relations with Hoover, "There are
a host of good reasons why rela- - *
tions should be close.
"The most important is that
both institutions have much to
gain from academic interaction
that can exist between our schol
ars and Stanford scholars," he
added.
A 'respectful' relationship
► The players in the Stanford-
Hoover debate disagree on the
future of the relationship.
Manley sees it as a cyclical
fight, currently experiencing a
lull. But he said the lull will be
broken when Hoover embroils the
University in a political cause that
damages its credibility. "At the
moment, we're waiting for the
next outbreak."
Abernethy characterized the
tensions with Hoover as "intrin
sic" because of its history as "a
separate kind of institution, it's
here, but it's not fully here." That
philosophy of separation, which
Hoover has always strived to pro
tect, will prevent the institution
from ever becoming fully assimi
lated into the University, he said.
But Abernethy thinks the
major tensions with Hoover are
over. "I don't think there will be
the equivalent of the Reagan
Library fight in the future," he
said.
Stanford-Hoover relations,
Kennedy said, are "good and
improving."
Krasner said he thinks future
relations between Stanford and
Hoover will be quite positive.
"The relationship in the past was
an aberration."
Said Dorfman, "Over time,
that kind of conflict worked its
way through."
Hill said, "A lot of people have
profited by trying to stir up diffi
culties, but that's all in the past."
"We're all part of the same uni
versity, and we want to have the
assets of the entire University
community operating together in
a respectful way."

Hoover Institution director John Raisian is widely cited as a primary reason for warming relations

reason — the big donations from
companies like Hewlett-Packard
to both Stanford and Hoover.
They are frightened-from eVienat
ing that money from Stanford."
Hoover has a $125 million
endowment and an annual budget
of $18 million, Raisian said. Of its
total annual budget, $4 million
comes from the University for the
maintenance of Hoover's library
and archives; the remaining $14
million comes from private
sources and income from the
endowment.
Several major individuals and
foundations donate to both Stan
ford and Hoover. In his 1989
annual report, Campbell thanked
Hoover's "long-time, loyal con
tributors," including the John M.
Olin Foundation and the Pew
Memorial Trust.
The two are contributors
to both Stanford and Hoover, said
Elizabeth Sloan, director of com
munications in the Office of
Development.
Campbell also noted in his
report that funds to build the Lou
Henry Hoover Building at the
Institution in 1964 came from
contributors that included long
time Stanford donor David
F^cick&rd
In May 1986, Packard donated
$70 million to fund the Univer
sity's new Children's Hospital,
according to Richard Bennett,
associate campaign director in the
Office of Development. It was the
largest gift from a private donor
in Stanford history.
John Ford, vice president for
development, denied that the
fund-raising overlaps have an
impact on the University's policy.
"The Office of Development is a
service organization," he said.
"We are here to raise money for
the Universitv and its affiliates,

and there are good programmatic
reasons to do that. To the degree
that Hoover is an academic orga
nization, we are here to help thenv
raise money."
Kennedy also dismissed Man-*
ley's accusation that a fear of los-;
ing donations helps determine
University policy toward Hoover,t
saying such a suggestion is;
"entirely without foundation." •
Charles Palm, Hoover's deputy"
director, said that although he"
would not speculate on the Uni
versity's motivations for closer
relations with Hoover, "There are
a host of good reasons why rela- - *
tions should be close.
"The most important is that
both institutions have much to
gain from academic interaction
that can exist between our schol
ars and Stanford scholars," he
added.
A 'respectful' relationship
► The players in the Stanford-
Hoover debate disagree on the
future of the relationship.
Manley sees it as a cyclical
fight, currently experiencing a
lull. But he said the lull will be
broken when Hoover embroils the
University in a political cause that
damages its credibility. "At the
moment, we're waiting for the
next outbreak."
Abernethy characterized the
tensions with Hoover as "intrin
sic" because of its history as "a
separate kind of institution, it's
here, but it's not fully here." That
philosophy of separation, which
Hoover has always strived to pro
tect, will prevent the institution
from ever becoming fully assimi
lated into the University, he said.
But Abernethy thinks the
major tensions with Hoover are
over. "I don't think there will be
the equivalent of the Reagan
Library fight in the future," he
said.
Stanford-Hoover relations,
Kennedy said, are "good and
improving."
Krasner said he thinks future
relations between Stanford and
Hoover will be quite positive.
"The relationship in the past was
an aberration."
Said Dorfman, "Over time,
that kind of conflict worked its
way through."
Hill said, "A lot of people have
profited by trying to stir up diffi
culties, but that's all in the past."
"We're all part of the same uni
versity, and we want to have the
assets of the entire University
community operating together in
a respectful way."


Carolina Katz — Dally
Hoover Institution director John Raisian is widely cited as a primary reason for warming relations
between Hoover and the University. His appointment to the University Cabinet, one of the highest deci
sion-making bodies at Stanford, signaled the extent to which Hoover and Stanford are forming new ties.

'John Raisian is a nice
man, but unfortunately he
is dealing with someone
who is very arrogant...
Donald Kennedy.'
— Glenn Campbell

'My relationship with the
president is perfect as it is
now. I would do nothing to
change it.'
— John Raisian

Twenty months ago, the relationship
between Stanford and the Hoover Insti
tution was at a low point. After a decade
of disputes over the institution's proper
role in the University, the notoriously
outspoken W. Glenn Campbell had just
been pressured to step down as Hoover
director by the Board of Trustees.
But today, Stanford and Hoover are
cooperating to an extent unknown in
recent years, a development that has
outraged long-time critics of the rela-

tionship but has been applauded by most
University officials, Hoover scholars and
Stanford faculty.
For years, individuals from Stanford
and Hoover debated Hoover's perceived
conservative agenda and its academic
independence from the University. Stan
ford-Hoover ties weathered a number of
faculty petitions and accusations, includ
ing a fight over Campbell's bid to locate
the Ronald Reagan Library and Policy
Center on campus in 1986-87, as well as
a number of smaller fights over appoint-

ments and oversight at Hoover.
But since Campbell's resigna
tion after a 30-year tenure, such
issues have not been raised and
Stanford-Hoover relations have
quietly improved.
Campbell's successor, John
Raisian, has been cited by Hoover
scholars as the main reason for
improved relations with the Uni
versity.
Hoover, founded as a resource
center in 1919 to house extensive
library and archival materials,
gained independence from the
University in 1959. Following the
wishes of President Herbert
Hoover, the Board of Trustees
declared the center "an indepen
dent institution within the frame
of Stanford University."
That independence is the crux
of the issue for Hoover critics like
Political Science Prof. John Man
ley and English Prof. Ronald Reb
holz, who argue that Hoover's
spending and appointments
should be brought under normal
academic control, or the institu
tion should be totally separated
from the University.
During the 1980s, Manley and
Rebholz sponsored several contro
versial bills in the Faculty Senate
calling for studies of the relation
ship between Hoover and Stan
ford.
But now, "I don't feel any ten
sion [with the University] at all,"
said senior research fellow
Charles Hill. "I attribute that to
John Raisian, who is doing a spec
tacular job."
University President Donald
Kennedy added, "John Raisian
has done a wonderful job, and
Stanford faculty has taken the ini
tiative to work more closely with
Hoover."
Greater involvement with
University policy
As the cold war with Hoover
winds down, the Institution has
played a greater role in University
affairs. Last year Raisian was
given a position in the newly-cre
ated University Cabinet, a body
that sets University policy on
issues including indirect cost
recovery and budget "reposition
ing."
The other members of the cab
inet are the deans of each of the
University's seven schools, along
with the provost, the dean of
research and the director of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter. The Cabinet is chaired by
Kennedy and is the highest level
of policy organization within the
L^niversity.
Provost James Rosse said the
President's Office and the
Provost's Office are the principal
decision-making bodies of the
University, but they operate with
the "consent, guidance and votes"
of the cabinet.
1 loover "is a part of the Univer
sity, so it needs to be a part of the
University's decisions," Rosse
said.
Kennedy added that Hoover's
involvement "is helpful, as is
[Raisian 'sj very constructive and
collegial attitude."
According to Raisian, Hoover
has "never had an involvement
like that in recent decades," in
which the Institution takes part
in"the general business of the
University" rather than just the
issues that relate to Hoover.
However, Manley and Rebholz
object to Hoover's greater involve
ment, maintaining that it is detri
mental to Stanford's reputation.
"The problem," Manley said, "is
that this University is committed
to professional, apolitical activi
ties, and yet it is trying to exist
with a think tank that pushes its
own causes and uses the Univer
sity's good name to do that."
Rebholz said that despite its
new director, Hoover has not
essentially changed its mission,
"which was defined by Herbert
Hoover as fighting socialism and
promoting capitalism."
Campbell vs. Kennedy?
Campbell, who now holds the
position of "counselor for life" at

Hoover, blames Kennedy for
strained Hoover-Stanford rela
tions during the last decade.
"We had excellent relations
with the University in the 19705,"
Campbell said, "and that didn't
cease until Kennedy started mak
ing accusations against me."
Campbell said he thinks
Kennedy instigated faculty criti
cism of Hoover to undermine his
position and force him to resign.
Now, he said, critics like Manley
and Rebholz "are President
Kennedy's problem. He unleashed
them, and now he needs to re
leash them."
The former Hoover director
also does not take their criticism
seriously "I've not met either of
them in my life, and I have no
desire to meet them," he added.
"They're jokes. I wouldn't debate
them under any circumstances."
Kennedy dismissed Campbell's
charge, saying "it will amuse
Manley and Rebholz to learn that
I once had them leashed."
Campbell said there is less ten
sion now between Hoover and
Stanford, but the overall situation
"won't improve until the current
president ceases to be president.
John Raisian is a nice man, but
unfortunately he is dealing with
someone who is very arrogant,
and that man's name is Donald
Kennedy."
A valuable resource
Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy, unlike Manley and
Rebholz, downplays the impor
tance of Hoover's ideology and
focuses instead on its value as a
research facility.
Abernethy, who teaches
African politics, said he relies very
heavily on Hoover's library. A
divorce from Hoover would make
it more difficult to carry out
research, he noted.
He added that he only objects
to Hoover when it attempts to
"significantly increase its policy
goal on campus." For that reason,
he opposed Hoover's attempts to
place the Reagan Library and the
Reagan Policy Center on campus
in 1986.
Abernethy emphasized that his
opposition to the library was not
ideologically motivated. "I'm not
fundamentally unhappy with
[Hoover], but I did become mobi-

lized against it when an effort was
made to expand the responsibili
ties of Hoover locally."
He said the University needs to
be a place where people with many
political positions can debate
them — "it improves the quality
of discussion."
Stephen Krasner, chair of the
Political Science Department for
the past six years, said closer rela
tions with Hoover are "absolutely
a very positive development" and
a benefit for the University as a
whole. The new closeness "is a big
plus for the faculty and the stu
dents," he said.
Critics like Manley and Reb
holz "don't capture the complex
ity of the situation," he said.
Hoover does not have a single
agenda, as the critics assert, he
added.
"It's inaccurate to classify
[Hoover] as a right-wing institu
tion" because it has a diverse
group of scholars who pursue
their own agendas, he said.

In a February 1988 Viewpoint
published in The Daily, Manley
contended that "No university
can tolerate within its midst a
highly autonomous, politically
active think tank, whether that
think tank espouses the view of
Adam Smith or Karl Marx."
But Raisian does not plan to
bring Hoover under normal aca
demic control. "My relationship
with the president is perfect as it
is now. I would do nothing to
change it."
He characterizes the Stanford-
Hoover relationship in plainer
terms than its critics. "Stanford is
about teaching and research,"
Raisian said, while Hoover is
about research that has a public
policy focus. "There is an overlap
of research there. We should
exploit that . . . whenever we can
and develop the interests and
opportunities that we share."
Kennedy agrees. "Hoover
brings wonderful scholars and
valuable archives to this place,"
he said. "As long as Stanford can
work with Hoover, it's good for
everyone, and everyone except
John Manley recognizes that."
But Campbell said the relation
ship is not equally beneficial.
"Stanford needs the Hoover Insti
tution more than Hoover needs
Stanford," he argued. "Particu
larly now, because the University
is in trouble. I know all about
receptions and overhead."
Joint appointments create
tension
One of the main sources of ten
sion between Stanford and
Hoover has been the issue of joint
appointments — professors who
split time between Hoover and the
University, with each institution
paying half of the salary.
Currently, one-fifth of all
Hoover fellows — 11 — hold joint
appointments at Stanford.
In the past, individual depart
ments have clashed with Hoover
over the appointments. In the
most serious case, senior fellow
Bruce Bueno de Mesquita was
denied a joint appointment to the
political science department.
However, Bueno de Mesquita
eventually received a courtesy
appointment, which means he is
permanently assigned to Hoover
but participates in research at

Stanford.
Four other Hoover fellows hold
courtesy appointments.
Kennedy capsulized the Uni
versity's current position. "There
will be more, rather than fewer,
joint appointments, and there will
be more, rather than less, interac
tion with Hoover," he said.
However, Raisian said he is
wary of having too many joint
appointments because Hoover
could lose some of its indepen
dence from Stanford.
"I would never want to move
toward a position of having only
joint appointments," he said. "1
don't see the mission of the
Hoover Institution as being a col
lection of joint appointments."
Instead, Raisian emphasized
the importance of courtesy
appointments as a way of improv
ing relations with the University.
Manley said that although he does
not dispute the individual quality
of many of the scholars who hold
the appointments, he is dismayed

at the "way Hoover uses [the
appointments |."
He added that joint appoint
ments are detrimental to the Uni
versity because Hoover uses them
to "buff its image and increase its
legitimacy" at the expense of
Stanford's reputation.
But senior fellow Gerald Dorf
man, who holds a joint appoint
ment with the department of con
tinuing studies, said his two posi
tions make him "more a part of
the University."
When Raisian took over, Dorf
man added, "Hoover people and
University people began to work
together for the first time."
Dorfman noted that there has
been "a soothing going on here,"
and Raisian has been "an impor
tant figure" in easing the tension.
He is "just the right kind of per
son to fill the job. He's a friendly,

decent, very even-tempered guy."
Hoover's smoother style
For Hoover critics, that is
exactly the problem. They argue
that Hoover's conservative
agenda has not changed, but its
style — its ability to "package" its
research differently, which
Raisian said is one of his goals —
has changed.
"If anything, having a
smoother director like Raisian is
bad for us," Manley said. "Hoover
will still be Hoover, no matter how
'nice' its director is."
Rebholz agreed. "The status
quo under Raisian is pretty much
the status quo under Campbell,"
he said.
"In some ways," Manley said,
"I was sorry to see Glenn Camp
bell go. He was so candid about
Hoover's goals that it gave us
ammunition against it." Now, he
said, its reports will be "sanitized"
to present a better picture.

"When we get the annual
reports it's doubtful we'll find out
anything at all," Rebholz said.
"We won't find out exactly what
they're up to because we won't
have Campbell as our source of
truth."
Financing called an issue
Manley and Rebholz also criti
cize the financial relationship
between Stanford and Hoover.
They said the closer relations are
designed to satisfy the large com
panies and foundations that con
tribute to both Stanford and
Hoover.
Rebholz said money "is the real
reason for rejecting separation."
In an letter to The Daily two
years ago, Manley wrote: "Neither
Kennedy nor the Board of
Trustees has the guts [to consider
separating from Hoover] for one
reason — the big donations from
companies like Hewlett-Packard
to both Stanford and Hoover.
They are frightened-from eVienat
ing that money from Stanford."
Hoover has a $125 million
endowment and an annual budget
of $18 million, Raisian said. Of its
total annual budget, $4 million
comes from the University for the
maintenance of Hoover's library
and archives; the remaining $14
million comes from private
sources and income from the
endowment.

Stanford," he argued. "Particu
larly now, because the University
is in trouble. I know all about
receptions and overhead."
Joint appointments create
tension
One of the main sources of ten
sion between Stanford and
Hoover has been the issue of joint
appointments — professors who
split time between Hoover and the
University, with each institution
paying half of the salary.
Currently, one-fifth of all
Hoover fellows — 11 — hold joint
appointments at Stanford.
In the past, individual depart
ments have clashed with Hoover
over the appointments. In the
most serious case, senior fellow
Bruce Bueno de Mesquita was
denied a joint appointment to the
political science department.
However, Bueno de Mesquita
eventually received a courtesy
appointment, which means he is
permanently assigned to Hoover
but participates in research at

Stanford.
Four other Hoover fellows hold
courtesy appointments.
Kennedy capsulized the Uni
versity's current position. "There
will be more, rather than fewer,
joint appointments, and there will
be more, rather than less, interac
tion with Hoover," he said.
However, Raisian said he is
wary of having too many joint
appointments because Hoover
could lose some of its indepen
dence from Stanford.
"I would never want to move
toward a position of having only
joint appointments," he said. "1
don't see the mission of the
Hoover Institution as being a col
lection of joint appointments."
Instead, Raisian emphasized
the importance of courtesy
appointments as a way of improv
ing relations with the University.
Manley said that although he does
not dispute the individual quality
of many of the scholars who hold
the appointments, he is dismayed

at the "way Hoover uses [the
appointments |."
He added that joint appoint
ments are detrimental to the Uni
versity because Hoover uses them
to "buff its image and increase its
legitimacy" at the expense of
Stanford's reputation.
But senior fellow Gerald Dorf
man, who holds a joint appoint
ment with the department of con
tinuing studies, said his two posi
tions make him "more a part of
the University."
When Raisian took over, Dorf
man added, "Hoover people and
University people began to work
together for the first time."
Dorfman noted that there has
been "a soothing going on here,"
and Raisian has been "an impor
tant figure" in easing the tension.
He is "just the right kind of per
son to fill the job. He's a friendly,

decent, very even-tempered guy."
Hoover's smoother style
For Hoover critics, that is
exactly the problem. They argue
that Hoover's conservative
agenda has not changed, but its
style — its ability to "package" its
research differently, which
Raisian said is one of his goals —
has changed.
"If anything, having a
smoother director like Raisian is
bad for us," Manley said. "Hoover
will still be Hoover, no matter how
'nice' its director is."
Rebholz agreed. "The status
quo under Raisian is pretty much
the status quo under Campbell,"
he said.
"In some ways," Manley said,
"I was sorry to see Glenn Camp
bell go. He was so candid about
Hoover's goals that it gave us
ammunition against it." Now, he
said, its reports will be "sanitized"
to present a better picture.

"When we get the annual
reports it's doubtful we'll find out
anything at all," Rebholz said.
"We won't find out exactly what
they're up to because we won't
have Campbell as our source of
truth."
Financing called an issue
Manley and Rebholz also criti
cize the financial relationship
between Stanford and Hoover.
They said the closer relations are
designed to satisfy the large com
panies and foundations that con
tribute to both Stanford and
Hoover.
Rebholz said money "is the real
reason for rejecting separation."
In an letter to The Daily two
years ago, Manley wrote: "Neither
Kennedy nor the Board of
Trustees has the guts [to consider
separating from Hoover] for one
reason — the big donations from
companies like Hewlett-Packard
to both Stanford and Hoover.
They are frightened-from eVienat
ing that money from Stanford."
Hoover has a $125 million
endowment and an annual budget
of $18 million, Raisian said. Of its
total annual budget, $4 million
comes from the University for the
maintenance of Hoover's library
and archives; the remaining $14
million comes from private
sources and income from the
endowment.
Several major individuals and
foundations donate to both Stan
ford and Hoover. In his 1989
annual report, Campbell thanked
Hoover's "long-time, loyal con
tributors," including the John M.
Olin Foundation and the Pew
Memorial Trust.
The two are contributors
to both Stanford and Hoover, said
Elizabeth Sloan, director of com
munications in the Office of
Development.
Campbell also noted in his
report that funds to build the Lou
Henry Hoover Building at the
Institution in 1964 came from
contributors that included long
time Stanford donor David
F^cick&rd
In May 1986, Packard donated
$70 million to fund the Univer
sity's new Children's Hospital,
according to Richard Bennett,
associate campaign director in the
Office of Development. It was the
largest gift from a private donor
in Stanford history.
John Ford, vice president for
development, denied that the
fund-raising overlaps have an
impact on the University's policy.
"The Office of Development is a
service organization," he said.
"We are here to raise money for
the Universitv and its affiliates,

and there are good programmatic
reasons to do that. To the degree
that Hoover is an academic orga
nization, we are here to help thenv
raise money."
Kennedy also dismissed Man-*
ley's accusation that a fear of los-;
ing donations helps determine
University policy toward Hoover,t
saying such a suggestion is;
"entirely without foundation." •
Charles Palm, Hoover's deputy"
director, said that although he"
would not speculate on the Uni
versity's motivations for closer
relations with Hoover, "There are
a host of good reasons why rela- - *
tions should be close.
"The most important is that
both institutions have much to
gain from academic interaction
that can exist between our schol
ars and Stanford scholars," he
added.
A 'respectful' relationship
► The players in the Stanford-
Hoover debate disagree on the
future of the relationship.
Manley sees it as a cyclical
fight, currently experiencing a
lull. But he said the lull will be
broken when Hoover embroils the
University in a political cause that
damages its credibility. "At the
moment, we're waiting for the
next outbreak."
Abernethy characterized the
tensions with Hoover as "intrin
sic" because of its history as "a
separate kind of institution, it's
here, but it's not fully here." That
philosophy of separation, which
Hoover has always strived to pro
tect, will prevent the institution
from ever becoming fully assimi
lated into the University, he said.
But Abernethy thinks the
major tensions with Hoover are
over. "I don't think there will be
the equivalent of the Reagan
Library fight in the future," he
said.
Stanford-Hoover relations,
Kennedy said, are "good and
improving."
Krasner said he thinks future
relations between Stanford and
Hoover will be quite positive.
"The relationship in the past was
an aberration."
Said Dorfman, "Over time,
that kind of conflict worked its
way through."
Hill said, "A lot of people have
profited by trying to stir up diffi
culties, but that's all in the past."
"We're all part of the same uni
versity, and we want to have the
assets of the entire University
community operating together in
a respectful way."


Carolina Katz — Dally
Hoover Institution director John Raisian is widely cited as a primary reason for warming relations
between Hoover and the University. His appointment to the University Cabinet, one of the highest deci
sion-making bodies at Stanford, signaled the extent to which Hoover and Stanford are forming new ties.

'John Raisian is a nice
man, but unfortunately he
is dealing with someone
who is very arrogant...
Donald Kennedy.'
— Glenn Campbell

'My relationship with the
president is perfect as it is
now. I would do nothing to
change it.'
— John Raisian

Twenty months ago, the relationship
between Stanford and the Hoover Insti
tution was at a low point. After a decade
of disputes over the institution's proper
role in the University, the notoriously
outspoken W. Glenn Campbell had just
been pressured to step down as Hoover
director by the Board of Trustees.
But today, Stanford and Hoover are
cooperating to an extent unknown in
recent years, a development that has
outraged long-time critics of the rela-

tionship but has been applauded by most
University officials, Hoover scholars and
Stanford faculty.
For years, individuals from Stanford
and Hoover debated Hoover's perceived
conservative agenda and its academic
independence from the University. Stan
ford-Hoover ties weathered a number of
faculty petitions and accusations, includ
ing a fight over Campbell's bid to locate
the Ronald Reagan Library and Policy
Center on campus in 1986-87, as well as
a number of smaller fights over appoint-

ments and oversight at Hoover.
But since Campbell's resigna
tion after a 30-year tenure, such
issues have not been raised and
Stanford-Hoover relations have
quietly improved.
Campbell's successor, John
Raisian, has been cited by Hoover
scholars as the main reason for
improved relations with the Uni
versity.
Hoover, founded as a resource
center in 1919 to house extensive
library and archival materials,
gained independence from the
University in 1959. Following the
wishes of President Herbert
Hoover, the Board of Trustees
declared the center "an indepen
dent institution within the frame
of Stanford University."
That independence is the crux
of the issue for Hoover critics like
Political Science Prof. John Man
ley and English Prof. Ronald Reb
holz, who argue that Hoover's
spending and appointments
should be brought under normal
academic control, or the institu
tion should be totally separated
from the University.
During the 1980s, Manley and
Rebholz sponsored several contro
versial bills in the Faculty Senate
calling for studies of the relation
ship between Hoover and Stan
ford.
But now, "I don't feel any ten
sion [with the University] at all,"
said senior research fellow
Charles Hill. "I attribute that to
John Raisian, who is doing a spec
tacular job."
University President Donald
Kennedy added, "John Raisian
has done a wonderful job, and
Stanford faculty has taken the ini
tiative to work more closely with
Hoover."
Greater involvement with
University policy
As the cold war with Hoover
winds down, the Institution has
played a greater role in University
affairs. Last year Raisian was
given a position in the newly-cre
ated University Cabinet, a body
that sets University policy on
issues including indirect cost
recovery and budget "reposition
ing."
The other members of the cab
inet are the deans of each of the
University's seven schools, along
with the provost, the dean of
research and the director of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter. The Cabinet is chaired by
Kennedy and is the highest level
of policy organization within the
L^niversity.
Provost James Rosse said the
President's Office and the
Provost's Office are the principal
decision-making bodies of the
University, but they operate with
the "consent, guidance and votes"
of the cabinet.
1 loover "is a part of the Univer
sity, so it needs to be a part of the
University's decisions," Rosse
said.
Kennedy added that Hoover's
involvement "is helpful, as is
[Raisian 'sj very constructive and
collegial attitude."
According to Raisian, Hoover
has "never had an involvement
like that in recent decades," in
which the Institution takes part
in"the general business of the
University" rather than just the
issues that relate to Hoover.
However, Manley and Rebholz
object to Hoover's greater involve
ment, maintaining that it is detri
mental to Stanford's reputation.
"The problem," Manley said, "is
that this University is committed
to professional, apolitical activi
ties, and yet it is trying to exist
with a think tank that pushes its
own causes and uses the Univer
sity's good name to do that."
Rebholz said that despite its
new director, Hoover has not
essentially changed its mission,
"which was defined by Herbert
Hoover as fighting socialism and
promoting capitalism."
Campbell vs. Kennedy?
Campbell, who now holds the
position of "counselor for life" at

Hoover, blames Kennedy for
strained Hoover-Stanford rela
tions during the last decade.
"We had excellent relations
with the University in the 19705,"
Campbell said, "and that didn't
cease until Kennedy started mak
ing accusations against me."
Campbell said he thinks
Kennedy instigated faculty criti
cism of Hoover to undermine his
position and force him to resign.
Now, he said, critics like Manley
and Rebholz "are President
Kennedy's problem. He unleashed
them, and now he needs to re
leash them."
The former Hoover director
also does not take their criticism
seriously "I've not met either of
them in my life, and I have no
desire to meet them," he added.
"They're jokes. I wouldn't debate
them under any circumstances."
Kennedy dismissed Campbell's
charge, saying "it will amuse
Manley and Rebholz to learn that
I once had them leashed."
Campbell said there is less ten
sion now between Hoover and
Stanford, but the overall situation
"won't improve until the current
president ceases to be president.
John Raisian is a nice man, but
unfortunately he is dealing with
someone who is very arrogant,
and that man's name is Donald
Kennedy."
A valuable resource
Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy, unlike Manley and
Rebholz, downplays the impor
tance of Hoover's ideology and
focuses instead on its value as a
research facility.
Abernethy, who teaches
African politics, said he relies very
heavily on Hoover's library. A
divorce from Hoover would make
it more difficult to carry out
research, he noted.
He added that he only objects
to Hoover when it attempts to
"significantly increase its policy
goal on campus." For that reason,
he opposed Hoover's attempts to
place the Reagan Library and the
Reagan Policy Center on campus
in 1986.
Abernethy emphasized that his
opposition to the library was not
ideologically motivated. "I'm not
fundamentally unhappy with
[Hoover], but I did become mobi-

lized against it when an effort was
made to expand the responsibili
ties of Hoover locally."
He said the University needs to
be a place where people with many
political positions can debate
them — "it improves the quality
of discussion."
Stephen Krasner, chair of the
Political Science Department for
the past six years, said closer rela
tions with Hoover are "absolutely
a very positive development" and
a benefit for the University as a
whole. The new closeness "is a big
plus for the faculty and the stu
dents," he said.
Critics like Manley and Reb
holz "don't capture the complex
ity of the situation," he said.
Hoover does not have a single
agenda, as the critics assert, he
added.
"It's inaccurate to classify
[Hoover] as a right-wing institu
tion" because it has a diverse
group of scholars who pursue
their own agendas, he said.

In a February 1988 Viewpoint
published in The Daily, Manley
contended that "No university
can tolerate within its midst a
highly autonomous, politically
active think tank, whether that
think tank espouses the view of
Adam Smith or Karl Marx."
But Raisian does not plan to
bring Hoover under normal aca
demic control. "My relationship
with the president is perfect as it
is now. I would do nothing to
change it."
He characterizes the Stanford-
Hoover relationship in plainer
terms than its critics. "Stanford is
about teaching and research,"
Raisian said, while Hoover is
about research that has a public
policy focus. "There is an overlap
of research there. We should
exploit that . . . whenever we can
and develop the interests and
opportunities that we share."
Kennedy agrees. "Hoover
brings wonderful scholars and
valuable archives to this place,"
he said. "As long as Stanford can
work with Hoover, it's good for
everyone, and everyone except
John Manley recognizes that."
But Campbell said the relation
ship is not equally beneficial.
"Stanford needs the Hoover Insti
tution more than Hoover needs
Stanford," he argued. "Particu
larly now, because the University
is in trouble. I know all about
receptions and overhead."
Joint appointments create
tension
One of the main sources of ten
sion between Stanford and
Hoover has been the issue of joint
appointments — professors who
split time between Hoover and the
University, with each institution
paying half of the salary.
Currently, one-fifth of all
Hoover fellows — 11 — hold joint
appointments at Stanford.
In the past, individual depart
ments have clashed with Hoover
over the appointments. In the
most serious case, senior fellow
Bruce Bueno de Mesquita was
denied a joint appointment to the
political science department.
However, Bueno de Mesquita
eventually received a courtesy
appointment, which means he is
permanently assigned to Hoover
but participates in research at

Stanford.
Four other Hoover fellows hold
courtesy appointments.
Kennedy capsulized the Uni
versity's current position. "There
will be more, rather than fewer,
joint appointments, and there will
be more, rather than less, interac
tion with Hoover," he said.

appointments because Hoover
could lose some of its indepen

them, and now he needs to re
leash them."
The former Hoover director
also does not take their criticism
seriously "I've not met either of
them in my life, and I have no
desire to meet them," he added.
"They're jokes. I wouldn't debate
them under any circumstances."
Kennedy dismissed Campbell's
charge, saying "it will amuse
Manley and Rebholz to learn that
I once had them leashed."
Campbell said there is less ten
sion now between Hoover and
Stanford, but the overall situation
"won't improve until the current
president ceases to be president.
John Raisian is a nice man, but
unfortunately he is dealing with
someone who is very arrogant,
and that man's name is Donald
Kennedy."
A valuable resource
Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy, unlike Manley and
Rebholz, downplays the impor
tance of Hoover's ideology and
focuses instead on its value as a
research facility.
Abernethy, who teaches
African politics, said he relies very
heavily on Hoover's library. A
divorce from Hoover would make
it more difficult to carry out
research, he noted.
He added that he only objects
to Hoover when it attempts to
"significantly increase its policy
goal on campus." For that reason,
he opposed Hoover's attempts to
place the Reagan Library and the
Reagan Policy Center on campus
in 1986.
Abernethy emphasized that his
opposition to the library was not
ideologically motivated. "I'm not
fundamentally unhappy with
[Hoover], but I did become mobi-

lized against it when an effort was
made to expand the responsibili
ties of Hoover locally."
He said the University needs to
be a place where people with many
political positions can debate
them — "it improves the quality
of discussion."
Stephen Krasner, chair of the
Political Science Department for
the past six years, said closer rela
tions with Hoover are "absolutely
a very positive development" and
a benefit for the University as a
whole. The new closeness "is a big
plus for the faculty and the stu
dents," he said.
Critics like Manley and Reb
holz "don't capture the complex
ity of the situation," he said.
Hoover does not have a single
agenda, as the critics assert, he
added.
"It's inaccurate to classify
[Hoover] as a right-wing institu
tion" because it has a diverse
group of scholars who pursue
their own agendas, he said.

In a February 1988 Viewpoint
published in The Daily, Manley
contended that "No university
can tolerate within its midst a
highly autonomous, politically
active think tank, whether that
think tank espouses the view of
Adam Smith or Karl Marx."
But Raisian does not plan to
bring Hoover under normal aca
demic control. "My relationship
with the president is perfect as it
is now. I would do nothing to
change it."
He characterizes the Stanford-
Hoover relationship in plainer
terms than its critics. "Stanford is
about teaching and research,"
Raisian said, while Hoover is
about research that has a public
policy focus. "There is an overlap
of research there. We should
exploit that . . . whenever we can
and develop the interests and
opportunities that we share."
Kennedy agrees. "Hoover
brings wonderful scholars and
valuable archives to this place,"
he said. "As long as Stanford can
work with Hoover, it's good for
everyone, and everyone except
John Manley recognizes that."
But Campbell said the relation
ship is not equally beneficial.
"Stanford needs the Hoover Insti
tution more than Hoover needs
Stanford," he argued. "Particu
larly now, because the University
is in trouble. I know all about
receptions and overhead."
Joint appointments create
tension
One of the main sources of ten
sion between Stanford and
Hoover has been the issue of joint
appointments — professors who
split time between Hoover and the
University, with each institution
paying half of the salary.
Currently, one-fifth of all
Hoover fellows — 11 — hold joint
appointments at Stanford.
In the past, individual depart
ments have clashed with Hoover
over the appointments. In the
most serious case, senior fellow
Bruce Bueno de Mesquita was
denied a joint appointment to the
political science department.
However, Bueno de Mesquita
eventually received a courtesy
appointment, which means he is
permanently assigned to Hoover
but participates in research at

Stanford.
Four other Hoover fellows hold
courtesy appointments.
Kennedy capsulized the Uni
versity's current position. "There
will be more, rather than fewer,
joint appointments, and there will
be more, rather than less, interac
tion with Hoover," he said.
However, Raisian said he is
wary of having too many joint
appointments because Hoover
could lose some of its indepen
dence from Stanford.
"I would never want to move
toward a position of having only
joint appointments," he said. "1
don't see the mission of the
Hoover Institution as being a col
lection of joint appointments."
Instead, Raisian emphasized
the importance of courtesy
appointments as a way of improv
ing relations with the University.
Manley said that although he does
not dispute the individual quality
of many of the scholars who hold
the appointments, he is dismayed

at the "way Hoover uses [the
appointments |."
He added that joint appoint
ments are detrimental to the Uni
versity because Hoover uses them
to "buff its image and increase its
legitimacy" at the expense of
Stanford's reputation.
But senior fellow Gerald Dorf
man, who holds a joint appoint
ment with the department of con
tinuing studies, said his two posi
tions make him "more a part of
the University."
When Raisian took over, Dorf
man added, "Hoover people and
University people began to work
together for the first time."
Dorfman noted that there has
been "a soothing going on here,"
and Raisian has been "an impor
tant figure" in easing the tension.
He is "just the right kind of per
son to fill the job. He's a friendly,

decent, very even-tempered guy."
Hoover's smoother style
For Hoover critics, that is
exactly the problem. They argue
that Hoover's conservative
agenda has not changed, but its
style — its ability to "package" its
research differently, which
Raisian said is one of his goals —
has changed.
"If anything, having a
smoother director like Raisian is
bad for us," Manley said. "Hoover
will still be Hoover, no matter how
'nice' its director is."
Rebholz agreed. "The status
quo under Raisian is pretty much
the status quo under Campbell,"
he said.
"In some ways," Manley said,
"I was sorry to see Glenn Camp
bell go. He was so candid about
Hoover's goals that it gave us
ammunition against it." Now, he
said, its reports will be "sanitized"
to present a better picture.

"When we get the annual
reports it's doubtful we'll find out
anything at all," Rebholz said.
"We won't find out exactly what
they're up to because we won't
have Campbell as our source of
truth."
Financing called an issue
Manley and Rebholz also criti
cize the financial relationship
between Stanford and Hoover.
They said the closer relations are
designed to satisfy the large com
panies and foundations that con
tribute to both Stanford and
Hoover.
Rebholz said money "is the real
reason for rejecting separation."
In an letter to The Daily two
years ago, Manley wrote: "Neither
Kennedy nor the Board of
Trustees has the guts [to consider
separating from Hoover] for one
reason — the big donations from
companies like Hewlett-Packard
to both Stanford and Hoover.
They are frightened-from eVienat
ing that money from Stanford."
Hoover has a $125 million
endowment and an annual budget
of $18 million, Raisian said. Of its
total annual budget, $4 million
comes from the University for the
maintenance of Hoover's library
and archives; the remaining $14
million comes from private
sources and income from the
endowment.
Several major individuals and
foundations donate to both Stan
ford and Hoover. In his 1989
annual report, Campbell thanked
Hoover's "long-time, loyal con
tributors," including the John M.
Olin Foundation and the Pew
Memorial Trust.
The two are contributors
to both Stanford and Hoover, said
Elizabeth Sloan, director of com
munications in the Office of
Development.
Campbell also noted in his
report that funds to build the Lou
Henry Hoover Building at the
Institution in 1964 came from
contributors that included long
time Stanford donor David
F^cick&rd
In May 1986, Packard donated
$70 million to fund the Univer
sity's new Children's Hospital,
according to Richard Bennett,
associate campaign director in the
Office of Development. It was the
largest gift from a private donor
in Stanford history.
John Ford, vice president for
development, denied that the
fund-raising overlaps have an
impact on the University's policy.
"The Office of Development is a
service organization," he said.
"We are here to raise money for
the Universitv and its affiliates,

and there are good programmatic
reasons to do that. To the degree
that Hoover is an academic orga
nization, we are here to help thenv
raise money."
Kennedy also dismissed Man-*
ley's accusation that a fear of los-;
ing donations helps determine
University policy toward Hoover,t
saying such a suggestion is;
"entirely without foundation." •
Charles Palm, Hoover's deputy"
director, said that although he"
would not speculate on the Uni
versity's motivations for closer
relations with Hoover, "There are
a host of good reasons why rela- - *
tions should be close.
"The most important is that
both institutions have much to
gain from academic interaction
that can exist between our schol
ars and Stanford scholars," he
added.
A 'respectful' relationship
► The players in the Stanford-
Hoover debate disagree on the
future of the relationship.
Manley sees it as a cyclical
fight, currently experiencing a
lull. But he said the lull will be
broken when Hoover embroils the
University in a political cause that
damages its credibility. "At the
moment, we're waiting for the
next outbreak."
Abernethy characterized the
tensions with Hoover as "intrin
sic" because of its history as "a
separate kind of institution, it's
here, but it's not fully here." That
philosophy of separation, which
Hoover has always strived to pro
tect, will prevent the institution
from ever becoming fully assimi
lated into the University, he said.
But Abernethy thinks the
major tensions with Hoover are
over. "I don't think there will be
the equivalent of the Reagan
Library fight in the future," he
said.
Stanford-Hoover relations,
Kennedy said, are "good and
improving."
Krasner said he thinks future
relations between Stanford and
Hoover will be quite positive.
"The relationship in the past was
an aberration."
Said Dorfman, "Over time,
that kind of conflict worked its
way through."
Hill said, "A lot of people have
profited by trying to stir up diffi
culties, but that's all in the past."
"We're all part of the same uni
versity, and we want to have the
assets of the entire University
community operating together in
a respectful way."


Carolina Katz — Dally
Hoover Institution director John Raisian is widely cited as a primary reason for warming relations
between Hoover and the University. His appointment to the University Cabinet, one of the highest deci
sion-making bodies at Stanford, signaled the extent to which Hoover and Stanford are forming new ties.

'John Raisian is a nice
man, but unfortunately he
is dealing with someone
who is very arrogant...
Donald Kennedy.'
— Glenn Campbell

'My relationship with the
president is perfect as it is
now. I would do nothing to
change it.'
— John Raisian

Twenty months ago, the relationship
between Stanford and the Hoover Insti
tution was at a low point. After a decade
of disputes over the institution's proper
role in the University, the notoriously
outspoken W. Glenn Campbell had just
been pressured to step down as Hoover
director by the Board of Trustees.
But today, Stanford and Hoover are
cooperating to an extent unknown in
recent years, a development that has
outraged long-time critics of the rela-

tionship but has been applauded by most
University officials, Hoover scholars and
Stanford faculty.
For years, individuals from Stanford
and Hoover debated Hoover's perceived
conservative agenda and its academic
independence from the University. Stan
ford-Hoover ties weathered a number of
faculty petitions and accusations, includ
ing a fight over Campbell's bid to locate
the Ronald Reagan Library and Policy
Center on campus in 1986-87, as well as
a number of smaller fights over appoint-

ments and oversight at Hoover.
But since Campbell's resigna
tion after a 30-year tenure, such
issues have not been raised and
Stanford-Hoover relations have
quietly improved.
Campbell's successor, John
Raisian, has been cited by Hoover
scholars as the main reason for
improved relations with the Uni
versity.
Hoover, founded as a resource
center in 1919 to house extensive
library and archival materials,
gained independence from the
University in 1959. Following the
wishes of President Herbert
Hoover, the Board of Trustees
declared the center "an indepen
dent institution within the frame
of Stanford University."
That independence is the crux
of the issue for Hoover critics like
Political Science Prof. John Man
ley and English Prof. Ronald Reb
holz, who argue that Hoover's
spending and appointments
should be brought under normal
academic control, or the institu
tion should be totally separated
from the University.
During the 1980s, Manley and
Rebholz sponsored several contro
versial bills in the Faculty Senate
calling for studies of the relation
ship between Hoover and Stan
ford.
But now, "I don't feel any ten
sion [with the University] at all,"
said senior research fellow
Charles Hill. "I attribute that to
John Raisian, who is doing a spec
tacular job."
University President Donald
Kennedy added, "John Raisian
has done a wonderful job, and
Stanford faculty has taken the ini
tiative to work more closely with
Hoover."
Greater involvement with
University policy
As the cold war with Hoover
winds down, the Institution has
played a greater role in University
affairs. Last year Raisian was
given a position in the newly-cre
ated University Cabinet, a body
that sets University policy on
issues including indirect cost
recovery and budget "reposition
ing."
The other members of the cab
inet are the deans of each of the
University's seven schools, along
with the provost, the dean of
research and the director of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter. The Cabinet is chaired by
Kennedy and is the highest level
of policy organization within the
L^niversity.
Provost James Rosse said the
President's Office and the
Provost's Office are the principal
decision-making bodies of the
University, but they operate with
the "consent, guidance and votes"
of the cabinet.
1 loover "is a part of the Univer
sity, so it needs to be a part of the
University's decisions," Rosse
said.
Kennedy added that Hoover's
involvement "is helpful, as is
[Raisian 'sj very constructive and
collegial attitude."
According to Raisian, Hoover
has "never had an involvement
like that in recent decades," in
which the Institution takes part
in"the general business of the
University" rather than just the
issues that relate to Hoover.
However, Manley and Rebholz
object to Hoover's greater involve
ment, maintaining that it is detri
mental to Stanford's reputation.
"The problem," Manley said, "is
that this University is committed
to professional, apolitical activi
ties, and yet it is trying to exist
with a think tank that pushes its
own causes and uses the Univer
sity's good name to do that."
Rebholz said that despite its
new director, Hoover has not
essentially changed its mission,
"which was defined by Herbert
Hoover as fighting socialism and
promoting capitalism."
Campbell vs. Kennedy?
Campbell, who now holds the
position of "counselor for life" at

Hoover, blames Kennedy for
strained Hoover-Stanford rela
tions during the last decade.
"We had excellent relations
with the University in the 19705,"
Campbell said, "and that didn't
cease until Kennedy started mak
ing accusations against me."
Campbell said he thinks
Kennedy instigated faculty criti
cism of Hoover to undermine his
position and force him to resign.
Now, he said, critics like Manley
and Rebholz "are President
Kennedy's problem. He unleashed
them, and now he needs to re
leash them."
The former Hoover director
also does not take their criticism
seriously "I've not met either of
them in my life, and I have no
desire to meet them," he added.
"They're jokes. I wouldn't debate
them under any circumstances."
Kennedy dismissed Campbell's
charge, saying "it will amuse
Manley and Rebholz to learn that
I once had them leashed."
Campbell said there is less ten
sion now between Hoover and
Stanford, but the overall situation
"won't improve until the current
president ceases to be president.
John Raisian is a nice man, but
unfortunately he is dealing with
someone who is very arrogant,
and that man's name is Donald
Kennedy."
