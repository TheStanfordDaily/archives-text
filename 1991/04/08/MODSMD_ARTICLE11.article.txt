Jackson leads anti-Gates march
LOS ANGELES (AP) - The Rev. Jesse
Jackson led a march on downtown Police Head
quarters Saturday to protest the City Council's
decision to overrule the Police Commission and
reinstate embattled Chief Daryl Gates.
"Through the years he has shown no
remorse, just racially insensitive remarks . . .
It's not just Gates, it's Gatism," Jackson said,
adding that the beating was equivalent to
events that led to blacks' fight for civil rights.
To chants of "Daryl Gates Must Go!" some
2,000 people condemned a council vote to rein
state Gates.
The Police Commission suspended the chief
last Thursday for 60 days with pay. But on Fri
day, the City Council struck the deal to rein
state Gates, possibly as soon as today.
The move set up a political battle pitting the
commission, whose action was backed by
Mayor Tom Bradley, against the council, whose
action was overwhelmingly supported by the
rank and file of the 8,300-member police
department.
Kohl returns to East Germany
ERFURT, Germany (AP) â€” Thousands
cheered but some threw eggs at Chancellor
Helmut Kohl yesterday on his much-antici
pated first visit to beleaguered eastern Ger
many since his election to lead the united
nation.
When Kohl arrived at this southern city's
cathedral with his wife, Hannelore, hundreds
of people applauded and chanted "Helmut, Hel
mut." Thousands then cheered them on a 50-
minute walk across the city.
But during the same walk en route to meet
local officials, a half a dozen eggs flew from a
jeering crowd. Kohl did not appear to be hit.
The crowds greeting him were only a frac
tion of the masses that once gathered in east
ern Germany for his visits.
Astronauts take space walk
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) - Shuttle
astronauts Jerry Ross and Jay Apt took a walk
outside, shook a balky antenna and freed it yes
terday. The emergency repair made it possible
to release a $617 million scientific observatory
into orbit.
The release of the antenna was needed to
release the observatory, the main focus of the
five-day mission. Its locking pin had fully
retracted and the antenna boom needed only a
little shake to work it loose.
