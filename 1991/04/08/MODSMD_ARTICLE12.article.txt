NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) - U.S.
military planes began airdropping
supplies to Kurdish refugees yes
terday in northern Iraq, and Sad
dam Hussein's troops were said to
have launched a new offensive
against the Kurdish rebels.
White House spokesman Mar
lin Fitzwater, in Houston with
President Bush, said the planes
had dropped 72,000 pounds of
supplies, and that the airdrops
would continue for about 10 days.
Britain, Japan, France,
Switzerland and a host of other
nations have joined the effort to
help the refugees.
The refugees, facing starvation
and exposure in the snow-covered
mountains where they fled to
escape Saddam's army, were
growing more desperate.
The Kurdish rebels are badly
outgunned by Iraqi troops, who
pushed deeper into rebel-held ter
ritory, attacking the northern city
of Salahedin, rebel leaders said
yesterday.
Iran made a rare appeal for
international help yesterday, say
ing it had been overwhelmed by
the influx of refugees. It said it
had taken in nearly 700,000

Iraqis, mostly from the northern
Kurdish provinces.
Turkey's government-spon
sored Anatolia news agency
reported that Turkish soldiers
opened fire yesterday on a group
of refugees who forced their way
across the border in search of
food, wounding one of them. The
report could not be independently
confirmed.
The United States warned Iraq
not to interfere with the refugee
relief effort, which the Baghdad
government ridiculed yesterday.
At the same time, President
Bush repeated the U.S. intention
to stay out of Iraq's civil war.
"I will reassert I never in any
way implied that the United
States was going to use force
beyond the mandate of the United
Nations," Bush said in Houston.
Bush expressed hopes that
international pressure would per
suade Saddam to halt attacks on
his own people. Although he had
urged the Iraqi people to over
throw Saddam, the president
insisted he had not misled the
rebels into believing the U.S.
would take their side.
