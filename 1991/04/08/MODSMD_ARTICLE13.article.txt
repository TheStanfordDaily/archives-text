### 
KUWAIT CITY (AP) - The emir of
Kuwait, in his first public address
since the allies ousted Iraqi occupation
forces, pledged yesterday to restore
parliamentary democracy and hold
elections by the end of 1992.
Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, in
a nationally broadcast speech, said
Kuwait remained in danger from a
possible "mad act" by Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein. Without mentioning
any country by name, the emir asked
Kuwait's "brothers and friends" to
keep their forces in the emirate.
The emir's announcement came
hours after the main Islamic funda
mentalist group, the Islamic Constitu

tional Movement, demanded elections
within six months and restoration of
the constitution and parliament. Lead
ers in some Western nations, including
the United States and Britain, had also
urged the ruling family to allow
greater democracy.
In the 10-minute speech yesterday,
the emir also said he would study the
possibility of extending political rights
to women, who now have no vote. He
said the emirate's strict voting eligibil
ity regulations would be eased to allow
more people to cast ballots.
The drive for political reform gained
momentum after allied troops ousted
Iraqi soldiers from Kuwait in late

February, ending a nearly seven
month occupation.
The emir addressed many of the
demands put forth by the Kuwaiti
Democratic Forum, which seeks
restoration of the suspended constitu
tion and appointment of an overhauled
Cabinet.
The fundamentalist Islamic Consti
tutional Movement has demanded a
new Cabinet "based on competence,
honesty in performance and popular
ity." Traditionally, many of the top
level Cabinet post were given to mem
bers of the al-Sabah ruling family.
A spokesman for the Democratic
Forum, Issa al-Sarras, said reaction to

the emir's speech within the opposi
tion coalition movement was mixed.
"Some are optimistic," he said.
"They see this as an opening for the
start of political wrangling. And they
were pleased that he promised to study
political rights for women."
"The pessimists say that since he
has not given a clear date for an elec
tion, he may try to go back on it. He
may be trying to take the heat off his
back from the allied governments," al-
Sarras said.
The emir's speech marked the start
of the final 10 days of the Muslim holy
month of Ramadan.
