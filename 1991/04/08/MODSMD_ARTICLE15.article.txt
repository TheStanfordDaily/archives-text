## Don't intervene 
### 
Iraq's civil war is not
a welcome locus for
U.S. military policy

Although the bush
Administration has come
under criticism for its policy
of non-intervention in the Iraqi
civil war, it is correct in keeping
American troops out of the con
flict.
The argument for giving
military aid to the rebels is popular.
Undermining and even toppling
Saddam Hussein's regime has been
an overt objective of the Bush
administration and is supported by
the American people. Now that
rebel groups appear to be making
headway, it seems inconsistent for
the hundreds of thousands of U.S.
troops now stationed in or near
Iraq to sit idly by and watch Sad
dam brutally crush another upris
ing.
According to the letter that
President Bush wrote to college
students last January, the United
States had a "moral imperative" to
defend the Kuwaitis when they
were attacked by Saddam. At one
level it seems hypocritical to ignore
this moral imperative when it
applies to the Kurdish people.
But the administration is wise to
resist the temptation to intervene.
Since the civil war is occurring
within the established borders of
Iraq, the United States has no
mandate from the international
community as it did in the case of
Kuwait. The Soviet Union, China
and — most importantly — many
of our Arab allies all oppose U.S.
involvement in an Iraqi internal
dispute.
Even if the United States were
to act unilaterally, military action
would create more problems than
it would solve. The Iraqi people will

not accept a government which is
so obviously backed by a belliger
ent superpower. When the rebel
coalition breaks down, the United
States would be in the awkward
position of taking sides between
the Kurds and the Shiites. The
United States could not credibly
reassure other Arab nations that it
has no intention of interfering in
their internal disputes.
Although almost everyone
wants to see Saddam fall, this
should not be accomplished
through a disintegration of the
Iraqi state into warring religious
factions. It would create a power
vacuum that would invite inter
vention by Iran and Syria and
insure violence in the region for
years to come.
Through good fortune, muscle
and diplomatic skill, the United
States has so far been able to
accomplish its military objectives
in the Middle East with a mini
mum of international political fric
tion. Involvement in an internal
ethnic and religious dispute could
not be accomplished with such
diplomatic success.
However, one adversity related
to the Iraqi war requires immedi
ate United States action: the Kur
dish refugee problem.
The United States has begun
airlifting emergency food and blan
kets to many of the fleeing Kurds,
and has also pledged $10 million
for refugee relief, but the help is
slow in coming and falls far short
of what is needed. The United
Nations Disaster Relief Office esti
mates that it will need $137 million
just to meet the immediate food
and shelter needs of the estimated
700,000 refugees.
The Turkish government has
promised to admit more Kurds into
its country if it is given substantial
financial aid. The United States
should supply such aid immedi
ately.
