## ASSU has babbled about politics, failed to serve students 
### 
WE SUPPORT THE STUDENTS
who fought for their strongly
held convictions in Sacramento
on Wednesday. However, we are very con
cerned that Goodwin Liu, in his April 2
letter supporting the rally, blurs their
cause with that of the Council of Presi
dents and the ASSU as a whole.
Liu sees little difference between
tutoring East Palo Alto schoolchildren
and the COP's fighting for a state and
national agenda. There is a clear differ
ence.
Everyone supports the efforts of vol
unteer service groups that provide edu
cation and inspiration to underprivileged
children. On the other hand, many peo
ple believe the ASSU misuses its
resources when it fights for a broad, divi
sive, off-campus agenda. By failing to
recognize this sentiment, Liu implies
that his views are undeniably self-evi
dent, and that other views are unworthy
of consideration or representation by our
student government.
This one-sided approach to controver
sial, external issues has alienated large

segments of the campus community and
discourages many students from regard
ing the ASSU as a resource available to
them. The ASSU's role in such issues
should be informational and educational,
supporting groups and individuals with a
diversity of views, many of which may be
conflicting.
All too often our student leaders claim
to think for the entire student body.
Undoubtedly, Liu has thought out his
support of these educational initiatives
and the difficult social and economic
trade-offs they imply. In his letter, how
ever, Liu neither explains nor defends his
view of the situation in the California
schools, expecting everyone to adopt his
strong position without hesitation. We
sincerely believe the COP would better
serve the campus by explaining the
issues and describing how students can
get involved, rather than taking a parti
san stand.
It is ironic that Liu frames his letter
in terms of the image problem of the
University, while the ASSU itself has a
tremendous image problem, stemming

largely from its failure to serve student
needs. Before the ASSU spends its
energy taking sides on outside issues, it
should work on problems at Stanford.
We must get our own house in order.
• This year's COP has not seriously
examined ASSU finances. If it had, it
would have seen a riderless horse charg
ing up a hill into the fog with students'
money. Rather than using its money pro
ductively to serve students, the "non
profit" ASSU has had its assets soar over
500 percent to well more than $1 million
in the past seven years. In addition, an
extra $81,000 has steadily accumulated
as "rounding errors" from sloppy and
generous bookkeeping.
• This year's COP has not talked with
University Food Service about next fall's
major conversion to a point system
which currently charges $1.95 for a large
lemonade.
• This year's ASSU has disregarded
public opinion on a myriad of issues,
including elections, the alcohol policy,
legislative reforms and distribution
requirements.

• This year's ASSU has never looked
at the tens of thousands of forms col
lected for the mythical Course Guide.
• Any student group wanting ASSU
funding for a program on May 1 will be
denied it because the deadline passed
more than two months ago.
The ASSU has tried to succeed in
Sacramento and Washington, D.C. and
has simply failed at Stanford. It is time
for a change. Students have the right to
expect responsible, accountable govern
ment which supports them and the
groups they form, guarantees a student
voice on campus, presents unbiased
information about important issues and
is inclusive of all cultures, both genders,
graduates, undergraduates and all politi
cal views. Until the students have this, it
is folly for the ASSU to reach for a
broader agenda.
