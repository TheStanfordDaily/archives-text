# ASSU doesn't sap up students' money to finance operations
## 
### 
IN HIS LETTER TO THE DAILY,
Chris Adamson argued that the close
to $175,000 that the ASSU receives
from the Office of Student Affairs should
be made refundable, since this money
originally comes from the student body.
However, he did not provide a complete
and accurate picture of the function and
purpose of this University contribution.
Contrary to Adamson's implication
that this money goes into the coffers of
the ASSU, the money in no way funds

the ASSU's operating expenses or pro
grams.
Student Affairs uses this $175,000 to
contract out the financial oversight of
student organizations to the ASSU. It
does this for several reasons.
First, the financial activities of stu
dent organizations must be monitored to
protect Stanford's non-profit status. Sec
ond, because the ASSU administers the
special fee system that funds several stu
dent organizations, it is efficient for the
ASSU to provide concomitant banking
services. Third, it would cost a lot more
than $175,000 if the University were to
attempt to provide a similar level of ser
vice through its central accounting
department.
