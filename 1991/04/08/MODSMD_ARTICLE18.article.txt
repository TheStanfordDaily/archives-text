expenses incurred by the ASSU banking
service. These expenses include: the
salaries of the professional and student
staff of the ASSU Business Office (these
are appointed positions, not elected posi
tions), which is the clearinghouse of all
student-group financial activity; com
puter and equipment expenses; and
internal business office overhead
expenses like phone usage and supplies.
Thus, the Student Affairs money goes

almost entirely to allowing student orga
nizations to function financially.
Adamson is correct that ASSU fees do
not fund the internal operating budget of
the ASSU
ASSU-specific funding, including the
salaries of elected officials, is provided by
students voluntarily in the form of their
patronage of ASSU business projects:
Sunday Flicks, Lecture Notes/Copy Ser
vice, Ad Agency, Shirt Shak, Beat the
Bookstore, Airport Shuttle, Linen Ser
vice and Type & Design.
Contrary to popular belief, the ASSU
does not, nor does it have the power to,
sap students' financial resources without
their control.
