# Switching roles
## Undergrad TAs face special challenges 
### Paul Yee 
In between writing their own term
papers and completing required readings,
some Stanford undergraduates have to pre
pare lectures, grade papers and hold weekly
office hours.
Sophomore Steve Friedland was only a
freshman when he became a section leader
for Computer Science 106 A. After complet
ing Computer Sciencelo6X in his first
quarter at Stanford, he joined the computer
science department the next quarter.
Former computer science section leader

coordinator Gretchen Purcell, who inter
viewed Friedland for the job, said he pos
sessed all the qualities of a good section
leader and was also "enthusiastic and ener
getic."
"We hire a lot of people who are young,"
she said. Possessing maturity, a sense of
responsibility and knowledge of some com
ponents of teaching is more important than
age, she added.
Friedland said one of his initial fears was
how the class would receive him. He
attributed his apprehension, how
ever, to inexperience rather than
age. In the end, only a few stu
dents found out he was a fresh
man, and he said he "never felt a
lack of respect."
Purcell said Friedland received
one of the highest student evalua
tions the following quarter when
he led a section in Computer Sci
ence 1068.
Senior Lisa Krim took Sociol
ogy 5 as a freshman. After per
forming well in the class, her
teaching assistant asked her to be
a teaching assistant for the fol
lowing year.
During her sophomore year
and also last quarter, Krim ran
weekly sections, in which she
introduced concepts, prepared
labs and led discussions. She also
had to grade five sets of 10 to 20
papers per quarter.
Calling the workload "incredi
ble," she said the hardest part was
separating "time as a TA and time
for yourself."
Senior Karen Anderson, who
became a section leader for Com
puter Science 106 A as a sopho
more, said, "Teaching isn't easy.
For me, it was hard the first time
to figure out how to explain some
thing to someone who doesn't
know it."

Undergraduate TAs can be
quite beneficial, Krim said.
"Graduate students certainly
have an incredible breadth of
knowledge, but they haven't
taken this exact class before.
We've done the assignments and
we knew what [the course] was
like."
Senior Chris Jones, computer
science section leader coordinator
last quarter, said undergraduate
section leaders also "tend to be
more accessible to students."
In addition, because under
graduate section leaders receive
lower salaries than graduate TAs,
the department can afford to hire
more students and thereby limit
the sections to a small group of
eight to 10 students, he added.
To ease the transition from
being a student to a section leader,
Jones instructed a class for first
time section leaders. For the most
part "you learn as you go" in
becoming a teacher, he said, but
the class teaches some fundamen
tals about teaching and dealing
with students.
Professor Joseph Berger, who
has hired undergraduate TAs for
his Sociology 5 course for more
than ten years, said one of his
goals in doing so is to get students

to go to the staff for help.
"I find they are willing to work
with the undergraduate TAs,"
Berger said. He estimates two
thirds of his class have gone to
TAs for help in course work.
Some undergraduate students
actually take on the role of lec
turer.
Senior Debbie Lindes, along
with eight other undergraduate
and medical students, taught an
Innovative Academic Course last
quarter called All About Health:
Issues Facing the Stanford Stu
dent.
A professor had brought up the
idea for the course with some of
her students, one of whom was a
friend of Lindes. The idea devel
oped during the summer into the
class that Lindes and other stu
dents taught.
"We talked about the need for
students to understand some
thing about the biological basis
for health problems and healthi
ness." The course involved lec
tures on topics such as stress,
nutrition, exercise, drugs, eating
disorders, smoking, sexual health,
sleep and alcohol.
Lindes, who is a biology major,
gave two lectures on alcohol, one
on its physiological effects on the

body, the other on alcoholism.
It was very difficult "to coordinate
this huge amount of information
that I had gathered into a coher
ent lecture," she said, but added
that the preparation was manage
able and fun.
"It gave me a lot more appreci
ation for professors who lecture
every day," she said.
Lindes contrasted giving a lec
ture as an instructor with giving
an in-class speech as a student. "I
wasn't worried that I would get a
bad grade if I didn't do well. I was
worried that [the students]
wouldn't learn anything if I didn't
do well."
As a sophomore TA, Krim said
she learned "a lot about interac
tion with people, a lot about com
munication skills, a lot about how
to teach."
Working as a liaison for Berger,
she was also able to provide input
as an undergraduate to help
improve the course.
Undergraduate TAs and sec
tion leaders are paid in a variety of
ways. Computer science section
leaders receive $10 per hour and
Human Biology 1 TAs earn $1400
per quarter. Rather than receiving
a salary, Sociology 5 TAs get 5
units for their work.
