## Greeks get a bad rap 
### 
SPRING HAS SPRUNG, AND THE
Rush is on — fraternity and sorority
Rush, that is.
With Rush events taking place during
the next three weeks, hundreds of Stan
ford students will make hundreds of deci
sions that will have a tremendous impact
on their individual college experiences:
Should I rush? Which organizations
should I rush? Do I want to join a housed
or unhoused fraternity? Am I really seri
ous about this? Why am I rushing? What
do I like about the different groups?
Which group's bid do I accept?
A large block of Stanford students will
make their decision process fairly uncom
plicated by answering "no" to the first
question. Their decisions may be based on
a good understanding of what fraternity
and sorority life is like, but most likely
the decisions will be based on misinfor
mation, valid or invalid stereotypes and a
view of fraternities and sororitie6' as eli
tist drinking clubs that hold their own eli
tist social functions climaxing in a quar
terly formal in the City.
As a freshman, I held many of the
same stereotypes that the politically cor
rect doctrine promotes at Stanford. Then,
at the urging of a few friends my sopho
more year, I went to a few Rush parties
and ended up joining a fraternity — much
to my surprise. Throughout the rushing
and pledging periods, I maintained
doubts about why I wanted to be in a fra
ternity, but it has turned out to be the
best experience of my college career — an
association I will value for life.
Many of the criticisms made about

Greek life are valid, but the "Animal
House" image only simplifies and distorts
the real fraternal experience. Just like
eggs, fraternities have gotten a bad rap.
Sure, some students do join fraterni
ties or sororities to live the life of Bluto,
Weasel and Flounder. But fraternities
filled with troublemakers generally don't
last; they are either kicked off campus or
lose their national charter.
The rest of the fraternities and sorori
ties are organized upon various principles
that go beyond the scope of holding
weekly social activities. Whether the pur
pose is to promote brotherhood or sister
hood, provide a collective avenue for pub
lic service or develop leadership skills, the
founders of each organization intend
their association to fulfill certain basic
principles. Some fraternal groups do bet
ter than others in living up to them, but
all have these ideals and most try their
best to fulfill thera.i.v'ni w m ~ »d,
Because of some highly publicized inci
dents, many students believe the only
achievements of fraternities on this cam
pus and elsewhere are the promotion of
alcoholism, sexism, racism and date rape.
The criticisms cannot and should not be
denied, but they are clearly not inherent
in fraternities — nor are they limited to
Greek organizations. The problems
involve and affect all college students,
regardless of where they live. Unfortu
nately, newsworthiness increases when a
fraternal group is involved rather than a
non-Greek individual.
The same fraternal groups that receive
most of the blame are also the ones doing

the most to face the problems and rectify
them. Each organization must participate
annually in several workshops that
address the issues, and several programs
have been initiated from within the Greek
system. Furthermore, Greek organiza
tions have led the way in developing
appropriate security measures for
responsible social functions.
Nationwide, members of Greek organi
zations stand out with tremendous colle
giate and post-collegiate records of
achievement that overshadow those of
their non-Greek counterparts. At Stan
ford, fraternities and sororities are com
posed of, Phi Beta Kappa members, public
service coordinators, Daily editors, stu
dent government leaders, star athletes,
resident and advising assistants, success
ful entrepreneurs and leaders of many
campus organizations.
Individually and collectively, Stan
ford's fraternity and sorority members
stand out on their merits. Take the time
to get to know them this spring and to let
the blinders be removed.

Tim Marklein is a senior in political sci
ence who almost forgot to mention that
fraternities and sororities also bring Zulu
Spear to campus. 'Nuff said.
