## Conquering Troy Card nine sweeps second-ranked USC at Sunken Diamond, makes major move in Six-Pac race 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
Revenge is so sweet.
The last time the Cardinal met
USC, the host Trojans swept the
three-game series, stripping Stan
ford of its No. 1 ranking. This Fri
day it was the Trojans turn to
come into town with the high
ranking, No. 2 in the nation, and
it was their turn to lose.

Cardinal sweeps three

game series from Trojans

Sunken Diamond was the site
of some classic payback as the No.
6 Cardinal swept the men of Troy
to raise their Pacific 10 Confer
ence Southern Division record to
7-3, 23-9 overall. USC dropped to
14-4 in Six-Pac play, 30-11 overall.
"We wanted revenge for our
sweep down there," said second
basemen Roger Burnett. "We
knew we had performed badly
down there, and we wanted to
show them we could play."
And play they did. USC came
into town with the league's best
pitching staff but still got rocked
for 23 runs on 30 hits. Stanford
pitchers gave up 28 hits, but the
Trojans could only squeeze out
eight runs over the entire week
end.
The result is that USC's first
place league lead over No. 2 Stan
ford has shrunk from six games to
three, and the race is on.
"Obviously the worst thing has
happened," said USC coach Mike
Gillespie. "(League play) has
taken a dramatic reversal in a
heartbeat. It is going to be a dog
fight; it's real difficult to predict."
It would have been a lot easier
to figure out had the Cardinal
dropped even one game, but the
sweep was just what the doctor
ordered.
"With USC coming in here 14-1
(in league play), we knew the only
chance we had was a sweep this
weekend," said Burnett. "Now we
are right back in the running and
we're going to expect to win the

conference."
The shortstop's play this week
end is one of the reasons such
high hopes can be entertained.
Burnett hit two home runs over
the weekend, driving in five runs.
His first came in the second game
to help pad what would eventually
turn into a 10-2 Cardinal run
away, but the junior's second long
ball yesterday sparked a four-run
fourth inning that carried Stan
ford to a 7-3 victory.
The inning started with a Jef
frey Hammonds leadoff walk,
which the sophomore quickly
made the best of by stealing sec
ond. After a Ryan Turner sacrifice
and a Steve Solomon single, the
Cardinal had men on the corners
with one out and Burnett up. The
junior calmly stroked his fifth
homer of the year to put the Car
dinal on top 3-1, and then the
flood gates opened on Trojan
starter Kent Donnelly.
The freshman had beaten the

Cardinal in game three of the last
series, but after consecutive dou
bles by Chris Kemper and Troy
Tallman made the score 4-1, Gille
spie went to the bullpen. Reliever
Eric Hughes came in to one-hit
the Cardinal until the eighth
inning, which was plenty of time
to allow the Trojans to keep
things exciting.
The Cardinal found itself in a
jam in the seventh inning when
an error by third baseman David
Holbrook turned a would be dou
ble play into men on the corners.
A Mark Robertson double turned
that into a USC run.
Robertson's double left reliever
Aaron Dorlarque with men on
first and second with one out,
prompting Stanford coach Mark
Marquess to go to closer Scott
Weiss. Weiss struck out Lionel
Hastings, but then let a curve ball
get away against Dusty Raring.

The Trojans were left looking for answers — and sometimes the ball
— in their series at Sunken Diamond. USC managed 28 hits but just
eight runs over three games.

Not only did the Cardinal sweep (JSC this weekend, they also received good news on the injury front.
Pitcher Brian Sackinsky returned to the mound after sitting out with bone chips in his elbow.
The afternoon winds took hold of
the ball and kept carrying it,
allowing the USC players to rise
and the Stanford faithful to hold
their breath. It was a scary
moment, but the ball landed just
foul over the fence.
"The wind was playing tricks
today," Burnett said. "My heart
sank when I saw that ball start to
go fair; the USC guys in the
bullpen almost tore the fence
down when they saw it go foul."
Weiss brushed off the moment
as only a good pitcher can and
brought down Hastings swinging
to end the inning and secure the
save for starter Willie Adams (5-
1). In one and two-thirds innings
of relief, Weiss struck out three,
and only gave up one hit.
That feat is most impressive
when you consider that the senior
also pitched almost five innings
Friday to collect the 6-3 win —
and then promptly told Marquess
he could go again.
Friday's opener saw Weiss pick
up for starter John Reid and allow
only one run on three hits, while
striking out three. The Trojans
had come into the game with 14
consecutive league wins, one shy
of the record that Stanford had
set the year before. After giving
the Trojans three of those league
wins, the Cardinal was not about
to surrender the record.
"We were aware of (the
record)," said first basemen Dave

McCarty after the game. "It was
definitely a factor."
Not as much of a factor as
McCarty himself. The 6-foot-4
junior went three for four on the
day, driving in two runs and
crushing a solo homer in the sixth
that proved to be the game winner.
"It was a case of too much
McCarty," said Gillespie. "You
never wish you are in a position
where you have to pitch to
McCarty, but we had to, and he
punished us."
The Cardinal will get no chance
to rest on its laurels as it contin
ues Six-Pac play this afternoon
against California in Berkeley.
