# Dreams of a title
## Regional victory makes gymnasts team to beat at NCAAs in two weeks 
### Noah Blake Staff writer 
Right about now, Stanford's
men's gymnastics coach Sadao
Hamada is getting a very
important conference call, one
in which he will be asked on
which event the Cardinal
would like to start the NCAA
Championships.
Hamada gets to choose an
event before any other coach
because his second-ranked
Stanford team, in winning the
NCAA western regionals this
weekend in Norman, Okla.,
beat the previously top-ranked
Sooners.
The Cardinal finally gave
Hamada what he has been
looking for all season, namely a
consistent performance. In the
two meets before the regionals,
Stanford gymnasts performed
difficult routines, but the team
was forced to count too many
missed routines and conse
quently finished second on
both occasions.
In Saturday night's
regional, before a screaming
throng of Sooner faithful, the
Cardinal hit many more rou
tines and consequently walked
away with both the victory and
the top seed for the NCAA
Championships.
Stanford finished with a
284.65, which included huge
scores of 48.8 on parallel bars
and 48.0 on pommel horse, and
avenged defeats to both second
place UCLA (283.1) and third
place Oklahoma (282.8).
All three teams, in addition
to fourth place Nebraska,
advance to meet the best four
teams from the weaker East
regional in the NCAA champi
onships, to be held on April 18-
20.
The top three teams in the
West (Stanford, UCLA and
Oklahoma) are the top three
teams in the country, so seem
ingly all the Cardinal will need
to do is repeat its regional per
formance in the champi
onships.
Not so, says Hamada. "We
are at 90 to 95 percent on par

allel bars and pommel horse,
but we are only at about 70 to
80 percent on the other four
events. ... I believe that we
have got to hit 90 percent on
every event to win the NCAA
Championships."
How the Cardinal recovers
from injury will be a major fac
tor in reaching the 90 percent
goal. Tim Ryan and Tim Wang,
both of whom competed in only
four events in the regionals,
should be at full strength in
two weeks.
Also of concern is freshman
Mark Booth's ankle, which he
injured Sunday in his first
tumbling pass on floor exer
cise. Hamada called the injury
a slight strain and he is guard
edly optimistic that Booth will
be at full strength for NCAAs.
"If [Ryan, Wang, and Booth]
recover, our floor exercise and
vault will be much better,"
Hamada said.
And the Cardinal will need
every advantage it can get in
the championships, which will
be held at Penn State. "Penn
State is the worst place in the
country for visitors," Hamada
said. "Their gym is small, but
the fans are very loud. We have
been training for just that kind
of disturbance."
"We are the number one
seeded team in the country, but
that doesn't mean anything,"
Hamada said. "The next week
and a half of practice will be
very important."
Hamada's strategy all sea
son was to have the Cardinal
peak for the NCAA Champi
onships and, by all indications,
that is exactly what is happen
ing. "I have no interest in the
other teams," Hamada said. "I
want my guys to perform at the
maximum level possible."
On the phone, right about
now, Sadao Hamada is proba
bly choosing a bye for the Car
dinal in the first rotation of the
NCAA Champioships. After all,
for a team that has waited
years for a national champi
onship, what's an extra 15
minutes?
