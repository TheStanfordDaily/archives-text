LOS ANGELES - There was
great tennis: spellbinding rallies,
bitter duels, breathtaking tie
breakers, amazing comebacks.
And there were Stanford's sec
ond and third defeats of the sea
son, its first conference losses of
the year.

Bruins 5, Cardinal 1

Trojans 5, Cardinal 4

The Cardinal did not expect a
day at the beach during its road
trip to Los Angeles, and it didn't
get one, falling to top-ranked
UCLA 5-1 on Friday, and nar
rowly coming up on the short end
of a 5-4 battle against USC Satur
day
While no one likes losing —
especially to league rivals — third
ranked Stanford isn't overly pre
occupied about the southern
sweep.
"Often we've gone down to L.A.
and lost both matches but still
won nationals. I'm not worried,"
coach Dick Gould said. "We can
hold our heads high because we
are playing well. I'm not disap
pointed by the caliber of play or
competitiveness of play.
"The biggest thing is to com
pete well, use your head, make
adjustments and stay in the
game."
Saturday's court warfare could
only be called an epic battle
between two very talented, and
well matched, teams. No player
had an advantage. No match was
a sure thing — even after a domi
nating first set.
Team competition was tied 3-3
after singles and went down to the
wire — No. 3 doubles. Six of the
nine duels went to three sets. Five
of the eventual victors lost their
first sets. There were five
tiebreakers, most of which were
decided 7-5 or 8-6. The seemingly
never-ending match was fought
for over six hours.
You can't get much better com
petition than that.
"I don't care if it's 5-4 or 9-0 as
long as we compete well, and we
did compete well," Gould said.
"Our biggest disappointment is
that USC has now beat us twice
(the first in the semifinals of the

National Team Indoors) and we
only have one match left. Unless
they lose some big matches they
will be the No. 1 seed at NCAAs."
Every match was armed com
bat, every game a struggle, but
Alex O'Brien's fight at No. 1 sin
gles epitomized the day. After
slugging his way to a 7-5 first-set
win over Byron Black, O'Brien
appeared to lose his mental edge
and his dictation of the game's
tempo, and was downed 6-2 in the
second.
Black capitalized on the shift in
momentum in the baseline duel —
every point seemed to require a
10- to 20-shot rally — and took a
3-0 lead in the third.
O'Brien must have had a
strange feeling of deja vu, for at
the National Indoors he won the
first set against Black, lost the
second and was beaten 6-0 in the
third.
USC's small but noisy crowd
was sure victory was near.
O'Brien, however, isn't playing at
No. 1 for the three-time defending
national champion by accident.
After breaking Black to get on
the board, O'Brien held, then
broke Black again to even things
out at three. O'Brien proceeded to
make it six in a row to capture the
set and win the match.
"Alex deserves an awful lot of
credit. After losing to Byron in
three at the Indoors it was very
impressive that he stayed in the
match mentally," Gould said.
"Black faltered just a little bit and
Alex was able to take advantage.
It was a real good comeback for
Alex."
Jared Palmer had a little more
difficult time with Brian MacPhie
at No. 2. Although he consistently
broke MacPhie, Palmer couldn't
hold on to his advantages and was
downed 6-3, 6-4.
Playing in only his fourth sin
gles match since returning from a
stress fracture, Jonathan Stark
engaged in his second down-to
the-wire, three-set battle in as
many days at No. 3.
Stark was up 6-4, 3-0 on Donny
Issak before the always-tough
Issak staged a comeback of his
own, breaking Stark at 3-1 and
holding serve to even things up at
three. Each player held until the
set was forced into a tiebreaker,
and Issak prevailed, sending the
match into a third set.
The final stanza was almost as
close as the previous one, until
Stark aced his way to a 5-3 advan

tage. Issak held, but so did Stark,
and the three-hour battle was his.
"It was nice to see John win. I
was impressed with what must
have been going through his mind
after (losing the third set) Fri
day," added Gould.
At No. 4 singles, Jason Yee fell
6-7, 5-7 to the Trojan's John
Leach, while at No. 5 Michael
Flanagan gave Stanford a 3-2
advantage after holding off
Andras Lanyi 1-6, 6-4, 6-2.
In the crucial sixth singles
match (started two hours after
the other five because USC for
some reason only built five
courts), Vimal Patel appeared to
be giving the Cardinal an impor
tant edge heading into doubles by

easily downing David Ekerot 6-2
in the first set.
But Ekerot dug in and shifted
momentum to his side of the
court, taking the second 6-2 and
holding on for a 7-5 victory.
Three-all heading into doubles.
The see-saw battle continued.
At No. 1 doubles, Stark and
Palmer appeared to have the men
tal edge in the serve-and-volley
duel against Black and MacPhie,
taking a 6-2 lead. But Byron and
Brian aren't ranked No. 6 nation
ally for their names.
The teams traded service
breaks until set number two was
forced into a tiebreaker — a battle


Benjamin Tong — Daily
Alex O'Brien and coach Dick Gould had trouble finding answers on
the weekend. Friday, Stanford was blitzed by UCLA and Saturday the
Cardinal was edged by USC in Southern California.
