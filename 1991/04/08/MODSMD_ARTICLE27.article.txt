# Women's tennis smashes USC; slips past UCLA
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Once upon a time, USC was atop the
collegiate tennis world. The Women of
Troy captured six national champi
onships between 1977 and 1985. They
were simply the best.
Oh, how the mighty have fallen.
The best any of the Trojans could do
against the Cardinal Friday was at fifth
singles where Julie Tullberg took five
games off freshman Laxmi Foruri. And
that match, which was never close, pro
vided USC's best chance of scoring a
point in what ended up as a 6-0 shutout.

Fortunately for tennis fans, fourth
ranked UCLA strode into town Saturday
with a plethora of singles players who
could play in the middle of anyone's
lineup. That meant the Bruins were weak
at the top but strong at the bottom and,
for a while, appeared as though they just
might beat Stanford.
But the five-time defending NCAA
champs came through in the clutch to
score a solid 6-3 victory over UCLA and
up their season mark to 18-1, 7-0 in
Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division
play. UCLA fell to 17-3, 6-1 while USC,
after getting blitzed by California Satur
day, is now is now 4-12. 0-7.
The only noteworthy event Friday was
that senior Sandra Birch was able to
defeat USC's Trisha Laux, who is ranked
second nationally, one spot ahead of Birch
in the Volvo Tennis/Collegiate poll.
In four tries, Birch had never beaten
Laux. Friday though, the 1989 NCAA sin
gles titlist was too much for the 5-foot-2,
power-hitting baseliner. Birch scored a
resounding 6-2, 6-2 victory which set the
pace in Stanford's shellacking of USC.
The only other ranked Trojan is senior
Stephanie London. She retired due to

back trouble after junior Debbie Graham
scored a 6-1 victory over her in the first
set.
Far and away the largest crowd of the
season came out Saturday to see UCLA
face the Cardinal. And, they were treated
to an exciting match that Stanford pulled
out thanks to solid doubles and a gritty
win by junior Kylie Johnson over the Bru
ins' crafty Cammie Foley.
The Cardinal jumped ahead early
thanks to Birch's 6-1, 6-0 rout of an over
matched Iwalani McCalla and Teri
Whitlinger's 6-0, 6-3 demolition of
Kirsten Dreyer. Junior Debbie Graham
towered over her opponent, Kim Po, by
almost a foot in stature and at least that
much in performance.
Graham's 6-3, 6-3 victory over Po gave
the Cardinal a critical third point in sin
gles. But UCLA had some answers. At
fifth singles, Stella Sampras steamrolled
freshman Laxmi Poruri 6-0, 6-2. "Was
that Stella? I thought it was Pete," said
Stanford coach Frank Brennan referring
to Sampras' younger brother, the current
U.S. Open champion.
Mamie Ceniza put another tally on the
board for UCLA with a 6-1, 6-4 win over
sophomore Heather Willens. The match,
though, was not as lopsided as they score
might indicate. "I was so confident
through the second set she was going to
win it," said assistant coach Lele Forood.
Willens held a 4-1 lead in the second
set before dropping the next two games.
"The pivotal game was the 4-3 game,"
Forood said. "When Mamie held for 4-4, it
was her match."
Meanwhile at No. 6 singles, Johnson
was engaged in a thriller with Foley that
would prove critical. After falling behind
3-0 in the first set, Johnson reeled off five
straight games to take a seemingly com
manding lead. Until Foley evened the set
at 5-5, that is, and then broke Johnson to
go up 6-5.
But the wily Stanford veteran broke
back and captured a see-saw tiebreaker 8-
6 when Foley double-faulted. Johnson,
who said afterward "I like tiebreakers"
has hardly ever lost one in her career at

Stanford.
The second set saw seven more service
breaks. Eventually, though, Johnson was
serving at 6-5 and ripped off a service
winner to take the match and make it 4-2
Cardinal.
"I knew that I wouldn't lose if I played
smart," Johnson said, adding that she is
still recovering from a major ankle injury.
"I don't feel like I'm very quick right
now."

But she was quick enough and men
tally tough enough to take control when it
counted, to battle a tricky wind and to
answer the challenge when Foley took a 4-
1 second set deficit and drew even at 5-5.
"She started hitting the ball a lot harder,"
Johnson said. "I needed to step in and try
to counter."
When Johson stepped in, Foley often
answered with a double fault and was
unable to respond with her usual variety

of moon balls and the like.
With the singles complete, the Cardi
nal needed just one doubles victory to
clinch the team win. But for a while
UCLA led on all three cards — and had
captured first sets at No. 1 and 2 doubles.
Suddenly, Stanford began to turn it
around, particularly at No. 3.

tough win over fourth-ranked UCLA to move the Cardinal to 18-1 on the season.
