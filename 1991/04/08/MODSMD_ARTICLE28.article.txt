# Gymnasts sixth at regionals
## 
### Brandi Shipp Staff writer 
The Stanford women's gym
nastics team hung up their leo
tards after what turned out to
be their last meet of the season
at Oregon State in Corvallis.
At the NCAA Regionals on
Saturday, the Cardinal placed
sixth in the final standings, with
a score of 187.75 points. Seeded
as number seven out of seven
teams, the gymnasts made some
improvement but not nearly
enough to challenge Oregon
State, who placed first with
194.95 points.
"It is a little disappointing
because we had a chance to
score high," coach Breck Green
wood said.
Stanford's downfall came
during the bar routine, where
they experienced some major
problems. "We had three big
breaks on bars that cost us two
places," Greenwood said. He cal
culated that, without those
three mistakes, the team may
have placed fourth instead of
sixth in the final standings.
Although bars was a disap
pointing event, the Stanford
women were quite impressive
on the balance beam. All six
Stanford competitors hit their
beam routines, having no falls
among them. This ends a sensa
tional season on the beam, Stan
ford's best event throughout the
vear.

Kerrie Kelley, in her first
year of collegiate competition,
went through all 13 meets of the
season without one fall. Equally
outstanding, freshman Laurie
West had just one fall in the 13
meets, which occurred in her
first meet of the season. "1 am
very happy with their perfor
mances," Greenwood said.
"They have really done well this
year."
In the all-around competition
of the NCAA Regionals, the
Stanford gymnasts did not place
within the top bracket of scores.
Freshman Kerri Kanuka, Stan
ford's usual all-around leader,
ended with an llth-place finish
after scoring 37.675, a lower
point total than usual.
"Kerri had a rough meet. She
was a little ill, and it really hurt
her chances to do well," Green
wood said. Kanuka, who was
predicted to perform well
enough to make it to the NCAA
Championships, most likely fin
ished her season in Corvallis,
although the official results are
not in yet.
On the other hand, freshman
Kerrie Kelley had an excellent
meet for herself, scoring a
37.375 and finishing in 21st
place. "Kerrie did a new vault for
the fist time, and tied the school
record on bars (9.7 points, which
is also held by Kanuka and
senior Jen Bloom]," Greenwood
said.
The rest of the Stanford gym

nasts placed right behind Kelley,
including Jennifer Bloom in
23rd, West in 24th place and
Mollie Brown in 26th.
In terms of the entire season,
the gymnasts did quite well,
considering their circum
stances. "Despite the fact that
we were down in numbers and
had a young team, we had a
good season," Greenwood said.
There were only eight women
on the squad, four of whom
were freshmen.
Next year, the team will be
even younger, having graduated
three seniors off of the team.
Senior Jennifer Bloom will
certainly be missed. Through
out the year, Bloom has consis
tently ranked among the top
Stanford competitors in the all
around competition, making
herself a valuable competitor for
the Cardinal.
She has carved herself a place
in Stanford gymnastics history
with a few record-breaking
scores. Seniors Marietta Frey
and Julie Dunhill will also be a
big loss to the team and Stan
ford gymnastics fans.
"They will be missed from an
emotional standpoint, more
than anything," Greenwood
said. "They were both leaders
on the team, and good people."
In their place, Stanford will
be welcoming four new fresh
men recruits next year, which
will make the '91-'92 squad
even younger.
