# Some shine in Lone Star State
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Staff writer 
The Stanford track team rode
into the Texas Relays last week
end ready to face the biggest guns
the Lone Star State had to offer.
After the smoke had cleared, what
transpired could be called good,
bad and ugly.
The good was provided by the
Cardinal field competitors and the
top sharpshooter was junior
Jackie Edwards.
She was disappointed with her
performance last week at the Diet
Pepsi Track Challenge because
she did not reach her goal of 41
feet in the triple jump.
In Austin, Edwards made that
distance and then some. She set a
personal record with a leap of 41
feet seven inches. Not stopping
there, she leaped to a personal
best in the long jump, too.
"I did expect to do better [than
at home]. The track is a lot faster
and there is more competition,"
Edwards said.
Her 20-feet, long jump
set a Stanford school record. She
placed second in both events while
provisionally qualifying for the
NCAA Championships with her
stellar leaps.

Edwards expects she'll have to
increase her long jump by two or
three inches and her triple jump
by half a foot to make the champi
onship field. She hopes to accom
plish these goals during the next
few weeks of competition.
Another Cardinal cowpoke who
performed well in the long jump
was senior Marcus Hickerson.
After barely making the finals
with a qualifying leap of 24 feet,
11 inches, Hickerson hit several
25 foot jumps. His 25 feet, BK-inch
jump placed him fourth.
Unfortunately for Hickerson
the leap was actually well over 26
feet.
"I didn't even hit the board.
That's a bit frustrating, but at
least I know I can jump that far
now. I would expect to jump that
far in June, not the first week in
April," Hickerson said.
Following the jumpers' good
performances was senior thrower
Debbie Malueg. She scored a per
sonal record in the shot put with a
toss a few inches short of 50 feet.
With that she also provisionally
qualified for the NCAA Champi
onships. Her favorite event, dis
cus, was rained out.
The weather was bad through
out the weekend with rains and

blustery, cold conditions. Follow
ing course with the weather the
women's 4xloo-meter relay squad
did not run well and failed to qual
ify for the finals.
There were bright spots on the
track as Ashley Black finished
fifth in the 1,500 meters and the
men's distance relay squads fared
well against top competitors.
The meet, however, turned
ugly for Stanford when star
sprinter Chryste Gaines suffered
a slight hamstring pull. Coach
Brooks Johnson expects her to be
100 percent by Big Meet, the
annual showdown with California
which takes place at the end of
April.
Now starts a three week train
ing cycle for the team in which the
upcoming home meets will be
used to prepare for driving the
Golden Bears into the ground.
Johnson said the California
meet, on the men's side, will be a
test of our middle distance
strength versus their sprint and
throw strength. We will counter
the UC-Berkeley women with
strong sprinting and jumping
squads.
Then comes another three
week session geared toward the
Pacific 10 Conference meet.
