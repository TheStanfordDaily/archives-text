# Program makes kids friends
## 
### Eleni Kirkas Staff writer 
In just three hours a week, senior Sarah
Connell makes a difference in a young per
son's life.
Connell is one of 26 Stanford volunteers
in Friends For Youth, a Redwood City orga
nization that pairs adults and children from
the surrounding communities in relation
ships designed to give youths from troubled
backgrounds a strong positive influence in
their lives.
A mtyor goal of the program is to give
children a friend thev can trust — someone

other than their parents — who will expose
them to different ideas and opportunities,
said Connell, who coordinates the volun
teer effort on campus.
After going through a rigorous interview
process, volunteers are matched with a
youth ranging in age from 10 to 17, though
for Stanford volunteers the partners are no
older than 14.
Most of the children are referred to the
program by youth professionals in schools
and social service agencies. Their difficul
ties range from loneliness to juvenile delin-
quency, but all are considered at
risk for developing more serious
problems later.
Volunteer coordinator Cassan
dra Grady said early intervention
is a key to success for the pro

gram. Youth who are in very seri
ous trouble are generally helped
by social services or the juvenile
justice system, but for those on
the borderline of trouble, there
may not be any such help avail
able, she said.
"Every kid needs a positive
adult in their life," she said
"Senior friends" are expected
to spend at least three hours a

week with their "junior friend"
playing sports, going to the beach
or the movies or just talking
together.
Although the time commit
ment is small, the impact of the
friendships can be great. Grady
said the relationships give chil
dren a role model and show them
what they can achieve.
Senior Christophe Mosby,

senior friend to 14-year-old Noah
from East Palo Alto, agreed.
"Hopefully somewhere down the
line, our relationship will help
him," he said.
Mosby said he joined the pro
gram this year primarily to serve
the black community. Most stu
dents can and should contribute
to those in their community less
fortunate than themselves, he
added.
"Even if we come from
deprived backgrounds, we're for
tunate to be here," he said.
Grady, herself a Stanford grad
uate, added that the friendships
benefit students by giving them a
new perspective on the University
and the surrounding cities.
Mosby and Connell both said
that watching their relationships
develop into real friendships as
they spend more time with their
junior friends has been one of the
most rewarding aspects of the
program.
In addition to spending time
with the children, senior friends
also discuss their relationship
with a program counselor each
week and keep in touch with the
agency that referred their junior
friends.
Working with the program
staff, senior friends also try to
establish long-term goals for their
friendships. Community volun
teers must commit to their friend
ship for a year, although for Stan
ford students the commitment is
one academic quarter.
While most activities in the
program are one-on-one, the
organization does stage a few
group activities, such as roller
skating or barbecuing.
