# Golfers get it going
## Women look to secure ranking 
### Peter J. Blum Staff writer 
Baking beneath the Arizona
sun today, the women's golf
team squares off in the Arizona
State Lady Sun Devil Tourna
ment at Carsten Golf Course
hoping to put a stranglehold on
its present No. 5 national rank
ing.
The golfers have three days
to roast their opponents on the
oar-72 course with an outlay of
6,100 yards.
Coach Tim Baldwin said,
"We plan on improving sub
stantially on our eighth-place
finish last year."
As the team attempts to
cement its top five standing in
the NCAA, it will have its
hands full of competition.
Although host Arizona State,
the defending NCAA cham

pion, is ranked No. 22, the Car
dinal will find itself avoiding
sand traps and water hazards
against the likes of top-ranked
San Jose State, No. 2 Arizona
and No. 3 UCLA.
The Cardinal is not unfamil
iar with this heavy competi
tion. In their last tournament,
the University of Hawaii Inter
collegiate, the women putted
their way to a fourth place fin
ish behind Arizona, UCLA and
San Jose State.
Leading the Cardinal at the
top slot, junior Adele Moore is
one of two Stanford golfers
ranked among the top 20 in the
NCAA. Ranked 19th, Moore is
seven notches below junior
Audrey Wooding in the
national rankings. But Bald
win decided to go with her at
No. 1 because of her superb
performance in Hawaii.
