The men's golf team will be
putting, driving and wedging
today in the Etonic Southwest
Intercollegiate Golf Champi
onship at the North Ranch
Country Club down south in
Westlake Village.
The tournament will span
two days with the Cardinal
golfers playing 36 holes today
and finishing with 18 more
tomorrow.
According to coach Wally
Goodwin, the golfers will be
making a run at the other 23
teams in the tournament
tomorrow. "These kids savor
the last day of tournaments,"
Goodwin said. "They have fun
when things start to grind."
Currently ranked No. 6 in
the West and No. 25 in the
nation, the golfers will attempt
to affix their position among
the elite nine western teams
vhich will qualify for the
>ICAA West Regional in mid-
May.
The drivers will face among
others Arkansas, California,
Cal State-Northridge, Nevada,
Oregon, Oregon State, Pacific,
Pepperdine, San Jose State,
UCLA, USC, Texas-EL Paso,
Washington, Weber State and

Rice.
Although the team has not
competed in nearly a month,
recording a victory over Cali
fornia on March 8, the team is
ready to make a run at the
NCAAs after working out dur
ing spring break at the Poppy
Hills and Spanish Bay golf
courses down in fabled Pebble
Beach.
The young cast of putters,
who were not even ranked in
the preseason, have more than
taken up the slack left by the
graduation of six seniors last
year.
Christian Cevaer, a junior, is
the oldest member of a squad
composed of a starting five
which includes two sopho
mores and two freshmen. Hail
ing from Cannes, France,
Cevaer was the Pacific 10 Con
ference champion in his fresh
man season.
However, the veteran
Cevaer with a stroke average of
75.4 is being pushed by his
younger teammates.
Freshman Notah Begay is
the most notable young golfer.
Begay was the second ranked
junior golfer last year, and this
season he has led the team in
three of its seven competitions
and posts a team-leading
stroke average of 74.3.
