# Spikers win, keep playoff hopes alive
## 
### Kevin Jeffery Staff writer 
It's finally over. After suffering
through nine weeks and 10
matches of WIVA futility, the Car
dinal men's volleyball team had

reason to celebrate Saturday as
they downed UC-Irvine for their
first league win since Feb. 2.
The 16-14, 15-9, 15-8 victopr
put Stanford (7-11 overall) back in
the hunt for a wild-card berth in
the Western Intercollegiate Vol-

leyball Association postseason
tournament. They jumped back
into a tie with llth-ranked Loyola
Marymount (who lost Thursday
to Hawaii) for fourth in the Wil
son division at 5-10.
The Cardinal wasn't spectacu
lar Saturday night, but they
didn't need to be. The Anteaters
offered little resistance after the
first game, hitting a pathetic .140
for the match and mustering only
a total of seven team blocks. But
when you haven't won in nine
weeks, it doesn't matter if it's not
pretty.
"I know we could have played
better. We certainly weren't as
sharp as we were on our road trip
(last weekend)," said coach Ruben
Nieves.
"But at the same time I don't
want to underrate a WIVA win.
We handled a team with three
league victories very soundly. And
we're relieved to finally get the
monkey off our backs."
After jumping to an impressive
11-3 lead in the first game, the
Cardinal gave up seven straight
points and eventually allowed
Irvine to tie the score at 14-14.
Stanford fans were surely think
ing, "Here we go again," because
the Cardinal has lost big leads and
has faltered in close games
throughout the losing streak.
So when they scored two
straight points to capture game
one, something good was bound to
follow . And it did, as the Cardinal
rode excellent blocking and dig
ging to easy wins in games two
and three.
The ninth-ranked Cardinal was
led both defensively and offen
sively by outside hitters Dave
Goss and Duncan Blackman. Goss
had five blocks, four digs and 15
kills, and Blackman added six digs
and 13 kills.
Setter Canyon Ceman also
turned in a solid match with 50
assists, two service aces and five

kills for an .833 hitting percent
age.
The win kept Stanford's hopes
alive in the cloudy WIVA playoff
picture. The Cardinal, Loyola
Marymount and UC-Santa Bar
bara will battle for the final two
spots. Both Stanford and Loyola
Marymount have one match
remaining on their league sched
ule, while Santa Barbara (5-8) has
three.
For the Cardinal, that unfortu
nately means facing top-ranked
USC at Maples Pavilion April 20.
The Lions will travel to Cal-State
Northridge to play the fourth
ranked Matadors. The Gauchos
(ranked eighth) still must face
Northridge and Long Beach State
(No. 2) on the road, and UCLA
(No. 6) at home.
Stanford loses out in three-way
tiebreaker. Therefore, if the teams
all finish with the same record,
the Cardinal is eliminated. They
do, however, have the edge in a
head-to-head tiebreaker with Loy
ola. If the Cardinal and Lions tie
with five wins and the Gauchos
have six or more wins, the Lions
are eliminated. . . . Not done yet.
All this means is that Stanford
needs help. Even if they pull what
would the biggest upset of the sea
son and beat USC, to qualify they
still need either Loyola to lose, or
Santa Barbara to win either zero,
two or three of their remaining
matches.
But if Stanford doesn't beat the
Trojans, there still is hope. They
qualify if the Lions loses to Cal-
State Northridge and the Gauchos
wins at least one of their final
three matches.. . . Whew.
