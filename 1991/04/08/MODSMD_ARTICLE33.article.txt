# Conference criticizes U.S. prenatal care
## 
### Eden Quainton 
With a blistering indictment of prenatal
care in the United States, Dr. Reed Tuckson, a
senior vice-president at the March of Dimes
Birth Defects Foundation, opened a two-day
conference this weekend at Kresge Audito
rium.
The conference, titled "Prenatal Care: Can
America Deliver?" was the fifth in a series
sponsored by the Stanford Health Policy
Forum. It was organized to address what one
of its coordinators, second-year medical stu
dent Amar Das, described as a "crisis" in pre
natal care in the United States, which has the
highest infant mortality rate in the industrial
ized world.
In his keynote speech, Tuckson struck a
theme echoed by other speakers throughout
the forum. "Health is a place where all our
social problems come together," he told the
more than 150 people in attendance. "I see
people who are disenfranchised and disaf
fected. I see a dwindling resource base. I see
two trains on a collision course and an obvious
outcome."
Noting that 40,000 babies die prematurely
each year and more than 100,000 are born
with severe birth defects, Tuckson argued that
the root causes of the current crisis in prenatal
care are largely social and ideological.
"As a person of color, I am well aware that
black babies die at twice the rate of white
babies," he said.

Picking up on Dr. Tuckson's lead, other
speakers stressed the underlying social and
structural problems that plague present
efforts to deliver adequate prenatal care.
Dr. Janet Mitchell from the Harlem Hospi
tal in New York City suggested that the cur
rent conception of prenatal care in this coun
try is outdated.
Mitchell said the U.S. prenatal care system
was designed in the late 19th century to treat
toxemia, or pregnancy-induced hypertension.
This system is ill-equipped to solve the psy
chosocial problems of chemical dependency,
poverty and despair which lie at the root of the
prenatal care crisis, she said.
Rosalie Ramirez, a registered nurse at the
Santa Clara County Department of Public
Health, also noted the numerous cultural bar
riers that prevent many pregnant women from
seeking prenatal care.
For example, many immigrants are afraid
to seek such care because they fear losing eligi
bility for amnesty, do not speak English or are
ashamed of being illiterate, Ramirez said.
Other women are too preoccupied with
finding work and housing to seek treatment
until late in their pregnancies, said Carol
Howe, a certified nurse midwife at the Oregon
Health Sciences University School of Nursing.
While the problems in delivering adequate
prenatal care primarily affect the poor and
women of color, white middle-class women also
suffer from inadequate treatment during preg
nancy, said Elaine Miller-Karas of the Mid-

Coastal California Perinatal Outreach Pro
gram.
Miller-Karas related the story of a middle
class white woman who was freebasing cocaine
during her pregnancy. The woman had a
drunk driving record, had problems gaining
weight and occasionally "spotted," or bled
lightly.
Despite these warning signs, no one ever
asked her any questions relating to alcohol or
drug use until she arrived unconscious in a
delivery room with a ruptured placenta, the
result of a recent cocaine binge.
Her newborn daughter died two days later.
While a generally pessimistic and some
times bitter tone prevailed on the first day of
the conference, speakers on the second day of
the conference, perhaps buoyed by a report
Sunday that infant mortality declined in 1990,
expressed hope that the prenatal care crisis
could be solved.
Sylvia Ivie, a lawyer in charge of the To
Help Everyone Clinic for women in Los Ange
les, credited the success of her clinic, which
has grown into a multi-million-dollar organi
zation, to its personalized approach and its
inclusion of large numbers of women, ethnic
minorities and non-medical specialists.
Sam Wu, one of the conference's coordina
tors, also expressed qualified optimism in his
assessment of the future.
"Investing in prenatal care makes sense,"
he said, "because it will pay for itself in the
long run."
