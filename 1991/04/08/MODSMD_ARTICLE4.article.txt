# Hoover scholars gave Yeltsin policy advice
## Moscow meeting reviewed economic plans 
### Martha Brockenbrough Senior staff writer 
Mikhail Gorbachev may be sorry he
didn't stop by the Hoover Institution when
he came to Stanford last June.
As the Soviet president faces the worst
crises of his career, including the political
and economic breakdown of the Soviet
Union and the secession of the Baltic
republics, his political nemesis, Russian
leader Boris Yeltsin, has sought — and
received — advice on economic reform poli
cies from four Hoover scholars.
The scholars visited the Soviet Union in
early March, but only announced their trip
last Friday.
Yeltsin's reform proposals, which con
trast with Gorbachev's more conservative
strategies, have been put before the Soviet
and Russian senates. Many scholars think
that unless the Soviet Senate accepts them,
further fragmentation of the Soviet Union
may result.
Reforms made in Russia would force
change throughout the country because the
Russian republic comprises half of the
Soviet population and 60 percent of its

gross national product, said Hoover senior
research fellow Mikhail Bernstam, one of
the four who went to the Soviet Union to
advise Yeltsin.
Bernstam's colleague Charles McLure, a
senior fellow, also reviewed Yeltsin's reform
proposals. Despite abundant natural
resources and last fall's bumper crop of
grain, McLure said, hunger, poverty and
wasteful resource management are becom
ing increasingly serious problems.
Yeltsin's radical proposals would address
these issues by:
• Establishing private property rights;
• Redistributing state capital and land to
private owners;
• Establishing a non-arbitrary taxation
policy; and
• Developing banks and a stock market.
Senior fellows Edward Lazear and
Thomas Sargent, together with Bernstam
and McLure, were invited to advise Yeltsin
by his economic adviser, Mikhail Bocharov,
who visited Hoover in January to view the
Institution's renowned Russian studies col
lection.
Bocharov is chair of the
Supreme Economic Council of the
Russian Republic and a deputy in
the Soviet Parliament.
Frustrated with Gorbachev's
plodding reform policies and
motivated by increasing Russian
nationalism, Yeltsin and
Bocharov asked the Hoover schol
ars Feb. 27 to come to the Soviet
Union. The economists flew to
Russia a few days later and met
Yeltsin and Bocharov in the lat
ter's office.
Lazear, who has advised both
Rumania and Czechoslovakia on
economic issues, said Yeltsin's
committee was "not naive" about
free-market economics. They pre
sented the Hoover scholars with
specific reform strategies, which
the group evaluated as colleagues,
not as instructors, he added.
"They treated us as high-level,
trusted advisers," the 42-year-old
scholar said.
The summit was a landmark in
Hoover-Soviet relations, and pos
sibly U.S.-Russian relations. Aca
demics have been advising the
U.S. government for the last 25
years on policy matters, but only
recently has such exchange been
extended to Central and Eastern
Europe, Lazear said.
Still, however, institutions like

Hoover are not geared for regular,
formal international advising.
Last month's exchange came
about because Hoover made the
four scholars available as individ
ual economists, not as representa
tives of the think tank, McLure
said.
The four scholars said they
advised not about politics, but on
establishing a free-market econ
omy and formulating emergency
measures to end the current food
crisis. They made no recommen
dations as to whether Russia
should remain in the Soviet
Union. "We are neither marriage
counselors nor divorce lawyers,"
Bernstam said.
Since Latvia, Estonia and
Lithuania declared their indepen
dence last year, political bonds of
the Soviet confederacy have loos
ened. Georgia may secede, and 70
percent of Yeltsin's Russian vot
ers supported having their own
president in a March referendum.
Bernstam said the current
union is a thing of the past.
"There has been a Soviet Union,"
he said. "There is no such thing
anymore." He said he is more
optimistic about a future free
market confederation.
McLure blames the breakdown
of the Soviet economy on overly
centralized planning and resis
tance to radical change. He said
reforms to date are so cautious
thev will fail.
