# Hoover scholars gave Yeltsin policy advice
## Moscow meeting reviewed economic plans

Mikhail Gorbachev may be sorry he
didn't stop by the Hoover Institution when
he came to Stanford last June.
As the Soviet president faces the worst
crises of his career, including the political
and economic breakdown of the Soviet
Union and the secession of the Baltic
republics, his political nemesis, Russian
leader Boris Yeltsin, has sought — and
received — advice on economic reform poli
cies from four Hoover scholars.
The scholars visited the Soviet Union in
early March, but only announced their trip
last Friday.
Yeltsin's reform proposals, which con
trast with Gorbachev's more conservative
strategies, have been put before the Soviet
and Russian senates. Many scholars think
that unless the Soviet Senate accepts them,
further fragmentation of the Soviet Union
may result.
Reforms made in Russia would force
change throughout the country because the
Russian republic comprises half of the
Soviet population and 60 percent of its

gross national product, said Hoover senior
research fellow Mikhail Bernstam, one of
the four who went to the Soviet Union to
advise Yeltsin.
Bernstam's colleague Charles McLure, a
senior fellow, also reviewed Yeltsin's reform
proposals. Despite abundant natural
resources and last fall's bumper crop of
grain, McLure said, hunger, poverty and
wasteful resource management are becom
ing increasingly serious problems.
Yeltsin's radical proposals would address
these issues by:
• Establishing private property rights;
• Redistributing state capital and land to
private owners;
• Establishing a non-arbitrary taxation
policy; and
• Developing banks and a stock market.
Senior fellows Edward Lazear and
Thomas Sargent, together with Bernstam
and McLure, were invited to advise Yeltsin
by his economic adviser, Mikhail Bocharov,
who visited Hoover in January to view the
Institution's renowned Russian studies col
lection.
