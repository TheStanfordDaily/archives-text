# New bill could revive debate on free speech

A bill recently proposed by an Illinois
representative could give students at Stan
ford and other private universities the right
to sue their schools over policies limiting
offensive speech.
Rep. Henry Hyde, a senior Republican
on the House Subcommittee on Civil and
Constitutional Rights, introduced the Col
legiate Speech Restriction Act of 1991,
which, if passed, would amend Title VI of
the Civil Rights Act of 1964 giving students
at private universities the right to chal
lenge, in federal courts, disciplinary codes
that punish objectionable speech.
The 185-word bill, which has already
garnered support from the American Civil
Liberties Union, will be sent to the subcom
mittee for hearing later this year.
Under the 14th Amendment to the Con
stitution, the Bill of Rights (including the
First Amendment right to free speech) gov
erns only the policies of public entities. As a
result, students at public universities can
rightfully sue their institution for infringe
ment of the First Amendment rights.
But according to a 1989 statement by
Vice President and General Counsel John
Schwartz and Assoc. General Counsel Iris
Brest, Stanford, as a private institution, is

"not bound by the First Amendment and
can regulate or curtail the expression of
thought to a greater extent than a govern
ment - or a state university - may."
In June 1990, after an 18-month debate,
the Student Conduct Legislative Council
voted to amend the Fundamental Standard
to include provisions for punishment,
including expulsion, for speech "intended
to insult or stigmatize an individual or a
small number of individuals on the basis of
their sex, race, color, handicap, religion,
sexual orientation or national and ethnic
origin."
Should the Hyde legislation pass, the
constitutionality of speech codes at any uni
versity which receives federal funds could
be questioned. Since most institutions
receive federal funding, virtually all educa
tional institutions, public and private,
would be affected by the bill.
But administrators are unsure what
effect the Hyde bill, if passed, would have
on Stanford's policy.
"All Hyde would do is make it possible
for someone to question if the Fundamen
tal Standard fis in accord with] the First
Amendment as a legal question," said Stan
ford Law School Dean Paul Brest. "Without
Hyde, as far as private institutions are con-
