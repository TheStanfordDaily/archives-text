# New bill could revive debate on free speech
## 
### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Staff writer 
A bill recently proposed by an Illinois
representative could give students at Stan
ford and other private universities the right
to sue their schools over policies limiting
offensive speech.
Rep. Henry Hyde, a senior Republican
on the House Subcommittee on Civil and
Constitutional Rights, introduced the Col
legiate Speech Restriction Act of 1991,
which, if passed, would amend Title VI of
the Civil Rights Act of 1964 giving students
at private universities the right to chal
lenge, in federal courts, disciplinary codes
that punish objectionable speech.
The 185-word bill, which has already
garnered support from the American Civil
Liberties Union, will be sent to the subcom
mittee for hearing later this year.
Under the 14th Amendment to the Con
stitution, the Bill of Rights (including the
First Amendment right to free speech) gov
erns only the policies of public entities. As a
result, students at public universities can
rightfully sue their institution for infringe
ment of the First Amendment rights.
But according to a 1989 statement by
Vice President and General Counsel John
Schwartz and Assoc. General Counsel Iris
Brest, Stanford, as a private institution, is

"not bound by the First Amendment and
can regulate or curtail the expression of
thought to a greater extent than a govern
ment - or a state university - may."
In June 1990, after an 18-month debate,
the Student Conduct Legislative Council
voted to amend the Fundamental Standard
to include provisions for punishment,
including expulsion, for speech "intended
to insult or stigmatize an individual or a
small number of individuals on the basis of
their sex, race, color, handicap, religion,
sexual orientation or national and ethnic
origin."
Should the Hyde legislation pass, the
constitutionality of speech codes at any uni
versity which receives federal funds could
be questioned. Since most institutions
receive federal funding, virtually all educa
tional institutions, public and private,
would be affected by the bill.
But administrators are unsure what
effect the Hyde bill, if passed, would have
on Stanford's policy.
"All Hyde would do is make it possible
for someone to question if the Fundamen
tal Standard fis in accord with] the First
Amendment as a legal question," said Stan
ford Law School Dean Paul Brest. "Without
Hyde, as far as private institutions are con-
cerned, there would be no legal
question."
A 1989 survey by the Carnegie
Foundation indicated that of 355
colleges and universities sur
veyed, 60 percent had instituted
restrictions on free speech and 11
percent were planning speech
restriction codes on bigotry, racial
harassment and intimidation.
Hyde, an outspoken conserva
tive from the sixth congressional
district of Illinois, said his bill is a
reaction to the damaging legacy of
speech restrictions on campuses
and"the demands of political cor
rectness that are casting a pall of
intolerance over American uni
versities."
"If free speech means any
thing, it means the right to say
unpopular things that other peo
ple disagree with," he said.
"I think part of growing up is
learning how to deal with the
opinions you hate," Hyde said.
"Shooting the messenger is not a
way to deal with bad news or
unpopular opinions. The most
effective weapon of a democratic
society is free speech," Hyde
added.
The Hyde camp has enlisted a
powerful lobby in its political
arsenal â€” the ACLU, an organi

zation that has clashed with Hyde
on past issues.
"Students must be able to
express whatever ideas they
choose," said ACLU president
Nadine Strosser, also a constitu
tional law professor at New York
Law School.
"This legislation is a vital step
toward guaranteeing students of
every background and ideology a
means to challenge efforts at
enforced orthodoxy of any stripe,"
added Strosser, who will be a par
ticipant in Wednesday's "Safe
Speech, Free Speech and the Uni
versity" conference presented by
the ASSU Speakers Bureau.
The Hyde proposal does not
extend to obscenity, threats and
other forms of conduct not con
sidered to be protected speech. As
a result, the legislation would also
not effect restrictions of "time,
place and manner restrictions,"
which are constitutionally per
missible.
These limitations led one Hyde
staffer, Sam Strathman, to say
that such a bill would not lead to
litigation lunacy.
"I think it is a bogus argument
to say if it passes it will open the
floodgate of legislation. I think if
it does pass, it will raise the red
flags in universities and make
them exercise more care to the
First Amendment rights of stu
dents," he said.
