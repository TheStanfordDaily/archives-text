We apologize for the delay.
Dear Students and Educators:
Please accept our sincerest apologies for any inconvenience you may have experienced in
trying to get your course packets this term. Kinko's has provided timely, up-to-date
course materials to students for over twenty years, and we intended to do so again
this term. However, on March 28, 1991, a decision was reached in the U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of New York which limits the ability of commercial
establishments to provide multiple copies of classroom materials for educational use.
This court decision limits the ability of all establishments, not just Kinko's, to provide
course materials.
First and foremost, Kinko's has no intention of discontinuing the Professor Publishing
program. Although we are disappointed by the decision, we are 100% committed to
complying with the court's decision. Vi e have already begun to alter our systems to ensure
compliance with these new guidelines.
The timing of the decision means some class materials will not be available in a
timely manner for this term. Kinko's is striving to ensure that this delay will not recur.
Kinko's is the only company in our industry positioned to comply with the new guidelines.
Kinko's has established relationships with over 100 publishers nationwide to reproduce
copyrighted materials and continues to add publishers to this list.
We are working closely with educators and publishers to make your materials available
as quickly as possible. Our absolute goal is to support you in every way we can. We
appreciate your patience and support during this difficult time.
