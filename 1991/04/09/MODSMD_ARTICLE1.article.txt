### Marli Marinelli Staff writer 
When Peter Arnett
reported that allied war
planes had bombed an Iraqi
powdered-milk factory dur
ing the Gulf war, the Pen
tagon accused him of being
"duped." The plant pro
duced biological weapons,
U.S. officials said.
Last night, before an
overflow crowd at Kresge
Auditorium, the Cable News
Network Baghdad corre
spondent held up a plastic
bag filled with white powder
he had collected at the fac
tory.
"If you believe my story,
you'll join me for coffee
later. We can use this as a
creamer, which will show
you that I figure this is just
baby milk," Arnett said.
The anecdote was one of
several Arnett used to
defend his coverage and
recount his experiences off
camera as the only Western
journalist to report from
Baghdad for the entire war.
Because the material he
broadcasted was subject to
Iraqi censorship, Arnett was
criticized by some for being
an accomplice in Saddam
Hussein's propaganda cam
paign. He quoted a colum
nist who called him "the
incarnation of evil, as dan
gerous as Dracula."
"Most of the world and
their governments had
decided that Saddam Hus
sein should be forcibly
removed from Kuwait,"
Arnett said. "I felt we had
the responsibility to cover
implementation of the
results as widely as possible
— that's including watching
bombs fall in Baghdad and
telling where they hit."
Arnett was particularly
criticized for an interview he

conducted with the Iraqi presi
dent. But from the perspective of
CNN, he said, "anything from
that man is important and could

have possibly altered his position,
as it was only two weeks into the
war and there was no ground
war."
Asked by an audience member
where to draw the line between
the public's right to war coverage
and military security, Arnett said
that if the coverage would com
promise military security, the
information would not he
reported. "The line is very clear. .
. . We have no desire to endanger
lives of Americans or anyone. We
have to be careful about security,
and we are. The record shows

that."
In addition, he said he tried to
overcome the Iraqi censorship in
whatever ways he could without
endangering his welcome in the
country. He threatened on several
occasions to leave the country if
Iraqi censors didn't "meet me
halfway" on what information he
could report. And he took advan
tage of question-and-answer ses
sions with CNN anchors —
exchanges over which Iraqi cen
sors had little control.
On one occasion, a tongue-tied
anchor broadcasting live asked

Arnett what the weather was like
in Baghdad. "I answered, 'It's
overcast, so there's been no
bombing today,'" Arnett said.
Though he found Iraqi censors
"reasonably accommodating,"
Arnett said he didn't push his
luck in dealing with them. "When
I bent rules, I didn't go too far
with information that would have
the Iraqi military at my throat."
Arnett emphasized the impor
tance of obeying the rules
imposed on the journalists by the
Iraqi government. "We have to
play by the rules in times of con
flict or it could end your life. You
don't want to throw your life
away." As for his method in coun
tering fear when covering war
crises, Arnett said, "I always
weigh the risk against the jour
nalistic opportunity. . . . The fact
that I was broadcasting to the
world made it easier."
Humorous incidents broke the
tension, as well.
An hour after his interview
with Saddam, for example, he
received black-and-white pho
tographs of the meeting from the
Iraqi government, in keeping
with a personal custom of the
Iraqi president. "One hour later,
in a city at war with no electricity.
He is a man of great tradition,"
Arnett said.
On the air, Arnett frequently
wore a jacket with $100,000 sewn
in its lining to cover expenses
while in Baghdad. "Do you want
to know where it is, or some
thing? I wore it on the air almost
every day, which is why I looked
so scruffy. . . . I'll tell you what I
told my accountant: It's all been
spent, sorry."
Arnett began his speech by
mimicking the meticulous detail
he had to implement in the cover
age of Operation Desert Storm.
"Folks, this is water," Arnett jok
ingly explained before he sipped
from the glass.
When asked to speculate on
other countries that were likely to
be involved in future crises,
Arnett jokingly replied, "If I tell
you that, ABC will be there first."
