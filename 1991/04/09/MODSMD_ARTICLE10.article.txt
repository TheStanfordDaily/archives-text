Democratic budget completed
WASHINGTON (AP) — The chairman of
the House Budget Committee yesterday put
the final touches on a Democratic fiscal 1992
budget that makes no tax changes and is more
generous to education, community develop
ment and other social programs than President
Bush would like.
Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., planned
to submit the spending plan to his Democrat
dominated committee for votes today as out
numbered Republicans promised their
opposition. With the two-week Easter recess
over, the budget committee's work was just one
front on which Democrats prepared to begin
pushing their domestic agenda through
Congress.
When legislators resume work today, Senate
committees will be working on separate bills
attacking illiteracy and health-care costs.
RU 486 linked to user's death
PARIS (AP) — The Health Ministry
announced yesterday the first death of a
woman under treatment with the controversial
French abortion pill known as RU 486. Offi
cials ordered an investigation.
The disclosure comes days after New York
Mayor David Dinkins launched a campaign in
the United States to lift a ban that prohibits
testing the pill, Pro-life activists strongly
oppose the pill.
French officials believe the death resulted
from a synthetic prostaglandin called Nalador,
administered in conjunction with the pill.
Health Ministry officials were to meet
tomorrow to begin a study of the relationship
between the two drugs.
Prostaglandin is one of the hormonelike
fatty acids found in the body that affect blood
pressure, body temperature and other impor
tant body processes.
Panamanian president removes
Christian Democrats from cabinet
PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) — President
Guillermo Endara ousted all the Christian
Democrats from his coalition Cabinet yester
day and said he would govern without the
party, the country's largest.
Endara's replacement of six of his 12 Cabi
net ministers shattered theTour-party coalition
that chose Endara as its candidate against dic
tator Manuel Antonio Noriega in May 1989
elections.
Noriega annulled the elections, which he
apparently lost. Endara was installed in power
after the December 1989 U.S. invasion that
overthrew Noriega.
