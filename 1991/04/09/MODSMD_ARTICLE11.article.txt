### 
IN NORTHERN IRAQ (AP) - A Kurdish rebel
leader yesterday accused the Iraqi government of
massacring the entire population of a village in order
to terrorize Kurds into fleeing Iraq.
The leader, Masoud Barzani, said 2,000 to 3,000
people were killed in Kara Henjir, a village near the
northern oil center of Kirkuk, as part of the govern
ment offensive to recapture rebel-held Kurdish terri
tory.
"We still don't know the exact number" of dead in
the attack, said Barzani, leader of the Kurdistan
Democratic Party. The report could not be indepen
dently confirmed.
"This was a deliberate move to terrorize the rest
of the people into fleeing the country," Barzani said
of the reported killings.
Hundreds of thousands of Kurdish civilians, fear
ing government reprisals for the Kurdish uprising
against Saddam Hussein, have fled into the moun
tains bordering Iran and Turkey.
Some are making their way across, but many are
trapped on the Iraqi side of the frontiers.
As Barzani spoke to reporters in the mountains
north of the Gali Ali Beg gorge, about 30 miles north
east of Erbil, thousands in the region were abandon
ing their homes, beginning a trek toward Iran.
The exodus came amid reports that the Iraqi army
was approaching the rebel-held Erbil region.
Until now, residents had felt relatively safe.
Throughout the rebels' long history of rebellion
against the government, the Erbil region had been a
stronghold of the Pesh Merga guerrillas.
In the still of night in the mountaintop town of
Rawandiz, scores of men, women and children began
the arduous 30-mile journey to the Iranian border.
Rebel officials told them there was no cause for
fear, but people were so terrified by word that gov
ernment troops might be drawing near that they set
off barefoot in the night.
In all, more than a quarter-million Kurds were
winding their way through the Haj Omran pass to
try to cross into Iran.
