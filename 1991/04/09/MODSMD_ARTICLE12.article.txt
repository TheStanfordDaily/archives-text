# U.N. leader wants permanent cease-fire declared
## 
### 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) - The
Security Council's president yesterday
recommended an official declaration of
cease-fire in the Gulf war, saying Iraq
had accepted all the council's condi
tions for a permanent peace.
The president, Belgian Ambassador
Paul Noterdaeme, drafted a letter to
Iraq yesterday noting receipt of a 23-
page Iraqi communique accepting the
cease-fire terms.
A council vote on declaring an offi
cial cease-fire is expected today, a U.S.
diplomat said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. A council is also expected
to vote today on establishing a 1,440-
strong U.N. peacekeeping force on the

Iraq-Kuwait border.
The council's cease-fire resolution,
passed last Wednesday, included
demands for the destruction of Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction and pay
ment of war damages. It set a 120-day
timetable for taking steps to destroy
the arms, including chemical and bio
logical weapons.
Iraq's response, submitted to the
United Nations on Saturday, com
plains at great length about the "iniq
uitous" resolution, calling it a U.S.-
Israeli plot. But it concludes by saying
Baghdad "has no choice but to accept
this resolution."
Noterdaeme's draft for a reply tells

the Iraqis their letter "contains official
notification of the acceptance by Iraq,
without any specific conditions" of the
council's conditions for a truce.
The letter continues that "the con
ditions . . . have now been met and
that the formal cease-fire ... is there
fore now effective."
A Western diplomat, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said Iraqi
Ambassador Abdul Amir al-Anbari had
assured Noterdaeme that, despite its
grumbling, Iraq's agreement was irre
vocable and unconditional.
The council also discussed yester
day further steps to protect Iraq's Kur
dish minority, whose rebellion against

Saddam Hussein was crushed by the
Iraqi army. Hundreds of thousands of
Kurds have fled to Turkey and Iran.
In Luxembourg, European Commu
nity leaders Monday endorsed a pro
posal for a U.N.-monitored safety zone
for Kurds.
The idea was first raised by Turkish
President Turgut Ozal, and proposed
at the EC meeting by British Prime
Minister John Major. Turkey is not a
member of the 16-nation EC.
Major suggested "an enclave under
U.N. protection that would provide
shelter and housing to Kurds until it is
safe for them to return to their own
homes."
