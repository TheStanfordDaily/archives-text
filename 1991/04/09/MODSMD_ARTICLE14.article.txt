# Coal miners reject Gorbachev offer
## 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) - Despite
Mikhail Gorbachev's offer to dou
ble their wages, Soviet coal miners
refused to return to work yester
day and insisted on the presi
dent's resignation.
The five-week-old walkout by
an estimated 300,000 of the
nation's 1.2 million coal miners
has been joined in recent days by
thousands of workers at more
than 50 factories across the coun
try, and general strikes are threat
ened in the republics of Georgia
and Byelorussia.
The growing labor unrest,
exacerbated by drastic price
increases, has the potential to
cripple the Soviet economy. Rut
Gorbachev, whose term in office
runs until 1995, has steadfastly
refused to step down.
Coal miners earn an average of
$664 a month, about 40 percent
more than the national norm.
Last week, Prime Minister
Valentin Pavlov offered to double
their wages over the next year, if
production rises.
Strike leaders across the coun
try told The Associated Press in
telephone interviews Sunday they
were rejecting the government's
offer because the wage increases
would quickly be swallowed up by

inflation. The prices of most con
sumer items, including food and
clothing, doubled and tripled on
April 2.
"They say they're making a big
concession to us, but it's the kind
of concession that won't mean
anything at all, 1 am absolutely
sure, in two or three months,"
said Vitaly Dubrov, a miner in the
Artie city of Vorkuta.
The Coordinating Council of
Strike Committees, meeting in
Moscow, called yesterday for a
national indexing system to boost
the wages of all workers to com
pensate for inflation, said Alexan
der Sergeyev, vice president of the
Independent Union of Miners.
Sergeyev said the council also
reiterated its four main political
demands: Gorbachev's resigna
tion; dissolution of the Commu
ni.c .-dominated Congress of Peo
ple's Deputies; resignation of the
entire Cabinet of Ministers; and
transfer of power to a Federation
Council made up of representa
tives of the 15 Soviet republics.
The government's wage offer
was debated over the weekend by
strikers across the nation. In a
few areas, such as the Inta coal pit
in the Pechora region of northern
Russia, they favored the offer and

voted Sunday to go back to work,
according to the state news agency
Tass.
However, strikers in the
nation's largest coal-producing
area, the Donetsk Basin of the
Ukraine, decided to fight "to a vic
torious conclusion," said Pravda,
the Communist Party daily.
Forty-eight automobile facto
ries, an ore enriching plant and
other enterprises in the Kuznetsk
area were on strike yesterday in
solidarity with the miners, accord
ing to Sergeyev. In addition, two
automobile plants and an oil dis
tillery in the Donetsk area joined
the walkout, he said.
Three industrial plants in
Minsk, the capital of Byelorussia,
went back to work yesterday after
the republic promised to cut
prices on children's clothes, elimi
nate a 5 percent tax on local food
products, reduce prices in cafete
rias and make other economic
concessions.
However, labor leaders in
Minsk threatened to call a general
strike on Thursday unless their
political demands — including the
resignation of Gorbachev and the
national and Byelorussian govern
ments — are met, Soviet media
reported.
