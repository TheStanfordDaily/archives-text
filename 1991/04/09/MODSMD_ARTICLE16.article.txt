The recent campaign
practices of the People's Plat
form are ethically suspect.
The Pocket Discount Card, previ
ously sold by the ASSU, was freely
distributed to students last week.
It was attached to a flier which
read, "courtesy of the ASSU COR"
Additionally, the Council of Presi
dents announced that the annual
State of the Association speech will
be given publicly for the first time
this Tuesday.
The official ASSU campaign
does not begin until Wednesday,
and all parties have been prohibit
ed from eliciting support before
that date. Under the guise of the
Pocket Discount Card, the People's
Platform was able to skirt the
rules. The clear enunciation that
the card came from the present
COP was printed in order to subli
mate the message that the People's
Platform is working for students
and will continue to do the same in
the future if re-elected.
Students should be kept abreast

of the state of the ASSU, and in this
sense the decision to publicly deliv
er the address is welcome. Howev
er, the speech will undoubtedly be
political in nature; the COP will
stress those issues which they feel
are at the heart of the party's pre
sent campaign. The political rami
fications of the address make it
imperative that the opposition par
ties be given the right to follow
with their own responses. The
democrats publicly respond to the
State of the Union after it is deliv
ered by a republican president, and
there is no reason why the COP
opposition shouldn't have the same
right.
These recent actions by the COP
are hypocritical. They are repre
sentative of an attempt on the part
of the People's Platform to utilize
their incumbency as a means of
securing campaign privileges.
The People's Platform is abiding
by the letter of law, but is using its
position in the ASSU to circumvent
the spirit of the law.
