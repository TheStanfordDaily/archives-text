approach, the ASSU should
take advantage of the oppor
tunity to learn more about the stu
dents it serves. By putting ques
tions about key issues on the ballot,
the ASSU would go a long way
toward showing itself to be a repre
sentative government.
For example, the ballot could
contain questions on whether to
keep the salaries of each Council of
Presidents member at $5,000, or to
raise or lower it.
Students could also register
their opinions on the current sys
tem of 20 voting and 20 non-voting
senators, which some have said
encourages inefficiency and absen
teeism.
Students should also be able to

vote on whether to keep the new
fee refund system, which some
think is unnecessarily bureaucrat
ic.
Another issue the ballot could
address is whether the University
should allow any fraternities to
build houses on campus.
Finally, the ballot should defi
nitely have some open-ended ques
tions such as "What student ser
vices would you like to see?" or
"What issues would you like the
ASSU to address?"
Although interpreting the ques
tions would require extra effort on
the part of our representatives, it
would also enable those in office to
address student concerns more
successfully and allow the newly
elected to adjust their platform
