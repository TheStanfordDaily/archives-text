## The 						message to kill 
### 
About 10 days ago, Israeli
troops killed three young men, aged
20, 15 and 12, who were entering
the West Bank from Jordan. The three
carried no papers and were armed with
one knife. According to an Israeli army
spokesman, the soldiers who killed the
men were following standard instructions
for apprehending suspects.
This event is a good (but sad) example
of Israeli government policies that exacer
bate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Ignoring for the moment the fact that the
occupation of the West Bank is illegal to
begin with, one has to wonder how a
"routine" apprehension of three youths
carrying a single knife could lead to their
deaths.
At worst, one of them may have bran
dished the knife when approached by the
soldiers. That hardly justifies shooting to
kill. The other two were unarmed; yet
they were killed too. I find it disgusting
that the army is able, with a straight face,
to label the incident a "violent infiltra
tion" into the area.
In another recent case, Taher Shriteh,
a journalist from the Gaza Strip, was held
in jail for several weeks without a formal
charge, and apparently was also tortured.
His crime was having reported to Reuters
(a British news agency), hardly a bulwark
of anti-Israeli agitation, about leaflets
distributed by an Islamic fundamentalist
group.
Since the Palestinian uprising started,
dozens of other Palestinian reporters
have been jailed (also without formal
charges) for similar reasons, but since
Shriteh reports for well-known interna

tional news organizations, he was at least
granted a public bail hearing after three
weeks.
Bail was denied (as is the rule in such
cases). In what seems to be an implicit
admission of torture, the prosecutor
explained, "I know he faces very difficult
conditions in prison, [but if he is held
longer, perhaps] he will tell us more
things." Many Israeli newspapers, and
even the government itself, regularly
report on those same leaflets about the
uprising, yet Shriteh's behavior was
deemed to warrant imprisonment.
Apparently, many Israeli officials are
so possessed by the idea that they are
encircled by hostile forces that anything a
Palestinian does other than docilely com
plying with their rules and meekly obey
ing their soldiers is grounds for removal
from society. In the first three years of the
Intifada, 800 Palestinians have been
killed by Israelis. Today, Palestinians not
only must fear Israeli soldiers, but also
civilians, who have been exhorted by their
police minister to kill any Palestinian sus
pected of planning to attack an Israeli.
It is incredible that a so-called "civi
lized" state can send such a message to its
people without arousing much contro
versy, either at home or abroad. Every
Israeli has now been officially urged to
become an armed vigilante, and every
Palestinian carrying a knife becomes an
acceptable murder victim, guilty by
assumption, and unlikely to survive long
enough to argue his innocence.
Israel is undeniably faced with some
very hostile and unpleasant neighbors.
Moreover, the Israeli government is cor

rect in claiming that many would like to
see Israel wiped off the face of the earth,
and that some terrorists are actively try
ing to achieve that goal by any means.
However: the policies of this govern
ment — total curfews, deportations,
demolitions of homes, arbitrary imprison
ment and now, armed vigilantism — add
relatively little to the security of the
Israeli state and its citizens. They do
incite hatred among those subject to such
measures. It is almost less surprising that
some Palestinians attack Jewish civilians
than that so few of them become crazy
enough to do so.
Humane policies and a willingness to
negotiate in good faith would likely go a
lot farther towards ensuring peace, but
Yitzchak Shamir's government has stead
fastly rejected this approach, underlining
his moral bankruptcy. And as long as
other governments continue to support
this man, they don't deserve much praise
either.
