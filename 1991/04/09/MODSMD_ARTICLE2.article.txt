# CNN's man in Baghdad fires back at his critics
## 
### Mike Laris Editorial staff 
When the Gulf war ended and Peter
Arnett left Baghdad last month, he
walked into a new battle — against his
critics.
As Cable News Network's Baghdad
correspondent, Arnett was the only
Western reporter to stay in the Iraqi
capital for the duration of the war. His

daily coverage from the enemy capital
has been criticized by top public and
military officials, including White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater,
Senator Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., and
allied commander Gen. Norman
Schwartzkopf.
Yesterday, in an interview with The
Daily, Arnett shot back at
SchwartzkopfB criticism of his cover
age. ,

Schwartzkopf said in an interview
last month with Public Broadcasting
Service's David Frost that he was
angered by CNN's portrayal of a bomb
ing in which hundreds of civilians were
killed. The Pentagon has said it targeted
the building as a military asset.
But the general said the CNN report
gave the impression that the allies had
deliberately bombed a civilian
shelter and did not take into con
sideration allied attempts to keep
civilian deaths to a minimum.
Arnett said, "I did give the
impression it was done deliber
ately, because the shelter was hit
deliberately.
"You can argue over what the
shelter contained. Was it a mili
tary communication center? Was
Saddam Hussein visiting there at
times?" he said. But after witness
ing the scene a couple of hours
after the bombing, Arnett was
struck by the large loss of civilian
life. "It's not easy to justify the
loss of civilian life.
"And if General Schwartzkopf
was embarrassed by seeing that
on CNN, it's just too bad, because
the shelter was targeted."
He said the scene at the
bombed complex was the most
traumatic he saw throughout his
months in Baghdad. He recalled
seeing "melted bodies of men,
women and children on the floor
in the searing heat. And there was
total chaos and death. It was
frightening to see the kind of
power technological warfare can
deliver."
Arnett said the number of civil
ian casualties, which he placed at
"several thousand," would have
been greater had the allies been
"more aggressive and less . . . con
trolled."
He also said he feared congres
sional restrictions on the media.
"I've heard there's legislation
being presented or suggested in
Congress that would prevent me
or anyone else from covering the
other side in a conflict," he said. "I
am concerned they will attempt to
legislate controls."
He said that sources have told
him such legislation may be intro
duced but that this has not been
confirmed. Such legislation would
clearly violate the First Amend
ment's prohibition against
Congress restricting the press, he
added.
"We must remember that while
I was criticized for being in Bagh
dad, I was not pulled out of Bagh
dad. . . . And even though Sen.
Simpson and Gen. Schwartzkopf

said they didn't like what they
saw, we showed it," Arnett said.
"I think that in a future situa
tion, though, the White House,
the government, the Pentagon,
will remember that CNN was able
to go to the enemy capital and
report.
"And maybe they'll be inter
ested in restricting us, to some
degree, when the next go around
comes around," he said.
Arnett also said CNN might
have to become embroiled in a
legal battle that could go as far as
the Supreme Court to protect the
network's rights to broadcast
from war zones. Although a coali
tion of alternative media organi
zations has brought suit against
the Pentagon's press restrictions
on overseas war reporting, most
major news organizations have
thus far stayed out of the legal
fray.
"Ultimately there will be a
legal confrontation, presumably,
and maybe it will go to the
Supreme Court to better establish
the press role in international
conflicts," said Arnett. "As CNN
grows bigger, and we get more
interested in enlarging our role
overseas, maybe we'll have to go
to court to really get legal backing
to do what we hope to do in future
coverage."
Steve Korn, vice president/gen
eral counsel of Turner Broadcast
ing System, said the scenario was
too speculative for comment. But
he said he has no knowledge of
"any such proposals or bills kick
ing around" in Congress. He
added, "We would obviously make
our position clear that we'd like
full enjoyment of the First
Amendment."
Arnett, who won the Pulitzer
Prize in 1966 for his reporting
during the Vietnam War, gradu
ated from Waitaki College in New
Zealand. A book about reporting
from Baghdad may be in the
works, Arnett said.
After covering 17 wars, Arnett
speaks about war with a cool,
experienced tone. Describing his
time in Baghdad, Arnett said he
has learned to repress fear so he
can cover war accurately and
fairly. Showing the tinge of cocki
ness of someone who has risked
his life to cover combat, Arnett
said he would be more fearful of a

knife-wielding mugger in New
York than he would be in a war
zone.
Arnett said that whether he
has become famous or infamous
from his Gulf reporting is irrele
vant. Either way he will continue
reporting the truth as he sees it in
international conflicts around the
world. He said he will use the con
troversy surrounding his report
ing from Baghdad as a launching
point for discussing the future of
press restrictions in war.
He warned that the rosy out
come of the war for the allies
serves to de-emphasize the mas
sive apparatus set up by the Pen
tagon to control unflattering
news.
"They wanted to restrict the
flow of bad news, or delay bad
news, hoping it would deaden the
impact of such news on the pub
lic," he said. Pentagon media reg

illations that require reporters in
the field to be accompanied by
military escorts in "pools" and to
submit their reports for censor
ship did not appear sinister
because much of the news in the
Gulf was good news, he added.
But, he said, "these restric
tions were in place to accommo
date controlled information deal
ing with 10,000 to 15,000 dead."
In this war, he said, the restric
tions were "overkill," but if there
had been significantly more
American deaths, the American
people would not have had com
plete information.
Arnett said the White House,
not only the Pentagon, attempted
to restrict coverage. He said Pres
ident Bush telephoned CNN Pres
ident Tom Johnson and asked
him to pull Arnett and others
from CNN out of Baghdad.

Speaking at Kresge Auditorium last night, Peter Arnett shows off an
American flag sent to him by a fan. A standing-room-only crowd of
over 800 people came to hear the CNN correspondent discuss his
experiences covering the Persian Gulf war.
