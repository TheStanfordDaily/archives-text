## 'Ski Team' crash diet poses numerous health risks 
### 
OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS,
The Daily has been carrying an
advertisement for the U.S.
Women's Ski Team Diet. The ad reads,
"U.S. Women's Ski Team Diet — Lose 20
pounds in two weeks." We have had sev
eral people ask our opinion of the diet, so
we sent for it, analyzed it and would like
to share our professional evaluation of
this particular diet and other quick
weight-loss schemes.
The information consists of a two
week food plan which includes four to six
eggs daily, meat, fruit, vegetables, coffee
and tea. One slice of bread is allowed two
times per week. Our analysis of this diet
shows it to be low in the following nutri
ents: fiber, several B vitamins, calcium
and other minerals. Additionally, it is
high in cholesterol and fat. The composi
tion of this diet — very low calorie, low
carbohydrate, high protein, high fat — is
nothing new and the physiological prob
lems associated with low-carbohydrate
weight-loss diets are well documented:

• The quick weight loss is water, not
fat; therefore, weight is quickly regained
and, upon return to the usual diet, many
people experience edema (water reten
tion);
• The dieter may experience fatigue,
headaches and dizziness; and
• There is a loss of muscle protein.
While the short-term effect of very
low-calorie and low-carbohydrate diets is
weight loss (mostly water and protein),
the longer term consequences are a low
ered metabolic rate, an increase in body
fat and a tendency to binge. The psycho
logical effects of these types of diet can
be devastating as well. The perception of
individual failure with each weight-loss
attempt, and the belief that thin is better
and more virtuous causes many people
(especially women) to experience lowered
self-esteem and shame if they can't lose
weight and keep it off.
Surprisingly, there is no mention of
the importance of regular exercise in this
diet. Researchers unanimously agree

that weight loss cannot be successful in
the long term without regular exercise.
The weight-loss business is a $35 bil
lion a year industry and it continues to
grow because there are no easy quick
weight-loss solutions, yet people want to
believe that it can be done. While there
are some people whose health would ben
efit from weight loss, the majority of
these weight-loss customers are women
trying to attain a cultural norm that is
unattainable and undesirable. The
effects of chronic dieting are more of a
physical and psychological health risk
than are a few extra pounds.
For those who want help in sorting
out these issues — weight loss, chronic
dieting or food obsession — there are
several resources available on campus
for students and staff:
Cowell Health Promotion Program
Nutrition Services: Alice Bender and
Laura Brainin-Rodriguez are available
for free individual counseling to students

and athletes and for educational presen
tations.
Body Image, Food and Self-Esteem
(the Bridge): A student-run group offer
ing informal drop-in discussion group
and dorm presentations.
Counseling and Psychological Ser
vices, Cowell Student Health Center:
Offers free counseling to students with
eating disorders and related concerns.
Overeater Anonymous (the Bridge):
Support group, modeled after Alcoholics
Anonymous.
Health Improvement Program (HIP)
for staff: Offers low-cost classes on
weight management, nutrition, exercise.
We do not wish to single out this diet
as any worse than other diets; it is repre
sentative of many similar approaches to
weight control that we believe are not
effective.
