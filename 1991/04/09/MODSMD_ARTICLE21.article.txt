# Recommendations of task force should be target of fund raising
## 
### 
I was glad to read in your paper about
the $7 million teaching initiative. This is
surely a step in the right direction. At
the same time, however, I am puzzled
when I place this announcement side-by
side with your recent report that though
the recommendations of the Sexual
Assault Task Force were deemed valu
able, they will not be implemented
because of lack of funds.
The report of the task force dealt with
fundamental issues concerning how
women should be regarded and treated
on this campus. This is a vital part of the

general task of determining how we as
human beings should act towards and
interact with other human beings.
It seems to me fundamental, and
prior to the next question: Given that we
understand what it is to treat each other
with care and respect, how can we facili
tate effective teaching and learning? If
we make no headway with the more fun
damental, will we really make headway
with the problem that is in some ways
derivative from the more basic?
I would like to urge the administra
tion either to pare down a bit the money
designed for teaching improvement and
spend it on recommendations by the task
force, or at least to hold up the teaching
improvement project until the same
efforts that obviously went into finding
money for that bear fruit once more and
come up with some of the funds
requested by the group that examined

sexual assault and the larger question
surrounding that matter.
