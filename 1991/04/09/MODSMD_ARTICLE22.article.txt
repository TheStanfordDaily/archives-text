# University president also needs to uphold Honor Code standards
## 
### 
The Honor Code is one of my most
cherished memories of Stanford. The
idea that I was trusted to take a tough
exam in the library or even in my own
room — and not cheat — was a charac
ter-forming experience for me. I was
thrilled to believe that being honorable
was more important than my final grade
I felt honored to be part of such a

school and I honored Stanford for teach
ing me the honor of being a "Stanford
Woman."
Now I have received a disingenuous
letter from President Kennedy explain
ing how creaming off funds for private
purposes is not as important as the goal
of research, for the national interest.
Only someone with a lot less brains
than it takes to get through Stanford
could believe such specious nonsense.
I care a lot less for research than I
care for the characters of the young men
and women of Stanford who are shamed
and shadowed by this scandal and this
explanation.
To restore Stanford's honor, the only
honorable thing, I believe, is for the pres
ident to admit his failure as a leader —
and resign.
