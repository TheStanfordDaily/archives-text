## Chemistry students face lazy teaching, dangerous lab conditions 
### 
AS A PREMEDICAL STUDENT AT
Stanford, I have taken several
chemistry courses. All of them
have been traumatic experiences. I write
to express my extreme dissatisfaction
with Stanford's undergraduate Depart
ment of Chemistry.
Let me assert that this letter is not
the work of a disgruntled individual who
resents a class because she did not do
well in it; 1 did in fact do well in all these
courses (eventually). Furthermore, this
letter represents not just my own views,
hut also those of many other people with
whom I have spoken.
I have taken Chemistry 31, 36 and
130 one time each and Chemistry 33 and
35 twice each at Stanford. I have also
taken the equivalent of Chemistry 33 at
IJC-Davis. My experience with the
Chemistry Department here has con
vinced me that all of its introductory
classes suffer from the same general
problems with teaching and teaching
assistants, and that the laboratory
courses also have problems.
To begin with, the majority of the pro
fessors of these classes are disorganized
and/or lecture in an uninspired manner.
Introductory inorganic and organic
chemistry are not inherently boring sub
jects, as I discovered in the excellent
class I took at UC-Davis, yet perhaps

because they are difficult conceptually
and are "merely" introductory, they are
taught in a boring manner.
One partial solution to this problem
would be to reward good teaching, as
such teaching is perceived by the stu
dents. The department could sponsor a
contest, for example, in which students
would vote for the best teacher in the
premedical/introductory chemistry
classes (Chemistry 31, 33, 35, 36; Chem
istry 130, 131 and 135) they had taken.
Another problem with these classes is
the poor quality of the sections. The
department's tacit rule against accepting
Stanford undergraduates into its gradu
ate program in chemistry means that
most of the TAs for the introductory
courses are unfamiliar with the format
of the classes. The net result is that
many of the TAs for any given class in
the premedical sequence will have nei
ther taken nor taught that class before.
Unfortunately for the students, many
of the TAs do not go to the trouble of
reviewing the material or even attending
lectures. Finally, the TAs often have
inconvenient office hours — one of my
TAs had his office hours during the class
meeting time until the class schedule
was called to his attention — or do not
show up when their office hours are
scheduled.

Several solutions are apparent. Good
"TAing" should be encouraged through
contests similar to the ones sponsored by
the Physics Department. They recognize
the best TAs in the introductory physics
sequence, as nominated by students.
TAs should also have to go through
brief but thorough training sessions
before they begin teaching sections for a
class. They should be familiarized with
the course content, the syllabus and the
dates of the tests, at the very minimum.
If they are TAs for a lab class, they
should be asked to know the layout of
the labs, the locations of common
reagents and the whereabouts of fire
extinguishers and eyewashes. I know of
one chemistry section in which a fire
occurred that the TA could not put out
because she could not find the extin
guisher. A neighboring TA had to rush to
her aid.
The TAs should also be required to
attend at least one class meeting per
week, so that they can keep abreast of
the professor's teaching style and can
better answer students' questions about
what was said in class. Finally, they
should be asked to have more office
hours per week. The Chemistry Depart
ment should arrange for the Chemistry
Resource Center to be staffed continu
ously during the day and early evening,

like the Reference Frame is in the
Physics Department.
The laboratories and lab conditions
pose yet another set of problems. Chem
istry 36 and Chemistry 130 were the two
most harrowing classes I have ever
taken. Students are required to work
with dangerous chemicals beginning
with the first lab period, even though
they are often unfamiliar with all tech
niques and safety precautions. In addi
tion, many of these chemicals are labeled
illegibly or incompletely, so that it is not
clear if they are hazardous or not.
An additional problem is the incredi
ble tension created by the competition
for grades and the strictly enforced time
limits. The enormous pressure created
by these two factors leads to carelessness
with chemicals, the temptation to take
dangerous shortcuts in experiments and
to not report mishaps or errors, an
unwillingness to help labmates, and a
tendency to follow a chemical "recipe"
unthinkingly without learning and
understanding the material presented in
the course.
A few changes would improve the lab
atmosphere immeasurably. The labs
need to be tidied up — the bottles rela
beled clearly (with any warnings that
would be appropriate), broken equip
ment (thermometers, MelTemps, clamps,

etc.) replaced and so on. The change
most desperately needed is to make the
labs mandatory pass/no credit, as the
physics and biology labs currently are.
To combat the problems with teach
ing, TAs and laboratory conditions in th«
introductory chemistry classes here at
Stanford, I feel that the changes dis
cussed above should be implemented.
Here is a summary of my suggestions:
• Reward professors for good teach
ing, as judged by students;
• Reward TAs for good teaching, as
perceived by students;
• Have training sessions for TAs;
• Require TAs to attend class;
• Require TAs to have more office
hours every week;
• Staff the CRC with TAs from 9 a.m.
to 9 p.m. every weekday;
• Make the labs safer; and
• Make the lab courses mandatory
pass/no credit.
I feel that making these improve
ments would result in a greater quality
of life for all premedical students, with
out negatively impacting the intellectual
difficulty of the courses at all. These
changes might also result in a greater
number of undergraduates choosing to
major in chemistry.

contest, for example, in which students
would vote for the best teacher in the
premedical/introductory chemistry
classes (Chemistry 31, 33, 35, 36; Chem
istry 130, 131 and 135) they had taken.
Another problem with these classes is
the poor quality of the sections. The
department's tacit rule against accepting
Stanford undergraduates into its gradu
ate program in chemistry means that
most of the TAs for the introductory
courses are unfamiliar with the format
of the classes. The net result is that
many of the TAs for any given class in
the premedical sequence will have nei
ther taken nor taught that class before.
Unfortunately for the students, many
of the TAs do not go to the trouble of
reviewing the material or even attending
lectures. Finally, the TAs often have
inconvenient office hours — one of my
TAs had his office hours during the class
meeting time until the class schedule
was called to his attention — or do not
show up when their office hours are
scheduled.

Several solutions are apparent. Good
"TAing" should be encouraged through
contests similar to the ones sponsored by
the Physics Department. They recognize
the best TAs in the introductory physics
sequence, as nominated by students.
TAs should also have to go through
brief but thorough training sessions
before they begin teaching sections for a
class. They should be familiarized with
the course content, the syllabus and the
dates of the tests, at the very minimum.
If they are TAs for a lab class, they
should be asked to know the layout of
the labs, the locations of common
reagents and the whereabouts of fire
extinguishers and eyewashes. I know of
one chemistry section in which a fire
occurred that the TA could not put out
because she could not find the extin
guisher. A neighboring TA had to rush to
her aid.
The TAs should also be required to
attend at least one class meeting per
week, so that they can keep abreast of
the professor's teaching style and can
better answer students' questions about
what was said in class. Finally, they
should be asked to have more office
hours per week. The Chemistry Depart
ment should arrange for the Chemistry
Resource Center to be staffed continu
ously during the day and early evening,

like the Reference Frame is in the
Physics Department.
The laboratories and lab conditions
pose yet another set of problems. Chem
istry 36 and Chemistry 130 were the two
most harrowing classes I have ever
taken. Students are required to work
with dangerous chemicals beginning
with the first lab period, even though
they are often unfamiliar with all tech
niques and safety precautions. In addi
tion, many of these chemicals are labeled
illegibly or incompletely, so that it is not
clear if they are hazardous or not.
An additional problem is the incredi
ble tension created by the competition
for grades and the strictly enforced time
limits. The enormous pressure created
by these two factors leads to carelessness
with chemicals, the temptation to take
dangerous shortcuts in experiments and
to not report mishaps or errors, an
unwillingness to help labmates, and a
tendency to follow a chemical "recipe"
unthinkingly without learning and
understanding the material presented in
the course.
A few changes would improve the lab
atmosphere immeasurably. The labs
need to be tidied up — the bottles rela
beled clearly (with any warnings that
would be appropriate), broken equip
ment (thermometers, MelTemps, clamps,

etc.) replaced and so on. The change
most desperately needed is to make the
labs mandatory pass/no credit, as the
physics and biology labs currently are.
To combat the problems with teach
ing, TAs and laboratory conditions in th«
introductory chemistry classes here at
Stanford, I feel that the changes dis
cussed above should be implemented.
Here is a summary of my suggestions:
• Reward professors for good teach
ing, as judged by students;
• Reward TAs for good teaching, as
perceived by students;
• Have training sessions for TAs;
• Require TAs to attend class;
• Require TAs to have more office
hours every week;
• Staff the CRC with TAs from 9 a.m.
to 9 p.m. every weekday;
• Make the labs safer; and
• Make the lab courses mandatory
pass/no credit.
I feel that making these improve
ments would result in a greater quality
of life for all premedical students, with
out negatively impacting the intellectual
difficulty of the courses at all. These
changes might also result in a greater
number of undergraduates choosing to
major in chemistry.

AS A PREMEDICAL STUDENT AT
Stanford, I have taken several
chemistry courses. All of them
have been traumatic experiences. I write
to express my extreme dissatisfaction
with Stanford's undergraduate Depart
ment of Chemistry.
Let me assert that this letter is not
the work of a disgruntled individual who
resents a class because she did not do
well in it; 1 did in fact do well in all these
courses (eventually). Furthermore, this
letter represents not just my own views,
hut also those of many other people with
whom I have spoken.
I have taken Chemistry 31, 36 and
130 one time each and Chemistry 33 and
35 twice each at Stanford. I have also
taken the equivalent of Chemistry 33 at
IJC-Davis. My experience with the
Chemistry Department here has con
vinced me that all of its introductory
classes suffer from the same general
problems with teaching and teaching
assistants, and that the laboratory
courses also have problems.
To begin with, the majority of the pro
fessors of these classes are disorganized
and/or lecture in an uninspired manner.
Introductory inorganic and organic
chemistry are not inherently boring sub
jects, as I discovered in the excellent
class I took at UC-Davis, yet perhaps

because they are difficult conceptually
and are "merely" introductory, they are
taught in a boring manner.
One partial solution to this problem
would be to reward good teaching, as
such teaching is perceived by the stu
dents. The department could sponsor a
contest, for example, in which students
would vote for the best teacher in the
premedical/introductory chemistry
classes (Chemistry 31, 33, 35, 36; Chem
istry 130, 131 and 135) they had taken.
Another problem with these classes is
the poor quality of the sections. The
department's tacit rule against accepting
Stanford undergraduates into its gradu
ate program in chemistry means that
most of the TAs for the introductory
courses are unfamiliar with the format
of the classes. The net result is that
many of the TAs for any given class in
the premedical sequence will have nei
ther taken nor taught that class before.

of the TAs do not go to the trouble of

show up when their office hours are
