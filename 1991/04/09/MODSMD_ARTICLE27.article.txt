## Tallman, Burnett slam Cal as Stanford wins again 
### David Schwartz Staff writer 
Let's play one.
One inning, that is.
The top of the first was all the Cardinal
needed yesterday as the team exploded for
eight runs against befuddled California
pitching to topple the Golden Bears 15-7 in
Berkeley.
The Cardinal left no doubt that it is on a
mission for the Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division championship. Coming
off a three-game sweep of USC this past
weekend, Stanford used that momentum to
dominate Cal from the get-go. Bear starting
pitcher Nate Brown made an early exit
from the field at Evans Diamond after
walking the first four batters he faced, giv
ing up one unearned run.
Chad Konishi fared no better against the
Cardinal hitters. Ryan Turner slapped a
base hit to left field to score Chris Kemper,
and Steve Solomon singled to center to
score David McCarty and Jeffrey Ham
monds. Konishi then proceeded to load the
bases again by walking Roger Burnett, and
Troy Tallman made him pay for it.
The junior catcher cranked a grand slam
to left field on a 3-2 pitch for his fifth career
home run against Cal. The next three Car
dinal batters were retired, but no matter.
The damage was done. Stanford chalked up
eight runs on only three hits to take a com
manding lead with still 8 1/2 innings to play.
"I was exited obviously," said coach
Mark Marquess.
"They gave us some walks and a couple of
key hits. The grand slam by Troy Tallman

was really the key blast there. I was real
pleased because we scored eight runs with
out even having an out .. . [andJ that we
took advantage of the opportunity they
gave us."
Cardinal pitcher John Reid, coming off
of only two days rest after pitching four
innings against USC Friday, got the Bears
out in the bottom half of the first inning
rather easily, having to face only four Cal
batters. Stanford added one run in the top
of the second inning as new Bear pitcher
Derek Dowd walked two batters and threw
a wild pitch.
In the bottom half of the inning, sopho
more right fielder Matt Luke tried to get
Cal on the right track. The Six-Pac's lead
ing hitter with a .472 average homered to
left field. Mike Harrison took Luke's exam
ple to hit a double into center field. Reid
Neumann promptly doubled Harrison
home, and scored after moving a base each
time after two consecutive pop outs. The
Bears finished the inning with three runs
to only trail by six.
But Cal's faint hopes of competing in
this one ended in the third inning. David
Cornell started it off by grounding to short,
but he beat out the throw to first base.
David Holbrook then walked. Chris Kem
per followed with a routine fly ball to right,
which was muffed by Luke.
David McCarty grounded out to short,
allowing Cornell to score. Kemper moved to
second base on the play, and Jeffrey Ham
monds was then walked. That was it for
pitcher Derek Dowd.

Troy Tallman found success with the bunt against USC over the weekend, but had no need for such tactics in Berkeley
yesterday. His grand slam capped an eight-run first inning as Stanford won its fourth Six-Pac game in as many days, beat
ing California 15-7 at Evans Diamond.
