## Tallman, Burnett slam Cal as Stanford wins again 
### David Schwartz Staff writer 
Let's play one.
One inning, that is.
The top of the first was all the Cardinal
needed yesterday as the team exploded for
eight runs against befuddled California
pitching to topple the Golden Bears 15-7 in
Berkeley.
The Cardinal left no doubt that it is on a
mission for the Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division championship. Coming
off a three-game sweep of USC this past
weekend, Stanford used that momentum to
dominate Cal from the get-go. Bear starting
pitcher Nate Brown made an early exit
from the field at Evans Diamond after
walking the first four batters he faced, giv
ing up one unearned run.
Chad Konishi fared no better against the
Cardinal hitters. Ryan Turner slapped a
base hit to left field to score Chris Kemper,
and Steve Solomon singled to center to
score David McCarty and Jeffrey Ham
monds. Konishi then proceeded to load the
bases again by walking Roger Burnett, and
Troy Tallman made him pay for it.
The junior catcher cranked a grand slam
to left field on a 3-2 pitch for his fifth career
home run against Cal. The next three Car
dinal batters were retired, but no matter.
The damage was done. Stanford chalked up
eight runs on only three hits to take a com
manding lead with still 8 1/2 innings to play.
"I was exited obviously," said coach
Mark Marquess.
"They gave us some walks and a couple of
key hits. The grand slam by Troy Tallman

was really the key blast there. I was real
pleased because we scored eight runs with
out even having an out .. . [andJ that we
took advantage of the opportunity they
gave us."
Cardinal pitcher John Reid, coming off
of only two days rest after pitching four
innings against USC Friday, got the Bears
out in the bottom half of the first inning
rather easily, having to face only four Cal
batters. Stanford added one run in the top
of the second inning as new Bear pitcher
Derek Dowd walked two batters and threw
a wild pitch.
In the bottom half of the inning, sopho
more right fielder Matt Luke tried to get
Cal on the right track. The Six-Pac's lead
ing hitter with a .472 average homered to
left field. Mike Harrison took Luke's exam
ple to hit a double into center field. Reid
Neumann promptly doubled Harrison
home, and scored after moving a base each
time after two consecutive pop outs. The
Bears finished the inning with three runs
to only trail by six.
But Cal's faint hopes of competing in
this one ended in the third inning. David
Cornell started it off by grounding to short,
but he beat out the throw to first base.
David Holbrook then walked. Chris Kem
per followed with a routine fly ball to right,
which was muffed by Luke.
David McCarty grounded out to short,
allowing Cornell to score. Kemper moved to
second base on the play, and Jeffrey Ham
monds was then walked. That was it for
pitcher Derek Dowd.

Troy Tallman found success with the bunt against USC over the weekend, but had no need for such tactics in Berkeley
yesterday. His grand slam capped an eight-run first inning as Stanford won its fourth Six-Pac game in as many days, beat
ing California 15-7 at Evans Diamond.
The Bears brought in their
forth hurler of the day, Scott
Morehouse, who began his
appearance with a wild pitch,
allowing Holbrook to score. Ryan
Turner then got a single off of
Dan Cholowsky's throwing error
from third base to load the bases.
After Steve Solomon flied out to
left, shortstop Roger Burnett sent
a 2-0 pitch into the left field seats
for another grand slam home run,
his third home run in three days.
Marquess said, "Roger's
played super. He's played good
defense, he's had key hits for us
in the last four games, three of
them home runs. . . . He's playing
extremely well. He's having his
best season since he's been at
Stanford. That's [been] one of the

keys to our success so far."
Tallman struck out to end the
inning, but the Cardinal extended
the score to 15-3 as it inflicted
another inning of offensive dam
age, scoring six runs on only two
hits, but with the help of two Cal
fielding errors. Cal came up
empty in the bottom of the third.
The fourth inning proved
uneventful, as both teams failed
to score. Stanford also came up
empty in the top of the fifth. In
the bottom of the fifth inning, Cal
decreased its deficit as Mike Har
rison hit a three-run homer. But
the Bears would get no closer.
Aaron Dorlarque came in after
Harrison's blast to relieve John
Reid, and finished off the game.
The teams exchanged goose eggs
in the sixth inning, and the Cardi
nal chalked one up as well in the
top of the seventh. Cal scored one
run in the bottom part of the
inning on a hit by left fielder Reid

Neumann with runners on fifst
and second and two outs to make
the score stand at 15-7, Stanford.
The fact that Stanford has so
many offensive weapons hurt Cal
ifornia. Six of the Cardinal nine
had at least one RBI, with Bur
nett and Tallman leading the way
with four apiece. The most crush
ing blow to the Golden Bears' psy
che was Stanford hitters hitting
not one, but two grand slams.
Said Marquess, "That doesn't
happen very often. Its really
unusual to have two grand slams
in one game. You don't get that
opportunity that often."
With the victory, the Cardi
nal's record improved to 24-9
overall, 8-3 in the Six-Pac. Stan
ford is enjoying a four-game con
ference win streak.
Marquess likes what he sees on
the field. "I think we're starting
to play well again. The first 20
games we played extremely well

and then we went through a
period there where there wasn't a
phase of our game that was really
very good. We didn't pitch very
well, we played some sloppy
defense. . . . We're getting to the
point where we're starting to play
well again. Hopefully, we can con
tinue and if anything improve a
little bit. The good thing is we've
got a lot of games coming up, the
weather is good and we're start
ing to play like we're capable of."
"The sweep of USC was big,
but I don't think people really
understood that this was also a
big game," added Burnett. "We
feared a letdown after the week
end, but we got some runs early
and managed to keep it rolling."
Another chance for the Cardi
nal to continue its winning ways
comes today in a non-conference
match-up with the University of
the Pacific on the road in Stock
ton.

Tallman struck out to end the
inning, but the Cardinal extended
the score to 15-3 as it inflicted
another inning of offensive dam
age, scoring six runs on only two
hits, but with the help of two Cal
fielding errors. Cal came up
empty in the bottom of the third.
The fourth inning proved
uneventful, as both teams failed
to score. Stanford also came up
empty in the top of the fifth. In
the bottom of the fifth inning, Cal
decreased its deficit as Mike Har
rison hit a three-run homer. But
the Bears would get no closer.
Aaron Dorlarque came in after
Harrison's blast to relieve John
Reid, and finished off the game.
The teams exchanged goose eggs
in the sixth inning, and the Cardi
nal chalked one up as well in the
top of the seventh. Cal scored one
run in the bottom part of the
inning on a hit by left fielder Reid

Neumann with runners on fifst
and second and two outs to make
the score stand at 15-7, Stanford.
The fact that Stanford has so
many offensive weapons hurt Cal
ifornia. Six of the Cardinal nine
had at least one RBI, with Bur
nett and Tallman leading the way
with four apiece. The most crush
ing blow to the Golden Bears' psy
che was Stanford hitters hitting
not one, but two grand slams.
Said Marquess, "That doesn't
happen very often. Its really
unusual to have two grand slams
in one game. You don't get that
opportunity that often."
With the victory, the Cardi
nal's record improved to 24-9
overall, 8-3 in the Six-Pac. Stan
ford is enjoying a four-game con
ference win streak.
Marquess likes what he sees on
the field. "I think we're starting
to play well again. The first 20
games we played extremely well

and then we went through a
period there where there wasn't a
phase of our game that was really
very good. We didn't pitch very
well, we played some sloppy
defense. . . . We're getting to the
point where we're starting to play
well again. Hopefully, we can con
tinue and if anything improve a
little bit. The good thing is we've
got a lot of games coming up, the
weather is good and we're start
ing to play like we're capable of."
"The sweep of USC was big,
but I don't think people really
understood that this was also a
big game," added Burnett. "We
feared a letdown after the week
end, but we got some runs early
and managed to keep it rolling."
Another chance for the Cardi
nal to continue its winning ways
comes today in a non-conference
match-up with the University of
the Pacific on the road in Stock
ton.
Let's play one.
One inning, that is.
The top of the first was all the Cardinal
needed yesterday as the team exploded for
eight runs against befuddled California
pitching to topple the Golden Bears 15-7 in
Berkeley.
The Cardinal left no doubt that it is on a
mission for the Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division championship. Coming
off a three-game sweep of USC this past
weekend, Stanford used that momentum to
dominate Cal from the get-go. Bear starting
pitcher Nate Brown made an early exit
from the field at Evans Diamond after
walking the first four batters he faced, giv
ing up one unearned run.
Chad Konishi fared no better against the
Cardinal hitters. Ryan Turner slapped a
base hit to left field to score Chris Kemper,
and Steve Solomon singled to center to
score David McCarty and Jeffrey Ham
monds. Konishi then proceeded to load the
bases again by walking Roger Burnett, and
Troy Tallman made him pay for it.
The junior catcher cranked a grand slam
to left field on a 3-2 pitch for his fifth career
home run against Cal. The next three Car
dinal batters were retired, but no matter.
The damage was done. Stanford chalked up
eight runs on only three hits to take a com
manding lead with still 8 1/2 innings to play.
"I was exited obviously," said coach
Mark Marquess.
"They gave us some walks and a couple of
key hits. The grand slam by Troy Tallman

was really the key blast there. I was real
pleased because we scored eight runs with
out even having an out .. . [andJ that we
took advantage of the opportunity they
gave us."
Cardinal pitcher John Reid, coming off
of only two days rest after pitching four
innings against USC Friday, got the Bears
out in the bottom half of the first inning
rather easily, having to face only four Cal
batters. Stanford added one run in the top
of the second inning as new Bear pitcher
Derek Dowd walked two batters and threw
a wild pitch.
In the bottom half of the inning, sopho
more right fielder Matt Luke tried to get
Cal on the right track. The Six-Pac's lead
ing hitter with a .472 average homered to
left field. Mike Harrison took Luke's exam
ple to hit a double into center field. Reid
Neumann promptly doubled Harrison
home, and scored after moving a base each
time after two consecutive pop outs. The
Bears finished the inning with three runs
to only trail by six.
But Cal's faint hopes of competing in
this one ended in the third inning. David
Cornell started it off by grounding to short,
but he beat out the throw to first base.
David Holbrook then walked. Chris Kem
per followed with a routine fly ball to right,
which was muffed by Luke.
David McCarty grounded out to short,
allowing Cornell to score. Kemper moved to
second base on the play, and Jeffrey Ham
monds was then walked. That was it for
pitcher Derek Dowd.

Troy Tallman found success with the bunt against USC over the weekend, but had no need for such tactics in Berkeley
yesterday. His grand slam capped an eight-run first inning as Stanford won its fourth Six-Pac game in as many days, beat
ing California 15-7 at Evans Diamond.
The Bears brought in their
forth hurler of the day, Scott
Morehouse, who began his
appearance with a wild pitch,
allowing Holbrook to score. Ryan
Turner then got a single off of
Dan Cholowsky's throwing error
from third base to load the bases.
After Steve Solomon flied out to
left, shortstop Roger Burnett sent
a 2-0 pitch into the left field seats
for another grand slam home run,
his third home run in three days.
Marquess said, "Roger's
played super. He's played good
defense, he's had key hits for us
in the last four games, three of
them home runs. . . . He's playing
extremely well. He's having his
best season since he's been at
Stanford. That's [been] one of the

keys to our success so far."
