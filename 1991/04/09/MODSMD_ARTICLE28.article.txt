# Baseball's back — already?
## 
### 
Opening Day, huh? Oh joy.
It's that time again in the
Bay Area — a time, for
many of us, of fear, dread,
loathing, worrying, panicking,
crying and not a little vomiting:
We're about to hear how
great the Giants and A's are.
Again, again, and again.
We'll hear it from writers
who seem to have forgotten that
the Giants spent a good part of
last year in the basement and
still have a bullpen that would
have trouble striking out Ray
Charles. We'll hear it from fans
who seem to forget last October
and the fact that the A's are now
the greatest team in history to
get embarrassed two out of
three years in the World Series.
I know, it's hard to believe
it's all starting up again —
Didn't the A's just get their
butts kicked last week? — but
I'm pretty sure there's no way
to avoid it. Even all the presea
son predictions are done: Seven
of the Chronicle's 13-member
panel picked the Giants to (sur
prise!) win their division; nine
picked the A's. Risk-takers,
every one.
Of course, any idiot can make
predictions at this time of year,
and just to prove it I'll make
two: (1) Neither the Giants nor
the A's will win the World Series
this season, and (2) the Bay
Area media will whine about it
for months on end.
There. I 've said my piece. No
promises, no pretending to be
an expert on something I don't
know much about . . . and cer

tainly, nothing saying how great
it is that it's baseball season
again.
This week, after all, is not
only the time when we hear how
the Giants and A's are both
going to win the Series; it's also
usually the time when everyone
gets all sappy, gooey and melo
dramatic and says how baseball
is just like life, how time begins
on opening day, how perfect the
game is.
Come on.
Excuse me for going out on a
limb here, but from this angle
major-league baseball doesn't
seem a heck of a lot like life. If it
were, we'd all be wearing pants
that were way too tight, grab
bing our crotches 2.3 times per
hour, spitting wads of toxic
waste at each others' knees,
making 500 bucks an hour and
complaining about it, cussing at
everything that moves and
belching a lot.
Actually, that does sound a
bit like my relatives, but I'd like
to think they're unique.
Anyway, purists aside, we've
got to be honest here: Baseball
isn't like life any more than, say,
hockey is. (Go ahead. Call me

the Baseball Grinch. I can take
it.)
Hockey ain't like life simply
because most folks in the real
world don't spend their lives on
a dirty patch of ice trying to
decapitate people they don't like
(except in New York); baseball
ain't like life 'cuz (1) No one in
real life has Astroturf in their
backyard; (2) No one in real life
spends years trying to find the
perfect way to swing a stick
(except golfers, and I don't
think anyone really takes them
seriously anyway); and (3) peo
ple like Barry Bonds and Rickey
Henderson get their butts fired
in the real world.
So baseball isn't like or
about life, or teamwork, or
crotch grabs, or those cold
hot dogs that are about three
inches long and cost half a
week's pay.
No, the game, in case you
haven't been paying attention
for the last few months, is about
whining.
Take Rickey "What, I don't
get as Eerrari, too?" Henderson,
for example. Henderson, who
will break Lou Brock's record
for career stolen bases this
week, has spent all of spring
training saying he can't get by
on $3 million per year.
Well heck, who can? I mean,
you can hardly blame the guy
for complaining about making
more money in the next six

Macky
months than I'm going to make
in the next 30 fricking years!!!!!
Bitter? Me? Not at all.
Besides, Rickey's got a legiti
mate gripe: He was the AL MVP
last year, and now he's being
forced to work for Roger
Clemens' pocket change. Let's
break this down a little bit. Three
mil per year with Rickey's 1990
stats gives him approximately:
• $49,180.33 for each of his 61
RBI;
• $46,153.85 for each of the 65
bases he stole (that's $512.82 for
each of 90 feet between the bases
on each steal, or $42.74 per inch);
• $22,058.82 per game;
• $18,867.92 per hit;
• $6,134 per at bat;
• $4,893.96 for every time he
went to the plate, whether he
ended up hitting, walking, strik
ing out, spitting on the catcher,
whatever; and
• 22 cents for every time he
said how great he was.
Hey, I'd be pretty steamed, too.
And the A's didn't even give him
anv free cars.

Rickey's complaint isn't
entirely out of line, 'cuz
he's only the fourth-high
est paid player on the A's. Jose "I
thought the speed limit was 95,
officer" Canseco tops the list at
$4,700,000 a year. (Well, actually,
it may just be $2.35 mil, depend
ing on whether Jose actually gets
divorced. If wife Esther wins a
settlement, she'll have made
about $6,438.34 per . . . oh, ouch!
Foul!!)
For Jose, that's $127,027.03
for every home run. Just to put
that in perspective, if Hank Aaron
had been paid that much, he
would've received (I can't believe
this) $95,905,405.41 for his
career.
Holy endowment, Batman.
The comparisons can go on: At
the Jose rate, Roger Maris
would've pulled in $7,748,648.65
for his season in 1961 (plus a
bonus for winning the MVP);
Cecil Fielder would've made $6.5
mil in 1991. ..
. . . and I, darnit, would still be
shopping for clothes at K-Mart.
Why didn't Mom put a baseball in
mv crib?
