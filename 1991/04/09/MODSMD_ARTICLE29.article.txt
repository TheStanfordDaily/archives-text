# Women struggle to ninth
## 
### Peter J. Blum Staff writer 
The conditions were perfect.
The weather was warm — about
85 degrees — and there was
hardly a breeze of wind.
But maybe, as junior Stephanie
Davis said, "it was a little bit too
warm" for the women's golf team
as they finished in a tie for ninth
yesterday with Oklahoma State
on the first day of the Lady Sun
Devil Invitational Tournament at
the Karsten Golf Course in
Tempe, Ariz.
"The putts just didn't fall,"
said senior Jodi Figley, who fin
ished seven over par.
Nonetheless, the team was
impressed with junior Martha

Richards' first outing of the year
after missing a large portion of
the season due to basketball.
With two days left in the tour
nament, the No. 5-ranked Cardi
nal is 24 strokes off the leader, sec
ond-ranked UCLA, which ended
the day with a 292. Arizona State,
ranked only 22nd in the nation,
used its home-course advantage to
finish third behind only UCLA
and top-ranked San Jose State.
More importantly, looking
upon a top-five finish as a success
ful tournament performance, the
Cardinal linksters are 16 strokes
behind Oklahoma, the current
holder of fifth place, after the first
18 holes.
The Cardinal was the last to

take to the greens of the desert
course, and as a result, the greens
were dried out.
As junior Audrey Wooding said,
"The greens were a little hard. I
hit some drives which landed on a
pin and then the ball bounced and
rolled off the green."
Davis, ranked 51st in the
NCAA, led the Cardinal with a 76
on the par-72 Karsten course to
finish the day 21st behind the cur
rent leader Kelly Robbins of
Tulane who shot four under par.
"I didn't do anything really
exciting," Davis said. "I was hit
ting an even-par after nine holes,
and 1 missed a few putts. It came
down to putting and luck on the
greens."
Recording a 77 for five over par,
Wooding was only one stroke
behind Davis but, as she said, "in
the back of the pack of front-run
ners."
After missing a few up-and
downs on a par 4, Wooding settled
for a tie at 25th.
"I'm stroking the ball better
than in the rest of the winter sea
son," said the No. 12-ranked
Wooding. "It was the little things
that made my score a 77 instead of
a 72."
The surprise of the day was
Richards, who beat out freshman
Melinda Daniels in a playoff over
the weekend for the fifth spot on
the roster. Shooting an 84,
Richards locked up the fourth
score for the Cardinal.
Tomorrow the tournament pic
ture could change dramatically.
At 8:15 a.m., the Cardinal golfers
will have the first tee time on the
fresh and damp course.
