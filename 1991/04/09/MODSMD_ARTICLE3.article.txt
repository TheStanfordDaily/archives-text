# Effects of Gulf war felt in the classroom

### Susan Jackson 
English Prof. Regenia Gagnier was
scheduled to teach courses on Victo
rian political economy and 19th cen
tury fiction this spring. Then came the
war.
"Suddenly Victorian political econ
omy didn't seem as relevant," she says.
So instead she developed an under
graduate course and a graduate collo
quium on the Literature of War.
At the beginning of last quarter,

many students wondered, "Will a war
begin?" Now many of them are asking,
"Is it over?"
These concerns have affected the
content of several Stanford current
courses and have inspired new ones,
including Gagnier's.
One particularly affected class is
Peace Studies, an interdisciplinary
course that has been taught by a group
of professors for the past decade.
"The value of our class is its inter
disciplinary nature," course coordina

tor Byron Bland said. "At its worst it
can be what a historian or a politician
or a sociologist thinks about peace."
At best, the course is more than just
international relations, national secu
rity theory, negotiation technique or
political science. "It's all of those, but
with a normative direction," Bland
says. "How do you create and maintain
peace?"
This year, enrollment rose from an
average of 100 to about 140, Bland
said.

Last week, History Prof. Barton
Bernstein gave an introductory lecture
on the lessons of the Persian Gulf war.
"We used to start with the atomic
bomb," Bernstein said. "Topics that
used to seem relevant have become
marginalized."
While the Gulf war will not be the
subject of any more lectures in the
class, "it will be lurking in every lec
ture. That is a given," Bland said.
The war also spurred the cre
ation of six Innovative Academic
Courses this spring that are
devoted to war and peace.
In Masculinity and War, Helen
Gremillion and Bill Maurer, an
anthropology graduate student,
will look at 20th century theories
of masculinity and masculine
identity. "What is all this stuff
about missile size anyway?" Mau
rer asks.
Two courses explore the rela
tionship between the media and
the war. Pacific Radio correspon
dent Larry Bensky is teaching
Reconstructing Reality: Under
standing Mass Media in the '90s,
and undergraduates Anna Rabi
nowicz and Matthew Lombard are
offering a mini-course, On Media
Stereotypes and the War.
Andree Sursock of the Under
graduate Advising Center is look
ing at the cultural context of the
war in his course, On Under
standing the Middle East.
In Education for War and
Peace: Militarism and the Ameri
can Schools, taught by education
graduate student Dan Perlstein,
students are examining the rela
tionship between peace issues and
the military's influence on schools
with a particular focus on recruit
ment.
Another course also focuses on
the ambiguous relationship
between Stanford and the mili
tary. Two alumni, Greg Cumber
ford and Karen Jacobson, are
teaching the SWOPSI course,
"Military Research at Stanford."

For continuing courses like
Peace Studies, however, the Gulf
war is just the latest source of
change in the curriculum.
After the Berlin Wall came
down, "we realized that the class
was a history class — the frame
was the Cold War," Bland said.
Now, with each new change in
events, the professors try to re
examine "the underlying pro
cesses and dynamics of war and
peace."
Peace Studies is an amalgam —
it is cross-listed in six depart
ments: sociology, political science,
psychology, history, education and
Values, Technology, Science and
Society. It is sponsored by six pro
fessors and features about 15
other lecturers.
Bland, who divides his time
between the campus ministries
and the Bechtel International
Center, started meeting in 1980
with professors "with political
views from clearly quite left to
moderate," said Psychology Prof.
Lee Ross, one of the course's
sponsors.
"The Stanford student view —
'Why do we need so many bombs?'
— was overly simplistic. We
wanted to go beyond that kind of
rhetoric," Ross said.
For two years before the class
existed, the group "discussed
issues of peace that were impor
tant to us," Bland said.
Members were not, however,
trying to achieve consensus. "We
had to see what each other's ideas
were," he added.
"We've come to recognize our
differences," said Bernstein.
"Nobody seeks to convert, just to
be explicit about the differences
and make it clear when we're dis

agreeing."
Ironically, Peace Studies seems
to be inspired by war.
"During the Vietnam years,"
said Political Science Prof.
Charles Drekmeier, "people from
10 or 12 disciplines offered a
Peace Studies program with as
many as 40 courses for a period of
four years."
"The idea of peace wasn't very
popular then. And the Stanford
administration provided no sup
port, only threats that we were
somehow out of bounds. But since
there was no budget threat [the
Universityl could do nothing to
extinguish courses sponsored by
authenticated faculty," Drekmeier
said.
The Stanford Workshops on
Political and Social Issues also
began at the height of the Viet
nam War, in 1969, in response to
students' concerns that their
"education did not reflect what's
going on in the real world," said
Joanna Davidson, undergraduate
director of the program.
Nobody gets paid to teach
Peace Studies. None of the profes
sors gets release time to work on
the course.
Some money has been raised
through the I-Center, the campus
ministries and other sources to
pay outside lecturers, a teaching
assistant and the coordinator.
"One of the values of the
course," Bland says, "is that it's
people doing what they want to
do." He adds, however, that "I'd
like to get more supplies, have a
permanent home in a department
and be a regular budget entity so
we don't have to scrap for money
every year, cup in hand."

says. "How do you create and maintain
peace?"
This year, enrollment rose from an
average of 100 to about 140, Bland
said.

Last week, History Prof. Barton
Bernstein gave an introductory lecture
on the lessons of the Persian Gulf war.
"We used to start with the atomic
bomb," Bernstein said. "Topics that
used to seem relevant have become
marginalized."
While the Gulf war will not be the
subject of any more lectures in the
class, "it will be lurking in every lec
ture. That is a given," Bland said.
The war also spurred the cre
ation of six Innovative Academic
Courses this spring that are
devoted to war and peace.
In Masculinity and War, Helen
Gremillion and Bill Maurer, an
anthropology graduate student,
will look at 20th century theories
of masculinity and masculine
identity. "What is all this stuff
about missile size anyway?" Mau
rer asks.
Two courses explore the rela
tionship between the media and
the war. Pacific Radio correspon
dent Larry Bensky is teaching
Reconstructing Reality: Under
standing Mass Media in the '90s,
and undergraduates Anna Rabi
nowicz and Matthew Lombard are
offering a mini-course, On Media
Stereotypes and the War.
Andree Sursock of the Under
graduate Advising Center is look
ing at the cultural context of the
war in his course, On Under
standing the Middle East.
In Education for War and
Peace: Militarism and the Ameri
can Schools, taught by education
graduate student Dan Perlstein,
students are examining the rela
tionship between peace issues and
the military's influence on schools
with a particular focus on recruit
ment.
Another course also focuses on
the ambiguous relationship
between Stanford and the mili
tary. Two alumni, Greg Cumber
ford and Karen Jacobson, are
teaching the SWOPSI course,
"Military Research at Stanford."

For continuing courses like
Peace Studies, however, the Gulf
war is just the latest source of
change in the curriculum.
After the Berlin Wall came
down, "we realized that the class
was a history class — the frame
was the Cold War," Bland said.
Now, with each new change in
events, the professors try to re
examine "the underlying pro
cesses and dynamics of war and
peace."
Peace Studies is an amalgam —
it is cross-listed in six depart
ments: sociology, political science,
psychology, history, education and
Values, Technology, Science and
Society. It is sponsored by six pro
fessors and features about 15
other lecturers.
Bland, who divides his time
between the campus ministries
and the Bechtel International
Center, started meeting in 1980
with professors "with political
views from clearly quite left to
moderate," said Psychology Prof.
Lee Ross, one of the course's
sponsors.
"The Stanford student view —
'Why do we need so many bombs?'
— was overly simplistic. We
wanted to go beyond that kind of
rhetoric," Ross said.
For two years before the class
existed, the group "discussed
issues of peace that were impor
tant to us," Bland said.
Members were not, however,
trying to achieve consensus. "We
had to see what each other's ideas
were," he added.
"We've come to recognize our
differences," said Bernstein.
"Nobody seeks to convert, just to
be explicit about the differences
and make it clear when we're dis

agreeing."
Ironically, Peace Studies seems
to be inspired by war.
"During the Vietnam years,"
said Political Science Prof.
Charles Drekmeier, "people from
10 or 12 disciplines offered a
Peace Studies program with as
many as 40 courses for a period of
four years."
"The idea of peace wasn't very
popular then. And the Stanford
administration provided no sup
port, only threats that we were
somehow out of bounds. But since
there was no budget threat [the
Universityl could do nothing to
extinguish courses sponsored by
authenticated faculty," Drekmeier
said.
The Stanford Workshops on
Political and Social Issues also
began at the height of the Viet
nam War, in 1969, in response to
students' concerns that their
"education did not reflect what's
going on in the real world," said
Joanna Davidson, undergraduate
director of the program.
Nobody gets paid to teach
Peace Studies. None of the profes
sors gets release time to work on
the course.
Some money has been raised
through the I-Center, the campus
ministries and other sources to
pay outside lecturers, a teaching
assistant and the coordinator.
"One of the values of the
course," Bland says, "is that it's
people doing what they want to
do." He adds, however, that "I'd
like to get more supplies, have a
permanent home in a department
and be a regular budget entity so
we don't have to scrap for money
every year, cup in hand."
English Prof. Regenia Gagnier was
scheduled to teach courses on Victo
rian political economy and 19th cen
tury fiction this spring. Then came the
war.
"Suddenly Victorian political econ
omy didn't seem as relevant," she says.
So instead she developed an under
graduate course and a graduate collo
quium on the Literature of War.
At the beginning of last quarter,

many students wondered, "Will a war
begin?" Now many of them are asking,
"Is it over?"
These concerns have affected the
content of several Stanford current
courses and have inspired new ones,
including Gagnier's.
One particularly affected class is
Peace Studies, an interdisciplinary
course that has been taught by a group
of professors for the past decade.
"The value of our class is its inter
disciplinary nature," course coordina

tor Byron Bland said. "At its worst it
can be what a historian or a politician
or a sociologist thinks about peace."
At best, the course is more than just
international relations, national secu
rity theory, negotiation technique or
political science. "It's all of those, but
with a normative direction," Bland
says. "How do you create and maintain
peace?"
This year, enrollment rose from an
average of 100 to about 140, Bland
said.
