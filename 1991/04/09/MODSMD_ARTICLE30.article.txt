Thirty-six holes.
Ten and a half hours.
Wind out of hell.
Narrow fairways.
This was the story of the men's
golf team as it saw yesterday's
first-day lead slip out of its grasp
while shooting a combined 10 over
par in the last three holes of the
Etonic Southwest Intercollegiate
Invitational Golf Championship
at the North Ranch Country Club
in Westlake Village, Calif. How
ever, junior Christian Cevaer fin
ished the day atop the individual
scorers with a combined 143,
shooting a 74 on the the first
round and a 69 on the second.

"The last few holes were the
demise of last year's team (which
failed to make the NCAA tourna
ment by two strokes), and it fig
ures to be a problem this year,
too," said coach Wally Goodwin.
The No. 24-ranked Cardinal,
which had not competed since
March 8, finished the evening in
third place, trailing UCLA by only
six strokes, but with 10 more than
current leader, USC.
"Most of these teams have com
peted three or four times this
spring," said Goodwin. "I don't
want to take away from the per
formances of these other teams,
but we haven't competed in nearly
a month."
Cevaer, an All-American last
year who finished No. 8 in the

nation, offset a disappointing fin
ish by his team with "an after
noon that was better than my
morning round."
"Christian Cevaer is back,"
exclaimed Goodwin.
After a grueling fall season in
which he represented the United
States in Japan and New Zealand,
Cevaer faltered in the early spring
season.
Drilling three balls out of
bounds in the last few holes,
freshman Casey Martin still shot
the Cardinal's second-leading
score, 149.
"We're not out of it," Cevaer
said. "If everyone on the team
improves by an average of two
strokes we can do it."
Thirty-six holes.
