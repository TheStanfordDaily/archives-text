# Sailors outduel wind, Golden Bears to take series lead
## 
### Deborah Claymon Staff writer 
For Stanford, sun and wind and tough
competition equaled success in North
Series 7 and 8. Fighting heavy, shifty wind
at Alameda to gain the advantage in this
year's North Series, the Cardinal sailors
passed California and 22 other boats from
nine schools in two narrow victories.
Stanford slid past a very disappointed
Cal team by one point in both days of rac
ing. Stanford, nationally ranked ninth, now
leads by one regatta in the series with one
final match at Berkeley in two weeks.
Under pressure to continue the team's
winning streak from the Rainier Cup over
Spring Break, Stanford's senior varsity
team of Dave Dowd and Paula Gani, and
Rick Rosen and Rebecca Bryson snatched
Cal's lead in the series. Despite very heavy
wind, which kept light crews struggling
upwind, Dowd and Rosen maneuvered the
estuary-bound course expertly.
A four-year veteran of North Series com
petition against strong teams from UC-
Santa Cruz, UCLA and Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo, Rosen maintained great consis
tency, taking four bullets and having only
one race fall below a second place.
California held a tight focus on Stanford
in the extremely competitive A division, but
Dowd came out strong with two consecutive
bullets in the final races. However, in an
exciting battle for the top of A s, Matt
"Skippy" Sanford and Kristen Siddell
slowly worked the Cal varsity boat, taking
an eventual first place in the tie-breaker
between the two. "We all were really hot to
dominate Cal, and as close as things got,
Stanford stayed in excellent competitive

phase," said Sanford.
Keeping Stanford above the rest of the
fleet, JV boats filled the top positions. Over
all, Stanford finished with five boats in the
top six. Stanford's top women's pair of
Haley King and Jen Yeh were formidable in
B's, taking fifth to combine with Sanford
for third overall.
Confident after Saturday's victory,
Rosen and Dowd sailed out unhesitatingly
set to dominate as Stanford's varsity pair.
Rosen held through the first set, but an
unfortunate breakdown in the fifth race
put him behind to fourth in division. Dowd
also struggled in B to stay consistently
ahead, finishing in a disappointing fifth.
However, Rosen and Dowd's performance
was still sufficient to oust Cal's own trou
bled sailors, and Stanford passed the Bears
by one.
Although the varsity team had its ups
and downs, including an intentional capsize
by Rosen and Bryson in order to fix their
down jib, Stanford's younger sailors came
through to take second behind a Cal JV
boat for the regatta. In sailing, one pair
from each school is designated varsity, and
their finish determines the school's place at
the event, even if there is a higher place
recorded by another team member.
Both Stanford and Cal showed the depth
of their teams with these JV top finishes.
"Even though the top skippers had diffi
culty, [Scottl Sellers and Geoff McDonald's
storming win of B division bodes well for
the future," said coach Blake Middleton,
who was impressed by the performance of
the JV sailors, also including John Emory
and Brett Adams.


Blake Mlddteton â€” Stanford tailing
Despite windy conditions, the Stanford sailing team eeked out a pair of wins over the weekend. Stanford, ranked ninth
nationally, has now opened a lead on arch-rival Cal In the North Series going into the last regatta.
