# Crews show youth

The San Diego Crew Classic
last weekend marked one more
step on the road to possible
Pacific 10 Conference victories
for Stanford's men and women
rowers.
Although neither varsity
squad had shining perfor
mances, the younger freshmen
and novice teams showed
sparkling potential. For the
first time in his Cardinal
coaching career, women's
coach John Davis did not have
his varsity team in the final
heat.
"We didn't expect to go
down and win it but we did
hope to make the final," Davis
said. "It was a good knock on
the chin." The experienced
women finished 10th after
struggling against fast compe
tition.
"The competition was really
good this year," said varsity
rower Bonnie Baker. "We
rowed really hard but it's not
the end of the season yet, and
we're really training to do well
at Pac-lOs."
Keeping this long term goal
in mind eased the sting of the
loss. The quality of the compe
tition also kept the race from
being too disappointing.
"Boston University (which won
the regatta) is probably the
best team I've ever seen.

They're all about six feet tall."
Virginia also surprised
many of its competitors. It out
rowed both Stanford and
perennial powerhouse Wiscon
sin.
The Cardinal's junior var
sity faced competition with
more experience, according to
Davis. However the team did
fly home with a fifth-place fin
ish. The novice and freshman
boats also qualified for Sun
day's final round.
The first novice boat placed
second behind Washington,
soundly defeating California by
five seconds. "They had a won
derful performance," said
Davis.
The second boat also did
well in Sunday's race after
barely qualifying on Saturday.
It finished fourth overall. Even
men's varsity coach Wieslaw
Kujda noted the freshman
women as "the best perfor
mance of the weekend."
On the men's side, the
freshmen placed a strong third
and the novice boat finished
sixth in the final.
"I'm pretty pleased," Kujda
said. "The varsity and JV had
good races, and the JV even
beat Harvard. This is just a
process. We can't afford to be
ready from the beginning.
We're getting faster and faster
every day."
"I was extremely impressed
with the field," Davis said.
