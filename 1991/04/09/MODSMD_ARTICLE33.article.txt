Council of Presidents,
Kennedy to address students
University President Donald Kennedy
will speak to students about Stanford's indi
rect-cost controversy tonight at 7:30 p.m. in
Kresge Auditorium. The Council of Presi
dents will give its "State of the Association"
address following Kennedy's speech.
Kennedy is speaking at the COP's invita
tion, said COP member Goodwin Liu, a
senior.
Fellow COP member Ingrid Nava, a
senior, said "Kennedy wanted to communi
cate to students about the indirect-cost
issue.
The COP's speech is traditionally given in
the spring to the ASSU Senate, but Nava
said the COP decided to present it to all the
students. "We usually do the State of the
Association around this time. We decided to
do it in the larger forum with President
Kennedy," she said.
Nava, who is in her second term on the
COP said last year's address also aimed at a
wider audience than just the senate. "Last
time, we did it in the senate chamber but
invited a lot of people from different con
stituencies," she said. This year's speech is
another way of reaching out to students.
"We're trying to get out to as many people as
possible in a more direct way," she said.
Each address will take approximately 20
minutes. Both Kennedy and the COP will
take questions after the two speeches are
over, Nava said.
Stanford people appointed
to Los Angeles police panel
Three members of the Stanford commu
nity are part of an independent commission
established to study the Los Angeles Police
Department in the wake of beating of Rod
ney King.
Former Board of Trustees President War
ren Christopher, current trustee Roy Ander
son and Stanford graduate Dr. Robert Tran
quada were originally part of the Christo
pher Commission, appointed April 1 by Los
Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley to investigate
the department in an attempt to restore
public confidence after the March 3 beating.
The commission merged Thursday with
the Arguelles Commission, appointed by Los
Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates, and

formed an independent commission.
Bryce Nelson, director and special adviser
for press relations of the independent com
mission, said the two groups would have had
to gather essentially the same information
and thereby wasted time by working sepa
rately.
Christopher, chair of the commission,
received his law degree from Stanford in
1949 and was president of the Stanford
Board of Trustees from 1985 to 1988. He is
now chair of the law firm of O'Melveny &
Myers.
Anderson was chair of Lockheed Corpora
tion from 1977 to 1985.
Neither Anderson nor Christopher could
comment because of a commission policy
restricting communication with the press.
Before the policy took effect, Tranquada,
who received his medical degree in 1955
from Stanford and is currently the dean of
the USC School of Medicine, said he is
uncertain why he was chosen to be on the
commission. He surmised that his life expe
riences as a physician may have been a factor
in his appointment.
Nelson noted that, while Christopher,
Anderson and Tranquada are all very well
respected in their professions, he believes
the individuals were chosen more for their
reputations of being, among other qualities,
diligent and fair-minded.
Although a definitive agenda has not yet
been developed, Tranquada and Nelson said
part of the information gathering process
will likely include open hearings to get input
from both the Los Angeles community and
the department.

Dish Dash raises $5,000
Sigma Phi Epsilon raised approximately
$5,000 for the Sanctuary, a homeless shel
ter in San Francisco, in its third annual
Dish Dash held over the weekend.
More than 400 runners participated in
the program, which involved a Sunday
morning race to the Dish. Both the men's
and the women's first-place finishers also
won the race last year. The men's winner
was senior Miles Brown, who finished with a
Dish Dash record of 17:17. The women's
winner was sophomore Meisha Abbasinejad.
The Sanctuary is a 24-hour rehabilitative
shelter for the homeless that provides food,
shelter, job training and literacy programs.

Professor's award-winning film
explains biblical Jericho story
A Stanford professor and a former stu
dent have received an apple for their film
about earthquakes in Israel — the Silver
Apple Award, that is.
Geophysics department chair Prof. Amos
Nur and Chris MacAskil won the award for
their film, "The Walls Came Tumbling
Down: Earthquakes in the Holy Land."
In part, the film explains how the walls of
the biblical city of Jericho collapsed after an
earthquake in the year 1000 B.C. Nur has
studied earthquakes in Israel that go back to
biblical times, but he has not quite unlocked
the secret to predicting future ones.
Two named Younger Scholars
Two Stanford juniors have won Younger
Scholars grants that will allow them to do
independent research and writing projects
this summer.
Megan Williams and Karin Roffman will
each receive a $2,200 grant. They are two of
136 high school and college students to
receive the award from the National Endow
ment for the Humanities.
Williams will study "The Eternal in Plato
and the Christian Middle Platonists," and
Roffman will study "Politics and Art in the
Works of George Bernard Shaw."
The Younger Scholars program was
established in 1984. It provides students the
opportunity to conduct non-credit indepen
dent research and writing projects.
Law conference to discuss
recruiting people of color
Representatives from eight law schools in
Northern California will gather at Hastings
College of the Law this Saturday in a confer
ence designed to encourage minority, women
and gay and lesbian lawyers to teach at law
schools.
Stanford, one of the cosponsors of the
conference, recently hired a lesbian and a
black woman as professors at its Law School.
But some students, particularly those
involved in the Coalition for a Diversified
Faculty, say the school has a long way to go
before the school's faculty adequately repre
sents the diversity of the student body and
the population in general.
