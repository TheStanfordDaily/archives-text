# Stanford prepares for more rationing
## March rains not enough to end drought 
### Linda Chen 
Because the March rainfall was
just a drop in the bucket and will
not end California's five-year
drought, Stanford administrators
are continuing to prepare for
increased rationing this summer.
A rationing act approved in
February will reduce Stanford's
total water allotment by 54 per
cent of the amount used in 1987
— the last year of normal rainfall.
The reduction will take effect in
June.
In an effort to prepare Stanford
for the big cutback, meters are
being installed in dormitories to
measure water usage. Residences
that exceed amounts deemed
acceptable by Operations and
Maintenance will be reprimanded.
Acceptable usage for on-cam
pus housing is currently being for
mulated by Operations and Main
tenance.
In addition, if spring usage is
comparable to this winter's
reduced levels, the University will
cancel out last fall's excess usage
and be reimbursed for $302,630 in
fines, said David Kaye, manager of
Operations and Maintenance.
The nine inches of rain during
the month increased the water
level at Hetch Hetchy, the reser
voir in Yosemite National Park
that supplies Stanford with water,
but not significantly enough to
increase San Francisco Water
Department allotments, Kaye
said.
At the beginning of March, the
reservoir had received only 20 per
cent of a normal year's rain. By
the end of March, it had received
about 80 percent of normal pre
cipitation.
Normal annual precipitation
totals about 14 to 15 inches. The
12 inches that fell during the past

12 months sound encouraging,
but the rainfall does not counter
the 32-inch deficit incurred dur
ing the last four years. Kaye said,
"It would take two winters' worth
of normal rainfall and rationing to
return to normal."
Stanford was fined because it
failed to meet a rationing plan
first approved last May. This act
forced Stanford to reduce its total
water usage by 25 percent.
However, the University used
an entire year's allotment of
water — 72 million gallons —
between August and November.
Kaye attributed most of that use
to irrigation.
This penalty has burdened
Stanford, but things are improv
ing, Kaye said. Stanford has been
below its monthly allotments
between December and March.
Kaye said, "Things look encourag
mg.
The goal of University water
conservation awareness programs
has not been to get reimbursed for
last fall's fine, but to prepare
Stanford for the forthcoming 54
percent cut in total usage.
Kaye is optimistic about mak
ing the reduction. "Stanford is
doing an excellent job rallying
together to meet our goals," he
said.
Most increases in spring usage
result from additional outdoor
irrigation due to lack of rainfall in
the season. The University
intends to keep irrigation to a
minimum, Kaye said.
All areas will experience a
decrease in watering, but the oval,
White Plaza and the golf course
will remain green.
Kaye warned, "Even though we
are coming under our allotments,
we must remain conscious of our
total water usage."
