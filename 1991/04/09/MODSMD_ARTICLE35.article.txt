# Learning outside the classroom
## Course on homelessness gives students real-life experience 
### Mara Mather Staff writer 
Homelessness and Poverty in
America, a two-quarter course
taught by Assoc. History Prof. A 1
Camarillo, goes far beyond the
confines of the classroom.
Begun winter quarter, it is the
first course at Stanford to inte
grate public-service internships
with classroom work.
As in any traditional history
seminar, the 15 undergraduates
enrolled in this course read and
discuss academic texts. But the
students in History 25 IS hope to
be much more than passive recipi
ents of information. Through
internships in the community, the
students apply and expand upon
their classroom education about
the issues of poverty and home
lessness.
"The real focus of the course is
personal experience," says Steve
Williams, a junior enrolled in the
seminar. Williams spends 15
hours a week at the San Jose
based Sanctuary, which provides
shelter for the mentally disabled
in both a short-term program and
in transitional, subsidized hous
ing for single adults.
At the shelter, Williams and his
fellow interns are currently
responsible for the client-intake
process and will soon be assigned
individual advisees.
Camarillo said he feels his stu
dents have not only learned a
tremendous amount from their

public-service experiences but
have become invaluable assistants
at the shelters.
"Although they are actually
interns, the mtyority are consid
ered staff now at the shelters," he
said. "Some will even be made
offers of staff positions after grad
uation." He said the course has
been "such a gratifying experi
ence" that he plans to teach it
again next year.
Students must be interviewed
by Camarillo to be accepted into
the seminar.
Linda Armstrong, a senior, said
the course may influence her
future career. She volunteers with
the Emergency Housing Consor
tium, an umbrella agency in San
Jose with six permanent facilities,
including Sanctuary and the
Santa Clara Family Living Center.
She added that the class has
helped her solidify her interest in
public service. In fact, she said her
internship may evolve into a full
time job after graduation.
Excited by the opportunity to
focus her education on what she
feels is important, she said, "Five
hours at a shelter teach you more
than a book."
While the number of Stanford
students involved in public service
is significant — more than 5,000
last year, according to the Haas
Public Service Center — course
participants stressed the need for
greater awareness of poverty
related issues.
Williams said there is "a ten

dency of Stanford students to con
sider themselves immune from
homelessness land to become]
locked into the beatific confines of
Palm Drive."
Although students at other
campuses, like UC-Berkeley, must
confront homelessness right off
campus, it is easy to ignore
poverty in the immediate Stan
ford area, he said. "People have
been excited and surprised to see
Stanford students come into shel
ters. ... We help by showing that
there are people in mainstream
society who care."
Camarillo said the course is a
reflection of Stanford's effort to
increase public service efforts
within the curriculum. The Haas
Center "has been a very impor
tant catalyst for coalescing stu
dents' interests in homelessness,"
he added.
Many of the students were
involved with public service
through the center before they
enrolled in the course.
Because of the course's innova
tive topic and approach, it has
been difficult finding texts that
are directly related to homeless
ness issues, students and Camar
illo said. Most of the readings
focus on poverty. Students are
encouraged to challenge the ideas
presented in the texts through
their own personal experiences.
"The most inspiring thing
about the course is that the books
are held up to question," Williams
said.
