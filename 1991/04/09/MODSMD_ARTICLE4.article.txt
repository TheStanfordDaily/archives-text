# Official athletic director search to begin Friday
## 
### Judy Hsu Staff writer 
A search committee appointed by University
President Donald Kennedy will formally begin the
hunt for a new athletic director Friday.
Committee Chair Robert Freelen, vice president
for public affairs, said the five-week-old committee
will provide the president with a list of names that
will enable him to make the appointment early this
summer.
Although the nomination and application dead
line is still a few days away, more than 100 people
have already applied for the post. Applicants range
from "current athletic directors to people in busi
ness," Freelen said.
Committee members hope to find a new director
by the end of the quarter.
The vacancy was created when former Athletic
Director Andy Geiger resigned last September after
11 years at Stanford to become the athletic director
at the University of Maryland. Alan Cummings has
been the acting athletic director since then.
The applicant pool includes Assoc. Athletic Direc
tors Thomas Beckett and Cheryl Levick.
The committee is also considering people with
business experience like that of a chief executive offi
cer of a corporation, because the new director will
have to deal with the Department of Athletics' $2.1
million budget deficit. The new director, said men's
tennis coach Dick Gould, a committee member, will
be in charge of financial policies, dictating fiscal deci
sions that will affect all athletes and coaches.
Freelen said athletic departments at most major
universities share Stanford's financial woes. More
and more, athletic directors are becoming managers
of fiscal resources, he said.
He added that he doesn't know how many other
schools have former CEOs as heads of their athletic
departments. Several years ago, Notre Dame hired a
former business executive as an athletic director
Gould added that over the years he has worked
with three different athletic directors and that they
have all been very different people. He said he sees it
as an "oversimplification to assume that the search
committee is just looking for a CEO."
Graduate School of Business Prof. Jerry Porras,
the faculty representative to the committee, said, "I
am most struck with the incredible complexity of the
position," which involves working with a con
stituency of students, faculty and alumni.
In addition to Gould and the six faculty members
on the committee, football player Glyn Milburn and
alumnus Franklin Johnson, a Palo Alto business
man, will take part in the selection process.
Football coach Dennis Green said that qualities
like people management, fiscal responsibility and
public relations are critical, but the individual who
exhibits these qualities need not be a business exec
utive.
Freelen said other problems the new director
would face include incorporating and publicizing
new NCAA rules and dealing with the tasks of event
scheduling and recruiting.
Event scheduling, Green said, is complicated
because it causes income fluctuations. Football rev
enues were down this year because some important
games, like the one against Notre Dame, were not
played at Stanford.
He added that Stanford has the largest athletic
department budget in the nation. Football brings in
about 30 percent of the department's income.
