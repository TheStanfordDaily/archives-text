## Crusty curmudgeon Campbell told to leave Hoover office 
### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Staff writer 
The first strike against W.
Glenn Campbell came in 1986
when the University rejected his
proposition for a Ronald Reagan
Library and Policy Center on cam
pus.
In 1989, he was sent to the
showers from his job as director of
the Hoover Institution. Strike
Two.
Now Campbell is facing a new
pitch: President Herbert Hoover's
family wants to turn the eleventh
floor office in Hoover Tower used
by Campbell for nearly a decade
into a museum.
Strike three and Campbell is
out — of his office that is — but
the 66-year-old counselor and
adviser to the Hoover Institution
is crying foul.
"It's thoughtless and annoy
ing," Campbell said. "In the past
the University wanted to move
the headquarters of Stanford up
to this office. Now they want to
turn it into a museum. I just don't
understand it."

But in the mind of one Hoover
administrator, "It's an internal
matter." Deputy Hoover Director
Charles Palm said, "I'm not inter
ested in commenting on it."
Campbell, though, a high-spir
ited Hoover highbrow, may be in a
justifiable huff. When the contro
versial Campbell was replaced as
Hoover director following a 30-
year tenure, he was appointed as a
counselor to his successor, John
Raisian, as well as to other Hoover
fellows.
In his new position Campbell
receives a salary, estimated to be
$139,000 a year. As counselor he
is also entitled to remain in the
plush office until he dies or steps
down, according to a letter he
received from Provost James
Rosse.
But a letter sent to Campbell
from the Hoover family, dated
October 1990, states, "The family
wishes to convert the 11th floor
office to a museum" and to have it
"used as a museum area and
[keptl free of day-to-day office
activity."
The family explained a desire

to refurbish the office as part of
the ongoing $650,000 renovation
of the tower.
"Please do not regard a state
ment of our family's wishes as a
desire on our part to 'banish' you
or to 'punish' you for some
unspecified transgression," the
letter from the family continues.
But Campbell, who has long
maintained a tumultuous rela
tionship with his Hoover col
leagues and other University
administrators, suspects an ulte
rior motive — forcing him out.
"They want to restore this
office to the original state it was
during Hoover's lifetime," Camp
bell said. "The problem is most of
the things that used to be here
during Hoover's life aren't here.
They are in West Branch, lowa,"
were Hoover lived, he added.
Campbell said he thinks the
move is an unkind gesture to an
individual who not only was
responsible for making the
Hoover Institution independent
from the University but also
