# San Joaquin Valley to receive new UC campus
## Three sites still in running; school will open in 2000 
### Jon Gifford Staff writer 
The University of California has decided to open a
San Joaquin campus — the first of three expansion
schools — to meet projected growth in the student
population around the turn of the century.
The proposed site of this 10th University of Cali
fornia campus — scheduled to open in 2000 — has
been narrowed down to three locations: in the Fres
no, Madera or Merced counties of the San Joaquin
Valley.
The Lake Yosemite site, near Merced and
Yosemite National Park, is a 7,000-acre area. With
the Lake Yosemite recreation area near its south
west corner, the site lies east of Lake Boulevard in a
flat landscape that looks to the Sierras in the dis
tance. It is a short commute from the city of Merced,
a community of 56,000 people about 40 miles north
of Fresno and 90 miles south of Modesto.
The 16,000-acre Table Mountain site, located 15
miles west of Madera, borders the San Joaquin
River. Little Table Mountain, a distinctive geological
formation, lies in the northwest corner of the prop
erty.
The third site, located 25 miles northeast of down
town Fresno, is a 2,000 acre expanse of rolling, oak
studded hills.
The Board of Regents of University of California
decided in 1988 to expand the system and began the
search for a new campus site. Experts from different
consulting companies have advised the university
throughout the process, selecting three from more
than 60 potential sites.
Evaluations of these sites were based on such cri
teria as transportation, demographics, seismic safe
ty, site appeal, public support and environmental fac
tors.
University officials declined to explain specifically
why the final three sites were chosen, citing the con
fidential nature of the process and forthcoming
negotiations on land acquisition.
Yet despite the recent moves toward finalizing the
site for the new campus, state budget problems have
slowed the project.
According to a statement from Board of Regents'
President David Gardner, the campus will open in
2000, as opposed to the proposed 1998 date, due to
"the structurally embedded and politically
intractable nature of the State of California's fiscal
and budget problems to which there appears to be lit
tle likelihood of a foreseeable solution."
Gardner said he wants to decide on the site by the
first half of 1992.
