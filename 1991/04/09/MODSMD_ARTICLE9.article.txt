# Battling the knife
## Palo Alto man continues his fight against 'barbaric' circumcisions of newborns 
### Amy Gillett Staff writer 
Palo Alto resident Richard Angell
has declared war. He's battling the
medical industry that claimed his
foreskin 26 years ago and that con
tinues to perform circumcisions on
the majority of newborn boys in
America today.
The activist will not give up the
fight against circumcision until doc
tors cease to perform what he
describes as a "totally barbaric" oper
ation.
As a full-time activist, Angell
writes to hospitals throughout the
nation urging them to stop perform
ing the surgery and distributes fliers
entitled "Circumcision Why?"
around the Stanford campus and

Palo Alto.
Angell calls circumcision a "huge
conspiracy on the part of the medical
industry." According to Angell,
prominent pediatric organizations
have found that circumcision is an
unnecessary operation. Doctors con
tinue to perform the surgery for the
sole purpose of making money, he
says.
"Doctors at the Palo Alto clinic are
getting $125 per circumcision. That's
a lot of money for 10 minutes of
work," says Angell. He adds that his
dream is to sue the doctor who
"amputated" his body through cir
cumcision and made his foreskin
"one more in a large pickle-jar collec
tion."
"Circumcision Why?," published
by the National Organization of Cir

cumcision Information Resource
Centers (NOCIRC), says circumci
sions are performed without an anes
thetic, causing the infant to suffer
psychological and physical stress.
Angell believes the operation may
have long-standing traumatic effects.
"Could the circumcision have
something to do with why men are so
violent?" he asks.
The activist says he believes cir
cumcision reflects a double standard
and a basic "lack of care about how
men are treated in society." Girls are
protected against circumcision by
U.S. law, but allowing circumcision
violates a boy's basic human rights,
he says.
In addition to being a common
medical practice, circumcision is part

of Moslem and Jewish ritual. But
Angell says he believes the "child's
own inherent right to his own body is
more important than the parents'
right to their own religion." While
Angell is not Jewish, he says several
leading anti-circumcision activists
are.
Angell's convictions against cir
cumcision began during his days as a
Marine, when he saw his first "intact
penis" in a locker room. (Angell
insists on the usage of "intact" ver
sus uncircumcised.) At that point, he
realized his body "was missing some
thing." Later, as a student at Prin
cipia College, Angell watched a film
in which the infant Jesus was cir
cumcised. He says that while his
classmates giggled as Jesus
screamed, he quietly cringed in his
seat.
Angell's fight did not actually
begin until he read that circumcision
causes loss of sensitivity in the penis.
"That's the point when I got really
unhappy!" he exclaims. "That's when
I decided to do something about it."
He discovered that his voice of dis
content did not have to ring out alone
— he found four organizations whose
chorus welcomed his anti-circumci
sion song. He now works closely with
NOCIRC, based in San Anselmo,
Calif.
His activism has also extended far
beyond the state — he recently trav
eled to Boulogne, France, where he
swapped strategies on spreading pub
lic awareness with L'Association
Contre la Mutilation des Enfants, the
only anti-circumcision organization
in Europe.
At the end of this month, Angell
will volunteer at the Second Interna
tional Symposium on Circumcision
in San Francisco. During the four
day event, doctors and professors will
lecture on, among other things:
"Care of the Intact Penis" and "Cir
cumcision As An Equal Rights
Issue."
Angell is currently writing a book
— "Circumcision: A Victim Speaks
Out" — which he says will be an
important contribution to society.
While there are several books written
from the parents' point of view,
Angell says his work will be the first

written from the perspective of
the person circumcised.
Although Angell acknowledges
that circumcision is irreversible,
he says he is trying to restore part
of his foreskin to protect himself
against cold weather and chafing.
Employing a process known as
stretching, he has taped the vesti
gial skin in place over the tip of
his penis. Eventually the skin will
hold on its own, he explains.
"Within a few years, the major
ity of circumcised men will be
doing this," predicts Angell.
But one third-year medical
student says he does see how the
stretching process could work.
"The skin cannot grow back," he
asserts, adding that he will have
his boys circumcised for health
reasons.
Angell believes that circum
cised men who are not against the
surgery simply do not know any
better. "They don't realize what

they're missing."
He adds that the new protec
tion from the stretching proce
dure has provided him with great
comfort. "The first time I went
running with full coverage, I had
a huge smile on my face," pro
claims Angell, unabashedly. The
measure is somewhat makeshift,
adds Angell. "It's like having a
wooden leg. I'll never get full sen
sitivity back."
While Angell has rallied many
men to the anti-circumcision
cause, he says his parents, partic
ularly his mother, remain unsym
pathetic. She tells him "he's mak
ing a big deal over nothing" and
urges him to put it behind him.
Angell, however, has told her and
anyone else who will heed his bat
tle cry that he is not about to
allow a "permanent mutilation"
that has effected his entire life to
be forgotten.
When the struggle is won in
America, Angell says he will move
to the international front, in par
ticular to Africa, where circumci
sion is performed on girls.

getting $125 per circumcision. That's
a lot of money for 10 minutes of
work," says Angell. He adds that his
dream is to sue the doctor who
"amputated" his body through cir
cumcision and made his foreskin
"one more in a large pickle-jar collec
tion."
"Circumcision Why?," published
by the National Organization of Cir

cumcision Information Resource
Centers (NOCIRC), says circumci
sions are performed without an anes
thetic, causing the infant to suffer
psychological and physical stress.
Angell believes the operation may
have long-standing traumatic effects.
"Could the circumcision have
something to do with why men are so
violent?" he asks.
The activist says he believes cir
cumcision reflects a double standard
and a basic "lack of care about how
men are treated in society." Girls are
protected against circumcision by
U.S. law, but allowing circumcision
violates a boy's basic human rights,
he says.
In addition to being a common
medical practice, circumcision is part

of Moslem and Jewish ritual. But
Angell says he believes the "child's
own inherent right to his own body is
more important than the parents'
right to their own religion." While
Angell is not Jewish, he says several
leading anti-circumcision activists
are.
Angell's convictions against cir
cumcision began during his days as a
Marine, when he saw his first "intact
penis" in a locker room. (Angell
insists on the usage of "intact" ver
sus uncircumcised.) At that point, he
realized his body "was missing some
thing." Later, as a student at Prin
cipia College, Angell watched a film
in which the infant Jesus was cir
cumcised. He says that while his
classmates giggled as Jesus
screamed, he quietly cringed in his
seat.
Angell's fight did not actually
begin until he read that circumcision
causes loss of sensitivity in the penis.
"That's the point when I got really
unhappy!" he exclaims. "That's when
I decided to do something about it."
He discovered that his voice of dis
content did not have to ring out alone
— he found four organizations whose
chorus welcomed his anti-circumci
sion song. He now works closely with
NOCIRC, based in San Anselmo,
Calif.
His activism has also extended far
beyond the state — he recently trav
eled to Boulogne, France, where he
swapped strategies on spreading pub
lic awareness with L'Association
Contre la Mutilation des Enfants, the
only anti-circumcision organization
in Europe.
At the end of this month, Angell
will volunteer at the Second Interna
tional Symposium on Circumcision
in San Francisco. During the four
day event, doctors and professors will
lecture on, among other things:
"Care of the Intact Penis" and "Cir
cumcision As An Equal Rights
Issue."
Angell is currently writing a book
— "Circumcision: A Victim Speaks
Out" — which he says will be an
important contribution to society.
While there are several books written
from the parents' point of view,
Angell says his work will be the first

written from the perspective of
the person circumcised.
Although Angell acknowledges
that circumcision is irreversible,
he says he is trying to restore part
of his foreskin to protect himself
against cold weather and chafing.
Employing a process known as
stretching, he has taped the vesti
gial skin in place over the tip of
his penis. Eventually the skin will
hold on its own, he explains.
"Within a few years, the major
ity of circumcised men will be
doing this," predicts Angell.
But one third-year medical
student says he does see how the
stretching process could work.
"The skin cannot grow back," he
asserts, adding that he will have
his boys circumcised for health
reasons.
Angell believes that circum
cised men who are not against the
surgery simply do not know any
better. "They don't realize what

they're missing."
He adds that the new protec
tion from the stretching proce
dure has provided him with great
comfort. "The first time I went
running with full coverage, I had
a huge smile on my face," pro
claims Angell, unabashedly. The
measure is somewhat makeshift,
adds Angell. "It's like having a
wooden leg. I'll never get full sen
sitivity back."
While Angell has rallied many
men to the anti-circumcision
cause, he says his parents, partic
ularly his mother, remain unsym
pathetic. She tells him "he's mak
ing a big deal over nothing" and
urges him to put it behind him.
Angell, however, has told her and
anyone else who will heed his bat
tle cry that he is not about to
allow a "permanent mutilation"
that has effected his entire life to
be forgotten.
When the struggle is won in
America, Angell says he will move
to the international front, in par
ticular to Africa, where circumci
sion is performed on girls.
Palo Alto resident Richard Angell
has declared war. He's battling the
medical industry that claimed his
foreskin 26 years ago and that con
tinues to perform circumcisions on
the majority of newborn boys in
America today.
The activist will not give up the
fight against circumcision until doc
tors cease to perform what he
describes as a "totally barbaric" oper
ation.
As a full-time activist, Angell
writes to hospitals throughout the
nation urging them to stop perform
ing the surgery and distributes fliers
entitled "Circumcision Why?"
around the Stanford campus and

Palo Alto.
Angell calls circumcision a "huge
conspiracy on the part of the medical
industry." According to Angell,
prominent pediatric organizations
have found that circumcision is an
unnecessary operation. Doctors con
tinue to perform the surgery for the
sole purpose of making money, he
says.
"Doctors at the Palo Alto clinic are
getting $125 per circumcision. That's
a lot of money for 10 minutes of
work," says Angell. He adds that his
dream is to sue the doctor who
"amputated" his body through cir
