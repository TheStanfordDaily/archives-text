The current Science Bugs will be extinct in two short weeks.
If you think you could:
• Research Stanford's burning questions about science;
• Write a weekly column about the answers; and
• Adjust to a life full of action and adventure,
then this job is definitely your density, uh, destiny.
To apply, write three double-spaced pages answering two questions
about science. Turn them in at The Daily by Wednesday, April 17 at 5
P.M. Be funny, be informative, be sesquipedalian. Be anything. Be you.
