# Substantial drop in cost rate likely, Kennedy hints
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
University President Donald
Kennedy hinted last night that
Stanford's provisional indirect
cost rate will likely plummet at
week's end upon completion of
current negotiations between the
University and the Office of Naval
Research.
"We have been told to expect a
rate substantially lower than the
one we are operating under now,"
Kennedy said to a group of 300
students gathered in Kresge Audi
torium.
The new rate, Kennedy indi
cated, will remain in place at least
until the University can complete
new cost studies justifying higher
reimbursement on its libraries,
utilities and other aspects of its
indirect-cost recovery.

Several weeks ago, the Navy
informed Stanford that it no
longer considered valid the
methodologies the University had
used during the past decade to cal
culate costs. Stanford was told
that it would have to devise new
cost studies or revert to govern
ment "default" formulas for
determining costs.
The library study is expected to
take at least a year to conduct
because it involves tracking stu
dent-usage patterns in each aca
demic quarter. About $7 million of
the University's $12 million in
annual library reimbursements
are tied to the study. Other stud
ies, such as the one on utility allo
cation, may take only a few
months to conduct once the Navy
agrees on Stanford's proposed

methodology.
In the interim, the financial
impact is likely to be severe.
Kennedy told students to expect
"a season or two of very tight
belts."
Stanford began the year with a
proposed rate of 78 percent. Its
provisional rate now sits eight
points lower due to adjustments
made during the course of multi
ple federal investigations.
To the dismay of University
officials, federal auditors testified
before a congressional subcom
mittee last month that Stanford's
rate should be knocked down to 52
percent.
That would be a devastating
blow. Each one-point drop in indi

rect cost recovery translates into
about a $1.25 million annual loss
in revenue for the University. Indi
rect-cost recovery accounts for 30
percent of the operating budget.
During his address, Kennedy
said that a rate of 52 percent
would not be "fair or equitable."
Previously, administrators have
said they consider such an out
come "highly unlikely." Chief
Financial Officer William Massy
said last week that the audit
agency's recommendation was
"riddled with errors."
In a brief interview after his
talk, Kennedy said he could not
comment any further on what
may result from the negotiations.
He would only say that the rate
scheduled to be announced Friday
would likely be "substantially
lower" than 70 percent.
If Kennedy's bleak assessment

proves true, Stanford's budget
quagmire will worsen. Last week,
Provost James Rosse reported to
the Faculty Senate that another
sweeping round of budget cuts —
including possible elimination of
academic programs — lurks on
the horizon. In addition to falling
indirect-cost revenue, the long
term budget picture has been
clouded by the recession and dam
age from the Earthquake of 1989.
Last night Kennedy addressed
students at Kresge in conjunction
with a presentation by the Council
of Presidents. He did not speak
from a prepared text, but rather
promised to offer students an
assessment of the situation "as
candidly as I know how."
"I want to promise you that. . .
I understand your pain," he told
students. "I know what it feels
like."
