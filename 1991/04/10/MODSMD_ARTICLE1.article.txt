# Substantial drop in cost rate likely, Kennedy hints
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
University President Donald
Kennedy hinted last night that
Stanford's provisional indirect
cost rate will likely plummet at
week's end upon completion of
current negotiations between the
University and the Office of Naval
Research.
"We have been told to expect a
rate substantially lower than the
one we are operating under now,"
Kennedy said to a group of 300
students gathered in Kresge Audi
torium.
The new rate, Kennedy indi
cated, will remain in place at least
until the University can complete
new cost studies justifying higher
reimbursement on its libraries,
utilities and other aspects of its
indirect-cost recovery.

Several weeks ago, the Navy
informed Stanford that it no
longer considered valid the
methodologies the University had
used during the past decade to cal
culate costs. Stanford was told
that it would have to devise new
cost studies or revert to govern
ment "default" formulas for
determining costs.
The library study is expected to
take at least a year to conduct
because it involves tracking stu
dent-usage patterns in each aca
demic quarter. About $7 million of
the University's $12 million in
annual library reimbursements
are tied to the study. Other stud
ies, such as the one on utility allo
cation, may take only a few
months to conduct once the Navy
agrees on Stanford's proposed
