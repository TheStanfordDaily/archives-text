# COP urges student action during association speech
## 
### Howard Libit Staff writer 
The Council of Presidents
urged students to "think criti
cally" and "go out and do" during
its annual "State of the Associa
tion" address before about 300
students in Kresge Auditorium
last night.
The address preceded an expla
nation of the indirect-cost contro
versy by University President
Donald Kennedy. Following both
speeches, students questioned
Both Kennedy and the COP
Z Instead of giving its speech
jlirectly to the ASSU Senate at a
regular senate meeting, the CO£
composed of four graduating
Seniors, decided to deliver it to "a
targer forum in an attempt to
pommunicate more directly with .
t. the students," COP member
Goodwin Liu said in his introduc
tion.
* The COP attempted to "reflect
on student life at Stanford," COP
member Ingrid Nava said in the
&pen forum afterward. "We
focused on student life because
students make up" the ASSU.
Each member of the COP
emphasized the theme of critical
thinking while examining issues
including political correctness, the
scope of the ASSU and the Persian
Gulf war.
In Liu's address, he called on
all students to "reject the label of

political correctness in favor of
critical thinking."
He also urged students to
defend their beliefs. "It is only
when we take a stand that we can
lead from the depth of our com
mitments, from the well of our
convictions, from our passions
and our inner sense of urgency
about how we can make Stanford
and the world a better place."
Nava focused on the scope of
the ASSU, which some critics are
trying to limit to campus issues.
Nava suggested that instead of
limiting what the ASSU can do,
the organization should incorpo
rate more student input before
making decisions.
"And while it may not be for
everybody to work on these more
political aspects, the Council of
Presidents and the ASSU as a
whole must be free to do so if we
are to adequately respond to stu
dent interests and concerns,"
Nava said. "To not represent at all
is the worst kind of misrepresen
tation."
The effect of the Persian Gulf
war on students was addressed by
COP member Jamie Green.
Although many students had dif
ferent opinions, almost everyone's
life was altered by the war, and
people began to realize that their
beliefs are important, Green said.
"I heard too many people say
that the peace activists should
just give up because they couldn't

make a difference anyway. That
attitude revealed the frightening
passivity and acceptance of power
lessness that no Stanford student
should allow in her or himself,"
she said.
COP member Jay Tucker con
cluded the four speeches by
emphasizing community building
and the impact of Stanford stu
dents on the future.
"We no longer have to say, 'Our
time will come.' Our time has
come! Here, today, at Stanford,
our time has come. And we must
lead — today and tomorrow —
and solve some of the problems
that have plagued our society,"
Tucker said.
But the "State of the Associa
tion" address failed to satisfy
many students in attendance, as
evidenced by the often-harsh
questions.
"This speech took the form (of)
a sermon," one student com
plained during the open forum.
"What exactly is the state of the
association?"
Other students chose to attack
head-on many of the issues they
felt were neglected by the COR
Several students complained
about the lack of involvement of
graduate students in the ASSU,
especially in COP-sponsored
events such as last fall's leader
ship summit.
"Fewer than 10 percent of the

students in the leadership summit
were graduate students. This
amounts to a misrepresentation
and non-representation of gradu
ate students at Stanford," gradu
ate student Neil Crellin said.
But Liu responded by pointing
out that almost all of the 20 grad
uate senators refused to attend
despite personal invitations from
the COR
The COP also attempted to
defend ASSU actions on national
issues and de-emphasize the
importance of the Persian Gulf

bill passed last December.
"There are times when we have
to take leadership on issues like
the Persian Gulf war," Nava said.
"We always try to represent the
students in the best way possible."
Although no one on the current
COP is. running for a position in
next year's ASSU, some members
of the Students First party were
concerned that the People's Plat
form might gain an unfair advan
tage by speaking on the eve of
campaign week. They suggested
their party should get an equal

opportunity to respond.
"The idea that an open micro
phone constitutes a response is
not accurate because the COP is
constantly able to strike the last
word," Students First COP slate
member John Overdeck said. "It
just is not a productive dialogue."
But Liu countered that "any
one who wants to convene a press
conference outside of Kresge is
more than welcome to, and I am
sure that the press would cover
it."

COP member Goodwin Liu speaks to a Kresge crowd during last night's "State of the Association
address. Behind him, from left to right, are COP members Ingrid Nava, Jamie Green and Jay Tucker.
The Council of Presidents
urged students to "think criti
cally" and "go out and do" during
its annual "State of the Associa
tion" address before about 300
students in Kresge Auditorium
last night.
The address preceded an expla
nation of the indirect-cost contro
versy by University President
Donald Kennedy. Following both
speeches, students questioned
Both Kennedy and the COP
Z Instead of giving its speech
jlirectly to the ASSU Senate at a
regular senate meeting, the CO£
composed of four graduating
Seniors, decided to deliver it to "a
targer forum in an attempt to
pommunicate more directly with .
t. the students," COP member
Goodwin Liu said in his introduc
tion.
* The COP attempted to "reflect
on student life at Stanford," COP
member Ingrid Nava said in the
&pen forum afterward. "We
focused on student life because
students make up" the ASSU.
Each member of the COP
emphasized the theme of critical
thinking while examining issues
including political correctness, the
scope of the ASSU and the Persian
Gulf war.
In Liu's address, he called on
all students to "reject the label of

political correctness in favor of
critical thinking."
He also urged students to
defend their beliefs. "It is only
when we take a stand that we can
lead from the depth of our com
mitments, from the well of our
convictions, from our passions
and our inner sense of urgency
about how we can make Stanford
and the world a better place."
Nava focused on the scope of
the ASSU, which some critics are
trying to limit to campus issues.
Nava suggested that instead of
limiting what the ASSU can do,
the organization should incorpo
rate more student input before
making decisions.
"And while it may not be for
everybody to work on these more
political aspects, the Council of
Presidents and the ASSU as a
whole must be free to do so if we
are to adequately respond to stu
dent interests and concerns,"
Nava said. "To not represent at all
is the worst kind of misrepresen
tation."
The effect of the Persian Gulf
war on students was addressed by
COP member Jamie Green.
Although many students had dif
ferent opinions, almost everyone's
life was altered by the war, and
people began to realize that their
beliefs are important, Green said.
"I heard too many people say
that the peace activists should
just give up because they couldn't

make a difference anyway. That
attitude revealed the frightening
passivity and acceptance of power
lessness that no Stanford student
should allow in her or himself,"
she said.
COP member Jay Tucker con
cluded the four speeches by
emphasizing community building
and the impact of Stanford stu
dents on the future.
"We no longer have to say, 'Our
time will come.' Our time has
come! Here, today, at Stanford,
our time has come. And we must
lead — today and tomorrow —
and solve some of the problems
that have plagued our society,"
Tucker said.
But the "State of the Associa
tion" address failed to satisfy
many students in attendance, as
evidenced by the often-harsh
questions.
"This speech took the form (of)
a sermon," one student com
plained during the open forum.
"What exactly is the state of the
association?"
Other students chose to attack
head-on many of the issues they
felt were neglected by the COR
Several students complained
about the lack of involvement of
graduate students in the ASSU,
especially in COP-sponsored
events such as last fall's leader
ship summit.
"Fewer than 10 percent of the

students in the leadership summit
were graduate students. This
amounts to a misrepresentation
and non-representation of gradu
ate students at Stanford," gradu
ate student Neil Crellin said.
But Liu responded by pointing
out that almost all of the 20 grad
uate senators refused to attend
despite personal invitations from
the COR
The COP also attempted to
defend ASSU actions on national
issues and de-emphasize the
importance of the Persian Gulf

bill passed last December.
"There are times when we have
to take leadership on issues like
the Persian Gulf war," Nava said.
"We always try to represent the
students in the best way possible."
Although no one on the current
COP is. running for a position in
next year's ASSU, some members
of the Students First party were
concerned that the People's Plat
form might gain an unfair advan
tage by speaking on the eve of
campaign week. They suggested
their party should get an equal

opportunity to respond.
"The idea that an open micro
phone constitutes a response is
not accurate because the COP is
constantly able to strike the last
word," Students First COP slate
member John Overdeck said. "It
just is not a productive dialogue."
But Liu countered that "any
one who wants to convene a press
conference outside of Kresge is
more than welcome to, and I am
sure that the press would cover
it."
