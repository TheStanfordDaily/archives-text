Free speech at Stanford is back in the
limelight again.
In a nationally televised event, a group
of prominent journalists, academics and
other figures will meet at 4 p.m. today in
Tresidder Union's Oak Room for a round
table discussion on free speech and the
university.
The seminar, entitled "Free Speech,
Safe Speech and the University," is the
75th in a series moderated by Fred
Friendly and broadcast Sundays on
national public television.
Among the prominent figures who
have been attracted to Stanford for the
event are controversial CBS commenta
tor Andy Rooney, Yale University Presi
dent Benno C. Schmidt, Life magazine
Editor-at-Large Roger Rosenblatt and
American Civil Liberties Union President
Nadine Strossen.

Friendly, director of the Columbia Uni
versity Seminars on Media and Society, is
noted for his use of the Socratic method,
a questioning technique designed to test
the logical limits of a particular proposi
tion.
Although the Oak Room has a maxi
mum capacity of only 300, the ASSU
Speakers Bureau has set up a television
monitor in Tresidder for students eager
to watch the debate live and has arranged
for the seminar participants to meet with
interested students in the Tresidder
lobby immediately following the event.
Sponsored by the Corporation for Pub
lic Broadcasting and the Speakers
Bureau, the event has involved nearly a
year's planning and preparation, said
Steve Brown, a junior who is coordinating
the seminar. "This is our main event,"he
said. "We've got two years' worth of
speakers here."
The Speakers Bureau is spending

'This is our main event.
We've got two years' worth
of speakers here.'

The Corporation for Public Broadcast
ing is reimbursing the sororities for the
costs in moving to the Wilbur Fields.
Originally conceived as a way of com
memorating the 200 th anniversary of the
signing of the Bill of Rights, the seminar
began to take shape during the summer
after Stanford received widespread
national attention for revising its Funda
mental Standard interpretation to pro
hibit certain kinds of racist speech,
Ermoian said.
Nat Hentoff, an outspoken columnist
for the Washington Post who will be
attending the seminar, went so far as to

roughly half its annual budget of $29,500
on travel expenses for the 15 speakers
and a $3,500 honorarium for Friendly,
but the total costs of the event could be 10
times that," said junior Ralph Ermoian,
director of the Speakers Bureau. The Cor
poration for Public Broadcasting is pay
ing the rest of the costs.
The arrival of television crews has
required a "Herculean effort" to resched
ule student groups that had planned to
use the Oak Room this week, said Vicki
Baker, meeting services coordinator at
Tresidder.
While no student activities have been
canceled, sorority Rush has been moved
from Tresidder to Wilbur Field to accom
modate more than 30 television crew
members and their equipment. "Origi
nally when I heard about it, I thought it
would be a hassle," said senior Betsy
Bochenek, chair of sorority Rush, "but
it's worked out great."

accuse University President Donald
Kennedy of joining the "speech police" by
approving the new Fundamental Stan
dard interpretation.
"It was disturbing to call home and
have everyone think it was ' 1984' at Stan
ford," Brown said. "Stanford got so much
attention, but it was all whittled down to
one-liners," he added.
Beth Howe, former director of the
Speakers Bureau, spent the summer and
most of the fall attempting to get Friendly
to moderate the event. Once Friendly
agreed, the Speakers Bureau had to deal
with stringent demands from the televi
sion personnel, who rejected Kresge and
Dinkelspiel Auditoriums as possible sites
for the seminar and insisted on tfte Onk
Room because of its lighting.
The seminar will be broadcast locally
on KQED (Channel 9) April 15 at 10 p.m.
and will air nationally on PBS June 6, 10
p.m.
