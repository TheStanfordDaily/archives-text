U.N. authorizes peacekeeping
force on Iraq-Kuwait border
UNITED NATIONS (AP) - The U.N. Secu
rity Council yesterday unanimously estab
lished a 1,440-member peacekeeping force to
monitor the Iraq-Kuwait border and the with
drawal of U.S. forces from southern Iraq.
The 15-member council, however, delayed
its formal declaration of a cease-fire in the war
until Iraq delivers the report of its National
Assembly accepting onerous U.N. terms for a
permanent cease-fire. A formal end to the war
is expected to be announced today.
Rhode Island requests bailout
WASHINGTON (AP) — Rhode Island's
governor and senators pleaded yesterday for a
federal bailout of the state's private deposit
insurance system, saying the state has been
plunged into a financial crisis even worse than
it suffered during the Great Depression.
Gov. Bruce Sundlun, a Democrat, shut
down 35 credit unions and 10 banks on New
Year's Day after the private Rhode Island
Share and Deposit Indemnity Corp. collapsed.
Gates returns to work
LOS ANGELES (AP) — A beaming Police
Chief Daryl F. Gates marched back to work
yesterday and said his critics are more con
cerned about whether he keeps his job than the
vicious police beating of motorist Rodney King.
"I think a lot of people have forgotten about
Rodney King. I don't think those people really
care about Rodney King at all," Gates said,
referring to a handful of protesters outside
police headquarters.
