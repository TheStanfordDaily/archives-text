# Israel agrees to talks with Arabs, Soviets
##

JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel informed the United
States yesterday that it was willing to hold peace
talks with the Arab nations under American aus
pices and with the participation of the Soviet Union.
"I hope that the U.S. will succeed in getting agree
ment of the other parties," Foreign Minister David
Levy said, underscoring that Israel's aim was to have
direct negotiations with its neighbors on their 43-
year conflict.
Secretary of State James A. Baker 111 welcomed
the Israeli move, which came at the start of four days
of talks with Mideast leaders, as "very constructive."
However, Baker added, "there is a long, long way
to go. There are many, many parties involved. There
are lots of questions before us that have to be
addressed."
If Baker, who meets later in the week with Egyp
tian, Saudi, Syrian and Jordanian leaders, can gain
their approval for regional peace talks, it would be a
breakthrough on what he has called "the most
intractable problem in diplomacy — the Arab-Israeli
dispute."
Initial reactions from Egypt's state-owned news
paper and from Palestinian leaders were hardly pos
itive.
On the eve of Baker's visit to Cairo, the newspa
per Al-Ahram said Egypt still views an international
peace conference — not the regional conference
Israel and Baker are talking about — as the proper
framework for settling Arab-Israeli disputes.
And Palestinian leaders said their talks yesterday
with Baker revealed no apparent change in Ameri
can or Israeli policies toward the territories occupied
by Israel. "Really, we can't tell you about anything
encouraging out of this meeting, " said Dr. Haydar al-
Shafi, one of six Palestinians who met with Baker.
Levy reaffirmed a 1989 Israeli offer to hold elec
tions on the West Bank and Gaza leading to limited
Palestinian self-rule.
The peace conference, as he described it, did not
call for Palestinian participation. However, he said
later on Israeli television that Palestinians should

"be part of a Jordanian delegation, with representa
tives from Judea, Samaria (the West Bank) and Gaza
who are not PLO."
Among other details to be resolved are when and
where peace talks would be held.
Baker met with Levy and then with Prime Minis

ter Yitzhak Shamir, who had set a positive tone for
his stop in Israel by announcing some 1,200 Pales
tinian prisoners would be released this weekend.
The secretary of state will see Shamir again this
morning before flying to Cairo for talks with Egyp
tian and Saudi officials.
