# Georgians demand independence

MOSCOW (AP) — The Georgian Parliament yes
terday declared the republic's independence, follow
ing the three Baltic states in a bold but largely sym
bolic step toward secession.
It was unlikely that Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and the national legislature would recog
nize the Georgia declaration, but it could lead to
more concrete steps toward autonomy, such as cre
ation of a separate currency and economic system.
The Baltic republics — Lithuania, Latvia and
Estonia — have begun negotiations with Moscow on
independence, but progress has been slow. Gor
bachev has insisted the republics have a right to
secede, but only if they follow a legal process that
could take five years or more.
On March 31, 98 percent of Georgian voters cast
ballots endorsing independence from the Soviet
Union. Gorbachev called the poll invalid.
Georgian President Zviad Gamsakhurdia has
begun building a Georgian army, and has called for a
faster transition to a free-market economy than the
central Soviet government has been making.
The declaration was based on Georgia's indepen
dence resolution of May 26, 1918, which granted
Georgians living in the former Russian Empire the
right of self-determination, the official Soviet news
agency Tass reported.
"By this move, Georgia followed the example of
the Baltic republics, which are seeking secession
from the Soviet Union," Tass said.
Georgia, a multi-ethnic republic of 5.3 million peo
ple wedged between the Caucasus Mountains and
the Black Sea, proclaimed independence from the
Russian Empire near the end of World War I, but
was forcibly absorbed into the Soviet Union nearly
three years later and incorporated under a 1924
Union Treaty.
The declaration comes amid sporadic fighting
between ethnic Georgians and South Ossetians that
has claimed more than 50 lives in recent months.
South Ossetians, mostly Muslims, want to be an
autonomous republic loyal to the Kremlin, while the
mainly Christian Georgians want to secede.
In an address urging the Georgian legislature to
pass the declaration, Gamsakhurdia accused the
Soviet government of massing 1,500 troops in South
Ossetia. He sent a telegram to Gorbachev on Sunday
demanding withdrawal of the troops.
