# Cambodians face famine after U.S. withdraws aid

CAMBODIA (AP) â€” Thousands of
civilians who fled fighting in guerrilla
held northwest Cambodia now face star
vation, according to rebel officials who
are angry at the United States for cut
ting off aid.
Thousands of hungry and weary
refugees were seen living in desperate
conditions throughout this northwest
ern province during a three-day trip
through guerrilla territory ending Sun
day.
Many refugees live in remote jungles
and scrubland with little food, water or
prospect of emergency medical aid.
Prince Norodom Rannariddh, a guer
rilla commander and son of former Cam
bodian head of state Prince Norodom
Sihanouk, said the Sihanouk guerrillas
have received no U.S. aid since January.
"This is a crisis. Within a month peo
ple will starve to death. We need rice and
salt," said Chim Siek Lieng, who runs
the civilian administration for the
Sihanouk guerrillas in parts of north
west Cambodia.
"Without at least rice and salt, I
believe about 20 percent of the people
will starve by next month and 70 percent
within four months," he said.
In Washington, State Department
spokesman Richard Boucher said Mon
day he had no official reaction to the
rebels' complaints.
Congress in October ordered a phase
out of a $13 million covert aid program
that helped fund the two non-Commu
nist rebel groups: Sihanouk guerrillas
and the Khmer People's Liberation
Front.
They and the Communist Khmer
Rouge, the dominant rebel group, are
fighting the Vietnamese-installed gov

ernment in Phnom Penh.
In place of the covert aid, the current
U.S. foreign aid bill provided a broader
$20 million aid and development fund
for rebel-held areas, aimed at encourag
ing a peaceful end to the conflict.
Another $5 million was approved for aid
ing children inside Cambodia.
State Department officials reached
Monday said the new money has not yet
been spent. Aid for International Devel
opment spokesman John Metelsky said a
team was in Cambodia assessing where
the money could best be used.
U.S. officials feared that direct aid to
the rebels would help the Khmer Rouge
return to power. Hundreds of thousands
of Cambodia's 8 million people died in
Khmer Rouge executions, famine and
civil unrest from 1975-78.
Meanwhile, a wave of refugees has
streamed to all four Cambodian factions.
United Nations officials in government
controlled territory report thousands of
new refugees in recent weeks, and esti
mate Phnom Penh will need at least
100,000 tons of rice aid because of the
drought and fighting.
Residents from entire villages who
fled to this isolated region say they lack
food, water and medical care. Refugees
had fled from both government and
guerrilla-controlled zones.
Some were sick and others had
untreated wounds. Many had camped
for weeks, fleeing empty-handed after
their villages were burned in heavy
fighting.
"We have no food here, but we cannot
go back to our village because there is no
food and it is bombed every day," said
Samroang village chief Nak Num, 48,
who had an untreated bullet wound.
