## Cleaning out 'guts' 
### 
STANFORD SHOULDN'T have
any "gut" majors;'they incur
the resentment of students in
other majors and devalue the work
of students in the department.
Responding to criticism from
undergraduates and recent alumni,
the Economics Department is plan
ning to modify the requirements of
its major, which currently allows
students to complete either a Per
spectives and Policies track, or a
more mathematical Quantitative
Economics track.
The Perspectives and Policies
track of the major is widely regard
ed as easy. Its requirements can be
completed in a year, and an over
whelming number of economics
majors supplement their study
with a second major.
Thus, the department's faculty
are considering a number of

changes, which include increasing
the required number of course
units from 45 to 55 and abandon
ing the separation of the tracks in
favor of a single track which
requires students to understand
mathematics at the level of Calcu
lus 41.
Increasing the rigor of the eco
nomics major is a welcome change.
However, unless the department
includes the core quantitative eco
nomics courses (Economics 102,
103 and 104) in the new major, it
will be phasing out the quantitative
major — in favor of what is essen
tially the Perspectives track.
This would discredit the efforts
of students who take the quantita
tive courses, giving their work the
same degree — and level of respect
— as the easier Perspectives eco
nomics major.
