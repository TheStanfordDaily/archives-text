# Make the best cuts
## 
### 
The next round of the
University's budget cuts will
include academic programs,
and the University can count on a
protracted conflict over which
departments and programs will be
affected.
Provost James Rosse announced
last week that cuts will likely affect
recently formed programs and pro
grams with smaller student inter
est.
That may mean taking a look at
some programs, like Asian-Ameri
can studies, that have a political
role on campus and which some
student groups have fought to
obtain.
There shouldn't be any academ
ic sacred cows. If cuts need to be
made in a particular department,
they should be made, regardless of
how political that cut may be and
how vocal the more political stu
dent groups on campus are likely to
be in opposing the cuts.

Obviously, no one wants his or
her department or program to be
trimmed. But budget cuts are a
financial reality which every pro
gram, no matter how politically
correct, must face. To exempt any
program from fiscal streamlining is
to place an unfair burden on the
University's other departments.
The administration can avoid
projecting the image of arbitrari
ness by announcing ahead of time a
clear, well-defined set of criteria for
making the budgetary decisions.
Logical criteria for making bud
get cuts would include the efficien
cy of departments and the number
of students who take courses in or
major in a particular department
per dollar the University spends on
it. Student input should play a fun
damental role. Politics should not.
Simply put, the University does
not have the money to be all things
to all people.
