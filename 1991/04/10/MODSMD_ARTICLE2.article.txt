# Harvard to withdraw cost claims
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
Harvard Medical School
— the next target of Rep.
John Dingell's indirect-cost
probe — said yesterday it
would withdraw close to
$500,000 from its overhead
submission to the govern
ment this year.
The move, a clear attempt to
avoid a publicity fiasco similar to
Stanford's, was met with favor by
Dingell, the powerful chair of the
House Subcommittee on Over
sight and Investigations.
"While Harvard appears to
have had problems similar to
those encountered at Stanford,
Harvard deserves credit for taking
the initiative in determining the
extent of the problem and trying
to fix it,"the Michigan Democrat
said. "The difference in the
responses of the two universities
is like night and day."
Harvard's announcement
comes several months into an
internal review of its accounting
system launched with the assis
tance of Big Six accounting firm
Coopers & Lybrand.
Among the items withdrawn by
Harvard were:
• All expenses related to the
residence of its university presi
dent,
• $60,000 in accounting errors
related to the university's tech
nology licensing office and the
Harvard Medical Center office,
• A $7,500 contribution to
Boston public schools, and
• A $3,200 retirement recep
tion for a senior dean.
In addition, Harvard said it was
taking several steps to strengthen
its accounting system, including
greater training for those who
enter transactions into the sys
tem.
The Harvard initiative follows
closely on the heels of a similar
step by Caltech, another univer
sity likely to receive close scrutiny
by Dingell's subcommittee. Fed
eral auditors testified at the Stan
ford hearing on March 13 that
Caltech had recently withdrawn

$500,000 in indirect costs of
research from the past three
years.
The expenses included golf and
health club memberships, an
$80,000 board of trustees meeting
in Palm Springs and various food
and beverage costs.
Both the Harvard and Caltech
withdrawals were driven by "the
fear of God and the fear of Din
gell," a congressional investigator
said, speaking on the condition of
anonymity. The initiatives would
likely spare the schools "some of
the embarrassment of the front
page of the Sunday paper," she
said.
At last month's hearing, Din
gell urged "universities across the
country who engage in govern
ment research" to review their
charges and take appropriate
actions if they found any inappro
priate costs. If universities did not
initiate such reviews on their own,
Dingell promised, the schools
would "receive the vigorous and
the kindly assistance of the sub
committee."
In January, Stanford withdrew
about $500,000 in expenses asso
ciated with University-owned res
idences and hired Arthur Ander
sen to review its accounting sys
tem. The move, which came sev
eral months into the subcommit
tee's probe, was criticized by con
gressional investigators as being
"too little, too late."
A Dingell aide said yesterday
that the subcommittee will likely
hold another hearing in June, this
time focusing on the practices of
Harvard Medical School and MIT.
Unlike Stanford, Harvard uses
separate recovery rates for its
medical school and for research
conducted in other parts of the
university.
The subcommittee has only
conducted a preliminary review of
MIT, but has reason to believe
there are similar problems there

as well, a congressional investiga
tor said.
And, depending upon the out
come of current negotiations
between Stanford and the Navy,
she said, it is possible that Stan
ford could have another face-to
face meeting with Dingell.
"We hope that they've learned
their lesson," she said. "But we'd
be happy to bring them back."
In a separate development yes
terday, Department of Health and
Human Services officials identi
fied nine more universities that
that department will begin audit
ing within the next few weeks.
Health and Human Services plays
an oversight role similar to that of
the Office of Naval Research at
hundreds of universities.
According to a spokesperson
from the department, investiga
tors have begun looking at two
schools — Duke University and
Emory University. Seven other
schools have been notified that
audits will begin shortly: Rutgers
University, the University of
Chicago, the University of Michi
gan, the University of Texas
Southwest Medical Center, Wash
ington University in St. Louis, the
University of Southern California
and the University of Pittsburgh.
Last week, the department said
audits had begun at Yale Llniver
sity, the University of Pennsylva
nia, Johns Hopkins University
and Dartmouth College.
