## It shouldn't be a big deal 
### 
ING-A-LING-A-LING," went
lthe phone. I was in no mood to
J—/ answer it. Classes had just fin
ished for the day, and I wanted to col
lapse. I'd just managed to convince myself
that there really wasn't anything all that
wrong with taking a nap at 5:30 in the
afternoon, and here was someone bent on
ruining it.
The phone, of course, had little sympa
thy.
"Ding-a-ling-a-ling," it persisted.
I groaned and picked it up. I should
have been pleased to find that it was Bill,
a friend from back home, calling long dis
tance, but I wasn't. Bill's temper had
been short lately, because of some sort of
problem he'd been having with his family,
and I just didn't want to deal with it.
Bill's tone now was more strange than
irascible. He made pleasantries, then
started quizzing me about my opinion on
a court case in Los Angeles involving a
man who had been fired for being homo
sexual. I wasn't sure what Bill was get
ting at, but I hoped he'd hang up soon.
I didn't catch on at all until Bill told me
he was gay.
He tried to say it casually, as if telling
me what the weather was like, or that
he'd chosen a major, but the remark was
clearly more than an offhand one for him.
His voice softened, and he spoke more
slowly as he told me what he'd gone
through over the last two months.
He'd sent a letter to his parents, and
their response had not been gentle. His
father asked how someone so intelligent
could do something so stupid and threat
ened to stop paying for his education. As

a parting blow, he made sure to tell Bill
that AIDS is God's way of "punishing the
homosexuals." His grandfather picked up
the discourse in the same vein by telling
him to repent.
I told Bill that his life sounded like a
Newsweek cover story, and he laughed
and said that was just about how it felt.
The topic was serious, certainly, but jok
ing seemed appropriate. It made both of
us more comfortable and made his sexual
ity less of a big deal.
By the time Bill hung up, I was happy.
A friend had trusted me enough to put his
reputation, not to mention his feelings, in
my hands. And I had responded as I'd
always hoped I would if someone decided
to come out to me — by being sympa
thetic and by letting him know that it was
no big deal.
But it is a big deal. I've had a difficult
time thinking about anything else since
Bill called me last week, and now I'm
writing about it.
There shouldn't be columns about
homosexuality, or "coming out"; those
things should be such an ordinary part of
everyday life that no one should care. I
shouldn't care. But the fact is that I'm a
product of a society and a campus that
stigmatize homosexuality to the point of
invisibility, so that when a friend tells me
that he's gay, it shakes my world.
It's easy to blame ignorant parents for
the shame and fear that, gays and lesbians
our age feel, but the real enemy is us. The
fact that nine out of 10 homosexuals at
Stanford choose to conceal their sexuality
has little to do with hostile parents.
As we've attempted so fervently to

eliminate prejudice, we've kept homopho
bia as our little pet bigotry — excusable, if
not acceptable. We may not agree with the
simplistic lesson that homosexuality is
immoral because God trays so, but we take
shelter under its aegis to excuse our feel
ings that gay sex is "gross" or "dirty" or
"queer," and that people indulging in it
should be kept away from us.
A few months ago, I went to visit some
friends and found them trading homosex
ual jokes, squirming at the idea of anal
intercourse. These are some of the most
kind-hearted and open-minded people 1
know, but I wouldn't want to tell them if
I were gay.
The environment could be worse, I
suppose; one woman from my dorm last
year thought that all homosexuals should
be put on an island and nuked.
Bill called again the next day, and we
talked about his sexuality and his par
ents, but we talked about other things as
well and had a good time. Our little secret
has made us better friends, I think, and
I'm glad about that.
But I can't help thinking that our
secret is tainted by the sordid, shameful
fact that it has to be a secret in the first
place.

Ed Heinemann plans to take a nap this
afternoon; call, and wake him up
