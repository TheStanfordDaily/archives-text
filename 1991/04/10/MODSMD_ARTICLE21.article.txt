## COP member challenges senator's ASSU prescription 
### 
lAM TROUBLED BY THE WAY John
Overdeck's April 8 letter addresses
the notions of community service,
representation and leadership.
Overdeck draws a dangerous distinc
tion between tutoring East Palo Alto
schoolchildren on the one hand and
addressing state and national educa
tional policy on the other. He can sup
port tutoring, but he can't support advo
cacy for increased state educational
funding. Why?
Apparently, Overdeck misses the con
nection between service and advocacy.
What good is tutoring underprivileged
children without simultaneous efforts to
rectify the conditions that cause these
children to be underprivileged in the
first place?
Overdeck's message reminds me —
yet again — of the eager volunteer who
returns from a day of service saying,
"Wasn't that a great experience? I hope
my kids have a chance to do that some
dav."

Tutoring is just one aspect of creating
equal educational opportunity for East
Palo Alto schoolchildren. Lobbying, testi
fying, and advocating on their behalf in
Sacramento — where state educational
policy is made — are all part of the same
effort.
Community service, when done out
side of that broader context, is Band-Aid
work. We can't just address the symp
toms of social problems; we need to treat
the disease.
It is with this mindset that the Coun
cil of Presidents strives to respond to
student interests, both on and off cam
pus. Drawing a definitional line between
"student" and "non-student" issues is
both impossible and undesirable.
Students at Stanford are also resi
dents of California, the United States,
and our globe. Hence, we have responsi
bilities to the many spheres we inhabit,
and thousands of students — through
their public service and political activism
— have demonstrated that they take

these responsibilities seriously.
Many students do not want to be asso
ciated with the "ivory tower" image.
They see themselves as part of larger
societies and communities. Thus the
ASSU, as a representative body, has a
responsibility to respond to and support
student efforts, no matter where they lie.
The all-important question is about
accountability. The ASSU's accountabil
ity can and should be improved through
increased contact between students and
their representatives.
But it is a disservice to students who
care about social change to restrict the
ASSU's representative capability.
One last point: Overdeck calls for stu
dent leaders to be non-partisan and neu
tral.
President Kennedy wrote last spring,
"[Stanford's] central purpose is the
development of new leadership for this
society." This society — with its inade
quacies in education, its environmental
degradation, racism and poverty — will

require leadership that is NOT apolitical,
unopinionated and non-partisan. It will
require leaders and public servants who
will buck the status quo and who will let
a self-developed notion of justice guide
their actions. And as Kennedy says, our
leadership development begins here on
the Farm.
Some say Stanford students are apa
thetic. I don't believe them. Every stu
dent is intelligent; every student cares
about something. Together, let's accept
the challenge to probe, to question, to
reconcile, to be not just a critic but a crit
ical thinker, and not to abdicate our
responsibility to think and to act on our
beliefs.
It is only when we take a stand that
we can lead from the depth of our com
mitments, from the well of our convic
tions, from our passions, and our inner
sense of urgency about how we can make
Stanford and the world a better place.
