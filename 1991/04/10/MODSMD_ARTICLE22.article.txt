THE RECENT EDITORIAL regard
ing the new position of program
assistant was both frivolous and
uninformed. Several of the assumptions
made in the editorial need clarification.
It is true many residents of the Row
are looking for an alternative to dorm
life. However, escaping the Office of Resi
dential Education is not on the minds of
most such students.
Many upperclass students enjoy the
tightly knit communities of the smaller
houses found on the Row — not just the
better and more affordable food and the
nicer rooms. In fact, one of the primary
goals of Res Ed is to build strong com
munities where people learn from each
other. A house with 50 people can do this
much better than one with 300.

There is enthusiasm on the Row for
programs. Programs are more than just
half-hour, campus group-led ordeals after
dinner. In Whitman this year, we have
gone to countless cultural events, hosted
a faculty dinner, created an interactive
weekly movie series and taken house
trips exploring the Bay Area.
Furthermore, the results of the recent
residence life surveys indicate the one
quarter of the student body that live on
the Row want more programming.
How's that for enthusiasm?
Row resident assistants are overtaxed.
As the only University representative in
the house, the non-theme house RA
shoulders many of the responsibilities
shared by the RAs, the theme associates
and the resident fellows in other houses.

Such responsibilities include community
building, administrative detail, academic
as well as personal counseling and pro
gramming duties.
Although most RAs do not choose the
job for financial reasons, the 25 percent
pay cut next year for Row RAs may force
some to find additional means of subsi
dizing their education. As a result, they
will have less time to fulfill their roles.
Thus, the need for PAs.
Res Ed should not focus solely on resi
dences such as larger, four-class or fresh
man dorms. While Row RAs may not be
leading cheers at football games, enforc
ing quiet hours or deciphering the Time
Schedule for freshmen, they are making
an impact by helping students make
decisions about life.

You may not consider guidance in
choosing a major, finding a job, taking
MCATs or helping with other personal
problems making a big impact, but we
are sure that you could find many Row
residents who feel otherwise.
Given the large number of activities
in which Row residents would like to
participate and the large number of roles
Row RAs already have to fill, it seems
trite and narrow to criticize the forma
tion of a useful and unpaid position, the
PA.
