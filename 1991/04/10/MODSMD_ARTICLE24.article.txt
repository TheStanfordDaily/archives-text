## J.T.S. Moore Will the Brady Bill make America safe from handguns? 
### 
Last week, the daily ran a
political cartoon about Leroy, a fic
tional member of the National
Rifle Association, that bastion of gun
lovers. As depicted in the cartoon, Leroy,
and by implication, most NRA members,
are Uzi-toting, rural types that suffer
certain mental deficiencies, like the
inability to count to seven. That is seven,
as in the seven-day waiting period pro
posed by the Brady Bill. The truth be
known, I have actually met people who
are like Leroy, except they can count well
beyond seven, speak in complete sen
tences, use polysyllabic words and make
reasoned arguments, especially when it
comes to gun control.
Cartoons such as the one depicting
Leroy attempt to advocate the Brady Bill
by ridiculing the NRA instead of address
ing the issues. The Brady Bill is not
about whether or not the NRA should
continue to exist. The bill is about trying
to make America safer by inhibiting your
average American's right to purchase
handguns.
The Brady Bill (House Resolution 7)
receives its name from former White
House Press Secretary James Brady. On
March 30, 1981, Brady was shot in the
head during John Hinckley's assassina
tion attempt on President Reagan.
Hinckley, who used a handgun, was later
ruled mentally incompetent. During the
mid-1980s, Sarah Brady, Brady's wife,
became involved with Handgun Control,
Inc. The goal of HCI was, and still is, to
prevent people like Hinckley from
obtaining handguns by mandating a
nationwide, seven-day waiting period

and background check for all handgun
purchases.
As Americans continue to be inun
dated with reports and images of homi
cides involving handguns, a seven-day
waiting period with a background check
would appear to be a modest proposal.
Why then does the NRA oppose the
Brady Bill? After all, according to opin
ion polls, a majority of Americans sup
port a waiting period. The easy answer is
that the NRA is out of touch with reality.
However, such a response is too simple.
The fact of the matter is the NRA,
unlike most Americans, actually spends
a great deal of time thinking about the
practical application of the Brady Bill.
The NRA opposes the bill because it
restricts liberty while failing to make
America safer in return.
There are over 200 million firearms
in America. It is estimated that more
than 60 percent of Americans own one or
more firearms. Of the total number of
firearms, 60 to 70 million are estimated
to be handguns. Like it or not, the sheer
number of firearms in America means
they are here to stay. Most proponents
and opponents of gun control agree that
the practical abolition of firearms would
be impossible to achieve. The real ques
tion, then, is how legally accessible
firearms should be.
The Brady Bill seeks to prevent the
purchase of handguns by convicted
felons and the mentally incompetent.
Both HCI and the NRA agree on this
point. That is why the NRA endorses
instant background checks. In other
words, the NRA advocates a system in

which a gun dealer would check your eli
gibility in the same way that he or she
checks your credit card. Last year in Vir
ginia, HCI and the NRA worked together
to enact legislation to this end. Where
HCI and the NRA differ over the Brady
Bill is on the seven-day waiting period.
That is why the NRA supports House
Resolution 1412, a bill that would insti
tute a nationwide instant background
check.
The supporters of the Brady Bill
argue that the seven-day period serves
two purposes. First, it provides time for
the police to run the background check.
Second, the seven days act as a cooling
off period. The first purpose is under
mined by the fact that if the information
needed to run the check is properly com
piled, a background check can be run
instantly.
According to the NRA, the argument
for a cooling-off period is also flawed.
The idea behind a cooling-off period is
that it reduces crimes of passion and acts
as an overall deterrent to handgun
related crime. Analysis of gun ownership
by James Wright of the University of
Massachusetts indicates that between 75
and 80 percent of gun purchasers
already own a firearm. Furthermore,
argument-precipitated murders most fre
quently occur between 10 p.m. and 3
a.m., a time period well after the closing
of virtually all gun stores. Thus, it is
unlikely that a waiting period would hin
der an individual's access to a firearm.
The perception that a crime of passion
is the result of a sudden overflow of emo
tion is also contradicted bv reality. A

study in Kansas City indicated in 90 per
cent of spouse-slayings, there had been
at least one prior police visit concerning
wife beating. Most crimes of passion are
not spontaneous eruptions, but the
tragic result of escalating abuse that the
police might have prevented
Generally speaking, the NRA opposes
waiting periods because their failure to
prevent handgun-related murders is
undeniable. According to the 1988 FBI
Uniform Crime Report, Washington,
D.C., with the strictest gun laws in the
nation (virtual prohibition), had a homi
cide rate of 59.5 per 100,000 residents.
In El Paso, Texas, a similarly sized city
with lenient gun laws, the homicide rate
was 6.2 per 100,000 residents.
Closer to home, between 1965 and
1987, California increased its waiting
period on handguns from two to 15 days,
but with little success. During that time,
homicide in the United States increased
by 62.7 percent. In California the homi
cide rate increased by 125.5 percent.
More recently, the California waiting
, period has failed to prevent several
highly publicized tragedies. For instance,
Patrick Purdy, who gunned down five
Stockton school children in 1989, passed
a waiting period and background check
even though he had a criminal record.
Further calling to question the useful
ness of waiting periods, is the fact that
by even the most generous estimates,
only one-sixth of all criminals buy their
firearms legally.
As far as the Reagan assassination
attempt is concerned, the Brady Bill
absolutely would not have deterred

Hinckley. Hinckley had already owned
the gun he used for over four months. A
background check would have revealed
that Hinckley had no criminal record,
had never been declared mentally incom
petent and had a valid Texas driver's
license. The contention that Hinckley's
statement of a false address would have
been discovered is patently incorrect. In
states that currently conduct back
ground checks, such as California, the
police have neither the resources nor the
desire to check an applicant's place of
residence.
The Brady Bill contains several other
controversial provisions. The language of
the bill states the waiting period does not
begin until the chief law enforcement
officer acknowledges receipt of the pur
chase application. Nothing in the bill
requires the chief law enforcement offi
cer to make that acknowledgement. Con
sequently, every law-abiding citizen could
be prohibited from purchasing a gun as a
result of a police chief s inaction or bias.
This is not some unfounded paranoia.
This is actually what happens in Mas
sachusetts and is similar to what hap
pens in California regarding the issuance
of gun permits. Finally, the Brady Bill
contains a tremendously vague definition
of a handgun.
It is with these reasons in mind that I
urge you think about the Brady Bill.
Look beyond the stereotypes and
unfounded reasoning. That is what I did.
