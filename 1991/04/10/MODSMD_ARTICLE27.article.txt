## Researchers find clue to immune defect 
### Lisa Goldman 
Stanford researchers have discovered a
vital clue to a defect in the immune system
that causes immune cells to attack other
parts of the body and cause disease. They
may have found a long-hidden source of
many currently incurable illnesses, includ
ing some types of arthritis and diabetes.
A group of scientists led by Dr. Christo
pher Goodnow has learned that blood cells
called B cells never learn to recognize all of
the proteins that compose the human body.
Therefore, when these cells produce antibod
ies against viruses that resemble body pro
teins, their antibodies not only attack the
viruses but also the similar proteins.
By studying the immune responses of
mice, the scientists discovered that the
amount of a given protein in the body deter
mines whether B cells view it as natural or
foreign — as a teammate or as an opponent.
In mice that were genetically changed to
produce different concentrations of a protein
normally synthesized in chickens' eggs, T
cells — cells that work with B cells in the
immune system — recognized the protein
because it was being created within the body.

However. B cells did not develop tolerance
to the protein when it was formed in small
amounts.
The experiments described a possible
cause of autoimmune disease known as anti
gen mimicry. An antigen is any type of sub
stance that triggers a reaction from the
immune system. Antigen mimicry occurs
when a foreign antigen such as a virus or
bacterium has parts resembling the body's
natural substances.
At the onset of the disorder, both T and B
cells attack those parts of the antigen that
they do not recognize. If the antigen resem
bles a body protein that the B cells do not
recognize, then the B cells will launch an
antibody attack against both the foreign
invader and the protein that it resembles.
Although T cells may recognize body pro
teins that the B cells do not, they will still
attack these proteins as well as the part of
the virus which they resemble. This may be
because the T cells were already "geared up"
to attack the other, unfamiliar part of the
virus.
"There are probably quite a few cells that
are expressed at levels too low to induce any
tolerance in the B cell." said Goodnow.

"Those might include some of the antigens
that are inside cells or unique to particular
tissues, which are shielded away from the
immune system most of the time."
The location of self-antigens may also
determine B cells' tolerance of them. For
example, B cells may not be tolerant to pro
teins on the surface of or within certain cells
of the pancreas. If a virus resembling these
antigens attacks the body, B cells may attack
both the virus and the pancreas cells. This
might be one reason why diabetes occurs.
To better learn which locations in the
body are most likely to be recognizable to B
cells, Goodnow plans to further genetically
alter mice in order that certain proteins will
be expressed on cell surfaces rather than in
the bloodstream. He would also like to
express the protein inside cells and to con
centrate it on particular organs to see how
this affects the immune system.
The complexities of the immune system,
which have confused scientists for many
years, may be breaking down. The discovery
that B cells do not develop tolerance to all
body proteins raises new hopes that future
research will find treatments for many
incurable diseases.
