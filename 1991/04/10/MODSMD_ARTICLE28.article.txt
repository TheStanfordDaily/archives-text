# Stanford lab analyzes 7,500-year-old DNA
## 
### Chris Patil Editorial staff 
Genetic material from a 7,500-
year-old man may hold clues for
researchers studying the migra
tion of prehistoric human popula
tions.
Cell biologists at the School of
Medicine have analyzed samples
of DNA from the brain of a man
whose body was preserved in Win
dover Pond, in central Florida, for
75 centuries. Study of the ancient
DNA sets the stage for further
research, which would attempt to
determine whether there is a rela
tionship between modern Native
American populations and the
group of humans to which the
man belonged.
Analysis of the preserved
genetic material is especially sig
nificant because researchers were
able to isolate DNA known as
genes from the sample, says
Dr. Peter Parham, associate pro
fessor of cell biology.
Scientists have observed HLA
genes playing several different
roles in the human immune sys
tem. The genes help the body gen
erate immune responses against
viral infections and also cause the
rejection of transplanted organs.
HLA genes show "tremendous
variation between individuals,"
making them "wonderful markers
for human genetics," Parham
explained. "Some of these
molecules are found only in cer
tain populations," enabling care
ful study of HLA genes to reveal
relationships between population
groups, he added.
In addition to their extraordi
nary variability, a special property
of HLA genes — they develop as a
protection against disease —
makes them especially useful in
tracking prehistoric populations,
Parham said.

"We believe one of the reasons
there are these specific population
differences is because of the types
of diseases that can be found in
different parts of the world, he
explained.
For example, one gene adapted
specifically to impart resistance to
malaria is found in Africa.
Parham's team of researchers
has been studying HI.A genes pri
marily in order to understand
their role in the human body's
immune system, and the labora
tory's involvement in the ancient
DNA study was "entirely
serendipitous," Parham said. He
explained that Dr. David Lawlor, a
postdoctoral fellow in the lab, met
the team's collaborator in the

study — Dr. William Hauswirth of
the University of Florida — at a
conference.
Hauswirth and an associate,
Dr. Cynthia Dickel, had been try
ing to analyze the DNA of 165
humans found preserved in a bog
in Windover Pond. Before
Hauswirth's meeting with Lawlor,
the Florida team had been focus
ing on mitochondrial DNA.
After the chance meeting,
Parham said, the teams from
Stanford and Florida began a col
laborative study of the HLA genes
extracted from the brain of one
ancient man.
Because the man's brain had
deteriorated badly over the mil
lennia, extraction of usefully large

pieces of DNA was difficult. Over
a period of 18 months, the Stan
ford team acquired small portions
of six genes. The DNA fragments
were then reproduced millions of
times by a technique known as
polymerase chain reaction, which
provided researchers with enough
material to study in depth.
Due to coming refinements in
technology, research on ancient
genes will expand considerably
over the next few years, Parham
predicted. He envisioned that
"people will be telling each other
tricks" at scientific conferences,
such as a meeting on "Ancient
DNA" to be held in Nottingham,
England this summer.
