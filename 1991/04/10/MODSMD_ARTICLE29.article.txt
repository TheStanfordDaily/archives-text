Q. What is the Easter bunny?
A .The Easter bunny, Lepus
• vernalis, is the common
name given to a mutated and
secretive species of domestic hare.
The earliest records of L. vernalis
date back to the 11th century,
when crusaders supposedly stum
bled across a mutated form of rab
bit that was able to lay eggs. (This
benign form is NOT related to the
killer rabbit from the King Arthur
legend.) The rabbit later escaped
and quickly populated all of
Europe.
Thus, the answer to the ques
tion, "Which came first — the rab
bit or the egg?"
However, it wasn't until the
late 1970s that candy stores in the
United States decided to exploit
these rabbits for profit. Scientists
at Genentech, Inc., funded by the
K mart consortium, were able to
genetically engineer a variant
lagomorph which had amazing
properties.
Using EMS recombination and
retroviral eugenic transduction,
the Genentech scientists inserted
the cacao genes from the cacao
tree, the pigment genes from sev
eral species of butterflies, the
transparent plasmids from jelly
fish and an improved set of
oviduct chromosomes. The result
ing organisms were released
nationwide and quickly estab
lished their niche in the North
American ecosystem.
The transparent bunnies are
now able to use their stealth tech
nology to elude capture as they lay
their eggs. But because the eggs
are so brightly pigmented, the
Easter bunny must lay many eggs
in different hiding spots in an
effort to get them to hatch before
they are discovered. The hatch
lings are all female and are born
pregnant, much like the tribbles
from "Star Trek."
The final stage of the Easter
bunny's life results from the over
production of the cacao genes.
Large amounts of chocolate are
continually synthesized in the
fatty vesicles of the skin cells,
until the rabbit finally dies. The
insides of the bunny quickly decay,
leaving a hollow chocolate shell.
The dead rabbits are then col
lected by K mart agents and laid
to rest on a bed of artificial grass
in a lovely basket-shaped coffin.
Which is fine until a hungry child
greedily bites the head off the
corpse of this sacred and sacrile
gious creature.
Remember, we wouldn't print
it if it were true.
Q.Just what is spring fever,
• and what causes it?
A .Spring fever has been with
• us at least since the develop
ment of consciousness in Homo

habilis, about 1.7 million years
ago.
Until recently, it was com
monly believed that the symptoms
of spring fever — preoccupation
with unfulfilled sexual desires,
inability to concentrate or moti
vate oneself to do anything be
sides fulfilling sexual desires, and
complete loss of interest in study
ing and working on anything
besides fulfilling sexual desires —
were evoked in a complex psycho
physiological response to environ
mental cues such as increasing
daylight hours, warmer tempera
tures, the smell of flowers, and
other stuff like that.
Recently, however, researchers
in the Stanford University
Department of Biological Sciences
have uncovered a link between the
symptoms of spring fever and a
previously unknown microscopic
fungus called Vernus febris. This
fungus has been shown to rapidly
mature and disseminate its repro
ductive spores in response to
exactly the same environmental
cues that had previously been
thought to cause spring fever
directly.
Researchers discovered the
link by performing an experiment
in which mature spores of Verni*s
were administered intranasally to
both male and female volunteers
culled from the Department Of
Biological Sciences. Members <jf
the control group wore gas masks
for the two-week period to guariid
against incidental infection
naturally occurring spores. life
volunteers were closely observer!
and their behavior was recorded
for analysis.
•
Sure enough, the infected
group showed all the signs of
spring fever (including difficulty
in motivating oneself to rise froip
bed in the morning, and the very
strong desire to watch homemade
video tapes of the "Best of G&
Smart'").
So there you have it — just put
on a gas mask in March, keep it on
until about the second week of
June, and all your problems will
be solved.
