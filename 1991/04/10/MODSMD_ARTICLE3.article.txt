### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
The Board of Trustees voiced strong
support yesterday for University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy, quashing any spec
ulation that he would be forced to resign
as a result of the indirect-cost contro
versy.
"We have confidence that our presi
dent and provost and their administra
tion can lead us through this difficult
period in Stanford's history, and we will
continue to support them fully as they do

so," said James Gaither, president of the
trustees, in a statement issued at the con
clusion of the board's two-day meeting.
Last month, Rep. John Dingell and
other members of the House Subcommit
tee on Oversight and Investigations casti
gated Kennedy for poor management of
federal research funds, prompting a great
deal of bad publicity in local and national
media.
Since then, several faculty have sug
gested privately — and some even pub
licly — that it would be in Stanford's best
interests for Kennedy to resign.

nut tne trustees came out ot a three
hour discussion of the issue Monday
solidly behind Kennedy and his perfor
mance. "In my opinion, the University's
on top of this," said John McCoy, chair of
the finance committee, in an interview.
"We're going to take the high road and
get the thing behind us," McCoy said.
Kennedy said last night he was grati
fied by the trustees' support. "Obviously
it's good to have them out there with
something to say we're all on the same
page," Kennedy said.

finance committee announced it would
require future financial audits of the Uni
versity to include a review of its account
ing for indirect costs associated with
sponsored research grants and contracts.
Such a review has not previously been

required.
Gaither said in his statement that the
trustees backed Kennedy's position that
the University should "do what is right,
not what the law may permit."
Kennedy has maintained that charging
the government for Hoover House
expenses is "technically allowable," but
not appropriate. In a recent speech to
alumni in Los Angeles, he said the Uni
versity would adhere to a higher standard
in the future.
