# Cancer patient focuses on problems of terminally ill
## 
### Chris Patil Editorial staff 
In an effort to make the medical envi
ronment faced by terminally ill patients
more humane, a dying man is devoting
the last weeks of his life to assisting
other patients.
The Medical Center is supporting
Jonathan King in an educational project
that is intended to give patients the
opportunity to take more active roles in
their own treatment. King is dying of
cancer; in the year-and-a-half since his
condition was diagnosed, he has under
gone treatments at Stanford as well as in
Los Angeles and Houston.
King said his experiences as a patient
have made him want "to deepen the
appreciation of those involved in medical
decision-making for the primary role
that the patient should have in making
decisions about his care."
King's wife, Ellen, reported that he
believes strongly that regardless of med
ical condition, each patient "should be
given by physicians some measure of
control of the situation."
In January, King exercised that con
trol by electing to stop his treatments.

Sometimes, said Ellen King, medical
professionals tend to be brusque and
impersonal with their patients.
"Being treated like a human being
makes all the difference in the world in a
patient's outlook," she said.
King discussed his concerns about the
medical environment with Dr. Edward
Shortliffe, director of the Center for
Advanced Medical Informatics at Stan
ford and with Dr. Thomas Raffing, direc
tor of the Stanford Center for Biomedi
cal Ethics.
Their conversations resulted in plans
for an annual lecture series, jointly spon
sored by the two institutions. At these
lectures, guest speakers will try to
enhance medical professionals' under
standing of terminally ill patients' feel
ings and concerns.
The lectures will be aimed at "all
health care professionals who care for
patients," Raffing emphasized.
Hospital President Kenneth Bloem
said that he is pleased to support the lec
ture series. "I believe that this may be
just the beginning of a movement at
Stanford to become as renowned in our
caring as we have been and will continue
to be in curing as well as research."
