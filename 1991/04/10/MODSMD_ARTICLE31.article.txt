# Hacker's wrist deserves a break
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
I was sitting at my
keyboard the other day
when it happened for the
first time.
A sharp pain was cut
ting through the upper
part of my right hand.
It was — to say the
least — unpleasant. For-

tunately, having read a good deal about
the subject of hand pain, I knew what I
was experiencing. It's called a "repetitive
strain injury," and these days, having one
is all the rage.
The most common and debilitating
injury of this type is something called
"carpal tunnel syndrome." I'm fairly sure
my pained hands were a warning that if I
don't watch myself, I could fall victim to
that dreaded condition.
Those who suffer from carpal tunnel
syndrome literally lose the use of their
hands for weeks, or even months. Since
many who are suffering from this afflic
tion are professional writers, some people
are being forced to stop doing the very
thing they do for a living — often for a
long time.
Surgery is often required to correct
the condition, and the syndrome's vic
tims are forced to wear splints on their
wrists for some time following the opera
tion. I should note, incidentally, that this
problem is not unique to typists. It can
happen to pianists and even golfers (a
friend of mine who plays the sport pro
fessionally recently had surgery for it).
Denise Caruso, who writes a syndicat
ed column that appears in the San Fran
cisco Examiner, and Ezra Shapiro, a writ
er for Macweek magazine, both wrote
extensively on carpal tunnel syndrome
after they were diagnosed with it. I will
spare you the melodrama, especially
since I am far from being disabled from
it.
And, instead of getting on my high
horse about how computer manufactur-

ers must do something to
save us, I will offer a few
simple suggestions.
First of all, use common
sense. If you spend a lot of
time at your computer key
board, make sure it's inter
rupted by adequate breaks.
Your wrists will love you,
and your eyes will too.
Leaving aside the recent
legislation passed in San

Francisco about video display terminal
use, let's just say that sessions lasting
several hours should be punctuated by
two or three complete work stoppages per
hour.
Take up to five minutes every so often
to relax. Breathe deeply, look out your
window, stretch your legs, and such. It
can do wonders.
My second suggestion is to purchase a
wrist pad. One of the major causes of
carpal tunnel syndrome is that the wrists
get placed in an unpleasant, stressed
position for extended periods of time.
They are unable to keep up with what
you are asking of them, and eventually
they quit.
You are placing yourself at particular
risk if you let your wrists hang down
below the desk top and reach up to the
keyboard to type. Natural selection has
not yet provided most humans with
infinitely stretchable tendons and liga
ments — so don't abuse your hands.
What a wrist pad does is elevate your
hands slightly above the keyboard. Most
such devices are as long as the keyboard
and about three times as thick as the typ
ical mousepad. With your wrists resting
above the keys, you can let your fingers
loose and type in a downward motion.
Not surprisingly, this is a good deal more
comfortable than reaching up and creep
ing over the keyboard.
As a matter of fact, this downward
motion is historically significant. In the
days of manual — and even early electric
— typewriters, you had to strike the keys
hard in order to get any results. To do

that, you had to come at the little suckers
from above. It should come as no surprise
then that repetitive strain injuries were
rare in those days. Now, in the computer
age, they are the fastest growing occupa
tional hazard.
What does it all mean to you? Perhaps
no more than that you may now be aware
of something that you did not know exist
ed before reading this article. If someone
recognizes the warning signs in time, I'll
feel better having steered him or her
down the path of pain and suffering
avoidance.
Better still, more of you will hopefully
seek to become more familiar with the
issue — and with ways you can avoid
becoming a victim of such an injury.
Finally, give serious consideration to a
wrist pad if you're experiencing any dis
comfort at all while typing. The $15-20
you spend now are a drop in the bucket
compared to the hell you could go
through later.
In the coming weeks, Computer Cor
ner will attempt to get you prepared for
the impending release of System 7.0 and
to provide its usual variety of productivi
ty-enhancing information. Comments on
repetitive strain injuries or any other
computer-related concerns should be
