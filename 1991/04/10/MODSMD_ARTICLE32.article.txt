## Tigers trip up Card 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
Stanford does not seem to feel comfort
able being at the top. A month ago the Car
dinal found itself ranked No. 1 by both
Baseball America and Collegiate
Baseball/ESPN and then lost its next game.
Yesterday only Baseball America saw fit
to name Stanford the best in the nation,
but the new lofty status brought the same
result.

Tigers 6
Cardinal 4

Believe it or not, University of the Pacific
6, Stanford 4.
Actually, talking to Stanford assistant
coach Dean Stotz, this news should come as
no big surprise.
"We are not invincible," Stotz said. "The
nature of the game is such that you do not
play well every game."
Or every inning for that matter. For the
Cardinal, the game came down to the sec
ond frame, when Pacific touched starter
Jamie Sepeda for five runs, four of them
earned. The inning started with a David
Holbrook error on a shot down third, and
after a throwing miscue and a good bunt,
Stanford found itself with the bases loaded
and no outs. A walk and two hits later the
Tigers were up 5-0, and that was all they

would need.
"I actually think Jamie pitched a good
game," Stotz said "If we could have played
a better game behind him, we would have
held (Pacific) to only a couple of runs."
Sepeda combined with relievers Andrew
Lorraine, Chris Holcombe and Brian Sack
insky to pitch a six-hitter, but the Tigers
made the most of their opportunities.
"They played very well," Stotz said.
"They got timely hitting, and that is what
you need to win."
Stanford also managed six hits, but
Pacific starter Joe Brownholtz was able to
go the distance and keep the Cardinal at
bay. Brownholtz struck out only two, and
all his runs were earned, but he made the
pitches when they counted.
"(Brownholtz) really kept us off bal
ance," Ryan Turner said. "We were taking
pitches and he was throwing strikes. We
made him pitch to us, and he did a good job;
we just didn't swing the bat that well."
Turner may not have been that pleased
with the performances of his team's bats,
but the Tigers were downright ecstatic.
After the last pitch, Brownholtz's orange
and black teamates rained down on the
mound and the party was on in Stockton.
The Cardinal could only walk off the field in
silence.
"We were not real happy," Turner said.
"We knew it was a game we should have
won."
The game was Stanford's seventh non-

ping the team to 24-10. The set
back could also drop the team in
next week's rankings, but that is
not a big team concern. College
baseball is like college basketball
in that the NCAA tournament is
all that matters. Like UNLV
showed, it is no good being No. 1
unless you end the season that
way.
"The only ranking that mat
ters is in June, which is a long
way down the road, " Stotz said.
"Right now we are concerned
with how we play. If we play well,
the rest will take care of itself."
No. 1 will just have to wait for
another day.

Stanford does not seem to feel comfort
able being at the top. A month ago the Car
dinal found itself ranked No. 1 by both
Baseball America and Collegiate
Baseball/ESPN and then lost its next game.
Yesterday only Baseball America saw fit
to name Stanford the best in the nation,
but the new lofty status brought the same
result.

Tigers 6
Cardinal 4

Believe it or not, University of the Pacific
6, Stanford 4.
Actually, talking to Stanford assistant
coach Dean Stotz, this news should come as
no big surprise.
"We are not invincible," Stotz said. "The
nature of the game is such that you do not
play well every game."
Or every inning for that matter. For the
Cardinal, the game came down to the sec
ond frame, when Pacific touched starter
Jamie Sepeda for five runs, four of them
earned. The inning started with a David
Holbrook error on a shot down third, and
after a throwing miscue and a good bunt,
Stanford found itself with the bases loaded
and no outs. A walk and two hits later the
Tigers were up 5-0, and that was all they

would need.
"I actually think Jamie pitched a good
game," Stotz said "If we could have played
a better game behind him, we would have
held (Pacific) to only a couple of runs."
Sepeda combined with relievers Andrew
Lorraine, Chris Holcombe and Brian Sack
insky to pitch a six-hitter, but the Tigers
made the most of their opportunities.
"They played very well," Stotz said.
"They got timely hitting, and that is what
you need to win."
Stanford also managed six hits, but
Pacific starter Joe Brownholtz was able to
go the distance and keep the Cardinal at
bay. Brownholtz struck out only two, and
all his runs were earned, but he made the
pitches when they counted.
"(Brownholtz) really kept us off bal
ance," Ryan Turner said. "We were taking
pitches and he was throwing strikes. We
made him pitch to us, and he did a good job;
we just didn't swing the bat that well."
Turner may not have been that pleased
with the performances of his team's bats,
but the Tigers were downright ecstatic.
After the last pitch, Brownholtz's orange
and black teamates rained down on the
mound and the party was on in Stockton.
The Cardinal could only walk off the field in
silence.
"We were not real happy," Turner said.
"We knew it was a game we should have
won."
The game was Stanford's seventh non-

conference loss of the year, drop
ping the team to 24-10. The set
back could also drop the team in
next week's rankings, but that is
not a big team concern. College
baseball is like college basketball
in that the NCAA tournament is
all that matters. Like UNLV
showed, it is no good being No. 1
unless you end the season that
way.
"The only ranking that mat
ters is in June, which is a long
way down the road, " Stotz said.
"Right now we are concerned
with how we play. If we play well,
the rest will take care of itself."
No. 1 will just have to wait for
another day.
