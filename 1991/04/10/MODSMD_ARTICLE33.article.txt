# NCAA rule hurts Olympians who want to be students
## 
### 
The shock continues to reverberate
throughout college athletics. The
storm that began brewing after the
passage of the NCAA President's Com
mission's reform package in January
erupted into a tempest last week.
Janet Evans is leaving school, giving
up her remaining collegiate eligibility to
train for the Olympics.
College athletics is the loser.
The idea of American college sports is
to combine academics and athletics. To
allow young adults to develop potential,
follow athletic dreams, while continuing
their education.
The honeymoon is over.
While football and basketball pro
grams have been beset with problems for
a number of years, small sports still pro

vided the eager a chance to grow both in
the classroom and on the field.
Until Wednesday.
Elite athletes no longer feel they can
develop their physical potential while
pursuing a major. Until the passage of the
NCAA reforms this past winter, athletes
in individual sports were allowed to train

as often and as much as they felt neces
sary.
The result? Numerous collegiate
American-record holders, world-record
holders and Olympians.
But then a group of high and mighty
university presidents decides things are
getting out of control in the world of col
lege athletics. And that they are the ones
to do something about it.
So they steamroll this little "athletic
package" through their national conven
tion and reform not just the troubled rev
enue-producing sports, but anything in
which a student runs, throws, crawls or
pants.
And by limiting all practice sessions of
all sports to 20 hours a week, this little
clique is telling swimmers, gymnasts and

runners that they can't be students and
world-class athletes at the same time.
It's really a shame.
The NCAA is penalizing some of the
best athletes in the nation for wanting to
go to school.
That's one of the stupidest things I've
heard in a long time (though it's no sur
prise that it came out of the NCAA).
After all the banter about graduation
rates and not allowing/forcing athletes to
get an education, here's a case of young
men and women wanting to get the most
out of both sports and school, and not
being allowed to!
Now who's pulling whose leg?
Janet Evans loved Stanford, her team
mates and the squad. She wants a
diploma from the Farm.

But because of the new legislation,
which states that "mandatory in-season
practice and competition is limited to a
maximum of 20 hours a week" she felt
that she would not be able to reach her
goal of qualifying for the 1992 Olympic
team.
Yes, a loophole was inserted which
allowed certain athletes, specif'ical!
swimmers and gymnasts, to voluntari!"
practice as much as they wanted beyond
the limit. Coaches in sports that can be
dangerous when unsupervised may
present during these "voluntary* 112
sions.
So why can't Evans. Melvin Stewart,
and others who are sure to follow suit ju *
