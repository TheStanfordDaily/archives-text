# O'Brien in no rush to turn pro
## 
### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
The temptation of the profes
sional circuit is overwhelming.
Money, publicity, endorsements,
even fame await today's young
stars. Throw in the trend of
turning pro early, and many top
college tennis players find it
hard to put off the tour, and
forego their final years of eligi
bility.
John McEnroe left Stanford
after his freshman season, as did
David Wheaton. Jeff Tarango
recently turned pro at the com
pletion of his junior year.
The enticements don't faze
Alex O'Brien.
The junior has no delusions
about trading in national titles
for national motel chains, or life
on the Farm for life on the road.
He'll keep plugging away for
the Cardinal until his time is up.
Stanford men's tennis
couldn't be happier.
After two productive years in
both the singles and doubles
lineups, O'Brien has taken over
the coveted position of compet
ing at No.l singles.
And is helping lead Stanford
toward a fourth-consecutive
NCAA crown.
"While playing at No. I Alex
has done a great job," coach Dick
Gould said. "I'm extremely
pleased with his play and contin
ual improvement. He's had some
wins over great players."
Hanked No. 8 nationally, 0.8.
— as his teammates call him —
has consistently come through
in the clutch for the third
ranked Cardinal. He's 9-6 in
dual match play, and just last
weekend pulled out a gutsy
three-set win over USC's Byron
Black — a match which, had he
lost, could have handed the team
victory to the Trojans.
And even for a very talented
and driven player, competing at
No. 1 is not as facile as Prime
Ticket's telecasts make it
appear. The pressure is on for
every team's No. 1 singles com
petitor, more so for the defend
ing national champion.
"There's a big difference
between No. 1 and No. 2. When
you are playing No. 2 you can
afford to have some mental
lapses," explained O'Brien.
"When you are playing No. 1

people are always out there to
get you. If your let up in the least
bit you will he held accountable
because you will get your butt
whipped."
Aside from a letdown during
the National Team Indoors in
February, during which he lost
all three of his No. 1 matches,
O'Brien is holding up quite
nicely.
His mental toughness, in fact,
is what helped propel the seem
ingly easy-going player to the
pinnacle of collegiate tennis.
While others may get discour
aged after winning the first set,
losing the second, and getting
down 3-0 in the third, O'Brien
just digs in. And often comes up
with the win.
"Mentally Alex is one of the
toughest players I've ever had,"
said Gould, who has coached a
multitude of superstars. "He
doesn't lose his concentration in
matches. In terms of sustaining
pressure on his opponent I
haven't seen any lapses this sea
son.
"I would hate to play him. If
you let up at all he's all over
you."
The mental edge has helped
the All-American rapidly
improve. When the lithe, sandy
blond junior competitor arrived
on the Farm two and a half years
ago, Gould wasn't sure what
O'Brien's role on the team
would be.
The gutsy competitor has sur
prised even the king of collegiate
tennis.
"I didn't know what his ten
nis would be like when he came
in. I didn't know if he would play

Men's tennis stalwart Alex O'Brien sees no need to give up the
juggling act of college life just yet. The two-time All-American will
be at No. 1 singles again today as the Cardinal travels to Cal.
