# Women's golf in 10th
##

"It's like hitting a ball that
lands on El Camino," said
women's golf coach Tim Baldwin.
"Unless you strike the ball abso
lutely perfectly, it bounces all over
the place."
Baldwin's Cardinal five strug
gled on Monday in the Lady Sun
Devil Invitational in Tempe, Ariz.,
and faltered even more so yester
day, slipping out of a tie for ninth
place with Oklahoma State to sole
possession of the 10th slot.
"We're not playing up to par,"
said Baldwin. "We played the
front nine holes well both days,
but as for the final nine . . ."
Entering the final round well

behind top-ranked San Jose State,
the Cardinal no longer has any
hopes of a top-five finish in the
tourney and would settle with
sixth place.
"Our goal is to catch Okla
homa," said Baldwin "It will be
tough but we can do it."
The last 18 holes will be espe
cially challenging for the Cardin .i
since they will be the last ones off
the final nine holes.
"It's going to be an uphill battle
because the greens will be
harder," said Baldwin.
The firmness of the greens ha>
been the demise of linksters in the
past two days. The players art
accustomed to plaving on soft, fi -
giving greens on which they can
let the balls fly.
"There isn't even one tree on
this golf course," said junior
Stephanie Davis. "There are just a
lot of mounds and hardly any
water."
Arizona State, the host, has
taken almost complete advantage
of the desert course. Ranked 22nd
in the NCAA, the Sun Devils are
second only to San Jose St.
"Arizona State has a different
kind of game," said Baldwin.
"They've hit 294 and 296 in the
past two days, but they're averag
ing about 325 in every other tour
nament."
Davis had led the Cardinal
after one day of action, but yester
day she fell from 21st to 50th
while shooting an 84, 12 over par.
"Her driver was going left and
right, and she lost a little confi
dence," said Baldwin. "All aspects
of her game went a little awry."
The senior veteran, Jodi Figley,
compensated for Davis by shoot
ing for a team-low 73 to finish
20th with a total of 152 overall.
Junior Audrey Wooding,
ranked 12th in the NCAA,
continued her steady perfor
mance, equaling the 77 that she
shot on Monday to put her 25th in
the tourney.
The 19th-ranked junior, Adele
Moore, improved on her dismal
14-over-par on Monday to hit a
78.
"Adele didn't hit the ball well at
all the first day," said Baldwin.
"But she hit the ball a lot better
today, and I think that she'll be on
the rise tomorrow."
