# Linksters finish fourth
## 
### Peter J. Blum Staff writer 
Early yesterday morning the
men's golf team had their eyes
fixed on overtaking UCLA and
possibly USC in the Etonic South
west Intercollegiate Golf Champi
onship at the North Ranch Coun
try Club in Westlake Village, Calif.
"We're only 10 strokes behind
USC," said junior Christian
Cevaer. "We're not out of it."
But by the end of the after
noon, the Cardinal learned that a
solid day was not enough to sur
pass the two Southern California
rivals.
Needing an outrageous day,
three out of the top four Cardinal
linksters bettered their scores
from each of the two 18-hole
rounds played on Monday, but
that was not enough as the team
slipped a notch to finish the tour
ney in fourth.
"After the second round of a
tournament, not too many teams
usually change positions," coach
Wally Goodwin said. "Unless you
play like UTEP did today."
Texas El-Paso shot the lowest
round of the tournament yester
day, 284 on the par-71 course, to
catapult them from eight strokes
behind the Cardinal in the morn
ing to 890 overall, two strokes
lower than Stanford. USC
expanded its 10-stroke lead over
Stanford to finish 14 strokes
lower than the Cardinal and six
shots ahead of runner-up UCLA.
"We were trying to catch IJCLA
today, but they played really well
as a team," freshman Notah
Begay said. "It's tough to make

up that many shots in 18 holes.
Although Goodwin thought
that his team did not have a real
istic shot to beat USC with its
"tremendous depth and talent,
he did think that his veteran star.
Cevaer, could pull out the individ
ual title.
After the first 36 holes played
on Monday, Cevaer led the pack
with a combined total of 143. But
the former Pacific 10 champion
only hit a 75 in the final day to fin
ish in fifth place.
"I'm disappointed because I
had a good chance to win.'' Cevaer
said. "But when I was the leader I
needed to hit under par — a 68 or
69 — to maintain my lead. I'm
still pleased overall."
Even though Cevaer was the
only one of the four Cardinal
golfers whose score did not
improve, he still managed to lead
Stanford with a 218 over 54 holes.
Freshman Casey Martin played
at even par most of the day, but
"missed a few tee balls" to finish
with a 73 on the dav and 222 over
all.
Starting with a double-ho£ey
yesterday morning, Begav had the
lowest score with a one-over-par
72 to finish one stroke behind
Martin.
Sophomore Mike Million
rounded out the top Cardinal four
with a 74 on the final day and an
average over the two days of 229.
Goodwin was pleased with Jus
team's showing considering its
lack of experience and compsti
tion within the last month.
"We hung in there," Goodwin
said. "My guys played tough and
showed a lot of grit."
