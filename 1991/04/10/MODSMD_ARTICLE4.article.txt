# Trustees approve $27M for quake-damaged buildings
## 
### Scott McCormack Staff writer 
The Board of Trustees yesterday after
noon unanimously approved plans to repair
and reinforce several buildings on campus
damaged by the Earthquake of 1989.
The total cost of the four projects —
repairing Memorial Church, the Business
School, the Stanford Museum and one
other non-academic building — is $38 mil
lion.
The Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA), which provides disaster
relief around the nation, will provide
between $10 and $11 million for one of the
projects — the museum. The rest of the
money will come from private donations
and the University Earthquake Facilities
Reserve, according to Director of Facilities
Project Management Curt Williams.
As a non-profit organization, the Uni
versity is eligible for federal reimbursement
of up to 75 percent of the cost of earth
quake repairs, but various restrictions on
reimbursements have limited the total
amount Stanford will receive.
The University Earthquake Facilities
Reserve is a fund established after the
earthquake to pay repair costs not covered
by federal assistance or other gifts,
Williams said. The money comes from the

normal University facilities reserve, a
building maintenance fund that may con
tain up to several million dollars at any
given time, he said.
Work on Memorial Church is expected to
begin toward the end of April and will last
around 16 months, according to church
officials.
The project's budget is $8.5 million, all
of which must be raised from private
donors since religious buildings are not eli
gible for federal money. Williams said $8.1
million has already been raised for the
repairs.
The church is scheduled to reopen in the
fall of 1992.
Most of the work on the church involves
reinforcing the existing structure with con
crete, primarily at the center crossing
where the four arms of the church con
verge.
Other work includes reopening the bal
conies, which have been closed for more
than 10 years, church officials said. A sec
ond staircase and fire sprinklers will be
added to bring the balconies up to current
fire codes.
Although most of the Business School
has already been repaired and reoccupied,
the University still wants to reinforce the
office wing of the 30-year-old
building.
The plans are designed to
strengthen the building to 1.5
times its current level. The Busi
ness School will raise the entire
$2.38 million needed for the pro
ject, Williams said.
The work is scheduled to be
completed by Oct. 1.
The Stanford Museum will
also undergo a $26 million reno
vation. FEMA is expected to reim
burse the University between $10
million and $11 million. The rest
will come from gifts, of which the
University currently has commit
ments of $5 million to $6 million.
Construction is expected to
begin in May 1992 and will take

about two years to complete.
The final project approved by
the Board is the strengthening of
Building 2-560, a structure near
the Press Building that will be
used to house faculty and staff
displaced by other repair projects.
Plans include reinforcing the
building to meet current earth
quake standards and to provide
extra space for displaced faculty
and staff The renovated building
will also have wheelchair access.
The project will cost roughly
$1.51 million and will be paid
entirely by the University Earth
quake Facilities Reserve. Because
the building was not damaged by
the earthquake, it is not eligible
to receive federal money.
A team of engineers from the
federal management agency has
been on campus estimating repair
costs for all damaged structures
since the Loma Prieta quake,

Williams said. Once the team
arrives at a set of figures for a
particular project, "a great deal of
negotiation" occurs between
Stanford and the agency's estima
tors, Williams said. Once a figure
is agreed upon, the agency pays
75 percent of the cost, he said.
However, the agency's figures
are often lower than Stanford's
cost estimates because the federal
government only pays to return
the buildings to their original
state. Williams said this is a
source of conflict because many of
the buildings involved are more
than 100 years old, so their origi
nal states cannot meet current
safety standards.
This explains why final plans
for Geology and Language Cor
ners have not yet been approved,
Williams said. "We have not come
to an agreement over either pro
ject," he added.
