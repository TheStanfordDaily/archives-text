# Trustees approve $27M for quake-damaged buildings

### Scott McCormack Staff writer 
The Board of Trustees yesterday after
noon unanimously approved plans to repair
and reinforce several buildings on campus
damaged by the Earthquake of 1989.
The total cost of the four projects —
repairing Memorial Church, the Business
School, the Stanford Museum and one
other non-academic building — is $38 mil
lion.
The Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA), which provides disaster
relief around the nation, will provide
between $10 and $11 million for one of the
projects — the museum. The rest of the
money will come from private donations
and the University Earthquake Facilities
Reserve, according to Director of Facilities
Project Management Curt Williams.
As a non-profit organization, the Uni
versity is eligible for federal reimbursement
of up to 75 percent of the cost of earth
quake repairs, but various restrictions on
reimbursements have limited the total
amount Stanford will receive.
The University Earthquake Facilities
Reserve is a fund established after the
earthquake to pay repair costs not covered
by federal assistance or other gifts,
Williams said. The money comes from the

normal University facilities reserve, a
building maintenance fund that may con
tain up to several million dollars at any
given time, he said.
Work on Memorial Church is expected to
begin toward the end of April and will last
around 16 months, according to church
officials.
The project's budget is $8.5 million, all
of which must be raised from private
donors since religious buildings are not eli
gible for federal money. Williams said $8.1
million has already been raised for the
repairs.
The church is scheduled to reopen in the
fall of 1992.
Most of the work on the church involves
reinforcing the existing structure with con
crete, primarily at the center crossing
where the four arms of the church con
verge.
Other work includes reopening the bal
conies, which have been closed for more
than 10 years, church officials said. A sec
ond staircase and fire sprinklers will be
added to bring the balconies up to current
fire codes.
Although most of the Business School
has already been repaired and reoccupied,
the University still wants to reinforce the
