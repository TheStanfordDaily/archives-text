# Trustees approve new dorms

Manzanita Park trailers will be harder and harder
to find in coming years as the Board of Trustees yes
terday approved the construction of two new dorms
on the site.
The board authorized more than $12 million for
phase two of the Manzanita Park project, putting
Stanford 200 beds closer to four years of guaranteed
housing starting in the fall of 1992.
The plan includes construction of two four-class
houses behind the newly constructed Kimball Hall,
slated to open this fall, as well as additions to the
Kimball Hall dining room, said Director of Facilities
Project Management Curt Williams.
The University intends to raise $8 million of the
$12 million cost through private donations. The
remaining $4 million will be raised through long
term debt financed by room and board payments,
Williams said, stressing that the rates will not rise as
a result of the new houses.
The two new 100-bed houses, which have yet to be

named, will be styled similarly to Toyon and Branner
Halls but will be "a little more modern," Williams
said.
Either 41 and 42 trailers will be removed from
Manzanita to create the construction site, Williams
said, leaving 56 or 57 trailers in the park.
Williams also said the modular classrooms
installed after the Earthquake of 1989 will probably
remain for at least another seven years.
The Board also "approved in concept" and gave
site approval for a new $11 million building for the
Department of Economics and the Center for Eco
nomic Policy Research.
The building is planned for construction on the
parking lot adjacent to Memorial Auditorium lacing
Serra Street, Williams said. The new building will be
three to four stories high.
While still in the preliminary stages, the project is
scheduled to begin in September 1992. Assuming
fund raising for the building proceeds on schedule,
Williams said construction should be completed by
January 1994.
