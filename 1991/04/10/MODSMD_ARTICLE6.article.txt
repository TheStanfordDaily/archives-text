# Humor and grilled cheese in store for COP election week
## Hammer and Coffin seek to entertain 
### Howard Libit Staff writer 
Resume-stuffing. A ban on zone defense
in intramural basketball. Parent-pleasing
grades, sent to your home. What more
could voters want from the Council of Pres
idents?
How about a revolving restaurant on top
of Hoover Tower, an unhoused theme house
called "Casa Diaspora" and a "PC." confes
sional hotline for students who fear they
have done something politically incorrect?
These ideas top the list of campaign
promises made by members of the Hammer
and Coffin Society's slate as they gear up
for the official campaign week, which
begins today.
The "Click Here for Fee Refund" COP
slate is sponsored by the Chaparral, the
campus humor magazine. Slate members

say they plan to inject some humor into the
ASSU election process, something even the
Elections Commissioner has said was
sorely lacking from previous campaigns.
"We are hoping that the people will look
for a fun party," said slate member Amy
Arends, a junior. "The thing that distin
guishes us from other parties is that we
don't take ourselves too seriously"
Joining Arends on the slate are sopho
more Srivinas Kumar and seniors David
Levin and Michael Schreiber.
"We have a very balanced slate,"
Schreiber said. "We blend in youth, a
woman and even a minority."
Kumar said he represents the "skate
punks who hang out at the book store," and
Levin said he represents the "guys with 12-
gauge shotguns who go after them," two

A look at the
'Students First'
and 'Stand and
Deliver' slates
groups neglected by other parties
in previous campaigns.
"We're kind of like that peanut
butter and jelly that comes
together in one jar," Kumar said.
"We may not look very good at
first, but we actually do taste
pretty good."
Schreiber, a double major in
international relations and eco
nomics, and Levin, a political sci
ence major, will graduate this year
— if they pass their classes. Hav
ing been at Stanford a year longer
than many of their opponents
would aid them next year as COP
members, they said.
"The ASSU is usually the blind
leading the blind as it attempts to
repeat past mistakes," Schreiber
said. "We already know all of the
previous mistakes and know how
to make them again without ever
having to relearn them."
I * Levin said that if by chance he
found a job somewhere else in the
country, he would continue to gov
ern and promote Stanford's good

name by fax machine.
Schreiber and Levin blamed the
current COP for their difficulty in
finding jobs. After the ABC news
program "20/20" shredded the
University in its report on the
indirect-cost controversy, the COP
had "a responsibility to protect
Stanford's image and take '20/20'
down," Levin said.
Schreiber said the negative
press has hurt the chances of
Stanford seniors in their competi
tion for jobs against graduates
from other universities.
To aid seniors searching for
work, the slate will offer a
"resume-packing" service. Stu
dents who want another reference
on their resume would be able to
come to the ASSU, receive a title
and a job and the COP would keep
the information on file in case an
employer called.
Members of the slate said they
simply do not believe the issues
that concern other parties are all
that important to the voters.
"What are universal IDs going to
do, save the world?" Kumar asked.

However, the slate does have an
opinion on the current contro
versy as to whether the ASSU
Senate should be prevented from
speaking on non-Stanford issues.
"The senate should speak
exclusively on national issues. For
get the Stanford issues,"
Schreiber said. "It is better to keep
them from doing anything that
might affect the University."
As campaign week begins, the
slate will be involved in all of the
planned debates, hold a rally in
White Plaza next Tuesday and
"knock on every door on campus,"
Schreiber said.
Levin predicted the Hammer
and Coffin Society will narrowly
defeat the other parties in the first
election and win a resulting runoff
by a landslide.
Because there are four COP
slates running in the election,
many observers doubt that any
one party will be able to garner the
required 50 percent of the vote to
win the first election outright,
forcing a runoff between the top
two slates.
