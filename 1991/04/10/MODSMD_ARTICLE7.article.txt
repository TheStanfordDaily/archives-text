review called "Honev√üuns," emphasizing
the "nude" because "naked is dirty but
nude is beautiful."
The slate's campaign promises include
building a bar and grill on campus, arrang
ing a fight between Hulk Hogan and the
heavyweight boxing champion and getting
good bands to play in White Plaza.
"We need a place to go and hang out with
no studying allowed," said Ferroni. The
proposed bar and grill would be located at

Attia said the campus needs a place to
socialize because students need cars to go
anywhere. "We have cars, but we are look
