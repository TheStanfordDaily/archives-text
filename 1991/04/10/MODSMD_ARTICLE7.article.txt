# Bar and grill one goal of 'Four Play'
## 
### Miranda Doyle Staff writer 
Vowing to bring fun back to a campus
that is "as boring as an Annette Funicello
film festival," members of the "Four Play"
Council of Presidents slate said they will
hand out free condoms and grilled cheese
sandwiches during their campaign.
"Why grilled cheese? Because it's a
stupid food," sophomore Brad Cleveringa
explained. Besides Cleveringa, the indepen
dent slate includes sophomore Pete Huyck
and juniors Sarah Ferroni and Uri Attia. All
four candidates live in the Italian House.
Huyck, the new Stanford Tree, said the
group is very close. "We have all made love
in a hammock," he said, quickly adding,
"not all together, but individually." He also
said the four have participated in naked
bungee jumping.

He added that his own qualifications
include dancing with an all-male nude
review called "Honevßuns," emphasizing
the "nude" because "naked is dirty but
nude is beautiful."
The slate's campaign promises include
building a bar and grill on campus, arrang
ing a fight between Hulk Hogan and the
heavyweight boxing champion and getting
good bands to play in White Plaza.
"We need a place to go and hang out with
no studying allowed," said Ferroni. The
proposed bar and grill would be located at
Tresidder Union or in a new building con
structed using ASSU assets, she added.
Attia said the campus needs a place to
socialize because students need cars to go
anywhere. "We have cars, but we are look
ing out for others We are a caring slate," he
said.
Huyck said the group is "talk
ing to Don King now" about a
fight between Hogan and the win
ner of the Evander Holyfield-
George Foreman bout. "The rev
enue from the T-shirts and the
pay-per-view will be enormous,"
he said.
In addition, Cleveringa said
the slate would work to get big
name speakers for graduation.
"Seniors feel speakers around
here suck, with all due respect,"
he said.
However, dispelling Stanford's
"business-like atmosphere" re
mains the top priority, Attia said.
"Why is it that people go to col
lege? One, for education both in
and out of the classroom. Two, to
have fun and relax," he said.
"There is so much attention on
the first one, but the second one
should be emphasized.
"That is what life's all about....
We don't feel Students First and
People's Platform really acknowl

edge that second reason," Attia
added.
"Everybody else is concentrat
ing on serious issues and being
politicians," said Cleveringa. Four
Play, he added, was formed out of
a desire to make Stanford a more
relaxing place. "Basically, we see a
bunch of idiots over there at the
ASSU trying to make resolutions
about things like the war. They
are taking things too seriously."
Attia said he believes the scope
of the ASSU should be confined to
campus issues. "By devoting
themselves to global and national
issues, the ASSU is reducing the
amount of time they can devote to
the Stanford community."
Today, tomorrow and Friday,
the group plans to hand out
grilled cheese sandwiches in
White Plaza "with a kiss and a
smile from me," said Huyck. He
added that he "studied in France
at Cheveux Cravatte for three
years and got a graduate degree in
grilled cheese making" and is now
working toward a doctorate in the
field.

The slate will also hand out
condoms in gold wrappers from a
"huge box" they ordered from Ye
Olde Sex Shoppe, Cleveringa said.
Members of Four Play said
they are proud to have Sy Sper
ling, President (and client) of
Hair Club for Men as a sponsor.
"Sarah's hair may look real, but it
is actually a result of the Strand-
By-Strand Replacement System,"
Huyck joked.
On a slightly more serious
note, the group criticized People's
Platform because the COP issued
discount cards Monday. Huyck
said, "They are weasels for dirty
campaigning."
As an overall goal, Attia said
the group would like to "reduce
frustration" at Stanford.
Ferroni noted her special frus
tration about the lack of fun on
campus. "I come from Verdi, Nev.,
and it is even more boring here.
Something has got to change."
At the end of the interview,
Huyck excused himself by saying
he was going to "run off through
the trees like a wild gazelle."

issues, the ASSU is reducing the
amount of time they can devote to
the Stanford community."
Today, tomorrow and Friday,
the group plans to hand out
grilled cheese sandwiches in
White Plaza "with a kiss and a
smile from me," said Huyck. He
added that he "studied in France
at Cheveux Cravatte for three
years and got a graduate degree in
grilled cheese making" and is now
working toward a doctorate in the
field.

The slate will also hand out
condoms in gold wrappers from a
"huge box" they ordered from Ye
Olde Sex Shoppe, Cleveringa said.
Members of Four Play said
they are proud to have Sy Sper
ling, President (and client) of
Hair Club for Men as a sponsor.
"Sarah's hair may look real, but it
is actually a result of the Strand-
By-Strand Replacement System,"
Huyck joked.
On a slightly more serious
note, the group criticized People's
Platform because the COP issued
discount cards Monday. Huyck
said, "They are weasels for dirty
campaigning."
As an overall goal, Attia said
the group would like to "reduce
frustration" at Stanford.
Ferroni noted her special frus
tration about the lack of fun on
campus. "I come from Verdi, Nev.,
and it is even more boring here.
Something has got to change."
At the end of the interview,
Huyck excused himself by saying
he was going to "run off through
the trees like a wild gazelle."
