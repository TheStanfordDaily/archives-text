# Third of students approve of Kennedy's performance
## 
### Mike Laris Editorial staff 
Only 35 percent of Stanford
students approve of the way Don
ald Kennedy is handling his job as
University president, a Daily poll
has found.
The poll also showed that by a
3-to-l margin, students who
stated an opinion think the Uni
versity administration has not
adequately explained its indirect
cost recovery policies.
Nearly 20 percent of students
think the controversy between
Stanford and the federal govern
ment over the use of federal
research funds has "greatly" dam
aged the University's reputation.

Another 40 percent think the con
troversy has done "moderate"
damage to Stanford's reputation.
And one-in-five Stanford stu
dents think Kennedy should
resign. Fifty-four percent of those
polled said Kennedy should stay in
his job. Slightly more than a third
of students said they either have
no opinion or don't know whether
Kennedy should resign.
The Board of Trustees at the
close of their meeting Tuesday
voiced strong confidence in
Kennedy, who said last week that
he had no plans to resign.
Kennedy's low student
approval rating seems to portray a
student body concerned with
ongoing investigations into Stan

ford's accounting practices and by
a controversy they feel Kennedy
and other administrators have not
adequately explained.
The investigations have placed
Stanford on the receiving end of a
tremendous amount of bad public
ity, including a critical examina
tion of the controversy on the
ABC News program "20/20" and
numerous political cartoons skew
ering Stanford as an elite, waste
ful institution that thumbs its
nose at federal taxpayers.
Students answered the ques
tion, "Do you approve or disap
prove of the way Donald Kennedy
is handling his job as University


Doug Davis — Daily
president?" The wording followed
that used in the Gallop Poll to
determine the public-approval
rating of U.S. presidents.
Responses to the student
approval question also showed a
high level of indecision. While 35
percent of students said they dis
approved of the way Kennedy was
handling his job, 30 percent said
they had no opinion.
The poll also found that the
great majority of students have
been following the indirect cost
controversy "moderately" closely.
About 10 percent of students said
they followed the controversy
"not at all," while 15 percent said
they have been following "very
closely."
The Daily poll was conducted
Sunday, Monday and Tuesday and
has a margin of error of 5 percent
age points. Every tenth name in
the Stanford student directory
was called, yielding 362 responses.
Respondents were split evenly
between undergraduate and grad
uate students. Students were
asked the Kennedy —approval
question before any mention of
the indirect cost controversy.
The poll was taken before a
Daily article published yesterday

the indirect-cost rate to be negoti
ated between Stanford and the
federal government will likely be

Tuesday and his recent statement
