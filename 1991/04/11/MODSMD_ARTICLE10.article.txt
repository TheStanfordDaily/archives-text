# Striking workers tell Gorbachev to resign
## 
### 
MINSK, U.S.S.R. (AP) - An estimated
200,000 workers defied Mikhail Gor
bachev's moratorium on work stoppages
and poured out of factories to strike yester
day in the Byelorussian capital.
The republic's leaders granted strikers a
key demand and let them read an unprece
dented anti-Communist statement during
the republic's nightly television news pro
gram.
"The Communist Party of the Soviet
Union is guilty of the collapse of the econ
omy, lies around Chernobyl, and annihila
tion of the peoples and their languages,"
strike committee member Georgi Mukhin
said in the remarkable broadcast.
"This party tries to preserve its domi
nance over us at our expense."
Strike leaders told reporters the walkout
would continue today because the
Byelorussian government refused to nego
tiate their political and economic demands,
which include Gorbachev's resignation.
The strike in Minsk, a city of 1.5 million
and capital of the western republic of 10.4
million people, was set off by national price
increases. It followed a nationwide walkout
by about 300,000 coal miners that has
sapped the already-weak economy and
posed a mounting challenge to Gorbachev.
The Soviet president appealed Tuesday
for a moratorium on all strikes, demonstra
tions and rallies, warning that the country
was heading toward economic collapse. He
also proposed acceleration of the transition
to a free-market system.
Yesterday's strike appeared to be con
fined to Minsk, but strike committees
sprang up in Gomel, Mogilev and two other
cities in Byelorussia.
Byelorussians, who are ethnically close
to Russians, in the past have been quiet and
loyal allies of the Kremlin.

"Everything is a mess in Byelorussia,
which until recently seemed so stable, sen
sible and reliable. Now passions are red
hot," the Communist Party newspaper
Pravda reported yesterday.
All 15 Soviet republics have declared
some form of autonomy from the central
government. Georgia proclaimed full inde
pendence Tuesday. The Baltic republics of
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have been
trying for months to secede.
The unrest in Minsk, combined with the
strike of the relatively well-paid miners,
indicates the Kremlin can no longer take
the support of any republic for granted.
The Byelorussian strikers want Gor
bachev to quit and his entire Cabinet of
Ministers out. They demand the resigna
tion of the Byelorussian parliament and the
transfer of power to a coalition govern
ment.
They demand repeal of a 5-percent
national sales tax, nationalization of Com
munist Party property and legalization of
private ownership of land. They also want
higher wages to compensate for the huge
increases in state-set prices on most con
sumer items that took effect April 2.
"The April robbery of the nation was the
last straw for us," Mukhin said over TV
"We don't want to have anything in com
mon with Gorbachev and his untalented
union 'government, which squeezes our
republic dry on a regular basis."
Workers in Minsk spilled out of the front
gates of the city's major factories — includ
ing the auto plant, electronics factory and
the huge Minsk Tractor Works that Gor
bachev visited one month ago. At that time,
he was shown on national TV discussing
the economy with assembly line workers.
That plant alone employs about 30,000
workers.
