# Salvadoran peace talks at critical juncture
## 
### 
MEXICO CITY (AP) - Despite
substantial accord on electoral and
judicial reform, Salvadoran peace talks
are shadowed by differences over how
to confront the bloody past and purge
the military of human rights abusers,
a source close to the negotiations said
yesterday.
The source said the talks are at a
critical point and expressed concern
about a series of ads placed by rightists

in El Salvador's newspapers that
equate constitutional reform — an
integral part of any cease-fire accord —
with treason.
"What worries me are the
extremes," the source said.
It is an all-or-nothing round aimed
at producing a package of accords that
would then be submitted to the coun
try's legislature.
"Nothing is agreed until everything

is agreed," said the source, who spoke
on background with a group of journal
ists in the only update so far on the
otherwise-secret talks.
Despite the obstacles, which U.N.
mediator Alvaro de Soto last week
called "immense," both sides have said
there could be a cease-fire this spring.
President Alfredo Cristiani went on
nationwide television and radio Tues
day night to defend his government's

decision to negotiate.
He said the armed forces would not
be disbanded and the government
would not concede rebel control of any
territory.
The U.N.-mediated talks are the
closest El Salvador has come to ending
11 years of war and "forces opposed to
the peace process are being unleashed"'
by the possibility of success, the source
said.
