## Release free speech 
### 
New bill would protect
the rights of students
to free expression

BY AUTHORING A NEW bill,
an Illinois congressman is
trying to fight the hidden
costs of many free speech restric
tions at colleges and universities.
His action is a perceptive attempt
to eliminate them.
U.S. Rep. Henry Hyde, R-111. has
introduced a measure that would
allow students at private schools to
question the constitutionality of
university rules that limit free
speech in order to protect sexual
and ethnic minorities from harass
ment.
Until now, such codes have been
essentially immune to legal chal
lenges, since the Bill of Rights, and
hence the First Amendment, does
not apply directly to private insti
tutions.
Modeled after Supreme Court
case law, Stanford's amendment to
the Fundamental Standard will
likely withstand any judicial
scrutiny. It represents a successful
balance between freedom of speech
and freedom from verbal assault.
Stanford's policy is narrowly tai
lored and content-neutral, apply
ing only when an individual
attempts to insult or stigmatize a
specific individual or small group
of individuals. Both The Daily and
The Stanford Review can print
what they wish without censor
ship; students on the whole have
little to fear from a so-called "chill
ing effect."
Some schools, however, have
created ill-devised codes that are
clearly unconstitutional. Numer
ous reports attest to some colleges
rendering absurd decisions to
defend students from alleged
harassment.

Take, for example, an anecdote
from a Los Angeles Times article.
The Connector, the student
newspaper at the University of
Lowell in Mass., published an edi
torial cartoon that portrayed both
animal rights and death penalty
advocates as irrational.
Under the animal rights advo
cate a caption read: "Some of my
best friends are laboratory rats."
Under the death penalty advocate
the caption said: "None of his best
friends are young, black males."
Because some black students on
campus thought the cartoon
helped create a "hostile environ
ment" on campus, the newspaper's
editors were brought up on charges
that could result in six months of
probation, 30 hours of community
service and removal from The Con
nector's staff.
In light of cases like this, the
need for a more lenient standard at
many schools is evident. While the
schools display an admirable eager
ness to protect minorities from
offensive speech, their overzeal
ousness has become a substantial
source of concern.
Whenever a school decides that
mention of race or sexual orienta
tion, in virtually any context and
regardless of intent, can result in
punishment, it has effectively
ended discussion of some of the
most important issues of the day.
It is only fitting that the govern
ment would not allow such threats
to journalistic and academic
integrity to go unchecked. Hope
fully, the Hyde bill will force uni
versities to replace stringent
restrictions of free speech with
more acceptable alternatives.
As with the alcohol policy earlier
in the year, however, bills that reg
ulate academic affairs run the risk
of setting a dangerous precedent
for the future role of government
intervention.
