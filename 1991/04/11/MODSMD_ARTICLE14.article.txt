Overdeck, Sandoval letter about ASSU finances was preposterous

The statements made in
John Overdeck and Benny San
doval's April 8 letter about ASSU
finances are utterly preposterous.
First, anyone with even a marginal
sense of financial issues would agree that
a 500 percent growth rate in assets over
a seven-year period is a phenomenal per
formance.
Second, the authors of the letter con
tradict themselves by making the con
tention that this asset growth does not
benefit students, while simultaneously
indicating that the ASSU is non-profit.
Because the ASSU is non-profit, the
federal government, and Stanford Uni
versity itself, mandate that all profits
that are generated by ASSU operations
be channeled back to students. This
channeling comes primarily in the form
of reinvestment in the business projects
— Sunday Flicks, Lecture Notes/Copy
Service, Ad Agency, Shirt Shak, Beat the
Bookstore, Airport Shuttle, Linen Ser
vice and Type & Design — that modern
izes their operations for better and more

efficient service to students.
Beyond reinvestment, the accumu
lated assets of the ASSU also allow it to
leverage itself to further serve student
needs. The Shirt Shak can therefore
offer discounted prices on T-shirts and
sweats.
In addition, the ASSU has initiated .
projects — mostly at the prompting of
the Council of Presidents — that are
extremely valuable to students without
being financially profitable. Examples of
these projects include Beat the Book
store, which provides used books and dis
counted school supplies, and Airport
Shuttle, which provides transportation
services to the airport at significantly
discounted rates.
These assets also allow the ASSU to
provide some short-term, non-interest
bearing loans to student organizations
for student-initiated campus projects.
Moreover, this year the ASSU operat
ing budget provides $12,000, interest
from ASSU reserves, for use by the
ASSU Senate in initiating large-scale

projects to serve students. Ironically,
Overdeck, who is a senator, and chair of
the Senate Budget and Finance Commit
tee, has not introduced one bill to utilize
these resources.
Overdeck and Sandoval also failed to
indicate that interest from the ASSU's
short-term investment instruments
finances over 25 percent of the ASSU's
total contribution to the operating bud
get. This money funds special discre
tionary line-items that allow the senate
and COP to provide a significant amount
of financial support for student activi
ties.
Third, the statement concerning the
$81,000 accumulated in the special
buffer fund is pure misinformation. The
Bursar's Office will not bill students in
fractions of dollars, so when the financial
manager draws up the amount of money
in ASSU fees to be billed for student
organization funding, there is unavoid
ably an extra amount that is collected
due to rounding. The formulas used to

compute the amount billed are struc
tured to minimize this rounding excess
as much as possible.
The extra money that is collected is
then supposed to be used to offset exces
sive refunds requested by students from
organizations, and/or to reduce student
fees across the board. It is indeed an
oversight by previous financial managers
to have allowed the fund to increase to
such a level. However, it is the responsi
bility of the senate, not the COR to mon
itor ASSU finances for such irregulari
ties.
Finally, it should be communicated
that the ASSU reserves parallel the Uni
versity's endowment. These reserves,
like the University's endowment, are sig
nificant for financial leverage in the pre
sent and future. Their preservation and
growth are key to providing a substantial
capital base from which student-initiated
projects can continue to exist and multi
