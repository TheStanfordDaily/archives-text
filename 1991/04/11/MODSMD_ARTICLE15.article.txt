# Stanford must have strength to rid itself of all the king's men
## 
### 
I agree with Jared Carter's opinions
concerning Donald Kennedy and the
indirect-cost controversy which appeared
in The Daily on April 2, 1991. The funda
mental question of responsibility is this:
Who gave the orders to whom and what
were they?
By not answering this question direct
ly and making what amounts to simplis
tic excuses, Kennedy gives me the
impression that he is attempting to make
a horse's rear end pass for a bouquet of
roses. Do Kennedy and his supporters
believe that the government is bluffing

Whether the sheets cost
$7,000 or $184.04, they
should not have been
placed in any pool of indi
rect costs.

about pursuing criminal investigations?
If so, what will it take to convince these
fools that government officials are seri
ous — will criminal indictments convince
them?
One thing is certain. Whether sheets
for the Kennedys' bed cost $7,000 or
$184.04, they should not have been
placed in any pool of indirect costs. The
Kennedys' sheets have absolutely noth

ing reasonable to do with Stanford
research. And, since the combined
salaries of the Kennedys are very high, it
does seem reasonable to ask that they
purchase their own sheets.
I agree with those who say that
Kennedy should not be the "fall guy" in
this matter. It is likely that there was
collusion below and perhaps even above
him.
The students, staff, faculty and alum
ni who love this institution deserve the
best leadership. The Stanford communi
ty must have the strength to rid itself of
all the king's horses and all the king's
men and/or women. It is the only way for
Stanford to start regaining the credibility
and public trust that it must have to sur
vive and prosper.
