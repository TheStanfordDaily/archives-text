## The 						'melting pot' ideal 
### 
Many latinos consider the
name "Richard Rodriguez" analo
gous to African-Americans' use of
the term "Uncle Tom." Rodriguez, an
English professor at UC-Berkeley, earned
his reputation through his book "Hunger
of Memory."
Originally from Sacramento, and born
to immigrant Mexican parents, Rodriguez
attended private parochial schools in
Sacramento, then attended Stanford,
Columbia and Oxford. "Hunger of Mem
ory" is an autobiographical account of his
education, socialization and, ultimately,
assimilation into American society.
The book is well-written and at times
touching. It is a deeply personal story
that moves from Rodriguez's memories of
a childhood sandwiched between two cul
tures and languages to his gradual
immersion in a single language and one
culture.
Rodriguez's conclusions are controver
sial: He claims that for people of color,
Hispanics (his term) in particular, to be
truly successful in this society, they must
adopt American values, culture and lan
guage and should throw off the shackles
of their familial ones.
Rodriguez's book is lauded by conser
vative and mainstream liberals alike, for
he offers a very palatable solution to the
"minority problem."
Rodriguez's solution, however, is
deeply problematic because it comes at
the expense of many other important fac
tors: culture, language and family.
Rodriguez states that he is writing the
book as an "assimilated middle class
male." He stresses that the education

process stripped him of his familial
culture and of his ethnic identity — to the
point where he hesitates to call himself
anything other than an "American." He
discusses the fact that education changed
his life forever and created a communica
tion barrier between himself and his par
ents — neither of whom is college-edu
cated.
To white mainstream America,
Rodriguez may seem the epitome of the
acceptable, successful Chicano.
I think that's because white main
stream society has a hard time dealing
with minorities at a level deeper than col
orblindness. To a society that considers
itself the great melting pot, the person
who stands out as "too ethnic" does not
fit in. But "racelessness" is an ideal that,
although well-intended, misses the point.
The system has indeed worked for
Rodriguez as an individual, but not as a
Chicano. He assimilated into American
culture, got a scholarship and attended a
prestigious West Coast university. He got
a Ph.D. in English and then wrote a book
on why his experience was model.
Although he regrets having lost most of
the connection he had with his culture,
and especially grieves the loss of commu
nication with parents, he claims there is
no other way.
Subjectively, one can say that his way
is selfish and detrimental. While the solu
tion that Rodriguez is advocating will give
him the power to be accomplished aca
demically and professionally, it will
involve losing touch with a great part of
his cultural self. Even if he had claimed
that this break would not be painful —

which he does not do — he has no right to
ask that every Latino who wants to be
successful should follow his path.
Unfortunately, most Latinos cannot
even begin to follow his path because they
do not have the same educational oppor
tunities that Rodriguez had. Nor can he
imply that the price that he paid —
severing himself from his parents and
their culture — is a price that everyone is
willing to pay.
Moreover, in stripping himself of his
culture, Rodriguez strips his culture of
himself. Chicanos lose another young
scholar who might have worked for pre
serving the culture and identity of the
group. The rest of the group remains
exposed with no means of protecting its
sovereignty against the dominant culture
that wants to absorb it and melt it into its
crucible.
Rodriguez is asking Chicanos to pay an
outrageous price: to sever themselves
from their familial culture. Familial cul
ture is an integral part of human identity
— losing contact with that is like losing
contact with your parents.
In fact, Rodriguez does advocate losing
contact with one's parents. In essence,
following his advice leaves one an orphan.
