# Quotas will remain unchanged for Rush
## 
### Judy Hsu Staff writer 
Stanford's eight sorority presi
dents yesterday settled a week
long Rush controversy by deciding
not to count the new Chi Alpha Pi
sorority in determining the Rush
quota.
Because the move effectively
raises the quota, more women will
be able to join sororities. However,
members of some sororities fear
the higher quota may be difficult
to fill.
The presidents decided that
Chi Alpha Pi, which formed as a
local sorority last spring and
expects to become part of a
national organization next week,
should not be included with the
other seven sororities because it
does not currently have a national
charter.
The Rush quota, which sets the
maximum number of women who
can join each sorority every year,
will be announced tomorrow.
To calculate the quota, the
average number of women who
pledged sororities during the pest
five years is used to predict the
number of women who will possi
bly pledge a sorority this year.
This figure is then divided by the
number of sororities, yielding the
quota.
The sororities follow the rules
of the National Panhellenic Chap
ters, a national organization regu
lating sororities, during Rush,
said Intersorority Council offi
cials. Those regulations state that
only national sororities can be
counted in determining quota.
Although all University sorori
ties belong to the Intersorority
Council and are not affiliated with
the Panhellenic organization, the
presidents decided by a two-thirds
majority to uphold Panhellenic
rules and use a figure of seven
sororities in the quota calculation.
Despite not being counted in
the quota, Chi Alpha Pi is partici
pating in the formal Rush. Begin
ning Tuesday, the day after Rush,

however, all Chi Alpha Pi mem
bers will become pledges to the
national Chi Omega sorority. The
sorority is scheduled to become
the 177 th chapter of Chi Omega
May 25.
Because dividing by the smaller
number produces a larger quota,
counting seven sororities instead
of eight will allow a larger number
of women to join each sorority.
However, "this may mean that
some sororities won't [ fill J quota,"
because there are in effect eight
and not seven sororities sharing
the group of women going
through Rush, said junior Kari
Rosenthal, president of Kappa
Alpha Theta.
But other sorority officials
don't think the larger quotas will
cause a problem. ISC President
Erin Scalley said, "There was a lot
of discussion about what we felt
would be best for the rushees
because we want to bring as many
women as possible to be a part of
the system."
Chi Alpha Pi President Shanie
Geddes, a sophomore, said, "I def
initely don't think there are any
harsh feelings between the sorori
ties because of this." Other soror
ities have been very supportive,"
she said. "We're all working
together."
Sophomore Molly Burns, Chi
Alpha Pi's Rush co-chair, said she
does not see this matter as a con
troversy, but rather as a gray area
that needed to be clarified. "There
is no bitterness at all in our
group," she said.
Allison Sandy, sorority adviser
for the Office of Student Activi
ties. said she doesn't believe Chi
Alpha Pi is taking women away
from other sororities.
Delta Gamma President Chris
Wheeler said the controversy has
not had a large effect on her orga
nization. When the sororities
voted on the issue, they "decided
that dividing by seven would give
[them] an opportunity for a bigger
quota, a bigger pledge class that
would give them an opportunity
for a stronger group all together,"
she said.
Sandy said 284 women regis
tered for Rush this year, the
largest number of women since
1987 when 306 were registered.
