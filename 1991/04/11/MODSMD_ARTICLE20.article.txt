## Marc Sapir A 						look at the circumstances behind the new hospital wing pomp 
### 
STANFORD UNIVERSITY IS about
to produce a monster of a public
relations extravaganza. How often
do Marian Wright Edelman (president of
the Children's Defense Fund), first lady
Barbara Bush, a cast of prestigious
physicians including Norman Shumway,
two weeks of advance public relations
and three days of "photo ops" and
"sound bites" converge for the dedication
of a new wing of a hospital?
Before the passion play moves on by, I
would like to provide a glimpse at cir
cumstances behind the pomp.
I begin on April 2, having received by
mail my latest copy of "Stanford
Medicine," published by the Medical
Center's Office of Communications. On
the front cover was a view of the new
Lucille Packard Children's Hospital.
Inside the front cover, under the title
"United States Air Force," began five
days of the Desert Storm diary of Dr.
Michael Beck, a captain in the U.S. Air
Force, and a 1988 graduate from the
Medical School.
I was perplexed. Is there a relation
ship among health care, hospitals,
Packard and the Office of Communica
tions' decision to highlight Desert Storm
in a magazine purporting to be about
medicine? I would like to point out that
the staff of the hospital ship Mercy was

flown home within hours of the U.S.
cease-fire, despite the fact that thou
sands — many children as well as troops
— lay suffering without medical care
throughout Iraq.
It also caused this Medical School
graduate to wonder what the editors of
"Stanford Medicine" thought they were
doing.
Were they unaware, I mused, that the
cost of six hours of the war could have
paid for the hospital without the Packard
gift, or that the United States could pro
vide a nationwide, comprehensive, free
health care system for all Americans for
less than the cost of the war?
Or that our country, its banks,
schools, cities and public health pro
grams are going bankrupt and the peace
dividend just went out the window on
the biggest publicity stunt for adventur
ism, militarism and bone-crunching that
the world has ever seen? Well, you get
my point. And so I skimmed Beck's
diary, to see what their point was.
I got more than I expected. Appar
ently, Stanford is so proud of Beck and
his diary that the editors and publishers
endorsed a piece which relaxes the basic
ethical standards of medicine. Here is
the copy I'm referring to: Friday, Jan.
18, 1991: "One of the little hobbies over
here has been to autograph our bombs

and missiles with little messages for Sad
dam (Hussein). I'm sure you can imagine
how nasty those messages are. I wrote a
message on a Maverick missile and a
Mark 82 bomb. On the bomb I wrote,
'Take this and call me in the morning,' a
little medical humor." We get the point.
Of course the young men sent to war
were under great stress and perhaps
they cannot be held to a standard of
appropriateness that we might expect
under more civilized conditions of life.
However, some critics, like Harry Sultz,
professor of social and preventive
medicine at SUNY Buffalo, writing in
the April, 1991 "American Journal of
Public Health," believe that "health pro
fessionals by virtue of their elite position
in our society should be held to a higher
standard of (ethical) performance as citi
zens. . .
One day, Beck may look back at his
diary and realize that Saddam did not
get his message, but others did, and they
died needlessly. It was not a mistake, but
a calculated plan. Maybe they were
young Iraqi troops, or they might have
been children in Baghdad, Basra or
unnamed villages. I have hope that Beck
will come to see his actions as more than
frivolous, that his behavior was inconsis
tent with the ethical role of a physician
and made him complicit in the murder of

so many innocents.
I offer hearty congratulations to Stan
ford on its new Children's Hospital. We
doctors will be pleased to refer patients
for specialized and tertiary care to this
marvelous institution. We will also read
with awe of the future research break
throughs achieved there.

A closing note, to my colleagues: if I
could afford $150 for a plate, I might
take my place among you Saturday
evening, or at the least, send a homeless
American in my place.

Marc Sapir is a 1970 graduate of the
Stanford School of Medicine.
