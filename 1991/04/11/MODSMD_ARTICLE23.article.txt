## Netters clawed by Golden Bears 
### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
The men's tennis team didn't have to run
laps after its match at Berkeley yesterday.
Barely.
In dropping its third straight contest the
Cardinal put up its worst conference perfor
mance of the season, falling to the Golden
Bears 5-4, to drop to 13-4 for the season, 2-3 in
Pac-10 play.
The match wasn't as close as the score sug
gests.
Stanford lost five of its first six sets,
dropped five matches in straight sets and was
almost out of the match at the conclusion of
singles play
Not exactly a stellar performance by an
NCAA champion hopeful.
"The better team rises above adversity and
today Cal was the better team," coach Dick
Gould said. "We certainly put ourselves in a
position where we have something to prove."
Stanford did everything it could to put itself
in a position not to win. Alex O'Brien was the
only Cardinal player to win his first set and a
number of others fell behind quickly in their
second stanzas.
The team's usual tenacious intensity was
left somewhere on Highway 880. It certainly
didn't make it to the University of California
campus.
The lone bright spot for the Cardinal was
O'Brien, who won both his singles and doubles
contests, the only Stanford player to do so.
While O'Brien's match with Cal's Matt
Lucena at No. 1 was anything but a give-me,
he hung tough against Lucena's repertoire of
shots and the gusting wind.
Tied 5-5 in the first set, O'Brien held serve
to take a 6-5 advantage, then broke Lucena for

Cardinal 4

the win. Although O'Brien quickly gained a 2-
0 advantage in the second set, Lucena crept
back to 3-2 before O'Brien decided to show
him who was in control once and for all, cruis
ing to a 6-3 set, and match victory.
"I continue to be impressed with the job
Alex does to pull out a win," commented
Gould.
By the time O'Brien pulled out his 'W',
however, the Cardinal was already in a 3-0
hole.
At No. 2 singles Jared Palmer was out
gunned by the Golden Bears' Bent Pedersen 6-
2, 6-3. Palmer was down 3-0 in the second set
before he decided get into the match mentally,
but it was too late. Although Palmer
rebounded to within one, 4-3, Pedersen
regained control and put the match out of
reach.
Meanwhile, Jason Yee was demolished by
Matt Stroyman two courts down in the the No.
4 match. Stroyman never let Yee in the contest
and cruised to a rapid 6-3, 6-1 victory. Right
next door, Michael Flanagan was taught a les
son by Cal's Pete Fitzpatrick, 6-2, 6-2.
With Stanford down 3-1, Vimal Patel took
his No. 6 singles match against Tom Phanco to
three sets. After going up 6-2, Patel lost the
second 4-6. But with Stanford's team standing
on the line, he netted the third, falling 6-3.
"I don't think you can beat any team in the
country if you can't win your four, five or six
[singles] matches. " said Gould.
Four down, one to go for the fourth-ranked

Golden Bears. The one was almost Jonathan
Stark.
After quickly going down in the first set 6-3
to Cal's Carl Chang (the world's loudest
grunterj at No. 3, Stark looked like he had
swung the momentum back into his court by
taking the second 6-4. But that would have
made things easy.
Stark jumped ahead 4-1 in the third and
seemed to be in control. Never one to give up,
Chang grunted and pounded his way back into
the match, breaking Stark's service twice to
even things up at 5-5. But just when it
appeared it would go into a tie-breaker, Stark
located his volley and held on to a 7-5 set, and
the match.
Four-two Cal. Down to doubles.
While Stanford was able to eke out two vic
tories, it needed the magic three. No such luck.
Stanford's dynamic duo of Stark and
Palmer just couldn't get it together against
Pedersen and Lucena, the nation's top-ranked
team. Pedersen and Lucena outserved and
outvolleyed the Cardinal tandem 6-2 in the
first, then repeated their dominance in set No.
2. Stark and Palmer went down swinging on
court No. 1, 6-2, 6-2.
The match was Cal's, but somebody forgot
to tell that to O'Brien and Yee, who demol
ished Fitzpatrick and Stroyman 6-4, 6-2. The
all-freshman duo of Patel and Chris Cocotos
also pulled out a 6-4, 7-6 (9-7) thriller over
Phanco and Anders Rolfson at No. 3.
While there were few positives in the Berke
ley debacle, three-time defending national
champion Stanford hasn't written the season
off. The Cardinal did lose one each to USC,
UCLA and Cal last season and still went on to
take the national crown.
Besides, maybe it was just the kick in the
rear that the netters needed.

made things easy.
Stark jumped ahead 4-1 in the third and
seemed to be in control. Never one to give up,
Chang grunted and pounded his way back into
the match, breaking Stark's service twice to
even things up at 5-5. But just when it
appeared it would go into a tie-breaker, Stark
located his volley and held on to a 7-5 set, and
the match.
Four-two Cal. Down to doubles.
While Stanford was able to eke out two vic
tories, it needed the magic three. No such luck.
Stanford's dynamic duo of Stark and
Palmer just couldn't get it together against
Pedersen and Lucena, the nation's top-ranked
team. Pedersen and Lucena outserved and
outvolleyed the Cardinal tandem 6-2 in the
first, then repeated their dominance in set No.
2. Stark and Palmer went down swinging on
court No. 1, 6-2, 6-2.
The match was Cal's, but somebody forgot
to tell that to O'Brien and Yee, who demol
ished Fitzpatrick and Stroyman 6-4, 6-2. The
all-freshman duo of Patel and Chris Cocotos
also pulled out a 6-4, 7-6 (9-7) thriller over
Phanco and Anders Rolfson at No. 3.
While there were few positives in the Berke
ley debacle, three-time defending national
champion Stanford hasn't written the season
off. The Cardinal did lose one each to USC,
UCLA and Cal last season and still went on to
take the national crown.
Besides, maybe it was just the kick in the
rear that the netters needed.

Freshman Vimal Patel and partner Chris Cocotos won their first
match as a doubles team today. It wasn't enough for Stanford
though, as the Cardinal fell to California, 5-4.
The men's tennis team didn't have to run
laps after its match at Berkeley yesterday.
Barely.
In dropping its third straight contest the
Cardinal put up its worst conference perfor
mance of the season, falling to the Golden
Bears 5-4, to drop to 13-4 for the season, 2-3 in
Pac-10 play.
The match wasn't as close as the score sug
gests.
Stanford lost five of its first six sets,
dropped five matches in straight sets and was
almost out of the match at the conclusion of
singles play
Not exactly a stellar performance by an
NCAA champion hopeful.
"The better team rises above adversity and
today Cal was the better team," coach Dick
Gould said. "We certainly put ourselves in a
position where we have something to prove."
Stanford did everything it could to put itself
in a position not to win. Alex O'Brien was the
only Cardinal player to win his first set and a
number of others fell behind quickly in their
second stanzas.
The team's usual tenacious intensity was
left somewhere on Highway 880. It certainly
didn't make it to the University of California
campus.
The lone bright spot for the Cardinal was
O'Brien, who won both his singles and doubles
contests, the only Stanford player to do so.
While O'Brien's match with Cal's Matt
Lucena at No. 1 was anything but a give-me,
he hung tough against Lucena's repertoire of
shots and the gusting wind.
Tied 5-5 in the first set, O'Brien held serve
to take a 6-5 advantage, then broke Lucena for

the win. Although O'Brien quickly gained a 2-
0 advantage in the second set, Lucena crept
back to 3-2 before O'Brien decided to show
him who was in control once and for all, cruis
ing to a 6-3 set, and match victory.
"I continue to be impressed with the job
Alex does to pull out a win," commented
Gould.
By the time O'Brien pulled out his 'W',
however, the Cardinal was already in a 3-0
hole.
At No. 2 singles Jared Palmer was out
gunned by the Golden Bears' Bent Pedersen 6-
2, 6-3. Palmer was down 3-0 in the second set
before he decided get into the match mentally,
but it was too late. Although Palmer
rebounded to within one, 4-3, Pedersen
regained control and put the match out of
reach.
Meanwhile, Jason Yee was demolished by
Matt Stroyman two courts down in the the No.
4 match. Stroyman never let Yee in the contest
and cruised to a rapid 6-3, 6-1 victory. Right
next door, Michael Flanagan was taught a les
son by Cal's Pete Fitzpatrick, 6-2, 6-2.
With Stanford down 3-1, Vimal Patel took
his No. 6 singles match against Tom Phanco to
three sets. After going up 6-2, Patel lost the
second 4-6. But with Stanford's team standing
on the line, he netted the third, falling 6-3.
"I don't think you can beat any team in the
country if you can't win your four, five or six
[singles] matches. " said Gould.
Four down, one to go for the fourth-ranked

Golden Bears. The one was almost Jonathan
Stark.
After quickly going down in the first set 6-3
to Cal's Carl Chang (the world's loudest
grunterj at No. 3, Stark looked like he had
swung the momentum back into his court by
taking the second 6-4. But that would have
made things easy.
Stark jumped ahead 4-1 in the third and
