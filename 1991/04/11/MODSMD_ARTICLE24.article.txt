# Exceeding expectations
## Junior Kylie Johnson continues to confound the skeptics 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Heading into the 1989 NCAA
Championship final, the UCLA
Bruins knew they had a problem.
If they were going to beat top
ranked Stanford, the Bruins
would need to win at least two sin
gles matches.
But UCI.A couldn't like what
they saw as they surveyed the
lineups. Only on Court 6 did the
Bruins have an apparent advan
tage. There, Kirsten Dreyer,
ranked eighth in the nation enter
ing the season, was to face Stan
ford freshman Kylie Johnson.
Dreyer had been injured
throughout much of the year and
returned to health just before
NCAAs. Bruin coach Bill Zaima
figured she would be something of
a sure thing at the bottom of the
lineup.
As expected, the match was a 6-
2, 6-2 rout. Only Johnson was the
router, not the routed. When the
rest of the Bruins saw their best
hope shot down in flames, they
quickly succumbed. Stanford had
capped an undefeated season with
a shutout and was champion once
again.
Asked whether she was sur
prised about upsetting Dreyer, a
nonplussed Johnson responded:
"I didn't know I was supposed to
lose."
And, though Johnson may not
have been a household name in
college tennis, her ability was a
known quantity to Cardinal coach
Frank Brennan. "A lot of coaches
when I gave her a scholarship
said, 'Kylie Who?' Little did I
know she'd become such an
important part of the team.
"She's sort of been our secret
weapon. Without Kylie Johnson,
we could not have had the season
we had."
It's May 1990, and the unbe
lievable juggernaut known as
Stanford women's tennis is about
to capture its fifth consecutive
national crown. Without Kylie
Johnson.
The star of the '89 NCAA tour
nament had been relegated to
reserve status by another fresh
man sensation, Heather Willens.
Though she played in about half
the team's matches, Johnson's
sophomore campaign was a far cry
from the 23-2 dream season she
had as a freshman. Where did it go

wrong?
Johnscn takes full credit —
and blame — for what happened.
"I always had tennis as a number
one thing," she said. "[Last year],
I lost a little bit of interest, I
wasn't enjoying it as much."
The result was a poor showing
in last winter's challenge
matches, which are used to deter
mine the lineup. Since, as John
son points out, Brennan rarely
alters his singles rotation once the
season starts, she knew that her
status as a non-starter wouldn't
change. "It kind of discouraged
me," she says.
But adversity provided John
son with an opportunity. "For the
first time, I wanted to see what
else there was," she says. Her year
became what she describes as a
"walkabout." It was a chance for
the peripatetic Johnson to "do a
lot of new things. 1 found myself
climbing mountains and a whole
bunch of other stuff."

Being around tennis was diffi
cult at times. Stanford's reserves
are encouraged to lead the cheers
at matches and it was obvious
that Johnson was not completely
comfortable with the role.
However, taking a cue from her
experience of a year earlier, John
son made sure she treated Willens
well. Johnson, you see, won her
spot from then-senior Cindy
Buchsbaum. Instead of becoming
bitter, Buchsbaum befriended
Johnson and even sat by her court
at NCAAs, serving as a coach.

As time passed, though, John
son realized how much she loved
her sport and resolved to return to
top form. By season's end it was
apparent that Kylie Johnson —
the one who had beaten the likes
of Dreyer and former USC star
Caroline Kuhlman — was back.
A rejuvenated Johnson headed
for Europe once summer rolled
around and was doing fine until
she climbed a ladder to retrieve a
ball that had gone astray. On the

Junior Kylle Johnson has made a successful return from a major ankle injury in 1991. The erstwhile
freshman sensation has been a fixture at No. 6 singles for the second-ranked Cardinal.
