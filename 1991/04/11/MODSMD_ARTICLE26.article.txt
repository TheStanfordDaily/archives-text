She is one of the most unusual
two-sport athletes at Stanford.
After returning from New
Orleans and the NCAA Women's
Final Four, junior Martha
Richards made an immediate
impact in her golf debut during
yesterday's third and final day of
the Lady Sun Devil Invitational
Tournament in Tempe, Ariz.
Shooting a 75, second-best on
the Cardinal, Richards sparked

the women's golf team to hit 302
on the afternoon and catapult
itself past the likes of Oklahoma
State and Oregon to an eighth
place finish on the desert course.
"When we have a fifth player
like Martha shoot a 75, we are
really coming around," said coach
Tim Baldwin. "The best thing is
that she is just learning. We
haven't seen the best of Martha
Richards."
Richards felt "good to be back.
This is the best I've played in com
petition and it's nice to help the

team out," she said. "My role as
the fifth player is to be a stable
player who can throw in a score
pretty often."
However, Stephanie Davis, also
a junior, deservedly shared the
spotlight with Richards. Davis
stroked her way through 18 holes
to her best finish in the three-day
tourney: an even par 72.
Davis finished in a tie with
junior Audrey Wooding for 33rd,
at 232. Wooding, ranked No. 12 in
the country, shot a solid 78, but
her day was summed up with her

bogey on the last hole.
"I was swinging well and then 1
hit a couple of double-bogeys and
missed a few putts," said Wood
ing.
Junior Adele Moore rounded
out the top four Cardinal golfers
with a 77 despite frequent gusts of
wind that reached 40 miles an
hour.
"Golf and wind don't mix," said
Baldwin.
Up next for the team is the Pac
-10 championships in Eugene,
Ore., April '22-24.
