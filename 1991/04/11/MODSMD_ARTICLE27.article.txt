# Seeking to become Master of the game

AUGUSTA, Ga. - As
another tournament com
mences here on the pastoral
grounds of Augusta National,
so do a host of questions. Can
Nick Faldo, the mysterious
Brit, win an unprecedented
third consecutive Masters
championship? Who are the
leading contenders in this fine
field? And just what is a Stan
ford Daily reporter doing here?
Psych. I'm not really at
Augusta National. I've just
always wanted to write that
dateline above a story.
I'm actually stuck here in
good ol' Stanford, Calif., where
the golfing is great (if slightly
less competitive than the Mas
ters), and the school isn't bad
either. As a lame-duck, spring
quarter senior taking two
classes, I figure there isn't a
much better way to spend the
sun-drenched afternoons than
on the pastoral grounds of the
Stanford Golf Course.
A great plan, except for one
thing: I can't golf.
Oh, sure, I try and all. I even
bought a set of used clubs a
couple summers back, mainly
because my friends stopped
lending theirs to me after they
saw me swing. But I've used
them maybe four or five times,
dragging them out just often
enough to convince myself that
they obviously served a more
useful purpose as a stand for
dirty socks in the back of my
closet.
But it's been a good six
months, and lately I've been
getting that itchy sensation to
venture forth and experience
the ancient sport of Scottish
shepherds. Which is why I have
to write about it, to quell the
sensation, or at least to warn
those living in Governor's Cor
ner.
Perhaps my fate would
have been different if I
had been introduced to
the sport some other way.
If I could have gotten it out
of my system at a young age, by
witnessing the futile struggles
of family members to swing the
perfect swing or find the per
fect putter, then maybe I would
have been spared this cross.
But, as luck would have it, the
game and I did not meet one
another until late in my adoles
cence.
In fact, 1 didn't even under
stand the rudimentary rules of
golf (such as why the ball had
all those little indentations on
it) when I happened upon a
broadcast of the 1986 Masters
at Augusta. For some reason, I
started to watch the tourna
ment, recognizing none of the
players except possibly that
aging great, Jack Nicklaus.
Of course, this would hap
pen to be the year that Nick
laus, well into his 40s, would
come out of nowhere and win
his first tournament in years.
The fact that he did it at the

Masters, one of professional
golfs four "majors," made it
that much more heart-warm
ing and unbelievable.
I watched this happen,
amazed. What was the big
deal? My naive 16-year-old eyes
saw these librarian-type men
who continually hit a little
white object across someone's
well-manicured country estate.
It looked completely unath
letic, yet they were making
tons of money and had thou
sands of people following them
around, just like Michael Jor
dan.
Since my own "Air Hirning"
efforts had fallen about 3 feet
short of the rim, I figured it
was time to make the switch to
a sport made for me. My great
aunt, who had taken up the
game late in life, applauded the
move. "You'll probably be a par
golfer," she said to me dotingly.
That was five years ago.
Today, as another Mas
ters gets underway, I can
safely say that I am no closer to
darkening Augusta's greens
than I was then. They probably
wouldn't even let me attend if I
bought a ticket.
The problem is that my opti
mism has dimmed while my
enthrallment with the sport
has only grown stronger. Ten
nis, which I played extensively
in high school, now has no spe
cial allure for me. I wisely gave
up basketball in ninth grade to
those with the ability. I have a
casual relationship with Wiffle
ball.
Rut golf is weird. 1 can't give
it up, and I can't figure it out. 1
took a golf class here, spent six
months covering the Stanford
men's and women's golf teams,
and still don't understand the
game. But I have come to
understand one thing: It
doesn't matter how good or bad
you are, golf can drive you
crazy.
A billion things can go
wrong with a golf swing, and
they all combine to make that
ball do the strangest things.
When you finally do everything
right and the ball goes in what
resembles a straight line, you
can't figure out how the hell
you did that. Bolstered, you
proceed to hit another 12 bad
shots in a row.
At least I do. Yet I continue
to love the infernal game
unabashedly.
I say this despite golfs ten
dency to produce the incredibly
