# Speech panel receives last minute addition
## 
### Marie Bui Staff writer 
Fred Friendly, moderator of
yesterday's forum, framed much
of the discussion around a hypo
thetical situation involving Daria
Ilunga, a Stanford student
appointed to the distinguished
panel only hours earlier.
The outspoken sophomore was
one of 15 students to participate
in a dress rehearsal for the Speak
ers' Bureau forum "Safe Speech,
Free Speech and the University"
to test video and audio equipment
before the actual taping of the
panel discussion.
Friendly practiced his opening
words and moderated a mock dis
cussion, asking questions of each
student seated around the horse
shoe-shaped table.
"Some big white guy comes up
to you in the cafeteria and calls
you a nigger," suggested Friendly
to Ilunga, setting up the same sce
nario he used later in the evening.
Her clear responses led Friendly
to repeatedly tell Ilunga he hoped
panelists would be as eloquent as
she was, and he even jokingly
invited her to go to Columbia Uni
versity, where he teaches.
"Fred knows when he sees a
good catalyst for discussion," said
David Sless, who has been stage
manager for Friendly's programs
about the media and the public for
two years.
After the dress rehearsal fin
ished, Ilunga approached the pro

duction crew about appearing on
the program and was immediately
added to the list of panelists.
She reappeared three hours
later to add some local flavor to
the discussion.
When Friendly asked her, as
part of the scenario, what she
would tell her daughter about the
cafeteria "incident," she said,
"Well, I'll tell her I was very
angry."
"When you have the discus
sion, when you have the 'dialogue'
and you still have students who
are offending and threatening on
the base of race or ethnicity, then
what do you do? Do you just sit
back? I think that's where codes
are important."
