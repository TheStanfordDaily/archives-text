# Hentoff criticizes Fundamental Standard
## 
### Martha Brockenbrough Senior staff writer 
Nat Hentoff is not afraid to
speak his mind. Especially when
he's talking about free speech.
The 66-year-old journalist, a
panelist at yesterday's "Free
Speech, Safe Speech and the
University" conference, fer
vently defends the First Amend
ment against those he identifies
as enemies of free speech —
including University President
Donald Kennedy.
"Donald Kennedy has now
joined the speech police,"
Hentoff wrote in a July 1990 col
umn for The Washington Post,
excoriating Kennedy's decision
to approve the controversial
Fundamental Standard inter
pretation that outlaws certain
forms of speech.
Violations of the standard —
words that intentionally harm
an individual or individuals on
basis of race, gender, color, hand
icap, religion, sexual orientation
or nationality — can be grounds
for expulsion, according to the
1990 Student Conduct Legisla
tive Council interpretation.
Hentoff, who writes for The
Post, The New Yorker and The
Village Voice, flew from New
York yesterday to participate in
the free speech conference at
Stanford.
In an interview with The
Daily, the red, white and blue
clad journalist resumed the

attack. He asked, "Why did your
weather-vane president" reverse
his position on free speech? "Is
he leading by following?"
Kennedy, who had said before
the proposal passed that
restricted speech would result in
censorship and self-censorship
of ideas, never fully reversed his
position on the issue.
"I would have preferred a dif
ferent wording, or even a some
what different interpretation" in
some places in the text, Kennedy
told Campus Report last May.
He said his reservations did not
warrant a veto, however.
Hentoff said the now-imple
mented policy creates the kind of
discriminatory harassment it
was designed to curb and is only

a quick fix rather than a mean
ingful solution to bigotry.
"Intent to harm [through
speech] is utterly unprovable,"
he said, referring to the policy
requirement that intent to harm
must be proved for a student to
be judged guilty of a violation.
The University "creates a
hostile learning environment"
by passing an unprovable yet
restrictive code, he said.
Restrictive codes also contra
dict the University's educational
mission, Hentoff said.
If he were a university presi
dent, Hentoff said, he would talk
to the victims and perpetrators
of offensive statements, as well
as the offender's parents to find
out possible causes of the big
otry.
He would also call in faculty
and community members to dis
cuss the issues behind racism,
sexism and homophobia. "I can
think of people in the jazz com
munity who would be great —
they've experienced world-wide
racism," he said.
"If a university sets up a code,
it suppresses ordinary bigotry,"
he said. "The student has no
sense of what it's like to deal
with that."
"Why this fear of words? . . .
What black kids need is to
demystify language [so they can]
deal with that sort of nonsense."
He recalled the example of
four black women at Arizona
State University who were
offended by a "vile, racist, dis

gusting poster" hung outside a
fraternity. The women, he said,
did not question the men's right
to free expression. Rather, they
questioned whether the men
understood why such expression
was hurtful.
Ultimately, the "yo-yos" apol
ogized, he said, without a code
requiring it. Hentoff said he did
not know whether the men felt
pressured to apologize or
whether they were changed by
the experience. He intends to
call them and find out, though.
Hentoff said the women
involved "felt empowered" by
the experience. "They started
out as victims, but all of this
[independence] empowered
them."
"A code labels people as vic
tims," Hentoff said, because it
needlessly protects people who
are capable of protecting them
selves.
"The strongest, most vocal
IminoritiesJ are black groups,"
he said. "The notion of fragility
is absurd." Exceptions to this
are blacks who go to overwhelm
ingly white schools, he said.
Students need to experience
adversity to realize their poten
tial as "mensch and 'womyn
schy Hentoff said, recalling his
childhood as a Jew in anti-
Semitic Boston. "I learned I
could handle" bigotry.
"People have to stop thinking
of themselves as victims. Act
out. Confront it. Go to a newspa
per," he said.

offended by a "vile, racist, dis

gusting poster" hung outside a
fraternity. The women, he said,
did not question the men's right
to free expression. Rather, they
questioned whether the men
understood why such expression
was hurtful.
Ultimately, the "yo-yos" apol
ogized, he said, without a code
requiring it. Hentoff said he did
not know whether the men felt
pressured to apologize or
whether they were changed by
the experience. He intends to
call them and find out, though.
Hentoff said the women
involved "felt empowered" by
the experience. "They started
out as victims, but all of this
[independence] empowered
them."
"A code labels people as vic
tims," Hentoff said, because it
needlessly protects people who
are capable of protecting them
selves.
"The strongest, most vocal
IminoritiesJ are black groups,"
he said. "The notion of fragility
is absurd." Exceptions to this
are blacks who go to overwhelm
ingly white schools, he said.
Students need to experience
adversity to realize their poten
tial as "mensch and 'womyn
schy Hentoff said, recalling his
childhood as a Jew in anti-
Semitic Boston. "I learned I
could handle" bigotry.
"People have to stop thinking
of themselves as victims. Act
out. Confront it. Go to a newspa
per," he said.
