An imposing white man, about
6 feet 4 inches tall, towered over a
young black woman, roughly 5
feet 3 inches tall.
"I want you to play a role," he
said. "You're the center on a bas
ketball team. Yesterday was the
conference championship. You
lost. A big white student — male"
he bends down, glaring at her,
"comes up to you and says, 'You
niggers stink. I wish you and your
kind would all get out of here.'"
He paused and looked around.
"What do you think?"
The man asking the question
was Fred Friendly, the command
ing moderator of a riveting debate

Schmidt talks with students after the debate.
The vignette was Friendly's
way of cutting to the central issue:
Does a university code that pun
ishes a student for using the word
"nigger" violate that student's
First Amendment right to free
speech, or is it a legitimate
attempt by the university to build
community and protect students
from harassment?
This question has become the
focus of a national debate as Stan
ford and other universities across
the country add "fighting words"
clauses to their student conduct
rules, restricting some forms of
speech on campus, such as racial
slurs.
Yesterday's heated panel dis
cussion challenged opponents and
supporters of such codes to defend
their positions under Friendly's
relentless questioning.
Schmidt vehemently criticized
codes like Stanford's, saying,
"The university has a fundamen
tal mission, which is to search for
truth. People have the right to
speak the unspeakable and think
the unthinkable and challenge the
unchallengeable. I think these
codes make a fundamental mis
take."
Harvard Law Professor Ran
dall Kennedy and others on the
panel sharply disagreed, arguing
that such guidelines are necessary
to reaffirm fundamental values of
the community. "What does the
word 'nigger' have to do with the
search for truth?" he said.
Stanford Law Professor

Thomas Grey, the author of Stan
ford's new Fundamental Stan
dard interpretation, added that
being the target of racist speech
"is very much like getting spit on
— it's an affront to your dignity."
But Hentoff stressed that peo
ple need to learn to "demystify
language, to not be afraid of
words, to learn to come back with
your own words, your own ideas."
Another danger, Strossen
added, is that students will avoid
talking about sensitive racial and
sexual issues altogether.
Schmidt agreed, saying, "We
want ignorance and fear to
express itself so it can be
answered, otherwise it just gets
buried."
Also at issue was the question
of who decides what speech is
offensive. Drawing hisses of disap
proval from the crowd of nearly
300, Rooney said, "I don't know
who applies meaning to [words
such as 'nigger'l. I find all these
words vaguely amusing."
Proponents of the policy
counter that attitudes like
Rooney's are exactly what codes
such as Stanford's are intended to
address.
In the Stanford community,
racial epithets are not amusing,
but extremely harmful, implied
ASSU Council of Presidents mem
ber Goodwin Liu. Liu argued that
it is unfair to impose the burden
of educating racists on those most
harmed by racist speech.
A one-hour edited version of
the program will be broadcast
locally Monday on KQED.
The conference was co-spon
sored by the ASSU Speakers
Bureau.
