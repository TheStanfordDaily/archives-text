# Anchor discusses Asian stereotypes
## 
### Sarah Morisseau Staff writer 
About 100 people, mostly
Asian-American students, battled
the noise of the Tresidder Noon
Concert yesterday to hear televi
sion anchorwoman Emerald Yeh
speak on Asian-Americans in the
media.
Yeh, who anchors the 5 p.m.
and 11 p.m. news on KRON
(channel 4), spoke at the Old
Union Clubhouse as part of the
Asian American Speakers Series,
a program sponsored by the Asian
American Students Association.
She said she likes anchoring
because of the visibility, which
allows her to bring more Asian-
American issues into the news
and help break down some of the
stereotypes of Asian-Americans.
"I really enjoy my job . . .
because I'm in a position where I
can somehow affect the percep
tions of Asian-Americans," she
said. However, she added that her
ethnicity can also be an obstacle in
her profession.
"Asian women are seen as
exotic, alluring and demure," and
that is why television news pro
grams hire them, Yeh said. "We
have to work doubly hard to culti
vate viewers to our knowledge and
ability."
In addition, Yeh said there is
still a long way to go in giving

minorities fair representation in
the news.
"There's a fractured view of
Asian-Americans," she said. "On
one hand [other ethnic groups]
see us as the 'model minority.'
Then on the other end of the spec
trum there are Asian gangs. In
between this there is a whole area
of invisibility."
Yeh also spoke of the need for
more minorities in newsrooms,
saying they will better understand
and be more sensitive to minority
reports and issues that come
across the news desk. "It's really
important in the media to have
people who understand minori
ties," she said.
She added that more Asian-
American men are needed in tele
vision news. There isn't a single
male Asian-American news
anchor in the country on week
days and only one for the week
end, she said.
This lack of role models makes
Asian-American men shy away
from the profession, she said.
Even the Asian-American men
who are working as reporters are
not viewed the same ways as other
people, Yeh claimed. "The image
of the Asian-American man
remains negative. It'll be a blue
moon before American women
call him a 'scud stud' like they do
Arthur Kent."
