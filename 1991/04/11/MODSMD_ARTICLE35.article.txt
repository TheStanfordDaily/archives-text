## THE 						DAILY'S ANTIDOTE TO CIVILIZAT Back to the beach 
### 
Close your eyes. Imagine walking barefoot
along the shore as the sun descends in the
late afternoon sky. Feel the soft, cool sand
between your toes and the light mist on
your face; smell the sharp, salty sea air as
it fills your lungs and whips through your tousled
hair; listen to the surf crash against rugged bluffs and
watch the white foam spray into the already hazy sky.
Now open your eyes. You may find a gaping hole in
your class notes where your pen trailed off the page.
But a few stolen moments of fantasy during lecture is

not enough. Your senses crave stimulation. And the
rugged beauty of California's northern coast can
deliver — within 30 minutes.
A mere half-an-hour car ride can transport you to
the magnificent state beaches and preserves of which
most Stanford students remain ignorant. Just over the
mountains to the west of campus lie dozens of public
beaches, each of which offers striking views and

unique beauty.

The small rocky beach below Pigeon Point Lighthouse is ideal for tidepooling and watching the surf. The lighthouse,
constructed In 1872, is located around 10 miles south of San Gregorio Beach along Route One.
when you finally head over the hills,
you may be overwhelmed by your
choices. So you end up back at Half
Moon Bay again. And although Half
Moon Bay is a well-known and fairly
popular beach, it sits in a busy harbor
town and offers neither the seclusion
nor the beauty of many other nearby
choices.
Beaches are indeed plentiful along
Highway 1, but by no means are they
identical. Your choice of location
should really depend on what you're
looking to do, and since the beaches
are separated by an easy drive, you can
change plans with your every whim.
Hiking, tidepooling, skin diving
and rock-fishing are all viable options
on the Peninsula, as are beach staples
such as suntanning, volleyball and
kite-flying.
Swimming, however, is dangerous
throughout most of Northern Califor
nia due vicious riptides, hidden reefs
and the turbulent waters of the Pacific
Ocean.
So decide how you'd spend your
ideal afternoon (or evening), pick the
beach best suited to your desires, check
the map (page 8), make sure you have
the beach necessities (see list, page 8)
and ride off into a magnificent Califor
nia coast sunset.
Best swimming: For safe swim
ming, you should definitely head
south. Popular Seacliff State Beach, 10
miles north of Santa Cruz, is one
attractive option. The beach also offers
hiking and pelican-watching and a
view of the sunken World War 1 ship
Palo Alto, long abandoned and cur
rently home to a slew of shore birds.

Best tidepooling: Thirty acres of
tidepools are exposed along the shore
of James V. Fitzgerald Marine Reserve
during low tide. At high tide, the
reserve is an ordinary sandy beach, but
a low shelf of black rocks is exposed
when the surf rolls out, providing tide
pools perfect for spotting crabs and sea
urchins.
Best sand: San Gregorio, Pom
ponio and Pescadero Beaches all have
soft, white sand, but Rockaway Beach,
a striking and somewhat secluded
black sand beach located in a small
rectangular covc just south of Pacifica,
wins the originality award.
Best sand crabs: Wc spotted these
burrowing little critters in great num
bers (OK, 10 or so) on Bean Hollow
State Beach, which consists of a series
of somewhat-secluded, little, round,
sandy coves.
Best sand dollars: Palm Beach,
near Pajaro Dunes, is the prime spot
for these treasures.
Best wildlife: Pescadero Beach is
located across the highway from the
584-acre Pescadero Marsh Natural
Preserve, which is a feeding and nest
ing place for over 200 bird species. The
marshland, rolling dunes and saltwater
ponds of the refuge are likely spots for
deer, egrets and blue herons.
The three-mile long beach at Afio
Nuevo is beautiful as well as bountiful
with wildlife. Nesting area for the rare
northern elephant seals (in winter and
spring), and home to loons, sea lions
and even eagles, Ano Nuevo is a great
place to explore and observe — espe
cially on a guided tour.
Best whale-watching: Migrating
gray whales are attracted to the pletho
ra of plankton at the end of a sewage
outfall pipe in Pacifica, making Sharp
Park State Beach a prime location for
winter whale-watching on shore.

Also, the mile-long, bluff-top trail
between Bluff Hollow and Pebble
Beach is popular for winter seal- and
whale-watching.
Best surfing: Head to Santa Cruz,
dude. Word has it the hot spots for this
quintessentially California sport are
Cowell Beach, just south of the pier
and Pleasure Point. And be sure to
check out the Santa Cruz Surfing
Museum, an eccentric collection of
surfer memorabilia displayed in the
ground floor of brick lighthouse.
The summer months also bring
surfing breaks to the beaches at Ano
Nuevo. The water is turbulent and
underwater reefs abound, but the area
is still fairly popular among the wet
suited set.
Best rocks: Another low-tide trea
sure spot, Moss Beach boasts shoreline
rocks blanketed in delicate sea mosses.
It is clearly the lighthouse, and not
the beach at Pigeon Point, that's the
main attraction; however, the tiny
beach is lined with porous gray rocks,
covered with brown algae and tiny
tidepools. Perfect for climbing or sit
ting to watch the surf.
Best rock-fishing: One of the most
secluded beaches in the area, Grey
hound Rock is a big favorite among
fishers as well. Striking cliffs and the
gigantic boulder (Greyhound Rock)
make this a picturesque fishing hole.
Best skin diving: Although it isn't a
spectacular beach. Pigeon Point does
boast a thriving underwater life, as well
as a striking, historic lighthouse above.
Best skin: Or at least, the most skin
can be found at the Gray Whale Cove
Beach south of Pacifica and at other
local nude beaches. The Gray Whale is
a pretty white sand crescent, nestled
within steep cliffs. Look for the park
ing lot on the east side of Highway 1
and stairs leading down to the beach

on the west side.
Best solitude: Numerous secluded
coves dot the coast, but among them
Greyhound Rock, Gray Whale Cove
Beach and Bean Hollow State Beach
stand out as quite solitary.
Best lighthouse: Unassuming and
ordinary, the Pigeon Point Lighthouse
is beautiful in its simplicity. Built in
1872, the lighthouse is now automated
and distinctive for its 10-second flash
pattern. Four buildings surround it on
the rocky cliffs. Formerly family resi
dences for the U.S. Coast Guard, they
now form a very inexpensive and very
popular hostel which boasts a cliff-top
hot tub.
Best fog: Although any one beach
in Northern California could not justi
fiably claim to be foggier than the next,
the beaches of Paciflca, the self-pro
claimed fogcapitol of the world, would
have to win the contest.
Best horseback-riding: Both Half
Moon Bay and Montara State Beach
are popular among equestrians.
Best horsing around: Long and
narrow Montara State Beach is always
crowded with frolicking beach-goers,
tossing frisbees and volleyballs every
where. Most likely, more than one
stray ball rolls past the nude sun
bathers that reportedly congregate at
the north end of the beach.
Best location: Donner Beach, that
grassy expanse of lawn bridging Don
ner Hall and the Law School remains
the most convenient, if the least aes
thetically pleasing, beach for East
Campus dwellers.
Beach, which recently
reacquired a Lagunita, has superceded
Donner Beach as the most convenient
ly placed and perhaps most exclusive
beach for West Campus types. The
narrow stretch of whitish sand is also a
prime spot for snake-watching.

Close your eyes. Imagine walking barefoot
along the shore as the sun descends in the
late afternoon sky. Feel the soft, cool sand
between your toes and the light mist on
your face; smell the sharp, salty sea air as
it fills your lungs and whips through your tousled
hair; listen to the surf crash against rugged bluffs and
watch the white foam spray into the already hazy sky.
Now open your eyes. You may find a gaping hole in
your class notes where your pen trailed off the page.
But a few stolen moments of fantasy during lecture is

not enough. Your senses crave stimulation. And the
rugged beauty of California's northern coast can
deliver — within 30 minutes.
A mere half-an-hour car ride can transport you to
the magnificent state beaches and preserves of which
most Stanford students remain ignorant. Just over the
mountains to the west of campus lie dozens of public
beaches, each of which offers striking views and

unique beauty.

The small rocky beach below Pigeon Point Lighthouse is ideal for tidepooling and watching the surf. The lighthouse,
constructed In 1872, is located around 10 miles south of San Gregorio Beach along Route One.
when you finally head over the hills,
you may be overwhelmed by your
choices. So you end up back at Half
Moon Bay again. And although Half
Moon Bay is a well-known and fairly
popular beach, it sits in a busy harbor
town and offers neither the seclusion
nor the beauty of many other nearby
choices.
Beaches are indeed plentiful along
Highway 1, but by no means are they
identical. Your choice of location
should really depend on what you're
looking to do, and since the beaches
are separated by an easy drive, you can
change plans with your every whim.
Hiking, tidepooling, skin diving
and rock-fishing are all viable options
on the Peninsula, as are beach staples
such as suntanning, volleyball and
kite-flying.
Swimming, however, is dangerous
throughout most of Northern Califor
nia due vicious riptides, hidden reefs
and the turbulent waters of the Pacific
Ocean.
So decide how you'd spend your
ideal afternoon (or evening), pick the
beach best suited to your desires, check
the map (page 8), make sure you have
the beach necessities (see list, page 8)
and ride off into a magnificent Califor
nia coast sunset.
Best swimming: For safe swim
ming, you should definitely head
south. Popular Seacliff State Beach, 10
miles north of Santa Cruz, is one
attractive option. The beach also offers
hiking and pelican-watching and a
view of the sunken World War 1 ship
Palo Alto, long abandoned and cur
rently home to a slew of shore birds.

Best tidepooling: Thirty acres of
tidepools are exposed along the shore
of James V. Fitzgerald Marine Reserve
during low tide. At high tide, the
reserve is an ordinary sandy beach, but
a low shelf of black rocks is exposed
when the surf rolls out, providing tide
pools perfect for spotting crabs and sea
urchins.
Best sand: San Gregorio, Pom
ponio and Pescadero Beaches all have
soft, white sand, but Rockaway Beach,
a striking and somewhat secluded
black sand beach located in a small
rectangular covc just south of Pacifica,
wins the originality award.
Best sand crabs: Wc spotted these
burrowing little critters in great num
bers (OK, 10 or so) on Bean Hollow
State Beach, which consists of a series
of somewhat-secluded, little, round,
sandy coves.
Best sand dollars: Palm Beach,
near Pajaro Dunes, is the prime spot
for these treasures.
Best wildlife: Pescadero Beach is
located across the highway from the
584-acre Pescadero Marsh Natural
Preserve, which is a feeding and nest
ing place for over 200 bird species. The
marshland, rolling dunes and saltwater
ponds of the refuge are likely spots for
deer, egrets and blue herons.
The three-mile long beach at Afio
Nuevo is beautiful as well as bountiful
with wildlife. Nesting area for the rare
northern elephant seals (in winter and
spring), and home to loons, sea lions
and even eagles, Ano Nuevo is a great
place to explore and observe — espe
cially on a guided tour.
Best whale-watching: Migrating
gray whales are attracted to the pletho
ra of plankton at the end of a sewage
outfall pipe in Pacifica, making Sharp
Park State Beach a prime location for
winter whale-watching on shore.

Also, the mile-long, bluff-top trail
between Bluff Hollow and Pebble
Beach is popular for winter seal- and
whale-watching.
Best surfing: Head to Santa Cruz,
dude. Word has it the hot spots for this
quintessentially California sport are
Cowell Beach, just south of the pier
and Pleasure Point. And be sure to
check out the Santa Cruz Surfing
Museum, an eccentric collection of
surfer memorabilia displayed in the
ground floor of brick lighthouse.
The summer months also bring
surfing breaks to the beaches at Ano
Nuevo. The water is turbulent and
underwater reefs abound, but the area
is still fairly popular among the wet
suited set.
Best rocks: Another low-tide trea
sure spot, Moss Beach boasts shoreline
rocks blanketed in delicate sea mosses.
It is clearly the lighthouse, and not
the beach at Pigeon Point, that's the
main attraction; however, the tiny
beach is lined with porous gray rocks,
covered with brown algae and tiny
tidepools. Perfect for climbing or sit
ting to watch the surf.
Best rock-fishing: One of the most
secluded beaches in the area, Grey
hound Rock is a big favorite among
fishers as well. Striking cliffs and the
gigantic boulder (Greyhound Rock)
make this a picturesque fishing hole.
Best skin diving: Although it isn't a
spectacular beach. Pigeon Point does
boast a thriving underwater life, as well
as a striking, historic lighthouse above.
Best skin: Or at least, the most skin
can be found at the Gray Whale Cove
Beach south of Pacifica and at other
local nude beaches. The Gray Whale is
a pretty white sand crescent, nestled
within steep cliffs. Look for the park
ing lot on the east side of Highway 1
and stairs leading down to the beach

on the west side.
Best solitude: Numerous secluded
coves dot the coast, but among them
Greyhound Rock, Gray Whale Cove
Beach and Bean Hollow State Beach
stand out as quite solitary.
Best lighthouse: Unassuming and
ordinary, the Pigeon Point Lighthouse
is beautiful in its simplicity. Built in
1872, the lighthouse is now automated
and distinctive for its 10-second flash
pattern. Four buildings surround it on
the rocky cliffs. Formerly family resi
dences for the U.S. Coast Guard, they
now form a very inexpensive and very
popular hostel which boasts a cliff-top
hot tub.
Best fog: Although any one beach
in Northern California could not justi
fiably claim to be foggier than the next,
the beaches of Paciflca, the self-pro
claimed fogcapitol of the world, would
have to win the contest.
Best horseback-riding: Both Half
Moon Bay and Montara State Beach
are popular among equestrians.
Best horsing around: Long and
narrow Montara State Beach is always
crowded with frolicking beach-goers,
tossing frisbees and volleyballs every
where. Most likely, more than one
stray ball rolls past the nude sun
bathers that reportedly congregate at
the north end of the beach.
Best location: Donner Beach, that
grassy expanse of lawn bridging Don
ner Hall and the Law School remains
the most convenient, if the least aes
thetically pleasing, beach for East
Campus dwellers.
Beach, which recently
reacquired a Lagunita, has superceded
Donner Beach as the most convenient
ly placed and perhaps most exclusive
beach for West Campus types. The
narrow stretch of whitish sand is also a
prime spot for snake-watching.
