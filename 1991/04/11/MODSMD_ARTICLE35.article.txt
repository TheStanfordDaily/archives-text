Close your eyes. Imagine walking barefoot
along the shore as the sun descends in the
late afternoon sky. Feel the soft, cool sand
between your toes and the light mist on
your face; smell the sharp, salty sea air as
it fills your lungs and whips through your tousled
hair; listen to the surf crash against rugged bluffs and
watch the white foam spray into the already hazy sky.
Now open your eyes. You may find a gaping hole in
your class notes where your pen trailed off the page.
But a few stolen moments of fantasy during lecture is

not enough. Your senses crave stimulation. And the
rugged beauty of California's northern coast can
deliver — within 30 minutes.
A mere half-an-hour car ride can transport you to
the magnificent state beaches and preserves of which
most Stanford students remain ignorant. Just over the
mountains to the west of campus lie dozens of public
beaches, each of which offers striking views and

unique beauty.

The small rocky beach below Pigeon Point Lighthouse is ideal for tidepooling and watching the surf. The lighthouse,
constructed In 1872, is located around 10 miles south of San Gregorio Beach along Route One.
