# If you're feeling overdressed..

Would you expose yourself
in front of strangers? If
this question offends you,
stop right here; don't
bother reading the rest of this article.
Turn to Books; read about "Limbo
River," or whatever's being reviewed this
week.
If, however, the idea of frolicking
publicly in the sun and surf without the
constraints of bathing suits entices you,
read on. Because, for the first time ever,
Intermission is covering — so to speak
— nude beaches.
And your mother would not approve.
A nude beach is, by definition, one
on which clothing is not only unneces
sary, but is discouraged, if not forbid
den. And, believe it or not, there are sev
eral in the nearby vicinity.
Closest to us, just south of Pacifica on
Highway 1, is the tiny Gray Whale Cove
Beach. Gray Whale is concession-oper
ated and clothing-optional. However, if
you do choose to go bare, make sure you

figure out where to carry your ID; Gray
Whale is open to sun-lovers aged 18 and
older only.
A little farther away is the creatively
named Red, White and Blue Beach.
Surrounded by rocky headlands and fre
quently crowded with RVs, some feel
this beach isn't worth the money
charged for admission. Apparently it's
not all that safe either, because women
are frequently advised not to come
alone.
Located south of Davenport (north
of Santa Cruz), Red, White and Blue
charges $5 per car for the privilege of an
all-over tan. But where you do you put
the change?
Finally, close to Red, White and Blue,
is Bonny Doon Beach, one of the most
popular nude beaches in California.
Flanked with rugged cliffs at either end,
this beach is a free, and even wilder,
place to bare it all. Bonny Doon is con
veniently located at the intersection of
Highway 1 and Bonny Doon Road, but
is frequently covered with trash. And
you wouldn't want to sit on a bottle cap,
now would you?
