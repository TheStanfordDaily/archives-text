i T'S SPRING. And it shows.
Our attention spans plummet as the mercury climbs.
Our once ambitious academic careers have degenerated to paltry study
lists encompassing 13 units of Pass/No Clue, "I-need-it-to-fill-a-DR"
courses.
Shoes become passe as nature-lovers stroll barefoot through White
Plaza and sport enthusiasts grow rollerblades to speed transportation.
And dedicated students take their books outdoors with them, where
they can be used as neck props.
After all, who can study when it's sunny outside? When there are sand
castles to build, mountains to climb, oceans to swim.
Might as well just pack it in, pack a lunch and head to the beach.
And bring a copy of Intermission with you (it's a handy sandwich
wrapper.)
An eclectic collection of cultural, comical and musical events are hap
pening around the Stanford campus this week.
To start with, a San Francisco-based band, the Movie Stars, will rock
the Coffee House with energy, style and eclectic "urban folk" music on
Tuesday, April 16. See story, page 6.
The Posies wil perform in Dinkelspiel Auditorium on Wednesday,
April 17. Fiona Martin, a Seattle-based writer on campus for a few
months, reports on the darlings of her hometown, page 5.
And the Centennial Celebration (which also brought us two fabulous
environmental courses this spring) continues with the Stanford String
Quartet's concert on Saturday. Junior Tracy Shinn gives us some insight
on this accomplished foursome, page 6.
Opening on campus this week is "Walls," a play chronicling the contro
versial history behind the building of the Vietnam Veteran's Memorial and
exploring the healing process of both veterans and civilians after a war. See
review, page 8.
And if rhythm and blues is your thing, you shouldn't miss The Down
Home Blues Revue, an R&B festival which will be held in the Bouncer
Blues Bar in San Francisco on Friday, April 12. See calendar, page 3.
And finally, to be as inclusive and pluralistic as possible, a suggestion
for the opera-lover (or "Pretty Woman" fan trying to convince him/herself
that he/she is an opera fan and thus suitable for the attentions of Julia
Roberts and/or Richard Gere): "Cosi fan Tutte," the Mozart opera, will be
performed by Opera Peninsula on Friday, April 12, in Foothill College
Main Theater.
As you can see, Intermission is making every attempt to be as inclusive
and either universally appealing or universally appalling as possible.
Stay cool and keep in mind, even when a day is cloudy and gray, you
still can get a sunburn.
Cowabunga!
