YOU AND I MIGHT quibble
over the hilarity of Milli
Vanilli, but Jon Nakamatsu is
someone who takes his music
very seriously.
An active concert pianist as well as a
busy Stanford senior, Nakamatsu bal
ances the stressful schedule of piano
competitions and killer finals with an
easy laugh and a bright smile. And,
looking at his past record, he seems to
have everything under control.
Nakamatsu started playing the piano at age 6, with his
first recital at age 9. Now, at 22, he's a senior in German
studies and has a concert tour of Poland scheduled for next
fall.
During those interim 16 years, Nakamatsu has won
awards at the Los Angeles Young Pianist's Competition, the
Fourth National Chopin Piano Competition (1989) and the
Fifth National Chopin Competition (1990) among others.
He's also been given the 1986 Young Musicians' Award by
the San Francisco Symphony, recorded four television
recitals for the United Cable Network, and performed in the
Stanford Symphony Orchestra's winter concert.
How does he do it? Well, according to Jon, his "biggest
personal philosophy ... was always try to do better. To
never really be satisfied with what you've done. To do
more"
Intermission: Why did you start playing the piano?
Jon Nakamatsu: Well, it started when I was about 4, and I
wanted to play the piano because I saw [one] in my
preschool that the teacher used to play. 1 always wanted to
play it, but they wouldn't let me 'cause they didn't want the
kids to touch it.
So, I kept asking my parents and they didn't really want
to buy a piano or anything because they didn't think I'd
stick with it. So they give me this little electronic organ for
Christmas when I was 4. And I really liked it. So when I was
6, they said 'OK, fine. We'll get you the piano but you'll have
to start taking lessons.' And so I did. That's where it started.
I: Have you tried any other instruments?
JN: Not when I was that young, no. I had always wanted to
play the piano alone. But when I was in school, I ended up
playing the trumpet in the band. But the piano was always
my main instrument.
I: Why the trumpet?
JN: I don't know. Maybe because it's such a big contrast; I
don't know. It was just something ... something different.
Maybe it was the way it was presented to me. I mean, there
was this big demonstration of orchestral instruments and
the trumpet was loud and brassy and so that's one of the
reasons ...
I: How often do you practice?
JN: In your average week? That would depend. I mean ide
ally, it would be three hours or more a day. But of course,
sometimes, with school, that's hardly the case. I'm doing
homework and so sometimes I don't practice at all. It really
depends. But before a concert I do much more. Between

three and six hours a day. I wouldn't do more than that.
I: Have you always liked playing and practicing the piano?
JN: Well, I think you have to draw a distinction between
playing and practicing. I like to play— I really love to play.
And I always wanted to play. But I didn't like to practice
when I was young.
Of course, I wanted to play and improvise and do things
and not really stick to what I was supposed to be doing. But
as I grew older, I began to realize how important that was.
And so that changed. Now I'm really, really grateful for the
time that I had to practice and things like that.
I: Why are you majoring in German studies and not music?
JN: Well, I picked German studies for a lot of reasons. First
of all, I'm just interested in a lot of different things. Of

course, music is a main focus, but ... when I came here, I
thought this would be the best opportunity for me to get
educated in a different area. I think German also helps.
Learning a language, for one, just helps with music. And I
wouldn't want to limit my options.
I: What are your career plans after college?
JN: I will definitely pursue music as a career. But, again, I'd
also like to focus on education ...
I: About how many competitions do you go to a year?
JN: Well, right now, because I'm in school, I don't get to a
lot. There are people who are just constantly in and out of
competitions, but I might get to five to seven a year, which
is not a lot.

I: Five to seven isn't a lot?
JN: Well, I think seven is. Maybe I don't get to more than
five a year. But in comparison to what other people do,
that's not a lot.
I: What do other people do?
JN: Well, I've talked to a lot of people who go from one
competition to another, and just keep hopping around. I
mean, the more you're exposed, the more people see you,
the more you play, hopefully, the more recognized you
become. And you can never tell about competitions. You
might think you played well and you lose. One day you'll
think you played awful and you might win. So you never
know.
I: What's a competition like?
JN: It's stressful; I think it's much more stressful than any
kind of concert situation, because there's always pressure to
be perfect. I mean, maybe that takes away from the music
aspect of it. You have to be note perfect, technically secure;
your memory has to be unquestionable. Sometimes you feel
like you have to play for the judges rather than play for you.
I mean, if yoif want to win, you have to play how other
people want to hear you and not really how you want to.
And so sometimes you have to make a choice.
Maybe you do play for the judges. But I don't know; I try
to do what I want. I try to give my own, hold onto my own
values and if they like you, they like you and if they don't,
they don't.
I: How long do these competitions take?
JN: It depends, some of them are done in a matter of days,
and some of them can go on for three weeks. It depends on
the competition, how big it is, what's playing.
I: Do these competitions interfere with school?
JN: Yeah! Especially when I have to take off somewhere for
a couple weeks, I come back to a LOAD of homework.
I: What motivates you to spend all the time and energy
required for competitions?
JN: Well, I said that competitions are stressful, but they're
also, in another sense, exciting. I think right now I don't like
doing competitions. But when I stop, I think I will miss it.
You go there and there's something about it. It's exciting.
People are there trying to do their best, and they work
for this. And they get their moment, and maybe they get
into the next round and maybe they don't. And if you look
at a competition more like a performance, which is some
times hard to do, instead of just being there to compete
against other people, that's motivating. To be able to get up
there and try to do your very best, to set personal goals in
competition. Not maybe just to win, but to do something
you think you perhaps couldn't have done. That's quite a bit
of motivation for me.
I: You mentioned earlier that concerts are different than
competitions. Why?
JN: Well, because in a concert you really have the opportu
nity to express what you want to do, and not care so much
about what people think. I feel, personally, more free in a
concert, because it's a display of you.
In a competition, that's supposed to be the case but it's
not.
There is a lot of sacrifice. And there's a lot of competi
tions that aren't too sound. I mean, even as far as managing
a competition goes. But you have to take a chance, nowa
days; that's one of the main ways to go. And you have to be
willing to lose in order to win someday.
