# COP candidates promise to 'stand and deliver' to 'students first'
## 'Stand and Deliver' wants broader base 
### Howard Libit Staff writer 
"It is hard to distinguish the slate from a
piece of paper," said Nicole Johnson, a
member of the People's Platform Council of
Presidents slate. "The key to the election
will be to get out there and meet as many
students as possible during the week."
This simple yet time-consuming tech
nique will govern the campaign strategy of
the "Stand and Deliver" COP slate, com
posed of sophomores Johnson and Mike
Curry and juniors Mae Lee and Jennifer
Pearson.
People's Platform, the dominant party in
ASSU politics for the last five years, was
founded by four student of color organiza
tions — the Asian American Student Asso
ciation, Black Student Union, Stanford

American Indian Organization and
MEChA, a Chicano/Latino student group.
But the party has recently worked to
"broaden its base of support by including
all groups on campus," Pearson said.
Slate members cited Curry's role as a
member of the Interfraternity Council as
example of efforts to incorporate other
groups like the Greek system.
"We can bridge the gap between the var
ious student groups on campus," said
Curry. "Our party has made a huge com
mitment to groups on campus. We have the
mechanisms in place for action and have
already earned trust from those groups."
Experience with various campus groups
is something that the slate is not lacking,
its members say. Curry and Lee are both
currently undergraduate sena
tors. Johnson has worked in the
Black Student Union, and Pear
son is active in the Women's Cen
ter Collective and Students for
Peace.
Part of the slate's campaigning
will focus upon past accomplish
ments of the People's Platform,
members said.
"People's Platform has taken
the initiative on the important
issues," said Lee. This year the
COP sponsored a campus leader
ship summit and helped organize
the activities of the war reaction,
including a two-day Teach-in and
the Post-War Teach-In, which
takes place today, she said.
Multiculturalism will also be a
focus of their campaign. "There
have been concrete successes in
the area of multiculturalism. We
will continue to work with people
in order to form a multicultural
environment on campus," Pear
son said. "Multiculturalism
requires a fundamental respect
for others and their opinions and

we ean help further it."
Members of the slate also
defend the role of the ASSU Sen
ate in debating national issues.
"The ASSU should focus on
Stanford issues, but we should
not exclude important national
issues that affect everyone,"
Curry said. He is sponsoring a
constitutional amendment on the
ballot requiring the senate to
solicit student opinion before
passing bills on national issues.
"It is a matter of representa
tion," Lee said. "Students want
us to represent them accurately
and for us to act responsibly. This
proposed amendment will allow
us to do that."
The slate does not want to
limit itself to continuing the poli
cies of the current COP Members
said they plan to focus on many
more issues.

For example, they will work to
fully implement the suggestions
made by the 1989 University
Committee on Minority Issues
report and the sexual assault task
force report, Pearson said. A sex
ual assault officer and full

staffing of the community centers
headline the needs documented in
the reports that are still unmet.
"We realize that resources are
limited, but we can look for off
campus funding instead of relying
completely upon the University,"
Pearson said.
Student services will also be a
significant issue in the campaign.
Curry promises that the long
awaited ASSU Course Guide will
be completed next year and that
the new business project — either
a videotape rental or compact disc
exchange store — will be imple
mented.
The "Stand and Deliver" mem
bers said they also want to work
for graduate students, a group
often ignored by the ASSU. The
high expense of child care causes
financial problems for many grad
uate students, and the COP
would organize a listing of stu
dents and families willing to
babysit, Johnson said.
But perhaps the most impor
tant responsibility of the ASSU is
communication with the stu
dents, Currv said.
