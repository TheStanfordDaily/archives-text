# STAGE
## Berkeley theater-in-the-ground serves Shakespeare 
### 
"All's Well That Ends Well" is
performed at LaVal's Pizzeria,
located at 1834 Euclid Ave,
half a mile north of Hearst Ave.
Student tickets for Subter
ranean Shakespeare are $6.
Call 540-7743 for reservations.
Shakespeare has always been subtle.
He's always used subterfuge. And now
he's subterranean — which has noth
ing to do with the way he's buried. In
fact, the master genius' bones are
above ground in Westminster Abbey.
But that is largely irrelevant.
In the bowels of a Berkeley pizzeria,
there brews a tiny underground the
ater where actors crisscross a check
ered stage as their audience munches
pizza and swills cheap red wine.
It ain't the Globe Theater. It's not
even Dinkelspiel. But Subterranean
Shakespeare, located in the cellar of
LaVal's Pizzeria, is romantic, charming
and quintessentially Berkeley. Both the
town and the theater are a refreshing
change from sterile Stanford and Palo
Alto.
The company is actually three years
old, a brainchild of young director and
actor Stanley Spenger, who stars in the
currently running romantic comedy
"All's Well That Ends Well."
Despite occasional chair-scraping
overhead, and despite the usual pizze
ria chaos, the concept works. The stage
area is small — so small that it cuts
through the audience seating area.

Stage direction for "All's Well" com
pensates for this, however, so no one in
the audience has to look at the actors'
backs for very long.
This particular production of "All's
Well That Ends Well" brings the com
edy into the early 20th century. Char
acters wear tuxedos, army uniforms
and long gowns. LaVal's doorman, a
black-clad man with a close haircut
and beret, surmised that this transpo
sition was economically motivated.
Whatever the reason, it was consistent
and effective, and did not interfere
with Shakespeare's language, or the
story.
"All's Well's" plot is like most
Shakespeare comedies — based on
unrequited love and peppered with
mistaken identity.
Helena, the lady-in-waiting to the
Countess of Rossillion falls in love
with her mistress' son, Bertram.
Because she saves the King of France
from death, Helena is allowed to
choose a husband from the king's
assembly, to which Bertram belongs.
She chooses him, of course. He refuses
her, of course. And the chase is on.
Linda Bushnell plays the love
struck Helena well. Bertram, played by
director Stanley Spenger is less persua
sive. Judging his interpretation of
Bertram, it is puzzling why Helena
started loving him, more puzzling why
she continued. The production would
have been stronger if Spenger gave his
audience a reason to root for Helena.
The production certainly has its
strong points, though. Matt
BlOmquist, as Bertram's sleazy friend
Parolles, is hilarious, and the support
ing cast is surprisingly strong as well.
If you want to see really good
Shakespeare, take a weekend and go to
Ashland. But if you want to see decent
Shakespeare in a one-of-a-kind spot,

and maybe have some pizza on the
side, visit Berkeley's underground
treasure.
To go or not to go just shouldn't be
a question.
