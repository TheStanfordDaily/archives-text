# Breaking down walls to heal a war-torn nation
## 
### 
* Walls" will be performed in
The Nitery Theater tonight
through April 13 at 8 p.m. and
on April 14 at 2 p.m.
Over 50,000 names are etched on a
stark black, granite wall in Washing
ton, D.C. Each name is a story, and
each person who visits the Vietnam
Veterans Memorial sees his own his
tory, reflected alongside his face, in the
opaque surface of the structure.
The stories of these visitors, and
those they mourn, are juxtaposed with
the history of the memorial in "Walls,"
an emotionally charged and artfully
executed play presented by the Asian
American Theatre Project.
Powerful and moving, "Walls" aims
to separate the warrior from the war. A
series of loosely intertwined vignettes
explore the painfully human experi
ences of visitors to the memorial, delv
ing into their personalities and histo
ries for the reason they visit the wall.
First performed by a professional
Asian American theater group in San
Francisco, "Walls" was written by
Stanford alumnus Jeannie Barroga in
1985, after several years of researching
the subject.
Barroga paid close heed to actual
events in the writing of "Walls," and
the script contains only direct quotes
from Maya Lin, the soft-spoken, 21-
year old Yale student whose bold,
modern design for the memorial was
selected among thousands of entries in
an open competition.
Each character in "Walls" has a
name. They desperately struggle
against stereotypes, against being cate
gorized as they were for many years as

soldiers and hippies, blacks and
whites. They want to be known and
recognized as individuals.
Each actor's performance was
fraught with emotion, each character
fragile with the weight of burdensome
memories. Particularly memorable
among them is Stu, a young Asian-
American who loaded body bags in
Vietnam. The soldier, played by
sophomore Wai Lee, lost a part of him
self with each dead comrade he sent
home, and must now struggle to
regain his identity.
A moving performance was also
delivered by graduate student Linda

Roberts as Julie, a former flower child
who lost two former boyfriends in the
war. Sitting in front of the wall, Julie
insists in a trance-like voice that her
friends are there, that she could feel
them, almost see them.
The appearance of her youthful
buddies (portrayed by senior Bryan
Cho and sophomore David Willis) on
the stage evokes a powerful sensation
as audience members see their best
friends and even themselves in the
alternately gleeful and somber pair.
The directing and staging in
"Walls" were superb, and an interest
ing effect was achieved by situating

segments of the action — namely the
politics and bargaining going on out
side of the public eye — on a platform
within the audience.
The set design in the Nitery Theater
was also brilliant in its simplicity. A
low, triangular, black stage angles
down toward the audience and actors
sit or stand in front of it — facing the
stage as if it were the wall itself. The
stark, black background focuses the
audience's attention exclusively on the
actors, just as the wall forces the char
acters to confront themselves.

An argument erupts between Vietnam veteran Jan Scruggs (graduate student Bryan Brown) and Rich (freshman
Henry Wong), as they argue over the design for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in "Walls," a play presented by the
Asian American Theater Project.
