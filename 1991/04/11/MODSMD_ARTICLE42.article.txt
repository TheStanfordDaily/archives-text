## The 						Posies perform at Dinkelspiel

Seattle's latest national phe
nomenon, disarming pop fantastics
The Posies, embody the essence of
melodic rock with all the charm of a
throwback and all the impact of now.
The band's latest album, "Dear 23,"
sounds like a melding of the British
invasion with the wiser Detroit poppi
ness of Alex Chilton's '60s combo, Big
Star. But it's a sophisticated layering
only sonically possible in the post-
Cure world.
Listeners accustomed to the aggres
sion of the past decade's underground

sounds may find The Posies too much
of a reversion to dated aesthetics. But
others who are, like The Posies them
selves, oblivious to the implications of
era, will be enchanted by the vivid and
ageless "pure pop" strains that stand
out from the harder, faster techno
murk of the alternative rock world.
Their stand-apart sound and
formidable talent, combined with
more than a smidgen of fate, have
brought The Posies nationwide atten
tion.
Jon Auer and Ken Stringfellow are
the guitar-vocals-songwriting team
that formed the band primarily as a
recording project.
Last year, working to record "Dear
23" gave the act a chance to combine
its fresh musical character, precocious
tunesmithing and sophisticated
arrangements with the track record of
XTC producer John Leckie. Band and

producer together created a brilliant
rushing wave of melodic textures.
Like many of the British groups of
the '60s, these guys are analyzing the
adult world from a disgusted or puz
zled naive kid's point of view. "Sud
denly Mary" and "Mrs. Green" may
remind you of the Kinks' "Well
Respected Man" or the Beatles'
"Eleanor Rigby."

The Posies will appear on Wednesday
April 17 at 8 p.m. in Dinkelspiel Audi
torium.
