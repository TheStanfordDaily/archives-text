The distinguished man, dressed ele
gantly in designer suit and tie, dears his
throat and subtly leans down to whisper
in the ear of the gowned beauty on his
arm.
"I've studied chamber music exten
sively, and this performance promises to

be exquisite," he intones, with a slightly
British accent. The two are seated, and
the music commences.
These are the images often associ
ated with classical music. However, the
Stanford String Quartet casts off these
stereotypes, giving "exquisite" perfor
mances to be enjoyed by all. Such a
performance of works by Foret,
Beethoven and Boccherini will take
place this weekend in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium.
The quartet views this performance
as the delayed conclusion of its
national and international Centennial
Tour of 1988.
Acclaimed by the San Francisco
Examiner in 1986 as "... the finest
ensemble of its kind in the country,"
the quartet has an extensive repertory
of works-
They have premiered scores by
American composers, such as Pulitzer
Prize-winner William Bolcolm, and
have performed for capacity crowds
everywhere from the Palace of Fine
Arts in San Francisco to Amerikahaus
in Frankfurt, Germany.
In residence at Stanford since 1983,
the quartet's members are all distin
guished musicians with a wealth of
awards as well as national and interna
tional performing experience to their

credit. All are members of the Stanford
faculty, devoting one-half of their time
to teaching their art and the other half
to performing it.
Cellist Stephen Harrison is a
founding member of the quartet.
Coordinator of Stanford's chamber
music program, Harrison holds
degrees from both the Oberlin Conser
vatory of Music and Boston University.
Violist Bernard Zaslav has been a
Stanford String Quartet member since
1985. A graduate of Julliard. Zaslav
began his long, illustrious career with
the Cleveland Orchestra in 1948. He
has since then recorded over 100 pieces
on his distinctive instrument, an "ex-
Villa" viola made by J.B. Guadagnini in
1781 in Turin, Italy.
Violinist Susan Freier has been per
forming with the quartet since 1989. A
Stanford alumnus, Freier was a mem
ber of the Indiana University faculty
from 1980-89.
Violinist Phillip Levy is the newest
member of the quartet. Selected after
an extensive search, he arrived at Stan
ford in January of this year.

The Stanford String Quartet will per
form on Saturday at 8 p.m. in Dinkel
spiel Auditorium.
