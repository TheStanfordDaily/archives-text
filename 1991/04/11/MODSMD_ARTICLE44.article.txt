# The 						Movie Stars rock the Coffee House
## 
### June Cohen 
Even the most dedicated students
will have a hard time sticking to their
books this Tuesday when the Movie
Stars, an eclectic and energetic young
band quickly gaining national acclaim,
takes the stage at the Coffee House.
Urban folk is one category that's
been devised to describe the Movie
Stars' sound. But the young perform
ers' clever blending of seemingly dis
parate sounds defies categorization.
The San Francisco-based fivesome
combines a bevy of American music
styles, including rock, pop, polka and
bluegrass, to achieve their distinctive
and intriguing, high-energy sound.
Their latest album, "Head on a
Platter," has won critical acclaim for its
witty lyrics, smooth male/female har
monies and complex instrumentation.
But most of all, the Movie Stars are
known for their style: their carefree
and irreverent spirit and ability to get a
crowd moving.
