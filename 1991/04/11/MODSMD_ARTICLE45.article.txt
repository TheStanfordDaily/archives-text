# Intermission's Ultimate Beach Surival Guide

It happens every time. If it's not the towel, it's
the lotion, the food or the house keys. You get to
the beach; you reach for item X; you find you've
left item X at home.
Bummer.
Lucky for you, there's a solution.
Me.
No, you don't have to take me to the beach with
you. (Although I don't get out much and I do need
a tan.) Instead, you can benefit from my years of
beach-going experience (and forgetfulness) just by
reading the following list.
Read it. Learn it. Live it.
But most of all, bring it.
Bathing suit: You laugh, but think of how
embarrassing it could be. You take off your shorts
to find,...
Towels: Not just one, but two — one to lie on,
one to use to dry off. Bringing more can't hurt
either, especially if you forget the above item.

Suntan lotion: Those usually unexposed areas
can be mighty sun-sensitive. Get my point?
Reading material: Pay attention, this is impor
tant. Course readers, Plato and anything with the
word postmodernism in the title are strictly for
bidden. Anything involving higher brain functions
is not allowed. Stick to trashy, mindless books and
magazines only. You know — Danielle Steele, Sid
ney Sheldon, Stephen King, Cosmopolitan —
everything you loved before you found out you
weren't supposed to.
Music: Some beaches still allow radios, and rest
assured that the person who chooses to lay his or
her towel down right next to you will have the
most appalling taste in music. Take a Walkman.
(Don't forget tapes or headphones, either.)
Batteries: No explanation needed.
Food: Do you really want to pay $5 to eat the
smallest, greasiest hamburger you can get in a
country with federal health standards? I doubt it.
Pack some fruit, a s<jn<i-wich and LOTS of drinks.
Money: Don't leave home without it.
Volleyball: Even if you don't know how to play,

it looks impressive. You'll look fun, fit and oh-so-
Californian. Besides, it makes a good pillow.
Kite: I, personally, hate kites. I can never get
them to fly, and I end up running around dragging
a piece of cloth on the ground. But enough about
me.
Surfboard: Compared to surfboards, I'm a kite
wizard. An expert.
Frisbee: This is the one beach sport I can han
dle, thus you must be able to do it too. It almost
makes you feel like you're shaping up while getting
a tan. The only problem: Someone's dog will grab
the frisbee and never give it back. Maybe you
should bring two.
Raft: No coordination or skill needed. Induces
sleep. My kind of activity.
Pail and shovel: How else will you build a sand
castle? Or collect shells? Or pour freezing-cold
water on your sister while she's asleep? Heh heh
heh.
Paper and pen: Just to let your friends on the
East Coast know what you're doing while they're
waiting for spring thaw.
