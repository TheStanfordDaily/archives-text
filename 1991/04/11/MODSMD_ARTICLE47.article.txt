## Stupid, mutant, pre-teenage drivel 
### 
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
II: The Secret of the Ooze," star
ring Donatello, Leonardo,
Michelangelo and Raphael.
I have no one to blame but myself.
There are tons of new movies out
there; I had my choice. I could have
seen anything. I could have seen an
Oscar-winner. I could have seen a
Golden Globe-winner. I could have
seen a winner, period.
But, no. I chose to see a film about
four overgrown, brain-damaged,
pizza-snarfing turtles.
What was I thinking?
Clearly, I wasn't.
I mean, I should have known:
• It's a sequel. As a rule, sequels are
never half as good as their predeces
sors. Take "Arthur II," "Psycho II" and
"Grease II," for example. I rest my case.
• It's a movie about reptiles. Rep
tiles that wear masks and talk with Cal
ifornia surfer accents, even though
they grew up in the sewers of New York
City. How bodacious.
• It's aimed at 10-year-olds. I like to
hang with the younger crowd, but I
had some trouble dealing with the
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle action
figures being thrown around the the
ater. Not to mention the screams of
"Ewww! Cooties!" whenever one of the
turtles flirted with April, the female
reporter.
• Vanilla Ice. Need I say more?
So you're probably wondering, did
I really expect to enjoy a movie about a
back-from-the-dead, metal-clad ninja
warrior; four lower-on-the-evolution
ary-scale creatures; a bottle of green,
radioactive ooze; and a rat?
Yes, I did. Believe it or not, I actu
ally liked the first turtle movie. So it
didn't leave critics raving. So it wasn't

nominated for an Academy Award. So
it won't go down in history as a classic.
So what?
It was cute, funny and entertaining.
It made me laugh, as opposed to this
drivel, which made me wonder if I had
left the stove on at home.
And I don't have a stove.
"Turtles II" was stupid, predictable,
irritating and boring. The novelty had
worn off, the lines were stale and even
I could have staged the brief fight
scenes better.
Totally bogus, dude.
