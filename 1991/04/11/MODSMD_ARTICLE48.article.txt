Sissy Spacek
In December 1956, the U.S.
Supreme Court ruled that blacks were
free to ride the bus without seating
restrictions. No longer would they
have to pay the bus driver at the front,
exit the bus, walk to the rear entrance,
re-board the bus and take a seat
behind the whites.
This monumental court decision
was reached partially as the result of an
intensely passionate bus boycott car
ried out in Montgomery, Alabama in
1955. The hard-fought battle is per
sonified by the relationship of an
upper-class housewife and her maid in
"The Long Walk Home." Director
Richard Pearce presents a stirring
account of the way in which the event
transformed the lives of each of these
women.
Whoopi Goldberg is stoic as Odessa
Cotter, the maid who boycotts the bus
system and is forced to hike the long
distance to and from work each day.

Though the soles of her feet become
blistered and bloodied, she adamantly
refuses to step onto the bus and com
promise her pride. Her quiet, serene
strength is pervasive and empowering
as it is inherited by her employer.
Sissy Spacek is Miriam Thompson,
the gentile Southern belle whose value
system and loyalty to her husband are
challenged by the racial tensions in the
town. Though she has naively ignored
politics in the past, she is forced to
acknowledge the racial strife in Mont
gomery when her maid is unable to
show up for work in the morning.

Miriam's subservience to her hus
band is relinquished when she begins
to chauffeur Odessa to work in the
mornings.
Her driving begins as a self-indul
gence as she is unwilling to go without
maid service, but it results in a fervent
support of the boycott as she comes to
understand the ignorance and hatred
of racism. She becomes compelled to
challenge the segregated status quo
and is forced to accept the disdain of
her husband.
The female protagonists are the
embodiment of faith and strength in

this forceful, heartfelt drama. This film
must be seen as it serves as a reminder
of the destruction and irrationality of
intense racism. The battle fought was
arduous and painful and it cannot be
forgotten, simply for the reason that it
is not fully over.
