"The Festival of Animation,"
showing at Gunn High School
in Palo Alto
I was really looking forward to this
year's "Festival of Animation," as the
annual compilations of animated
shorts have been funny, enlightening
and entertaining in the past.
Unfortunately, I was disappointed.
The two-hour long collection of
films was amusing at times; but, over
all, it was neither as funny nor as ani
mated as it should have been.
Two treasures, however, made the
trip to the theater almost worthwhile:
"A Grand Day Out," and Academy
Award-winning "Creature Comforts."
Both shorts were created by Nick Park,
a veritable master of clay animation.
"Creature Comforts" is a documen
tary investigating the lives of various
zoo-confined animals. The animals
speak directly to the audience, voicing
their opinions about their homes
behind bars.
In one interview, a Brazilian jaguar,
perched atop a synthetic tree, thought
fully explains in a Portuguese accent
why he prefers his native country to
the zoo.
"I need zee space," he explains, ges
turing expressively with his paws to the
ever-present microphone. "Here, we
have zee technological advancements.
But een Brazeel, we have zee space.
And eet eez hot. I like to leev een a hot
country."
Polar bears, baboons and seals
make similarly insightful comments.
"A Grand Day Out" features an
older British gentleman and his dog.
The two are planning a vacation and
decide to go "somewhah whah thah's
cheese."
Their journey takes off (literally)
when they check their "Cheese Holi
days" journal and decide to build a
bright orange rocket ship to fly to the

moon. Why the moon? Because, as
everyone knows, the moon is made of
green cheese.
"A Grand Day Out" is extremely
original, both in plot and dialogue. To
be sure, it's somewhat juvenile, but it is
about clay figures, after all.
Park is brilliant in his creativity and
use of subtle humor. His work is clever,
yet cute at the same time — without
being annoying.
'Creature Comforts' is a
documentary investigating
the lives of zoo-confined
clay animals. In one
interview, a Brazilian
jaguar, thoughtfully
explains in a Portuguese
accent why he prefers his
native country to the zoo.
With the exception of these two
films, the rest of the pieces were not
amusing and- far too long. I found
myself struggling desperately to figure
out what the foreign films mean, and
then deciding that I didn't really care
that much.
For example, take "Wolf Suite," a
film that appears to hail from Eastern
Europe. "Wolf Suite" features a village
of identical, turbanned shepherds with
extremely phallic noses, all of whom
shave sheep and club cute blue wolves
to death.
I have no idea what it meant and
you probably won't either.
And at the other end of the spec
trum are simply executed clips such as
"Simon," the heart-breaking and
heart-warming story of an endearing
little boy who's "an average 8-year old,
except for one thing, [he] was born
without a nose."
Cute, yes. But I felt like I was
trapped in a nightmarish remedial les
son in multiculturalism.
Finally, there are public service
messages, like "Under the Egg-flu
ence," which features a red-nosed, hic
cuping egg who drives home smashed
and gets, you guessed it, smashed even
more. Appropriately graphic for the
subject matter, but not the kind of
stuff I'd usually pay $6.50 to see.
