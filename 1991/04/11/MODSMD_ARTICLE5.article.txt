Members of this year's "Students First"
Council of Presidents slate said their top

The slate consists of sophomores Beth
Morgan and Benny Sandoval, junior John
Louie and graduate student John
Overdeck. It is sponsored by the Students
First party, which was formed two years

Morgan, who is currently the deputy
senate chair and served as chair of the
ASSU Senate Student Affairs Committee
earlier this year, said she would like to see
the ASSU concentrate on improving stu

"Students are enthusiastic, but we need to

them and get more student input."
Morgan said her slate, if elected, would
like to buy a page in The Daily several times
a quarter to update students on ASSU
activities. Another plan is to take phone
