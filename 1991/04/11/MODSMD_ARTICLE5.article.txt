# 'Students First' will give more from less

### Miranda Doyle Staff writer 
Members of this year's "Students First"
Council of Presidents slate said their top
priorities will be to increase student ser
vices and facilitate the efforts of student
groups. They also want to cut the current
COP salary by 20 percent.
The slate consists of sophomores Beth
Morgan and Benny Sandoval, junior John
Louie and graduate student John
Overdeck. It is sponsored by the Students
First party, which was formed two years
ago.
Morgan, who is currently the deputy
senate chair and served as chair of the
ASSU Senate Student Affairs Committee
earlier this year, said she would like to see
the ASSU concentrate on improving stu

dent services and opening lines of commu
nication between students and the adminis
tration.
"The ASSU has incredible resources
that are not put to much use yet," she said.
"Students are enthusiastic, but we need to
help them channel their energies, inform
them and get more student input."
Morgan said her slate, if elected, would
like to buy a page in The Daily several times
a quarter to update students on ASSU
activities. Another plan is to take phone
polls to find out student opinion.
Overdeck, a graduate senator and chair
of the ASSU Budget and Finance Commit
tee. said he is "amazed at the way [the
ASSU] spends its money."
Overdeck. who co-authored an amend-
ment on the ballot that would
limit the scope of senate debate to
campus issues, said he was con
cerned "the ASSU has completely
lost its focus on students." He
added that he would like to see
COP salaries cut 20 percent
unless students vote for salary
increases. "We feel that the cur
rent COP has not been earning
their $5,000 per year."
"If the ASSU does not fight for
Stanford students, no one else
will," he said. "Nobody is advocat
ing for the students."
Overdeck added that he is
amazed the campus runs as well
as it does with so little input from
students.
He also said he wants to ensure
that graduate students, who
make up 51 percent of the student
body, are not "just another source
of revenue" through student fees.
"In order for this to be a working
system, we need to be responsive
to grad students," he added.
Sandoval, who is from Mexico,
said she is very interested in stu
dent diversity. "All students at
Stanford can participate and put
in their voices," she said.
This year, Sandoval started the
Latino Student Association and is
currently the director of cultural
affairs for the organization. She
also worked with the Save Our
Latino Resources group in its
failed attempt to save the Office
of Mexican-American Affairs
from being closed.
Morgan said it is important to
focus on more than just a few
groups when dealing with diver
sity. "There are a lot of communi
ties on this campus that need to
be listened to," she said. "We
should concentrate on experienc
ing other cultures as much as we
can, learning about different
experiences and how they shaped
certain perspectives."
Sandoval agreed, adding that
the focus should not just be on
ethnicity but on every person at
Stanford. "We are here for every
one," she said.
Louie said his "love for finding
out what other students believed"
was fostered by his tenure on the
The Daily editorial board earlier
this year, which allowed him to be
in touch with people's feelings
about campus issues. Louie also

served as news features editor.
He added that he has "a sin
cere personal interest" in pre
venting sexual assault. "I think
there are ways as COP members
we can make the campus a safer
place. . . . There are so many
unlighted places. There is a feel
ing of Stanford being a refuge,
but we should keep in mind that

it is not the safest we can make
it."
Louie suggested installing
more lighting, emergency tele
phones and evening shuttles to
improve safety.
With only one year left at Stan
ford, he said he believes there are
fundamental things that must be
addressed.
