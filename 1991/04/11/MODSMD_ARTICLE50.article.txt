novel presents a frightening picture of an Orwellian

also discusses the past and his reasons for choosing
his bureaucratic job over their relationship. Her reply
follows, then comes a "report" from the government
security forces.
Christopher Unborn
Carlos Fuentes
Translated by Alfred MacAdam and Carlos Fuentes
Vintage Books, 531 pages, $12.95
Renowned author Carlos Fuentes has produced in
"Christopher Unborn" a work of stunning satire and
biting irony, a politically charged commentary on
modern Mexico, which, despite its profound
insights, still fails to engage the reader.
"Christopher Unborn" tells the stories of a ragged
cast of characters, centered around Angel and Ange
les, and their newly conceived son (Christopher, of
course), who narrates the story from his privileged
position in utero.
