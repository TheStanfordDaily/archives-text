Rick Hillis pulls no punches in his new
collection of short stories. Like any prize
fight, the event is not always pleasant to wit
ness, yet his stories are true to life.
Hillis, who is from the Canadian
province of Saskatchewan, was a Stegner
Fellow at Stanford and is currently a Jones
Lecturer in the Creative Writing Program.
"Limbo River," his first collection, includes
nine stories, all of which are set in rural,
western Canada.
The world Hillis recreates with
both directness and occasional
humor is often hard to swal
low.
The stories of "Limbo River" often deal
with closely intertwined familial relation
ships. These working-class people are often
beset by problems including loss, death and
alcoholism as in the title story.
The world Hillis recreates with both
directness and occasional humor is often
hard to swallow. The characters in many of
the tales, including "Blue," "Betty-Lou's
Getting Out Tonight," "Big Machine" and
"Limbo River," tell the stories of those "liv
ing lives of quiet desperation."
In "Summer Tragedy Report," the narra
tor is a boy of 13, "farmed off to my uncle's
place in the country." The boy is an outsider
and is more intelligent than the older peo
ple he is surrounded by.
This story is one of the more delightful
in the collection. It lacks the array of annoy
ing characters whose lives are intertwined in
a convoluted fashion in both "Blue" and
"Big Machine."
In the fourth story of the collection,
"Eagle Flies On Friday; Greyhound Runs at
Dawn," Hillis depicts the life of a young
musician who achieves fame at The New
port Folk Festival in 1966 at age 18. At the
Festival's final performance he ad-libs "a 58-
minute instrumental" and is later compli
mented by Jerry Garcia of the Grateful
Dead. "That was beautiful, man, ... What
happened that made you feel so deep so
young?" Ironically, the young man feels he
hasn't suffered enough to deserve his fame,

and loses his hand later that year in a farm
accident.
The story describes the man's life over
the years. He continues to play guitar and
later falls in love with a woman with whom
he shares his tent. During this meager exis
tence he seeks inspiration from the moun
tains of the northern Rockies. From such an
auspicious start and climactic opening the
narrative falters.
His friend "Ava" later departs with a
traveling salesman who offers her financial
security and an unending supply of cartons
of cigarettes. The salesman says to the musi
cian, "One hand, no cash, not a whole lot
going for you futurewise, balding hair,
ragged outward appearance — stop me if

I'm wrong, but I don't think I'd be far off
base to say you're dead weight in the world."
Not until the final story, "Limbo River,"
do man and nature play along to create
transcendence. At an amusement park of
rickety rides, the young boy of the title story
enjoys a ride with a man who has become a
surrogate father for him; Marcel is an alco
holic who has lost his own son in the past.
In this story, the prose holds a nearly
menacing character; it seems danger and
happiness are always very close together:
"Marcel's change flew out of his pockets,
whizzed out past ears like shrapnel. My
heart tore free of my chest and I felt it in my
mouth. We dove toward the ground, but at
the last minute were scooped up, swirling

through the blackness, me and Marcel,
screaming at the stars between our toes."
Hillis' style shows varied literary influ
ences. He acknowledges legendary Cana
dian author Farley Mowat's impact on his
writing. He notes, "Mowat was part of one's
schooling while growing up in
Saskatchewan." Other influences are appar
ent: Hillis seems to fit in with the Raymond
Carver school of coarse realism. And the
preoccupation with hunting contained in
"The Storytellej" and elsewhere is reminis
cent of the early work of Ernest Hemingway
Many of the themes present in these sto
ries also appear in Hillis' recently published
collection of poems, "The Blue Machines of
Night."
