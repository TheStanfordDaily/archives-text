After lunch, I got out my book about Plato and tried to
learn myself about him, but by and by I found out he been
dead a considerable long time; so then I then I didn't care
no more about him, because I don't take no stock in dead
people.
Purt soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst
the trees — somethin was a-stirrin'. I set still and listened. I
could just barely hear a "me-yow! me-yow!" down there.
That was good! Says I, "me-yow! me-yow!" and scrambled
out of the window.
There was Jim, he says "Looky here, Huck. You ain't got
no good classes. I ain't got none. Less go raftin'."
We went tiptoeing along a path amonst the trees back
toward the end of the Enchanted Broccoli Forest. Jim and
me we crawled amongst the brush 'til we got to the water. It
ain't no Mississippi River, but Lake Lagunita got some
adventures too.
We climbed board and afore ya know it we hit a bunch
o' them kayakers. The first fella he said he been out there
ever since the water came back. His name is Rex and he says
it helps his grades but I don't believe him none. He says
kayaking gives him a better perspective. I said 'twas sunny
'nuff for me.
Then me and Jim pushed off and headed tword the mid
dle. I pulled off my shirt, but the girl in the bikini didn't take
no notice. I jumped in and dove all the way to the bottom
— bout ate or nine feet — but she said she still didn't take
no notice. So I swum over and interduced myself.
"Hi, I'm Huck Finn," I says.
I asked her if she wanted to come raftin' wit us, but she
said her sunnin' oyl would come off in the water and she

didn't want to muss her hair up.
So I swum back to the raft. "Jim, gimme a chaw o' tobac
cer," I says.
We chawed for a bit and then the sun it got real warm
and we fell sleep. When I woke up the kayakers were gone
and the girl in the bikini was gone but Jim weren't gone so
I woke him up and we paddled back to shore.
The sun wus goin' down and we wus gettin' hungry so
we startin' headin' back. We paddled for a long time afore I
saw 'em. But then we got close to the shore and both Jim
and me could see 'em jus' fine.
We got up thar and we saw two men with a lantern
talkin' by a fire. We crawled real quiet like and lissened.
"It's up by the Dish," one of'em says.
"S'pose."
"Go tomorra?"
"S'pose."
"How much money you s'pose is thar?"
"Lots."
Jim and me we knew they were talking about Joel Stein's
buried treasure so we took off right quick for the Dish,
talkin' 'bout what we'd do with the money.
We ran the whole way. Jim hasn't been workin' out as
much as me so he was pantin' purty heavy by the time we
got there. We searched 'round for a bit but didn't find
nothin'.
"Think dem guys are liars, Huck."
"Can't be, Jim."
I sat myself down on a log.
"Well, now I be ding-busted!" Jim says. "Dat's a chest!"
I stood up and said it warn't no chest like the girl in the
bikini but it sure wus a treasure chest.
I opened up the chest and all thar wus wus a bunch of
crawdads. Dumb ol' Joel Stein.
