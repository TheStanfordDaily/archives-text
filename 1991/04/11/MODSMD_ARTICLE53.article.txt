# You — yes, you — may already have won 1 million dollars!

Chances are, there's a man in your
life you're trying to forget.
Perhaps you've surreptitiously
stuffed him in the recycling bin when
the crowds outside the post office dis
persed. Maybe you've just stepped on
his double-chinned, gloating, glossy
portrait.
No matter what means of destruc
tion or dismissal you've tried to
employ, you're probably noticed that
Ed McMahon, king of the American
Family Sweepstakes, cannot be deposed
— or disposed of — that easily. Haunt
ing Moneybags McMahon keeps on
coming back to your post office box,
ever eager to make you a "super-rich
multi-millionaire!"
So why fight him?
Once you get over the shock and
resentment that the large package you
espy inside your box is not, as it
appeared, a package from the hearth

crammed full of money and a home
made meal, you'll be able to open the
sweepstakes envelope calmly, without
ripping any of the "free money" or
"bonus American flag" certificates.
Be warned: After you have opened
the manila envelope and exposed
McMahon to the daylight, there is no
turning back! When you see your
name under the two TEN MILLION
DOLLAR winners, David Brumbalow
and Janine Hamblin, you'll automati
cally begin the frenzied licking and
pasting process. Not to mention the
hounding, self-questioning refrain:
"What will I do with all that money?"
Before you delve into the stakes lit
erature full force, be sure to first locate
the stamp that reads, "NO, I'M
STUPID AND I NEVER READ, SO
JUST ENTER ME IN THE SWEEP
STAKES AND KEEP YOUR MAGA
ZINES. (BECAUSE I'M NOT ONLY
STUPID, I'M ALSO CHEAP!)" [Slight
rephrasing.]
Protect yourself — stick this stamp

quickly! With the "NO" stamp in
place, you'll be sure not to give into
enticing, can't-live-without titles like
"Teenage Mutant Ninja TUrtles Maga
zine," "Simpsons Illustrated" and

"Creative Quilting."
Sweepstakes are designed by high
level psychologists. As you examine the
prize pictures on the entry, you'll be
struck by the similarity between your

latent desires and the stuff the sweep
stakes is offering. Look, for example, at
the dream house — the Roman arches,
the majestic mix of brick and stucco ...
How did they know?
A cold shiver may run up your
spine, as you wonder what other secret
tidbits McMahon knows about you.
"How did Ed McMahon ever guess
just how greedy and lazy I am?" you
ask yourself, as you read through the
personal form letter.
The essence of the letter is con
tained in one verb-packed sentence:
"While other people keep struggling,
working, worrying, [Your NAME
here] could be busy, too — furnishing
a brand-new house, picking out new
cars, traveling around the world and
generally living it up."
The college version of this appeal,
scheduled to come out within the next
decade (after this writer secures a job
with the American Family Sweepstakes

Corporation), reads as follows, "While
other people are busy with midterms,
attending dorm meetings, waiting in
line at coffee houses, you'll be busy too
— paying off people to take your tests,
buying houses twice the size of your
nasty, cramped dormitory for your
OWN personal usage and buying cap
puccino makers directly from Italy so
you'll never have to go out to another
sweaty coffee house again.
Now that you've got McMahon
safely in the mail, don't just sit back
and wait for your $333,333 check
(because, due to a technicality, you
might not actually win; or, even if you
do, the check might get lost in the mail
or snacked on by McMahon before it
leaves his office). Now move on to
Publishers' Clearinghouse.
With all their stamps and stickers,
both sweepstakes provide an excellent
diversion for students — a potentially
rich and rewarding study break.
