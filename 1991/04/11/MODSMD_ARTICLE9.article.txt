Official cease-fire begins today
UNITED NATIONS (AF) - An official
cease-fire in the Gulf War is to take effect
today at 10 a.m. EDT, Security Council diplo
mats said yesterday, as long as no council
members object before then.
Also, U.N. officials said the first elements of
the new 1,440-member U.N. monitoring force
for the Iraq-Kuwait border will arrive tomor
row in Kuwait City.
Members of the council received copies of
the Iraqi Parliament's decision on Saturduy
accepting the Security Council's condit ions for
a permanent cease-fire.
The two-line Iraqi statement simply said
that the body accepts Security Council Resolu
tion 687, passed April 3, which requires Iraq to
pay for war damages and destroy its weapons
of mass destruction.
U.S-Cambodia relations thaw
WASHINGTON (AP) - U.S. officials had a
rare meeting with Cambodian diplomats today
and said normal relations may be possible once
a peaceful settlement is reached to Cambodia's
civil war, the State Department said.
The meeting was held between the top U.S.
diplomat in Laos and the Cambodian ambas
sador to that country. The United States has
not had either diplomatic or trade ties with
Cambodia in 16 years.
The discussion was similar to one held on
Tuesday in New York when U.S. officials out
lined for Vietnamese envoys the possibility of
step-by-step moves toward normal relations.
Census: large parts of Latino
population poor, unemployed
WASHINGTON (AP) — Large segments of
the nation's fast-growing Hispanic population
are still poor, unemployed, uneducated and
shut out of the best jobs, the Census Bureau
reported yesterday.
The nation's 22.4 million Hispanics made
small steps out of poverty and the unemploy
ment lines and toward a better-educated popu
lation during the past decade.
But when compared with the non-Hispanic
population, the picture for Hispanics is one of
large gaps in the race of life: 21 percent of His
panic children are poor, compared with 11 per
cent of all U.S. children; 26.6 percent of the
total Hispanic population is poor, compared
with 11.6 percent of non-Hispanics.
