The Pi Beta Phi sorority violated the Inter
sorority Council's Rush regulations Tuesday
night by giving a presentation that could be
construed as a skit.
The sorority has been fined $100 for the
incident.
ISC rules prohibit sororities from perform
ing skits during the first open-house parties,
said Allison Sandy, sorority adviser for the
Office of Student Activities. The regulation is
designed to maximize interaction between

sorority members and rushees.
Pi Phi President Cara Wall, a junior, said
that during her sorority's first open-house
party of the night, a presentation was made by
four sorority members while rushees were
seated on the ground. They were holding
arrows, the symbol of the sorority.
ISC President Erin Scalley said the ISC
found out about the skit and warned the soror
ity about the violation.
For subsequent open-house parties Tues
day and Wednesday night, the Pi Phis did not
use arrows when giving their presentation,
Wall said.

The ISC gave the Pi Phis the option of
either paying a $100 fine or not performing a
skit when the same Rush group visits their
tent again during one of the second open-house
parties, in which skits are allowed.
Wall said her sorority has decided to pay the
fine. The ISC was "very fair in giving us a
choice," she added.
Sorority Rush is being held in tents in
Wilbur Field. The first open-house parties took
place Tuesday and Wednesday. The second
open-house parties started last night and will
conclude tonight, and the invitational parties
will take place this weekend.
