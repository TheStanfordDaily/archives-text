Sparsely attended, yester
day's post war teach-in per
haps reflected the apathy of
Americans that many panelists
alluded to.

The teach-in, organized by
Students for Peace, concluded
with an evening panel discus
sion in Kresge Auditorium.
About 40 students heard Joel
Beinin, the outspoken associ
ate professor of history who
highly disagrees with U.S. pol
icy in the gulf, criticize the U.S.
involvement.
America has no problem
with military dictatorships
which are our allies, Beinin
said. U.S. policy "will create
further regional instability, not
peace," he continued.
On the issue of an interna
tional peace conference dealing
with the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict, Beinin was similarly
skeptical. Israel's participation
is largely for symbolic pur
poses, he said. Israel is
demanding veto power over the
members of the Palestinian
delegation, which inhibits
potential solutions, he added.
Khalil Barhoum, a lecturer
in linguistics, also opposed the
U.S. involvement. A Pales
tinian, Barhoum spoke about
the war's effect on the Pales
tinian population. For Arabs, a
new world order means main
taining a status quo "replete
with social and economic injus
tices," he said. -
Fred Lauson, professor of
Middle Eastern politics at Mills
College, talked about the divi
sion among the Arab countries
in the region. As shown by the
early adjournment of the
March 30 Arab League council

meeting, the Arab world "is
polarizing into different
camps" despite public state
ments to the contrary, Lauson
said.
The Arab world is divided
largely into those countries
that supported the United
States and those that did not,
he said. The Arab nations not
supporting the U.S. effort in
the Persian Gulf include
Yemen, Jordan, Tunisia and
Algeria. These are also the
most democratic of the Arab
states, Lauson added.
Israeli graduate student
Eviatar Shafrir changed the
serious tone of the discussion
when he presented political
cartoons on a screen. The car
toons included those from Arab
and Jewish newspapers.
One which particularly
elicited a response from the
audience pictured Bush as a
waiter, asking, "Good evening
gentlemen, may we please take
your new world order?"
Before coming to the United
States six years ago, Shafrir
served in the Israeli defense
forces. He said he does not
believe the Israeli government
is seriously seeking peace.
"The current Israeli govern
ment ... and political struc
ture . . . are incapable of nego
tiating with Palestinians or
Arabs." He predicted that the
government will fall before dia
logue begins.
An earlier session of the
teach-in held at the Law
School, titled "A Brief History
of U. S Foreign Policy,"
attracted about 14 students.
Guest lecturers who made pre
sentations remarked that the
lack of audience turnout could
reflect the American public's
apathy toward a war that has
not ended.
