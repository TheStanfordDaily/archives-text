Yugoslav leaders meet to
salvage fracturing federation
BRDO, Yugoslavia (AP) — The presidents of
Yugoslavia's six republics met again yesterday
to seek agreement on a peaceful restructuring
of the federation.
The speaker of Slovenia's Parliament said
as the talks opened that his republic was intent
on seceding by June. Croatia, the other West
ern-leaning republic, appeared to be moving
toward forming its own army.
One official said the republics' leaders were
examining two fundamentally different ideas
— a loose confederation of independent states
and a structure similar to the current national
government.
U.S. and European Economic Community
officials, whose financial support all six
republics need to overcome their economic
crises, have repeatedly warned against a
breakup of the country.
Panama, U.S. sign drug treaty
WASHINGTON (AP) - The United States
and Panama signed a treaty yesterday that
provides for the sharing of information in
investigations into drug smuggling and other
criminal offenses.
State Department deputy spokesman
Richard Boucher said the treaty provides for
the sharing of such information as govern
ment records, data on large currency transac
tions and other bank documents.
"Statements of witnesses, physical evidence
and information about the proceeds of criminal
activities may also be shared," Boucher said.
Yesterday's ceremony clears the way for the
release of more than $80 million in U.S. assis
tance to Panama. Congress had made release
of the funds contingent on Panama's willing
ness to sign the treaty.
Bush Appeals Court nominee
rejected by Senate panel
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Senate Judi
ciary Committee yesterday rejected President
Bush's nomination of Miami judge Kenneth L.
Ryskamp to a federal appeals court on a party

cuit Court of Appeals, had been accused of
being insensitive to civil rights issues and obliv
ious to widespread allegations that his country
club discriminated against blacks and Jews.
