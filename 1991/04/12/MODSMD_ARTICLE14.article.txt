# Israel, U.S. agree to exclude PLO from talks

### 
JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel and
the United States have agreed that the
PLO should be excluded from peace
negotiations and have pat aside tem
porarily the issue of Israeli withdrawal
from the occupied territories, the for
eign minister was quoted as saying
yesterday
The topics were among nine "points
of agreement" worked out in talks this
week between Israeli officials and vis
iting Secretary of State James A.
Baker 111, Israel radio said.
The radio said Foreign Minister
David Levy outlined them at a closed
door session of the 14-member
Defense Cabinet.
Levy was quoted as saying the

agreement specified a "two-track
approach" to peace â€” simultaneous
but separate negotiations between
Israel and the Arab states and Israel
and the Palestinians.
The agreement also ruled out Pales
tinian independence demands by
rejecting formation of a Palestinian
state, the radio reported.
Palestinians in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip consider the PLO
to be their legitimate representative.
Israel considers it a terrorist group
and refuses to negotiate with it.
The radio said Palestinians are to be
represented in peace talks only by res
idents of the occupied West Bank and
the Gaza Strip acceptable to Israel. It

rules out participation by Palestinians
from annexed east Jerusalem or in the
diaspora, it said.
In addition, the radio said, the
United States and Israel have agreed
that Israel would only negotiate in
accordance with its May 1989 plan,
which calls for talks on limited auton
omy with any negotiations on a final
settlement put off for three years.
The Soviet Union would have to
renew full diplomatic ties with Israel
before it joins in the peace process, the
radio quoted Levy as saying.
On U.N. Security Council Resolu
tion 242, which says Israel should
withdraw from war-won land, Levy
was quoted as saying: "The sides

agreed that the resolution has several
interpretations and would become an
issue for negotiations only at the end
of the peace process."
Levy said Israel would prefer to
negotiate with a joint Jordanian-Pales
tinian delegation, but has "agreed in
principle" to an independent Pales
tinian team, the radio reported.
Hard-line Housing Minister Ariel
Sharon immediately challenged Levy,
saying that Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir had assured ministers an inde
pendent delegation had been ruled out.
The radio quoted Shamir as
responding: "We do not want, nor do
we agree to, an independent Pales
tinian delegation."
