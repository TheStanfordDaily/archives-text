# Kurds continue to fight in mountains of Iraq

KORE, Iraq (AP) - Kurdish
rebels yesterday ambushed Iraqi
troops trying to punch deeper into
the mountains of northern Iraq,
killing at least 12 soldiers and
knocking out two tanks and an
armored personnel carrier.
The rebels said two guerrillas
were killed.
The attack by Saddam Hus
sein's forces came less than 24
hours after Washington an
nounced it had warned the Bagh
dad government over the weekend
not to launch armed actions
against Kurdish areas.
Rebel commanders said their
success against the Iraqi troops
was made easier because the army
had not used its deadly helicopter
gunships. The U.S. warning
specifically forebade the use of
military aircraft.
Meanwhile, Baghdad extended
an amnesty offer for some rebels,
but the mass exodus of the Kur
dish population continued. Scores
of refugees, particularly babies
and old people, are dying daily
from exposure, malnutrition and
disease.
In a mountain pass leading to
Iran, during one of the frequent
violent storms, mothers wrapped
babies and small children tightly

in blankets to protect them from
lashing by hail. They plodded up
the steep road, drenched to the
skin.
Many of those fleeing were
skeptical that the Bush adminis
tration's warning to Iraq will pro
vide them with any real protec
tion.
"We don't trust Bush's words
any more," said one refugee in
Diana, a town at the bottom of the
llaj Omran pass leading to Iran's
border.
"We cannot trust Saddam after
what he has done to our people.
We want safety for our children,"
said one refugee mother.
Iraq, trying to win back the
Kurds' confidence, said a general
amnesty will be extended by a
week for people inside Iraq and
two weeks for those outside,
according to a statement by the
official Iraqi News Agency, moni
tored in Cyprus.
The amnesty, offered this
month and due to expire today,
was for everyone who took part in
the rebellion except "for acts of
murder, rape, or theft which took
place under the conditions of the
incidents of rioting and treach
ery."
