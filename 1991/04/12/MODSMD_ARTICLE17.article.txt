Kennedy deserves vote
of confidence based on
whole of his tenure

THE RESULTS OF A recent
Daily poll do not translate
into a resounding vote of
confidence for University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy. We think he
deserves one.
When asked whether they
thought Kennedy should resign, a
slight majority (54 percent) of stu
dents polled said no. At the same
time, when asked to evaluate
Kennedy's overall performance as
the University's president, only 35
percent of the students polled said
they approve.
Without a doubt, present times
on the Farm are difficult. The
onslaught of a recession hurt the
University's finances; the Earth
quake of 1989 caused significant
damage, only compounding our
economic woes; and this academic
year has seen both the school as a
whole and especially Kennedy on
his own raked over the coals as
Stanford's accounting and cost
recovery practices have become
national news.
But does Kennedy deserve the
challenges to his professionalism
— and even his personal integrity
— which he has had to endure?
Just look at his face the next time
you see him on campus; he's
exhausted. Indeed, the effects of
recent months are all too visible in
the features of this normally jocu
lar and spirited man. Kennedy does
not deserve this lambasting.
During Kennedy's tenure, Stan
ford has solidified its position in
the uppermost echelon of educa
tional institutions in the country.
What's more, Kennedy has been
personally responsible for much of
this success.

One of the most important roles
a university president can play is
that of a leader, one whose enthusi
asm for and commitment to the
community are so palpable they
inspire others in the community to
excel. Has Kennedy filled this tall
order? To the extent a role model's
success cannot be measured so well
in the aggregate as in terms of indi
viduals who have been influenced,
each of us might answer this ques
tion differently. Doubtless, though,
some of us have been moved by
Kennedy's positive attitude and
the forthright and charismatic
manner in which he has kept in
touch with us.
Kennedy is not someone whom
students hear once when they
arrive and then once when they
graduate. Whether speaking on
KZSU radio or participating in a
panel discussion or a symposium,
Kennedy has made a habit of keep
ing in touch with the students.
Indeed, even during the indi
rect-cost controversy, Kennedy has
continued to grant frequent,
lengthy interviews to The Daily.
How many other university presi
dents, under similar circum
stances, would have spent so much
time keeping in contact with the
students?
Kennedy's accomplishments
have been of the more tangible
variety as well. In orchestrating
the University's repositioning
efforts, Kennedy showed tremen
dous foresight. Our financial woes
would likely be even worse had we
not planned for some of the short
fall.
Such praise notwithstanding,
there is always room for improve
ment. Right now, Kennedy needs to
lead an aggressive assault on our
accounting practices. Clearly, the
process has become larger than the
individuals in charge of it, and this
ill needs immediately to be
redressed. Kennedy must also con
tinue to keep students informed.
