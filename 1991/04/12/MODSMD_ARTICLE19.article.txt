## Intellectual guerilla war 
### 
THE DAILY REPORTS THE Peo
ple's Platform scored direct hits
yesterday on members of the Col
lege Republicans, fleeing back into the
tangled jungle of the ASSU. Packs of the
highly trained People's Platform Revolu
tionary Army have also raided Students
first strongholds in the fraternity houses.
The rebels reportedly caused minor
damage when they fired two rounds of
name calling, using their favorite weapon
— the racist/sexist/conservative-seeking
PC bomb. Before Students first could
respond, the rebels ran off in separate
directions, probably returning to their
many theme-house headquarters around
campus.
OR
Stanford Review sources report that
the Students first Republican Army of
Greek Elephant Cavalry stepped up their
attacks on the Loony Left. Using their
new secret weapon, the bureaucracy, they
have obstructed People's Platform move
ments. They have filled their ranks, using
incentives such as free beer and shelter
from the blistering heat of Res Ed.
It is also rumored that the Chaparral
will join the fray, deploying their unit of
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. These
sources may not be entirely credible.
You have just read two different, but
equally absurd, scenarios; both border on
the realities of the Stanford experience.
How so? Bear with us while we explain.
There is a war of dogma on campus. It
is a war without winners or losers, not
because there are not any soldiers, but
because the armies do not engage each
other directly, and when they do, they fire

blanks. The war is between polarized
political positions — the "Politically Cor
rect" and the "Reactionaries."
Both sides compete for control of stu
dent body ideology, whether in White
Plaza demonstrations, during Orienta
tion or on the floor of the ASSU Senate. It
has become increasingly clear that the
battle is not between substantive argu
ments; it is a battle of demagogic
speeches, unsupported opinions and
name-calling.
If we could step back to examine our
environment, how could we not laugh?
Who would think that The Wall Street
Journal could mention Stanford and the
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in the
same headline?
Assuming we are all the rational, rea
sonable, capable and intelligent people
the Office of Undergraduate Admissions
seemed to think we are, the absurdities
we read about in the paper and talk about
in our dorms result from one thing —
complacency.
Our complacency allows the absurd to
exist. It is almost as if there is a tacit
agreement: "If you don't attack my views,
I won't attack yours."
Instead of listening to and attacking
opponents' arguments, many students
are content to point out how "racist" or
how "PC" someone is. People often talk
without speaking, hear without listening
(Paul & Art).
It is startling to find that such a
diverse student body often defines itself
in easily identifiable categories. Can't we
look at each other as individuals? It is a
testament to Stanford's egotism that peo

pie believe they know a person's back
ground by finding out how they voted in
the campus election.
This is a problem because it discour
ages discussion. After only a couple of
classes, it is easy to see that the experi
ences that truly affect who we are do not
occur in some lecture hall; the changes
occur when we interact outside the class
room. Anytime we communicate, we
learn.
Communication forces us to reexam
ine and restructure our experience,
broadening our understanding of our
selves. Listening to the experiences of
others, in turn, broadens our understand
ing of them.
We may never know what it means to
be the other person, his experiences may
be totally foreign to us, but that is no
excuse to end or avoid discussion. Of
course a white male will never know fully
what it means to be a Hispanic female.
But no individual can fully understand
what it means to be another individual.
Our experiences are unique. The act of
communication builds trust, builds
friendships and builds communities.
Communication & Community. The simi
larity between these words is no coinci
dence.

Kofi Bruce will miss Andrew Katz, who
went to New York this week to start his
new career — modeling underwear for
the Sears fall catalog.
