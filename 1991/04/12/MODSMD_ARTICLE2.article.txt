# Hoover to give Yeltsin advice
## 
### Peter Robison Staff writer 
In what Hoover Institution Director
John Raisian called a first for an aca
demic institution in the United States,
the think tank plans to regularly advise
Russian President Boris Yeltsin on eco
nomic reform.
The new relationship evolved after
four Hoover scholars spent two weeks
advising Yeltsin and Russian officials in
Moscow last month, Raisian said.
He emphasized that "the arrange
ment has not been set yet," but instead
consists of "a letter of understanding"
with Yeltsin's advisers.
Yeltsin's chief economic adviser,
Mikhail Bocharov, proposed the
arrangement. Hoover scholars will write
position papers for the Supreme Eco
nomic Council of the Russian Republic,
which Bocharov chairs.
Bocharov emphasized that Hoover's
role will be strictly advisory. "They pro

pose things to us, but the experts of the
Supreme Economic Council ... of
course will make the decisions," he was
quoted as saying in yesterday's Los
Angeles Times.
Bocharov works closely with Yeltsin,
the chief political opponent of Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev. Yeltsin,
the chair of the Russian Parliament,
won new powers earlier this month to
impose reforms more radical than those
proposed by Gorbachev.
Many scholars think that unless the
Soviet Senate accepts Yeltsin's propos
als, further fragmentation of the Soviet
Union may result.
Raisian denied that Hoover, by advis
ing Yeltsin, will become embroiled in the
Soviet Union's internal political strug
gles.
"The notion that we're picking a
horse, by advising Yeltsin rather than
Gorbachev, is not something that is
intended by this," he said. "If Gor
bachev were to ask me to send a team of

economists to advise him, I would do so
in a minute. . . . This is not a political
action."
Edward Lazear, one of the scholars
on the March advising team, empha
sized Hoover's advisory role. "We won't
have influence directly," he said. "We
went over as consultants, at their invita
tion â€” it's not like we went over and
sold them on a free-market economy."
But Raisian said Hoover's input to
Bocharov's reforms may have implica
tions for all of the Soviet Union because
Bocharov is also a member of the
Supreme Soviet, the country's highest
legislative body.
Lazear agreed, saying Bocharov had
"explicitly" told the March consulting
team that it "should think of the plan as
affecting the entire Soviet Union, not
just the Russian Republic."
Raisian, however, downplayed the
role Hoover will play in Soviet politics.
