# Letters
## Residents of 558 May field sequestered in darkness 
### 
WE WOULD HAVE WRITTEN
this letter sooner, but we've only
been able to work on it during
the daytime since there isn't enough
light in our rooms at night.
As if the rooms at 558 Mayfield House
weren't poorly lit before spring break,
they have now been transformed into
caves. In the spirit of John Milton —
who, if you don't remember, went blind
"ere half [his] days, in this dark world"
— we might as well write our papers by
candlelight; it would be brighter than it
is under our new lights.
While we were away — sneaky,
sneaky, sneaky — the University
removed our old ceiling lights and their
100-watt incandescent bulbs and kindly
furnished us with less-than-resplendent
32-watt fluorescent rings. Whereas the
old fixtures had two 100-watt bulbs,
these fancy new fluorescent deals are,

according to their packaging, roughly
equivalent to one 75-watt incandescent
bulb.
Yeah right. Fireflies give off more
light.
Now, what do you figure the rationale
was in this enlightened switch of fix
tures? Well, it probably saves a lot of
energy. "Good," as President Bush would
say, his open hand gliding in front of him
to emphasize his point.
But each time we turn on the new
light, we can't see. So what do we do? We
turn on more lights. How many? Enough
to get us back to ante-spring-break lumi
nosity — and energy consumption.
"Bad," Bush asserts, a slightly different
hand gesture, this time with a comple
mentary tilt of his head, accompanying
his insight.
But bad jokes notwithstanding, this is
serious business. We're talking about

basic necessities here: Light by which to
read and write and see where you're
going so you don't bump into things is
not a lot to ask for.
You know what these lights — and we
use the term loosely — would be good
for? Hiding in the dark, maybe; they
don't even attract moths.
And these walls don't help, either.
What little light does emanate from the
fluorescent ring gets absorbed in the
Navajo white paint. And now the mes
sage turns universal; just about every
body on campus gets stuck with this
paint. Is it easy to clean or something?
You know, a perfect black body finish
would be even easier.
Of course, there is a bright side,
thanks to the street lamp next to our
volleyball court. And to be fair, even
though we don't have any replacement
rings, it's not like we'll need them in the

next decade; these things use up so little
juice they'll probably still be blinding
lucky residents for ages to come.
Don Kennedy, if you're reading this,
we don't want you to resign. But one
night, come by the house; we'll give you
a book to read under one of these shin
ing splendors, and you be the judge.
As Jay Tucker said at the ASSU State
of the Association address, "If we really
were going to build a Stanford family, we
would need to find out who was going to
pay for breakfast and which walls in the
house were going to get knocked down
first."
Think about it.
