# Columnist went easy on Arabs while berating Israelis
## 
### 
MAURITS VAN DER VEEN
rightly calls attention to some
intolerable human rights viola
tions in the Israeli occupied territories.
Unfortunately, in his blanket condemna
tion of the Israeli government, he
unfairly disregards the context of the
incidents. He also paints a far too rosy
picture of the antagonists to the state of
Israel.
Van der Veen promotes the fallacy
that the root causes of the Arab-Israeli
conflict are the policies of the Israelis.
This assertion ignores the persistent
refusal of Arab states, with the exception
of Egypt, to accept a "Zionist presence"
in the Middle East. The government of
Israel, in contrast, has sought compro
mise and direct negotiations with Pales
tinian Arabs and with representatives of
the surrounding Arab states.
Just this Tuesday, in fact, Israeli

Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir agreed
to a regional peace conference under U.S.
auspices. No Arab states have yet
decided to join him, let alone drop the
decades-long boycott of trade with Israel
and companies that do business with
Israel.
And yet, van der Veen fails to see "a
willingness to negotiate in good faith" on
the part of the Israelis. Moreover, he
implicitly justifies the Palestinian terror
ism on these grounds, claiming Israeli
intransigence makes it "almost less sur
prising." But Arabs have been murder
ing innocent Jewish civilians in the
name of God for decades, long before
Israel controlled the West Bank or the
Gaza Strip.
For that matter, contrary to popular
leftist myth, Israel did not occupy these
lands as part of some "Manifest Destiny"
vision of expansion. Only after three

defensive wars and the loss of thousands
of innocent lives did Israel take the terri
tories.
The West Bank and the Golan Heights
serve crucial strategic purposes since
they provide vantage points from which
to block potential invasion forces. As the
Gulf war demonstrated, even in the age
of high-tech aircraft and missiles, noth
ing substitutes for strength on the
ground.
The question remains, however, as to
when the Arabs will meet the Jews in
the middle. The Palestinians cheered
from their rooftops as they watched Iraqi
Scud missiles hit civilian Israeli targets.
When Secretary of State Baker visited
Israel for the first time, a Palestinian
man welcomed him by stabbing in the
back and killing an elderly Jewish
woman. In the past year, more Palestini

ans have been killed by fellow Palestini
ans than by Israeli troops.
The occasional human rights viola
tions by Israeli soldiers and civilians
should not and will not be tolerated.
Many Israeli Jews have been tried and
jailed for such crimes. Proponents of the
Arab enemies of Israel should look to see
if their own friends match up to the
same standards. Arab citizens of Israel
actually eryoy greater political rights and
protections than those in any Arab state.
Israel is the only true democracy in
the Middle East, and it is time for critics
like van der Veen to open their eyes to
this reality. Regional peace and Pales
tinian self-determination will only occur
when the world demands political con
cessions on the part of the Arabs as well
as the Israelis.
