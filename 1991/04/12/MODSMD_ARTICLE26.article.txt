# Guilt-saddled Bug delivers 20 Hail Marys
## 
### John Ott Staff writer 
I have lied to you.
Gentle reader, I come before you in
profoundest humility, my cheeks
streaked with tears because I, the
Jimmy Swaggart of investigative jour
nalism, have sinned.
Intellectual gargantuan, mental
behemoth, academic gladiator: All
these titles I have falsely, though
proudly, borne, for the breadth of
knowledge I have hoasted is not my
own, but that of another, my guru, an
aged sage who dwells in a cave in the
Foothills. It is he, not I, who deserves
your sometimes fanatical admiration.
Thus, with the terrible burden of
deceit lifted from my unworthy shoul
ders, I can now readily admit my sta
tus as humble mouthpiece and recount
how my prophet solved this week's
quandaries, which I brought to his
hermitage in the hills.
I found my teacher, Grobo, medita
tively chanting his mantra in front an
episode of "Gilligan's Island" on the
television. Listening more closely, I
realized that the chants were in fact
grunts, interspersed with "Oooh,
baby" and "Yeeeah, Momma," that
picked up in intensity every time Mrs.
Howell appeared on screen.

At first I was puzzled about Grobo's
actions, mistakenly believing that he
had succumbed to the evil of sitcoms.
However, when he hastily explained
that this form of self-torture would in
fact purge all temptation from him, I
understood. I became skeptical, how
ever, when he began to employ the
same logic to justify the boxes and
boxes of Mr. T. cereal that were his
only sustenance. I presented him with
the first question:
Dear Bug,
How many cups of tea can you get
from one tea bag ? Are they reusable ?
— Troubled by Technology
Grobo and I focused our energies on
conducting a field test that would con
clusively resolve the matter. He
selected an herbal tea, "Bavarian
Chokeweed Fantasy," and the revela
tory results were as follows (comments
in quotes by my esteemed mentor):
Cup one: Color dark brown, strong
flavor vaguely reminiscent of "peat
moss maybe, or that weird chewy gunk
you find under bus seats."
Cup two: Color and flavor Grobo
quite brilliantly compared to "some
body doing number one." Of passable
quality.
Cup three: Weak and watery.

"Might as well spit or bleed in it, it'd
taste better."
Cup four: Almost indistinguishable
from water. At this point Grobo
decided to eat the tea bag.
Conclusion: Two cups works, but
with three, you're pushing your luck.
We had a little difficulty with the
second question, as the caffeine that
Grobo thought he drank seemed to
trigger an acid flashback that lasted
for two hours, during the course of
which my master swore that thou
sands of miniature Abe Lincolns in
beaver costumes were chewing on his
nipples. I pondered the significance of
this mystical vision while Grobo
writhed, screaming, on the ground.

Dear Bug,
Staring out my window at Hoover
Tower I get troubled, because the four
"prong" lights around the round part
are only on at dawn or dusk, but the
"receptacle tip " light is on all night. Is
this symbolic?
— Troubled Sternly RCC
Here, Grobo was not much help.
After I read him the question he kept
shouting "one if by land and two if by
sea" and, convinced I was his steed,
tried to put a saddle on me. Where he
obtained the saddle or what its pur
pose was I do not think I would like to
know.
Later, after my guru had knocked
himself unconscious by repeatedly
butting his head against the walls of
the cave, I spoke to Craig Snarr, head
of Facilities and Management in
Hoover Tower, who informed me that
the "prong" lights are controlled by a
clock periodically changed by the staff
whereas the "receptacle tip" lights are
regulated by photo sensors.
I owe it all to Grobo.

The Bug is not an actor, but he plays
one on TV. Queries to the Storke Pub
lications Building, please.
