I think we're all getting tired of
this.
So, hopefully this will be the
last clue.
In other words, wake up bone
heads.
Since this very well might be
the last clue, I'd like to take this
opportunity to pat myself on the
back. When I started this whole
thing everybody expected me to
phrase the clues in cute rhyming
couplets, most likely some sort of
iamb. Not once have I stooped to
the "It's really strange and really
big/But don't think dirty, you lit
tle pig" sophomoric line of clue
giving. And by doing so, I've prob
ably overestimated you.
All right, now this week's clue:
Within the graphic on the right
you will notice that there are
three things which do not belong
(nor are permitted) in Green
Library. Use the first letters of
each of the three words to spell
the word that will fit in the clue
below.
"Even Milli Vanilli wouldn't
name their --- this."
Use le text to figue out the
answer to this weeks clue. The
first to "figure it out and get it in"
will be awarded the $75 gift cer
tificate to the local restaurant,
Crawdad and Company.
I'll be waiting.
