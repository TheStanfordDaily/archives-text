The Stanford Daily
University President Ray Wilbur revealed his
fund-raising goal for Stanford to be $20 million. The
Daily could understand if the average reader thought
the sum was a typo; it was, however, "the Farm's
daydream."
$20 million ? I laugh at such a pitiful marshmal
low of a fund-raising goal. Ha! Why, in my day, we
used to illegally charge the government that much for
pink flamingos with the head of Donald Kennedy to
tastefully decorate the front lawn of Hoover House.
April 11, 1950
The Stanford Daily
Stanford students "are collectively little more
than thoughtless, crass adolescents with slight
chance of ever learning to understand when 'enough
is enough.' " The occasion for this tongue-lashing?
Not another expose on "20/20," but a Daily editorial
complaining about students "cluttering Memorial
Auditorium with paper, exploding firecrackers and
sounding horns," during Sunday Flicks.
The conduct of those so-called Stanford students
is just shocking. Anybody who's seen any part of the
"Star Wars" trilogy knows how much concentration
is needed to follow the intricate plot lines and mise
en-sc£ne.
