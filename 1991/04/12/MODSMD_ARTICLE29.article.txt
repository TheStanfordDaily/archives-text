# Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale, a tale that's all too hip

### 
IT WAS JUST MY LUCK. It was a
dream come true when my friends
invited me to go houseboating on the
Sacramento Delta this spring break. Ah, a
delta, I thought. Visions of the Meso
potamian Fertile Crescent came rushing
back from ninth-grade world history
class: evolving creatures of the Earth,
green individuals bathing in the water
and naked foliage up the yang. Count me
in.
Whoa there, I reasoned. I'm a smart
shopping, coupon-cutting, been-around
the-block-a-few-times consumer. I had
better check out the name of the corpora
tion we would be renting the fine sea-far
ing vessel from.
"Paradise Point Resort," my friend
said.
With visions of me on the Lido Deck
with Gopher by my side, I signed the reser
vation check and ran off to purchase a
bikini. OK, so never mind the fact that I
had to buy a small top and large bottom....
everyone looks fine, so fine, on a delta.
Yep, as if I didn't have the rug pulled
over my naive Alaskan eyes once again.
As we drove to our destination, I
noticed that there are no palm trees near
the Sacramento Delta. I had always envi
sioned beaches, palm trees — paradise
points, if you will — everywhere.
But instead of the Elysian fields, I was
standing in the third-base coach's box of
California. Sure, we had to read "Grapes

of Wrath" for high school, but I guess the
Cliff Notes just didn't do the book justice.
Finally, we arrived at Paradise Point.
Paradise Point was actually 20 floating
RVs in a man-made ditch. The only green
we saw was dripping from our noses as it
began to rain.
The nightmare began as Dave, the Par
adise Point Orientation Volunteer,
showed us everything we needed to know
about the boat in 30 seconds. Dave wasn't
even wearing a bright red shirt.
With that, we untied the ropes and
drifted off. It began to hail. Nothing
brings out the natural aesthetics of an
irrigation canal like dark skies and tor
rential ice.
Fifteen minutes later, we finally had
the engine started. We spent the first 14
minutes arguing over interpretations of
phrases like "turn the key" in the instruc
tion manual. For the record, I understood
that just because the manual didn't
explicitly state that the key has to be in
the ignition, it's assumed. I was just play
ing devil's advocate.
Finally, I got to drive. "What a hoser
the Skipper was," I thought as I searched
for the gas pedal.
I first realized we were stationary
when this parka-covered family out on a
leisurely walk passed us by. The boat's
emergency siren and flashing lights, and
the sound of a metal propeller grinding on
rocks and slowly cutting its way to the

center of the Karth were also good hints.
Everyone was pretty happy to spend
the entire night's low tide out on our own
little sand bar, in the middle of an irriga
tion duct, in the middle of nowhere. What
a fun game of "If You Could Do Bodily
Harm To Anyone In The World Right
Now . . it made for. No one would be my
Pictionary partner. No one even laughed
when I played "Blame it on the Rain."
Worse yet, no one questioned that I
owned a Milli Vanilli tape.
Twenty-four hours and a raging storm
later, a boat finally passed and radioed to
Paradise Point to send help.
Jim said that the real reason that our
engine would not start on the sand bar
was because Dave had given us a faulty
boat. He said he was not sure if we would

understand the technical terms, but all of
our batteries were dead. I bet Jim believes
Milli Vanilli is real.
Making our way up the river, I noticed
a wall of water heading toward us. I had
never been in a flood before! I was so
excited to be a part of history. Easter time
on a flooding delta could only foreshadow
the Second Coming! Yes, we were Noah's
ark. I couldn't wait to see the animals.
Then, before us, the water parted and,
just as our boat once again failed us, we
saw the haven of Wimpy's Oceanside Bar.
Quickly, I scaled the slightly sloping,
grassy hill. As I opened the creaky door
and tripped on the step as I walked in, the
entire bar became silent. I could see it in
the way they looked at me . . . they knew
I hadn't had a Pictionary partner for
weeks.
Feeling like a Pollyannic Gilligan, I
bubbled, "Would any of you happen to
know anything about boats? I think ours
is . .
"Listen here, honey," one of them
turned to say, "We don't know anything
about boats." Boy, someone sure wasn't
excited for the floods.
Then, the Stanford in me took over.
"Listen here buddy, no one calls me
honey."
This is true. No one calls me honey,
except for my dad when I was six years old
and happened to crack my skull open in a
sledding accident. You can be immortal

ized in Alaskan elementary schools for
accidents involving 15 stitches or more.
Meet Anne, the 20-stitch Alaskan hero.
Wow. what a resume I have.
I admit it, I didn't even have the guts
to say anything. I usually need a good 12
minutes to think of even the feeblest
comeback. I simply turned, fled and
found a phone to call our Paradise Point
friends.
Alright, in the end, Bob came to fix the
boat — only briefly criticizing Jim for his
error in forgetting to hook up the new
batteries.
Thirty-six hours later, Bob finally had
the boat running. Wow, that's even
shorter that it takes for me to change the
batteries in my Walkman.
Unfortunately, our four days on the
boat were up. With the wind blowing and
seawater splashing on our faces, we
headed back to our home dock, our spring
break over. We didn't even get to see the
Messiah.
The moral to this story? Bag on myste
rious, alluring places like deltas for spring
breaks. Stick with sure-fires like Tijuana,
and always, always listen to mom and
dress in lavers in case it starts to rain.
