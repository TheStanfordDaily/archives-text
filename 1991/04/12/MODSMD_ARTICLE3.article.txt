# Course sequence to be developed in Asian-American studies field
## 
### Marie Bui Staff writer 
Although no Asian-American studies
department exists at Stanford, profes
sors are trying to develop a sequence of
classes in this field to be taught from
several departments.
Along with law professor Bill Hing,
Profs. Gordon Chang and David
Palumbo-Liu are working to coordinate
a series of five courses in the field for
next year. At least one Asian-American
studies course will be offered each quar
ter, possibly including one interdisci
plinary introductory course.
With the courses, they hope to attract
more students and lay a foundation for
advanced study.
Chang's history seminar this quarter
is limited to about 20 students and is
geared toward those who have studied

Asian-American history on their own or
in other classes, according to the syl
labus. The course covers the late 19th
century to the present, including mate
rial about recent Southeast Asian
refugees and earlier East Asian immi
grants.
Earlier classes in the field of Asian-
American studies dealt almost exclu
sively with Japanese, Chinese and Fil
ipino-Americans.
"The community has changed, and so
the field is changing," said Rick Yuen,
director of the Asian-American Activi
ties Center. Despite the new develop
ments in the field, however, Asian-
American studies is considered to be
well-established.
"It's a legitimate academic, scholarly
field which has importance for all schol
ars regardless of their ethnicity," Chang
sniH

The field has moved beyond the
realm of Innovative Academic Courses,
claimed Yuen, who has taught a winter
quarter course called "Introduction to
Asian-American Issues" through the
Stanford Workshops on Political and
Social Issues program.
"The intent of a SWOPSI is to intro
duce new issues. This shouldn't be seen
as innovative," he said.
As part of the movement toward eth
nic studies, Asian-American studies
courses began appearing in colleges in
the late 19605. Despite calls from stu
dents beginning in the early 19705,
courses arrived at Stanford late com
pared to other Bay Area schools.
After a rigorous search directed by
Dean of Humanities and Sciences Ewart
Thomas last spring, twd Asian-Ameri-
can studies professors were hired
by existing departments.
Palumbo-Liu, an assistant profes
sor of comparative literature, has
been teaching since fall quarter;
Chang, a history professor, has
been commuting from Oakland to
Stanford since winter quarter.
"If we had started much ear
lier, we'd have had to fit the mold.
Now we can learn the positive and
negative aspects and start at a
more advanced level," Palumbo-
Liu said.
"Stanford, by starting later,
can look at the history and mis
takes of other schools," added
Yuen, who did graduate work in
Asian-American studies and soci
ology at UC-Berkeley. He pre
dicted students interested in pur
suing the field would probably
combine Asian-American studies
with a traditional major, as he did.
The lure of a traditional refer
ence for Asian-American studies
may explain why Chang and
Palumbo-Liu are professors in the
History and Comparative Litera
ture Departments, dividing their
teaching time evenly between
those disciplines and Asian-Amer
ican studies. On the other hand,
their positions may represent an
effort to diversify within the
departments, Yuen said.
"Last year, when the search
was in progress, there were prob
ably six to eight similar searches
in universities nationwide. Now
there are about 20. We were quite
lucky to get these two profes
sors," Yuen said.
