## Stanford sweeps Fresno State in tune-up for Cal 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Fans entering the Stanford
Tennis Stadium yesterday could
easily have felt they had entered a
time warp. Back into the month of
February.

Women's Tennis

The weather seemed just about
right for mid-winter: sunny skies
but cool temperatures and a nasty,
howling wind. The regular die
hards were in attendance, but the
stadium was largely empty. Again,
typical.
When Sandra Birch and Debbie
Graham stepped onto Court 1 for
their doubles match, they were in
radically different attire. Birch
had on a white shirt, and white
skirt; Graham wore a red top and
white shorts, of all things. It was
just the kind of wardrobe mixup
that occurs early in the season.
There was even a men's chal
lenge match taking place on the
back courts. Glenn Solomon and
Vimal Patel were locked in a fierce
battle to determine who would
hold the No. 6 spot in the lineup.
To complete the picture, the
opponent was Fresno State, a rel
atively proximate opponent, albeit
a lightly regarded one. As a result,
Stanford held out three of its top

singles players — Birch, Graham
and Kylie Johnson — and sent in
capable reserves Mario Carruth,
Emma Woodhouse and Carina
Rolley.
Unfortunately for the Bull
dogs, the Cardinal was in late-sea
son form — not suffering from the
February blahs. The result was a
dominant 9-0 rout as Stanford
moved to 19-1 on the season.
Fresno State fell to 6-18.
For the few spectators in atten
dance, the match was not without
its share of excitement. Rolley,
playing in her first singles match
of the year — and just her third
match overall — gutted out a
three-set thriller with Kori Hill 5-
7, 6-4, 7-5.
After Rolley dropped the first
set and quickly fell behind in the
second, she seemed to be done for
the day. She would confirm that
notion later. "The only time I felt
I might lose was when I was losing
3-0 in the second set," Rolley said.
"I was really down (emotionally)."
Somehow, though, she got her
self up just in time. Rolley began
to rally, and found herself serving
at 4-4. She held and then broke
Hill to even the match at one set
apiece.
Rolley then jumped ahead 3-2
in the third before she began to
skid again. Hill took three straight
games and Rolley was serving
down 3-5.
Fresno State appeared sure of
avoiding the shutout as Hill
reached match point. But Rolley
saved it. Another match point

arrived. Another save by Rolley.
Hill held a third match point.
Rolley approached the net on a
short ball and smacked a forehand
volley into the net cord. The
match was done . . .
But the ball crept over the net
and fell out of Hill's reach. A third
match point was saved. The tena
cious Bulldog would have one
more chance.
And she would squander that
one as well. Rolley eventually
ripped off a forehand winner into

Mario Carruth posted a straight-sets win at No. 4 singles to clinch yesterday's 9-0 win over Fresno State.
She later teamed with Kelly Fisher for an easy win at No. 3 doubles.
the corner to take the game. Hav
ing survived that test, she would
not be denied. Rolley did not lose a
game the rest of the way en route
to a 7-5 victory in set three.
"I don't mind playing from
behind. I play much better
[then]," she said. "I don't really
have the killer instinct to win, but
I do hate to lose."
Rolley explained that she was
not match tough because she had
practiced little of late and was not
enjoying tennis much. "I wanted
to win to hopefully motivate me to
start working harder," she said.
Said Stanford coach Frank
Brennan: "She must have an

NCAA record for being down
match points." He was alluding to
a doubles match Rolley and Wood
house played at Notre Dame on
Oct. 5. The pair was down 10
match points before coming back
to win the match.
"She was great," Brennan
added. "To me it's really impor
tant that everyone wins."
With tongue firmly planted in
cheek he added, "It keeps the mys
tique going. We're hoping this
story spreads all the way to
Gainesville, Fla.
"You never have to worry if
she's trying or not," Brennan
said, sounding a more serious
note.
As was the rest of the Cardinal.
Playing at No. 1 singles, senior
Teri Whitlinger opened the scor

ing for Stanford with a 6-0, 6-2
shellacking of Cecile Bourdais.
The match didn't last an hour.
Sophomore Heather Willens
was one spot behind Whitlinger in
the lineup and had an equally easy
time. Willens smashed Valerie
Stukovsky 6-3, 6-0. "It was tough
with the wind," Willens said.
"But, since I hit flat, my shots
aren't that affected by it."
Woodhouse posted the third
point with an easy 6-0, 6-1 thrash
ing of Camilla Sjostedt at No. 5.
And the rout parade continued at
third singles when freshman
Laxmi Poruri rebounded from a
loss Saturday to demolish Patricia
Marosova 6-1,6-1.
Carruth had a bit of a struggle
at fourth singles, looking some
what uncomfortable in her match
against Karen Farquhar. "I was

comfortable," she said later, "I
just wasn't playing well.
"I was letting the wind bother
me. It's especially hard to serve
because your toss flies every
where." But Carruth didn't have
too much trouble overall as she
was never in danger of losing the
match. Her 7-5, 6-3 triumph
ended up being the clincher for
Stanford.
Third doubles gave junior
walk-on Kelly Fisher her second
opporunity of the season to play
an intercollegiate match. She and
Carruth hammered Marosova and
Kim Kubar 6-1, 6-1.
Willens and Woodhouse played
their No. 2 match as though they
had early dinner dates. The result
was a lightning-quick, double
bagel, 6-0, 6-0 blowout of Far
quhar and Sjostedt.
