## Stanford sweeps Fresno State in tune-up for Cal 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Fans entering the Stanford
Tennis Stadium yesterday could
easily have felt they had entered a
time warp. Back into the month of
February.

Women's Tennis

The weather seemed just about
right for mid-winter: sunny skies
but cool temperatures and a nasty,
howling wind. The regular die
hards were in attendance, but the
stadium was largely empty. Again,
typical.
When Sandra Birch and Debbie
Graham stepped onto Court 1 for
their doubles match, they were in
radically different attire. Birch
had on a white shirt, and white
skirt; Graham wore a red top and
white shorts, of all things. It was
just the kind of wardrobe mixup
that occurs early in the season.
There was even a men's chal
lenge match taking place on the
back courts. Glenn Solomon and
Vimal Patel were locked in a fierce
battle to determine who would
hold the No. 6 spot in the lineup.
To complete the picture, the
opponent was Fresno State, a rel
atively proximate opponent, albeit
a lightly regarded one. As a result,
Stanford held out three of its top

singles players — Birch, Graham
and Kylie Johnson — and sent in
capable reserves Mario Carruth,
Emma Woodhouse and Carina
Rolley.
Unfortunately for the Bull
dogs, the Cardinal was in late-sea
son form — not suffering from the
February blahs. The result was a
dominant 9-0 rout as Stanford
moved to 19-1 on the season.
Fresno State fell to 6-18.
For the few spectators in atten
dance, the match was not without
its share of excitement. Rolley,
playing in her first singles match
of the year — and just her third
match overall — gutted out a
three-set thriller with Kori Hill 5-
7, 6-4, 7-5.
After Rolley dropped the first
set and quickly fell behind in the
second, she seemed to be done for
the day. She would confirm that
notion later. "The only time I felt
I might lose was when I was losing
3-0 in the second set," Rolley said.
"I was really down (emotionally)."
Somehow, though, she got her
self up just in time. Rolley began
to rally, and found herself serving
at 4-4. She held and then broke
Hill to even the match at one set
apiece.
Rolley then jumped ahead 3-2
in the third before she began to
skid again. Hill took three straight
games and Rolley was serving
down 3-5.
Fresno State appeared sure of
avoiding the shutout as Hill
reached match point. But Rolley
saved it. Another match point

arrived. Another save by Rolley.
Hill held a third match point.
Rolley approached the net on a
short ball and smacked a forehand
volley into the net cord. The
match was done . . .
But the ball crept over the net
and fell out of Hill's reach. A third
match point was saved. The tena
cious Bulldog would have one
more chance.
And she would squander that
one as well. Rolley eventually
ripped off a forehand winner into


David Gonzales — Daily
Mario Carruth posted a straight-sets win at No. 4 singles to clinch yesterday's 9-0 win over Fresno State.
She later teamed with Kelly Fisher for an easy win at No. 3 doubles.
