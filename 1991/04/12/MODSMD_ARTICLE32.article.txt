# Top-ranked Card journeys to the Valley of the Sun
## 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
Like always, Stanford will be looking
to the mound this weekend. After Tues
day's loss to the University of the
Pacific, a Cardinal player remarked that
when the team's pitching falters, the
hitting and defense follow suit, a combi
nation Stanford fans are in no rush to
see again. The old adage says that bad
pitching will not win ball games, and
when the Cardinal opens its three-game
series at Arizona State tonight, they
hope any bad pitching will come from
the other side.
"Their strength lies in their starting
pitching," said Stanford asst. coach
Dean Stotz. "If we can get through their
starters (Gary) Tatterson and (Sean)
Rees then we should have some success
this weekend."
Tatterson will open the series for the
Sun Devils, and it will be no mean feat
to get through him. Though he cur
rently sports a 6-6 record, he has
pitched much better than his record
indicates. The right-hander leads the
Six-Pac in complete games with six, and
is second both in ERA (3.05) and strike
outs (79).
"Tatterson is a great pitcher," said
Stanford pitching coach Tom Dunton.
"When he is good, he is as good as any
one in the league."
The Phoenix native will be followed
on Saturday by Rees (5-3, 6.23 ERA)
and on Sunday by lefty Scott Dodd (5-3,
4.60), but the threat pretty much stops
there. As Stotz noted, ASU's pitching

staff is only as strong as its starters. The
Sun Devils were ranked in the top 10
earlier in the season, but have lost 20
games this season, many due to poor
outings from relievers.
"Their bullpen is a little short," said
Dunton. "The depth (of pitching) is not
what they would like. They have a
pretty young staff; they have lost a lot of
guys."
Appearances can be deceiving
though. While ASU sports a mortal 25-
20 record, and is seven games out of the
Six-Pac lead at 7-11, they are not a team
to be taken lightly. Since Packard Sta
dium opened in 1988, the Sun Devils
have gone 127-24 at home, a winning
percentage of .841.
ASU also controls the overall series

with Stanford 54-41, and the Devils are
the only Six—Pac school that owns a
winning record (39-36) against the Car
dinal since the league was formed in
1979. Despite their record this is not a
team that Stanford is taking lightly.
"People assume that when teams
lose, they played badly," said Stotz.
"Their problem hasn't been offensive,
it's been with their pitching staff. Play
ing at home they will feel more comfort
able and will be throwing strikes.
"ASU is a difficult place to play. Their
fans are tough; they've been around a
long time, and they say bad things to us.
We haven't had the best success down
there."
Compounding the problem will be a
menace by the name of Jim Kelly. Last
year Kelly was the national Player of the
Year, and some say he could be the first
player taken overall in the June draft.
Luckily for the Cardinal, Kelly is strug
gling through his first slump since his
freshman year, but it is a small consola
tion.
To get an idea about what kind of
player the junior center fielder is, Kelly
is hitting only .212 over the last 13
games, but his season average is still
.355. That is what you get by hitting
.418 over your first 32 games. Combine
this with great speed and skills, and you
have one awesome package.
"He is the No.l guy in the country,"
Stotz said. "The question is not what
can he do, but what can't he do: he runs,
hits for power and has great defense.

Prior to this season, Chris Kemper had a total of one at-bat In a Stanford uniform. But
the senior quickly won the starting second base job and has performed well for the
Cardinal, both offensively and defensively, since then.
He'll get his hits; we just have to
control the guys around him."
That job will go to the Cardinal
pitching staff, led off tonight by
senior John Heid, and followed by
Brian Sackinsky and Willie
Adams. Sackinsky pitched a sea
son-high 4.3 innings against USC
last Saturday, and according to
Dunton is coming back well from
his shoulder injury.
"He told me (Monday) at Cal
that he could pitch, which is a
pood sign," said the coach.
If anybody gets in trouble over
the weekend, don't be surprised if
Scott Weiss comes trotting out.
Weiss was named the the Six-
Pac's Pitcher of the Week after his
performance last weekend
against USC, and has shown his
resiliency. Last Friday he worked
4.2 innings and gave up a run on
three hits with three strikeouts to
pick up the win. He then came
back two days later to pitch 1.2
innings for a save.
"Weiss is our swingman right
now," said Dunton. "He can go
two or three innings on Friday
and come back to pitch on Sun
day."
Along with Weiss, Jamie
Sepeda and Aaron Dorlarque
should see action this weekend.
Sepeda got struck for five runs in
last Tuesday's second-inning
debacle against the Tigers, but
has not lost the confidence of his
coach.
"Sepeda has pitched very well,
and has the experience we need,"
said Dunton. "He is one of our top
five guys."
One of five who cannot afford
to break down this weekend.
Unlike its opponent, the Cardinal
still has a chance to catch first
place USC. The team is only 2 1/2
games behind the Trojans in
Six —Pac play and a few wins in
Tempe would keep them in the
hunt. Of course, USC came into
Sunken Diamond last weekend
with the league's best pitching
staff, probably thinking they
could wrap things up.
The Trojans wound up leaving
with a broom between their legs,
wondering what had happened to
their guys on the mound. Stan
ford would like to avoid that situ
ation. They like their pitchers to
be the ones doing the sweeping.

Six —Pac play and a few wins in
Tempe would keep them in the
hunt. Of course, USC came into
Sunken Diamond last weekend
with the league's best pitching
staff, probably thinking they
could wrap things up.
The Trojans wound up leaving
with a broom between their legs,
wondering what had happened to
their guys on the mound. Stan
ford would like to avoid that situ
ation. They like their pitchers to
be the ones doing the sweeping.
Like always, Stanford will be looking
to the mound this weekend. After Tues
day's loss to the University of the
Pacific, a Cardinal player remarked that
when the team's pitching falters, the
hitting and defense follow suit, a combi
nation Stanford fans are in no rush to
see again. The old adage says that bad
pitching will not win ball games, and
when the Cardinal opens its three-game
series at Arizona State tonight, they
hope any bad pitching will come from
the other side.
"Their strength lies in their starting
pitching," said Stanford asst. coach
Dean Stotz. "If we can get through their
starters (Gary) Tatterson and (Sean)
Rees then we should have some success
this weekend."
Tatterson will open the series for the
Sun Devils, and it will be no mean feat
to get through him. Though he cur
rently sports a 6-6 record, he has
pitched much better than his record
indicates. The right-hander leads the
Six-Pac in complete games with six, and
is second both in ERA (3.05) and strike
outs (79).
"Tatterson is a great pitcher," said
Stanford pitching coach Tom Dunton.
"When he is good, he is as good as any
one in the league."
The Phoenix native will be followed
on Saturday by Rees (5-3, 6.23 ERA)
and on Sunday by lefty Scott Dodd (5-3,
4.60), but the threat pretty much stops
there. As Stotz noted, ASU's pitching

staff is only as strong as its starters. The
Sun Devils were ranked in the top 10
earlier in the season, but have lost 20
games this season, many due to poor
outings from relievers.
"Their bullpen is a little short," said
Dunton. "The depth (of pitching) is not
what they would like. They have a
pretty young staff; they have lost a lot of
guys."
Appearances can be deceiving
though. While ASU sports a mortal 25-
20 record, and is seven games out of the
Six-Pac lead at 7-11, they are not a team
to be taken lightly. Since Packard Sta
dium opened in 1988, the Sun Devils
have gone 127-24 at home, a winning
percentage of .841.
ASU also controls the overall series

with Stanford 54-41, and the Devils are
the only Six—Pac school that owns a
winning record (39-36) against the Car
dinal since the league was formed in
1979. Despite their record this is not a
team that Stanford is taking lightly.
"People assume that when teams
lose, they played badly," said Stotz.
"Their problem hasn't been offensive,
it's been with their pitching staff. Play
ing at home they will feel more comfort
able and will be throwing strikes.
"ASU is a difficult place to play. Their
fans are tough; they've been around a
long time, and they say bad things to us.
We haven't had the best success down
there."
Compounding the problem will be a
menace by the name of Jim Kelly. Last
year Kelly was the national Player of the
Year, and some say he could be the first
player taken overall in the June draft.
Luckily for the Cardinal, Kelly is strug
gling through his first slump since his
freshman year, but it is a small consola
tion.
To get an idea about what kind of
player the junior center fielder is, Kelly
is hitting only .212 over the last 13
games, but his season average is still
.355. That is what you get by hitting
.418 over your first 32 games. Combine
this with great speed and skills, and you
have one awesome package.
"He is the No.l guy in the country,"
Stotz said. "The question is not what
can he do, but what can't he do: he runs,
hits for power and has great defense.


Rajiv Chandrasekaran — Dally file
Prior to this season, Chris Kemper had a total of one at-bat In a Stanford uniform. But
the senior quickly won the starting second base job and has performed well for the
Cardinal, both offensively and defensively, since then.
He'll get his hits; we just have to
control the guys around him."
That job will go to the Cardinal
pitching staff, led off tonight by
senior John Heid, and followed by
Brian Sackinsky and Willie
Adams. Sackinsky pitched a sea
son-high 4.3 innings against USC
last Saturday, and according to
Dunton is coming back well from
his shoulder injury.
"He told me (Monday) at Cal
that he could pitch, which is a
pood sign," said the coach.
If anybody gets in trouble over
the weekend, don't be surprised if
Scott Weiss comes trotting out.
Weiss was named the the Six-
Pac's Pitcher of the Week after his
performance last weekend
against USC, and has shown his
resiliency. Last Friday he worked
4.2 innings and gave up a run on
three hits with three strikeouts to
pick up the win. He then came
back two days later to pitch 1.2
innings for a save.
"Weiss is our swingman right
now," said Dunton. "He can go
two or three innings on Friday
and come back to pitch on Sun
day."
Along with Weiss, Jamie
Sepeda and Aaron Dorlarque
should see action this weekend.
Sepeda got struck for five runs in
last Tuesday's second-inning
debacle against the Tigers, but
has not lost the confidence of his
coach.
"Sepeda has pitched very well,
and has the experience we need,"
said Dunton. "He is one of our top
five guys."
One of five who cannot afford
to break down this weekend.
Unlike its opponent, the Cardinal
still has a chance to catch first
place USC. The team is only 2 1/2
games behind the Trojans in
Six —Pac play and a few wins in
Tempe would keep them in the
hunt. Of course, USC came into
Sunken Diamond last weekend
