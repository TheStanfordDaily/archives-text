# Flanagan fighting up the ladder
## 
### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
Freshman tennis star Michael Flana
gan has never had it easy. Until two
years ago, he stood only 5-foot-4, not
very tall for a top-ranked junior tennis
player. His opponents are often quicker,
usually stronger, and even Flanagan
admits, "I'm not the most naturally tal
ented guy out there."
Despite these limits, Flanagan has
always found a way to win — always.
Coach Dick Gould says he knows why.
"The thing that sticks out in my mind
about Michael is his doggedness," Gould
said. "He's the type of guy that if he sees
something he wants, he's going to get it.
No matter what it takes, he's going to
get it. He's a fierce competitor."
Flanagan agreed, "I'm probably not
the most talented guy on the team, but I
feel I can compete with anybody. I'm
never going to lose a match because I
was outcompeted .... because I wasn't
willing to stay out there (and fight)."
"He's got a great backhand, a pretty
good serve . . . his volleys are getting
better, but his greatest assest is his abil
ity to adapt his game and to find a way
to win. He's always looking for a way to
beat you," Gould said.
Flanagan showed his adaptability in
a match against Andras Lanyi last
weekend at USC. Lanyi, who plays No. 5
for the Trojans and No. 1 for Hungary's
Davis Cup team, led Flanagan 6-1, 4-2
and had a game point to go up 5-2. But
Flanagan refused to call it quits.
"I started concentrating and playing
more aggressively," Flanagan said. "I
wanted to take the match to him. If he
was going to win it, I wanted to make
him earn it."
Twelve games later Flanagan walked

away a 1-6, 6-4, 6-2 winner.
Flanagan's brother, Chris, a junior at
Stanford, summed it up, "Michael just
never gives up, even when it's easy to
give up, even when other people would.
That (attitude) carries over not just on
the tennis court but in all areas of his
life."
"Michael is the type of guy you're
glad is on your team, and not on the
other side," Gould said. "If he continues
to improve, which I know he will, he's
going to be a tremendous college tennis
player, and he's going to go a long way
beyond that (in the tennis world)."
Flanagan, who resides in Dallas,
Texas, has athletic roots. His father was
an All-American golf player at Notre
Dame and his grandfather played foot
ball for the legendary Knute Rockne.
Flanagan attributes much of his mild
on-court demeanor to something his
grandfather once told him at a football
game.
"Notre Dame was playing Pitts
burgh. Notre Dame had just scored a
touchdown and some of the guys were
celebrating in the end zone, giving each
other high-fives," Flanagan said. "I
remember my grandpa looking at me
and saying, 'Rockne would never have
put up with that. (Rockne) would have
said you've got a job to do and you
should do it. Let your actions speak for
themselves."'
One of the ironic things about Flana
gan is that he often gets mad at himself
in practice but rarely in a match. "You
don't want to let the other guy get into
your kitchen (an Alex O'Brien expres
sion, according to Flanagan). If Lanyi
would have looked over at 6-2, 4-2 and
seen that I was upset, he would have
known that he had gotten to me. But
when he looked over and saw that I

wasn't, he had to wonder what he
needed to do (to get to me)," Flanagan
said.
Flanagan, who Gould calls a "devoted
team player," says that he is very much
looking forward to this weekend's
matches against Arizona State and Ari
zona. After losing the past three
matches, including a disappointing
defeat at California two days ago, Flana
gan believes that the team has some
thing to prove.
"We're looking at this weekend as the
start of a new season. We want to win
the rest of the matches from here on
out," Flanagan said. "I think everybody
(on the team) believes we can win the
national title, but so far we haven't
played up to our capabilities. This week
end we want to make a statement.
"A lot of people think that just
because Stanford has won three
national titles (in a row), we're not as

hungry. I've never won a national
title myself. I'm just as hungry as
any other guy in college tennis.
I'm very excited about NCAAs,
and I want to do everything I can
to help the team win."
Flanagan, a top student as well
as athlete, says his family has
played a big role in his success,
both at home and at Stanford. His
brother Chris charts his singles
matches at Stanford Tennis Sta
dium. "It's nice to look up in the
stands and see someone familar.
It helps me out, especially in this
new environment," Flanagan
said.

In terms of role models, Flana
gan says O'Brien, who also comes
from Texas, has given him some
inspiration. "Alex and I have sim
ilar sorts of games and similar
sorts of attitudes. To see him
doing so well in college tennis
gives me a lot of incentive,"
Flanagan said.
After college, Flanagan plans
to join the professional tour, for a
few years at least. In the mean
time, though, Flanagan is just
enjoying Stanford life and college
tennis.
Flanagan says his religion
helps him put things in perspec
tive. "I try not to get too upset out
there (on the court). I'm so lucky.
I just thank God for my ability
and for allowing me to be out
there."

get it. He's a fierce competitor."
Flanagan agreed, "I'm probably not
the most talented guy on the team, but I
feel I can compete with anybody. I'm
never going to lose a match because I
was outcompeted .... because I wasn't
willing to stay out there (and fight)."
"He's got a great backhand, a pretty
good serve . . . his volleys are getting
better, but his greatest assest is his abil
ity to adapt his game and to find a way
to win. He's always looking for a way to
beat you," Gould said.
Flanagan showed his adaptability in
a match against Andras Lanyi last
weekend at USC. Lanyi, who plays No. 5
for the Trojans and No. 1 for Hungary's
Davis Cup team, led Flanagan 6-1, 4-2
and had a game point to go up 5-2. But
Flanagan refused to call it quits.
"I started concentrating and playing
more aggressively," Flanagan said. "I
wanted to take the match to him. If he
was going to win it, I wanted to make
him earn it."
Twelve games later Flanagan walked

away a 1-6, 6-4, 6-2 winner.
Flanagan's brother, Chris, a junior at
Stanford, summed it up, "Michael just
never gives up, even when it's easy to
give up, even when other people would.
That (attitude) carries over not just on
the tennis court but in all areas of his
life."
"Michael is the type of guy you're
glad is on your team, and not on the
other side," Gould said. "If he continues
to improve, which I know he will, he's
going to be a tremendous college tennis
player, and he's going to go a long way
beyond that (in the tennis world)."
Flanagan, who resides in Dallas,
Texas, has athletic roots. His father was
an All-American golf player at Notre
Dame and his grandfather played foot
ball for the legendary Knute Rockne.
Flanagan attributes much of his mild
on-court demeanor to something his
grandfather once told him at a football
game.
"Notre Dame was playing Pitts
burgh. Notre Dame had just scored a
touchdown and some of the guys were
celebrating in the end zone, giving each
other high-fives," Flanagan said. "I
remember my grandpa looking at me
and saying, 'Rockne would never have
put up with that. (Rockne) would have
said you've got a job to do and you
should do it. Let your actions speak for
themselves."'
One of the ironic things about Flana
gan is that he often gets mad at himself
in practice but rarely in a match. "You
don't want to let the other guy get into
your kitchen (an Alex O'Brien expres
sion, according to Flanagan). If Lanyi
would have looked over at 6-2, 4-2 and
seen that I was upset, he would have
known that he had gotten to me. But
when he looked over and saw that I

wasn't, he had to wonder what he
needed to do (to get to me)," Flanagan
said.
Flanagan, who Gould calls a "devoted
team player," says that he is very much
looking forward to this weekend's
matches against Arizona State and Ari
zona. After losing the past three
matches, including a disappointing
defeat at California two days ago, Flana
gan believes that the team has some
thing to prove.
"We're looking at this weekend as the
start of a new season. We want to win
the rest of the matches from here on
out," Flanagan said. "I think everybody
(on the team) believes we can win the
national title, but so far we haven't
played up to our capabilities. This week
end we want to make a statement.
"A lot of people think that just
because Stanford has won three
national titles (in a row), we're not as

hungry. I've never won a national
title myself. I'm just as hungry as
any other guy in college tennis.
I'm very excited about NCAAs,
and I want to do everything I can
to help the team win."
Flanagan, a top student as well
as athlete, says his family has
played a big role in his success,
both at home and at Stanford. His
brother Chris charts his singles
matches at Stanford Tennis Sta
dium. "It's nice to look up in the
stands and see someone familar.
It helps me out, especially in this
new environment," Flanagan
said.

In terms of role models, Flana
gan says O'Brien, who also comes
from Texas, has given him some
inspiration. "Alex and I have sim
ilar sorts of games and similar
sorts of attitudes. To see him
doing so well in college tennis
gives me a lot of incentive,"
Flanagan said.
After college, Flanagan plans
to join the professional tour, for a
few years at least. In the mean
time, though, Flanagan is just
enjoying Stanford life and college
tennis.
Flanagan says his religion
helps him put things in perspec
tive. "I try not to get too upset out
there (on the court). I'm so lucky.
I just thank God for my ability
and for allowing me to be out
there."
Freshman tennis star Michael Flana
gan has never had it easy. Until two
years ago, he stood only 5-foot-4, not
very tall for a top-ranked junior tennis
player. His opponents are often quicker,
usually stronger, and even Flanagan
admits, "I'm not the most naturally tal
ented guy out there."
Despite these limits, Flanagan has
always found a way to win — always.
Coach Dick Gould says he knows why.
"The thing that sticks out in my mind
about Michael is his doggedness," Gould
said. "He's the type of guy that if he sees
something he wants, he's going to get it.
No matter what it takes, he's going to
get it. He's a fierce competitor."
Flanagan agreed, "I'm probably not
the most talented guy on the team, but I
feel I can compete with anybody. I'm
never going to lose a match because I
was outcompeted .... because I wasn't
willing to stay out there (and fight)."
