# Cramton is doing things his way — in a hurry
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Staff writer 
Some people run for office.
Others run away from home. Car
dinal sprinter James Cramton
runs to get away from the outside
world.
"My running is my own escape.
That's where I can punish myself.
I can be completely honest with
myself and no one else can really
touch me there," he said.
His intensity on the track is
what coach Brooks Johnson
believes makes him a great com
petitor. "He does his best when
the team needs it the most. When
the gun goes off he's ready to go to
war," Johnson said, "If I had to
fight the Viet Cong tomorrow he
and PattiSue (Plumer) would be
the first people I'd choose."
Cramton's aggressiveness is
especially valued in the sprints,
where hesitation means a lost
race. A natural quarter-miler,
Cramton has an explosive jump
out of the blocks which makes him
dangerous in the 100 and 200
meters as well.
His ability to shift into super
sonic gear is partly what earned
him the nickname Sting. He
passes competitors before they
know what is happening, said
asst. coach Betsy Riccardi. "He
stings them," she said.
The moniker, however, has an
altogether different origin.
"It came early freshman year.
My hair was really long and spiked
up and I was wearing a Billy Idol
shirt. Brooks looked at me and
saw the hair was the same (as
Idol's). So he said 'What's this
Sting shit?' That's just the way
Brooks' mind works. He associ
ates things as he sees them. The
fact that it says [Billy Idol] in
black and white in front of his face
doesn't do much good."
Cramton points out that people
also draw erroneous conclusions
based on his ferocity on the track.
"Typically they only see what is
on the outside," he said.
It's unlikely you'll see the real
Jim Cramton, which he admits to
keeping well-hidden. "I'm much
more comfortable at the track or
with a very select group of
friends," he said.
His busy schedule forces him to
sacrifice some of his social life.

This situation intensifies his
belief that "Much of (the social life
here) is not worth having.
"So many people here will just
turn on the beer commercials to
find out what's radical and then
go out and do it. They think that's
being creative," Cramton said.
He and some friends have been
known to explore steam tunnels
and climb on roofs of buildings
around campus. But he said the
point was not to let anyone know
they were there.
"The attitude here is look what
I'm doing, look what I'm a part
of," Cramton said, "Rather than
just doing something just because
you want to do it."
During freshman year he
wanted to wear skirts, "Just to see
what would happen." He was
amused at the uncomfortable
reactions he got from his peers.
"They didn't know what to say or
how to act. They couldn't play it
off like I was just standing there,"
he said.
Sophomore year Cramton
shaved his head. Again, class
mates judged him on appearances.
"People don't talk to a skinhead,"
he said.
"Maybe it's just a selective
screening system. If you really
want to look beyond the skirts and
the shaved head. ... If you want
to try hard enough to break down
my wall then maybe I understand
that you're worth knowing," he
said.
Cramton's individualist ap
proach to life also extends to aca
demics. He designed his own
major, paleobiology. It's a study of
ancient biology with an emphasis
on geology and other physical sci
ences.
Last summer he used an
Undergraduate Research Oppor
tunities grant to work with a
Stanford professor in South
Africa. They investigated sedi
ment deposits which resulted
from a meteorite that hit 3.4 bil
lion years ago.
The trip to South Africa
involved a lot of work but was an
"immense break" from running
according to Cramton. "I wasn't
satisfied with running, I wasn't
satisfied with much at all. When I
get like that I know there's some
thing bothering me but I don't
know what it is.

'My runi.ing is my
own escape. That's
where I can punish
myself. I can be com
pletely honest with
myself and no one
else can really touch
me there.'

"I get rid of as much as I can
that's familiar and start piecing
things back together. ... I real
ized this summer that running
was a lot of the problem. I hadn't
run well in five years," he said.
This year, however, Cramton
has been a lot more focused both
in the classroom and on the track.
Prioritizing his time has resulted
in lower times and higher spirits.
"Now that I'm getting satisfac
tion out of my running I'm a lot
happier," he said.
Cramton will be happy this
weekend if his races go well at the
Cardinal home meet against
Nevada and Cal State-Northridge.
He is running the 200, the 400
and the mile relay.
For him this is a training meet
to gear up for the Stanford Colle
giate Open. There he wants to get
a 400 time that will qualify him
for the NCAA Championships.
Both Cramton and Johnson seem
confident about his chances to
make NCAAs.
Cramton hopes this positive
trend will continue until 1992.
The senior from Glen Ellyn, 111.,
has his sights on the U.S. Olympic
Trials and the Olympic Games.
After that Cramton wants to
pursue a career in environmental
engineering or consulting. He's
not sure what will fill the compet
itive void after he finishes track.
"Maybe after running's done
I'll be able to put it in my job or
family," he said. One thing is for
sure, lack of track competition
won't lead to passivity
"I believe in being very intense
in life," Cramton said, "If you
don't put everything into life
what's the point of doing it?"

tion out of my running I'm a lot
happier," he said.
Cramton will be happy this
weekend if his races go well at the
Cardinal home meet against
Nevada and Cal State-Northridge.
He is running the 200, the 400
and the mile relay.
For him this is a training meet
to gear up for the Stanford Colle
giate Open. There he wants to get
a 400 time that will qualify him
for the NCAA Championships.
Both Cramton and Johnson seem
confident about his chances to
make NCAAs.
Cramton hopes this positive
trend will continue until 1992.
The senior from Glen Ellyn, 111.,
has his sights on the U.S. Olympic
Trials and the Olympic Games.
After that Cramton wants to
pursue a career in environmental
engineering or consulting. He's
not sure what will fill the compet
itive void after he finishes track.
"Maybe after running's done
I'll be able to put it in my job or
family," he said. One thing is for
sure, lack of track competition
won't lead to passivity
"I believe in being very intense
in life," Cramton said, "If you
don't put everything into life
what's the point of doing it?"

Sprinter Jim Cramton has never let a concern for what others might
think get In the way of what he wants to do. His ability to channel his
energy Into his goals has made him one of the Cardinal's top threats
at short distances.
Some people run for office.
Others run away from home. Car
dinal sprinter James Cramton
runs to get away from the outside
world.
"My running is my own escape.
That's where I can punish myself.
I can be completely honest with
myself and no one else can really
touch me there," he said.
His intensity on the track is
what coach Brooks Johnson
believes makes him a great com
petitor. "He does his best when
the team needs it the most. When
the gun goes off he's ready to go to
war," Johnson said, "If I had to
fight the Viet Cong tomorrow he
and PattiSue (Plumer) would be
the first people I'd choose."
Cramton's aggressiveness is
especially valued in the sprints,
where hesitation means a lost
race. A natural quarter-miler,
Cramton has an explosive jump
out of the blocks which makes him
dangerous in the 100 and 200
meters as well.
His ability to shift into super
sonic gear is partly what earned
him the nickname Sting. He
passes competitors before they
know what is happening, said
asst. coach Betsy Riccardi. "He
stings them," she said.
The moniker, however, has an
altogether different origin.
"It came early freshman year.
My hair was really long and spiked
up and I was wearing a Billy Idol
shirt. Brooks looked at me and
saw the hair was the same (as
Idol's). So he said 'What's this
Sting shit?' That's just the way
Brooks' mind works. He associ
ates things as he sees them. The
fact that it says [Billy Idol] in
black and white in front of his face
doesn't do much good."
Cramton points out that people
also draw erroneous conclusions
based on his ferocity on the track.
"Typically they only see what is
on the outside," he said.
It's unlikely you'll see the real
Jim Cramton, which he admits to
keeping well-hidden. "I'm much
more comfortable at the track or
with a very select group of
friends," he said.
His busy schedule forces him to
sacrifice some of his social life.

This situation intensifies his
belief that "Much of (the social life
here) is not worth having.
"So many people here will just
turn on the beer commercials to
find out what's radical and then
go out and do it. They think that's
being creative," Cramton said.
He and some friends have been
known to explore steam tunnels
and climb on roofs of buildings
around campus. But he said the
point was not to let anyone know
they were there.
"The attitude here is look what
I'm doing, look what I'm a part
of," Cramton said, "Rather than
just doing something just because
you want to do it."
During freshman year he
wanted to wear skirts, "Just to see
what would happen." He was
amused at the uncomfortable
reactions he got from his peers.
"They didn't know what to say or
how to act. They couldn't play it
off like I was just standing there,"
he said.
Sophomore year Cramton
shaved his head. Again, class
mates judged him on appearances.
"People don't talk to a skinhead,"
he said.
"Maybe it's just a selective
screening system. If you really
want to look beyond the skirts and
the shaved head. ... If you want
to try hard enough to break down
my wall then maybe I understand
that you're worth knowing," he
said.
Cramton's individualist ap
proach to life also extends to aca
demics. He designed his own
major, paleobiology. It's a study of
ancient biology with an emphasis
on geology and other physical sci
ences.
Last summer he used an
Undergraduate Research Oppor
tunities grant to work with a
Stanford professor in South
Africa. They investigated sedi
ment deposits which resulted
from a meteorite that hit 3.4 bil
lion years ago.
The trip to South Africa
involved a lot of work but was an
"immense break" from running
according to Cramton. "I wasn't
satisfied with running, I wasn't
satisfied with much at all. When I
get like that I know there's some
thing bothering me but I don't
know what it is.

'My runi.ing is my
own escape. That's
where I can punish
myself. I can be com
pletely honest with
myself and no one
else can really touch
me there.'
— Jim Cramton

"I get rid of as much as I can
that's familiar and start piecing
things back together. ... I real
ized this summer that running
was a lot of the problem. I hadn't
run well in five years," he said.
This year, however, Cramton
has been a lot more focused both
in the classroom and on the track.
Prioritizing his time has resulted
in lower times and higher spirits.
"Now that I'm getting satisfac
tion out of my running I'm a lot
happier," he said.
