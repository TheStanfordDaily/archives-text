# Spikers meet Gauchos

### Kevin Jeffery Staff writer 
The Cardinal men's volleyball team
puts its playoff chase on hold this week
end as it travels to Santa Barbara for the
Clash of Titans tournament, which
includes UC-Santa Barbara, Pepperdine
and top-ranked USC.
The match-up of four Western Inter
collegiate Volleyball Association rivals
begins tonight with first-round matches
pitting USC against seventh-ranked
Pepperdine and Stanford versus eighth
ranked UCSB. The consolation and
championship matches will be played
Saturday.
The Cardinal-Gauchos non-league
match-up will be an interesting one, as
the two teams are in the midst of three
way battle with Loyola Marymount for
the final two berths in the WIVA post
season tournament. The three teams are
tied in the win column with five each;
Stanford and Loyola have one match
remaining, UCSB has two.
Santa Barbara knocked off the Cardi
nal earlier in the season, in a game
which could have major implications for
end of the season tie-breakers. The Gau
chos' decisive 15-9, 15-6, 15-9 win in
mid-February was the third stage of
Stanford's dubious 10-match WIVA los
ing streak.
Stanford coach Ruben Nieves said his
team's desire to redeem themselves for
the earlier loss at UCSB will be a factor
in this weekend's match. Indeed, the
Cardinal turned in one of their poorest
efforts of the season in that match,
largely because they had dropped an
emotionally and physically exhausting
five-set match at Long Beach State the
previous night.
Another motivating factor for the
ninth-ranked Cardinal is the fact that a
win virtually assures them another shot
at the defending national champion Tro
jans, who they will face in their final
match of the regular season, April 20.
The Trojans have pounded Stanford
twice this season: 15-4, 15-3, 15-3 in the
championship game of the UCSB presea

son tournament; and 15-5,15-6, 15-10 in
a February WIVA match in Los Angeles.
USC, however, was brought back
down to earth last week when they were
knocked off by UCLA in the UCLA Clas
sic. The Bruins ruined the Trojans'
hopes for an undefeated season, but
USC's record still stands at 21-1 overall
and 14-0 in WIVA play.
Stanford (7-11, 5-10) enters the clash
fresh from its first WIVA victory since
early February, having knocked off UC-
Irvine in three straight games. Outside
hitters Dave Goss and Duncan Black
man led the Cardinal with 15 and 13
kills, respectively, in the Anteater match.
And, along with Bob Hillman, those two
have carried the brunt of the offensive
load all season.
Goss comes into this weekend with a
team-high 375 kills and a .305 hitting
percentage. Blackman and Hillman have
added 308 and 294 kills, and are hitting
.333 and .286, respectively.
Freshman Canyon Ceman has pro
vided spark and stability at the setter
position, and enters the weekend averag
ing 17.4 assists per game. A recent addi
tion to the starting lineup has been
freshman middle blocker Joe Burghardt.
His hitting percentage of .464 and block
ing average of 1.4 per game are currently
team-highs.
