Ruggers grab fourth
in Santa Barbara
As a final tune-up for this year's
Western Regional Playoffs, the Stan
ford ruggers traveled to UC-Santa
Barbara to compete in a 16-team tour
nament that showcased many of the
West Coast's best college teams. After
playing five games in two days, Stan
ford finished fourth behind California,
Santa Clara and Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo. These three teams will all be
coming to Stanford next Thursday for
the playoffs.
Junior wing Glenn Flores was sat
isfied with the team's performance.
"Some key players couldn't play
because of injuries and other commit
ments. Our second and third team
players came in and played well
enough so that we know that we can
play with the best."
On Saturday morning, Stanford
defeated UC-Santa Cruz 16-4. In the
second game, Stanford was tied with
UC-Santa Barbara when time expired.
During the drop-kickoff, where each
team chooses five players to attempt a
drop-kick through the posts, Brian
Jewett and Glenn Flores made their
kicks, but Stanford was still tied as
Santa Barbara also converted two
kicks. Finally in the sudden death
kick-off, Mike Craig nailed his drop
kick to win.
Senior hooker Glenn Jones said,
"The Santa Barbara game was proba
bly the best win of the tournament.
They didn't take us seriously because
we finished third in our league and
they're seeded ahead of us in the play
offs. Now when teams come up here
for the regionals, they know we're a
tough team."
Saturday night Stanford crushed
Pepperdine to win their bracket and
advance to the semifinals against
Santa Clara. Rob Joyce scored the
game's only try, but Santa Clara beat
Stanford for the second time this year
on four penalty kicks. Many players
were upset with the officiating during

the game but coach Franck Boivert
said, "Playing with bad officiating is
like playing in bad weather. Some
times you get bad breaks, but the good
teams don't lose their composure and
win games regardless of officiating."
Captain Simon Fleming-Wood
missed the match to play for the Peli
cans, the Northern California All-Star
Team, but cited the Santa Clara loss
as an important reminder that Stan
ford still has a lot of work to do before
the playoffs. "That loss really hurt,
especially since they beat us on a
penalty kick earlier in the season with
less than a minute to play. This loss
kind of gives us a renewed desire to
beat the piss out of them." Fleming-
Wood, along with prop John Hamilton
and wing Carter Stewart were named
to the Pelicans, which defeated the
Southern California Griffins Satur
day.
Stanford ruggers are looking for
ward to Thursday, April 17, when
Santa Clara, Cal and top teams from
Southern California, Arizona and
Washington will be at Stanford for
Pacific Coast Rugby Football Union
Playoffs.

Badminton doubles
its fun at UC-Davis
Last Saturday, the Stanford bad
minton club got a chance to rekindle
its past glory when it sent its strongest
men's doubles team to the Northern
California League Tournament at UC-
Davis. Two Stanford doubles teams
fulfilled everyone's brightest hopes,
winning the men's doubles and men's
doubles consolation titles.
Beating two California teams in
back-to-back upsets, Narinder Singh
and Dave Martin took everyone by
surprise.
"We really expected trouble from
Paul Roo and his partner," said Singh,
referring to a top-ranked player from
California. "Against them, we played

very fast, close games, but we man
aged to pull it out."
But although Roo was the terror of
the tournament, Singh and Martin
were in for an even more grueling
match with a less well-known team.
After losing the first game by a hair
splitting score of 18-15, Singh and
Martin got it together.
"We had to intersperse our smashes
with our cut drops and clears to keep
the opponents off guard. Because
their defense was very good, we
always had to mix our shots up," said
Martin.
The Stanford team shaved an 18-13
victory in the second game before
chopping off California's Ken Lamb
and Wilson Lai 15-6 in the third and
final game.
"They kept lifting the bird to us,
expecting us to run out of energy, but
we managed to smash through them,"
said Singh, who was still exultant
three days afterward.
Victory was especially sweet, since
the last time Stanford won the men's
doubles title was in 1985. That year,
Stanford also took the men's singles
title.
On the consolation side of the draw,
sophomore Gary Liou and his partner
Andy Chan crowned a year's worth of
hard work with an equally sweet 15-8,
15-10 victory over Vim Mahadevan
and Vik Prashar of UC-Davis.
In mixed doubles, Chen and Pol
Narongdej lost a tough semifinal 15-
10, 15-5 to a team from Davis.
Narongdej, Yang Li and Warren
Hayashi also played excellent singles
matches.
On the women's side, Stanford
freshman Lei Han and senior Jean
Chen made their way into the singles
semifinals before losing to Stephanie
Huynh and Sophia Loo, respectively.
Both of their opponents were from
UC-Davis.
The club is currently preparing for
its final league tournament, to be held
some time in late April.
