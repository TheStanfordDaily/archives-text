# Gould speech highlight of Stanford symposium
## Surprise Centennial greeting from Mikhail Gorbachev stuns crowd 
### Eden Quainton 
Moments before Harvard anthro
pologist Stephen Jay Gould delivered
his keynote address last night at the
Centennial Symposium, Stanford
received an unusual birthday greeting
from Soviet President Mikhail Gor
bachev.
With a photograph of Gorbachev
waving a red Stanford baseball cap
projected on the wall behind him,
Soviet Environment Minister Nikolai
Vorontsov stepped to the podium and
delivered Gorbachev's message, stun
ning a capacity crowd at Memorial
Auditorium.

Vorontsov read the message in Rus
sian, which congratulated Stanford on
celebrating its 100 th birthday and
called for the "ecological revival of the
planet" while protecting "each
nation's ethnic composition."
Gorbachev's speech was then read
in English by University President
Donald Kennedy, who noted that the
Centennial symposium, "Ethnicity,
Equity and the Environment," marked
a event in"the world's longest
birthday party"
Unfazed by Gorbachev's greeting,
Gould launched into a multimedia pre
sentation in which he quoted Alexan
der Pope, showed slides of the evolu

the architecture of the San Marco
Cathedral in Venice, castigated a pho
tographer for interrupting his perfor
mance and developed the theme that
no fundamental differences exist
between the members of the human
species.
Speaking against a backdrop of
palm leaves and ferns, Gould began his
address, "The Biological and Historical
Roots of Human Equality," with a slide
showing a statue of Alexander Agassi,
"the last great 19th-century creation
ist," thrown headfirst into the con
crete in front of Stanford's Jordan
Hall following the earthquake of 1906.

Gould's talk demonstrated that the
theories of Agassi, who believed that
different races evolved from separate
genetic origins and could therefore be
"ranked" in a hierarchy, were no more
than a reflection of the political and
social assumptions of his time.
New studies have established that
homo sapiens emerged in Africa no
more than 200,000 years ago, he said.
In such an "unmeasurable microsec
ond" it is impossible for evolution to
have produced any fundamental differ
entiation among humans, he argued.
Gould proceeded to attack what he
