With raised glasses of vodka and shouts of nas
trovia," organizers of the Stanford-Soviet Exchange
Project welcomed their visitors from the Soviet
Union late Wednesday night.
Although their journey was long and filled with
delays, the 15 representatives of Novosibirsk oiate
University were elated to be finally at Stanford.
"It is very, very good to be here," said Prof. Lyud
mila Nikoleavna, the Soviet students chaperon. It
is so warm here. We still have very deep snow in
Novosibirsk," she said.
This is the third time that students from the uni
versity, located in Siberia, have traveled to Stanford.
The Soviet students will stay at Stanford for two
weeks and will live with students in dormitories
across campus.
Their schedule includes a Stanford baseball game,
a day at the Great America amusement park, a trip
to Lake Tahoe, a tour of the state Capitol and as
much Stanford night life as they can stomach.
The Stanford organizers were relieved that the
Soviets made it to San Francisco. The project had
been plagued by poor communications between
Stanford and Novosibirsk and by ticketing problems
with Aeroflot, the Soviet airline.
"The day before they were supposed to arrive we
had no idea whether they were actually coming or
not," said project director Tracy Wright, a sopho
more. "Aeroflot wouldn't tell us if they were flying
into New York, Chicago or Mexico City. I have spent
hours trying to get through to Novosibirsk and
haven't been able to."
The Soviet students were tired from the airplane
flight, but their chaperon said the group was pleased
with the trip. "Everyone did so much for us. The air
lines in America are very nice. They delayed the air
plane in New York just for us," Nikoleavna said.
The Soviets will hold a formal press conference,
open to the public, Wednesday at 7 p.m. in History
Corner room 2. Project organizers said they want to
involve as much of the Stanford community as possi
ble in the exchange program.

"Our biggest problem is that people really don't
know what the exchange is all about. It is an
exchange for the whole school. We want to involve as
many people as possible," said Wright.
The 14 Stanford student organizers of the project,
plus one faculty chaperon, will complete the
exchange in September when they travel to Novosi
birsk to experience two weeks of Soviet student life.
They will be the fourth Stanford group to do so.
The Stanford-Soviet Exchange Project was

founded in 1987 by Dennis Matthies, a lecturer at
the Center for Teaching and Learning. It is one of 14
university-exchange programs initiated by the New
York-based Citizen Exchange Council and is the only
one that is entirely student-run.
The Stanford organizers raised the $15,000
needed to host the Soviets with almost no University
assistance. But this year, for the first time, the pro
ject has a special fee request on the ASSU ballot.
