# Asian-American studies classes designed to have broad appeal

### Marie Bui Staff writer 
The advent of Asian-American studies courses at
Stanford evokes mixed feelings about who should
take the courses and whether Asian-Americans
share a common experience.
"I reject the notion that only Asian-Americans
should take Asian-American studies," said David
Palumbo-Liu, assistant professor of comparative lit
erature. About 60 percent of the students taking his
current course on the Asian-American short story
are Asian-American, down from 75 percent last fall,
he estimates.
Sophomore Takami Nieda said she went to the
class because she was trying to find literature she
could relate to. "Going to the first class, I found it
had a lot to do with struggling to find your identity
in America. ... Asian-American literature is where
it is," she said.
History Prof. Gordon Chang explained students'
attraction to a field they identify with: "The best
education is intellectually stimulating as well as per
sonally meaningful," he said.
"But it's not like, being Asian-American, I have
this genetic sort of bond that makes me know what
it's like" to have been interned during World War 11,
said sophomore Ann Kim, who has enrolled in three
Asian-American studies courses this year.
Sarah Labouisse, a white graduate student in
American studies, joined the class because she is try
ing to study history through literature and to look at
literature in its proper historical context. "Besides,
it's relevant to just living here," she added.
The increasing presence of Asian-Americans at
Stanford — about 25 percent of the current and
prospective freshman classes — may encourage stu
dents from other'ethnic backgrounds to take Asian-
American studies classes, said Rick Yuen, director of
the Asian American Activities Center.

However, professors and students caution against
drawing a generalized impression about Asian-
Americans from the classes.
"It's a misconception that there's the Asian-
American experience. Not that there aren't com
monalities, but you can't pin it down," said Kim.
"That's the challenge because we think there are
common themes and experiences, but we also recog
nize there is a great diversity," said Chang, whose
history course examines experiences ranging from
Chinese-American farmers of the 19th century to
Vietnamese-American war refugees.
Palumbo-Liu said, "Part of the thing we're trying
to forestall is this idea of an Asian-American experi
ence, that there's one to fit into, and if you do not
you're not Asian-American. We want to show the
variety of experience."
In order to get at that variety, Palumbo-Liu exam
ines books not usually included in the Asian-Ameri
can canon, such as stories by Toshio Mori, a
Japanese-American gardener.
"Going to the Safeway, you see Amy Tan's ["The
Joy Luck Club"]. That's part of Asian-America, but
it reduces your range of self-representations to a
very narrow scope," he said.
But some reject the field altogether.
"I don't think it has anything to do with my expe
rience," said senior Ted Wong, who refuses to take
any Asian-American studies courses.
"I resent it when they impose a history and a cul
ture upon me because of my race. [The courses may
create] a fixed image you are going to project on
someone because he's Asian-looking," he said.
An Asian-American student in Palumbo-Liu's
class complained that one story painted a pitiful and
untrue picture of Asian-American girls as doll-like.
Yuen addressed such complaints by saying that
Asian-American studies should be made available to
everyone: "There may be some who are not inter
ested, and that's fine."
