The new Lucile Salter Packard Children's
Hospital at Stanford will open Sunday follow
ing a Saturday night extravaganza featuring
First Lady Barbara Bush.
The new hospital will consolidate pediatric
care responsibilities currently shared by the
existing Children's Hospital and Stanford Hos
pital. The 143-bed facility on Welch Road will
receive its first patients in June.
Event coordinators sold all 1,700 tickets
available for Saturday evening's gala benefit at
prices ranging from $150 to $1,000 a plate.
Bush, the guest of honor, will be joined by
Reps. Tom Campbell, R-Stanford, and Dan
Rostenkowski, D-111., State Superintendent of
Public Instruction Bill Honig, and Olympic fig
ure skater and Stanford graduate Debi
Thomas, among others. The gala's reception,

dinner, fashion show and dancing will be held
in a pavilion tent on the new hospital's
grounds.
The hospital inauguration Sunday coincides
with the annual "Children's Day Around the
Bay," a benefit sponsored by KRON-TV for
both the Children's Hospital and the Ronald
McDonald House.
David Packard, who provided the initial
donation for the hospital, and Gov. Pete Wil
son will attend Sunday's 1:30 p.m. official ded
ication ceremony. Other afternoon highlights
will include self-guided hospital tours, a chil
dren's health fair, food-tasting, games, live
entertainment and an appearance by fashion
designer Lauren Burch.
More than 12,000 guests are expected for
the activities, said Cheryl Oliver, assistant
director of community affairs for the hospital.
Proceeds from the weekend's events will
support the Children's Hospital program of

providing medical care to children regardless
of ability to pay for the services, according to
hospital literature.
Another event to celebrate the inauguration
is a symposium to take place today and tomor
row, titled, "Opening Door: Advances in Pedi
atric Medicine." Marian Wright Edelman,
president and founder of the advocacy group
Children's Defense Fund, will deliver the
keynote address at 8 p.m. tonight at the Facul
ty Club. Edelman was last June's commence
ment speaker.
Ground was broken on the $100 million
hospital in 1988. David and Lucile Packard
provided a founding contribution of $40 mil
lion for the hospital, and a Medical Center
fund-raising campaign garnered an additional
$20 million. Interest on these contributions
and Children's Hospital reserves provided the
balance of the funding.
