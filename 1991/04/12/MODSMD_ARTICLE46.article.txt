A Stanford resident was the
victim of indecent exposure and
other sexual advances Tuesday
night after she accepted a ride
from a van driver who tricked her
into thinking her car was broken.
The woman, who lives on cam
pus but is not a student, was driv

ing south on Interstate 280 near
the Magdalena exit in the Los
Altos Hills area shortly after 6
p.m. The male driver of an old yel
low moving van drove up beside
her and began to honk and wave
at her to pull over, said Stanford
Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
On the side of the freeway, the
van driver allegedly told the
woman her car had been emitting

blue smoke. Ostensibly trying to
repair the problem, the man fid
dled with the car, Niemeyer said.
The man, described by the
woman as a Pacific Islander about
35 years old, told her that her car
needed new brake parts, Niemey
er said. The woman then accepted
a ride in the van to a Palo Alto
Honda dealer where she bought
brake parts.

During the ride back to the car,
about 30 minutes later, the man
began to make sexual advances to
the woman and tried to convince
her to go home with him, Niemey
er said.
She refused, telling him to take
her straight back to Stanford cam
pus instead of to her stranded car.
The man then exposed himself
while in the van, Niemeyer said.
