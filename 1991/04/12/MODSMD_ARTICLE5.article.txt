# Opening COP debate acrimonious, humorous
## 
### Howard Libit Staff writer 
Let the great debates begin!
The four Council of Presidents slates participated
in the first of a series of debates before more than 70

students in the Madera lounge
last night.
The first debate featured the
start of an ASSU campaign's cus
tomary mudslinging and an early
exit for "Four Play," who walked
out during their introduction,
feigning embarrassment over
urinating in their shorts.

The attacks began quickly when Students First
COP candidate John Louie criticized the "hostile
takeover" of University President Donald Kennedy's
office in 1989, the 63 percent recall vote of this year's
COP; low use of the ASSU Airport Shuttle and recent
distribution of the COP pocket discount card offer
ing discounts already guaranteed by a student ID.
Mike Curry of the People's Platform's "Stand and
Deliver" slate responded to the harsh words by not
ing that the entertainment shuttle promised by Stu
dents First in last year's election has never material
ized. He also downplayed the significance of the
recall vote, saying few students voted in it.
Current COP member Goodwin Liu, during a
question-and-answer session, commented on the

present in the debate before
specifically asking Louie to iden
tify the most important parts of
the sexual assault task force
report that still need to be imple
mented. Louie has previously said
helping preventing sexual assault
would be one of his goals as a COP
member.
Louie said he supports having
a sexual assault officer, an ongo
ing shuttle service running later
than SURE Escort Service and
increased campus lighting.
ASSU financial manager Tor
rence Boone questioned the
"results, not rhetoric" theme of
the Students First campaign, say
ing Students First COP candidate
John Overdeck, who chaired the
senate finance committee this
year, did little to spend $12,000
allocated for student services.
Overdeck described the ASSU
finances as being "grossly mis
managed" and asked why the
ASSU continued to collect stu
dent money that was not being
spent. He also pointed to his bill
allocating money to the teaching
award created by two other sena
tors and promised to reduce the
$5,000 COP salary by 20 percent.
In one of the most bitter
moments of the evening, a sup
porter of the People's Platform
personally attacked Overdeck and
the three votes he received in last
year's senate election. Overdeck
replied by promising to receive
more votes this year and respond

was the only group to remain
above the fray, emphasizing its
commitment to campus kanga
roos, a resume-packing service
and a revolving Denny's on top of
Hoover Tower.
Slate member Amy Arends
even had her parents in atten
dance to vouch for her character
and say they were "very honored"
to support the Hammer and Cof
fin slate.
All three of the participating
slates did debate some of the sub
stantive issues, quarreling over
the role of the ASSU in discussing
national issues and the commit
ment of each party to various stu
dent groups.
After the debate, Curry
expressed concern over election
commissioner Raul Lopez's objec
tivity. Lopez said during the ques
tion period that he supported
Overdeck's efforts to decrease
student fees.
All three slates agreed that the
debate went "very well" and said
