The four Council of Presidents slates participated
in the first of a series of debates before more than 70

students in the Madera lounge
last night.
The first debate featured the
start of an ASSU campaign's cus
tomary mudslinging and an early
exit for "Four Play," who walked
out during their introduction,
feigning embarrassment over
urinating in their shorts.

COP candidate John Louie criticized the "hostile
takeover" of University President Donald Kennedy's
office in 1989, the 63 percent recall vote of this year's
COP; low use of the ASSU Airport Shuttle and recent
distribution of the COP pocket discount card offer

Mike Curry of the People's Platform's "Stand and
Deliver" slate responded to the harsh words by not

dents First in last year's election has never material
ized. He also downplayed the significance of the
recall vote, saying few students voted in it.
Current COP member Goodwin Liu, during a
question-and-answer session, commented on the

simulating an embarrassing scene involving a water balloon.
