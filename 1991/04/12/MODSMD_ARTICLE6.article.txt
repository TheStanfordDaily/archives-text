# SLAC workers demand firing
## 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
Thirteen union workers at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center, angry about a
supervisor who allegedly threw scalding coffee
on a union worker, walked into the personnel
director's office yesterday and demanded the
supervisor be fired.
The incident has spurred two internal
investigations. One determined that Facilities
Coordinator Bob Glenn's action was acciden
tal; the second, more in-depth study should be
completed today and will determine whether
disciplinary action is necessary.
"We want Bob Glenn terminated," United
Stanford Workers field representative Ruben
Serna told Lee Lyon, the personnel director.
Lyon told the workers, "We're trying to fig
ure out what really happened."
The incident occurred the morning of
March 29 in the craft shop. Santiago Limon, a
laborer in the plant maintenance services divi
sion, said he approached Glenn in the hallway
to greet him, said "Hello" and touched the
front of Glenn's shirt. Limon said that Glenn
replied, "Don't touch me."
Limon, beginning to repeat his hand ges
ture, asked, "Like this?" Then, Limon claimed,
Glenn threw the coffee on his chest.
He received first-degree burns and was
treated in SLAC's medical department. Limon
said Glenn never apologized for the incident.
Several phone calls to Glenn yesterday were
not returned.
The incident also prompted an investigation
by a San Mateo County deputy sheriff yester
day and a complaint to the Department of
Energy, which funds SLAC.
The first SLAC investigation was headed by
Bernie Lighthouse, a personnel manager.
Lighthouse met with Limon, Glenn, Glenn's
supervisor Burl Skaggs and Robert Lendin,
who witnessed the incident.
"It appeared Limon sincerely believed he'd
had coffee thrown on him," Lighthouse said,
but he added that he was convinced that it was
an accident. Lighthouse said that Glenn was
backing away as Limon pointed at him and
that he lost control of the cup.
But Lendin, an electrician spe
cialist, said he thought Glenn
intentionally spilled the coffee.
Lendin and Limon disagreed,
however, on the amount of time
that elapsed between the start of
the conversation and the spilling
of the coffee.
Lighthouse said Lendin, the
witness, had told him that Glenn
and Limon were joking. Lendin
told The Daily that the two were
just talking.

Lyon told the workers in his
office yesterday that they might
never know the results of the sec
ond investigation. "I'm not at lib
erty to tell anyone," he said. "This
is a personnel matter; we can't
talk about the results."
"We'll know if Bob Glenn
returns to work," USW steward
Lon Warneke replied.
The deputy sheriff investigat
ing the incident could not be
reached for comment, but
Warneke said Limon's case with
the police looks dim because
Limon waited more than a week
to call the police for fear of losing
his job.
