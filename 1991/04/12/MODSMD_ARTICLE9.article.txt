# Minority quotas in USSA questioned

### Howard Libit Staff writer 
Does the affirmative action pol
icy of the United States Student
Association amount to reverse dis
crimination?
Graduate senators Larry
Augustin and James Vera think
so, and they plan to introduce a
bill at next week's ASSU Senate
meeting requiring the ASSU to
sever all ties with the association,
a national lobby organization.
The ASSU is one of over 300
student government members of
the association. Five Stanford stu
dents traveled to the association's
legislative conference in late
March to testify before a congres
sional hearing on financial aid.
A special fee request for almost
$10,000 to open an ASSU lobby
office appears on the spring elec
tion ballot. Although the office
will not be dedicated solely to
association activities, $2,000 is
allocated for association member
ship fees and $3,450 will fund stu
dents traveling to association con
ferences, according to the budget
submitted for the office.
The association's affirmative
action policy specifies the number
of people in a delegation who must

be female, students of color and
members of other minority
groups. For example, a delegation
of five people such as the Stanford
delegation to the hearing must
contain at least one student of
color and one woman, and they
cannot be the same person.
"Affirmative action is a valid
goal, but this is not an affirmative
action policy. It is simply discrimi
nation," said Vera. "I do not
approve of quota-type actions."
But Jennifer Pearson, a mem
ber of the People's Platform COP
slate and sponsor of the special fee
request, defended the associa
tion's affirmative action policy.
"We are strongly in support of
the goal of building a multicul
tural environment. We need broad
and equal representation to
increase education access," Pear
son said. She added that the policy
was not a quota system and
expressed support for this specific
affirmative action policy.
"The spirit of affirmative
action is inclusive representa
tion," Pearson said. "We need
some mechanism to make people
understand that we are serious
about this goal."
But the two graduate senators
said this policy is not the way to

Member school delegations of three, four or five delegates must
include at least one student of color and one woman, who may not
be the same person. Delegations of six or more must also include
at least one delegate from any of the following constituencies: dis
abled, veteran, non-traditional, lesbian, gay or bisexual. All delega
tions of seven or more must meet the above guidelines and include
at least one woman of color. No individual delegate may be count
ed toward the satisfaction of more than one categorical require
ment.

achieve diversity.
"I do not believe that in order
to determine who will represent a
group of people you have to sam
ple their skin color," Vera said.
"They should be selected on the
basis of their political thought and
ideology. This is just as offensive
as any other organization that
selects its members on the basis of
their skin color."
Augustin and Vera, both doc
toral candidates in electrical engi
neering, also said they hope the
senate and the voters will both
reject the lobby office and the
ASSU's membership in the associ
ation after reading its affirmative

action policy.
"I hope that if the students do
approve the funding they are
aware of everything that they are
endorsing," Augustin said.
The senators also fear the affir
mative action policy is in violation
of ASSU bylaws and the Univer
sity Nondiscriminatory State
ment. But Senate Chair Solina
Kwan declined to comment on
whether it violates ASSU policy
and noted she has not heard any
complaints about the association's
policy.
