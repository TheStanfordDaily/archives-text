### Peter Robison Staff writer 
The new Lucile Salter
Packard Children's Hospital was
dedicated yesterday in a cere
mony featuring Gov. Pete Wilson
in front of a crowd of more than
20,000.
Wilson's short address was
the highlight of a day of activities
at the Lucile Packard Hospital,
which will accept its first
patients in June, three years and
$100 million after construction

began.
The new hospital's dedication
was part of Children's Day
Around the Bay, an annual fund
raising campaign that sponsors
activities for children through
out the Bay Area. All of the day's
profits fund the new Children's
Hospital and Ronald McDonald
House, which provides inexpen
sive lodging for families of the
hospital's patients.
The Children's Day Around
the Bay campaign was held at six
sites this year — the Lucile

Packard Hospital, the Redwood
Empire Ice Arena in Santa Rosa,
Ghirardelli Square in San Fran
cisco, the Oakland Coliseum,
Great America theme park in
Santa Clara and the Prune Yard
in Campbell.
Yesterday's ceremony capped
off a weekend of events featuring

Gov. Pete Wilson joined David Packard, who provided the initial donation for the new hospital, at an
Inaugural celebration yesterday.
Defense Fund, a child advocacy
group.
At the hospital's dedication,
Wilson gave credit for its develop
ment to Lucile Packard, who died
in 1987 — one year after she and
her husband, David Packard, con
tributed $40 million as the cor
nerstone gift of the project.
"This hospital is thanks to the
vision and determination of
Lucile Packard," Wilson said.
"She had a personal commitment
to children and to excellence."
"The best test of a civilization
is how it treats its young as well
as its old," Wilson said. "This hos
pital will provide thousands of
children for generations with the
best medical care they can possi
bly receive."
The turnout for the event
exceeded its planners' expecta
tions, said Dick Arnold, spokes
person for the hospital.
Lawrence Crowley, chair of the
hospital, said he was "tremen
dously pleased" by the turnout,
adding that "everyone seems very
enthusiastic."
The day's activities included
appearances by Ronald McDon
ald, Cookie Monster, Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtle Michaelan
gelo and several clowns and face
painters.
Their appearances were
planned to attract children and

families, Arnold said.
"It's a day celebrating chil
dren," he said. "We want families
to know that [the new hospital! is
here to help kids."
The Doobie Brothers band also
made an appearance at the open
ing. They were honored with a
"Doobie Brothers Courtyard" at
the new hospital because of their
continuing involvement with hos
pital patients and their major
financial donation to the hospital,
Arnold said.
Linda Meier, chair of the inau
gural events committee of the
new hospital, said she and her
committee had been preparing for
the hospital's opening for the last
year and a half, and they were
"thrilled" by how it finally turned
out.
"It's been an outpouring of
community support," Meier said,
adding that most of the 500 vol
unteers working for the commit
tee were Stanford students. "The
students have been so helpful,"
she said. "We couldn't have done
it without them."
The new hospital consolidates
the functions of the Department
of Pediatrics and the old Chil
dren's Hospital. It will also bring
the Children's Hospital physically

closer to Stanford Hospital,
where diagnostic and laboratory
services are performed.
Lorraine Zippiroli, the new
hospital's president, said the new
arrangement will increase the
amount of interaction between
the Children's Hospital and Stan

ford Hospital.
"We've had a lot of interac
tion," she said, "but this will
bring us even closer."
The new hospital, located next
to the Stanford Shopping Center
on Welch Road, is an independent,
non-profit institution.

Arnold said it will continue the
old Children's Hospital policy of
treating every child who needs
care, regardless of ability to pay.
"The Children's Hospital has
had the reputation of never hav
ing turned away a patient," he
said. "That will not change."

Gov. Pete Wilson joined David Packard, who provided the initial donation for the new hospital, at an
Inaugural celebration yesterday.
Defense Fund, a child advocacy
group.
At the hospital's dedication,
Wilson gave credit for its develop
ment to Lucile Packard, who died
in 1987 — one year after she and
her husband, David Packard, con
tributed $40 million as the cor
nerstone gift of the project.
"This hospital is thanks to the
vision and determination of
Lucile Packard," Wilson said.
"She had a personal commitment
to children and to excellence."
"The best test of a civilization
is how it treats its young as well
as its old," Wilson said. "This hos
pital will provide thousands of
children for generations with the
best medical care they can possi
bly receive."
The turnout for the event
exceeded its planners' expecta
tions, said Dick Arnold, spokes
person for the hospital.
Lawrence Crowley, chair of the
hospital, said he was "tremen
dously pleased" by the turnout,
adding that "everyone seems very
enthusiastic."
The day's activities included
appearances by Ronald McDon

"It's a day celebrating chil

to know that [the new hospital! is
here to help kids."
The Doobie Brothers band also
made an appearance at the open
ing. They were honored with a
"Doobie Brothers Courtyard" at
the new hospital because of their
continuing involvement with hos
pital patients and their major
financial donation to the hospital,
Arnold said.
Linda Meier, chair of the inau
gural events committee of the
new hospital, said she and her
committee had been preparing for
the hospital's opening for the last
year and a half, and they were
"thrilled" by how it finally turned
out.
"It's been an outpouring of
community support," Meier said,
adding that most of the 500 vol
unteers working for the commit
tee were Stanford students. "The
students have been so helpful,"
she said. "We couldn't have done
it without them."
The new hospital consolidates
the functions of the Department
of Pediatrics and the old Chil
dren's Hospital. It will also bring
the Children's Hospital physically

closer to Stanford Hospital,
where diagnostic and laboratory
services are performed.
Lorraine Zippiroli, the new
hospital's president, said the new
arrangement will increase the
amount of interaction between
the Children's Hospital and Stan

ford Hospital.
"We've had a lot of interac
tion," she said, "but this will
bring us even closer."
The new hospital, located next
to the Stanford Shopping Center
on Welch Road, is an independent,
non-profit institution.

Arnold said it will continue the
old Children's Hospital policy of
treating every child who needs
care, regardless of ability to pay.
"The Children's Hospital has
had the reputation of never hav
ing turned away a patient," he
said. "That will not change."
