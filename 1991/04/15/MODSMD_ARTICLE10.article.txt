# Conference explores ethnicity, environment

### Judy Hsu Eden Quainton Staff writers 
The final Centennial symposium con
cluded yesterday with a rare public dis
play of the scale of environmental
destruction in the Soviet Union.
The four-day conference, titled "Eth
nicity, Equity and the Environment"
focused on such issues as cultural sur
vival and environmental protection and
brought speakers to Stanford from
across five continents.
Soviet Environment Minister Niko
lai Vorontsov showed satellite pho
tographs detailing the extent of the
damage from the Chernobyl nuclear dis
aster, which sent radioactive "splashes"
into Byelorussia, rendering fallow 25
percent of the Republic's arable land for
"at least" 100 years.
Vorontsov also displayed maps show
ing the "enormous areas of pollution"
caused by metal smelting in the Urals
and illustrating the damage caused by
the use of pesticides in the cott on indus
try. Because of these practices, the Aral
sea has become a "total environmental
write-off."
He also condemned the "totally arbi
trary and irrational" national bound
aries established by Stalin and criticized
official census statistics which arbitrar
ily group together different ethnic
groups to form "synthetic nationali
ties."
On Saturday, Ailton Krenak, one of
the last surviving members of a Brazil
ian Indian tribe of forest gatherers
nearly decimated by the incursion of the

modern rubber and cattle industries
into the Amazonian rain forest, perhaps
best captured the spirit of the sympo
sium.
"This is your 100 th birthday," he
said, addressing an audience of over
300. "For a hundred years you have
developed knowledge, you have gath
ered the strength to build your destiny.
My people, too, have been doing this for
many years, but not in a closed space.
We have been doing it in the open,
through our traditions and our
dreams."
In his speech, delivered in Por
tuguese and translated simultaneously
into English through wireless headsets,
Krenak welcomed efforts to preserve
the rain forests but cautioned against
turning them into "a zoo or an aquar
ium."
Instead, he urged recognition of the
role Indians have played in bringing
about the ecological richness of the rain
forest.
"The forest exists as a result of the
permanent interaction of our people and
each of the places we have lived," he
said. "We must make sure that our peo
ple continue to develop along with the
forest."
William Durham, associate professor
of anthropology and human biology,
underscored the importance of Krenak's
theme by relating his own experiences
among the Kuna Indians.
The Kuna are a tribe of Native Amer
icans some 40,000 strong who live on an
archipelago off the coast of Panama.
Like the Krenak, rather than seeking to
subdue or dominate the environment,

the Kuna have adapted to their environ
ment, he said.
As a result, while most of Panama
has suffered devastating deforestation,
the archipelago has retained its rich
tropical ecosystem.
Rodolfo Stavenhagen, president of
the Mexican Academy of Human Rights,
agreed. "The destruction of the forest
and its transformation into pastures —
the famous hamburger connection —
actually means the destruction of peo
ples, of cultures, of societies."
Although environmental protection
can be a way of protecting indigenous
cultures, it can also contribute to their
destruction, said Moringe Parkipuny, a
former member of the Tanzanian Par
liament.
Set apart from the other speakers by
his blue worker's cap and his navy over
coat, Parkipuny illustrated what he
called "the stranglehold of preserva
tion" by describing the fate of the Maa
sai, a tribe of East African herdsmen.
The creation of national parks in
Tanzania on the model of America's Yel
lowstone National Park forced the Maa
sai to leave the Serengeti plains where
they had lived for centuries, he said.
While millions of wild animals from
Serengeti migrate during the wet season
into areas occupied by the Maasai, the
government denies the Maasai any graz
ing rights in Serengeti.
Meanwhile, population growth in
other areas of Tanzania has led to a
large influx of outsiders into the Maasai
homeland, Ngorongoro, leading to over
grazing of the land and threatening the
survival of the Maasai.
