When the fire alarm in Schiff House went off
at about 2:50 a.m. yesterday morning, sopho
more Vince Sanchez and his roommate Chris
Garrett rolled over and ignored it.
"I didn't get up until about five minutes
after the alarm went off," when Mike Ramsaur,
the resident fellow, knocked on all the doors,
Sanchez said. Schiff has had several false
alarms this year, he added.
But the smoke in the hallways and the fire
in the dorm kitchenette were real, apparently
caused by a bag of popcorn inadvertently left on
a burner, Fire Department officials said.
Stanford Fire Marshall Raymond Gamma
said the popcorn was probably left on the stove
about 1:15 a.m. He added that one of the burn
ers may have been on very low at the time, but
when the fire squad arrived just after 3 a.m., all
of the burners were off.
No one was injured from the fire or smoke.
Gamma said the fire did little damage to the
dormitory itself. The house's sprinkler system
"controlled" the fire before the squad even
arrived. However, smoke and water slightly
damaged the halls and the four rooms nearest
the kitchen, he said.
The burner and the microwave oven above it
were also damaged by the fire.
Gia Bosko, a Schiff resident assistant, called
the Fire Department after the residents had
evacuated the building.
"There was a lot of smoke in the halls,"
Bosko said.
