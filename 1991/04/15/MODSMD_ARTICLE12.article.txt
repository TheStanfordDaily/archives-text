Georgians elect president
TBILISI, U.S.S.R. (AP) — In a bold step to
assert its independence, the parliament of
Soviet Georgia created a powerful new presi
dency yesterday and elected its current leader
to the post.
Zviad Gamsakhurdia, an anti-Communist
leader and former political prisoner, was given
the power to institute martial law and presi
dential rule, to revoke or grant citizenship and
to declare war.
Yesterday's action followed Georgia's decla
ration of independence from the Soviet Union
on Tuesday. The republic, in modifying its con
stitution to create the powerful presidency, has
gone further than any of the other Soviet
republics in moving toward independence.
