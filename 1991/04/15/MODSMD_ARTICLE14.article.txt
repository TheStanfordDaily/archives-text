# Tanker explodes; experts fear ecological disaster

GENOA, Italy (AP) â€” Rocked by one last
explosion, a fire-ravaged tanker holding
millions of gallons of oil sank yesterday off
the Italian Riviera, and experts worked to
avert an ecological catastrophe in the
Mediterranean.
The Cypriot-registered tanker Haven
appeared to have remained intact on the
sandy sea bottom 1.5 miles off the shore
and it was believed most of the vessel's
crude remained inside, officials said.
The tanker held nearly 42 million gal
lons of Iranian crude when it first caught
fire Thursday. A Genoa port authority offi
cial, giving "an extremely rough" estimate,
said 15 million gallons of oil may have
burned. The official spoke on condition of
anonymity.
A few hours after the tanker sank some
oil came to the surface, but experts believed
it was released as the tanker settled on the
bottom, said an Environmental Ministry

marine ecology expert, Eugenio Fresi. It
was not immediately determined how much
oil leaked.
Patches of oil have washed ashore on
several stretches of beach along a 20-mile
swath of the resort coast west of Genoa, and
currents moved other slicks that one official
described as "leopard spots" on the sea.
The tar reached shore within 40 miles of
the French border yesterday, and could
reach the principality of Monaco by today,
according to Greenpeace, the international
environmental organization. Monaco is
about 90 miles southwest of Genoa.
Video pictures taken by underwater
robots showed the tanker settled flat
against the bottom.
At least six sailors were killed when the
Haven exploded Thursday. Twenty-nine
crew members were hospitalized with
burns and smoke inhalation, 11 of them in
critical condition.
