NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) —
President Saddam Hussein visited
northern Iraq and urged hun
dreds of thousands of Kurdish
refugees to return home, saying
his government had nothing
against them, Iraqi radio reported
yesterday.
As he visited Irbil on Saturday,
Western nations and relief agen
cies airdropped and trucked tons
of relief supplies to an estimated 2
million Iraqi Kurds huddled along
the Turkish and Iranian borders
or fleeing toward those nations.
The effort to save the Kurds is
being led by some 8,000 U.S. med
ical and transport troops. Turkey
has set up refugee camps along its
border with Iraq and the White
House has warned Saddam to
keep his troops from pursuing the
Kurds north of the 36th parallel.
Iranian yesterday
appealed for assistance for Iraqi
refugees there.
"Words cannot express the
depth of this disasfer. One must
go and see how tfhese refugees,
who barely survived the war, are
now grappling with another
struggle of life and death," it said.
But Saddam bade the refugees
to come home, saying their flight
and resulting misery was the
result of "propaganda," the Iraqi
News Agency reported.
"What is past is past and we are
starting again. We are used to
starting again," Saddam was
quoted as saying Saturday in the
city of Irbil, about 65 miles south
of Turkey.
"Your role is to tell those
remaining people who are still
influenced by the agents' propa
ganda .. . that the orders the
authorities have is very clear."
Those forced to leave their homes
will not be punished but the
"killers, the violators of the peo
ple's honor," will receive no guar
antees, he said.
Entire villages of Kurds began
leaving northern Iraq in late
February after Kurdish rebels
failed to defeat Saddam's forces in
an uprising. The flight turned into
an exodus when the Iraqi army
began killing Kurdish civilians
and Kurds feared Saddam was
seeking retribution.

Numerous reports have come
out of Iraq of Saddam's forces
shooting at and even using
napalm on civilians.
In another report, INA said
more than 40,000 Kurdish fami
lies have returned to their Iraqi
homes in response to the govern
ment amnesty program.
Baghdad radio said Saddam
met Saturday with officials in
Irbil to instruct them on facilitat
ing the return of the Kurds and
also went to Mosul where he said
afternoon prayers at a mosque.
An estimated 2 million Kurds
have crossed into Iran or Turkey,
and others are stranded in the
frigid mountains of northern Iraq,
stalled in refugee camps where
they face exposure, starvation and
disease.
Iraq, trying to win back the
confidence of the people, extended
the amnesty on Thursday for one
week for people still inside the
country and two weeks for those
outside.
The amnesty, offered to every
one who took part in the rebellion
except for those who committed
"acts of murder, rape or theft
which took place under the condi
tions of the incidents of rioting
and treachery," originally was to
expire last Friday.
In another development, Iran's
foreign minister said yesterday 22
Iraqi warplanes remained on its
territory from the Gulf war, dis
puting Iraqi claims that more
than six times that many aircraft
were in Iran.
During the war, more than 100
Iraqi planes were flown to neigh
boring Iran, U.S. officials said.
Some analysts believed they were
tlown across the border to escape
U.S. bombing, while others
believed the pilots had defected.
The official Islamic Republic
News Agency, monitored in
Nicosia, quoted Foreign Minister
Ali Akbar Velayati as saying 22
planes were in Iran. Iraq's official
news agency reported Saturday
the number of planes in Iran was
148.
Iran had pledged it would keep
the planes until the war had
ended.
