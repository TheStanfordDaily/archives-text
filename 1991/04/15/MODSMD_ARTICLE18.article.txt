THE COUNCIL OF Presidents
slate best aware of and most
able to address Stanford stu
dents' concerns in the coming year
is "Students First."
John Louie, Beth Morgan, John
Overdeck and Benny Sandoval
have set the tone throughout this
year's campaign by articulating
and addressing many of Stanford
students' most fundamental con
cerns.
"Students First" has made
accountability to students the cen
tral issue of this campaign, and
they are vigorous in their promise
to be responsive to the opinion of
students throughout the year. The
four candidates plan to communi
cate with students directly by pub
lishing descriptions of ASSU
debates, senate voting and COP
activity in The Daily. Most impor
tantly, they place a priority on
obtaining — and listening to — stu
dent input when considering stands
for on- and off-campus issues.
The slate has also raised — and
answered — the issue of graduate
students' concerns at Stanford.
The ASSU has tended to focus on
undergraduate issues and pro
grams, neglecting the input and
the concerns of the graduate stu
dents who make up half of Stan
ford's student body and finance
half the ASSU's budget. By placing
graduate student Overdeck on
; their COP slate, Students First has
' committed itself to supporting
! graduate as well as undergraduate
! concerns.
"Students First" has pledged
itself to improving the quality of

student services, most especially in
preventing sexual assault. This
emphasis on campus issues is a
change in ASSU politics which the
great majority of students wel
come.
Students will also welcome the
20 percent cut in the COP's exces
sive salaries which "Students
First" has volunteered to take.
The one major weakness of "Stu
dents First" is its failure to come
up with a meaningful position on
issues of multiculturalism and
equal educational opportunity. The
strident tone of campus multicul
turalism in recent years has alien
ated many students. "Students
First's" non-position on multicul
turalism is symptomatic of this
sentiment.
But multiculturalism will
remain a critical issue on this and
other campuses —an issue that
requires strong leadership and
meaningful debate.
Students First has the opportu
nity to be the party of a positive
and inclusive multiculturalism,
one that celebrates commonality as
well as difference and works
toward building a pluralistic com
munity, not just a collectivity of
campus groups. They seem to be
missing the boat by failing to
address multiculturalism at a level
deeper than their plan for a multi
cultural "Carnaval."
All things considered, the "Stu
dents First" candidates' respon
siveness to student concerns and
ability to unite the student body
around student issues makes them
an effective choice for leadership.
Louie, Morgan, Overdeck and
Sandoval are assertive, well-spoken
and unafraid to confront the
administration about the issues
students consider important. They
also impress us as an intelligent,
thoughtful and sensitive group of
individuals who will make excellent
leaders in the coming year.
