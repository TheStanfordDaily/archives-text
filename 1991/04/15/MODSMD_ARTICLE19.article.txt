### 
CA-1:
To define the scope
of ASSU activities.
O YES ® NO

CA-4:
To make the ASSU
accountable on
student issues.
®YES ONO

There is currently a clear prob
lem of accountability of the ASSU
government to the students whom
it is meant to represent. But the
proposed Overdeck Amendment
(CA-1) goes too far, forcing a nearly
complete ban on any statements by
the ASSU regarding "off-campus"
issues.

Although the ASSU should focus
on issues that directly affect stu
dents, there may indeed be times
when Stanford students feel
strongly enough about a state,
national or international issue to
make their voices heard. Silencing
their own government — rather
than forcing it to represent what
they truly think — cripples an
important mechanism for student
political action.
The Curry Amendment (CA-4)
would require some of the account
ability that is now missing in the
ASSU Senate. By requiring either a
referendum or a phone poll before
the senate can pass resolutions on
an off-campus issue, the amend
ment will ensure that the student
body is consulted and represented.
Finally, requiring open forums,
debates, dorm representatives and
consultation with other student
groups on such issues is a welcome
codification of some of the best exist
ing practices of the current senate.

CA-3:
To update portions
of the ASSU Constitu
tion in order to pro
vide consistency with
existing protocol.
®YES ONO

This amendment makes no sub
stantive changes to the constitu
tion, but it effectively encodes
many existing policies and proce
dures. It is a needed update and
clarification of the confusing and
antiquated phrasing in the current
constitution.
The amendment will also make
the language in the document gen
der-neutral.
