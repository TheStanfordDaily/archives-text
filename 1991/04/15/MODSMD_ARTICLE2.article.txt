### Mara Mather Staff writer 
First lady Barbara Bush was
a featured guest Saturday as
part of the inaugural celebra
tion of the Lucile Salter
Packard Children's Hospital.
Bush's visit was one high
light of the gala opening of "the
hospital'built for kids," which
involved a 10-day series of
events ranging from a medical
symposium to a community
open house.
The first lady began her visit
Saturday afternoon with a tour
of the facility She first visited
eight young patients in a
brightly lit occupational ther
apy room which was crowded
with toys. She sat on a child's
plastic chair and played cards
with the group. Bush held four
year-old patient Shannon
Brace on her lap, with a teddy
bear, a gift from nine-year-old
Joshua Evans, in the crook of
her arm.
One of the pat ients sitting at
the small round table with
Bush, nine-year-old Nathan
Karklins, asked her about
being the first lady.
Bush replied, "Do I like it?
No. It just makes me laugh,
because I know I'm not the
first lady." Brace, the small viva
cious girl perched on Bush's lap,
pointed at Bush's pearl choker
and asked, "Why do you wear that
nprklflCG^"
The first lady replied, "To hide
my wrinkles."
Accompanying Bush on the
tour were David Packard, who,;
with his late wife Lucile, was the
chief benefactor of the hospital;
Dr. Lawrence Crowley, the new
hospital board chair; Lorraine
Zippiroli, hospital president and
Langston Trigg, project manager
for hospital construction.
In the hospital's Doobie Broths
ers Courtyard, Bush accepted on
the hospital's behalf a necklace
made of pennies donated by two
classes of fifth-graders from
Menlo Park's Oak Knoll Elemen
tary School. The children, who
were lined up to greet the first
lady with bright yellow, blue and
red balloons, have collected over
$17,000 this year for the hospital.
When asked how she felt about
meeting the young patients, the
first lady replied, "I loved them.
They brought back a lot of happy
memories. I know that they are
our future. ... We will make a
stronger America."
In the evening, the first lady
was the guest of honor at a gala
benefit dinner for 1,700 donors.
During the banquet, held in a
giant tent on the hospital
grounds, diva and impresario
Beverly Sills Greenough was the
mistress of ceremonies. In line
with the inaugural program's
theme of "Sea of Dreams," the
tent was decorated in muted
shades of blue and green and
paper fish dangled from the tent's
ceiling.
A Nordstrom-staged fashion
show at the dinner featured San
Francisco 49er star quarterback
Joe Montana, several of his cur
rent and former teammates and
their children. The extravaganza
ranged in price from $150 to
$1,000 a plate. Dinner expenses
were underwritten by Nordstrom
so that proceeds from ticket sales
could be used to support the non
profit, non-sectarian hospital's
health care programs.
With 143 beds, the hospital
was designed with family-cen
tered care in mind.
