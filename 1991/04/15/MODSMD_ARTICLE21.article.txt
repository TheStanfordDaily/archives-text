## Critical thinking isn't PC 
### 
INSTEAD OF OFFERING students a
straightforward view of the "State of
the Association," as advertised Tues
day night, the Council of Presidents
served up a lecture/sermon on the differ
ence between political correctness and
what they called "critical thinking."
Much of the address defended the
COP's focus on national and interna
tional issues at the expense of more
immediate student issues here at Stan
ford, but the most interesting — and
most enlightening — part of the speech
was Goodwin Liu's lecture on "critical
thinking — what it is, how one does it and
what its consequences and complications
are at Stanford."
The speech was enlightening not
because of what Liu said, but because
Liu's comments exposed the true problem
with political correctness: Those who are
PC cannot understand what the problem
is.
The assumption throughout Liu's
speech is that the PC label demeans cer
tain beliefs because it claims some people
hold certain beliefs or opinions because
they are politically correct or trendy.
While that may be true in some cases,
that is not the most troubling problem
associated with PC.
The problem with political correctness
is twofold: Many who hold PC views shut
out all other viewpoints and claim moral
superiority over those who have not yet
reached the proper level of "sensitivity,"
and many who do not hold PC views can
not act on their opinions for fear they will
be ostracized and attached with an
unwanted label — all in a futile efTort to

change somebody's inflexible mind.
Liu's speech proposes a formula for
critical thinking based on the postulate
that "there is an inverse correlation
between depth of insight and comfort
level of discussion." Such a formula seem
ingly justifies the confrontational
activism employed by the People's Plat
form and student of color groups in the
past several years. Unfortunately, the for
mula is off the mark.
It may be necessary for committed
believers to confront those who disagree,
but the discomfort is only a byproduct,
not the necessary ingredient for critical
"insight." A better equation demands two
inputs to result in "depth of insight" —
exposure to a diversity of viewpoints and
an open mind.
The supposed inviolability of PC views
results in many Stanford students dis
missing the second component and
assuming that only tAeir viewpoint is
valid or well-reasoned, while the attacks
on non-PC believers help quash many
Stanford students' contributions to the
diversity of viewpoints.
In my years at Stanford, I have seen
the various and widespread effects of
political correctness: pro-life students
who avoid discussions about abortion
because their views are dismissed by their
peers, Daily editorial board members who
stop attending meetings because their
"conservative" views fall on continually
deaf ears, students of color who are given
labels or ostracized because their views
are "not ethnic enough," etc.
Liu suggests that those with non-PC
views who feel silenced should "continue

to express yourselves. Ask for answers
from people who have a viewpoint differ
ent from yours. Demand that your peers
listen and respond." Sound advice if
directed to everybody, but Liu suggests a
different route for those who support PC
views: take heart in your "well-grounded
ideals" and publicly defend them.
Liu seems to ignore that everyone
needs to hear different viewpoints, not
just those who aren't PC. His comments
lead me to wonder: How many times has
a People's Platform COP member
changed his or her mind on an issue
because of a discussion with another slate
member? Another student?
Sadly, many of the PC promoters are
not comfortable with the fact that some
people have legitimate disagreements
with their views, and that that does not
imply that they are racist, sexist, homo
phobic, unaware or insensitive. It means
only that they disagree, and the sooner
PC pundits realize the simple fact that
there are legitimate alternative opinions,
the sooner there can be constructive
intellectual dialogue on this campus.
It's time for the stifling monologue to
end.

Tim Marklein is a senior political science
major who has been forced to do plenty of
critical thinking at Stanford and is still
not politically correct.
