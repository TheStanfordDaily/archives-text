Boone misrepresents
the nature of ASSU
financial situation
As a graduate senator and a member
of the ASSU Budget and Finance Com
mittee for the past year, I have followed
the ASSU finances more closely than the
typical student. I have also had the
opportunity to observe the interaction
between ASSU Financial Manager Tor
rence Boone and Budget and Finance
Committee Chair John Overdeck.
Torrence Boone's personal attacks on
Overdeck in The Daily and at the Coun
cil of Presidents debates are entirely
unjustified. Overdeck's description of the
ASSU finances is accurate, and in fact
reflects information that Boone has pre
sented at past ASSU senate and Budget
and Finance Committee meetings.
I can only conclude that the attacks
are politically motivated. Let me state
that I am not a member of any political
party, nor have I ever attended organiz
ing meetings of any party. I was elected
as an independent, and I intend to
remain an independent.
For the record, here are the facts. As
reported by Boone at the April 11 Budget
and Finance Committee meeting, the
ASSU made a profit of $134,284 in 1990.
If the ASSU were truly a "non-profit"
organization, ASSU fees paid by stu
dents would have been decreased by
$134,284. Instead, the money has tradi
tionally been accumulated in "reserve"
funds, while the students continue to
pay large ASSU fees out of their pockets.
Here is a list of the of those reserve
funds, and of their balances as of Febru
ary 1991: business projects reserves,
$540,151; special discretionary reserve,
$316,193; operating reserve, $281,674;
project reserve, $106,283; income
smoothing reserve, $66,150. The
reserves total $1,310,451 (cents omit
ted).
Section V2.G of the ASSU Bylaws
establishes the special discretionary,

operating, project and income smoothing
reserves to guarantee the smooth and
continuous operation of the ASSU. How
ever, as Boone pointed out at the Feb. 14,
1991 meeting of the Budget and Finance
Committee, the procedures regarding
these funds in the bylaws have not been
strictly followed in recent years. The
result has been that some of these
reserves have implicitly become huge
endowment accounts, rolling over year
after year and accumulating handsome
profits.
As Boone states in his letter to The
Daily, the ASSU's "500 percent growth
rate in assets over a 7-year period is a
phenomenal performance." It is also
direct result of the ASSU's overcharging
students and having become a profit
making organization.
This asset growth is not designed to
benefit students, but rather to give the
ASSU a large source of revenue which is
beyond students' direct control. As
Boone stated, some of this money "is
then supposed to be used to offset exces
sive refunds requested by students from
organizations .. So even if a student
withholds his or her money from an
organization, the ASSU may decide to
give that money from the reserves to the
organization anyway.
At senate meetings over the past year,
Boone and members of the COP have
insisted that this money is "not the stu
dents' money." Then to whom does it
belong? Boone himself? The COP? Right
fully, every cent of that money should
belong to the students.
I am extremely disappointed that
Boone would use his supposedly non-par
tisan position as financial manager as a
platform for attacks on Overdeck.
Overdeck has worked as chairman of the
Senate Budget and Finance Committee
to return some measure of control of the
ASSU's finances to the students.
Overdeck understands the finances of
the ASSU, and he is not afraid to explain
them to students. Apparently that has
some people on this campus scared.
