Sensitivity should be
a goal of Greeks
during spring Rush
As Tim Marklein noted in his column,
it's spring and time again for Rush.
While the Greek system as a whole may
not deserve its bad reputation, Rush can
be problematic. We would like to urge
care and respect for others' feelings dur
ing the Rush process.
We have seen many young women and
men hurt in the past two years because
they got the impression that their
appearances or personalities weren't
"good enough" to be chosen by a particu
lar Greek organization. For example, last
year we saw a group of women in front of
their dormitory hugging and shouting
and congratulating each other on being
accepted into the same sorority, while
another woman, rejected by that sorori
ty, had to walk through them, crying, to
get into the dormitories.
There is admittedly no clean, safe way
of conducting a selection process that is
by nature exclusionary, but with some
sensitivity it may be possible to make it
less painful. If Rush, second only to the
housing draw in its divisiveness in the
residences, is indeed necessary, the Stan
ford community needs to work with it to
accent its capability for building, rather
than harming, friendships.
We also need to take the whole pro
cess less seriously. Be careful with one

another.

Words of advice from
an indignant but
enthusiastic chem TA
I write in response to Elizabeth Foil's
April 9 letter to The Daily concerning
the inadequacy of the undergraduate
chemistry program at Stanford. As a
chemistry graduate student, I have been
a teaching assistant in introductory
chemistry classes and have a different
opinion about the quality of chemistry
instruction in Stanford's classrooms and
labs.
My experience is so different from
Feil's that I feel compelled to present a
different point of view.
During my four quarters as a TA,
including one as a head TA, the TAs in
all of the classes I taught were required
to and did attend the class lectures. In
addition, most, if not all, of the TAs
spent considerable time reviewing the
course material prior to leading their dis
cussion sections. In the class for which I
was head TA, the TAs were required to
write quizzes for their sections which

had to be approved by the rest of the
TAs. In order to write a fair and chal
lenging quiz, the TAs had to know their
stuff.
During my tenure as a TA the profes
sors and TAs went out of their way to
make sure that office hours were conve
nient for the students. It would seem to
me that the example that Feil used: "one
of my TAs had his office hours during
the class meeting time ..is extremely
uncommon. There are times when TAs
do not show up for their office hours.
This is unacceptable, and if students
have a problem with this, they should
contact the professor in charge of the
course and ask him or her to speak with
that TA.
A major component of Feil's plan to
improve the chemistry program at Stan
ford involves rewarding better teaching
by both professors and TAs. Although
this seems like a reasonable way to elicit
better teaching, it has several draw
backs. Awards are already given for
teaching, and I know of no one who
works any harder in the hope of getting
one of these rewards. The professors and
TAs that I know try hard either because
they love to teach or because they like to
do a good job, not because they might
win a teaching award.
Feil qualified each of the proposed
awards by indicating that they should be
given for good teaching "as perceived by
students." It has been my experience
that the professors who have been
judged best by the students are the ones
who are more flashy in their lectures or

who serve ice cream midway through the
final exam. Is that what students should
get for their Stanford education, or
should they get a thorough, if occasion
ally "uninspired," education?
Feil proposes that the Chemistry
Resource Center (CRC) be staffed from 9
a.m. to 9 p.m. Most TAs would probably
admit that except for a few days right
before an exam, few if any students come
to their office hours. In some classes, the
TAs schedule extra office hours the week
before an exam, and many TAs would be
willing to schedule additional hours upon
student request. Expanding CRC hours
to 12 hours a day is unnecessary and
would cost thousands more dollars, even
at graduate student wages.
The final point that Feil makes is that
the laboratories are unsafe and the lab
classes too competitive. I am surprised
that she said that the labs were untidy
and that chemicals were improperly
labeled. This was not the case when I
was to TA for a lab class, Chemistry 132.
Feil asserts that students are required
to work with dangerous chemicals with
out knowing the proper techniques and
safety precautions. In my experience, all
of the necessary techniques and precau
tions are covered in the laboratory man
ual or are discussed by the TA before the
lab section begins. The professors and
TAs stress the importance of reading and
understanding all of the written proce
dures before coming to class.
In addition to improving lab safety,
doing the pre-lab homework also cuts
down on the stress level of the laborato

ries. It is true that the labs can be some
what stressful and frustrating. However,
this can be said of most graded classes
because they all have deadlines and are
competitive.
In order to get the most from their
chemistry program Stanford undergrad
uates should consider doing the follow
ing:
• Place your emphasis on learning,
not getting grades. TAs are more enthu
siastic about helping students who really
want to learn;
• Make sure you get what you pay for.
If a TA doesn't show up for office hours,
do something about it;
• Encourage your TAs to do a good
job. If you liked the way they explained
something, tell them. If you don't under
stand something, work with them to try
to understand it without getting impa
tient;
• In the laboratories, take responsibil
ity for yourself. If you don't know a pro
cedure or a precaution, find out before
you continue; and
• Be enthusiastic about and respect
your education, and your TA will, too. It
is hard for a TA to be "inspirational"
when he or she hears questions like, "Do
I need to know this for the exam?"
If you don't feel you are getting the
kind of education you deserve, give the
instructors prompt, detailed criticism.
