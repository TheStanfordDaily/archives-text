## Card nine thwarted in bid for Sun Devil sweep 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
In a weekend of big run
innings, Stanford managed to
come out only slightly ahead of
hosting Arizona State. After sin
gle frame blowouts in the first and
second games allowed for 18-10
and 6-5 Stanford victories respec
tively, the Cardinal was poised for
its first ever sweep of the Devils in
Packard Stadium. But ASU man
aged to give the Cardinal a taste of
its own medicine yesterday and
avoid the three game setback.
Scoring five runs in the bottom
of the seventh, the Devils broke
open a close 5-4 contest and
walked away with an easy 10-4

Cardinal takes two of
three from Sun Devils

Pacific 10 Southern Division vic
tory. ASU improved to 26-22, 8-13
in the Six-Pac, while the Cardinal
dropped to 26-11, 10-4 in league
play.
The win was ASU's 10th vic
tory over a top-10 team, keeping
the Devils postseason hopes alive
while hindering the Cardinal's
chances for repeating as confer
ence champions.
Stanford's loss, coupled with
USC's sweep of Arizona, allowed

the Trojans to pull even in the loss
column and gain half a game in
the league standings. USC is now
17-4 in Six-Pac play, three games
ahead of Stanford.
"Winning two (out of three) is
good, but SC swept, so we lost
some ground, which hurts us,"
said Stanford coach Mark Mar
quess.
Stanford's oppurtunity to keep
pace with the Trojans slipped
away in the bottom of the seventh
when releiver Aaron Dorlarque
was tagged for five runs in an
error-prone inning that was remi
niscent of Stanford's eigth-inning,
five-run rally a day earlier. Mike
Kelly began the damage by scoring
on an error by Cardinal second

baseman Chris Kemper to make
the game 6-4 in the Devils favor.
A Kurt Ehmann double scored
two more after Marquess had Dor
larque intentionally walk Bill
Dunn to load the bases in hopes of
a double play â€” and the slide was
in full swing.
Dorlarque recorded a wild pitch
to score Dunn and freshman
Andrew Lorraine came in as relief
only to have a fielder's choice
make it 10-4. ASU could have kept
rolling, but Todd Steverson's
bases-loaded fly ball mercifully
landed in the glove of left fielder
Ryan Turner at the wall to end the
inning.
"I have to give (ASU) credit,
they were able to hit a couple of

real good pitches," said Marquess.
"They swung the bat real well, we
just couldn't contain them."
Of course, it does not help
when you strand 16 runners.
"[The men left on base] was the
whole game," said Marquess.
"Three times we had the bases
loaded and we didn't score. If you

have those oppertunities, you
have to capitalize on them."
Capitalize is somthing the Car
dinal had no trouble doing in the
series' second game. The AS Li
outburst yesterday seemed ade
quate retribution for a similar
pounding the Cardinal had
inflicted on Saturday.
Down 5-1 in the top of the
eighth, Stanford used a Troy Tall
man bad-hop two run double to
climax a wild five-run rally and
secure the 6-5 victory. Before Tall
man's shot hit off the shoulder of
ASU third baseman Jim Austin
the Cardinal had already scored
three runs without the aid of a
