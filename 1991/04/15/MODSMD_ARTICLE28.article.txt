# Women ready for threepeat times two

Two years ago, the Stanford
women's tennis team played Califor
nia at home toward the end of the
season, scored a narrow 5-4 victory
and seemed to be in trouble. Then-
No. 1 singles player Tami Whitlinger
was struggling, Stanford's doubles
teams were in a funk and second
ranked Florida sensed an NCAA
upset.

Cardinal 7
Golden Bears 2

But the Cardinal righted itself in
plenty of time and rolled over the
field en route to its fourth straight
national title. Yesterday, the Cardinal
again took on the Golden Bears.
Looking for some deja vu? You'd bet
ter look elsewhere.
This time around Stanford
recorded a dominant 7-2 victory and
looked primed to make a run at an
unprecedented sixth national crown
in as many years. The Cardinal is
now 20-1 on the season, 8-0 in Pacific
10 Southern Division play. California
fell to 13-9, 2-6.
As is often the case, Stanford
started the scoring quickly. Fresh
man Laxmi Poruri decimated Tiffiny
Silveria by a score of 6-0, 6-2 in just
65 minutes.
Senior Teri Whitlinger, who usu
ally is first off for the Cardinal, fin
ished her 6-0, 6-3 dusting of Lisa
Parks just two minutes later. Stan
ford's three-time All-American is
now a remarkable 96-5 in collegiate
dual matches.
At No. 1 singles, senior Sandra
Birch was battling Cal veteran Lisa
Albano, the nation's sixth-ranked
player. Albano always seems to have
difficulty with Birch and yesterdav

went according to form.
The match opened with five con
secutive service breaks before Birch
finally held to move ahead 4-2. In one
sequence that typified the match,
Birch moved Albano left, then right,
then left, then right, then left.
She then drew Albano in with a
drop shot and followed that with an
unreturnable lob. All the while, Birch
stood at the center of the baseline
taking nary a step in any direction.
After grabbing the lead, Birch
broke Albano for a fourth time and

then held again to take the first set 6-
2. Albano was serving to open the sec
ond set and finally held for a 1-0
advantage.
But Birch took the next four
games before stumbling slightly.
Eventually she closed out the set at 6,-
3 with her seventh service break of
the match.
The match with the most intrigue
was second singles between junior
Debbie Graham and Emilie Viqueira.
When Stanford and Cal met in Berke
ley Feb. 16, Viqueira ended Graham's

remarkable streak of 55 consecutive
dual match victories.
And in the early going, it seemed
Viqueira had Graham's number once
again. The Cardinal superstar was
down 1-4 early and in trouble.
Quickly, she righted herself and
reeled off five straight games to take
the set. She drop just two games in
winning the second set 6-2.
Graham, who said she definitely
wanted revenge, attributed her early

Freshman Laxmi Poruri scored an easy 6-2, 6-0 victory over California's Tifflny Sllverla yesterday. Porurl's win led
a Stanford singles sweep as the Cardinal moved to 20-1 on the season.
troubles to anxiety. "For some rea
son, I wasn't as ready as I usually
am. I was kind of nervous."
She said that normally the
stress gets to her and causes her
struggles to snowball — but not
this time. "I think I handled [the
nerves] very well," she said.
"I decided that I had to start
getting some balls in. Teri yelled
at me (from the next court) to just
calm down."
When Graham found her
groove, she began to attack more
and more. "That's my game, try
ing to be aggressive as possible,"
Graham said. The result was occa
sional serve and volley and an all
out power attack.
Leading 2-1 in the second set,
Graham lunged for a forehand
while on the dead run. Viqueira,

thinking she had Graham dead to
rights, approached the net. Some
how, Graham rocketed a shot past
Viqueira for a winner. See you
later, Emilie.
Heather Willens scored the
decisive fifth point for Stanford by
overcoming illness and her oppo
sition. Despite needing two breaks
during the match, the Stanford
sophomore handled Lora Abe 6-1,
6-3.
Junior Kylie Johnson com
pleted the singles sweep with a 7-
6 (7-5), 6-4 defeat of Ellen Wal
liser. The victory notwithstand
ing, Johnson was less that 100
percent pleased with her perfor
mance. "I make tennis too hard,"
she said, adding that her strategy
was faulty at the start.
Johnson was down 1-4 in the
first set before she changed tac
tics. "She's a bunny rabbit out
there," Johnson said of Walliser.
"She's the fastest person I've ever

played.
"When you're playing someone
that fast they just run everything
down and frustrate /ou." But
Johnson didn't get so frustrated
that she couldn't right herself.
After coming back and winning
the first set tiebreaker, Johnson
trailed just once in the second set.
Birch and Graham played an
impressive doubles match at No.
1, blasting Albano and Silveria 6-
1, 6-3. That was good news for the
Cardinal since the nation's sec
ond-ranked tandem hadn't been
stellar of late.
Graham explained that they
had something of a motivational
problem against Fresno State
Thursday. That match went three
sets but shouldn't have. Yester
day, the Cardinal duo jumped
ahead 5-0 and cruised the rest of
the way.
Stanford fell at second and
third doubles. Viqueira and Parks

beat Whitlinger and Poruri 6-2, 6-
0 while Abe and Walliser edged
Willens and Emma Woodhouse 7-
5, 6-4. It was the first loss of the
season for the No. 2 team, which
is ranked seventh in the current
Volvo Tennis/Collegiate poll.
Coach Frank Brennan didn't
want to make too much of the
doubles defeats, however. He said
that if Stanford needed it, he was
certain Whitlinger and Poruri
would have won.
Brennan noted that both Wil
lens and Whitlinger — the respec
tive team leaders — were under
the weather and that played a
role.
Stanford also had the misfor
tune of running into a Cal team
that was working overtime on
doubles. Due to a lack of recent
success, the Bears were being
awakened at 6:30 a.m. to practice
their doubles. The hard work
obviously paid off.
