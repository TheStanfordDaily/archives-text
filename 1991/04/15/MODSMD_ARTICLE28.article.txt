# Women ready for threepeat times two

Two years ago, the Stanford
women's tennis team played Califor
nia at home toward the end of the
season, scored a narrow 5-4 victory
and seemed to be in trouble. Then-
No. 1 singles player Tami Whitlinger
was struggling, Stanford's doubles
teams were in a funk and second
ranked Florida sensed an NCAA
upset.

Cardinal 7
Golden Bears 2

But the Cardinal righted itself in
plenty of time and rolled over the
field en route to its fourth straight
national title. Yesterday, the Cardinal
again took on the Golden Bears.
Looking for some deja vu? You'd bet
ter look elsewhere.
This time around Stanford
recorded a dominant 7-2 victory and
looked primed to make a run at an
unprecedented sixth national crown
in as many years. The Cardinal is
now 20-1 on the season, 8-0 in Pacific
10 Southern Division play. California
fell to 13-9, 2-6.
As is often the case, Stanford
started the scoring quickly. Fresh
man Laxmi Poruri decimated Tiffiny
Silveria by a score of 6-0, 6-2 in just
65 minutes.
Senior Teri Whitlinger, who usu
ally is first off for the Cardinal, fin
ished her 6-0, 6-3 dusting of Lisa
Parks just two minutes later. Stan
ford's three-time All-American is
now a remarkable 96-5 in collegiate
dual matches.
At No. 1 singles, senior Sandra
Birch was battling Cal veteran Lisa
Albano, the nation's sixth-ranked
player. Albano always seems to have
difficulty with Birch and yesterdav

went according to form.
The match opened with five con
secutive service breaks before Birch
finally held to move ahead 4-2. In one
sequence that typified the match,
Birch moved Albano left, then right,
then left, then right, then left.
She then drew Albano in with a
drop shot and followed that with an
unreturnable lob. All the while, Birch
stood at the center of the baseline
taking nary a step in any direction.
After grabbing the lead, Birch
broke Albano for a fourth time and

then held again to take the first set 6-
2. Albano was serving to open the sec
ond set and finally held for a 1-0
advantage.
But Birch took the next four
games before stumbling slightly.
Eventually she closed out the set at 6,-
3 with her seventh service break of
the match.
The match with the most intrigue
was second singles between junior
Debbie Graham and Emilie Viqueira.
When Stanford and Cal met in Berke
ley Feb. 16, Viqueira ended Graham's

remarkable streak of 55 consecutive
dual match victories.
And in the early going, it seemed
Viqueira had Graham's number once
again. The Cardinal superstar was
down 1-4 early and in trouble.
Quickly, she righted herself and
reeled off five straight games to take
the set. She drop just two games in
winning the second set 6-2.
Graham, who said she definitely
wanted revenge, attributed her early


Tracy Allan â€” Daily
Freshman Laxmi Poruri scored an easy 6-2, 6-0 victory over California's Tifflny Sllverla yesterday. Porurl's win led
a Stanford singles sweep as the Cardinal moved to 20-1 on the season.
