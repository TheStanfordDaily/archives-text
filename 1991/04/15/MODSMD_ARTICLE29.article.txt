# Netters put end to losing skein
## Routs of ASU, Arizona both clinched in singles 
### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
Stanford made a statement this weekend. Riding
the crest of a three-match losing streak, including a
disappointing 5-4 loss at California, the Stanford
men's tennis team came back home and clobbered
Arizona State Friday and Arizona Saturday. Both
matches were clinched in singles play.

But there were no celebrations after the two wins.
Top-ranked UCLA and second-ranked USC will
enter Cardinal territory next weekend, and after suf
fering two losses in Los Angeles earlier in April, the
Stanford men have revenge on their minds.
"This weekend was a good start for us. The inten
sity was there, and we had some good competitive
attitudes on the court," co-captain Dan Turbow said.
"But we can't afford to have any letdowns from here
on in. We've got to keep building momentum for the
big tests next weekend."
"We played well in these two matches, but we still
have a long way to go," freshman Michael Flanagan
said. "Next weekend will give us a better indication
of how well we are playing."
Against Arizona State, ranked No. 10 in the Volvo
Tennis/Collegiate poll, Stanford dominated play
early as five of the Cardinal's six players won the
first set in convincing fashion.
Alex O'Brien, who has moved up to No. 4 in the
Volvo Rankings, was especially impressive at No. 1
singles, notching the Cardinal's first win of the
afternoon with a 6-2, 6-2 demolition of Bryan
Gyetko, ranked No. 39.
Vimal Patel, who recently has moved up to the
No. 4 singles spot, followed suit as he powered by
Joel Finnigan 6-1, 6-4.
Jared Palmer, ranked No. 17 in the Volvo poll,
started slow at No. 2 singles but
was impeccable in the second set,
recording a 7-6, 6-1 win over
David Lomicky, ranked No. 37.
After spending the first half of
the season on the sideline,
Jonathan Stark is trying to regain
his form at No. 3 singles. Stark
downed Danny Marting 6-3, 7-6,
but the quick hands and imposing
— often invincible — presence
were not there on Friday.
Stark led 4-1 in the second but
let Marting back in and was actu
ally down 5-4 with a set point
against him. A 100-plus mph sec
ond serve later (yes, second
serve), Stark brought the game
back to deuce. Stark saved
another set point and eventually
won the set with a 7-2 victory in
the tiebreaker.
"I lost my concentration at
that point (leading 4-1)," Stark
said. "I played a bad game, serving
at 4-1, and things just started to
slide. I was lucky to win that set.
"I'm not playing with my usual
confidence, and it's making me a
little tentative. My timing's a lit
tle off, and my hands are a little
slower (than usual). Hopefully the
.more matches I play, that'll all
come back."
Flanagan clinched the victory
at No. 6 singles with a gutty 6-2,
7-5 win over power-serving Ross
Matheson.

Stanford's only loss came after
the match had already been
clinched. At No. 5 singles, Jason
Yee came back from a first-set
defeat to win the second and lead
5-3 in the third. But Chris Gam
bino started playing more aggres
sively and ended up winning the
crucial points and the deciding set
7-5.
"I've been setting up the points
well, but I just haven't been mak
ing the big shots," Yee said. "I've
been playing too much defensive
tennis. It doesn't suit me."
Saturday's match against Ari
zona was much the same story
with Stanford clinching the match
in singles. O'Brien once again was
impressive, and despite a brief
second-set slip, the Cardinal
junior played impeccable tennis,
downing Doug Livingston, ranked
No. 12 by the Volvo Rankings, 6-3,
6-7, 6-1.
"Lately, I've been dictating the
pace more than my opponent.
That's been the big difference,"
O'Brien said. "In the second set,
[Livingston] started dictating
more, but in the third I started
taking control of the points."
Stark, Patel, Yee and Flanagan
all overpowered their opponents
en route to straight-set wins.
Ringo Navarossa recorded the
only win for the Wildcats in a
stunning 6-3, 6-0 triumph over
Palmer. "Jared started slow as he
has been doing all year," Stanford
coach Dick Gould said. "But
you've got to give [Navarossa]

credit. It was one of the best
matches I've seen played out
here."
Stanford swept the three dou
bles matches. At No. 1 doubles,
O'Brien and Yee, ranked No. 7 by
the Volvo Rankings, out-finessed,
outsmarted and outplayed Liv
ingston and Scott Sigerseth 7-5,
6-0. The match did have some
excitment, though, as Livingston,
perhaps angry over his singles
loss, pelted O'Brien in the leg with
a forehand smash.
Livingston, the sportsman that
he isn't, didn't apologize to
O'Brien and probably regretted it
when O'Brien nearly decapitated
him with an overhead smash early
in the second set. "You can't let
that stuff bother you. It probably
cost him more points because he
started missing a lot more balls,"
O'Brien said.
Palmer regained top form at
No. 2 doubles as he teamed with
Turbow to down Thad Langford
and Mike James 7-5, 6-1.
At No. 3 doubles, Patel and
Chris Cocotos squeaked out a 6-4,
4-6, 7-6 win over Navarossa and
Jeff Spier.
The two wins moved the Cardi
nal record to 14-4, 4-3 in the
Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division. Stanford's four wins in
the Pac-10 have all come against
the two Arizona schools.
The Cardinal now looks for
ward to Utah Tuesday afternoon
and USC and UCLA this week
end.

Jonathan Stark's comeback from injury is proceeding well. On the weekend, he recorded two singles

has been doing all year," Stanford
coach Dick Gould said. "But
you've got to give [Navarossa]

credit. It was one of the best
matches I've seen played out
here."
Stanford swept the three dou
bles matches. At No. 1 doubles,
O'Brien and Yee, ranked No. 7 by
the Volvo Rankings, out-finessed,
outsmarted and outplayed Liv
ingston and Scott Sigerseth 7-5,
6-0. The match did have some
excitment, though, as Livingston,
perhaps angry over his singles
loss, pelted O'Brien in the leg with
a forehand smash.
Livingston, the sportsman that
he isn't, didn't apologize to
O'Brien and probably regretted it
when O'Brien nearly decapitated
him with an overhead smash early
in the second set. "You can't let
that stuff bother you. It probably
cost him more points because he
started missing a lot more balls,"
O'Brien said.
Palmer regained top form at
No. 2 doubles as he teamed with
Turbow to down Thad Langford
and Mike James 7-5, 6-1.
At No. 3 doubles, Patel and
Chris Cocotos squeaked out a 6-4,
4-6, 7-6 win over Navarossa and
Jeff Spier.
The two wins moved the Cardi
nal record to 14-4, 4-3 in the
Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division. Stanford's four wins in
the Pac-10 have all come against
the two Arizona schools.
The Cardinal now looks for
ward to Utah Tuesday afternoon
and USC and UCLA this week
end.

Jonathan Stark's comeback from injury is proceeding well. On the weekend, he recorded two singles
wins as Stanford blew past Arizona State and Arizona. The Cardinal faces a major test next weekend
when USC and UCLA visit the Stanford Tennis Stadium.
Stanford made a statement this weekend. Riding
the crest of a three-match losing streak, including a
disappointing 5-4 loss at California, the Stanford
men's tennis team came back home and clobbered
Arizona State Friday and Arizona Saturday. Both
matches were clinched in singles play.

But there were no celebrations after the two wins.
Top-ranked UCLA and second-ranked USC will
enter Cardinal territory next weekend, and after suf
fering two losses in Los Angeles earlier in April, the
Stanford men have revenge on their minds.
"This weekend was a good start for us. The inten
sity was there, and we had some good competitive
attitudes on the court," co-captain Dan Turbow said.
"But we can't afford to have any letdowns from here
on in. We've got to keep building momentum for the
big tests next weekend."
"We played well in these two matches, but we still
have a long way to go," freshman Michael Flanagan
said. "Next weekend will give us a better indication
of how well we are playing."
Against Arizona State, ranked No. 10 in the Volvo
Tennis/Collegiate poll, Stanford dominated play
early as five of the Cardinal's six players won the
first set in convincing fashion.
Alex O'Brien, who has moved up to No. 4 in the
Volvo Rankings, was especially impressive at No. 1
singles, notching the Cardinal's first win of the
afternoon with a 6-2, 6-2 demolition of Bryan
Gyetko, ranked No. 39.
Vimal Patel, who recently has moved up to the
No. 4 singles spot, followed suit as he powered by
Joel Finnigan 6-1, 6-4.
Jared Palmer, ranked No. 17 in the Volvo poll,
started slow at No. 2 singles but
was impeccable in the second set,
recording a 7-6, 6-1 win over
David Lomicky, ranked No. 37.
After spending the first half of
the season on the sideline,
Jonathan Stark is trying to regain
his form at No. 3 singles. Stark
downed Danny Marting 6-3, 7-6,
but the quick hands and imposing
— often invincible — presence
were not there on Friday.
Stark led 4-1 in the second but
let Marting back in and was actu
ally down 5-4 with a set point
against him. A 100-plus mph sec
ond serve later (yes, second
serve), Stark brought the game
back to deuce. Stark saved
another set point and eventually
won the set with a 7-2 victory in
the tiebreaker.
"I lost my concentration at
that point (leading 4-1)," Stark
said. "I played a bad game, serving
at 4-1, and things just started to
slide. I was lucky to win that set.
"I'm not playing with my usual
confidence, and it's making me a
little tentative. My timing's a lit
tle off, and my hands are a little
slower (than usual). Hopefully the
.more matches I play, that'll all
come back."
Flanagan clinched the victory
at No. 6 singles with a gutty 6-2,
7-5 win over power-serving Ross
Matheson.

Stanford's only loss came after
the match had already been
clinched. At No. 5 singles, Jason
Yee came back from a first-set
defeat to win the second and lead
5-3 in the third. But Chris Gam
bino started playing more aggres
sively and ended up winning the
crucial points and the deciding set
7-5.
"I've been setting up the points
well, but I just haven't been mak
ing the big shots," Yee said. "I've
been playing too much defensive
tennis. It doesn't suit me."
Saturday's match against Ari
zona was much the same story
with Stanford clinching the match
in singles. O'Brien once again was
impressive, and despite a brief
second-set slip, the Cardinal
junior played impeccable tennis,
downing Doug Livingston, ranked
No. 12 by the Volvo Rankings, 6-3,
6-7, 6-1.
"Lately, I've been dictating the
pace more than my opponent.
That's been the big difference,"
O'Brien said. "In the second set,
[Livingston] started dictating
more, but in the third I started
taking control of the points."
Stark, Patel, Yee and Flanagan
all overpowered their opponents
en route to straight-set wins.
Ringo Navarossa recorded the
only win for the Wildcats in a
stunning 6-3, 6-0 triumph over
Palmer. "Jared started slow as he
has been doing all year," Stanford
coach Dick Gould said. "But
you've got to give [Navarossa]

credit. It was one of the best
matches I've seen played out
