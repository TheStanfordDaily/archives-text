Stanford made a statement this weekend. Riding
the crest of a three-match losing streak, including a
disappointing 5-4 loss at California, the Stanford
men's tennis team came back home and clobbered
Arizona State Friday and Arizona Saturday. Both
matches were clinched in singles play.

But there were no celebrations after the two wins.
Top-ranked UCLA and second-ranked USC will
enter Cardinal territory next weekend, and after suf
fering two losses in Los Angeles earlier in April, the
Stanford men have revenge on their minds.
"This weekend was a good start for us. The inten

attitudes on the court," co-captain Dan Turbow said.
"But we can't afford to have any letdowns from here
on in. We've got to keep building momentum for the
big tests next weekend."
"We played well in these two matches, but we still
have a long way to go," freshman Michael Flanagan
said. "Next weekend will give us a better indication
of how well we are playing."
Against Arizona State, ranked No. 10 in the Volvo
Tennis/Collegiate poll, Stanford dominated play
early as five of the Cardinal's six players won the
first set in convincing fashion.
Alex O'Brien, who has moved up to No. 4 in the
Volvo Rankings, was especially impressive at No. 1
singles, notching the Cardinal's first win of the
afternoon with a 6-2, 6-2 demolition of Bryan
Gyetko, ranked No. 39.
Vimal Patel, who recently has moved up to the
No. 4 singles spot, followed suit as he powered by
Joel Finnigan 6-1, 6-4.
