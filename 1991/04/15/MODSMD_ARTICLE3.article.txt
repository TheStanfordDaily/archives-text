# Electronic mail message may be bylaws violation
## 
### Howard Libit Staff writer 
Over the weekend, campaign
violations seemed to be the theme
of the Council of Presidents and
ASSU Senate races.

Hearings offi
cer Jason Moore
said the elec-
tions commis
sion will look
into possible vio-
lations by Peo
pie's Platform

candidates and their supporters of
several election bylaws that
revolve around campaigning
through electronic mail.
Students First also complained
about the defacing and removing
of some of their fliers. The elec
tion will be held Wednesday and
Thursday.
Senate candidate Nawwar Kas
rawi, currently a senate associate,
sent messages yesterday morning
to more than 2,000 students via
electronic mail, urging support for
the People's Platform COP
"Stand and Deliver" slate, senate
candidates and several special fee
requests.
Because other People's Plat
form candidates were endorsed by
the message, Moore plans to con
sider whether any of them could
be punished for it.
Kasrawi is not formally
endorsed by the People's Plat
form, but he is supported by the
party and uses the party's name
on his fliers.
Members of the People's Plat
form disavowed any previous
knowledge of Kasrawi's actions.
Kasrawi acted alone and "we
had no knowledge of it," said Peo
ple's Platform COP member Mike
Curry. "The COP slate had noth
ing to do with it."
Academic Information Resour
ces, which operates the campus
computer system, froze Kasrawi's
account soon after he sent the
messages, said senior Rick
Casares, a consultant to AIR.
"The account was shut down

because the computer resources
were so severely clogged while
[Kasrawi] sent the messages,"
Casares said. "Every now and
then we get a chain letter, which is
prohibited by AIR. But I have
never seen anything like this."
Moore and elections commis
sioner Raul Lopez said both AIR
and the elections commission will
investigate Kasrawi's actions.
"Based upon the evidence I
have seen, this is a serious prob
lem and I am really concerned
that certain candidates would per
petrate these actions," Moore
said.
Moore said he sees three poten

tial violations in Kasrawi's
actions:
• The exception allowing elec
tronic mail in the election bylaws
does not apply to a massive elec
tronic mail campaign;
• The amount of computer disk
space taken up in sending the
messages violates AIR policies and
impedes the functioning of the
University; and
• The fair-market value of a
mailing this size may exceed the
campaign spending limit. The
costs of trying to clean the mes
sage from the electronic mail sys
tem may also be subtracted from
the People's Platform candidates'
spending limits. Moore said he
expects the costs to be greater
than all of their limits combined.
Senate candidates are allowed to
spend $60; COP slates can spend
$200.
A formal investigation by the
hearings commission cannot
begin until after the election,
Moore said.
While the hearings commission
can recommend that a candidate
be disqualified, the final decision
rests with the senate. People's
Platform currently holds a voting
majority in the senate.
"I believe that the senate has
enough character to realize when
a disqualification is necessary and
it would make the necessary rul
ing," Moore said.
Members of other parties said
they were extremely upset by the
campaigning on the computer sys
tem.
"Using computers as a plat
form for mass propaganda is a
clear violation of the bylaws and
the University computer regula
tions," said John Overdeck, a
member of the Students First
COP slate.
Kasrawi justified his actions
based upon the bylaws and con
versations with Lopez.
The ASSU bylaws clearly state,
"This shall not be interpreted to
prohibit the sending of electronic
mail," Kasrawi said in a written
statement. "1 was very conscien
tious about following the bylaws
and I talked to Raul Lopez . ..
three times (twice last quarter
and once this quarter) to make
sure that the use of electronic
mail was all right, and he clearly
confirmed this with me.
"For him and Jason Moore,
who also happens to be a current
Students First senator, to sud
denly threaten me with punitive
measures, such as disqualification
from the election, possible dis
qualification of all People's Plat
form candidates, even extending
to actions that may be taken
against myself by the University
authorities, seems ludicrous to me
and makes me seriously question
their neutrality," Kasrawi added.
But Lopez disputed Kasrawi's
assertion that he approved a mas
sive electronic mail campaign.
"I have always made it clear
that AIR had the last word in
determining if something done on
the computer system is right or
wrong," Lopez said. "There were

no loopholes in our conversations.
. . . [Kasrawi] should have
checked with the proper parties
before sending this electronic
mail."
Lopez also said the electronic
mail provision in the bylaws is
only intended to allow personal
communications.
A 1984 elections ruling pro
hibits campaigning by electronic
mail, Lopez said. Kasrawi later
said he was never told of such a
ruling.
Electronic mail was used in last
year's campaign by engineering
graduate students who sent mail
to everyone in their graduate
school. But Lopez said that last
year's action was different from
Kasrawi's because it "was inside
the lab and was not a burden on
the computer network system."
In a separate incident, ethnic
and racial slurs were written on
several Students First senate can
didates' fliers in White Plaza and
more than 100 Students First
fliers and signs throughout cam
pus were missing or mutilated,
often replaced by fliers from the
People's Platform, said graduate
senate candidate Neil Crellin,
treasurer of Students First.
The word "token" was written
on the fliers of senate candidates
Jae Lim and Laurie Wong and
"WASP Boy" and "WASPS Only"
appeared on those of senate candi
dates Greg Gilchrist and Casey
Lynch. Senate candidate Sylvia
Ferroni said she received several
abusive phone calls late Friday
night about running in the elec
tion.
"It is clear that [Students
First! fliers are being taken down
and [People's Platforml fliers are
not," Crellin said. "I am not say
ing that People's Platform is
doing it, but it is probably being
done by some goons who support
them."
"We are really trying to stay
within the rules but we suspect
foul play. We are certainly not
accusing People's Platform of
doing this," said senate candidate
John Hall. "Racial slurs are not
something that either party would
support. . . . No one wants the
campaign turned into a racial
thing."
Members of People's Platform
denied all responsibility and said
they sympathize with the flier
problem.
"We are against this type of
negative campaigning and ask
anyone who is doing it to stop,"
said Curry.
People's Platform COP mem
ber Mae Lee said missing fliers are
a problem hurting both parties,
but "we're not blaming Students
First."
Party members also said they
were upset by Students First's
accusations.
"It is unfair for someone to
make an unfounded accusation
that diverts attention from the
real issue — that neither party
supports writing racial epithets
on fliers," said COP member
Goodwin Liu.
Moore said there is little that
can be done to prevent these types
of actions.
