# Home sweet home: Track runs past Nevada, Northridge
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Staff writer 
A month and a half ago the
Stanford men's track team barely
beat Cal State-Northridge in
Southern California. Saturday,
Northridge and Nevada came to
the Cardinal's home track and the
results were radically different.
The men defeated Nevada 78-
44, and Northridge 84-44. The
women followed suit with a 109-
29 massacre of Nevada and 93-44
shellacking of Northridge.
Asst. Coach Scott Chisam
attributes the blowouts to the dif
ference between competing away
and at home.
"We feel we have the home
advantage. Its called the airplane
advantage. They are not going to
be able to fly as many people in as
we're going to have, just like we
didn't fly as many people there,"
Chisam said.
This is the time of the season
when qualifying for the NCAA
Championships is foremost in
athletes' minds. Although none
made the automatic marks, one
came very close.
Debbie Malueg won the discus
with a lifetime best toss of 168
feet, 9 inches. She is just 2 1/2 feet
off the NCAA qualifying distance.
She added to the team scoring
with a victory in the shot put.
Also helping the team in the
field was senior Alysia Hubbard.
She won the long jump with a lead
of 19-9.
"Its nice to jump well over 19
(feet) instead of just 19-1. I'm just
about back where I was this time
last year," Hubbard said.
Her goals for the next few
weeks are to break 20 feet and fin
ish 1-2 with teammate Jackie
Edwards at Big Meet.
"From now on out every meet
is qualify, qualify. Each meet is
very important. Even though

there's not a lot of people here,
that pushes you more than any
thing else," Hubbard said.
Several other athletes were
pushing themselves, too. Melanie
Bloch ran the second fastest
1,500-meter time in the Pacific 10
Conference this year while run
ning well in front most of the race.
Her only competitor, teammate
Ashley Black, stuck close for a lap
or two but then the defending
Pac-10 champion pulled away.
James Cramton performed well
in what was basically a training
meet to gear up for the next few
weeks. He won both the 200
meters and 400 meters.
According to Chisam the ability
to run fast against light competi
tion is necessary to be able to
"kick butt" when faced with top
conference and national runners.
Former Stanford star PattiSue
Plumer ran quite well in a very
unusual triple. She finished third
to sophomore sprinter Rhonda
Oliver in the 400.
She then won the 800 by pass
ing Northridge's Darcy Arreola in
the last 125 meters. Not done yet,
she handily won the 5,000.
Plumer is the American record
holder in the 3,000 and is also con
sidered or.o of the nation's top
milers.
Finishing third to Plumer, but
first in the collegiate scoring, was
Jodie Bilotta. She also finished
first in the scoring in the 3,000 —
second overall to another former
Cardinal star, Ceci St. Geme.
The junior middle distance
runner has been injured most of
the past two years but hopes to be
at top form for Big Meet where
she may drop down to the 800.
Other highlights of the
women's competition was the 1-2
finish in the javelin by Peggy
Odita and Debbie Templeton.
Kathy Unruh won the high jump

and Dana Weeks, Oliver, Odita
and Susan Helfter won the mile
relay.
Jumper Jackie Edwards and
sprinter Chryste Gaines did not
compete this weekend due to

minor injuries. Edwards has a
lower back twinge and Gaines has
a slight hamstring pull. They both
should be ready for Big Meet in
two weeks.
On the men's side Marcus

Hickerson won the long jump.
Mark Mastalir and Dave Strang
went 1-2 in the 1,500 meters.
Strang, Hickerson, Cramton and
Alex Acetta won the mile relay.
The discus was won by

Northridge's Kemy Keshmiri with
a monster throw of 198 feet, 9
inches. He's a former high school
national champion who owns one
of the 10 best throws by an Amer
ican collegian ever.
