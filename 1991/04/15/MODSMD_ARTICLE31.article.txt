# Spikers ascendant
## But return to form may be too late 
### Kevin Jeffery Staff writer 
The Cardinal men's volleyball
team is peaking at the right time,
unfortunately their ascent may
have come a bit too late.
Fresh from their first league
win in nine weeks, Stanford put
together what coach Ruben
Nieves called "our best pair of
back-to-back matches of the sea
son" in this weekend's non-league
Clash of the Titans tournament.

Men's Volleyball

Cardinal 3, Gauchos 1
Trojans 3, Cardinal 1

Stanford knocked off host UC-
Santa Barbara 15-13, 11-15, 15-
11, 15-8 in the first round of the
tournament on Friday. They fol
lowed that victory with an even
stronger performance, but it
wasn't enough to beat USC in Sat
urday's championship final. The
Men of Troy prevailed in a tight
contest 15-11, 15-10, 11-15, 15-
13.
The Cardinal's markedly
improved play of late may still not
be enough to help it realize its sea
son-long goal of reaching the
Western Intercollegiate Volleyball
Association postseason tourna
ment. The club's 10-match losing
streak during February and
March put Stanford in a position
where, in order to qualify, it will
likely have to upset top-ranked,
defending national champion
USC.
The ninth-ranked Cardinal did
offer itself some hope this week
end, though, as they proved they
could more than compete with the
Trojans. The two clubs met twice
earlier this year — and both
matches resulted in USC
blowouts. The Cardinal fell 15-4,
15-3, 15-3 in a January tourna
ment final, and 15-5, 15-6, 15-10
in a WIVA match in Los Angeles.
But Saturday Stanford gave
USC one of the toughest matches
of its dominating season. So far
the Trojans have compiled a 26-1
record (14-0 in WTVA play).
The Cardinal (8-12, 5-10)
played USC close but fell short in
the first two games. The play of
middle blockers John Bezmali
novic and John Hribar off the
bench sparked them to a third
game victory. The Cardinal then
grabbed a 13-11 lead in the fourth
and threatened to take the match
to a fifth game, before succumb
ing to a decisive four-point Trojan
run.
Nieves found a lot of positives
in the four-game defeat. "Granted
we got the loss, but we felt good
about our overall performance.
Now we know that we can play
with them, and that will help us
coming in to our big WIVA match.
With a few improvements [not to
mention the home crowd at
Maples], you never know what
could happen," he said.
The most important of those
improvements, Nieves said, would
be to cut down USC's hitting per
centage, which was .425 in Satur
day's match.
Clash of the Titans MVP and
1990 NCAA Player of the Year
Brian Ivie led this vicious Trojan

offensive attack. He amassed 43
kills for an almost unheard of .613
hitting percentage. Ivie's domina
tion left the Cardinal wondering if
there was any way to control him
in their upcoming match.
"[lviel pounded 43 kills and
that was with us keying on him
the entire match.... He's just a
phenomenal player," said Nieves.
Stanford kept the match close
by having perhaps its best statisti
cal showing of the year. The team
hit an impressive .354, led by out
side hitter Bob Hillman's 34 kills
for a .371 attacking percentage.
Hillman was named to the Clash's
all-tournament team as was fel
low outside hitter Duncan Black
man.
Blackman added 25 kills for a
.395 percentage against USC, and
led the way in Stanford's best
serving match of the season. He
pounded jump serves for six of the
team's 10 aces.
Bezmalinovic and Hribar led
the Cardinal wall to 20 blocks,
compared to the Trojans' 13. But
perhaps the most telling statistic
of the match was USC's substan
tial advantage in digs. The Tro
jans dug 75 balls in the match
while Stanford could muster only
41 digs.
"To beat USC, we're going to
have to dig a lot more balls. When
you face a dominating player like
Ivie, you're not going to be able to
get a block on him all of the time,
so you really need to focus on dig
ging," Nieves said.
To reach the finals, the Cardi
nal downed the Gauchos in the
first round on their home floor.
The matchup had an interesting
twist as both teams are in a battle
with Loyola Marymount for the
final two berths in the WIVA tour
nament.
For Stanford, the match was
also a quest for redemption, as
they had fallen earlier in the sea
son to UCSB in a WTVA match
with crucial playoff implications.
The Gauchos pounded the Cardi
nal at Santa Barbara Feb. 16 in
three straight games. That con
test was played the night after a
demanding, five-game Cardinal
loss at Long Beach State and was
probably the worst match Stan
ford played this season.
The Cardinal survived a tight
battle Friday, as they outlasted
the eighth-ranked Gauchos in
four games to claim their eighth
victory of the 1991 campaign.
Hillman led the way with 28 kills
for a .354 hitting percentage.
Unfortunately, that match had
no bearing on the playoff chase
that will conclude this Saturday
with the Stanford-USC matchup
at Maples Pavilion. The Cardinal
will probably have to pull off the
biggest upset of the year to reach
the postseason.
Currently Stanford, UCSB,
and 1 lth-ranked Loyola are dead
locked with five league victories
each. Stanford and Loyola have
one match remaining, UCSB has
two.
If the Trojans continue their
dominance and win Saturday, the
Cardinal needs Cal-State
Northridge to beat Loyola Mary
mount Friday, and Santa Barbara
to win either at UCLA or at home
against Long Beach State.


Hajiv Chandrasekaran — Daily file
Ryan Turner had three hits Friday as Stanford clobbered Arizona State 18-10 in Tempe. After the Cardinal won again Saturday the team had
notions of a first-ever sweep of the Sun Devils at Packard Stadium. But Arizona State had other ideas and beat Stanford 10-4 yesterday.
