# Get ready — Pro Fros hit campus today
## 
### Peter Robison Staff writer 
Starting today, about 1,000 high school
seniors will descend on campus for Prospective
Freshmen Week, which is designed to give
them their first taste of life at Stanford.
They may also get a taste of frozen yogurt
here. This Sunday, the winning team of
prospective freshmen in a campus scavenger
hunt will get to eat the Californian dessert
with Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Jean
Fetter.
The April 15-22 Pro Fro Week has been in
preparation since early November, and since
Spring Break its three directors — sopho
mores Sandy Bliss, Michelle Landrey and Jean
Wang — have worked full time in the Admis
sions Office to make final arrangements.
There are about 60 students who signed up
to become dormitory and house coordinators,
and they recruited about 850 student hosts for
the prospective freshmen.
The year of planning "was definitely well
worth it," Landrey said. "Talking to the Pro
Fros the last few weeks has been fun. They are
really excited about getting in — it's great,

because now we're starting to get feedback
from them."
This year the directors emphasized coordi
nating Pro Fro Week with other campus orga
nizations, such as the Black Recruitment and
Orientation Committee, the Latino student
group Project Motivation, the Office cf Resi
dential Education and the Interfraternity and
Intersorority Councils.
While prospective freshmen are not allowed
to participate in Rush events, they will be able
to learn about Greek life at Stanford through a
reception next Friday night at the Sigma Chi
house, where they will meet fraternity and
sorority members.
In addition, Friday's Centennial Culture
Fest, sponsored by the Council of Presidents,
was planned to coincide with Pro Fro Week
and will introduce prospective freshmen to
Stanford's cultural diversity.
The closer coordination with campus orga
nizations has been an improvement from past
years, said Chris Yates, assistant director of
undergraduate admissions. Yates was the
Admissions Office's adviser to the three Pro
Fro Week directors.
"We've created a stronger program for

everyone," Yates said, noting that the sched
ules of each of the campus organizations plan
ning programs for Pro Fro Week are "more
closely integrated, which provided for more
cross-participation."
The purpose of the week, Yates said, is to
allow prospective freshmen "a better sense of
what life is like at Stanford on a day to day
basis, and to get an idea of how much Stanford
has to offer — to get a feel for the diversity and
the richness of the place in general."
The theme of this year's Pro Fro Week is
"Catch our Style," which Bliss said explains
the philosophy of the directors. "We want [the
prospective freshmen] to see Stanford as a
friendly, social environment that also facili
tates learning."
"They will decide to come here because they
will feel comfortable here," Landrey added.
"We've found that what they like best about
Stanford is how friendly the people are."
One of the week's highlights, Yates said, is a
Res Ed presentation Wednesday at Toyon Hall,
which he said will capture the "richness and
uniqueness" of the residential experience at
Stanford.
