# Conservative leader discusses politics, homosexuality
## 
### Brad O'Donnell 
If variety is the spice of life, then irony is the
source of subtle humor. And it is the irony of
Marvin Liebmann's life that lends him his gen
tle, wizened sense of humor.
Liebmann, along with lifelong friend and
political columnist William Buckley, was co
founder of the modern conservative movement
in America. In an address to 30 students in the
Branner lounge Friday, he discussed his 45-
year political career, and more importantly, his
homosexuality.
"I have always been gay," he recalled. "And
while I never made homophobic comments, I
took a wife and pretended to be straight. But I
grew tired of the shame, and coming out has
really been great for me. It has completely
changed how I look at things."
Liebmann's decision to "come out of the

closet" was prompted primarily, he said, by the
shame at 67 of his hypocrisy that became over
whelming in light of the fact that homosexuals
have recently become the target for con
servatives.
He said that despite the recent tide of fer
vent homophobia sweeping the Republican
party, he remains a conservative. When he pub
licly announced his homosexuality last June in
an open letter to Buckley, the party simply
chose to ignore the issue, rather than draw
attention to a homosexual among their ranks.
Buckley's reaction was telling of Lieb
mann's life in general. While the influential
columnist condemned homosexuality publicly
on the basis of his Catholic beliefs, he remains
Liebmann's closest friend.
"I was somewhat disappointed with Buck
ley's reaction," said Liebmann. "But I placed
him in a very precarious situation."

Before he and Buckley attached themselves
to the American right wing, Liebmann said, it
had been an organization of bigots, fused into
political alignment by their racism, Liebmann
said. Liebmann and Buckley helped change all
that, he added.
With the initial editions of Buckley's The
National Review magazine in 1955, the conser
vative movement began rapidly gaining credi
bility and a considerable degree of momentum,
Liebmann said.
"[Presidentl Bush is re-centering the
party," he said, "returning to the less right
wing place it was in before the Barry Goldwa
ter revolution. He doesn't need the far-right,
in fact he wants to get rid of them. But they are
going to be a problem, the bigots and 'know
nothings' and 'pro-family' fundamentalist reli
gious groups. The conservatives must unite
against these people."
