# 'Children of all races and incomes are in increasing peril'
## 
### Mara Mather Staff writer 
Marian Wright Edelman, president and
founder of the Children's Defense Fund,
gave the keynote address of the symposium
"Opening Doors: Advances in Pediatric
Medicine" at the Faculty Club Friday
evening.
The symposium was one of several activ
ities held in the past week to celebrate the
inauguration of the new Lucile Salter
Packard Children's Hospital.
Edelman, who gave last year's com
mencement address, praised the establish
ment of the new hospital, calling it a "won
derful symbol for [the] importance of chil
dren." But the problem of children's health
extends beyond any doctor's responsibility,
she said. It is "a part of a larger context of
poverty in children's lives and families."

She emphasized the importance of chil
dren in American society. "If we do not
invest in children as a top priority, the
country's future ... is not going to be very
strong," she said. "Children of all races and
incomes are in increasing peril."
Trying to convey the urgency of her
cause to the dinner guests at the Faculty
Club, Edelman compared the crisis of
poverty in the United States to the Persian
Gulf war. "Mothers and fathers and chil
dren have as much right to be free of the
tyranny of violence, poverty and fear in
Kansas City as in Kuwait," she said.
"Death stalks America's playgrounds
and streets without a declaration of war or
even a declaration of outraged concern by
our president, Congress, government, state
and local officials [or] citizens," she added.
Edelman noted that although the United
States is one of the richest nations in the

world, its infant mortality rate ranks high
compared to other nations. "I believe it is a
spiritually impoverished nation that per
mits 12 million infants and children to be
the poorest Americans," she said.
Edelman's recommendations to help
American children include:
• "Massive consciousness raising,"
• Personalization of child suffering —
"until people see children, they're not going
to get fa] sense of urgency,"
• Elimination of the "sense that nothing
can be done," because "most children need
a check-up, not intensive care"
• Leadership training and development,
and
• Building a strong political constituency
because children cannot vote for their own
rights.
"We must create a level playing field for
children to start [from]," Eaeiman said.

A longtime civil rights leader and the
first black woman to be admitted to the
Mississippi bar, Edelman founded the Chil
dren's Defense Fund, a Washington, D.C.
advocacy group in 1973. In 1968, she had
founded the the Fund's predecessor, the
Washington Research Project. In 1985, she
was named a Mac Arthur Foundation Prize
Fellow.
David Korn, dean of the School of
Medicine, said, "The name of Marian
Wright Edelman is in the minds of all of us
synonymous with concern for the advocacy
of children. . . . [She] has helped to precipi
tate some sweeping changes in the past two
years."
The symposium, held at Stanford Medi
cal Center Friday and Saturday, addressed
topics such as fetal diagnosis using genetics
and bone marrow and organ transplants.
