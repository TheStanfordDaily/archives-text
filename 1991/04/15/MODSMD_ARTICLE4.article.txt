# Greek issues addressed in COP debate
## 
### Miranda Doyle Staff writer 
Three Council of Presi
dents slates debated at the
Kappa Sigma house last
night, answering questions
ranging from policies
toward Greek organizations
to the scope of ASSU Senate
debate.
Beth Morgan, a Students
First COP candidate, said
her slate plans to "fight for
new houses to be built" for
fraternities and work on giv
ing the Interfraternity
Council and the Intersoror
ity Council more input in
decisions concerning frater
nities and sororities.
Mae Lee, a member of the
People's Platform "Stand
and Deliver" slate, said part
of her slate's platform was
to "reach out to the Greek com
munity."
Slate members also spoke on
whether the senate should debate
issues not related to the campus.
Jennifer Pearson of Stand and
Deliver said she believes the con
troversial senate resolution

opposing the Persian Gulf war
"was not an appropriate forum."
She added that the senate and
COP "need to be accountable"
and that she supports a constitu
tional amendment on the ballot
requiring the senate to conduct a
poll of student opinion before
debating off-campus issues.
Students First COP candidate
John Overdeck, who sponsored
another constitutional amend

ment about the scope of the
ASSU, said "We do not think the
ASSU has the right to speak for
all students." Overdeck's amend
ment would limit debate to Stan
ford issues.
"We should limit ourselves to
things we can directly affect,"
said Morgan. "The Persian Gulf is
not something we can affect."
Both the "Students First" and
"Stand and Deliver" slates said

they would work to prevent sex
ual assault, lower rates for stu
dent parking, listen to student
opinion and represent graduate
students.
"Click Here For Fee Refund,"
sponsored by the Hammer and
Coffin Society, emphasized their
commitment to a revolving
restaurant on top of Hoover
Tower, a resume-packing service
and buying kangaroos.
