# Negotiators extend cost rate discussion
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
University and Office of Naval
Research negotiators agreed Fri
day to give themselves another
week to resolve several issues at
the heart of the controversy over
Stanford's indirect costs of
research.
The two parties had been
expected to announce, among
other things, a revised indirect
cost rate for this year, but "there
are still details to be worked out,"
according to Marc Whetstone, a
Navy spokesperson. Now it
appears an announcement won't
be made until the end of this
week.

The result of the negotiations
is crucial to the financial well
being of the University.
In a speech to students last
week, University President Don
ald Kennedy said Stanford offi
cials expected the indirect-cost
rate to drop "substantially" upon
completion of the negotiations.
With such an outcome, Stan
ford will incur a huge deficit this
year — perhaps larger than $15
million — and the University's
financial plans for the next several
years will be in a state of disarray.
Budget-planners already have
been looking at the possibility of
eliminating some academic pro
grams within the next-few years.
Stanford's indirect-cost rate
currently sits at 70 percent. That
means that when a researcher
seeks a $10,000 grant from the
government, he must also ask the
granting agency for an additional
$7,000 to cover overhead costs
such as utilities, building depreci
ation and administrative
expenses.
Last month, the Defense Con
tract Audit Agency recommended
that Stanford's 1990-91 rate be
dropped to 52 percent, a move

which would be devastating for
the University. Each one-point
drop in the indirect-cost rate
translates into a loss of about
$1.25 million in revenue for Stan
ford. Indirect-cost recovery from
federal research grants accounts
for roughly a quarter of the Uni
versity's operating budget.
The audit agency's recommen
dation of a 52 percent rate is con
sidered advisory by the Office of
Naval Research, which is respon
sible for negotiating the indirect
cost rate applied to all govern
ment research grants and con
tracts at the University.
The current round of negotia
tions between Stanford and the
Navy focuses on the future appli

cability of accounting agreements
the two parties have worked
under in the past.
Several weeks ago, the Navy
informed Stanford that it no
longer considered valid the
methodologies the University had
used to calculate some of its costs,
even though the government had
previously agreed to them.
Stanford was told it would have
to devise new cost studies or
revert to government "default"
formulas for determining how
much federal reimbursement the
University is entitled to.
It now appears likely that Stan
ford will have to use several of
these default formulas until it can
complete new studies justifying

higher levels of reimbursement.
Some of these studies, such as one
on the University's library costs,
will take at least a year to com
plete.
In the interim, Stanford's indi
rect-cost rate will likely plummet
and the financial impact will be
severe. Kennedy told students last
week to expect "a season or two of
very tight belts."
The current negotiations were
prompted by allegations by Navy
representative Paul Biddle that
past cost agreements were much
too generous to Stanford, allowing
the University to recover as much
as $200 million during the last
decade that it was not entitled to.
