# Four Stanford candidates vying to be next dean of students
## 
### Sonya Martinez Staff writer 
Four candidates are under considera
tion for the new dean of students posi
tion, which is being created as part of the
University's reorganization push and will
replace the current dean of student
affairs.
The new position will have a somewhat
different set of responsibilities from those
of the current Acting Dean of Student
Affairs, Norm Robinson, who said he does
not yet know whether he will stay at
Stanford in a new position or go else
where.
The candidates for dean of students all

work at Stanford and have all been assis
tant or associate deans of student affairs.
They are Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Michael Jackson, Asst. Dean of Student
Affairs Jean Kim, Asst. Dean of Student
Affairs James Larimore and lecturer and
post-doctoral fellow Faye McNair-Knox.
The University has held several meet
ings designed to introduce the candidates
to students.
At a meeting last Wednesday, McNair-
Knox said she has "dabbled" in nearly
every arena of Stanford life. She attended
Stanford as an undergraduate and as a
graduate student in linguistics and educa
tion, and she has worked at the Univer
sity as both a staff and faculty member.

McNair-Knox said the bulk of her
experience since graduating has been
dealing with other students. She was an
assistant dean of student affairs from
1981 to 1988.
Larimore discussed his qualifications
and plans for the job at an open meeting
Thursday. He has been assistant dean of
student affairs and director of the Ameri
can Indian Program Office and the Native
American Cultural Center since August
1985.
Jean Kim has been an assistant dean
of student affairs, responsible for gradu
ate student and family services, since
August 1988. She was unavailable for
comment.

Michael Jackson has been associate
dean of student affairs since September
1987. He is currently head of Campus
Affairs, which oversees all of the ethnic
community centers, among other things.
A committee of faculty, staff and stu
dents conducted much of the initial
search for candidates for the position,
Mahoney said. The committee will advise
Mahoney on selecting a candidate, which
she hopes to do this month, she said. The
committee consists of five students, five
faculty and two staff members.
Council of Presidents member Ingrid
Nava, a member of the selection commit
tee, said the committee had reached a
general consensus that all the candidates

were qualified. She added, however, that
whoever gets the job "will shape it,"and
that person's outlook will contribute to
how much contact he or she has with stu
dents.
Another committee member, graduate
student David Bradfute said the changes
in the dean's responsibilities will in some
ways be positive, since the position will be
smaller and more concentrated on "the
things that most affect students."
On the other hand, he said, the dean of
students, unlike the current dean of stu
dent affairs, will report to the vice presi
dent for student resources instead of
