# Ruling won't affect Bookstore course readers, manager says
## 
### Amy McConnell 
A recent federal court ruling that lim
its the printing of copyrighted materials
will probably not affect the availability
and price of course readers at the Book
store, officials say.
In fact, the ruling may help the Book
store by hurting its competitors, said
Roger Reynolds, manager of textbooks,
because the Bookstore has been getting
permission from publishers and paying
royalties for all copied materials all along.
Eight publishing companies joined in a
suit against Kinko's Graphics Corpora
tion in April 1989 for "infringing on pub
lishers' copyrights by reproducing
excerpts from books and selling them in
anthologies for college students."

Kinko's cited the Fair Use Clause of
the 1976 Federal Copyright Act in
defense. The clause permits faculty mem
bers to make multiple copiej of copy
righted work for educational use without
permission from the publisher.
On April 3, U.S. District Court Judge
Constance Motley ruled that all copy
righted materials must be cleared with
publishers. She also fined Kinko's
$510,000, saying their "insistence that
theirs are educational concerns and not
profit-making ones boggles the mind."
Adrianna Ross, corporate communica
tions director for Kinko's, said the new
regulations will not affect Kinko's on a
large scale. "In the past, we looked for
copyrighted materials that came to us to
see if they fell into the Fair Use guide

lines," said Ross. "If they didn't, they
went through our Fair Use Rights and
Permissions Department, which clears
our copyrights."
The ruling simply means that all
materials will now have to go through the
Permissions Department, she said.
However, Reynolds predicts that the
ruling will slow production and raise the
price of Kinko's course readers. Clearing
permission with publishers can take up to
six weeks, and the cost of royalties will be
tacked on to the readers.
Kinko's took out several half-page
advertisements in last week's Daily, apol
ogizing "for any inconvenience" students
may have experienced in getting course
readers this quarter.
The ads further read, "The timing of

the decision means some class materials
will not be available in a timely manner
this term. Kinko's is striving to ensure
that this delay will not recur."
Reynolds said, "Now everyone will be
doing what we did all along. We have
always had agreements with some pub
lishers. Anyone we haven't had an agree
ment with, we have contacted."
"Kinko's should have been paying the
owners of copyrighted material for what
they had produced," Reynolds said.
"Unintentionally, Kinko's led everybody
to believe that it's okay to photocopy
copyrighted material (without asking per
mission)," he added.
"Other copying companies and even
faculty and professors have all fallen into
the trap of thinking, 'Oh, it's that easy to

copy materials; then I'll do it too.' Finally,
publishers started asking themselves why
they were making so few sales. They
checked it out and found that many of
their materials were being copied and sold
without any compensation to the publish
ers."
"The Bookstore has had to charge
higher prices than Kinko's because we
had to tack a royalty cost on to the price
of readers," said Reynolds. "Unfortu
nately we've been looked at as gouging,
when really we've just been doing what
we're supposed to do all along." Now roy
alty costs will be included in readers pro
duced everywhere.
Said Reynolds, "It's a very fair court
decision, and it should have happened 10
years ago."
