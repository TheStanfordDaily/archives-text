# The 						expanding scope of the indirect-cost probe
## 
### 
Various government agencies have taken the following actions since the March 13 hearing that
examined Stanford's Indirect-cost policies. Other universities are now facing similar scrutiny.
House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations
□ The subcommittee, chaired by John Dingell, D-Mich., has sent letters to the 56 universities that belong
to the Association of American Universities, instructing them to "scrub" their accounting pools.
□ The subcommittee tentatively plans to hold another hearing on indirect research costs at universities in
June. Representatives from Harvard Medical School and MIT are likely to be invited, a congressional
investigator says. Harvard recently withdrew $500,000 in questionable and unallowable charges from
this year's cost submission to the government. A congressional investigator says MIT has "problems
similar to Stanford."
Department of Health and Human Services
□ The Inspector General of Health and Human Services has sent investigators to Dartmouth College,
Duke University, Emory University, Johns Hopkins University and Yale University.
□ The department has also decided to audit Rutgers University, Washington University (in St. Louis), the
University of Chicago, the University of Michigan, the University of Pittsburgh, the University of
Southern California and the University of Texas' Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas.
□ The department may audit seven to nine other institutions.
□ The department has informed Harvard that the indirect-cost rate at its medical school will be reduced
on July 1 from 88 to 65 percent, pending the outcome of current negotiations.
The Office of Naval Research
□ The naval office will review practices at all 39 research universities it is responsible for overseeing,
including Caltech and MIT.
