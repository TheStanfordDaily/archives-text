# Increase in faculty salaries lower than inflation rate
## 
### Peter Cousins Staff writer 
Average increases in faculty
salaries at Stanford and across the
nation were just under the infla
tion rate this year, according to a
recent study.
However, Stanford salaries
remain significantly higher than
the national average.
A study by the American Asso
ciation of University Professors
cited in the April 3 Chronicle of
Higher Education said that while
the cost of living in the United
States will increase by 6 percent
for the year ending June 1991, the
average salary of professors at
U.S. universities will only increase
by 5.4 percent.
The average salary for a full
professor will be $56,210 during
this period, the study said, while
associate professors will earn an
average of $41,780. Assistant pro
fessors will receive an average of
$34,640.

Full professors at Stanford,
however, will earn an average of
$86,088 in the same period, an
increase of 5 percent from last
year. Associate professors will
receive an average of $62,748 — a
5.4 percent increase. Salaries for
assistant professors will average
$52,583, an increase of 5.6 per
cent.
Dana Shelley, a staff associate
and budget planner with the
Office of Planning and Manage
ment, said the increase is based on
a University-calculated inflation
rate. The 1990-91 Stanford-calcu
lated rate is 4.25 percent, she said.
While increases in salaries do
reflect the increase in the cost of
living, this is not the main focus of
the University's salary increase
plan, Shelley stressed. "The pri
mary goal is to attract the very
best people, " she said. In order to
remain competitive in an "inter
national" market for faculty
members, salary increases take
into account several factors,

including the cost of living.
Kenneth Down, associate dean
of the School of Engineering, said
attracting and retaining younger
faculty members is an important
part of maintaining excellence in
his school. "We try to keep our
young professors competitive," he
said, adding that he wants to
make Stanford an attractive place
to work.
"Our long-term assumption is
that [faculty salaries! will increase
at inflation plus 1.5 percent,"
Shelley said.
However, she added, this
doesn't mean each faculty mem
ber will automatically receive a
salary increase of that size each
year.
Salaries are set by the the indi
vidual schools and departments,
which receive lump sums that
reflect the calculated yearly infla
tion rate, Shelley said. Each
department then decides the
increase for each of its faculty
members.
