# Selling Stanford
## Promotional spots on University airing across nation 
### Matthew Werdegar Staff writer 
Get-rich-quick schemes are not
the only things advertised on late
night television in America. Tele
vision stations across the country
are also broadcasting 30-second
clips highlighting Stanford and its
achievements.
The promotional television
spots feature scenes of professors
lecturing, Gorbachev arriving on
campus and students tutoring and
recycling. And all five close with a
dramatic aerial shot of the Quad.
NBC news anchor Tom Brokaw
and KPIX anchor Kate Kelly nar
rate the spots.
Most of the commercials run
late at night as part of the sta
tions' public-service program
ming. The spots have also been
run during television coverage of
Stanford athletic events.
The Office of Public Affairs

developed and produced the spots
this summer as a part of its Cen
tennial Celebration publicity
efforts. Asst. Director of the Cen
tennial Celebration Susan Wolfe
said the spots were designed to
increase national awareness of
Stanford.
"We wanted to tell people in our
community how Stanford may
have touched their lives. We took
the most tangible and visible ele
ments of the University and
showed how they affected people
across the country," said Wolfe.
The promotional spots were
also intended to increase alumni
interest in the University. Wolfe
said, "We wanted to bond alumni
to the University. We wanted to
remind them that we were still
here."
Videotapes of the five spots
were sent to 80 television stations
in the 70 largest cities in the
United States. The University is

not buying air time for the spots,
but hopes stations will play the
spots as a part of their public-ser
vice programming.
Wolfe said the University asked
stations to try to air the spot in
the time surrounding the Centen
nial Celebration.
KGO, the San Francisco ABC
affiliate, said it began showing the
spot in December and probably
will continue using it until June.
The promotional television
campaign was developed last May
and was completed at the begin
ning of October. The Public
Affairs Office says the spots are
not a response to the indirect-cost
controversy.
Four of the spots, narrated by
Brokaw, focus on Stanford's con
tributions to high technology,
medicine, public service and the
arts. The fifth, narrated by Kelly,
presents a general overview of
Stanford.
