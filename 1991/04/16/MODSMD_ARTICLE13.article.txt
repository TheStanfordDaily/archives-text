ISIKVEREN, Turkey (AP) -
Yesterday Turkey began moving
thousa.. Js of ill and starving Iraqi
Kurds from this mountainous
border se. lement to camps far
ther inside Turkey where they
will be easier to feed and shelter.
At a squalid Iranian refugee
camp, hundreds of Kurdish men
said they were returning to Iraq to
fight.
But along Iraq's long borders
with Iran and Turkey, thousands
of uprooted people continued to
stream out of the troubled coun
try.
Turkish official said the num
ber of refugees in their country
stood at 500,000 and could soon
reach 700,000. Close to 1 million
have crossed into Iran or were en
route.
State Department spokesper
son Margaret Tutwiler said nearly
400,000 Iraqis have fled to Turkey
and another 400,000 are reported
to be across the border.
She said from 400 to 1,000
refugees were dying each day in
the Turkish border region, and
the toll was increasing under the
harsh conditions along the moun
tainous border.
Dia Sindi, a 17-year old Kurd in
Isikveren, a tent city of 160,000
refugees, said she missed her
homeland but would not return
any time soon.
"If they kill Saddam I will go
back," she said.
Sindi was among 2,100
refugees moved down from this
7,200-foot plateau to a new camp
near the township of Silopi, 36
miles inside Turkey. The new
camp will have water, electricity
and medical supplies. The tent
settlement will have a 400-bed
hospital, 64 doctors and 129 med
ical personnel, Health Minister
Halil Sivgin said.
The order to move the refugees
to new bases represented a major

policy shift for President Turgut
Ozal's government, which previ
ously had kept the refugees in the
mountains, saying it could not
deal with the influx.
Turkey has often suppressed
its own sizeable Kurdish minority,
even banning public use of the
Kurdish language, and battled
Kurdish rebels for years. At the
same time, it has sheltered an
estimated 60,000 Kurds since
they fled Iraq in 1988.
The Istanbul newspaper Hur
riyet said Turkey decided to allow
the refugees deeper into the coun
try after President Bush assured
Ozal the refugees would return to
Iraq when Saddam Hussein's gov
ernment collapsed.
Turkish officials stressed that
the resettlement was temporary.
At the border camp of Cukurca,
Turkey, relief workers on yester
day began installing water pipes
and toilets. Dozens of children
have died of exposure and disease
there in the past two days.
Associated Press correspon
dent Rasit Gurdilek, who is along
the border, said clan leaders in
some camps were deciding who
would be moved in the first con
voys from the mountain areas.
Iran's official radio, mean
while, said the country's Red
Crescent Society, the equivalent of
the Red Cross, was running out of
relief supplies for the more than
900,000 of Iraq's 4 million Kurds
who have fled to Iran.
Kurdish rebel leaders said yes
terday they had issued a new call
to arms, and hundreds of male
refugees would leave the squalid
camps and return to Iraq to fight
Saddam.
"We demand all Kurdish fight
ers to battle to the end of life,"
said Mohammed Shokat, a repre
sentative of the Democratic Party
of Kurdistan, based in the Iranian
border town of Sardasht.

installs a street lamp and speaker on the Iraqi-Turkish border yesterday. Turkish sol
diers are erecting a border fence between the two countries to keep refugees in the
Iraqi camp.
