# Cheney: proposed base closings apolitical
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) -
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
rejected congressional charges
yesterday that politics played a
role in his proposal to close 43 U.S.
military bases and scale back 28
other installations.
"When I made the announce
ment ... I did not know at that
time which bases fell in which
members' districts. I did not want
to know,"the Pentagon chief told
the Base Closure and Realign
ment Commission.
Cheney said he wanted to avoid

accusations that the list is based
on political affiliation, but charges
of partisanship surfaced even
before the recommendation was
officially announced on Friday.
"I don't know what those peo
ple are thinking about but it
almost looks like the Democratic
strongholds have been hit the
worst," said Rep. Joe Moakley, D-
Mass., who complained about the
proposed closure of Fort Devens.
Among the m(\jor base closings
are Fort Ord in California, located
in the district of House Budget

Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif.,
and the Philadelphia Naval Ship
yard in the home state of House
Assistant Democratic leader Bill
Gray and in the district of Demo
cratic Rep. Thomas Foglietta.
Cheney responded that the Cal«
ifornia governor, Pete Wilson, and
one senator, John Seymour, are
Republicans while GOP Sen.
Arlen Specter represents Pennsyl
vania.
"This is a good faith effort . . .
without consideration to the party
of the members who represent the

districts," Cheney told the com
mission at a Capitol Hill hearing.
The eight-member, indepen
dent panel has until July 1 to
decide whether to approve or
amend Cheney's list before for
warding it to President Bush and
Congress, who are required to
accept or reject the package in its
entirety.
The commission gave little
indication as to how it might
change Cheney's list after it com
pletes a 75-day review, including
public hearings and meetings with
various lawmakers.
No panel member mentioned a
specific facility.
"The commissioners will inde
pendently review them and make
up their own minds," said Jim
Courter, a former New Jersey rep
resentative who heads the com
mission.
"It's an excellent report. It
seems to make sense," said com
mission member Howard Call
away.
Meanwhile, a House Republi
can suggested that the Navy and
Army protected bases that should
be closed and has asked the Gen
eral Accounting Office to examine
closely those services' portions of
the Pentagon proposal.
Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, a
member of the House Armed Ser
vices Committee, said only the Air
Force seems to have been "intel
lectually honest. It's not just one
service that's supposed to
undergo streamlining."
Kasich represents part of
Columbus. Rickenbacker Air
National Guard Base, which is on
Cheney's list for closure, is located
in the other part of the city.
Under law, the GAO, Congress'
investigative arm, must review
the base closing data used by the
Pentagon and report to the com
mission by May 15.
