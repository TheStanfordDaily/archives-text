## U.N. urged to begin war-crimes trial 
### 
LUXEMBOURG (AP) -
The European Community
said yesterday that Saddam
Hussein is responsible for war
crimes in the Persian Gulf con
flict and urged the United
Nations to begin proceedings
against him.
Foreign ministers of the 12
EC nations agreed on the pro
posal by Germany's foreign
minister, Hans-Dietrich Gen
scher. They also said a war trial
of the Iraqi president should
include charges of genocide
against Iraq's Kurdish minor
ity. Hundreds of thousands of
Kurds have fled northern Iraq
after Saddam's army crushed
their uprising.
"Saddam Hussein is person
ally responsible for the plight
of the Kurds," said Belgium's
foreign minister, Mark
Eyskens, noting accusations
that Saddam u?ed chemical
weapons on the Kurds.
He added: "Allusion is made
here to Nuremberg" — the war
crimes tribunal of Nazi Ger
man leaders after World War
11.
Luxembourg Foreign Minis
ter Jacques Poos, whose coun
try holds the EC presidency,
will raise the issue of a war
crimes trial with U.N. Secre
tary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar today, officials said.
Perez de Cuellar is to
address the European Parlia
ment, the EC's 518-member
assembly, today in Strasbourg,
France.
"(The EC) will contact the
secretary-general of the United
Nations to see if, and how, Sad
dam Hussein can be brought to

trial far his crimes against
humanity bfised con
ventions against wwr-rrirnes
and genocide, Dutch Foreign
Minister Hans van den Broek
said.
He spoke of "irrefutable
crimes" by Saddam during the
Gulf war and the repression of
a Kurdish rebellion against his
regime that followed it.
Poos acknowledged the
chance of Saddam actually
standing trial was "slim" but
called the EC "a clear political
signal to the Iraqi dictator and
other dictators in the years to
come who might be inclined to
follow Saddam Hussein's
example."
Before the Gulf war began
Jan. 17, the EC said it would
hold any Iraqi official "violat
ing the rights of innocent citi
zens" responsible for their
actions, van den Broek noted.
At the time, Saddam had
prevented thousands of for
eigners from leaving Iraq and
held them hostage as his
"guests." He later let them go.
British Foreign Office min
ister Tristan Garel-Jones said
under U.N. conventions, Sad
dam could be tried for war
crimes, either in an Iraqi court
or in a court of another country
that is a signatory to the con
vention, or in an international
court especially set up for that
purpose.
He said while the EC
nations hold the "unanimous
view . . . that (Saddam) be per
sonally called to account for his
crimes, it was not for us to get
drawn into a specific discussion
about how and when."
