## The 						postwar blues 
### 
NOW THAT THE TRUCE IS offi
cial, the Gulf war is over for most
people (except, of course, for the
Kurds). Curiously, not everyone has wel
comed its end with an unmitigated sense
of relief.
Perhaps most affected are the pundits
who argued against the war based on
dire predictions about its likely length
and death toll among U.S. troops. Of
course, hindsight is always 20/20, and I
don't remember many proponents of the
war claiming that it would be brief or
relatively painless for the United States.
Still, more than a few war supporters
feel entitled to gloat.
The outcome of the conflict undeni
ably has damaged the credibility of many
politicians who opposed it as well. The
success of the war is a boost to the
Republicans, while much of the Demo
cratic Party has been left in disarray.
Many presidential hopefuls are now
thinking twice about opposing an appar
ently undefeatable George Bush in 1992.
However, Bush himself is less than
perfectly happy. The plight of the Kurds
and the fact that Saddam Hussein
remains in power add a bitter aftertaste
to the sweet victory. It also has been
whispered that he might face a presiden
tial rival in the extremely popular Gen.
Norman Schwarzkopf, who will retire
from the armed forces in a few months.
In addition, Bush is hurt by the evap
oration of euphoria over the success of
the war. His popularity rating is down 12
percent from late February, as people
once again confront a wide array of
domestic problems. Bush's studied

neglect of these issues and his frequent
opposition to measures that might help
resolve them put a damper on his for
tunes. He may now find it difficult to
coast to re-election based solely on the
results of this war, as he might have
done had it lasted longer.
Perhaps the most interesting (but
galling) report I have heard of people
feeling blue over the war's end came on
the news on ABC news about two weeks
ago. Spouses of U.S. soldiers in the Gulf,
who had been getting together regularly
to discuss news from the front and to
prepare care packages to be sent to the
troops, now no longer shared such com
mon concerns. Their sense of purpose
had disappeared, leaving them quite
dejected.
I am irritated both by the self-cen
teredness of the interests of these people,
and by the fact that ABC thought it
worthwhile to put them on national tele
vision, probably at the expense of some
item of "real" news that was deemed less
able to hold the interest of the average
viewer.
I see no reason why people should
stop being concerned about events in the
Middle East, or anywhere else in the
world, merely because their loved ones
are no longer directly involved. If this is
the extent of their involvement in inter
national affairs, it reflects rather nega
tively on the society in which such atti
tudes are bred. It certainly sends a dan
gerous message to the government that
it can do what it likes as long as few
Americans are involved.
Moreover, there is a plethora of causes

that could re-infuse these people with a
sense of purpose. They could volunteer
time to work with the homeless, to com
bat illiteracy, to help in their children's
schools, to fight for a clean and safe envi
ronment, etc. All are worthwhile endeav
ors and, on the whole, are more likely to
create a better world for our children
than is sending care packages to U.S.
troops.
Finally, why should humanitarian
concerns be limited to the welfare of our
own people abroad? There are many
agencies that would welcome contribu
tions of time or goods to assist those in
need (especially the Kurds) now that the
war is over. Nor is the Middle East the
only area in the world where thousands
are dying in desperate conditions and
relief agencies are perennially short of
resources.
It would be a terrible waste to sink
back into apathy and to allow the sense
of involvement and active participation
generated by the war against Iraq to dis
appear now that a semblance of peace
has returned, when so many problems at
home, in the Gulf and throughout the
world remain unresolved.
