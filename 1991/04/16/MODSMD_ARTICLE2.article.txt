# Harvard faces same woes
## Cost rate at medical school may be cut substantially 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
While Stanford and Navy nego
tiators continue to haggle this
week over the University's indi
rect-cost rate, a similar drama is
unfolding at Stanford's rival in
the East.
A federal official has told Har
vard Medical School that its rate
will be substantially reduced
pending the outcome of ongoing
scrutiny of the school's billing
practices.
According to a Harvard spokes
person, an official from the
Department of Health and
Human Services recently in
formed the medical school that, as
of July 1, its indirect-cost rate will
be reduced to 65 percent, more
than 30 points lower than Har
vard's proposed rate for this year
of 96 percent.

Health and Human Services
plays an oversight role at Harvard
similar to that the Office of Naval
Research plays at Stanford.
Unlike Stanford, though, Harvard
negotiates the rate at its medical
school separately from the rate
applied to the rest of the univer
sity's research grants.
The Harvard spokesperson said
the medical school will appeal
Health and Human Services' deci
sion. If the appeal is unsuccessful,
the decision could cost Harvard
about $6 million of the $20 million
the medical school expects to
receive in federal overhead reim
bursements in the next year.
The development is further evi
dence of how costly the current
clampdown on indirect costs at
research universities nationwide
may prove.
Stanford, as the first case study
of the House Subcommittee on

Oversight and Investigations,
received a substantial amount of
negative publicity for items such
as flowers and antiques that had
been included in its indirect-cost
claims but seemingly had little to
do with research.
However, the public humilia
tion may pale in comparison with
the financial toll the investiga
tions ultimately take. Rumors
abound that Stanford's indirect
cost rate may drop as low as 60
percent by the close of negotia
tions this week.
Stanford originally budgeted
for a rate of 78 percent. Since
then, the rate had been knocked
down several times and currently
sits at 70 percent. Each one-point
drop translates into a $1.25 mil
lion loss in revenue for the Uni
versity.
While most public attention
has focused on items such as
yachts and receptions, the real
dollar impact lies in less sexy com
ponents of indirect-cost recovery
such as library usage, utilities and
building depreciation. University
and federal officials must negoti
ate what percentage of these costs
the government will agree to pay.
Under the heavy glare of Rep.
John Dingell, D-Mich., Navy offi
cials responsible for negotiating
with Stanford are driving a much
harder bargain than ever before.
At the hearing, several Office of
Naval Research representatives
took a heavy beating. Rep. Nor
man Lent, R-N.Y., called the naval
agency's performance at Stanford
during the last decade "nothing
short of pitiful."
Health and Human Services
officials now appear to be posi
tioning themselves in the Harvard
investigation to avoid a similar
lambasting.
Meanwhile, the end of the con
troversy is nowhere in sight. The
Office of Naval Research has
ordered stepped-up reviews at all
39 of the universities it oversees.
Health and Human Services is
auditing about 20 institutions.
And the Dingell subcommittee
has sent a letter to 56 schools
instructing them to "scrub" their
accounting pools so similar find
ings as those at Stanford need not
be made public.
Last week Harvard announced
it would withdraw $500,000 in
questionable and unallowable
charges from its current overhead
submission to the government,

including costs associated with its
university president's residence.
The withdrawal, a congres
sional investigator said, was
inspired by "the fear of God and
the fear of Dingell."
The Harvard initiative followed
closely on the heels of a similar
move by Caltech, another univer
sity likely to receive close scrutiny
by Dingell's subcommittee. Fed

eral auditors testified at the Stan
ford hearing last month that Cal
tech had recently withdrawn
$500,000 in indirect costs of
research from the past three
years.
The expenses included golf and
health-club memberships, an
$80,000 board of trustees meeting
in Palm Springs and various food
and beverage costs.
