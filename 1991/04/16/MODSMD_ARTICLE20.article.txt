ASSU cannot purport
to represent the views
of all students here
Council of Presidents member Good
win Liu's April 10 letter to The Daily
continued the ASSU's misrepresentation
of challenges to its authority. Liu charac
terizes the Overdeck bill and its support
ers as being opposed to any discussion of
issues outside of Stanford. In fact, I sup
port the Overdeck bill because it has
been the only proposal to limit the over
whelming presumption of the ASSU
Senate.
The range of topics appropriately con
sidered by the senate is not the only
issue here. My main concern is not that
the ASSU spends time on national
issues, but that it purports to represent
my viewpoint in the process.
In many of their pronouncements on
important topics, the ASSU has explic
itly claimed to reveal what "the students
of Stanford University" think. The
ASSU does not, in fact, represent what I
think; nor, I suspect, does it represent
accurately what the mcyority of students
here think. I applaud all pronounce
ments by the senate about what it thinks
â€” that, presumably, is within its scope of
comprehension. Similarly, I welcome any
ASSU pronouncements about student
opinion that is supported by an opinion
poll, such as the poll that was taken last
year on the abortion issue, so long as the
limitations of the poll are noted.
Liu and others will undoubtedly
respond to my complaint by saying that
they are the duly elected representatives
of the students, and therefore may speak
for them. The ASSU could learn a lesson
from the U.S. Senate, which does not
claim to represent the views of all Ameri
cans when it makes a statement of opin
ion. When the Senate voted early in the
Gulf situation to indicate approval of
President Bush's actions, it said, "this
Senate supports," not "the people of
America support." When the Senate lam

basted the U.S. Supreme Court for pro
tecting flag burning as free speech, it
said, "this Senate opposes," not "the
American people oppose."
Good leadership, as Liu points out,
involves pursuing important issues and
advocating specific positions. However,
responsible leaders do not in their hubris
usurp more power of representation that
is rightfully theirs. They accurately say,
"You elected me, this is what I think of
this subject." They do not say, " You
elected me, this is what you think of this
subject."
Perhaps the Overdeck bill is too blunt
an instrument to restrain the ASSU
from overstepping such subtle bound
aries. Nevertheless, the opposition to the
bill has ignored the feelings of the stu
dent body on this matter.
