Dissatisfied students
should give their TAs
immediate feedback
As a graduate student in chemistry at
Stanford, I would like to respond to some
of the issues raised by Elizabeth Feil in
her April 9 letter to The Daily.
I would like to begin by pointing out
that there are good teaching assistants
and bad TAs, just like there are good
professors and bad professors, good stu
dents and bad students. A great deal of
this relates directly to an individual's
interest in teaching well (or learning
well). If a student sees a TA position as
just one more requirement to complete
in order to obtain a Ph.D., it is unlikely
that his or her performance as a TA
would be wonderful.
Happily, it has been my experience
that most graduate students in chem
istry are eager to do a good job teaching,
and that many regard teaching as the
most rewarding part of their routine. We
remember how important good teachers
were to us as undergraduates and are
anxious to help make our classes positive
experiences for our students. None of us
seeks to make them traumatic.
Most TAs did not begin their careers
in chemistry at Stanford, so it is true
that few of us have taken specific under
graduate courses here. However, this is
not generally a problem, since at the
beginning of the term the professor
meets with the TAs to brief them on
course content, grading procedures and
other relevant issues. The fact that a TA
has completed the course material in a
different form is often beneficial, rather

than detrimental, to his or her teaching:
The TA is familiar with different ways of
explaining a concept, with different real
life examples, with different texts to pro
vide supplementary readings or prob
lems.
The goal is to give the student a good
feel for principles in organic chemistry
rather than to teach precisely the mate
rial covered on the final exam for Chem
istry 33. We try to impart a broader
understanding as well.
Most TAs take their responsibilities
very seriously. Many attend all class
meetings, and most who don't only miss
lectures on occasion. In general, office
hours are geared to the needs of the stu
dents; the TA will make sure his or her
hours are acceptable both in times
offered and in duration with his or her
students.
Many will adjust hours to meet stu
dent requests and offer additional hours
prior to exams. Laboratory TAs devote
additional time before lab meetings
familiarizing themselves with equip
ment, reagents and safety procedures.
Several of us have actually performed
the labs ahead of time ourselves to ascer
tain the length of experiments and what
problems are most likely to arise. In gen
eral, TAs put in a lot more hours in real
life than they do on paper.
Still, some TAs do a better job than
others. How do we improve TAs across
the board? An extensive training pro
gram? Probably not. The best way to
learn how to teach seems to be to get
into a classroom and teach. A contest to
crown the best TA? Probably not. If stu
dents want to motivate their TAs and
reward them for a job well done, the best
way is to say, "I appreciate the effort you
have put into teaching this class."

The best way to help your TA teach
better is to give him or her your con
structive criticism early and often. Sav
ing complaints for the course evaluations
in too late to improve the class for you. I
know of no TA who professes to be a
master instructor. We benefit from your
feedback and actively seek it. Even if a
TA seems unapproachable, sound him or
her out. Or speak to the head TA or the
professor.
It seems to me that if Feil had spoken
to her TAs with her suggestions for
improving chemistry at Stanford, some
of her classes might not have been "trau
matic experiences." Unfortunately, a let
ter to The Daily after the fact does noth
ing to improve her experience. With luck,
more direct communication with TAs .
and professors can improve the situation
for others now.

Don't be apathetic;
all can help save the
Kurds from repression
As the son of a Holocaust survivor, I
was always taught to say "never again."
Never again should we close our eyes to
atrocities. Never again should we —
actively or passively — commit genocide.
On April 10, we commemorated the six
million Jews who were massacred by the
Nazis while the world stood by and
watched. Ironically, today, we are about
to passively witness the slaughter of the
Kurdish population in Iraq.
Saddam Hussein's armies want to
spread their wrath and frustrations on a

Lack of action in the
face of this perfidious
crime against humanity
would be morally rep
rehensible

defenseless minority that has been
oppressed and ignored for too long.
Whole families are running away from
their villages under a storm of bullets,
missiles and, allegedly, poison gas. Elder
ly people who can barely walk and chil
dren who can hardly talk are being
threatened by cold and bloody carnage.
Lack of action in the face of this per
fidious crime against humanity is moral
ly reprehensible. Silent observers con
done the barrage of vicious rapes and
wholesale murders by not shrieking for
justice.
Do something now. Write your repre
sentative (Honorable ; House of
Representatives; Washington, D.C.
20515) and senators (Honorable ;
U.S. Senate; Washington, D.C. 20510) to
let them know you do not want to be a
silent witness to this bloodshed. Call the
White House at (202) 456-7639 or (202)
647-4910 (public comment line) immedi
ately. At the very least, the United States
should warn the "Butcher of Baghdad"
to uphold the cease-fire agreement: to
stop plunging civilians with helicopter
missiles and to cease using chemical
weapons to quell demonstrations or
uprisings.
If we stand by idly in our couches

while we watch the swarm of dead bodies
accumulate, our homes will be impreg
nated with the foul smell of guilt. Let us
not have to carry more of the onus so far
shouldered for not acting as a responsi
ble society. Say NEVER AGAIN: Do not
allow another million people to die.
Please act now.

Graduate student, law
Stanford community
discriminates against
Greek organizations
In a recent public appearance, Law
Prof. Thomas Grey, looking for a term to
describe "typical" sexists, arrived at the
phrase "frat boys." No one objected to
his word choice; no one questioned his
generalization.
Indeed, it is a fact that many fraterni
ty boys are sexists. It is also a fact that
an astounding proportion of blacks are
criminals. Most people at Stanford, how
ever, do not choose to infer that all
blacks are criminals; to do so would be
unfair to those who are not.
Grey's terminology and his audience's
acceptance of it were not out of the ordi
nary. The same Stanford community
that abhors racial discrimination, con
dones — even encourages — discrimina
tion against fraternity and sorority men
and women.
So to all freshmen rushing, be
warned: By pledging, you join the only
group on campus that is the object of
open and unchallenged discrimination.

the labs ahead of time ourselves to ascer
tain the length of experiments and what
problems are most likely to arise. In gen
eral, TAs put in a lot more hours in real
life than they do on paper.
Still, some TAs do a better job than
others. How do we improve TAs across
the board? An extensive training pro
gram? Probably not. The best way to
learn how to teach seems to be to get
into a classroom and teach. A contest to
crown the best TA? Probably not. If stu
dents want to motivate their TAs and
reward them for a job well done, the best
way is to say, "I appreciate the effort you
have put into teaching this class."

The best way to help your TA teach
better is to give him or her your con
structive criticism early and often. Sav
ing complaints for the course evaluations
in too late to improve the class for you. I
know of no TA who professes to be a
master instructor. We benefit from your
feedback and actively seek it. Even if a
TA seems unapproachable, sound him or
her out. Or speak to the head TA or the
professor.
It seems to me that if Feil had spoken
to her TAs with her suggestions for
improving chemistry at Stanford, some
of her classes might not have been "trau
matic experiences." Unfortunately, a let
ter to The Daily after the fact does noth
ing to improve her experience. With luck,
more direct communication with TAs .
and professors can improve the situation
for others now.

Don't be apathetic;
all can help save the
Kurds from repression
As the son of a Holocaust survivor, I
was always taught to say "never again."
Never again should we close our eyes to
atrocities. Never again should we —
actively or passively — commit genocide.
On April 10, we commemorated the six
million Jews who were massacred by the
Nazis while the world stood by and
watched. Ironically, today, we are about
to passively witness the slaughter of the
Kurdish population in Iraq.
Saddam Hussein's armies want to
spread their wrath and frustrations on a

Lack of action in the
face of this perfidious
crime against humanity
would be morally rep
rehensible

defenseless minority that has been
oppressed and ignored for too long.
Whole families are running away from
their villages under a storm of bullets,
missiles and, allegedly, poison gas. Elder
ly people who can barely walk and chil
dren who can hardly talk are being
threatened by cold and bloody carnage.
Lack of action in the face of this per
fidious crime against humanity is moral
ly reprehensible. Silent observers con
done the barrage of vicious rapes and
wholesale murders by not shrieking for
justice.
Do something now. Write your repre
sentative (Honorable ; House of
Representatives; Washington, D.C.
20515) and senators (Honorable ;
U.S. Senate; Washington, D.C. 20510) to
let them know you do not want to be a
silent witness to this bloodshed. Call the
White House at (202) 456-7639 or (202)
647-4910 (public comment line) immedi
ately. At the very least, the United States
should warn the "Butcher of Baghdad"
to uphold the cease-fire agreement: to
stop plunging civilians with helicopter
missiles and to cease using chemical
weapons to quell demonstrations or
uprisings.
If we stand by idly in our couches

while we watch the swarm of dead bodies
accumulate, our homes will be impreg
nated with the foul smell of guilt. Let us
not have to carry more of the onus so far
shouldered for not acting as a responsi
ble society. Say NEVER AGAIN: Do not
allow another million people to die.
Please act now.

Stanford community
discriminates against
Greek organizations
In a recent public appearance, Law
Prof. Thomas Grey, looking for a term to
describe "typical" sexists, arrived at the
phrase "frat boys." No one objected to
his word choice; no one questioned his
generalization.
Indeed, it is a fact that many fraterni
ty boys are sexists. It is also a fact that
an astounding proportion of blacks are
criminals. Most people at Stanford, how
ever, do not choose to infer that all
blacks are criminals; to do so would be
unfair to those who are not.
Grey's terminology and his audience's
acceptance of it were not out of the ordi
nary. The same Stanford community
that abhors racial discrimination, con
dones — even encourages — discrimina
tion against fraternity and sorority men
and women.
So to all freshmen rushing, be
warned: By pledging, you join the only
group on campus that is the object of
open and unchallenged discrimination.

Dissatisfied students
should give their TAs
immediate feedback
As a graduate student in chemistry at
Stanford, I would like to respond to some
of the issues raised by Elizabeth Feil in
her April 9 letter to The Daily.
I would like to begin by pointing out
that there are good teaching assistants
and bad TAs, just like there are good
professors and bad professors, good stu
dents and bad students. A great deal of
this relates directly to an individual's
interest in teaching well (or learning
well). If a student sees a TA position as
just one more requirement to complete
in order to obtain a Ph.D., it is unlikely
that his or her performance as a TA
would be wonderful.
Happily, it has been my experience
that most graduate students in chem
istry are eager to do a good job teaching,
and that many regard teaching as the
most rewarding part of their routine. We
remember how important good teachers
were to us as undergraduates and are
anxious to help make our classes positive
experiences for our students. None of us
seeks to make them traumatic.
Most TAs did not begin their careers
in chemistry at Stanford, so it is true
that few of us have taken specific under
graduate courses here. However, this is
not generally a problem, since at the
beginning of the term the professor
meets with the TAs to brief them on
course content, grading procedures and
other relevant issues. The fact that a TA
has completed the course material in a
different form is often beneficial, rather

than detrimental, to his or her teaching:
The TA is familiar with different ways of
explaining a concept, with different real
life examples, with different texts to pro
vide supplementary readings or prob
lems.
The goal is to give the student a good
feel for principles in organic chemistry
rather than to teach precisely the mate
rial covered on the final exam for Chem
istry 33. We try to impart a broader
understanding as well.
Most TAs take their responsibilities
very seriously. Many attend all class
meetings, and most who don't only miss
lectures on occasion. In general, office
hours are geared to the needs of the stu
dents; the TA will make sure his or her
hours are acceptable both in times
offered and in duration with his or her
students.
Many will adjust hours to meet stu
dent requests and offer additional hours
prior to exams. Laboratory TAs devote
additional time before lab meetings
familiarizing themselves with equip
ment, reagents and safety procedures.
Several of us have actually performed
the labs ahead of time ourselves to ascer
tain the length of experiments and what
problems are most likely to arise. In gen
eral, TAs put in a lot more hours in real
life than they do on paper.
