Cardinal 7

Golden Bears 2

Although this week's edition did not provide the
same offensive fireworks as the game last week in
Berkeley, the Cardinal was still able to return to
winning form. Behind the strong pitching of Jamie
Sepeda, Stanford posted a 7-2 victory at Sunken
Diamond.
Yesterday's contest seemingly picked up where
last week's left off. The first three Cal batters were
retired in order in the top of the first. In the bottom
of the first, Bear pitcher Brad Brown (brother of
Nate, who walked the first four Stanford batters last
week and was sent to an early shower) hit third base
man David Holbrook with a pitch.
After designated hitter David Cornell popped out
to left, first baseman David McCarty singled up the
middle, moving Holbrook to third. Center fielder Jef
frey Hammonds was then walked to load the bases,
and Holbrook dashed home to score when Brown
threw a wild pitch to Steve Solomon. Brown got out
of the jam, though, because Solomon popped out to
third, and Ryan Turner grounded out to second to

end the inning.
Both teams went scoreless in the second inning.
In the top of the third, Cal evened the score at one
apiece. Shortstop Chris Clapinski opened the inning
by walking on four pitches, and later moved to sec
ond on a wild pitch by Sepeda. Jon Zuber walked to
put runners on first and second with two outs. Then
the Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division's lead
ing hitter, Matt Luke, hit a hard single down the
right field line to score Clapinski. Mike Harrison
then struck out to end Cal's half of the inning.
Stanford came up empty in the bottom half of the
third, as did Cal in the top half of the fourth.
In the bottom of the fourth inning, the Cardinal
put more runs on the board. Hammonds started it
off with a base hit to center field and then promptly
stole second base. He moved to third on Solomon's
fly out to right field. Left fielder Ryan Turner
cranked a home run to left field, his fourth of the
season. Roger Burnett and Chris Kemper were
unsuccessful in their at-bats. The Cardinal's offen-

sive damage for the inning stood
at two runs.
The fifth, sixth, and seventh
innings produced no scoring, as
the game progressed as a
pitcher's duel. Cal also chalked up
a goose egg in the top of the
eighth inning. In the bottom of
the eighth, the Cardinal increased
their two-run margin to seal the
victory. McCarty started it off by
slapping a base hit between short
and third. Hammonds then laid
down a bunt on the third base
side which fell for an infield hit.
Solomon then bunted towards
first as a sacrifice to move the
runners to second and third.
Turner was intentionally walked
to load the bases, and Roger Bur
nett made Brown pay for it. He
hit a double that was just fair

down the left field line, which
cleared the bases, scoring three.
In the process, Burnett took a
wide turn as he rounded second.
The left fielder Reid Neumann
threw to second, where right
fielder Luke was covering. Bur
nett beat the throw, but shoving
between both players ensued,
causing both benches to clear.
The coaches restrained their play
ers from what would have been a
bench-clearing brawl.
That was it for Brown. Matt
Toomey came in to pitch. Kemper
hit a shot to first, reaching base
on an error by first baseman
Zuber, allowing Burnett to score.
Tallman and pinch hitter Mark
Skeels fouled and struck out,
respectively. Stanford ended the
inning chalking up four runs on
three hits with one Cal error.
Coach Mark Marquess felt that
Burnett's hit was the clincher. "I
think that [the hit] gave us a
cushion," he said. "Burnett's

three-run double in the bottom of
the eighth was really the turning
point.. . because before that it
was a two run lead and with Cal
that's not enough."
Troy Penix hit a solo home run
to lead off the ninth for Cal, but
that was all that the Bears could
muster. Their next three batters
failed to get aboard, and Stanford
posted a five-run victory.
Pitcher Jamie Sepeda went
the distance, pitching the first
complete game of his career. The
sophomore hurler gave up only
six hits and struck out six batters
to improve his record to 5-1 on
the season. He commented, "I
had good control throughout the
game, [andJ I had confidence in
my stuff."
Coach Marquess said of
Sepeda's complete game, "I
thought it was fantastic â€” a com
plete game against one of the best
hitting teams in the conference."
With the victory, the Cardi

nal's record improved to 11-4 in
the Six-Pac, 27-11 overall. Stan
ford has won seven of its last
eight games, and is ranked No. 3
by Baseball America and No. 6 by

Cardinal get another chance to
improve their overall mark when
they entertain St. Mary's today

week and was sent to an early shower) hit third base
man David Holbrook with a pitch.
After designated hitter David Cornell popped out
to left, first baseman David McCarty singled up the
middle, moving Holbrook to third. Center fielder Jef
frey Hammonds was then walked to load the bases,
and Holbrook dashed home to score when Brown
threw a wild pitch to Steve Solomon. Brown got out
of the jam, though, because Solomon popped out to
third, and Ryan Turner grounded out to second to

end the inning.
Both teams went scoreless in the second inning.
In the top of the third, Cal evened the score at one
apiece. Shortstop Chris Clapinski opened the inning
by walking on four pitches, and later moved to sec

put runners on first and second with two outs. Then
the Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division's lead
ing hitter, Matt Luke, hit a hard single down the
right field line to score Clapinski. Mike Harrison
then struck out to end Cal's half of the inning.
Stanford came up empty in the bottom half of the
third, as did Cal in the top half of the fourth.
In the bottom of the fourth inning, the Cardinal
put more runs on the board. Hammonds started it
off with a base hit to center field and then promptly
stole second base. He moved to third on Solomon's
fly out to right field. Left fielder Ryan Turner
cranked a home run to left field, his fourth of the
season. Roger Burnett and Chris Kemper were
unsuccessful in their at-bats. The Cardinal's offen-

sive damage for the inning stood
at two runs.
The fifth, sixth, and seventh
innings produced no scoring, as
the game progressed as a
pitcher's duel. Cal also chalked up
a goose egg in the top of the
eighth inning. In the bottom of
the eighth, the Cardinal increased
their two-run margin to seal the
victory. McCarty started it off by
slapping a base hit between short
and third. Hammonds then laid

side which fell for an infield hit.

That was it for Brown. Matt

Tallman and pinch hitter Mark
Skeels fouled and struck out,
respectively. Stanford ended the
inning chalking up four runs on
three hits with one Cal error.
Coach Mark Marquess felt that
Burnett's hit was the clincher. "I
think that [the hit] gave us a
cushion," he said. "Burnett's

three-run double in the bottom of
the eighth was really the turning
point.. . because before that it
was a two run lead and with Cal
that's not enough."
Troy Penix hit a solo home run
to lead off the ninth for Cal, but
that was all that the Bears could
muster. Their next three batters
failed to get aboard, and Stanford
posted a five-run victory.
Pitcher Jamie Sepeda went
the distance, pitching the first
complete game of his career. The
sophomore hurler gave up only
six hits and struck out six batters
to improve his record to 5-1 on
the season. He commented, "I
had good control throughout the
game, [andJ I had confidence in
my stuff."
Coach Marquess said of
Sepeda's complete game, "I
thought it was fantastic â€” a com

hitting teams in the conference."
With the victory, the Cardi

Cardinal 7

Golden Bears 2

Although this week's edition did not provide the
same offensive fireworks as the game last week in
Berkeley, the Cardinal was still able to return to
winning form. Behind the strong pitching of Jamie
Sepeda, Stanford posted a 7-2 victory at Sunken
Diamond.
Yesterday's contest seemingly picked up where
last week's left off. The first three Cal batters were
retired in order in the top of the first. In the bottom
of the first, Bear pitcher Brad Brown (brother of
Nate, who walked the first four Stanford batters last
week and was sent to an early shower) hit third base
man David Holbrook with a pitch.
After designated hitter David Cornell popped out
to left, first baseman David McCarty singled up the
middle, moving Holbrook to third. Center fielder Jef
frey Hammonds was then walked to load the bases,
and Holbrook dashed home to score when Brown
threw a wild pitch to Steve Solomon. Brown got out
of the jam, though, because Solomon popped out to
third, and Ryan Turner grounded out to second to

end the inning.
