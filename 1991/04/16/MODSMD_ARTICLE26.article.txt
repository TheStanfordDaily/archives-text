Stanford would like nothing more than to play
California every Monday. For the second consecutive
week, the Golden Bear/Monday combo was a victori
ous order cooked to perfection.

Cardinal 7

Golden Bears 2

Although this week's edition did not provide the
same offensive fireworks as the game last week in
Berkeley, the Cardinal was still able to return to
winning form. Behind the strong pitching of Jamie
Sepeda, Stanford posted a 7-2 victory at Sunken
Diamond.
Yesterday's contest seemingly picked up where
last week's left off. The first three Cal batters were
retired in order in the top of the first. In the bottom
of the first, Bear pitcher Brad Brown (brother of
Nate, who walked the first four Stanford batters last
week and was sent to an early shower) hit third base
man David Holbrook with a pitch.
After designated hitter David Cornell popped out
to left, first baseman David McCarty singled up the
middle, moving Holbrook to third. Center fielder Jef

and Holbrook dashed home to score when Brown
threw a wild pitch to Steve Solomon. Brown got out
of the jam, though, because Solomon popped out to
third, and Ryan Turner grounded out to second to

end the inning.
Both teams went scoreless in the second inning.
In the top of the third, Cal evened the score at one

by walking on four pitches, and later moved to sec

put runners on first and second with two outs. Then
the Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division's lead
ing hitter, Matt Luke, hit a hard single down the
right field line to score Clapinski. Mike Harrison
then struck out to end Cal's half of the inning.
Stanford came up empty in the bottom half of the
third, as did Cal in the top half of the fourth.
In the bottom of the fourth inning, the Cardinal
put more runs on the board. Hammonds started it
off with a base hit to center field and then promptly
stole second base. He moved to third on Solomon's
fly out to right field. Left fielder Ryan Turner
cranked a home run to left field, his fourth of the
season. Roger Burnett and Chris Kemper were
unsuccessful in their at-bats. The Cardinal's offen-
