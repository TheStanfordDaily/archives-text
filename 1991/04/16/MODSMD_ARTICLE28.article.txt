It's time. You can feel something weird in
the air, can't you? No, no, not the Pro
Fro's; I'm talking about something that
doesn't happen very often.
Yes, there's something just a bit different
about this upcoming sports week at Stanford,
and, if you've been here long enough to
remember that Lagunita always used to be
filled during spring quarter, you've probably
been waiting quite awhile for it to happen:

The men's tennis team needs our help.
Stop laughing! I'm serious.
I know, I know: How could the three-time
defending national champions need our help?
After all, this is a team that lost only one sin
gles starter from last year and replaced him
with five of the top 10 freshmen in the country.
Must be tough, right?
Well, this week it is tough. Just hear me out.
This weekend at the Stanford Tennis Sta
dium, No. 1 USC and No. 2 UCLA — both of
whom beat the Cardinal two weeks ago in I„A
— will be on hand in what will be the biggest
regular-season matches of the year for Stan
ford. Two wins for the Cardinal, which is 15-4
(2-3 in the Pac-10), and the team has a lot of
momentum heading into the last weeks before
the NCAA tournament.
Two losses and, well. . . let's not talk about
it.
Stanford has obviously been in this position
before: In 1989, the Cardinal played (to be
polite) like a bunch of wimps in LA and lost to
both schools — and then destroyed them both
