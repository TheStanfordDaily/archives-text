It's time. You can feel something weird in
the air, can't you? No, no, not the Pro
Fro's; I'm talking about something that
doesn't happen very often.
Yes, there's something just a bit different
about this upcoming sports week at Stanford,
and, if you've been here long enough to
remember that Lagunita always used to be
filled during spring quarter, you've probably
been waiting quite awhile for it to happen:

The men's tennis team needs our help.
Stop laughing! I'm serious.
I know, I know: How could the three-time
defending national champions need our help?
After all, this is a team that lost only one sin
gles starter from last year and replaced him
with five of the top 10 freshmen in the country.
Must be tough, right?
Well, this week it is tough. Just hear me out.
This weekend at the Stanford Tennis Sta
dium, No. 1 USC and No. 2 UCLA — both of
whom beat the Cardinal two weeks ago in I„A
— will be on hand in what will be the biggest
regular-season matches of the year for Stan
ford. Two wins for the Cardinal, which is 15-4
(2-3 in the Pac-10), and the team has a lot of
momentum heading into the last weeks before
the NCAA tournament.
Two losses and, well. . . let's not talk about
it.
Stanford has obviously been in this position
before: In 1989, the Cardinal played (to be
polite) like a bunch of wimps in LA and lost to
both schools — and then destroyed them both

two weeks later, went on a 13-
match winning streak and won
the NCAA title.
In 1990, an injury-plagued
Cardinal lost two not-very-close
matches in LA . . . and didn't lose
again. Three-peat.
And so, in 1991, the Cardinal
(obviously) lost twice two weeks
ago in LA — a blowout by the Bru
ins and a looong, hotly-contested
5-4 win by the Trojans. So why
worry?
Well, the team followed up
those losses with an ugly 5-4 loss
to Cal last Tuesday. During that
three-match skid Stanford's 4, 5
and 6 players were 1-8. Yuck.
The big picture is that the team
looks shakier right now than it
has in several years. Of course,
it's all relative — this is, after all,
one of the best four or five teams
in the country (at least), and most
teams would love to have the
"trouble" that the Cardinal does.
Stanford always seems to get
itself motivated at the right times,
but this time — believe it or not —
they might need some help.
It's time to get into a few peo
ple's kitchens.
In case you haven't heard the
phrase (and if not, where the
heck have you been?), "get

into his kitchen" is a loose
euphemism for "mess with his
head," or "harass," or "p— him
off," or (my personal favorite)
"make his life a living, breathing
hell and reduce him to a blubber
ing pile of protoplasm."
Conversely, "Get out of his
kitchen, ref!" is the phrase of
choice when a referee is lecturing
a player and you want to tell the
zebra to get off the players' back.
Rarely used. And, in fact, "getting
into the kitchen" isn't said as
much as it's done.
The task is clear. If the tennis
team is going to win this weekend,
it's going to take a huge, rowdy,
kitchen-invading crowd to do it.
No, not an abusive crowd; leave
your favorite names at home and
for Pete's sake don't yell during
points. Oh, but in between. . .
Yes, I know what you're think
ing: Home-court advantage? For
tennis? Get real.
Fine. If you don't think the
crowd can do anything to affect a
tennis match, you've obviously
been going to the wrong matches.
And so, here are two prime exam
ples of how fans can either (1)
destroy a player mentally, and (2)
make a team play better than it
really should.
April 21, 1989 Stanford hosts
USC two weeks after the Trojans
gutted out a 5-4 win in LA This
time around, Stanford races to a 4-
1 lead with only the Barry

Richards-Murphy Jensen No. 6
match left. Unfortunately for
Stanford, Richards has spotted
Jensen a 7-5, 4-0 lead. Forget it,
right?

It's time to get into
a few people's
kitchens.

Huh-uh. Spurred on by the
bleacher crew (the stands by
Court No. 6 were labelled "Biu's
Bleachers" in honor of Richards),
the Stanford junior starts to climb
back. Two breaks and it's four-all,
Richards' fans are working
Jensen like there's no tomorrow,
"and once I got to four-all, I felt
there was no way I could lose,"
Richards would say later.
He was right. Jensen is
reduced to a cautious, whimper
ing pile of mush and Richards
takes 12 of the last 14 games to
win, 5-7, 6-4, 6-2. "The crowd
helped a lot," says Richards, who
— thanks in part to great crowd
support throughout the year —
would finish the regular season
18-2.
May 20-22,1989 At the NCAA
championships in Athens, Ga.,

the Georgia team enters the tour
ney ranked eighth in the country.
The ranking might have been fair
for neutral courts — but not for
here.
Four thousand Dawg fans show
up each day to woof their team
into the finals against Stanford.
Two of the Dawgs' three victories
come against teams ranked higher
than they are. All three wins are
decided during singles play. That
would be 5-1, 5-0 and 5-1, y'all can
go home now.
Of course, Stanford ignores the
crowd during the finals and takes
the title 5-2, but what on earth
was Georgia doing there in the
first place? If you'd heard the
woofing, you'd know why. Coach
Dick Gould said afterward that
Georgia always has a fair crowd,
but they sure know how to make
their presence felt.
So come watch this weekend:
USC at 1:00 p.m. Friday, UCLA at
1:30 p.m. Saturday. Catch a few
rays, yell a lot, and, whenever a
Trojan or Bruin player looks like
he might be on the ropes . . . get in
his kitchen, raid his fridge, drink
his beer and leave a huge mess for
him to clean up.
