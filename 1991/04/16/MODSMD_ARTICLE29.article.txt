# Turbow's seen it all

### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
Senior co-captain Dan Turbow
has been around the block (or the
court) a few times. "It's kind of a
cliche thing to say, but it's true,"
Turbow said.
In his four years at Stanford,
he has seen almost everything at
Stanford Tennis Stadium. He's
seen some of the greatest tennis
players in the world and some of
the biggest egos as well. He's seen
some gutty performances and
some not-so-gutty performances.
One of the only things he hasn't
seen is a championship-less men's
tennis team, attested by the three
NCAA championship rings he
owns.
Through it all, though, Turbow
has never let the pressure of top
level collegiate tennis get in the
way of his good time or nis sense
of humor. "In the last few years,
my attitude has improved steadily.
Playing for Stanford is a once in a
lifetime experience, and it would
be a shame if you didn't enjoy
every minute of it,"he said.
According to Turbow, this atti
tude is a reflection of his moving
in and out of the starting lineup.
"I went through a period (last
year) where I was playing a lot
and then not playing at all. When
I finally got back into the lineup, I
was so happy to be out there, and
I found myself playing looser and
playing better. You don't play as
well when you're too worried
about winning or losing."
Turbow, or "Turby" as he is
affectionately referred to by his
teammates, has mainly been a
doubles specialist in his four years
at Stanford. His big serve, solid
returning game and smart court
sense make him a natural at dou
bles.
"Dan understands the game of
doubles," partner Jared Palmer
said. "He knows when to close the
net, when to lob — all the crucial

factors for good doubles play. He
also knows how to keep his game
under control. He doesn't always
hit the big shot, but (instead) he
hits the right shot, the shot that
will win the point."
But Turbow's main role, espe
cially this year as one of the team
captains, has been that of a team
leader. "I don't have as much tal
ent as some of these younger guys,
but I've been around. I've seen a
lot of tennis, and I've studied a lot
of tennis. I just try to help the
other guys in any way I can," he
said.
"I've spent four years with
Turby, and I've seen the guy when
things have been going well and
when things haven't been going so
well. But the one thing you can
say about Dan is that he's always
there for the team. He's always
letting guys know if he sees some
thing wrong with their game. He's
just an unselfish guy, and that's
why everybody on the team loves
him," the other team captain,
Glenn Solomon, said.

Teammates and coaches alike have praised senior doubles specialist Dan Turbow for
his selflessness in helping the Cardinal to three NCAA titles. He gets mixed reviews
on his golf game, however.
minute, but never with a com
plaint. "We've kind of put Dan in a
difficult position. When another
guy gets injured, we ask him to
come in and do the job. But he's
always eager to do it," asst. coach
John Whitlinger said. "He's the
type of guy you wish you had more
of. You wish all your players were
like him."
Despite the team's recent
three-match losing streak, Tur
bow said the team still has a good
shot at winning a fourth consecu
tive national title. "We're more
than capable of winning (another
title), and we're doing the right
things to get back on track. We're
starting to play with more zeal,"
Turbow said. "The secret is play
ing close to our potential at the
right time. If we can do that, we
can win another one."
But Turbow admits that win
ning another national title is not
going to be easy. "Success
wouldn't mean anything if there
wasn't a chance of failure. People
expect us to win every time, but
what they don't realize is that
there are some good teams out
there. Still, if we play well, I think
we'll be in the thick of things," he
said.
Turbow, who was selected as a
1990 NCAA Academic All-Amer
ica and a Volvo Scholar-Athlete,

will attend Georgetown law school
in the fall. Until then, he plans to
play a lot of tennis — and perhaps
even more golf. "I'm just a (golf)
nut. The game has engrossed my
psyche," Tubow said. "Tennis is
still my No. 1 priority, but golf. . .1
just love the game."
Turbow, who presently is tak
ing the advanced golf class with
teammate Jason Yee, says he tries
to get out on the course about
three times a week. He admits
Palmer is still the team's best
linkster, but that hasn't discour
aged him. "I shoot in the 90s, but
I'm getting better. I'm starting to
really feel the ball."
Still, some of Turbow's team
mates have doubts. "Sure, he's a
hell of a golfer — in his own
mind," Solomon said.
Golf jokes aside, Turbow is
looking forward to this weekend's
matches against UCLA and USC,
both of which beat Stanford ear
lier in the year. "The main ques
tions (this weekend) are going to
be whether we can play to our
potential and whether or not we
can come through in the 5-4
matches," he said. "Of course, we
can't overlook Utah [today]."
In the meantime, Turbow
would like nothing more thafi to
add a fourth ring to his growing
collection. And you can bet, he'll
do whatever it takes to help the
team accomplish just that, even if
it means missing a tee time or
two.
