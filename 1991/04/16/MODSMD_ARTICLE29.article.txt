# Turbow's seen it all

### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
Senior co-captain Dan Turbow
has been around the block (or the
court) a few times. "It's kind of a
cliche thing to say, but it's true,"
Turbow said.
In his four years at Stanford,
he has seen almost everything at
Stanford Tennis Stadium. He's
seen some of the greatest tennis
players in the world and some of
the biggest egos as well. He's seen
some gutty performances and
some not-so-gutty performances.
One of the only things he hasn't
seen is a championship-less men's
tennis team, attested by the three
NCAA championship rings he
owns.
Through it all, though, Turbow
has never let the pressure of top
level collegiate tennis get in the
way of his good time or nis sense
of humor. "In the last few years,
my attitude has improved steadily.
Playing for Stanford is a once in a
lifetime experience, and it would
be a shame if you didn't enjoy
every minute of it,"he said.
According to Turbow, this atti
tude is a reflection of his moving
in and out of the starting lineup.
"I went through a period (last
year) where I was playing a lot
and then not playing at all. When
I finally got back into the lineup, I
was so happy to be out there, and
I found myself playing looser and
playing better. You don't play as
well when you're too worried
about winning or losing."
Turbow, or "Turby" as he is
affectionately referred to by his
teammates, has mainly been a
doubles specialist in his four years
at Stanford. His big serve, solid
returning game and smart court
sense make him a natural at dou
bles.
"Dan understands the game of
doubles," partner Jared Palmer
said. "He knows when to close the
net, when to lob â€” all the crucial

factors for good doubles play. He
also knows how to keep his game
under control. He doesn't always
hit the big shot, but (instead) he
hits the right shot, the shot that
will win the point."
But Turbow's main role, espe
cially this year as one of the team
captains, has been that of a team
leader. "I don't have as much tal
ent as some of these younger guys,
but I've been around. I've seen a
lot of tennis, and I've studied a lot
of tennis. I just try to help the
other guys in any way I can," he
said.
"I've spent four years with
Turby, and I've seen the guy when
things have been going well and
when things haven't been going so
well. But the one thing you can
say about Dan is that he's always
there for the team. He's always
letting guys know if he sees some
thing wrong with their game. He's
just an unselfish guy, and that's
why everybody on the team loves
him," the other team captain,
Glenn Solomon, said.
Turbow often has been asked
to step into the lineup at the last

Teammates and coaches alike have praised senior doubles specialist Dan Turbow for
his selflessness in helping the Cardinal to three NCAA titles. He gets mixed reviews
on his golf game, however.
