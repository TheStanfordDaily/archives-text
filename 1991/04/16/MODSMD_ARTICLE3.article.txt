# Mexican leader may speak at Centennial gala
## 
### David Bianco Editorial staff 
Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari will
be one of three world figures to speak at this fall's
grand finale to the six-year Centennial Celebration,
if planners' hopes are realized.
"That's what we're hoping, but we haven't heard
anything from him yet," said Susan Wolfe, assistant
director of the Centennial Celebration. She said Sali
nas was invited within the last month to speak at
one of three "convocations" planned to take place in
the Oval on the mornings of Sept. 29 and 30 and Oct.
1.
Wolfe's said she hopes that Salinas will give her
office more than the one month notice that is cus
tomary for world leaders.
"One of the toughest issues about inviting a head
of state to speak at a function like this is that we
anticipate thousands of alumni from around the
world will be coming back, yet heads of state gener
ally don't make their commitments until 30 days in
advance. So that makes our job really hard," she
said.
Registration materials for the event will be
mailed to alumni at the end of next month, and
Wolfe said she fears she won't be able to advertise
big-name speakers such as Salinas without confir
mation.
Salinas has "an established linkage" to Stanford,
because he spoke at a gathering of
alumni in Mexico City last Febru
ary, Wolfe said. She would not
comment on which other heads of
state had been invited to speak.
One of Salinas' top advisers
came under fire in late 1989 when
he claimed in his resume to have a
doctorate in economics from
Stanford when he in fact did not.
Jose Maria C6rdoba Montoya, a
principal economic adviser to
Salinas, was a student here in the
late 1970s and did present a dis
sertation which was approved by
the faculty, but he did not submit
it in the proper format or pay the
necessary fees, so he never
received his doctorate.
The three keynote speeches
are a central aspect of the "Grand
Finale Weekend." Wolfe said her
office had considered locations
such as Frost Amphitheater and
the Inner Quad, but had elimi
nated those locations because nei
ther can hold more than 10,000
people, and planners hope to
attract that many alumni alone.
"It's strictly a space considera
tion," she said.
Wolfe said she thought at least
20,000 people could attend a
speech in the Oval. "Obviously if
we get the kind of people we're
hoping for there will be registra
tion and security procedures,"
she said, but she emphasized the
addresses will be open to stu
dents, faculty and staff as well as
alumni.
The Centennial Celebration

concludes Oct. 1, the day Stan
ford opened 100 years ago. In
addition to the three keynote
addresses, the weekend will
include a performing arts festival,
100 classes open to alumni so
they can "go back to school,"
panel discussions led by national
figures and a "Stadium Spectacu
lar" Monday, Sept. 30 including
headline entertainers and multi
media presentations of Stanford
history."

'There will be regis
tration and security
procedures,' but the
addresses will be
open to students.

The Centennial Celebration,
which is separate from the fund
raising Centennial Campaign,
began with a quiet ceremony in
Memorial Church in 1985 to cele
brate the 100 th anniversary of
the University's founding. Two
years later, then-Secretary of
State George Shultz joined the
secretaries of state of Mexico and
Canada to mark the 100 th
anniversary of the laying of the
cornerstone of the Quad.
Since then, Centennial events
have taken place in London, Mex
ico City, Toronto and Hong Kong.
This year's events at Stanford
have included three large-scale
Centennial Symposia — the third
of which took place last weekend
— and an enhanced Founders'
Day commemoration in conjunc
tion with Parents' Weekend.
