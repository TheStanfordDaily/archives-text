Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari will
be one of three world figures to speak at this fall's
grand finale to the six-year Centennial Celebration,
if planners' hopes are realized.
"That's what we're hoping, but we haven't heard
anything from him yet," said Susan Wolfe, assistant
director of the Centennial Celebration. She said Sali
nas was invited within the last month to speak at
one of three "convocations" planned to take place in
the Oval on the mornings of Sept. 29 and 30 and Oct.
1.
Wolfe's said she hopes that Salinas will give her
office more than the one month notice that is cus

"One of the toughest issues about inviting a head
of state to speak at a function like this is that we
anticipate thousands of alumni from around the
world will be coming back, yet heads of state gener
ally don't make their commitments until 30 days in
advance. So that makes our job really hard," she
said.
Registration materials for the event will be
mailed to alumni at the end of next month, and
Wolfe said she fears she won't be able to advertise
big-name speakers such as Salinas without confir
mation.
Salinas has "an established linkage" to Stanford,
