# Women sign top class
## 
### David Hirning Senior staff writer 
As the Cardinal women's bas
ketball team found out in the
NCAA tournament a fortnight
ago, you win some and you lose
some.
After improbably reaching the
Final Four and only to lose in the
semifinals to eventual champion
Tennessee, Stanford experienced
the same mixed feelings back
home when the late recruiting
returns came in. The Cardinal will
have to settle for just one of the
two highly-touted prep point
guards it was wooing.
Last Thursday, it was the bad
news. High school All-American
Markita Aldridge of Detroit chose
UNC Charlotte over a full ride at
Stanford.
Yesterday, Cardinal coach Tara
VanDerveer got a phone call that
brought a different kind of news,
as five-foot-nine Berkeley High
star Tanda Rucker called across
the Bay to RSVP her spot on next
year's Stanford squad.
Stanford officials expect to
make things official today when
they receive Rucker's letter of
intent, which she mailed yester
day.
"It was a hard decision," said
Rucker, who was also considering
USC and Virginia. "I wanted to
stay in the Pac-10, and it came
down to the academics. I'm look

ing at the long run, because we
don't have the NBA (option)."
"Tanda passes the ball very
well," said VanDerveer, who hopes
Rucker can help replace All-Amer
ican Sonja Henning at the point
guard position next year. "She's
very unselfish, and sets people
up."
Comparing Rucker with
Aldridge, VanDerveer noted,
"Tanda shoots the three-point
shot better than Markita, but
she's not as big."
While expressing regret for the
loss of Aldridge, VanDerveer was
optimistic about her recruiting
class, which boasts three players
named to the USA Today Top 25.
In addition to Rucker, 6-5 Anita
Kaplan and 5-11 Bobbie Kelsey,
both of whom signed in the fall,
also made the all-star list.
"Anita is a big, big sign for our
program," VanDerveer said.
"She's big. If she works hard, look
out."
Kelsey is a very athletic,
aggressive forward from Decatur,
Georgia, who had surgery for a
torn anterior cruciate ligament in
January. Joining her to round out
the four-person class is 6-3 Rachel
Hemmer from Austin, Texas.
"It's a great recruiting class,
and it joins a really solid nucleus,"
VanDerveer said. "We have four
solid players coming in, and there
is potential for some others to
walk-on."
