# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
Distractions aplenty affected us all over
the past week:
• Major league baseball had its opening
day, bringing the national pastime back to us
for the next seven months;
• The deadline for filing income tax
returns passed yesterday, making the three
most notorious letters in the English lan
guage I, Rand S; and
• New York's Rangers were eliminated

from the Stanley Cup playoffs, assuring, for
the 51st year in a row, that they won't win
hockey's most coveted prize.
But two athletes brushed that all aside
over the weekend, allowing themselves to
capture The Daily's Athletes of the Week
awards. The winners are Debbie Graham
of women's tennis and David McCarty of
baseball.
Graham, a 6-foot-1 junior from Fountain
Valley, Calif., won singles and doubles
matches Sunday as the Cardinal routed
cross-Bay rival California 7-2.
In her singles match, Graham was play
ing the Bears' Emilie Viqueira and had
revenge on her mind. Viqueira had ended
Graham's remarkable streak of 55 consecu
tive dual-match wins when Stanford played
Cal Feb. 16. Graham's impressive run lasted
from the beginning of her college career and
extended over two-plus seasons.
Graham got her revenge as she upended
Viqueira 6-4, 6-2. The Stanford All-Ameri
can actually trailed 1-4 in the first set before
finding her groove and winning 12 of the
final 14 games.
000
McCarty, a 6-5 junior from Houston,
Texas wielded his typical big bat as the Card
nine won two of three games against Ari
zona State in Tempe.
The first baseman went 6-for-l 1 with six
runs batted in on the weekend as he contin
ued to sizzle at the plate. He is currently rid
ing a 13-game hitting streak.
Stanford opened the series in a big way,

hammering the Sun Devils 18-10 in Friday's
game. McCarty contributed to the offensive
outburst with his 13th homer of the season.
His total leads the Pacific 10 Southern Divi
sion.
But actually, the league best is 14 because
McCarty homered again Saturday as Stan
ford took game two 6-5.
