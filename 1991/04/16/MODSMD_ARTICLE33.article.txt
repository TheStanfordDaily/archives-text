# Oden wins big award
## 
### 
Sophomore middle blocker Bev
Oden continues to threaten to
overshadow her elder sister, for
mer Cardinal Kim Oden. Yester
day Bev was named the 1991
Honda-Broderick Award winner
for volleyball.
The Honda-Broderick Awards
are given to the top athlete in each
of 11 collegiate women's sports.
Of the 11 individual sport win
ners, one woman is selected as the
recipient of the Honda-Broderick
Cup. So far this year, four of the
finalists have been named.
Oden was named NCAA Player
of the Year after leading the Car
dinal in 1990 to a 27-4 season and
a No. 3 national ranking. She led
the team in kills (513), solo blocks
(41) and block assists (117), and
was second on the team in hitting
percentage (.337) and digs (298).
She is already seventh on the

career kills chart in school history,
with 891, and second (next to her
sister) in career solo blocks with
84.
Oden's sister Kim also won
both the NCAA Player of the Year
title and the Honda-Broderick
Award in the same year â€” her
senior season.
Oden is the only sophomore
among the four finalists named so
far. The others are all seniors.
The first three winners were
Santa Clara's Brandi Chastain for
soccer, Temple's Jane Catanzaro
for field hockey, and Wisconsin's
Suzy Favor for cross country.
Favor won the Cup last year as the
track representative.
Stanford had three finalists in
1990. They were Jennifer Azzi
(basketball), Janet Evans (swim
ming) and Debbie Graham (ten
nis).
