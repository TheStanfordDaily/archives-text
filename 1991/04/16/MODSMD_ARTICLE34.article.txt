Error allows Princeton students to
make free long-distance calls
A programming error in Princeton Univer
sity's telecommunications system has allowed
callers to dial numbers with area codes beginning
with the number six free of charge since the
beginning of the school year.
While most students and faculty members did
not know about the glitch, those who did could
make free phone calls to places such as Missis
sippi, Boston and parts of Michigan.
Officials recently learned of the error, and
technicians fixed it.
Although the telecommunications officials
cannot determine who made the calls, they do
have lists of the phone numbers of the recipients
of these calls.
A unidentified senior apparently found the
glitch when placing a call to the 617 area code.
The discovery of the system loophole was soon
spread by word of mouth, according to students
who wished to remain anonymous for fear of
being charged for the calls.
"I'm really surprised that something like that
could happen," said freshman Chris Borowski,
who lives in New Hampshire's 603 area code. "I
wish I'd known about it earlier."

Students ride experimental tram
Students attending the University of Texas at
Austin can now get to class using the school's new
propane-powered shuttle service.
Called Metram, the free service runs every 10
to 15 minutes, circling the inner campus of the
university. Traveling at five to eight miles per
hour, the tram pulls a car which holds up to 48
people.
The shuttle service is an eight-week experi
ment testing both the use of propane as an alter
native fuel and the popularity of such transporta
tion among students, according to Jerry DeCamp,
assistant vice president for business affairs.
Capital Metro, the bus company which pro
vides the trams, also finances the $150,000 vehi
cles. While the company provides shuttle drivers
and fuel, the university stores the trams and pro
vides basic maintenance, DeCamp said.
Gloria Stevens, public affairs specialist for
Capital Metro, said propane burns more cleanly

than gasoline, adding that the fuel is "readily
available."
Stevens said she hopes the service will "expand
mobility options in a way that can be fun for those
who use the service, and at the same time reduce
emissions and improve air quality."
The success of the trams will be measured
using criteria including customer satisfaction,
efficiency of the shuttles and overall performance
of the shuttles, she said.

Cal not liable for campus rape
The victim of a gang rape at UC-Berkeley
recently lost a court case which would have made
the university liable for failing to prevent the
September 1986 attack.
The State Court of Appeals in San Francisco
upheld the decision of the Alameda County Supe
rior Court, which found that "a university is not
liable as an insurer for the crimes of its students."
The victim, known as Tanja Isabel H., was a
17-year-old freshman when she was allegedly
raped by four UC-Berkeley foptball players, all of
whom had been drinking alcohol. The incident
took place in a dormitory stairwell and the rooms
of two of the assailants.
Justice John Kline said the university is not
legally responsible to protect its students from
harm "simply because it adopted a policy forbid
ding the consumption of alcohol in its dormitories
and took some uneven action to enforce that pol
icy."
Claiming that school officials violated assur
ances about the safety of the dormitories, the vic
tim filed a lawsuit against the school and her
attackers one year after the incident.
Her lawyer, Pauline Tesler of San Francisco,
argued that the school has the duty to protect stu
dents in dormitories, as studies have connected
fraternity members and football players to gang
rapes.
This case, the first ever to argue such a theory
of university responsibility, can be appealed to the
state Supreme Court, according to university
spokesperson Ray Colvig.
Though the alleged attackers have never been
brought to criminal trial, the victim has a legal
suit for damages still pending.
