# Disabled encouraged to be RAs
## 
### Joanna Sosinska Staff writer 
Approximately 350 students
applied for resident assistant posi
tions this year, but among them
there is only one disabled appli
cant.
Since there are currently no
disabled RAs at Stanford, the
Office of Residential Education
and the Disability Resource Cen
ter had tried to encourage more
disabled students to apply for the
highly competitive positions.
According to Molly Sandperl,
acting director of the Disability
Resource Center, although there
have been disabled applicants,
there have not been any disabled
RAs in the five years she has been
at Stanford.
In an April 4 meeting, Res Ed
officials met with approximately
20 resident fellows to discuss
biases in the RA selection process,
including those related to disabili
ties, said Ann Porteus, assistant
director of Res Ed.
"We tried to get the RFs to
think the biases they might be
bringing with them to the (staff
selection) process," said Porteus.
"Disability was one of those
biases," she added. "We hope [the
RFs] will transmit the conversa
tion to their staff," said Porteus.
The main concern that RFs
have in hiring disabled RAs is the
impact of the disability on the
RA's job, Sandperl said. But this
concern can lead to invalidated
discrimination, she added.
Mark Breimhorst, a junior who
has no hands, said disabled RAs
should be hired because "the dis
abled study people on a day-to-day
basis more carefully out of neces

sity." This makes them very sensi
tive to the needs of the residents,
he said.
"Disabled people assess each
person as that person. They stress
individuality," said John Miller, a
blind coterminal student. Because
they face discrimination and have
contact with people who do not
know how to approach them, dis
abled people often become more
accepting, he said.
Miller added that disabled peo
ple are forming a "disability cul
ture" that helps them deal with
difficult issues. "Disability culture
is a sense of similarity among us
that is positive despite any nega
tive stigma which society may
impose upon us illegitimately."
Breimhorst is concerned with
discrimination by RFs and cur
rent RAs on the basis of his dis
ability. "I heard stories of discrim
ination that concern me. Since I
am applying (to be an RA), I didn't
want this to happen to me," said
Breimhorst.
"It's against the law to discrim
inate on the basis of disability. We
need to look at the job description
and ask what elements are essen
tial for the job," Sandperl said.
There are 120 disabled stu
dents at Stanford, about 1 percent
of the student population. Hous
ing is not a problem for most of
them, but climbing stairs is diffi
cult for about 20 students who
have mobility problems.
Junior Michelle Kramer, a
focus assistant at Adams House, is
currently the only disabled stu
dent in a residence staff position.
Though at first worried about her
juvenile rheumatoid arthritis,
Kramer now feels confident that
her disability has not interfered

with her job.
Instead, Kramer sees her dis
ability as a plus. "I bring my views
on disabilities to residents. It
helps my performance."
Porteus said a solution to the
problems of discrimination
against disabled students is open
discussion between RA applicants
and the RFs. "There may be limits
to what disabled people can do. We
need to truly understand why
someone can't do it, instead of
jumping to conclusions," said Por
teus.
"Most decision processes have
a subjective component. What we
have to do is broaden people's per
spective, including the RFs,' "
said Porteus. Referring to the
meeting with RFs, Porteus admit
ted that such discussions cannot
change people overnight. But she
was optimistic that it was an
important step to take.
Sandperl said, "I don't expect
that this year RFs will make any
negative hiring decisions based on
disability. But if I feel that this
does happen, I will follow up with
each RF."
She added that Res Ed and the
Disability Resource Center "want
the campus to see that disabled
students are a minority group
who suffer a great deal of discrim
ination and prejudice similar to
the students of color.
"Most people are uncomfort
able with disability so they try to
ignore or avoid it. I think it's just
that people are uninformed," said
Sandperl.
"Everybody should have an
opportunity at one of the most
educational jobs here. [Being an
RA] is a powerful leadership posi
tion," said Porteus.
