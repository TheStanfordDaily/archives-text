The non-weighted GPA of 4.18
scarcely reveals the extensive
achievements of Kiran Kang, one
of about a thousand prospective
freshmen visiting Stanford this
week. She has also founded a reli
gious organization, participated in
several teams and volunteered in
the community.
Her greatest accomplishment,
however, is the satisfaction that "I
was able to do everything," she
said.
A senior at Sequoia High
School in Redwood City, Kang's
accomplishments range from
being editor in chief of her school
paper to co-founding Young Sikhs
of America, a religious organiza
tion promoting pride and under
standing of her faith.
The valedictorian of her class
of over 300 students, Kang
excelled especially in math and
the sciences. She said she hopes to
study electrical engineering
"because it is so broad and deals
with so many areas that I would
never be limited."
One of her more time-consum
ing activities was her participa
tion in the community. Since
eighth grade she has prepared

lunches for the congregation of at
least 200 people in her temple on
Sundays.
Her participation in her reli
gion continues with her involve
ment in the Young Sikhs of Amer
ica. By sponsoring contests and
organizing events, she hopes to
increase awareness of her faith.
Last year she organized the con
struction of a float in the annual
Sikh Parade in San Francisco.
As vice-president of the Califor
nia Scholarship Federation, a
statewide honor society, she
arranged field trips to colleges and
museums. As treasurer of the
organization during her junior
year, she sold Christmas decora
tions and held bake sales to raise
money for scholarships of gradu
ating seniors who were members.
She was selected as a regional
finalist for the Seymour Award,
one out of 10 students from 200
high schools in the central region.
The selection was based on
scholastic achievement, commu
nity-service contributions and
school activities.
She raised over $3,000 to
ensure the publication of the
Sequoia Times, her school news
paper, by presenting her request
to the Sequoia Site Counsel, con
sisting of the school board, faculty

and students.
Furthermore, she has partici
pated in her school's volleyball
and badminton teams, receiving
the most-improved player award
for junior- varsity volleyball.
Of the seven schools seeking
her enrollment, Kang is consider
ing Stanford, MIT and Cornell.
Yet she says that chances of com
ing to Stanford are "very likely."
When comparing Stanford to
MIT, Kang said, "To me, the broad
academic education at Stanford is

especially attractive, while the
high-tech education at MIT is
valuable for engineers but maybe
not for undergrads."
To Kang, Stanford's location
provides the unique balance of the
comforts of home and the freedom
at school. "If I want to go home I
can and I think this is a big advan
tage." ,
But besides exhausting herself
in academic and extracurricular
activities, Kang likes to have fun.
"I love to listen to Punjabi cas
settes and to dance Punjabi folk
dances." Kang, who owns more
than 60 Punjabi cassettes, is a
participant in the annual Punjab
Night Program in which she
dances and sings to cultural
music.
Furthermore, she enjoys read
ing and playing the harmonium,
an Indian piano. Her favorite
books range from "Gone With the
Wind" to "King Lear."
Although she has visited the
campus only once before, Kang-is
impressed by the "many opportu
nities and immense diversity."
Staying in Alondra since yes
terday, Kang is convinced that she
prefers an all-freshmen dorm.
"We're all in the same boat and it
will be fun to share each other's
experiences," she said.
