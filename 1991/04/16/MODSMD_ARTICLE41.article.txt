Harvard law prof, named trustee
Charles Ogletree, a professor at Harvard Law
School since 1989 and a noted legal theorist and
television moderator, was elected to the Board of
Trustees at its meeting last week.
Ogletree was a well-known student activist
when he studied at Stanford in the 19705. He
earned his bachelor's degree in political science in
1974 and a master's in 1975. He received his law
degree from Harvard in 1978.
He was chairman of the Black Student Union,
an ASSU senator and a Council of Presidents
member. He also participated in the Committee
on Minority Affairs and the Publications Board.
"I can't imagine a more propitious time to be
joining the board," Ogletree said. "I'm very flat
tered to have been given this opportunity."
In recent years Ogletree has been active in a
number of public-service roles. He is a contributor
to the Harvard Law Review and director of the
Trial Advocacy Workshop. He has moderated tele
vision programs, including the PBS series "Ethics
in America"and "Hard Drugs, Hard Choices."
Donations solicited from faculty
The Centennial Campaign, which ends Feb. 10,
1992, is asking for donations from Stanford fac
ulty and staff.
History Prof. John Wirth, vice provost for aca
demic planning and development, reported to the
Faculty Senate April 4 that letters were being
mailed to the home addresses of about 7,800 staff
and 1,500 faculty members.
"Faculty and staff already make tremendous
contributions to Stanford in time and energy,"
Wirth said. "Any who wish to express support in
another way can make gifts for such things as the

libraries, undergraduate scholarships or graduate
fellowships, earthquake recovery, the athletics
program or their home departments."
Staff and faculty contributors can earn addi
tional money for Stanford from the Centennial
Challenge program. Peter Bing, a 1955 graduate
and one of the four Centennial Campaign co
chairs, has pledged to match the gifts of anyone
who gives at least $100 per year for three years.
Smoke bombs delay Rush parties
The last night of sorority Rush began with a
little more excitement than hoped for, when a
smoke bomb exploded in one of the eight tents.
No one was reported injured in the prank,
although a spark from one bomb ignited a small
section of the Pi Beta Phi tent. The fire was put
out with an extinguisher and firefighters were not
called to the scene.
The smoke bombs, equipped with timers set for
the beginning of last night's parties, were tied to
the cross supports of the Pi Phi, Kappa Kappa
Gamma and Delta Delta Delta sororities' tents.
Sorority members said the bombs must have been
placed in the tents during the afternoon.
After the first bomb went off in the Pi Phi tent,
sorority members frantically searched their tents
for other smoke bombs, delaying the first parties
about 15 minutes. Inactivated smoke bombs,
described by some as firecrackers, were found in
two other tents.
Few of the women found the nrank humorous.
The smoke bomb "went off and we all
screamed. Then the tent caught on fire and we all
screamed again," said sophomore Amelia Clark, a
Pi Phi.
"Now it really smells," another member added.
