# University offers 'free' trailers to groups in need
## 
### Scott McCormack Staff Writer 
It sounds like a perfect match: Old,
unwanted Manzanita Park trailers become
homes for needy families.
That's the deal the University is offering
charitable Bay Area organizations â€” take
the trailers out of the path of new construc
tion, and you can have them for free.
The trailers will be available for two
weeks in late June, before construction
begins on the two new dormitories in the
next phase of the Manzanita Park project.
But if past experience is any indication,
the cardboard- and linoleum-lined trailers
may simply end up in the junkyard.
When construction began on Kimball

Hall last summer, 20 trailers had to be
removed from the site. All were made avail
able to any worthy group that could cart
one away, but for most organizations the
costs of transporting the trailers made the
idea unfeasible. The University ended up
giving only one away.
While there are no strict eligibility
requirements, an organization has to be
reputable and "have the necessary means
and funding to take it away," said Tom
DiPressi, manager of building systems
engineering.
DiPressi said that initially the Univer
sity was inundated with requests from area
groups wanting to use them as office space.
However, because the trailers were con
structed to meet residential building codes,

"they can be used for nothing . . . but resi
dences."
Another major obstacle for groups inter
ested in the trailers is that "you just can't
plop them anywhere," DiPressi said. If an
adequate site can be found, the trailer must
then be hooked up to electricity and the
sewer system, among other things. This can
prove to be "extremely expensive," DiPressi
added.
Volunteers of America, a nonprofit orga
nization based in Oakland that runs service
programs for the homeless, is the only
group that accepted a trailer from the Kim
ball Hall site.
Ralph Appezata, the organization's
director, called it "a great deal," but added
that in order to take a trailer, "vou've got to

have resources which most nonprofit
groups simply do not have."
He said it cost his organization more
than $3,000 just to transport the trailer
from campus to the group's center in Oak
land.
In order to be transported, a trailer must
be split in half and secured on the back of a
flatbed truck.
Volunteers of America has still not deter
mined what it will do with the trailer. The
group will not use it to house a homeless
family, however, because it "would cost too
much to hook up the trailer and put a fam
ily in it," Appezata said.
Even if the group could afford to connect
the trailer, he said, real estate in
the Bay Area is simply too expen
sive to find an affordable site for
the trailer. "We were going to take
a lot of them, but land is very dear

and expensive. Finding space
proved very difficult."
Furthermore, many Bay Area
communities have strict zoning
regulations that prohibit trailer
parks, he said.
Volunteers of America hopes it
will be able to use the trailer as
part of its soup kitchen facility in
Richmond. The group is currently

trying to obtain the necessary use
permits, Appezata said. In the
meantime, the trailer remains
unoccupied.
The University plans to elimi
nate an additional 41 to 42 trail
ers during the summer. If no one
wants the trailers, they will be
stripped and destroyed.
