# ISC to include new sorority in Rush quota division
## 
### Connie Chang Editorial staff 
The Intersorority Council has decided to
count the Chi Alpha Pi sorority among the
national campus sororities in calculating
this year's Rush quota, reversing a decision
it made last week.
The ISC made its original decision
because it traditionally has excluded local
sororities in determining quota. However,
Chi Alpha Pi today becomes an official
chapter of Chi Omega, a national sorority.
The decision sets this year's quota at 29
bids per sorority. Bids will be offered to
rushees today.
ISC President Erin Scalley, a senior, said

the method of determining Rush quotas by
counting only nationally affiliated sorori
ties was designed for schools that had "con
sistent rushee drop rates." But because
Stanford sororities have more difficulty
predicting the number of rushees who will
decide to pledge each year, counting all
sororities "just made more sense," she said.
The sorority Rush quota is determined
by counting rushees after the second Rush
invitational, along with other factors, said
ISC Rush Chair Betsy Bochenek.
The effect of the decision on the quota
was unclear. By adding Chi Alpha Pi, the
quota would be found by dividing the num
ber of women participating by eight instead
of seven sororities, lowering the result.

However, Bochenek, a senior, said
including a new national sorority in the sys
tem could also have increased the number
of women who rushed, creating a larger
Rush quota.
Scalley said the decision was recom
mended by representatives of the National
Panhellenic Council, which regulates and
provides guidelines for sororities nation
wide. Members of Chi Alpha Pi asked the
council for advice after the original ISC
decision.
However, she added, the ISC did not
need the national council's approval to
change its quota-determination method.
Allison Sandy, sorority adviser for the
Office of Student Activities, said she feels

"positive about the change." She said the
ISC reversed the decision to count Chi
Alpha Pi when some sororities began to get
more information and urged more discus
sion about the issue.
She added that local sororities would not
necessarily be counted in next year's Rush.
Chi Alpha Pi President Shanie Geddes
said most members of her sorority wanted
to be counted in this year's Rush quota.
Because Chi Alpha Pi only became a
national sorority today, one day after offi
cial Rush week is over, there is no reason
for not counting it, said Geddes, a sopho
more.
Scalley said, "Everyone is
pretty excited because more
women can become part of the
system."
According to ISC regulations,
each sorority at Stanford can
have a maximum of 80 members
each year. If a sorority does not
fill its maximum after the maxi
mum number of rushees given
bids are accepted, the sorority is
allowed to hold an informal Rush

after the official Rush week until
they reach their maximum.
There is no minimum number
of members for a sorority, Geddes
said, but her sorority was
required to have 40 members
before becoming a nationally affil
iated chapter.
Geddes de-pledged from
another sorority to join Chi Alpha
Pi, a move which some sorority
members questioned.
Under ISC regulations, a
sorority member who has de
pledged from one sorority to join
another cannot Rush again until
a year after she first rushed.

But Scalley said this rule
applies only to national sororities.
In addition, a sorority member
who has de-pledged can rush
informally into another sorority
once official Rush week ends.
Geddes said her decision to de
pledge "should not cause any ten
sion because it is a personal
choice." She compared a sorority
to a house and said, "If it did not
feel like a home to you, there's no
reason for you to stay in it."
Two other women who had de
pledged to join Chi Alpha Pi with
drew their applications during
Rush week, Geddes added.
