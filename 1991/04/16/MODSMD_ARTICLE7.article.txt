# Cleaning up for fun

Rocking back and forth on a
rusty swing, Kwame Nash, a fun
consultant of sorts, eyeballs some
workers who are bringing a local
playground back to life.
"The workers are doing a good
job," the 7-year-old assessed this
weekend. "They are putting in
more stuff. More swings. More
fun. And there is even going to be
something new over there," he
said pointing to a dirt-filled plot
with four wooden posts.
When Nash, a second-grader at
the Willow Oaks Elementary
School in Menlo Park, and 450 of
his classmates returned to school
yesterday, they found a freshly
painted, unlittered playground
with a new piece trf equipment,
thanks to a concerted effort by
Stanford students, Willow Oaks
faculty and staff, and parents and
volunteers from the community.
On Friday, members of the Wil
low Oaks, Stanford and Commu
nity Renovation Project began to
clear the playground of trash,
glass and other dangerous mate
rial. Saturday was spent sanding,
priming and painting rust-speck
led equipment and weathered
fences.
The project culminated Sun
day with the installation of a new
playground addition built by
Stanford graduate students — a
cargo net supported by four posts.
The climbing structure replaces a
spiral slide which was removed
after a student fell off and was
injured.
The seeds for the renovation
project were planted last October,
when Mark Reuss, a graduate stu
dent in Stanford's Construction
Engineering and Management
Program, came up with the idea.
As an undergraduate at Tufts
University, Reuss worked on a
playground renovation for a
senior project. "I found there was
a great need for this type of work
in the Boston community," Reuss
said.
Reuss said he found a similar
need in the community surround
ing Stanford. After proposing the
idea to other members of the
Stanford chapter of the Associa
tion of General Contractors, a
national organization to which
some of the graduate students in
civil engineering belong, Reuss
contacted the superintendent's
• office of the Ravenswood School
District to see which schools
needed assistance.
"They told me Willow Oaks
was in the worst shape, and they
were eager for our help," Reuss
said.
Reuss enlisted the assistance of
community volunteer groups and
local businesses to help the
school, which is nearly 60 percent
black and 30 percent Latino. The
project was showered with dona
