# Cleaning up for fun
## 
### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Staff writer 
Rocking back and forth on a
rusty swing, Kwame Nash, a fun
consultant of sorts, eyeballs some
workers who are bringing a local
playground back to life.
"The workers are doing a good
job," the 7-year-old assessed this
weekend. "They are putting in
more stuff. More swings. More
fun. And there is even going to be
something new over there," he
said pointing to a dirt-filled plot
with four wooden posts.
When Nash, a second-grader at
the Willow Oaks Elementary
School in Menlo Park, and 450 of
his classmates returned to school
yesterday, they found a freshly
painted, unlittered playground
with a new piece trf equipment,
thanks to a concerted effort by
Stanford students, Willow Oaks
faculty and staff, and parents and
volunteers from the community.
On Friday, members of the Wil
low Oaks, Stanford and Commu
nity Renovation Project began to
clear the playground of trash,
glass and other dangerous mate
rial. Saturday was spent sanding,
priming and painting rust-speck
led equipment and weathered
fences.
The project culminated Sun
day with the installation of a new
playground addition built by
Stanford graduate students — a
cargo net supported by four posts.
The climbing structure replaces a
spiral slide which was removed
after a student fell off and was
injured.
The seeds for the renovation
project were planted last October,
when Mark Reuss, a graduate stu
dent in Stanford's Construction
Engineering and Management
Program, came up with the idea.
As an undergraduate at Tufts
University, Reuss worked on a
playground renovation for a
senior project. "I found there was
a great need for this type of work
in the Boston community," Reuss
said.
Reuss said he found a similar
need in the community surround
ing Stanford. After proposing the
idea to other members of the
Stanford chapter of the Associa
tion of General Contractors, a
national organization to which
some of the graduate students in
civil engineering belong, Reuss
contacted the superintendent's
• office of the Ravenswood School
District to see which schools
needed assistance.
"They told me Willow Oaks
was in the worst shape, and they
were eager for our help," Reuss
said.
Reuss enlisted the assistance of
community volunteer groups and
local businesses to help the
school, which is nearly 60 percent
black and 30 percent Latino. The
project was showered with dona
tions of supplies. After six months
of planning and meetings, the
effort blossomed this past week
end.
"There is nothing like this,"
Reuss said, staring at some work
ers putting up new chains for the
swings Saturday. "There is noth
ing quite like the satisfaction of
helping kids out who really need
it,"he added.
Although the situation at Wil
low Oaks is not as severe as the
tough Boston neighborhood
where Reuss conducted his first
project, the perils of crime, drugs
and school dropout threaten the
development of Willow Oaks chil
dren.

But the renovation, which met
with success in Boston, is
expected to have a similarly posi
tive effect at the Menlo Park
school.
"When the kids see this, it will
have an impact," said Craig Tem
ple, a project volunteer and engi
neering student. "They see others
helping out and they may help
others in the future and, if they
need to, help themselves."
In addition to making the play
ground a safer place for the chil
dren to romp during recess, the
project also serves to bring
together the University commu
nity with the local off-campus
community.
"This is a great idea," said
Richard Nash, Kwame's father.
"Stanford is really getting
involved. It's nice to see students
taking time off, especially when

the weather is nice, to get
involved and help someone else."
Gwendolyn Gholson-Driver,
the school's principal, said,
"When you get Stanford involved
in projects like this it brings the
communities together. The tutor
ing programs and special projects
bring everyone together — one of
the results is what you see hap
pening on this playground."
The project also raises the chil
dren's self-esteem by giving them
pride in their school, said Donna
Rutherford, a parent of a Willow
Oaks pupil. "It gives kids a sense
of seeing that the school is becom
ing better," she said.
"We are cleaning it up, using
bright colors. The kids will see
what the changes are. The colors
will brighten up the school's play
ground and the kids will feel
good," Rutherford said.
