# More quake repair funds to be sought
## 
### Scott McCormack Staff writer 
After months of negotiations and extensive docu
mentation, the University has received less than $2
million from the federal government to pay for dam
age from the Earthquake of 1989.
But the University hopes to receive from $50 mil
lion to $60 million in total aid during the next five
years from the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, the organization charged with providing dis
aster relief around the country, said Gene Kershner,
assistant director of Facilities Project Management.
Representatives from the federal agency and the
University are currently negotiating reimbursement
for the repair costs of Geology and Language Cor
ners, estimated at $16.1 million and $17.4 million,
respectively. Kershner said negotiations for the
major repair projects will be completed in the next
two to three months.
Work on the two buildings is scheduled to begin in
January.
A team from the federal management agency has
been on campus since the earthquake to determine
repair costs for all damaged structures. Curt
Williams, director of Facilities Project Management,
said "a great deal of negotiation" is occurring
between Stanford and the agency's estimators.
To date, the University has received $1.98 million
out of $2.3 million in commitments from the agency,
said Robert Owens, manager of the Controller's
Office.
Kershner attributed the delays to the amount of
damage and the large volume of paperwork needed
to document the damage. "[The agency] has been
really insistent upon complete documentation [of
repair costs]. They have really required us to jump
through all the hoops. They keep asking for more
and more documentation."
Furthermore, the federal team that has been
working with Stanford out of its Mountain View
office has only two paid consultants, Kershner said.
This limits the number of claims that can be handled
at one time. Kershner said he does not blame the
agency for the slow pace, adding that he understands
their need to minimize costs.
As a nonprofit organization, Stanford would gen
erally be eligible to be reimbursed for 75 percent of
total earthquake repair costs, currently estimated at
$141 million. But because many
projects, such as the repairs to
Memorial Church, cannot be sup
ported by the government, only
$75 million in repairs are eligible
for federal funds, Kershner said.
The University hopes to be
reimbursed about 75 percent of
this figure.
Another discrepancy involves
the amount of each building's
repairs that the government will
pay, Williams said. The agency's
regulations limit coverage to
returning damaged buildings to
their pre-earthquake state, but
the University prefers to make
additional structural changes to
limit future earthquake damage.
Many of the older campus
buildings, particularly in the
Quad, were built of unreinforced
masonry. As a result, these build
ings are particularly susceptible
to quake damage.
Aside from the übiquitous
chain link fences and painted
wooden arches throughout the
Quad, earthquake damage is not

easily observable. "The untrained
eye doesn't see much danger, but
the walls were severely weak
ened" by the quake, Kershner
said.
"Many of the damaged struc
tures are over 100 years old. It
would be impossible to return
them to their pre-quake condition
other than tearing them down
and rebuilding," he said. "We
can't legally do that," he said,
explaining that codes for new
buildings do not allow unrein
forced masonry construction.
Kershner cited the Language
and Geology Corners as examples
of damaged buildings that cannot
be returned to their original state
simply by repairing the existing
structure. In these cases, the Uni
versity must find alternate plans
for strengthening the unrein
forced masonry.
A source of conflict between
the University and the agency is
that two different building codes
may apply in this situation: the
Santa Clara County Hazardous
Building Ordinance and the Uni
form Building Code, Kershner
said.
The agency prefers to use the
county code, which contains the

minimum legal requirements.
However, the University wants to
adhere to the stricter standards of
the Uniform Building Code, Ker
shner said.
"We have been arguing that it
is appropriate to strengthen the
buildings to higher standards. We
are pressuring for a stronger fix,"
Kershner said. The University
feels it would be inappropriate "to
put $4, 5 or 6 million into the
buildings" without strengthening
them above the minimum codes,
he said.
The relief agency's policy, how
ever, restricts reimbursement to
repairs that return buildings to
previous strength levels or mini
mum building codes, said Dennis
Whitehurst, the agency's techni
cal assistance coordinator. He said
the University must pay for any
additional repairs.

Kershner cited the Language
and Geology Corners as examples
of damaged buildings that cannot
be returned to their original state
simply by repairing the existing
structure. In these cases, the Uni
versity must find alternate plans
for strengthening the unrein
forced masonry.
A source of conflict between
the University and the agency is
that two different building codes
may apply in this situation: the
Santa Clara County Hazardous
Building Ordinance and the Uni
form Building Code, Kershner
said.
The agency prefers to use the
county code, which contains the

minimum legal requirements.
However, the University wants to
adhere to the stricter standards of
the Uniform Building Code, Ker
shner said.
"We have been arguing that it
is appropriate to strengthen the
buildings to higher standards. We
are pressuring for a stronger fix,"
Kershner said. The University
feels it would be inappropriate "to
put $4, 5 or 6 million into the
buildings" without strengthening
them above the minimum codes,
he said.
The relief agency's policy, how
ever, restricts reimbursement to
repairs that return buildings to
previous strength levels or mini
mum building codes, said Dennis
Whitehurst, the agency's techni
cal assistance coordinator. He said
the University must pay for any
additional repairs.
