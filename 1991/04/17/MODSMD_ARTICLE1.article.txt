# More quake repair funds to be sought

After months of negotiations and extensive docu
mentation, the University has received less than $2
million from the federal government to pay for dam
age from the Earthquake of 1989.
But the University hopes to receive from $50 mil
lion to $60 million in total aid during the next five
years from the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, the organization charged with providing dis
aster relief around the country, said Gene Kershner,
assistant director of Facilities Project Management.
Representatives from the federal agency and the
University are currently negotiating reimbursement
for the repair costs of Geology and Language Cor
ners, estimated at $16.1 million and $17.4 million,
respectively. Kershner said negotiations for the
major repair projects will be completed in the next
two to three months.
Work on the two buildings is scheduled to begin in
January.
A team from the federal management agency has
been on campus since the earthquake to determine
repair costs for all damaged structures. Curt
Williams, director of Facilities Project Management,
said "a great deal of negotiation" is occurring
between Stanford and the agency's estimators.
To date, the University has received $1.98 million
out of $2.3 million in commitments from the agency,
said Robert Owens, manager of the Controller's
Office.
Kershner attributed the delays to the amount of
damage and the large volume of paperwork needed
to document the damage. "[The agency] has been
really insistent upon complete documentation [of
repair costs]. They have really required us to jump
through all the hoops. They keep asking for more
and more documentation."
Furthermore, the federal team that has been
working with Stanford out of its Mountain View
office has only two paid consultants, Kershner said.
This limits the number of claims that can be handled
at one time. Kershner said he does not blame the
agency for the slow pace, adding that he understands
their need to minimize costs.
As a nonprofit organization, Stanford would gen
erally be eligible to be reimbursed for 75 percent of
total earthquake repair costs, currently estimated at
