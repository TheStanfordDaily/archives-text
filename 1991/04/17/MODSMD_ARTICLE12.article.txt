# Bush presents allied effort to help Kurds

WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi
dent Bush said yesterday that
allied military forces would create
encampments within northern
Iraq as part of a "greatly expanded
and more ambitious relief effort"
for tens of thousands of Kurds
fleeing from Saddam Hussein's
forces.
He said responsibility for the
refugee sites would be turned over
as soon as possible to the United
Nations and emphasized that the
United States had no intention of
occupying territory of Iraq.
At a White House news confer
ence, Bush said relief supplies
would be provided for the Kurds,
tens of thousands of whom are
caught in a no-man's land
attempting to flee Iraq for Turkey
and Iran.
Bush also defended his admin
istration against criticism that he
has moved to slowly to assist the
Kurds, who launched a rebellion
against Saddam in the days fol
lowing the Persian Gulf War, only
to have their uprising crushed.
He said it was a "purely
humanitarian" effort that does
not conflict with his determina
tion to keep U.S. soldiers from
being drawn into Iraqi civil war.
Bush opened his news confer
ence by announcing the intensi
fied relief effort.
"Hunger, malnutrition, disease
and exposure are taking their
grim toll," the president said. "...

We must encourage the Kurds to
move to areas in northern Iraq
where geography facilitiates
rather than frustrates relief
efforts."
"These people will be pro
tected. We are not going to say to
them come down from the moun
tains you will be protected and not
protect them."
Bush said there would be five
or six camps set up in a flat region
that would make it easier to house
refugees and deliver relief sup
plies.
He said a "relatively small
number" of troops would be
involved and added that there
would be air support to protect
the camps and their residents.
Bush said he had consulted
with several foreign leaders before
making his announcemnent, but
said his comments at the White
House marked his first authori
tate word to Iraq of his plans.
"They should not respond mili
tarily," he said in a virtual warn
ing to Iraq not to interfere with
the stepped up relief efforts. "And
I don't think they will," he added.
Bush did not describe how
American and other forces would
set up the encampments inside
Iraq. "Adequate security will be
provided at these temporary
sites," the president said. He said
he appreciated that Kurds would
otherwise fear for their safety in
Iraq.
