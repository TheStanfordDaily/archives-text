# Gorbachev woos Japanese, appeals for aid
## 
### 
TOKYO (AP) — Soviet President Mikhail S. Gor
bachev devoted his first day in Japan yesterday to
chipping away at the mutual animosity that has kept
Tokyo from sharing its immense wealth with its
impoverished neighbor.
Briefly leaving behind economic and political
woes at home, Gorbachev set out to woo the
Japanese as he has done with Americans and Euro
peans. He is the first Soviet leader to travel to Japan.
He spent the day meeting with Prime Minister
Toshiki Kaifu, cheerfully chatting with Emperor
Akihito and shaking hands with Tokyo residents.
But a more serious tone is expected today in Gor
bachev's parliamentary address. According to an
advance text of the speech, Gorbachev will warn
Japanese lawmakers that his nation needs help to
avert turmoil and a return to dictatorship.
The text also contained promises to reduce the
Soviet military presence in the region and suggests
multilateral naval reductions.
"If we don't halt the disintegration of the state —
of the economy, the law and relations between
republics; if we don't support the new social pro
cesses in a peaceful framework — the country could
fall into the chaos that gives birth to dictatorship,"
Gorbachev says in the text.
"Despair and hopelessness are a serious threat to
the progress of civilization. Therefore, advanced
countries help themselves by helping others."
Gorbachev also was reportedly planning to pre
sent business leaders with several trade proposals,
including bartering Soviet fuel and raw materials for
Japanese equipment to produce consumer goods,
and revival of a long-stalled $2.5 billion oil project on
Sakhalin, a Soviet island north of Japan.
"It is time to do everything so that our peoples . . .
will never again drift into the disaster of enmity,"
Gorbachev said at a nationally televised court ban
quet Tuesday night. "On the threshold of a new cen
tury and millennium, we must take from the past
only that which brings us together and enriches both
sides."
He was referring to the huge task of healing the
wounds left from World War 11, when the Soviets
seized four islands off Japan's northern coast and
tens of thousands of Japanese prisoners of war died
in Siberian camps.

In his banquet toast, Gorbachev offered condo
lences to the families of the Japanese prisoners who
perished, but stopped short of a formal apology. He is
expected to give the Japanese a list of the dead before
he leaves Friday.
That follows the tone of reconciliation he set Mon
day in the Siberian city of Khabarovsk, where he vis
ited the graves of Japanese who died while being
held prisoner.
The territorial dispute remains a formidable
obstacle. Japan demands return of all four islands —
known to Soviets as the Kuril Islands and to

Japanese as the Northern Territories — before it will
sign a treaty formally ending World War II hostilities
with the Soviets, thereby clearing the way for aid.
Gorbachev faces strong opposition at home to any
territorial concessions.
Half of his three-hour summit meeting with
Kaifu, which was described by a Japanese official as
a "frank exchange of views," was devoted to the dis
pute, and the leaders agreed not to divulge any
details until after further talks.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said Japanese economic aid was not discussed.
