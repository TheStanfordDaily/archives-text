# Drought, neglect spur African famine

NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) â€” Drought threat
ens unprecedented numbers of Africans with
starvation this year, and experts fear civil wars
and global indifference will deny help to mil
lions.
More than 24 million people are at risk
from the continent's eastern Horn, south to
Angola and Mozambique and west to Liberia,
according to the U.N. World Food Program.
The agency says food also is needed for 8 mil
lion people displaced by wars.
Donors have pledged little more than half
the 4.2 million tons of food needed and civil
wars have halted or slowed relief efforts in the
countries most severely affected.
Many aid experts also believe compelling
events elsewhere have diverted the world
attention that led to the Live-Aid concert for
famine relief in 1985.

"Between the Gulf War, changes in Eastern
Europe, instability in the Soviet Union ... if it
was ever hard to keep a focus on the Mozam
biques of the world, it's really hard to do that
now," said Roger Winter of the U.S. Commit
tee for Refugees.
Mahaman Balla, senior liaison officer of the
World Food Program in New York, said: "U.N.
agencies tend to fly wherever the wind is blow
ing. The wind is blowing now toward Kurdis
tan."
The tragedy in many parts of Africa "is as
compelling as the plight of the Kurds," he said,
but donors have provided only about one-fifth
of the food his agency needs to feed the
Africans.
Relief officials say two consecutive years of
crop failure in the Horn of Africa have caused
a food shortage rivaling the one responsible for

the great famine that killed an estimated 1
million Ethiopians in 1984-85.
Willard Pearson, the U.S. Agency for Inter
national Development representative in
Ethiopia, said the greatest problem this time is
"the civil wars hindering efforts to get relief
under way."
Countries most affected by the current
drought are divided by civil war, as in Sudan,
Ethiopia, Angola and Mozambique, or suffered
a disintegration of government through anar
chy and bloodshed, as in Liberia and Somalia.
"Civil war and conflict has become the
defining paradigm of food shortages in Africa,"
Pearson said.
Relief workers fear their delayed efforts
may come too late to save tens of thousands of
people who have left their homes in search of
food.
