# Chamorro requests more U.S. support
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) -
Nicaragua needs more U.S. aid as
it faces an "almost impossible"
task in building a democracy from
the ruins of civil war and eco
nomic collapse, President Violeta
Chamorro told Congress yester
day.
"We need steadfast financial
assistance from the United States
throughout this entire decade to
reconstruct our economy, follow
ing the terrible damage incurred
during the past decade," Mrs.
Chamorro told a joint meeting of
the House and Senate where she
was warmly welcomed.
But congressional leaders said
the United States will be unable to
offer substantial increases
because of its own economic prob
lems and competing demands for
aid around the globe.
"Obviously it's difficult for us
to do as much as we would like to
do in many parts of the world,"
said House Speaker Thomas
Foley, D-Wash.
Foley said it is more likely that
Congress will urge the adminis
tration to expedite aid dollars
already allocated for Nicaragua,
but which have been trickled out
relatively slowly by the Bush
administration.
Rep. Robert Torricelli, chair
man of the House Foreign Affairs
Western Hemisphere subcommit
tee, said he believed that repre
sented intentional foot-dragging
by the White House, which
resents Mrs. Chamorro's efforts
to accommodate leftist Sandinista
elements in her country.
"The administration is adapt
ing more slowly to the democratic
process than some elements in
Nicaragua," said Torricelli, D-N.J.
"We need to understand that if
some economic progress is not
made soon, this is a democratic
opportunity that could be lost."
A senior administration offi
cial, who briefed reporters on con
dition that he not be identified,
had enthusiastic praise for Mrs.
Chamorro's government and
expressed no reservations about
her policy toward the Sandinistas.
"We believe Mrs. Chamorro has
achieved a lot in a short time," he
said.

The official also denied there
was any foot-dragging on aid dis
bursements, asserting that assis
tance is flowing to Nicaragua at
the rate of about $20 million a
month. He described that as an
impressive rate considering that
the administration started from
scratch less than a year ago.
The United States has ear
marked $537 million for
Nicaragua since Mrs. Chamorro
defeated the Sandinista govern
ment of Daniel Ortega in Febru
ary 1990. Of that amount, accord
ing to a State Department official,
some $207 million has been dis
bursed.
"We cannot bail out every coun
try that is in trouble," said Rep.
Bill Richardson, D-N.M. "We are
not a candy store. . . We have a
crisis here at home."
Just over 100 of the 535 mem
bers of Congress attended the
speech, a relatively low turnout
for such events. Empty seats in
the chamber were filled in with
congressional staff members and
pages, a sign that U.S. attention
— so heavily focused on
Nicaragua during the 1980s —
has been distracted by crises in
the Middle East and in Europe.
"That ... is the attitude of
many prominent Nicaraguans,"
Foley said. "There are many coun
tries in the world . . . that feel that
the attention and focus of their
relationships to the United States
have been blurred, compared to
the intense focus on the Middle
East."
Mrs. Chamorro sought to
impress upon lawmakers, some of
whom have criticized her for
weakness, the difficulties she
faces.
"If a democratic system is
being built from the ruins of a dic
tatorship, and a civil war, from the
ruins of an economic disaster, the
feat is not only difficult, it is
almost impossible," she said.
But she added: "Nicaraguans
have accepted this as their chal
lenge."
She pledged to continue slash
ing government bureaucracy and
paring down the military, to
strengthen the country's judicial

system, to "religiously" respect
human rights and to prosecute
anyone caught exporting weapons
to leftist rebels in neighboring El
Salvador.
"It is important to note," she
said, "that our efforts to
strengthen freedom, establish
democracy and set up a 'state of
law' have to be accompanied by
economic prosperity."

The speech was the public
highlight of a three-day visit dur
ing which the Nicaraguan presi
dent also was meeting with offi
cials to work out a way to pay off
the $360 million in arrearages on
her country's $9.5 billion foreign
debt.
Mrs. Chamorro was scheduled
to meet with President Bush on
Wednesday.

"The administration is adapt
ing more slowly to the democratic
process than some elements in
Nicaragua," said Torricelli, D-N.J.
"We need to understand that if
some economic progress is not
made soon, this is a democratic
opportunity that could be lost."
A senior administration offi
cial, who briefed reporters on con
dition that he not be identified,
had enthusiastic praise for Mrs.
Chamorro's government and
expressed no reservations about
her policy toward the Sandinistas.
"We believe Mrs. Chamorro has
achieved a lot in a short time," he
said.

The official also denied there
was any foot-dragging on aid dis
bursements, asserting that assis
tance is flowing to Nicaragua at
the rate of about $20 million a
month. He described that as an
impressive rate considering that
the administration started from
scratch less than a year ago.
The United States has ear
marked $537 million for
Nicaragua since Mrs. Chamorro
defeated the Sandinista govern
ment of Daniel Ortega in Febru
ary 1990. Of that amount, accord
ing to a State Department official,
some $207 million has been dis
bursed.
"We cannot bail out every coun
try that is in trouble," said Rep.
Bill Richardson, D-N.M. "We are
not a candy store. . . We have a
crisis here at home."
Just over 100 of the 535 mem
bers of Congress attended the
speech, a relatively low turnout
for such events. Empty seats in
the chamber were filled in with
congressional staff members and
pages, a sign that U.S. attention
— so heavily focused on
Nicaragua during the 1980s —
has been distracted by crises in
the Middle East and in Europe.
"That ... is the attitude of
many prominent Nicaraguans,"
Foley said. "There are many coun
tries in the world . . . that feel that
the attention and focus of their
relationships to the United States
have been blurred, compared to
the intense focus on the Middle
East."
Mrs. Chamorro sought to
impress upon lawmakers, some of
whom have criticized her for
weakness, the difficulties she
faces.
"If a democratic system is
being built from the ruins of a dic
tatorship, and a civil war, from the
ruins of an economic disaster, the
feat is not only difficult, it is
almost impossible," she said.
But she added: "Nicaraguans
have accepted this as their chal
lenge."
She pledged to continue slash
ing government bureaucracy and
paring down the military, to
strengthen the country's judicial

system, to "religiously" respect
human rights and to prosecute
anyone caught exporting weapons
to leftist rebels in neighboring El
Salvador.
"It is important to note," she
said, "that our efforts to
strengthen freedom, establish
democracy and set up a 'state of
law' have to be accompanied by
economic prosperity."

The speech was the public
highlight of a three-day visit dur
ing which the Nicaraguan presi
dent also was meeting with offi
cials to work out a way to pay off
the $360 million in arrearages on
her country's $9.5 billion foreign
debt.
Mrs. Chamorro was scheduled
to meet with President Bush on
Wednesday.
