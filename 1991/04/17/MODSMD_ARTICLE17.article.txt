## Council of Presidents 
### 
THE COUNCIL OF Presi
dents slate best aware of and
most able to address Stan
ford students' concerns in the com
ing year is "Students First."
"Students First" has made
accountability to students the cen
tral issue of this campaign, and
they are vigorous in their promise
to be responsive to the opinion of
students throughout the year. The

slate has also raised — and
answered — the issue of graduate
students' concerns at Stanford.
"Students First" has pledged
itself to improving the quality of
student services, most especially in
preventing sexual assault. Stu
dents will also welcome the 20 per
cent cut in the COP's excessive
salaries which the slate has volun
teered to take.
