## Memories of kindergarten 
### 
MEMORY IS A STRANGE crea
ture, perhaps the most important
thing in our lives, yet at the same
time the least tangible. We forget tele
phone numbers; we lose our meal cards;
yet we can rattle off, without thinking,
the name of every last character on
"Happy Days."
It may seem futile to attempt to
impose any semblance of order on this
kind of chaos, but as far as I can tell, we
seem to remember moments, people and
facts because they hold some sort of emo
tional significance for us, because they've
made an impression. The Fonz was a hero
to us, a big brother; our meal cards, how
ever necessary for eating, are pieces of
plastic.
Kindergarten was 14 years ago, but I
still remember it — the start of school,
the first step in a life-long severance from
my parents. It was a crucible of experi
ence, brief and intense, and I retained the
details: the time I tried to count to a mil
lion, the smell of chocolate from the fac
tory two blocks away.
Most of all, I remember Mrs. Rose, my
teacher, for whom there could not have
been a more appropriate name. She was
kind and beautiful and fresh-smelling.
She said I was a smart kid, and I wanted
to marry her.
And today, 14 years later, I have no
idea whether she was black or white.
When I first realized this, a few
months ago, after reading an article in
the San Francisco Chronicle about minor
ity teachers in elementary education, I
was baffled. How could I remember
smells and sounds and coloring books and

not the color of my teacher?
The school was in an urban neighbor
hood, with a large minority population.
Some of the kids had light skin, some
dark, some in-between and, other than
for purposes of identification, the distinc
tions never crossed our minds.
Color was a detail with no emotional
value, no lasting significance, and we
didn't remember it from day to day. How
could I be expected to remember it 14
years later? Mrs. Rose was what I made of
her, an amalgam of smells, sounds and
words that held meaning for me, with
irrelevant details conveniently weeded
out by memory.
Kindergarten didn't last forever.
Before first grade, I moved to the sub
urbs. The prevailing whiteness of my
classmates was at first no more than a
curiosity, but then the world changed. We
sat boy-girl-boy-girl and learned gender
differentiation. I read faster than any
body else and got to sit by myself on the
side of the room: upper and lower classes,
sketched with cartoon-like simplicity.
Then, in the third grade, a boy named
LaVerne slammed my head in a door. I
cried and complained, and when I was
done, one of my friends discreetly took me
aside and told me I should forgive LaV
erne because he was black.
In high school, black students were
bussed in from the city in the morning to
be exposed to the advantages of the white
man's schools, then bussed back to the
city at night to the black man's streets,
the black man's economy, the black man's
world. I didn't like it when the black stu
dents sat by themselves in the classroom,

the cafeteria or the library, but I wasn't
surprised.
Then I came to Stanford, whose ethnic
diversity and integration promised to res
urrect kindergarten on a grand scale.
Color would again be unimportant, irrele
vant, with no emotional baggage: some
thing to forget, not remember.
I've found something quite different,
of course, and it saddens me. Theme
houses, ethnic social organizations and
letters to the editor tell me we have to cul
tivate equality by making ethnic groups
fully aware of each other's differences, by
separating ourselves, at least for the
moment.
And this may well be true, despite its
inherent paradox. Once the Garden of
Eden has been lost, once we have a
glimpse of our differences, denying them
won't make them go away. Understand
ing, at this point, is less harmful than dis
tortion.
But I don't think I'm being unreason
able when I wish our differences had
never mattered. And I'm not ashamed to
say the Mrs. Rose that floats through my
memory, clear in parts and fuzzy in oth
ers, is still just Mrs. Rose, no color except
the red of her lips and her name, and I
hope she stays that way.
