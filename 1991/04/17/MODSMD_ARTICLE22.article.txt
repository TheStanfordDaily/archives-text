TA adds his two cents
to discussion sparked
by student's remarks
I am writing in response to Elizabeth
Feil's April 9 letter, "Chemistry students
face lazy teaching, dangerous lab condi
tions." First, I would like to apologize to
Feil for the horrible experiences she has
had with the core chemistry curriculum
here at Stanford. It is too bad she had
such an awful time because chemistry is
an interesting and exciting field. She
has, however, brought forth a large num
ber of generalities in her letter which are
simply not true of teaching assistants in
the Chemistry Department.
In her letter, Feil states that "TAs do
not go to the trouble of reviewing the
material or even attending lectures."
TAs are required to attend class and are
reprimanded when they do not. And I do
not know of any TA who would be crazy
enough to go before a section unpre
pared. The result would be utterly
embarrassing.
Feil also states TAs should go through
training sessions before teaching a
course. TAs spend the better part of
three days before classes start in teach
ing workshops. One of these workshops
is an afternoon program for all TAs on
campus and is facilitated by the Center
for Teaching and Learning.
Feil goes on to say that "TAs often
have inconvenient office hours" and sug
gests the Chemistry Resource Center
should be staffed from 9 a.m. until 9
p.m. every weekday. The CRC is staffed
by TAs from most lecture courses from 1
p.m. to 5 p.m. every day. In addition,
many courses set up evening office hours
in Meyer Library, and some TAs have
been known to meet students in the Cof
fee House — a very convenient location.
During these times the number of
TAs present in the CRC or Meyer far

outnumbers the students. Usually no
one shows up at all. Therefore, extending
the hours for the CRC would be ludi
crous.
With regard to safety in the labora
tory, Feil contends that students are
inadequately prepared to deal with the
hazards of a chemistry lab. Students in
Chemistry 36 and Chemistry 130 receive
a 30-minute lecture on this topic from
Dr. Kirk Roberts, the director of the
undergraduate laboratories. Further
more, they are required to read and sign
a two-page contract which outlines basic
laboratory safety.
One key paragraph from this form
states, "HAZARD WARNING: Caution
— the solids, liquids and gaseous sub
stances, and combinations thereof, as
used in these experiments, are poten
tially hazardous in one or more of the
following ways:
• They may be irritants to, or have
caustic action on, the skin, mucous
membranes, lungs and eyes;
• They may be systemic poisons; and
• They may be flammable and/or
explosive."
In addition, the sections are led on a
laboratory safety tour which outlines the
location of safety equipment such as
showers, eyewashes, fire extinguishers,
etc. Contrary to Feil's belief, students
are given ample warning concerning the
hazards present in the instructional labs.
In conclusion, it is clear that all of
Feil's statements regarding TAs and lab
oratory safety are inaccurate and do not
reflect in any way the nature of the core
chemistry curriculum at Stanford.
The TAs in the Chemistry Depart
ment are conscientious and provide great
learning opportunities to their students.
A high minimum standard is upheld. In
order to demonstrate this, I extend to
Feil an invitation to observe my Chem
istry 36 sections, that is, if she is not
afraid of being enlightened.
