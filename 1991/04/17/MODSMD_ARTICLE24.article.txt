BSU officer outraged
at slate's inattention
to black community
I was incredibly shocked by one of the
statements made about "Students First"
in The Daily's April 15 endorsement of
them.
The editorial began with the state
ment, "The Council of Presidents slate
best aware of and most able to address
Stanford students' concerns in the com
ing year is 'Students First."' Evidently,
the members of the editorial board did
not attend the COP debate at Madera on
April 11.
During this debate, I asked the "Stu
dents First" COP candidates a very sim
ple yet important question: "Have you
ever talked to anyone in the black com
munity (a black student, a staff member
at the Black Community Services Center,
any Black Student Union officer, anyone
who knows something about the black
community) about the issues currently
affecting black students at Stanford?
Please tell me what you see as some of
the mtyor concerns affecting the black
community and how you plan to work
with us next year to help advance our
community if you are the next Council of
Presidents."
Beth Morgan and Bennie Sandoval
responded by saying they were both com
mitted to issues of diversity. "Students
First" did not answer my question at all.
Finally, my question was answered when

Mae Lee of the "Stand and Deliver" slate
listed some of the main concerns of the
black community and explained how
"Stand and Deliver" would be responsive
to the needs of black students if they are
the next COP
I was appalled by "Students First's"
blatant ignorance of the black commu
nity. As a BSU officer, I know they made
no attempts whatsoever to approach the
BSU and learn about our concerns. How
can The Daily's editorial board claim
"Student First" is aware of students'
concerns when this slate has completely
neglected to learn about the needs of the
black community?
A number of People's Platform senate
candidates and all of their COP slate
members approached the BSU before the
campaigning began to ask how they
could represent our views and support
our future efforts if they were elected.
"Students First" should have taken the
same initiative.
Angela Hilton
Junior, American studies
Senate hopeful gives
explanation for error,
withdraws from race
I would like to set the record straight
concerning my campaign use of the Aca
demic Information Resources electronic
mail facilities on Sunday, April 14, 1991.
These are the facts:
I at no time anticipated that mass

electronic mail communications would
cause a glitch in the University computer
system.
However, in retrospect, I realize that
AIR policy does include a clause that
clearly prohibits the use of any AIR sys
tems for political purposes.
I am taking personal responsibility for
this honest mistake that led to an unfor
tunate situation.
Moreover, I would like to make it clear
that all other persons only knew in pass
ing about my electronic mail concept.
Specifically, I did not discuss in any sig
nificant detail of either the contents or
the timing of the mailing with any of the
named parties.
I regret and apologize for any undue
publicity, negative and positive, which
my actions may have caused.
Where to go from here:
Clearly, considering the problems that
have arisen, an ASSU Bylaw change
should be made that more explicitly pro
hibits the use of electronic mail or any
AIR facilities for all campaign purposes.
On the legality of campaign actions:
The Elections Commission or designee
should set up a process to ensure that he
or she is completely familiar with all the
rules regarding the election. If asked a
question by a candidate regarding a par
ticular form of campaigning, he or she
should be prepared to provide an on-the
record written statement that answers
the question.
In terms of the impact on AIR:
I apologize completely for all the
inconveniences that my actions have
caused in terms of disrupting AIR sys-

tems. There was no intention whatsoever
to cause any disruption. However, my
knowledge of the operations of the AIR
electronic mail system was limited, and I
failed to anticipate the problems that
ended up crashing the computer system.
Moreover, I would like to apologize to
AIR and the users I may have inconve
nienced.
As retribution for what infractions I
may or may not have committed, I with
draw my candidacy for undergraduate
senate.
Nawwar Kasrawi
Freshman, electrical engineering and
history
COP candidate hopes
students don't focus
on campaign mistake
Last week, while Nawwar Kasrawi
and I were making campaign banners, he
mentioned an idea about sending an elec
tronic mail message. I told him that
while campaigning via electronic mail
sounded like a great idea in theory, he
should check out first whether or not it
was an allowable campaign practice.
I did not know whether Kasrawi
would actually follow through with the
idea. I also didn't know whom he would
mention in the message.
Still, I regret that I did not have
enough information to advise him of the
outcomes of his actions, which are

becoming more clear today.
Kaflnjwr*s honest mistake has caused
quite a stir. However, I hope both the
candidates and the student body will look
beyond this incident and "stick to the
issues" as we campaign and vote.

ment, "The Council of Presidents slate
best aware of and most able to address
Stanford students' concerns in the com
ing year is 'Students First."' Evidently,
the members of the editorial board did
not attend the COP debate at Madera on
April 11.
During this debate, I asked the "Stu
dents First" COP candidates a very sim
ple yet important question: "Have you
ever talked to anyone in the black com
munity (a black student, a staff member
at the Black Community Services Center,
any Black Student Union officer, anyone
who knows something about the black
community) about the issues currently
affecting black students at Stanford?
Please tell me what you see as some of
the mtyor concerns affecting the black
community and how you plan to work
with us next year to help advance our
community if you are the next Council of
Presidents."
Beth Morgan and Bennie Sandoval
responded by saying they were both com
mitted to issues of diversity. "Students
First" did not answer my question at all.
Finally, my question was answered when

Mae Lee of the "Stand and Deliver" slate
listed some of the main concerns of the
black community and explained how
"Stand and Deliver" would be responsive
to the needs of black students if they are
the next COP
I was appalled by "Students First's"
blatant ignorance of the black commu
nity. As a BSU officer, I know they made
no attempts whatsoever to approach the
BSU and learn about our concerns. How
can The Daily's editorial board claim
"Student First" is aware of students'
concerns when this slate has completely
neglected to learn about the needs of the
black community?
A number of People's Platform senate
candidates and all of their COP slate
members approached the BSU before the
campaigning began to ask how they
could represent our views and support
our future efforts if they were elected.
"Students First" should have taken the
same initiative.
Angela Hilton
Junior, American studies
Senate hopeful gives
explanation for error,
withdraws from race
I would like to set the record straight
concerning my campaign use of the Aca
demic Information Resources electronic
mail facilities on Sunday, April 14, 1991.
These are the facts:
I at no time anticipated that mass

electronic mail communications would
cause a glitch in the University computer
system.
However, in retrospect, I realize that
AIR policy does include a clause that
clearly prohibits the use of any AIR sys
tems for political purposes.
I am taking personal responsibility for
this honest mistake that led to an unfor
tunate situation.
Moreover, I would like to make it clear
that all other persons only knew in pass
ing about my electronic mail concept.
Specifically, I did not discuss in any sig
nificant detail of either the contents or
the timing of the mailing with any of the
named parties.
I regret and apologize for any undue
publicity, negative and positive, which
my actions may have caused.
Where to go from here:
Clearly, considering the problems that
have arisen, an ASSU Bylaw change
should be made that more explicitly pro
hibits the use of electronic mail or any
AIR facilities for all campaign purposes.
On the legality of campaign actions:
The Elections Commission or designee
should set up a process to ensure that he
or she is completely familiar with all the
rules regarding the election. If asked a
question by a candidate regarding a par
ticular form of campaigning, he or she
should be prepared to provide an on-the
record written statement that answers
the question.
In terms of the impact on AIR:
I apologize completely for all the
inconveniences that my actions have
caused in terms of disrupting AIR sys-

tems. There was no intention whatsoever
to cause any disruption. However, my
knowledge of the operations of the AIR
electronic mail system was limited, and I
failed to anticipate the problems that
ended up crashing the computer system.
Moreover, I would like to apologize to
AIR and the users I may have inconve
nienced.
As retribution for what infractions I
may or may not have committed, I with
draw my candidacy for undergraduate
senate.
Nawwar Kasrawi
Freshman, electrical engineering and
history
COP candidate hopes
students don't focus
on campaign mistake
Last week, while Nawwar Kasrawi
and I were making campaign banners, he
mentioned an idea about sending an elec
tronic mail message. I told him that
while campaigning via electronic mail
sounded like a great idea in theory, he
should check out first whether or not it
was an allowable campaign practice.
I did not know whether Kasrawi
would actually follow through with the
idea. I also didn't know whom he would
mention in the message.
Still, I regret that I did not have
enough information to advise him of the
outcomes of his actions, which are

becoming more clear today.
Kaflnjwr*s honest mistake has caused
quite a stir. However, I hope both the
candidates and the student body will look
beyond this incident and "stick to the
issues" as we campaign and vote.
