## Grad student advances algal taxonomy 
### Nancy Volkers Staff writer 
Scientific classifications have a bad name.
They're Latin, usually very long, and mean
things like "red, poisonous, flat-footed
quadruped with distinctive striped head
markings." Almost anyone who's ever had to
memorize them for a biology course will
agree that he'd rather watch "Home Alone"
if given the option — even though it means
seeing Macaulay Culkin do the hands-on
cheeks-oh-my-God-I'm-making-so-much-
money scream seven times.
But the classification of organisms, called
taxonomy, represents a vital link in the
chain of scientific understanding. We need to
understand the differences between organ
isms before we can understand how they
interact and how human beings affect those
interactions.
Rob Rowan, a Stanford postdoctoral fel
low at Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific
Grove, has begun research that will help to
put names to the faces of one of the most
abundant types of algae in our oceans, yel
low-brown dinoflagellates known as zooxan
thellae ("zoo"="animal,'' "xanth"="yel
low"). His research was published in the
March 15 issue of Science.

Since algae produce their own energy
through photosynthesis and do not prey on
other organisms, they sit at the bottom of
the marine food chain. The more biologists
can learn about them, the better they can
understand what happens at higher levels of
the ecosystem.
The algae Rowan studied live with inver
tebrate animals such as corals and
anemones in a symbiotic relationship called
mutualism. The algae provide food for their
hosts, and the hosts provide shelter for the
algae.
Most zooxanthellae are classified in the
genus Symbiodinium, but taxonomy at the
species level has been hindered by problems
with obtaining cultures and the possibility
that mutualism causes changes in the shape
of the algae.
Rowan has been collecting samples for
the past two years, and he has avoided the
typical problems by using molecular biology
instead of strict morphology to classify the
algae.
Rowan extracted and copied a specific
algal gene from 131 samples collected from
St. Croix in the Virgin Islands; Hawaii;
Bermuda; the Bahamas; Woods Hole, Mass.;
and Pacific Grove. When he compared the
genes, he found 10 different types of algae.

Rowan discovered that while each coral is
loyal to only one type of alga, one alga might
live with several different types of coral.
Rowan's results imply that symbiotic
relationships were created by long-term
shuffling of combinations of animals and
algae. The invertebrate-zooxanthella sym
biosis has existed since the Jurassic Period,
the age of the dinosaurs. Present-day sym
bioses may thus be the results of hundreds
of millions of years of evolution.
Many scientists, including Rowan, think
that algal nutrients give corals the energy to
remove calcium carbonate from the water,
and thus to produce the large and breathtak
ing coral reefs that can be found in shallow
tropical waters. Without the algae, reefs —
which house a large diversity of ocean life —
would not exist.
Rowan hopes to continue this research,
which is also in progress at UC-Santa Bar
bara. This study is only a beginning, but it
does provide a base for further experiments,
he said.
"I think it's important to try to learn as
much as you can about the ocean ecosys
tem," Rowan said, "and try to avoid some of
the mistakes that were made and will con
tinue to be made with terrestrial ecosys
tems."
