# Hospital communications will use computers
## 
### Julie Makinen Staff writer 
From the most advanced intensive care
units to extra corporeal membrane oxygena
tion systems, the new Lucile Packard Chil
dren's Hospital will offer its patients some of
the finest medical technologies available any
where.
But one of the most important new systems
that will be implemented in the new hospital is
not uniquely a medical technology.
Meditech, the hospital's communication
network, will store information about patients
in a huge database, linking nurses, doctors,
the pharmacy and even the billing department
via computer networks.
At the new hospital, however, all informa
tion regarding a patient will be stored on
Meditech. When a patient is admitted, a file
will either be created (for first-time patients)
or reopened (for repeat patients). Doctors,
nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians will
then be able to input and access patient files.
Meditech should save a lot of "telephone
time and legwork," according to Linda Sten
son, clinical systems manager at the new hos
pital.
This network should make medical care
much more efficient and accurate. Under the
old system, if a doctor needed medicine from
the pharmacy, a written order for the drugs
was given to a nurse. The nurse would then
give the order to a messenger, who would relay
the order by telephone to the pharmacy or
hand deliver it.
Now, a doctor can simply type in the order
directly to the pharmacy. An automated tube
system will deliver the medicine, effectively
eliminating all the paperwork and footwork
that was previously required. A priority sys
tem — which will identify those medicines and
pieces of equipment that are needed immedi
ately — will ensure that emergency supply
requests will be the first orders to be pro
cessed.

Meditech should also reduce the problem of
missing records. The system uses a procedure
called "shadowing," which automatically
makes a backup copy of all information that is
entered. Because these backups are made on
line throughout the day, there is no required
daily downtime during which the system
would not be operational while files are copied.
Of course, computerizing a hospital is no
small task. "We have over 600 nurses alone to
train, not to mention clerks, physicians and
other employees," said Stenson.
The first of the training sessions has
already taken place. Although there was "a lit
tle 'computer phobia' at first," said Stenson,

"even people who have never really used
computers can learn it quickly."
Meditech is considered by many to be the
most efficient and versatile health communi
cation system, according to Dr. Lorry Frankel
of the Department of Pediatrics, and is already
used in thousands of hospitals across the
country. Because each system is customized,
information cannot be transferred from one
hospital to another.
But the fact that a large number of institu
tions use Meditech is significant in helping to
standardize organizational aspects of hospital
administration.
