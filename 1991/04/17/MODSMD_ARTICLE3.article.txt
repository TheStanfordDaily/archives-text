# Med School group to take over Cowell
## Student care change effective fall 
### Peter Robison Staff writer 
A Stanford School of Medicine
program will take over student
care at Cowell Student Health
Center next fall, ending a 45-year
relationship between the center
and Palo Alto Medical Founda
tion.
Cowell officials said yesterday
that the Medical School's Faculty
Practice Program will take over
operations beginning Sept. 1.
However, some of the current
Cowell staff may be hired by the
new program and stay on at the
center.
The Foundation is a group of
700 physicians, nurses and sup
port staff, 50 of whom are
employed at Cowell. The Medical
School group is composed of fac
ulty members who currently prac
tice at Stanford Medical Center.
"We think [the change] is going
to enrich services for students,"
said Cowell Director Harvey Wein
stein, who made the decision
based on the recommendation of a
committee of students, faculty
and staff. The panel had been con
sidering proposals by the founda
tion and the Medical School group
for the past year.
The staff of the Foundation
was "somewhat surprised and
very disappointed" by the discon
tinuation of service after "a suc
cessful relationship of 45 years,"
according to a statement by the
foundation's president, Robert
Jamplis.
Jay Thorwaldson, director of
community relations at the foun
dation, said, "[Cowell] is being
held up across the nation as one of
the best student health centers.
This is a puzzling decision."
The committee's recommenda
tion was met there with "varying
degrees of surprise," he added.
Weinstein said Cowell officials
were not disappointed with the

foundation's service, but the Med
ical School group offered a "larger
array of services."
"This lets us tap into the
resources of the Medical School,
which will provide us with some
facilities and resources that we
haven't had," Weinstein said.
Other factors were the Medical
School group's plan for "better
and more consistent" care of chil
dren, its stronger counseling and
psychological services, and its pro
vision for a full-time "quality of
care" investigator, who will assess
the effectiveness of Cowell's ser
vices.
The "quality of care" investiga
tor was an important factor in the
decision, Weinstein said, because
"part of being a modern medical
center is constantly assessing the
quality of care."
The 50 doctors, nurses and
support staff employed by the
foundation at Cowell were
informed of the change Monday.
However, many of them may be
able to join the Medical School
program and stay at Cowell.
Peter Gregory, medical director
of the Faculty Practice Program,
said the group plans to be sensi
tive to the concerns of foundation
employees during the transition.
"This time for employees —
having to look at a new employer
after about 50 years — is an
unnerving one for them," he said.
"But we will provide them with a
set of benefits that is as good, and
in some cases, better."
Gregory emphasized that the
foundation had "done an excellent
job" at Cowell, but "in time" the
Stanford plan will "have some
advantages to bring to Cowell."
One of the main advantages is
the Medical School's closer inter
action with the students and the
University. "There is a synergistic
ability to work together," Gregory
said.
