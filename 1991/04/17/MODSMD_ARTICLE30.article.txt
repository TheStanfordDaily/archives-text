# Complex reaction is Silly String's secret

Q m How do Super String and
• Silly String work ?
A. Despite what your ditzy
• roommate from Los Angeles
thinks, there is not 400 feet of flu
orescent string stuffed into that
can. According to an unnamed,
yet high-ranking, company official
at E. Davis, Inc., the makers of the
popular party product Super
String, life is much more compli
cated than that.
In reality, the stuff inside the
can is a complex combination of
quasi-mysterious ingredients
that, when mixed together under
the proper party conditions,
allows us to have hours of fun
squirting our friends and ene
mies, and then cleaning up the
mess afterward.
To make Super String, a secret
resin is mixed with an emulsifier
and loaded into the Super String
can — along with a propellant
that is nontoxic, nonflammable
and free of chlorofluorocarbons,
so you can squirt your room
mate's guinea pig in the eye with
out feeling guilty about wrecking
the ozone layer.
Over a period of about two
weeks, the resin and propellant
undergo a chemical reaction
within the can so that the resin
polymerizes into an emulsified
solid. Like the ever-tasty Gallo
wine, no Super String will be sold
before its time. Pushing the little
button on top of the can allows
this miracle of modern chemistry
to forcefully escape from its con
tainment vessel into the atmo
sphere, whereby the string itself is
formed as a propellant-filled
membrane of polymerized resin.
Stay tuned — next week we do
Glow-in-the-Dark Silly Putty.
. What is the evolutionary
vY • advantage of cats having
such different coat colors? What
about the tailless Manx cat?
A. Cats found in the wild usu
• ally have spotted or striped
patterns on their coats, like leop
ards and tigers, or have coats of a
uniform solid brownish color,
such as those of lions and pumas.
Domestic cats were bred from the
wildcat, Felis sylvestris, and these
original house cats (version 1.0)
probably had both types of coat
patterns.
Although the evolutionary
advantage of having a coat color
which blends into the environ
ment seems obvious, having a coat
of bright colors, such as found on
calicoes, or an unusually pat
terned coat, like that of the
Siamese cat, do not seem to have
any Darwinian adaptation. Like

fashion models with paints of dif
ferent colors splotched over their
faces, cats that look interesting,
exotic or appealing to humans
have a survival advantage only in
domestic breeding.
Ancient and modern breeders
have selected cats with mutations
that give rise to exotic and appeal
ing coat colors that normally
would be disadvantageous in
nature.
The Siamese cat has a light-col
ored body with dark-colored ears,
paws and tail. This particular pat
tern is caused by a mutant form of
a pigment-producing enzyme that
is temperature sensitive. Accord
ing to former Science Bug Brian
White, this enzyme is able to
make a dark pigment in the cool
extremities of the animal but is
inactive near the 39 degree Cel
sius body temperature of cats.
Cats with this random mutation
were considered royal property in
the kingdom of Siam.
Likewise, cats with interesting
solid-colored coats, such as Rus
sian blues, Chartreux or Havana
browns, owe their coat color to dif
ferent types of pigment-producing
enzymes which arose by random
mutations. These cats were then
selected by breeders.
The Manx cat (Cat, version 2.1)
is born without a tail and origi
nated on the Isle of Man, which
lies off the coast of Britain. These
cats also have longer rear legs
than most cats and run with a
rabbit-like hop. These features
are caused by a single gene, tail
less, which is a dominant mutant
gene involved in spinal column
development. Interestingly, inher
iting two copies of the tailless
gene is lethal, presumably because
such a genetic endowment does
not allow sufficient spinal devel
opment.
NeXT Cat, Unix Cat and Mac-
Cat version 7.0 are due for release
later this year.
