# System 7.0: more trouble than it's worth?
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
When Apple releases System
7.0 for the Macintosh on May
13, many people will no doubt
run down to the local computer
store, pick up a copy and install
it on their computers.
After the initial oohs and ahs
pass, though, those same multi
tudes may very well wish they
had waited.
Changing the operating sys
tem on one's computer is not
something that should be taken
lightly. Many years ago, Apple
promised to revolutionize the
way we worked with our Apple
lis through ProDOS, a replace
ment for the venerable DOS 3.3.
When I first saw ProDOS, I
thought it was pretty nifty — a
lot more like a real operating
system. Still, I waited months
before installing it. As a matter
of fact, I never switched to Pro-
DOS; instead, I switched com
puters — to the Mac.
There are a lot of reasons why
these are not parallel circum
stances. First of all, ProDOS
was not nearly as revolutionary
as System 7.0. The incentive to
change over was not as great.

But there's a
flip side: It was
much easier to
make the jump to
ProDOS than it
will be to update
your Mac. A lot of
existing software
is not going to run
under System 7.0
and a lot more
software is not

going to run well.
The party line at Apple right
now is that most mqjor applica
tions — Word, Excel, Mac Write
— and the like should run with
out major problems under the
new Macintosh operating sys
tem. But, if history serves as any
indication, that's unlikely to
prove entirely true.
The probable scenario is that
said software will run fairly well,
but that there will be a bug here
and a crash there. Most software
makers will then announce so
called maintenance releases —
new versions with no improve
ments other than bug fixes. For
instance, Microsoft might put
out a Word 4.00E, which spaces
words correctly under True-
Type.
Confused yet? It gets worse.

The biggest
trend after the
7.0 announce
ment will be
placing stickers
on the shrink
wrapping of soft
ware that read
"System 7.0
ready." And they
will be ready.
Sort of.

Ready means nothing more
than capable of running. It
doesn't mean that the software
will exploit all — or even most —
of the new technology that
makes System 7.0 such a revolu
tion.
Take Publish and Subscribe,
for instance. These new com
mands will appear in the Edit
menu and provide you with
what has become known as "live
copy and paste." I have no idea
what the term means but Pub
lish and Subscribe will be big —
guaranteed.
What they allow you to do is
take, say, a word processing doc
ument and have it "subscribe"
to a portion of a spreadsheet. If
you, or even someone else on
your network, makes a change
to the spreadsheet, the copy in

your word processing file will be
updated automatically. You'll
wonder how you ever lived with
out it.
For programs to use Publish
and Subscribe, they have to be
rewritten. The code will not mys
tically appear. Same goes for
Apple Events, a series of proto
cols that will allow applications to
talk to — and eventually control
— the actions of one another.
Now that you are drowning in
a sea of technical mumbo jumbo,
let me sink you once and for all.
To this point, I have largely been
discussing application software
exclusively. As most of you know,
the Mac is not just applications.
There are startup documents
(INITs), control panel devices
(CDEVs) and desk accessories.
There are also fonts and
sounds and lots of pretty pic
tures.
All of these mini-programs
patch the system directly and
promise to be largely unfriendly
to System 7.0. Since many of
them are not commercial soft
ware, their authors haven't seen
System 7.0 yet and haven't been
able to make the necessary fixes.
More on this, and a whole lot
of other goodies, next week.
