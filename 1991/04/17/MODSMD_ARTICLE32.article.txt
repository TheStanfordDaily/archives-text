## Stanford ends midweek jinx with win over St. Mary's 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
After playing four-straight
Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division games in a row, Stanford
remembered you have to get
excited for the non-conference
games as well. Before yesterday's
game with St. Mary's, the big
question facing the Stanford base
ball team was not if they could
beat the Gaels, but whether or not
they could muster the energy for
the task at hand. Luckily for Car
dinal fans the answer came in the
form of a 11-5 victory.
"We came out of the gates
swinging," said centerfielder Jef
frey Hammonds. "We couldn't let
them get out on top; we had to
stay in our own game."
Hammonds' fifth-inning home
run highlighted a six-run rally
that turned the game into a
yawner, but the memory of last
week's loss to the University of
the Pacific has taught the Cardi
nal to appreciate teams of lesser
caliber. Seven of Stanford's 11
losses have come to team's outside
the Six-Pac.
"We would play three or four
league games then go out and
make some team's season by los
ing," pitching coach Tom Dunton
said. "I was getting tired of seeing
(other teams) throw a party across
the field every Tuesday."
"We are one of the top five
teams in the nation," said Ham
monds. "We have to play like that
every time out."
The Cardinal certainly looked
pretty good in the fifth. Leading 3-
2 after four, Stanford took what
looked to a close contest and blew

it open. A Dave McCarty single
scored Dave Cornell to bring the
Cardinal ahead by two, and then
Hammonds took a letter-high
fastball to right field to make it 6-
2. Hammonds, whose two stolen
bases in the second inning set up
the first Stanford run, finished
the day 2-for-4 with two RBI, the
homer being his first since the
Arizona State series in late Febru
ary.
The sophomore had been
forced to miss some games earlier
due to a hamstring pull and is only
now beginning to get back into the
form that made him a first-team
All-America selection a year ago.
After being moved into the clean
up spot this year to produce runs,
Hammonds was happy to have his
longball draught over.
"I didn't feel any pressure to
hit a home run; it was a pyscho
logical lift more than anything,"
said the New Jersey native. "I'm
starting to put it back together. I
don't have it yet, but it's a start."
Hammonds' strike off Gael
releiver Brett Fulton cleared the
bases, but the Cardinal was far
from finished. In fact, St. Mary's
would have to wait four more bat
ters to record its first out of the
inning. Right fielder Steve
Solomon followed his outfield
partner with a single, and then
used an error on second basemen
Greg Noble to reach second. With
his mom in town to watch, Ryan
Turner completed the outfield
sweep by doubling home Solomon
to make it 7-2, but there was more
to come.
Roger Burnett provided the
fifth-consecutive hit to single
home Turner, and Gaels coach

Don Jamerson had decided he had
seen enough. Jim Invaldi came in
to face Chris Kemper and wound
up advancing Burnett while try
ing to make a play at second.
Invaldi got the first out of the
frame by striking out Mark
Skeels, but the innings's ninth
batter, Dave Holbrook, singled
home Burnett to make it 9-2.
Invaldi avoided a messy clogging
of the scorecard by getting pinch

gates swinging. We

game.'

hitter Jeff Light to ground into a
double play and put a stop to the
six-hit offensive onslaught.
"Everybody got into it," said
Dunton, unconsciencely summing
up both the inning and his team's
motivation. "You can't fault the
effort, the guys played hard."
Aaron Dorlarque came in as
relief for starter Steve Worrell to
pick up the win and go 6-1 on the
season. Dorlarque pitched the
middle three innings, allowing a
run on three hits, but his presence
was not due to any problems with
Worrell's start. Worrell pitched
the first three innings strong, get
ting the first two batters to
ground out before a two singles
and a wild pitch combined to bring
the Gaels into an early 1-0 lead.
The lefty quickly settled down

and finished the day responsible
for only three hits and one run.
The junior looked in fine shape to
try for the five innings necessary
for the win, but after recent
surgery on his elbow for bone
chips, the coaching staff is taking
his rehabilitation slowly.
"We are looking at Worrell
closely now," said Dunton. "We
are trying to keep him at short
bursts."
Card Notes
In addition to his home run, Ham
monds also proved some wanna-be
physicists wrong by sending a foul ball
over the back stop and into the press
box. The event was welcomed by ini
tial alarm that quickly turned into
cheers of joy and high fives all around.
"History was made today," said star
baseball SID Gary Migdol, who
deftly avoided the ushers' attempts to
retrieve the now-legendary ball and
quickly inscribed the relect with Ham
monds' name and the date.
"I never thought I'd see it," said
awed scoreboard opperater James
Sununu. The only blot on the other
wise festive moment was Pat
Broun's inability to snag the ball as it
entered the window. As The Voice of
Cardinal baseball, Broun knows only
too well the prestige the crowd
bestows on the lucky fan who catches
a foul ball, yet he elected to insure his
own safety instead. Broun's (in)action
will no doubt perpetuate the myth
that the sports media cannot play the
game and are merely athletic support
ers. The Voice was allowed to slap
hands, but later was deliberated with
contempt and disgust. "My twin girls
would have done better," said Migdol.
Erin and Robin, both one, were
unavailable for comment.

David Cornell has firmly entrenched himself as the Cardinal's des
ignated hitter and the first outfielder off the bench. Yesterday he
walked, stole second and came around to score in Stanford's win
over St. Mary's.
