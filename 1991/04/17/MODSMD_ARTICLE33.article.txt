# Men top Utes

Stanford, perhaps looking ahead to next
weekend's matchups against top-ranked
UCLA and second-ranked USC, slid past Utah
7-2 yesterday at Stanford Tennis Stadium,
clinching the match at No. 2 doubles.
"Most of the guys started slow today, and
Utah is better than people give them credit
for," freshman Ken Pedroza said. "I think next
weekend's matches were in the back of people's
minds a little bit."
"We only beat them 5-4 last year. They
really get pumped up to play us. It wasn't just
that we started off slowly," Jared Palmer said,
giving credit to the Utes.
Whatever the reason was, Stanford looked
sluggish in singles play, especially in the first
sets.
With Alex O'Brien resting for the weekend,
Palmer stepped into the No. 1 singles spot but
never fully got into the match. The Cardinal
sophomore, who is ranked No. 17 in the Volvo
Tennis/Collegiate Rankings, fell to Chris
Entzel 6-4, 6-3.
"I was more concerned with how I was hit
ting the ball today, the depth of my shots, and
not so much with whether I was winning,"
Palmer said. "When I realized it was a tight
match, I got upset with myself for not playing
to win from the start. I self-destructed in the
second set."
"Jared has been playing himself along with
his opponent lately. He's also been struggling
with a few shots, but he'll be ready come this
weekend," asst. coach John Whitlinger said.
Jonathan Stark, who recently changed back
to his old racket (even though Prince stopped
making the dinosaur years ago), also started
slow at No. 2 singles. Stark, who played more
from the baseline yesterday than usual, edged
Ed Peregrino 7-6, 7-5.
At No. 3 singles, Vimal Patel continued his
recent win streak, despite a slow start, with a
7-5, 6-2 victory over Jeff Weichers. Jason Yee
followed suit at No. 4 with a 6-4, 6-2 triumph
over Chris Reilly.
Michael Flanagan gave the Cardinal its
fourth singles win with a 6-4, 6-3 win over
Jason Muterspaw at No. 5 singles.
The most surprising result came at No. 6 as
Utah's Graeme Cox handed senior Glenn
Solomon one of his worst losses ever in a 6-0,6-
1 defeat.
Leading 4-2 after singles, the Cardinal
needed one win in doubles to clinch the match.
Yee and O'Brien provided Stanford with the
clincher in a 6-2, 6-1 pasting of Weichers and
Muterspaw at No. 2 doubles. Moments later,
Stark and Palmer recorded a 6-2, 6-1 victory
over Entzel and Peregrino at No. 1 doubles.
To give the Cardinal its third doubles win,
Patel and Chris Cocotos came back from a
weak first set to down Cox and Reilly 3-6, 6-2,
6-4.
The victory moved Stanford's record to 15-
4, 4-3 in the Pacific 10 Conference.
Third-ranked Stanford now looks forward
to USC Friday and UCLA Saturday. Both the
Trojans and the Bruins beat the Cardinal ear
lier in April in Los Angeles. Because of student
appreciation week, all students with IDs will be
let in free of charge to both afternoon matches
at the Stanford Tennis Stadium.
"In the past, there's been this idea floating
around that we can't lose. Our recent losses
have opened up some people's eyes. This time
we're the underdogs. Hopefully that'll get the
crowd more into it because we really need their
support," Palmer said.
"We'd love to get a lot of people out there at
the stadium. It gets the players juiced when
you've got a big home crowd to play for," co
captain Dan Turbow added.
