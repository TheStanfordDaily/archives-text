# The 						secret to Stanford's sports successes
## 
### 
Just call it an athletic dynasty.
Whether they splash, swing,
throw or dribble, Stanford com
petitors constitute what has to be con
sidered the No. 1 athletic program in
the nation.
Women's tennis: five consecutive
national titles and seven of the last 10.
Men's tennis: three straight NCAA
crowns, 11 team titles over the past 18
years. Five championships and three
runner-up finishes for Cardinal water
polo during the Dante Dettamanti era.
Three national titles and a top
three finish in every "off-year" for
women's swimming. Men's swimming:
three NCAA crowns and 10 consecu
tive Pacific 10 Conference titles. Base
ball: two national championships and
five College World Series appearances
over the past decade. An NCAA title
and a Final Four appearance for
women's hoops in the 90's.
Even football, while currently in a
rebuilding stage, has been competitive
in national and conference play. Men's
basketball has made four consecutive
postseason appearances, and netted an
NIT title last month. Both volleyball
squads are consistently making Final
Four appearances.
What's going on here? Isn't Stan
ford the top academic institution in
the nation? Aren't great athletic pro
grams and great academic programs
supposed to be like Hatfields and
McCoys?
Either athletes aren't as dumb as
the national media makes them out to
be, Stanford lowers its admissions
standards for athletes, or there's some
pretty amazing recruiting going on.
Bingo.
Just call them the sorcerers of
sport. Cardinal coaches are some
how, someway coming up with
out-of-this-world recruits year after
year. Ones who pass the admission
office's strict scrutiny test of a 3.5,
1250 and 10 extracurriculars for an

application acknowledgement.
How do they find so many great stu
dent-athletes? And how do they get
them to choose the Farm over UCLA,
Michigan or even Notre Dame?
"Despite what everyone says about
athletes never studying, there are a lot
of good student-athletes out there,"
said Dettamanti, the water polo guru.
"And with its reputation, Stanford just
sells itself."
While the pickings are slim for bas
ketball and football, the so-called
minor sports still have a decent pool of
high school athletes to consider for the
Farm. Not everyone fits the mold, but
in general top athletes are highly moti
vated individuals with great time man
agement skills (how else could you
spend 35 hours a week under water
and practice at 5 am?!).
Without the lure of top dollars,
swimmers, water polo players and
even tennis players (not everyone wins
on the ATP Tour) consider a good edu
cation the only way to go.
"In basketball too many guys are
thinking of the NBA, and too many
people are helping them though," Det
tamanti added. "[Butl in other sports
they're thinking of the future, and
[athletes] tend to buckle down into
academics and athletics."
Additionally, most of Stanford's
dynasty teams are "country club"
sports, those which are played almost
exclusively by middle class suburban
kids. This scenario, Cardinal coaches
agree, is another boost for the Farm.
Most of the athletes come from back

grounds where education is important.
And where half-scholarships can be
subsidized by mom and pop.
Once the brilliant high school stars
are located, their names are sent to the
athletic department's recruiting office,
then on to the admissions office, with a
letter from the respective coach.
Farm gurus understand the system,
and usually don't even attempt to pull
a fast one on Old Union.
"I don't play around because I don't
want to be rejected and don't want
someone to get in who's going to strug
gle," explained women's tennis coach
Frank Brennan. "I may make myself
clear if I find someone who's a good
student but may not have great scores,
but can add to the school."
No coaches begrudge admission's
denying some of their picks. It's hard
to justify admitting a so-so student
athlete over a valedictorian. But they
do stress the diversity athletes add.
And admissions often agrees. But
even though there are enough smart
jocks to fill recruiting rosters — and
pass the Dean Jean test — there are
dozens of good schools with great ath
letic programs.
How do the wonder-workers get
them to the Farm?
"Stanford is one of a very few — if
not the only — school in the country
that has this type of academic reputa
tion and competes in big-time athlet
ics," baseball coach Mark Marquess
said. "It's appealing to athletes who
want the best of both. Because it's
hard to get in, the academic reputation
is really our strength."
For some sports, such as tennis, the
team has built such a national name
that every junior player wants to come,
regardless of academic ability. Bren
nan regularly gets pestered by 12-year
olds telling him they want to play for
Stanford.
It's tough to get in — how many
4.oers get negged?— but that only

enhances the school's reputation.
"I use the approach that I have the
greatest product in the world to sell —
Stanford University and a Stanford
education," said Brennan. "In addition
I can throw in the No. 1 tennis pro
gram and sunny California."
Ah, California. The state of surf
boards, palm trees and never
ending sun. And sports.
Advantage Stanford. Not many
hockey players chose to hone their
skills in the land of convertibles and
tofu, but its a haven for tennis, water
polo and baseball players. No snow. No
indoor season. Year-round practice. By
the time the Ivy League starts baseball
spring training Stanford has already
played 15 games.
Not many could pass that up. And
they don't.
Once athletes are in, they're as good
as here.
"Just about everybody who gets
accepted comes," said Dettamanti. "We
don't lose many to other schools.
"In the past 14 years I've probably
lost only three players."
Tennis, baseball, swimming and
women's basketball don't have to
share many either, as evidenced by the
squads' annual addition of at least one
of the nation's top competitors — if
not more.
A few athletic admittees are fright
ened away — more by their misconcep
tions than by reality. According to
Brennan a few players psyche them
selves out, convinced that juggling
practice time and class time is just too
much.
They're the losers.
As evidenced by the smiling faces —
and national championship rings — of
their could-have-been teammates.
