# Burghardt making his mark in the middle
## 
### Kevin Jeffery Staff writer 
Three years ago, if you would have
told Joe Burghardt he'd be starting for
the NCAA's eighth-ranked volleyball
team, he'd have laughed in your face ...
but his soon-to-be coach at Loyola High
School would have laughed even louder.
The coach would laugh because he
had just cut Burghardt, then a high
school sophomore, from the volleyball
team for the second-straight season.
Not very prudent judgment, especially
for a coach who should know talent
when he sees it. That's talent, as in
Loyola alums and current Cardinal
players Duncan Blackman, Jimmy
Klein and Chris Wrede.
Burghardt was eventually asked to
join the team midway through that
season, and he went on to earn second
team All-American honors his senior
year. Even so, collegiate volleyball
didn't become a part of Burghardt's
plans.
"I wasn't recruited at all for volley
ball, so I was thinking I would go to an
Ivy League school and try to walk-on
the basketball team. That was until

Fred [Sturm, former Stanford head
coach] and Ruben [Nieves, current
coach] called and showed interest in
me late in the year," said Burghardt.
Sturm and Nieves were likely
attracted to Burghardt as a result of
the success of former Loyola stars
Blackman and Klein, and the divi
dends of that attraction have begun to
pay off sooner than expected.
Burghardt started at middle blocker
for the first time, after spending the
first half of the season at the far
reaches of the bench, in a March 23
exhibition match against California.
He has been in the starting lineup ever
since.
Nieves' move to start Burghardt
came in the midst of the Cardinal's 10-
match league losing streak. As Nieves
said, "Things obviously weren't going
well for us, and Joe was doing a good
job in practice, so I decided to give him
a shot. He had a solid match that night
and played well in the next match
against Ohio State, so I've left him in
there because he earned the spot."
"I was really surprised when Ruben
let me know I was going to start. I had
only played in two other games on a

couple of meaningless points, and it
was a catastrophe. But throughout the
year Ruben had been really supportive,
telling me, 'Keep working hard, and
your chance will come,'" said
Burghardt.
Burghardt has put up impressive
numbers in his new role, namely team
leading totals in hitting percentage
(.464) and blocks per game (1.4). Per
haps his most valuable statistic is his
low hitting error total. His ratio of kills
to errors is more than four to one
(4.40), while the Cardinal's next-best
mark is middle blocker Mike Lowe's
3.11 ratio.
Burghardt is an integral part of
Stanford's solid core of freshman tal
ent. Canyon Ceman has been the sea
son-long starter at the setter position,
and was one of the top two or three
high school recruits last year. The Car
dinal's top defensive specialist is fresh
man J.B. Taylor, and Aaron Mead has
also seen action in the back row.
As a first year player, Burghardt has
wisely looked to seasoned veterans like
Lowe and John Bezmalinovic for guid
ance at the middle blocker position.
"Being a senior, Mike's been around

the block more than anyone here, and
he's really helped me get prepared for
matches by letting me know what to
look for from different players around
the league.
"And blocking has never been the
strongest part of my game, so I take
every pointer I can from Bez, who I
think is one of the WTVA's best block
ers," said Burghardt.
Burghardt added that while he's
"not the most talkative guy out there,"
he really enjoys the team closeness
he's found at Stanford, especially
among the freshman. "We're a close
team, we do a lot off the court together.
But the losing streak was hard for us.
Before the streak, we were confident
and just cruising along. Then we
dropped 10 matches in a row, and it
made us stop and re-evaluate our
everything."
It made them re-evaluate, most
importantly, their goal of making the
postseason WIVA tournament. To earn
a berth, the Cardinal will in all likeli
hood have to pull off the upset of the
season and beat top-ranked USC in
their regular season finale (this Satur
day at Maples Pavilion).
