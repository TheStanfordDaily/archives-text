## Haus Mitt residents learn about $26,000 'slush fund' 
### Amy McConnell 
Haus Mitteleuropa is rich. So rich, in fact, that
residents don't know what to do with the wealth.
Where many University houses keep $1,000 to
$6,000 in reserve for emergency expenditures, resi
dents of the German theme house learned last
Thursday that $26,000 has accumulated during the
12 years since the house was first created.
Row Director Jack Chin said this was the first
time he has ever heard of anything like this happen
ing.
Although Chin detects "some oversights" on the
part of past financial managers, he said the current
financial manager "has done a good job of looking
through the books."
Information about the fund came out last Thurs
day, when a house staff member mentioned it at a
house meeting. House officers and resident fellows
had known about the money but did not tell the res
idents or officials at the Row Office.
In a public memo, house financial manager Paige
Stinnett wrote, "At my discretion, I have not dis
closed the information about Haus Mitt's savings
and have instead kept the savings of previous years
separate from the operating budget of this year."
She explained that before announcing the fund,
she had wanted to "establish strong accounting pro
cedures" and to clarify the tax status of the savings.
"It's not clear why they waited so long to tell us,"
said resident Paul Bailin, a senior. "They claimed
they had tax problems to settle and guidelines to
establish first. That should have taken only a few
weeks; they waited two-thirds of the year."
However, Stinnett said there is "no tradition" of
publicizing information about house savings.
Her predecessor, Shelley Giles, said she and the
RFs feared that "residents would want to use the
money to subsidize their board bills."
"We [the staff) wanted to use the money for
things that would last over multiple years since it
had collected over multiple years," Giles said. "We
decided that if people asked, we'd tell them, but
there was no reason to publicize the exact amount."
Chin confirmed that "managers of student-run
houses should be able to open the books to anyone
who asks" but that it is up to the residents to ask.
"People were given every opportunity to know
that we had plenty of savings, but it was never dis
cussed," said RF Timothy Donahue-Bombosch.
A committee of nine residents has volunteered to
try to deal with the fund. "We won't decide what to
do with the money; we'll just resolve the legal issues
and then give it to the house for a vote," said Bailin,
the committee leader.
Options include investing the money and spend
ing some of the interest on house improvements

such as a laser printer or a pool table; spending some
of the money on improvements and leaving the rest
for next year's residents to use; giving the money to
charity; or splitting the money among current resi
dents, who might then give it back to the house or
donate it to charity.
"We'll probably end up reinvesting the money and
using some of the interest to buy something fun for
the house," said committee member Susan Helfter, a
sophomore.
Like Helfter, Stinnett foresees using the money as
an endowment. "I feel the fund is a legacy for the
house. It's both an opportunity and a big responsibil
ity. Theoretically, if there continues to be a reluc
tance to use it, it's not helping the quality of life at
Haus Mitt."
Most house officers in the past have been reluc
tant to spend money from the fund because they did
not feel it was theirs to spend, Stinnett said. "They
didn't know how to account for the money; it didn't
belong to any one year."
Giles said financial managers always keep some
money on hand to pay for emergencies and house
wear and tear, but an exact amount has never been
set. In addition, residents have always been rebated
money left at the end of the year, but each manager
rebated a different amount.
Financial management has been "done on a year
to-year basis as opposed to having strict guidelines,"
Giles said. "Depending on how conservative financial
managers are, the money collects." She said reserves
have been allowed to build up to cover any unex
pected costs.
Giles suggested that the University might learn
from Haus Mitt's situation. "It would be a good idea
for houses to have a set figure for reserve money. It
isn't mentioned in the handbook that's put out by
the Row Office," she said.
However, Chin said, "I'm not sure if the Row
Office should set any guidelines. We should help
houses manage their money wisely... but self-man
aged houses are ultimately responsible for their
finances."
Since last Thursday, acting Asst. Row Director
Christy Junkerman has been advising Stinnett on
how to proceed.
Helfter said most residents are not very con
cerned. "We all just think it's pretty funny. It's kind
of like a large bookkeeping error."
