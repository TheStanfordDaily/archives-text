# Service, peer counseling close to heart of Pro Fro
## 
### Joanna Sosinska Staff writer 
Amy Kohn, a senior from Rio
Americano High School in
Sacramento, is not just another
prospective freshman visiting
Stanford this week with a 4.0
GPA, a high SAT score and an
exhaustive list of extracurricu
lar activities.
What distinguishes her are
the public service organizations
she has been involved in.
Last December, Kohn, along
with her twin sister Lisa, also a
prospective freshman at Stan
ford, started a peer counseling
group at her school following a
suicide that happened there last
March.
Kohn said she started the
group because "There was no
outlet for students and the
(high school) counselors made
everyone feel worse about the
situation."
"The counselors were really
pushy and intrusive. They were
trying to help, but some people
needed to be left alone," said
Kohn. Most high school coun
selors are only trained to help
students pick their classes and
advise them on their college
choices, not to deal one on one
with the teenagers, Kohn added.
"[The peer counseling group]
would identify at-risk kids and
help them out," said Kohn.
Kohn has also served as a
counselor on a hotline for run
aways during the past three

years.
She said working on the hot
line is a "really good learning
experience that helps you learn
about all different cultures."
"It opens your eyes about
what's going on and shows you
that problems like child abuse
and drug abuse have no socio
economic boundaries," said
Kohn.
In order to be a counselor,
Kohn had to go through an ini
tial interview to make sure she
"had no preconceived notions
about runaways" and attend a
90-hour training course.
Kohn got involved in the hot
line after going to a volunteer
center in Sacramento looking
for a summer job. "I was ini
tially interested in psychology,"
she said.
For the past year-and-a-half,
Kohn has also worked as a
reporter for a Cable TV show,
"Real Show," that airs at a local
station in Sacramento. The
show reports on school activities
and student accomplishments.
Kohn has produced and edited
her own segments for the pro
gram.
Besides Stanford, Kohn was
accepted to Brown University,
Cornell University and the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania. Kohn
said that if she decides to attend
Stanford, she hopes to meyor in
international relations.
"I think of all the schools,
[Stanford] is the best for what
I'm interested in. ... My only

reservation is that I always
wanted to go to school on the
East Coast," she said.
At Stanford, Kohn would like
to get involved in student gov
ernment, work on political cam
paigns and lobby for education
issues.
"I would also like to write for
the newspaper and do things
with radio and television and
continue with the hotline," said
Kohn. "It's a very active cam
pus, and there's a lot to do," she
added.
Among her other involve
ments, Kohn is also business
manager for her school paper
and was on the swim team dur
ing her junior year. Kohn has
also worked as a tour guide for
an Anne Frank exhibit in Sacra
mento.
