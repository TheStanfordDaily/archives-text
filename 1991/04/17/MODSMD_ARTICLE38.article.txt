### Mara Mather Staff writer 
Stanford police have identified where the smoke
bombs that were planted in several sorority tents
Monday evening were purchased, according to Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer.
In addition, police officials said they also have
leads as to who may nave planted the bombs.
Niemeyer said police suspect that a student prob
ably set up the bombs. "Who else would have a
motive?" He said the bombs were clearly intended to
be a prank, perhaps related to "internal problems in
the sorority system, [or it] could be the fraternities."
One bomb exploded at 6 p.m., Niemeyer said. The
device, which was about the size of a flare and resem
bled a paper towel tube, contained white igniter pow
der with a wire hooked up to a clock and a battery, he
added.
Nobody was injured in the explosion, and the
Police Department were notified of the incident until
an hour-and-a-half later, Niemeyer said.
The bombs were set to go off at different times, he
added.
Four other bombs were discovered in other tents,
which were fire-retardant, and were dismantled by
people present, Niemeyer said. The police bomb
technician who later examined the bombs was

The police technician who later
examined the bombs was 'pretty
upset' because the people who
disarmed them could easily have
had their fingers blown off.

"pretty upset" because the people who disarmed
them could easily have had their fingers blown off,
Niemeyer said.
Niemeyer stressed the fact that it was "very, very
dangerous" for the people present to dismantle the
bombs themselves. He said the police could not
locate these people until 10:30 p.m., because by the
time the police were called to the scene, the wit
nesses of the incident were no longer present. He
said the fire department was not notified by those at
the Rush parties.
"I'm really glad nobody got hurt," Niemeyer said.
The bombs were similar to those used as simula
tors in war games. It is a felony, punishable by three,
five or seven years in a state prison, to make an
incendiary device like the bombs, Niemeyer said. He
added that the police "will prosecute."
