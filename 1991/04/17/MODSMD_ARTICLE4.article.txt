# Electronic mail issue settled; senate candidate withdraws
## 
### Howard Libit Staff writer 
The controversy involving the first
major ASSU election bylaws violation
this year has already been settled â€”
before any votes were even cast.
Nawwar Kasrawi, an independent
ASSU Senate candidate affiliated with
the People's Platform, withdrew from the
election late yesterday afternoon in the
wake of a violation of rules prohibiting
mass mailing.

Kasrawi sent elec
tronic mail to more
than 2000 students
Sunday morning endor
sing all of the People's
Platform candidates
and several special fee
requests. The Academic

Information Resource's computer system
was so severely clogged that it filled the
entire space allocated to hold unreceived
mail, according to AIR Director Ralph
Gorin.

An agreement to settle the conflict was
reached between hearings officer Jason
Moore, Kasrawi and members of the Peo
ple's Platform. Kasrawi and Council of
Presidents slate member Jennifer Pear
son were required to submit a letter to
The Daily apologizing and explaining
their actions.
In his letter, Kasrawi said he agreed to
withdraw from the undergraduate senate
race "as retribution for what infractions I
may or may not have committed."
In an interview last night, Kasrawi

admitted that he had "doubts" about the
legitimacy of his actions with respect to
AIR policy but felt "stuck in the middle of
vague campaign rules."
Both Kasrawi and Pearson said no one
besides Kasrawi was aware of the extent
of the electronic mail plan.
"Specifically, I did not discuss in any
significant detail either the contents or
the timing of the mailing with any of the
named parties," Kasrawi said in the let
ter.
No further discussion on the electronic

mail problem will take place, Moore said.
"Based upon this compromise, I will
not pursue this issue any further. It is a
dead issue," Moore said. "It will not be
pursued by AIR nor will there be any fur
ther sort of disqualification proceedings."
The agreement was based upon an
informal investigation begun by Moore.
Moore previously said he would not be
able to begin an investigation until after
the polls closed Thursday night, but he

changed his mind to solve the
issue quickly.
"We made the compromise for
two reasons. We wanted to pre
serve the integrity of the election
process and put this issue behind
us," Moore said. "We also wanted
to preserve the integrity of the
ASSU and avoid a repeat of last
year's controversy."
Reaction from the other par
ties to the agreement was mixed.
"I appreciate that the People's
Platform and Nawwar (Kasrawi)
are willing to take responsibility
for their actions," Students First
COP slate member Beth Morgan
said in a statement for her slate.
"I take this as an encouraging
sign that People's Platform has
recognized the need to start play
ing fairly and by the rules."
Michael Schreiber of the Ham
mer and Coffin-sponsored "Click
Here for Fee Refund" slate called
the agreement "bogus" and
"underhanded."
"Without a doubt Nawwar
(Kasrawi) is the scapegoat for the
People's Platform," Schreiber
said. "He is taking a hard fall for
the rest of the People's Platform
candidates."
But Kasrawi said that
although he "did not particularly
want to withdraw," under the cir
cumstances it is "the best solu
tion" to an "unfortunate situa
tion."
Moore held several meetings
before reaching this compromise.
People's Platform, Students First
and the Hammer and Coffin Soci
ety were all invited to attend a
meeting on the matter Monday
afternoon.
Only People's Platform and
Students First representatives
attended and a thorough discus
sion of the issues took place,
according to people who partici
pated. Moore would not discuss
the closed-door meeting, but Mor
gan said she did not want to
accept any compromise in Mon
day's meeting.
"Jason came into the meeting
wanting an agreement, but it was
not my position to make one,"
Morgan said. "Because the mes
sage endorsed everyone associ
ated with People's Platform, it
affected every other COP slate, all
senate candidates and every spe
cial fee request.
A meeting yesterday afternoon
involving People's Platform can
didates and current COP member
Goodwin Liu achieved the final
compromise, which was the "best
possible solution for the candi
dates and the election process,"
Moore said.
