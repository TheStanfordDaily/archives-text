### Howard Libit Staff writer 
The controversy involving the first
major ASSU election bylaws violation
this year has already been settled â€”
before any votes were even cast.
Nawwar Kasrawi, an independent
ASSU Senate candidate affiliated with
the People's Platform, withdrew from the
election late yesterday afternoon in the
wake of a violation of rules prohibiting
mass mailing.

Kasrawi sent elec

than 2000 students
Sunday morning endor
sing all of the People's
Platform candidates
and several special fee
requests. The Academic

Information Resource's computer system

In his letter, Kasrawi said he agreed to
withdraw from the undergraduate senate
race "as retribution for what infractions I
may or may not have committed."
In an interview last night, Kasrawi

admitted that he had "doubts" about the
legitimacy of his actions with respect to
AIR policy but felt "stuck in the middle of
vague campaign rules."
Both Kasrawi and Pearson said no one
besides Kasrawi was aware of the extent
of the electronic mail plan.
"Specifically, I did not discuss in any
significant detail either the contents or
the timing of the mailing with any of the
named parties," Kasrawi said in the let

No further discussion on the electronic

mail problem will take place, Moore said.
"Based upon this compromise, I will
not pursue this issue any further. It is a
dead issue," Moore said. "It will not be
pursued by AIR nor will there be any fur
ther sort of disqualification proceedings."
The agreement was based upon an
informal investigation begun by Moore.
Moore previously said he would not be
able to begin an investigation until after
the polls closed Thursday night, but he
