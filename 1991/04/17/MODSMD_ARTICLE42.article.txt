# Slate joins senior class presidents race
## 
### Howard Libit Staff writer 
The senior class presidents election might
be a race after all.

The "A New Cent-
Sation" slate will no
longer run unopposed in
the election, which is
held today and tomor
row.
A new slate, "Signifi
cant Other," has begun a

write-in campaign to "give the campus a
choice," said member Jay Pinto. Seven
slates vied for the position in last year's elec
tion.
The only slate to appear on the ballot is
"A New Cent-Sation," but voters can type
"Significant Other" in the write-in space on
the computer ballot. The slate has officially
registered with elections commissioner Raul
Lopez.
Both slates agree that the senior class
president is basically a "social coordinator"
and that the campaign is "not political at
all."

"The senior class presidents' job is to
bring the class together," said "New Cent-
Sation" slate member Damien Atkins. "I
want to make sure that all of next year's
seniors enjoy themselves and go out with a
big bang."
Joining Atkins on "A New Cent-Sation"
are Verna Kuo, Patrick McDaniel and Jen
nifer Steele. Members of "Significant
Other" are Pinto, Lee Bennett, Monique
Coughran and Gary Cruz.
The traditional responsibilities of the
senior class presidents include a combina
tion of "formal and social events," said cur
rent senior class president Dave Asch.
Among these events are weekly senior pub
nights, senior weekend, "Disorientation,"
senior formal and football tailgate parties.
The senior class presidents also are mem
bers of the commencement speaker selection
committee.
The Centennial Celebration added some
duties to this year's senior class presidents.
They had to help organize the opening cere
mony and coordinate Parent's Weekend and
Founder's Weekend.
Increasing participation in senior events

is the main focus of both slates.
Atkins said "A New Cent-Sation" would
restore office hours in the senior class presi
dents' office in the ASSU and heavily publi
cize senior events, perhaps through a
monthly advertisement in The Daily.
"As time goes on in the year, the same
corps of people attend every event. Many
seniors simply do not know what is going
on," Atkins said. "Publicity is a big part of
getting more people involved."
"Significant Other" would hold office
hours in White Plaza and run senior forums
to solicit ideas from seniors, Pinto said. The
slate would also try to increase the publicity
of senior events.
"We want to make sure the traditional
events have participation from everyone,"
Bennett said. "We would have a lot of public
ity and keep the events from getting too
expensive."
With only two registered slates, Asch said
this year's election will be very different
from last year's.
"With a lot of slates, the campaign gets
too intense. It should be fun for everyone
involved," he said.
