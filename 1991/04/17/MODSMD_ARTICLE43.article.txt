# Grad students upset over loss of housing
## 
### Judy Hsu Staff writer 
Graduate students will lose 75
on-campus housing spaces as a
result of the construction of Kim
ball Hall and two other dormito
ries on the site.
Kimball Hall will house 200
undergraduate students. The
other two houses — now called
Manzanita II — will each hold 100
upper-class students.
These two new projects, which
reflect the University's goal of
providing housing for all under
graduate students, will bring
undergraduates a step closer to
having guaranteed housing for
four years.
The building of Kimball Hall,
currently under construction,
required the removal of about 20
trailers. Manzanita 11, scheduled
to be completed by the fall of
1992, will take 40 trailers away by
October.
Rodger Whitney, director of the
Housing Center, said the ratio of

graduate to undergraduate stu
dents living in the trailers now is
approximately one to one. After
the next set of trailers is removed,
however, more graduates may be
living in Manzanita than under
graduates, he said.
The projects "won't affect fam
ilies and couples" because only
single graduate students are
housed in Manzanita, said Direc
tor of Graduate Residences Jean
Kim.
Kim said, "There isn't much
we can do [for the graduate stu
dents] because there is a commit
ment to house undergraduates
first."
Graduate students are con
cerned.
James Vera, a graduate ASSU
senator, has "mixed feelings"
about the University's plans.
Although he doesn't think anyone
will "lament the passing of Man
zanita, graduate students have
just as difficult a time finding
housing off campus as under
grads."

"Manzanita is not the first
graduate housing that's been
taken away lately," he added,
referring to Crothers Memorial
Hall, which has been integrated
into a mixed residence with both
graduate and undergraduate stu
dents.
The gradual removal of Man
zanita trailers will reverse the
effect created by the opening of
the Rains Houses four years ago,
which opened up 800 spaces and
allowed the University to house
3000 graduate students.
Vera said he understands the
University might feel that under
graduates are less prepared for
the rigors of college life and need
to live on campus, "but the gradu
ate students' need in housing can
not be dismissed."
Elizabeth Wahl, another gradu
ate senator, agreed that the trail
ers are inadequate residences and
need to be replaced, but said she
doesn't see the number of spaces
available as the real problem.
Instead, she said, there is "a

real resentment" among graduate
students about the high price of
rent they have to pay for on-cam
pus housing. They feel that the
profit garnered by their rent,
which goes into the general hous
ing fund, should be reinvested
toward improving living condi
tions, especially in Escondido Vil
lage, said Wahl.
"I think it's ridiculous," gradu
ate student Sherry Schleicher said
of the plan. "On this campus grad
uate students are overlooked in
many ways, and this is just
another example of it."
Kimball and Manzanita II are
part of the University's long-term
plans, which also include building
more graduate school housing and
providing on-campus housing for
all students.
The third phase of the Univer
sity's plan, called Manzanita 111,
"will not be on the drawing board
for three to four years," said Kim.
This project may provide enough
spaces to give all graduates on
campus housing.
