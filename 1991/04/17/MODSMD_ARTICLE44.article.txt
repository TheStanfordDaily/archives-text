# Software will guard against loss of votes
## 
### Miranda Doyle Staff writer 
Although computer crashes
may have caused problems count
ing votes in last year's ASSU elec
tion, new software should elimi
nate problems in the election that
begins today, said elections com
missioner Raul Lopez.
"There was a possibility of votes

being lost (last
year). There is
no possibility
this year," Lopez
said. He explain
ed that several
computers froze
or were turned

off during the
last election, forcing election staff
to rename files so they could be
counted.
Last year's elections commis
sioner, Steve Krauss, said that
while there were problems, he
does not believe any votes were
lost last year.
The only ballots affected by the
crashes were the ones belonging
to the people voting when the
problem occurred, he said. "We
were able to confirm that every
one had renamed voter files,"
Krauss added.
The problems could have been
an important factor in last year's
election because of the closeness
of the Council of Presidents race.
People's Platform's "Four Our
Future" slate won over Students
First's "A Clean Slate" by only 61
votes.
Lopez said there will be three
copies of all ballots this year so if
any votes are lost, back-up ver
sions will exist. "After each voter
finishes, we will write the infor
mation to the hard drive and a

floppy disk," Lopez said. In addi
tion, a second copy will be made
on the hard drive as part of the
program.
"Last year, there was a lot more
human intervention. Whenever
the computer died or froze, a per
son had to manually change the
file names," said Lopez. "That left
the possibility of losing votes."
The multiple copies and new soft
ware should make this interven
tion unnecessary, he added.
A professional programmer has
created an automatic ballot
maker for this year which should
eliminate computer crashes,
Lopez said. The new software
allowed election officials to create
the ballot using last year's pro
gram instead of writing a new one.
Since last 3*ear's crashes may
have been due to bugs created in
writing a new program, using the
automatic ballot-maker should
prevent problems, Krauss said.
Votes will also be counted dif
ferently this year, Lopez said. Last
year, vote files were copied onto
separate disks and then tallied at
a master computer. The process
has at least three links — bringing
the files to the master computer,
tallying the votes, and finally
putting the information into a
spreadsheet.
A recount last year found a
slight difference in vote totals.
Lopez said he believes the count
ing process was unreliable and
was the reason for the difference.
"I think the votes were there,
but were not counted right," he
said. He plans to eliminate some
of the links by going from com
puter to computer and copying the
files onto one disk, then tallying
the votes in one place.
