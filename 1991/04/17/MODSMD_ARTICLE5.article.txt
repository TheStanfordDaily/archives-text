## Nude models help students improve, tap artistic talents 
### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Staff writer 
In an upstairs studio of the Cummings Art Build
ing, Bill — fit and trim — assumes center stage to act
out what may be the world's second oldest profes
sion.
"Look at the lines that run through Bill's body,"
the professor tells more than a dozen attentive stu
dents seated at easels. "Notice how he looks."
Bill would be hard to miss — perched atop a raised
platform, he has no clothes on.
But for the students of Drawing 2, an Art Depart
ment class, Bill is more than a professional poser
with a purpose. He represents a high form of artistic
being that traces its roots to antiquity — Bill is the
nude.
"Models play an incredible role in art," explained
Art Prof. Nathan Oliveira, instructor of the class.
"The drawings that students make from Bill are a
commentary on our time. We are humans in the '90s
making a statement about humanity today through
art," he said.
A tradition of using nude models in art has
existed for several centuries, said Betsy Fryberger, a
curator at the Stanford Art Museum. DaVinci,
Michelangelo and Boticelli all used nude models.
Likenesses of men and women an naturel can also
be seen on ancient Roman mosaics, tapestries and
frescoes. Human figures are also
found on prehistoric cave walls.
Although the effort to draw the
human body has challenged the
imagination, skill and diligence of
artisans of the past, an artistic
devotion to the human figure can
be found in modern-day students
like those in Oliveira's class.
"I take what I see and put it on
paper. Basically it helps in the
drawing of proportions," said
sophomore Jen Torres, a prospec
tive design major. "At first the
nude was a little bit of a shock.
But after a while it wasn't such a
big deal. You get used to it.
"If I walked down the street
and saw someone naked it would
be kind of weird, but this is an art
class. You've got to expect it," she
added.
The nude is considered to be a
fundamental part of live art, one
of two general categories of art.
The other is still life, which uses
inanimate objects.
"What people in this class are
doing here people did in earlier
centuries. It's what Leonardo
tried to do," Oliveira said.
Art schools have long used
nude models to improve the abil
ity of artists to draw complex fig
ures with different shades, angles
and depths. A crucial stage in the
development of the artist, practice
in drawing the musculature and
form makes students perceptive
artists, according to art experts.
Kelvin Yip, a senior mechanical

engineer, was drawn to the class
because he wanted to take some
thing that he really enjoyed and
was not as taxing as his engineer
ing studies. "This is a real serious
study," said Yip, who studied art
in high school and took Drawing
1. "The live model is harder to
draw. I mean, an orange is an
orange — it's round. A human is
more of a challenge to draw," he
said.
Not all students manage to
draw finely curved, proportional
lines at first. Senior Freddie
Narez said that his first rendi
tions earlier in the quarter were
stick figures — more Rorschach
like than refined — but he said he
has improved. "I've gotten pretty
good at it,"he said, glancing at
one of his charcoal sketches.
Other students like senior Jay
Lopez were more humble: "I'm
not really good at it, but it is really
fun to try and get better."
Despite the artistic merits of
the class, some nattering nabobs
of negativism have perceived nude
modeling as a potential form of
exploitation.
"Exploitation of the models has
no part in what we are doing. The
models are professionals and are
part of a guild," Oliveira said.
Narez said, "You look at things
differently and see the nude as an
object for artistic purpose. You
think, 'Oh that's just the model
up there. I have to draw it.' Not,
'Oh, let's draw the naked
woman.'"
Torres agreed, adding, "The
use of female models bothers me
less than it would a guy."
In the years Oliveira has

taught the course, he has had to
turn back voyeurs who have come
to the class to look at the models,
even though the doors to the stu
dio are clearly labeled with "no
visitor" signs.
Despite occasional interrup
tions by curious students, the
class has remained a serious vehi
cle for the pursuit of art.
In a recent class, Bill switches
poses on his model stand every 15
seconds, in synchronization with
a beeping timer. Students hurry
to sketch a figure before Bill
changes poses again. "Trust your
instincts," Oliveira implores stu
dents against the hurried sound
of scratching charcoal on paper.
"Move your arm in a smooth man
»»
ner.
"Good. Good lines," he tells a
student, craning over the stu
dent's shoulder. The student's
sketch is of the nude — his back
arched, his muscles taut and defi
ant and his searching gaze scan
ning the classroom.
"The lines of the nude act as a
word, a vocabulary, a language,"
the short-set Oliveira explains
during a break in the class. "It
articulates meaning. It talks of
energy and motion."
Oliveira said he hopes students
will gain two things from the
class. "They will become less
afraid to draw pictures, and they
will trust themselves and be will
ing to make mistakes," he said.
"Ninety-nine-point-nine per
cent of these students won't
become professional artists. But
when they see a work of art in the
future, this class will help them
appreciate it even more."

tried to do," Oliveira said.
Art schools have long used
nude models to improve the abil
ity of artists to draw complex fig
ures with different shades, angles
and depths. A crucial stage in the
development of the artist, practice
in drawing the musculature and
form makes students perceptive
artists, according to art experts.
Kelvin Yip, a senior mechanical

engineer, was drawn to the class
because he wanted to take some
thing that he really enjoyed and
was not as taxing as his engineer
ing studies. "This is a real serious
study," said Yip, who studied art
in high school and took Drawing
1. "The live model is harder to
draw. I mean, an orange is an
orange — it's round. A human is
more of a challenge to draw," he
said.
Not all students manage to
draw finely curved, proportional
lines at first. Senior Freddie
Narez said that his first rendi
tions earlier in the quarter were
stick figures — more Rorschach
like than refined — but he said he
has improved. "I've gotten pretty
good at it,"he said, glancing at
one of his charcoal sketches.
Other students like senior Jay
Lopez were more humble: "I'm
not really good at it, but it is really
fun to try and get better."
Despite the artistic merits of
the class, some nattering nabobs
of negativism have perceived nude
modeling as a potential form of
exploitation.
"Exploitation of the models has
no part in what we are doing. The
models are professionals and are
part of a guild," Oliveira said.
Narez said, "You look at things
differently and see the nude as an
object for artistic purpose. You
think, 'Oh that's just the model
up there. I have to draw it.' Not,
'Oh, let's draw the naked
woman.'"
Torres agreed, adding, "The
use of female models bothers me
less than it would a guy."
In the years Oliveira has

taught the course, he has had to
turn back voyeurs who have come
to the class to look at the models,
even though the doors to the stu
dio are clearly labeled with "no
visitor" signs.
Despite occasional interrup
tions by curious students, the
class has remained a serious vehi
cle for the pursuit of art.
In a recent class, Bill switches
poses on his model stand every 15
seconds, in synchronization with
a beeping timer. Students hurry
to sketch a figure before Bill
changes poses again. "Trust your
instincts," Oliveira implores stu

of scratching charcoal on paper.

"Good. Good lines," he tells a
student, craning over the stu
dent's shoulder. The student's
sketch is of the nude — his back
arched, his muscles taut and defi
ant and his searching gaze scan
ning the classroom.
"The lines of the nude act as a
word, a vocabulary, a language,"
the short-set Oliveira explains
during a break in the class. "It
articulates meaning. It talks of
energy and motion."
Oliveira said he hopes students
will gain two things from the
class. "They will become less
afraid to draw pictures, and they
will trust themselves and be will
ing to make mistakes," he said.
"Ninety-nine-point-nine per
cent of these students won't
become professional artists. But
when they see a work of art in the
future, this class will help them
appreciate it even more."

In an upstairs studio of the Cummings Art Build
ing, Bill — fit and trim — assumes center stage to act
out what may be the world's second oldest profes
sion.
"Look at the lines that run through Bill's body,"
the professor tells more than a dozen attentive stu
dents seated at easels. "Notice how he looks."
Bill would be hard to miss — perched atop a raised
platform, he has no clothes on.
But for the students of Drawing 2, an Art Depart
ment class, Bill is more than a professional poser
with a purpose. He represents a high form of artistic
being that traces its roots to antiquity — Bill is the
nude.
"Models play an incredible role in art," explained
Art Prof. Nathan Oliveira, instructor of the class.
"The drawings that students make from Bill are a
commentary on our time. We are humans in the '90s
making a statement about humanity today through
art," he said.
A tradition of using nude models in art has
existed for several centuries, said Betsy Fryberger, a
curator at the Stanford Art Museum. DaVinci,
Michelangelo and Boticelli all used nude models.
Likenesses of men and women an naturel can also
be seen on ancient Roman mosaics, tapestries and
frescoes. Human figures are also
found on prehistoric cave walls.
Although the effort to draw the
human body has challenged the
imagination, skill and diligence of
artisans of the past, an artistic
devotion to the human figure can
be found in modern-day students
like those in Oliveira's class.
"I take what I see and put it on
paper. Basically it helps in the
drawing of proportions," said
sophomore Jen Torres, a prospec
tive design major. "At first the
nude was a little bit of a shock.
But after a while it wasn't such a
big deal. You get used to it.
"If I walked down the street
and saw someone naked it would
be kind of weird, but this is an art
class. You've got to expect it," she
added.
The nude is considered to be a
fundamental part of live art, one
of two general categories of art.
The other is still life, which uses
inanimate objects.
"What people in this class are
doing here people did in earlier
centuries. It's what Leonardo
tried to do," Oliveira said.
