# New USW field representative to be named this week
## 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
The United Stanford Workers will
announce within a week the replacement
for field representative Rodney Barnette,
who left in February after seven years with
the union.
Barnette said in an interview yesterday
that he left the USW to pursue a "better
opportunity" and that the departure was a
friendly one.
According to field representative Ruben
Serna, the USW has posted notices about
the position since mid-February in other
labor unions around the Bay Area. A deci
sion will be made in four or five days.
The field representatives are responsible
for enforcing and administering the
union's labor agreement with the Univer
sity. Where the contract falls short in pro
tecting workers, "the field representative
leans on state and federal laws," Serna
said.
The field representative also acts as a
form of paralegal — dealing with work

related issues that might not be covered in
the contract and federal laws — and as a
social worker, who can help the workers
with personal problems, Serna said. He
said field representatives are often involved
in political lobbying.
Barnette, who came to the USW in 1984
after working as a longshoreman, was
involved in negotiating the 1984, 1985 and
1988 contracts between the USW and the
University.
When he arrived at Stanford, the USW
had recently voted to become a part of the
larger Santa Clara County Local 715 of the
Service Employees International Union.
After the vote, the University decided not
to recognize the union in what Barnette
called an attempt to terminate the USW.
According to Barnette, the National
Labor Relations Board had threatened to
prosecute the University for its action. To
avoid an extended lawsuit, Barnette said he
organized the workers' vote to leave the
Local 715 and reorganize as Local 680.
Barnette said one of his successes as a
field representative was working to reduce

USW officers Mike Tatham
and Sammy Brooks have
taken up the slack since
Barnette's departure.
'We've been kind of short
handed.'

the number of racist incidents against
workers and convincing workers to report
such activity to the Civil Rights Commis
sion in San Francisco, which confronted
the University in a public tribunal seven
years ago.
He said last year's contract situation at
Webb Ranch was "really dear to me." The
berry ranch and horse stable facility on the
edge of campus was the site of a year-long
conflict between the USW arid the Webb
family over the living conditions of the
migrant farm workers there. The ranch
has been leased by the Webb family from

the University since 1922.
"At one point the campaign ran into
trouble, and I was asked to come in and
regroup it," Barnette said. The workers
were awarded a better contract in April
1990, and they also voted to join the USW.
Barnette said he wished he could have
done more work on organizing other non
union campus workers, such as the clerical
and hospital workers.
Linda Crouse, chief steward from 1985
to 1990, praised Barnette for his willing
ness to speak out on controversial issues.
She said he has "a certain toughness and
edge but a sympathy for people," a positive
combination which she said is rare in field
representatives.
Serna said Barnette has a strong sense
of social justice and was respected by work
ers. "He could look at a problem three
dimpnsionally, not just two-dimensionally,"
Serna said.
