ALL FACULTY INVITED
FUNDING AND MORALE
IN THE
RESEARCH COMMUNITY
A Dialogue with
Leon M. Lederman
Director Emeritus,
Fermi National Laboratory
and
President, American Associaiton
for the
Advancement of Science
9:30 - 11:30 a.m.
Friday, April 19, 1991
LOCATION: OAKWEST ROOM
IN TRESIDDER UNION
Dr. Lederman, who received the Nobel Prize in physics in 1988, recently
conducted an anecdotal survey of morale among science faculty in selected
U.S. universities. His report, entitled Science: The Etui of the Frontier? pub
lished as a supplement to the January 11, 1991 issue of Science magazine,
suggests that despite significant increases in the budgets for key science agen
cies in recent years, the funding situation of individual researchers is becom
ing increasingly difficult. The report has stirred considerable discussion in the
press and the scientific community.
This meeting will provide an opportunity to discuss the report's findings and
suggest options for action to follow up the report's recommendation for a
major increase in funding for academic research. Accompanying Dr. Leder
man will be Dr. Albert H. Teich, Director of Science and Policy programs
at the AAAS national office in Washington, D.C., who will discuss the
federal budget situation and the President's proposed budget for research in
FY 1992. This meeting is sponsored by the AAAS Pacific Division and the
Directorate for Science and Policy Programs.
Copies of Science: The End of the Frontier? will be available at the meeting.
For further informaiton, call the Office of the Dean of Research at 3-0977
or the AAAS Directorate for Science and Policy Programs at 202-326-6600.
