# Bonuses added for '91 grads

### Sarah Morisseau Staff writer 
Celebrating Stanford's centen
nial will be an important theme in
this year's Commencement, from
Centennial pins and diploma hold
ers to special decorations in Stan
ford Stadium.
Graduates will receive a com
memorative pin and a unique
diploma case to celebrate their
place in Stanford's 100 th graduat
ing class. The pin is round with
the Centennial seal in the middle,
and around the edges it reads,
"Stanford Centennial Commence
ment 1991."
The pins will be handed out to
graduating seniors during the
Commencement ceremony.
The diploma case will read
"Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity Diploma of Graduation" as it
does every year, but this year it
will also bear the pin design
stamped in gold.
In addition, the Stanford Sta
dium field will be specially deco
rated for the ceremony. Most
likely, there will be banners bear
ing the Centennial design, but a
final decision has not yet been
made, said Susan Wolfe, assistant
director of the Centennial Cele
bration.
In addition, the Centennial
Committee is also investigating
the possibility of putting the Cen
tennial logo on the grass of the
field.
The 100 th Commencement is
"a special occasion for the Univer
sity, and particularly for the grad
uates," Wolfe said. "But it is also
an academic occasion, which is
why we decided to enhance the
diploma holder."
Wolfe said discussions on how
to incorporate Commencement
into the Centennial Celebration
have been going on for more than
a year.
The cost for this year's changes
in the Commencement exercises is
"surprisingly little," Wolfe said.
Wolfe added that Commence
ment will actually be "pretty regu
lar," except for the fact that some
people still think Gen. Norman
Schwarzkopf will be the gradua
tion speaker.
She is referring to a joke story
that appeared in The Daily's April
Fool's issue which reported that
the commander of allied forces in
the Persian Gulf war would speak
at Stanford.
"People are still coming up to
me and saying, 'Isn't it great?'
And then there are others who
say, 'How could they invite him?"'
Wolfe said. "I can't believe they
haven't caught on yet."
