# Congress moves to end rail strike quickly
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Congress pressed yester
day to put a quick end to a coast-to-coast strike by
235,000 rail workers that threatened an already pre
carious U.S. economy.
Lawmakers and members of the Bush
administration met behind closed doors to consider
proposals to end the walkout while an emergency
review board considered contract disputes between
the freight carriers and their unions.
Administration officials said they opposed an
extended "cooling off" period.
At a congressional hearing just an hour after the
walkout began, Transportation Secretary Samuel
Skinner said there was a "sense of urgency" to end
the strike quickly — preferably before "tomorrow's
rush hour."
Members of Congress agreed with the need for
fast action.

"A rail strike that took any period of time to
resolve would be devastating" to the economy
already mired in recession, said House Speaker
Thomas Foley, D-Wash. He said a House vote on leg
islation ending the walkout could come late
yesterday or today.
The Senate was expected to take up whatever bill
the House passed, rather than drafting its own.
"Given the nature of the economy, it is important
to act in a timely fashion," said Senate Labor Com
mittee Chairman Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.
White House spokesperson Marlin Fitzwater said
the immediate cost of the strike was $50 million a
day. That could rise to $630 million daily if the walk
out goes on for two weeks, he said.
The strike shut down cargo traffic and upset pas
senger travel around the country.
Amtrak's busiest region, the Northeast corridor

from Washington to Boston, was not affected
because Amtrak owns that track. But passengers
aboard Amtrak trains in other regions had their
trips halted well short of their destinations.
Behind the scenes, congressional leaders and
members of the administration discussed creating a
new review board that would study wage and work
rule issues during a cooling off period. At issue was
how long that cooling off period should last, with
proposals ranging from 30 days to 120 days, and how
many contract disputes would be revisited.
"The idea that there would be a lengthy period in
which major issues could come back on the table is
just not a starter with the administration," a senior
administration source said. "We do not see being in
the best interest of the public, or the economy." The
source spoke on condition of anonymity.
The administration asked Congress to immedi
ately impose a settlement proposed in January by a
presidential emergency board.
"My personal opinion is that it is a pretty good
plan," Skinner said. "But I'm willing to listen. I've
not drawn a line in the sand."
Rep. Dennis Eckart, D-Ohio, responded: "Efforts
to force the PEB (presidential emergency board) rec
ommendations down everyone's throat ain't going
nowhere. Everybody's going to have to show some
flexibility."
Railroads also had hoped Congress would simply
adopt the presidential panel's recommendations
from January.
"It's a little hard for me to see how a new board is
going to do anything but put off the inevitable," said
Michael Walsh, chairman of the Union Pacific and
the Association of American Railroads.
Union leaders would prefer a second board be
appointed, contending that the first one would
require them to accept too many wage and work rule
concessions.
They rejected any suggestions that Congress call
off the strike and order them back to the bargaining
table. Their hope is that the walkout would force the
carriers to resume negotiations.
"A simple extension, I don't see, would do any
thing unless somebody would tell them (the rail
roads) to negotiate," said Fred Hardin, president of
the United Transportation Union representing
100,000 train crewmen. "We would just be faced
with the same crisis in 30 to 60 days."
Last-ditch bargaining failed to produce a settle
ment before the midnight Tuesday expiration of an
initial cooling-off period. The strike began at 7 a.m.
after the unions continued to reject the presidential
board's recommendations.
Three unions representing about one-third of the
nation's 235,000 union rail workers have reached
agreement with the carriers. But the companies and
eight other unions remain far apart on various over
time provisions, the size of train crews and other
work rules.
