CA-1:
Defines the scope of ASSU
O YES <ยง NO
CA-3:
Updates ASSU Constitution
<ยง> YES O NO
CA-4:
Makes ASSU accountable
(ยง) YES O NO

The ASSU is not sufficiently
accountable to the students whom
it represents. CA-1 goes too far,
forcing a nearly complete ban on
any statements by the ASSU on
"off-campus" issues.
CA-3 encodes into the ASSU
constitution policies and proce
dures already part of existing prac
tice, as well making the document
gender-neutral.
CA-4, in contrast to CA-1, will
inject accountability into Stan
ford's student government.
