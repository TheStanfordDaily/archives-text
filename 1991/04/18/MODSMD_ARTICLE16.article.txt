## The 						colorful majority 
### 
Even after the annexation
of California to the United States,
Mexicans continued to be the
numerical majority in the state, until
1850. Gradually, the Mexican population
became dispossessed of its lands and the
burgeoning white-American population
gained political and economic control.
The new white-American majority rede
fined California politics and culture.
The white-American population is
expected to continue to be the numerical
m£yority in the state — but only until the
year 2003, when California's "minori
ties," as they are called, are projected to
become the majority of California's popu
lation.
California in the 21st century will be a
truly multiracial and multicultural state
— the most diverse in the nation. The
Latino and Asian populations are
expected to account for most of the fore
casted increase. Part of this increase may
be attributed to immigration, but much
of it also is due to the fact that the native
people of color, especially Latinos, repro
duce at dramatically higher rates than
white Californians.
The spectrum of colors that will exist
in California will undoubtedly challenge
America's racial thinking, which often
revolves around blacks and whites.
California's white population, itself
becoming a minority, may also discover
that it has an ethnicity of its own.
Additionally, great disparities will exist
between the different groups. The white
California population will be older and
more affluent; the people of color will be
much younger and poorer.

It is amazing how much the new cen
sus figures seem to threaten California's
white population. Newspaper articles and
columns focus on "how the white popula
tion will deal with these demographic
changes."
There is already, among some sectors
of Californians, a growing paranoia about
the forecasted majority. I read reports of
civilian vigilantes who go to the US-Mex
ican border near San Diego and shine
spotlights on passing immigrants in order
to aid the immigration officers.
A friend of mine who is now a success
ful Stanford graduate working in the Los
Angeles area boasted good-naturedly that
he didn't feel threatened because, after
all, he was "a privileged white male."
Truthfully, the emerging population of
color really doesn't pose a threat to the
dominant one. Asians and Latinos are
both poorly organized. Blacks are decades
ahead of the Asian and Latino communi
ties in political organization; blacks
remain an example of strong political
organization for other communities of
color.
But Latinos are beginning to take
some steps to increase our political repre
sentation. In Los Angeles County, where
the Latino population is equal to the
white population, Latinos were finally
given the opportunity to elect a Latina to
the previously all-white, all-male Board of
Supervisors. This occurred only after a
lengthy court battle that forced the board
to redistrict the county. Gloria Molina's
victory marks only the beginning of a
long, obstacle-filled road to political
empowerment for Latinos.

The new white minority is not doomed
to repeat the fate of the old 19th century
Mexican "Californios." Unless some truly
unforeseeable set of events changes the
current course of California history, peo
ple of color are unlikely to dispossess the
white minority of their property or even
achieve political parity with them.
The system is not welcoming or inclu
sive enough of the new majority. The
same system of racial hierarchy that
exists under the current system is likely
to continue into the next phase of Califor
nia history. The xenophobia is, therefore,
largely unjustified.
Unfortunately, competition is more
likely to flare up among the different peo
ple of color groups, and the entire grow
ing underclass, who will find themselves
competing for the same housing, jobs,
social services and other scarce resources.
No one "community" can claim more
of a right to California than anyone else.
The current demographic changes are
just another passage of a different chap
ter of California history. It will be a color
ful and exciting chapter, for California
will contain a racial and cultural mixture
unlike anything this country has seen.
