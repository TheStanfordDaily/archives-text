People's Platform has
accomplished much
for graduate students
In its endorsement of "Students
First" for the Council of Presidents race,
The Daily claims that the "ASSU has
tended to focus on undergraduate issues
and programs, neglecting the input and
the concerns of graduate students," and
suggests that the inclusion of ASSU Sen
ator John Overdeck as part of this slate
will help to answer the issue of graduate
students' concerns at Stanford.
A careful look at the legislative record
of this year's graduate senators neither
warrants this optimistic endorsement of
Overdeck nor this implicit denigration of
the efforts of current People's Platform
graduate senators to address issues
affecting the graduate community.
The People's Platform senators have
authored or co-sponsored bills to support
a diversified faculty, Stanford's ground
breaking domestic partners policy, bene
fits parity for faculty and staff same-gen
der couples, the Women's Herstory Cele
bration and a comprehensive child-care
bill that involved direct outreach to
child-care facilities.
These same senators are also respond
ing to student concerns about changes in
minority fellowship funding, the high
cost of rent in Escondido Village and the
threats posed to financial aid by the expi
ration of the Higher Education Act.
Where Students First graduate sena
tors have sought to limit or obfuscate
debate, People's Platform senators have
tried to promote an open discussion of
issues without viewing Palm Drive as an
arbitrary boundary of student concerns.
What have the other graduate sena
tors accomplished this year?
Well, we no longer have to contend
with spelling and grammatical errors in
the ASSU Bylaws, and I'm sure the stu
dent body will be happy to know that the
most recent edition of "Robert's Rules"
is duly referenced. The only real effort

on any substantive issue, and one
endorsed by People's Platform represen
tatives, has been ASSU Senator Doug
Bone's legislation to support those stu
dents opposing the new University
phone system.

Overdeck's rhetoric is
exhaustive but completely
insubstantial when it
comes to specific legisla
tion.

Overdeck has served the student body
by co-sponsoring (with ASSU Financial
Manager Torrence Boone) a bill calling
for a time line for the disbursement of
fee refunds and a bill which would have
mandated direct student control of
ASSU salaries, despite the volatility this
would introduce into the budget process
and its handicapping of potential appli
cants who receive financial aid.
In the face of overwhelming opposi
tion, he has also repeatedly submitted
his proposal to limit the scope of the
ASSU, a proposal that The Daily con
cedes "goes too far." Overdeck's rhetoric
is exhaustive but completely insubstan
tial when it comes to specific legislation
to improve graduate student life. His
mania for accountability masks an utter
lack of concrete proposals about how the
ASSU's alleged "slush funds" could be
effectively channeled to student services.
If The Daily is really concerned about
graduate students, it might consider that
the charge of "neglect" it has leveled at
the ASSU applies more appropriately to
its own coverage of graduate student
issues. Perhaps The Daily should begin
to address pressing concerns like child
care, rent, graduate fellowship support
and faculty hiring. Given the invisibility
of these issues in The Daily's pages, its
endorsement of Overdeck and "Students
First" has a distinctly hollow ring.
