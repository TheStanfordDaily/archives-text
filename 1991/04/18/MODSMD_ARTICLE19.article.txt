Kennedy can't remain
in office and restore
Stanford's reputation
At a recent meeting of the Faculty
Senate, when asked if you really believe,
in light of the close identification
between you and the Stanford scandal,
that you can restore our public reputa
tion, you said you could.
You cannot.
The reason you cannot is that on your
watch — abetted by the Board of
Trustees — Stanford was corrupted.
Congress knows it. Columnists know it.
Editorial boards know it. Stanford grad
uates know it. The attentive American
public knows it. And people in other
countries know it.
The one who seems not to know it,
who claims the scandal will fade away, is
you. Let me tell you: The damage to
Stanford's reputation is irreparable as
long as you remain president of the Uni
versity.
So far, you have been rather effective
at controlling the damage. After first
defending expenditures for parties and
flowers and closets and antiques, you
now say you know the importance of
doing what is right, not what the law
allows. You have appealed to the Stan
ford "family" to close ranks. The student
newspaper is backing you, noting that
you are well-liked, good at fund raising

and concerned about undergraduate edu
cation. A number of faculty members
publicly support you and, as a Stanford
press release notes, only one member of
the senate has called for your resigna
tion.
Do not be deceived by all this. There
is no possible justification for the
expenses you and the trustees have pre
sented to Stanford.
You told the senate that of all the
charges, the one that hurts you most is
the "ugly and erroneous" claim that you
live extravagantly at taxpayer and Uni
versity expense. You said this charge
describes a life you "neither lead nor
covet."
Yet, on the record, you do appear to
many people to live extravagantly at
University expense: $2,000 a month for
flowers; $9,000 in one year for antiques;
at least $20,000 for table linens in the
1980s; $45,250 for a three-day trustees'
meeting at Fallen Leaf Lake attended by
126 people; $17,000 for a trustees' recep
tion for you and your wife. You have
shown some of the claims by "20/20" and
government investigators were exagger
ated, but is it wrong for people to con
clude from the facts that you live more
like a company president than a college
president?
True, I was the only member of the
senate who openly called for your resig
nation, but I sat there and watched fac
ulty, who had earlier told me they are
embarrassed by you and hope you resign,
say nothing.

Why didn't they speak out? Perhaps
because they like you. Perhaps because
they are afraid of seeming "immoder
ate," of losing favor and acceptance. But
do not mistake silence for support. As
The Daily reported, "several" faculty
members have expressed privately the
hope that you resign, although only one
said so at the senate meeting.
The student newspaper has called
demands for your resignation prema
ture, but the paper did not address the
issue of Stanford's lost integrity, and the
impact this will have on the value of a
Stanford degree. I have talked to Stan
ford graduates who are mortified by the
excesses of your administration. They
are ashamed to be associated with the
University they have loved for years.
And they do not plan to contribute to
Stanford as long as you are president.
The loss of support may not show up
immediately in donations, but the dam
age to our good name is deep, and will in
time erode our appeal.
What is Stanford's image under your
leadership? It is that of a venal univer
sity caught red-handed robbing the
American people. It is that of an univer
sity which cares more about getting
every last dollar than about moral issues
It is that of a university led by an evasive
president who knows what is right only
after having been caught doing wrong.
Surely you can see that Stanford des
perately needs someone new to come in
and help us restore our reputation.
Surely you can see that you are not

the person for this job. Surely you can
see your leadership of Stanford is a dis
aster. Surely you can see that in the best
interests of Stanford, you should resign
as president.

Attacks on Kennedy
are neither merited
nor widely shared
I wish to applaud The Daily's April 12
editorial supporting University President
Donald Kennedy.
Those of us who, as students and
recent alumni, have had a chance to
watch President Kennedy know what
extraordinary leadership he continues to
provide Stanford under very difficult cir
cumstances. He is, in my view, the finest
university president around anywhere.
Kennedy has not only led Stanford
through an incredibly successful Centen
nial fund-raising campaign; he has also
masterfully articulated a new focus on
public service at Stanford. He has led the
University through the difficult issues of
curriculum reform and financial restruc
turing.
At a time when all major research uni
versities are likely to face fiscal difficul
ties, we look forward to Kennedy's lead
ership. Clearly, there are problems with
our accounting system — as well as that
of virtually every other major university

— and Stanford has been one of the first
to acknowledge these problems and to
promise to rectify them.
The personal attacks made on Presi
dent Kennedy by a few individuals
should not be misconstrued as either
having any merit or being widely shar<

The student newspaper has called
demands for your resignation prema
ture, but the paper did not address the
issue of Stanford's lost integrity, and the
impact this will have on the value of a
Stanford degree. I have talked to Stan
ford graduates who are mortified by the
excesses of your administration. They
are ashamed to be associated with the
University they have loved for years.
And they do not plan to contribute to
Stanford as long as you are president.
The loss of support may not show up
immediately in donations, but the dam
age to our good name is deep, and will in
time erode our appeal.
What is Stanford's image under your
leadership? It is that of a venal univer
sity caught red-handed robbing the
American people. It is that of an univer
sity which cares more about getting
every last dollar than about moral issues
It is that of a university led by an evasive
president who knows what is right only
after having been caught doing wrong.
Surely you can see that Stanford des
perately needs someone new to come in
and help us restore our reputation.
Surely you can see that you are not

the person for this job. Surely you can
see your leadership of Stanford is a dis
aster. Surely you can see that in the best
interests of Stanford, you should resign
as president.

Attacks on Kennedy
are neither merited
nor widely shared
I wish to applaud The Daily's April 12
editorial supporting University President
Donald Kennedy.
Those of us who, as students and
recent alumni, have had a chance to
watch President Kennedy know what
extraordinary leadership he continues to
provide Stanford under very difficult cir
cumstances. He is, in my view, the finest
university president around anywhere.
Kennedy has not only led Stanford
through an incredibly successful Centen
nial fund-raising campaign; he has also
masterfully articulated a new focus on
public service at Stanford. He has led the
University through the difficult issues of
curriculum reform and financial restruc
turing.
At a time when all major research uni
versities are likely to face fiscal difficul
ties, we look forward to Kennedy's lead
ership. Clearly, there are problems with
our accounting system — as well as that
of virtually every other major university

— and Stanford has been one of the first
to acknowledge these problems and to
promise to rectify them.
The personal attacks made on Presi
dent Kennedy by a few individuals
should not be misconstrued as either
having any merit or being widely shar<
We are proud of you, Don!

Kennedy can't remain
in office and restore
Stanford's reputation
At a recent meeting of the Faculty
Senate, when asked if you really believe,
in light of the close identification
between you and the Stanford scandal,
that you can restore our public reputa
tion, you said you could.
You cannot.
The reason you cannot is that on your
watch — abetted by the Board of
Trustees — Stanford was corrupted.
Congress knows it. Columnists know it.
Editorial boards know it. Stanford grad
uates know it. The attentive American
public knows it. And people in other
countries know it.
The one who seems not to know it,
who claims the scandal will fade away, is
you. Let me tell you: The damage to
Stanford's reputation is irreparable as
long as you remain president of the Uni
versity.
So far, you have been rather effective
at controlling the damage. After first
defending expenditures for parties and
flowers and closets and antiques, you
now say you know the importance of
doing what is right, not what the law
allows. You have appealed to the Stan
ford "family" to close ranks. The student
newspaper is backing you, noting that
you are well-liked, good at fund raising

and concerned about undergraduate edu
cation. A number of faculty members
publicly support you and, as a Stanford
press release notes, only one member of
the senate has called for your resigna
tion.
Do not be deceived by all this. There
is no possible justification for the
expenses you and the trustees have pre
sented to Stanford.
You told the senate that of all the
charges, the one that hurts you most is
the "ugly and erroneous" claim that you
live extravagantly at taxpayer and Uni
versity expense. You said this charge
describes a life you "neither lead nor
covet."
Yet, on the record, you do appear to
many people to live extravagantly at
University expense: $2,000 a month for
flowers; $9,000 in one year for antiques;
at least $20,000 for table linens in the
1980s; $45,250 for a three-day trustees'
meeting at Fallen Leaf Lake attended by
126 people; $17,000 for a trustees' recep
tion for you and your wife. You have
shown some of the claims by "20/20" and
government investigators were exagger
ated, but is it wrong for people to con
clude from the facts that you live more
like a company president than a college
president?
True, I was the only member of the
senate who openly called for your resig
nation, but I sat there and watched fac
ulty, who had earlier told me they are
embarrassed by you and hope you resign,
say nothing.

Why didn't they speak out? Perhaps
because they like you. Perhaps because
they are afraid of seeming "immoder
ate," of losing favor and acceptance. But
do not mistake silence for support. As
The Daily reported, "several" faculty
members have expressed privately the
hope that you resign, although only one
said so at the senate meeting.
The student newspaper has called
demands for your resignation prema
ture, but the paper did not address the
issue of Stanford's lost integrity, and the
impact this will have on the value of a
Stanford degree. I have talked to Stan
ford graduates who are mortified by the
excesses of your administration. They

University they have loved for years.
And they do not plan to contribute to
Stanford as long as you are president.

immediately in donations, but the dam
age to our good name is deep, and will in
