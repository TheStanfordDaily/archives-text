## Seeing it end in an instant 
### 
Two years ago, I did a story
for another newspaper
about shorts injuries, and
athletes who had recovered from
injuries to play again. But even
this didn't prepare me to watch an
athlete's career come to an end
before my eyes.
I remember watching Trisha
Stevens closely as she warmed up
for Stanford's West Regional
semifinal against the Washington
Huskies in Las Vegas. Despite the

matching black braces that she
was forced to wear on her tendini
tis-plagued knees, Stevens jogged
without a trace of pain up and
down the court, laughing and jok
ing with a teammate.
So I forgot about her condition,
until suddenly, with just 31 sec
onds gone in the basketball game,
she collapsed, untouched, 10 feet
away from where I sat courtside.
It happened so fast, I thought
maybe she had simply slipped.
One look at Stevens' agony
filled face and I thought differ
ently. Stanford had just lost its
four-year starter and co-captain
for good.
Years of wear-and-tear on the
right knee, which had never been
at full strength the entire season,
had finally resulted in a ruptured
tendon. Stevens was helped to the
bench, where she sat with her
chin in her hands the rest of the
game.
Again and again, we hear the
adage, "Injuries are part of the
game." But they are perhaps the
worst part, the part that goes
beyond winning and losing,
beyond the parameters of the
sport, and affects the individuals
for the rest of their lives.
Later, Stanford coach Tara
VanDerveer was asked about the
injury to her star center. But
although the loss of Stevens may
have cost her team the national
championship, VanDerveer real
ized there was something even
more tragic about the situation.
"Trisha loves to do a lot of
things. She loves to ski," Van-
Derveer said. "To think that she
might never be able to do the
things she loves, just because she
played in a basketball game . . .
it's hard to take."
This harsh reality is further
brought home when serious
injuries occur at the college
level. These are not professionals
who are being paid to put their
bodies on the line. There are no
multi-million dollar justifications
here.
Yet, in the name of school pride
and athletic achievement, our
classmates are constantly risking
the possibility of debilitating
injury to compete. It's not some
thing that should be shrugged off
as "part of the game."
It's not like the shoulder pads
and balls, which are left on the
field. You can see it in the dorms,
in the classrooms.
Last year, I had several classes
with Stanford volleyball setter
Lara Asper. I watched in horror as
she was forced to take notes
standing up or lying on her stom
ach, trying to ease the pain of a
back injury that ended her career.
Asper played a "non-contact"
sport. Sports such as football and
basketball employ slews of train
ers and team doctors, so numer
ous are the injuries to partici
pants. At any moment in these
games, an injury could occur that
could end a player's career and
even cripple him or her for life.
But these athletes continue to
compete, to train long hours and
to devote large portions of their
lives to their sport. When an
injury does occur, it rarely dimin
ishes this zeal for competition.
Stevens played in pain her
junior year, then chose to have
surgery done to try to correct the
problem. Then, during rehabilita
tion, she wanted to play basket
ball so badly that she may have
even inadvertently hurt herself.
She came back too hard, too fast,
so eager was she to get back on the
court.
Julie Zeilstra, Stevens' team
mate, has feet that in her own
words "are not made for sports."
Few know it, but Zeilstra has been
a star for three seasons while cop
ing with Achilles' tendons that are
so painful at times that she can
not walk without limping.
Zeilstra'a Stanford career may
have ended just one game after
Stevens' did. Cleared to play just


David
Hirning
minutes before tipoff, the 6-foot-3
forward showed incredible
courage in the regional finals,
scoring 17 points and pulling
down 12 rebounds. After the Car
dinal had upset Georgia, 85-77,
Zeilstra had to be helped to the
locker room.
It was too much for her ten
dons. Warming up before the
semifinals against Tennessee,
Zeilstra compensated for the sore
ness and pulled a calf muscle. She
could not play. The dejected team
mates — Zeilstra with ice on her
leg, Stevens in a cast — sat on the
end of the bench together.
We read about this in the
paper, say "What a
shame," and promptly
forget about it. But the athlete
has to deal with the injury, both
mentally and physically — it
becomes part of their life, just as
their sport was before.
But despite the adage, athletes

often do not take an injury as sim
ply a part of the game. Not every
athlete is injured, and therefore
not every athlete is prepared and
can handle it when one does occur.
So the next time you see an
athlete sprawled on the ground
with trainers all around, think
about what it really means. When
that person is helped off the field
or court, the injury is not gone,
even though the game goes on like
nothing has happened.
Or the next time you feel jeal
ous of an athlete that gets atten
tion or special treatment, or you
sneer because a certain athlete
may not have gotten the grades
you did in high school, think
about what Trisha Stevens, Julie
Zeilstra, Ed McCaffrey and count
less other Stanford athletes have
had to go through due to injuries.
And the next time you read an
article like the one in yesterday's
Mercury News entitled "Stan
ford's Knecht shifts to strong
safety," read between the lines.
The story was about a quarter
back that Stanford coaches had
moved to defensive back, not
because thev felt he's a better

safety than QB, but because of an
injury.
Junior Jimmy Klein, the start
ing strong safety, suffered an
injury in February. Klein was
playing his "other" Stanford var
sity sport, volleyball, when he
blew out his knee. He had surgery,
and is currently rehabilitating the
knee in hopes of playing football
this fall.
But, just in case he can't repair
the knee, the Stanford football
coaches have tried to repair their
defensive backfield. If Klein
doesn't come back, Stanford foot
ball will go on.
But Jimmy Klein has to go on,
too, something taken away from
him which he can never get back.
Bo Jackson, a more famous two
sport athlete, currently faces a
mysterious injury that could be
career-ending as well. He can
barely walk without crutches
right now.
Which is a horrible thing to see
happen, right in front of your
eyes.

Lara Asper. I watched in horror as
she was forced to take notes
standing up or lying on her stom
ach, trying to ease the pain of a
back injury that ended her career.
Asper played a "non-contact"
sport. Sports such as football and
basketball employ slews of train
ers and team doctors, so numer
ous are the injuries to partici
pants. At any moment in these
games, an injury could occur that
could end a player's career and
even cripple him or her for life.
But these athletes continue to
compete, to train long hours and
to devote large portions of their
lives to their sport. When an
injury does occur, it rarely dimin
ishes this zeal for competition.
Stevens played in pain her
junior year, then chose to have
surgery done to try to correct the
problem. Then, during rehabilita
tion, she wanted to play basket
ball so badly that she may have
even inadvertently hurt herself.
She came back too hard, too fast,
so eager was she to get back on the
court.
Julie Zeilstra, Stevens' team
mate, has feet that in her own
words "are not made for sports."
Few know it, but Zeilstra has been
a star for three seasons while cop
ing with Achilles' tendons that are
so painful at times that she can
not walk without limping.
Zeilstra'a Stanford career may
have ended just one game after
Stevens' did. Cleared to play just

minutes before tipoff, the 6-foot-3
forward showed incredible
courage in the regional finals,
scoring 17 points and pulling
down 12 rebounds. After the Car
dinal had upset Georgia, 85-77,
Zeilstra had to be helped to the
locker room.
It was too much for her ten
dons. Warming up before the
semifinals against Tennessee,
Zeilstra compensated for the sore
ness and pulled a calf muscle. She
could not play. The dejected team
mates — Zeilstra with ice on her
leg, Stevens in a cast — sat on the
end of the bench together.
We read about this in the
paper, say "What a
shame," and promptly
forget about it. But the athlete
has to deal with the injury, both
mentally and physically — it
becomes part of their life, just as
their sport was before.
But despite the adage, athletes

often do not take an injury as sim
ply a part of the game. Not every
athlete is injured, and therefore
not every athlete is prepared and
can handle it when one does occur.
So the next time you see an
athlete sprawled on the ground
with trainers all around, think
about what it really means. When
that person is helped off the field
or court, the injury is not gone,
even though the game goes on like
nothing has happened.
Or the next time you feel jeal
ous of an athlete that gets atten
tion or special treatment, or you
sneer because a certain athlete
may not have gotten the grades
you did in high school, think
about what Trisha Stevens, Julie
Zeilstra, Ed McCaffrey and count
less other Stanford athletes have
had to go through due to injuries.
And the next time you read an
article like the one in yesterday's
Mercury News entitled "Stan
ford's Knecht shifts to strong
safety," read between the lines.
The story was about a quarter
back that Stanford coaches had
moved to defensive back, not
because thev felt he's a better

safety than QB, but because of an
injury.
Junior Jimmy Klein, the start
ing strong safety, suffered an
injury in February. Klein was
playing his "other" Stanford var
sity sport, volleyball, when he
blew out his knee. He had surgery,
and is currently rehabilitating the
knee in hopes of playing football
this fall.
But, just in case he can't repair
the knee, the Stanford football
coaches have tried to repair their
defensive backfield. If Klein
doesn't come back, Stanford foot
ball will go on.
But Jimmy Klein has to go on,
too, something taken away from
him which he can never get back.
Bo Jackson, a more famous two
sport athlete, currently faces a
mysterious injury that could be
career-ending as well. He can
barely walk without crutches
right now.
Which is a horrible thing to see
happen, right in front of your
eyes.

Two years ago, I did a story
for another newspaper
about shorts injuries, and
athletes who had recovered from
injuries to play again. But even
this didn't prepare me to watch an
athlete's career come to an end
before my eyes.
I remember watching Trisha
Stevens closely as she warmed up
for Stanford's West Regional
semifinal against the Washington
Huskies in Las Vegas. Despite the

matching black braces that she
was forced to wear on her tendini
tis-plagued knees, Stevens jogged
without a trace of pain up and
down the court, laughing and jok
ing with a teammate.
So I forgot about her condition,
until suddenly, with just 31 sec
onds gone in the basketball game,
she collapsed, untouched, 10 feet
away from where I sat courtside.
It happened so fast, I thought
maybe she had simply slipped.
One look at Stevens' agony
filled face and I thought differ
ently. Stanford had just lost its
four-year starter and co-captain
for good.
Years of wear-and-tear on the
right knee, which had never been
at full strength the entire season,
had finally resulted in a ruptured
tendon. Stevens was helped to the
bench, where she sat with her
chin in her hands the rest of the
game.
Again and again, we hear the
adage, "Injuries are part of the
game." But they are perhaps the
worst part, the part that goes
beyond winning and losing,
beyond the parameters of the
sport, and affects the individuals
for the rest of their lives.
Later, Stanford coach Tara
VanDerveer was asked about the
injury to her star center. But
although the loss of Stevens may
have cost her team the national
championship, VanDerveer real
ized there was something even
more tragic about the situation.
"Trisha loves to do a lot of
things. She loves to ski," Van-
Derveer said. "To think that she
might never be able to do the
things she loves, just because she
played in a basketball game . . .
it's hard to take."
This harsh reality is further
brought home when serious
injuries occur at the college
level. These are not professionals
who are being paid to put their
bodies on the line. There are no
multi-million dollar justifications
here.
Yet, in the name of school pride
and athletic achievement, our
classmates are constantly risking
the possibility of debilitating
injury to compete. It's not some
thing that should be shrugged off
as "part of the game."
It's not like the shoulder pads
and balls, which are left on the
field. You can see it in the dorms,
in the classrooms.
