# Hoops coup?
## Duke's McCaffrey says he'll transfer; jump-shooting whiz could be destined for Stanford 
### 
Right now it's nothing more
than a rumor. But for Stanford
hoops fans, the news is quite
promising: Bill McCaffrey, the sec
ond-leading scorer on Duke's
NCAA champion basketball team,
is transferring and Stanford is
high on his list.
McCaffrey, an all-Final Four
selection in this year's tourna
ment, is the younger brother of
Stanford wide receiver Ed McCaf
frey. The elder McCaffrey con
cluded his football career here
with All-America honors and is
expected to be a high pick in the
NFL draft, which gets underway
Sunday.
"My sincere thanks goes to all
my coaches, teammates and
friends, so it is with mixed emo
tions I have decided to explore
potential career opportunities
which may be made available to
me and in my best interest," Bill
McCaffrey said yesterday after
noon.
"I feel apprehensive not know
ing what opportunities will be

made available but I have confi
dence in my ability to succeed at
whatever I choose to do. I feel my
decision is best for all concerned
because it is what I truly want.
"Once again, I would like to
thank my teammates and espe
cially Coach K for his genuine
interest and concern. The memo
ries will be cherished forever,"
McCaffrey said.
Coach K is, of course, Duke
coach Mike Krzyzewski, who was
at a speaking engagement in
South Bend, Ind. Krzyzewski sim
ply said, "It has been a real plea
sure coaching Bill. He has made a
big contribution to our team for
the past two years and has repre
sented Duke in great fasion.
"We wish him well and will try
to help him in any manner we can
with his plans to relocate."
Under NCAA rules, the 6-foot
-3 sophomore guard would have to
sit out next season after transfer
ring. He would then have two
years of eligibility remaining.
The story broke yesterday

morning in a local paper in North
Carolina, which quoted Bill's
father as its primary source.
"Billy is assessing other oppor
tunities," Edward McCaffrey Sr.
said. "He hasn't decided on where
he's going, but he is talking with
his coaches. He's trying to be hon
est and up front with the Duke
coaches. Things should shake out
in a day or so, maybe by Thurs
day."
The Herald-Sun of Durham
reported in yesterday's editions
that Stanford has been suggested
as a possible destination.
McCaffrey, who is from Allen
town, Pa., averaged 11.6 points
for the Blue Devils (32-7). He
started 21 games this season, led
Duke in free throw percentage
(.832) and scored 16 points
against Kansas in the NCAA final.
"Billy likes Duke," his father
said. "He has no criticism of any
thing about the place. It's a great
school, great program, great
coaching staff, great players."
McCaffrey was third on the

team in minutes played (24.8), but
his father said playing time is a
factor in his discontent.
"Billy is concerned, but he's
always been concerned â€” all
year," McCaffrey Sr. said. "Play
ing time is part of that. So is get
ting the opportunity to handle the
ball more, to play more point, just
to be a greater factor. He's been
asked to fill the catalyst's role,
and he has done that.
"It's tough. What do you like to
do? Are you happy in the role you
need to play to fit into a program?
Or do you want to go for it?"
McCaffrey's father hinted that
the emergence of the Hills, swing
players Thomas and Grant, has
his son worried about his role next

season.
"Coach K likes to play four for
wards and one guard," McCaffrey
Sr. said. "Who's to say the guy is
wrong? He's one of the top
coaches in the country, and the
truth of the matter is he just has a
lot of great players.
"Billy has a lot of mixed emo
tions right now," McCaffrey Sr.
said. "He's my son and I love him.
I'm trying to counsel him to make
sure he's doing the right thing."
Stanford is coming off its most
successful season in half a cen
tury. The Cardinal went 20-13
this season and won the postsea
son National Invitation Tourna
ment.
Brother Ed told the Times Tri
bune yesterday,"I haven't talked
too [Billy] since the day after the
championship game." But he
added that his brother had visited
here twice and "definitely likes
Stanford."
