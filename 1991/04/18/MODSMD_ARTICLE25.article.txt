# Gymnasts kick off drive for NCAA title
## Key injury dims chances, but team still optimistic 
### Noah Blake Staff writer 
Stanford's men's gymnastics coach
Sadao Hamada came up with a plan during
last year's off season, a plan that he hoped
would lead his talented Cardinal squad to a
national title. Tonight the NCAA champi
onship finals begin and, so far, almost
everything has gone according to plan.
The Cardinal men blitzed through the
season, finishing first in every meet but
two. The team avenged these losses, which
came at the hands of the Oklahoma Sooners
and the UCLA Bruins, at the NCAA West
Regional. Stanford emerged from that meet
as the odds-on favorite to win the national
title, and, as a result, comes into tonight
and tomorrow's NCAA finals as the No. 1
seed.
Tonight, on the Penn State campus, the
Cardinal will face UCLA and Oklahoma
again, in addition to the East's best, Penn
State and Ohio State before a highly parti
san crowd of Nittany Lion faithful. The
eight-team field that competes this evening
will be whittled down to three finalists for
tomorrow night's showdown for the nation
al championship.
But the team's hopes may have been
dealt a serious blow when superfrosh Mark
Booth broke his foot in his first tumbling
pass on the floor exercise in the West
Regional. Booth was both the Cardinal's
and the nation's best performer on this
event, and the loss of his all-around score
may hurt the team's chances significantly.
"Luckily we have enough backups,"
Hamada said. "We have been having very
good practices, and Tim Ryan and Tim
Wang are fine." Ryan and Wang have both
been limited by injury this year, and

healthy performances by them will boost
Stanford's chances to win.
Because of booth's injury, Hamada must
reach deeper into his bag of tricks to pro
duce a championship lineup. Tonight's
results, which will not be carried over to
tomorrow's final, should give some indica
tion of what this new lineup can do.
In order to escape the ravenous Lion
crowd, the Cardinal would like to see its
hosts eliminated tonight. Of course, then
Stanford would likely face the Sooners and
Bruins in the final.
Regardless of the opponents, the Cardi
nal has its fate in its own hands. Stanford
has the most difficult set of routines of any
of the competitors and, consequently, all
that the team must do is be as consistent as
anyone else in order to win.
With the loss of one of its top performers,
however, this mav be a tall order indeed.

Though limited by Injury for much of the season, senior Tim Wang is ready to go as the
Cardinal heads into NCAAs. Stanford is looking for its first-ever national title at the
championships, which begin tonight on the Penn State campus.
