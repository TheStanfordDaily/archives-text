BERKELEY - The Stanford
men's volleyball team beat Cali
fornia 15-4, 15-5, 15-7 in January.
The Cardinal beat the Golden
Bears 15-5, 15-6, 15-7 last month.
And Stanford beat Cal 15-4, 15-6,
15-7 last night.
Sort of.
Stanford, ranked eighth
nationally, traveled to Harmon
Gym to meet the Bears in another
exhibition contest last night.
Since the Bears are a club team,
and since Stanford has what will
probably be a must-win match
against top-ranked USC Saturday,
Cardinal coach Ruben Nieves
decided to rest all six of his
starters versus Cal.
It was almost a major blunder.
The Bears, playing inspired
defense, won the first two games
against the Cardinal before finally
faltering 11-15, 8-15, 15-4, 15-6,
15-7. The big gun for the Cardinal
was senior outside hitter John
Alstrom, who tallied 32 kills in a
starting role.
Stanford also got a huge boost
from middle blockers Joe
Burghardt and John Bezmali
novic. Burghardt, a freshman,
entered very late in the second
game while Bezmalinovic, a
sophomore, came in at the start of
the third.
Burghart had 15 kills over the
last three games, hitting a cool
.833 over that period. Bezmali
novic wasn't far behind, slam
ming down 17 kills while hitting
.519.
"I think we played better than
the scores might indicate," Nieves

said after the two-hour, 45-minute
match. "They're a good defensive
team. . . . We were taking good
swings and the ball kept coming
back."
Sophomore Jimmy Blackman
started at setter and did a good job
running the makeshift offense.
The five hitters in the starting
lineup had combined for a total of
31 kills all season. "It was pretty
tough at first," he said. "I set
them in practice but it's different
in a match. ... I think the big dif
ference was the two middles came
in and turned it around and J.B.
(Taylor) did a good job."
Taylor replaced Chris Wrede
for the final two games and was a
very consistent passer and digger
for the Cardinal. In addition to
Wrede, Alstrom and Blackman,
freshmen Aaron Mead and Mur
phy Clark and junior Doug
Walquist rounded out the starting
lineup.
Mead, who has been used as a
back-row specialist this year, was
in on every point for the Cardinal
last night and was consistent if
not spectacular. Clark, who red
shirted last year, made his debut
for Stanford by collecting a few
kills and a few digs in the first two
games. Walquist, a junior who
started several matches his fresh
man year, contributed several kills
as well.
But Burghardt and Bezmali
novic, both of whom have been
part-time starters this year, made
the biggest impact. Their ability
to get kills in the middle added a
lot to the Stanford offense and
also freed up the other Cardinal

downed California In five games without most of Its starters.
