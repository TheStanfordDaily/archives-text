# Farm hosts huge rugby event
## 
### Tony Loffredo 
In the United States, most peo
ple think rugby isn't much more
than a bunch of beer-guzzling
brutes trying to kill each other.
For that reason, rugby players get
used to playing without crowd
support. While a lot of people
don't take the game seriously, any
Stanford rugger will tell you that
some quality athletes play rugby
and that the program here is rich
in tradition.
Tomorrow through Sunday, as
the West Coast's premiere college
rugby teams venture to the Farm
for the Pacific Coast Collegiate
Rugby Championship, Stanford's
ruggers will have their last chance
to show just how serious they are
about their game.
"Any senior will tell you that in
the past four years this team has
gone from a perennial loser to a
national contender," said captain
Simon Fleming-Wood.
Stanford fell on some hard
times in the '80s, but, in recent
years, Rich Cortez and other
alumni who remember when
Stanford rugby won a string of
national championships in the

'70s made an effort to get some
good coaches to help the program
return to it's past glory.
Their efforts reached as far as
France to lure coach Franck
Boivert, known throughout the
world for his technical mastery of
the game. In his first year at Stan
ford, the rugby team made it to
the playoffs for the first time since
anyone could remember.
"We owe a lot to alumni who
helped get good coaches, but it's
the players that couldn't stand
losing that made the difference,"
said senior Brian Jewett. "The
word around the league the first
year we made it to the playoffs
was that we just barely squeaked
in. But the players knew that we
deserved to be there."
After being seeded last, Stan
ford nearly beat first seed Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo and ended
up in fifth.
Stanford proved that making it
to the playoffs was no fluke by fin
ishing third in the playoffs the
next year, and by making it again
this year. Each year Stanford has
entered the playoffs as an under
dog, and this year is no different
as Stanford is again seeded last.

The Cardinal's first game is
against Southern Division champs
Cal Poly.
Senior John Hamilton said,
"We're used to being the under
dogs, but this year is different
because we have more size, speed
and experience."
Fly half J.B. Handley and loose
forwards Ed Stevens and Jason
Bucha are no strangers to postsea
son play. And Stanford has defi
nitely added some bulk with the
likes of ex-football players Mark
Hanson and Chuck Robinson.
But Coach Boivert noted,
"Physically and tactically, this is
the best team we've had going into
the playoffs. But I'm afraid that
mentally we may still be on vaca
tion in Hawaii. We can go to
nationals only if each player can
find it inside himself to play better
than he ever has."
Fleming-Wood added,"We've
been talking about going to
nationals since before the season
began, and playing at home could
be a real advantage â€” especially if
we get the crowd support." Stan
ford's first step toward nationals
will be Friday at 10 a.m. in Mal
oney Field.
