# Haas Center plans to build larger facility
## 
### Dan Stearns Staff writer 
The Haas Public Service Center is plan
ning to build a new $3 million building
across from its current location to alleviate
worsening space problems.
Although no definite date for the begin
ning of construction has been set, Haas
director Catherine Milton said she hopes
the facility can be completed during the
coming academic year. Haas is still seeking
an architect to design the building, she
added.
Many center workers have complained
that the current facility — an old, white
Victorian house — has become too crowded.
"It's obviously inadequate space," said
senior Sean Fox, co-director of the public
service segment of the Centennial Celebra
tion finale weekend in September. Fox
works at a computer in a small room,
engulfed by stacks of papers and boxes,
along with several file cabinets.
Mike MacCrystall, a senior who works in
a slightly larger room on the second floor
for the Stanford Volunteer Network, has
similar problems. "It's absolutely insane,"
he said.
He added that the office is used by 18
workers and that some people often go out
on the balcony to make phone calls.

Originally, plans were made to build an
addition to the current facility, but because
the building was constructed under less
restrictive building codes, an addition
would have required a massive renovation
of Haas and eventually cost more than a
new building itself, Milton said.
An unnamed donor has already given
$500,000, and more donations are
expected, she said.
The new facility would alleviate the
cramped office problems within Haas and
allow other public service programs scat
tered across campus to move to a central
ized location, Milton added.
One of these groups is Volunteers in
Asia, currently located in the Old Union
Clubhouse.
Volunteers in Asia director Allissa Keny-
Guyer said she is "anxiously awaiting" the
new facility, not only because it will relieve
her staff of a cramped office, but because it
will mingle "international opportunities
with public service."
Milton said she expects the Board of
Trustees to approve the plan at its June
meeting. The Board approved the concept
of the new building at its February meeting.
She said the old building will remain in
the hands of the University, but does not
know who will move in.
