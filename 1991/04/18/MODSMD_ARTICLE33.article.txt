# INTERMISSION
## Everything I needed to know about Stanford 
### 
The following is a public service announcement for
the visiting prospective freshmyn. Please make
sure they read it in full. There will be a short quiz
and scavenger hunt later.
You are embarking on a journey. More like a quest. A
really important quest. Almost a perquisition, but not
really. Anyway, it's real important.
In fact, this is probably the most important decision you
have ever faced. I mean, let's face it, up 'til now the only
decisions you've made on your own were whether to put
your hair up or down for the spring prom. Whether or not
to take the written part of the driving test sober. To "Vogue,"
or not to "Vogue."

But this is for real. This is four years of your life. This will
shape who you will become, what job you will get, who your
friends will be — whether or not you will ever have sex.
The first question you must ask yourself when thinking
about Stanford is this: "How embarrassed will I be about
this indirect-cost thing that I heard that Donaldson guy
who looks like Sam the Eagle talk about?"
The answer: very.
After all, the rest of us chose Stanford completely
unaware. You, however, will knowingly choose to invest
four years in a diploma from a college that will soon be
nothing but an obscure joke located next to "Slippery Rock"
in back issues of "U.S. News and World Report."
"Who cares," you naively respond, "What about the
sex?"
Let me answer that in the form of a fable:
There was once a small tribe of 6,000 rabbits aged 18 to
23. They never copulated and became extinct. Next ques
tion, please.
"Can I really windsurf for credit?"
You — the one who asked this question — yes, you —
the one who looks like a cross between Johnny Depp and
Richard Feinmann — you are exactly the kind of
scholar/athlete/Renaissance person we are looking for.
After all, where else can you learn guitar, golf, "Contra
ceptive Counseling" and "Makeup for the Stage" and call it
a course load? And even work it into your self-designed
physical humanism major? What did you retort, you over
researching, blatantly insecure, angst-ridden, Pro Fro? Well,
I'll have you know that Brown doesn't serve frozen yogurt.
But still, I picture you walking all alone somewhere near
Kappa Sig, in a vomit-induced stupor, trying to use Hoover
Tower like some sort of Ed Meese-infested-Polaris and
repeating over and over again, "Is this really for me?"
Of course it's for you. There's "Exotic Erotics," people
named "Chip," White Plaza vendors, and views of the Dish,
excited professors with hair in their ears — these are a few
of my favorite things.
And then there's dancing midgets who talk backwards,
and Gregor Samsizing owls, Air Force majors who cohort
with extra-terrestrials ...
Wait, that's "Twin Peaks." But more parallels than we
would like to admit exist between David Lynch's twisted,
pseudo-artsy, network money pit and our own twisted,
pseudo-artsy, tax-payer money pit. For instance:
Typical "Twin Peak's" dialogue: "Harry, the answer
became epistemologically translucent when I began to
apply the techniques I learned from a hermeneutic under
standing of the Dalai Lama's works. Damn fine cup of coffee
though."
Typical Stanford seminar dialogue: "I don't remember
that 'eyes of God' thing from the movie."
Well, maybe not. But back to the main question: Is Stan
ford right for you?
In the tradition of Socratic dialogue I answer by posing
a question to you: "What do you think of long, grueling,
mind-expanding hours spent debating the possibility of
God qua creator — right in your very own dorm room?"
Sound painful? Rather be talking about yeast infections?
Your idea of political involvement is memorizing last night's
"Top 10 Phrases You Can Get Away with in 'The Cuss
Game'"?
Well then, you've found the right place. A place where
multiculturalism is the biggest word people admit knowing.
A place where multiculturalism is the only thing people
admit knowing. A place where the sun falls on just the right
places.
Sound too good to be true? But wait — before you
decide you also get this: the chance to share a room the size
of the accommodations at a Kurdish refugee camp, finals
three times a year and a fault line close enough to call your
very own.
Now how much would you pay? Probably not $21,262.
But your parents will. And that's the beauty of it all.
It doesn't really matter where you decide to go. I mean,
unless you're considering UC-Berkeley or something, I'm
sure that whichever one of the consortium of fine universi
ties you choose will make you happy. After all, who your
freshman roommate is will probably determine your future
happiness more than the school you choose.
So calm down. In the scheme of things, your decision
doesn't matter that much. In fact, the paltry decisions you
will make throughout your life will probably have very little
effect on anything.
So you might as well do it in the sun.

really important quest. Almost a perquisition, but not
really. Anyway, it's real important.
In fact, this is probably the most important decision you
have ever faced. I mean, let's face it, up 'til now the only
decisions you've made on your own were whether to put
your hair up or down for the spring prom. Whether or not
to take the written part of the driving test sober. To "Vogue,"
or not to "Vogue."

But this is for real. This is four years of your life. This will
shape who you will become, what job you will get, who your
friends will be — whether or not you will ever have sex.
The first question you must ask yourself when thinking
about Stanford is this: "How embarrassed will I be about
this indirect-cost thing that I heard that Donaldson guy
who looks like Sam the Eagle talk about?"
The answer: very.
After all, the rest of us chose Stanford completely
unaware. You, however, will knowingly choose to invest
four years in a diploma from a college that will soon be
nothing but an obscure joke located next to "Slippery Rock"
in back issues of "U.S. News and World Report."
"Who cares," you naively respond, "What about the
sex?"
Let me answer that in the form of a fable:
There was once a small tribe of 6,000 rabbits aged 18 to
23. They never copulated and became extinct. Next ques
tion, please.
"Can I really windsurf for credit?"
You — the one who asked this question — yes, you —
the one who looks like a cross between Johnny Depp and
Richard Feinmann — you are exactly the kind of
scholar/athlete/Renaissance person we are looking for.
After all, where else can you learn guitar, golf, "Contra
ceptive Counseling" and "Makeup for the Stage" and call it
a course load? And even work it into your self-designed
physical humanism major? What did you retort, you over
researching, blatantly insecure, angst-ridden, Pro Fro? Well,
I'll have you know that Brown doesn't serve frozen yogurt.
But still, I picture you walking all alone somewhere near
Kappa Sig, in a vomit-induced stupor, trying to use Hoover
Tower like some sort of Ed Meese-infested-Polaris and
repeating over and over again, "Is this really for me?"
Of course it's for you. There's "Exotic Erotics," people
named "Chip," White Plaza vendors, and views of the Dish,
excited professors with hair in their ears — these are a few
of my favorite things.
And then there's dancing midgets who talk backwards,
and Gregor Samsizing owls, Air Force majors who cohort
with extra-terrestrials ...
Wait, that's "Twin Peaks." But more parallels than we
would like to admit exist between David Lynch's twisted,
pseudo-artsy, network money pit and our own twisted,
pseudo-artsy, tax-payer money pit. For instance:
Typical "Twin Peak's" dialogue: "Harry, the answer
became epistemologically translucent when I began to
apply the techniques I learned from a hermeneutic under
standing of the Dalai Lama's works. Damn fine cup of coffee
though."
Typical Stanford seminar dialogue: "I don't remember
that 'eyes of God' thing from the movie."
Well, maybe not. But back to the main question: Is Stan
ford right for you?
In the tradition of Socratic dialogue I answer by posing
a question to you: "What do you think of long, grueling,
mind-expanding hours spent debating the possibility of
God qua creator — right in your very own dorm room?"
Sound painful? Rather be talking about yeast infections?
Your idea of political involvement is memorizing last night's
"Top 10 Phrases You Can Get Away with in 'The Cuss
Game'"?
Well then, you've found the right place. A place where
multiculturalism is the biggest word people admit knowing.
A place where multiculturalism is the only thing people
admit knowing. A place where the sun falls on just the right
places.
Sound too good to be true? But wait — before you
decide you also get this: the chance to share a room the size
of the accommodations at a Kurdish refugee camp, finals
three times a year and a fault line close enough to call your
very own.
Now how much would you pay? Probably not $21,262.
But your parents will. And that's the beauty of it all.
It doesn't really matter where you decide to go. I mean,
unless you're considering UC-Berkeley or something, I'm
sure that whichever one of the consortium of fine universi
ties you choose will make you happy. After all, who your
freshman roommate is will probably determine your future
happiness more than the school you choose.
So calm down. In the scheme of things, your decision
doesn't matter that much. In fact, the paltry decisions you
will make throughout your life will probably have very little
effect on anything.
So you might as well do it in the sun.
