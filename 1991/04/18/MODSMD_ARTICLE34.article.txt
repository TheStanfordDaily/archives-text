Ram's Head spring musical beckons
you "Into the Woods"

c
tarting tomorrow, you can journey "Into the Woods
. jon a fairy-tale quest featuring great musical numbers,
humorous lyrics and a stunning set.
As a matter of fact, the real star in the Rams Head spring
musical is the title role — the Woods themselves. Set designer
Allan Daly has created a thick forest of canvas trees and paper
mache rocks that make the Memorial Auditorium stage appear
deep and ominously threatening.

The Woods are the setting for an
intricately woven amalgam of fairy
tales — the Brothers Grimm versions,
not the Disney ones — that bring
back childhood memories of wolves,
dwarves and fairy godmothers. As the
characters wander, trees rise and fall
from above to create different forest
scenes.
The first act fast forwards through
four fairy tales — "Jack and the
Beanstalk," "Little Red Riding Hood,"
"RapunzeP and "Cinderella" — with
pieces of a few other stories thrown in
for good measure. The Witch —
played strongly by I liana Zauderer —

tells a Baker and His Wife that they
will only he ahle to have a child if he
retrieves:
• One, the cow as white as milk;
• TWo, the cape as red as blood;
• Three, the hair as yellow as corn,
and
• Four, the slipper as pure as gold.
These four objects become the
devices that link the Raker family with
each of the four fairy tales as John Fcr
nandes and Erin Browne scurry
through the Woods searching for the
ingredients to the potion that will

bring them a child.
Fairy tales always have happy end
ings, of course, so you can guess how
the first act ends.
The second act, however, is a study
of "happily ever after" gone awry. One
of Jack's giants is stomping on houses
and castles throughout the kingdom,
and the main characters band togeth

er to fight her. This act allows the
characters to develop beyond one
dimensional, storybook stereotypes.
In all, the 20-member cast is
strong, and each character develops a
unique personality. The standout in
the cast is clearly Little Red, played by
Carolyn Shapiro. Shapiro creates a
ditzy yet feisty little girl whose antics
are hilarious to watch.
Also entertaining are the princes,
played by Ben Evans and Dan Hunt.
The show gets the most ambitious

in its technical aspects — and that's
where it gets in the most trouble.
Of course, I saw the show on Tues
day, when some of the difficulties
were still being ironed out. But my
hunch is that this show has bitten off
a tad more than it can chew in the
scenery, costumes and effects depart
ments.
For example, the Wolf's costume is
excellent, but it muffled Adi Wyner's
voice. Often, the orchestra was much
too loud to hear the lyrics, most of
which are sung quite rapidly anyway.

Carolyn Shapiro) in the Ram's Head spring musical, "Into the Woods."
