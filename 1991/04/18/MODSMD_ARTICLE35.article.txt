# FROM THE EDITORS

T
-L. he original purpose of this editors' box was twofold:
• To provide the public with what we think they should do with their
free time; and
• To give readers a glimpse inside the workings of Intermission.
Scary thoughts, both.
But if you think that's frightening, think about this: Imagine conduct
ing interviews with two of the cutest couples on campus. (See page 3.)
It's even worse than it sounds.
These are no fly-by-night, we-don't-love-each-other-but-we-like-each
other-enough-to-pretend-we-like-each-other-a-lot-so-we-can-keep-hav-
ing-sex couples.
No. These are the real thing.
Believe it, or not.
Four likable people who have actually found healthy relationships at
Stanford.
This disproved everything we had learned and internalized for the past
three years. Blew away every great rationalization we've clung to.
Imagine our dismay.
And imagine tape recording their affectionate murmurs, their shy gig
gles, their quotes like, "we love each other so, so much (giggle). We are so,
so very happy and want every one to know it Don't we, Honey?"
Imagine what the tape didn't pick up: the loving glances, the hand
strokes, the aura of blissful happiness.
It was gross.
It was scarier than bungee jumping.
But we survived.
Barely.
Just thinking about it is depressing, so let's not dwell. A little bit of slap
stick, and perhaps even stupidity, is all that's really required to break even
the most steadfastly miserable (that's French, by the way) out of a deep
funk. And the Laurel and Hardy Festival in San Jose on Sunday is just
what the doctor ordered. (See Calendar.)
Another film festival is taking place this week on the autre (more
French) side of the Bay. The "Second Annual Black Filmworks," is a 10-
day festival that kicks off tonight, featuring contemporary and classic films
and videos written by black filmmakers.
And a benefit concert for the world's most deserving needy group, chil
dren, will be held tonight in Berkeley. The funds raised at Bridges, an
evening of Arabic, Persian and Yiddish music and dance, will go toward
the Middle East Children's Alliance, a group that sends medical supplies
and money to help children in the Middle East. (See Calendar.)
And closer to home, in non-Weenie territory, the Mountain View Cen
ter for the Performing Arts is presenting two noteworthy productions this
week. "Forbidden Broadway," a parody of Broadway's greatest current
hits, takes the stage tonight through Saturday. It's very funny. And very
New York. (See Calendar.)
The Side Street Strutters Jazz Band also takes the stage in Mountain
View on Tuesday, jamming away on trombone, trumpet, clarinet, tuba and
piano and wearing very silly striped shirts.
What? What's that? You can't go because you haven't a thing to wear?
Well then, by all means head to the Designer Sportswear Sale and
Dessert Benefit in the Dance Studio in Roble Gym on Saturday.
On the other hand, you might as well just stay in and study since you're
already two weeks behind and its only the second week of the quarter. And
there's always those nonexistent summer jobs to look for ...
To close, if that paper deadline is already rapidly approaching and you
are absolutely uninspired, try the creative coping mechanisms of Joel Stein,
who stood up from his computer the other night and called the Bridge for
counseling on writer's block.
It's true. And you heard it here first.
