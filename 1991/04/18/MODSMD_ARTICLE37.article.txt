Affectionately known as the "vomit couple" in
Ram's Head circles, Ben Evans and Kathye
Boline are just too cute for words. Petite and
almost fragile, Boline's fair complexion and
blonde hair are a stark contrast to Evans' dark
features.
But this dichotomy is the stuff from which musical the
ater is made. The proverbial opposites always attract. And
Evans and Boline are often type cast into precisely these
roles. The willowy soprano and the booming baritone; the
fair, beautiful maiden and the dark, persistent suitor.
But regardless of the physical disparities that suit them
to these characters, this on and offstage couple appears to be
a perfect match.
Sitting at a table on the patio of Tresidder Union, the sun
reflecting off their Mickey Mouse and Goofy watches, the
couple is youthful, almost child-like.
Their infectious laughter, mile-a-minute repartee and
spontaneous singing breaks are engaging, uplifting. Boline
is quick to smile and laughs enthusiastically at Evans' antics.
Poised and alert, she is prepared to field any question.
Evans, on the other hand, is distracted. His dark eyes
dart nervously around the Tresidder patio. He seems flus
tered, losing his train of thought half way through each
response.
Both Evans and Boline have extensive vocal experience

and arc members of the Stanford Chamber Chorale. Boline
has given several solo recitals on campus and Evans, a mem
ber of the Fleet Street Singers, is most recognizable for the
energetic, almost psychotic rendition of "Psycho Killer" that
he performed for two years.
Evans tells us a fragmented, but thorough, 45-minute
history of their relationship. The duo met when they were
performing in last year's spring musical, "Evita." And the
clarity with which they recall detail is astounding. They
remember every conversation as if it were part of a script,
every awkward moment and sideways glance as if it were a
stage direction.
Which probably isn't surprising considering the roles
they hove played onstage. This winter Boline and Evans por
trayed Adam and Eve in "One Bad Apple," and they are cur
rently playing Cinderella and Cinderella's Prince in "Into
the Woods."
Intermission: You've been cast as Adam and Eve in "One
Bad Apple" and more recently, as Cinderella and Cin
derella's Prince in "Into the Woods." Do you feel that your
personal relationship ever gets in the way of your acting or
does it enhance it?
Kathye Boline: Do you want to answer first, or do you want
me to answer first?
Ben Evans: Um, you can answer first.

KB: OK, for me ..
BE; What was the question?
KB: For me, it makes it better. During "One Bad Apple," it
gave me a lot of confidence that I never would have had oth
erwise.
I: Confidence in what?
KB: In my abilities. Because I never considered myself an
actress at all, and never wanted to be an actress.
I: What kind of performer do you consider yourself, then?
BE: Oh, definitely dancers. Certainly dancers. We just hide
it really well.
BE: I think when I was younger, it was singing that got me
roles. But I think it depends on where you are. If you're
around a lot of singers, then you're primarily an actor. If
you're around a lot of people who act really well, then you're
probably primarily a singer.
I: How do you like being billed as the Ram's Head "vomit
couple"?
KB: I'm sorry. I must confess — I like it.
BE: Yeah, it's pretty appropriate. I mean, it doesn't seem like
too much of a stretch for people to come up with that title.
I: So do you think it's coincidence that you were cast as Cin
derella and Cinderella's Prince?
KB: Kind of. I don't think it's coincidence that we were
Adam and Eve. I think that if Ben hadn't been Adam, they
never would have cast me as Eve. I think we were more obvi
ously suited for the "Into the Woods" roles than for Adam
and Eve, don't you think?
I: So what was it like making out onstage during "One Bad
Apple"?
BE: Same as making out offstage. But with more people
watching.
I: What roles would you most like to play in a musical? Or,
what roles would you like to play as a couple?
KB: Right now I think "Into the Woods" is my favorite show
because all my life I've wanted to be in a fairy tale. I wanted
to be Cinderella in the Walt Disney version. That was my
dream my whole life. And I also think that "Into the
Woods" has a lot to say about the lengths to which you'll go
to get what you want — or think you need. It kind of puts
your life in perspective.
Another role I've wanted to play ever since I first saw it
done, which was when I was about 15, is Susanna in"The
Marriage of Figaro," which is an opera. And I'll never do it
because I'm not strong enough ...
BE: It requires a lot of weight lifting.
KB: No, it requires a lot of stamina. It's a four-hour Mozart
opera. And Susanna's really cool. She's a chambermaid, and
she plays all these great jokes on the royalty and kind of gets
what she wants in the end.
BE: Well, I don't want to play Susanna, but I think "Into the
Woods" is probably my favorite musical too. There are so
