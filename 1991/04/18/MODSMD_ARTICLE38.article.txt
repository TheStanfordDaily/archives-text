Looking at the couple seated close to each other on
the dressing room couch, it is difficult to deter
mine where she ends and he begins. Their
straight hair is the same shade of tawny brown;
their blue eyes match his navy sweater (given to
him by her). They anticipate each other's thoughts and
actions; they laugh at the same jokes; they finish each
other's sentences. In fact, people often mistake Debbie
Wicks and Chris La Puma for siblings.
After decades of marriage, couples are expected to look
and think alike. But these two Stanford seniors have known
each other for fewer than four years.
And while maintaining a three-year relationship in col
lege is a remarkable feat in itself, this couple, well-known in
campus theatrical circles, excels in far more significant
ways.
Wicks is an accomplished singer, composer, conductor
and producer; La Puma is a director, actor, playwright and
producer. Together, they have been the leading players in six
campus productions. Separately, they've participated in
almost every major — and many minor — dramatic
endeavor on campus for the past four years.
La Puma, who is directing the Ram's Head musical "Into
the Woods,'' is double majoring in drama and American
studies. He has directed or assistant-directed 13 plays since
his freshman year, including dorm musicals, Drama
Department productions, Gaieties '89 and "Musing," a
Ram's Head

It's a wonderful thing that we both love
the theater the way we do. Only someone
equally involved and immersed in the
theater could understand the commit
ment involved.

Sponsored by Ram's Head Theatrical Society, "One Bad
Apple" was performed on campus this winter — and
opened, appropriately, on St. Valentine's Day.
Intermission: So how did you meet? Or should I say, when
did you start working together?
Debbie Wicks: We worked on Gaieties together our sopho
more year ('88). It was an entirely female staff except for
Chris, which I think is significant. He was the lonely male
among all these women.
Chris La Puma: Not that lonely.
DW: We spent long hours together working on the show.
CLP: I think the key to our relationship was the costume
designer mysteriously disappearing three days before the
show.
DW: We had no costumes. The artistic staff had to spend
all-nighters making foam rubber 6-foot hot dogs. It was
definitely a bonding experience.
I: What happened after the show?
DW: Well, what happens is you spend all this concentrated
time together, and then BOOM! The show is over but you
still want to be together.
CLP: I just kept calling and pestering her after the show
until she went out with me.
I: Has it been hard keeping it together?
Debbie nods but Chris shakes his head. They laugh.
DW: Well, there are 1,000 show relationships but we
decided that our friendship was stronger; that we were
going to last. It's a wonderful thing that we both love the
theater the way we do. Only someone equally involved and
immersed in the theater could understand the commitment

involved and why we spend so much time with it. I mean if
Chris was an engineer, or if I was, it would be impossible to
understand.
I: What have you worked on together since then?
CLP: Well, that spring I directed a one-act for my directing
class in the Drama Department, and I cast Debbie as the
lead The following fall we did Gaieties together. I
directed and Debbie was composer.
DW: It was wonderful to work together since we communi
cate so well. And it was much easier than the year before. It
went really smoothly — for Gaieties.
CLP: Then last year, I lived in Burbank and we decided to
do a last-minute dorm musical. Debbie didn't live there, but
DW: We've never drawn together, I'll have you know.
CLP:... But she was a surrogate Burbank resident. Anyway
it was the first time she auditioned for me.
DW: It was horrible because usually when you don't get the
part you want, you blame the director. You say, "Well, he
doesn't know me, he doesn't know what I can do." But you
can't say that when it's your boyfriend. Never have someone
you love judge you.
I: This year you did "One Bad Apple" together; how did the
idea for that come about?
CLP: It was Debbie's idea. She had applied for a grant to
write "One Bad Apple." She asked me to write the book, and
I said OK.
DW: We both worked at Interlachen National Music Camp
last summer, and we started work on "One Bad Apple."

"One Bad Apple"
together, comical
couple Debbie
Wicks and Chris
La Puma collabo
rate once again
on "Into the
Woods," with La
Puma backstage
directing and
Wicks onstage
playing Jack's
Mother.
After the summer, we had a month
before school started to work on the
play. I lived at Chris' house with his
family so we could work really closely
together. We lived and breathed "One
Bad Apple." It was like having our first
baby.
CLP: Yeah. Most of the work was
before.
I: How did you divide the labor (so to
speak)? Chris, did you do any of the
music, or did Debbie write any of the
book?
CLP: She was definitely the composer.
I wrote the book and we split the
lyrics. It was a pretty tight collabora
tion.
DW: It's amazing how well we collabo
rated. We didn't get too egocentric or
go crazy. Besides the fact that we're
going out, it's very easy, when anyone
makes a negative comment about your
work, to get very bruised. Chris did.
But then he learned He sulked a
little bit.
CLP: Then I changed it.
I: How do you feel about the results?
DW: I was really glad that Chris was
around during "One Bad Apple"
because I was a mess. "One Bad Apple"
— more than any other show I've done
here — was crazy. I was just terrified.
We had this joke that we would judge
our relationship by whether or not
"One Bad Apple" was a success.
CLP: We got a standing ovation, so we
figured things were going pretty well.
DW: God, what if everything we did
was a complete flop? We'd be so
depressed! But then we'd need each
other even more.

CLP: We should also mention your
award. Debbie won the Dean's Award
for Academic Excellence for the score
of "One Bad Apple," which was 400
pages long.
DW: The show's score was my honor's
thesis in music. It was very exciting
that they gave an academic award to
someone in the arts — very exciting
for the Music Department. My father,
who still wants me to get a real major,
was also very excited.
I: How about "Into the Woods;" how
do you feel about working together on
this project, the last of your college
careers?
CLP: Well, from the start Debbie was
very upset about auditioning for me
again.
DW: I've never had a good part in a
spring musical. Just little cattle-chorus
roles. So from the start I had a lot rid
ing on the audition. Too much.
CLP: So we made a pact that we
wouldn't see each other for the two
weeks surrounding auditions.
DW: The last thing we needed was
people giving us a hard time about
being a couple. You know, comments
about "sleeping with the director" and
all. I just didn't want to hear it.
I: You're both graduating seniors, what
happens now?
DW: Chris and I both applied to grad
uate school in New York at NYU's
Tisch School of the Arts. We both
applied to the musical theater pro
gram — me in composition and him
in writing.
I: Debbie, do you see yourself as a
composer first or a singer? Chris, a
director or an actor?
CLP: I'm actually a director who tries
to know everything he can about the
theater in order to be a good director.
I've taken courses on lighting, stage

design and costumes, but my main
focus is directing.
DW: Good answer. I don't know about
myself. It's posing a problem with grad
school, whether to go to performance
school for two years or composition.
I'm really not willing to give up either
one.

DW: We had no costumes. The artistic staff had to spend
all-nighters making foam rubber 6-foot hot dogs. It was
definitely a bonding experience.
I: What happened after the show?
DW: Well, what happens is you spend all this concentrated
time together, and then BOOM! The show is over but you
still want to be together.
CLP: I just kept calling and pestering her after the show
until she went out with me.
I: Has it been hard keeping it together?
Debbie nods but Chris shakes his head. They laugh.
DW: Well, there are 1,000 show relationships but we
decided that our friendship was stronger; that we were
going to last. It's a wonderful thing that we both love the
theater the way we do. Only someone equally involved and
immersed in the theater could understand the commitment

involved and why we spend so much time with it. I mean if
Chris was an engineer, or if I was, it would be impossible to
understand.
I: What have you worked on together since then?
CLP: Well, that spring I directed a one-act for my directing
class in the Drama Department, and I cast Debbie as the
lead The following fall we did Gaieties together. I
directed and Debbie was composer.
DW: It was wonderful to work together since we communi
cate so well. And it was much easier than the year before. It
went really smoothly — for Gaieties.
CLP: Then last year, I lived in Burbank and we decided to
do a last-minute dorm musical. Debbie didn't live there, but
DW: We've never drawn together, I'll have you know.
CLP:... But she was a surrogate Burbank resident. Anyway
it was the first time she auditioned for me.
DW: It was horrible because usually when you don't get the
part you want, you blame the director. You say, "Well, he
doesn't know me, he doesn't know what I can do." But you
can't say that when it's your boyfriend. Never have someone
you love judge you.
I: This year you did "One Bad Apple" together; how did the
idea for that come about?
CLP: It was Debbie's idea. She had applied for a grant to
write "One Bad Apple." She asked me to write the book, and
I said OK.
DW: We both worked at Interlachen National Music Camp
last summer, and we started work on "One Bad Apple."




After writing
"One Bad Apple"
together, comical
couple Debbie
Wicks and Chris
La Puma collabo
rate once again
on "Into the
Woods," with La
Puma backstage
directing and
Wicks onstage
playing Jack's
Mother.
After the summer, we had a month
before school started to work on the
play. I lived at Chris' house with his
family so we could work really closely
together. We lived and breathed "One
Bad Apple." It was like having our first
baby.
CLP: Yeah. Most of the work was
before.
I: How did you divide the labor (so to
speak)? Chris, did you do any of the
music, or did Debbie write any of the
book?
CLP: She was definitely the composer.
I wrote the book and we split the
lyrics. It was a pretty tight collabora
tion.
DW: It's amazing how well we collabo
rated. We didn't get too egocentric or
go crazy. Besides the fact that we're
going out, it's very easy, when anyone
makes a negative comment about your
work, to get very bruised. Chris did.
But then he learned He sulked a
little bit.
CLP: Then I changed it.
I: How do you feel about the results?
DW: I was really glad that Chris was
around during "One Bad Apple"
because I was a mess. "One Bad Apple"
— more than any other show I've done
here — was crazy. I was just terrified.
We had this joke that we would judge
our relationship by whether or not
"One Bad Apple" was a success.
CLP: We got a standing ovation, so we
figured things were going pretty well.
DW: God, what if everything we did
was a complete flop? We'd be so
depressed! But then we'd need each
other even more.

CLP: We should also mention your
award. Debbie won the Dean's Award
for Academic Excellence for the score
of "One Bad Apple," which was 400
pages long.
DW: The show's score was my honor's
thesis in music. It was very exciting
that they gave an academic award to
someone in the arts — very exciting
for the Music Department. My father,
who still wants me to get a real major,
was also very excited.
I: How about "Into the Woods;" how
do you feel about working together on
this project, the last of your college
careers?
CLP: Well, from the start Debbie was
very upset about auditioning for me
again.
DW: I've never had a good part in a
spring musical. Just little cattle-chorus
roles. So from the start I had a lot rid
ing on the audition. Too much.
CLP: So we made a pact that we
wouldn't see each other for the two
weeks surrounding auditions.
DW: The last thing we needed was
people giving us a hard time about
being a couple. You know, comments
about "sleeping with the director" and
all. I just didn't want to hear it.
I: You're both graduating seniors, what
happens now?
DW: Chris and I both applied to grad
uate school in New York at NYU's
Tisch School of the Arts. We both
applied to the musical theater pro
gram — me in composition and him
in writing.
I: Debbie, do you see yourself as a
composer first or a singer? Chris, a
director or an actor?
CLP: I'm actually a director who tries
to know everything he can about the
theater in order to be a good director.
I've taken courses on lighting, stage

design and costumes, but my main
focus is directing.
DW: Good answer. I don't know about
myself. It's posing a problem with grad
school, whether to go to performance
school for two years or composition.
I'm really not willing to give up either
one.
Looking at the couple seated close to each other on
the dressing room couch, it is difficult to deter
mine where she ends and he begins. Their
straight hair is the same shade of tawny brown;
their blue eyes match his navy sweater (given to
him by her). They anticipate each other's thoughts and
actions; they laugh at the same jokes; they finish each
other's sentences. In fact, people often mistake Debbie
Wicks and Chris La Puma for siblings.
After decades of marriage, couples are expected to look
and think alike. But these two Stanford seniors have known
each other for fewer than four years.
And while maintaining a three-year relationship in col
lege is a remarkable feat in itself, this couple, well-known in
campus theatrical circles, excels in far more significant
ways.
Wicks is an accomplished singer, composer, conductor
and producer; La Puma is a director, actor, playwright and
producer. Together, they have been the leading players in six
campus productions. Separately, they've participated in
almost every major — and many minor — dramatic
endeavor on campus for the past four years.
La Puma, who is directing the Ram's Head musical "Into
the Woods,'' is double majoring in drama and American
studies. He has directed or assistant-directed 13 plays since
his freshman year, including dorm musicals, Drama
Department productions, Gaieties '89 and "Musing," a
Ram's Head

It's a wonderful thing that we both love
the theater the way we do. Only someone
equally involved and immersed in the
theater could understand the commit
ment involved.

as numerous dorm productions. She
has composed and conducted music
for Gaieties and last year she released
an album of original vocal works.

Intermission: So how did you meet? Or should I say, when
did you start working together?
Debbie Wicks: We worked on Gaieties together our sopho
more year ('88). It was an entirely female staff except for
Chris, which I think is significant. He was the lonely male
among all these women.
Chris La Puma: Not that lonely.
DW: We spent long hours together working on the show.

rated. We didn't get too egocentric or
go crazy. Besides the fact that we're
going out, it's very easy, when anyone
makes a negative comment about your
work, to get very bruised. Chris did.
But then he learned He sulked a
little bit.
CLP: Then I changed it.
I: How do you feel about the results?
DW: I was really glad that Chris was
around during "One Bad Apple"
because I was a mess. "One Bad Apple"
— more than any other show I've done
here — was crazy. I was just terrified.
We had this joke that we would judge
our relationship by whether or not
"One Bad Apple" was a success.
CLP: We got a standing ovation, so we
figured things were going pretty well.
DW: God, what if everything we did
was a complete flop? We'd be so
depressed! But then we'd need each
other even more.

CLP: We should also mention your
award. Debbie won the Dean's Award
for Academic Excellence for the score
of "One Bad Apple," which was 400
pages long.
DW: The show's score was my honor's
thesis in music. It was very exciting
that they gave an academic award to
someone in the arts — very exciting
for the Music Department. My father,
who still wants me to get a real major,
was also very excited.
I: How about "Into the Woods;" how
do you feel about working together on
this project, the last of your college
careers?
CLP: Well, from the start Debbie was
very upset about auditioning for me
again.
DW: I've never had a good part in a
spring musical. Just little cattle-chorus
roles. So from the start I had a lot rid
ing on the audition. Too much.
CLP: So we made a pact that we
wouldn't see each other for the two
weeks surrounding auditions.
DW: The last thing we needed was
people giving us a hard time about
being a couple. You know, comments
about "sleeping with the director" and
all. I just didn't want to hear it.
I: You're both graduating seniors, what
happens now?
DW: Chris and I both applied to grad
uate school in New York at NYU's
Tisch School of the Arts. We both
applied to the musical theater pro
gram — me in composition and him
in writing.
I: Debbie, do you see yourself as a
composer first or a singer? Chris, a
director or an actor?
CLP: I'm actually a director who tries
to know everything he can about the
theater in order to be a good director.
I've taken courses on lighting, stage

design and costumes, but my main
focus is directing.
DW: Good answer. I don't know about
myself. It's posing a problem with grad
school, whether to go to performance
school for two years or composition.
I'm really not willing to give up either
one.
