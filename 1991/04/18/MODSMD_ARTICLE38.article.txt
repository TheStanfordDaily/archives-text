Looking at the couple seated close to each other on
the dressing room couch, it is difficult to deter
mine where she ends and he begins. Their
straight hair is the same shade of tawny brown;
their blue eyes match his navy sweater (given to
him by her). They anticipate each other's thoughts and
actions; they laugh at the same jokes; they finish each
other's sentences. In fact, people often mistake Debbie
Wicks and Chris La Puma for siblings.
After decades of marriage, couples are expected to look
and think alike. But these two Stanford seniors have known
each other for fewer than four years.
And while maintaining a three-year relationship in col
lege is a remarkable feat in itself, this couple, well-known in
campus theatrical circles, excels in far more significant
ways.
Wicks is an accomplished singer, composer, conductor
and producer; La Puma is a director, actor, playwright and
producer. Together, they have been the leading players in six
campus productions. Separately, they've participated in
almost every major — and many minor — dramatic
endeavor on campus for the past four years.
La Puma, who is directing the Ram's Head musical "Into
the Woods,'' is double majoring in drama and American
studies. He has directed or assistant-directed 13 plays since
his freshman year, including dorm musicals, Drama
Department productions, Gaieties '89 and "Musing," a

Wicks, who plays Jack's Mother in
"Into the Woods," is also double
majoring, in music and communica
tion. She has also performed in Ram's
Head musicals "Evita," "A Chorus
Line" and "Upwardly Mobile," as well
as numerous dorm productions. She
has composed and conducted music
for Gaieties and last year she released
an album of original vocal works.
The couple's most notable collabo

by Wicks and La Puma. The show re

Sponsored by Ram's Head Theatrical Society, "One Bad
Apple" was performed on campus this winter — and
opened, appropriately, on St. Valentine's Day.
Intermission: So how did you meet? Or should I say, when
did you start working together?
Debbie Wicks: We worked on Gaieties together our sopho
more year ('88). It was an entirely female staff except for
Chris, which I think is significant. He was the lonely male
among all these women.
Chris La Puma: Not that lonely.
DW: We spent long hours together working on the show.
CLP: I think the key to our relationship was the costume
designer mysteriously disappearing three days before the
show.
DW: We had no costumes. The artistic staff had to spend
all-nighters making foam rubber 6-foot hot dogs. It was
definitely a bonding experience.
I: What happened after the show?
DW: Well, what happens is you spend all this concentrated
time together, and then BOOM! The show is over but you
still want to be together.
CLP: I just kept calling and pestering her after the show
until she went out with me.
I: Has it been hard keeping it together?
Debbie nods but Chris shakes his head. They laugh.
DW: Well, there are 1,000 show relationships but we
decided that our friendship was stronger; that we were
going to last. It's a wonderful thing that we both love the
theater the way we do. Only someone equally involved and
immersed in the theater could understand the commitment

involved and why we spend so much time with it. I mean if
Chris was an engineer, or if I was, it would be impossible to
understand.
I: What have you worked on together since then?
CLP: Well, that spring I directed a one-act for my directing
class in the Drama Department, and I cast Debbie as the
lead The following fall we did Gaieties together. I
directed and Debbie was composer.
DW: It was wonderful to work together since we communi
cate so well. And it was much easier than the year before. It
went really smoothly — for Gaieties.
CLP: Then last year, I lived in Burbank and we decided to
do a last-minute dorm musical. Debbie didn't live there, but
DW: We've never drawn together, I'll have you know.
CLP:... But she was a surrogate Burbank resident. Anyway
it was the first time she auditioned for me.
DW: It was horrible because usually when you don't get the
part you want, you blame the director. You say, "Well, he
doesn't know me, he doesn't know what I can do." But you
can't say that when it's your boyfriend. Never have someone
you love judge you.
I: This year you did "One Bad Apple" together; how did the
idea for that come about?
CLP: It was Debbie's idea. She had applied for a grant to
write "One Bad Apple." She asked me to write the book, and
I said OK.
DW: We both worked at Interlachen National Music Camp
last summer, and we started work on "One Bad Apple."
