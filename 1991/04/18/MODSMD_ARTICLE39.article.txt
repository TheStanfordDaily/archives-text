Perched on a cliff overlooking the Pacific, the Moss
Beach Distillery has always had location working in its
favor.
Gone are the days of Prohibition when the seaside estab
lishment doubled as a major boot-legging outpost. But the
restaurant still draws beach-goers in for fresh seafood and a
fabulous view of the sunset, just as it did when it opened in
1927.
Windows line three sides of the Distillery's small, semi
circular dining room, providing an unobstructed view of
the ocean. Sunshine floods the restaurant during the after
noon, and candles are lit at dusk as the natural light wanes
and the windows turn a dark, muted blue.
Hanging plants and several restored black-and-white
photos adorn the warm, wood walls, and the blue-and
white checked tablecloths lend the dining room a casual, yet
intimate, atmosphere.
The waitresses at the Distillery are friendly and the food
is well-prepared. The menu boasts a variety of seafood and
steak dishes which range from $15-18. But if the prices of
entrees, which reflect the cost of the ocean view, are too

steep, less expensive fare is available in the restaurant's
adjoining bar.
Several appealing dinner specials augmented the usual
menu the night we visited the Distillery, and after much
indecision, we decided on the Chilean salmon (a special)
and the cioppino and linguine, both $17.95.
Cioppino and linguine consists of prawns, clams, crab,
scallops and the catch of the day, simmered in a slightly
spicy red sauce and served in a black crock with linguine on
the side.
The mesquite-grilled salmon was particularly good: very
moist, with a unique flavor. And the rice accompanying it
was a suitable partner to the substantial steak of fish.
Both meals came with warm bread and a choice of clam
chowder — which was a bit salty — or a salad bar, a better
choice with fresh, crisp vegetables served on chilled plates.
A recommended side order is the steamed artichoke
stuffed with tasty sauteed mushrooms. Drawn butter and
mayonnaise are served alongside this dish, which is easily
large enough to be shared.
Although we were far from hungry at the end of the
meal, we could hardly resist a dessert with the word "deca
dence" in its name. And Distillery Decadence ($3.50), with
rich chocolate brownies topped with Bud's coffee ice cream
and smothered in hot fudge, lived up to our expectations.
Dinner at the Moss Beach Distillery is an excellent way
to end a day at the shore. And while the dining room prices
are high, you can always watch the sunset from outside,
then head to the bar for a bucket of fresh mussels and a cold
beer.
