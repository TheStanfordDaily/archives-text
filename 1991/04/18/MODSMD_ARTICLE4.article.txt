# Author decries PC views
## Stanford used as example of intolerence

Dinesh D'Souza prompted both applause
and outrage last night when he said that
the term "diversity" is being used to pro
voke conformity.
Author of the recently published "Illib
eral Education: Politics of Race and Sex on
Campus," D'Souza told an audience of 175
people in History Corner that while he sup
ports multiculturalism, he disagrees with
the the approach that many top universi
ties have taken toward instituting it.

In D'Souza's book, which talks about the
debate over Western Culture and the Cul
tures, Ideas and Values curriculum two
years ago, the University figures as an
example of intolerance in the development
of multiculturalism.
"American universities have embarked
on a kind of silent revolution for pluralism,
multiculturalism and diversity. My argu
ment is not over these goals but over the
means universities use to achieve them."
In a question-and-answer
period following his talk, Values,
Technology, Science and Society
Prof. Barry Katz challenged
D'Souza by saying, "Your book
was the most grotesque carica
ture of the CIV debate and its res
olution that I've ever read. I was
on the verge of hysterical laugh
ter as I read it."
For the most part, however, the
audience supported D'Souza's
comments, laughing when he
asked, "What does it mean to say
the curriculum is a white male
heterosexual construct? What
does Newton's white maleness
have to do with the theory of
gravity? Certainly it doesn't mean
that an Indian who jumps from a
tall tower doesn't fall to the
ground."
Multiculturalism in education
has become "a perverse cultural
Olympics," D'Souza said. "Each
group comes to the reading list
and asks, 'What did my guys do?"'
"I don't feel I shouldn't read
Dickens because the British
invaded India. And it's possible
for me to make Martin Luther
King my role model. Shouldn't
the purpose of education be to
make that empathetic leap so we
can understand others who are
very different from us?
"Professors have been hec

tored and harangued for express
ing controversial but reasonable
views," he said. "It's not hard to
see why the enforcement of politi
cally correct views and even man
ners is antithetical to any institu
tion that seeks wide debate."
D'Souza said the same forces
behind multiculturalism are also
responsible for affirmative action.
"Do not be under the illusion that
affirmative action increases the
number of minorities in higher
education," he said. "What it does
is determine where . . . the minor
ity is placed" within higher educa
tion.
After this phenomenon devel
oped, university leaders termed it
"pluralism" and pretended that it
had been their aim, he said.
"In their squid-like, amor
phous cloud of rhetoric," they
allowed the term to be confused
with integration. "But they are
not the same.
"Pluralism means celebrating
your differences; integration
means blending together," he
said. "Pluralism results in ethnic
platoons on campus."
After the talk, junior John
Abbot, who heads the Stanford
College Republicans, said, "We
need that kind of debate around
here."
Berkeley law student Paul
Almanza had a different opinion.
"That guy was an Uncle Tom," he
said. "That was a complete waste
of time."
