Dinesh D'Souza prompted both applause
and outrage last night when he said that
the term "diversity" is being used to pro
voke conformity.
Author of the recently published "Illib
eral Education: Politics of Race and Sex on
Campus," D'Souza told an audience of 175
people in History Corner that while he sup
ports multiculturalism, he disagrees with
the the approach that many top universi
ties have taken toward instituting it.

In D'Souza's book, which talks about the
debate over Western Culture and the Cul
tures, Ideas and Values curriculum two
years ago, the University figures as an
example of intolerance in the development
of multiculturalism.
"American universities have embarked
on a kind of silent revolution for pluralism,
multiculturalism and diversity. My argu
ment is not over these goals but over the
means universities use to achieve them."
