# Car tunes: music to cruise to
## 
### 
Intermission knows no bounds. On Valentine's Day,
we presented you with our top 69 make-out songs.
We included tunes like Bob Seger's "Night Moves"
and Meatloaf s "Paradise By the Dashboard Light."
This week we've revved up and are unleashing the top 12
automobile-related songs of all time.
A few notes about our standards for selection: Songs
must deal primarily with an automobile or the act of
driving one. To be considered eligible, a song's title need
not specifically mention "drive," "car" or anything like
that. "Fun, Fun, Fun" by the Beach Boys was considered
eligible, for example, because of the wonderful refer
ences to daddy's T-bird.
Mere mention of the word "driving," "driven" or
"drove" does not make a song eligible. For example,
"Driven to Tears" by the Police — though a pretty
decent tune — wasn't considered for our list because it's
not really about rocking down the highway.
Oddly enough, many of the songs that were included
in February's make-out list were considered for the auto
mobile-related compilation. We're not sure what that
says about American sexual practices.
Enough babbling. Here's the list, in reverse order.
12. "Baby, You Can Drive My Car," by the Beatles. A
song about trust.
11. "Fast Car," by Tracy Chapman. A song about
despair and hope for a better future.
10. "Greased Lightning," by John Travolta and the

rest of the cast of "Grease." A song about fast cars and
fast women.
9 (tie). "Trans Am (Highway Wonderland)," by
Sammy Hagar, and "Bad Motor Scooter," by Montrose,
featuring Sammy Hagar on lead vocals. Songs about
Sammy moving at high speeds. (Honorable mention: "I
Can't Drive 55.")
8. "You Drive, I'll Steer," by Cheap Trick. A song
about relationships.
7. "Drivin' My Life Away," by Eddie Rabbit. A song
about fruitless journeys.
6. "Highway to Hell," by AC/DC. A song about an
unpleasant journey.
5. "Theme from Taxi (the television sitcom)," by
Henry Mancini (we think). A song to hum in the show
er.
4 (tie). "Cadillac Ranch," "Pink Cadillac," "Racing in
the Street," "Thunder Road," "Drive All Night," "Dar
lington County" and "Stolen Car," all by Bruce Spring
steen. Songs about passion.
3. "Paradise by the Dashboard Light," by Meatloaf.
Not really a song — but an opera of sorts.
2. "Little Red Corvette," by Prince. One of Prince's
least sexually explicit songs.
1. "Drive," by the Cars. The ultimate song about
automobiles.
John Wagner drives a Buick. 'Nuff said.
