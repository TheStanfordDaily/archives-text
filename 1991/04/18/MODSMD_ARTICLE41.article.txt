# California by car: the state's most scenic (northern) highways
## 
### Mara Winokur Editorial staff 
To some, the term "car trip" may conjure up long
repressed images of never-ending family vacations, com
plete with fighting, flat tires and car sickness. Not to men
tion arguing with your sibling over "back-seat boundaries."
These are the people who use their cars for transporta
tion only: to get from Point A to Point B, as quickly as pos
sible.
But not everyone feels that way, especially in California.
Californians love to drive — anywhere, everywhere and
always. If there's a road, they'll take it, no matter where it
leads.
So climb in and buckle up, we're going on a ride!
U.S. Highway 1: Mention "good" roads in California and
most people will come up with this one, no matter what
kind of driving enthusiasts they are. And while they're
probably thinking of the majestic coastline of Big Sur, in
Central California, there is plenty of worthwhile driving to
be had farther north, near us.
Stretching about 205 miles north of the Golden Gate
Bridge, Highway 1 begins with a canyon-rim view of the
Pacific Ocean. The road squiggles down toward the beach,
creating turns almost as death-defying as those found along
the coast further south. The trail soon relaxes, though, and
you will find gentle curves and sloping hills as you pass
through an area populated by farms, ranches and lagoons.
Be careful to watch out for the ducks that like to wander
into the road to see what's going on.
And you don't have to go too far north for a good view.
Just north of San Francisco, the road winds past numerous
preserves and parks, many of which offer free day use of the
trails. Muir Woods, Mt. Tamalpais and Pt. Reyes National
Seashore are all beautiful wilderness areas easily accessible
from Highway 1 in Marin.
And south of San Francisco you'll find (near Half Moon
Bay, San Gregorio, Pacifica, etc.) views that are also very
scenic, if not spectacular. Pack a picnic, and watch the sun
set.
U.S. Highway 17 (17-Mile Drive): While Highway 1 is
the most famous road in California, 17-Mile Drive, stretch
ing down the Monterey Peninsula, is probably the most cel
ebrated. Advertised with its own color brochure, 17-Mile
Drive attracts dozens of tourists every day.
People repeatedly pay $5 (yes, there's a toll booth) to see
the Pacific Ocean, with its sandy beaches, coastal cliffs and
barking seals. An additional bonus is the sight of the well
known Pebble Beach, golf club of the stars. And just as awe
inspiring as the sights of nature are the homes of man; some
are so palatial you'll be sure they comprise entire towns.
U.S. Highway 35: Highway 35 is better known to many

people as Skyline Boulevard, that expanse of road winding
through the mountains behind Stanford. Extending for 26
miles, Highway 35 takes you on one of the most unpre
dictable rides you'll ever experience. One minute the road is
easy, straight and smooth for miles, the next it twists and
turns like a tornado, forcing you to slow down and hang on.

While Highway 1 is the most
famous road in California, 17-Mile
Drive, stretching down the Mon
terey Peninsula, is probably the
most celebrated.

Unlike the previous two roads, Highway 35 does not give
you a consistant view of the Pacific. Occasionally, you can
catch a glimpse of the majestic coastline, but mostly you'll
travel through coastal redwood forests, looking out over the
last mountain range before the ocean. And what a view it is.
U.S. Highway 36: Highway 36 links U.S. Interstate 5 with
U.S. Highway 101. It runs about 140 miles from end to end,
and takes a while to travel, mostly due to its older and well
worn nature. This is not a road for those in a hurry.
It is, however, a road for those who want to enjoy a
course of hills and curves so tricky that many drivers
become airborne at high speeds. It is also for those who take
pleasure in redwood groves and oak-studded foothills. And
for those who like to see "the way things were" on highways.
U.S. Highway 89: If the views you crave are of the rural
variety, Highway 89 is the road for you. Full of splendid
scenery, and easy on the hairpin turns, Highway 89 is a
"looker's" dream. You'll find a "Kodak Picture Spot" just
about everywhere.
Traversing over 360 miles, this trail to Tahoe takes you
through the woods, over mountains and through valleys.
You may not get to grandmother's house, but you'll sure
have a good time trying.
U.S. Highway 128: No discussion of Northern California
roads would be complete without covering the wine coun
try, one of the most popular areas for natives and tourists
alike. Highway 128 takes you through the vineyards that
make wine country what it is, and into canyon country,
spotted with streams and tranquil lakes. Heading 50 miles
east from Rutherford (where it intersects with U.S. Highway
29), Highway 128 provides a cool mountain getaway from
the hustle of Napa Valley.

Naturally, there are many more roads which would quell
your rambling urges; many which are even closer and more
accessible than the ones mentioned here. Mt. Hamilton
Drive, for instance, leads out of San Jose up to the Link
Observatory (on top of Mt. Hamilton). Even if you don't
make it to the top, the view from midway is worth the trip.

And, believe it or not, Page Mill Road is quite a scenic
trail as well. Flecked with expensive — but tasteful —
houses and with a view of the valley, Page Mill can make
you realize there's more to it than the Palo Alto Square.
Much more.
Happy trails!

miles, Highway 35 takes you on one of the most unpre
dictable rides you'll ever experience. One minute the road is
easy, straight and smooth for miles, the next it twists and
turns like a tornado, forcing you to slow down and hang on.

While Highway 1 is the most
famous road in California, 17-Mile
Drive, stretching down the Mon
terey Peninsula, is probably the
most celebrated.

Unlike the previous two roads, Highway 35 does not give
you a consistant view of the Pacific. Occasionally, you can
catch a glimpse of the majestic coastline, but mostly you'll
travel through coastal redwood forests, looking out over the
last mountain range before the ocean. And what a view it is.
U.S. Highway 36: Highway 36 links U.S. Interstate 5 with
U.S. Highway 101. It runs about 140 miles from end to end,
and takes a while to travel, mostly due to its older and well
worn nature. This is not a road for those in a hurry.
It is, however, a road for those who want to enjoy a
course of hills and curves so tricky that many drivers
become airborne at high speeds. It is also for those who take
pleasure in redwood groves and oak-studded foothills. And
for those who like to see "the way things were" on highways.
U.S. Highway 89: If the views you crave are of the rural
variety, Highway 89 is the road for you. Full of splendid
scenery, and easy on the hairpin turns, Highway 89 is a
"looker's" dream. You'll find a "Kodak Picture Spot" just
about everywhere.
Traversing over 360 miles, this trail to Tahoe takes you
through the woods, over mountains and through valleys.
You may not get to grandmother's house, but you'll sure
have a good time trying.
U.S. Highway 128: No discussion of Northern California
roads would be complete without covering the wine coun
try, one of the most popular areas for natives and tourists
alike. Highway 128 takes you through the vineyards that
make wine country what it is, and into canyon country,
spotted with streams and tranquil lakes. Heading 50 miles
east from Rutherford (where it intersects with U.S. Highway
29), Highway 128 provides a cool mountain getaway from
the hustle of Napa Valley.

Naturally, there are many more roads which would quell
your rambling urges; many which are even closer and more
accessible than the ones mentioned here. Mt. Hamilton
Drive, for instance, leads out of San Jose up to the Link
Observatory (on top of Mt. Hamilton). Even if you don't
make it to the top, the view from midway is worth the trip.

And, believe it or not, Page Mill Road is quite a scenic
trail as well. Flecked with expensive — but tasteful —
houses and with a view of the valley, Page Mill can make
you realize there's more to it than the Palo Alto Square.
Much more.
Happy trails!

To some, the term "car trip" may conjure up long
repressed images of never-ending family vacations, com
plete with fighting, flat tires and car sickness. Not to men
tion arguing with your sibling over "back-seat boundaries."
These are the people who use their cars for transporta
tion only: to get from Point A to Point B, as quickly as pos
sible.
But not everyone feels that way, especially in California.
Californians love to drive — anywhere, everywhere and
always. If there's a road, they'll take it, no matter where it
leads.
So climb in and buckle up, we're going on a ride!
U.S. Highway 1: Mention "good" roads in California and
most people will come up with this one, no matter what
kind of driving enthusiasts they are. And while they're
probably thinking of the majestic coastline of Big Sur, in
Central California, there is plenty of worthwhile driving to
be had farther north, near us.
Stretching about 205 miles north of the Golden Gate
Bridge, Highway 1 begins with a canyon-rim view of the
Pacific Ocean. The road squiggles down toward the beach,
creating turns almost as death-defying as those found along
the coast further south. The trail soon relaxes, though, and
you will find gentle curves and sloping hills as you pass
through an area populated by farms, ranches and lagoons.
Be careful to watch out for the ducks that like to wander
into the road to see what's going on.
And you don't have to go too far north for a good view.
Just north of San Francisco, the road winds past numerous
preserves and parks, many of which offer free day use of the
trails. Muir Woods, Mt. Tamalpais and Pt. Reyes National
Seashore are all beautiful wilderness areas easily accessible
from Highway 1 in Marin.
And south of San Francisco you'll find (near Half Moon
Bay, San Gregorio, Pacifica, etc.) views that are also very
scenic, if not spectacular. Pack a picnic, and watch the sun
set.
U.S. Highway 17 (17-Mile Drive): While Highway 1 is
the most famous road in California, 17-Mile Drive, stretch
ing down the Monterey Peninsula, is probably the most cel
ebrated. Advertised with its own color brochure, 17-Mile
Drive attracts dozens of tourists every day.
People repeatedly pay $5 (yes, there's a toll booth) to see
the Pacific Ocean, with its sandy beaches, coastal cliffs and
barking seals. An additional bonus is the sight of the well
known Pebble Beach, golf club of the stars. And just as awe
inspiring as the sights of nature are the homes of man; some
are so palatial you'll be sure they comprise entire towns.
U.S. Highway 35: Highway 35 is better known to many

people as Skyline Boulevard, that expanse of road winding
through the mountains behind Stanford. Extending for 26
miles, Highway 35 takes you on one of the most unpre
dictable rides you'll ever experience. One minute the road is
