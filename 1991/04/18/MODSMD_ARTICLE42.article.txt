"Defending Your Life,* stcoring
Albert Brooks and Meryl Streep
Albert Brooks' amusing life-after
death fantasy, "Defending Your Life,"
details the four-day purgatorial exis
tence of Daniel Miller (played by
writer/director Brooks). Daniel is a
somewhat schleppy, thoroughly neu
rotic advertising executive from Los
Angeles who is brought to trial in the
bureaucratic Judgment City, which
exists somewhere between heaven and
Earth. (There is no hell in this inter
pretation of the afterlife.)
Daniel must demonstrate — by
way of various videotaped scenes of his
earthly existence — that he has lived a
courageous life and therefore, is fit to
move on to a higher spiritual realm. If
he advances in the supernaturally
stratified system, he will also gain
access to a greater portion of his intel
lectual capacity. (Currently, he only
utilizes 3 percent of his brain.) If he
fails to definitively prove his fearless
ness, he will be sent back to Earth to
start anew, a process he has already
undergone 20 times.
During his short stay in the life
after-death landscape that resembles a
cross between Disneyland and a retire
ment community, Daniel falls in love
with the angelic Julia (played by Meryl
Streep). Though Julia seems to have
led a much more fearless, virtuous life
that Daniel, they seem to be a match
made in heaven, or somewhere mighty
close.
Judgment City is an antiseptic
depiction of the pit stop in purgatory

that the angst-ridden Brooks envi
sions. The surreal yet familiar setting
provides for cleverly comic parodies —
take, for example, the Past Lives Pavil
ion in which Shirley MacLaine intro
duces the recently dead to their previ
ous earthly incarnations. Then there's
the hotel lobby sign which reads "Wel
come Kiwanis Dead." Its funny in a
twisted, existentialist kind of way.
Though this lighthearted comedy is
not tremendously deep at first glance,
Daniel has moments of self-discovery
which lend emotional reverberation to
the seemingly gimmicky picture. The
message is clear: Live life to the fullest.
Don't be a wimp. Go for the gusto. Go
see this movie.
