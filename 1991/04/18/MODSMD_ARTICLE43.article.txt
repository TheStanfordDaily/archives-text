'The Marrying Man," starring
Alec Baldwin, Kim Basinger
and Elisabeth Shue
I'm beginning to think Dean Jean
made a mistake.
I mean, I never saw myself as Nobel
Prize material, but I didn't think I was
stupid either. So I don't understand
calculus — neither do a lot of other
people. And yeah, I forget what day of
the week it is, but I'm a busy person;
it's understandable.
And maybe I did I lose $5 when

someone bet me "gullible" was in the
dictionary. So?
I still thought I was fairly intelli
gent.
Until now.
I could deal with all the other con
fusions in my life; I could explain them
away. But this? There's just no explana
tion.
I didn't understand "The Marrying
Man."

Sure, I get the plot: Toothpaste-heir
Charley Pearl (Alec Baldwin) is
engaged to marry the daughter of a
well-known, influential Hollywood
movie mogul. Six days before the wed
ding, however, he meets lounge singer
Vicki Anderson (Kim Basinger).
Despite the fact that Vicki is the
girlfriend of gangster Benny "Bugsy"
Seigel, Charley chases her, gets her and
gets caught. Bugsy, angry enough for

revenge, but not angry enough for
murder, decides to punish the two
"lovebirds" by forcing them to get
married. Immediately.
Needless to say, Charley's fiancee —
and her father — are not pleased.
Anyway, Charley and Vicki get
divorced. And remarried. And
divorced again. And remarried again.
And divorced again. And ... you get
the point.
Well, I get that part. But there are a
whole lot of things that I don't get.
Like whether Charley really loved
his fiancee. Or why he was willing to
risk his life for Vicki. (Look, Basinger
is good-looking, but in movies, she
either looks really good ("Batman") or
really bad ("Blind Date"). Granted, she
doesn't look awful here, but she
doesn't look like risk-your-life mate
rial, either.)
Or why the two got divorced in the
second place. Or the third. (I can fig
ure out why they got divorced the first
time, thank you very much.) Or why
Charley's company fell apart. Or why
Phil Reiser wasn't nearly as funny as
usual.
But most of all, I don't understand
why everybody was wearing modern
day clothes and hairstyles, even though
the movie takes place in the '40s and
'50s.
Laugh all you want, but I'm having
a crisis.

Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger are star-crossed lovers — in"The Marrying
Man" — who decide to tie the knot — over and over and over and over again
— despite their better judgment and Baldwin's previous engagements.
