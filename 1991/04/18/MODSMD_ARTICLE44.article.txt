# Another three-word title for 'kicking butt'
## 
### 
"Out for Justice," starring
Steven Seagal
Steven Seagal movies are beginning
to bore me.
Ever notice how they all sound
remarkably alike? "Above the Law."

"Hard to Kill." "Marked for Death."
"Out for Justice." All his movies have
three-word titles, with just enough
force to make it perfectly clear that
Steven is going to kick some heavy
duty, urban-scum butt.
So, I had "Out for Justice" all fig
ured out before the opening credits
even rolled. Seagal is a tough cop who
goes on a rampage to avenge the death
of his best friend (yawn) and ends up
(Surprise!) making the bad guy really
regret having lived through 90 minutes
of the movie. (I could relate to him
here.)
In a shameless attempt to show Sea
gal can also be a Sensitive Guy, the
makers insert an early scene where he
helps his young son with homework
and then suggests they go play some
catch in the backyard. Nobody ques
tions the authenticity of this scene
when minutes later our hero is driving
a meat cleaver through somebody's
leg.
In a press conference earlier this
year, Seagal announced that he would
deliver an Oscar-caliber performance
in this film. Well, I suppose after this
year's Oscars, anything is possible. But
what category did he think he'd get
nominated for? Best Dressed? There's a
great scene where Seagal arrives at a
crime scene wearing a funky tank top
and a French beret. Maybe it's me, but
I thought cops were a little more
macho than that: Seagal is beginning
to dress like Prince.
OK, so I'm being quite critical and
perhaps unfair. I'll admit that Seagal is
a better actor than his low-budget rival
Jean-Claude Van Damme, but that's
like comparing a skunk to a cowpie:
either way, they both stink. Besides,
Seagal has this very trendy ponytail
that makes him look more like a waiter
in a bottled-water bar than a tough
cop. Perhaps he moonlights as both,
and we'll find out about it in his next
movie, "Out of Evian."
Don't look for me, though. I've had
enough of Seagal's 101 ways to dress
tacky and carry a big gun.
