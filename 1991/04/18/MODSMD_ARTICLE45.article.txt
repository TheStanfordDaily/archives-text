## Kinder, gentler Ash croons in South Tahoe 
### 
Daniel Ash
'Coming Down"
Like Nick Cave, who is also idolized
by doom-and-gloom mall rats, Daniel
Ash seems to be bidding for gigs in
South Lake Tahoe. "Coming Down," a
two-years-in-the-making solo project
from a ground-breaking gothic-pop
artist, is not so inspired as Cave's
recent "Tender Prey," but does mark a
similar transformation from icono
clast rocker to dark Vegas crooner.
The disconcertingly inaudible 50-
second album intro "Blue Moon"
makes us turn the volume way up, only
to be blasted out of our chairs by
"Coming Down Fast." With that
shock, the kindler-gentler Ash is not at
first obvious. Instead, "Coming Down
Fast" is pure Love and Rockets, with
bell sounds, the big electronic sigh of
backing voices and Ash's own pipes
robotically transformed by effects.
But things soften up immediately
thereafter: "Walk This Way" might
almost be a Santana tune and owes its
Latin flavor to co-writer Tito Puente.
Here Ash's voice sounds more natural
than it ever has against a swaying Latin
vamp of a melody and, of all things,
marimbas. Then, on "Closer to You,"
he makes jazzy big band pop without a
big band: slow-motion shooby-doo
wah. Next he transmogrifies "Day
Tripper" with heavy guitars that sound
as if they have weights attached to their
ankles.
The obsessive lyrics of "This Love,"
which employs a chirpy house-disco
beat and a turned-around Gang of
Four riff — make us wonder how Ash
got from the staggering unusualness of
Bauhaus to the "mundaneness" of this
trite love song?
But the album isn't all dubious.

"Sweet Little Liar" and "Not So Fast"
are satisfying cuts. The former has the
most experimental guitar work on the
album, a beat at once grim and
Caribbean and lyrics about darkness
and shadows. The latter is a "hey baby"
song (it even says so), but the lush and
spooky musical environment makes
up for the facile poetics.
