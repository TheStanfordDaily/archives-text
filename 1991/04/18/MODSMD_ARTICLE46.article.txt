# Middle-aged Stones can still rock and roll
## 
### 
Rolling Stones
'Flashpoint'
After weeks of anticipation, April 2
arrived.
I snagged a friend to drive me to
Tower Records and picked up the latest
Rolling Stones release, a 76-minute
extravaganza with 15 live classics plus
two new studio singles.
The album's stark, black-and-red
cover graphics and space-age title
looks more like a Nittzer Ebb indus
trial dance record than a Stones cover.
But that's the key to the Stones in 1991:
asserting their currency in an age when
rock and roll seems to be dying.
Well, these recordings from their
mammoth "Steel Wheels" tour prove
they can still rock hard — even if their
best songs are 20 years old.
If you didn't catch the Stones in
concert in '89, or didn't even want
tickets, then you won't be interested in
this album. But those who want to
hear how these 45 (and up)-year-old
dinosaurs put on the best professional
rock show of the '80s: This is it!
In fact, one of the album's only
shortcomings is its professionalism.
Gone is the ragged, distorted pas
sion of their best live set, "Get Yer Ya
Ya's Out" ('69 tour). But then again,
the sloppy shambles of "Love You
Live" ('76 Tour) are also gone. This is

as tight as the Stones have ever
sounded.
However, it's too bad they stick to
some of the same hits (like "Satisfac
tion," "Start Me Up" and "Jumpin' Jack
Flash") that show up on other live
albums. It would have been nice to
hear more of the album's rare gems like
the foot-stomping version of the
folk/country "Factory Girl," from
"Beggar's Banquet," or the slow, bluesy
"Little Red Rooster," with some siz
zling solos by Eric Clapton.
But all the performances here are
energetic and electric. Even the three
tunes from "Steel Wheels" sound
respectable next to the established
classics.
As a bonus, Stones fans get two new
studio tracks on "Flashpoint."
Their best single in a long time, "High
wire" deftly uses some old riffs in a
new context of intriguing lyrics about
the Gulf war conflict. It's the archetype
of a modern protest song, supporting
our troops while remaining ambiva
lent about the war itself ("sometimes
dictators need a slap on the wrist"),

and criticizing the policies that created
the conflict.
Jagger lashes out about the indis
criminate sale of missiles and tanks to
oil suppliers, but it's ironic to hear him
say, "we act so greedy it makes me sick,
sick, sick"
The album concludes with "Sex
Drive," a lames Brown-like funk vamp
charged by an energetic Charlie Watts
drum beat. Here Jagger growls about
the familiar territory of sexual desire,
with some slick horns and seductive
back-up vocals fueling his lust. It
doesn't have quite the same power and
fresh decadence as it did in the old
days, but it's infectious groove shows
the Stones can still rock and roll into
the '90s.
On "Flashpoint," the Stones
breathe life into their legend for the
live songs and get us to shake our asses
to the new stuff. They may try a bit too
hard sometimes, but mostly they still
hit the mark As long as these old men
keep their sex drives, they and their
music are going to survive.
