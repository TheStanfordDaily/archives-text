The pleasant and agreeable, if
slightly blurry, pop of the new Feelies
album could work for something as
esoteric and disciplined as meditation
or function as a backdrop for the mun

— instead of sung — vocals are buried
under a dense mattress of guitar work,
strummy choruses and anxious, crafty
solos.
After more than 10 years of tenuous
existence, this Jersey band isn't moving
to shake off the Velvet Underground
comparisons. Thus, "Time for a Wit

Melodies and leads, in Feelies terms,

rampant and wild, the overall effect is
a muted, cool, urban energy, not an
unrestrained rawness.
Along these lines fall the primitive
melody of "Sooner or Later" and the
fast-moving but by no means urgent
title track. In this world, tunes keep up
with traffic but don't press their luck
with sudden lane changes, and guitars
work at the measured gait of a Mark
Knopfler.
The precious build up and breathy
rush of the very Lou Reedy "Find A
Way" uses soft percussion and damped
cymbal crashes in the introduction
and then moves to its conclusion with
the barely perceptible shifting of a
minimalist composition. The twin gui
tars of Feelies co-founders Glenn Mer

Coast version of Thin White Rope,
invoking not the open range of the
West but a choked movement along a
turnpike.
