The Collected Poems of Octavio Paz 1957-1987
Edited by Eliot Weinberger
Translated by Eliot Weinberger and others
New Directions, 688 pages, $15.95
Nobel laureate Octavio Paz has been hailed as
Latin America's greatest living poet. This volume,
which includes nearly all of his poetry previously
published in book form, stands as a testament to his
uncommon skill.
Presented in both English and Spanish, many of
Paz's poems draw upon themes of Mexican history
and culture. Other poems were written in and about
India, where Paz served as ambassador for six years.
Still others deal with universal concerns of love and
life.
The poems in this volume vary in length, style and
quality. While most are exceptional, some are merely
acceptable. The great advantage of having them all
collected is that readers may decide for themselves.
Even a Fist Was Once an Open Palm with Fingers
Yehuda Amichai
Translated by Barbara and Benjamin Harshav
Harper Collins, 96 pages, $10.95
The poetry presented in this short volume centers
almost exclusively on Israel; Amichai uses powerful
imagery to evoke scenes of beauty and despair, of
death and hope.
Some of Amichai's better poems are "Anniver
saries of Love," "Throw Pillows" and"I Want to Con
fuse the Bible."
