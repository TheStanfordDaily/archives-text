War Fever
J.G. Ballard

Reviewed by Matthew E. Milliken
J.G. Ballard's greatest fame came with
Steven Spielberg's "Empire of the Sun," the
movie based on Ballard's semi-autobio
graphical novel of the same name. However,
the British author has been known to sci
ence fiction readers for decades, having
written several novels and collections
attributed to that field.
Still, the science fiction label, while
validly describing some of his efforts, fails to
capture the essence of the wide and original
body of work which Ballard has developed.
His newly published anthology, "War
Fever," is a welcome addition to the precise
and probing writings of one of the most
remarkable authors working in the West
today.
Abnormalities frequently appear in Bal
lard's writings, and although various
themes and devices tend to recur, the British
author's strongest trademark is his inven
tive, intellectual, black humor.
These qualities are evident in previous
publishings, such as his 1965 story "The
Drowned Giant," which starkly chronicles
the appearance of an immense corpse on
the beaches of an unidentified city. In this
and other pieces, such as "Manhole 69,"
nature produces frightening phenomena;
but in Ballard, the human mind, which he
views as fallible and dangerous, can be
equally aberrant.
Science fiction and fantastical elements
are absent from Ballard's "Empire of the
Sun," but one of its subtexts — that the
machinations of society are all too capable
of destroying its members — supplements
long-established themes in earlier works.
"Chronopolis," "Billenium" and "Build-
Up," (collected in the 1971 anthology

"Chronopolis") all portray the madness of
industrialized cultures that victimize their
human components.
Ballard's most recent novel, "Running
Wild" — in which model children from a
model community cunningly murder their
parents, making the most of their education
— extended his examination of the insane
society.
Ballard's essential message, one which he
constantly reiterates, is that equilibrium —
that is, an acceptable human existence — is
constantly endangered by the universe
around us. "War Fever" expands upon these
and other signature Ballard motifs, often in
superb fashion.
"The Secret History of World War 3," the
book's second story, brings Ronald Reagan
to the White House for a third term, which
offers an excellent opportunity to lampoon
the American public's delight in media
events.

The iconography of popular culture is
also dealt with in"The Object of the
Attack," narrated by the psychologist of a
would-be assassin. The assassin's psychosis
is entangled with the megalomania of an
American astronaut who has become a
modern-day messiah. Although this story
never establishes enough suspense to work
as a thriller, the implications of its terminal
events are frightening: Ballard invites the
reader to speculate on whether the success
ful assassination of a Hitler might have pre
vented bloodshed — or whether the death
of a Christ-figure might trigger disaster.
On the other hand, "The Air Disaster,"
one of the collection's oldest pieces, was
carefully constructed with effect in mind,
and is extremely successful in creating a
final, chilling image. "Love in a Colder Cli
mate" also attempts to evince irony, but
does so much more clumsily, and"The Man
Who Walked on the Moon" presents an
undeveloped, predictable narrative, albeit
one based on an interesting premise.
But these are the collection's largest mis
steps. While its newest story, "Dream Car
goes," is somewhat unfocused, evolving into
a surreal but lucid escapism, its style alone is
memorable. "War Fever" depicts a plan for
peace in a war-torn city, one which reveals
ignoble aspects and experiments of society.
It triumphs by portraying the birth of a
monster, who is quite convincingly shaped
by the events around him.
The best work in "War Fever" is "The
Enormous Space," a tightly controlled piece
in which Ballard once again depicts the
decay of the human mind. The fall into
insanity brings horror to the reader, but also
evokes a sense of wonder as the narrator
experiences breathtaking changes in his sur
roundings. "Memories of the Space Age"
and "Report on an Unidentified Space Sta
tion" share the same central motifs as "The
Enormous Space": metamorphosing uni
verses and deepening psychoses.

The message at the root of this collection
is that what is dangerous may often be dan
gerously seductive. Ballard continually
expands upon this theme, often in quite
inventive ways. "The Largest Theme Park in
the World" is an unlikely history of post
-1992 Europe, where an oddly civilized par
adise becomes the womb of a destructive
force as potent — and virulent — as that of
the title piece.
"Answers to a Questionnaire," the
book's only previously unpublished piece
(excepting its recent, unusual appearance
on the Op Ed page of The New York Times),
is even more unusual — although its form
conforms to the expectations raised by the
title, the piece still sparks the imagination.
"Notes Towards a Mental Breakdown"
also contains a succinct self-description: It
is "an 18-word synopsis and its set of foot
notes." We learn this from the ostensible,
fictional author, who may or may not be
mentally ill, who may or may not have writ
ten it and whose every word may or may not
be true. The final story of novel construc
tion is the book's concluding piece, "The
Index" — which is exactly that.
These two works — despite unique con
straints — elegantly depict the tortured and
violent depravity of sick individuals in mys
terious circumstances. In fact, with "The
Index," Ballard, always searching for unex
pected ironic twists, produces a fascinating
coup when the index's compiler affects the
work by including himself — an action
which violates the "objective" style of non
fiction writing, but which is wholly consis
tent with actions regularly taken by fiction
authors.
In "War Fever," Ballard once again strives
to evoke disturbing images and warnings.
Readers who have enjoyed his previous
works will welcome this writer's unique
narratives and precise prose. Those unfa

body of work which Ballard has developed.
His newly published anthology, "War
Fever," is a welcome addition to the precise
and probing writings of one of the most
remarkable authors working in the West
today.
Abnormalities frequently appear in Bal
lard's writings, and although various
themes and devices tend to recur, the British
author's strongest trademark is his inven
tive, intellectual, black humor.
These qualities are evident in previous
publishings, such as his 1965 story "The
Drowned Giant," which starkly chronicles
the appearance of an immense corpse on
the beaches of an unidentified city. In this
and other pieces, such as "Manhole 69,"
nature produces frightening phenomena;
but in Ballard, the human mind, which he
views as fallible and dangerous, can be
equally aberrant.
Science fiction and fantastical elements
are absent from Ballard's "Empire of the
Sun," but one of its subtexts — that the
machinations of society are all too capable
of destroying its members — supplements
long-established themes in earlier works.
"Chronopolis," "Billenium" and "Build-
Up," (collected in the 1971 anthology

"Chronopolis") all portray the madness of
industrialized cultures that victimize their
human components.
Ballard's most recent novel, "Running
Wild" — in which model children from a
model community cunningly murder their
parents, making the most of their education
— extended his examination of the insane
society.
Ballard's essential message, one which he
constantly reiterates, is that equilibrium —
that is, an acceptable human existence — is
constantly endangered by the universe
around us. "War Fever" expands upon these
and other signature Ballard motifs, often in
superb fashion.
"The Secret History of World War 3," the
book's second story, brings Ronald Reagan
to the White House for a third term, which
offers an excellent opportunity to lampoon
the American public's delight in media
events.

The iconography of popular culture is
also dealt with in"The Object of the
Attack," narrated by the psychologist of a
would-be assassin. The assassin's psychosis
is entangled with the megalomania of an
American astronaut who has become a
modern-day messiah. Although this story
never establishes enough suspense to work
as a thriller, the implications of its terminal
events are frightening: Ballard invites the
reader to speculate on whether the success
ful assassination of a Hitler might have pre
vented bloodshed — or whether the death
of a Christ-figure might trigger disaster.
On the other hand, "The Air Disaster,"
one of the collection's oldest pieces, was
carefully constructed with effect in mind,
and is extremely successful in creating a
final, chilling image. "Love in a Colder Cli
mate" also attempts to evince irony, but
does so much more clumsily, and"The Man
Who Walked on the Moon" presents an
undeveloped, predictable narrative, albeit
one based on an interesting premise.
But these are the collection's largest mis
steps. While its newest story, "Dream Car
goes," is somewhat unfocused, evolving into
a surreal but lucid escapism, its style alone is
memorable. "War Fever" depicts a plan for
peace in a war-torn city, one which reveals
ignoble aspects and experiments of society.
It triumphs by portraying the birth of a
monster, who is quite convincingly shaped
by the events around him.
The best work in "War Fever" is "The
Enormous Space," a tightly controlled piece
in which Ballard once again depicts the
decay of the human mind. The fall into
insanity brings horror to the reader, but also
evokes a sense of wonder as the narrator
experiences breathtaking changes in his sur
roundings. "Memories of the Space Age"
and "Report on an Unidentified Space Sta
tion" share the same central motifs as "The
Enormous Space": metamorphosing uni
verses and deepening psychoses.

The message at the root of this collection
is that what is dangerous may often be dan
gerously seductive. Ballard continually
expands upon this theme, often in quite
inventive ways. "The Largest Theme Park in
the World" is an unlikely history of post
-1992 Europe, where an oddly civilized par
adise becomes the womb of a destructive
force as potent — and virulent — as that of
the title piece.
"Answers to a Questionnaire," the
book's only previously unpublished piece
(excepting its recent, unusual appearance
on the Op Ed page of The New York Times),
is even more unusual — although its form
conforms to the expectations raised by the
title, the piece still sparks the imagination.
"Notes Towards a Mental Breakdown"
also contains a succinct self-description: It
is "an 18-word synopsis and its set of foot
notes." We learn this from the ostensible,
fictional author, who may or may not be
mentally ill, who may or may not have writ
ten it and whose every word may or may not
be true. The final story of novel construc
tion is the book's concluding piece, "The
Index" — which is exactly that.
These two works — despite unique con
straints — elegantly depict the tortured and
violent depravity of sick individuals in mys
terious circumstances. In fact, with "The
Index," Ballard, always searching for unex
pected ironic twists, produces a fascinating
coup when the index's compiler affects the
work by including himself — an action
which violates the "objective" style of non
fiction writing, but which is wholly consis
tent with actions regularly taken by fiction
authors.
In "War Fever," Ballard once again strives
to evoke disturbing images and warnings.
Readers who have enjoyed his previous
works will welcome this writer's unique
narratives and precise prose. Those unfa
miliar with Ballard, however, might be
advised to begin with another work.

War Fever
J.G. Ballard
Collins, 170 pages, $23.05
Reviewed by Matthew E. Milliken
J.G. Ballard's greatest fame came with
Steven Spielberg's "Empire of the Sun," the
movie based on Ballard's semi-autobio
graphical novel of the same name. However,
the British author has been known to sci
ence fiction readers for decades, having
written several novels and collections
attributed to that field.
Still, the science fiction label, while
validly describing some of his efforts, fails to
capture the essence of the wide and original
body of work which Ballard has developed.
His newly published anthology, "War
Fever," is a welcome addition to the precise
and probing writings of one of the most
remarkable authors working in the West
