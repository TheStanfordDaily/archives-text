# Contraceptive information presented to Soviets
## 
### Robin Mathison Staff writer 
In the spirit of glasnost, Stanford stu
dents gave more than 2,000 condoms and a
crash course in safer sex to a group of
Soviet exchange students yesterday.
Equipped with bananas, cucumbers and
a plastic model of a woman's reproductive
system, the AIDS Education Project and
the Contraceptive Information Center
jointly presented a safer-sex outreach pro
gram at Columbae for about 12 Soviet visi
tors.
The Soviets, who are participating in the
Stanford-Soviet Exchange Project, are
halfway through their two-week visit to
campus.

Using various visual aids, student volun
teers attempted to overcome the language
barrier and educate the Soviet students
about contraceptives and sexually trans
mitted diseases.
The first half of the program focused on
the dangers of sexually transmitted dis
eases and discussed appropriate preventive
measures. Junior Yelena Ginzburg, whose
parents are from the Soviet Union, pre
sented the material in fluent Russian, paus
ing to find a translation for terms such as
"bodily fluids" and "AIDS."
Ginzburg was stumped by the Russian
phrase for "sexually active." Since the Rus
sian root for the word "sex" is the same as
that for the word "floor," Ginzburg mistook
the phrase to mean "sex on the floor."

Using a banana and a Dlastic dildo, she
demonstrated how to use a condom cor
rectly. She passed bunches of bananas and a
basket of condoms around the room to
encourage hands-on experience.
The second half of the program centered
around various other contraceptive meth
ods, including the birth control pill,
diaphragm, cervical cap, spermicide and
contraceptive sponge. Seniors Raquel Stote
and Michelle Pearl explained their uses and
failure rates.
Except for the sponge, all of these meth
ods are sold in the Soviet Union, said Soviet
student Julia Nikylina. However the qual
ity is poor and they are extremely scarce,
she added.
"If you find [the birth control pill], you'll

buy enough for the rest of your life," said
Nikylina.
The most prevalent Soviet method of
birth control is the rhythm method, said
Nikylina, in which women count the days of
their menstrual cycle and predict their ovu
lation. Other popular forms of birth control
are condoms, which cost as much as $5
apiece in the black market, and abortion,
she said.
The average woman has two abortions
during her lifetime, although poorer
women may have as many as 10, since the
process is cheaper and more available than
preventive measures, said Nikylina. Doc
tors usually perform surgical abortions,
which frequently cause infections
and sterility, rather than the safer
vacuum procedure commonly
used in the United States, she
added.

Contraception is
important to us but we
tend not to discuss it.

Nikylina said almost every
woman she knows has had at
least one abortion.
Sexual education in the Soviet
Union is poorly taught, she said.
"At first we felt uneasy" during
the Stanford presentation, "due
to our conservative mind set," she
said. "It's important to everyone
but we tend not to discuss it with
each other."
The audience did enjoy playing
with the contraceptive devices
that Stote passed around. Several
men inflated the rose-patterned
condoms, while others tasted the
spermicide or stretched out the
diaphragms.
Nikylina mentioned the reluc
tance of Soviet men to participate
in contraception. "Our men are
very hard to persuade to use con
doms. . . . 'You're fine,' they say.
'It's your responsibility. It's your
problem,' " she said.
