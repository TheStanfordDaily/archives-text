# Great Gothic imposters
## 
### Leah Edwards 
What do the following duos have
in common: President George Bush
and Vice President Dan Quayle,
Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse,
and Art Department Chair Wanda
Corn and University President Donald
Kennedy?
Nope. They are not being featured
on the next F-Series postage stamp.
Guess again.
All of the aforementioned couples
have been featured in takeoffs of
Grant Wood's famous painting,
"American Gothic." Believe it or not,
there are literally hundreds of such
parodies, and Corn and her husband
own a good deal of them.
Wood's depiction of a farmer and
his spinster daughter (who was mod
eled after Wood's sister) in front of
their Gothic home has been used by
everyone —from political cartoonists
to satirists to advertisers. It often
evokes images of the down-to-earth,
individualistic American farmer on
whom this country is supposedly
based.
Wood painted American Gothic in
1930, but parodies did not appear
until the '60s. Corn explains, " 'Amer
ican Gothic* was a very convenient
hippy image: the back-to-the-earth
individuality. The painting stood for
standing your own ground." She adds
that it's also no coincidence that the
imitations and takeoffs began to
appear as pop art was evolving. "Pop
art gave the culture permission to
make art about art or things about art.
Pop art was about being irreverent."
Since then, the ways "American
Gothic" has been used is a good reflec
tion of the changing values and issues

over the years. These days, the classic
work is frequently used for more com
mercial purposes: to sell jeans and
gingham, pasta and electronics. As a
public image, the "American Gothic"
couple can be made to speak for any
one.
"People often ask me whether I
think Grant Wood would be insulted
by the mimicry," says Corn. "Of
course I can't know for sure, but I feel
he would see it as a great compliment
and be very amused. He had a very
good sense of humor. He had a very
dry wit."
In memory of Wood's talent, and
in honor of what would have been his
100 th birthday, the Corns have lent
over 100 "imitations" of his work to
the Stanford Art Gallery. The exhibit
will continue until May 12, and coin
cides with American Gothic Day,
which is Sunday, April 21.
Both seriousness and humor
promise to be a part of this Sunday's
festivities. Corn will lecture on the
"American Gothic" and its takeoffs at
2:30 p.m., in Annenberg Auditorium,
and the exhibit itself will be open from
noon until 6 p.m.
However, that's only the beginning.
For some, the best part of the day
will be having the opportunity to be
"American Gothic." After Corn's
opening speech, a look-alike contest
will be held that will be judged by an
esteemed panel. Judges include Car
olyn Lougee, associate dean of the
School of Humanities and Sciences,
Tom Selegman, the new director of the
Stanford Art Museum and Peter Stan
sky of the History Department.

information, call Mona at 725-0143.

The pose is familiar. The people are familiar. Yet something's not quite right.
