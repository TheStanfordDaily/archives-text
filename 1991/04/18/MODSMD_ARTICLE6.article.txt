# African students focus on raising awareness

Awareness works both ways.
As members of the Stanford African Student
Association, Tahir Salie and Bertram Eyakuze have
worked hard organizing this week's Africa Week cel
ebration to create awareness of African culture and
history among the Stanford community.
But they also work hard to make Africans more
aware of the world around them.
"It is critical that our youth become increasingly
aware that they are part of the African continent,"
said graduate student Salie, a native of South Africa.
He said the country is "isolated" from the inter
national community and even the rest of African
continent. Because of this isolation, he added, people
in South Africa "think everyone else thinks the way
they do."
Salie, president of the 50-member student associ
ation, was born in Capetown, South Africa. After
completing a masters' program in international edu
cation this August, he will return to South Africa to
continue his job as Director of Human Resources for
the African National Congress.
As the director of the Careers Research and Infor
mation Center in South Africa before he came to
Stanford, Salie helped black youths deal with unem
ployment and find jobs that had been mostly taken
by the white minority.


Sophomore Bertram Eyakuze and graduate student Tahir Salle helped organize Africa Week to cele
brate their countries' cultures. Both students are native Africans who feel strong connections to their
homeland and hope to return there after they complete their studies at Stanford.
